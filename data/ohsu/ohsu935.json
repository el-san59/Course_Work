  ".W": "To determine if diets are associated with different rates of interdigestive and postprandial enzyme secretion and how quickly enzyme secretion is modulated by nutrients, 27 healthy humans were randomly selected to follow one of five diets. The calorie proportions of carbohydrate, fat, and protein in each diet was assigned by a mixture design. After the subjects followed a diet for 2 weeks, they were intubated with an oroduodenal tube, and enzyme outputs were measured during the interdigestive period and after eating a meal identical to meals eaten during the previous 2 weeks. For the next 24 hours subjects either followed the same diet or a diet that contained the same amount of fat, but the percent of carbohydrate and protein was changed by 30%. Then interdigestive and postprandial pancreatic enzyme outputs were remeasured. After 2 weeks, diets containing the most carbohydrate (50%-80%) were associated with the lowest interdigestive and postprandial amylase and lipase (P less than 0.05) and trypsin outputs (P less than or equal to 0.05). In contrast, diets containing the most fat (40%) were associated with the highest interdigestive and postprandial outputs of amylase (P less than 0.05) and trypsin (P less than 0.05). Maintaining or altering diets for 24 hours did not change interdigestive pancreatic enzyme outputs, but postprandial amylase output was significantly increased (P less than 0.05) by increasing protein and decreasing carbohydrate content of the diets by 30% for 24 hours. We conclude that diets containing a high proportion of calories as carbohydrate for 2 weeks are associated with lower interdigestive and postprandial pancreatic secretion than diets that have a high fat content. In response to diets, changes in postprandial pancreatic enzyme secretion occur within 24 hours whereas changes in interdigestive secretion (no nutrients in the lumen) occur after 24 hours.\r"

  ".U": "91032808\r", 
  ".W": "Ceftriaxone, a semisynthetic third-generation cephalosporin, has recently been associated with biliary sludge formation. Analysis of the biliary concretions induced by this agent shows a calcium salt of ceftriaxone. The present in vitro studies were undertaken to provide insight into the pathogenesis of ceftriaxone-associated biliary sludge formation by evaluating possible interactions that may exist between calcium, bile salts, and ceftriaxone. Ceftriaxone possessed high calcium-binding affinity. The formation constant for the calcium ceftriaxone salt at 37 degrees C was about 157.3 L/mol; stoichiometry of the salt was 1:1, i.e., calcium ceftriaxone. The calcium-binding property of ceftriaxone was observed to be additive to that of taurocholate in mixed taurocholate-ceftriaxone solutions. Although the solubility product constant for calcium ceftriaxone was only 1.62 x 10(-6) mol/L2, marked metastability was observed; neither visible nor microscopic precipitates developed until the [Ca2+] x [ceftriaxone] ion product exceeded the solubility product constant by a factor of 10.4. Metastability of the calcium ceftriaxone salt was also observed in human gallbladder bile in vitro. Estimates of human biliary calcium ceftriaxone solubility in vivo were than calculated from previously-reported values for biliary [Ca2+], [ceftriaxone], and from the solubility product constant as defined in this study. Calculated saturation indices for calcium-ceftriaxone in human bile generally increased (corresponding to a decrease in solubility) with increasing ceftriaxone dose. At doses less than or equal to 1 g, saturation index was well within the metastable range of this calcium-salt. However, at doses greater than or equal to 2 g, the saturation index surpassed the metastable limit. Under these conditions, precipitation of ceftriaxone could occur. It was concluded that the development of ceftriaxone-induced biliary sludge is a solubility problem that occurs in patients receiving high-dose treatment (greater than or equal to 2 g). This study proposes that the risk of developing ceftriaxone-associated biliary \"pseudolithiasis\" increases with increasing ceftriaxone dose and in patients with impaired gallbladder emptying.\r"

  ".W": "Gallbladder motility was evaluated by ultrasonography in 75 cholesterol gallstone patients and in 77 matched control subjects. All 75 gallstone patients were candidates for oral bile acid therapy (radiolucent gallstones, less than 2 cm in diameter, in well-opacified gallbladder), and 38 of them were also studied during ursodeoxycholic acid administration. An additional 20 gallstone patients were studied 1 year after confirmed gallstone dissolution with oral bile acids. Gallstone patients showed significantly greater fasting and residual volumes, a decreased percent of gallbladder emptying, but a similar absolute emptying and emptying rate compared with the control subjects. Greater fasting volumes and reduced percents of gallbladder emptying were also found in gallstone-free patients who achieved complete dissolution with oral bile acids. After ursodeoxycholic acid administration, fasting gallbladder volumes were greater, and percents of gallbladder emptying were further decreased than in untreated gallstone patients. In conclusion, greater fasting volumes, and not reduced gallbladder contractility, account for the defective gallbladder function in radiolucent (cholesterol-rich) gallstone patients. This condition is likely to precede, and possibly to promote, gallstone formation because it persists after gallstone dissolution. Ursodeoxycholic acid administration worsens the defect observed in gallstone patients. This finding also suggests, although indirectly, that the expected normalization of cholesterol saturation during oral bile acid administration is not paralleled by an improvement in gallbladder function.\r"

  ".W": "Primary biliary cirrhosis is characterized by the presence of antimitochondrial antibodies. Recently, six of the autoantigens have been identified as components of the 2-oxo acid dehydrogenase multienzyme complexes located within mammalian mitochondria. Immunoblotting studies have shown that two of these components, namely E2 and protein X of pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, are the major antigenic polypeptides recognized by autoantibodies. This study shows the development of an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to detect and quantitate antibodies to these two purified antigens. Coded serum samples from 166 patients with primary biliary cirrhosis, 140 patients with other liver and/or autoimmune disease, and 52 normal women were analyzed for reactivity using this immunoassay. These results indicate that this rapid, simple method has a 93% sensitivity and 96% specificity in the diagnosis of primary biliary cirrhosis. The titer of immunoglobulin G autoantibodies correlated not only with antimitochondrial antibody titer measured by indirect immunofluorescence (P less than 0.0001) but also with histological stage of disease (P less than 0.04) and prognostic biochemical variables such as higher serum bilirubin and lower serum albumin levels (P = 0.038 and 0.028, respectively). There was no significant correlation between titer of autoantibodies and serum globulin or immunoglobulin G levels, indicating that the positive correlation with disease progression was not secondary to hypergammaglobulinemia.\r"

Forty of the 122 children (32.7%) were alive after 10 years. Firm hepatomegaly was present in 31 and splenomegaly in 29 children. Serum bilirubin or all liver function tests were normal in 21 and 11 children, respectively; survival rate decreased with the age at operation, but no significant difference was observed in the rate of children surviving with normal serum bilirubin whether they underwent surgery before age 2 months or between 2 and 3 months. Twenty-four had esophageal varices and 15 experienced gastrointestinal bleeding. Normal liver-function tests and absence of portal hypertension were observed in 11 of 122 children. These results indicate that Kasai's procedures were helpful in a significant proportion of children with biliary atresia who underwent surgery during this period. However, 80% of children who initially underwent surgery with Kasai's procedures should eventually undergo liver transplantation.\r"

  ".W": "A phospholipase C in bile, free of bacterial infection, has recently been identified from cholesterol gallstone patients. Because of the importance of phosphatidylcholine in solubilizing cholesterol in bile, this study further investigates the metabolism of phosphatidylcholine in delipidated gallbladder and common bile duct biles. Phospholipase C activity, as measured by the release of phosphoryl[3H]choline from the substrate 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho [N-methyl-3H]choline, was identified in both hepatic and gallbladder biles. Similar levels of activity (nmol.h-1.mg-1 of delipidated protein) were found in common bile duct (11.25 +/- 14.23) and gallbladder bile (19.07 +/- 22.24), although per milliliter of bile, the mean gallbaldder levels were 6.4 times greater than those found in common duct bile. With the tow substrates, 1-palmitoyl-2[9,10-3H] palmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine and 1,2(1-14C) dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine, the majority of organically extracted label, after thin-layer chromatography, was recovered as radiolabeled diglyceride, confirming the presence of phospholipase C. Diglyceride levels were found to be closely correlated with [3H]choline (slope, 0.9820; r = 0.9844). In addition to diglyceride, both radiolabeled free fatty acid and monoglyceride were identified in common bile duct and gallbladder biles, although their levels were an order of magnitude less than measurable phospholipase C activity. To determine whether the free fatty acid release was due to either a diacylglycerol-lipase or a phospholipase A2, the effect of adding unlabeled diglyceride on free fatty acid formation from the substrate [14C]DPPC was examined. As the concentration of unlabeled diglyceride was increased, the amount of free fatty acid and monoglyceride released were both reduced in parallel. Direct measurement of diacylglycerol-lipase activity by incubating the diglyceride, sn-2[3H]dipalmitoyl, resulted in release of both products in a ratio similar to that found with sn-2[3H]DPPC. Finally, no radiolabeled lysolecithin was identified with [3H]choline-DPPC or [14C]DPPC as substrate indicating the free fatty acid was the product of a diacylglycerol-lipase rather than a phospholipase A2. Phospholipase C and diacyl-glycerol-lipase activities were significantly correlated (P less than 0.01).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "To improve the efficacy, safety, and convenience of contact dissolution of gallbladder stones, a microprocessor-assisted solvent transfer system was developed. The system's two pumps simultaneously infuse and aspirate solvent into and from the gallbladder at a high flow rate through a multilumen catheter. The microprocessor controls the pumps using a closed feedback loop control algorithm to regulate intragallbladder pressure to prevent solvent escape into the duodenum. Turbulent solvent flow at the catheter end in the gallbladder is designed to induce rapid stone dissolution and to suspend insoluble residue, thus promoting its aspiration. The system's response and gallbladder emptying capacity was 160-fold faster than the natural gallbladder emptying rate. The rate at which gallstones were dissolved by methyl tert-butyl ether using the system was compared with that achieved with a syringe pump. For 6 of 11 pairs of stones that totally dissolved, the mean dissolution time with the system was 10 +/- 6 minutes compared with 112 +/- 81 minutes for the syringe pump. In the 5 of 11 stone pairs which dissolved incompletely, insoluble residue was completely eliminated by the system in 21 +/- 9 minutes but not by the syringe pump even at 360 minutes. When the system was used in gallstone patients, solvent recovery was 99% +/- 1%, and the concentration of a nonabsorbable marker did not change, confirming the lack of appreciable absorption of methyl tert-butyl ether. These studies suggest that the microprocessor-assisted solvent transfer system is a device capable of safe, complete, and fully automatic contact dissolution of cholesterol gallbladder stones using methyl tert-butyl ether or similar solvents.\r"

The patients received a 3-day standardized oral regimen providing daily 30 kcal/kg of ideal body weight (IBW).

Compared with controls, malabsorption patients had decreased body weight and triceps skin-fold but no features of protein malnutrition. their mean daily food intake at home was significantly enhanced (39.6 +/- 13.1 kcal/IBW kg) vs. controls (28.8 +/- 5.8 kcal/IBW kg, P less than 0.001). In the malabsorption group, caloric intake was higher in the normonourished patients than in those with mild malnutrition. This study shows that a chronic malabsorption has limited nutritional consequences. The patients compensate for their absorptive handicap by increasing their oral intake.\r"

Serum alkaline phosphatase counts ranged from 1 to 16 times the upper normal value, and total bilirubin counts ranged from 0.6 to 8.8 mg/dL (10 to 150 mumol/L). Initial liver biopsy showed portal and periportal fibrosis with cholangiolar proliferation and reduction in the number of interlobular bile ducts. Antimitochondrial antibodies were absent, and bile ducts were normal after opacification. The patients were observed for 3-11 years. Repeated liver biopsies in the five patients showed progression of the lesions, with development of biliary type cirrhosis in four. Two of the four patients with cirrhosis died of hepatic failure 3 and 11 years after onset of the disease. In the two other cases, liver transplantation was performed successfully. These cases suggest that chronic cholestasis with marked ductopenia resembling the nonsyndromatic paucity described in infancy and childhood may reveal itself at an adult age. This disorder, possibly familial, may rapidly progress to severe and even fatal liver disease and could be a new indication for liver transplantation.\r"

In each case one or more complications had occurred: severe pain in 3, stricture formation in 4, and recurrent hemorrhage in 7 cases. After an 8-week course of omeprazole, 40 mg daily, endoscopy confirmed complete healing of the ulceration in all 10 cases with symptom resolution. In 2 cases the ulcer recurred, with associated bleeding within 6 weeks of discontinuing the treatment in 1 patient. Both cases responded to repeat therapy.

More enteric neurons contained microtubule-associated proteins 5 and tau than neurofilament proteins.

With the increase in the number of endoscopic procedures being performed, these tumors are often detected incidentally at colonoscopy. Although the risks of removing these tumors have been recognized, numerous reports have documented safe removal by snare electrocautery. We have reviewed the clinical outcome and the endoscopic and histopathologic features of seven lipomas that were endoscopically removed over a 5-year period. Four patients recovered uneventfully, while three patients (42.8%) developed colonic perforation after the polypectomy. In the latter group, the lipomas were significantly larger than they were in the patients who did not develop colonic perforation (1.9 +/- 0.4 and 4.2 +/- 0.7 cm, respectively; p = 0.048). Furthermore, the polypectomy specimens from those patients who developed perforation all contained significant muscularis propria. Lipomatous polyps that are identified at endoscopy to be greater than or equal to 2 cm in diameter and to have a limited pedicle are at the greatest risk for endoscopic perforation.\r"

We attempted to increase yield pressure endoscopically in the dog by using the Nd:YAG laser to produce a fibrous scar at the cardia in the approximate line of the gastric sling fibers. Ten beagle dogs were studied. In a pilot study with two dogs, 15 watts for 4.2 sec were found to produce a scar deep into the muscle coat of the stomach. Three configurations of scar were used. One produced significant rises in yield pressure in all four of the dogs treated, the second produced a significant rise in one of the two dogs treated, and the third caused a significant drop in yield pressure in the one dog treated. One dog died of gastric perforation 10 days after lasering, but no other animal experienced any ill effects. These findings may have therapeutic implications for the management of esophageal reflux.\r"

The only non-invasive alternative available to now, endoscopic retrograde cannulation of the cystic duct, was difficult because of the cystic duct's tortuosity and spiral valves. We therefore developed a catheter system which, using conventional duodenoscopes during a routine endoscopic retrograde cholangiography (ERC) procedure, permits reliable and safe catheterization of the gallbladder without the need for endoscopic sphincterotomy. In 18 of 22 patients (82%) we were able to place a cysto-nasal catheter, and in 14 patients MTBE dissolution therapy was then performed. Eight patients (57%) were completely free of stones after treatment; the other six (43%) had residual debris. In 4 of 22 patients (18%) cannulation attempts failed, in 3 patients due to cystic duct blockage by a calculus. Endoscopic retrograde cannulation of the gallbladder (ERCG) represents a promising alternative to the invasive percutaneous transhepatic catheterization procedure.\r"

Immediate results were satisfactory despite an operative mortality of 18%, and neither early nor late clogging was observed even in patients who presented previously with sludge above plastic stents that were removed. However, among five patients followed for more than 4 months, two presented with obstruction due to tumor ingrowth into the stent through the metallic mesh. Accordingly, initial enthusiasm concerning long-term patency of these stents has decreased. However, we describe a technique of \"diathermic cleaning\" of tumor ingrowth which can easily restore the stent patency. The advantages of these wire mesh 30 F stents are their easier insertion, better immediate drainage, and absence of dislocation or perforation.\r"

The significance of this phenomenon is not clear, but it is touted by some to be a provocative test for sphincter of Oddi dysfunction. Sphincter of Oddi manometry was performed on 224 consecutive patients referred over a 2-year period for evaluation of post-cholecystectomy syndrome and suspected sphincter of Oddi dysfunction. All patients received only intravenous diazepam as premedication for ERCP. Delayed drainage time (greater than 45 min), bile duct dilation (greater than or equal to 12 mm), and a basal sphincter of Oddi pressure of greater than 40 mm Hg (mean +/- 3 SD) were considered elevated. We observed a reproduction of pain in 15 of 224 patients (6.7%) immediately following contrast injection. There was no correlation between pain on contrast injection and elevated basal sphincter of Oddi pressure, delayed common bile duct drainage, bile duct dilation, or abnormal liver enzymes. Therefore, we feel that reproduction of the patient's biliary-type pain associated with contrast injection of ERCP is not a provocative test for sphincter of Oddi dysfunction.\r"

As compared with the standard perfusion system, the aspiration catheter was associated with a decreased frequency of clinical pancreatitis (23.5% vs. 3%, p = 0.01) reduced hospital stay (5 +/- 1.83 days, mean +/- SE, versus 1 day; p = 0.03) and milder pancreatitis. The aspiration manometry catheter should be considered for standard use for SOM, particularly if the pancreatic duct sphincter is being evaluated.\r"

When gallbladder contraction occurred in normal patients with an intact gallbladder, no change or a diminution in duct caliber was observed. When gallbladder contraction was not observed, a normal response was considered to be the same as that in post-cholecystectomy patients with a diminution in duct caliber occurring. By using these criteria two false negatives, both with hypertensive sphincters of Oddi that responded normally to sincalide injection, were encountered.

We reviewed the records of seven patients with peristomal varices, who were followed for a mean of 17 months after diagnosis. Fourteen episodes of clinically significant peristomal bleeding occurred in six patients. Surgical ligation of varices was ineffective in controlling bleeding in two of three patients, although stoma revision with devascularization was temporarily effective in two other patients. Injection sclerotherapy, used in three patients, effectively controlled acute bleeding without serious complications or need for surgery. Definitive treatment for peristomal bleeding (portacaval shunt or liver transplantation) has prevented any further bleeding in three patients for a mean of 8 months after surgery.\r"

The 32 consenting patients were submitted to injection sclerotherapy paravariceally, using ethanolamine oleate; the 18 refusing to participate were assigned to the control group. The incidence of rebleeding was 28.1% in the former and 44.5% in the latter, a difference which was not statistically significant (Fisher's test, p = 0.375). Mortality from rupture of esophageal varices was 3.1% in the sclerotherapy group and 27.7% in the control group, a statistically significant difference (Fischer's test, p = 0.017). Since sclerotherapy markedly improved the long-term survival rate of the patients, this procedure is advocated for the treatment of esophageal varices in cases of portal hypertension due to schistosomiasis.\r"

The severity of Schatzki's ring was mild in 28 patients (46%), moderate in 26 (43%), severe in 5 (8%), and indeterminate in 2 (3%). Follow-up information was available in 56 of 61 patients (mean, 75 months). During follow-up, 35 patients (63%) developed recurrent dysphagia and required repeated dilations: 19 patients (34%) had one to two dilations, 9 patients (16%) had three to seven dilations, 6 patients (11%) had more than seven dilations; 1 patient underwent surgery for resection of the Schatzki's ring (2%). The mean (range) dilation-free interval was 50.1 months (11.8 to 100 months) in mild cases, 44.5 months (8.9 to 82 months) in moderate cases, and 28.6 months (9 to 76 months) in severe cases. There was no significant correlation between the severity of Schatzki's ring on initial presentation and the subsequent dilation-free interval. Our data indicate that recurrent dysphagia is common among patients with Schatzki's ring after a successful dilation, and that the severity of Schatzki's ring is not a good prognostic indicator of the need for subsequent dilation.\r"

The Witzel pneumatic balloon dilator, unlike fluoroscopically placed dilators, is placed over a standard gastroscope allowing positioning and dilation under direct vision. We report our experience with the Witzel dilator in 45 patients with achalasia over a 5-year period. All patients had at least one major symptom score of 8 out of 10 for dysphagia and/or regurgitation before dilation. After Witzel dilation, symptomatic response was graded as excellent (score 0 to 2), good (score 3 to 5), fair (score 6 to 8), and poor (no improvement). Symptom response was assessed after 1 week, 1 month, 6 month, 1 year, and present. The mean period of follow-up was 25 months (range, 3 to 85 months). Passage of the balloon across the gastroesophageal junction was technically unsuccessful in three patients. Esophageal perforation occurred in two patients (4%) and transient chest pain greater than 2 days in three patients (7%). There was no bleeding or death. Symptomatic long-term improvement was excellent in 25 patients (63%), good in 6 patients (15%), fair in 4 patients (10%), and poor in 5 patients (12%). A repeat Witzel dilation was performed in five patients but resulted in good/excellent improvement in only one patient. We conclude that pneumatic dilation with the Witzel balloon is a safe, effective procedure for achalasia.\r"

The desaturation was unpredictable because there was no correlation between desaturation and medication, tolerance to the procedure, weight, or age of the child. Some patients who subjectively appeared to tolerate the procedure well had significant desaturation. The use of pulse oximetry should be considered for all children undergoing upper gastrointestinal endoscopy.\r"

  ".U": "91033590\r", 
  ".W": "The effects of chronic ethanol administration on the receptor-mediated endocytosis of epidermal growth factor were studied in isolated rat hepatocytes. In initial experiments, it was demonstrated that significantly less ligand was bound by hepatocytes isolated from rats fed an ethanol liquid diet for 5 to 7 wk than by cells isolated from chow-fed or pair-fed controls. Reduced binding was shown to be primarily caused by a decreased number of surface receptors rather than by changes in receptor affinity. When hepatocytes were incubated at 37 degrees C in the presence of a large saturating concentration of epidermal growth factor (80 nmol/L), intracellular levels of the ligand were significantly lower in cells from the ethanol-fed animals. However, no effect on degradation of the ligand was observed under those conditions. A defect in the initial stages of receptor-ligand internalization was also indicated because less surface-bound ligand was internalized and subsequently degraded in cells from the ethanol-treated rats. When the endocytosis of a lower, more physiological concentration of the growth factor (0.5 nmol/L) was studied, both the uptake of ligand and its degradation were markedly impaired in hepatocytes from the ethanol-fed animals. These results indicate that chronic ethanol administration impairs the receptor-mediated endocytosis of epidermal growth factor by the liver. The major impairment appears to be a reduction of cell surface receptors; however, other steps of the endocytotic pathway also appear to be affected. These altered steps include defective receptor-ligand internalization and changes in intracellular processing of the ligand leading to decreased degradation.\r"

  ".U": "91033591\r", 
  ".W": "The ethanol-inducible form of cytochrome P-450 (IIE1) is expressed and induced by ethanol, predominantly in the centrilobular region. Because this isoenzyme has a particularly high capacity to convert carbon tetrachloride and several other hepatotoxins into reactive intermediates, its role in producing damage was studied by comparing the effect of carbon tetrachloride exposure on hepatocytes isolated from either the periportal or the perivenous region by digitonin-collagenase perfusion. After exposure for 18 hr of primary culture to 600 mumol/L of carbon tetrachloride, periportal cells were only slightly damaged, as estimated from dye exclusion and lactate dehydrogenase leakage. In marked contrast, perivenous cells, which contained a several-fold higher amount of immunoreactive P-450 IIE1 apoprotein, were partly damaged after exposure to 60 to 150 mumol/L of carbon tetrachloride and severely damaged after 600 mumol/L. Similarly, lipid peroxidation after carbon tetrachloride was much more prominent in perivenous cells. The differences between perivenous and periportal cells in carbon tetrachloride-induced injury were larger when cells were isolated from chronically ethanol-treated rats. Isoniazid, an efficient inhibitor of P-450 IIE1, protected against damage by carbon tetrachloride more efficiently than the general P-450 inhibitor cimetidine. Our results suggest that the greater susceptibility of the perivenous hepatocytes to carbon tetrachloride-induced damage is associated with the high expression of P-450 IIE1 in these cells. This enzyme may also be involved in damage elicited by several other typical centrilobular hepatotoxins.\r"

  ".W": "Periportal and perivenous hepatocytes were isolated from rats fed a high-fat, ethanol-containing diet to investigate the acinar heterogeneity of the effects of prolonged ethanol administration on lipid metabolism. Chronic feeding of ethanol caused a rather selective accumulation of triacylglycerols in the perivenous zone of the liver. In control animals the rate of lipogenesis and the activity of acetyl-CoA carboxylase were higher in perivenous than in periportal hepatocytes, whereas the rate of fatty acid oxidation and the activity of carnitine palmitoyltransferase I were higher in periportal than in perivenous cells; however, no zonation was evident for very-low-density-lipoprotein-lipid secretion. Prolonged ethanol administration abolished the zonal asymmetry of the lipogenic process and inverted the acinar distribution of the fatty acid-oxidative process (i.e., in ethanol-fed animals the rate of fatty acid oxidation and the activity of carnitine palmitoyltransferase I were higher in perivenous than in periportal hepatocytes). Moreover, chronic feeding of ethanol led to a marked and selective inhibition of very-low-density-lipoprotein-triacylglycerol secretion by the perivenous zone of the liver. Nevertheless, no zonal differences were observed between control and ethanol-fed animals with respect to the effects of acute doses of ethanol and acetaldehyde on lipid metabolism. In conclusion, our results show that chronic ethanol intake produces important alterations in the acinar distribution of the different fatty acid-metabolizing pathways.\r"

  ".W": "Steatohepatitis (fatty liver hepatitis), histologically identical to alcoholic disease, occurs in some obese patients after jejunoileal bypass. A similar lesion occurs rarely in obese patients without bypass surgery, but the risk factors are poorly understood. Hepatic steatosis, steatohepatitis and fibrosis were sought in 351 apparently nonalcoholic patients at autopsy and various risk factors were evaluated. Incidence of steatosis and steatohepatitis correlated with the degree of obesity. Steatohepatitis was found in 18.5% of markedly obese patients and 2.7% of lean patients. Additional risk factors for steatohepatitis were type II diabetes, weight loss in the preterminal period shortly before death and intravenous glucose therapy in the last week of life. Severe fibrosis was found in 13.8% of markedly obese patients and in 6.6% of lean patients; this difference was largely explained by the higher prevalence of diabetes in obese groups. The risk factors defined in this study are known to be associated with abnormalities of free fatty acid metabolism. Obesity, type II diabetes and intravenous glucose therapy are associated with hyperinsulinemia, which may inhibit fatty acid oxidation. Obesity and weight loss increase the presentation of fatty acids to the liver. Similar metabolic changes may occur in obese patients after jejunoileal bypass surgery. Thus this study supports the hypothesis that fatty acids have a role in the hepatocellular necrosis found in some obese individuals.\r"

To assess whether immunological parameters were predictive of response to interferon therapy, we determined the human leukocyte antigen type, CD4/CD8 ratio, natural killer cell activity, IgM anti-HBc antibody levels and concanavalin A-induced lymphocyte proliferative response in 30 patients before treatment. In addition, to investigate the mechanisms of action of interferon in promoting hepatitis B virus clearance, we serially measured the CD4/CD8 ratios, natural killer activity and lymphocyte proliferative response at wk 4, 8 and 12 of treatment. A beneficial response to therapy was defined as the sustained clearance of HBeAg and serum hepatitis B virus DNA within 1 yr of commencing therapy. Elevated IgM anti-HBc levels were associated with a beneficial response to therapy, but there was no correlation observed between response and pretreatment CD4/CD8 ratio, natural killer activity or lymphocyte proliferative response. Six of seven human leukocyte antigen DR3-positive patients responded. No measurable changes in the immunological parameters studied were observed in the nonresponder group, whereas a significant rise in CD4/CD8 ratio, associated with a fall in peripheral CD8 number and a decline in measurable NK activity, was seen in the responder group. These changes were maximal at the time of hepatitis B virus DNA clearance, which was associated with a transient increase in hepatic inflammation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

A significant anti-hepatitis delta response was observed that did not, however, protect the animals from hepatitis delta virus superinfection. Unexpectedly, the period of detectable viremia was longer in the immunized than in the control animals. We conclude that immunization with this recombinant hepatitis delta antigen does not afford protection against subsequent hepatitis delta virus exposure.\r"

Antibodies reacting with both nuclear lamins A and C, which share extensive sequence homologies, have been reported to occur in autoimmune hepatitis and primary biliary cirrhosis.

In addition, the hormones (insulin, glucagon, estradiol and androgen), which in animals are known to reflect and possibly modulate regeneration, were measured. Changes in all these indices followed the same pattern as in rats, dogs and swine but at a slower rate. Ornithine decarboxylase and estradiol increased within 24 hr, but thymidine kinase and insulin rises did not become statistically significant until 3 to 5 days. Using these plasma or serum indices as surrogate measures of biochemical events in the liver itself, regeneration reached a maximum after 4 or 5 days. By computed tomography scan analysis, restoration of hepatic cell mass was not complete until 3 wk.\r"

  ".W": "Short-term and long-term regulation of hepatic carbohydrate metabolism by insulinlike growth factor-I was studied in primary cultures of adult rat hepatocytes and compared with the metabolic potency of insulin. Insulinlike growth factor-I stimulated the formation of [14C]lactate from [14C]glucose up to three-fold with a half-maximally effective concentration of approximately 50 nmol/L. Basal glycogenolysis was inhibited by about 20%, and glucagon-activated glycogenolysis was blocked completely by insulinlike growth factor-I with half-maximally effective concentrations of about 1.5 to 2 nmol/L. The activity of the key glycolytic enzymes glucokinase and pyruvate kinase were induced twofold. The glucagon-dependent induction of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase--the key gluconeogenic enzyme--was antagonized with a half-maximally effective concentration of about 5 nmol/L. This inhibition of the glucagon-dependent induction of the enzyme was accompanied by a similar reduction of the increase in phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase-mRNA level as assessed by Northern blot analysis. The potency of insulinlike growth factor-I at half-maximally effective concentrations was approximately 2% to 4% that of insulin. Because binding studies demonstrated a comparably low affinity of insulinlike growth factor-I to the insulin receptor, it is suggested that in adult liver--in contrast to fetal and regenerating liver--insulinlike growth factor-I could exert short-term and long-term metabolic effects on parenchymal cells only through interaction with the insulin receptor.\r"

Human hepatic stimulator substance proved to be heat-stable, protease-sensitive, organ-specific and species-nonspecific. Human hepatic stimulator substance produced a two- to threefold increase of 3H-thymidine incorporation into hepatic DNA when injected intraperitoneally into growing weanling mice (nonhepatectomized) or regenerating rats (34% hepatectomy).

The arterial and portal venous resistance, oxygen consumption, liver weight and bile flow were investigated. The drugs used were as follows: nonspecific alpha-adrenergic antagonists (DH-ergocristine, dibenamine, phenoxybenzamine), vasodilators with a direct miscellaneous action (theophylline, papaverine, dipyridamole, glucagon, Aiu-cor by Instituto Gentilli, Italy [inosine, ATP, IPI, UTP]) and antispasmodics (piperylone, tropenziline, noraminophenazone). Adrenaline increased arterial and portal venous resistance followed by a diminution of oxygen consumption, liver weight and bile flow. alpha-Adrenergic antagonists inhibited the effects of adrenaline on portal venous resistance and oxygen consumption and especially the effects on hepatic arterial resistance. The most potent agent was phenoxybenzamine. In contrast to alpha-adrenoceptor blockade, the effects of other vasoactive agents were without a sustained influence on hepatic arterial resistance (excepting those of glucagon and dipyridamole). Some of them were effective as antagonists on responses in the portal venous bed (papaverine, Aiu-cor). Moreover, there were drugs exerting an enhancement of the vasoconstrictor responses of hepatic artery to low concentrations of adrenaline with no effect on the portal venous bed (piperylone, tropenziline). Theophylline and noraminophenazone exerted no effect either on the arterial or portal venous bed. No vasodilator agent antagonized the changes of the bile flow after adrenaline administration.\r"

  ".W": "The pathogenesis of portal hypertension arising in patients with myeloproliferative disorders has been difficult to understand because liver biopsy findings often show minimal changes. It has been suggested that increased splenic blood flow, hepatic infiltration with hematopoietic cells or sinusoidal fibrosis may be important. We have reviewed the autopsy findings and clinical histories of 97 patients with polycythemia vera and 48 patients with agnogenic myeloid metaplasia collected from three institutions and from the Polycythemia Vera Study Group. Cirrhosis was present in seven patients, one of whom had bleeding varices. Esophageal varices were present clinically in 10 patients without cirrhosis (seven polycythemia and three agnogenic myeloid metaplasia). All of these patients had lesions in small or medium-sized portal veins and four had stenosis of the extrahepatic portal vein with histology compatible with organized thrombi. Nodular regenerative hyperplasia occurred in 14.6% and correlated closely with the presence of portal vein lesions. Thirty patients had greater than 500 ml of ascites, seven of these patients also had varices and six of them had hepatic vein thrombosis. Ascites also correlated with hepatic vein disease confined to small intrahepatic branches. No correlation was seen between hepatic hematopoietic infiltration and signs of portal hypertension. We conclude that esophageal varices are common and are almost always associated with portal vein lesions visible by light microscopy. These portal vein lesions, and the secondary effects of nodular regenerative hyperplasia and portal hypertension, are most likely a result of portal vein thrombosis in patients with myeloproliferative disorders.\r"

The plasma L-alanine aminotransferase (ALT, E.C. 2.6.1.2) or L-aspartate aminotransferase (AST, E.C. 2.6.1.1) activities at this point reached more than 2,000 IU/L. However, overt hepatic injury as evaluated by the plasma aminotransferase activities did not develop in mice in which only lipopolysaccharide or only D-galactosamine was injected. No tumor necrosis factor-like activities could be detected in the plasma of galactosamine- and lipopolysaccharide-injected mice as determined by the assay of cytotoxicity to highly tumor necrosis factor-sensitive L-P3 cells through the experimental period of 24 hr. However, passive immunization against mouse tumor necrosis factor-alpha with polyvalent rabbit anti-mouse tumor necrosis factor-alpha antiserum, which was able to neutralize the cytotoxic effects of recombinant mouse tumor necrosis factor-alpha on L-P3 cells, could protect the mice from the development of hepatic injury in a dose-dependent manner. Simultaneous injection of recombinant human tumor necrosis factor-alpha, instead of lipopolysaccharide, with 800 mg/kg of D-galactosamine in lipopolysaccharide-resistant C3H/HeJ mice sensitized the animals more than one thousand-fold to the development of hepatic injury.

  ".W": "In previous experiments in rats, we have shown that the rapid plasma clearance of a number of clinically important enzymes is due to receptor-mediated endocytosis by Kupffer cells and other resident macrophages. Others have shown that infection of mice with lactate dehydrogenase-elevating virus, a virus that proliferates in macrophages, leads to reduced plasma elimination of these enzymes. This paper integrates these two sets of experiments. Plasma elimination of intravenously injected, radioactively labeled lactate dehydrogenase M4 and mitochondrial malate dehydrogenase in mice was shown to be caused in part by uptake in liver, spleen and bone. Uptake of lactate dehydrogenase M4 by these tissues was, to a large extent, saturable and the two dehydrogenases competitively inhibited each other's clearance. These results suggest that, also in mice, these enzymes are partly cleared from plasma by endocytosis by way of a common receptor on cells (probably macrophages) from liver, spleen and bone marrow. Morphometrical data showed that normal mouse liver contains 23 x 10(6) Kupffer cells/cm3. This number was reduced to about 30% of that of controls 24 hr after infection of mice with lactate dehydrogenase-elevating virus but returned to normal within the next 9 days. The saturable component of uptake of lactate dehydrogenase M4 by liver, spleen and bone had disappeared 24 hr after infection with the virus, and did not return after the Kupffer cell population had recovered. Our findings suggest that lactate dehydrogenase M4 is, to a large extent, removed from the circulation by way of a receptor on a subpopulation of macrophages that is permissive for replication of lactate dehydrogenase-elevating virus.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration was decreased compared with controls in only one of nine patients, but serum 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D concentrations were diminished in seven of nine subjects. In all subjects, dietary calcium and phosphorus intakes were greater than 80% of the RDA. Fractional absorption of calcium, determined by oral and intravenous administration of stable calcium isotopes, was similar in cholestatic compared with control subjects (37.1% +/- 12.5% vs. 34.0% +/- 16.4%). In the cholestatic subjects, calcium absorption correlated with serum 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (r = 0.871, p less than 0.002) but not 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations. Calcium balance, assessed by the duplicate diet method, was positive in four of five subjects. Anthropometric measurements were performed to examine the relationship between nutritional status and bone mineral content. Heights of all subjects were less than or equal to the 10th percentile and fat stores and somatic protein stores were less than the 25th percentile in six of nine subjects. We conclude that factors other than calcium malabsorption and decreased serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration contribute to diminished bone mass in children with cholestatic liver disease.\r"

Subjects received placebo or 13 to 15 mg/kg/day ursodeoxycholic acid for 5 wk. In the placebo group (n = 7) there was no change in the composition of serum bile acids or in the mean percentage of retention of tauro 23(75Se) selena-25 homotaurocholic acid (36.1% +/- 6.0% vs. 38.7% +/- 6.7%). In contrast, in the ursodeoxycholic acid group, serum ursodeoxycholic acid conjugates increased and the percentage of retention of tauro 23 (75Se) selena-25 homotaurocholic acid fell from 45.8% +/- 6.8% to 20.5% +/- 5.7% (p less than 0.01). We conclude that ursodeoxycholic acid administration reduces ileal absorption of endogenous bile acids. These findings provide a rational explanation for the changes in the composition of the bile acid pool during ursodeoxycholic acid therapy and could have important therapeutic implications.\r"

  ".W": "Feedback regulation of bile acid synthesis by its end products was studied in cultured hepatocytes of young weaned pigs. We previously showed that conversion of exogenous [14C] cholesterol into bile acids was suppressed by addition of bile acids to the culture medium. In the present study, the effects of bile acids on bile acid mass production and cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase activity were examined. Mass production of bile acids was strongly inhibited by addition of taurocholic acid (50 and 100 mumol/L) to the culture medium. The inhibitory action was exerted specifically on activity of cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase because conversion of [14C] 7 alpha-hydroxycholesterol to bile acids by pig hepatocytes was not affected. Suppression of cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase activity after incubation of the hepatocytes with taurocholic acid was concentration- and time-dependent. Maximum suppression (-80%) was achieved after a 20 to 30 hr incubation of hepatocytes with 100 mumol/L of this bile acid. Decline of enzyme activity caused by 100 mumol/L taurocholic acid followed first-order kinetics with a half-life of 10 hr. Taurocholic acid had no direct effect on cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase activity in homogenates of hepatocytes as assessed by addition of the bile acid to the assay mixture. The effects of several other bile acids in a concentration of 100 mumol/L on cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase activity were examined in 48 hr incubations. Glycochenodeoxycholic and glycohyodeoxycholic acids, which are the major bile acids in pig bile, their unconjugated forms and also deoxycholic and cholic acid pronouncedly inhibited activity of the enzyme.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The simultaneous infusion of tauroursodeoxycholate and taurochenodeoxycholate (0.6 and 0.4 mumol.min-1.100 gm-1, respectively) for 2 hr prevented the marked biochemical changes in the bile induced by taurochenodeoxycholate for 15 to 60 min exhibited significantly more necrotic hepatocytes, especially in zone 1, in comparison with animals infused with tauroursodeoxycholate or a combination of taurochenodeoxycholate and tauroursodeoxycholate. A good correlation was observed between biochemical and morphological indices of bile acid-induced hepatocyte injury. These data suggest that (a) primary events induced by the acute infusion of toxic bile salts responsible for cholestasis include zone 1 hepatocellular necrosis and (b) this can be prevented by the simultaneous infusion of tauroursodeoxycholate.\r"

  ".W": "Biliary lipid metabolism was studied after 10 liver transplantations with continuous drainage of bile. Within 3 wk after transplantation, the new liver produced bile with concentrations of biliary lipids in agreement with those reported for T-tube bile in cholecystectolized nontransplanted subjects. Although changes in biliary lipid composition occurred swiftly in response to various forms of disturbed liver function, they did not provide substantially more information than did standard serum tests or simple measurements of bile flow in most patients. Secretion rates of phospholipids and cholesterol were found to be completely bile acid dependent. For each micromole of bile acids, 0.22 and 0.08 mumol of phospholipids and cholesterol were secreted, respectively. When bile flow was related to bile acid output, a linear relationship was found (r = 0.89), with a positive intercept indicating a bile acid-independent bile flow of approximately 44 microliters/min. Analysis of individual bile acids showed almost exclusively primary bile acids. The relative proportion of chenodeoxycholic acid was more prominent during the first days after transplantation. Different explanations for this are discussed.\r"

In this report, we surveyed necroinflammatory and cystic changes of the peribiliary glands in 1,000 consecutive autopsy livers because these two changes coexisted frequently in the same liver. The necroinflammatory change was found in 228 livers (22.8%) and the cystic change in 202 livers (20.2%), and 103 cases showed both changes in the same liver. The necroinflammatory change was frequently found in intrahepatic cholangitis and extrahepatic biliary obstruction with bacterial infection, suggesting that biliary bacterial inflammation extends into these peribilary glands. This change was also frequent in systemic infection or septicemia without biliary bacterial infection, implying that the peribiliary glands were also damaged in such conditions without direct infection. The cystic change was frequent in livers with portal hypertension or obstruction, adult polycystic disease and necroinflammation of the glands, suggesting that the cystic change of the glands could occur as the result of the disturbance of intrahepatic circulation or as the result of inflammatory destruction of the glandular conduits. Some of peribiliary cysts may be of congenital origin. Dysfunction related to these pathological changes in the glands may diminish seromucous secretion and cause alterations in hepatic bile composition. The cystic change of the glands may retard bile flow by compressing bile duct lumina.\r"

But new circumstances are having an impact on the industry: Profits are no longer pouring in, and decision-makers are adjusting their strategies in response. Hospitals are discovering that they must closely monitor their radiology departments' financial performance to compete effectively in this tougher environment. At the same time, they're developing new business arrangements to help claim and protect their share of the medical imaging market. Meanwhile, clinical researchers are expanding the boundaries of imaging technology, leading to competition among modalities for market share. Changed technology and new financial considerations are combining to make hospitals' medical imaging investment decisions increasingly complex.\r"

  ".U": "91034059\r", 
  ".W": "Nitric oxide first captured the interest of biologists when this inorganic molecule was found to activate cytosolic guanylate cyclase and stimulate cyclic guanosine monophosphate (GMP) formation in mammalian cells. Further studies led to the finding that nitric oxide causes vascular smooth muscle relaxation and inhibition of platelet aggregation by mechanisms involving cyclic GMP and that several clinically used nitrovasodilators owe their biological actions to nitric oxide. Nitric oxide possesses physicochemical and pharmacological properties that make it an ideal candidate for a short-term regulator or modulator of vascular smooth muscle tone and platelet function. Nitric oxide is synthesized by various mammalian tissues including vascular endothelium, macrophages, neutrophils, hepatic Kupffer cells, adrenal tissue, cerebellum, and other tissues. Nitric oxide is synthesized from endogenous L-arginine by a nitric oxide synthase system that possesses different cofactor requirements in different cell types. The nitric oxide formed diffuses out of its cells of origin and into nearby target cells, where it binds to the heme group of cytosolic guanylate cyclase and thereby causes enzyme activation. This interaction represents a novel and widespread signal transduction mechanism that links extracellular stimuli to the biosynthesis of cyclic GMP in nearby target cells. The small molecular size and lipophilic nature of nitric oxide enable communication with nearby cells containing cytosolic guanylate cyclase. The extent of transcellular communication is limited by the short half-life of nitric oxide, thereby ensuring a localized response. Labile nitric oxide-generating molecules such as S-nitrosothiols may be involved as precursors or effectors. Further research will provide a deeper understanding of the biology of nitric oxide and the nature of associated pathophysiological states.\r"

  ".W": "The relation between intra-abdominal visceral fat accumulation and blood pressure was investigated in 67 obese women (mean body mass index, 33.6 +/- 3.1; average age, 50 +/- 11 years). As an index of intra-abdominal fat accumulation, the ratio of the intra-abdominal visceral fat area to subcutaneous fat area was determined using a computed tomographic section at the level of the umbilicus. When the obese subjects were divided into a hypertensive group and a normotensive group, the ratio of the intra-abdominal visceral fat area to subcutaneous fat area in the hypertensive group was significantly higher (0.53 +/- 0.33 versus 0.29 +/- 0.12, p less than 0.01). Significant correlations between the ratio of intra-abdominal visceral fat area to subcutaneous fat area and systolic blood pressure (r = 0.62, p less than 0.001) and diastolic blood pressure (r = 0.53, p less than 0.001) also were found. However, no significant difference existed in either the body mass index or the waist-to-hip circumference ratio between the hypertensive and normotensive groups. Plasma renin activity, aldosterone, epinephrine, and norepinephrine levels were not significantly different between the two groups. Moreover, the correlation between the ratio of the intra-abdominal visceral fat area to subcutaneous fat area ratio and blood pressure was found independent of age and body mass index by multiple regression analyses. We conclude that intra-abdominal fat accumulation itself may play an important role in the pathogenesis of hypertension in obesity.\r"

Whether this reflects a hyperreactivity to blood pressure measurement or a more permanent blood pressure elevation, however, is not known. In the present study, blood pressure was measured in 15 normotensive subjects whose parents are both hypertensive (FH++), 15 normotensive subjects with one hypertensive parent (FH(+)-), and 15 normotensive subjects whose parents are not hypertensive (FH--); among the three groups, subjects were matched for age, sex, and body mass index. The measurements were made in the office during a variety of laboratory stressors and during a prolonged resting period, and for a 24-hour period (ambulatory blood pressure monitoring). Office blood pressure was higher in the FH++ group than in the FH-- group (p less than 0.05). The pressor responses to laboratory stressors were similar in the two groups, but the FH++ group had higher prolonged resting and 24-hour blood pressure than the FH-- group; the difference was always significant (p less than 0.05) for systolic blood pressure. The FH++ group also had a greater left ventricular mass index (on echocardiographic examination) than the FH-- group (p less than 0.01). The blood pressure values and echocardiographic values of the FH(+)- group tended to be between those of the other two groups. Thus, the higher blood pressure shown by individuals in the prehypertensive stage with a family history of parental hypertension does not reflect a hyperreactivity to stress but an early permanent blood pressure elevation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The relations of systolic and diastolic blood pressures to alcohol intake and exercise tolerance levels in 15,612 men and 3,855 women were investigated. Alcohol intake was assessed by questionnaire and stratified into seven levels for men and six for women according to the ounces of ethanol consumed per week. Exercise tolerance was determined by maximal treadmill exercise testing and was categorized into six age-specific by sex-specific levels. Both systolic and diastolic blood pressure were significantly related to both alcohol intake and exercise tolerance levels in both men and women. These relations, which were positive for alcohol and negative for exercise tolerance, remained after covariance adjustment for age, body mass index, and cigarette smoking. Alcohol intake was not significantly correlated with exercise tolerance. The relation of blood pressure to alcohol was not linear because the blood pressure of moderate consumers of alcohol tended to be slightly lower than that of nondrinkers. Higher blood pressure was found only in drinkers whose ethanol intake exceeded 9.5 ounces (approximately 285 ml or 19 drinks) per week. However, heavy drinkers in high exercise tolerance categories had no higher blood pressure than nondrinkers in low exercise tolerance groups. Exercise tolerance or physiological fitness appears to be important in quantifying the relation between alcohol intake and blood pressure and should be considered in describing this relation.\r"

  ".W": "The present study was designed to investigate the role of abnormalities in red blood cell sodium-potassium-chloride (Na-K-Cl) cotransport and Na+ pump as predictors of the pressor response to chronic oral Na+ loading in young whites and blacks. Subjects were healthy adults from 18 to 23 years of age and included normotensive whites (n = 24) and normotensive blacks (n = 35). Red blood cell transport studies were performed before Na+ loading. The Na+ load consisted of 10 g NaCl daily added to the usual diet. A sodium-sensitive response was defined as an increase of 5 mm Hg or more in mean arterial pressure after the Na+ load; a sodium-insensitive response was a less than 5 mm Hg increase in mean arterial pressure. A sodium-sensitive response occurred in 16% of whites and 57% of blacks. Black subjects have a significantly lower (p less than 0.005) maximal rate of furosemide-sensitive Na+ efflux and a higher Km for cellular Na+ (p less than 0.05) to activate Na-K-Cl cotransport than white subjects. Normotensive blacks with sodium-sensitive blood pressure response had a higher Km (14.4 +/- 6 mmol/l cell, n = 17, mean +/- SD) to activate the cotransport than sodium-insensitive blacks (9.9 +/- 3.7 mmol/l cell, n = 13, p less than 0.001). Normotensive whites had a significantly lower red blood cell Na+ content (p less than 0.05) and a higher maximal rate of cotransport (p less than 0.005) than young normotensive blacks.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Plasma ionized calcium, platelet cytosolic calcium (using the fura-2 method in gel-filtered platelets), parathyroid hormone (both the intact hormone and a midmolecule portion), calcitriol, and calcidiol were measured in 19 untreated male patients with essential hypertension and 19 age-matched normotensive male research subjects. Mean levels of platelet cytosolic calcium, parathyroid hormone, calcitriol, and calcidiol were all significantly higher, whereas plasma ionized calcium was significantly lower, in the hypertensive group compared with the normotensive group. Both platelet cytosolic calcium and intact parathyroid hormone were positively correlated with mean arterial pressure (r = 0.58, p less than 0.001; r = 0.54, p less than 0.001, respectively), whereas plasma ionized calcium was inversely correlated with mean arterial pressure (r = -0.60, p less than 0.001) in the combined group of all study subjects. All three of these correlations were significant in the hypertensive group alone but not in the normotensive group alone. When analyzed with plasma ionized calcium, body mass index, serum calcitriol, and calcidiol in a multivariable regression model, the significance of the partial regressions of platelet cytosolic calcium and parathyroid hormone with mean arterial pressure persisted. Intact parathyroid hormone was positively correlated to platelet cytosolic calcium (r = 0.43, p less than 0.01) and plasma ionized calcium was inversely correlated to platelet cytosolic calcium (r = -0.44, p less than 0.01). These results confirm previous reports of disturbances of calcium metabolism in essential hypertension and suggest that the elevated platelet cytosolic calcium observed in essential hypertension may be linked to one or more of these alterations of calcium metabolism.\r"

  ".W": "The hypothesis that 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 [1,25-(OH)2 vitamin D3] modulates vascular smooth muscle contractile function was tested. 1,25-(OH)2 vitamin D3 (50 ng/day) was administered by intraperitoneal injection over a 3-day period to 13-15-week-old male spontaneously hypertensive and Wistar-Kyoto normotensive rats. On the fourth day, serum was prepared and contractile force generation of isolated mesenteric resistance arteries was examined. Treatment with 1,25-(OH)2 vitamin D3 approximately doubled serum levels of the hormone and increased ionized and total serum Ca2+ and phosphate by 5-10%. No effect on blood pressure was detected. 1,25-(OH)2 vitamin D3 injection in both strains enhanced maximal stress generation to norepinephrine and serotonin by 30-40%, with no effect on apparent sensitivity of the vessels to the agonists. To assess the effect of a maneuver that elevates serum ionized Ca2+ without the addition of exogenous hormone, maximal stress generation was examined in resistance arteries isolated from rats fed diets containing 0.5% or 2% calcium over a 6-7-week period. Maximal stress generation in response to norepinephrine was greater in vessels from rats of both strains maintained on 0.5% calcium. It is concluded that 72-hour in vivo treatment with 1,25-(OH)2 vitamin D3 increases contractile force-generating capacity of resistance arteries without affecting blood pressure. It is proposed that this action of 1,25-(OH)2 vitamin D3 is the result of a direct action of the hormone on the vascular wall.\r"

  ".W": "The function of the endothelium is impaired in hypertension. In spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR), acetylcholine-induced relaxation is decreased and serotonin-induced constriction is increased. The goal of our study was to evaluate the effect of a long-term treatment with cilazapril, a new angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, or hydralazine, a vasodilator, on the endothelium-dependent responses in aorta of SHR. Wistar-Kyoto rats were used as normotensive reference. Isolated aortic rings with or without endothelium were suspended in organ chambers. The rings with intact endothelium were contracted with norepinephrine. Acetylcholine-induced relaxation was markedly enhanced by cilazapril treatment. The tension achieved at maximal relaxation was 8 +/- 4% of norepinephrine contraction in the cilazapril-treated SHR versus 55 +/- 5% in the untreated SHR (p less than 0.001). Hydralazine had no significant effect. The effect of serotonin was also markedly modified by cilazapril. In untreated SHR, serotonin induced the release of a vasoconstrictor substance by the endothelium as assessed by the ratio of maximal tension induced by serotonin in rings with endothelium over maximal tension in rings without endothelium, which was greater than 1. This ratio was reversed in cilazapril-treated SHR but not in hydralazine-treated SHR. Captopril had effects similar to cilazapril. Finally, evaluation of carotid arteries showed that cilazapril also prevented morphological changes of the intima in SHR (i.e., infiltration by mononuclear cells). We conclude that angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors prevent the functional and morphological alterations in endothelium that are found in hypertension and speculate that this action might participate in their antihypertensive effect.\r"

  ".W": "Rats of the spontaneously hypertensive strain develop kidney damage that resembles the nephropathy seen in some cases of human essential hypertension. Previous studies with a triple drug antihypertensive regimen indicated that proteinuria and glomerular histopathology in spontaneously hypertensive rats might develop despite long-term effective control of systemic blood pressure. To investigate further the relation between hypertension and kidney disease, a group of spontaneously hypertensive rats were treated with enalapril at 15 weeks of age. Blood pressure, protein excretion, and kidney function were measured in those rats at regular intervals during the next year and a half and were compared with untreated spontaneously hypertensive rats and the normotensive Wistar-Kyoto parent strain. Kidney tissue samples from all three groups, collected at autopsy, were stained by immunohistochemical and conventional methods to assess the relative severity and nature of kidney damage. Although enalapril therapy was completely effective in controlling the blood pressure of spontaneously hypertensive rats, it only postponed the onset of kidney disease. Enalapril-treated spontaneously hypertensive rats eventually exhibited albuminuria as severe as that found in hypertensive rats. Kidney vessel pathology was completely prevented with enalapril, but the abnormal accumulation of mononuclear cells in tubulointerstitial and periglomerular sites was the same as in untreated spontaneously hypertensive rats. We have concluded that elevated protein excretion in rats of the spontaneously hypertensive rat strain is not a secondary consequence of systemic hypertension. Structural abnormalities of renal vessels also do not appear to contribute significantly to the pathogenesis of albuminuria in spontaneously hypertensive rats. Other explanations must be sought to account for the close link between spontaneous hypertension and kidney damage in this animal model. The clear dissociation of kidney disease from systemic hypertension exhibited by spontaneously hypertensive rats may also be relevant for human disease.\r"

Results demonstrated that 80% of angiotensin I delivered by the renal artery was extracted both by the affected and the unaffected kidney and that on both sides a major part of angiotensin I in the renal vein was derived from intrarenal de novo production. Production of plasma angiotensin I was in excess over extraction (p less than 0.01) on the affected side, whereas extraction was in excess over production (p less than 0.01) on the contralateral side. The plasma level of de novo intrarenally produced angiotensin I in the renal vein was seven times higher on the affected side than the contralateral side. This difference was by far too big to be explained by a difference in the transit time of blood between the two kidneys, by an augmented production of angiotensin I in the circulating blood passing through the affected kidney due to the higher level of venous plasma renin activity in that kidney, or by the combination of both.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The reaction of the renin-angiotensin system to acute angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition was investigated in a single-blind, crossover study in nine normal volunteers receiving two out of three regimens in random order: the new converting enzyme inhibitor benazepril (20 mg once or 5 mg four times at 6-hour intervals) or enalapril (20 mg). Plasma converting enzyme activity, drug levels, angiotensin I and angiotensin II, active renin, and aldosterone were measured before and 1-4 hours and 14-30 hours after drug intake. Baseline in vitro plasma converting enzyme activity was 97 +/- 15 nmol/ml/min (mean +/- SD) when Hip-Gly-Gly was used as substrate, but with carbobenzoxy-Phe-His-Leu (Z-Phe-His-Leu) or angiotensin I as substrate it was only 20 +/- 4 and 1.7 +/- 0.3 nmol/ml/min, respectively. Discriminating power at peak converting enzyme inhibition was enhanced with the two latter substrates. In vivo converting enzyme activity was estimated by the plasma angiotensin II/angiotensin I ratio, which correlated well with in vitro converting enzyme activity using Z-Phe-His-Leu as substrate (r = 0.76, n = 252). Angiotensin II levels returned to baseline less than 24 hours after drug administration, whereas in vitro and in vivo converting enzyme activity remained considerably inhibited and active renin together with angiotensin I levels were still elevated. A close linear relation was found between plasma angiotensin II and the angiotensin I/drug level ratio (r = 0.91 for benazeprilat and r = 0.88 for enalaprilat, p less than 0.001). Thus, plasma angiotensin II truly reflects the resetting of the renin-angiotensin system at any degree of converting enzyme inhibition. The ratio of plasma angiotensin II to angiotensin I represents converting enzyme inhibition more accurately than in vitro assays, which vary considerably depending on substrates and assay conditions used.\r"

Blockade of one of these mechanisms may lead to compensatory stimulation of the others, thus offsetting in part the hemodynamic benefits of a specific intervention. Combination therapy, designed to attack all three systems (with use of an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, a sympathetic blocker such as clonidine, and an antagonist of the vasopressor action of vasopressin), may help in the treatment of such cases. To illustrate this strategy, two experimental studies, one case of malignant hypertension, and one case of congestive heart failure are presented.\r"

Uremic patients also benefit from substitution of desmopressin for cryoprecipitate to control bleeding. The highly variable response to desmopressin by individual patients with hemophilia or von Willebrand disease dictates that each patient receive a trial administration prior to surgery; surgery should proceed only following verification of a therapeutically effective increase in Factor VIII and vWF after desmopressin. Use of desmopressin in patients with normal baseline hemostatic function is not clearly advantageous, although certain patient subgroups might benefit, and prospective studies have documented the drug's safety in these cases. Data are lacking to clarify a role for desmopressin during surgery in patients taking aspirin. Antifibrinolytic therapy appears to decrease bleeding without increased risk after cardiac surgery. In addition, specific use after urological surgery may be beneficial in the absence of upper urinary tract bleeding. In the last ten years, other applications for antifibrinolytic therapy have been found--both surgical (intracranial aneurysms, oral and lacrimal surgery) and nonsurgical (in cancer patients and for gastrointestinal bleeding). Although anecdotal reports have fueled fears of increased thrombosis with antifibrinolytics, controlled studies indicate no increased risk.\r"

The increase in T1 relaxation times, together with earlier reported changes observed with localized magnetic resonance spectroscopy, indicate an alteration in cellular composition of the hemopoietic bone marrow with an increase in the amount of hemopoietic active tissue.

The water delivered to individual dialysis stations had only occasional positive bacterial cultures (3 of 21 samples before completion of construction, 2 of 16 samples afterwards) and intermittent detection of endotoxin (6 of 21 samples before completion of construction, 9 of 16 samples afterwards) at monthly sampling. Among 51 individual dialysis treatments (25 patients) before reconstruction and 56 treatments (29 patients), after, only 2 and 3 febrile events were identified, respectively. All of these were associated with underlying infectious illness and not with the hemodialysis procedure itself. Overall, we conclude that pyrogenic episodes associated directly with hemodialysis treatment are infrequent, and that the addition of a water storage tank with iodination treatment does not appear to increase the risk of bacteremia or pyrogenic episodes.\r"

More platelet derangement and an increased degree of hemolysis, revealed by higher plasmatic concentration of beta-thromboglobulin, platelet factor 4 and plasmatic free hemoglobin (p less than 0.05), was seen when using the bubble oxygenator. Damage to blood cells was minimal with the membrane oxygenator while the 'hybrid' and the hollow fibre oxygenators proved to rank at an intermediate level. Complement activation at the beginning of the cardiopulmonary bypass occurred via the alternative pathway as demonstrated by C3ades arg increase (up to nine times) without a concomitant elevation of C4ades arg. Cardiopulmonary bypass complement activation was quantitatively similar with all the oxygenators. A further activation via the classical pathway occurred in all the patients after protamine injection. Consistent differences as far as clinical and biological effects exist among the various commercially available cardiopulmonary bypass apparatus; our study provides guidelines for the evaluation and selection of devices which might reduce postoperative sequelae.\r"

In vitro, the ventricle produced a cardiac output of 2.5 to 3.0 L/min and showed reliable durability results. Hematological testing showed no important thrombogenicity of the new valve. Cardiac output was higher than expected for the volume of the ventricle, perhaps because of stretching or flow through. Animal experiments with the left ventricular assist device (LVAD) version was done at Ohio State University. Earlier in Utah, we did 20 cc total artificial heart (TAH) implantations and LVAD experiments in lambs and recently in calves with the 60cc TAH version. A soft ventricle is easy to implant and low in production costs.\r"

Factor X, fibrinogen, plasminogen, antithrombin III, and antiplasmin were followed at 24 and 72 hours after infusion. Compared with saline infused rats PT and PTT did not change significantly in those rats infused with Hb preparations. There was a transient increase of PTT from 2 to 24 hours after infusion in albumin infused rats. Factor X, fibrinogen, antithrombin III and antiplasmin showed no significant differences between Hb infused groups and saline infused group. Twenty-four hours and 72 hours after infusion plasminogen decreased in all groups except the albumin infused rats at 24 hours after infusion when compared with normal rat plasma pool. However, there were no significant differences in plasminogen levels between the hemoglobin infused groups and the control saline group. Stroma-free and polyHb solutions (rSFH, hSFH, rPoly and hPoly) did not cause significant changes in prothrombin time and activated partial thromboplastin time in rats. The rats infused with hemoglobin solutions (rSFH, hSFH, rPoly, and hPoly) did not show significant differences in Factor X, fibrinogen, antithrombin III and antiplasmin levels compared with the control group.\r"

One test, the \"fluid medium assay\" was modified by using small pieces of graft glued to a screening lid, thereby reducing the possibility of mechanical injury to cultured cells by free fragments of the tested biomaterial. Another test, the \"cell inhibition assay\" was modified in that the biomaterial to be tested was ground into small pieces while at very low temperature. The measure of cell toxicity used was the effect on DNA replication. Our results suggest that these modified assay methods can be used to evaluate the biocompatibility of biomaterials.\r"

Our purpose was to study the incidence and other epidemiological features of patients suffering from severe migraine exacerbations, in an unselected population. The 64 patients who suffered from severe migraine bouts represented 10.5% of all the new walk-in neurological consultations in the area covered in this study. 70% of these patients were between 10 and 39 years old. Although females clearly predominated in all ages after fifteen, below this age there was a slight male predominance. The calculated incidence of serious migraine exacerbations was 90 per 100,000 people per year, the corrected incidence for females being 143/100,000 and for males 37/100,000. The highest incidence for females was in 15-19 year-olds (377/100,000) and for males in 10-14 year-olds (166/100,000). Our data seem to confirm the periodic nature of this condition since in 80% of patients the migraine bouts (ie: groups of attacks) lasted between two and nine months. Also they support the reported existence of genetic and hormonal factors in the susceptibility to migraine exacerbations. Our results may help in planning the public health aspect of migraine and add some light to the natural history of this common condition.\r"

A 32-year-old male developed a pulsating headache accompanied by nausea while swimming in the sea. In all three cases, blood pressure, pulse rate, neurological findings, cervical spinal x-rays, brain CT scans, and hematological findings were normal and the outcome was good.

Neither a number of other medical conditions nor the use of several medications appeared to significantly influence our results.

These patients fulfilled the diagnostic criteria of the IHS Headache Classification for headaches induced by chronic substance abuse (8.2) and analgesics abuse headache (8.2.2). These patients took between 150 and 420 BAC/month for 2-15 years. Two patients had previously undergone inpatient detoxification. One patient unsuccessfully tried detoxification twice as an outpatient. All patients were required to have psychological support prior to hospitalization for this protocol. BAC was discontinued. A pentobarbital challenge test corroborated butalbital dosage. The patients were given phenobarbital and caffeine which were tapered over several days. Dihydroergotamine (DHE) with metoclopramide was used (Raskin). Propranolol 60 mg bid was started. No narcotics were permitted. After hospital discharge, patients were allowed to continue subcutaneous DHE, as needed. One patient restarted BAC use after 8 months without it. The other two patients were still BAC free 18 and 14 months after detoxification.\r"

Thermographic records were taken in 10 healthy subjects and 47 patients suffering from craniofacial pain or headache of different kinds. In the patients with painful episodes the record was taken between attacks. In all the normal subjects and in 19 patients lateral thermograms were also taken during and after maximal tooth clenching for three minutes. The majority of the patients, as compared to the normal group, showed some thermal alterations and asymmetry. Such alterations seem to be due both to vascular instability and muscle contraction: these two factors may be variably superimposed in the different conditions. In patients with cluster headache or chronic paroxysmal hemicrania the presence on the symptomatic side of a cold spot along the supraorbital area and/or the inner orbital canthus, was a constant finding. We conclude that thermography is useful as an additional diagnostic means in patients with head and face pain, and that the clenching test may increase the amount of information provided.\r"

In one of these seven patients, facial flushing and ocular sympathetic deficit was observed on the original side of headaches. In most patients, the orbital region was warmer on the painful side but in three cases this region was cooler during and between attacks. Lacrimation and rhinorrhoea were more common in severe attacks, and the temperature difference between the orbits increased with increasing severity of pain. These findings support the view that certain autonomic disturbances in cluster headache are provoked by pain. Residual autonomic dysfunction could influence autonomic activity during cluster headache. If so, residual dysfunction on the pain-free side could explain the dissociation between autonomic disturbances and pain observed in a few cases.\r"

Peak admissions were found to occur most frequently in the spring for females in comparison to males (p less than or equal to 0.04, chi-square). The implications of these findings are discussed.\r"

  ".W": "Eighty-one patients were diagnosed as having migraine, tension headache or both according to previously used criteria. Then we performed a standardized interview to determine the frequency and severity of headache characteristics used in the new operational diagnostic criteria of the International Headache Society (IHS). In every patient the original diagnosis fulfilled also the IHS criteria, but in 9 patients the criteria were only fulfilled in half or less of the attacks, and applying the IHS criteria they also achieved an additional diagnosis. In one patient these attacks did not fulfill the pain criteria and in 8 (4 migraine, 4 tension headache) they did not fulfill the criteria for accompanying symptoms. Overall the IHS criteria are sensitive and specific, but they may possibly be improved with regard to accompanying symptoms. The present study suggests that recording of frequency and graded severity of characteristics using a headache diary may further improve the distinction between the different types of headache.\r"

Catheter patency was maintained by a saline and heparin infusate. Venipuncture samples for Na+ and glucose served as controls. A sample containing the dwell volume of the catheter and the stopcock (1 ml) was withdrawn and discarded, followed by fifteen 1 ml samples being taken for analysis. It was concluded that Na+ values are stable after discard of the catheter dwell volume and an additional milliliter of blood. Minimal clinical differences were found in the glucose values after discard of the catheter dwell volume and two additional milliliters of blood.\r"

The sample included 60 professional nurses whose experience ranged from 1 to 26 years. A statistically significant difference was found in nurses' ability to control PIP successfully when manometers were used as compared with when they were not used (t = 12.04, p = 0.001). Nurses with more experience tended to rely less on manometers to guide their manual ventilation techniques, but were also less accurate in controlling the delivery of PIP without the devices. We provide recommendations for clinical practice based on these findings.\r"

In this report we describe the hemodynamic effects of breathing supplemental oxygen in a child with bronchopulmonary dysplasia and pulmonary artery hypertension. These hemodynamic effects include an improvement in oxygenation, an increase in systemic vascular resistance, and a decrease in the pulmonary vascular resistance. As a direct result of these changes in vascular resistances, alterations of heart rate, cardiac index, stroke volume, aortic pressure, oxygen consumption, and pulmonary artery pressure have been shown to occur. Oxygen is widely used to treat many physiologic conditions. However, during the administration of supplemental oxygen, rarely do we recognize the hemodynamic changes associated with its use. These hemodynamic effects must be clearly understood and appreciated before oxygen administration in any clinical situation.\r"

Results indicated that spouses perceived the pretransplant period to have a greater overall influence on their lives and relationships (p less than 0.001) than did the posttransplant period. Their impression of the posttransplant period was significantly more positive than of the pretransplant period (p less than 0.001).

Data consisted of 92 confederate pairs of Critical Care Family Needs Inventory responses obtained from 92 family members of adult patients hospitalized in a variety of ICUs and 49 ICU nurses providing direct care for these patients. Paired t tests (two tailed) were calculated to detect significant differences between confederate pairs of family members' perceptions and ICU nurses' assessments of the importance of the needs studied. Family members' perceptions and ICU nurses' assessments of the most and least important critical care family needs were identified. Significant (p less than 0.001 to p less than 0.05) differences were detected between confederate pairs of family members' perceptions and ICU nurses' assessments of the importance of 15 (50%) of the critical care family needs studied. Therefore, it appears that these nurses were only moderately accurate in their assessments of critical care family needs. Implications for nursing practice, education, and research were identified and discussed.\r"

Family members of hospitalized patients had significantly higher before-program anxiety scores than the other groups. This difference was not present immediately after the program or 2 months later. Family members of hospitalized patients showed a significant decline in anxiety over the three testing times. These outcomes support the benefit of teaching CPR to this group.\r"

No statistical difference was found between the subjects with SVT and those without SVT when sex, cross-clamp time, creatine kinase peak, hemoglobin and hematocrit levels, and number of bypasses were examined. Patients who had SVT were older than those who did not: 64.8 years for the SVT group versus 60.7 years for the non-SVT group (p less than 0.01). SVT was rare in the first 24 hours after surgery, whereas 60% of the cases occurred during the next 48 hours, without significant diurnal variation: mean time of onset was 11:50 AM. No particular activity of the patient or nurse influenced the onset of SVT during the postoperative period in this group.\r"

A significant pleural injury occurred during the bypass operation resulting in intrapleural hemorrhage, pleural fibrosis, and trapped-lung syndrome. The physicians caring for the patient when she was first seen with the trapped-lung syndrome were unaware of the potential relationship between the two prior bypass surgeries to this pulmonary complication. Recognition of the potential for pleural injury to occur after cardiac operations is important and may allow for earlier diagnosis and institution of appropriate therapeutic interventions. Early recognition and treatment with pleural fluid drainage and reexpansion of the collapsed lung may help prevent this potentially serious pleuropulmonary complication from occurring. In addition, the presentation of this pleuropulmonary complication may be delayed after the cardiac surgery, making early diagnosis more problematic.\r"

However, certain features unique to each of these diseases are helpful in clinical diagnosis. MS, unlike PML, is a disease of unknown cause. Polygenetic influences in combination with exposure to an environmental agent and immune-mediated factors may be operative in the pathogenesis of MS. Age of onset peaks in the third to fourth decades with a predominance in women, as contrasted with PML, which peaks in the fifth to sixth decades in most non-AIDS-associated cases with a slight predominance in men. MS is more prevalent in areas farther from the equator: North America, Europe, Australia, and New Zealand. Common initial symptoms seen in MS include bilateral limb weakness (with the legs being affected twice as often as the arms), hyperreflexia, spasticity, optic neuritis, diplopia, incoordination, and paresthesias. (Paresthesias are typically found in the lower limbs in a symmetric pattern, but may follow no obvious anatomic distribution and often do not correspond to the distribution of sensory symptoms. Vibration and position sense are more frequently disturbed than pain and temperature.) Intellectual impairment and mental deterioration are uncommon early in MS, whereas they are a more frequent initial presentation in PML. In addition, the presence of speech impairment and monoparesis or hemiparesis with homonymous hemianopsia is more suggestive of PML. Brain stem involvement is infrequent.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The overall scheme for control is as follows: central command sets basic patterns of cardiovascular effector activity, which is modulated via muscle chemo- and mechanoreflexes and arterial mechanoreflexes (baroreflexes) as appropriate error signals develop. A key question is whether the primary error corrected is a mismatch between blood flow and metabolism (a flow error that accumulates muscle metabolites that activate group III and IV chemosensitive muscle afferents) or a mismatch between cardiac output (CO) and vascular conductance [a blood pressure (BP) error] that activates the arterial baroreflex and raises BP. Reduction in muscle blood flow to a threshold for the muscle chemoreflex raises muscle metabolite concentration and reflexly raises BP by activating chemosensitive muscle afferents. In isometric exercise, sympathetic nervous activity (SNA) is increased mainly by muscle chemoreflex whereas central command raises heart rate (HR) and CO by vagal withdrawal. Cardiovascular control changes for dynamic exercise with large muscles. At exercise onset, central command increases HR by vagal withdrawal and \"resets\" the baroreflex to a higher BP. As long as vagal withdrawal can raise HR and CO rapidly so that BP rises quickly to its higher operating point, there is no mismatch between CO and vascular conductance (no BP error) and SNA does not increase. Increased SNA occurs at whatever HR (depending on species) exceeds the range of vagal withdrawal; the additional sympathetically mediated rise in CO needed to raise BP to its new operating point is slower and leads to a BP error. Sympathetic vasoconstriction is needed to complete the rise in BP. The baroreflex is essential for BP elevation at onset of exercise and for BP stabilization during mild exercise (subthreshold for chemoreflex), and it can oppose or magnify the chemoreflex when it is activated at higher work rates. Ultimately, when vascular conductance exceeds cardiac pumping capacity in the most severe exercise both chemoreflex and baroreflex must maintain BP by vasoconstricting active muscle.\r"

TSM tone was monitored by measuring the pressure in the saline-filled cuff of the endotracheal tube. Although, tracheal irritation caused TSM constriction in 10 of 14 patients, 4 patients showed no TSM response. Administration of intravenous atropine attenuated the TSM constriction response. Hypercapnia did not cause any change in TSM tone in any of the 14 patients. These results indicate that in paralyzed and anesthetized humans, there exist interindividual differences in the TSM responses to tracheal irritation and that hypercapnia cannot be an effective stimulus for the TSM constriction.\r"

  ".W": "To better understand the frog palate model of mucociliary transport, we measured the transport rate of mucus (MTR) from the leopard frog, Rana pipiens, and from the bullfrog, R. catesbeiana, recorded the stability of the MTR over a period of hours and days and over the course of 1 yr, and measured the viscoelasticity, percent solid composition, and spinnability (filance) of mucus from both species. Bullfrog mucus was less rigid than leopard frog mucus (log G* at 1 rad/s 2.09 vs. 2.61; P less than 0.01) and had a higher viscosity-to-elasticity ratio (tan delta at 1 rad/s 0.36 vs. 0.26; P less than 0.05). It also had a lower solids content (8.71 vs. 13.72%; P = 0.02), and there was a trend to lower spinnability for bullfrog mucus (filance 26.7 vs. 33.5 mm). These data suggest that bullfrog mucus has viscoelastic properties similar to normal mammalian respiratory mucus and leopard frog mucus has viscoelasticity similar to sputum samples. MTR was significantly slower in the winter than in the summer months (17 vs. 30 mm/min; P less than 0.0001). Although the leopard frog palate could be used for at least 7 consecutive days without exhaustion, bullfrog palates could be used for only 5 days. Palates of either species could generally be tested for 6 h/day without a significant decrease in MTR. These data clarify some of the sources of variability in the use of this system and suggest methods of standardization.\r"

In 12 subjects, ascending from 150 to 3,475 m, CBF was 24% increased at 24 h [45.1 to 55.9 initial slope index (ISI) units] and 4% increased at 6 days (47.1 ISI units). Four subjects had similar increases of CBF when ascending to 3,200 m 3 mo later, indicating the reproducibility of the measurements. In nine subjects, ascending from 3,200 to 4,785-5,430 m, CBF increased to 76.4 ISI units, 53% above estimated sea-level values. CBF and increases in CBF were similar in subjects with or without AMS. In six subjects, CBF was measured before and after therapeutic intervention. At 2 h CBF increased 22% (71.3 to 87.3 ISI units) above pretreatment values in three subjects given 1.5 g acetazolamide, while three subjects given placebo showed no change. Symptoms remained unaltered in all subjects during the 2 h of the study. Overall, the results indicated that increases in CBF were similar in subjects with or without AMS while acetazolamide-provoked increases of CBF in AMS subjects caused no acute change in symptoms. Alterations in CBF cannot be directly implicated in the pathogenesis of AMS.\r"

Ten male Long Evans rats (3 wk old) were trained to lift progressively heavier weights, which were secured to the rats' tails, while they ascended a 40-cm 90 degree mesh incline 20 times/day 5 days/wk for a food reward. After 8 wk of training, they lifted 406 +/- 19 (SD) g in addition to their body weight (261 +/- 9 g). Compared with 10 sedentary pair-fed rats, no hypertrophy of forelimb muscles (biceps brachii and brachialis) was observed, but rectus femoris wet and dry weights were greater (P less than 0.01) in the trained group. In the deep region of the rectus femoris, type I fiber area was similar between groups, but the trained rats had both a lower (P less than 0.05) percentage of type I fibers and a smaller (P less than 0.05) portion of the total area occupied by type I fibers. The percentage of type IIb fibers in the deep region of the rectus femoris was also similar between groups, but the portion of the deep area composed of type IIb fibers was greater (P less than 0.05) in the trained rats. In the superficial region of the rectus femoris, the trained rats' type IIb fibers were larger (P less than 0.01) and occupied a greater (P less than 0.05) portion of the superficial muscle area.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

A capsule was glued to the exposed parietal pleura after the intercostal muscles were removed. The capsule was filled with either autologous plasma or isotonic saline. Transpleural fluid flow (V) was measured at several transpleural hydrostatic pressures (delta P) from the rate of meniscus movement within a graduated pipette connected to the capsule. Delta P was defined as the measured difference between capsule and pleural liquid pressures. The Lp of the parietal pleura was calculated from the slope of the line relating V to delta P by use of linear regression analysis. Lp in vivo averaged 1.36 X 10(-3) +/- 0.45 X 10(-3) (SD) ml.h-1.cmH2O-1.cm-2, regardless of whether the capsule was filled with plasma or saline and irrespective of body position. This value was not significantly different from that measured in the excised chest wall preparation (1.43 X 10(-3) +/- 1.1 X 10(-3) ml.h-1.cmH2O-1.cm-2). The parietal pleura offers little resistance to transpleural protein movement, because there was no observed difference between plasma and saline. We conclude that because the Lp for intact parietal pleura and extrapleural interstitium is approximately 100 times smaller than that previously measured in isolated stripped pleural preparations, removal of parietal pleural results in a damaged preparation.\r"

The purpose of this study was to examine whether timing of the phasic activity of these inspiratory muscles also was associated with changes in upper airway caliber in OSA. We hypothesized that activation of upper airway muscle phasic electrical activity before activation of the chest wall pump muscles would help preserve upper airway patency. In contrast, we anticipated that the reversal of this pattern with delayed activation of upper airway inspiratory muscles would be associated with upper airway narrowing or collapse. Therefore the timing and amplitude of midline transmandibular and costal margin moving time average (MTA) electromyogram (EMG) signals were analyzed from 58 apnea cycles in stage 2 sleep in six OSA patients. In 86% of the postapnea breaths analyzed the upper airway MTA peak activity preceded the chest wall peak activity. In 86% of the obstructed respiratory efforts the upper airway MTA peak activity followed the chest wall peak activity. The onset of phasic electrical activity followed this same pattern. During inspiratory efforts when phasic inspiratory EMG amplitude did not change from preapnea to apnea, the timing changes noted above occurred. Even within breaths the relative timing of the upper airway and chest wall electrical activities was closely associated with changes in the pressure-flow relationship. We conclude that the relative timing of inspiratory activity of the upper airway and chest wall inspiratory muscles fluctuates during sleep in OSA.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Thus we tested the hypothesis that nerve-implant soleus grafts of rats previously run trained would be refractory to the hypertrophic stimulus of ablation of synergistic muscle. We also compared the magnitude of growth of the nerve-implant soleus graft after ablation with that reported by others for the nerve-intact soleus graft. We studied eight groups that differed relative to the combination and order of treatments (running and ablation of synergistic muscle) and the graft age at the time of the ablation operation and study. Graft mass, protein concentration, and histochemical fiber composition were measured. Compared with grafts from cage-sedentary rats, the mass and protein content of the nerve-implant soleus grafts were higher (16-63%) at all times after ablation. When the ablation operation was performed at 56 days postgrafting, there was a 33% increase in protein content of the soleus graft by 84 days for cage-sedentary animals. This increase was twofold greater (P less than or equal to 0.02) than the 15% increase that followed ablation for the grafts from the animals that had been run trained before the ablation operation. Four weeks of run training before the ablation operation impaired the adaptive response of muscle grafts to the ablation of synergistic muscles, which may reflect alterations in motor unit recruitment and/or satellite cell activity. Ablation of synergistic muscles resulted in an absolute growth of the nerve-implant soleus grafts that was comparable with that reported for nerve-intact soleus grafts.\r"

In 12 isolated excised canine left lower lobes, continuous colorimetric measurements of VE correlated well with calculations of VE from changes in microhematocrit obtained simultaneously. We introduced step increases in microvascular hydrostatic pressure (Pc) of 9 +/- 4.8 (SD) cmH2O and followed the time course of weight and continuous hematocrit changes measured colorimetrically for 40 min, after which Pc was returned to base line, while measurements were continuously obtained. This procedure was repeated for an additional 30 min. VE was calculated from the hematocrit signals and compared with the time course of the weight signal. After increases in Pc, followed by a rapid weight gain, weight signals followed a slow exponential time course, whereas the calculated VE changed linearly. VE reflected approximately 60% of the slow weight gain. When Pc was decreased, weight signals decreased exponentially, whereas VE continued to increase linearly at a slower rate. These results suggest that a significant component of the slow weight signal represents slow vascular volume changes. Contrary to what the weight signal suggested, edema was never reabsorbed over the range of Pc measured.\r"

This desaturation is more likely to occur if the distribution of capillary transit times about the mean is large. Increasing cardiac output is known to decrease mean pulmonary capillary transit time, but the effect on the distribution of transit times has not been reported. We measured the mean and variance of transit times in single pulmonary capillary networks in the dependent lung of anesthetized dogs by in vivo videofluorescence microscopy of a fluorescein dye bolus passing from an arteriole to a venule. When cardiac output increased from 2.9 to 9.9 l/min, mean capillary transit time decreased from 2.0 to 0.8 s. Because transit time variance decreased proportionately (relative dispersion remained constant), increasing cardiac output did not alter the heterogeneity of local capillary transit times in the lower lung where the capillary bed was nearly fully recruited.\r"

Simultaneous measurements of plasma NE, central cardiovascular variables, and renal sodium excretion were conducted in eight normal male subjects on 2 study days; 6 h of thermoneutral (35.0 degrees C) WI to the neck were preceded and followed by 1 h in the seated posture outside the water and 8 h of a seated control period. During the control period, the subjects wore a water-perfused garment (water temperature 34.6 degrees C) to obtain the same skin temperature as during WI. The subjects were fluid restricted overnight and kept in this condition throughout the study. Compared with the prestudy, post-study, and control periods, plasma NE decreased significantly by 61% during WI. Simultaneously, central venous pressure, cardiac output, stroke volume, systolic arterial pressure, and arterial pulse pressure increased, whereas heart rate decreased. Renal sodium excretion and urine flow rate increased. In conclusion, the release of NE is suppressed in humans during immersion. This decrease probably reflects a decrease in sympathetic nervous activity initiated by stimulation of low- and high-pressure baroreceptors. It is possible that the decrease in NE acts as one of several mechanisms of the natriuresis and diuresis of immersion in humans.\r"

Each subject received each drug and a placebo for 1 wk each according to a randomized double-blind crossover design. After placebo, exercise caused 10-20% increases in total plasma cholesterol and the high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol fraction. The total-to-HDL cholesterol ratio fell, particularly during the 30-min recovery phase. Pindolol treatment increased resting values of HDL cholesterol (from 43 +/- 4 to 48 +/- 4 mg/dl) and potentiated the response to exercise (to 59 +/- 5 vs. 51 +/- 4 mg/dl after placebo). The total-to-HDL cholesterol ratio was significantly lower after pindolol treatment than after placebo. In contrast, neither atenolol nor timolol affected exercise-induced changes in plasma lipoprotein levels. The effects of pindolol on other study parameters (exercise endurance and exercise-induced increases in systolic blood pressure, heart rate, and potassium) were similar to the effects of the nonselective agent, timolol. We conclude that the effects of pindolol on the plasma lipid profile are due to its ISA and that the process activated (possibly plasma lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase activity) is under minimal sympathetic control and, therefore, sensitive to the expression of ISA both at rest and in response to exercise.\r"

Each subject was bronchoconstricted with increasing concentrations of aerosolized methacholine while ventilatory patterns and lower airway resistance (Rla) were continually monitored. The asthmatic patients maintained their minute ventilation as Rla increased under all conditions, demonstrating a stable tidal volume with a mild increase in respiratory frequency. Inspiratory drive, as measured by occlusion pressure (P0.1), increased progressively and significantly as Rla increased under all conditions (slopes of P0.1 vs. Rla = 0.249, 0.112, and 0.154 for awake, normal sleep, and sleep after sleep deprivation, respectively, P less than 0.0006). Chemostimuli did not appear to contribute significantly to the observed increases in P0.1. Prior sleep deprivation had no effect on ventilatory and P0.1 responses to bronchoconstriction but did significantly raise the arousal threshold to induced bronchoconstriction. We conclude that ventilatory responses to bronchoconstriction, unlike extrinsic loading, are not imparied by the presence of sleep, nor are they chemically mediated. However, prior sleep deprivation does increase the subsequent arousal threshold.\r"

The total mitochondrial volume density remained unchanged, whereas the volume density of myofibrils was slightly but significantly reduced (-6%). A shift from subsarcolemmal to interfibrillar mitochondria occurred. Interfibrillar mitochondrial volume density was highest near the fiber border and decreased toward the fiber center. An increase in volume density of satellite cells suggested muscle regenerative events. Soleus atrophy with tail suspension greatly decreases the muscular volume but leaves the ultrastructural composition of muscle fibers relatively unaffected.\r"

We found that 1) the amount of inspiratory shortening of the external intercostal was considerably smaller than the amount of shortening of the parasternal; 2) after selective denervation of the parasternal, the inspiratory shortening of both the parasternal and the external intercostal was almost abolished; 3) on the other hand, after selective denervation of the external intercostal, the inspiratory shortening of the parasternal was unchanged, and the inspiratory shortening of the external intercostal was reduced but not suppressed; and 4) this persistent shortening of the external intercostal was reversed into a clear-cut inspiratory lengthening when the parasternal was subsequently denervated. We conclude that in the dog 1) the inspiratory contraction of the external intercostals in the cranial portion of the rib cage is agonistic in nature as is the contraction of the parasternals; 2) during resting breathing, however, the changes in length of these external intercostals are largely determined by the action of the parasternals. These observations are consistent with the idea that in the dog, the parasternals play a larger role than the external intercostals in elevating the ribs during resting inspiration.\r"

Physiol. 68: 594-603, 1990) in isolated rat lungs, we suggested that the rate of pulmonary air space absorption of inhaled NO2 is limited, in part, by chemical reaction(s) rather than by physical solubility. Because the initial site of primary absorption interactions involves the epithelial lining fluid (ELF), we investigated whether ELF-NO2 interactions could account for pulmonary NO2 reactive absorption. Rat ELF, obtained by bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), was compared with a model chemical system (reduced glutathione, GSH). In vitro exposures (NO2-air) used constant gas flow and planar gas-liquid interfaces. 1) Solvent pH notably altered NO2 uptake by GSH but to a lesser extent by BAL. 2) Uptake displayed [GSH]-dependent saturation. [ELF] in BAL was augmented by sequential lavage (lavagate reuse) of multiple lungs. Uptake was proportional to [ELF] but did not saturate under these exposure conditions. 3) The uptake rate exhibited [NO2] dependence. However, relative to increasing [NO2], fractional uptakes decreased for BAL and 1 mM GSH but not for 10 mM GSH. 4) Altered convective gas flow produced nonlinear increments in uptake (10 mM GSH) and substantial decrements in fractional uptake. 5) Arrhenius plots [ln(r) vs. 1/T, where r is reaction rate and T is absolute temperature (degree K)] for BAL and 1 mM GSH yielded respective activation energies of 4,952 and 4,149 kcal.g-1.mol-1 and degree of change in the rate of NO2 uptake per 10 degrees C (Q10) of 1.32 and 1.25.

  ".W": "The heterogeneity of pulmonary blood flow was examined using a fractal analytic procedure, and the results were compared with the traditional gravitational model of flow distribution. 99mTc-labeled macroaggregate was injected intravenously at functional residual capacity in six supine anesthetized dogs. The lungs were fixed in situ and sliced in transverse sections. The slices were imaged on a planar gamma camera, and a three-dimensional array of blood flow measurements was reconstructed for each lung. Fractal analysis was used to examine the spatial heterogeneity or RDs (relative dispersion = SD/mean) as a function of the number of pieces into which the flow array was subdivided. RDs was fractal and could be characterized by a fractal dimension (Ds) of 1.09 +/- 0.02, where a Ds of 1.0 reflects homogeneous flow and 1.5 indicates a random flow distribution. The data fit the fractal model exceptionally well with an average r = 0.98. RDs was examined in gravitational and isogravitational planes and as expected was greatest in the gravitational direction. However, the difference was small, suggesting that gravitation plays a secondary role to an underlying process producing heterogeneity. Within the limits of resolution attained by this study (piece volumes greater than 0.25 cm3), the heterogeneity of pulmonary blood flow is well characterized by a fractal model.\r"

  ".W": "In studies of large-amplitude periodic flows at an airway bifurcation, we found an appreciable steady-state pressure difference between the terminal units. To elucidate the fluid dynamic origins of such steady-state pressure differences, we studied single asymmetric bifurcation models with various area ratios and branching angles. The daughter ducts were identical in size and were terminated into identical elastic loads. Sinusoidal flow oscillations were applied at the parent duct so that the upstream Reynolds number ranged from 30 to 77,000 and the Womersley parameter from 2 to 30. The steady-state component (time averaged) of the pressure measured at the terminal with the smaller branching angle was found to be consistently higher than that at the other terminal. This steady-state pressure difference scaled approximately as a fixed fraction of the parent duct dynamic head. Guided by the results of flow-visualization studies, we modeled such behavior based on the temporal and spatial differences of head loss between the two branches of the bifurcation. Our results suggest that interlobar heterogeneity of mean alveolar-pressure observed in excised canine lungs during high frequency oscillation (Allen et al., J. Appl. Physiol. 62: 223-228, 1987) arises solely from fluid dynamic origins: differential head loss due to asymmetry of central airway branching structure.\r"

  ".W": "The distribution of flow among parallel pathways is believed to be determined by the balance of downstream mechanical loads or time constants. We studied the influence of upstream flow conditions and airway geometry vs. downstream mechanical impedances in determining flow partitioning at airway bifurcations. Each model consisted of a single rigid bifurcation with various branching angles and area ratios but having identical pathway impedances. Sinusoidal volumetric oscillations were applied at the parent duct with various frequencies and tidal volumes. Measuring the terminal pressures continuously, we calculated the flow distribution. When flow amplitude was small, flow partitioning was homogeneous and synchronous, as expected in a system possessing homogeneous pathway impedances and time constants. But when flow amplitude was large and frequency was high, appreciable heterogeneity and asynchrony of flow partitioning arose; during midinspiration the high-velocity flow stream preferentially favored the axial pathway. This effect vanished in the absence of a net area change at the bifurcation. For a given bifurcation geometry, these observations could be organized using only two nondimensional parameters, neither of which incorporated consideration of fluid friction. The description of temporal events required, in addition, a nondimensional time. Therefore these flow-dependent phenomena and their underlying mechanisms differ fundamentally from those described in classical impedance models. The complex pattern of nonuniform interregional behaviors apparent in whole lungs when tidal volume and frequency are large (Allen et al., J. Clin. Invest. 76: 620-629, 1985) is reiterated faithfully in models consisting of only two compartments with homogeneous time constants. As such, the behaviors observed in lungs would appear to be attributable in large part to fluid dynamic factors in central airways.\r"

Each model consisted of a single asymmetric bifurcation with a different branching angle and area ratio, with each branch terminated into an identical elastic load. Sinusoidal volumetric oscillations were applied at the parent duct so that the upstream Reynolds number (Re) varied from 30 to 77,000 and the Womersley parameter (alpha) from 4 to 30. Pressures were measured continuously at the parent duct and at both terminals, and instantaneous branch flow rates were calculated. Time-averaged energy dissipation in the bifurcation was computed from an energy budget over a control volume integrated over a cycle and was expressed as a friction factor, F. We found that when tidal volume was small [ratio of tidal volume to resident (dead space) volume, VT/VD less than 1], F was independent of branching angle and fell with increasing alpha and VT/VD. When tidal volume was large (VT/VD greater than 1), F increased with increasing branching angle and varied less strongly with alpha and VT/VD. No simple benchmark flow represented the data well over the entire experimental range. This study demonstrates that only two nondimensional parameters, alpha and VT/VD, are necessary and are sufficient to describe time-averaged energy dissipation in a given bifurcation geometry during sinusoidal flow.\r"

The hypothesis that VO2max is determined in part by peripheral tissue O2 diffusion predicts proportional declines in VO2max and PCO2 if the diffusing capacity of the muscle remains constant. The inspired O2 fraction was altered in each of six dogs to produce four different levels of PaO2 [22 +/- 2, 29 +/- 1, 38 +/- 1, and 79 +/- 4 (SE) Torr]. Muscle blood flow, with the circulation isolated, was held constant at 122 +/- 15 ml.100 g-1.min-1 while the muscle worked maximally (isometric twitches at 5-7 Hz) at each of the four different values of PaO2. Arterial and venous samples were taken to measure lactate, pH, PO2, PCO2, and muscle VO2. PCO2 was calculated using Fick's law of diffusion and a Bohr integration procedure. VO2max fell progressively (P less than 0.01) with decreasing PaO2. The decline in VO2max was proportional (R = 0.99) to the fall in both muscle PvO2 and calculated PCO2 while the calculated muscle diffusing capacity was not different among the four conditions. Fatigue developed more rapidly with lower PaO2, although lactate output from the muscle was not different among conditions. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that resistance to O2 diffusion in the peripheral tissue may be a principal determinant of VO2max.\r"

Acute responders had only an immediate increase in mean airflow resistance after antigen, whereas dual responders had an immediate and late-phase (6-8 h after antigen challenge) increase in mean airflow resistance; nonsensitive sheep had minimal airway responses to antigen (less than 30% increase from base line). The sheep were anesthetized 2 wk later and, after a left thoracotomy, were challenged with antigen to determine bronchial vascular responses; bronchial artery blood flow was measured with an electromagnetic flow probe. Airway responses to antigen aerosol challenge were similar in the anesthetized and conscious animals. The mean fall in bronchial vascular resistance (BVR) immediately after antigen challenge was similar in acute and dual responders (41 +/- 7 and 47 +/- 9% of base line, respectively). In dual responders, late-phase airway responses were preceded by a significant increase from base line in Qbr and a fall in bronchovascular resistance (BVR). The mean fall in BVR 6-8 h after antigen challenge in documented dual responders was significantly different from bronchial vascular responses in acute responders (59 +/- 3 vs. 89 +/- 10%, respectively). Sheep without airway responses to A. suum had no significant changes in bronchial hemodynamics or airways mechanics. Late-phase-associated changes in BVR are a specific response to antigen challenge and may be a sensitive index of mediators being released.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The basal urinary excretion rate of N tau-MIAA was determined as 0.117 +/- 0.008 (SE) mg/h, with a renal clearance for N tau-MIAA of 273 +/- 27 ml/min implying active secretion. After subpharmacological infusion of histamine (50 ng.kg-1.min-1 over 2 h) in five volunteers that increased plasma histamine from 0.28 +/- 0.04 to 0.71 +/- 0.15 ng/ml, urinary excretion of N tau-MIAA over 8 h was increased by less than 17% compared with a control saline infusion. Urinary N tau-MIAA excretion in normal controls (273 +/- 14 micrograms/mmol creatinine) was similar to that observed in patients with severe acute asthma (253 +/- 22 micrograms/mmol), antigen-induced bronchoconstriction (269 +/- 21 micrograms/mmol), seasonal allergic rhinitis (304 +/- 31 micrograms/mmol), and clinically stable bronchiectasis (270 +/- 22 micrograms/mmol). In contrast, large increases in metabolite excretion (greater than 7,000 micrograms/mmol creatinine) were observed in a patient with systemic mastocytosis where very high plasma histamine levels were recorded (greater than 500 ng/ml) and marked systemic hemodynamic effects occurred. We conclude that urinary N tau-MIAA will only be increased in pathologies where sustained hyperhistaminemia occurs and that increased local histamine production in the lung or the upper airway does not cause a measurable change in the basal urinary excretion of this metabolite.\r"

Vascular permeability, assessed by determining filtration coefficient (Kf), and vascular resistances were measured at the beginning and end of the experiment. Ischemia reperfusion was produced by occluding blood flow to the lung for 3 h and reperfusing for 1 h, whereas hypoxia reoxygenation was obtained by ventilating the lung with 95% N2-5% CO2 for 3 h and then ventilating with 95% O2-5% CO2 for 1 h with no interruption of perfusion. There was a significant increase in Kf in both ischemia reperfusion and hypoxia reoxygenation groups (51 and 85%, respectively), and total vascular resistance increased greatly in both groups (386 and 532%, respectively). Two additional groups were also studied in which the ischemia reperfusion or hypoxia reoxygenation lungs were pretreated with allopurinol (20 micrograms/ml). The Kf did not significantly increase in either the allopurinol ischemia reperfusion or the allopurinol hypoxia reoxygenation groups (22 and 6%, respectively). However, total vascular resistance significantly increased in both groups (239 and 224%, respectively). Although vascular permeability is modestly increased by both ischemia reperfusion and hypoxia reoxygenation, the predominant change in these conditions is the increased vascular resistance, which predominantly affects the postcapillary resistance and would result in a greater tendency for edema to develop in these slightly damaged lungs. Allopurinol, which inhibits xanthine oxidase, attenuated the permeability changes in both groups and may be useful in preventing ischemia reperfusion injury in certain conditions.\r"

Plasma epinephrine concentration was much higher in the phrenicoabdominal vein than in the aorta (24-43 times).

The infusion was performed at a constant rate of 0.29 ml.kg body wt-1.min-1 for 20-50 min of exercise to mimic fluid intake during exercise. PV decreased by approximately 5 ml/kg body wt within the first 10 min of exercise in all protocols. Therefore, PV in Inf(-) was maintained at the same reduced level by 50 min of exercise in both ambient temperatures, whereas PV in Inf(+) increased toward the preexercise level and recovered approximately 4.5 ml/kg body wt by 50 min in both temperatures. The restoration of PV during exercise suppressed the HR increase by 6 beats/min at 50 min of exercise in W; however, infusion had no effect on HR in C. In W, FBF in Inf(+) continued to increase linearly as Tes rose to 38.1 degrees C by the end of exercise, whereas FBF in Inf(-) plateaued when Tes reached approximately 37.7 degrees C.

Various hydraulic pressures (Pcap) were set in the capsule; at each Pcap the liquid flow per unit surface area (V/S) between the Disse's interstitial space and the capsule was measured from the rate of liquid displacement in the pipette. The slope of the V/S vs. Pcap linear regression was utilized to estimate the hydraulic conductivity of the Glissonian-peritoneal membrane and averaged 5.1 x 10(-3) +/- 4.7 x 10(-3) (SD) ml.h-1.cmH2O-1.cm-2 (n = 25). Hydraulic pressure in the Disse's space (Pd) was measured by closing the capsule against the transducer disconnected from the pipette. At portal and hepatic venous pressures of 7.6 +/- 2.9 and 2.6 +/- 1 cmH2O, respectively, Pd was 2.05 +/- 2 cmH2O.

The analysis consisted of 1) fitting first- and second-order autoregressive models (AR1 and AR2) and 2) obtaining the power spectra of the data by fast-Fourier transform. For the AR2 model, the only coefficients that were statistically different from zero were the average alpha 1 (a1) for TI, VI, and Vm (a1 = 0.19, 0.29, and 0.15, respectively). However, the power spectra of all parameters often exhibited peaks at low frequency (less than 0.2 cycles/breath) and/or at high frequency (greater than 0.2 cycles/breath), indicative of periodic oscillations. After accounting for the corrupting effects of added oscillations on the a1 estimates, we conclude that 1) breath-to-breath fluctuations of VI, and to a lesser extent TI and Vm, exhibit a first-order autoregressive structure such that fluctuations of each breath are positively correlated with those of immediately preceding breaths and 2) the correlated components of variability in TE are mostly due to discrete high- and/or low-frequency oscillations with no underlying autoregressive structure. We propose that the autoregressive structure of VI, TI, and Vm during spontaneous breathing in stage 2 sleep may reflect either a central neural mechanism or the effects of noise in respiratory chemical feedback loops; the presence of low-frequency oscillations, seen more often in Vm, suggests possible instability in the chemical feedback loops. Mechanisms of high-frequency periodicities, seen more often in TE, are unknown.\r"

This study determined whether afferents in the diaphragm contribute to compensatory changes in phrenic motor drive when the operating length of the diaphragm is suddenly increased. Experiments were performed in six closed-chest pentothal-anesthetized cats. Length changes were measured using a pair of piezoelectric crystals implanted in the left crural diaphragm. The crural electromyogram (EMGdi) was measured by electrodes fixed to each crystal. The animal was suspended in a spinal frame, and a Plexiglas tube was fitted around the cat's abdomen. A balloon placed inside the tube was inflated during the expiratory phase to produce a mean increase of 17% in diaphragm length at functional residual capacity. Ten trials were performed in succession under the following conditions: intact, after bilateral vagotomy, after spinal section at C7, and after cervical dorsal rhizotomy. Peak integrated EMGdi (integral of EMGdi) and neural inspiratory time (nTI) were measured for the last control inspiration and the first after inflation. There was a significant reduction in the peak integral of EMGdi when the length of the diaphragm was increased for all conditions except after rhizotomy. Although not measured, it is likely that the tension developed by the diaphragm was also increased during abdominal compression. Results suggest that afferents sensitive to changes in the operating length and/or tension in the diaphragm contribute to compensatory alterations in phrenic motor drive.\r"

  ".W": "This study characterized the biochemical properties of the rat diaphragm by measuring the activities of selected citric acid cycle and glycolytic enzymes. The diaphragm was removed from 10 female Sprague-Dawley rats (180 days old) and dissected into five discrete anatomic regions: crural (region 1), left posterior costal (region 2), left anterior costal (region 3), right anterior costal (region 4), and right posterior costal (region 5). Sections were assayed for total protein concentration and the activities of succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). The SDH activity in the crural region was approximately 18% lower (P less than 0.05) than that in any costal region. Furthermore, protein concentration was significantly lower (P less than 0.05) in the crural region compared with all costal regions. In contrast, costal regions 2-5 did not significantly differ from each other in protein concentration or SDH activity. LDH activity did not differ significantly (P greater than 0.05) between regions. Finally, the LDH-to-SDH activity ratio was significantly higher (P less than 0.05) in the crural diaphragm compared with all costal regions. We conclude that the crural region of the rat diaphragm is significantly lower in oxidative capacity than all the costal regions. Investigators who use a rodent model to study diaphragmatic function and plasticity should consider the oxidative heterogeneity of the diaphragm when designing experiments.\r"

  ".W": "To examine the influence of an increase in central blood volume with head-out water immersion (WI) on the sympathoadrenal response to graded dynamic exercise, nine healthy men underwent upright leg cycle exercise on land and with WI. Plasma norepinephrine and epinephrine concentrations were used as indexes of overall sympathoadrenal activity. Oxygen consumption (VO2), heart rate, systolic blood pressure, and plasma concentrations of norepinephrine, epinephrine, and lactate were determined at work loads corresponding to approximately 40, 60, 80, and 100% peak VO2. Peak VO2 did not differ on land and with WI. Plasma norepinephrine concentration was reduced (P less than 0.05) at 80 and 100% peak VO2 with WI and on land, respectively. Plasma epinephrine and lactate concentrations were similar on land and with WI at the three submaximal work stages, but both were reduced (P less than 0.05) at peak exertion with WI. Heart rate was lower (P less than 0.05) at the three highest work intensities with WI. These results suggest that the central shift in blood volume with WI reduces the sympathoadrenal response to high-intensity dynamic exercise.\r"

Ten men performed upright cycling exercise on land and in water to the suprasternal notch at work loads corresponding to 40, 60, 80, and 100% maximal O2 consumption (VO2max). A Swan-Ganz catheter was used to measure right atrial pressure (PAP), pulmonary arterial pressure (PAP), and cardiac index (CI). Left ventricular end-diastolic (LVED) and end-systolic (LVES) volume indexes were assessed with echocardiography. VO2max did not differ between land and water. RAP, PAP, CI, stroke index, and LVED and LVES volume indexes were significantly greater (P less than 0.05) during exercise in water than on land. Stroke index did not change significantly from rest to exercise in water but increased (P less than 0.05) on land. Arterial systolic blood pressure did not differ between land and water at rest or during exercise. Heart rates were significantly lower (P less than 0.05) in water only during the two highest work intensities.

First we studied whether nitric oxide could relax isolated tracheal strips, and then we examined the effects of known inhibitors of endothelium-dependent relaxation (EDR) in the vascular system [hemoglobin, methylene blue, and NG-monomethyl-L-arginine (L-NMMA)] on epithelium-dependent relaxation (EpDR) induced by hyperosmotic stimuli in perfused whole tracheal preparations. Mannitol (160 mM in Krebs-Henseleit solution) applied to the epithelial surface was used as an osmotic stimulus to induce EpDR after carbachol-induced contraction (2 microM, serosal side). Nitric oxide produced concentration-dependent and complete relaxation of epithelium-denuded tracheal strips. Preincubation of the whole trachea with hemoglobin significantly inhibited osmotic-induced EpDR (P less than 0.05), but preincubation with methylene blue and L-NMMA did not. Hemoglobin introduced into the epithelial side after EpDR induced by hyperosmotic stimuli reversed relaxation, but methylene blue and L-NMMA did not. These results suggest that, although EpDR and vascular EDR have some pharmacological similarities and nitric oxide can relax airway smooth muscle, nitric oxide is not responsible for osmotic-induced EpDR.\r"

Six men who exhibited vigorous isometric contractions of thigh and calf muscles were classed as \"responders\" to FNS (R), and the remaining subjects with poor or nonexistent contractions served as \"nonresponder controls\" (C). Steady-state heart rate and oxygen uptake during ACE at 30, 60, and 90 W were not appreciably different from the ACE + FNS condition. However, cardiac outputs in R were augmented by 30% during FNS at rest (from 4.9 to 6.4 l/min), by 18% during 30-W ACE + FNS (from 8.6 to 10.1 l/min), and by 28% during 90-W ACE + FNS (from 12.1 to 15.6 l/min). Similarly, resting stroke volumes were increased by 18% (9 ml) and by 23% (19 ml) at 60 W during FNS in the R group. Calculated total peripheral resistance was reduced at rest and during 90-W ACE + FNS by approximately 24%. In contrast, no alterations of circulatory hemodynamics were observed for C subjects. These data indicate that FNS-induced contractions of paralyzed leg muscles augment venous return to aid central cardiovascular control during upper-body submaximal exercise in paraplegics.\r"

Pairs of fourth-order bronchi with and without epithelium were suspended in organ chambers in physiological salt solution (95% O2-5% CO2, 37 degrees C). The bronchi were contracted to the concentration of acetylcholine or 5-hydroxytryptamine that resulted in a contraction that was 40 or 80% of the response to 10(-4) M of the agonist (ED40 or ED80). Epithelium removal reduced relaxations to isoproterenol and sodium nitroprusside during contraction to the ED80 but not the ED40 of acetylcholine. Responses to forskolin were not affected. Bronchi were significantly more sensitive to relaxing agonists in the presence of 5-hydroxytryptamine; there was no effect on epithelium removal or level of contraction. Thus 1) the influence of epithelium on bronchial relaxation is greatest during high degrees of cholinergic tone and 2) experimental conditions influence the effect of epithelium removal on relaxation.\r"

FD rats were killed after 10, 20, or 40 min of infusion at rest or after exercise. Rats were also killed 15 min postexercise for FS and 60 or 120 min postexercise for FD with continued insulin infusion. The progressive decline in blood glucose was not altered by exercise in the FS rats. FD rats showed a significant difference due to exercise only after 40 min (rest 4.2 +/- 0.3 mM, exercise 3.2 +/- 0.2 mM). A significant postexercise repletion of glycogen was observed in red vastus and soleus muscles of FD rats despite the decreasing blood glucose values. These data indicate that exercise accelerates the rate of development of hypoglycemia in FD rats. In the FS rats, where the rate of decline in blood glucose was greater, exercise had no effect on the time course of development of hypoglycemia.\r"

  ".W": "Our objectives were to determine 1) the effects of increased respiratory dead space (VD) on the ventilatory response to exercise and 2) whether changes in the ventilatory response are due to changes in chemoreceptor feedback (rest to exercise) vs. changes in the feedforward exercise stimulus. Steady-state ventilation (VI) and arterial blood gas responses to mild or moderate hyperoxic exercise in goats were compared with and without increased VD. Responses were compared using a simple mathematical model with the following assumptions: 1) steady state, 2) linear CO2 chemoreceptor feedback, 3) linear feedforward exercise stimulus proportional to CO2 production (VCO2) and characterized by an exercise gain (Gex), and 4) additive exercise stimulus and CO2 feedback producing the system gain (Gsys = delta VI/delta VCO2). Model predictions at constant Gex [assuming VD-to-tidal volume (VT) ratio independent of VCO2] are that increased VD/VT will 1) increase arterial PCO2 (PaCO2) and VI at rest and 2) increase Gsys via changes in chemoreceptor feedback due to a small increase in the PaCO2 vs. VCO2 slope. Experimental results indicate that increased VD increased VD/VT, PaCO2, and VI at rest and increased Gsys during exercise. However, measurable changes in the PaCO2 vs. VCO2 slope occurred only at high VD/VT or running speeds. Gex was estimated at each VD for each goat by using the model in conjunction with experimental measurements. With 0.2 liter VD, Gex increased 40% (P less than 0.01); with 0.6 liter VD, Gex increased 110% between 0 and 2.4 km/h and 5% grade (P less than 0.01) but not between 2.4 and 4.8 km/h. Thus, Gex is increased by VD through a limited range. In goats, increases in Gsys with increased VD result from increases in both Gex and CO2 chemoreceptor feedback. These results are consistent with other experimental treatments that increase the exercise ventilatory response, maintaining constant relative PaCO2 regulation, and suggest that a common mechanism linked to resting ventilatory drive modulates Gex.\r"

Thirteen fibers, which had interspike interval distributions with a prominent peak [24.0 +/- 9.8% (SD)] at 0- to 20-ms bin, were termed bursting fibers (BF). The 16 remaining fibers were termed nonbursting fibers (NBF); these had no notable peak in the interval distributions. During hypoxia and hypercapnia, the chemoreceptor fibers continued to discharge in their established patterns. The interval distribution of most NBF spike trains could be described with the Poisson process, but none of the BF could be. However, except for the intervals in the range of 0-20 ms, the interval distribution of the BF could be described as exponential. This study suggests that 1) there are two distinct populations of the goat chemoreceptor fiber, each with an inherent discharge pattern; 2) the chemoreceptor did not code information about arterial PO2 and PCO2 in different patterns; and 3) the basic chemotransduction mechanism is likely the same in BF and NBF, and the difference in discharge pattern is more likely to reflect processes downstream from the transducer.\r"

  ".W": "A comparison of fatigue as a loss of force with repeated contractions over time was performed in canine respiratory muscle by isometric (nonshortening) and isovelocity (shortening) contractions. In situ diaphragm muscle strips were attached to a linear ergometer and electrically stimulated (30 or 40 Hz) via the left phrenic nerve to produce either isometric (n = 12) or isovelocity (n = 12) contractions (1.5 s) from optimal muscle length (Lo = 8.8 cm). Similar velocities of shortening between isovelocity experiments [0.19 +/- 0.02 (SD) Lo/S] were produced by maximizing the mean power output (Wmax = 210 +/- 27 mW/cm2) that could be developed over 1.5 s when displacement was approximately 0.30 Lo. Initial peak isometric tension was 1.98 kg/cm2, whereas initial peak isovelocity tension was 1.84 kg/mc2 (P less than 0.01) or 93% of initial isometric tension. Fatigue trials of 5 min were conducted on muscles contracting at a constant duty cycle (0.43). At the end of the trials, peak isovelocity tension had fallen to 50% of initial isometric tension (P less than 0.01), whereas peak isometric tension had only fallen by 27%. These results indicate that muscle shortening during force production has a significant influence on diaphragm muscle fatigue. We conclude that the effects of shortening on fatigue must be considered in models of respiratory muscle function, because these muscles typically shorten during breathing.\r"

In simultaneous tracings of tidal volume (VT) and expiratory profiles of endogenous gases (PO2 or PCO2), the phase I volume of each breath was determined graphically as the volume expired up to the end of phase I of the expirogram. The mean phase I volume of different animals ranged from 0.29 to 0.43 ml with an arithmetic dispersion between 0.014 and 0.021 ml. Spontaneous sighs sometimes with doubling of the VT caused a significant rise of phase I volume up to 50% of the normal values. The linear regression curve was calculated for corresponding VT's and phase I volumes. The VT gradient of the phase I volume as the slope of this curve ranged from 0.108 to 0.217 ml/ml VT. The results of the new procedure, which works also with humans and rabbits, are discussed in respect to improvement of the characterization of the bronchial system. Compared with the human system, the VT gradient of the guinea pig is four times greater. By not being affected by disorders in pulmonary gas exchange, the phase I volume determined as described is a new suitable quantity to specifically assess actions and reactions of the bronchial system.\r"

A large concentration of connective tissue fibers was located in the alveolar duct wall in both species. For rats, the tissue densities of collagen and elastin fibers located within 10 microns of an alveolar duct were 13 and 9%, respectively. In human lung samples, the tissue densities of collagen and elastin fibers within 20 microns of an alveolar duct were 18 and 16%, respectively. In both species, bands of elastin fibers formed a continuous ring around each alveolar mouth. In human lungs, elastin fibers were found to penetrate significantly deeper into alveolar septal walls than they did in rat lungs. The concentration of connective tissue elements in the alveolar duct walls of both species is consistent with their proposed roles as the principal load-bearing elements of the lung parenchyma.\r"

The goal is to maintain parameter accuracy simultaneously with practical experiment design. The analysis focuses on predicting parameter uncertainties using a linearized approximation for joint confidence regions. Applications are with four-element parallel and viscoelastic models for 0.125- to 4-Hz data and a six-element model with separate tissue and airway properties for input and transfer impedance data from 2-64 Hz. The criterion function form was evaluated by comparing parameter uncertainties when data are fit as magnitude and phase, dynamic resistance and compliance, or real and imaginary parts of input impedance. The proper choice of weighting can make all three criterion variables comparable. For the six-element model, parameter uncertainties were predicted when both input impedance and transfer impedance are acquired and fit simultaneously. A fit to both data sets from 4 to 64 Hz could reduce parameter estimate uncertainties considerably from those achievable by fitting either alone. For the four-element models, use of an independent, but noisy, measure of static compliance was assessed as a constraint on model parameters. This may allow acceptable parameter uncertainties for a minimum frequency of 0.275-0.375 Hz rather than 0.125 Hz. This reduces data acquisition requirements from a 16- to a 5.33- to 8-s breath holding period. These results are approximations, and the impact of using the linearized approximation for the confidence regions is discussed.\r"

  ".W": "Studies were performed to determine whether the central nervous system actions of corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) and angiotensin II (ANG II) on systemic arterial pressure are mediated, in part, through changes in cardiac output (CO). Changes in CO after intracerebroventricular administration of ANG II and CRF were assessed in conscious unrestrained rats bearing pulsed Doppler flow probes on the ascending aorta. Intracerebroventricular injection of CRF (0.15 nmol) increased arterial pressure (15-20 mmHg), heart rate (70-100 beats/min), and CO (25-35%) without significantly affecting total peripheral resistance. Intracerebroventricular injection of ANG II (0.1 nmol) produced similar elevations of arterial pressure (15-20 mmHg). However, the ANG II-induced pressor response was attended by significant decreases in heart rate (20 beats/min) and CO (10-15%) and significant increases in total peripheral resistance (30-40%). The results of these studies demonstrate that CO, as assessed by pulsed Doppler flow probe methodology, may be influenced significantly and differentially by central nervous system administration of CRF and ANG II.\r"

The over-all result was rated as excellent in twenty patients, good in eleven, fair in six, and poor in three.

The three testing parameters were the extent of anterior translation at eighty-nine newtons of force and at maximum manual force, and the compliance index. The differences between the involved and the uninvolved knees were calculated. At eighty-nine newtons, all but one of the control subjects had anterior translation of ten millimeters or less, compared with 58 per cent of the patients who had a chronic tear. At maximum manual force, all but two of the control subjects had translation of ten millimeters or less, compared with 20 per cent of the patients who had an acute or a chronic tear. Analysis of variance showed that the clinical diagnosis correlated well with the results for all tests (p less than 0.001). However, when the uninjured knees of patients who had an acute or a chronic tear were compared with the knees of the control subjects, significant differences were noted (p less than 0.001 to 0.006). In the patients who had a chronic tear, there was no relationship between the time from injury to operation and the extent of anterior translation. The arthrometric test at maximum manual force was the strongest discriminant; it differentiated normal from abnormal knees (p less than 0.001) with high sensitivity (92 per cent), high specificity (95 per cent), and high positive predictive accuracy; the cut-off point was eleven millimeters or less.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Anterior and posterior displacement were measured at forces of eighty-nine newtons (twenty pounds) and 133 newtons (thirty pounds). We found significant differences in reproducibility of measurement among the devices. The Acufex, Medmetric, and Stryker devices had more reproducible measurements, and they could be used to identify 80 to 90 per cent of the normal subjects and anterior cruciate-deficient patients. The Genucom device had poorer reproducibility of measurement, and it tended to register greater differences in displacement between the right and left knees of normal subjects.\r"

  ".W": "Eight lower extremities from cadavera were tested for anterior-posterior laxity in two positions before and after transection of the anterior cruciate ligament. At critical points in the tests, electrogoniometric and radiographic measurements of tibiofemoral translation were compared. By direct measurement, we determined the accuracy of the radiographic method to +/- 0.4 millimeter (95 per cent) in measuring anterior-posterior translations of the tibia with respect to the femur. The electrogoniometer estimated displacement of the tibia with respect to the femur during the anterior drawer test to be 3.5 +/- 8.2 millimeters at 90 degrees of flexion of the knee and 11.1 +/- 16.1 millimeters at 30 degrees of flexion. Direct comparison of these measurements with those obtained by means of the radiographic technique showed that the electrogoniometer tended, on average, to overestimate the tibial translation. The amount of overestimation was 0.7 millimeter for intact knees and 1.9 millimeters after sacrifice of the anterior cruciate ligament. Despite this small average error in measurement of tibial translation, the difference between individual electrogoniometric and radiographic measurements varied greatly, with a 95 per cent confidence limit of +/- 5.5 millimeters. The error of the electrogoniometric measurements varied with the angle of flexion of the knee during testing, both the accuracy and the reliability of the electrogoniometric measurements being greatly diminished at 30 degrees of flexion. The electrogoniometric method also tended to overestimate tibial internal rotation (by an average of 10.5 degrees) and external rotation (by an average of 9.3 degrees); the reliability of these measurements was +/- 6.9 degrees.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The braces limited abnormal tibiofemoral displacements by 10 to 75 per cent in translation; there was more variation in rotation. This study demonstrated that functional knee-braces provide a restraining influence that may be beneficial in the control of abnormal displacements of the knee, but that the degree of restraint varies considerably.\r"

We investigated the relationship of these translations to the position of the glenohumeral joint and to applied torques and forces in seven isolated glenohumeral joints from fresh cadavera, using a six-degrees-of-freedom position sensor and a six-axis force and torque transducer. Reproducible and significant translation occurred in an anterior direction with glenohumeral flexion and in a posterior direction with extension. We also observed translation with cross-body movement. The translation occurring with flexion was obligate in that it could not be prevented by the application of an oppositely directed force of thirty to forty newtons. Operative tightening of the posterior portion of the capsule increased the anterior translation on flexion and cross-body movement and caused it to occur earlier in the arc of motion compared with the intact glenohumeral joint. Operative tightening of the posterior part of the capsule also resulted in significant superior translation with flexion of the glenohumeral joint.\r"

The labrum was a separate anatomical structure that could be distinguished from the fibrous capsule of the shoulder. Neonatal labra were composed of primitive mesenchymal tissue containing only few chondrocytes that modulated into fibrocartilage in the first few years of life. Neonatal labra contained no elastin, whereas specimens from adults had rare elastin fibers. The labrum was sparsely vascularized throughout its substance, with no particular pattern of distribution. Vascularity decreased with increasing age of the individual.\r"

The series of loading tests was performed with two cancellous-bone screws through the tibia into the talus and a lateral fibular strut graft fixed with a proximal and a distal screw. The tests were repeated after the strut graft was removed, and again after it had been reapplied. The amount of motion at the site of the arthrodesis was greatest with tibial torque and was least with medial-lateral bending; this was true for specimens with or without a fibular strut graft. Removal of the strut graft allowed increased tibiotalar motion for all modes of loading; increases in motion were far greater for specimens of poor bone quality.\r"

The mode of transmission appears to be autosomal dominant. Platyspondylysis is present but there are no anterior tongue-like deformities of the vertebral bodies. Because of the presence of spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia and normal intelligence, and the lack of abnormalities at birth, this entity seems to mimic Morquio syndrome.

Although similar or related phenomena have been observed previously, the purposes of the study were to determine if this response was reproducible, to characterize it in terms of its magnitude and duration, and to show how it is related to the type of injury sustained. To obtain this information, a model was used in which an intramedullary nail was implanted in the femur and a standard closed fracture was subsequently produced. The osteogenic response was measured by histomorphometry. Eight-four nine-week-old male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into seven groups of twelve animals each. Groups I and II consisted of control animals in which no injury was produced. In Group-III rats, cortical drilling of the intercondylar notch and piriformis fossa of the right femur was performed, without intramedullary nailing. In Groups IV through VII, half of each group received intramedullary nails only, and in the other half intramedullary nailing was done and a closed transverse diaphyseal fracture was produced. With two different fluorochrome labels, rates of mineral apposition were measured in the left and right tibiae of all animals. The labeling periods differed in each group and were designed to determine when the peak response occurred, how long it lasted, and whether aging during the course of the experiment affected the response.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

At the most recent follow-up, twenty-nine knees (29 per cent), nine of which were affected by rheumatoid arthritis, were still painful in the patellofemoral area. The height and weight of the patient definitely influenced the amount of patellofemoral pain postoperatively. Small patients who had osteoarthrosis were exceptionally free of pain, regardless of sex, age, or level of activity. It seems that the best approach to patellofemoral replacement includes resurfacing of the patella in all patients who have rheumatoid arthritis and in patients who have osteoarthrosis if they have preoperative patellofemoral pain, are more than 160 centimeters tall, weigh more than sixty kilograms, and have advanced changes in the patella at the time of the operation.\r"

  ".W": "Thirty-one total knee arthroplasties were followed by infection in twenty-seven patients who were subsequently treated with debridement, retention of the components, and intravenous administration of antibiotics. The results were reviewed retrospectively in an effort to evaluate the function of the prostheses that had been salvaged successfully and to identify the causes of failure of those around which an infection had recurred. At the most recent follow-up (average duration, 8.8 years), infection had recurred around twenty-four (77 per cent) of the thirty-one arthroplasties. Seven knees (23 per cent) remained free of infection. Function remained satisfactory, although revision was subsequently needed in two knees for reasons other than infection. One cause of failure was the duration of the infection before debridement. This averaged twenty-one days for the seven knees in which the prosthetic arthroplasty had been salvaged and thirty-six days for the twenty-four knees in which treatment had failed. Another cause of failure was the type of organism: Staphylococcus aureus had caused the infection in fourteen (58 per cent) of the twenty-four knees in which the treatment failed but in only two of the seven knees in which the prosthetic arthroplasty was salvaged. In addition, eight infections in the first group were resistant to penicillin, whereas both infections in the second group were sensitive to penicillin. The four infections with gram-negative organisms in the series were all in knees in which the treatment failed. All six hinged prostheses that were used failed.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Thirty-two patients who had ablation of the foot by the Syme or Boyd technique for partial or total absence of the fibula, with subsequent fitting of a prosthesis, were compared with eleven patients who had lengthening of the lower limb by the Wagner method, to assess the long-term results of each procedure. The final results were evaluated on the basis of pain, limp, limb-length discrepancy, level of physical activity, and satisfaction of the patient. Of the thirty-two patients who had an amputation, twenty-eight (88 per cent) had a satisfactory result, compared with only six (55 per cent) of the eleven patients who had limb-lengthening. The amount of inequality between the lower limbs was classified as follows: Group I--the foot of the shorter extremity was at the distal third of the contralateral, normal limb, and the percentage of shortening was 15 per cent or less; Group II--the foot of the shorter extremity was at the level of the middle third of the contralateral, normal limb, and the percentage of shortening was between 16 and 25 per cent; and Group III--the foot of the shorter extremity was at the level of the proximal third of the contralateral, normal limb, and the percentage of shortening was greater than 26 per cent. Lengthening was best suited for patients in Group I who had stable hips, knees, and ankles and a plantigrade foot. Patients in Groups II and III were best served by ablation of the foot and fitting of a prosthesis.\r"

Eighteen patients (twenty-seven knees) were considered moderately obese and twelve patients (twenty-seven knees), severely obese. The results in all but four knees were rated excellent or good. One patient needed a revision procedure for late infection, and the result was rated poor. Three results were rated fair. There was no discernible difference in the over-all scores among the five weight groups. However, 30 per cent of the knees of the moderately and severely obese patients had patellofemoral symptoms, whereas the incidence was 14 per cent in the other groups (p less than 0.03). No clear-cut association was found between obesity and either thrombophlebitis or complications related to the wound.\r"

  ".W": "During the period between November 1986 and November 1988, 13 consecutive patients with Stanford type A aortic dissection (8 acute and 5 chronic) were treated as follows: (1) urgent operation for cases with pericardial tamponade or severe heart failure, (2) initial medical treatment followed by elective operation for acute but stable cases or chronic cases, and (3) routine use of open distal anastomosis or selective cerebral perfusion. One patient died during medical treatment: 5 patients were operated on emergently. The remaining 2 acute and 5 chronic cases were operated on electively. There were no operative deaths, neurological disturbances, or late deaths. It is suggested that acute dissection of the ascending aorta requires immediate surgical intervention, especially when the entry is in the ascending aorta. On the other hand, it is also suggested that one could avoid emergency operations in selected cases with retrograde extension of the aortic dissection.\r"
