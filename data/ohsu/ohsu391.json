  ".W": "Insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) may be mediated in part by an autoimmune mechanism, as suggested by associated cytologic and serologic phenomena, e.g., insulitis, beta-cell necrosis, and the presence of both islet cell and insulin antibodies. Immunological approaches to the prediction and intervention in the progression of beta-cell destruction in this disease are under evaluation. A recent hypothesis is that cytokines, including interleukin 1 (IL-1), play causative roles in such autoimmune processes. Several studies have convincingly demonstrated that IL-1 is a potent modulator of beta-cell function and can potentiate or inhibit glucose-induced insulin secretion, depending on the concentration and length of exposure to IL-1. IL-1 alone or in concert with other cytokines is cytotoxic to beta-cells. The cellular mechanisms responsible for the potent effects of IL-1 on the beta-cell are unknown and just beginning to emerge. Although speculative at this time, this perspective delineates cellular mechanisms that are likely to represent possible primary sites for the IL-1 action on beta-cells. A mechanistic understanding of the effects of IL-1 on the beta-cell may clarify its role in modulating insulin release in vivo or yield insight into the pathogenesis of IDDM.\r"

  ".W": "Hepatic receptors are normally exposed to discrete pulses of insulin and glucagon at intervals of 8 to 16 min. Using a multicolumn system for perifusing hepatocytes, we investigated the effect of this pattern on the normal processing of the insulin receptor. Surface-receptor binding was measured in acid-washed cells harvested from individual columns. The number of high-affinity surface receptors fell to a nadir 1 min after the end of a 3-min square-wave pulse of insulin. The maximum reduction reached 45% of baseline at amplitudes of 1000 microU/ml or above. The number of surface binding sites returned to baseline 15 min after the end of the pulse, but the affinity constant of the high-affinity receptor was unchanged. The reduction of surface binding was dose dependent, with an ED50 of 251 +/- 34 microU/ml. Prolonging the pulse to 60 min did not affect the nadir or the rate of restoration of the surface-receptor population. The change in surface binding was reduced at 15 degrees C and abolished at 4 degrees C. After a pulse, the pattern of change was a period of rapid decline to a nadir (t1/2 less than or equal to 1 min) that persisted for 3-5 min, followed by restoration of surface binding that reached baseline in 10-15 min. This same pattern was present after six ED95 pulses delivered at intervals of 15 min. These data indicate that the internalization of hepatocyte surface receptors and their recycling and reinsertion into the plasma membrane can be entrained to pulses at the physiologic pulse frequency.\r"

Pantothenic acid uptake rates were also reduced in 48-h STZ-D rats (118.0 +/- 6.1 nmol.g-1 dry wt.30 min-1, compared to 158.2 +/- 5.3 in control rats). The decrease in pantothenic acid uptake in all diabetic animals occurred whether hearts were perfused with 1.2 mM palmitate or 1.2 mM palmitate and 11 mM glucose. If insulin (500 microU/ml) was added to the perfusion medium of hearts from spontaneously diabetic rats perfused with palmitate and glucose, a significant increase in pantothenic acid uptake was noted (from 110.8 +/- 10.6 to 167.0 +/- 9.4 nmol.g-1 dry wt.30 min-1). Insulin had no significant effect on pantothenic acid uptake in hearts from spontaneously diabetic rats perfused with palmitate alone. In STZ-D rats, insulin added to hearts perfused with palmitate and glucose resulted in a small but significant increase in pantothenic acid uptake (from 118.0 +/- 6.1 to 130.6 +/- 4.0 nmol.g-1 dry wt.30 min-1). Insulin had no effect on pantothenic acid uptake in control hearts perfused either in the presence or absence of glucose. These data suggest that insulin, in the presence of glucose, can increase pantothenic acid uptake in diabetic rats.\r"

In this study we examined the influence of continuous subcutaneous insulin on the progression of established nephropathy in streptozocin-induced diabetic rats. Normal controls and diabetic rats were studied for 11 mo. During the first 6 mo, all the diabetic rats received 2 U protamine zinc insulin s.c. twice weekly. During the last 5 mo of study, diabetic rats either continued on the occasional subcutaneous insulin regimen or received regular insulin by continuous subcutaneous infusion. Six months after the initiation of the study, the diabetic rats were severely hyperglycemic, and their relative mesangial areas had increased. Continued poor glycemic control in the rats receiving occasional insulin was associated with relative increased mesangial area (25.2 +/- 1.0% of glomerular area) and significant proteinuria (148 +/- 17 mg/24 h) compared with normal controls. In contrast, the use of continuous subcutaneous insulin therapy with improved glycemic control arrested mesangial changes (19.5 +/- 1.4% of glomerular area) and prevented the excessive proteinuria (71 +/- 13 mg/24 h). Indeed, these parameters did not differ from age-matched controls. We conclude that in the rat, continuous subcutaneous insulin therapy instituted after the development of early glomerular pathology is effective in arresting the disease process.\r"

  ".W": "Insulin secretion and clearance were studied in eight normal subjects who underwent hyperglycemic clamp studies at plasma glucose levels of 120, 225, and 300 mg/dl on three occasions. Insulin secretion rates were calculated during a 1-h baseline period and during 3 h of glucose clamping from a two-compartmental analysis of peripheral C-peptide concentrations with individual kinetic parameters derived after intravenous bolus injections of biosynthetic human C-peptide. At the 300-mg/dl clamp level, the insulin secretion rate increased to a value 9.9 +/- 0.7 times that of basal at the end of the clamp (mean +/- SE), whereas over the same period, the peripheral insulin concentrations increased to a greater extent, reaching a value 15.4 +/- 1.2 times that of basal (P = .002). This greater relative increase in the insulin concentration in comparison with the corresponding insulin secretion rate suggests a reduction in the clearance of endogenous insulin. A similar trend was seen at the 225-mg/dl clamp level, but the relative increase in the insulin concentration (9.9 +/- 1.5 times that of basal) was not significantly higher than the relative increase in the insulin secretion rate (8.1 +/- 0.5 times that of basal, P = .17). At the 120-mg/dl clamp level, the relative increases in the insulin secretion rate (2.7 +/- 0.2 times that of basal) and the insulin concentration (2.4 +/- 0.2 times that of basal) were similar (P = .26), indicating no reduction in endogenous insulin clearance during moderate stimulation of insulin secretion. In conclusion, a reduction in endogenous insulin clearance occurs during greater stimulation of insulin secretion at higher glucose-clamp levels.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

By combining the organ-balance technique with the systemic infusion of L-[1-14C]leucine, we quantitated leucine production and disposal by splanchnic and leg tissues and by the whole body, simultaneously, in six normal men before and during amino acid infusion. At steady state, disposal of arterial leucine by splanchnic and leg tissues was calculated from the percent extraction (E) of L-[1-14C]leucine counts: uptake = E x [Leu]a x flow. Tissue release of cold leucine (from protein turnover) into vein was calculated as the difference between leucine uptake and the net tissue leucine balance. In the postabsorptive state, despite substantial (P less than .01) extraction of L-[1-14C]leucine by splanchnic (23 +/- 1%) and leg (18 +/- 2%) tissues, net leucine balance across both tissue beds was small, indicating active simultaneous disposal and production of leucine at nearly equivalent rates. Splanchnic tissues accounted for approximately 50% of the measured total-body leucine flux. During amino acid infusion, the net leucine balance across splanchnic and leg tissues became positive, reflecting not only an increase in leucine uptake but also a marked suppression (by approximately 50%, P less than .02) of cold leucine release. This reduction in splanchnic and leg leucine release was indicated by a sharp decline in whole-body endogenous leucine flux.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "An essential event in atherogenesis is the migration and proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs), which contributes to the fibrocellular component of the atherosclerotic intimal thickening. We have been modeling this process by studying the outgrowth of VSMC from aortic explants onto tissue-culture plastic substrate. Our hypothesis is that certain risk factors for atherosclerosis favor increases in subpopulations of cells with enhanced responsiveness to a variety of migratory and proliferative stimuli, in vivo and in vitro. As a known risk factor for atherosclerosis, diabetes might be reasonably postulated to induce such cell populations with altered susceptibility to additional noxious stimuli. We have tested this hypothesis with aortic explants from rats of the spontaneous autoimmune diabetic BB/Wor group, including diabetes-resistant, diabetes-prone, and treated acutely (less than 2 wk after onset of hyperglycemia) and chronically (greater than 2 wk) diabetic strains. As a group, the VSMCs from BB/Wor animals showed enhanced outgrowth in 0.1% serum (23-48%) compared with VSMCs from ordinary Wistar rats (less than 10%). Within the BB/Wor group, however, the rank order of enhanced outgrowth was diabetes-resistant greater than chronically diabetic greater than acutely diabetic subjects. When the outgrowth assay was performed in the presence of supplemental insulin (10 mU/ml), outgrowth was increased, especially for the diabetes-prone animals, giving a new rank order of diabetes-prone greater than acutely diabetic greater than diabetes-resistant greater than chronically diabetic subjects. These data suggest a genetic predilection in the entire BB/Wor rat group for increased VSMC responsiveness to migratory and proliferative stimuli, a sensitivity of these VSMCs to insulin, and the dissociation of this vascular cell effect from other manifestations of diabetes, e.g., hyperglycemia.\r"

  ".W": "The mechanisms by which insulin and catecholamines affect low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-receptor activity were studied in freshly isolated human mononuclear leukocytes. Incubation of cells for up to 24 h in a lipid-free medium resulted in an increase in the specific binding, accumulation, and degradation of 125I-labeled LDL. Insulin stimulated the ability of the cells to bind, accumulate, and degrade the lipoprotein with high affinity, which may be caused by an increase in the LDL-receptor number without altering binding affinity. (-)-Epinephrine inhibited the specific binding, accumulation, and degradation of 125I-LDL. This effect appears to be mediated by a decrease in the number of LDL receptors and not by a change in the binding affinity. (-)-Norepinephrine, the unspecific beta-adrenergic agonist (-)-isoproterenol, and the beta 2-specific agonist terbutaline mimicked the effect of epinephrine on LDL-receptor activity. Catecholamines and beta-adrenergic agonists yielded sigmoidal log-concentration effect curves. The action of epinephrine was attenuated by the beta-antagonist (dl)-propranolol. These results demonstrate that insulin stimulates and catecholamines suppress the specific binding, accumulation, and degradation of 125I-LDL in human mononuclear leukocytes. The catecholamine action appears to be mediated by beta 2-adrenergic receptors. A suppression of LDL-receptor activity resulting from deficiency of insulin and elevated plasma catecholamine concentrations in uncontrolled insulin-dependent diabetic patients may contribute to the increased levels of LDL cholesterol observed in these patients.\r"

Insulin content was measured in untreated serum, serum precipitated with polyethylene glycol (PEG, free insulin), and serum extracted with acid and precipitated with PEG (total insulin). The mean untreated first-phase insulin response (I1 + 3) for IAA+ patients was 172 +/- 67.3 mU/L, significantly higher than the mean control value of 108 +/- 47.5 (P less than .001). After PEG precipitation, mean I1 + 3 in the patient group fell significantly to 105 +/- 48.4 mU/L (P less than .001), but the control value was unchanged (104 +/- 45.5). The mean percentage fall after PEG precipitation was 36.9% (patients) and 2.9% (controls) (t = 8.3, P less than .001). There was a strong correlation between the IAA titer and the interference in the insulin assay (r = .81). After total insulin extraction of IAA samples, there was a significant fall in mean I1 + 3 to 134 +/- 55.4 mU/L (P less than .001), but the control value was unchanged.

To elucidate the mechanism for this effect, we have measured the kinase activity of the insulin receptor purified from livers of HF-fed rats that showed impaired insulin action in isolated rat adipocytes. In adipocyte experiments, HF feeding led to a 65% decrease in the maximal response stimulated by insulin in a 2-deoxyglucose uptake study. Although insulin binding to adipocytes of HF-fed rats also decreased to 50% of control due to decreased binding affinity, the postbinding defect should be accounted for by decreased insulin action in view of the presence of spare receptor. In contrast to adipocytes, insulin binding to the lectin-purified insulin receptor from livers showed no difference in receptor-binding affinity between HF-fed and control rats. Insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of the beta-subunit of the insulin receptor was decreased to almost 50% throughout the entire dose-response curve. The study of glutamine-tyrosine (4:1) phosphorylation by the insulin-receptor kinase showed results similar to those of the autophosphorylation study. These results suggest that an HF diet causes insulin resistance by affecting insulin-receptor kinase, which plays an important role in transmembrane signaling between insulin binding and insulin action.\r"

We characterized two hormone-producing rat islet (RIN) cell lines derived from a radiation-induced islet tumor by immunocytochemistry, Northern blot analysis, and radioimmunoassay of secreted hormone. Using antisera to glucagon, insulin, and somatostatin, we found that less than 15% of the cells in any of these three islet cell lines contained immunopositive cells. The number of cells staining for the hormone correlated with mRNA levels and immunoreactive secreted hormones. Sodium butyrate, a short-chain aliphatic fatty acid, slowed cell growth and increased dramatically the percentage of cells staining for glucagon and insulin. The increase in immunopositive cells was accompanied by an increase in glucagon and insulin mRNAs and secreted glucagon and insulin. These observations indicate that sodium butyrate increases glucagon and insulin gene expression by recruiting previously immunonegative cells to produce hormone. The relationship of DNA synthesis and hormone production was assessed by pulse-labeling RIN cells with [3H]thymidine, which was followed by autoradiography and immunocytochemistry. [3H]thymidine incorporation was observed in a lower percentage of immunopositive compared with immunonegative cells. Furthermore, sodium butyrate reduced the number of [3H]thymidine-labeled cells and increased the number of immunopositive cells. These observations suggest that sodium butyrate differentiates the islet cells and thereby increases the expression of the glucagon and insulin genes.\r"

We show that enhanced levels of MHC class I heavy-chain RNA are present in pancreatic islets before overt inflammation and the onset of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) in the spontaneously diabetic BB rat. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed enhanced class I antigen expression throughout the pancreatic islets of newly diabetic animals but no induction of class II antigen on endocrine cells within the islet. Varying degrees of inflammatory infiltrate were observed in the sections exhibiting enhanced class I antigen expression or in nearby serial sections. Southern blot analysis revealed no restriction-fragment-length polymorphism or amplification of the endogenous class I heavy-chain genes compared with those of seroidentical disease-resistant Wistar-Furth rats. I-A alpha and I-E alpha hybridizing RNA appeared de novo before overt diabetes, although concomitantly with T-lymphocyte-receptor beta-chain and interferon-gamma gene hybridizing RNA and after MHC class I heavy-chain RNA enhancement was observed.

To assess the possible role of autoimmunity, the expression of a 64,000-Mr islet antigen in SJL/J and CD1 mice infected with a diabetogenic strain of CB4 was monitored in early and late infection. Additionally, virus-induced abnormalities in glucose metabolism were correlated with several changes in purified islets to assess beta-cell physiology. Over 80% of the mice exhibited subnormal blood glucose at 72 h postinfection (p.i.) and were hyperglycemic at 6 and 8 wk p.i. Islet yield in infected mice decreased by 29-47% at 72 h and 6 wk p.i. compared to noninfected mice. Insulin release stimulated by 16.7 mM glucose increased greater than twofold at 72 h p.i. but declined at 6 wk well below the level of noninfected mice. Likewise, residual islet insulin content after release also increased at 72 h and then declined. Total protein synthesis in the islets decreased by 30% at 72 h and by 60% at 6 wk p.i. Although the synthesis of five proteins of heterogeneous molecular weights, including tubulin, was severely depressed in the infected islets at 72 h p.i. compared with control islets or islets at 6 wk p.i., synthesis of the 64,000-Mr component and another protein of 36,000 Mr increased by two- to threefold. It is possible that CB4 infection may initiate or enhance an autoimmune reaction by increased expression of the 64,000-Mr antigen.\r"

  ".W": "We demonstrated previously that the conversion rate of proinsulin to insulin in pancreatic islets progressively increased after prolonged prior exposure to glucose (11 mM) and that this effect could be blocked by cycloheximide. This study was designed to characterize further the time course and regulation of the proinsulin conversion process. The effects of prior exposure to glucose on proinsulin conversion were dose dependent (Km, approximately 7 mM glucose) and time dependent, taking approximately 3 h to reach the maximum rate. Glucose added at or after the subsequent [3H]leucine pulse was ineffective. Mannoheptulose, added during a 3-h exposure with glucose (11 mM), prevented glucose-induced activation of the proinsulin conversion process. L-Leucine (20 mM) was as effective as 11 mM glucose in activating conversion, whereas 2-alpha-ketoisocaproic acid (20 mM) or phorbol ester (50 nM) had little effect. Activation of proinsulin conversion by a 24-h exposure to glucose (11 mM) was reversed by a subsequent 3-h prior exposure to cycloheximide. alpha-Amanitin, an inhibitor of mRNA synthesis, did not influence the glucose-induced activation of proinsulin conversion when present during a 3-h exposure to glucose; however, it completely inhibited glucose-stimulated conversion when present during 24 h exposure. Results suggest that activation of the proinsulin conversion process is regulated by glucose metabolism rather than the glucose molecule per se and that other, but not all, secretagogues are effective. Conversion may require prior synthesis of a pool of converting enzyme(s) or other regulatory proteins whose turnover is relatively rapid (approximately 33 h) and whose mRNA is more stable (to 24 h).\r"

  ".W": "The influence of L 364718 on islet responsiveness to sulfated cholecystokinin (CCK-8S) was investigated. In islets whose inositol-containing phospholipids were prelabeled during a 2-h incubation period, subsequent exposure to L 364718 (1 nM) significantly impaired the secretion of insulin usually noted in response to 200 nM CCK-8S in the simultaneous presence of 7 mM glucose. A higher level of the antagonist (10 nM) completely abolished insulin secretion. L 364718 (1-10 nM) reduced the efflux of 3H from myo-[2-3H]-inositol prelabeled islets in parallel with the reduction in secretion. L 364718 (10 nM) significantly reduced the accumulation of 3H-containing inositol phosphates usually noted with CCK-8S addition. L 364718, at levels 10- to 100-fold greater than those necessary to attenuate CCK-8S-induced insulin secretion, had no adverse effect on the insulin secretory response of freshly isolated islets to 10 mM glucose alone, 5 mM D-glyceraldehyde, 15 mM alpha-ketoisocaproate, or 50 ng/ml gastric inhibitory polypeptide. L 364718 (1000 nM) had no adverse influence on carbamylcholine (1 mM)-induced phosphoinositide hydrolysis. These results establish L 364718 as a potent and highly selective antagonist of cholecystokinin's stimulatory actions on beta-cells. Because of its potency, selectivity, and oral effectiveness, in vivo studies with L 364718, aimed at unraveling the pleiotropic effects of CCK-8S on glucose and insulin homeostasis, seem feasible.\r"

We have crossed spontaneously diabetic male rats bearing the recombinant RT1r8 haplotype with female rats of the AC1.1r4 congenic strain. Three diabetic rats were determined to be homozygous for the r4 haplotype by serotyping. The absence of recombination within the MHC was confirmed by inspection of restriction-fragment-length patterns of the diabetic animals and the parental strains. In conjunction with previous breeding studies, this study maps the diabetes susceptibility gene to the right of the RT1-A locus and to the left of the RT1-C locus. A low incidence of diabetes in the F2 (4.5%) emphasizes the multifactorial nature of the susceptibility. The presence of depressed responsiveness of peripheral blood lymphocytes to concanavalin A stimulation increases the prevalence of the overt disease. An unusual feature of the diabetic syndrome in this study is the sparse or absent pancreatic lymphocytic inflammatory response, with true insulitis being a rare finding.\r"

In the present study, we evaluated the efficacy of liver cell transplantation in providing metabolic support during acute liver insufficiency induced by 90% partial hepatectomy in rats. Ninety per cent of the liver mass (all lobes except the caudate lobe) was resected, and the rats were provided with 5% dextrose orally ad libitum upon regaining consciousness. This regimen results in severe hypoglycemia and death within 48 hr. When microcarrier-attached liver cells were transplanted into syngeneic and allogeneic recipients 3 days prior to 90% partial hepatectomy, significantly higher blood glucose levels were observed (p less than 0.01), compared to the levels in control rats which received injections of microcarriers, liver cells or medium alone. There was a marked improvement in long-term survival (40% survived longer than 28 days; p less than 0.001) in rats transplanted with microcarriers-attached cells. None of the rats given injections of microcarriers, liver cells or medium alone survived beyond 5 days. When liver cells alone or attached to microcarriers were injected intraperitoneally immediately after 90% partial hepatectomy, all rats became hypoglycemic and died within 48 hr, suggesting that vascularization of the transplant is required for function of the transplanted hepatocytes. The results indicate that intraperitoneal transplantation of microcarrier-attached hepatocytes prior to 90% partial hepatectomy in rats provides acute metabolic support resulting in improved survival.\r"

When hepatocytes were cultured alone in a hormonally defined serum-free medium, decreased albumin production and rapid morphological deterioration of bile canaliculi structures and gap junctions occurred within 4 to 5 days. In contrast, hepatocytes cocultured with liver mesenchymal cells remained morphologically intact and biochemically functional for at least 4 weeks. They reorganized into small islands, continued to secrete high levels of albumin, did not express alpha-fetoprotein (a fetal marker), and remained strongly dye coupled. All of the hepatocytes synthesized albumin and retained their gap junctional channels. No junctional communication was observed between hepatocytes and endothelial cells. Long fibers containing fibronectin, Type I collagen and laminin distributed over the hepatocytes were induced in coculture but never appeared in hepatocytes cultured alone. Moreover, supplementation of the hormonally defined medium with phenobarbital and dimethyl sulfoxide, both of which improve the life span and functional activities of cultured hepatocytes, failed to induce reticulin fiber formation in pure culture of hepatocytes. The modulation of albumin secretion, biomatrix deposition and junctional communication observed in hepatocytes cultured with sinusoidal liver cells was also obtained when hepatocytes were in association with various epithelial or mesenchymal cells [rat liver epithelial cells (T51B), mouse embryonic fibroblasts (NIH 3T3), human or rat dermal fibroblasts and bovine aorta endothelial cells (AG 4762)].\r"

Cytokeratin antigen was demonstrated in fixed, paraffin-embedded liver tissue by an avidin-biotin peroxidase method using a mixture of two different monoclonal antibodies, AE1 (acidic; 48, 50 and 56.5 kD) and AE3 (basic; 52, 56, 58 and 65 to 67 kD). In contrast to the normal liver, in which only bile duct epithelium was positive, this antibody mixture stained both bile ducts and hepatocytes in pathologic livers. Serum levels of vitamin A showed a significant inverse correlation with the amount of cytokeratin antigen (scale: 0 to 3) in hepatocytes without Mallory bodies (p = 0.001), in Mallory body-containing hepatocytes (p less than 0.0001) and in bile ducts (p = 0.0074). Increased amount of cytokeratin antigen in each of these locations, in turn, correlated directly with the histologic severity of the liver disease. Histologic severity (fibrosis, parenchymal degeneration/necrosis, hepatocyte regeneration and inflammation) was significantly higher in patients when either Mallory bodies (p less than 0.0001) or cytokeratin antigen (p = 0.0021) was present in hepatocytes. Demonstration of cytokeratin antigen in hepatocytes which contained Mallory bodies correlated positively (p = 0.03) with clinical severity of the liver disease as determined by high serum bilirubin and prolonged prothrombin time (Maddrey's discriminant function).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Weight loss is correlated with a specific decrease in collagen synthesis in extrahepatic tissues, mainly through modulation of mRNA levels. Here, we investigated the response to weight loss in the rat liver. Male rats were either fed ad libitum or fasted for 92 hr; fasted animals lost approximately 20% of their initial body weight. Following i.p. injection of [5-3H]proline, hepatic collagen was extracted and de novo collagen production was measured. There was a decrease in the specific radioactivities of purified hepatic collagen (-75%) and albumin (-70%) relative to total hepatic protein, indicating that production of both of these proteins was specifically decreased. In fasted animals, the absolute hepatic collagen production was markedly decreased (-60%), while changes in absolute hepatic protein production were small (-15%). Using hybridization with specific DNA probes, we found that fasting causes about a 70% decrease in albumin mRNA, but the quantities of hepatic procollagen alpha 1(I) and alpha 2(I) mRNAs were unchanged. These results are consistent with regulation of albumin production during fasting by modulation of mRNA levels. The inhibition of hepatic collagen production in fasted animals, however, appears to be modulated at a posttranscriptional level or may result from increased degradation. This response differs from the pretranslational regulation of collagen synthesis in extrahepatic tissues during fasting. Furthermore, our results suggest that decreased body weight could be a potentially complicating variable in studies of collagen metabolism and fibrogenesis in the liver.\r"

Antibodies to pre-S1 region product of IgM and/or IgA class were detected invariably in six patients who still had detectable hepatitis B surface antigen in serum at the time of clinical presentation. The remaining five patients who had lost HBsAg at presentation had antibodies to pre-S region products of various immunoglobulin classes in higher titers. The five patients with fulminant hepatitis without HBsAg had higher levels of IgA antibodies to pre-S region products than the seven patients with nonfulminant acute hepatitis B who had lost HBsAg: IgA antibody to pre-S1 region product (75.6 +/- 63.8 vs. 2.9 +/- 3.2, p less than 0.01) and IgA antibody to pre-S2 region product (28.9 +/- 25.3 vs. 4.2 +/- 6.9, p less than 0.01). IgA antibodies to pre-S1 and pre-S2 region products were invariably polymeric in fulminant hepatitis B. These findings are compatible with the hypothesis that a heightened humoral antibody response to pre-S1 and pre-S2 region products occurs early during the course of fulminant hepatitis B, participating in severe hepatic injury and early clearance of virus characteristic of this disease.\r"

In addition, immunocytochemical assay for the detection of ras p21 or c-myc protein was performed in combination with in situ hybridization for hepatitis B virus DNA/RNA using 35S-labeled hepatitis B virus DNA as a probe. Investigation of a total of 14 paired human hepatocellular carcinoma and adjacent nontumorous hepatic tissues revealed enhanced expression of ras p21 in one human hepatocellular carcinoma whereas c-myc protein was found in one paired human hepatocellular carcinoma and nontumorous tissue of the same patient. Only a small proportion of human hepatocellular carcinoma cells or hepatocytes among a large number of cells on a given section showed enhanced expression, and the distribution of the oncogene product-expressing cells was focal. However, the cells overexpressing these oncogenes did not show hepatitis B surface antigen in the serial sections. Furthermore, the combined immunocytochemical and in situ hybridization assays revealed that human hepatocellular carcinoma cells overexpressing ras p21 did not show hepatitis B virus DNA/RNA, whereas some human hepatocellular carcinoma cells and nontumorous hepatocytes located away from the foci of oncogene-expressing cells gave positive signals. These findings suggest that continued expression of HBsAg or the presence of hepatitis B virus DNA/RNA in a given human hepatocellular carcinoma cell id not necessary for enhanced expression of ras or c-myc proteins.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The role of epidermal growth factor on liver regeneration after partial hepatectomy in rats was investigated. After a 70% hepatectomy in rats, the concentration of epidermal growth factor in portal venous blood was unchanged compared with unoperated controls. However, small amounts of epidermal growth factor could be identified in portal venous blood after intestinal instillation of epidermal growth factor. Brunner's glands and the submandibular glands secrete epidermal growth factor. Extirpation of Brunner's glands decreased liver regeneration, whereas removal of the submandibular glands had no effect on liver regeneration. Epidermal growth factor antiserum reduced liver regeneration significantly. Oral or s.c. administration of epidermal growth factor had no effect on liver regeneration, whereas epidermal growth factor enhanced the effect of insulin and glucagon on liver regeneration. The results suggest that endogenous epidermal growth factor participates in stimulation of liver regeneration after partial hepatectomy in rats. Epidermal growth factor given together with insulin and glucagon had a synergistic effect on liver regeneration which suggests that liver regeneration in the rat is controlled by multiple regulatory peptides.\r"

  ".W": "Cellular analysis of hepatic alpha-fetoprotein gene expression in normal adult rat and during regeneration induced by partial hepatectomy was performed at the cellular level by in situ hybridization using 35S-labeled complementary DNA probes and immunoperoxidase techniques. In normal adult rat liver sections, a few alpha-fetoprotein mRNA-cDNA hybrids are detected over all hepatocytes. No protein is detected with routine immunoperoxidase methods. However, after in vivo colchicine blockade of alpha-fetoprotein secretion, 10 to 20% alpha-fetoprotein-positive hepatocytes are observed. In regenerating livers, at 2,6 and 24 hr (before and at the time of the peak of DNA synthesis in the periportal zones), a rise of the nuclear signal level is observed selectively in periportal hepatocytes, without modification of the cytoplasmic signal. At 48 hr (when most hepatocytes have completed at least one replicative cycle), almost all hepatocytes throughout the liver lobule display a rise of the nuclear (2- to 3-fold) and cytoplasmic (1.5- to 2-fold) signal level compared to nonoperated rats. These data show that all hepatocytes in the adult liver express a small number of alpha-fetoprotein mRNA sequences; they appear to be translated in protein whose secretion can be blocked by colchicine. The moderate increase in alpha-fetoprotein gene expression induced by liver regeneration takes place in all hepatocytes, in apparently two distinct steps: a very early nuclear accumulation of alpha-fetoprotein mRNA sequences and a late cytoplasmic accumulation of alpha-fetoprotein mRNA molecules.\r"

  ".W": "With positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP)-induced reduction in cardiac output, measurement of ventricular filling pressure assists in proper therapeutic decision-making. Because PEEP may increase pleural and juxtacardiac pressure, central venous pressure (CVP) and left atrial pressure (LAP) measurements during PEEP may not simply reflect ventricular filling, but rather reflect the sum of intracardiac and extracardiac forces. Monitoring devices placed within the central circulation use saline solution-filled lumens and transducer systems for pressure monitoring. Therefore, any device designed to estimate the extracardiac influence of PEEP on intraluminal monitoring devices would be expected to reflect such changes best when the device is also filled with saline solution. In the present study, esophageal pressure (Pes) was measured with a saline solution-filled balloon-equipped nasogastric tube to estimate the extracardiac influence of PEEP on CVP and LAP. Pes, CVP, LAP, and cardiac index (CI) were measured in 17 patients subjected to 0, 5, 10, 15, 20 cm H2O PEEP. Comparing 0 with 20 cm H2O PEEP, CVP (7 +/- 1.0 mm Hg to 13.4 +/- 1.3 mm Hg), LAP (6.3 +/- 1.1 mm Hg to 11.7 +/- 1.4 mm Hg), and Pes (6.1 +/- 1.4 mm Hg to 12.1 +/- 1.5 mm Hg) all increased significantly as CI fell (2.72 +/- 0.14 L/min/m2 to 2.20 +/- 0.15 L/min/m2).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Orthotopic cardiac transplantation has become the treatment of choice for selected patients with end-stage heart disease. Proliferation of cardiac transplantation centers and relaxed selection criteria have resulted in increasing populations of transplant candidates and recipients. As these numbers continue to grow, so too do the numbers of nursing personnel who must respond to the intricacies and demands of cardiac transplantation. Nursing care begins with physiologic and psychologic support of a patient with terminal cardiac disease and continues throughout the transplantation evaluation, waiting, surgical, postoperative, and outpatient periods. In addition to routine postsurgical care, the nurse involved in cardiac transplantation needs to be familiar with the function of a denervated heart, as well as with the effects of unbalanced immunosuppression and immunocompetence. The surge of organ transplantation in the last several years has brought about administrative concerns regarding the financial impact of increasing numbers of transplantations, as well as an inadequate supply of necessary donor organs. This critical shortage of suitable donors demands that nurses and other health care professionals become active in enlarging the donor organ pool by identifying potential organ donors, maintaining optimal hemodynamics and oxygenation so as to ensure organ viability, and providing emotional support of the grieving family.\r"

  ".W": "Patients undergoing cardiac surgery are mildly hypothermic by the completion of the surgical procedure. They need to return to a normothermic state if enzymatic functions are to proceed in their normal manner. The body can produce heat by elevating metabolic rate or by activating the shivering mechanism. Metabolic rate peaks shortly after separation of the patient from cardiopulmonary bypass, and therefore contributes to heat production. Because of the effects of neuromuscular blockage administered both during and after surgery; these patients may be unable to generate heat by shivering, and shivering is usually undesirable. This eliminates the major heat production mechanism available to the body. Therefore, heat must be transferred down its gradient by means of convection and conduction. External and internal methods accomplish these goals. External methods, which minimize additional heat loss, include the use of warming lights, elevation of room temperature, and the use of blankets. Internal methods, which transfer heat by convection, may be used to help actively reverse hypothermia. Such techniques include warmed inhalation gases and intravenous fluids, warmed nasogastric lavage fluid, and warmed peritoneal dialysis fluid for patients with end-stage renal failure with severe electrolyte disorders after surgery.\r"

BV is fast becoming the treatment of choice for isolated valvular pulmonary stenosis (IVPS) in pediatric patients. IVPS and other obstructive lesions involving the right ventricle and pulmonary arteries occur in 25% to 30% of all persons with congenital heart disease. Current data suggest that use of BV for IVPS provides both short- and long-term hemodynamic relief and eliminates the need for open heart surgery. BV is also being used for other forms of congenital heart disease. Therefore, it is important for nurses in the pediatric setting to be aware of this technique and its implications. We review the anatomy, physiology, and clinical features of IVPS, the valvuloplasty procedure, and the nursing plan of care relevant to it.\r"

However, in a series of 463 consecutive replacement procedures that were performed between 1973 and 1985, in only two patients did the lack of bone make the implantation of a glenoid component impossible. Of the remaining sixty-five shoulders that had an abnormal glenoid, twenty were successfully treated with a large, internally fixed bone graft or grafts and forty-five, with smaller bone grafts that were not internally fixed. Nineteen of the twenty shoulders that had a large graft or grafts were followed for two years or more (average, 4.4 years). The clinical results were judged to be excellent in sixteen and satisfactory in one, and the desired limited goals were obtained in two. Two fixation screws broke and one screw was worn by contact with the humeral component. None of the glenoid components clinically loosened or migrated, and no patient has needed further surgical treatment. Although bone-grafting was necessary in only twenty (4.3 per cent) of the 463 replacement procedures, this procedure provided sufficient osseous support to allow implantation of a component in a severely damaged glenoid.\r"

Furthermore, the relative merits of one treatment modality over another have not been demonstrated. This study reviews 262 patients with uncomplicated, thermal partial-thickness burns. All of these patients were treated with either a petrolatum fine-mesh gauze (FMG = 102), a topical penetrating antibacterial agent (TPA = 58), or a topical nonpenetrating antibacterial agent (TNA = 102). The size of the injury along with its location and etiology, the age of the patient, the time from injury to treatment, and comorbid factors were comparable among the major treatment groups. On follow-up, a wound was classified as infected if it exhibited erythema, tenderness, increased warmth, and edema (cellulitis). Infection rates were 2.0% (2/102) in the FMG group, 5.2% (3/58) in the TPA group, and 2.0% (2/102) in the TNA group. The differences among the rates did not reach statistical significance (P = 0.41). Given the cost of treatment, frequency of dressing changes and overall patient comfort, we advocate FMG as the optimal method for the care of uncomplicated partial-thickness outpatient burns.\r"

  ".W": "We recently reported that the insulin-like growth factor II (IGF-II)/mannose-6-phosphate (Man-6-P) receptor is present in fetal and postnatal rat serum and that its serum content declined dramatically postnatally between days 20 and 40 . We now provide evidence that the IGF-II/Man-6-P receptor is also present in monkey serum. Serum was gel filtered on Sephadex G-200, and the column fractions were assayed for binding of radiolabeled IGF-II. There was significant binding of [125I]IGF-II to the void volume fractions in addition to binding to the 150K and 40K carrier proteins. Binding to the void volume fractions was greatest in cord serum and decreased with age. Competitive binding studies with [125I]IGF-II and the void volume pools from monkey serum demonstrated that IGF-I competed less potently than IGF-II, and insulin did not compete. Radiolabeled IGF-I did not bind specifically to the void volume pools. Chemical cross-linking of [125I]IGF-II to aliquots of the void volume pools from monkey cord serum samples and analysis with sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of dithiothreitol demonstrated a specific band at about 240K. Western blotting using a specific antiserum (no. 3637) against rat IGF-II/Man-6-P receptor was performed on aliquots of the Sephadex G-200 void volume pools of monkey serum. A band of approximately the same size as that found with human fibroblast members (approximately 215 K without dithiothreitol) was detected. The IGF-II/Man-6-P receptor band was more intense in cord serum than in the postnatal samples. When cord serum Sephadex G-200 pools were gel filtered on Sephadex G-50 in 1 mol/L acetic acid to separate binding components from free IGF, and IGF-II was measured by RRA, approximately 20% of the circulating IGF-II was found to be associated with this IGF-II/Man-6-P receptor in monkey serum. We conclude that the IGF-II/Man-6-P receptor present in serum may be a significant carrier for IGF-II in the monkey.\r"

Bone mineral content in the forearm (measured by single photon absorptiometry) and in the spine (measured by dual photon absorptiometry) significantly decreased after 6 months of treatment with 400 micrograms nafarelin, but 6 months after termination of treatment all bone mineral measurements had returned to pretreatment levels. The bone mineral measurements in the 200 micrograms group did not change throughout the study. In both treatment groups the biochemical estimates of bone turnover increased significantly to postmenopausal levels. Withdrawal of treatment resulted in an abrupt decrease in the bone resorption parameters (fasting urinary hydroxyproline to creatinine and calcium to creatinine excretion ratios and serum phosphate), whereas there was a protracted fall in the bone formation parameters (plasma bone Gla protein and serum alkaline phosphatase) 6 months after termination of treatment. Our findings demonstrate that nafarelin in both doses increased biochemical indices of bone turnover, that 400 micrograms/day nafarelin resulted in a significant decrease in bone mineral content, and that these effects were reversible.\r"

  ".U": "88331311\r", 
  ".W": "The secretory responsiveness of human fetal pancreatic endocrine cells was studied by perifusion of cultured islet-like cell clusters (ICC). ICC were obtained from 7 fetuses at 13-15 weeks gestation and 21 fetuses at 17-22 weeks gestation. The ICC were challenged with glucose (20 mmol/L), arginine (10 mmol/L), glucagon (1.4 mumol/L), and theophylline (10 mmol/L) combined with zero, low (2 mmol/L), or high (20 mmol/L) glucose. At 13-15 weeks, glucose and arginine enhanced insulin release in some experiments, whereas glucagon and theophylline were always potent stimuli (mean response, 4-fold regardless of the glucose concentration). At 17-22 weeks, both glucose alone (20 mmol/L) and arginine (10 mmol/L, with 2 mmol/L glucose) induced a small (1.4- to 1.5-fold) increase in insulin release. When arginine was combined with 20 mmol/L glucose, the response was potentiated to become a 2.3-fold increase. In contrast, glucagon was equally effective in 2 and 20 mmol/L glucose (2.9- and 2.6-fold responses, respectively) and produced a half-maximal response even in the absence of glucose. In this age range the most potent stimulus for insulin release was clearly theophylline. The effect of theophylline was also remarkably independent of the glucose concentration of the perifusate (5.6-, 8.1-, and 8.6-fold responses at 0, 2, and 20 mmol/L glucose, respectively). Glucagon release from the ICC of the 17- to 22-week-old fetuses was low (mean basal glucagon release, 2.9; insulin, 24.8 fmol/100 ICC/min). Glucagon release was not affected by 20 mmol/L glucose, but was stimulated by arginine and theophylline. These findings suggest that in the fetal pancreas, in contrast to the adult organ, insulin release results from elevation of intracellular cAMP concentrations (by glucagon or theophylline) relatively independent of the exogenous glucose concentration. Therefore, glucagon may have an important role in regulating insulin release during the early development of human fetal B-cells.\r"

The glucose production dose-response curves for the two obese groups were shifted to the right at all levels of portal insulinemia. The upper body obese women had a greater rightward shift compared to the lower body obese women. The peripheral glucose utilization dose-response curve was shifted to the right in the lower body obese women, but maximal glucose utilization was normal. The upper body obese women had both a greater rightward shift and a marked reduction in maximal glucose utilization. The insulin concentrations that had half-maximal effects on glucose production and utilization were similar in each group. These results indicate that the liver is not inherently more sensitive to insulin than peripheral tissues. Obesity is associated with a moderate diminution of hepatic and peripheral insulin sensitivity. Upper body fat localization in obese women is characterized by a greater diminution in insulin sensitivity and decline in peripheral insulin responsivity than is lower body fat localization. The marked peripheral insulin resistance in the former group may account for the increased prevalence of glucose intolerance.\r"

  ".W": "During the preclinical period of human insulin-dependent diabetes, both impaired pancreatic beta-cell function and increased insulin resistance are found, although normoglycemia is preserved. To better understand the changes in beta-cell function and insulin sensitivity that occur in preclinical insulin-dependent diabetes, we performed a panel of in vivo beta-cell function tests and measured insulin sensitivity in adolescent male baboons both in normal health and after a small dose of streptozocin which did not induce hyperglycemia. Nine animals were studied before (stage 1) and 1 week after receiving a low dose of streptozocin (stage 2). There was no change in fasting plasma glucose or insulin. The mean glucose disposal rate (Kg) remained within the normal range, but dropped from 2.0 +/- 0.2% +/- SE) to 1.2 +/- 0.1%/min (P less than 0.01), the acute insulin response to arginine (AIR(arg)) fell from 67.7 +/- 19.4 microU/mL (485.8 +/- 139.2 pmol/L) to 32.8 +/- 7.2 microU/mL (235.3 +/- 51.7 pmol/L; P less than 0.05), and the acute insulin response to glucose (AIR(gluc)) fell from 881 +/- 243 microU/mL.10 min (6321 +/- 1744 pmol/L.10 min) to 334 +/- 82 microU/mL.10 min (2396 +/- 588 pmol/L.10 min; P less than 0.01). The most dramatic change, however, was in the ability of hyperglycemia to potentiate AIR(arg) (expressed as the slope of potentiation). This was reduced by 94% from 1.8 +/- 0.5 to 0.1 +/- 0.1 (P less than 0.01), with almost no overlap in values between stages 1 and 2. Insulin sensitivity was also lower 1 week after streptozocin treatment. When the animals were restudied 8 weeks after streptozocin treatment (stage 3) most measures of beta-cell function were not significantly different from those in stage 1. The fasting plasma glucose level was 85.4 +/- 4.3 mg/dL (4.7 +/- 0.2 mmol/L), Kg was 1.8 +/- 0.3%/min, fasting plasma insulin was 35.9 +/- 8.5 microU/mL (257.6 +/- 61.0 pmol/L), AIR(arg) was 67.0 +/- 15.4 microU/mL (480.7 +/- 110.5 pmol/L), and AIR(gluc) was 615.3 +/- 265.3 microU/mL.10 min (4413 +/- 1901 pmol/L.10 min), and tissue insulin sensitivity was 2.7 +/- 0.4 x 10(4) min/microU.mL. These values show extensive overlap with those of stage 1, from which they are not significantly different. The slope of glucose potentiation, however, remained low in all animals at stage 3.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

The relative contribution of mineralocorticoid (type I) and type II receptor activation to changes in urinary Na+ and K+ excretion in man was studied using spironolactone and RU486 to inhibit type I and II receptors, respectively. Normal men eating a constant daily diet received either ACTH or cortisol for 5 days. Spironolactone (400 mg/day) inhibited ACTH (80 U/day)-induced kaliuresis, but not the Na+ retention produced by ACTH or cortisol (240 mg/day) and only blunted the modest Na+ retention induced by cortisol (120 mg/day). RU486 (1200 mg/day for the first 2 day) inhibited the first day kaliuresis and carbohydrate intolerance produced by cortisol, but did not affect the Na+ retention. Thus, the kaliuresis produced by cortisol and ACTH can be attributed to type II and type I receptor activation, respectively. The failure of RU486 to inhibit the Na+ retention induced by cortisol with evidence of adequate blockade of type II receptors indicates that the Na+ retention produced by cortisol is not mediated by type II receptor activation, but is, at least in part, mediated by the type I receptor.\r"

However, such RIAs are insensitive and often detect inactive PTH fragments, so that the correlation between PTH immunoreactivity and bioactivity is poor. Employing a new intact PTH immunoradiometric assay (Allegro-Nichols), we reassessed the effects of pregnancy on parathyroid function. The mean serum PTH level in 81 pregnant women was 14.4 +/- 6.3 (+/- SD) compared to 24.8 +/- 9.0 ng/L in 11 normally cycling nonpregnant women (P less than 0.001). The mean serum total and ionized calcium levels in the 2 groups were similar. In 5 of the pregnant women, serum bioactive PTH, determined by cytochemical bioassay, was slightly lower (7.7 +/- 3.4 ng/L) than in normal individuals (11.1 +/- 1.9 ng/L). Our findings suggest, in contrast with the results of most previous studies, that serum intact PTH may decline during pregnancy.\r"

By differential centrifugation of adrenal capsules, we found renin mainly in mitochondrial fractions. By Percoll density gradient centrifugation of this fraction, dense granules were separated from mitochondria and microsomes. The renin activity in the dense granules from the capsules of nephrectomized rats was 15 times greater than that of the intact rat. Immunohistochemical studies revealed that the dense granules increased in number after bilateral nephrectomy. Immunogold staining of these granules showed unequivocally the presence of renin in these granules. Adrenal capsules in organ culture were found to release renin at a steady rate. Renin release from bilaterally nephrectomized rat adrenals was 46 times faster than from the organs of intact animals. The mechanism of the control of renin secretion from the adrenal gland was different from the kidney in that the secretion was stimulated by potassium chloride (10 mM) or angiotensin II (10(-9)-10(-7) M) but not by ACTH (10(-9)-10(-7) M), suggesting stimulation by intracellular calcium. These results provide evidence that the adrenal synthesizes renin, stores it in specific secretory granules and secretes it in a regulated manner.\r"

The CFU-B1 has the capacity for self-renewal and commitment to a number of hematopoietic lineages. Monoclonal antibody to the human progenitor cell antigen-1 (HPCA-1) and a monoclonal antibody against the major histocompatibility class II antigen (HLA-DR) were used with fluorescence activated cell sorting to phenotype the CFU-B1. The CFU-B1 was found to express My10 but not HLA-DR antigen; experiments using complement-dependent cytotoxicity to eliminate DR positive cells confirmed this finding. Pretreatment of marrow cells with two chemotherapeutic agents, 5-fluorouracil and 4-hydroperoxycyclophosphamide facilitated detection of CFU-B1 derived colonies, while diminishing or totally inhibiting colony formation by other hematopoietic progenitor cells. CFU-B1-derived colony formation was dependent upon the addition of exogenous hematopoietic growth factors. Media conditioned either by the human bladder carcinoma cell line 5637 or lectin stimulated leukocytes, as well as recombinant granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor, interleukin 3 or interleukin 1 alpha promoted blast cell colony formation. By contrast, neither recombinant erythropoietin, recombinant interleukin 4, purified macrophage colony stimulating factor or recombinant granulocyte colony-stimulating factor alone promoted blast cell colony formation.\r"

At the onset of diabetes, both streptozotocin-treated and diabetes-prone BB rats exhibited numerous class II positive islet cells that presented ultrastructural features of monocytes and were surrounded by class II negative islet B cells. These class II positive cells were characterized by vacuoles that contained insulin immunoreactive granules and disrupted membranes. Similar cells also appeared positive for the monocyte marker OX-42. The presence of class II positive monocytes with insulin-containing vacuoles may indicate a removal of damage B cells by infiltrating leukocytes. A similar electron microscopical study in man will be necessary to distinguish the putative endocrine pancreatic B cells with aberrant class II expression from infiltrating nonendocrine class II positive cells with insulin-containing phagosomes.\r"

The late occurrence of opportunistic infection, led us to analyze the phenotype of patient PBL. 70% of PBL were CD3+ and 29% WT31+, indicating that the majority of CD3+ PBL did not express the alpha:beta heterodimer. Transcription of the genes encoding the alpha, beta, and gamma chains was assessed in cell lines derived from PBL, by Northern blot analysis. We showed that the CD3+ WT31- subset expressed a truncated, beta mRNA (1.0 kb) and also truncated alpha transcript (1.4 kb). To determine the CD3-associated structure on CD3+ WT31- cell line, immunoprecipitation assays were performed using monoclonal anti-CD3 and an hetero antiserum against gamma peptides. These CD3+ WT31- cells expressed a disulfide linked dimer, composed of products of gamma gene (37 kD, 40 kD) and of undefined delta chain (45 kD). Functional analyses were performed in PBL before and after sorting with WT31 and anti-CD3 antibody. These circulating CD3+ WT31- cells were unable to proliferate when triggered with anti-T3 beads and they seemed to mediate a suppressor activity on CD3+ WT31+ cells.\r"

The effects of graded concentrations of ovine CRH (oCRH), adrenocorticotropin hormone (ACTH), beta-endorphin (beta-EP), alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (alpha-MSH), corticotropin-like intermediate lobe peptide (CLIP), ovine beta-lipotropin (ovine beta-LPH), and dexamethasone (DEX) upon unstimulated and serotonin- (5HT), acetylcholine- (ACh), and norepinephrine-(NE) stimulated CRH secretion were determined. oCRH and DEX inhibited unstimulated iCRH secretion with ID50 at the 10(-8) M range. ACTH had no detectable suppressive effect at 10(-8) M. oCRH, ACTH, and DEX inhibited 5HT-, ACh-, and NE-stimulated iCRH secretion in a dose-dependent fashion. beta-EP, alpha-MSH, and CLIP also inhibited 5HT-induced iCRH secretion. Of the latter peptides, the strongest inhibitor was beta-EP and the weakest was CLIP. Ovine beta-LPH had only a weak inhibitory effect on 5HT-induced iCRH secretion. Generally, the concentrations required for 50% suppression of neurotransmitter-stimulated iCRH secretion were significantly lower than those required for a similar suppression of unstimulated iCRH secretion. In conclusion, these data suggest the presence of multiple negative feedback loops involved in the regulation of the hypothalamic CRH neuron: an ultrashort CRH-mediated loop, a short, hypothalamic POMC-derived peptide loop, and a long, glucocorticoid-mediated negative feedback loop. The potency of these negative feedback loops may be determined by the state of activation of the CRH neuron.\r"

  ".W": "Lipid A is the toxic principle of lipopolysaccharide of gram-negative bacteria, which causes a spectrum of changes in blood cells and vascular cells. We now report that human platelets are directly stimulated by endotoxic lipid A that activates protein kinase C. Rapid phosphorylation of a human platelet protein of Mr 47,000, a marker of protein kinase C activation, accompanies secretion of [14C]serotonin and aggregation triggered by endotoxic lipid A. These events are time and concentration dependent, with phosphorylation reaching maximum in 2 min and the concentration of lipid A causing a 50% effect (EC50) between 12 and 15 microM. Phospholipase C activation in lipid A-stimulated platelets was not observed as judged by a lack of generation of [3H]diacylglycerol in [3H]arachidonic acid-labeled platelets and a lack of generation of [32P]-phosphatidic acid in 32PO4-labeled platelets. Lipid A did not induce formation of TXA2 as measured by radioimmunoassay for TXB2. The stimulation of human platelets and activation of protein kinase C by endotoxic lipid A was blocked by lipid X, a structural precursor of lipid A. Lipid X also blocked the stimulation of human platelets by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, suggesting that lipid A, lipid X and phorbol ester share reactive site(s) on the human platelet membrane. Although lipid X inhibited thrombin-induced phosphorylation of P47 it did not suppress secretion of [14C]serotonin, indicating the role of protein kinase C-independent pathways in platelet stimulation by thrombin. The inhibitory effect of lipid X did not involve generation of cyclic AMP in human platelet membrane preparations. These results indicate that human platelets are stimulated by endotoxic lipid A, a naturally occurring biologic modifier of protein kinase C. Due to the widespread presence of this enzyme in blood cells, vascular cells, and neurons, its modulation by lipid A may represent a significant mechanism underlying hematologic and circulatory derangements observed in endotoxic shock in humans.\r"

  ".W": "We studied the role of diminished sympathetic nervous system (SNS) activity and endogenous opiate activation in the hypotensive action of taurine, a sulfur amino acid, in deoxycorticosterone acetate (DOCA)-salt hypertensive rats. Supplementation of taurine could prevent the development of DOCA-salt hypertension in rats, but failed to change blood pressure in vehicle-treated control rats. Cardiac NE turnover, which was determined from the rate of decline of tissue NE concentration after the administration of alpha-methyl-p-tyrosine, was markedly accelerated in DOCA-salt rats, but 1% taurine supplement restored it to normal. Moreover, naloxone (2 mg/kg), the specific opiate antagonist, increased blood pressure in taurine-treated DOCA-salt rats, restoring it to levels similar to those in the DOCA-salt rats. In contrast, taurine did not decrease cardiac NE turnover in the control rats, nor did naloxone increase blood pressure in the taurine-treated control rats. Moreover, supplementation of taurine increased both beta-endorphin-like immunoreactive material and taurine contents in the hypothalamus of DOCA-salt rats, whereas it did not increase beta-endorphin in that of control rats despite increased taurine contents. Thus, taurine not only normalized the increased cardiac SNS activity but also elicited an opiate-mediated vasodepressor response only in DOCA-salt rats. It is suggested, therefore, that endogenous opiate activation, which is intimately related to SNS suppression, may contribute to the antihypertensive effect of taurine in sodium chloride hypertension.\r"

  ".U": "88331415\r", 
  ".W": "The pathogenesis of renal fibrosis in crescentic nephritis is incompletely understood. To improve our understanding of this process, crescentic nephritis was induced in New Zealand White rabbits by administration of guinea pig antiglomerular basement membrane IgG after sensitization with guinea pig IgG, and their kidneys were analyzed for the development of fibrosis. Collagen synthesis in renal cortical tissue was significantly elevated by day 3, peaked at days 7-15, and returned towards baseline by day 21. Collagen content of both glomeruli and cortex were increased starting on days 14-16, and remained constant in cortex thereafter. Light microscopic analysis was much less sensitive, revealing fibrosis only after day 21. Immunofluorescence revealed that type IV collagen was distributed primarily in the glomerulus, while types I and III were increased in the glomerulus and interstitium. Thus, in this model of crescentic nephritis, fibrosis, as assessed biochemically, developed early at time points when morphologic analysis failed to detect such a development. Hence early therapeutic intervention, before morphologic evidence of fibrosis is evident, may be more successful in arresting the progression of this disease before it reaches irreversible terminal stages.\r"

Five conscious dogs were instrumented for the measurement of subendocardial segment length and transmural wall thickness in the ischemic area, subendocardial segment length in the normally perfused area, coronary flow and left ventricular pressure. After recovery from surgery, 180 (mean) 2 min coronary occlusions were given over a period of 20 days. The heart rate at rest, left ventricular peak systolic and end-diastolic pressures and peak positive first derivative of left ventricular pressure (dP/dt) remained unchanged throughout the experiment. In the normal area, the end-diastolic segment length at rest did not change significantly. By contrast, in the ischemic area, at 14 days after the initiation of repeated coronary occlusion, the end-diastolic regional cross-sectional area (product of segment length and wall thickness) at rest had increased by 9.7% (p less than 0.05); thereafter it decreased to 6.5% (p less than 0.05) above the value at rest before repeated occlusion despite an additional 6 days of coronary occlusions. At 10 days after the interruption of repeated occlusion, this value had regressed to 4.3% (p = NS) above control. These findings suggest the occurrence of regional myocardial hypertrophy confined to the ischemic area in response to the periodic ischemic stimulus.\r"

  ".U": "88331599\r", 
  ".W": "The author has proposed in previous publications that isolated cardiac malformations have an evolutionary origin. This is partly supported by the fact that isolated cardiac malformations found in humans occur also in other placental mammals as well as in birds. External gross examination of the heart in just over 5,000 birds was carried out during a 3 year period. Anomalies included one instance of duplicate hearts, two specimens in which no heart could be identified and in a fourth, a yellow-rumped warbler, the heart lay in the neck outside of the thoracic cavity. Published reports of similar occurrences of an ectopically placed heart concern birds, cattle and humans. The fact that various species of both placental mammals and birds show evidence of heritability for heart defects, and that these species cannot interbreed, combined with the fact that birds and mammals have many similar malformations, points to either a common external causative factor or a common origin. Genes that code the malformed heart must be transmitted with that part of the genetic makeup common to all birds and mammals. Malformations caused by teratogens produce widespread organ injury to a potentially normal embryo whereas the evolutionary malformation is an organ-specific anomaly in an otherwise normal mammal or bird and occurs in widely separated species. The implications of this theory are important for parents of children with an isolated congenital heart defect who may have ingested one or another drug or chemical or have been exposed to toxins or infectious agents before or after conception of the affected offspring.\r"

To examine its sensitivity and specificity, incremental doses of acetylcholine (20, 50 and 100 micrograms into the left coronary artery and 20 and 50 micrograms into the right coronary artery) were injected into the coronary artery or arteries in 70 patients with variant angina (Group 1) (mean age 57 years) and 93 patients without variant angina or angina at rest (Group 2) (mean age 54 years). Forty patients of the latter group had atypical chest pain, 16 cardiomyopathy, 14 arrhythmia, 11 valvular disease, 7 stable effort angina due to advanced coronary artery disease, 3 congenital heart disease and 2 hypertension. A temporary cardiac pacemaker set at 40 to 50 beats/min was positioned in the right ventricle. Coronary spasm was defined as total occlusion or severe vasoconstriction associated with chest pain or ischemic ST changes on the electrocardiogram or both. In Group 1, acetylcholine induced spasm in 63 (90%) of the 70 patients in the artery or arteries predicted to be responsible for spontaneous attacks. In Group 2, acetylcholine induced coronary spasm only in one patient with effort angina and advanced coronary artery disease although lesser degrees of vasoconstriction (less than or equal to 75% of the luminal diameter) occurred in most patients after acetylcholine (specificity of acetylcholine thus was 99%). In conclusion, intracoronary injection of acetylcholine is sensitive and reliable for the induction of coronary spasm.\r"

  ".W": "To characterize changes in left ventricular morphology and function associated with renal transplantation, noninvasive cardiac evaluations were performed in 41 adults at the time of surgery and at follow-up. At the time of transplantation, 36 patients had undergone hemodialysis through a fistula for 2.3 +/- 2.5 years (mean +/- SD); their hematocrit level was 26 +/- 6% and systolic blood pressure was 151 +/- 19 mm Hg. Perioperatively, left ventricular hypertrophy was present in 93% of patients by echocardiography, but in only 37% by electrocardiography. Abnormal left ventricular diastolic function was present in 67% of patients and indicated a high risk for perioperative pulmonary edema. At follow-up (1.5 +/- 1.4 years), mean hematocrit level increased to 39 +/- 7%, systolic blood pressure decreased to 132 +/- 14 mm Hg and spontaneous closure of the fistula occurred in 13 patients. Left ventricular mass by echocardiography decreased from 237 +/- 66 to 182 +/- 47 g (p less than 0.001), a decrease of 23%. Left ventricular volumes and cardiac index also decreased significantly, reflecting the rapid resolution of a pretransplant high output state. Despite proportionate regression of left ventricular hypertrophy within months of transplantation, diastolic function did not improve. The significant regression of left ventricular hypertrophy that occurs after renal transplantation may help explain the improved cardiovascular survival of patients with a renal transplant over that of patients on long-term dialysis.\r"

One hundred six patients with inducible sustained ventricular tachyarrhythmia, whose initial study included short-term drug testing with intravenous procainamide, were evaluated. The baseline arrhythmia induced (in the absence of all antiarrhythmic drugs) was monomorphic tachycardia with a cycle length greater than 200 ms in 81 patients and ventricular flutter or fibrillation in the remaining 25 patients. After intravenous infusion of procainamide (1,250 +/- 300 mg), a ventricular tachyarrhythmia could still be induced in 80 patients during testing with up to three extrastimuli. Serial drug testing with one to four trials of oral conventional and investigational agents was then undertaken. Evaluation of 15 clinical, hemodynamic and electrophysiologic variables by stepwise logistic regression identified two independent predictors of successful response to oral antiarrhythmic drugs: 1) noninducibility of ventricular tachycardia after intravenous procainamide (p less than 0.001), and 2) left ventricular ejection fraction greater than or equal to 40% (p less than 0.05). Subgroup analysis combining each of these variables identified patients with a high, intermediate or low probability of finding a successful oral drug regimen. Patients whose arrhythmia was suppressed by intravenous procainamide had a 100% likelihood (if left ventricular ejection fraction was greater than or equal to 40%) or an 87% likelihood (if ejection fraction was less than 40%) of responding to an oral regimen.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

This was followed by two classroom lectures, each 50 minutes long, on inventory systems management in foodservice facilities. Members of the experimental group participated in using the food item inventory simulation and study guide after attending both classroom lectures. All the participants of the experimental and control groups completed a post-test 3 weeks after the pretest. The difference in post-test adjusted mean scores between the experimental and control groups was significant (p less than or equal to .05) as determined by analysis of covariance.

The pigment is usually located in mucosal macrophages, in lysosomes.

All 8 patients treated with PP showed clinical and endoscopic improvement in contrast with only 4 of 10 patients treated with BDP. Endocrinologic evaluation showed a significant decrease in morning plasma cortisol, in cortisol increase after synacthen, and in urinary free cortisol excretion after PP therapy, but no changes in these variables after BDP therapy. We conclude that PP enemas are more active in the treatment of ulcerative proctitis, but they cause a suppression of the adrenal cortex, in contrast to BDP.\r"

Forty-six cases (63.9%) had a final diagnosis of extrahepatic biliary obstruction. Clinical evaluation had a sensitivity of 82.6% and a specificity of 46.2% for the identification of mechanical obstruction. Ultrasonography was the single most powerful noninvasive diagnostic procedure, with a sensitivity of 65.2%, a specificity of 92.3%, a positive likelihood ratio of 8.5, and a positive predictive value (PVpos) of 93.8%, which was superior to the diagnostic power of CS (0.05 less than p less than 0.1). Inconclusive results or technical failures were counted as diagnostic errors. Contingency table analyses in an extended group of 112 patients, complete for CE, US, and CS, revealed that concordant results of CE and US had a high probability of correctness (combined PVpos 92.6%, PVneg 98.0%). Contradictory ratings of these two tests were unlikely to be clarified reliably by additional CS. We conclude that the combined evaluation of CE and US allows an accurate differentiation between intrahepatic cholestasis and extrahepatic biliary obstruction. When both give contradictory results, direct cholangiography, rather than further noninvasive procedures, appears to be the diagnostic strategy of choice.\r"

  ".W": "In 43 patients with various hepatobiliary disorders, we compared retrospectively the sensitivity and specificity of hepatobiliary scintigraphy and ultrasonography in diagnosing extrahepatic biliary obstruction. Hepatic uptake of radioactivity from the circulation was assessed by early scintiscan at 2 min, and the clearance ratio was combined with transit time in the interpretation of hepatobiliary scintiscans. The transit time was defined as the time taken by detectable radioactivity to appear in the extrahepatic biliary tree or small intestine, whichever occurred sooner. The sensitivity and specificity were 92% and 97%, respectively. However, the specificity dropped to 74% when biliary-bowel transit time, i.e., time taken for detectable radioactivity to appear in small intestine only, was used instead of transit time in the interpretation of the scintiscans. The sensitivity and specificity of ultrasonography were 55% and 94%, respectively. We conclude that hepatobiliary scintiscan is more sensitive than ultrasonography and is reliable for diagnosing extrahepatic biliary obstruction when it is done and interpreted by the method described here.\r"

Angiodysplasia is a distinct mucosal vascular lesion associated with acute or chronic gastrointestinal bleeding. Its etiology is unknown, but theories of its pathogenesis have evolved from its similarity to colonic angiodysplasia and an association with renal failure. Despite recurrent gastrointestinal bleeding, the endoscopic diagnosis is difficult because the lesions are so small and so similar to fresh blood. Endoscopic ablation by electrocautery or laser photocoagulation can reduce bleeding or make it stop, but repeated treatments are often necessary.\r"

Gastrointestinal and hepatic diseases are frequent post-transplant problems. They present with intractable nausea and vomiting, intestinal bleeding, diarrhea, esophageal complaints, abdominal pain, and hepatobiliary symptoms. Our clinical approach to complex transplant patients depends on the timing of signs and symptoms after marrow grafting and on the likelihood that specific disease processes are present.

Doppler ultrasound can be used to increase the specificity. We review the roles of angiography, computed tomography (CT), and magnetic resonance, to conclude that the Japanese experience has demonstrated the efficacy of screening for HCC in the population at risk using serum AFP and ultrasound with the addition of dynamic CT and angiography where indicated. The continuing poor prognosis of patients with HCC in the United States suggests a failure to apply these methods for the early detection of HCC.\r"

Ten published studies of febrile infants younger than 3 months of age were reviewed, and data were statistically combined to develop estimates of the risk of bacteremia and serious infection. Factors that predicted increased risk were similarly evaluated. Mean and median risk estimates included, respectively, 3.0 and 3.4 percent for bacteremia, 1.3 and 1.0 percent for septic meningitis, and 5.0 and 7.0 percent for pneumonia. These were no higher than comparable estimates for older infants. Clinical appearance was 92 percent sensitive in predicting bacteremia in 500 infants (23 of 25 cases). Younger age, higher fever, and elevated white blood cell count were associated with increased risk of serious infection. Data from these studies do not support the belief that febrile infants younger than 3 months are uniformly at greater risk of serious infection than older infants. Judicious evaluation of younger infants could lead to more selective, cost-efficient management.\r"

  ".W": "To evaluate the effect of high-dose chemotherapy in the treatment of metastatic breast cancer, we performed a phase II trial of a single treatment with high-dose cyclophosphamide (5,625 mg/m2), cisplatin (165 mg/m2), and carmustine (600 mg/m2), or melphalan (40 mg/m2) and bone marrow support as the initial chemotherapy for metastatic breast cancer. Twenty-two premenopausal patients with estrogen receptor negative, measurable metastatic disease were treated. Twelve of 22 patients (54%) obtained a complete response at a median 18 days. The overall response rate is 73% (complete and partial response). Median duration of response in the patients achieving complete response was 9.0 months with a median duration of survival for complete responders that is currently undefined. Relapse occurred predominantly at sites of pretreatment bulk disease or within areas of previous radiation therapy. Toxicity was frequent and five patients died of therapy-related complications. The results indicate that a single treatment with intensive combination alkylating agents with bone marrow support can produce more rapid and frequent complete responses than conventional chemotherapy when used as initial chemotherapy for metastatic breast cancer, although median disease-free and overall survival is not improved. Three patients (14%) remain in unmaintained remission beyond 16 months.\r"

  ".U": "88332383\r", 
  ".W": "This study was designed to assess the role of dosage of chemotherapy for treatment of metastatic breast cancer. One hundred thirty-three patients without prior chemotherapy for metastatic disease were randomly allocated to receive two different dose levels of cyclophosphamide (C), methotrexate (M), and fluorouracil (F), administered intravenously (IV) every 3 weeks. Patients were stratified by sites of disease (visceral, bone, or soft-tissue dominant) and by interval from primary surgery to first recurrence. Doses on the higher-dose arm were 600 mg/m2 (C,F) and 40 mg/m2 (M) with escalation if possible; doses on the lower-dose arm were 300 mg/m2 (C,F) and 20 mg/m2 (M) without escalation. Patients who failed to respond to lower-dose CMF were crossed over to the higher-dose arm. Patients randomized to the higher-dose arm had longer survival measured from initiation of chemotherapy (median survival, 15.6 months v 12.8 months, P = .026 by log-rank test), but the effect of dose was of borderline significance (P approximately 0.12) when adjusted for a chance imbalance between the two arms in the time from first relapse to randomization, using the Cox proportional hazards model. Response rates (International Union Against Cancer [UICC] criteria) for patients with measurable disease were higher-dose arm: 16/53 (30%) and lower-dose arm: 6/53 (11%), (P = .03). Only one of 37 patients responded on crossover from the lower- to the higher-dose arm. Patients experienced more vomiting, myelosuppression, conjunctivitis, and alopecia when receiving higher doses of chemotherapy. A series of 34 linear analogue self-assessment scales were used to make detailed quality of life assessments on a subset of 49 patients. These scales confirmed greater toxicity in the immediate posttreatment period, but also a trend to improvement in general health and some disease-related indices, in patients receiving higher-dose chemotherapy. This trial suggests that better palliation is achieved by using full-dose chemotherapy.\r"

A total of ten courses of treatment, administered every 6 weeks, was planned and T was stopped 6 weeks after the last course of CFP. Two hundred thirty-four patients were fully eligible and evaluable. With a median observation time slightly in excess of 5 years, the proportion of recurrences on each arm were: CFP, 29 of 75 (39%); CFPT, 29 of 71 (41%); and observation, 50 of 88 (57%). Relapse-free survival distributions for both CFP and CFPT were superior to observation (both two-sided P = .01). Considering prognostic factors in covariate analysis revealed two-sided P = .0006 for CFP v observation and P = .0003 for CFPT v observation. No substantial difference was identified between CFP and CFPT. Survival data are not yet mature with 31% dead; and, although slight separations of the curves exist in favor of the treatment arms, no significant differences in survival have been seen. Both adjuvant therapy programs are well tolerated and there were no treatment-related deaths. Further maturation of the data is required to determine if the advantages in relapse-free survival will be translated into any overall survival benefit which must be considered the goal of primary interest.\r"

  ".W": "To evaluate the effect of adjuvant chemotherapy in patients with local-regional nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) (squamous or undifferentiated) in complete remission at the end of curative radiotherapy (RT) 229 patients were randomized from 1979 to 1983 in a multicenter study to no further therapy (116 patients) or a combination of vincristine, cyclophosphamide, and Adriamycin (doxorubicin; Adria Laboratories, Columbus, OH) (VCA) for six monthly cycles (113 patients). The RT and RT + VCA groups were well balanced for median age (50 v 49 years), histology (undifferentiated carcinoma, 73% v 70%), tumor extent (tumor limited to nasopharynx, 57% v 57%), and nodal extent (negative nodes 26% v 24%, nodes in the lower cervical levels, 17% v 16%). RT was delivered to the nasopharynx, the base of the skull, and bilateral cervical nodes using a split course technique over 10 weeks up to the dose of 60 to 70 Gy in involved sites and 50 Gy to negative nodes. Response to RT was evaluated within 65 days post-RT treatment. Analysis at 48 months did not show significant difference between the two treatment groups in terms of relapse-free survival (RT, 55.8%, RT + VCA, 57.7%, P = .45) and overall survival (RT, 67.3%, RT + VCA, 58.5%, P = .13). The pattern of relapse was similar in the two treatment arms. Distant metastases were the cause of treatment failure in about 50% of relapsing patients. Although the results of the present study did not show any benefit from VCA administered after curative RT, combined systemic chemotherapy should be further explored due to the high incidence of local and distant failure after intensive RT.\r"

Forty-one patients had extranodal sites of relapse and 31 patients had constitutional symptoms. Two patients had been treated with mechlorethamine, vincristine, procarbazine, and prednisone (MOPP), lomustine, vinblastine, procarbazine, and prednisone (CcVPP), and radiation; 16 patients with MOPP, doxorubicin, bleomycin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine (ABVD), radiation, and lomustine, etoposide, and prednisone (CEP); 20 patients with alternating MOPP/ABVD, and 12 patients with alternating MOPP/ABVD followed by CEP and radiation. Eighteen patients had progressive disease during alternating MOPP/ABVD protocol alone or during conventional salvage therapy; 32 patients had had a complete remission with first-line therapy but later relapsed, 25 of them having received conventional salvage therapy; 12 achieved no response or progression (\"resistant-relapse\" patients); and 13 responded partially or completely (\"sensitive-relapse\" patients). Complete remission occurred in 24 patients (48%) with a median duration of 24 months and 16 patients (32%) achieved partial response with a median duration of 9 months, for an overall response rate of 80%. Ten patients failed to respond and died in progressive disease 1 to 10 months (median, 6 months) after transplantation. Toxicity was significant including infections (20%), liver enzymes and alkaline phosphatase elevations (100%), and carmustine lung toxicity (7%). There were two treatment-related deaths; one patient died of Pseudomonas aeruginosa septicemia and another patient died of cerebral hemorrhage. These results validate the procedure of high-dose therapy followed by autologous bone marrow transplantation in inducing remission in these advanced, highly-treated patients. Clearly, the question of whether high-dose therapy and transplantation will eventually supersede new conventional salvage therapies will be addressed after controlled clinical studies.\r"

  ".W": "We conducted a randomized clinical trial in men with stage D2 prostate cancer to test whether androgen priming potentiates the efficacy of cytotoxic chemotherapy. Eighty-five men with progressive prostate cancer refractory to orchiectomy were treated continuously with aminoglutethimide and hydrocortisone to lower adrenal androgen secretion and were administered cyclic intravenous (IV) chemotherapy. The patients were randomized to receive either androgen priming or no additional treatment for three days before and on the day of chemotherapy. Median duration of follow-up was 43 months. Response rate (remission plus disease stabilization) was not significantly different between the stimulation and control arm when the analysis was restricted to evaluable patients (79% v 73%, respectively) or when it was extended to all patients (46% v 61%). Median duration of response was similar for the stimulation and control arm (9 and 10 months, respectively). Median survival was 10 months in the stimulation and 15 months in the control group (P = .0047). The androgen sensitivity of the tumors was supported by the greater toxicity in the stimulation arm associated with androgen administration. Factors found to be independently associated with improved clinical outcome included a high Karnofsky score and hematocrit, long duration of response to the initial castration, and normalization of an elevated serum acid phosphatase on treatment. We conclude that in this group of patients with advanced disease, androgen priming does not potentiate the efficacy of chemotherapy and is actually associated with a worse outcome. Furthermore, our data emphasize the heterogeneity of biologic behavior of prostate cancer.\r"

All patients received chemotherapy in a three-armed randomized trial. Brain metastases were diagnosed in 25 patients before protocol entry and in 37 during treatment. Brain autopsy was performed in 87 patients and was positive in 38 (44%). Eleven of these (29%) were not diagnosed clinically. Patients younger than 60 years had a somewhat higher overall frequency of brain metastases than older patients. Patients with initial performance status above 60% and patients responding to chemotherapy had higher risk for developing brain metastasis during treatment than other patients, probably because of the increasing cumulated risk for this complication with prolonged survival. Median survival after onset of brain metastases was 73 days and survival was significantly shorter for these patients than for patients without this complication at days 0, 90, 180, and 365 after protocol entry. Thus, brain metastases is a frequent complication in ACL and the frequency increases with prolonged survival. Survival after development of brain metastases is short and it is questionable whether the inclusion of this subgroup of ACL patients into experimental cytostatic treatments is justified.\r"

These differences were seen both for oral and IV melphalan. A trend for beneficial effect of VCR/Pred was definitely seen in the good-risk patients (P = .03) but only suggestive for poor-risk patients (P = .12). Following adjustment for VCR/Pred effects, there were no differences in the survival of patients receiving any of the four initial treatments.\r"

This regimen included doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, and methotrexate. This report updates and extends our experience. The median follow-up of this trial is now 7.1 years and reveals a 5-year disease-free survival of 75% and 54% for chemotherapy and no chemotherapy groups, respectively (two-sided P [P2] = .037). The 5-year overall survival for patients in this trial was 83% and 60% for the chemotherapy and no chemotherapy groups, respectively, with a trend towards improved survival in the chemotherapy arm (P2 = .124). Because of doxorubicin-induced cardiomyopathy we performed a subsequent randomized trial comparing this high-dose regimen to reduced cumulative doses of doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide without methotrexate. Eighty-eight patients were entered into this trial which has a median follow-up of 4.4 years. The 5-year disease-free and overall survival for patients treated with the reduced doses of chemotherapy was 72% and 75%, respectively, and was not significantly different from the high-dose regimen. No patients developed congestive heart failure on this study. We conclude that adjuvant chemotherapy improves disease-free survival in patients with extremity soft-tissue sarcomas. The overall survival advantage in patients receiving adjuvant chemotherapy in our initial randomized high-dose chemotherapy trial has diminished though it continues to favor the chemotherapy group. A reduced-dose chemotherapy regimen was found to be comparable to the high-dose regimen.\r"

  ".W": "In animal tumor models the dose-response curve for cytotoxic agents, especially cyclophosphamide, may be steep, but the slope and shape of this curve depends not only on the drug used but on the schedule of drug administration, the specific tumor type, tumor cell kinetics, and tumor mass. It might be anticipated from these studies that the human tumors most sensitive to dose effects would be leukemia, lymphoma, small-cell carcinoma of the lung, and testicular tumors rather than the low growth fraction, relatively less responsive tumors such as breast cancer. However, the clinical evidence for a steep dose-response curve in any tumor type is limited. For breast cancer such evidence is largely retrospective or derived from uncontrolled trials. The data available from randomized trials makes it seem unlikely that small, or even moderate, reductions in drug dose for nontrivial reasons will compromise the survival of patients with either early or metastatic disease. In spite of promising data from small trials, there is, as yet, inadequate evidence to justify the use of very-high-dose therapy and autologous marrow transplant outside the setting of a well-designed clinical trial. The value of high-dose therapy, intensive dose rate, and cumulative drug dose should each be studied in randomized controlled trials.\r"

  ".W": "Bromodeoxyuridine (BUdR), a nonhypoxic radiosensitizing drug, is a halogenated pyrimidine analog that is incorporated into the deoxyribonucleic acid of dividing cells in a competitive process with thymidine; BUdR also sensitizes these cells to radiation therapy. Neurons and glial cells have a very low mitotic rate. They will not incorporate BUdR and will not be sensitized. Bromodeoxyuridine is best delivered intra-arterially because of its regional advantage, calculated to be between 6 and 16. An 8-week BUdR infusion is delivered before and during radiation therapy through a permanently implanted pump with a catheter placed retrograde into the external carotid artery. Eighteen patients with malignant glioma (15 grade IV, and three grade III) were entered into a Phase I dose-escalation protocol with BUdR dosages ranging from 400 to 600 mg/sq m/day. The maximum dose that can be tolerated appears to be 400 mg/sq m/day for 8 weeks. The 18 patients entered in this study have a median Kaplan-Meier estimated survival time (+/- standard error of the mean) of 22 +/- 5 months with 11 patients still alive. Three patients are alive at 30, 29, and 21 months after diagnosis with no evidence of tumor on computerized tomography. There have been no vascular complications. Side effects in all patients have included anorexia, fatigue, ipsilateral forehead dermatitis, blepharitis, iritis, and nail ridging. Myelosuppression requiring dose reduction occurred in one patient. One patient had a Stevens-Johnson syndrome requiring termination of BUdR. It is concluded that intra-arterial BUdR may improve survival times in patients with malignant gliomas.\r"

Euglycemic hyperinsulinemic glucose clamps were conducted by infusing insulin (2 m mu.kg-1.min-1, constant rate) for 120 min while maintaining euglycemia. In a 12-h fasted state, ID rats were hyperglycemic (109.4 +/- 4.0 mg.dL-1 arterial plasma glucose, x +/- SEM) when compared with C rats (86.9 +/- 3.4 mg.dL-1) (P less than 0.05). Even though insulin was infused identically on a per kilogram body weight basis for both groups, the resulting hyperinsulinemia was higher in ID rats (3.1 +/- 0.27 ng.mL-1) compared with C rats (2.3 +/- 0.4 ng.mL-1) at the end of the clamp. Glucose infusion rates required to maintain euglycemia were twofold higher in ID rats (27.0 +/- 5.4 mg.kg-1.min-1) versus C rats (13.1 +/- 3.3 mg.kg-1.min-1) (P less than 0.05). Circulating lactic acid increased in both groups, and the concentrations in ID rats (3.2 +/- 0.4 mmol.L-1) were significantly higher than those in C rats (1.8 +/- 0.5 mmol.L-1) at the end of the clamp. When the efficiency of insulin to dispose glucose was evaluated by calculating the glucose disposal divided by the prevailing insulinemia, ID rats could dispose of almost twice the glucose per unit of insulin [9.0 +/- 0.6 (mg.kg-1.min-1)/(ng.mL-1)] when compared with C rats [5.6 +/- 0.9 (mg.kg-1.min-1)/(ng.mL-1)] (P less than 0.05). The data indicate that insulin sensitivity is increased in ID rats and that ID rats cannot metabolize exogenous insulin as well as C rats.\r"

Starvation leads to increased CPT activity in ad libitum-fed, riboflavin-supplemented rats. The present studies examined the mechanism of the increase in CPT activity in riboflavin deficiency and whether it was additive to that seen in starvation. Rats were divided into three groups initially: riboflavin-sufficient, ad libitum-fed; riboflavin-deficient, ad libitum-fed; and pair-fed. These groups were subdivided after 5 wk into fed and 24- and 48-h starved groups. When riboflavin-deficient rats were starved for 24 or 48 h, there was only a 30-40% increase in hepatic CPT activity, in contrast to the ad libitum-fed, riboflavin-supplemented rats, in which activity increased twofold. CPT activity of pair-fed rats was similar to that of controls in the fed state and did not increase significantly with starvation. CPT translation, mRNA levels and transcription rates correlated with CPT activity, as did immunoreactive CPT. Concurrently, hepatic ketone production and plasma beta-hydroxybutyrate concentration increased during starvation in the control and pair-fed but not in the riboflavin-deficient rats. The results indicate that increased CPT activity in riboflavin deficiency and starvation results at least in part from increased synthesis. Furthermore, the data support previous work suggesting that the block in fatty acid oxidation occurs in the beta-oxidation pathway at the level of acyl-CoA dehydrogenases.\r"

A diet containing 15% CSDF given to streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats for 30 d tended to reduce the postprandial plasma glucose level curve. Alternatively, CSDF significantly increased fecal weight (15 +/- 3 vs. 5 +/- 2 g; P less than 0.01) and shortened transit time (20 +/- 2.24 vs. 11.2 +/- 0.8 h). CSDF had no effect on body weight and serum lipid levels. Twelve NIDDM subjects were given a meal tolerance test (MTT) with or without CSDF before and after daily supplementation of CSDF (16.5 g) in pita twice a day for a month. Incremental glucose levels were significantly (P less than 0.05) lower at 30, 60 and 180 min after the MTT containing CSDF than in subjects consuming a meal without CSDF. The insulin levels also tended to be lower. The NIDDM subjects tolerated the CSDF well. No flatulence or other side effects were exhibited. Plasma lipid levels remained unchanged. We therefore concluded that CSDF may have a potential benefit in the management of NIDDM.\r"

  ".W": "The instruments used for psychological assessment have been under close scrutiny for many years. In particular, ethnic and racial minorities have pointed out that misapplication of instruments standardized to White middle-class norms can result in incorrect assessments. An analogous situation exists with IVDUs. In the work of the present authors with IVDUs, they were found to be a very diverse group. Contrary to common wisdom, they differ by race, ethnicity, age, and drug use profiles. However, their economic circumstances and social stigma make them a special case in terms of psychological assessment. Given the unique characteristics of IVDUs, it behooves researchers to carefully examine the standardized instruments that are available for psychological evaluation. Too often, measures standardized on White middle-class samples lack the value neutrality that makes them applicable across disparate groups. In addition, many such measures are designed with certain presumptions that do not necessarily hold true with this population (e.g., willingness and/or ability to communicate intimate information about one's feelings and psychological states). This article briefly describes some of the challenges encountered in examining standardized instruments for use in the study of IVDUs, their health psychology and AIDS-related behavior. Concerns with self-report biases, literacy, attentional focus, measurement constructs, and drug states confounding psychological states all pose challenges to psychological research with this heterogeneous population. While the need for direct intervention on the sexual and needle-sharing behaviors of IVDUs remains paramount in the combat against the spread of AIDS, researchers must also continue with the further development of basic measurement tools.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Although morphine was equally efficacious in the four brain regions examined (10-15% inhibition), DADLE inhibited cyclic AMP (cAMP) production to a greater extent in cortex and striatum (20-25% inhibition). Pertussis toxin treatment in vitro significantly reduced DADLE-inhibition of adenylate cyclase in all brain areas, indicating that this opiate response is mediated by a pertussis toxin-sensitive G-protein (i.e., Gi and/or Go). Chronic (in vivo) administration of morphine pellets for 5 days, treatment known to induce opiate tolerance and dependence, increased basal, GTP- and forskolin-stimulated adenylate cyclase in the LC, but not in the other three brain regions studied. DADLE was found to inhibit cAMP production in LC in vitro to the same extent in control and morphine-treated rats, suggesting a lack of opiate receptor tolerance. The morphine-induced increase in adenylate cyclase required chronic exposure to the opiate, as shorter treatment times, namely 2 hr and 1 day, failed to produce this effect. In fact, at 2 hr a small decrease in adenylate cyclase in the LC was observed that did not appear to be due to morphine being retained in the membrane fraction. Taken together, the findings of this study provide support for the view that changes in the cAMP system in the LC play a role in mediating acute opiate action as well as in underlying the development of opiate tolerance, dependence and/or withdrawal.\r"

Similar effects were observed with the preferential alpha-2 receptor agonists clonidine and guanabenz whereas less pronounced effects were found with (-)-epinephrine. No significant effects on blood glucose levels were observed with the alpha-1 adrenoceptor agonist methoxamine. Adrenalectomy or depletion of catecholamine stores by reserpine, alpha-methylparatyrosine or DSP4 failed to modify the hyperglycemic response to UK 14.304. However, streptozotocin diabetic mice did not respond to UK 14.304. The hyperglycemia induced by submaximal doses of UK 14.304 was antagonized by the centrally and peripherally acting alpha-2 adrenoceptor antagonists rauwolscine, yohimbine, idazoxan and phentolamine, by the peripheral antagonist benextramine but not by prazosin (alpha-1 selective) or propranolol (beta adrenergic). Thus, it may be suggested that the alpha agonist-induced hyperglycemia is mediated via postsynaptic alpha-2 adrenoceptors located on pancreatic beta cells and that it is mediated through the inhibition of insulin secretion.\r"

  ".W": "Aldosterone secretion is subject to both stimulatory and inhibitory controls. Angiotensin II (AII) is the primary stimulator of aldosterone production and an inhibitory role of dopamine (DA) has been suggested recently. In this study we investigated the interactions between DA and AII in the intracellular events leading to aldosterone secretion. By measuring aldosterone secretion and cyclic AMP (cAMP) formation in intact adrenal glomerulosa cells we show that AII induced a sustained stimulation of aldosterone secretion (EC50, 0.41 nM) and a rapid and transient increase in intracellular cAMP content (EC50, 4 nM). DA inhibited both aldosterone secretion (IC50, 300 nM) and cAMP formation (IC50, 100 nM) elicited by submaximal concentrations of AII; in contrast, DA did not attenuate either basal or adrenocorticotropic hormone-stimulated cell activity. The pharmacological characterization of DA effects with dopaminergic agonists and antagonists strongly indicated an involvement of D-2 receptors. Indeed, selective D-2 agonists were more effective than DA in inhibiting the glomerulosa cell responses to AII; in addition, the effects of DA on both aldosterone secretion and cAMP formation were prevented by D-2 antagonists, such as (-)-sulpiride and domperidone, but not by the selective D-1 antagonist SCH 23390. These data suggest a specific functional interaction between D-2 receptors apparently associated with inhibition of cAMP formation and AII in the regulation of aldosterone production.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of several mu and kappa opioid agonists were examined alone and in combination with the opioid antagonist quadazocine in squirrel monkeys responding under a schedule of shock titration. Under this procedure, shock was scheduled to increase once every 15 sec from 0.01 to 2.0 mA in 30 steps. Five responses on a lever during the 15-sec shock period terminated the shock for 15 sec, after which the shock resumed at the next lower intensity. The intensity below which the monkeys maintained the shock 50% of the time (median shock level) and the rate of responding in the presence of shock were determined under control conditions and after administration of the mu agonists, l-methadone and fentanyl and the kappa agonists, bremazocine, ethylketocyclazocine, ketocyclazocine and U50,488. When examined alone, intermediate doses of mu and kappa agonists increased median shock level. At the highest doses of these compounds responding was eliminated and shock rose to its peak intensity. When the mu and kappa agonists were examined in combination with quadazocine, dose-effect curves for median shock level and for rate of responding were shifted to the right in a dose-dependent fashion. A comparison of the pA2 values for quadazocine on median shock level and on rate of responding revealed similar values for the two measures; however, pA2 values differed depending on the agonist examined. That is, the pA2 values for quadazocine in combination with l-methadone and fentanyl on median shock level were 7.43 and 7.61, respectively; whereas the pA2 value for quadazocine in combination with bremazocine and U50,488 were 6.53 and 6.43, respectively.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Time course studies indicated that SK&F 94836-induced relaxation of trachealis strips contracted with 0.1 microM methacholine was accompanied by an activation of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (cAMP-PK). In subsequent experiments, trachealis strips were contracted with three concentrations of methacholine (0.1, 1.0 or 3.0 microM) or two concentrations of histamine (10 or 300 microM) before being relaxed by the cumulative addition of SK&F 94836. The relaxant response to SK&F 94836 (EC50 = 1-10 microM) decreased progressively as tissues were contracted with higher concentrations of methacholine. In parallel with its inhibitory effect on SK&F 94836-induced relaxation, methacholine suppressed the ability of SK&F 94836 to activate cAMP-PK. Interestingly, the inhibition of cAMP-PK activity was not accompanied by a significant inhibition of SK&F 94836-stimulated cAMP accumulation. Unlike the results with methacholine, the concentration of histamine used to contract tissues had no effect on SK&F 94836-induced relaxation or cAMP-PK activation. To determine the effect of SK&F 94836 on the mechanical and biochemical responses to the beta adrenoceptor agonist isoproterenol, tissues were first contracted with 3.0 microM methacholine and then incubated with 0, 0.3, 3.0 or 30 microM SK&F 94836 before being relaxed by the cumulative addition of isoproterenol. In these experiments, SK&F 94836 potentiated isoproterenol-induced relaxation, cAMP accumulation and cAMP-PK activation in a concentration-dependent manner.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

A reversed phase high-performance liquid chromatography procedure was used to assay for this drug and its metabolite, dihydrolevobunolol. Ocular ketone reductase activity was 3 to 4 times more dependent on NADPH than on NADH. The rank order of activity was corneal epithelium greater than iris-ciliary body greater than conjunctiva greater than lens. No activity was detected in the tears, corneal stroma, sclera or aqueous humor. Ketone reductase activity was entirely cytosolic. The pigmented rabbit was significantly less active than the albino rabbit in ketone reductase. Its activity in the corneal epithelium, iris-ciliary body and lens was most sensitive to inhibition by quercetin, whereas that in the conjunctiva was most sensitive to metyrapone. The ketone reductase in the corneal epithelium contributed more to the metabolism of topically applied levobunolol than its counterpart in the iris-ciliary body and lens. Moreover, the extent of levobunolol metabolism both during and after corneal penetration was dose-dependent. Overall, these findings indicate that ocularly applied drugs containing the ketone functional group are subject to varying degrees of metabolism by NADPH-dependent ketone reductases in the corneal epithelium, iris-ciliary body and lens.\r"

This compound induced a dose-dependent fall in mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) when administered as an i.v. bolus to anesthetized, salt-depleted monkeys. Both the magnitude and the duration of the hypotensive effect were dose related. Its actions were also studied during acute infusions in anesthetized anephric, normal and salt-depleted monkeys. MAP, heart rate and plasma renin activity (PRA) were determined during baseline and 30-min infusions of vehicle alone, followed by A-62198 as boluses of 0.01, 0.1 and 1.0 mg/kg, each maintained by infusing one-tenth of the bolus dose per minute. Vehicle did not alter base-line values. In the normal monkeys, A-62198 induced a dose-related fall in MAP which achieved statistical significance only at the highest dose, while maximally suppressing PRA at all doses (P less than .05, compared to vehicle). The salt-depleted monkeys responded with a dose-related fall in MAP and inhibition of PRA at all doses (P less than .05, compared to vehicle). A-62198 was relatively ineffective in the anephric monkeys which, as expected, had exceedingly low levels of PRA. Heart rate was unaltered regardless of dose or treatment group. Finally, infusion of 1.0 mg/kg bolus + 0.1 mg/kg/min of A-62198 had no effect on MAP or PRA in 2 kidney-1 clip rats, although MAP was reduced subsequent to a superimposed bolus of 0.1 mg/kg of captopril. We conclude that the renin inhibitor, A-62198, is an effective, primate selective hypotensive agent.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

A cohort of such patients, based upon risk factors especially noted in elderly women taking longterm high sustained doses of NSAID is identified for purposes of closer clinical monitoring. Issues of prophylaxis, adjustment of arthritis regimens to NSAID gastropathy, and gastroprotective measures are reviewed as strategic responses to this recently recognized and described iatrogenic problem of arthritis management.\r"

The purpose of the present study was to examine simultaneously, the temporal, metabolic and endocrine consequences of a single uniform injury induced by the injection of lambda-carrageenan into the hindlimbs of male Sprague-Dawley rats and to compare this response to that observed in semistarved pair-fed control animals. Immediately after injury there was a decrease in the plasma hematocrit, increase in tissue water and peripheral vasoconstriction that suggested hypovolemia. This was followed by a restoration of the blood volume by 1 day as reflected in hemodilution. Alterations in insulin, glucagon, ACTH, corticosterone, epinephrine, norepinephrine, and dopamine in wounded animals occurred during the first 5 days. However, similar changes were observed in pair-fed control animals from days 1 to 5. These findings implied that the early endocrine response observed from 0 to 24 hours after injury arises, primarily as a result of hypovolemia, whereas the response observed from 1 to 5 days appeared to be the result of semistarvation. In contrast to the endocrine alterations observed, alterations in the plasma concentrations of lactate, acetoacetate and beta-hydroxybutyrate persisted for up to 15 days. The presence of these substrate alterations in the absence of hormonal stimuli suggest that nonendocrine mechanisms exist to induce these alterations. The possibility is raised that these substrate alterations may be, at least in part, the result of the inflammatory infiltrate.\r"

Although, etiology and pathogenesis of such disorders are largely unknown, endogenous host factors and exogenous agents, such as viruses, bacteria, and small molecular weight chemicals, drugs and food components, are believed to be involved. The toxicological significance of low molecular weight compounds on induction of autoimmune disorders is illustrated by the toxic oil syndrome (TOS), a chemically induced epidemic, observed in Spain since 1981. The causative chemical(s) of TOS is still elusive, but an association between ingestion of refined aniline-adulterated rapeseed oil and the syndrome is well-documented. Epidemiological, clinical and immunopathological symptoms of TOS are briefly reviewed. The striking resemblance with immunological disorders, observed in man upon medication with hydantoins and related compounds, is demonstrated. The likeliness of formation of a hydantoin-related compound in the aniline-adulterated oil is evidenced and its role as possible toxic agent in TOS is proposed. Further, the presence of hydantoins and related compounds in food is briefly reviewed and it is suggested that these chemicals may account for a portion of idiopathic autoimmune diseases observed in man. The need for development of animal models to assess this kind of immunotoxicological effects is stressed.\r"

Both inhibitors were more effective stimuli to renin secretion than head-up tilting of the patient. In patients with unilateral renovascular hypertension single doses of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors increased the renal venous renin ratio compared to the recumbent ratio. This therapy reduced the number of false negative studies more effectively than head-up tilting and was tolerated better. Contralateral suppression of renin in the unaffected kidney, an important ancillary diagnostic marker of unilateral renovascular hypertension, was preserved. No false positive studies owing to the use of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors acutely were apparent. Mean arterial pressure decreased by 5 minutes with intravenous enalaprilat and by 20 minutes with oral captopril, and it continued to decrease gradually for at least 2 hours. No significant syncopal symptoms were observed with either inhibitor. Plasma renin activity increased by 5 and 15 minutes with enalaprilat and captopril, respectively. Plasma aldosterone levels decreased by 10 minutes with enalaprilat and by 30 minutes with captopril, and these changes increased in magnitude during the 2 hours of observation. To achieve the maximum diagnostic effectiveness from the renal venous renin ratio, single dose angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors warrant consideration for routine use. Intravenous enalaprilat may be preferable because of certain achievement of an effective blood level.\r"

We studied the incidence, clinical features, pathology and treatment outcome of perirenal fluid collections after kidney transplantation.

All allografts were studied with B-mode ultrasonography together with a renal scan in the immediate post-transplant period, at 6-month intervals or when clinically indicated. Symptomatic fluid collections, those associated with rejection episodes and those containing more than 50 to 100 ml. fluid were aspirated under sonographic control via aseptic techniques. There were 190 fluid collections (49 per cent) observed during followup (2 to 11 years). Of these collections 98 (51 per cent) were estimated to be less than 50 ml. in volume, were clinically insignificant and resulted in no morbidity. A total of 92 collections was aspirated with 1 aspiration being diagnostic and therapeutic in 57 instances (serous or serosanguinous fluid). The 35 collections remaining were revealed to be lymphoceles on biochemical grounds. Of 13 lymphoceles associated with rejection episodes 8 resolved on initial aspiration. Of the recurrent lymph collections 27 were treated with repeated aspiration, tetracycline sclerotherapy or an operation (10 were treated with marsupialization into the peritoneal cavity). No large collections of urine or blood were detected and 1 infected lymphocele required external drainage. No renal allograft was lost as a result of a fluid collection and over-all graft survival was not affected by the development of perirenal fluid collections. We conclude that perirenal fluid collections are detected commonly in the post-transplant period using B-mode ultrasonography. The majority of these collections are small and will require careful observation only or they will resolve with a single aspiration. Aggressive diagnostic and therapeutic measures are used only for those collections that are symptomatic or result in allograft dysfunction. A rational approach to the diagnosis and treatment of peritransplant fluid collections is described in the form of an algorithm.\r"

Transrectal ultrasonography was more efficient than digital rectal examination in the staging of carcinoma of the prostate before radical prostatectomy. The value of transrectal ultrasonography in the diagnosis of prostatic cancer in men with an abnormal-feeling prostate on digital rectal examination is less certain, since 10 of 75 patients (13 per cent) in this group had a falsely positive scan. The predictive value of a scan positive for malignancy was 37 per cent. Further refinements in the technique of transrectal prostatic ultrasonography are needed to realize fully the diagnostic potential of this imaging modality.\r"

Corresponding figures for 36 patients who underwent total prostatectomy were complete sensitivity 100 per cent, specificity 100 per cent and efficiency 78 per cent. Atypical cytology results not amounting to frank malignancy were the main reasons for reduced efficiency and, therefore, analysis of the significance of atypia was performed. In 50 aspirates from 43 patients atypia of varying degree was noted but the degree of atypia did not allow for a diagnosis of malignancy. Subsequent diagnosis of carcinoma was made by cutting needle biopsy or transurethral resection in 7 of 14 specimens (50 per cent) of severe, 3 of 9 (33 per cent) moderate, 3 of 7 (43 per cent) mild and 3 of 16 (19 per cent) reactive atypia. Thus, specific cytological diagnoses have a high degree of accuracy but atypia and attempts to categorize it did not predict accurately the final diagnosis. Pathological conditions that may account for atypia in fine needle aspiration cytology are reviewed.\r"

  ".U": "88333193\r", 
  ".W": "Flow cytometry was used to evaluate 88 deparaffinized radical prostatectomy specimens to compare deoxyribonucleic acid ploidy in prostatic adenocarcinoma as a predictor of disease progression with other well documented predictors of clinical recurrence. Aneuploidy, Gleason grade and seminal vesicle involvement were nonindependent variables, and all correlated to statistical significance with disease recurrence. The incidence of aneuploidy in the total population was 51 of 88 (58 per cent). Aneuploidy was found in 25 of 28 primary tumors (89 per cent) from patients who subsequently had recurrent disease. Aneuploidy was noted in 40 of 59 specimens (68 per cent) exhibiting seminal vesicle involvement, compared to 11 of 29 (38 per cent) without seminal vesicle involvement (p less than 0.01). The probability of an interval free of disease of 60 months was calculated by Kaplan-Meier analysis to be 85 per cent in diploid specimens compared to 9 per cent in aneuploid specimens (p less than 0.001), and 87 per cent in the absence of seminal vesicle involvement compared to 28 per cent in the presence of seminal vesicle involvement (p less than 0.003). The probability of remaining free of disease in patients exhibiting concomitant diploidy and seminal vesicle involvement (17) was 73 per cent compared to 8 per cent in those with aneuploid specimens and seminal vesicle involvement (p less than 0.004). The incidence of recurrence in patients with Gleason sums of 7 or less was 22 per cent compared to 62 per cent in patients with Gleason sums of greater than 7. There was a 29 per cent incidence of recurrence in intermediate grade tumors (Gleason sum 5 to 7) but only 5 per cent of the patients with intermediate grade diploid tumors had recurrent disease. In conclusion, the recognition of a deoxyribonucleic acid aneuploid stem line in a primary prostatic adenocarcinoma is correlated statistically with a greater likelihood of seminal vesicle invasion and subsequent development of recurrent disease. The markedly increased probability of remaining free of disease in diploid patients, even in the presence of seminal vesicle involvement, suggests that routine flow cytometric analysis in prostatic adenocarcinoma would significantly enhance prognostic stratification.\r"

Patients with known vesicoureteral reflux (grade 2 or greater), congenital renal anomalies, hydronephrosis, renal scarring or urinary tract surgery were excluded. Mean values and standard deviations for sonographically determined renal length were calculated. In general, mean renal length for each age group was below mean values for normal children.

  ".W": "Aortobifemoral bypass (ABF) is the preferred operation for patients with bilateral aortoiliac occlusive disease, but for those with unilateral occlusion without significant stenosis of the contralateral iliac artery, alternative reconstructions, such as femorofemoral (FF) or iliofemoral (IF) bypass have been advocated. We compared the surgical outcome in 96 such patients after ABF (n = 32), FF (n = 47), or IF (n = 17) bypasses, with biplane arteriography and noninvasive laboratory testing used to assess the contralateral iliac artery and runoff status, in particular, patency of the superficial femoral artery (SFA). Graft patencies were assessed by noninvasive criteria and analyzed by the life-table method. The only death occurred after ABF bypass (3.1%). Primary patency rates at 1, 3, and 5 years with an open SFA were 100%, 89% and 89%, respectively, for ABF; 92%, 92%, and 92% for FF; and 71%, 71%, and 36% for IF. When the SFA was occluded, the primary patency rates at 1, 3, and 5 years were 100%, 100%, and 72%, respectively, for ABF; 72%, 53%, and 35% for FF; and 56%, 56%, and 56% for IF bypasses. There were no later occlusions on the contralateral (\"good\") side after ABF. Significant progression of atherosclerosis in donor iliac artery was observed in 6% of both FF and IF bypasses. We conclude that ABF is the preferred operation for extensive iliac artery occlusive disease that is hemodynamically significant only on the symptomatic side unless specifically contraindicated by prohibitive risk or abdominal disease. This is particularly true in the face of SFA occlusion.\r"

Seventy in situ (IS) vein grafts, 49 reversed saphenous (RS) vein grafts, 60 polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) grafts, and 70 umbilical vein (UV) grafts were used. Primary and secondary patency rates at 3 years were, respectively, 84% and 90% for IS, 66% and 73% for RS, 35% and 48% for PTFE, and 24% and 32% for UV. Subgroup analysis according to the site of distal anastomosis showed no significant differences in primary patency among these grafts at the above-knee level but significant differences between both vein grafts (IS and RV) and the others (PTFE and UV) below the knee (78% vs 31%, respectively). This difference increased at the tibial level (78% vs 10%) but there was also a significant difference between IS grafts (88%) and RS grafts (63%) at this level. Hazard functional analysis showed all grafts except IS grafts begin to fail at an increasing rate again by 24 months. Although overall results appeared to favor PTFE over UV, 62% of PTFE vs 16% of UV terminated at the above-knee level and the patency results of these two grafts were not significantly different at any level. The only other factor than graft type and distal anastomotic site that consistently correlated with late patency was tobacco use. Diabetic patients actually fared significantly better than nondiabetic patients, presumably because of the higher use of IS grafts and lower use of tobacco. The choice of graft overshadows all other factors affecting patency and its influence is magnified with more distal terminal anastomosis.\r"

Each subject was supine and non-weight-bearing on a tilt table and rotated in 10-degree increments from -10 degrees (head down) to +30 degrees (head up). Cross-sectional B-mode image was used to monitor continuously CFV diameter for 5 minutes in each position. Doppler flow patterns were recorded in longitudinal axis; heart rate and respiratory movements were also noted. CFV flow was affected by respiratory and cardiac events. At -10 degrees flow was primarily related to cardiac events, with flow increasing during diastole. At +30 degrees flow varied minimally with the cardiac cycle and was primarily respiration dependent, stopping at peak inspiration. Proceeding from -10 to +30 degrees the mean maximal CFV diameter corrected for body surface area increased 92% (0.47 +/- 0.11 cm/m2 to 0.90 +/- 0.16 cm/m2, p less than 0.001), whereas peak flow velocity decreased from 41 +/- 10 cm/sec to 13 +/- 5 cm/sec, p less than 0.001. There was a linear, inverse relationship between mean peak velocity and mean corrected diameter, r = -0.99. The study confirms the multiple influences on venous flow patterns and establishes a quantitative relationship between venous diameters and flow velocities.\r"

Twenty patients (53%) with arteriosclerosis were initially cured or improved; however, seven of these patients had recurrence in 4 to 48 months. Ultimately, only 13 of 38 patients with arteriosclerosis (34%) were cured or improved (mean follow-up 22 months). Nine patients with fibromuscular dysplasia required 17 dilatations of arteries (three bilateral and five repeat), resulting in eight patients (89%) who were cured or improved. Selection of patients with hypertension by medical failure while receiving three or more hypertension medications or by lateralizing renal vein renin values yielded benefit in 17 of 26 patients (65%). Five of six patients with transplant stenosis of the renal artery and hypertension were cured or improved at mean follow-up of 18 months. Overall technical results of 83 artery dilatations were as follows: good, 58 (69%); fair, 10 (12%); poor or unsatisfactory, 16 (19%); these were judged with a blinded radiologic review.

The objective of this study was to determine perioperative (30-day) and subsequent outcome after major vascular surgery in those with severe cardiac dysfunction, defined by EF being 35% or less (normal EF greater than 50%). From Aug. 1, 1984 to Jan. 1, 1988, 35 patients with EF equal to 27.7% +/- 6.1% (mean +/- 1 standard deviation) have required 47 major vascular procedures: 53% (n = 25) were limb revascularizations; 21% (n = 10) were direct aortoiliac aneurysm repairs: 23% (n = 11) were carotid endarterectomies: one patient had transaortic renal endarterectomy. Two deaths occurred within the first 30 days, yielding a 4.3% perioperative mortality rate (2 of 47 procedures). The cumulative mortality rate for the entire group during follow-up of 410 +/- 390 days was 40% (14 of 35 patients). Most late deaths (71%) occurred within the first 6 months after surgery and each was due to cardiovascular complications. Survival for those with an EF of 29% or less was significantly worse than for those with an EF greater than 29%, determined by life-table analysis (p less than 0.012, Mantel-Cox). The cumulative mortality rate was 59% with an EF of 29% or less and 18% in those with an EF greater than 29% (p less than 0.029, two-tailed Fisher exact test). The perioperative mortality rate for those with an EF of 35% or less who require major vascular surgery is acceptable, but overall survival during follow-up is diminished.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Infected femoral artery pseudoaneurysms in narcotic addicts present challenging management options. Our policy of routine revascularization is based on the concern that a high rate of amputations must follow ligation and resection alone or with selective delayed revascularization. Fifteen of 16 patients with infected pseudoaneurysms of femoral arteries, treated with resection and bypass grafts, were observed from 1 to 44 months. Obturator bypass grafts were used in 10 patients, iliac-femoral grafts in three, axillopopliteal in one, and right external iliac crossover to left popliteal in one patient. One limb, unsalvageable at presentation, was amputated primarily, along with resection of pseudoaneurysm and femoral artery ligation, without bypass grafting. One iliac-femoral graft became infected and then thrombosed 4 months after operation. Unsuitable distal arteries and impending necrosis led to above-knee amputation. One late failure among 15 revascularization attempts (7%) is significantly lower than the 11% to 33% amputation rates reported in the literature with resection of pseudoaneurysm alone and delayed selective revascularization. The other 14 patients had functioning limbs without claudication or rest pain. Our experience indicates that revascularization at the time of resection of infected pseudoaneurysm offers better prospects for limb salvage.\r"

During follow-up intervals of one to four hours in the trials of intramuscular lidocaine infusion (6961 patients) and 24 to 48 hours in the trials of intravenous lidocaine injection (2194 patients), a total of 103 cases of ventricular fibrillation and 137 deaths were recorded. Overall, allocation to lidocaine was associated with a reduction in the odds of ventricular fibrillation of about one third, with a 95% confidence interval that ranged from a 3% to a 56% reduction. There was no evidence of any beneficial effect on early mortality; indeed, the odds of early death were about one third greater among patients allocated lidocaine, though this difference was not statistically significant (95% confidence interval, 2% reduction to 95% increase). Because of the small numbers of reported events, the short follow-up periods, and the unavailability of data for some specific causes of death, even an overview of all the trial results does not provide good evidence as to whether prophylactic lidocaine is likely to be helpful or harmful. To answer this question reliably, future trials will need to involve large numbers of patients and prolonged follow-up.\r"

  ".W": "The reports of neurological damage after central venous cannulation over the past 20 yrs have been gathered, summarized, and analyzed. We found 59 cases of nerve lesions: 32 serious or even fatal, and 27 light or transient ones. They included: Lesions of the cervical sympathetic chain: needle trauma, compression by hematoma, anesthetic blockade; brachial plexopathies: needle trauma or compression by hematoma; phrenic or recurrent nerve palsies: anesthetic blockade, needle trauma, or compression by hematoma; cerebral damage following venous air embolism, carotid artery embolism or obstruction (thrombosis, compression), or internal jugular vein obstruction (thrombosis or catheter tip); lesions of the IX, X, XI, and XII cranial nerves by hematoma compression or spilling of histotoxic solutions; and, massive lesions of the anterior rami of the cervical nerves by spillage of histotoxic solutions. We believe that the following simple and well-known measures can substantially reduce the incidence of those serious complications. 1. Avoiding the subclavian or jugular central routes in patients with marked anatomical changes, coagulopathies, and carotid artery or lung diseases. 2. Using only small amounts of dilute concentrations of short-acting local anesthetics before the puncture. 3. Using a small gauge \"seeking\" needle and placing a finger on the carotid artery during a jugular venipuncture to avoid accidental arterial puncture. 4. Using radiopaque catheters long enough to have their tip in midsuperior vena cava. The position of the catheter must be checked radiographically immediately after insertion and even at later periods. The catheter must be meticulously fixed to the skin to avoid its movement.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

This review was compiled to enumerate the many reconstructive techniques which are available and to discuss the advantages and disadvantages of each technique. Five hundred twenty-one patients with nasal cancer were treated at Roswell Park Memorial Institute from 1964 to 1981. Four hundred five patients were treated by cryotherapy, electrocautery, chemosurgery, radiation therapy, or local excision with primary closure. Forty-six patients were treated with simple nasolabial flaps. The remaining 70 patients underwent more extensive resections and reconstructions. Their records were reviewed. At 5 years the local recurrence rate was 3% for basal cell carcinoma and 20% for squamous cell carcinoma. The multiple reconstructive techniques which were utilized in these patients are discussed. Skin-grafting procedures were used to manage 51% of the patients. Prostheses were used in 9%. Multiple different reconstructive flaps were used for the remaining 40% of the patients. The management of large nasal carcinomas must be individualized with therapeutic decisions being made by a practitioner who is familiar with the many reconstructive options. This will ensure the optimal functional and aesthetic result for each patient.\r"

During this period, computer tomography, determination of serum AFP/HCG, and cisplatin-based chemotherapy represented the modern diagnostic and therapeutic modalities. Before orchiectomy 67% of the patients had elevated AFP/HCG. An abnormal postorchiectomy serum tumour marker decrease and the presence of small vessel infiltration in the histological sections of the primary tumour significantly predicted microscopic retroperitoneal metastases in patients with clinical stage I (CSI) nonseminoma. One-third of these patients had a pathological stage II (PSII). After radiotherapy 99% of 90 seminoma patients (CSI/IIa) survived for 5 years. After cisplatin-based chemotherapy (+radiotherapy/surgery) the 5-year survival rate in 25 patients with advanced seminoma was 81%. The survival rate in 148 nonseminoma patients PSI/IIa was 100% and 87% in 94 patients with advanced nonseminoma (greater than or equal to CSIIb). Nausea, general exhaustion, myelosuppression, peripheral neuropathy, and Raynaud-like phenomena were the main acute treatment-related side effects. Slight gastrointestinal problems, slight peripheral neuropathy, Raynaud-like phenomena, and fertility disturbances were frequent late side effects. The sexual life in testicular cancer patients did not seem to be significantly impaired as compared to the normal population. Most of the patients reported no or only slight emotional problems during and after treatment. The need of thorough information at the time of diagnosis was stressed by most of them. Secondary cancer was diagnosed in 27 of 795 patients (1970-1982) (Testicular: 15; pulmonary: 4; sarcoma: 2; others: 6). Testicular cancer is today a curable malignancy. Future clinical research has to concentrate on the identification of high-risk and low-risk patients, the avoidance of overtreatment, and the reduction of toxicity (especially of long-term side effects).\r"

Possible cofactors for the development of cervical neoplasia were examined for any effect on the cell counts per unit area. Current cigarette smoking was associated with a significant decrease in the Langerhans' cell population in both normal epithelium and lesions due to cervical intraepithelial neoplasia. Ex-smokers tended to have cell counts between those of smokers and non-smokers. There was a dose-response relation between number of cigarettes smoked daily and effect on cell counts. These findings of a local immunological effect of smoking on cervical epithelium may explain the means by which cigarette smoking contributes to the development of cervical neoplasia.\r"

Most (68%) ischaemic episodes occurred between 0730 and 1930, with a peak in the morning and a lesser peak in the evening. Two subgroups were studied further in double-blind controlled trials: 33 patients had a total of 1313 hours of ST segment monitoring while treated with nifedipine; and 41 patients a total of 1581 hours while treated with atenolol. Nifedipine did not alter the circadian pattern of ischaemic episodes; atenolol abolished the morning peak, and the peak incidence of ischaemia then occurred in the evening. Circadian patterns for total duration of ischaemic episodes corresponded closely to those of episodes of ischaemia, and were similarly altered by treatment. The circadian pattern of silent ischaemic episodes and their total duration were very similar to those of total ischaemia for the group as a whole and the different subgroups. This circadian distribution of ischaemic episodes and the observed changes with treatment resemble the reported circadian variation of acute myocardial infarction and sudden death.\r"

  ".W": "Infections of the central nervous system are an important cause of morbidity and mortality in recipients of organ transplants. Three organisms--Listeria monocytogenes, Aspergillus fumigatus, and Cryptococcus neoformans--account for the great majority of such infections. The incidence of these infections is directly related to the patient's net state of immunosuppression and to the epidemiologic exposures he encounters. There is an expected timetable of when particular infections are likely to occur post-transplant. The most important factor in effecting patient survival is the rapidity with which diagnosis is made. Because of the nature of the infecting organisms and the impaired inflammatory response, the clinical presentation of CNS infection is often insidious, making early diagnosis difficult. However, an aggressive approach based upon lumbar puncture and CT scanning for patients with headache and fever or altered states of consciousness can be very rewarding. In addition, the use of such ancillary clues as the results of skin and lung biopsies can be an important clue to disseminated infection, particularly involving the CNS. The recent deployment of the MRI scan in immunosuppressed patients with unexplained CNS symptoms holds particular promise for early diagnosis.\r"

There is no pathognomonic clinical or radiographic presentation of the tumor, although multicentric involvement of deep white matter is common. Evidence has linked PCNSL to immunosuppression and to infection with the EBV. The most reasonable sequence of events leading to the development of this tumor appears first to be an infection with (or reactivation of) EBV following immunosuppression. The virus then produces B cell lymphoproliferation that is unchecked because of suppression of the normal immune mechanisms. At some point, the lymphoproliferation becomes neoplastic, and a lymphoma results. Reduction in immunosuppression and antiviral treatment may be of use in the treatment of PCNSL in transplant patients.\r"

Development of atherosclerosis is accelerated in renal transplant patients and results in an increased incidence of thromboembolic events. Immunosuppressive therapy predisposes to infection with opportunistic organisms, including reactivation of latent viruses and also is associated with an increased incidence of de novo neoplasia. The transplantation procedure may be complicated by a neuropathy and occasionally by distal spinal cord infarction. Some immunosuppressive agents have a direct adverse effect on the nervous system, particularly when toxic levels accumulate in the body. Uremia prior to, and if present after transplantation, has a toxic effect on the nervous system as well. The reasons for these problems are discussed. Awareness of these special problems in renal transplant patients will facilitate their prevention and diagnosis. A recommended diagnostic approach has been outlined. After the etiology has been established, treatment can be tailored to the individual patient.\r"

The onset of seizures in the early postoperative period is associated with embolic cerebral infarction. Seizures occur most commonly, however, as a neurotoxic manifestation of cyclosporine. The onset of an acute delirium or psychosis in the first week after cardiac transplantation usually has multiple causative factors and is reversible. A postoperative brachial plexopathy or mononeuropathy can be identified with a neurologic examination, confirmed by appropriate electrophysiologic testing and is usually reversible. The onset of periorbital inflammation, ophthalmoplegia, and nasal turbinate or sinus invasion and necrosis is consistent with phycomycosis. Most patients, however, present with nonspecific findings of impaired mentation with or without focal neurologic signs. These patients require a fairly systematic search for potentially treatable neurologic complications (see Table 3). In a medically stable patient an aggressive diagnostic approach, at times including stereotaxic brain aspirate or biopsy, is indicated. In the severely ill patient with multiple organ failure, empirical therapy for the most probable treatable disorder is justified.\r"

Major CNS complications included hypoxic encephalopathy (20 per cent), cerebral and spinal-cord infarction (7 per cent), and seizures (13 per cent). These appeared to be closely associated with cardiovascular collapse or cardiac arrest that often occurred following septic, hemorrhagic, or additional surgical-anesthetic stresses, removed in time from the transplantation. When patients who died of sudden cardiorespiratory arrest were included, the overall frequency of global cerebral ischemia was 33 per cent. The occurrence of herpes zoster neuritis (13 per cent) was contrasted with the lack of CNS infections. The possible associations of visual hallucinations with cyclosporine therapy (7 per cent), CSF pleocytosis with OKT3 therapy (7 per cent), and compressive neuropathy with operative-anesthetic monitoring (7 per cent) were discussed in relation to previous reports in the literature. Randomized controlled clinical studies were suggested to distinguish more clearly the complications due to pancreas transplantation from those due to the natural history of the underlying diabetes and to distinguish the beneficial and adverse effects of pancreas transplants from those of coexisting renal transplants.\r"

The second most common complication is CNS infection with fungi and viruses. Cerebrovascular disorders are the third most common neurologic problem, and most are related to underlying endocarditis (either infectious or nonbacterial thrombotic endocarditis). Less common neurologic complications include side effects of drugs, recurrence of malignancy, and treatment-induced leukoencephalopathy.

Following BMT, the recipient may develop GVHD when it appears that immunocompetent donor lymphocytes react to host antigens. Acute and chronic GVHD represent two distinct syndromes. Acute GVHD has not been associated with primary neurologic involvement. Polymyositis has been reported in 12 patients with chronic GVHD, with the most common underlying illness being aplastic anemia. The clinical, serologic, and muscle biopsy features of the myositis in GVHD have been similar to those observed in idiopathic polymyositis. Weakness was moderate to severe and responded to prednisone, sometimes with the addition of azathioprine. Prognosis depended upon the underlying disease and not on the severity of the myositis. MG occurs rarely in chronic GVHD. Most patients with MG and GVHD have had aplastic anemia; those with aplastic anemia are more likely to have anti-AchR prior to BMT. The clinical manifestations of GVHD MG have not differed from classic autoimmune MG; each patient had elevated antiacetylcholine receptor antibodies titers. All patients have responded well to cholinesterase inhibitors but have received other immunosuppressants. These observations suggest that aplastic anemia is an important host factor in the development of the autoimmune disorders seen with chronic GVHD, certainly of myositis and MG. Herpes zoster peripheral nerve infections have occurred in patients with chronic GVHD. One patient had mononeuritis multiplex. In both acute and chronic GVHD, CNS impairment is usually caused by metabolic encephalopathy or infection. Primary CNS involvement has not been recognized.\r"

Eligible patients had hypogammaglobulinemia, a history of infection, or both. The patients receiving immunoglobulin had significantly fewer bacterial infections during the study period than those receiving placebo (23 vs. 42; P = 0.01). This reduction was most striking in the patients who completed a full year of treatment (14 vs. 36; P = 0.001). The period from study entry to the first serious bacterial infection was significantly longer in the patients receiving immunoglobulin (P = 0.026). There was no significant difference between the two groups in the incidence of nonbacterial infection. Immunoglobulin therapy was tolerated well; there were no serious adverse reactions, and the incidence of minor reactions was low. We conclude that selected patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia who are at risk of bacterial infection can be substantially protected from this complication by the regular intravenous administration of immunoglobulin.\r"

Altogether, 98 patients received placebo and 102 received dexamethasone (0.15 mg per kilogram of body weight every six hours for four days). At the beginning of therapy, the clinical and demographic characteristics of the patients in the treatment groups were comparable. The mean increase in the cerebrospinal fluid concentration of glucose and the decreases in lactate and protein levels after 24 hours of therapy were significantly greater in those who received dexamethasone than in those who received placebo (glucose, 2.0 vs. 0.4 mmol per liter [36.0 vs. 6.9 mg per deciliter], P less than 0.001; lactate, 4.0 vs. 2.1 mmol per liter [38.3 vs. 19.8 mg per deciliter], P less than 0.001; and protein, 0.64 vs. 0.25 g per liter [64.0 vs. 25.3 mg per deciliter], P less than 0.05). One patient in the placebo group in Study 1 died. As compared with those who received placebo, the patients who received dexamethasone became afebrile earlier (1.6 vs. 5.0 days; P less than 0.001) and were less likely to acquire moderate or more severe bilateral sensorineural hearing loss (15.5 vs. 3.3 percent; P less than 0.01). Twelve patients in the two placebo groups (14 percent) had severe or profound bilateral hearing loss requiring the use of a hearing aid, as compared with 1 (1 percent) in the two dexamethasone groups (P less than 0.001). We conclude that dexamethasone is beneficial in the treatment of infants and children with bacterial meningitis, particularly in preventing deafness.\r"

  ".W": "Associations between bacteria and their accessory elements (viruses, plasmids and transposons) range from antagonistic to mutualistic. A number of previous studies have demonstrated that plasmid carriage reduces bacterial fitness in the absence of selection for specific functions such as antibiotic resistance. Many studies have demonstrated increased fitness of evolving microbial populations in laboratory environments, but we are aware of only one study in which fitness gains were partitioned between a plasmid and its host. Here, we examine the evolution of an association between a plasmid and its bacterial host. Carriage of the non-conjugative plasmid pACYC184 initially reduced the fitness of Escherichia coli B in the absence of antibiotic. We then cultured plasmid-bearing bacteria for 500 generations in the presence of antibiotic. The fitness of each combination of host and plasmid, with and without the culture history, was determined by competing it against a baseline strain. The results indicate adaptation by the host genome, but no plasmid adaptation. We also competed the evolved host, transformed with the baseline plasmid, against its isogenic plasmid-free counterpart. The plasmid now increased the fitness of its host.\r"

Anti-viral agents, immunomodulators, and inhibitors of specific HIV functions are being tested as potential treatments to alleviate the high morbidity and mortality. An alternative therapeutic concept involves the development of cytotoxic agents that are targeted to kill HIV-infected cells. Here we describe the purification and characterization of a recombinant protein produced in Escherichia coli that contains the HIV-binding portion of the human CD4 molecule linked to active regions of Pseudomonas exotoxin A. This hybrid protein displays selective toxicity toward cells expressing the HIV envelope glycoprotein and thus represents a promising novel therapeutic agent for the treatment of AIDS.\r"

Appropriate function of this protein, termed VP16, depends on an acidic transcriptional activation domain located within the 78 carboxyl-terminal amino acids of the protein. Mutated forms of the protein lacking this acidic domain lose the ability to activate transcription, and can dominantly interfere with the trans-activation function of native VP16 (ref. 1). We have prepared stably transformed mouse L cells that constitutively express a form of VP16 lacking its acidic activating domain. In this report we show that these cells are selectively impaired in their capacity to support the lytic infectious cycle of HSV-1, and that this impairment results from their inability to support immediate early transcription.\r"

As spacing systems have important consequences for ecological processes such as population regulation, competition and mating systems, there have been many attempts to explore factors that may cause this variation. For mammals, it has been argued that the spatial distribution of sexually receptive females is the most important factor determining the spacing system of males, whereas habitat characteristics are most important to females. This has been difficult to test experimentally as it requires manipulations of the spatial distribution of the opposite sex without changing other properties of the environment. Here, I present a novel experimental procedure that can achieve this and demonstrate that the spatial distribution of the opposite sex in a population of voles is indeed an important determinant of the spacing system of males, but not of females. However, the effects on males are different from those predicted by many theoretical studies.\r"

The increased uptake appears to be due to mobilization of glucose transporters from an intracellular location to the plasma membrane and to enhanced intrinsic activity of the transporters. Little is known about the insulin-generated signals causing these changes. Phorbol esters have been shown to mimic the insulin effect, but phosphorylation of the transporter does not seem to be involved. A phospho-oligosaccharide was recently shown to mimic the effects of insulin on protein phosphorylation, suggesting that it could be a mediator for some intracellular metabolic effects of the hormone, but it did not affect glucose uptake. A diacyglycerol is produced in the plasma membrane in conjunction with the generation of the phospho-oligosaccharide. Here I show that added 1,2-diacylglycerols potently increase glucose transporter-mediated uptake of glucose in rat adipocytes, but without activation of protein kinase C.\r"

  ".U": "88334752\r", 
  ".W": "Recent work has defined a class of transcriptional activators, members of which activate transcription in yeast, plant, insect and mammalian cells. These proteins contain two parts: one directs DNA binding and the other, called the activating region, presumably interacts with some component of the transcriptional machinery. Activating regions are typically acidic and require some poorly-understood aspect of structure, probably at least in part an alpha-helix. Here we describe a new member of this class, formed by fusing a DNA-binding fragment of the yeast activator GAL4 to a highly acidic portion of the herpes simplex virus protein VP16 (ref. 11; also called Vmw65). VP16 activates transcription of immediate early viral genes by using its amino-terminal sequences to attach to one or more host-encoded proteins that recognise DNA sequences in their promoters. We show that the hybrid protein (GAL4-VP16) activates transcription unusually efficiently in mammalian cells when bound close to, or at large distances from the gene. We suggest that the activating region of VP16 may be near-maximally potent and that it is not coincidental that such a strong activator is encoded by a virus.\r"

Cholesteatoma, a pathological entity often confused with cholesterol granuloma, is differentiated from cholesterol granuloma. Cholesterol granuloma is not rare. This tumor seems to derive from an inflammatory process at the skull base that results in bony erosion surrounding a cyst wall of inflammatory tissue. Neurological abnormalities reflect the location of the tumor in relation to the brain stem. Radiographically, the cyst wall enhances with the administration of i.v. contrast agent, and the center of the lesion is isodense with brain on computed tomography, unlike cholesteatoma. Magnetic resonance imaging characteristics are currently being defined. At operation, cholesterol granuloma consists primarily of a viscous fluid within a capsule of inflammatory tissue. Treatment requires establishing a pathway for drainage of the granuloma. The advantages of transsphenoidal, transclival drainage of such lesions are outlined.\r"

Progressive dementia or psychosis is typically the first and most prominent feature. Parkinsonian signs, initially mild or absent, become common eventually, and rigidity is usually severe. Involuntary movements, myoclonus, quadriparesis in flexion, orthostatic hypotension, and dysphagia have also been noted. Classic, concentric Lewy bodies are found profusely in the brainstem, basal forebrain, and hypothalamic nuclei, while less well defined \"Lewy-like\" bodies occur in limbic structures and in deep neocortical layers. In addition, focal spongiform changes in the mesial temporal lobe were found in two of our cases. We suggest that DLBD may be another specific cause of progressive dementia.\r"

Two amyloidogenic proteins have been isolated from the brains of humans and animals with neurodegenerative diseases--beta-protein from Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Down's syndrome, and prion protein (PrP) from scrapie and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD). Using monoclonal antibodies to a synthetic peptide corresponding to a portion of beta-protein and rabbit antiserum to hamster scrapie PrP 27-30, we examined in situ amyloid plaques on sections from cases of neurodegenerative diseases, including cases with a spectrum of plaque types. Anti-beta-peptide stained cerebrovascular and plaque core amyloid in all AD cases as well as cerebrovascular amyloid and senile plaque core amyloid in five elderly CJD cases. Anti-PrP stained plaques in CJD, kuru, and Gerstmann-Straussler syndrome cases but not cerebrovascular amyloid or plaques in AD. Dual localization experiments showed that in cases with a mixture of plaque types, the antibodies identified different populations of plaques that showed anatomic heterogeneity. Colocalization of the two proteins was not observed in any plaque type. The data suggest that in neurodegenerative diseases two major plaque types exist, which have different etiologic origins. Our results emphasize the need for classification of CNS amyloids based not on their morphology but on the macromolecular components comprising these pathologic polymers.\r"

These antibodies were mainly of the IgM-class; they disappeared in all seven CIDP patients retested after improvement following intravenous IgG treatment (IV-IgG) and were present in only 5% of serum from patients with other disorders. Absorption studies showed a partial homology between the NBL 108cc15 and human sciatic nerve. In vitro studies showed that IgG from pooled normal donors (IV-IgG) inhibits the reaction between serum from a CIDP patient and the NBL cell line.

The apparent protective effect of toxemia could not be explained by intrauterine growth retardation, mode of delivery, or maternal receipt of any medication. Infants born to toxemic women were less likely than their peers to develop pneumothorax, become acidotic, and to require extensive respiratory assistance. This apparently protective effect of maternal toxemia was not seen in infants born to nontoxemic, hypertensive women. Thus, maternal toxemia, but not hypertension, might reduce the risk of germinal matrix hemorrhage by reducing the occurrence and/or severity of pulmonary and related problems that place infants at high risk of germinal matrix hemorrhage.\r"

The pregnancies were studied by repeat ultrasound examinations between five and 12 weeks' gestation. First-trimester bleeding was the only clinical sign of this phenomenon. Postpartum evidence of the vanishing twin phenomenon was found in five cases. Morphologically, the lesions were characterized by well-delineated plaques of perivillous fibrin deposition, associated in one case with embryonic remnants. This focal degenerative change of the placental mass, which also exists in about 25% of placentas from uncomplicated term pregnancies, may be the only clue to the disappearance of one conceptus.\r"

Follow-up sonography two to five weeks after the initial scan documented disappearance of the cysts in all cases. The course of pregnancy in these patients was otherwise uneventful, and all infants were normal physically and neurologically both at the time of birth and between four and 24 months of follow-up.\r"

Several biometric measurements were obtained throughout pregnancy, including the cerebrofrontal horn distance of the lateral ventricle, the frontal hemispheric width, and the calculated ratio of cerebrofrontal horn distance/hemispheric width. Curvilinear relationships were found between cerebrofrontal horn distance and gestational age (R2 = 0.597; P less than .0001) and between cerebrofrontal horn distance and the biparietal diameter (R2 = 0.618; P less than .0001). In addition, a curvilinear relationship existed between cerebrofrontal horn distance/hemispheric width ratio and gestational age (R2 = 0.492; P less than .0001) and biparietal diameter (R2 = 0.930; P less than .0001). These data represent a comprehensive characterization of normal growth of the fetal frontal horns. They provide a method by which variations from the norm can be assessed and early prenatal diagnosis of developmental anomalies of the fetal ventricular system can be made.\r"

The purpose of this study was to compare the S/D ratios obtained by both types of instrumentation to determine whether there are significant differences between measurement values. Umbilical velocimetry was performed on 200 high-risk pregnancies in the third trimester using the Angioscan III to obtain continuous-wave velocimetry and the General Electric RT3600 to obtain pulsed-wave velocimetry. Systolic to diastolic ratios were considered abnormally high if they were greater than 3. One hundred sixty-five patients had normal S/D ratios and 35 patients had elevated ratios on both continuous-wave and pulsed-wave ultrasound. There was no significant difference in the mean S/D ratios obtained by either method for the entire population (continuous-wave S/D 2.81 +/- 1.79, pulsed-wave S/D 2.71 +/- 1.83, R = 0.98), the normal group (continuous-wave S/D 1.96 +/- 0.41, pulsed-wave S/D 1.95 +/- 0.40, R = 0.91), and the abnormal group (continuous-wave S/D 6.23 +/- 1.58, pulsed-wave S/D 6.35 +/- 1.52, R = 0.94). Least-square regression was performed to model the relationships between pulsed wave and continuous wave, with both used as dependent variables.

The following cutoff values were used to indicate abnormal test results: 1) umbilical artery peak systolic to end-diastolic ratio (S/D) above 3, 2) estimated fetal weight below the tenth percentile for gestational age, 3) head circumference to abdominal circumference ratio more than 2 SD above the mean for gestational age, 4) femur length to abdominal circumference ratio above 23.5%, and 5) qualitative amniotic fluid volume less than 2 cm. The study population consisted of 127 patients referred with a clinical suspicion of IUGR. Forty-five infants (35%) were small for gestational age. None of these five tests were uniformly successful in identifying growth-retarded infants. Overall, the best predictor appeared to be estimated fetal weight below the tenth percentile for gestational age, which correctly identified 39 of the 45 IUGR infants (sensitivity 87%, specificity 87%). The sensitivity of this test was nearly twice that of any other test. All indices performed similarly in predicting the non-IUGR infant (range of specificities 87-98%).\r"

Eighty-three percent of 160 SGA infants were identified antenatally by means of intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR) risk scoring, and the pregnancies were supervised at a high-risk clinic. Fifty percent were delivered electively, predominantly in gestational weeks 38-39. Thirty percent were born preterm. The cesarean section rate was 40%. Perinatal mortality was 6%, or 4% when lethal malformations were excluded, ten times higher than the corresponding total population figures. Eleven percent of the fetuses had severe malformations. In the remaining SGA population, one infant died after experiencing severe perinatal asphyxia and another developed cerebral palsy; no other major sequelae were found before the age of 18 months. Hypoglycemia and hypothermia occurred frequently, but these problems were managed satisfactorily. The mean hospital stay for term infants was twice that of appropriate for gestational age infants. We conclude that the extra attention paid to the SGA population is well motivated. Future efforts should be directed toward improving the diagnostic techniques for IUGR, as most of the perinatal mortality occurred among SGA infants not identified before birth.\r"

The risk for spontaneous abortion related to amniocentesis, combined with increasing confidence in the accuracy of ultrasound diagnosis, has caused us to question the need for amniocentesis in the diagnostic workup of pregnancies complicated by elevated levels of AFP in maternal serum. A retrospective study of 257 pregnancies evaluated for elevated serum AFP levels revealed 16 fetal malformations diagnosed by amniotic fluid AFP and acetylcholinesterase. Only 12 of these malformations were diagnosed on the initial ultrasound study. All malformations were diagnosed when ultrasound examination was repeated for increased acetylcholinesterase activity. Earlier gestational age at scanning, smaller defects, and pure technical failure were implicated as causes of misdiagnosis. The rate of fetal malformations identified in this high-risk population (6.23%) and the rate of ultrasound misdiagnosis (1.5% of the population with elevated levels of MSAFP) imply that amniocentesis should still be considered an essential part of the diagnostic workup in these situations.\r"

Overall, the sensitivity of clinical impression and original ultrasound was poor. Sensitivity and specificity were highest for CA 125 assays in postmenopausal patients, especially when these were used as the second diagnostic test. Positive and negative predictive values significantly increased among postmenopausal patients when CA 125 was added to any of the other diagnostic tests examined. In conjunction with such tests, measurement of serum CA 125 significantly increased diagnostic accuracy and may thus have an important role in the preoperative evaluation of women with ovarian masses.\r"

However, such clinical observations may be misleading and ideally should be validated by standardized quantitative measurements. We describe here an ultrasonographic methodology that has provided quantitative data describing the normal fetal craniofacies at 16 weeks of gestation. This report is part of an ongoing research project directed at describing fetal facial morphology in utero at different gestational ages. Such data can be used to construct growth curves to which observations from suspected abnormal fetuses can be compared. A total of 53 patients were evaluated at 16 weeks of gestation, at which time 24 craniofacial linear and angular measurements were made. The landmarks employed for these measurements were those used in roentgencephalometry so that this fetal data base could be related to postnatal populations. Such data will contribute not only to a description of facial dysmorphogenesis but also to a better understanding of normal facial growth and development. Furthermore, they constitute a useful tool for prenatal diagnosis, gestational aging, growth predictions, and perhaps for as yet relatively unexplored fields such as fetal therapy.\r"

Some patients, however, provide examples of overlap and it may be useful to think of CMPS in terms of the Venn diagram depicted in Fig. 2. In this report we have attempted an initial classification for a group of common and perplexing chronic pain disorders of the musculoskeletal system which at present have no identifiable cause. Previous investigations have been hampered by erroneous pathological concepts, heterogeneous patient populations and poor study design particularly with respect to treatment modalities. We hope that this classification, while empirical, will lead to needed epidemiological studies outlining the similarities and differences between these clinically observable and different musculoskeletal syndromes. We hope, further, that it will foster cooperation between different medical disciplines so that clinical biases might be tested in light of current concepts of the scientific method.\r"

Additionally, the continued epidemiologic surveillance of children with cancer serves to form the foundation from which we will assess any future changes in childhood cancer incidence or pattern. Although not discussed here, the epidemiology of late effects, including second malignancies, reproductive function, and neuropsychologic functioning will assume a more prominent role as more children survive ALL and move into adulthood. While analytic studies have yet to yield an association as strong as the lung cancer/cigarette association in adults, future research designed to isolate biologically homogeneous disease populations for study may lead us to new and important associations. The continued cooperation of large pediatric oncology groups and private physicians is crucial as these future investigations are undertaken.\r"

Molecular analysis of the disordered structure or disrupted regulation of genes located at critical chromosomal breakpoints in leukemic cells should continue to provide important insight into normal and aberrant hematopoietic cell function.\r"

In order to achieve these results very intensive therapy is required. The morbidity and mortality of treatment are high. The length of therapy needed after induction of remission is not known. Whether or not maintenance therapy is required is perhaps related most directly to the intensity of the therapy employed. Similarly, the role of bone marrow transplantation in patients in first remission, treatment of CNS leukemia, and treatment of chloromas are controversial. There is general agreement that WBCs over 100,000, acute monoblastic leukemia in infants less than 2 years of age, and certain chromosomal abnormalities are associated with a poor prognosis. Although there has been a dramatic improvement in the treatment of ANLL over the past 15 years, stratification of therapy based on biologic parameters, and alteration of treatment based on the early responses to treatment may be required before further advances will be made.\r"

Combinations of therapeutic modalities which include CNS RT appear to be the most neurotoxic. The least neurotoxic combination of two modalities appears to be the IT MTX with high-dose intravenous MTX. Thus far, high-dose MTX appear to be the safest single modality, in terms of acute, subacute, and delayed neurotoxicity. The improved outcome in intellectual and academic performance in the NCI-191/CCG-134P conjoint trial of the CCSG and the Pediatric Branch described above (see section of Presymptomatic CNS Therapy) appears to confirm this observation. Whether triple IT chemotherapy will have the same result remains to be established. If CNS RT must be combined with MTX therapy, the least neurotoxic approach appears to be to administer these modalities in sequence, IT MTX, or high-dose intravenous MTX followed by CNS RT. MTX given during or after CNS RT appears from the clinical data to be more likely to produce severe neurologic sequelae. An ultimate goal would be to avoid both ionizing RT and IT chemotherapy. To this end, the NCI/CCSG study has demonstrated that this may be possible, except for those patients who are at the highest risk for CNS relapse despite conventional CNS prophylaxis. Meanwhile, for presymptomatic therapy, either cranial RT (18 Gy total dose at 120-180 cGy per day) in conjunction with IT MTX, or frequent IT chemotherapy with MTX, cytarabine, and hydrocortisone combined and administered throughout induction, consolidation, and maintenance is eminently justified in the majority of children with ALL. On a worldwide basis, chemoradiotherapy with cranial RT and IT MTX remains the established method of preventing overt CNS leukemia. The benefits of this intervention, in terms of prevention of symptomatic CNS leukemia, prolongation of complete remission, and increased cure rates, are clearly worth the risks.\r"

Newer strategies, such as partially matched donor, unrelated matched donor, and autologous transplants, are bineg pursued to overcome the histocompatability barrier. The development of more effective antileukemic cytoreductive chemotherapy and radiation therapy regimens and better methods of preventing GVHD are areas in which further improvements are necessary. Newer methods of marrow purging, such as the use of monoclonal antibodies linked to immunotoxins, already are being tested. In addition, the recent development of molecularly cloned hematopoietic growth factors, such as CSFGM, may make it possible to improve marrow recovery and hasten return of normal immunologic function, thereby increasing the overall safety of the transplant procedure. It is hoped that these innovations eventually will increase the overall applicability of BMT and its role in the treatment of leukemia.\r"

Patients were visited at home 30 days after discharge and reassessed on each of the above variables except that their behavior was substituted for intentions and societal adjustment was assessed. The experimental group was given an intervention program which included a discussion of assessment data, identification of problems, and establishment of goals. The assessment was repeated 60 days after discharge. No differences were found between experimental and control groups for either medical regimen adherence or societal adjustment. There was a significant decrease in mean scores for all variables from hospital to 30 days for both groups, but no change from 30 to 60 days. Attitudes and perceived beliefs of others were predictive of adherence, and it was concluded that these variables need to be included in any rehabilitation program.\r"

The hospital has a built-in marketing force with the nursing department, because nurses are in constant, direct contact with the customer. Nursing must identify the case mix profile of the community and focus the hospital product lines to meet community needs. The nursing department should decentralize, change, measure, and innovate the staff mix needed to operationalize these product lines. The development of nursing practice standards for the case mix will help to identify the staff mix needed and create systems to efficiently manage the product lines. Nursing management must become aware of cross-subsidization and downward skill substitution of nursing personnel. Nursing information systems must generate quality reports that invoke cost consciousness on the part of nursing staff. Quality assurance programs must become unit based and complete with frequent audits to correlate length of stay with nursing quality. Correlations must be determined between nursing productivity and case mix to determine the hospital's niche in the marketplace. The transformation of health care into a competitive business industry has created many opportunities for nursing. The health care industry's incentives for efficiency along with the decreasing demand for inpatient hospital services will be the forces driving health care toward a competitive marketplace. The hospital's nursing department should be strategically positioned to become accountable for increasing market share and enhancing quality patient outcomes. The focus has shifted from the theoretical to the tactical, which is a step in the right direction, particularly for nursing. Nursing, if strategically positioned, will not only thrive but will also excel in this chaotic environment by capturing the opportunities and being innovative.\r"

In all animals a capacitor apparatus was attached externally over the right mandibular ramus; however, a 5-V peak-to-peak sinusoidal signal was applied only in the stimulated group. The experimental period was 6 weeks, with a total of 30 days of constant stimulation. Graft resorption in the stimulated animals was decreased a total of 24.8 percent (p less than 0.001). There appeared to be a trend toward decreased graft resorption caused by the apparatus alone, although this was not statistically significant. The electric field alone decreased resorption by 11.5 percent (p less than 0.05). No distinguishing features were demonstrated by fluorescent vital stains or routine histology.\r"

  ".W": "MR is now the study of choice in evaluating both the acutely and previously injured spinal cord. A number of crucial diagnoses can be made with MR that are difficult to obtain otherwise. The discovery of acute disk herniation in association with a fracture/dislocation may indicate the need to remove the disk and stabilize the patient on a relatively urgent basis, and the approach to the stabilization procedure (either anterior or posterior) can be determined by the MR findings. Hemorrhage outside the cord may require immediate surgical attention, and identification of abnormal signals from the cord itself consistent with hemorrhage or edema may help to explain the patient's clinical status. Our experience indicates that obtaining an MR in acutely injured patients who have incomplete injuries is particularly helpful in their surgical management. The presence of intramedullary or extramedullary cysts in the previously injured spine can explain a worsening clinical picture and direct the surgeon to the proper area (or areas) for decompression. Flow-sensitive studies currently under evaluation are giving a greater insight into the dynamics of these cysts. Late decompression of cord tissue and roots requires accurate preoperative MR evaluation of possible bone or disk impingement on neural tissue. In surgery of both the acute and chronically injured spine, intraoperative sonography plays a crucial role. The adequate shunting of intramedullary and subarachnoid cysts, the confirmation of the efficaciously placed Harrington rods, the demonstration of removal of compressive bone or disk fragments, and the uncovering of important but unanticipated abnormalities such as subligamentous hematoma or an incidentally herniated disk all attest to sonography's value in the operating room. MR preoperatively and sonography intraoperatively are important tools utilized in the care of spine-injured patients.\r"

Detection of two photons emitted from the annihilation of a positron and an electron is used to reconstruct the distribution of a positron-emitting isotope within an organ. PET provides the capacity to measure quantitatively the local tissue distribution of a variety of radionuclides that are attached to compounds that distribute according to function. Commonly measured functions include local cerebral metabolism using 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose or 11C-deoxyglucose, cerebral blood flow, cerebral oxygen utilization, and cerebral blood volume. Clinical applications of PET are multiple, involving normal and disease states. By demonstrating the metabolic alterations, PET adds another dimension to our understanding of the brain, which up until recently has been based on the structural changes seen on CT and MRI.\r"

Complete occlusion is possible by superselective catheterizations and injection of a liquid embolic material. The SDAVFs are slow-flow AV shunting at the dura, which causes progressive neurologic deficit in older age--the fifth or sixth decades of life. Embolization is now the primary mode of treatment. Preoperative embolization of the hypervascular tumors of the spine and spinal cord has become a necessity to reduce bleeding during surgery, and it even reduces the size of the tumor and relieves spinal block. Thorough knowledge of vascular anatomy and better understanding of hemodynamics of these lesions are essential to perform proper and safe embolization.\r"

In the 23 patients, biopsy results were true positive in ten (nine with malignancy, one with tuberculous pleurisy), true negative in ten (confirmed either at subsequent thoracotomy or clinical follow-up), and false negative in three. Complications were few, with a significant pneumothorax occurring in two patients (8.7%). Image-guided biopsy of small pleural lesions and small pleural effusions can be performed by the radiologist who understands the special needles and techniques involved.\r"

  ".W": "The prenatal sonograms of 15 fetuses with sacrococcygeal teratoma were reviewed to determine the sonographic appearance and the role of sonography in the obstetric management. Each tumor appeared as a large mass arising from the fetal rump. The teratomas exhibited three sonographic patterns: nine were mixtures of cystic and solid components in equal proportions, four were predominantly solid with a few scattered anechoic areas, and two were unilocular cystic masses. Calcifications were detected in six cases. There was no correlation between the sonographic appearance and the presence of immature or malignant components. Ultrasonography allowed visualization of an intraabdominal component in six cases and assessment of findings that were of prognostic importance. Prenatal detection and size determination of the external component can play an important role in planning obstetric management because fetuses with a large tumor should be delivered by cesarean section to avoid dystocia and catastrophic hemorrhage during delivery.\r"

  ".W": "Sixteen patients with peripheral cholangiocarcinoma of the liver were examined with computed tomography (CT). None of the 16 patients presented with jaundice or had documented cirrhosis. On scans obtained both before and after the injection of contrast material, the tumors were depicted as low-attenuation masses in all cases, with wide variations in homogeneity. The tumor margin was irregular in 12 cases, and there was minimal contrast enhancement of the tumor in 14 cases. In 11 (69%) patients, CT demonstrated masses of markedly low attenuation, which corresponded to areas of diffuse microcystic change seen at histologic examination of resected specimens. In ten (63%) patients, the results of stool or intradermal tests for Clonorchis sinensis were positive. In all ten cases of clonorchiasis, mild, diffuse dilatation of the intrahepatic bile ducts was seen in addition to the low-attenuation masses, but there was no dilatation of the extrahepatic biliary tree. In five of the ten patients with clonorchiasis, stippled or aggregated, powderlike areas of high attenuation were seen on precontrast CT scans; at pathologic examination, those areas were found to be mucin. Extrahepatic metastases were demonstrated in ten (63%) patients. Peripheral cholangiocarcinoma should be the primary diagnostic consideration when these characteristic CT findings are detected in a noncirrhotic patient.\r"

  ".U": "88336437\r", 
  ".W": "Until the advent of endovaginal ultrasonography (US), transvesical US was the only US technique availab le for evaluation of patients with suspected ectopic gestation. A study was undertaken to assess the predictive ability of transvesical and endovaginal US and determine whether endovaginal US could be used alone. Fifty-three patients who had a positive pregnancy test finding and who were at risk for ectopic pregnancy were examined with both endovaginal and transvesical US. Twenty-nine were examined retrospectively and 24 were examined prospectively. Standard sonographic criteria were used to differentiate between intrauterine pregnancy and ectopic gestation. The clinical or pathologic diagnosis was ectopic pregnancy in 18 patients (34%), normal intrauterine pregnancy in 19 (36%), and abnormal intrauterine pregnancy in 16 (30%). Endovaginal US increased the sensitivity of detecting a live ectopic pregnancy (from 6% to 17%). Endovaginal US, by allowing early diagnosis of intrauterine pregnancy, significantly increased the diagnostic accuracy for ectopic pregnancy (from 60% to 83%). Endovaginal US provided significant additional information in women referred for sonography with a suspected ectopic gestation. On the basis of these findings it is concluded that endovaginal US can be used alone in the majority of women with suspected ectopic gestation.\r"
