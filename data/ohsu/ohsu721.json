  ".W": "Rates of fat mobilization (glycerol turnover), and fuel utilization and energy expenditure (indirect calorimetry) were measured in normal subjects and injured or septic patients maintained on high or low iv intakes of glucose as their sole nutrient source during 3-day periods. Regimens were given consecutively to each subject in random order. Concentrations of glucose, glycerol, fatty acids, 3-hydroxybutyrate, urea, insulin, and glucagon were determined in plasma, and of epinephrine and norepinephrine in urine. In normal subjects, there was no increase in energy expenditure with increasing glucose, although estimated costs of glucose storage as glycogen or fat could account for an increase of 4%. Thus, storage costs of glucose do not necessarily constitute an obligatory increase in energy expenditure. Rates of glycerol turnover and fat oxidation, and plasma glycerol concentrations were lower with the high than the low rate of glucose infusion, and lower than values reported by others during fasting or glucose infusion. Rates of fat oxidation were higher and glucose oxidation lower in patients than in controls, even though insulin concentrations were more than twice as high in patients. This confirms previous studies comparing injured and septic patients to depleted patients or historical controls. Triglyceride cycle activity was higher in the injured and septic patients than in normal subjects, and could account for from 6% to 15% of the increase in energy expenditure, in agreement with reports for burn patients.\r"

  ".W": "Previous studies in victims of blunt injury suggest that the observed neutrophil (PMN) locomotory dysfunction is, in part, due to autoxidation. To further clarify the occurrence and significance of autoxidation, we studied changes in levels of glutathione in PMN and of ascorbic acid and alpha-tocopherol in serum and blood cells of postsurgical and blunt trauma patients. Levels of total, reduced, and oxidized glutathione in PMN from trauma patients were similar to normal controls. Serum and cellular ascorbic acid and alpha-tocopherol levels dropped significantly after injury and remained below normal control levels during the 7 to 8-day study period. Low serum alpha-tocopherol was partially explainable on the basis of changes in serum lipids. When serum samples of trauma patients were thawed unprotected without pyrogallol, there was significant loss of recoverable alpha-tocopherol, whereas no significant losses occurred with unprotected thawed normal sera. Less total reducing capacity was observed in PMN of trauma patients compared with normal controls. These findings indicate that synthesis and regeneration capacity of glutathione are intact but that the levels of the consumable antioxidants, ascorbic acid, and alpha-tocopherol are compromised after injury. These results add further support to the hypothesis that autoxidation occurs in trauma.\r"

During ECMO, left and right ventricular output decreased proportionally to the amount of bypass flow provided (r = -.82 and -.83, respectively; p less than .001), and were accompanied by a decrease in left ventricular contractility. Pulsed Doppler echocardiography provides a noninvasive method to estimate ventricular outputs during ECMO and to evaluate the response of both ventricles to volume loading during weaning from ECMO.\r"

  ".W": "During the course of a critical illness, many patients become ventilator dependent. The standard assessment criteria are not always accurate in predicting potential for extubation. This investigation was designed to analyze whether the work of breathing (WOB) was a more reliable predictor of ventilator dependence. Twenty consecutive ventilator-dependent patients were prospectively studied. Nineteen required ventilator support for greater than 2 wk and all were considered ventilator dependent because of their inability to tolerate weaning trials. The oxygen consumption (VO2) and resting energy expenditure were measured using a metabolic gas monitor. Respiratory mechanics and arterial blood gas measurements were obtained, and the deadspace to tidal volume ratio (VD/VT) was calculated. The WOB was determined by the difference in VO2 between spontaneous and mechanical ventilation, and expressed as a percentage of VO2 during mechanical ventilation. Five of eight patients with a WOB less than 15% (mean 1.9) were extubated within 2 wk of study, while none of 12 patients with a WOB greater than or equal to 15% (mean 34) were able to be extubated in this period. The differences in the WOB between the two groups were statistically significant (p less than .01), while there was no significant difference in mechanics, PaCO2, VD/VT or measured resting energy expenditure. These data support the use of WOB determinations in evaluating extubation potential. Using a reference value for the WOB of 15%, this study had a sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 80%. This proved to be of greater predictive value than traditional criteria.\r"

A review of factors contributing to AE showed the most critical to be: sedation not administered in the 2 h before AE (65%), the lack of two-point or more restraints (58%), and the performance of a patient procedure at the bedside (49%). One death occurred as an indirect consequence of AE. The data are being reported as a function of number of days intubated in an attempt to standardize reporting techniques. The use of standardized reporting and the identification of high-risk factors may be useful for education and modification of patient care practices.\r"

Of the 30 patients undergoing BAL with pneumonia, 27 had one or more pathogens identified in the lavage specimen. Although no patient died as a result of lavage, significant hypoxemia was encountered in some patients undergoing lavage. In 35 patients with the same FIO2 before and after bronchoscopy, the median change in PO2 was -8.0 torr (range -63.0 to +29.0).

Our purpose was to evaluate the Revised Trauma Index (RTI) as a triage tool for both its severity prediction ability and triage accuracy. A total of 2,340 trauma admissions were evaluated using the RTI and the Injury Severity Score (ISS). The data were submitted to standardized statistical analysis and compared to other published data for under and overtriage. Our results show a linear correlation between the RTI and the ISS with a correlation coefficient of .62. There is 5% death rate at an RTI level of 15, which yields a 5% undertriage rate for death and a 37.3% overtriage rate for predicting an ISS greater than 15. This compares to under and overtriage rates for the Trauma Score, CRAMS, Pre-Hospital Index, and Mechanism of Injury scales varying from 19% to 56% undertriage and 7% to 82% overtriage. We reached the following conclusions. a) The RTI is a simple, fast triage tool for predicting major trauma. b) The RTI is related to the ultimate ISS. c) Use of an RTI greater than or equal to 15 results in an acceptable undertriage rate, with a better rate for overtriage than existing scores. d) Therefore, we recommend the RTI for use in emergency medical direction and bypass protocols.\r"

LVEF was measured by impedance (ZEF) and multiple-gated scans (MEF) while in the supine position. The control group ZEF averaged 72% (range 67% to 78%) and the MEF averaged 71% (range 65% to 77%). There were no differences between the average ZEF (56 +/- 1%) and MEF (53 +/- 2%) in the patients. Correlations, however, between ZEF and MEF were unacceptably low for the several clinical populations within this group (-0.17 to 0.16). Furthermore, MEF correlated well with regional wall motion (r = .84) while ZEF did not (r = .00). Subdividing the patients according to heart function as determined by regional wall motion failed to improve the correlation between MEF and ZEF. The use of a previously published regression equation to predict LVEF from the systolic time interval ratio of pre-ejection period/left ventricular ejection time derived from the impedance cardiogram also proved ineffective. These data suggest that the previously proposed analysis of the impedance cardiogram to measure LVEF should not be used to make a clinical diagnosis.\r"

Using the algorithm results in an objective determination of limitation to exercise and allows for the differentiation between pulmonary and cardiac or circulatory limitation. This straightforward technique for arriving at an interpretation of these tests has resulted in a more consistent approach to interpretation and an excellent teaching guide for physicians and technicians.\r"

  ".U": "90125923\r", 
  ".W": "In patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) studied at rest, nifedipine releases hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction (HPV) and worsens gas exchange. During exercise, this drug lowers pulmonary hypertension, but the effects of this lower pulmonary vascular tone on ventilation-perfusion (VA/Q) relationships are still poorly understood. To analyze them, we determined the VA/Q distributions in eight patients with stable COPD (FEV1, 36 percent of predicted) at rest and during exercise (60 percent VO2 max), before and after nifedipine (20 mg sublingually). Nifedipine shifted to the right the pulmonary pressure-flow relationship (p less than 0.01) and increased the dispersion of the blood flow distribution at rest and during exercise (p less than 0.005). These observations strongly suggest that nifedipine released HPV under both conditions. However, even after releasing HPV by nifedipine, exercise distributed blood flow more homogeneously than at rest (p less than 0.05). Besides, exercise greatly decreased the overall degree of VA/Q mismatching (p less than 0.001) not only before but also after nifedipine. Thus, we postulate that most of the VA/Q improvement that exercise may induce in patients with COPD, as it is shown here, is due to improvement in the ventilation distribution. Interestingly, this VA/Q improvement was not paralleled by a significant decrease of P(A-a)O2. This apparent paradox could be explained by 20 percent of the actual P(A-a)O2 during exercise due to diffusion limitation, as assessed through the inert gas approach. Taken all together, these results help to better understand the mechanisms that govern pulmonary gas exchange during exercise in COPD.\r"

  ".W": "Studies of the limited exercise capacity in patients with COPD have not assessed the recovery phase, although the phenomenon of increased oxygen uptake after exercise has been thoroughly investigated in normal subjects. Therefore, we compared the recovery of gas exchange variables and HR after maximal cycle ergometry in 16 patients with varying severities of airflow obstruction and ten aged control subjects. Aerobic capacity was reduced in the patients with COPD, and the rates of recovery of VE, VO2, VCO2, excess VCO2, and HR were all significantly slower in the patients with COPD than in the controls. When expressed as the half-time for recovery, patients with COPD had values which were approximately twice that of control subjects for gas exchange and HR. The extent of recovery was similar in patients and controls. We conclude that in patients with COPD, postexercise relative hyperpnea and hypermetabolism are significantly prolonged. In addition, impaired elimination of increased body stores of carbon dioxide may contribute to impaired adjustment to acid-base disorders in these patients.\r"

Before the study all patients were on regular treatment with inhaled salbutamol for six months. At the beginning of the study, response of FEV1 to inhaled salbutamol was measured. Dose-response curves were measured after three weeks of treatment with ipratropium bromide and again after a three-week course of inhaled salbutamol. After ipratropium bromide treatment, responses to low doses of salbutamol tended to be larger than after salbutamol treatment, but differences were not significant. Three hours after the last inhalation of salbutamol the FEV1 was lower on days 1 and 42 than on day 21. We conclude that long-term inhalation therapy with beta 2-agonists in patients with COPD decreases the duration of the bronchodilation produced by the same agents but does not affect the peak response.\r"

All testing was done with ambient air. Calibrated syringe testing examined the ability of the spirometers to accurately measure the output of a 3 L calibrating syringe under varying conditions. The accuracy, FVC volume linearity, and stability of each spirometer was determined from these data. All but five of 42 spirometers accurately measured a 3 L calibrating syringe to within +/- 3 percent. Dynamic waveform testing consisted of introducing 24 standard waveforms into the spirometer from a computer-controlled air pump. The values of FVC, FEV1, and FEF25-75% were compared to the actual values for each waveform to determine a performance rating. Only 35 (56.5 percent) of the spirometers performed acceptably when measuring the 24 standard waveforms. Nine (14.5 percent) were marginal and 18 (29.0 percent) were unacceptable. Fifty-nine (95 percent) of the 62 spirometers were computerized. Software errors were found in 25 percent of the computerized systems evaluated. Although using a 3 L syringe for quality control purposes is essential, simple testing of spirometers with a 3 L calibrating syringe for validation purposes was inadequate to assess spirometer performance when compared to dynamic waveform testing. Dynamic waveform testing is essential to accurately measure and validate acceptability of spirometer system performance.\r"

Mean change between rest and exercise for all the above parameters was not significantly different among BH patients compared with controls. Nonspecific ST-T changes at rest (p less than 0.001) and exercise (p less than 0.005) were more common and mean corrected QT interval was significantly longer (p less than 0.001) in BH patients. The parallel exercise response that we found in BH and normotensives would not appear to substantiate the view that ergometry is particularly useful as a modality for diagnosing hypertension in young females.\r"

We evaluated 15 men with severe OSA and 10 nonapneic control subjects matched for age and weight in order to determine if PCSA, inspiratory pharyngeal airflow resistance, and abnormal breathing events during sleep were associated with alterations in the flow-volume relationship and other awake PFTs. Pharyngeal cross-sectional area was determined by CT, and pharyngeal resistance between choanae and epiglottis was measured during quiet awake breathing. In patients with OSA, there was an inverse relationship between the mean cross-sectional area of the oropharynx and the ratio of FEF50%/FIF50% (rs = -0.54; p = 0.03). In all subjects, pharyngeal resistance was inversely related to percentage of predicted values for FEF25-75% (rs = -0.56; p = 0.01). The frequency of apneas during sleep was significantly (p less than 0.05) related to the percentage of predicted values for MVV, TLC, FVC, and PIF. Obesity appears to account for the strength of these relationships. Flow-volume loops and other PFTs did not distinguish patients with OSA from controls.\r"

In order to determine which physiologic factors measured during wakefulness might contribute to the development of nocturnal hypoxemia, we performed multiple stepwise linear regression analyses in 48 patients with stable COPD with mean and lowest nocturnal SaO2 as dependent variables. It was concluded that the two chief variables, measured while awake, which are associated with alterations in nocturnal oxygenation in patients with COPD are baseline awake SaO2 and PaCO2. Hypercapnia appears to be a risk factor for the development of nocturnal hypoxemia in patients who are normoxic while awake.\r"

We compared the CT quantitation of emphysema with mean lung density, overall lung volume on CT and pulmonary function tests in 85 patients. There was a significant correlation between the extent of emphysema on CT and FEV/FVC percent of predicted, functional residual capacity percent predicted and Dsb percent predicted. Determination of the percentage of lung with areas of low attenuation by CT provides a useful method for quantitating emphysema in life and correlates significantly with pulmonary function tests.\r"

In these patients, rapid and shallow breathing has been hypothesized to be a compensatory mechanism that prevents more severe fatigue from taking place. To test these hypotheses, we studied the effects of VM resting in a group of patients with severe COPD. Eleven clinically stable patients with COPD and chronic hypercapnia were studied. Six of them (group A) had a seven-day period of negative pressure-assisted ventilation (NPV), and five (group B) with similar functional characteristics served as a control group. Compared with a normal age-matched control group, both A and B groups exhibited significantly lower tidal volume (VT), inspiratory time (TI), total time of the respiratory cycle (Ttot) and Ti/Ttot ratio, decrease in muscle strength, and greater electromyographic activity of diaphragm (EMGd) and parasternal muscles, but similar ventilation and VT/TI. After the study period, group A exhibited significant increase in VT, Ti, and TI/Ttot (p less than 0.05), and decrease in PaCO2 (p less than 0.05), EMGd, and EMGint (p less than 0.05 for both), and a slight but significant increase in maximal inspiratory pressure (MIP) (p less than 0.05). These data suggest that NPV rests VM, increases their strength, and reduces hypercapnia in patients with severe COPD.\r"

After observing marked cricopharyngeal dysfunction with aspiration in three patients who had frequent and severe exacerbations of COPD, we performed pharyngoesophageal examinations with videotaping in another 22 nonrandomized patients. Cineradiography or videofluoroscopic recording with capabilities of slow-motion and freeze-frame playback is mandatory, since the transit time of the bolus through the pharynx is rapid. Severe cricopharyngeal dysfunction was observed in 17 elderly patients with COPD. Deglutition disorders were elicited by careful questioning in 15 of these. In eight subjects, cricopharyngeal myotomy resulted in improvement of swallowing and complete or partial relief of acute exacerbations of respiratory distress. In one subject, myotomy relieved only the swallowing problem. The mechanism of cricopharyngeal dysfunction in elderly patients with COPD is unknown at this time, but may be related to gastroesophageal reflux, therapeutic agents, and/or alterations in pharyngoesophageal anatomic structures. We conclude that investigations for swallowing disorders should be considered in patients with COPD who have frequent acute exacerbations of respiratory distress.\r"

The corresponding figures during opportunistic infections were 12.8 +/- 10.1 percent and 12.5 +/- 14.3 percent. No such change was observed during routine normal biopsies. Regular home spirometry offered early detection of these complications allowing early transbronchial lung biopsy as well as assessing efficacy of their therapy. Above all, measurements can be made daily, which is unique in the assessment of solid organ transplants.\r"

The first part of the study was performed with nasal oxygen on seven subjects and the second part, with TTO on 17 subjects. Nasal oxygen results indicate improved delivery efficiency with more rapid response. The TTO results indicate no significant change for each delay setting, but there was improvement in delivery efficiency when DODS was combined with TTO vs continuous flow TTO. Thus, early inspiratory delivery increases efficiency of oxygen therapy. Small delays in response time are critical in nasal delivery but not important in TTO. Pulsed TTO is more efficient than continuous flow TTO and merits long-term studies.\r"

Ten patients with clinically detectable paradoxic pulse of more than 20 mm Hg were studied. All had a history of reversible bronchial asthma with evidence of respiratory and circulatory failure. Standard therapy for asthma was started. We observed no difference in respiratory and heart rates during MAST inflation. Paradoxic pulse was consistently decreased during MAST inflation; paradoxic pulse returned to baseline values after MAST deflation. The decrease in paradoxic pulse was produced by an increased inspiratory systolic arterial pressure. We conclude that a reduction in pulmonary venous return is more important than ventricular interdependence in producing paradoxic pulse during severe asthma.\r"

Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy was present by 2-D and M-mode criteria in 145/333 (44 percent) patients. Normal limits of resting and post-Amyl continuous wave Doppler peak left ventricular outflow tract velocities were established in 15 subjects with completely normal 2-D and Doppler echocardiograms. Based on these criteria, of the 145 patients with HCM, 63 (43 percent) were classified as having resting LVOTO, peak velocity 4.2 +/- 1.3 m/s. Among 82 patients with HCM without resting LVOTO, 47 (57 percent) received Amyl. Latent LVOTO was provoked in 25/47 (53 percent), peak post-Amyl velocity 4.5 +/- 1.2 m/s. The remaining 22 (47 percent) had nonobstructive HCM, as indicated by no significant increase in post-Amyl velocity. Among a total 62 subjects receiving Amyl, none experienced serious morbidity or mortality. Doppler echocardiography, in conjunction with Amyl inhalation in selected patients, is a useful noninvasive method to diagnose and categorize patients with HCM according to the nature and severity of LVOTO.\r"

The incidence of CMV infection and of CMV disease in the globulin-treated CMV seronegative recipients of a heart from a seropositive donor was comparable to the incidence of CMV infection and of CMV disease in 31 nonglobulin-treated CMV seropositive recipients. This was significantly lower (percentage difference 69 percent, 95 percent CI 42-97 percent, p less than 0.001) than expected on the basis of the data from the literature and indicates that passive immunization with anti-CMV immunoglobulins induces the same protection against CMV disease as natural acquired anti-CMV resistance. This protective effect was temporary, as one patient developed symptomatic CMV infection four months after transplantation at a time when the anti-CMV immunoglobulin levels had decreased to pretransplantation values.\r"

The salient echocardiographic findings that were considered to be helpful in terms of differentiating these adherent pulmonary atelectatic lung segments were that the lung segments always occurred in the presence of a moderate to large left pleural effusion; in real-time examination, the atelectatic lung masses generally appeared solid, as opposed to cystic, with a characteristic brightly reflective ground-glass appearance; there was never any evidence of extrinsic compression of the heart by the lung mass.\r"

In a phonopneumographic study of 13 patients with fibrosing alveolitis, expiratory crackles were audible with the stethoscope in 12. Phonopneumographic analysis of these 12 patients showed the crackles to be fine with the initial wave deflection of the expiratory and inspiratory crackles in opposite directions. They were few in number, occurred predominantly in mid- and late expiration, and were not affected by varying the volume history or by breath holding maneuvers. These observations support the theory that some crackles are produced by vibration of the walls of peripheral airways. In addition, this group of patients showed a significant correlation between the number of expiratory crackles and the reduction in predicted transfer factor, suggesting that expiratory crackles may be a clinical indicator of the severity of disease in fibrosing alveolitis.\r"

It has long been associated with cardiac disease and has often been cited as a poor prognostic indicator, yet the incidence and immediate significance of CSR in the setting of acute cardiogenic PE is not well defined. Therefore, we studied 95 patients who required MVS because of PE. Breathing patterns were monitored by continuous respiratory inductive plethysmography for a minimum of 12 hours of spontaneous respiration after recovery from PE; CSR was noted in 42 patients (44 percent). There were no significant differences between patients with PE and CSR and those with only PE in regard to LVEF (mean +/- SD, 36 +/- 18 percent vs 33 +/- 16 percent; p = 0.55), reinstitution of MVS within 48 hours (4.8 percent vs 17.0 percent; p = 0.065), or in-hospital mortality (16.7 percent vs 26.4 percent; p = 0.255). We conclude that CSR is a relatively common breathing pattern in patients who required MVS because of cardiogenic PE and does not portend a poor immediate prognosis in this population.\r"

We acquired 341 measurements in 31 airways between 2.0 and 19.0 mm in diameter at airflow rates from 0 to 2.5 L/s in the inspiratory and expiratory directions. We found that in the expiratory direction, the sound amplitude was approximately linearly related to airway cross-sectional area, with the greatest amplitude occurring in the largest airway. In the inspiratory direction the greatest amplitude occurred in airways of 5 to 8 mm in diameter. At all levels within the model, sound amplitude was approximately linearly related to the square of the airflow. Our findings suggest that in canine airways, the predominant vesicular lung sound-producing locations are the large airways for the expiratory component and the medium-sized airways for the inspiratory component.\r"

The approach to ambulatory patients with minor bleeding was consistent with recently published guidelines: fiberoptic bronchoscopy has a central role, with a less apparent impact of other new technologies. Although specific diagnostic results were significantly more useful (p less than 0.01), even nonspecific bronchoscopy findings were though to have clinical value. External factors such as medicolegal concerns and obligations to provide service were acknowledged to influence selection of patients for bronchoscopy, and community-based clinicians cited such effects more often than academicians (p less than 0.02). Approaches to patients with massive hemoptysis reflected caution essential to acute management. Bronchoscopy was performed earlier (p less than 0.01) than in patients with minor bleeding, but opinions differed regarding instrument selection, the best method of airway support, and the roles of interventional angiography. This survey suggests that real-world settings are addressed incompletely by published experiences accumulated in tertiary centers. Clarification of optimum approaches to patients with hemoptysis requires further input from practicing clinicians.\r"

Bronchoalveolar lavage showed a lymphocytic alveolitis with an inverted lymphocyte subset ratio. After an 11-week period of drug withdrawal, clinical, radiologic and functional improvement was observed along with a normal alveolar lymphocytosis. Nilutamide therapy was then resumed for five weeks and induced the recurrence of clinical, functional and alveolar abnormalities. Nilutamide treatment was finally stopped and two months later, clinical and functional abnormalities resolved. This observation seems to exemplify the possible diagnostic value of coupling provocation test with BAL cell data in hypersensitivity pneumonitis induced by drugs.

The results of 125 such patients who also were asymptomatic, had no prior history of neoplasms, and had negative fecal occult blood, showed 15 patients (12 percent) with neoplasms. Only 6 (5.2 percent) had neoplasms that were detectable only by colonoscopy (i.e., above 55 cm). These results suggest that colonoscopy may not be necessary to screen patients with a primary history of colon cancer.\r"

The 20 patients with local control have normally functioning sphincters; 1 has developed distant metastatic disease. This combined approach was designed to expand the curative role of local resection in carcinoma of the rectum. The surgical techniques are thoroughly described and the potential role and indications of this approach are discussed.\r"

  ".U": "90126101\r", 
  ".W": "Local recurrence is the most serious complication of anterior resection for rectal cancer, usually occurring during the first two years after surgery. Over a five-year period, from 1981 to 1986, 183 patients underwent anterior resection for rectal carcinoma at the Surgery Ward of the University of Ferrara. Patients were followed for two years postoperatively. All operations were performed with staplers and classified according to Dukes, with 43 cases of Dukes' A; 83 cases of Dukes' B; and 57 cases of Dukes' C. In the first 24 months after surgery, the tumor recurred locally in 44 of the 183 patients (24 percent). Dukes' stage, grading distal resection margin, and histopathologic differentiation of the distal rectal ring left in the stapler after anastomosis were assessed to determine a prognostic indicator for the recurrence of the tumor. The stage:recurrence ratio was as follows: A, 1 (2 percent); B, 21 (25 percent); and C, 22 (39 percent). The grading:recurrence ratio was: G1, 13:51 (25 percent); G2, 24:110 (22 percent); and G3, 7:22 (32 percent). The ratio between distal rectal resection margin and recurrence was: 0 to 2 cm, 15:27 (56 percent); 2 to 4 cm, 16:74 (22 percent); and over 4 cm, 13:82 (15 percent). Histopathologic examination of the distal rectal ring was negative for all patients. These data confirm the direct relationship between class and local recurrence and indicate histologic grade and distal resection margin as significant prognostic parameters only when interpreted in the light of staging.\r"

Samples were taken from blood during 28 days of storage following donation, and mitogenic activity measured. The mitogenic activity increased with storage time, the principal changes occurring from the end of the second week. The increased mitogenic activity in patients following transfusion and in stored blood may be a factor in the mediation of the deleterious effect of transfusion on recurrence in colorectal cancer and perhaps \"fresh\" blood, if required, should be used.\r"

A large number of these emergencies involve the lower gastrointestinal tract. The purpose of this study is to bring attention to the occult nature of colorectal disease in spinal cord patients and to highlight the subtle, but characteristic, symptoms and signs that develop in these patients. The authors identified 13 spinal cord patients in whom a lesion developed in either the appendix, colon, rectum, or anus. The average age of all patients was 36.2 years. Trauma and multiple sclerosis were the most common etiology of spinal cord injury. The most common presenting symptoms were abdominal distention, vomiting, and constipation. The average delay in diagnosis of the colorectal disease was 35.8 hours. An 84% morbidity and 22% mortality were observed. This study indicates that any deviation from the normal lifestyle of the spinal cord patient should alert one to the possibility of visceral inflammation. Furthermore, close attention to the signs of autonomic dysreflexia or changes in spasticity, along with a thorough evaluation of the ill-appearing spinal cord patient, may uncover occult colonic or rectal disease.\r"

Diverting colostomy was performed in all patients. Two of the four patients were treated by wide local excision of the tumors for palliation. Two patients were treated with chemotherapy and radiation therapy. Three of the four patients died within 12 months. The authors conclude that diverting colostomy and wide local excision of giant anal cancers offer effective palliation of local wound problems in selected cases.\r"

These results were compared with results from 73 people with nonmalignant gastrointestinal disease, and with results from 96 normal controls. All malignancies were staged according to the Astler-Coller modification of Dukes' classification for colorectal cancer. All blood samples were drawn before surgical therapy. The TSA/TP ratio for colorectal cancer was 13.4 (mg/gm) in contrast to 12.1 (mg/gm) for pathologic controls, and 9.7 (mg/gm) for normal controls. Student's t test showed a P value less than 0.001 for normal controls and a P value less than 0.001 for pathologic controls. The TSA/TP also showed statistical significance in Dukes A, B2, C, and D subgroups when compared with normal controls. There were only four patients with stage C1 carcinoma, thus statistical analysis would be questionable. In contrast, carcinoembryonic antigen levels showed no significant elevations until Dukes C2 tumors were encountered. These preliminary findings suggest that TSA/TP ratio may detect colorectal cancer patients with less tumor burden and be more beneficial as a tumor marker than CEA for monitoring patients with colorectal cancer.\r"

The purpose of this research was to determine the effect of germanium on 1,2-dimethylhydrazine-induced intestinal cancer in rats. Ninety-six 8-week-old Sprague-Dawley male rats were divided into 4 groups, with 24 rats in each group. All received dimethylhydrazine, 20 mg/kg body weight, subcutaneously, once a week for 20 weeks. Except for one control group, the other three groups were subdivided into six groups and administered three different kinds of germanium (inorganic germanium, organic germanium, and natural organic germanium) one month before and during dimethylhydrazine treatment, and during dimethylhydrazine treatment, respectively. Twenty-four weeks after carcinogen exposure, all surviving animals were sacrificed and examined for intestinal tumors. The number and location of the tumors were recorded and the pathology examined. The incidence of intestinal cancer in the control group (dimethylhydrazine only) was 91 percent; in groups provided with inorganic germanium one month before and during dimethylhydrazine treatment, and during dimethylhydrazine treatment only, it was 91 and 78 percent; in groups provided with organic germanium one month before and during dimethylhydrazine treatment, and during dimethylhydrazine treatment only, it was 64 and 64 percent; in groups provided with natural organic germanium one month before and during dimethylhydrazine treatment and during dimethylhydrazine treatment only, it was 50 and 45 percent. From these results, the authors conclude that natural organic germanium has the best prevention effect for intestinal cancer in this animal model (P less than 0.01), followed by organic germanium (P less than 0.05). Inorganic germanium has no effect. However, there is no difference in the cancer prevention effect of germanium provided one month before and during dimethylhydrazine treatment, and during dimethylhydrazine treatment only.\r"

Emotional well-being was reassessed at the end of the program, and the entire protocol was completed again at 6 mo (n=124). At the program's end, participants improved on all measures of emotional well-being (P less than .01). Self-esteem and diabetes self-efficacy rose, whereas anxiety and depression fell. At 6 mo, improvement in emotional well-being continued, and important self-care behaviors improved from preprogram levels. Self-monitoring of blood glucose and exercise rose (both P less than .001), and bringing (P less than .01) and glycosylated hemoglobin levels (P less than .001) fell. Program effects were unrelated to demographic or disease characteristics but strongly related to initial status. Participants who entered the program with high levels of emotional well-being or good self-care patterns or glycemic control tended to change little, if at all, at later measurements. On the other hand, people who entered the program with low levels of emotional well-being or with poor self-care patterns or glycemic control improved substantially. Our findings suggest that diabetes education can promote long-term benefits in self-care, metabolic control, and emotional status if the program is specifically designed to provide these benefits. Aspects of the program that contribute to its efficacy are discussed.\r"

Life-table analyses by total and postpubertal IDDM duration were used to evaluate differences in the prevalence of microvascular complications and diabetes-related mortality in subjects diagnosed before and during puberty, as defined by an age at IDDM onset marker of 11 yr for girls and 12 yr for boys. The prevalence of retinopathy and overt nephropathy in 552 White adult diabetic subjects (population 1, mean IDDM duration 20.8 yr was significantly greater in subjects diagnosed during puberty compared with those diagnosed before puberty. However, similar analyses by postpubertal duration showed no difference in microvascular complication prevalence between the two groups. These findings did not appear to be due to a confounding effect of age. Additional analyses of 239 adolescent diabetic subjects (population 2, mean duration 8.3 yr) revealed the same trend for the prevalence of retinopathy. Finally, results concerning the risk of diabetes-related mortality in a cohort of 1582 subjects (population 3, mean duration 12.9 yr) indicated that postpubertal duration of IDDM may be a more accurate determinant of the development of microvascular complications and diabetes-related mortality than total duration, and it is suggested that the contribution of the prepubertal years of diabetes to long-term prognosis may be minimal.\r"

  ".W": "The relationship between glycemic control and complications of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) remains controversial. With the use of glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1) to assess glycemic control from diagnosis onward, the Pittsburgh Prospective Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus Cohort Study prospectively evaluated 80 new cases of IDDM diagnosed at Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh. This study presents findings in 62 patients at 5 yr postdiagnosis. Only 7 patients, all girls, had any retinopathy (microaneurysms). These subjects had an elevated 5-yr mean HbA1 compared to those with no retinopathy (13.0 vs. 11.7%; P less than .05). Six female subjects who had an elevated albumin excretion rate (AER; greater than or equal to 20 micrograms/min) had a higher 5-yr mean HbA1 (13.3%) than the 26 subjects with AER less than 20 micrograms/min (11.8%; P less than .05). Current HbA1 was correlated with AER (r = +.36, P less than .05) and systolic blood pressure (r = +.49, P less than .01) in females. However, these associations were not observed in males. Positive correlations were found between HbA1 (5-yr mean and current) and serum triglyceride and cholesterol, but only in females was HbA1 inversely related to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. However, HbA1 was independent of sex, HLA-DR type, and urine C-peptide status. Age adjustment did not change the above results. These analyses suggest that glycemic control is related to AER, systolic blood pressure, presence of microaneurysms, and serum triglyceride and cholesterol concentrations during the first 5 yr of IDDM. However, these associations appear to be predominant in girls.\r"

Hispanics in Colorado are a racial mixture of American Indian and White populations. Because American Indians have a low risk of IDDM, and differing frequencies of HLA antigens and haplotypes are reported for Hispanics and non-Hispanics, we compared incidence rates and disease characteristics. Eligible participants were less than 18 yr of age and Colorado residents at time of diagnosis, diagnosed between 1 January 1978 and 31 December 1983, and on insulin within 2 wk of diagnosis. Subjects were reported by their physicians, and statewide validation of reporting was conducted through review of hospital discharge indexes. Incidence rates for Hispanics (n = 76) were significantly lower than those for non-Hispanics (n = 628), although 95% confidence intervals overlapped for children aged 10-17 yr. Age-adjusted rates were significantly lower in Hispanic than non-Hispanic males, whereas age-adjusted rates for females did not differ. The cumulative risk of IDDM was less for Hispanic males aged 0-17 yr than for non-Hispanic males (P less than .001); cumulative risk among females was males (P less than .001); cumulative risk among females was not different (P = .10). Clinical onset characteristics and medical care at diagnosis were similar. After diagnosis, hospitalizations per 100 person-yr appeared higher in Hispanics, but ketoacidosis and insulin reactions per 100 person-yr were similar. Difference in rate of hospitalizations may have been due to lower response rates among older non-Hispanics.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

With the use of billing records to identify a large sample of diabetic patients, a chart review of 544 patients was conducted. During the study year, the mean +/- SE number of visits to primary-care clinics was 5.7 +/- 0.22, with 86.4% having at least one visit. Most diabetic patients were seen by primary-care physicians; only 9% received care in a specialized diabetes clinic. Despite frequent primary-care visits, most diabetic patients in this county health-care system did not have documentation of care to detect complications of diabetes mellitus, and referral services for detection and treatment of these complications were infrequently used. Moreover, among patients seen on greater than or equal to 10 occasions in a primary-care setting, preventive care was not provided to 30% of the patients. Preventive care does not appear to be a regular part of a primary-care visit for most of the diabetic patients in this study.\r"

Measures of verbal learning, abstract reasoning, and complex psychomotor functioning were performed more poorly by diabetic than nondiabetic subjects. Conversely, there were no between-group differences in performance on tasks involving pure motor speed and simple verbal abilities. Within the diabetic group, individuals with poorer metabolic control performed more poorly on tasks involving learning, reasoning, and complex psychomotor performance, although this relationship was not evident for simple verbal or motor tasks. These data indicate that older people with NIDDM who are functioning well and perceive themselves as in good health are likely to manifest greater deficits than healthy elderly people in processing complex verbal or nonverbal material. Possible explanatory mechanisms are discussed, and directions for future research are explored.\r"

None of the patients had evidence of ischemic heart disease, kidney disease, or the idiopathic long Q-T-interval syndrome. The corrected Q-T interval (Q-Tc) was determined at rest with Bazett's formula. As a group, diabetic patients with greater than or equal to 2 abnormalities of cardiac autonomic function had a longer Q-Tc interval than those with no evidence of CAN. Diabetic patients with greater than or equal to 1 abnormality had a prolonged Q-Tc interval compared with a control group of 96 healthy nondiabetic subjects (mean +/- SD 397 +/- 18). The frequency of prolonged (greater than 433 ms, normal mean + 2SD) resting Q-Tc intervals increased with the increasing number of abnormalities (0, 1, 2, greater than or equal to 3): 11, 25, 41, and 75%, respectively. Twenty-three of 25 (92%) patients with a Q-Tc greater than 433 ms had evidence of CAN. However, 57% (31 of 54) of the patients with CAN had a normal Q-Tc interval.

  ".U": "90126542\r", 
  ".W": "In bovine adrenal glomerulosa cells, angiotensin-II (AII) induced a biphasic increase in 1,2-sn-diacylglycerol (DAG), with an initial peak at 10 sec followed by a transient decrease at 30 sec. The second increase was much higher in magnitude than the first peak and reached its maximum after 1 h of stimulation. Such kinetics of DAG formation resemble those with which AII stimulates the formation of inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate. The protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide, which prevents hormone-induced de novo phospholipid synthesis in adrenal fasciculata cells, had no effect on the DAG response to Aii. The first phase of signal generation of both inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate and DAG was not affected by incubation in calcium-deficient extracellular medium. However, the second phase of the inositol phosphate response was almost completely inhibited in low calcium medium, while the DAG response was reduced by only one third. Pertussis toxin (150 ng/ml) and the voltage-sensitive calcium channel inhibitors, nifedipine (1 microM) and Ni2+ (100 microM), had no effect on the DAG response to AII. The retention of a substantial DAG response to AII in low calcium medium, with concomitant diminution of the inositol phosphate response, indicates that a major part of the DAG formed during the sustained phase of hormonal stimulation is derived from sources other than phosphoinositides. The DAGs produced from different phospholipids could have distinctive fatty acid compositions and membrane localizations, which, in turn, could result in the differential activation of protein kinase-C. In this way, the increased complexity of the hormonally induced signalling pathway could allow for a greater diversity of responses in hormone-stimulated target cells.\r"

In the present study, we purified PRF in porcine posterior pituitary extracts to chemically determine the primary structure. PRF activity was assessed during purification by the release of immunoreactive PRL from superfused rat pituitary cells. Two hundred seventy porcine posterior pituitaries were boiled, homogenized, and extracted with 2 M acetic acid. The acid extract was precipitated with 67% acetone, and the supernatant was absorbed onto a C18 column. The column was eluted step-wise with 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, and 60% acetonitrile (CH3CN) in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA). The greatest PRF activity was recovered in the 30% CH3CN/0.1% TFA fraction and was further purified by ion-exchange chromatography on SP-Sephadex, followed by gel-filtration on Sephadex G-50. The Sephadex G-50 fractions with major PRF activity were finally purified by two cycles of reverse phase HPLC, yielding a single peak of PRF. Amino acid, as well as sequence analyses, indicated that the highly purified PRF was oxytocin. Authentic oxytocin showed the same chromatographic behavior and biological activity as those of the isolated peptide. In another experiment, desalted crude extracts of rat and porcine posterior pituitary tissues were directly chromatographed by reverse phase HPLC, and each fraction was assayed for PRF activity. Only two areas showed PRF activity; the largest activity coeluted with oxytocin and the smaller one co-eluted with vasopressin. The fractions which coeluted with oxytocin also showed oxytocin immunoreactivity, as examined by RIA. The results clearly indicated that the major PRF in these posterior pituitary extracts was oxytocin.\r"

  ".W": "Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF beta) is a family of 25-kDa peptides that appear to be important regulators of cell proliferation, differentiation, and differentiated function in many tissues. TGF beta is present in platelets and serum and is released by cultured cells as several distinct large mol wt complexes of TGF beta with other proteins. These complexes are biologically inactive and are generically called latent TGF beta (L-TGF beta). Large quantities of TGF beta are present in bone matrix. This study was undertaken to determine whether the TGF beta in bone matrix was present as a free 25-kDa peptide or a large mol wt L-TGF beta complex. TGF beta activity was determined by inhibition of [3H]methylthymidine incorporation in mink lung epithelial cells. The specificity of inhibition was determined by treating fractions with a polyclonal rabbit antiporcine TGF beta-blocking antibody before assay. Latency was examined by assaying untreated and acid-treated fractions for TGF beta activity. Acid treatment of EDTA extracts of the bovine bone matrix proteins increased TGF beta activity from a mean of 0.8 pg/microgram protein to 56 pg/micrograms. Under native conditions L-TGF beta eluted from S400 between the 600-400 kDa mol wt standards. No activity eluted in the fractions with authentic 25-kDa TGF beta. Eighty-five percent of the L-TGF beta bound to lentil lectin, and this separated into four discrete L-TGF beta peaks (I-IV) at 0.22, 0.25, 0.35, and 0.42 M NaCl with Mono-Q anion exchange chromatography. Mono-Q pools II and III were reseparated by molecular size on Superose-12 under native and dissociative conditions. Under native conditions TGF beta activity was latent and eluted in the large mol wt fractions. No 25-kDa TGF beta was present. With dissociating conditions (4 M GuHCl) all TGF beta activity eluted in the small mol wt fractions identical to the elution position of authentic 25-kDa TGF beta. The active fractions from the dissociative separation of Mono-Q pool III were separated by C4 reverse phase HPLC. There were three discrete peaks of TGF beta activity corresponding to TGF beta 1, TGF beta 2, and an unidentified form of TGF. Maximum activation of L-TGF beta in each Mono-Q peak occurred at pH 3-3.5. There was partial activation at pH 4.5, but no additional activation at pH 1.5.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

In the present study performed in male rats, exogenous administration of 36 ng 1,25-(OH)2D3/day for 7 days increased plasma 1,25-(OH)2D concentrations 5-fold above those in control rats (to 261 +/- 17 pg/ml). Compared with those in control rats, 1,25-(OH)2D3 treatment resulted in a 1.5-fold increase in duodenal vitamin D receptor content (351 +/- 16 vs. 520 +/- 21 fmol/mg protein) and a 3-fold increase in renal vitamin D receptor content (60.3 +/- 5.2 vs. 193.8 +/- 22.7 fmol/mg protein). The effects of endogenously produced 1,25-(OH)2D on tissue vitamin D receptor content were studied by feeding rats either a 0.02% or 1% calcium diet for 2, 7, 14, or 21 days. Rats fed the low calcium diet exhibited plasma 1,25-(OH)2D concentrations similar to (day 7) or exceeding (days 14 and 21) those achieved by exogenous administration of 1,25-(OH)2D3, yet duodenal vitamin D receptor content was not up-regulated by dietary calcium restriction at any time point. The renal vitamin D receptor content of calcium restricted rats was 20-38% lower (P less than 0.05) than that in rats fed a calcium-replete diet 7, 14, and 21 days after initiation of the dietary treatments. These data suggest that under physiological conditions, increased plasma concentrations of 1,25-(OH)2D do not result in up-regulation of tissue vitamin D receptor concentrations, and that dietary calcium restriction must induce some factor(s) that results in down-regulation of vitamin D receptors in the kidney.\r"

Employing dispersed adult male rat hypothalamic cells, we studied the effects of beta-adrenergic antagonists on the release of hypothalamic SRIF. Propranolol, at concentrations of 1-100 microM, had no detectable effect on basal SRIF release, but caused dose-dependent inhibition of SRIF release stimulated by ouabain. Two other beta-adrenergic antagonists, labetolol and metoprolol, also caused inhibition of ouabain-stimulated SRIF release. The alpha 2-agonist clonidine was without effect on SRIF release under basal or stimulated conditions. GH secretion from monolayers of dispersed rat anterior pituitary cells was also examined. Propranolol (1-100 microM) had no significant effect on basal GH secretion or GH secretion stimulated by rat GRF. In conclusion, 1) beta-adrenergic antagonists caused inhibition of stimulated SRIF release; 2) clonidine had no detectable effect on SRIF release; and 3) propranolol did not affect GH secretion in vitro. These findings support the hypothesis that beta-adrenergic antagonists augment GH responsivity by inhibiting hypothalamic SRIF release.\r"

The dissociation constant (Kd) of the intestinal receptor, however, remained very similar at both ages (young, 0.24 nM; adult, 0.53 nM). A similar age-related decline in unoccupied intestinal receptor was also observed in Fischer 344 rats and cows. Infusion of young and adult Holtzman rats with about 72 ng/kg BW 1,25-(OH)2D3 resulted in similar changes in the concentrations of plasma 1,25-(OH)2D3 (150-160 pg/ml) in both age groups. The 1,25-(OH)2D3 infusions also resulted in significant up-regulation of unoccupied intestinal receptor (femtomoles per mg protein) from 512 +/- 27 to 780 +/- 61 in the young rats and 68 +/- 9.4 to 194 +/- 15 in the adult rats. Receptor up-regulation by 1,25-(OH)2D3 (change from control) was significantly higher (P less than 0.05) in young rats (268 +/- 51 fmol/mg protein) than in adults (125 +/- 8.2 fmol/mg protein). These data suggest that the differences in receptor number in young and adult rats may be responsible for functional changes in target tissue response to 1,25-(OH)2D3 associated with advancing age.\r"

Cultures were treated with PTH, forskolin, isobutylmethylxanthine (IBMX), and 8-bromo-cAMP (8BrcAMP). We found that similar concentrations of PTH stimulate cAMP formation and increase PG production in this culture system. Forskolin, a direct activator of adenylate cyclase, was also a potent stimulator of cAMP and PG production. The effect was dose dependent, with a maximum at 10(-5) M. The time courses for PTH- and forskolin-stimulated PG production were similar, and there was a close and similar correlation between cAMP production at 15 min and PGE2 production at 6 h for both agents. An increase in PG production was also observed when IBMX, which elevates cAMP levels in cells by inhibiting cAMP phosphodiesterase, or the cAMP analog 8BrcAMP was added to the cultures. In addition, IBMX enhanced the PGE2 responses to PTH, forskolin, and 8BrcAMP. These findings indicate that stimulation of PG production by PTH may be mediated by cAMP.\r"

  ".U": "90126554\r", 
  ".W": "Although most studies show that prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) is the most potent and effective of the prostanoids in bone, recent data in cell culture suggest that PGF2 alpha may have unique effects, particularly on cell replication. The present study was undertaken to compare the effects of PGF2 alpha and PGE2 in cultured neonatal mouse parietal bones by simultaneous measurement of bone resorption as release of previously incorporated 45Ca, bone formation as incorporation of [3H]proline into collagenase-digestible (CDP) and noncollagen protein, and DNA synthesis as incorporation of [3H]thymidine. PGF2 alpha was less effective than PGE2 as a stimulator of bone resorption, and its effects were partially inhibited by indomethacin and markedly inhibited by glucocorticoids. In contrast, the resorptive response to PGE2 was unaffected by indomethacin and only partially inhibited by cortisol. PGF2 alpha had little effect on bone formation, in contrast to the biphasic effect of PGE2, which inhibited labeling of CDP in the absence of cortisol and stimulated CDP labeling in the presence of cortisol. PGF2 alpha increased thymidine incorporation into DNA, but the effect was smaller than that of PGE2 and was inhibited by indomethacin. These observations suggested that PGF2 alpha might act in part by stimulating PGE2 production. By RIA, PGE2 concentrations were increased in the medium of bones treated with PGF2 alpha, and this increase was blocked by indomethacin. By HPLC, bones prelabeled with [3H]arachidonic acid showed an increase in labeled PGE2 release, and RIA showed an increase in PGE2 after PGF2 alpha treatment. These results indicate that PGF2 alpha is a relatively weak agonist in bone compared to PGE2 and that some of the effects of PGF2 alpha on bone resorption, formation, and cell replication may be mediated by an increase in endogenous PGE2 production.\r"

  ".W": "The presence of estrogen receptor cells in postnatal cerebral cortex and their topographical and numerical changes between birth and postweaning were examined. On postnatal days 0, 2, 8, 12, 18, and 25, six mice (three males and three females) were injected sc with 0.25 microgram/100 g BW 11 beta-methoxy-16 alpha-[125I]iodoestradiol [( 125I]MIE2). Two additional males on postnatal day 2 were each sc injected with 250 micrograms/100 g BW 17 beta-estradiol 1 h before radiolabeled ligand to establish the specificity of nuclear label. Two hours after the injection of [125I]MIE2 brains were frozen, and 4-microns sections were thaw-mounted and processed for autoradiography. Autoradiograms were exposed for 1-45 days, and cortical cells with nuclear uptake and retention of [125I]MIE2 were evaluated at the levels of the frontal pole, preoptic area, and central and posterior hypothalamus. At birth, cells with nuclear label were found predominantly in deep cortical layers. Between birth and postnatal day 2, the number of labeled cells increased in deep and intermediate laminae and first appeared in certain superficial regions. By day 8, labeled cells were concentrated in laminae II-VI of the cingulate/paracingulate and suprarhinal cortex. On day 12, labeling in laminae V and VI declined to a few cells, while a concentration of labeled cells remained in laminae II and III of the cingulate/paracingulate and suprarhinal regions. With subsequent development, an attenuation in labeling at all cortical levels was observed. By day 25, a small cluster of labeled cells remained in lamina II and III of the anterior cingulate, paracingulate, and suprarhinal regions, with additional labeled cells scattered throughout the remaining cortex. Competition with unlabeled 17 beta-estradiol reduced nuclear concentration of ligand in all cortical layers and demonstrated the specificity of [125I]MIE2 for the estrogen receptor. These results show the extensive presence of estrogen target cells in the early postnatal cortex and a profound change in topography and number of target cells during the postnatal period. These findings further suggest an important role for estrogen in the development of certain cortical neurons, possibly involving neuronal differentiation, cell positioning, and connectivity.\r"

  ".W": "The gastrointestinal tract of the pig undergoes enhanced growth as well as morphological and functional differentiation during the perinatal period. Concurrently, porcine neonates ingest physiologically significant amounts of insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) via colostrum and milk. The objectives of this study were to examine newborn pig small intestine for the presence of high affinity, IGF-I receptors and to evaluate the possible contributions of maternally derived and locally produced IGF-I to receptor-mediated postnatal growth of intestine. The specific binding of 125I-IGF-I to membranes prepared from scraped intestinal mucosa was time, temperature, and pH dependent; optimal conditions were 48 h, 4 C, and a pH of 7.8, respectively. Several pure peptides were evaluated for competition with 125I-IGF-I in binding to intestinal membrane sites. The relative order of competition was IGF-I greater than insulin-like growth factor-II (IGF-II) greater than insulin, whereas bombesin and epidermal growth factor were noncompetitive. Chemical cross-linking of 125I-IGF-I to binding sites, followed by denaturing SDS-PAGE and autoradiography, demonstrated labeled protein complexes of Mrs 135,000 and 260,000. Both autoradiographic bands were diminished when excess unlabeled IGF-I or IGF-II was included in the binding step. Insulin at higher concentrations also slightly inhibited labeling of both membrane proteins. Membranes prepared from intestinal mucosa of piglets at days 0 (less than 2-h old, colostrum-deprived), 3, 5, and 21 postnatal were evaluated for developmental variations in specific binding of 125I-IGF-I. Binding was highest at birth, declined (-43%) by day 3, remained low at day 5, and increased by day 21. Receptor affinity was relatively invariant whereas receptor number (per mg membrane protein) was variable. Intestine wt increased disproportionately to body wt between days 0 to 3, postnatal. Radioimmunoassay of extracts of the corresponding intestinal mucosa revealed a significant increase in content of IGF-I by day 3 (P = 0.05), whereas RNA dot-blot hybridization demonstrated low and unchanging IGF-I mRNA abundance in intestine. The quantitative variations in IGF-I protein content and IGF receptor numbers temporally coincide with intestinal villous growth, cessation of intestinal transport of macromolecules (closure), and onset of maturation of intestinal function.\r"

However, while E will increase PRL secretion in monkey pituitary cell cultures, P has no effect. We recently localized progestin receptors (PR) to gonadotropes, but not lactotropes, with an immunocytochemical technique to double stain monkey pituitary cell cultures. The following studies were performed to confirm the immunocytochemical localization of PR in intact pituitary tissue and to determine the effect of E and P on the levels of estrogen receptors (ER) and PR in the pituitary. ER and PR levels were determined in the endometrium of the same animals for an internal comparison. Thirteen adult cycling female cynomolgus monkeys were ovariectomized and treated for 28 days with 1) an empty Silastic capsule (Spay), 2) a 2-cm E-filled capsule (E), or 3) a 2-cm E-filled capsule for 14 days plus a 6-cm P-filled capsule implanted for an additional 14 days (E + P). Blood samples were drawn daily for assay of serum E, P, and PRL levels. Serum PRL was not significantly affected by E, but the sequential addition of P significantly increased serum PRL levels over those observed in Spray animals. The anterior pituitary and endometrium were removed for measurement of ER and PR levels by a sucrose gradient shift assay incorporating monoclonal antibodies against ER and PR. Pituitary ER levels did not vary significantly with steroid treatment (158.2 +/- 33.6, 135.5 +/- 24.9, 104.3 +/- 13.4 fmol/mg DNA in Spay, E, and E + P animals, respectively). Pituitary PR levels were undetectable in Spay animals, were induced by E (393.3 +/- 53.4 fmol/mg DNA), and were suppressed to undetectable levels by the addition of P. A portion of the pituitary was frozen for immunocytochemical single staining for ER, PR, PRL, and LH and double staining for PRL + PR and LH + PR. ER staining was observed in many parenchymal cells, but there was no apparent change with steroid treatment. PR staining was absent in the Spay animals; many PR-positive cells were observed in E-treated females, and only a small number of faintly staining cells were detected in the E + P animals. Double staining for PRL + PR and LH + PR revealed PR in gonadotropes, but not lactotropes. In conclusion, PR, but not ER, are regulated by E and P in the monkey pituitary. Importantly, PR is regulated within gonadotropes, but not lactotropes. Therefore, P probably increases PRL secretion through a hypothalamic action.\r"

Specific immunostaining for oxytocin, but not neurophysin, was observed in the ductuli efferentes as well as caput epididymidis. This indicates the presence, but not production, of oxytocin in epithelial cells of these ducts. Staining was predominantly present in the epithelium, especially in the middle lobules of the ductuli efferentes and initial segment of the epididymis. Endocytosis of oxytocin was studied by electron microscopy after intraluminal microinjections of oxytocin conjugated to colloidal gold (8-10 nm), a 20-fold excess of oxytocin followed by oxytocin-gold, or plain colloidal gold into the ductuli efferentes and four successive regions of the caput epididymidis. Specific uptake by a receptor-mediated process was evidenced by the presence of more gold particles within epithelial cells after oxytocin-gold injections than after control injections. The quantity of oxytocin-gold endocytosed was 3.7-fold greater in the ductuli efferentes than in the initial segment of the epididymis. Within the caput epididymidis, more oxytocin-gold was endocytosed in the initial segment and proximal caput epididymidis than in two distal regions. We conclude that localization of oxytocin in epithelia of the excurrent ducts is a consequence of endocytosis (predominantly receptor mediated) of luminal oxytocin entering in rete testis fluid; however, uptake of blood-borne oxytocin cannot be excluded. Although oxytocin may have a role in sperm transport via action on smooth muscle in the ductal wall, the regional pattern of endocytosis of oxytocin is suggestive of a role for oxytocin in epithelial function in the ductuli efferentes and proximal portions of the caput epididymidis.\r"

  ".U": "90126564\r", 
  ".W": "Testosterone and dihydrotestosterone are believed to exert their androgenic effects by interacting with a single intracellular receptor protein in androgen target tissues. During fetal life, however, testosterone mediates the virilization of the Wolffian ducts into the epididymis, vas deferens, and seminal vesicles, whereas the urogenital sinus and external genitalia require the in situ conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone to undergo male development. The reason why the signal provided by testosterone needs to be amplified in some androgen target tissues but not in others remains an enigma. To provide insight into the different actions of these androgens we studied their interaction with the human androgen receptor in fibroblasts cultured from the genital skin of a patient with 5 alpha-reductase deficiency. Dihydrotestosterone was formed in negligible amounts in these cells, and in some experiments the residual 5 alpha-reductase activity was further blocked with the 5 alpha-reductase inhibitor finasteride. Saturation analysis in fibroblast monolayers disclosed similar amounts of binding with testosterone and dihydrotestosterone, and the affinity of binding of dihydrotestosterone was, on the average, about 2-fold greater than that of testosterone. [3H]Testosterone also exhibited a 5-fold faster dissociation rate from the receptor than [3H]dihydrotestosterone. In thermolability experiments the [3H]testosterone-receptor complex displayed marked instability at 42 C with 2 nM [3H] testosterone, whereas with 20 nM [3H]testosterone, receptor stability was similar to that seen with [3H]dihydrotestosterone. In up-regulation experiments, 2 nM [3H]testosterone produced a 34% increase in specific androgen receptor binding after 24 h, whereas 20 nM [3H]testosterone produced an average increase of 64%. Our results suggest that the weaker androgenic potency of testosterone compared to that of dihydrotestosterone resides in its weaker interaction with the androgen receptor, most clearly demonstrable as an increase in the dissociation rate of testosterone from the receptor. When present in relatively high concentrations, however, testosterone overcomes this defect by mass action.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

The phenotypes of the resulting progeny cells were compared by examining the ultrastructure, immunohistochemical staining for luminal epithelial and myoepithelial cells and casein, and assessing the quantity of biochemically detectable alpha- and beta-casein. Although there are some differences in ultrastructure and immunostaining in the progeny cell populations induced by different growth-promoting agents, all the cultures were able to accumulate alpha- and beta-casein on subsequent stimulation by PRL and linoleic acid in the second phase of culture. Since, in vivo, luminal epithelial cells of the mammary gland are the only cell type capable of synthesizing milk products, these results indicate that all the different growth stimulants, hormonal and nonhormonal, result in the predominant proliferation of luminal-type epithelial cells. These results have important implications for studies of the mechanism of growth control in and transformation of mammary epithelial cells.\r"

PTH-RP was purified to homogeneity from human and bovine milk using heat and acid to precipitate milk proteins followed by ion exchange chromatography and reverse-phase HPLC. The peak of PTH-RP from HPLC was detected using a sensitive bone cell bioassay. A single band of peptide was detected on silver-stained polyacrylamide gels, which migrated as a 20-21-kDa macromolecule. PTH-RP isolated from either human or bovine milk had similar electrophoretic mobilities on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The partially purified bovine PTH-RP stimulated cAMP production in UMR106-01 and OK cell lines and elicited a concentration-dependent inhibition of sodium-dependent phosphate transport in OK cells. Incubation of milk extracts with an anti-PTH antiserum did not affect their bioactivity, whereas an antihuman PTH-RP 1-34 antiserum markedly reduced the cAMP response of UMR106-01 cells to the immunoabsorbed milk extracts. A PTH antagonist, norleu PTH 3-34, blocked the stimulation of cAMP production in UMR106-01 cells treated with milk extracts. PTH-RP immunoreactivity and bioactivity occurred in milk extracts of diverse animals from both eutherian and metatherian (marsupial) species. Porcine colostrum also had immunoreactive PTH-RP, although the levels were lower than the immunoreactive PTH-RP concentrations observed in milk samples collected at 7 and 14 days of lactation. Thus, a 20-21-KDa PTH-RP is secreted into milk where it could play a role in the development of suckling, newborn animals.\r"

  ".W": "The hormone responsiveness of the adenylyl cyclase of pig ovarian follicles or corpora lutea was examined. Adenylyl cyclase activity was assayed in 10,000 x g membrane fractions that had been prepared with or without (control) a urea extraction. In control luteal membranes there was little stimulation (less than 2-fold) or adenylyl cyclase by saturating ovine (o) LH, hCG, or (-)isoproterenol in the absence or presence of 10 microM GTP. However, in urea-treated luteal membranes, a 2- to 3-fold stimulation of adenylyl cyclase was caused by saturating oLH or hCG, and a 4- to 5-fold stimulation by (-)isoproterenol; the marked stimulation by the gonadotropins was only observed if 10 microM GTP was added. In follicular membranes, a 3- to 4-fold stimulation of adenylyl cyclase by gonadotropins was observed regardless of whether GTP was added or the membranes had been urea extracted. Stimulation of adenylyl cyclase by (-)isoproterenol was always less than 2-fold in follicular membranes. The binding affinity for [125I]hCG was similar in control follicular and luteal membranes, but there were approximately 10-fold more [125I]hCG-binding sites in follicular compared with luteal membranes. The binding affinities and number of receptor sites were not significantly changed by urea treatment. The ED50 values for hCG or (-)isoproterenol were the same in follicular and luteal membranes and were uneffected by the addition of 10 microM GTP, but the ED50 for oLH was 3-fold lower in follicular than in luteal membranes. GTP caused a dose-dependent increase in adenylyl cyclase activity in luteal and follicular membranes, and both tissues had the same ED50. A saturating hormone concentration resulted in an approximately 2-fold decrease in the ED50 for GTP. In vitro hCG-induced desensitization of the hCG-responsive adenylyl cyclase was 31% in follicular membranes, but only 11-15% in luteal membranes. Hormone-induced desensitization was not increased in incubations of luteal homogenate or membranes plus cytosol. These results establish the existence of a LH/hCG-sensitive adenylyl cyclase in the pig corpus luteum and indicate that the G-protein and catalytic moieties of the follicular and luteal adenylyl cyclase complex are functionally the same, but some difference exists in the way the LH/hCG-receptor in the two tissues interacts with the G-protein/catalytic complex.\r"

  ".W": "PRL secretion in several physiological and experimental conditions, including early pregnancy, is linked to the daily photoperiod. The aim of this study was to examine the antepartum increase in PRL secretion for evidence of a circadian pattern of release, as seen during early pregnancy. During the last 3 days of pregnancy blood samples were taken six times daily by means of previously implanted jugular cannulae. Plasma PRL concentrations were then measured by RIA. PRL levels were less than 10 ng/ml in all animals on day 19 of pregnancy, but during the light period of day 20 there was an increase to an average of 30 +/- 10 ng/ml, with no evidence of a peak related to the time of day. However, in the dark period between days 20 and 21 there was a large surge of PRL secretion which reached peak levels of 356 +/- 39 ng/ml at 0500 h on day 21, then returned to 48 +/- 20 ng/ml at 1200 h, around the time of parturition. The peak always occurred at 0500 h and was not related to the time of parturition which ranged from 1000-2200 h on day 21. Bilateral ovariectomy (OVX) on day 19 advanced the time of delivery by approximately 12 h. In seven of nine animals, no surge of PRL secretion was observed during the dark period preceding parturition. Estradiol treatment after OVX on day 19 (OVX+E) advanced the time of delivery by approx 18 h. An antepartum PRL surge was present and was advanced by 24 h in all OVX+E animals, peaking at 0300 h on day 20. Progesterone treatment from day 18 to 21 in intact pregnant animals delayed parturition by approximately 18 h and prevented PRL secretion during the period of treatment. After progesterone treatment was stopped, a nocturnal surge of PRL secretion occurred, peaking at 0500 h on day 22, 24 h after the surge in normal animals. The results suggest that the increased PRL secretion during late pregnancy is linked to the daily photoperiod and is characterized by a nocturnal surge in the dark period preceding parturition. This surge is inhibited by progesterone, and it can be advanced 24 h by estradiol treatment in the absence of the ovaries.\r"

  ".W": "Sexual differences in the regulation of tonic luteinizing hormone (LH) secretion were examined in immature female and male sheep (eight each, including six pairs of female/male twins). After gonadectomy of lambs at 2 weeks of age, Silastic capsules filled with estradiol, a primary central feedback steroid in both females and males, were implanted every 3 weeks for 3 days, and then removed, so that the pattern of LH secretion could be repeatedly determined in the same individuals both with and without steroid feedback. Implanted capsules yielded circulating steroid levels of 2-5 pg/ml. Circulating LH concentrations were determined by radioimmunoassay in blood samples collected at 12-min intervals for 4 h immediately before estradiol was implanted, and again, immediately before it was removed 3 days later. In male lambs, a decrease in responsiveness of the hypothalamic-pituitary axis to inhibition by estradiol began at 8-11 weeks, as evidenced by the progressive increase in mean LH concentrations and frequency of LH pulses. This correlated temporally with the onset of spermatogenesis in intact male controls (n = 8). In females, a similar decrease in responsiveness did not occur until 26-29 weeks of age, corresponding to the onset of ovulatory cycles in intact female controls (n = 6). In the absence of estradiol implants, LH pulse frequencies were higher in male lambs than in female lambs between 5 and 35 weeks of age. There was no further increase in LH pulse frequency in the absence of the gonads in either sex during the pubertal period. These findings suggest that the mechanism regulating tonic LH secretion in developing lambs is sexually differentiated in its responsiveness to inhibition by estradiol. This differentiation also occurs at a more fundamental steroid-independent level, but any causal relationship between the higher steroid-independent LH pulse frequency and the lower responsiveness to estradiol negative feedback in males is not evident. We hypothesize that these sexual differences in the regulation of tonic LH underlie the difference in the timing of puberty in male and female lambs.\r"

  ".W": "To determine whether galanin (GAL), a 29-amino acid neuropeptide, plays a role in the physiological regulation of the pulsatile secretion of GH and PRL in the male rat, secretory patterns of both hormones were studied in freely moving animals after GAL passive immunoneutralization. Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were equipped with iv and intracerebroventricular catheters. After 7 days, 3 microliters of a specific GAL antiserum (GAL-AS) or normal rabbit serum (NRS; controls) were infused in the third ventricle of 10 rats, 25 and 1 h before the animals were bled every 15 min for 6 h (1000-1600 h). Plasma GH and PRL concentrations were measured by RIA, and the hormonal secretory patterns were analyzed by the PULSAR program. Control rats, treated with NRS, displayed typical GH secretion, with pulses of high amplitude (167 +/- 27 ng/ml) and low frequency (2.4 +/- 0.2 pulses/6 h), separated by periods of low trough levels (3.8 +/- 0.6 ng/ml). Rats treated with GAL-AS had altered pulsatile GH secretion. Pulse height was markedly reduced (77 +/- 15 ng/ml; P less than 0.01 vs. controls), and peak frequency was higher (3.6 +/- 0.5 pulses/6 h; P less than 0.05), while GH baseline levels and integrated GH secretion over the 6-h sampling period remained unaltered. Injection of rat GH-releasing hormone (1 microgram/rat, iv) caused a similar GH stimulation in both groups of rats, as determined by the peak GH response at 5 min (368 +/- 112 vs. 342 +/- 81 ng/ml) or by the integrated GH response over 1 h (5.13 +/- 1.30 vs. 4.77 +/- 1.15 micrograms.min/ml in NRS- and GAL-AS-treated rats, respectively; P less than 0.05). In contrast to GH, pulsatile secretion of PRL was not affected by the GAL-AS treatment. These results indicate that GAL is a physiological regulator of spontaneous pulsatile secretion of GH, but not PRL, in the male rat. The influence of GAL on GH secretion appears to be exerted within the hypothalamus, mainly by a stimulation of GRF secretion. However, the changes in GH pulse frequency observed after GAL immunoneutralization suggest that GAL might also influence the somatostatin inhibitory tone.\r"

There was no significant change in the ACTH content and POMC mRNA levels in the intermediate-posterior pituitary or the hypothalamus or in the CRF contents and CRF mRNA levels in the cerebral cortex.

  ".W": "Bovine granulosa cells were cultured in a defined serum-free system to examine their responsiveness to acetylcholine (ACh). Continuous exposure to concentrations of ACh between 10(-8)-10(-4) M resulted in dose-dependent increases (up to 6.7-fold) in the secretion of oxytocin and progesterone, with an ED50 of 6.6 microM. Ascorbic acid (0.5 mM), a known stimulator of granulosa secretion, synergized with ACh, resulting in an increase in the amounts of hormone secreted and a 7-fold increase in cellular sensitivity to ACh (ED50 = approximately 0.9 microM). Treatment of cells with ACh for 24 h at various times during a typical 5-day culture resulted in a stimulation that persisted for up to 4 days after removal of ACh. Carbachol (10(-8)-10(-4) M), a receptor antagonist with both antimuscarinic and antinicotinic actions, had no distinct effect on hormone secretion by the cells, but the effects of 10(-5) M ACh could be completely abolished by equimolar or hypomolar concentrations of the specific muscarinic receptor antagonists atropine and scopolamine. Nicotine bitratrate (10(-8)-10(4) M), a dose-dependent nicotinic receptor agonist/antagonist, had no effect on the cells. It is concluded that bovine granulosa cells, exhibiting a luteinized phenotype in culture, are responsive to cholinergic agonists in a specific and saturable manner. The response of the cells is probably mediated through muscarinic receptors and has both medium and long term (persistent) components. These results indicate that cholinergic neurotransmitters may play a direct role in the regulation of ovarian function in the ruminant.\r"

Analysis included the measurement of immunoreactive MAP2 and its mRNA. In addition, the intracellular distribution of MAP2 was studied by immunostaining of the appropriate histological preparations. The results showed that the developmental increase in MAP2 is delayed in congenital hypothyroidism, but eventually the concentration of this protein reached normal levels in animals with this condition, even if untreated. These abnormalities in the immunoreactive protein are not paralleled by abnormalities in the abundance of MAP2 mRNA, which was not affected by the thyroid status of the animals. In spite of the normalization of the content of the protein, the distribution of MAP2 in the Purkinje cells of hypothyroid rats remained abnormal. Whereas in euthyroid rats the protein rapidly migrated into the dendrites, in the Purkinje cells of hypothyroid pups, MAP2 remained largely confined to the body and the most proximal part of the dendrites. These results suggest that thyroid hormone affects the expression of MAP2 at translation or posttranslational levels. The abnormality in distribution may result from some posttranslational abnormality of the protein itself or some underlying defect in the function of the neurons. These observations are probably relevant to the abnormalities in cerebellar function seen in animals and humans with untreated congenital hypothyroidism.\r"

Fractions of 1.5 ml were collected at 3 min intervals and analyzed for vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), galanin, 7B2, and substance P, using specific radioimmunoassays. Concentrations of 0.02, 0.1, 0.2, and 0.4 microM ACTH produced increases of 117 +/- 50%, 155 +/- 90%, 163 +/- 14%, and 161 +/- 3% (mean + SE), respectively, of basal release of VIP (P less than 0.001). However, concentrations of 1 microM and 2 microM ACTH suppressed VIP release to 74 +/- 6% and 47 +/- 4%, respectively, compared to basal release (P less than 0.001). Results for galanin release were similar: concentrations of 0.02, 0.1, 0.2, and 0.4 microM ACTH increased galanin release to 129 +/- 4%, 136 +/- 8%, 143 +/- 9%, and 133 +/- 9% of basal release (P less than 0.001) and 1 and 2 microM ACTH provoked a suppression of 52 +/- 7% and 50 +/- 13%, respectively, compared with basal release (P less than 0.001). Doses of ACTH that altered the secretion of VIP and galanin had no effect on 7B2 and substance P release. These results demonstrate that ACTH causes a release of pituitary VIP and galanin in vitro and, moreover, that this is a biphasic phenomenon.\r"

Results observed in a crude preparation of urinary hCG demonstrated that in addition to the carboxyl-terminal part of the reduced hCG beta nicked subunit (beta NS) [hCG beta-(48-145)], three other fragments of mol wt 18,000 (F1), 16,500 (F2), and 12,000 (F3) were detectable after cleavage of disulfide bonds. Both the immunoreactivity pattern and peptide sequencing revealed that the F1 fragment was constituted of the hCG beta-(1-47) sequence, whereas the F2 fragment comprised the 6-47 portion. We then studied the beta NS in urine from either pregnant women or four patients with choriocarcinomas. Results showed that both hCG and the free beta-subunit contained beta NS. Furthermore, free hCG beta present in those urine samples appeared to be extensively, if not totally, nicked. Results observed in urine were confirmed using separation of hCG from its beta-subunit by a two-step chromatography procedure, identification of hCG and hCG beta immunoreactive peaks by specific monoclonal immunoradiometric assay, and analysis of resulting preparations by one-dimensional electrophoresis under reducing conditions, followed by Western immunoblotting with FB12. This latter protocol was also used to investigate the presence of beta NS in sera of four patients with choriocarcinoma tumors. In those sera, hCG appeared to be nicked. This study demonstrates that the beta-subunit of hCG is modified by multiple fragmentations.\r"

Both cell populations released PA activity of the tissue type and a 50K PAI species into the culture medium. However, mature osteoblasts had a strikingly lower PA activity and higher PAI activity than periosteal precursor cells, indicating that osteoblast differentiation is associated with a marked decrease in the PA/PAI ratio. PTH and prostaglandin E2 transiently increased PA activity and decreased PAI activity. In contrast, transforming growth factor-beta decreased PA activity and increased PAI activity. Differential effects of these factors on PA and PAI activity may be involved in the regulation of extracellular matrix deposition by osteoblasts.\r"

  ".W": "The sexually dimorphic profiles of pituitary GH secretion play a key role in regulating the expression of several sex-dependent and developmentally controlled P-450 enzymes in rat liver. Current models for P-450 regulation by GH, however, are primarily based on hypophysectomy and GH replacement experiments. The present study examines the effects on hepatic P-450 expression of neonatal injections of monosodium glutamate (MSG), which allows for the nonsurgical suppression of adult GH levels. Furthermore, the levels of other pituitary-dependent hormones, such as testosterone and estradiol, are largely unchanged in the MSG-treated rats. Although hypophysectomy and GH replacement experiments have previously demonstrated that expression of the female-specific hepatic enzymes P-450 2d (gene product IIC12) and steroid 5 alpha-reductase is strikingly dependent on continuous GH exposure, neither enzyme was decreased in adult female rat liver after the elimination of plasma GH (less than 2 ng/ml) by neonatal MSG treatment. Moreover, although the loss of circulating GH appears to be largely responsible for the more than 10- to 20-fold elevation of the male-specific hepatic P-450 forms 2a (gene product IIIA2) and RLM2 (gene product IIA2) in hypophysectomized female rats, no such elevation of the male-specific P-450s was observed in the GH-deficient MSG-treated female rats. In contrast, the female-predominant forms P-450j (gene product IIE1) and 3 (gene product IIA1) were both elevated in adult rat liver after neonatal MSG treatment, in agreement with earlier hypophysectomy studies and demonstrating the suppressive effects that GH can exert on expression of these P-450 forms. Thus, although MSG and hypophysectomy both produce GH depletion, the responsiveness of the hepatic P-450s to these endocrine manipulations differs, allowing for an expanded understanding of the role of GH in P-450 expression.\r"

  ".W": "The humoral hypercalcemia of malignancy factor (also called PTH-related protein or PTHrp) has been shown to produce effects similar to PTH in the kidney, bone, and cardiovascular system. Binding of PTHrp and PTH has been characterized in renal and osseous tissues, but not in vascular tissue. We have attempted to characterize the interaction of both human PTHrp and rat PTH to renal microvessels as a model of vascular smooth muscle and in a renal tubule preparation from the same rabbit kidneys. Previous studies have shown the microvessel and tubule preparations to be distinct based upon morphological examination, differential enzyme markers, calcitonin and vasopressin-sensitive adenylate cyclase distribution, and different characteristics of guanine nucleotide and of oxidized PTH activation of the adenylate cyclases associated with the preparations. Human PTHrp and rat PTH were iodinated by standard techniques and purified by HPLC. Both ligands bound to microvessels and tubules in a saturable, specific manner, Maximal specific binding of either ligand was 65-75% in microvessels and 80-90% in renal tubules. The time courses of binding of both ligands were identical with steady state achieved within 20 min in the smooth muscle of microvessels and 15 min in the tubules at 22 C. In equilibrium competition binding experiments, bound 125I-PTHrp was displaced by both PTHrp and PTH in microvessels and tubules. Rat PTH displayed slightly higher affinity in microvessels and tubules than PTHrp. Identical results were obtained with 125I-PTH as ligand. Specificity of binding of PTHrp and PTH to both microvessels and tubules was excellent, with competition observed between the radioactive ligand and bovine and rat PTH, PTHrp, and the antagonists, [Nle8,18, Tyr34]bovine PTH and [Nle8,18, Tyr34]bovine PTH but not with several other peptides of unrelated structure. The only major difference in binding between microvessels and tubules was a smaller number of binding sites in microvessels compared to tubules. These results indicate that vascular tissue contains receptor sites for PTH and PTHrp as identified by radioligand binding techniques. These receptors are similar in characteristics to the receptors of renal tubular tissue. Both PTH and PTHrp appear to interact with the receptors of rabbit kidney microvessels and tubules.\r"

  ".W": "Oxytocin (OT) has been shown to play a role in the control of physiological PRL release and has been demonstrated to have a direct effect on the pituitary to stimulate PRL secretion. Administration of OT into the third ventricle, however, lowers PRL levels. This reduction could be mediated by either an inhibition of the release of endogenous OT into the hypohysial portal circulation or via an alteration in the release of some other PRL releasing (PRF) or PRL release-inhibiting (PIF) factor. In order to determine if centrally administered OT lowers PRL levels by increasing secretion of dopamine (DA) into the portal circulation, endogenous dopaminergic tone was blocked by injection of the DA antagonist domperidone (DOM). Subcutaneous administration of DOM resulted in elevated PRL levels which could be further augmented by iv infusion of OT (at 0.01 or 0.1 microgram OT/kg.min) or partially, but significantly, reduced by pretreatment with anti-OT antiserum (0.75 ml) indicating that under conditions of DA blockade, OT (which has little PRF activity during conditions of normal dopaminergic tone) can stimulate PRL secretion by a direct pituitary action. Treatment with DOM did not prevent, however, the reduction in PRL levels produced by central administration of OT (2 micrograms). This suggests that the effect of OT to alter PRL secretion when administered into the third ventricle was not mediated via an increase in DA release into the portal circulation. Furthermore, central administration of the OT antagonist CAV-259 (1-deamino-2-D-Trp-4-Val-8-Orn-OT) after DOM treatment resulted in a significant increase in PRL secretion indicating that endogenous levels of OT within the hypothalamus inhibit PRL secretion through a nondopaminergic mechanism. This stimulatory effect of the OT antagonist was not blocked by pretreatment with anti-OT antiserum (iv) which had been demonstrated previously to reduce the PRL surges in lactating mothers and steroid-primed ovariectomized rats, as well as to block the increase in PRL secretion seen after central administration of vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP). Thus the central effect of OT to alter PRL secretion was probably not due to a change in the release of OT into the portal circulation. Intravenous administration of a VIP antagonist (D-4-Cl-6-Phe-17-Leu-VIP, previously demonstrated to be capable of reducing the PRL surge seen in lactating mothers) into DOM-treated rats does not alter PRL levels but blocks the ability of central administration of the OT antagonist CAV-259 to increase PRL levels under these conditions.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "To examine the molecular genetic basis for the age-related increase in PRL secretion and decrease in LH production in the rat, we measured steady state levels of PRL and LH beta mRNA in pituitary homogenates and cell lysates from monolayer adenohypophyseal cultures. These mRNA levels were compared with the corresponding levels of immunoreactive PRL and LH in sera and culture media. Paired groups (n = 4-10/group) of intact and 4-week ovariectomized mature (6-7 months old) and old (23-25 months old) female Wistar rats were studied. Serum PRL levels were 550% higher in intact old vs. mature rats (P less than 0.001), whereas the corresponding pituitary homogenate levels of PRL mRNA were similar (P greater than 0.4). Medium PRL concentrations were 230% greater (P less than 0.006) whereas cell lysate concentrations of PRL mRNA were unaltered (P greater than 0.2) in monolayer cultures from intact old vs. mature rats. Serum PRL levels were 650% higher (P less than 0.003) and pituitary homogenate PRL mRNA levels were slightly increased (P less than 0.04) in ovariectomized old vs. mature rats. Neither serum LH values (P greater than 0.07) nor pituitary homogenate LH beta mRNA levels (P greater than 0.1) differed in intact old and mature rats, whereas the corresponding medium concentrations of LH were reduced (P less than 0.001). Ovariectomized old vs. mature rats exhibited reductions in serum (P less than 0.02) and medium (P less than 0.001) LH concentrations, as well as in pituitary homogenate (P less than 0.002) and cell lysate (P less than 0.006) LH beta mRNA levels. Thus, these data revealed coordinate decreases with age in LH beta mRNA and LH secretion, particularly in ovariectomized rats, suggesting an age-related alteration at or before LH beta gene transcription. These findings parallel observations on other genes whose products change with age. In contrast, the observation that the increased secretion of PRL in old rats is accompanied by little or no increase in PRL mRNA is novel and suggests that age-related alterations in PRL gene expression proceed through a posttranscriptional mechanism.\r"

  ".U": "90126598\r", 
  ".W": "We have found that androgens and estradiol-17 beta (E2) produced by theca cells suppress progesterone (P4) secretion by granulosa cells of the domestic hen in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, testosterone (T) and E2 inhibited the conversion of cholesterol to pregnenolone (P5) and of P5 to P4, respectively. The aim of this study was to determine if T and E2 suppress P4 biosynthesis by changing activities of the cytochrome P450 cholesterol side chain cleavage (P450scc) and 3 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3 beta-HSD) (Exp I) and the amount of P450scc (Exp II). Granulosa layers of the largest follicle of two to four hens were obtained 22 h before ovulation, pooled, and isolated granulosa cells were prepared. In Exp I, the specific activities of the P450scc and 3 beta-HSD were measured in mitochondrial and microsomal proteins of granulosa cells, respectively, in the presence of T or E2 (0-10 microM). Addition of T to mitochondrial proteins increased the Michaelis-Menten constant (Km) with no change in the maximum velocity (Vmax) of the P450scc, which suggests competitive inhibition (Ki = 30.9 microM), whereas E2 had no effect on Km and Vmax of the P450scc. Likewise, addition of E2 to microsomal proteins increased the Km with no change in the Vmax of the 3 beta-HSD, which suggests competitive inhibition (Ki = 15.1 microM), whereas T had no effect on Km and Vmax of the 3 beta-HSD. In Exp II, granulosa cells (3 x 10(5)/3 ml.tube) were incubated for 0-12 h in triplicate for each combined treatments of 25-OH-cholesterol (8 microM) and cyanoketone (10 microM), T, or E2 (0-10 microM) in the presence or absence of LH (25 ng). Protein content and P5 secretion were measured and the amount of P450scc was determined by Western blot analysis. Incubation of granulosa cells with T decreased the amount of the P450scc in granulosa cells cultured for 12 h and P5 secretion in granulosa cells cultured for 3 h or longer (P less than 0.05), without a change in protein content and cell viability. Our results suggest that P4 production by granulosa cells is suppressed by T and E2 acting as competitive inhibitors of the P450scc and 3 beta-HSD, respectively, and by T decreasing the amount of the P450scc. We conclude that steroidogenesis in the follicle of the chicken is regulated through the interaction of theca and granulosa layers.\r"

  ".U": "90126600\r", 
  ".W": "It has been reported that the addition of antibody (Ab) against human immunoglobulin G (IgG) converts TSH receptor-bound blocking-type IgG to stimulating-type IgG. However, the detail of converting mechanism remains unclear. In this study we examined the mechanism involved in this conversion using FRTL-5 cells. Blocking-type IgG was obtained from a patient with hypothyroidism. FRTL-5 cells were first incubated with IgG solution, then washed with PBS and exposed to antihuman IgG Ab. The effect of antihuman IgG Ab on converting activity was dose dependent. Maximal stimulation of cAMP was achieved with an antiserum dilution of 1:75. It seems likely that antimicrosomal Ab does not interfere with cAMP production, since IgG with a high anti-hemagglutination antibody titer did not show converting activity. Of the several kinds of antibodies tested, Ab against human IgG-Fab fragment was the most effective in converting ability, while the least effective were those against human IgG-Fc fragment. Although the divalent F(ab')2 fragment of antihuman IgG was significantly more effective in its converting ability than the monovalent Fab fragment, the Fab fragment itself also converted blocking IgG to the stimulating type in a dose-dependent manner. Accordingly, receptor cross-linking or aggregation does not play a major role in promoting this converting phenomenon. When cells were first exposed to blocking-type IgG and then to both antihuman IgG Ab and bovine TSH, cAMP production was much greater than the sum of each alone. However, anti-IgG Ab alone did not affect the binding of blocking-type IgG to receptor. These results suggest that the addition of antihuman IgG Ab not only converts blocking-type IgG to the stimulating type but also recovers TSH activity via a postreceptor step. Forskolin, like TSH, showed an additive effect on cAMP stimulatory action with antihuman IgG. In contrast, cholera toxin and antihuman IgG Ab were not additive. The reason for this discrepancy remains unknown. In summary, our observation indicates that 1) the converting phenomenon is induced via IgG-TSH receptor complexes; 2) the mechanism aside from receptor aggregation, i.e. the recognition of a critical domain in TSH receptor molecule, seems necessary for promoting converting phenomenon; and 3) the addition of antihuman IgG Ab affects a postreceptor step via TSH receptor structures that differ from the TSH-binding site.\r"

Estrogen and progesterone suppress physiological responses to the administration of opiate peptides. To determine whether this desensitization to opiates involves receptor down-regulation, we measured the density of naloxone-binding sites in hypothalamic regions regulating gonadotropin release and/or sexual behavior. Using autoradiographic techniques, we measured the density of naloxone-binding sites at various times of the day in intact proestrous, ovariectomized, or ovariectomized rats treated with estrogen or estrogen plus progesterone. Ovariectomy increased naloxone-binding sites compared to intact proestrous rats in all hypothalamic regions examined. Treatment with estrogen decreased and treatment with estrogen plus progesterone decreased even more the densities of naloxone-binding sites. This steroid-induced suppression of opiate receptors appears to have important physiological repercussions and provides a basis for the steroid-induced differential sensitivity to exogenous opiates that has been observed previously.\r"

The content in C3, D1, T1, and T5 cells, respectively, was 8,560 +/- 1,450, 13,160 +/- 1,240, 2,425 +/- 490, and 10,540 +/- 1,025 sites/cell (mean +/- SEM). Respective Kd values were 160 +/- 48, 200 +/- 53, 24 +/- 3, and 115 +/- 15 pM (mean +/- SEM). T1 cell TGF beta receptor site content and Kd differed significantly from those of other prostate cancer cell lines (P less than 0.05). TGF beta is a bifunctional concentration-dependent modulator of T1 and T5 cell thymidine incorporation. At low concentrations, thymidine incorporation was inhibited, whereas as the medium TGF beta content was increased, T1 and T5 cell thymidine incorporation was stimulated. The concentrations of TGF beta causing half-maximum inhibition of T1 or T5 cell thymidine incorporation, respectively, were 0.11 and 0.24 pM, whereas the respective TGF beta concentrations causing half-maximum stimulation of thymidine incorporation were 14.4 and 134 pM. These findings establish that rat prostate cancer cell sensitivity to TGF beta inhibition of function is at least 2 orders of magnitude greater than that of most other mammalian cells. In contrast, the sensitivity of rat prostate cancer cells to TGF beta enhancement of function is comparable to that of other mammalian cells. TGF beta inhibited basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) stimulation of T1 and T5 cell thymidine incorporation. Because the concentration of bFGF required for half-maximum increase of T5 cell thymidine incorporation was independent of medium TGF beta content, the effect of TGF beta is distal to the T5 cell bFGF receptor. In contrast, the concentration of bFGF required for half-maximum increase in T1 cell thymidine incorporation increased 5-fold as the medium TGF beta content was increased; suggesting that the effect of TGF beta in T1 cells is proximal to the T1 cell bFGF receptor. Our studies establish that rat prostate cancer cells contain functional TGF beta receptors, imply the presence of functional bFGF receptors, and demonstrate that mitogen modulation of prostate cancer cell function is multifactorial. The finding that TGF beta is a bifunctional effector of prostate cancer cell DNA synthesis provides some insight into the potential complexity of mitogen modulation of prostate cancer cell proliferation. The mechanism by which these mitogens interact is unknown; however, our studies suggest that some interactive effects may be cell line specific.\r"

  ".W": "Type I iodothyronine 5'deiodinase (5'D-I) is a membrane-bound enzyme catalyzing the deiodination of T4 to T3. The affinity label, N-bromoacetyl-thyroxine (BrAcT4), has previously been used to characterize a 27 kilodalton protein (p27) from rat liver and kidney microsomes with characteristics of the catalytic subunit of the 5'D-I. We examined the effect of physiological conditions, known to alter 5'D-I activity, on affinity-labeled proteins in rat liver and kidney microsomes. To confirm that the affinity labeled protein was associated with the deiodinase, we treated rats with the active site directed enzyme inhibitor, propylthiouracil (PTU), in the absence and presence of 100-fold excess methimazole (MMI), an antithyroid drug which blocks PTU inhibition of 5'D-I in vivo. In addition, we used the affinity label as a probe to measure 5'D-I levels in membrane preparations from short and long term fasted rats. Rats were treated ip with PTU (50 micrograms/100 g BW) or MMI (5 mg/100 g BW); in a second experiment, groups of rats were fasted for 4 days (4 D), 1 day (1 D), or fed ad lib (C) and hepatic and kidney microsomes were prepared. 5'D-I activity and 5'D-I content, as judged by specific incorporation of the affinity label into p27, were determined. PTU decreased both 5'D-I activity and BrACT incorporation into p27 by 60-65%. Coadministration of MMI attenuated the effect of PTU on 5'D-I activity and p27 affinity labeling. No other affinity labeled proteins were affected. In fasting experiments, the changes in affinity labeling of p27 paralleled the changes in 5'D-I activity. 5'D-I activity was significantly decreased in hepatic microsomes obtained from 4 D-fasted rats as compared to C rats, but was unchanged in hepatic microsomes from 1 D-fasted rats or in kidney microsomes from 1 D or 4 D-fasted rats as compared to C. Maximal BrAcT4 incorporation into p27 decreased by 45% in hepatic microsomes from 4 D-starved rats as compared to C (6.7 +/- 0.9 vs. 11.9 +/- 1.5 pmol BrAcT4 incorporated/mg microsomal protein, respectively). There was no change in p27 content in hepatic microsomes from 1 D-starved rats (11.2 +/- 1.1). Starvation failed to alter the BrAcT4 labeling of kidney microsomes (16.7 +/- 4.4, 16.2 +/- 6.6, and 14.8 +/- 3.2 pmol BrAcT4 in 4 D, 1 D, and C rats, respectively). In this study, we have demonstrated that alterations in biological activity of 5'D-I correspond to alterations in affinity labeling of p27.\r"

Like type I treated rats, PRL levels in type II steroid-treated rats were elevated from day 13 onward after E2 capsule insertion. In Exp 2, treatment of both type I and type II steroid-treated rats with bromocriptine (2 mg/kg, sc) twice daily beginning on treatment day 13 suppressed basal PRL concentrations and prevented the estrogen-induced diurnal PRL surge. Whereas PRL was effectively suppressed by bromocriptine in both steroid-treated groups, the absolute levels of PRL were lower in rats treated with the type II steroid regimen. Behavioral analyses in Exp 3, 4, and 5 revealed that bromocriptine administration, while failing to interfere with the onset of maternal behavior in rats treated with the type I concurrent steroid regimen, disrupted the onset of maternal care in rats treated with the type II sequential steroid regimen. When a separate set of type II steroid-treated rats was given both bromocriptine (2 mg/kg) plus ovine PRL (0.5 mg, sc) twice daily, maternal behavior rapidly appeared. Thus, suppression of endogenous PRL secretion delays the onset of maternal behavior in nonhypophysectomized steroid-primed rats, an effect prevented by concurrent administration of ovine PRL. In addition to providing further experimental support for PRL's role in maternal behavior, the development of this endocrine regimen provides researchers with a potentially fruitful model to examine neural sites and mechanisms of PRL regulation of maternal behavior in mammals.\r"

A time-course analysis of the effect of perifusing the cells for 60 min with Ca2(+)-free medium on 10 nM CRF-stimulated ACTH release revealed that inhibition required about 3 min to begin and about 40 min to reach maximal effect. Within 2 min of restoring Ca2+ to the medium, ACTH secretion rebounded for about 5 min before falling to the pre-Ca2+e removal rate. A similar pattern and time course were observed when Ca2+e was more completely removed by perifusing the cells with Ca2(+)-free medium containing 2 mM EGTA, except that greater suppression was observed. Removing Ca2+e reduced CRF- and 5 mM 8-Br-cAMP-induced ACTH release by 54% and 49%, respectively, and delayed by 1 min the response to 8-Br-cAMP, but not that to CRF. Perifusing 0.2 mM nimodipine, a dihydropyridine Ca2+ channel blocker, before and after restoration of Ca2+ to the Ca2(+)-free medium inhibited ACTH release by 40-48%, and the blockade persisted for at least 70 min after nimodipine was removed from the medium. When intracellular Ca2+ was depleted by perifusing the cells with Ca2(+)-free/EGTA medium containing the Ca2+ ionophore A23187 to facilitate the efflux of Ca2+i, CRF- and 8-Br-cAMP-stimulated ACTH release were reduced by 70% and 71%, respectively, and the responses to both agents were delayed by 1 min. Preperifusion of the cells with 5 microM penfluridol, a calmodulin inhibitor, reduced CRF- and 8-Br-cAMP-induced ACTH release by 54% and 41%, respectively. The combination of Ca2+i depletion and perifusion with 100 nM dexamethasone, a maximally inhibitory concentration, inhibited CRF- and 8-Br-cAMP-stimulated ACTH release by 82% and 83%, respectively.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

The cells were stimulated with synthetic arginine vasopressin (AVP), oxytocin (OT), and angiotensin-II (AII), all of which are thought to act via the Ca2+/inositol phosphate-dependent protein kinase-C pathway, with synthetic ovine CRF, which acts via the cAMP-dependent protein kinase-A pathway, and with dioctanoylglycerol, which directly activates protein kinase-C. All three secretagogues elicited an initial spike phase ACTH secretory response that peaked within 1 or 2 min and ended within 6 min. AVP and OT also elicited a sustained plateau phase response that lasted for as long as the cells were exposed to the secretagogue, but AII did not. Removal of Ca2+e diminished the initial spike phase by 30-50%, but depletion of Ca2+i virtually abolished it. In contrast, the sustained phase of the response to AVP and OT was abolished by removal of Ca2+e. The effect of dioctanoylglycerol, which elicits a sustained progressive increase in ACTH release, but no initial spike phase, was also greatly inhibited by Ca2+e removal; no greater effect was observed when Ca2+i was depleted. Blockade of L-type voltage-sensitive Ca2+ channels with nimodipine, a dihydropyridine drug, had the same effect as Ca2+e removal on both the initial spike and sustained plateau phases of the response to AVP. Inhibiting cAMP-dependent calmodulin with penfluridol had no effect on the initial spike phase, but reduced the sustained plateau phase of the response to AVP. Removal of Ca2+e or depletion of Ca2+i did not abolish the synergistic ACTH secretory response to the combination of AVP and CRF.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Protein deprivation in young rats retards growth and decreases serum insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) concentrations, neither of which is prevented by injections of GH once daily. Since four time daily injections of GH in hypophysectomized rats increase serum IGF-I concentrations more efficiently than single daily injections, we assessed whether this mode of GH delivery could overcome the GH resistance of protein malnutrition. Also, we evaluated whether continuous GH infusion could override this GH resistance. We fed 4-week-old female Wistar rats a low (5%) protein diet (P5) or a normal (15%) protein diet (P15) for 7 days. In a first experiment, rats fed a P5 diet received 40 or 400 micrograms/100 g BW.day rat GH (rGH) in four daily sc injections, while control P5 rats were injected at the same frequency with vehicle. In a second experiment, rats fed a P5 diet received 200 micrograms rGH/100 g BW.day by continuous infusion, while P5 sham-operated rats served as controls. IGF-I was measured by RIA on extracted serum, and free and total liver GH binding were determined by incubation of [125I]bovine GH with water- or MgCl2-treated homogenates, respectively. Neither continuous infusion nor repeated injections of rGH normalized the indices of growth or restored the serum IGF-I level to P15 control values. Injections of 400 micrograms rGH increased serum IGF-I 2-fold (P less than 0.01), but did not promote growth. Continuous GH infusion increased total and free liver GH binding to P15 control values, but had no effect on serum IGF-I. The discordance between liver GH binding and IGF-I confirms that a postreceptor defect is responsible for the GH resistance in protein restriction. These observations demonstrate that the consequences of protein restriction on growth are not overridden by intermittent or continuous administration of GH. The increase in IGF-I in response to 400 micrograms GH given intermittently in the absence of growth-promoting effects suggests that nutritional sufficiency is essential for IGF-I to promote growth.\r"

  ".W": "The release of ACTH, corticosterone, and PRL was compared in capsaicin-pretreated rats, which lack afferent C-fibers, and their controls under somatosensory (cold, surgery) and central (restraint) forms of stress. Cold stress induced the release of ACTH and consequently that of corticosterone in the controls, but not in the capsaicin-pretreated rats. Intravenous injection of ACTH1-24 was equally effective in releasing corticosterone in both groups. Whereas PRL was not released in response to cold stress, restraint stress did induce the release of both ACTH and PRL, in the capsaicin-pretreated as well as in the control group. Pentobarbital anesthesia alone elicited PRL, but no ACTH release. ACTH release was evoked by surgery under pentobarbital anesthesia but was abolished by capsaicin pretreatment. PRL levels were not further increased by surgery. Nicotine in a small dose (5 micrograms intra-arterially) evoked stimulation of afferent C-fibers as observed on a depressor reflex. Intraperitoneal injection of nicotine (250 micrograms/kg) caused a marked rise in plasma ACTH both in the capsaicin-pretreated conscious rats and in their controls, probably resulting from central stimulation as this effect was shown to be inhibited during pentobarbital anesthesia. A moderate rise of PRL by nicotine was seen in conscious rats. The stimuli used, regarded as experimental models of stress, show essential differences in their ability to evoke the release of ACTH, corticosterone, and PRL. Those stimuli which cause the release of ACTH and corticosterone via afferent C-fiber stimulation do not release PRL, whereas emotional and cognitive stress causes the release of both ACTH and PRL.\r"

  ".W": "Osteocalcin, one of the vitamin K-dependent bone proteins, has recently been implicated in bone resorption. To explore this hypothesis, bone and serum osteocalcin were measured in three different osteopetrotic rat mutations characterized by reduced bone resorption. These three mutations (ia/ia, tl/tl, and op/op) exhibit heterogeneity with respect to osteoclast number and activity and response to being cured by bone marrow transplantation. Calvarial bone osteocalcin was present in normal amounts, but difficult to extract, in ia/ia rats that have increased numbers of inactive osteoclasts. Bone osteocalcin was greatly decreased in op/op (53-60% of control) and tl/tl (64-73% of control) osteopetrotic rats, in which osteoclasts are both reduced in number and inactive. These decreases in osteocalcin levels in bone coexist with elevated serum levels of osteocalcin in all three mutations. Since osteocalcin synthesis is known to be stimulated by 1,25(OH)2D3, the increase in serum osteocalcin may be a reflection of the elevated blood levels of 1,25(OH)2D3 known to occur in each of these mutations. These findings indicate that the composition of osteopetrotic bone is abnormal with respect to osteocalcin in the two rat osteopetrotic mutations showing decreased osteoclast numbers. Considered together with the emerging evidence that the extracellular matrix in many developing tissues plays a role in cell recruitment and differentiation, these data suggest that osteocalcin abnormalities may be a contributing factor to the spectrum of osteoclast aberrations in osteopetrosis.\r"

  ".W": "To investigate whether glucocorticoids can stimulate rat brain angiotensinogen production directly, we have studied the effect of dexamethasone on angiotensinogen secretion and angiotensinogen mRNA concentration in primary astroglial cultures from rat diencephalon. Dexamethasone stimulated angiotensinogen secretion by astroglial cells in a dose-related fashion. The half-maximally effective concentration was 11 nM, and the effect was blocked by RU 486, an antagonist of type II glucocorticoid receptors. This was similar to what was observed in rat hepatoma H4IIEC cells, where the half-maximally effective concentration of dexamethasone on angiotensinogen secretion was 10 nM. At maximal concentrations, dexamethasone increased angiotensinogen secretion and angiotensinogen mRNA concentration 2-fold in astroglial cells. In the hepatoma cells, however, the increase in angiotensinogen secretion was 5-fold. The in vivo diencephalon angiotensinogen mRNA concentration was decreased after adrenalectomy. Dexamethasone restored those levels to normal and induced a modest increase when the animals were killed 6 h after drug administration. In contrast, dexamethasone induced a robust increase in liver angiotensinogen mRNA concentration in the same animals. These results indicate that glucocorticoids increase angiotensinogen production through a direct receptor-mediated mechanism in both liver and brain. However, the angiotensinogen gene appears much more responsive to the action of glucocorticoids in liver than in brain.\r"

Rat anterior pituitary tumor (GC) cells stably transfected with the hGH-V gene (GC [hGH-V] cells) synthesize and secrete hGH-V. This hormone shares considerable structural similarity with pituitary growth hormone (hGH-N) and chorionic somatomammotropin (hCS) at the nucleotide (greater than 90%) and amino acid (greater than 80%) levels. As expected, both hGH-N and hCS antibodies detect hGH-V by immunoblotting. However, hGH-V, but not hGH-N or hCS, cross-reacts with human or rat pituitary prolactin (PRL) antibodies. These data indicate that structural features shared by hGH-V and pituitary PRL are not present in hGH-N or hCS. Comparison of amino acid sequences implicates two regions that may account for a common epitope between hGH-V and hPRL, and structural difference from hGH-N and hCS. The possible lactogenic activity by hGH-V was assessed in a rat lymphoma Nb2 cell bioassay. Conditioned medium from GC[hGH-V] cells permitted growth of lactogen-dependent Nb2 lymphoma cells in culture. This activity was blocked by antibodies raised to rat PRL but not hPRL or hGH-N. Comparison of the hGH-V amino acid sequence with those from 14 other lactogenic hormones, including hPRL, hCS and hGH-N, reveals 6 conserved amino acids. These data indicate a lactogenic as well as growth-promoting function for the secreted hGH-V protein in vivo.\r"

The primary structure of the peptide was determined by automated Edman degradation and fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry. The amino acid sequence of the turtle kinin Arg-Pro-Pro-Gly-Phe-Thr-Pro-Phe-Arg contains the substitution Thr for Ser at position 6 compared with mammalian bradykinin. [Thr6] bradykinin was synthesized using solid phase methodology, and bolus injections of the peptide into the left atrium of the anaesthetized turtle produced rapid vasodilation. A dose-dependent increase in blood flow in the left aortic arch was accompanied by a decrease in peripheral vascular resistance, so that systemic blood pressure did not change. The data suggest that the kallikrein-kinin system may play an important physiological role in the regulation of cardiovascular function in reptiles.\r"

We combined hysteroscopic cannulation of the proximal fallopian tube with laparoscopy in 11 patients with proximal tubal obstruction diagnosed by HSG and confirmed at laparoscopy.

Six of the 11 patients became pregnant after tubal cannulation and adjunctive distal tubal surgery.

  ".W": "To assess the value of reinseminating human oocytes, the results of 1,662 embryo transfers were analyzed. In 1,460 transfers embryos arose from oocytes that had fertilized and cleaved after initial insemination. The pregnancy rate was significantly higher than in transfers of embryos (n = 76) resulting solely from reinseminated oocytes (27% versus 3%). Adding reinseminated embryos to those fertilizing on initial insemination at transfer failed to raise the pregnancy rate. Only 2 of 158 (1.3%) reinseminated embryos implanted compared with 540 of 4,181 (12.9%) fertilized and cleaved on initial insemination (P less than 0.001). Reinseminated embryos do occasionally produce viable pregnancies. It is therefore worth considering replacement of these embryos if initial fertilization has entirely failed. Patients should be counseled as to the low chance of implantation with these embryos.\r"

Duration of cocaine use for five or more years was more common in men with low sperm motility (OR = 2.0, 95% CI 1.0, 4.1) and in those with low concentrations and a large proportion of abnormal forms. Other major risk factors for these three indicators of male subfertility also have been identified, but the cocaine risk factors remained after adjustment for them. This association, together with the high prevalence of cocaine use in the general male population, suggests cocaine may now be related to male subfertility and that history of use should be ascertained during diagnostic interviews.\r"

  ".W": "The monoclonal antibody (mAb) MHS-10 (IgG1) is a mouse antihuman sperm antibody which recognizes a polymorphic sperm protein, (SP-10), which has previously been localized within the acrosomal matrix and the acrosomal membranes. The SP-10 antigen has been shown to be sperm-specific and is not found in somatic tissues. It is stage specific, having been immunohistologically localized to Golgi phase spermatids and all subsequent phases of spermiogenesis. In the present study, acetone-dried smears from washed human semen containing significant numbers of round cells were probed with mAb MHS-10. Monoclonal antibody-labeled cells were visualized by a standard streptavidin-biotin immunoperoxidase method using a light microscope. The MHS-10 mAb immunoreacted with mature sperm and with a subset of round cells diagnosed as developing spermatids, which had been sloughed off from the testis at varying stages of acrosome formation. To rule out possible cross-reactivity of the mAb with leukocytes in semen, a leukocyte surface marker (anti-HLe-1) was used in conjunction with MHS-10. Round cell populations staining with MHS-10 did not stain with anti-HLe-1. The mAb MHS-10 is thus a promising probe for the identification and quantitation of immature germ cells in human semen.\r"

Chlamydia infection, but not mycoplasmas, was parodoxically more frequent in the apparently normal than oligotetratoasthenozoospermia patients. Mycoplasmas male infection, but not chlamydia, was more frequent in cases with female, mechanical, and/or organic infertility factors. Infection was unrelated to the accessory gland evaluation or sperm variables. However, seminal antisperm antibody activity was significantly increased in cases with any positive culture. By this local antibody increase, chlamydia and mycoplasmas may significantly reduce sperm egg penetration ability.\r"

Progressive motility and the total progressively motile sperm count were reduced and averaged 25% and 27 million, respectively. Approximately 50% of the patients had positive titers of sperm agglutinating and/or sperm immobilizing antibodies. Sperm morphology indicated tail and head shape defects with increases in both tapered and immature sperm. A fertility score combining several sperm parameters averaged only 37% of normal. All of these values remained constant with time after reversal except for progressive motility (increased), oval head shapes (increased), and tapered sperm (decreased). This study has demonstrated that characteristic defects occur in sperm (decreased). This study has demonstrated that characteristic defects occur in sperm motility, sperm membrane function and morphology, in addition to specimen fertility scores, after a vasectomy reversal and need to be taken into consideration when advising and treating these patients for subsequent fertility difficulties.\r"

  ".W": "The inherent strengths from which family medicine can gain power in the academic medical center include the following. 1. Family medicine is the ambulatory primary care discipline. Consider increasing your capabilities of teaching in ambulatory settings. With the changing nature of the hospital patient population, it is becoming increasingly difficult to find a non-seriously ill patient who is alert and cooperative for simple teaching programs such as basic history taking and physical diagnosis. One can recruit more practicing family physicians as part-time faculty. In some medical schools the Introduction to Clinical Medicine field experience is in the office of practicing physicians. One might consider assuming responsibility for a neighborhood health center, particularly if this is a designated U.S. Public Health Service Corps Site. There would be an advantage to having students experience firsthand this mechanism of financing the medical education of primary care physicians. One might consider developing a purely private teaching practice. One could take a university faculty salary and divide it among three or four people in a group practice. This would compensate for the extra time it takes to have students and/or residents seeing patients in private offices. 2. Graduates of family practice residency programs comprise the major primary care referral base for open staff hospitals. Energies devoted to recruiting residency graduates to use our teaching hospitals will be well spent. Imaginative joint ventures between the hospital and the departments and/or graduates would help these recruiting efforts. The gradual increase in this primary care referral base over several years would greatly strengthen the position of family medicine within the academic medical center.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Unemployment, less than high school education, high usage of inpatient and outpatient services, complaints of nervousness or of a functional nature, and chronic illness were shown by univariate and multiple regression analyses to be associated with BDI scores in the depressed range. Nearly half of patients with certain combinations of risk factors (eg, less than high school education and functional complaint) scored in the depressed range. The reason for the visit, as stated by the patient, only rarely provided a reason to suspect depression. Whether or not clinicians decide to use a depression screening test, the presence of these demographic and clinical factors should prompt a search for depression. Educational efforts to improve recognition of depression in primary care should focus on awareness of clinical and demographic factors rather than on stereotypic, but rare presentations of depression.\r"

The study employed a pretest-post-test design strengthened by the use of a no-intervention comparison practice and repeated pretest measures of vaccine coverage. Outcome was measured by clinical records review. The influenza vaccination rate increased by 165% from 10.1% to 26.8% following introduction of the computer-generated reminders. There was no increase in influenza immunization in the comparison practice during the corresponding time period. Over 60% of eligible patients were seen in the practice during the pre-influenza season; 41.6% of those received influenza vaccinations.\r"

The clinical interview distinguished cases from controls both in terms of individual relationships and behavior of the family as a whole. The PAFS-Q also distinguished cases from controls, showing significantly more dysfunction for the cases on five of its eight subscales. These two methods overlap in the content areas of intimacy and individuation, with correlation coefficients between the two methodologies ranging from 0.45 to 0.79. The authors conclude that the families of patients with somatization disorder are different than their unaffected counterparts.\r"

  ".W": "Conceptualizing medical education as a family system facilitates recognition of the dynamics within the system which perpetuate many of the problems facing teachers, students, and practicing physicians. Neglectful and abusive families are often characterized by their unrealistic expectations, denial, indirect communication patterns, rigidity, and isolation. The medical education system has similar patterns of behavior that contribute to problems at all levels of the training process and include practicing physicians. The communication patterns within the teaching hospital reinforce trainees' strivings for perfectionism and devalue the contributions of nonphysician staff to the supervision of the physician-in-training. Excluding the potentially healing influence of \"outsiders\" contributes to the rigidity within the system. Like parents who raise their children as they themselves were raised, each generation teaches as they were taught, and the patterns are loyally perpetuated. Teachers will need to address their own training experiences, acknowledging the dysfunctional behavior patterns learned and the pain those behaviors cause. Then educators can begin to change how they teach and break the cycle of physical neglect and emotional abuse that has been inherited.\r"

Altogether 54 infections were identified serologically, of which 23 (42.6%) were associated with exacerbations. This corresponded to 24.2% of the recorded exacerbations during the study period. The respiratory pathogens accounted for 59.3% of the infections and 43.8% of these were associated with gastrointestinal symptoms. This is consistent with the observation that up to 40% of the exacerbations were associated with symptoms of antecedent or concurrent infection, most commonly involving the respiratory tract. Rubella virus, Epstein-Barr virus, and adenovirus were associated with acute exacerbations in 5 children. Thus, common pathogens were frequently associated with exacerbations and account for a large proportion of the commonly reported symptoms of a concurrent infection. The possible causal relationship between these pathogens and exacerbation of inflammatory bowel disease is discussed. Reactivation of latent herpesviruses was identified in 4 children with active disease and indicates that the converse relationship may also occur.\r"

  ".W": "Abnormal activity of dopamine, serotonin, and norepinephrine may contribute to the pathophysiology of duodenal ulcers. We therefore studied the effects of neuropharmacological manipulations on 1-methly-4-phenyl-1,2,5,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced duodenal ulcers. Duodenal ulcers were produced in rats by 12 subcutaneous injections of a neurotoxin, MPTP, over 4 days. At an MPTP dose of 20 mg.kg. injection, duodenal ulcers developed in 91% (43 of 47) of animals with low mortality. When neuropharmacological agents were preadministered before MPTP, the following effects on duodenal ulcers incidence were obtained. MAO-B inhibitors (pargyline [55%], deprenyl [43%]) but not MAO-A inhibitors (clorgyline [91%]) significantly decreased the frequency of duodenal ulcers suggesting that, like MPTP-induced parkinsonism, formation of a toxic metabolite, probably 1-methyl-4-phenyl-pyridinium is involved. Reuptake blockers for serotonin (fluoxetine [18%], indalpine [25%]) also decreased the frequency of duodenal ulcers. Reuptake blockers for norepinephrine (desmethylimipramine [17%], tomoxepine [31%], but not amfonelic acid [82%]) decreased the frequency of duodenal ulcers. Reuptake blockers for dopamine (benztropine [73%], amfonelic acid [82%], GBR-12909 [80%]) did not protect against duodenal ulcers. However, GBR-12909 significantly decreased the severity of those duodenal ulcers that were produced. These data suggest that abnormally low levels of synaptic transmission in serotonergic and possibly noradrenergic neurons play an important role in the pathogenesis of duodenal ulcer while the role of dopamine may be limited to modulation of ulcer severity.\r"

The gut was acutely inflamed at days 7 and 10 when net secretion of Na+ and Cl- ions was evident. Serum levels of rat mast cell protease II were elevated, providing evidence for mast cell activation. In addition, the magnitude of the short-circuit current responses to electrical transmural stimulation of enteric nerves (but not to histamine in the presence of neural blockade) were significantly reduced (p less than 0.01) to 17%-33% of control values, suggesting abnormalities of mucosal nerves. Following worm expulsion, serum levels of rat mast cell protease II and ion transport returned to normal. However, mastocytosis was apparent in gut mucosa and parasite antigen stimulated net secretion. In the absence of antigen, short-circuit current responses to nerve stimulation were increased (to 122% of controls; p less than 0.05). These findings suggest that changes in mast cells and enteric nerves occur during inflammation in this model and implicate neural and mast cell interactions with the epithelium in producing the ion-transport abnormalities.\r"

  ".W": "The infusion of triglyceride emulsions into the terminal ileum in concentrations that approximate those found in malabsorption results in the slowing of gastric emptying. The aim of this study was to characterize the changes in gastroduodenal motility responsible for this effect. Antropyloroduodenal pressures in 8 healthy volunteers were recorded with a manometric assembly incorporating a sleeve sensor across the pylorus and side holes in the antrum and duodenum. Each subject ingested a 100-g, 99m Tc-labeled solid meal; when approximately 25% of the meal had emptied from the stomach, a triglyceride emulsion (20% Intralipid) was infused into the terminal ileum at 1 ml/min for 45 min. Gastric emptying slowed markedly 15-30 min after the start of the lipid infusion (p = 0.01), and there was retrograde movement of the solid meal from the distal to the proximal portion of the stomach. During lipid infusion, there was a decrease in antral (p = 0.01), duodenal (p less than 0.05), and propagated antropyloroduodenal pressure waves (p less than 0.05) and an increase in isolated pyloric pressure waves (p less than 0.05). The rate of gastric emptying correlated with antral pressure waves (r = 0.92, p less than 0.001), duodenal pressure waves (r = 0.80, p less than 0.01), and propagated pressure waves (r = 0.88, p = 0.0025) and correlated inversely with the number of isolated pyloric pressure waves (r = -0.60, p = 0.05). The changes in antral, pyloric, and duodenal motility and the intragastric redistribution of a solid meal associated with ileal lipid infusion are likely to contribute to the delay in gastric emptying caused by this stimulus.\r"

Receptor numbers were quantitated by transferrin binding to preparations of basolateral or brush-border membranes. Receptors were demonstrated on the basolateral membranes of the gut cells, but not on the brush-border fraction. Apotransferrin demonstrated little binding to basolateral membranes at physiological pH. Dietary or parenteral iron loading of animals produced a significant decline in transferrin binding, whereas binding was increased in iron deficiency. These data were confirmed by immunohistochemical studies using a monoclonal antibody to the transferrin receptor. When iron absorption was increased threefold following acute hemolysis and without a decrease in body iron stores, there was no change in transferrin receptor number. These data indicate that intestinal transferrin receptors may be regulated by body iron stores but suggest that they are not directly involved in iron absorption.\r"

Fish oil feeding had no significant effect on mucosal prostaglandin E2 or F2 alpha content or on the damaging effect of aspirin on the stomach, despite the fact that fish oil reduced serum triglyceride concentrations significantly. These studies indicate that the damaging effects of aspirin on the gastric mucosa are not influenced by dietary fish oil.\r"

  ".W": "An iodoplatinate technique that selectively stains phospholipid was used to evaluate morphologically the effects of aspirin and 16,16-dimethyl prostaglandin E2 on canine gastric mucosa in an in vitro Ussing chamber system. The association between these morphological alterations and the changes in mucosal surface hydrophobicity as determined by contact angle analysis was also investigated. Prostaglandin (1 microgram/ml) did not alter aspirin-induced cell injury, although it reduced (45%) the detachment of damaged cells from the lamina propria. Mucus release appeared to be stimulated independently both by aspirin and prostaglandin treatment and by the blotting and drying procedure routinely performed before contact angle analysis. When an extracellular mucus gel coat was present, it contained numerous iodoplatinate-reactive vesicles and myelinated or lamellated structures. Iodoplatinate-reactive substances also appeared at the luminal surface of the mucus gel as a filamentous band. This band of reactivity was frequently seen after simultaneous treatment with prostaglandin and aspirin but only sporadically observed after aspirin treatment alone. The hydrophobic nature of the canine gastric mucosa under the above experimental conditions correlated well (r = 0.743, p less than 0.005) with the percentage of mucosal surface covered by this filamentous band, and less so with the density of iodoplatinate-reactive structures within the mucus gel. We conclude that phospholipid structures in the mucus gel may account for the hydrophobic nature of the gastric mucosal surface and the ability of damaging and \"cytoprotective\" agents to influence both surface wettability and barrier integrity.\r"

Eleven of the resulting 227 hybridomas secreted immunoglobulin G capable of binding to intrinsic factor-cobalamin complex. Cloning by limiting dilution gave 6 clones secreting anti-intrinsic factor antibodies that bound human intrinsic factor-cobalamin complex with affinities of 13-116 nM; 3 antibodies also bound rabbit intrinsic factor-cobalamin complex. Five antibodies inhibited to some degree the binding of cobalamin by intrinsic factor, and 2 also prevented attachment of intrinsic factor-cobalamin complex to guinea pig ileal receptors. Anti-rabbit intrinsic factor antibodies specifically precipitated a peptide of molecular weight 53,000, corresponding to the molecular weight of rabbit intrinsic factor from homogenates of rabbit gastric mucosal explants biosynthetically labeled with [35S]methionine and from culture medium in which the explants were incubated. Indirect fluorescence immunocytochemistry with the antibodies in human and rabbit gastric mucosal sections showed intense selective staining of parietal cells. These results (a) document species differences between human and rabbit intrinsic factors not previously demonstrable with polyclonal anti-intrinsic factor sera; (b) confirm earlier evidence that cobalamin binding and receptor functions occur at separate sites in intrinsic factor; and (c) provide a useful approach to studying structure-function relations of the intrinsic function molecule.\r"

Therefore, 20 subjects (4 normal; 13 diffuse spasm; 3 other motility disorders) were studied using synchronous manometry and videofluoroscopy with alternate 5-ml and 10-ml barium swallows. A total of 181 swallows were analyzed. Concordance between manometry and fluoroscopy was excellent for individual swallows (98%), groups of 5 swallows (97%), and final diagnoses (90%). Contraction onset intervals less than 0.8 s apart over 5 cm (velocity greater than 6.25 cm/s) were critical in determining abnormal bolus transit (98% sensitivity and positive predictive value). Radiologically, segmental tertiary activity (complete luminal obliteration) was always associated with disrupted primary peristalsis, but nonsegmental tertiary activity was often seen with normal bolus transit and did not have a specific manometric correlate. Four patterns of interrupted peristalsis radiologically were found--segmental tertiary contractions, a generalized esophageal contraction, absence of motor activity, or discoordinated \"to-and-fro\" movement. Surprisingly, nearly complete barium clearance occurred by the first two mechanisms in two thirds of swallows. Thus, the authors believe radiology and manometry are both excellent studies for identifying abnormal esophageal peristalsis. In difficult cases, these tests give complementary information because radiology assesses bolus movement while manometry provides quantitative pressure data.\r"

To determine if an equivalent response occurs with individual components of a mixed meal, somatostatin-28 and prosomatostatin, somatostatin-14, and somatostatin-13, in combination, were measured in healthy men before and after intake of (a) a mixed meal (715 kcal), (b) carbohydrate (100 g equivalent glucose), (c) protein (22 and 45 g), and (d) fat (25 and 50 g). After the mixed meal, somatostatin-28 levels doubled within 120 min and gradually declined by 4 h. With carbohydrate, somatostatin-28 levels were unaltered. After 22 and 45 g of protein, somatostatin-28 increased equivalently within 60 min, representing 30% of the amount with the mixed meal. With 25 g fat, a somatostatin-28 increase similar to that with the meal was seen; this response was doubled with 50 g fat. No changes in prosomatostatin, somatostatin-14, or somatostatin-13 were observed with the mixed meal or with the separate macronutrients. The authors conclude that fat is the major stimulus for somatostatin-28 secretion in humans and hypothesize that somatostatin-28 is an inhibitor of the endocrine and exocrine pancreas during nutrient absorption.\r"

In addition, the ability of peripheral blood mononuclear cells of 23 of these patients to generate soluble interleukin-2 receptor following mitogenic stimulation was studied in vitro. Serum soluble interleukin-2 receptor concentrations of patients with active Crohn's disease (n = 19) were significantly elevated (757 +/- 438 U/ml) compared with levels in patients with inactive disease (n = 10; 412 +/- 120 U/ml) and healthy control individuals (n = 40; 375 +/- 102 U/ml; p less than 0.003 and p less than 0.0005, respectively). Serial determinations of serum soluble interleukin-2 receptor concentration in a follow-up of 11 hospitalized patients treated for highly active disease showed a decrease from 1252 +/- 494 U/ml to 527 +/- 193 U/ml (p less than 0.004) that corresponded to clinical improvement, as assessed by Crohn's disease activity index and a reduction of inflammatory parameters. In vitro phytohemagglutinin stimulation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells derived from patients with Crohn's disease resulted in elevated soluble interleukin-2 receptor production not only in patients with active disease (3987 +/- 2439 U/ml), but also in patients with inactive disease (3297 +/- 2282 U/ml), compared with the amount of soluble interleukin-2 receptor produced by mononuclear cells of healthy individuals (1523 +/- 1152 U/ml; p less than 0.005 and p less than 0.02, respectively). In addition, cultivation of mononuclear cells without mitogen resulted in higher soluble interleukin-2 receptor production in patients with active disease than in patients with inactive disease (p less than 0.02). However, patients suffering from active ulcerative colitis also had significantly increased serum levels of soluble interleukin-2 receptor (1080 +/- 400 U/ml) compared with the levels in patients with chronic disease (455 +/- 140 U/ml; p less than 0.0025). In addition, peripheral blood mononuclear cells derived from patients with ulcerative colitis produced significantly more soluble interleukin-2 receptor upon mitogenic stimulation with phytohemagglutinin (2314 +/- 936 U/ml), than cells from healthy controls (1523 +/- 1152 U/ml; p less than 0.05). The finding of elevated soluble interleukin-2 receptor serum levels in patients with active Crohn's disease and its increased production by mononuclear cells of patients with both active and inactive disease is a further example of an alteration of the immune system in this condition; however, this alteration can also be found in other inflammatory bowel diseases.\r"

  ".W": "We prospectively evaluated gastric acid output (mEq/h), gastric volume output (ml/h), ambulatory 24-h esophageal pH monitoring, and the endoscopic appearance of the esophagus in 23 patients undergoing treatment of chronic long-standing pyrosis. Twelve of these 23 individuals (52%) remained symptomatic after 3 mo of standard antisecretory treatment with ranitidine, 150 mg twice daily. When compared with initial responders, those patients who did not experience complete symptomatic relief on therapy had significantly higher basal acid output (p less than 0.001), basal volume output (p less than 0.02), and basal upright (but not supine) reflux time (p less than 0.05). Nine of the 12 patients who did not respond to initial treatment had gastric acid hypersecretion (basal acid output greater than 10 mEq/h), and 10 of the 12 had Barrett's epithelium compared with only 1 patient in the initial-responder group (p less than 0.001). All 12 nonresponders were treated for an additional 3 mo with increased doses of ranitidine (mean, 1280 mg/day; range, 600-1800 mg/day), and complete disappearance of pyrosis occurred in 10 of the 12, although no significant endoscopic regression was observed in the extent of the underlying columnar mucosa in those with Barrett's esophagus over the 6-mo duration of the study. A significant correlation was shown between the daily ranitidine dose required to eliminate symptoms and the pretreatment basal acid output (r = 0.81, p less than 0.001); gastric acid output had to be almost totally suppressed (i.e., less than 1 mEq/h) for pyrosis to disappear completely. No side effects occurred with any of these high doses of ranitidine. We conclude that a subgroup of patients with long-standing symptomatic gastroesophageal reflux disease who do not respond to standard ulcer-healing doses of histamine2-receptor antagonists are hypersecretors of basal gastric acid and require increased acid-suppressive therapy. Many of these individuals also have underlying Barrett's epithelium.\r"

  ".W": "Cerebral evoked potentials provide a technique for evaluation of central nervous processing of information derived from a variety of sensory modalities. Evoked potentials associated with balloon distention of the smooth muscle esophagus were studied in 14 adult volunteers. Stimulation was applied via repeated inflation and deflation of a balloon attached to a pressure pump that cycled at 0.2 Hz. Cortical electrical responses were recorded from scalp electrodes at Cz, Cz', and Pz of the international 10-20 System for electroencephalographic recording. The recording electrodes were referenced to Fpz and averaged over a 1-s period for 100 repetitions. Latencies, amplitudes, and waveforms of the evoked potentials were compared with controls consisting of pump on/balloon detached, auditory masking, and conventional somatosensory posterior tibial nerve stimulation. Polyphasic evoked potentials were obtained in all subjects, and maximum positive deflections occurring with latencies of 202-396 ms. Maximal amplitudes ranged from 2.5-8.3 microV. Latencies and amplitudes of the evoked responses were highly reproducible in each subject with considerable variation among subjects. Conclusions: (a) Reproducible evoked potentials with distinctive waveforms can be recorded in response to esophageal balloon distention in humans; (2) long latency of the evoked potentials suggests involvement of nonmyelinated visceral afferent pathways; (3) the evoked potentials are probably specific to mechanical stimulation rather than being nonspecific arousal responses; and (4) the results support this as a promising new method for investigation of the neurobiology of gastrointestinal sensation in humans that may help clarify pathological conditions of the irritable esophagus syndrome and esophagus-related chest pain.\r"

Scatchard analysis of binding data obtained with 125I-insulinlike growth factor I showed an insulinlike growth factor I receptor with a dissociation constant of 8.6 nM and a binding capacity of 0.8 pmol/mg membrane protein. Distinct insulinlike growth factor II receptors labeled with 125I-insulinlike growth factor II were also found with a dissociation constant of 6.9 nM and a binding capacity of 4.7 pmol/mg membrane protein. Two sets of observations make it possible to discriminate between the two types of insulinlike growth factor receptors. (a) Unlabeled insulinlike growth factor I was 3 times more potent than insulinlike growth factor II in inhibiting [125I] insulinlike growth factor I binding. Conversely, unlabeled insulinlike growth factor II was 10 times more potent than insulinlike growth factor I in competing with 125I-insulinlike growth factor II for binding to membranes. Insulin and proinsulin did not compete with either of the tracers. (b) Affinity labeling of membranes followed by sodium dodecylsulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under reducing conditions, revealed a radio-ligand-receptor complex of molecular weight 130,000 and 250,000 using 125I-insulinlike growth factor I and 125I-insulinlike growth factor II, respectively. These observations indicate that adult human colonic epithelium is abundantly equipped with two sets of receptors that recognize preferentially either insulinlike growth factor I or insulinlike growth factor II.\r"

Within a 10-year period, early gastric cancer was diagnosed in 51 outpatients and advanced gastric cancer in 190 patients, amounting to a 21.2% incidence of early gastric cancer. Patients with early gastric cancer had an age distribution and clinical presentation similar to those of patients with benign gastric ulcers (589) but markedly different from those in patients with advanced cancer. Histological types and tumor locations were comparable in patients with early and advanced gastric cancer, indicating a close relationship between the two neoplasms. Patients with early gastric cancer had markedly higher 5-yr survival rates (83.4%) than those with advanced gastric cancer (14.5%) and did not differ in this regard from patients with benign gastric ulcers (82.9%). None of the 51 patients with early gastric cancer died of disseminated cancer. If survival rates were estimated for matched pairs with comparable age, sex, and length of follow-up, these data remained essentially unchanged (early gastric cancer: 83.4%, 95% confidence interval 73.2%-93.4%; gastric ulcer: 87.8%, 95% confidence interval 74.7%-94.3%). We conclude that early gastric cancer in European patients is comparable to early gastric cancer in Japan with regard to its morphology, clinical presentation, and curability. Early investigation of patients with significant gastrointestinal symptoms may improve the prognoses of patients with gastric cancer.\r"

Relative blood flow rate in various vessels of the portal system were measured percutaneously using an ultrasonic duplex system, while portal venous pressure was measured directly using a transducer. The superior mesenteric venous blood flow increased significantly as did the portal venous blood flow and pressure, though the degree of change of portal venous blood flow was less than was expected from the change of portal venous blood flow in the superior mesenteric venous blood flow. Splenic venous blood flow decreased significantly. This decrease is perhaps due to a mechanism that acts to compensate for the increase induced in the superior mesenteric venous blood flow to maintain portal flow at approximately the same level. The measured changes suggest a relationship between splenic and intestinal blood flows that is regulated according to the hepatic circulatory condition. The regulatory mechanism should be considered when designing the treatment of portal hypertension.\r"

Seventy-two patients had a liver resection. One- and 3-yr survival rates were 68% and 51%, respectively. Survival rate was significantly higher in Child's/Pugh's class A than in class B-C patients. Patients with a thickly encapsulated tumor lived longer than those with an infiltrating tumor and had in addition a significantly lower incidence of cancer recurrence. Class A patients with a thickly encapsulated hepatocellular carcinoma had a 77% 3-year survival rate. There was no relation between the size of the tumor or the presence of symptoms and survival. These data suggest that good results can be achieved by resection of hepatocellular carcinomas in European cirrhotic patients. A thickly encapsulated tumor and an adequate liver function are the main determinants of low cancer recurrence and high survival. The clinical results in this series are similar to those reported from the Orient.\r"

This study attempted to identify persons in an early stage of stone formation, when there are crystals but no stones, and to determine the composition of bile under these conditions of reduced metastability. Two hundred twenty-seven patients were studied, 96 without gallstones. Twenty-three of 96 control patients had cholesterol crystals in their bile. Total protein concentration, total lipid concentration, and cholesterol saturation index were greater in control patients with crystals in bile. To determine whether or not cholesterol saturation index alone could account for the presence of crystals, control patients with cholesterol saturation index above the median value of 1.04 were studied. In this case there was no difference in cholesterol saturation index between the 19 crystal-positive (1.27) and 29 crystal-negative patients (1.26), but the difference in total protein and lipid concentrations persisted. Total protein and total lipid concentrations were even higher in crystal-positive sediments containing large numbers of crystals. Sludge seen by ultrasonography was more common in patients with crystal-positive sediments. High protein and lipid concentrations are associated with reduced metastability of bile.\r"

  ".W": "Transfer of the inhibitory neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid across the normal blood-brain barrier is minimal. One prerequisite for gamma-aminobutyric acid in plasma contributing to the neural inhibition of hepatic encephalopathy would be that increased transfer of gamma-aminobutyric acid across the blood-brain barrier occurs in liver failure. The aim of the present study was to determine if brain gamma-aminobutyric acid uptake is increased in rabbits with stage II-III (precoma) hepatic encephalopathy due to galactosamine-induced fulminant hepatic failure. A modification of the Oldendorf intracarotid artery-injection technique was applied. [3H] gamma-aminobutyric acid, [14C] butanol, and 113mIn-labeled serum protein (transferrin) were injected simultaneously 4 s before decapitation. The ipsilateral brain uptake index of gamma-aminobutyric acid was determined from measurements of the 3 isotopes in 5 brain regions. Uncorrected or simple brain uptake indices of [3H] gamma-aminobutyric acid and [113mIn] transferrin were calculated using [14C] butanol as the highly extracted reference compound. The [113mIn] transferrin data were also used to \"correct\" the brain uptake index of [3H] gamma-aminobutyric acid for intravascular retention of [3H] gamma-aminobutyric acid. The methodology adopted minimized problems attributable to rapid [3H] gamma-aminobutyric acid metabolism, and slow brain washout and recirculation of the radiolabeled tracers. Both the uncorrected and corrected brain uptake indices of gamma-aminobutyric acid as well as the simple brain uptake index of transferrin were significantly increased in both stage II and III hepatic encephalopathy in all brain regions studied. Moreover, these brain uptake indices were significantly greater in stage III hepatic encephalopathy than in stage II hepatic encephalopathy. These findings indicate that transfer of gamma-aminobutyric acid from plasma to brain extracellular fluid is increased in the model of hepatic encephalopathy studied; hence, they provide support for the hypothesis that plasma-derived gamma-aminobutyric acid may contribute to the neural inhibition of hepatic encephalopathy due to fulminant hepatic failure.\r"

The possibility that reflux of abnormal bile (rich in lipid peroxidation and other products generated through hepatic metabolism of xenobiotics) into the pancreatic duct may initiate pancreatic damage was negated when bile duct ligation and bile diversion did not abolish attacks of pancreatitis in 3 cases, although the evidence of reflux was indisputable in 1 of them who also had a pancreatoduodenectomy. Pancreatic acinar cells from that patient showed extensive microvesiculation, as did hepatocytes from each case. These observations suggest that pancreatic and liver damage in chronic pancreatitis proceed independently but by the same mechanism-heightened, but unmitigated, oxidative detoxification of xenobiotics by cytochromes P450. Therefore, although bile reflux is not a prerequisite, it could compound injury in the head of the gland. Antioxidants were prescribed to the 3 cases mentioned and, from the outset, to a fourth patient who showed the same liver changes. This unconventional approach has held attacks at bay during a follow-up period of 5 yr.\r"

Their hospital stays were prolonged, and the majority were being treated with multiple antibiotics or chemotherapeutic agents. Diarrhea often led to dehydration, prerenal azotemia, hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis, and electrolyte imbalance. Stool culture most frequently isolated Cand. albicans in association with decreased normal flora. Colonoscopy showed no evidence of colitis. Diagnosis was made based on the absence of diarrhea-producing medications, the continuation of diarrhea despite fasting, the exclusion of other infections, inflammatory conditions and other causes of secretory diarrhea, and a dramatic response to a short course of nystatin.\r"

Failed or inadequate antihypertensive therapy may be due to aging-related pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic changes, drug interactions, poor patient compliance, or poor communication between physician and patient. By understanding the reasons for therapeutic failure in hypertension, the primary care physician is in a position to remedy the problem. It is the uncommon patient whose blood pressure can not be controlled if the doctor is giving proper advice which the patient then follows.\r"

Chronic ethanol intake was associated with hyperpolarization of Vm and an enhanced galactose but not glucose transport. Acute ethanol and acetaldehyde were without effect on Vm whether or not galactose was present. We conclude that while a greater electrochemical gradient across the brush border membrane is a likely explanation for the stimulation of galactose absorption induced by ethanol feeding, factors other than changes in Vm are responsible for the inhibitory effects of acute ethanol.\r"

In both groups of patients gastric juice caused a marked increase in fibrinolysis as evidenced by a shortening of the euglobulin clot lysis time. This plasmin mediated fibrinolytic activity was found to be heat labile and only present in an acid environment. Addition of tranexamic acid or sucralfate to gastric juice almost completely reversed this effect, whereas pepstatin was only partially effective. It is probable that acid dependent proteases other than pepsin are responsible for the marked fibrinolysis. The ulcer healing agent sucralfate might be useful in those patients at risk of bleeding or rebleeding from active peptic ulcer disease.\r"

  ".W": "A multi-channel small diameter tube was used to study the secretion of bicarbonate by 3 cm long segments of the proximal duodenum isolated between balloons. The tube had an outer diameter of 5.3 mm and two central and four smaller, peripheral channels. Measurements of infused phenol red, 14C-PEG and vitamin B12 and of trypsin activity were performed to rule out contamination of the perfusate by gastric and pancreatic secretions. Basal secretion of bicarbonate by the duodenal mucosa in healthy subjects varied between 135 and 220 mumol/cm of intestine per hour. Perfusion of the lumen with acid (100 mM HCl for five minutes) increased the secretion to greater than 400 mumol/cm/h and the alpha 2-adrenoreceptor agonist clonidine (150 micrograms iv) decreased the HCO3- secretion by 70 mumol/cm/h. Clonidine simultaneously reduced the mean arterial blood pressure and plasma noradrenaline concentration, but did not affect the plasma glucose or adrenaline concentration. Duodenal bicarbonate secretion is important in the protection of this mucosa against acid discharged from the stomach. Increased sympathetic activity may, by inhibiting the bicarbonate secretion, decrease the protection in proximal duodenum in man and facilitate ulceration.\r"

  ".W": "After colectomy, continent ileal reservoirs are an accepted alternative to conventional ileostomy for patients with ulcerative colitis. To assess the effect of these reservoirs on digestive function, circulating and morphologic gut endocrine responses were measured in patients with a continent ileostomy or with a pelvic pouch and compared to patients with conventional ileostomy, with active ulcerative colitis and healthy controls. Eight subjects were studied in each group. Basal and postprandial plasma gastrin, enteroglucagon, neurotensin, vasoactive intestinal polypeptide, insulin, pancreatic glucagon, and pancreatic polypeptide in both groups with ileal reservoirs were equivalent to controls. Basal plasma motilin and postprandial plasma gastric inhibitory polypeptide were raised in ileal reservoir patients, but similar changes also occurred in ulcerative colitis patients and those with conventional ileostomy. In one half of patients, cell populations of enteroglucagon, peptide YY, and neurotensin were decreased in pouch mucosa that corresponded with the presence of mucosal inflammation. On the other hand, with pouch inflammation vasoactive intestinal polypeptide immunoreactive nerves were increased and a proportion of the fibres were moderately coarsened. Mucosal concentrations of vasoactive intestinal polypeptide did not, however, exceed that of controls. After an ileal reservoir sufficient reserve remains for gut hormone release into the circulation, suggesting compensation for the presence of a reservoir and the absence of a colon; circulating hormone changes do occur but are consequent upon previous ulcerative colitis. Reservoirs may show neuromorphologic alterations that appear to be related to mucosal inflammation.\r"

  ".W": "In seven patients with longstanding ulcerative colitis, multiple mucosal biopsies taken at colonoscopy were assessed for DNA content and histological dysplasia. DNA analyses were performed using flow cytometric analyses in biopsies and microspectrophotometry in imprint slides prepared from the biopsies. Abnormal aneuploid DNA content was detected in five of the patients in eight separate locations in the colon. There was good conformity between the two methods in the detection of aneuploidy. Both methods of DNA analysis are considered to be applicable in mucosal biopsies from patients with ulcerative colitis. In two patients with significant low grade dysplasia in association with macroscopical lesions (DALMs), there was a relationship with aneuploid DNA pattern found by flow cytometric or microspectrophotometric analyses. Indefinite changes, probably dysplastic were found in three other patients and two of those also displayed aneuploidy, although only once in the same biopsy location. In five locations aneuploidy was detected without concomitant dysplasia. DNA-aneuploidy seems therefore to appear earlier than dysplasia and may be an early marker of malignant transformation of the mucosa in ulcerative colitis. Prospective trials are needed before the clinical significance of early findings of aneuploidy can be determined.\r"

Normality was shown to encompass radiological features often considered pathological. These features included broad ranges of anorectal angle and pelvic floor descent which overlap with reported pathological states. Furthermore, the formation of rectocoeles during defecation was a very common finding in women. Finally, a subgroup of the volunteers had marginal anorectal function. The marginal anorectal function and certain radiological findings such as rectocoeles or intussusceptions may predispose to later problems, or contribute to clinical problems when combined with other factors such as dietary fibre deficiency. The radiological findings raise a number of questions with respect to different aspects of the functioning of the continence and defecation mechanisms.\r"

Cholesterol precursors, squalene and Methylated sterols which reflect the activity of cholesterol synthesis were also measured. Pairwise intraclass correlations were determined for monozygotic and dizygotic twin pairs and heritability estimates were calculated. Molar % of biliary cholesterol and percentage distribution of biliary cholic acid and particularly deoxycholic acid showed significant pairwise correlations within the monozygotic but not the dizygotic pairs. Similar correlations were found for total biliary methylsterols and of the methylsterol subfractions for the two methostenols but not for squalene, lanosterol and dimethylsterols. In serum, the precursor sterols, but not squalene, showed even higher pairwise correlations in the monozygotic twins than the corresponding precursors in bile. Molar per cent of bile acids and phospholipids and cholesterol saturation index were not correlated significantly in either twin pairs, but the pairwise correlations tended to be higher in the monozygotic than in the dizygotic pairs. Gall stones were found in seven monozygotic and three dizygotic subjects. Two monozygotic twin pairs were concordant for gall stones; all the dizygotic pairs were discordant. Overall, these data suggest that molar percentage of biliary cholesterol, bile acid composition, cholesterol synthesis, bile cholesterol saturation, and gall stone formation may be under a significant genetic control.\r"

Multiple regression and discriminant analysis were utilised for 101 patients. Stepwise regression among the 12 variables explained only 54% of the variability existing between bleeders and non-bleeders. Six of the 12 variables accounted for 51% of the total bleeder/non-bleeder variability. A predicting equation was evolved [Yp = -0.60 + 0.19 X1 (colour of varices) + 0.16 X2 (cherry red spots) + 0.03 X3 (red wale, markings) + 0.01 X4 (haematocystic spots) + 0.15 X5 (Conn's grading of variceal size) + 0.03 X6 (intravariceal pressure)]. Of the six variables used, variceal size indicated 35%, and intravariceal pressure accounted for 12%, of the explained variability between bleeders and non-bleeders. The presence of the three red colour signs and the colour of the varices accounted for only 3% and 1% respectively of the total explained variation. Using the discriminant function analysis, we were able to correctly identify 85% of the bleeders and 81% of the non-bleeders. Additional studies are required to detect the variables responsible for the unexplained variability (46%) between bleeders and non-bleeders.\r"

This study investigated the hypothesis that vasopressin acts at the rostral ventrolateral medulla to increase arterial pressure. The rostral pressor area of the medulla oblongata was exposed in urethane-anesthetized rats prepared for topical application of vasopressin. A 3-minute application of vasopressin (range 10(-8) to 10(-3) M) produced dose-dependent increases in arterial pressure that averaged between 2 +/- 1 and 65 +/- 11 mm Hg (p less than 0.01). Tachycardia was not a consistent response at any concentration of vasopressin. Intravenous administration of a V1 vasopressin antagonist did not modify the pressor response produced by topical application of vasopressin (10(-4) M). Application of the V1 antagonist to the rostral pressor area, however, prevented the production of a pressor effect to subsequent topical application of vasopressin (10(-4) M). These experiments suggest that vasopressin stimulates the activity of vasomotor neurons in the rostral ventrolateral medulla by a mechanism that involves a neuronal V1 receptor.\r"

Both uninephrectomy and a high sodium diet are necessary, however, to induce DOC hypertension. Considering the inability of the developing kidney to adequately excrete a sodium load, we studied the possibility that DOC alone might induce hypertension when treatment is initiated in rats at the age of 21 days. The contribution of volume expansion as a factor mediating the pressor response to DOC was assessed in rats given a high sodium diet instead of DOC. Systolic blood pressure increased in DOC-treated rats within 3 weeks. Although systolic blood pressure also increased in rats on a high sodium diet, the increase was transient and of a lesser magnitude than that observed in DOC-treated rats. The rise in blood pressure in both groups of rats was associated with suppression of plasma renin activity and aldosterone concentration. Furthermore, extracellular fluid volume was similarly increased in DOC-treated rats and rats given a high sodium diet. Consistent with these data, DOC-treated rats showed an exaggerated natriuretic response to acute saline loading as compared with a vehicle-treated control group. Discontinuation of DOC treatment after 5 weeks led to normalization of all variables studied including blood pressure. Yet, when DOC was continued for 8 weeks, stopping treatment did not lower blood pressure despite normalization of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and the natriuretic response to saline loading. In contrast, discontinuation of the high sodium diet after 8 weeks normalized blood pressure.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In male dogs, angiotensin II induced parallel pressor (30%) and dipsogenic responses (70%), whereas no hypertension and no increase in fluid intake were observed in females. In contrast, the activity of the Na+-K+ pump as assessed by 86Rb uptake was independent of gender.

We found that, despite having 10-fold higher levels of circulating catecholamines, pheochromocytoma patients have hemodynamic characteristics similar to patients with essential hypertension and that, in individual patients, the ratio of circulating norepinephrine to epinephrine had no relation to the hemodynamic profile. In both groups, increased total peripheral resistance is primarily responsible for maintenance of hypertension. These results suggest that, unlike the acute administration of catecholamines, long-term exposure to high levels of circulating catecholamines does not produce hemodynamic responses characteristic of this group of compounds. This might be due in part to desensitization of the cardiovascular system to catecholamines and might explain the clinical observation that some patients can be completely asymptomatic despite harboring an actively catecholamine-secreting pheochromocytoma.\r"

One and 5 hours after unclipping the renal artery, the mean blood pressure decreased markedly (from 195 +/- 7 to 124 +/- 8 and 145 +/- 9 mm Hg, respectively), whereas the hyperreactivity to bradykinin reverted only slightly, and the responses to nitroprusside remained unchanged. In another group of hypertensive rats examined 8 hours after unclipping (pressure decreased from 192 +/- 4 to 143 +/- 8 mm Hg), the hyperreactivity to bradykinin had partially reverted. Significantly larger doses of bradykinin were necessary to produce the same decrease in blood pressure when compared with the control period (16.4 +/- 2.0 vs. 7.2 +/- 1.2 ng). The same degree of reversal of hyperreactivity to bradykinin was observed when the blood pressure of hypertensive rats was reduced (from 207 +/- 8 to 143 +/- 5 mm Hg) during 1 hour by hydralazine injection.

Seventeen (group 1) of 25 mild hypertensive patients, nonresponders to a 3-month low sodium diet (2 g/day), were admitted into a physical training program consisting of three weekly sessions of aerobics (20 minutes), bicycling at prefixed loads (20 minutes), and induced muscular relaxation (10 minutes). They were compared with 15 mild hypertensive patients (group 2), nonresponders to the low sodium diet who remained untrained. The follow-up lasted 15.7 +/- 5.8 months. There were significant blood pressure decreases in group 1 at rest (155 +/- 9.8/101 +/- 3.3 vs. 136 +/- 8.1/86 +/- 6.6 mm Hg, p less than 0.001) and at maximal effort (219 +/- 27.4/119 +/- 14.4 vs. 196 +/- 21.8/101 +/- 10.5 mm Hg, p less than 0.001). Maximal work capacity increased from 758.8 +/- 256.7 to 944.1 +/- 203.8 kpm (p less than 0.001). Echocardiographic left ventricular mass index tended to decrease (137.8 +/- 36.3 vs. 125.4 +/- 29.9 g/m2, p = NS), without any significant modification of either left ventricular volume index or left ventricular shortening fraction. No significant changes occurred in group 2. There was no correlation between blood pressure and left ventricular mass changes and left ventricular shortening fraction and left ventricular mass index changes. According to these results, it seems prudent to prescribe physical training to mild hypertensive patients because it does not induce left ventricular mass increases.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Previous studies indicate that factors other than blood pressure can influence cardiac hypertrophy. In the present experiments, we evaluated the effects of different sodium diets in the two-kidney, one clip hypertension model in the rat. After the renal artery had been clipped, the rats received a normal sodium (177 meq/kg), high sodium (517 meq/kg), and low sodium (7 meq/kg) diet during 4 weeks. The final blood pressure was almost the same in the three groups (normal sodium 170 +/- 12 mm Hg; low sodium 168 +/- 4 mm Hg; and high sodium 162 +/- 7 mm Hg). Sodium restriction significantly reduced the development of cardiac hypertrophy as compared with rats on normal or high sodium diets. Thus, ventricular weight and ventricular weight/body weight ratio were significantly higher in rats subjected to a normal or high sodium diet (p less than 0.01). The hypertrophied hearts of rats on normal and high sodium diets showed a larger increase in the number of cardiac beta-adrenergic receptors than those observed in hearts from low sodium diet, clipped rats. These results show that sodium modulates the development of cardiac hypertrophy in two-kidney, one clip hypertensive rats. Similarly, the cardiac beta-adrenergic receptors appear to be influenced by dietary sodium intake. A possible role of the sympathetic nervous system is suggested.\r"

  ".W": "Angiotensin II has been reported to have both a positive inotropic effect and a coronary constrictor action in the hamster heart. To study the contribution to these responses of phenylalanine in position 8, we assessed the direct cardiac effects of angiotensin-(1-7), which lacks phenylalanine in position 8. Syrian hamsters were used to determine the effects of angiotensin-(1-7) on cardiac performance in the diseased and normal hearts. We used the isolated isovolumic heart preparation perfused either at a constant pressure of 50 mm Hg or at a constant coronary (myocardial) flow rate of 7 ml/min (seven cardiomyopathic hamsters [CMH] and seven normal hamsters [NH] in each subgroup). At constant perfusion pressure, coronary (myocardial) flow rate decreased (p less than 0.01) in both CMH and NH (-31 +/- 8% vs. -39 +/- 4% of baseline, respectively); but the percent decrease in left ventricular pressure and the first derivative of left ventricular pressure over time (LV + dP/dt) was significant only in NH (-8 +/- 1% and -9 +/- 4%) but not in CMH (-14 +/- 5% and -21 +/- 8%). On the other hand, at a constant coronary (myocardial) flow rate, left ventricular pressure and LV + dP/dt tended to increase in both CMH and NH (+10 +/- 3% and +6 +/- 2% of baseline vs. +7 +/- 7% and +7 +/- 5%, respectively) but these changes were not significant.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"
