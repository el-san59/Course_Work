  ".W": "This study investigated changes, over a one-year period, in medical and dental students' attitudes toward various issues related to contact with AIDS patients. In 1988 and 1989, the authors surveyed second- and third-year medical and dental students at one medical school both before and after they completed a year of required clinical training. The dental students remained consistently more anxious and more restrictive in their attitudes toward treating patients with AIDS than did their medical student counterparts, and became more conservative (fearful) in their attitudes after working with AIDS patients, whereas the medical students became more liberal. Overall, both groups were more concerned about contracting AIDS in their professional lives than in their personal lives. Over one-third of the medical students and two-thirds of the dental students indicated that they did not wish to train in a specialty or hospital with a high percentage of AIDS patients, and a substantial minority of the students in both groups did not feel that they were responsible for treating all patients whom they were qualified to treat. These and related results suggest that AIDS-related anxiety may influence students' career choices and behaviors and the quality of care patients receive. Suggestions for educational strategies to address students' fears--both warranted and unwarranted--and the differences in attitudes between students of different health-care professions are discussed.\r"

  ".U": "91054747\r", 
  ".W": "Following reports of concern among health-care workers regarding the occupational risk of infection with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), a symposium was designed in 1987 to demonstrate to health-care providers at three hospitals in The Bronx, New York, the low risk of occupational HIV infection and techniques for avoiding infection. After the symposium, 103 of the health-care providers who had attended it completed a questionnaire assessing the impact of the symposium on their attitudes; the responses from 100 of these providers were used in this study. Twenty-nine of the responding providers reported that the symposium had increased their concerns regarding their risk of HIV infection; this group was composed of seven of the 15 medical students who responded, 12 of the 36 housestaff, seven of the 28 faculty, and three of the 21 other medical staff. The findings of the present study suggest that a symposium designed to decrease concerns of occupational HIV infection among health-care workers may have the opposite effect on some of those who attend it, especially medical students. Education alone may be inadequate to reassure some providers. The authors recommend small-group sessions addressing the emotional aspects of health-care providers' concerns.\r"

Both the faculty and the students were found to be fearful of infection, had strong negative attitudes toward AIDS patients, and had low levels of confidence in the current knowledge about AIDS. Both cognitive and affective training strategies are recommended to help learners distinguish unwarranted from warranted fears of infection and to increase their empathy for patients with AIDS.\r"

These groups were also given a 31-item test of their knowledge of AIDS issues. Significant differences by levels of knowledge were obtained for eight of the 12 attitude items. For example, the more knowledgeable the student, the less likely he or she was to refuse treatment to an AIDS patient, to require mandatory AIDS testing of physicians, or to require medical personnel to wear gloves. The findings strongly suggest that education has an important role in changing attitudes about AIDS in a direction that fosters better health care for AIDS patients.\r"

Many health professionals also resist working with AIDS patients. This 1988 survey examined exaggerated risk estimates for HIV contagion in relationship to HIV-AIDS knowledge and resistance to working with AIDS patients among medical and nursing students at a large Northwestern teaching hospital. The results indicate that among the respondents, exaggerated risk estimates were associated both with a lack of HIV-AIDS knowledge and with greater resistance to working with AIDS patients. Results from multiple regression analyses revealed that (1) a lack of clinical experience with AIDS patients and (2) antihomosexual attitudes were significantly associated with the students' lack of HIV-AIDS knowledge, even after controlling for the effects of exaggerated risk estimates. The first two variables also were shown to be significantly predictive of the students' resistance to working with AIDS patients, as was an intolerance of drug use and drug users, beyond the influence of exaggerated risk estimates. Specific approaches of developing effective HIV-AIDS educational programs for health professionals are proposed.\r"

Most were unwilling to perform mouth-to-mouth resuscitation on patients with AIDS, and most also believed that health-care workers had the right to refuse care to AIDS patients. Unwillingness to treat AIDS patients was strongly associated with homophobic attitudes and concerns that patients with AIDS posed a risk to health professionals. AIDS education for health professionals should emphasize methods for the prevention of HIV infection among health workers, and include teaching strategies designed to deal with the irrational feelings that AIDS often engenders.\r"

Areas of educational strength and weakness were identified by levels of training for each program. The analyses of the individual programs' results were provided to the respective program directors on a confidential basis, and have been used to change curriculum content, modify lectures for residents, and provide structured review for residents. Similar analyses can be provided as a service to other residency program directors.\r"

All the students had completed high school within the previous five years; they were contacted by mailed questionnaires or telephone. The study was completed by contacting the colleges where the students had enrolled and through the use of the Student and Applicant Information System of the Association of American Medical Colleges. The findings showed that the students had enrolled in and graduated from college and that a significant number of the students had chosen medicine or another health-related career. The study suggests the importance of early academic intervention for students from minority groups to choose a medical career.\r"

These students had participated in a summer enrichment program at the University of Virginia School of Medicine and had applied to medical school. A total of 49 of the students were offered admission, and ultimately enrolled in 17 different medical schools. Results of a stepwise multiple regression analysis indicated that scores on the Skills Analysis: Quantitative Subtest of the MCAT explained the greatest percentage of the variance related to medical school admission (26%); scores on the Skills Analysis: Reading Subtest contributed an additional 7% to the explained variance, and scores on the Physics Knowledge Subtest, another 5%. The overall GPAs did not contribute significantly to the explanation of the variance in admission decisions. These results differ from published findings based on data from minorities' admissions to individual institutions. Caution must therefore be exercised when using GPAs and MCATs as medical school admission predictors for students from minority groups.\r"

From 1985 through 1989, 26 patients were treated using hematoporphyrin-derived drugs and 630-nm light delivered by a tunable dye laser. All patients had biopsy-proved squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck, and they had either failed the traditional treatment modalities or refused conventional therapies. Histological complete responses were achieved in 20 (77%) of 26 patients and partial responses in 5 (19%) of 26 patients for periods up to 48 months. Only minimal toxic reaction was noted in the group. As a guide to treatment planning for a patient group with large tumors, we used an optical dosimetry model based on tissue optics. The rate of complete responses to this treatment was 8 (73%) of 11. Our data indicate that photodynamic therapy is capable of inducing significant clinical and histological responses in the majority of those treated, and in some patients a prolonged response is produced. In certain select head and neck malignancies, photodynamic therapy has an important role as a treatment modality.\r"

  ".W": "The clinicopathologic features of nine cases of sinonasal tract leiomyosarcoma (SNTL) referred to the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology, Washington, DC, during the period from 1970 through 1988 are described. This report represents the largest study to date on SNTL, and our results are compared with the 21 previously reported cases of SNTL. Of the nine cases described, patients ranged in age from 22 to 86 years (mean, 55 years). The most frequent clinical presentation was nasal obstruction unilaterally. The neoplasms were limited solely to the nasal cavity in four cases (44%) and involved both the nasal cavity and paranasal sinuses in the remaining five cases. Light microscopic, immunocytochemical, and ultrastructural features served to characterize these tumors as malignant neoplasms of smooth-muscle origin. In contrast with previous studies, immunocytochemistry was employed to differentiate SNTL from other spindle cell malignancies of the region, using newly available monoclonal antibodies to smooth-muscle antigens. Treatment was surgical. Radiotherapy or chemotherapy did not appear to affect the progression of the disease. Furthermore, no relationship was found between the aggressiveness of SNTL and morphologic parameters (eg, mitotic count and tumor size). Instead, prognosis was dependent on the distribution of disease at presentation. Of all 30 patients with SNTL described to date, 10 had the neoplasm confined solely to the nasal cavity. The 10 neoplasms did not recur. We conclude that SNTL may best be regarded as a locally aggressive neoplasm with only limited metastatic potential and that it could be curable by complete surgical excision.\r"

Aneuploid carcinomas demonstrated a higher frequency of solid cytoarchitecture, lymph node metastases, and advanced clinical stage, as compared with diploid carcinomas. Other histologic features predicting aggressive clinical behavior also correlated with abnormal DNA content and included invasion of nerves larger than 0.25 mm and intravascular extension.

  ".W": "Given the association of deficient natural immunity with the risk of metastatic disease, the ability to activate natural killer cell function may have a therapeutic significance. The effect of continuous infusion of interleukin 2 plus intramuscular interferon alfa on natural immune status was, therefore, analyzed in eight patients with head and neck cancer. Also evaluated was the effect of interleukin 2-interferon alfa therapy on lymphokine-activated killer cell activity as well as total lymphocyte count, percent of lymphocyte subsets, and levels of both circulating immune complexes and antibody classes. Both the percent and absolute number of natural killer cells (ie, CD56+ CD3- lymphocytes) within peripheral blood as well as natural killer cell activity against K562 targets increased significantly with treatment. The remaining immune parameters were not significantly altered. The demonstrated capacity to modulate natural immune function supports the potential use of interleukin 2-containing regimens as a preventive measure against metastatic disease in patients with head and neck cancer.\r"

Three different DPOE paradigms have been used to investigate the influence of different test parameters on the DPOE data for normal and hearing-impaired ears. All normally hearing ears demonstrated detectable DPOEs, provided that the primary tone level was above a certain value. Hearing-impaired ears produced substantially reduced DPOEs compared with normally hearing subjects when the primary frequencies f1 and f2 corresponded to the region of hearing loss. Our data also suggested that, in general, more than one f2/f1 ratio is needed to examine any particular frequency region. The DPOEs provide frequency-specific information about cochlear function, which after further development, may form a basis for a noninvasive, objective method of evaluating cochlear function.\r"

Patients suffering auditory and vestibular symptoms secondary to perilymph fistula, therefore, present a dilemma to the practicing physician. In some instances, patients with auditory and vestibular symptoms in the absence of perilymph fistula will be subjected to middle ear exploration without benefit, while in other instances patients with auditory and vestibular symptoms secondary to perilymph fistula will be denied surgical treatment. Auditory and vestibular symptoms are a quality of life issue. Therefore, in an effort to provide care of the highest quality the patient must be actively involved in the decision process. Such involvement can be meaningful only after the patient is carefully counseled as to the pros and cons of surgery, as well as the alternatives. A prognostic paradigm based on the personal experience of one of us (W.L.M.) with perilymph fistula patients is described and is used in patient consultation in an effort to facilitate decision making.\r"

Psychophysical measurements of thresholds, MCLs, and LDLs with 125-Hz and 2000-Hz sinusoids were obtained from 16 patients with cochlear-implants 1 month after the connection of their ineraid processor (an auditory prosthesis). In general, the correlation coefficients among the loudness indexes obtained with a 125-Hz stimulus were similar to those for a 2000-Hz stimulus. Correlations between thresholds and MCLs were moderate, whereas correlations for thresholds and LDLs were fair. Correlations between MCLs and LDLs were high. This suggests that LDLs cannot be predicted from thresholds. On the other hand, these preliminary data suggest that MCLs may be reliably predicted from thresholds or LDLs to set the gain on a cochlear-implant processor.\r"

Our results are consistent with other studies that indicate a low correspondence between audiometric measures of hearing handicap and self-assessment of hearing handicap.

We are presenting a case of chondrosarcoma that recurred 10 years after excision of a presumed chondroma. Computed tomographic and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans were performed. Both studies delineated the lesion nicely. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on MRI characteristics of chondrosarcoma of the larynx. A review of the literature regarding the use of computed tomography in the management of chondrosarcoma is presented. The MRI characteristics are discussed and the two scanning modalities are compared. Computed tomography is an excellent study in its ability to demonstrate the extent of the lesion within the laryngeal skeleton. Furthermore, it is more highly sensitive than plain roentgenograms in the detection of calcifications that are highly suggestive of chondrosarcoma. Alternatively, MRI can also demonstrate the lesion within the larynx but it has the added advantage of superior contrast resolution of the tumor and paralaryngeal tissues. When the three-dimensional imaging capacity of MRI is considered as well, MRI seems to be the superior study.\r"

The families descended from index women delivered in the years 1931-47 and who had either eclampsia (n = 38) or severe pre-eclampsia (n = 69). Inheritance was followed both through sons and daughters. The prevalence of pre-eclampsia and eclampsia in daughters was significantly higher (23%) than that in daughters-in-law (10%). No difference was noted in the prevalence of these diseases by whether the daughter was born of an eclamptic or pre-eclamptic mother or whether she was a first or later born daughter. There was a non-significantly higher occurrence of pre-eclampsia among grand-daughters than in grand-daughters-in-law. No difference was seen by whether grand-daughters descended through sons or daughters. With increasing numbers of affected daughters or grand-daughters the probability rose of finding more affected women in a family. Hypotheses of single recessive and dominant gene inheritance were compared and maximum likelihood estimates for gene frequency obtained. For a single recessive gene model this was 0.31 reflecting a population prevalence of 9.6%, whereas a dominant model with incomplete penetrance gave 0.14 at 48% gene penetrance, corresponding to a population prevalence of 0.9% homozygous expression of severe disease and 11% heterozygous expression of milder disease. Either genetic model could fit the data.\r"

The techniques used were concentric needle electromyography (EMG), pudendal nerve conduction tests and assessment of pelvic floor contraction using a perineometer. There was EMG evidence of re-innervation in the pelvic floor muscles after vaginal delivery in 80% of those studied. Women who had a long active second stage of labour and heavier babies showed the most EMG evidence of nerve damage. Forceps delivery and perineal tears did not affect the degree of nerve damage seen. We conclude that vaginal delivery causes partial denervation of the pelvic floor (with consequent re-innervation) in most women having their first baby. In a few this is severe and is associated with urinary and faecal incontinence. For some it is likely to be the first step along a path leading to prolapse and/or stress incontinence.\r"

  ".U": "91055009\r", 
  ".W": "Up to the end of 1989, 206 parous women in the Oxford Family Planning Association contraceptive study had been referred to hospital with a first episode of pelvic inflammatory disease. Of these, 65 suffered from definite disease described as acute, 81 from definite disease not described as acute and 60 from 'other disease'. Considering all forms of disease together, referral was less common in those aged 25-29 and in those aged 45 or more than in those aged 30-44. Referral was more common in those of low social class, in those who smoked and in those who married young. All these factors were taken into account in analyses considering the effects of contraceptive methods. In these analyses, women currently using the contraceptive pill, the diaphragm, the sheath, female sterilization or an intrauterine device (IUCD) were compared with those currently using other methods or no method of contraception. IUCD ex-users were, however, placed in a separate category, irrespective of their current method of contraception. The relative risks obtained in these analyses, with 95% CI, were as follows: contraceptive pill 0.5 (0.2-0.9), diaphragm 0.6 (0.3-1.2), sheath 1.2 (0.6-2.4), female sterilization 0.7 (0.3-1.5), non-medicated IUCD 3.3 (2.3-5.0), medicated IUCD 1.8 (0.8-4.0), IUCD ex-users 1.3 (0.7-2.3). These data suggest that oral contraceptives, the diaphragm and female sterilization protect against pelvic inflammatory disease and that IUCDs increase the risk. Medicated devices, however, appear to carry only about half the risk of non-medicated devices, and the elevation of risks in IUCD ex-users appears to be small. Special analyses examined the risk associated with use of a Dalkon Shield. Among women currently using an IUCD (of any kind), those who had used a Dalkon Shield (at any time) had nearly five times as great a risk of hospital referral for pelvic inflammatory disease as those who had never used a Dalkon Shield (relative risk 4.7, 95% CI 2.1-9.0).\r"

Variables such as maternal age, smoking, nationality, relationship with the infant's father and gestational age had only moderate influence on the rates of different types of analgesia. EDA and PCB were more frequently used in larger than in smaller hospitals and in the daytime than at night. No such differences were found for pethidine or morphine, or pudendal block, which were administered routinely by midwives.\r"

Fetal blood sampling by cordocentesis was performed in all SGA fetuses and a significant quadratic relation was found between fetal hypoxaemia and the degree of reduction in the PI of FVWs from the fetal middle cerebral artery. Thus, maximum reduction in PI is reached when the fetal PO2 is 2-4 SD below the normal mean for gestation. When the oxygen deficit is greater there is a tendency for the PI to rise, and this presumably reflects the development of brain oedema.\r"

Significantly higher levels of progesterone were achieved with vaginal progesterone (P less than 0.01). Endometrial biopsies obtained during E2 replacement demonstrated normal proliferative features. Expression of an oestrogen related antigen (ER-Ag) was localized in the cytoplasm of the epithelium. After 3 days of progesterone replacement the endometrium showed normal secretory features and expression of ER-Ag in the stroma as well as in the glands. After 7 days of progesterone supplementation, vaginal administration produced a more consistent physiological appearance than oral administration. Thus transdermal E2 combined with vaginal progesterone is a highly satisfactory combination for establishing a physiological endometrium in women with premature ovarian failure.\r"

The punch biopsy had a 54% false negative rate and neither of the two microinvasive carcinomas biopsied in this way were detected by the biopsy. Ten of 24 women with negative punch biopsies had CIN III in the cone. When the punch biopsy showed CIN II or worse, the cone biopsy confirmed the presence of CIN in 86%. There was some evidence of false negative cone biopsies. The data suggest that management should not be based solely upon the punch biopsy result but should include consideration of the cytology and colposcopy findings. Excisional methods of treatment are more likely to reveal early invasion and adenocarcinoma-in-situ.\r"

The sensitivity of the angiotensin sensitivity test at the 10 ng/kg/min level was 92%. Because of its low sensitivity of 25% the supine pressor test appears to have no value for the prediction of PIH.

There was an apparent increase in stage at treatment with time which was probably related to more precise staging at laparotomy and the greater use of computerized tomography. The median survival for all patients was 28 months and the 5-year survival was 18%. Ten patients received postoperative chemotherapy for residual disease with an overall response rate of 80% and median progression-free and overall survival times of 14 and 21 months respectively. The pattern of relapse was similar to that seen in ovarian carcinoma, with all but one patient having the pelvis or abdomen as the main site of recurrence. Primary fallopian tube carcinoma has a response to treatment and a tumour biology similar to that of ovarian carcinoma. It is recommended that the management of this uncommon malignancy should continue to be along the lines of ovarian carcinoma, with initial treatment by cytoreductive surgery followed by chemotherapy or radiotherapy for residual disease.\r"

  ".W": "In a double blind trial, 60 nulliparae with a modified Bishop score of less than or equal to 5 requiring induction of labour, received either 8 mg of salbutamol or an identical placebo orally, 30 min before vaginal administration of 2 mg prostaglandin E2 gel. Women in the salbutamol group experienced less uterine activity over the subsequent 12 h compared with those given placebo, and fewer (35%) commenced labour compared with the placebo group (62%). However, the change in cervical score was significantly less in the salbutamol group (mean 3.0, SD 3.1) than that in the placebo group (mean 5.8, SD 3.2), and the prostaglandin treatment to delivery time in the salbutamol group (mean 26.1 h, SD 6.49) was significantly longer than that in the placebo group (mean 19.3 h, SD 7.95). The first stage of labour lasted greater than 10 h in 11 women in the salbutamol group compared with five in the placebo group. Side effects attributable to salbutamol occurred in 10% of the treated women but in none of their fetuses and fetal outcome was satisfactory and similar in both groups. Our findings show that salbutamol can suppress prostaglandin-induced uterine activity during cervical ripening, which could be an advantage in induction of labour where a planned delivery is preferred. However, the poorer outcome of labour in salbutamol-treated women mitigates against this approach.\r"

The interstitial colloid osmotic pressure was measured by the 'wick' method, and interstitial hydrostatic pressure by the 'wick-in-needle' method in subcutaneous tissue on the thorax and at the ankle. From antepartum (gestational week 37-40) to postpartum (5th day), the following changes were observed: A significant increase in the colloid osmotic pressure both in plasma (mean 1.8 mmHg, P = 0.027) and in the interstitial fluid at the ankle (mean 2.9 mmHg, P = 0.008). Neither colloid osmotic pressure gradient (plasma-interstitium), interstitial hydrostatic pressure, nor haemoglobin and haematocrit changed. The observed rise in the interstitial colloid osmotic pressure must be caused by mobilization of fluid from the interstitium, probably due to a reduced capillary hydrostatic pressure. The increase in plasma colloid osmotic pressure is most likely caused by an increased albumin synthesis and/or transport of interstitial proteins back to the vascular compartment.\r"

These data suggest that the rate of HIV infection among high-risk antibody negative individuals with hemophilia is very low to absent, in the range of 0% to 2%. These findings should provide considerable reassurance to seronegative persons with hemophilia and their sexual partners.\r"

A healthy donor was discovered during routine neutrophil antigen typing whose neutrophils were also \"NA-null.\" This NA-phenotype was due to the absence of FcRIII (CD16 antigen) on neutrophils as demonstrated with anti-FcRIII monoclonal antibodies. The neutrophils of these two individuals were not able to bind dimeric immunoglobulin G. However, their cells had a normal expression of other phosphatidylinositol (PI)-linked membrane glycoprotein (CD24, CD67, and CLB gran/5 antigens), ruling out the existence of a PI-linkage defect, such as paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria. The mother (propsitus) had isoantibodies in her blood against neutrophil-FcRIII without allospecificity, apparently produced during pregnancy and responsible for the neutropenia of her child. The expression of FcRIII on natural killer lymphocytes of both individuals was normal. FcRIII is encoded by two separate genes, one (FcRIII-1) for the neutrophil-PI-linked receptor, another (FcRIII-2) for the natural killer cell and macrophage-transmembrane receptor. By messenger RNA and DNA analysis (with an FcRIII-cDNA probe and restriction endonucleases) the neutrophil-FcRIII deficiency appeared to be due to deletion of the FcRIII-1 gene in both individuals, while the FcRIII-2 gene was normally present. The parents of the propositus were found to be heterozygous for this defect. Thus, FcRIII-1 gene deficiency of the mother may be a cause of (iso)immune neutropenia of the newborn. Whether this deficiency may have other clinical consequences has to be studied.\r"

  ".W": "High concentrations of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) alpha have been detected in the plasma of patients undergoing immunotherapy with interleukin 2 (IL-2), suggesting that this cytokine may play a role in the fever and shocklike state induced by the administration of high-dose IL-2. Dexamethasone has been shown to inhibit the synthesis of TNF by monocytes activated in vitro by endotoxin. To determine if dexamethasone can exert a similar suppressive effect on IL-2-induced TNF synthesis in vivo, the concentration of TNF alpha was measured in plasma samples serially obtained (a) from cancer patients participating in a phase I dose escalation clinical trial with high-dose IL-2 administered in conjunction with dexamethasone (IL-2/Dex) and (b) from patients participating in concurrent studies with IL-2 alone. In contrast to the high plasma levels of TNF alpha detected in patients receiving IL-2 alone, TNF levels in most of the IL-2/Dex patients remained below the threshold of detectability of our TNF radioimmunoassay. The concurrent administration of dexamethasone also prevented the IL-2-induced increase in serum levels of C-reactive protein, a hepatic acute phase reactant whose synthesis is regulated by proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF. The steroid-treated patients also failed to develop the neutrophil chemotactic defect characteristic of IL-2 recipients. The concomitant administration of dexamethasone increased the maximum tolerated dose of IL-2 approximately threefold and markedly reduced the hypotension and organ dysfunction ordinarily observed in these patients. These results demonstrate that dexamethasone inhibits the release of TNF into the circulation of patients undergoing immunotherapy with IL-2. They further suggest that the altered spectrum and reduced severity of IL-2 side effects observed in patients receiving dexamethasone may be attributable in part to the suppressive effect of steroids on IL-2-induced TNF synthesis.\r"

A soluble form of the IL-2 receptor is released by these cells in culture, and the sera of patients with hairy cell leukemia contain elevated levels of this soluble receptor. Four hundred twenty-seven serum samples from 101 patients were analyzed for soluble IL-2 receptor (sIL-2R). The clinical status of patients appeared to be associated with the serum level of sIL-2R. The hairy cell index (a measure of tumor cell burden) was correlated with the square root of the serum sIL-2R level (r = .77). Improved clinical status was associated with decreasing serum sIL-2R levels, whereas disease relapse was associated with increasing levels. Notably, every patient who responded to therapy had a decline in serum sIL-2R level, and every patient with disease progression had an increase in serum sIL-2R level. This phenomenon was observed for several different treatments, including standard-dose interferon, low-dose interferon, and deoxycoformycin. The predictive reliability of this test is currently being prospectively evaluated.\r"

The presence of TGF/beta 1 messenger RNA (mRNA) in mature megakaryocytes in adult rat spleen and bone marrow (BM) was established by in situ hybridization. Localization of TGF/beta 1 protein to intact alpha-granules of megakaryocytes, its putative storage site, was accomplished in glycol-methacrylate embedded porcine BM with an immunoperoxidase technique and light microscopy. The TGF/beta 1 was sequestered in intracytoplasmic granules in a pattern virtually identical to that of another alpha-granule marker protein, fibrinogen. This observation strongly suggests packaging of TGF/beta 1 into this organelle within megakaryocytes. That TGF/beta 1 mRNA was localized to megakaryocytes suggests that the TGF/beta 1 found in the alpha-granules in platelets originates with megakaryocyte synthesis. The alpha-granule localization of TGF/beta 1, as well as fibrinogen, was also demonstrated in isolated platelets at the ultrastructural level by electronmicroscopy (EM) and postembedding colloidal-gold immunocytochemistry, thus directly demonstrating that alpha-granules are the final storage site for TGF/beta 1 in mature platelets.\r"

We isolated total CD34+ cells, CD34+,CD33+ cells, and CD34+,CD33- cells individually from normal human bone marrow cells by fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS), and examined the effects of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), interleukin-3 (IL-3), and IL-5 on in vitro colony formation of these cells. CD34+,CD33+ cells formed granulocyte colonies in the presence of G-CSF. Both CD34+,CD33+ cells and CD34+,CD33- cells formed granulocyte/macrophage colonies in the presence of IL-3. Eosinophil (Eo) colonies were only formed by CD34+,CD33- cells in response to IL-3, but scarcely formed by CD34+ cells in the presence of IL-5. We performed the two-step cultures consisting of the primary liquid culture for 6 days and the secondary methylcellulose culture, and serially examined changes in phenotypes of ,he cells cultured in the primary culture. CD34-,CD33+ cells derived from CD34+,CD33+ cells by preincubation with G-CSF or IL-3 formed Eo colonies in the presence of IL-5 but not IL-3. CD34-,CD33+ cells derived from CD34+,CD33- cells by preincubation with IL-3 also formed Eo colonies by support of IL-5 as well as IL-3. Both CD34+ cells gradually lost the CD34 antigen by day 6 of incubation with G-CSF or IL-3. Loss of this antigen was well-correlated with acquisition of susceptibility to IL-5. It was concluded that G-CSF supported the neutrophil differentiation of committed colony-forming cells, IL-3 supported that of both committed and multipotent colony-forming cells. G-CSF and IL-3 also supported the early stage of E. differentiation; IL-5 supported the late stage of that.\r"

Serum samples from 24 patients in the acute stage of infection (14 men and 10 women, age 65 to 101, without hematologic disorders), as well as samples from 32 age-matched normal elderly volunteers were investigated. Sixteen of the initial 24 patients were reexamined after the recovery phase. G-CSF levels were examined by quantitative enzyme immunoassay. The G-CSF level in normal elderly controls, 25.3 +/- 19.7 pg/mL, was not different from that reported in other findings. There was no statistically significant relationship between their G-CSF level and peripheral white blood cell count or neutrophilic granulocyte count. The G-CSF level in the acute stage of infection was 731.8 +/- 895.0 pg/mL, with a range of 30 to 3,199 pg/mL. There was no significant difference in G-CSF levels between patients with respiratory tract infection and those with urinary tract infection. In all 16 cases examined, the serum G-CSF level in the acute stage of infection was significantly higher than that after recovery phase, the latter being the same as the level in normal elderly controls. G-CSF must therefore play a significant role in human infectious states in vivo.\r"

  ".W": "We have examined the in vitro effects of recombinant human (rh) interleukin-1 (IL-1) on the growth of purified megakaryoblasts obtained from patients with acute megakaryoblastic leukemia. We demonstrate that both IL-1 alpha and IL-1 beta treatment of these cells led to stimulation of DNA synthesis (as shown by increase of 3H-thymidine incorporation up to 35-fold) and also resulted in colony formation of leukemic megakaryoblasts. However, the stimulatory effect of IL-1 was dependent on endogenous production of IL-6, because addition of neutralizing monoclonal antibody (MoAb) to IL-6 abrogated the stimulatory activity of IL-1. In contrast, neutralizing MoAbs to granulocyte (G)-colony stimulating factor (CSF), granulocyte-macrophage (GM)-CSF, and macrophage (M)-CSF failed to counteract the growth-enhancing effects of IL-1. Leukemic megakaryoblasts accumulated IL-6 mRNA and released IL-6 protein into their culture supernatant when exposed to rh IL-1 but failed to disclose transcripts for G-, GM-, and M-CSF under these conditions. Analysis of IL-6 receptor (IL-6R) transcript levels demonstrated that megakaryoblasts constitutively expressed IL-6R mRNA and that these transcripts are down-regulated to undetectable levels upon exposure to IL-1 and IL-6. Increase of 3H-thymidine incorporation by megakaryoblasts could be duplicated by exogenous IL-6 that could be blocked by neutralizing MoAb to IL-6. In conclusion, our results suggest that leukemic megakaryoblasts could produce and secrete IL-6, and express IL-6R, and that the growth-enhancing effect of IL-1 on these cells is indirect, via production of IL-6 by leukemic cells.\r"

  ".W": "Monocytotropic human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) isolates from patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) infect mononuclear phagocytes as well as activated T cells, but do not usually infect immature human myeloid cell lines in vitro. The HL-60 promyelocytic/myeloblastic cell line and the promonocytic line, U937, were susceptible to productive infection by monocytotropic HIV-1 isolates (HIV-1JR-FL and HTLV-IIIBa-L) after treatment with retinoic acid, dimethyl sulfoxide, dibutyryl cAMP, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25(OH)2D3), or 12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate (TPA). Virus production was only detected when these compounds were added before virus infection. Virus replication did not correlate with CD4 receptor expression because undifferentiated HL-60 cells express CD4 and the level of CD4 expression did not increase after differentiation in the presence of retinoic acid, 1,25(OH)2D3, or TPA. A mature monocytic cell line (THP-1) was capable of infection without pretreatment, and treatment with differentiating agents enhanced virus production. A chronically infected cell line (J-HL-60) was isolated after HIV-1JR-FL infection of HL-60 cells treated with retinoic acid. Virus production in this cell line was enhanced more than 10-fold after differentiation in the presence of 1,25(OH)2D3 or TPA. The majority of virus production by 1,25(OH)2D3-treated J-HL-60 cells was associated with the mature, adherent population. Molecular analysis of a cloned line of J-HL-60 showed integration of a single DNA provirus. These results suggest that cellular factors associated with precursor cell differentiation along the myelomonocytic pathway are required for optimal replication of monocytotropic HIV-1 strains in vitro.\r"

An additional unexplained sequela of B19 infection is thrombocytopenia. Because B19 is known to have a remarkable tropism for human erythropoietic elements, and is not known to replicate in nonerythroid cells, the etiology of this thrombocytopenia is uncertain. We sought to define the pathobiology of B19-associated thrombocytopenia by examining the role of B19 on in vitro megakaryocytopoiesis. B19 infection of normal human bone marrow cells significantly suppressed megakaryocyte (MK) colony formation compared with mock-infected cells. No such inhibition was observed with a nonpathogenic human parvovirus, the adeno-associated virus 2 (AAV). The B19-MK cell interaction was also studied at the molecular level. Whereas low-density bone marrow cells containing erythroid precursor cells supported B19 DNA replication, no viral DNA replication was observed in B19-infected MK-enriched fractions as determined by the presence of viral DNA replicative intermediates on Southern blots. However, analysis of total cytoplasmic RNA isolated from B19-infected MK fractions showed a low-level expression of the B19 genome as detected by quantitative RNA dot blots as well as by Northern analysis. Furthermore, a frame-shift mutation in a recombinant AAV-B19 hybrid genome segment that encodes the viral nonstructural (NS1) protein significantly reduced the observed inhibition of MK colony formation. These studies indicate tissue-tropism of B19 beyond the erythroid progenitor cell, and lend support to the hypothesis that B19 genome expression may be toxic to cell populations that are nonpermissive for viral DNA replication.\r"

  ".W": "Platelet membrane glycoprotein Ib (GPIb), a receptor for von Willebrand factor and thrombin, is present on the platelet surface membrane, in intraplatelet stores, and in plasma (as the proteolytic fragment glycocalicin). We examined the hypothesis that after plasmin-mediated cleavage of platelet surface GPIb, platelets can replenish their surface GPIb pool. Incubation of washed platelets with plasmin (1 hour, 22 degrees C) resulted in loss of platelet surface GPIb, but further incubation (3 hours, 37 degrees C) in autologous plasma resulted in restoration of platelet surface GPIb, as determined by ristocetin-induced platelet agglutination and a flow cytometric assay of platelet binding of three GPIb-specific monoclonal antibodies. Despite the restoration of platelet surface GPIb after the 3-hour incubation of plasmin-treated platelets in autologous plasma, the whole platelet GPIb content (measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay [ELISA], sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and flow cytometry) remained reduced, quantitatively corresponding to an increase in plasma glycocalicin concentration (measured by ELISA). The loss and restoration of platelet surface GPIb occurred on all platelets and, as evidenced by lack of inhibition by prostaglandin E1, EDTA, and cytochalasins, was not mediated by cyclic AMP, extracellular Ca2+, or the platelet microfilament system. In summary, this study shows that after plasmin-mediated cleavage of platelet surface GPIb, platelets can replenish their surface GPIb pool by recruitment of GPIb molecules from the intraplatelet pool (or from a sequestered surface site).\r"

Mixing studies with normal plasma failed to correct the clotting times. Platelet transfusions, immunosuppressive and immunomodulatory therapies were ineffective, but plasmapheresis was effective in decreasing clotting times and in the resolution of clinical bleeding events. The patient's purified IgG reacted with bovine thrombin by immunoblotting and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). However, the IgG reacted minimally with human thrombin. In view of the severe bleeding, a coexisting inhibitor was sought. The patient's factor V activity was 1% of normal and was not corrected by mixing with normal plasma, demonstrating the presence of an inhibitor against factor V. The patient's IgG reacted with both bovine and human factor V. Immunoblotting localized the site of antibody binding to the light chain of activated bovine factor V. Detectable amounts of bovine factor V were found in commercial bovine thrombin preparations by ELISA. The data suggest that patients exposed to topical bovine thrombin may develop antibodies to thrombin and factor V. Anti-thrombin antibodies may mask coexisting factor V inhibitors responsible for clinical bleeding.\r"

  ".W": "Normal primary platelet aggregation requires agonist-mediated activation of membrane GPIIb-IIIa, binding of fibrinogen to GPIIb-IIIa, and cellular events after ligand binding. PAC1 monoclonal antibody distinguishes between resting and activated states of GPIIb-IIIa, and other antibodies preferentially recognize GPIIb (PMI-1) or IIIa (anti-LIBS1) after the binding of fibrinogen or fibrinogen-mimetic peptides, such as GRGDSP. Using these antibodies and platelet flow cytometry, we studied two distinct persistent platelet aggregation abnormalities. Platelets from a thrombasthenic variant, which contained near-normal amounts of GPIIb-IIIa, failed to aggregate or bind PAC1 in response to agonists. In addition, GRGDSP, which binds to normal GPIIb-IIIa without prior cell activation, failed to increase the binding of PMI-1 or anti-LIBS1 to the thrombasthenic platelets, suggesting a primary defect in ligand binding. Chromatography of detergent-solubilized platelets on a KYGRGDS affinity column confirmed that the patient's GPIIb-IIIa lacked the fibrinogen binding site. In another patient with myelofibrosis and defective aggregation, PAC1 failed to bind to adenosine diphosphate-stimulated platelets, but did bind when protein kinase C was directly activated with phorbol myristate acetate. Furthermore, the binding of PMI-1 and anti-LIBS1 increased in response to GRGDSP, confirming a defect in agonist-mediated fibrinogen receptor activation rather than in fibrinogen binding or events distal to binding. These studies indicate that this immunochemical approach is useful in classification of clinical abnormalities of platelet aggregation as defects in either (a) fibrinogen receptor activation, (b) fibrinogen binding, or (c) postoccupancy events.\r"

Plasma concentrations of thrombomodulin in patients with various diseases were measured by two methods of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using monoclonal antibodies. One method measures intact thrombomodulin and degraded forms of thrombomodulin; the other does not detect the two smaller degraded forms of thrombomodulin present in plasma. The results indicated that thrombomodulin was increased in the circulating blood of patients with disseminated intravascular coagulation syndrome, pulmonary thromboembolism, adult respiratory distress syndrome, chronic renal failure, or acute hepatic failure. The different values obtained by the two methods indicate that the increase of plasma thrombomodulin found in these patients was mainly due to an increase of the smaller fragments of degraded forms, suggesting that the release of thrombomodulin from endothelial cells was accelerated in various disease states by proteolytic activity generated on the surface of the endothelium and may be removed from the circulation mostly by the kidneys and liver.\r"

LAK cells were generated by incubating peripheral blood mononuclear cells from patients post-BMT with recombinant interleukin-2 (IL-2) (500 U/mL) in 10% AB serum for 7 days. They were phenotyped and tested for activity in a standard 4-hour 51Cr release assay (n = 37) and in a CFU-GM assay (n = 24). We found that the LAK cells were mainly activated natural killer cells, but some were CD3+ T cells. In the 51Cr release assay LAK cells from 20 of 33 (61%) allogeneic and 2 of 4 syngeneic recipients killed recipient CML cells and in 22 of 37 (60%) cases also killed the HLA disparate CML cells. In the CFU-GM assay the LAK cells incubated together with the CML cells in liquid culture before plating inhibited (P less than .05) colony growth in 16 of 22 allogeneic and 2 of 2 syngeneic recipients. Cell-cell contact was necessary for optimal effect. There was little or no inhibition of proliferation of donor marrow CFU-GM. This in vitro graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) effect could also be demonstrated after LAK effectors were depleted of CD3+ T cells. It was inducible in recipients of both T cell-depleted and T cell-replete donor marrow and in recipients with or without graft-versus-host disease. These results suggest that a major histocompatibility complex-unrestricted GVL effect is inducible following allogeneic and syngeneic BMT. The use of IL-2/LAK cells after BMT could reduce the risk of relapse.\r"

To determine whether this drug might be useful not only for iron-overload but also for immunosuppression, we studied the in vitro effects of desferrithiocin on T-lymphocyte function. Like deferoxamine, desferrithiocin inhibited, in a dose-dependent fashion, mitogen- and lectin-induced proliferation of both human and murine T cells. It was active at a concentration of 10 micrograms/mL. The inhibition of proliferation was reversed by ferrous chloride, but not by other metal salts, recombinant IL-2, or conditioned medium. Desferrithiocin also inhibited proliferation of constitutively dividing, and factor-independent EBV-transformed B cell and leukemic T-cell lines. Although desferrithiocin inhibited the induction of cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) activity, it did not inhibit CTL- or natural killer-induced cytotoxicity. The agent did not inhibit the expression of activation antigens such as the IL-2 receptor on T cells, nor early measures of T-cell activation such as the influx of intracellular calcium. Thus, desferrithiocin, like deferoxamine, is a potent and reversible inhibitor of T-cell proliferation. This anti-proliferative effect inhibits T-cell function. Bioavailability after oral administration is a unique property of desferrithiocin, and would make it an attractive alternative to deferoxamine. Its immunomodulating properties may therefore be exploited in vivo to inhibit graft rejection or autoreactive T cells.\r"

The deletion was located at the 3' portion of the Rb gene, very close to the site of Rb gene deletion recently identified in an ALL cell line. The absence of Rb110 protein was further confirmed by Western blot analysis. The second patient was a chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMMoL), terminated in acute blastic transformation. Deletion of the 5' portion of Rb gene was found in leukemic cells in the chronic stage. The results indicated that inactivation of the Rb gene occurred in certain cases of leukemia. Its significance warrants further study.\r"

  ".W": "The cell membrane expression and functional role of the interleukin-2 receptor (IL-2R) was analyzed in nine patients with lymphoproliferative disease of granular lymphocytes (LDGL) using monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs) specific for the p75 (TU27) and the p55 (anti-Tac) subunits of IL-2R. Four patients were characterized by the proliferation of CD3+CD8+ granular lymphocytes (GL) expressing the alpha/beta T-cell receptor (T alpha beta) and one case by the proliferation of CD3+CD4-CD8- GL expressing the gamma/delta T-cell receptor (T gamma delta); in four additional cases proliferating cells were CD3 negative GL. Consistent with data observed on normal GL, phenotypic analysis demonstrated that patients' GL lack the expression of the p55 IL-2R, whereas the p75 subunit is constitutionally expressed by expanding GL of both T-cell (either T alpha beta and T gamma delta) and natural killer (NK) origin in variable proportions (11% to 94% of cells). The analysis of the cytotoxic and proliferative activity demonstrated that the anti-p55 MoAb failed to inhibit IL-2-mediated activation, whereas a marked inhibition of both cytotoxicity and proliferation were obtained using the anti-p75 chain specific MoAb. These data indicate that the p75 chain of IL-2R is responsible for IL-2 signal transduction in both CD3+ and CD3- LDGL patients' GL.\r"

  ".W": "Previous studies using classical cytogenetics have demonstrated the presence of the t(11;14) (q13;q32) chromosomal translocation in some cases of lymphocytic lymphoma of intermediate differentiation (IDL), a distinct type of low grade B-cell lymphoma. This finding suggested that the bcl-1 region (located at band q13 of chromosome 11) might be involved in this neoplasm. Using a genomic probe from the major breakpoint area of the bcl-1 locus, we identified rearrangements of the bcl-1 region in 10 of 19 cases, 2 of which comigrated with a rearranged allele of the immunoglobulin heavy chain gene joining region. In contrast, bcl-1 rearrangements were not found in other types of low grade B-cell lymphoma, specifically in 36 cases of chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL/SLL) and 27 cases of follicular lymphoma (FL). To further assess the molecular pathology of IDL, we analyzed these cases for rearrangements of the bcl-2 proto-oncogene, which is associated primarily with follicular lymphomas. None of the 19 cases of IDL had rearrangements. Furthermore, none of the 36 cases of CLL/SLL showed bcl-2 rearrangements, whereas, as expected, 21 of 27 cases of FL had rearrangements of the bcl-2 locus. Our findings demonstrate an association between a rearranged bcl-1 region with approximately 50% of IDLs and suggest that abnormalities of this locus may be important in the pathogenesis of IDL.\r"

  ".W": "The effect of mitogens and/or recombinant B-cell growth factors (M/GFs) on the in vitro growth of hairy cells was examined. Tumor cells were isolated from the spleens of four patients with hairy cell leukemia (HCL) by Ficoll-Hypaque sedimentation and E-rosetting. Enrichment for tumor cells was confirmed with intracytoplasmic immunoglobulin (Ig) staining, tartrate resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) staining, and staining using monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs) directed at B, T, myeloid, and monocytoid antigens (Ags) in indirect immunofluorescence assays. Tumor cells were B1(CD20)+ B2(CD21)- B4(CD19)+ IL-2R(CD25)+ PCA-1 +/- TRAP+. HCLs neither synthesized DNA nor secreted Ig in response to culture with granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), interleukin-1 alpha (IL-1 alpha), IL-1 beta, IL-2, IL-3, IL-4, IL-5, or IL-6. However, a proliferative response (stimulation index greater than or equal to 3.0) without Ig secretion was triggered in HCLs by mitogens or combinations of GFs. Specifically, DNA synthesis was induced at 3 days in three of four HCL samples cultured with Staphylococcus aureus Cowan A (SAC) or the combination of phorbol ester (TPA) and the calcium ionophore A 23187 (Ca2+); DNA synthesis was triggered later (day 7) by tumor necrosis factor (TNF) or by IL-4 and IL-5. In contrast, the fourth patient, a nonresponder to SAC or TPA/Ca2+, demonstrated increased DNA synthesis at day 3 when cocultured with IL-4 and IL-5. Both autoradiography and staining with antibromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) MoAb conjugated to fluorescein confirmed DNA synthesis by only a minority (5% to 23%) of tumor cells within each patient. Dual staining confirmed that responsive cells were both BrdU+ and TRAP+. DNA synthesis induced by TPA/Ca2+ was blocked specifically by anti-IL-6 Ab; in contrast, the HCL proliferative response to SAC, TNF, or IL-4 and IL-5 was not inhibited by anti-IL-6 Ab. alpha-Interferon inhibited the response to TPA/Ca2+, TNF, or IL-4 and IL-5 without any effect on response to SAC. Finally, peroxidase-antiperoxidase staining demonstrated that HCLs are induced by TPA/Ca2+, but not by SAC, to produce intracytoplasmic IL-6. These data demonstrate IL-4, IL-5, and IL-6 mediated DNA synthesis by HCLs in vitro and suggest a possible in vivo role for these growth factors in the pathophysiology of HCL.\r"

  ".W": "The role of tyrosine kinases in the responses of human neutrophils to chemotactic factors was examined using the recently described inhibitor erbstatin. Pre-incubation with erbstatin decreased the amount of tyrosine phosphorylation induced by the formylated oligopeptide formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (fMet-Leu-Phe) without effecting the binding of [3H]-fMet-Leu-Phe. Erbstatin also dose-dependently inhibited the production of superoxide anion induced by fMet-Leu-Phe and platelet-activating factor, but did not affect the oxidative burst induced by either the calcium ionophore A23187 or the phorbol ester phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate. Furthermore, erbstatin diminished the cytosolic acidification elicited by fMet-Leu-Phe, platelet-activating factor, and leukotriene B4. In contrast, erbstatin was without effect on the increase in the levels of cytoplasmic free calcium and polymerized actin elicited by fMet-Leu-Phe, C5a, leukotriene B4 and platelet-activating factor, whereas the increase in cytoplasmic free calcium elicited by platelet-derived growth factor was inhibited by erbstatin. In addition, erbstatin affected neither the release of elastase stimulated by these agonists nor the release of beta-glucosaminidase, lysozyme or vitamin B12-binding protein induced by fMet-Leu-Phe. These results indicate that tyrosine protein kinases are involved in the signaling pathways employed by chemotactic factors in the stimulation of selective functional responses (and superoxide production in particular) in human neutrophils.\r"

  ".W": "Cytochrome b558 is a membrane-bound component of the NADPH-oxidase system in phagocytes and consists of a low-Mr subunit of 22 to 23 Kd and a high-Mr subunit of 75 to 90 Kd. The present study on the subcellular localization of the low Mr subunit of cytochrome b558 (p22-phox) in resting human peripheral blood phagocytes was based on immunogold labeling with monoclonal antibody (MoAb) 449, recently characterized. In post-embedding labeled neutrophils, this subunit was found mainly in the membrane of the specific granules. This conclusion was supported by a quantitative analysis of the results obtained in immunogold double-labeled sections with a polyclonal antiserum against lactoferrin (LF) as a marker for specific granules and a polyclonal antiserum against myeloperoxidase (MPO) used to identify azurophil granules. No labeling of the plasma membrane was observed, because of limited penetration of the antibody into the cryosections, preventing the detection of low antigen concentrations. Pre-embedding labeling of digitonin-permeabilized neutrophils, which has the advantage of a better penetration of the antibody into the cells, showed intense immunoreactivity on the cytoplasmic side of intact granules and low labeling on the inner surface of the plasma membrane. These complementary findings indicate that in resting neutrophils the epitope of p22-phox, recognized by MoAb 449, is present on the cytoplasmic side of the membrane of specific granules and the plasma membrane. Similar observations were made in eosinophils, where MoAb 449 reacted strongly with the cytoplasmic side of numerous small granules, and a low level of labeling was observed on the inner surface of the plasma membrane. In monocytes, MoAb 449 labeling also occurred on the inner surface of plasma membrane, of endocytotic compartments, and the outer surface of relatively small granules differing from peroxidase-containing lysosomes, as shown by immunogold double-labeling with MPO.\r"

Previously, only mixtures of low molecular weight Fn fragments, and the 120-Kd fibroblastic cell-binding segment, but not intact Fn, were shown to be selectively chemotactic for human monocytes (MOs). In order to determine if other structural domains of Fn were responsible, we tested six Fn fragments. The amino-terminal 72-Kd fragment at 1.5 microns was about 75% as potent as zymosan-activated serum (ZAS). Its amino-terminal 29-Kd degradation product at 1.0 micron was about one third as potent as ZAS. Checkerboard analysis confirmed chemotaxis. Complexing gelatin to 72-Kd fragments reduced MO chemotaxis by 28% to 30%. Reducing disulfide bonds in 29- and 72-Kd segments had no effect. A synthetic peptide containing the thrombin cleavage site between the 29- and 50-Kd segments of the 72-Kd fragment was chemotactic. The 50-, 190/170-, 35-, and 160/150/120-Kd fragments, and intact Fn were not chemotactic for MOs. The data suggest that the 72-Kd fragment and its 29-Kd subfragment are additional Fn fragments that mediate selective MO chemotaxis. We speculate that proteinases present at inflammatory sites can liberate such fragments that selectively recruit MOs.\r"

  ".W": "Oxidative injury to hemoglobin (Hb) leads to formation of methemoglobin (MetHb), reversible hemichromes (rHCRs), and irreversible hemichromes (iHCRs). iHCRs precipitate and form Heinz bodies that attach to the red cell membrane causing injury that leads to hemolysis. The molecular mechanisms of this membrane damage have not been fully elucidated. We have studied the effect of Hb oxidation products on the mechanical stability of red cell membrane skeletons and the associations of membrane skeletal proteins. Hb and MetHb stabilized the isolated membrane skeletons, whereas further oxidation to rHCRs abolished this stabilizing effect. Crude iHCRs prepared by phenylhydrazine oxidation of Hb destabilized membrane skeletons by decreasing formation of the spectrin-protein 4.1-actin complex, the effect similar to that of pure hemin. Whereas virtually no hemin was released from Hb and MetHb, high concentrations of hemin were released from crude iHCR preparations. After removal of this hemin fraction by Dowex resin, the iHCRs lost their destabilizing effect. We conclude that as the oxidation of Hb proceeds, the stabilizing effect of Hb on the membrane skeleton is gradually lost and the deleterious effect increases. The destabilization of the red cell membrane skeleton in the presence of crude iHCR is caused by release of hemin, which lowers the stability of membrane skeleton by weakening the spectrin-protein 4.1-actin interaction.\r"

  ".W": "Patients with sickle cell anemia experience severe vascular occlusive phenomena including acute pain crisis and cerebral infarction. Obstruction occurs at both the microvascular and the arterial level, and the clinical presentation of vascular events is heterogeneous, suggesting a complex etiology. Interaction between sickle erythrocytes and the endothelium may contribute to vascular occlusion due to alteration of endothelial function. To investigate this hypothesis, human vascular endothelial cells were overlaid with sickle or normal erythrocytes and stimulated to synthesize DNA. The erythrocytes were sedimented onto replicate monolayers by centrifugation for 10 minutes at 17 g to insure contact with the endothelial cells. Incorporation of 3H-thymidine into endothelial cell DNA was markedly inhibited during contact with sickle erythrocytes. This inhibitory effect was enhanced more than twofold when autologous sickle plasma was present during endothelial cell labeling. Normal erythrocytes, with or without autologous plasma, had a modest effect on endothelial cell DNA synthesis. When sickle erythrocytes in autologous sickle plasma were applied to endothelial monolayers for 1 minute, 10 minutes, or 1 hour and then removed, subsequent DNA synthesis by the endothelial cells was inhibited by 30% to 40%. Although adherence of sickle erythrocytes to the endothelial monolayers was observed under these experimental conditions, the effect of sickle erythrocytes on endothelial DNA synthesis occurred in the absence of significant adherence. Hence, human endothelial cell DNA synthesis is partially inhibited by contact with sickle erythrocytes. The inhibitory effect of sickle erythrocytes occurs during a brief (1 minute) contact with the endothelial monolayers, and persists for at least 6 hours of 3H-thymidine labeling. These results indicate that interaction between sickle erythrocytes and the endothelium may result in altered endothelial function. This altered endothelial function may contribute to the development of vascular occlusive phenomena in patients with sickle cell anemia.\r"

In this article, by using sex mismatched transplants and a molecular probe for Y-chromosome specific DNA sequences, we show that among the peripheral blood cells during G-CSF therapy are substantial numbers of primitive stem cells capable of (1) reconstituting the hematopoietic system in the long term, and (2) making a contribution to the lymphoid populations of the thymus, in radiation ablated recipients. These data suggest that blood from patients treated with G-CSF may provide a convenient source of the most primitive stem cells for autologous or allogeneic bone marrow transplantation.\r"

We have developed an experimental model based on the hemocytometer counts and the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), performed on the lymphocytes derived from the units of red cell mass inoculated with marker cells (H9) persistently carrying cell-associated human immunodeficiency virus DNA (CA-HIV). We measured the efficiency of 6 units of a prototype filter using our model and found an estimated mean of less than 4 residual cells per milliliter in the filtered blood. This represents a mean 5.84 log10 reduction of normal PBMC and CA-HIV in pre- and post-filtration aliquots and exemplifies the application of our model for evaluating a new generation of blood filters. Our model illustrates that a biological tracer (ie, DNA) is a better measure of the efficacy of a leukocyte filter than the hemocytometric enumeration of pre- and post-filtration PBMC concentrates.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVES--To assess outside a clinical trial the psychological outcome of different treatment policies in women with early breast cancer who underwent either mastectomy or breast conservation surgery depending on the surgeon's opinion or the patient's choice. To determine whether the extent of psychiatric morbidity reported in women who underwent breast conservation surgery was associated with their participation in a randomised clinical trial. DESIGN--Prospective, multicentre study capitalising on individual and motivational differences among patients and the different management policies among surgeons for treating patients with early breast cancer. SETTING--12 District general hospitals, three London teaching hospitals, and four private hospitals. PATIENTS--269 Women under 75 with a probable diagnosis of stage I or II breast cancer who were referred to 22 different surgeons. INTERVENTIONS--Surgery and radiotherapy or adjuvant chemotherapy, or both, depending on the individual surgeon's stated preferences for managing early breast cancer. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Anxiety and depression as assessed by standard methods two weeks, three months, and 12 months after surgery. RESULTS--Of the 269 women, 31 were treated by surgeons who favoured mastectomy, 120 by surgeons who favoured breast conservation, and 118 by surgeons who offered a choice of treatment. Sixty two of the women treated by surgeons who offered a choice were eligible to choose their surgery, and 43 of these chose breast conserving surgery. The incidences of anxiety, depression, and sexual dysfunction were high in all treatment groups. There were no significant differences in the incidences of anxiety and depression between women who underwent mastectomy and those who underwent lumpectomy. A significant effect of surgeon type on the incidence of depression was observed, with patients treated by surgeons who offered a choice showing less depression than those treated by other surgeons (p = 0.06). There was no significant difference in psychiatric morbidity between women treated by surgeons who offered a choice who were eligible to choose their treatment and those in the same group who were not able to choose. Most of the women (159/244) gave fear of cancer as their primary fear rather than fear of losing a breast. The overall incidences of psychiatric morbidity in women who underwent mastectomy and those who underwent lumpectomy were similar to those found in the Cancer Research Campaign breast conservation study. At 12 months 28% of women who underwent mastectomy in the present study were anxious compared with 26% in the earlier study, and 27% of women in the present study who underwent lumpectomy were anxious compared with 31% in the earlier study. In both the present and earlier study 21% of women who underwent mastectomy were depressed, and 19% of women who underwent lumpectomy in the present study were depressed compared with 27% in the earlier study.) CONCLUSIONS--There is still no evidence that women with early breast cancer who undergo breast conservation surgery have less psychiatric morbidity after treatment than those who undergo mastectomy. Women who surrender autonomy for decision making by agreeing to participate in randomised clinical trials do not experience any different psychological, sexual, or social problems from those women who are treated for breast cancer outside a clinical trial.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE--To determine the effect of atenolol on the outcome of pregnancy in women with essential hypertension. DESIGN--Prospective, randomised, double blind, placebo controlled study. SETTING--Hospital clinic. PATIENTS--33 Women with mild essential hypertension (systolic blood pressure 140-170 mm Hg or diastolic pressure 90-110 mm Hg on two occasions at least 24 hours apart) consecutively referred to two obstetric medical clinics. Four patients in the placebo group were withdrawn from the study: control of blood pressure was inadequate in two, one developed breathlessness, and one changed her mind about participating. The mean gestation in the 29 remaining women on entry to the study was 15.9 weeks. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Blood pressure and birth weight. INTERVENTION--14 Women received placebo. 15 Women received atenolol 50 mg daily initially, increasing until either the blood pressure was less than 140/90 mm Hg or a dose of 200 micrograms daily was reached. RESULTS--The mean blood pressure on entry was 148/86 mm Hg in the group given atenolol and 144/86 mm Hg in the group given placebo. During treatment the mean diastolic pressure was significantly reduced by atenolol compared with placebo (to 74 v 81 mm Hg; difference in means (95% confidence interval) 7.0 (2.9 to 10.0) mm Hg) but the effect on systolic pressure was marginal (132 v 136 mm Hg; 4.0 (-1.4 to 8.6) mm Hg). Babies in the atenolol group had a significantly lower birth weight than those in the placebo group (2620 g v 3530 g; 910 (440 to 1380)g). CONCLUSION--Atenolol given from the end of the first trimester in patients with mild hypertension is associated with intrauterine growth retardation. When taken in conjunction with the results of a previous study in which methyldopa was given these findings indicate that benefit is unlikely to result from treating mild essential hypertension in pregnancy.\r"

A questionnaire was given to all new patients attending five general practices over four weeks, and the same questionnaire was sent by post to a random sample of adults from two of the practices. SETTING--General practices in inner London, Merseyside, and Cheshire. SUBJECTS--1532 Patients who completed questionnaires (1119 who attended the surgeries (response rate unknown) and 413 respondents to the postal survey (response rate 69%)). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Response to questionnaire on symptoms of Raynaud's phenomenon: patients were regarded as having the disease if they had episodes of blanching of the fingers that were precipitated by cold and accompanied by sensory symptoms (pins and needles or numbness). Subsequent interview and clinical appraisal of patients with the disease according to their responses to the questionnaire. RESULTS--The prevalence of Raynaud's phenomenon was 11% (26/231) and 19% (34/182) respectively in men and women who completed the postal questionnaire and 16% (56/357) and 21% (157/762) respectively in those who completed the questionnaire when attending their general practice. Thus the overall rates were slightly higher in women, but there was no effect of age even after adjustment of the rates for practice and method of survey. CONCLUSION--The prevalence of Raynaud's phenomenon is high compared with the low number of patients who seek treatment for the disease.\r"

Of the children, 63.8% were boys, 75.9% were aged under 1 year, and 23.0% were aged 1 to 2 years. The estimated number of missed opportunities for vaccination was 716 among the children (8.0% of the target population) and 11,408 among the women (59.6% of those eligible).

DESIGN--Study of all such attempts at resuscitation over 32 months, based on the standard report form for each call made by the ambulance staff and the electrocardiogram that showed the initial rhythm in each patient. SETTING--Area covered by West Yorkshire ambulance service. SUBJECTS--1196 Patients with cardiac arrests attended by 29 ambulance staff with extended training. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE--Result of resuscitation. RESULTS--The initial rhythm was asystole or electromechanical dissociation in 740 patients and ventricular fibrillation in 456 patients; overall 65 patients survived to be discharged from hospital. Sixty four of the 456 patients in whom ventricular fibrillation was the initial rhythm recorded, and 46 in whom ventricular fibrillation persisted after the ambulance staff arrived, survived. Only one of the 740 patients who initially had asystole or electromechanical dissociation survived. Factors associated with a greater chance of ventricular fibrillation occurring were: age less than 71, the arrest being witnessed by a bystander, resuscitation by a bystander, the arrest occurring in a public place, and a response time by the ambulance staff of less than six minutes. For patients found in ventricular fibrillation a shorter response time was associated with improved survival but resuscitation by a bystander was not. Additional skills learnt during extended training were used for 51 of the 65 patients who survived. CONCLUSIONS--Ambulance staff with extended training can save the lives of patients with cardiac arrest due to fibrillation, though asystole and electromechanical dissociation have a poor prognosis and should perhaps receive little attention during extended training.\r"

  ".W": "Anaemia is an important factor in the response of some human tumours to radiotherapy. The outcome is also influenced by whether the treatment is given in air or high pressure oxygen (HPO). The present study examined the relationship between anaemia and tumour response to radiation given in air or HPO in C3H mice transplanted with a mammary adenocarcinoma using a growth delay assay to assess the radiation response. Chronic anaemia was induced by the use of a low iron diet and was characterized by a significant reduction in host haematocrit and whole blood viscosity. In addition, anaemia was associated with a right shift in the oxyhaemoglobin dissociation curve and an increase in the volume doubling time of the tumour; but there was no change in the concentration of 2,3-diphosphoglycerate in the red cells. Radiation studies with these anaemic mice demonstrated that the tumour radiosensitivity was decreased when treatment was given in air. HPO was successful in overcoming the increased radioresistance associated with anaemia. This result suggested that tumours grown in anaemic mice have a higher hypoxic fraction than those grown in control mice. Changes in host physiology with chronic anaemia may contribute to the benefit seen with HPO but such alterations per se may be inadequate to maintain tumour oxygenation when treatment is given in air.\r"

  ".W": "The late effects of irradiation with single and fractionated doses of X rays (250 kV) and fast neutrons (42 MeVd----Bc), on the cutaneous and subcutaneous tissues of the pig, have been evaluated from measurements of changes in relative field length. These were determined at intervals of 26-104 weeks after irradiation. For fractionated irradiation with X rays the average fractions exponent, N, obtained from a log-log plot of iso-effect dose (ED50) against fraction number was 0.41. This was independent of the period of assessment, with no significant indication of a time factor. However, the exponent N did vary with the level of effect and was in the range 0.33-0.51. It was greatest for a greater than or equal to 10% reduction in relative field length. Assuming the validity of the linear quadratic model of cell survival, the alpha/beta ratio was 1.95 Gy. However, this model fitted the data less well for the least severe levels of damage, and for these the alpha/beta ratios were not significantly different from zero. Irradiation with fast neutrons showed a small effect of fractionation for doses given in greater than or equal to 6 fractions compared with a single dose. There was no significant increase in iso-effect dose when the dose was given in 30 fractions compared with 6 fractions. The relative biological effectiveness for late cutaneous and subcutaneous damage for the energy of fast neutrons used did not vary with the period of assessment, i.e. 26-52 weeks compared with 65-104 weeks, and was not significantly different from that previously obtained for ischaemic dermal necrosis, seen after higher doses, at 12-20 weeks after irradiation.\r"

  ".W": "Computerized tomography (CT) following the intra-arterial injection of Lipiodol (Lipiodol-CT) was performed on 60 patients suspected of having a hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Four main patterns of uptake of the Lipiodol within the liver were seen on CT. Of the 14 well circumscribed lesions with dense homogeneous uptake of Lipiodol, 13 were confirmed to be HCCs. Of the 25 lesions with dense patchy uptake of Lipiodol at the periphery and/or in the centre, 19 were confirmed to be HCCs. In 18 patients, in whom only ill defined faint patchy uptake of Lipiodol was present in the liver, or in whom no hepatic uptake was present at all, only one patient was found later to have an HCC. Of the three hypodense lesions in the liver with no Lipiodol uptake, one was found to be necrotic HCC, one a cholangiocarcinoma and one a regenerative nodule. In the diagnosis of HCC, Lipiodol-CT had an overall sensitivity of 97.1%, an accuracy of 88.3% and a specificity of 76.9%. Of the 34 patients with HCC, only 23 were solitary at diagnosis. The size of the HCCs ranged from 0.8 cm to 11 cm in diameter with the median size at 2.2 cm. Eleven of 34 HCCs (32.3%) were resectable. We conclude that, as part of a screening programme for high risk patients. Lipiodol-CT is useful in the early detection of HCCs. The technique also plays an important role in determining whether the tumour should be resected or managed with chemotherapy. By detecting HCCs while still small, the resectability rate can also be improved.\r"

Trabecular bone density (TBD) was measured for a core of the ultradistal radius; cortical bone mass per unit length (MLS) and mass per unit volume (MVS) were computed for the radius shaft. TBD, MLS and MVS peaked at the age of about 40 in females and fell by 32%, 15% and 24%, respectively, by the age of 65. In males, TBD decreased from the third decade and MLS and MVS peaked in the fourth decade. The corresponding falls by 65 years were 20%, 6% and 7%. In patients with Colles' fracture TBD and MLS were reduced by 13% and 10%, respectively, relative to age matched normal female subjects. For patients with vertebral crush fracture the reductions relative to age matched normal females were 36%, 17% and 16% for TBD, MLS and MVS. In fracture patients the deficit in TBD was significantly greater than that for cortical bone but TBD was no better at discriminating normal and osteoporotic individuals because of its larger normal range. We conclude that gamma-ray CT may best be used for monitoring changes in bone rather than as a diagnostic screening tool.\r"

  ".W": "The diagnostic accuracy of high-resolution real-time ultrasonography was prospectively studied in 240 patients admitted to the hospital with suspected acute appendicitis. The criteria for ultrasound diagnosis of appendicitis included a sausage-shaped, aperistaltic, hypoechoic structure when imaged along its longitudinal axis, with a target-like appearance on transverse section. The ultrasonographic findings were correlated with surgical-pathological outcome in 82 cases with proven appendicitis, with laparotomy findings in another 21 patients and with clinical follow-up in the remainder. The overall sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of ultrasonography in the diagnosis of acute appendicitis were 78%, 92% and 87%, respectively. The positive predictive value was 84% and the negative predictive value was 88%. Ultrasonography may significantly improve the diagnostic accuracy in patients with suspected acute appendicitis and should be performed in all patients in whom the clinical diagnosis is equivocal. The ultrasonographic findings must be interpreted in light of the clinical findings.\r"

This is a particular problem scanning at high field, as noise levels of up to 90 dB may be reached. Movement can be reduced by adequate sedation. We present the results of two sedation protocols when scanning with a 1.5T Magnetom scanner. Optimal scan quality can be achieved in up to 85% of scans using Pethco combined with triclofos in children aged 1 month-2 years, and trimeprazine combined with papaveretum in children over 2 years. When heavy sedation is used, patient selection must be cautious, and there is a minimum acceptable level of monitoring including close physical observation, electrocardiographic and apnoea monitoring.\r"

Secondarily, the clinical issues of whether the efficacy of cholesterol lowering is dependent on the treatment modality, presence of CHD at baseline, or the simultaneous introduction of other interventions was explored. All randomized clinical intervention trials of cholesterol reduction were used in an overview analysis of total mortality rate and CHD incidence; analysis was performed with weighted linear regression. The trials include those that used primary and secondary intervention, diet and drugs, and single or multifactor design. Nineteen trials were analyzed for total mortality, and of the 19, 16 were analyzed for CHD incidence rate. Net difference in cholesterol change between study groups was used as the independent variable, and the three previously mentioned dichotomous design characteristics were used as additional independent variables. For every 1% reduction in cholesterol, an estimated 2.5% reduction in CHD incidence is indicated (95% CL: 1.1, 3.9). With regard to CHD drug trials tended toward better efficiency in cholesterol lowering than did dietary trials. With regard to total mortality, this efficiency was higher in secondary than in primary preventive trials. The efficiency was also somewhat dependent on the baseline cholesterol level. This study shows that cholesterol reduction is effective in lowering CHD incidence, but cholesterol reduction must be at least 8-9% to be effective in lowering total mortality.\r"

Of these subjects, 0.8% (147) and 1% (175) were deemed to have probable intermittent claudication and possible intermittent claudication, respectively. Within the 17-year follow-up period, 38% and 40% of the probable and possible cases, respectively, died. Compared with subjects without claudication, the probable cases suffered increased mortality rates due to coronary heart disease and cerebrovascular disease, but the mortality rate due to noncardiovascular causes was not increased. Possible cases demonstrated increased mortality rates due to cardiovascular and noncardiovascular causes. This difference in mortality pattern may be due to chance. Possible and probable cases still showed increased cardiovascular and all-cause mortality rates after adjusting for coronary risk factors (cardiac ischemia at baseline, systolic blood pressure, plasma cholesterol concentration, smoking behavior, employment grade, and degree of glucose intolerance). Intermittent claudication is independently related to increased mortality rates. It is not a rare condition, and simple questionnaires exist for its detection. The latter can be usefully incorporated in cardiovascular risk assessment and screening programs.\r"

The patients from 15 centers in Sweden were randomized to sotalol (98 patients) or quinidine (85 patients) after 2 hours of sinus rhythm after direct current conversion. According to primary efficacy assessment, 52% of the patients in the sotalol group and 48% of the patients in the quinidine group remained in sinus rhythm during the following 6-month treatment period (NS). Furthermore, 34% of the patients treated with sotalol and 22% of the patients treated with quinidine relapsed into atrial fibrillation (NS). Heart rate after relapsing into atrial fibrillation was higher in the patients treated with quinidine (109 beats/min) than in the patients treated with sotalol (78 beats/min, p less than 0.001). Patients treated with sotalol were found to be less symptomatic at the time of relapse compared with relapsing patients in the quinidine group. In terms of safety, more patients were withdrawn from quinidine than from sotalol treatment (26% vs. 11%, p less than 0.05), and sotalol was generally better tolerated than quinidine. Twenty-eight percent of the patients treated with sotalol and 50% of the patients treated with quinidine reported side effects (p less than 0.01). The difference was primarily a result of early (within the first month of treatment) gastrointestinal and skin side effects in the group of patients treated with quinidine.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "To determine whether calcium channel blockers influence the progression of coronary atherosclerosis, 383 patients age 65 years or less with 5-75% stenoses in at least four coronary artery segments were selected at random within 1 month of coronary arteriography to participate in double-blind therapy with a placebo or nicardipine 30 mg three times daily. Coronary events (5 deaths, 22 myocardial infarctions, and 28 unstable anginas) occurred in 28 of 192 nicardipine patients and 23 of 191 placebo patients (p = NS). At 24 months coronary arteriography was repeated in 335 patients. Progression, defined as a 10% or more worsening in diameter stenosis, measured quantitatively, was found in 147 of 1,153 lesions (12.7%) in 168 nicardipine patients and in 170 of 1,170 lesions (14.5%) in 167 placebo patients (p = NS). Ninety-two nicardipine patients (55%) and 95 placebo patients (57%) had progression at one or more sites (p = NS). Regression, that is, an improvement by 10% or more in diameter stenosis, was seen in 140 of 2,323 lesions (6.0%) overall, with no significant intergroup difference. Among the 217 patients with 411 stenoses of 20% or less in the first study, such minimal lesions progressed in only 15 of 99 nicardipine patients compared with 32 of 118 placebo patients (15% versus 27%, p = 0.046). In this subgroup, 16 of 178 minimal lesions in nicardipine patients and 38 of 233 minimal lesions in placebo patients progressed (p = 0.038). By stepwise logistic-regression analysis, baseline systolic blood pressure (p = 0.04) and the change in systolic blood pressure between baseline and 6 months (p = 0.002) correlated with progression of minimal lesions. This suggested blood pressure reduction may account for the beneficial action of nicardipine. These results suggested nicardipine has no effect on advanced coronary atherosclerosis but may retard the progression of minimal lesions.\r"

Twenty-eight patients with New York Heart Association Functional class II or III chronic heart failure due to left ventricular systolic dysfunction were studied. All patients were maintained on a constant dose of digitalis and diuretics throughout the study. Eight weeks of therapy with nifedipine alone or in combination with ISDN resulted in a significantly higher incidence of heart failure deterioration necessitating hospitalizations and/or additional diuretics. Twenty-four percent of patients required hospitalization during nifedipine therapy and 26% required hospitalization during nifedipine-ISDN combination therapy in comparison to 0% requiring hospitalization during ISDN therapy alone. The total number of heart failure-worsening episodes was nine among patients on nifedipine, three among patients on ISDN (p less than 0.09 versus nifedipine), and 21 among patients on nifedipine-ISDN combination (p less than 0.001 versus nifedipine, p less than 0.0001 versus ISDN). Premature discontinuation of drug administration due to clinical deterioration or other side effects occurred in 29% of patients during nifedipine therapy, 5% of patients during ISDN therapy (p = 0.05 versus nifedipine), and 19% of patients during the combination therapy. A comparison of eight patients who demonstrated clinical deterioration on nifedipine with the remainder of the patients demonstrated no significant difference in left ventricular ejection fraction (0.24 +/- 0.06 versus 0.23 +/- 0.07) or maximal oxygen uptake during exercise (13 +/- 3 versus 14 +/- 2 ml/kg/min).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Atrial and ventricular trabeculae were studied. Results demonstrated a positive inotropic effect of Ang II on human cardiac muscle. Comparison of the effects of Ang II among groups indicated that the responsiveness tended to be greater in atrial and normal muscle compared with failing muscle. Results of this study also demonstrated heterogeneity in the responsiveness to Ang II among human muscles, which was not correlated with patient age, sex, diagnosis, prior treatment with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, or heart function. A significant correlation between response to Ang II and response to isoproterenol was demonstrated in failing ventricular trabeculae, which may suggest that defects in beta-adrenergic responsiveness in the failing human ventricle are accompanied by a loss of responsiveness to Ang II. Studies were extended to the Syrian cardiomyopathic hamster and its control. A dose-dependent inotropic response occurred in normal hamster ventricular muscle but was significantly diminished in cardiomyopathic muscle. Ang II did not shorten the timing of contraction, and pretreatment with adrenergic-blocking agents did not shift the dose-response curve, indicating that the response was not cyclic AMP mediated. This study demonstrates for the first time that Ang II can exert an inotropic effect directly on human cardiac muscle and confirms that there is a direct effect of Ang II on hamster cardiac muscle. The study further suggests, however, that the inotropic response to Ang II in cardiac muscle is heterogeneous and may be diminished by heart failure.\r"

  ".W": "To determine whether rotational blood flow or chiral asymmetry exists in the human descending thoracic aorta, we established the ability of color Doppler ultrasound to detect rotational flow in a tornado tube model of a vortex descending fluid column. In a model of the human aortic arch with a pulse duplicator, color Doppler was then used to demonstrate that rotational flow occurs first in the transverse arch and then in the proximal descending thoracic aorta. With the use of color Doppler esophageal echocardiography, 53 patients (age range, 25-78 years; mean age, 56.4 years) were prospectively examined for rotational flow in the descending thoracic aorta. At 10 cm superior to retro-left ventricular position, 22 of 38 patients (58%) revealed rotational flow with obvious diastolic counterclockwise rotation but less obvious systolic clockwise rotation. At 5 cm superior to retro-left ventricular position, 29 of 46 patients (63%) revealed rotational flow with a tendency toward systolic clockwise and diastolic counterclockwise rotation. At the retro-left ventricular position, 47 of 53 patients (89%) revealed rotational flow, usually of a clockwise direction, occurring in systole. Our data suggest that aortic flow is not purely pulsatile and axial but has a rotational component. Rotational flow begins in the aortic arch and is carried through to the descending thoracic aorta, where flow is chirally asymmetric with systolic clockwise and diastolic counterclockwise components. These data demonstrate an aortic rotational flow component that may have physiological implications for organ perfusion.\r"

Four patterns of blood pressure response were observed. Forty-three patients had significant exercise hypotension, with either a continuous fall in systolic blood pressure (n = 5) from the start of exercise or a sudden fall in systolic blood pressure (20-100 mm Hg; mean, 40 mm Hg) from the peak value (n = 38), 23 patients had a normal response during exercise but an abnormal blood pressure response in the recovery period, and the remaining 62 patients demonstrated a normal blood pressure response. Patients with exercise hypotension were younger (33 +/- 14 versus 46 +/- 14 years) and more of them had a family history of HCM and sudden death compared with those with a normal blood pressure response (15 of 43 versus 6 of 62 patients). Similarly, the 23 patients with abnormal recovery blood pressure responses were younger (43 +/- 16 versus 46 +/- 14 years) and had a higher incidence of a family history of sudden death (10 of 24 versus 6 of 62 patients). Left ventricular cavity dimensions were smaller in those with exercise hypotension, but 11 other clinical, echocardiographic, and arrhythmic variables were similar. To assess the mechanism of exercise hypotension, 14 patients who demonstrated exercise hypotension and 14 symptomatic patients with a normal exercise blood pressure response underwent invasive hemodynamic exercise testing.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In a set of in vivo studies, we have investigated the effects of dynamic exercise on the subset distribution of circulating lymphocytes and on the number of beta-adrenergic receptors in each of these subsets in two groups of patients. In healthy subjects, exercise increased plasma norepinephrine and epinephrine and caused lymphocytosis. Whereas the number of Thelper cells increased only modestly, the number of Tsuppressor/cytotoxic and natural killer cells more than tripled. The number of beta-adrenergic receptors varied among subsets but was not significantly altered by dynamic exercise in any subset except natural killer cells (35% increase, p = 0.0302). In a group of patients with congestive heart failure, dynamic exercise increased plasma norepinephrine but did not alter plasma epinephrine and did not cause significant lymphocytosis. We did not detect any significant alterations of circulating leukocyte subsets or beta-adrenergic receptors in any of these subsets after exercise. A combined analysis of healthy patients and heart failure patients revealed a significant correlation between increases in plasma epinephrine and increases in circulating lymphocytes. We conclude that the exercise-induced increase in beta-adrenergic receptors of mixed lymphocytes is predominantly caused by a redistribution of circulating cell subsets that differ in their beta-adrenergic receptor number. This appears to be mediated by epinephrine rather than norepinephrine.\r"

  ".W": "Anginal chest pain in patients with angiographically normal coronary arteries may be caused by a limited coronary flow response to stress because of abnormal function of the coronary microcirculation (microvascular angina). Studies of forearm arterial function suggested that patients with microvascular angina may have a diffuse disorder of smooth muscle tone. Because dyspnea is common in these patients and seems disproportionate to the severity of myocardial ischemia, we studied air flow (forced expiratory volume in 1 second, or FEV1) in the basal state and after methacholine inhalation to determine whether bronchial smooth muscle is affected in this syndrome. Five of 36 patients with microvascular angina had a basal FEV1 of less than 70% of that predicted and did not receive methacholine. Of the remaining 31 patients, 14 (45%) had a more-than-20% reduction in FEV1 after methacholine inhalation (as much as 25 mg/ml), a response significantly greater than that of nine patients with heart disease (0%, p less than 0.025) and 24 normal volunteers of similar age and gender distribution (13%, p less than 0.025). Furthermore, the product of the methacholine dose inhaled and the magnitude of decline in FEV1 from baseline (methacholine response score) was significantly lower in patients with microvascular angina than in normal volunteers (16 +/- 8.6 versus 22.2 +/- 3.7, p = 0.026). We conclude that airway hyperresponsiveness is frequently demonstrable in patients with microvascular angina; these findings are consistent with our hypothesis that this syndrome may represent a more generalized abnormality of vascular and nonvascular smooth muscle function.\r"

At present, epoprostenol sodium is an investigational drug that has limited availability. In contrast, acetylcholine, also a pulmonary vasodilator, is readily available. Therefore, we assessed the feasibility of using acetylcholine as an alternative to prostacyclin in testing for the capacity of the pulmonary vasculature to vasodilate. Twenty-three patients with primary pulmonary hypertension (mean pulmonary arterial pressure, 58.5 +/- 13.4 mm Hg) received incremental infusions of prostacyclin and acetylcholine to predetermined maximal infusion rates as part of a battery of vasodilator agents administered according to standard protocols (mean, 5.4 +/- 1.2 agents/patient; range, 3-8 agents/patient); the administration of the different agents was timed to avoid synergistic effects. Of all the agents tested, prostacyclin and acetylcholine were most consistently effective in evoking acute pulmonary vasodilation, and both seemed to distinguish patients capable of manifesting acute pulmonary vasodilation from those who were not. However, at maximal doses set by protocol, prostacyclin generally elicited a greater vasodilator response than acetylcholine. The difference in magnitude of response may have been due to use of prescribed dosages of acetylcholine that were submaximal. In other respects, the two agents were similar; both were equally well-tolerated, and side effects were mild and resolved rapidly when the vasodilator infusions were stopped. We conclude that in the majority of patients with primary pulmonary hypertension, acetylcholine appears to be an effective and available substitute for prostacyclin in screening for pulmonary vasodilator responsiveness.\r"

The resulting electrocardiographic rhythms and outcomes for each group of patients were compared for each group and also compared with results during the prior 2 years, a period when similar patients primarily received sodium bicarbonate as initial adjunctive therapy. Asystole occurred after defibrillation with threefold frequency after repeated injection of lidocaine (15 of 59, 25%) compared with patients treated with epinephrine (four of 55, 7%) (p less than 0.02). There was no difference in the proportion of patients resuscitated after treatment with either lidocaine or epinephrine (51 of 106, 48% vs. 50 of 93, 54%) and in the proportion surviving (18, 19% vs. 21, 20%), respectively. Resuscitation (64% vs. 50%, p less than 0.005) but not survival rates (24% vs. 20%) were higher during the prior 2-year period in which initial adjunctive drug treatment for persistent ventricular fibrillation primarily consisted of a continuous infusion of sodium bicarbonate. The negative effect of lidocaine or epinephrine treatment was explained in part by their influence on delaying subsequent defibrillation attempts. Survival rates were highest (30%) in a subset of patients who received no drug therapy between shocks. We conclude that currently recommended doses of epinephrine and lidocaine are not useful for improving outcome in patients who persist in ventricular fibrillation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Differentiation of monomorphic ventricular tachycardia from polymorphic ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation was possible by mean magnitude-squared coherence, less possible by rate, and not possible by beat-to-beat irregularity. Faster monomorphic ventricular tachycardia overlapped with rates of polymorphic ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation. Differentiation of polymorphic ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation was not possible by rate or irregularity.

We noted that in comparison with the initial balloon occlusion the second occlusion was characterized by less subjective anginal discomfort, less ST segment shift (0.44 +/- 0.13 versus 0.21 +/- 0.07 mV, p = 0.01), and lower mean pulmonary artery pressure (25 +/- 1.0 versus 20 +/- 1.7 mm Hg, p = 0.005). In addition, for the same heart rate-blood pressure product, cardiac vein flow during the second inflation was significantly lower than that recorded during the first inflation (96 +/- 1.4 versus 83 +/- 2.4 ml/min, p = 0.005). Finally, there was significantly less myocardial lactate production during the second inflation (lactate extraction ratio: first inflation, -0.11 +/- 0.03; second inflation, -0.03 +/- 0.02; p = 0.04). We conclude that the lessened clinical, electrocardiographic, hemodynamic, and metabolic evidence of myocardial ischemia during the second of two periods of coronary artery occlusion during percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty supports the concept of adaptation to myocardial ischemia (ischemic preconditioning).\r"

The study group comprised 10 patients with unstable angina pectoris, 18 patients with an evolving acute myocardial infarction, and 20 patients with postinfarction angina.

However, thrombus accumulation then resulted in a significant increase in percent diameter stenosis to 83 +/- 17% (p less than 0.001); a corresponding significant reduction in coronary flow also occurred by TIMI grade. After administration of intracoronary urokinase (mean dose, 141,000 units; range, 100,000-250,000 units during an average period of 34 minutes), with additional PTCA, mean percent diameter stenosis significantly decreased to 34 +/- 17% (p less than 0.001); a correspondingly significant improvement in mean coronary flow by TIMI grade occurred to 2.9 +/- 0.2. Overall, the angiographic success rate was 90%. There were no ischemic events requiring repeat PTCA and no procedure-related myocardial infarctions or deaths before hospital discharge. One patient was referred for urgent coronary artery bypass graft surgery after a successful PTCA.

In humans we evaluated the effect of local theophylline, which was infused into the brachial artery at the rate of 100 micrograms/100 cc/min, on the arteriolar sympathetic vasoconstriction induced by applying a lower-body negative pressure. Forearm blood flow changes were measured by strain-gauge venous plethysmography. Theophylline, which at this dosage blunted the vasodilator effect of adenosine (the physiological agonist for the P1 purinoceptor), significantly increased lower-body negative pressure-mediated vasoconstriction. To evaluate whether neurotransmitters different from norepinephrine participate in the vasoconstrictor effect of theophylline, we repeated the previous experiment in the presence of phenoxybenzamine, which was infused at a dose (60 micrograms/100 cc/min) that abolished the vasoconstrictor effect of norepinephrine. Also, after alpha-adrenoceptor blockade, theophylline continued to increase sympathetic vasoconstriction.

Eighteen patients (group 1) had smooth coronary arteries, 25 patients had irregular coronary arteries with 50% or less stenosis (group 2), and 35 patients had obstructive CAD (group 3). Even though the calculated valve area was similar in all three study groups, group 1 patients had higher values for ejection fraction (65 +/- 9%, 51 +/- 17%, and 48 +/- 13%; p = 0.0002), systolic mass-to-volume ratio (9.2 +/- 3.9, 5.6 +/- 2.8, and 5.2 +/- 2.2; p = 0.0001), and cardiac index (2.9 +/- 0.7, 2.5 +/- 0.7, and 2.3 +/- 0.6 l/min.min2; p = 0.015) than patients in groups 2 and 3, respectively (mean +/- SD). Mean circumferential wall stress was inversely related to severity of CAD. Multivariate analysis showed that CAD is an independent predictor of ejection fraction and mass-to-volume ratio in this group of patients. Thus, in an elderly population with severe aortic stenosis, patients with both obstructive and nonobstructive CAD have an increased incidence of left ventricular enlargement and systolic dysfunction.\r"

Mapping data were analyzed and averaged (129.7 +/- 26.5 beats) for 160 seconds, and the signal-averaged beat was filtered with a bidirectional bandwidth (80-250 Hz) digital filter.

  ".W": "Ten consecutive patients with recurrent episodes of symptomatic, idiopathic, sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia (VT) originating in the right ventricle underwent an attempt at catheter ablation of the ventricular tachycardia. There were seven women and three men, with a mean age of 39 +/- 14 years (+/- SD). None of the patients had any evidence of structural heart disease. The VT had a left bundle branch block configuration and an inferior axis in each patient, and the mean cycle length was 313 +/- 75 msec. Based on the methods of induction of the VT and the response of the VT to verapamil, the VT mechanism was presumed to be reentry in six patients, triggered activity in three patients, and catecholamine-sensitive automaticity in one patient. Sites for ablation were guided by pace mapping, and an appropriate target site was identified in the right ventricular outflow tract in each patient. From one to three shocks of 100-360 J (mean total, 336 +/- 195 J) were delivered from a defibrillator between the tip of the ablation catheter (cathode) and a patch electrode on the anterior chest (anode). An electrophysiology test 7-9 days after ablation demonstrated that VT was still inducible in only one patient, who was treated with amiodarone. One other patient had a recurrence of VT 3 weeks after ablation and was treated with verapamil. Eight of 10 patients were not treated with antiarrhythmic medications and have had no episodes of symptomatic VT during 15-68 months of follow-up (mean follow-up, 33 +/- 18 months). There were no acute or long-term complications.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The long-term clinical course and results of biopsies in 21 patients studied with monoclonal antimyosin antibodies more than 12 months after heart transplantation according to the presence and degree of antimyosin-antibody uptake is described. Eighteen men and three women aged 20-52 years (39 +/- 9 years) were studied with antimyosin antibodies 12-40 months (mean, 22 +/- 9 months) after heart transplantation, and followed for a mean of 18 months (10-28 months). The number of biopsies performed during follow-up was 102. Results showed normal antimyosin-antibody studies in nine patients and abnormal studies in 12 patients. Myocyte damage was identified in 18 of the 102 biopsies (17.6%), one in the normal antimyosin-antibody group of patients and 17 in those patients with myocardial antimyosin-antibody uptake. Patients who developed rejection comprised 11% and 67% of each respective group; the mean number of rejection episodes per patient was 0.11 +/- 0.33 and 1.41 +/- 1.41, respectively (p less than 0.01). A trend was noted by which higher heart-to-lung ratios were associated with greater probability of rejection. Conclusively, 1) antimyosin-antibody studies performed after more than 1 year after heart transplantation indicate the presence and level of rejection activity, 2) groups of patients at risk for developing rejection at biopsy during long-term follow-up may be detected by antimyosin-antibody study, and 3) surveillance for rejection and the degree of immunosuppression should be tailored to meet individual patient needs.\r"

Left ventricular short-axis and apical four-chamber views were computer digitized and divided into six segments, and radial chord shortening and area ejection fraction were calculated. Global ejection fraction fell at race finish (51% versus 46%, p less than 0.05) but recovered by 1 day (54%, p less than 0.01 by repeated-measures analysis of variance). With the apical four-chamber view, midseptal and apical-septal motion were reduced at race finish but returned to baseline during recovery (midseptal radial chord shortening: 21%, 8%, 22%; apical-septal radial chord shortening: 27%, 12%, 25%; midseptal area ejection fraction: 39%, 30%, 40%; apical-septal area ejection fraction: 44% baseline, 33% race finish, 43% recovery; all p less than 0.01). In contrast, with the parasternal short-axis view, wall motion did not change at race finish but tended to be elevated during recovery and became significant for anteroseptal motion (radial chord shortening: 29%, 30%, 36%; area ejection fraction: 49% baseline, 51% race finish, 58% recovery; both p less than 0.05). Lateral wall motion was unchanged. In addition, an index of septal curvature was calculated using the ratio of the septal-lateral wall minor axis to the perpendicular anteroposterior minor axis. At all three data collections, this ratio remained close to 1.0 at end systole and end diastole.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The effect of nontransmural necrosis on epicardial potential distributions was studied in 13 dogs. In previous studies, left ventricular epicardial pacing generated epicardial potential maps at QRS onset with a negative central area and two positive areas that faced the portions of the wavefront propagating along fibers. Subsequently, the positive areas expanded in a counterclockwise direction by 90 degrees to 120 degrees. In those studies, the rotatory expansion of the positive areas was tentatively attributed to the spread of excitation through deep myocardial layers, where fiber direction rotated counterclockwise from epicardium to endocardium. To test this hypothesis, we tried to interrupt the counterclockwise expansion of the positive area by creating localized, nontransmural necrosis at various depths in the left ventricular wall by injection of formalin or application of laser energy. Epicardial potential maps were obtained from a grid of 12 x 15 electrodes on a 44 x 56-mm area. Epicardial pacing from selected sites generated epicardial maps in which some positive areas were missing compared with controls. The direction of the straight line joining the pacing site to the site of missing positivity correlated well with the average fiber direction in the necrotic mass (r = 0.82, p less than 0.01). Angle between epicardial fiber direction and the straight line described above correlated well with the average depth of the necrosis, expressed as percent of the wall thickness (r = 0.95, p less than 0.01). These data support the hypothesis that the counterclockwise expansion of the epicardial positivity occurring after epicardial pacing results from excitation spreading along deep fibers.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Certain biphasic waveforms require less energy to defibrillate than do monophasic pulses of equal duration, although the mechanisms of this increased effectiveness remain unclear. This study used strength-duration and percent success curves for defibrillation with monophasic and biphasic truncated exponential waveforms to explore these mechanisms. In part 1, defibrillation thresholds were determined for both high- and low-tilt waveforms. The monophasic pulses tested ranged in duration from 1.0 to 20.0 msec, and the biphasic waveforms had first phases of either 3.5 or 7.0 msec and second phases ranging from 1.0 to 20.0 msec. In part 2, defibrillation percent success curves were constructed for 6.0 msec/6.0 msec biphasic waveforms with a constant phase-one amplitude and with phase-two amplitudes of approximately 21%, 62%, 94%, and 141% of phase one. This study shows that if the first phase of a biphasic waveform is held constant and the second phase is increased in either duration or amplitude, defibrillation efficacy first improves, then declines, and then again improves. For pulse durations of at least 14 msec, the second-phase defibrillation threshold voltage of a high-tilt biphasic waveform is higher than that of a monophasic pulse equal in duration to the biphasic second phase (p less than 0.05), indicating that the previously proposed hypothesis of stimulation by the second phase is not the sole mechanism of biphasic defibrillation. These facts indicate the importance of the degree of tilt for the defibrillation efficacy of biphasic waveforms and suggest at least two mechanisms exist for defibrillation with these waveforms, one that is more effective for smaller second phases and another that becomes more effective as the second phase is increased.\r"

  ".W": "The mechanism by which treatment with thrombolytic agents causes bleeding is not known. Recently, frequency of bleeding events has been shown to correlate with bleeding time, particularly in individuals treated with aspirin. We examined the effects of streptokinase (20,000-60,000 IU/kg) on bleeding time in 40 rabbits pretreated with aspirin, a model for fibrinolytic therapy. We then tested the effects of 1-desamino-8-D-arginine vasopressin (DDAVP) (0.3 microgram/kg), an agent known to reduce bleeding time in a variety of bleeding disorders, in 20 rabbits and compared the results with those of a control group of rabbits receiving normal saline placebo. Aspirin increased the bleeding time from a baseline mean +/- SEM value of 119 +/- 15 to 191 +/- 34 seconds in the control group and from 114 +/- 6 to 188 +/- 18 seconds in the experimental group. The addition of streptokinase increased the bleeding time to 592 +/- 119 seconds in the control group and 810 +/- 114 seconds in the experimental group (p = NS). Subsequent infusion of DDAVP decreased the bleeding time in the experimental group to 302 +/- 29 seconds (p less than 0.01 versus streptokinase) compared with 572 +/- 79 seconds (p = NS versus streptokinase) in the control animals given saline placebo. In a subset of rabbits receiving aspirin and streptokinase (40,000-60,000 IU/kg), samples were obtained for platelet aggregation (n = 16), von Willebrand factor antigen concentration (n = 17), and von Willebrand factor multimer distribution (n = 14). Maximal rates of ADP-induced platelet aggregation were not affected by DDAVP infusion, nor was the plasma concentration of von Willebrand factor antigen, quantified by an immunoradiometric assay, significantly affected by DDAVP infusion. Furthermore, the von Willebrand factor multimer ratio decreased with DDAVP administration. These findings indicate that aspirin and streptokinase combined result in a marked increase in bleeding time that can be reduced by DDAVP. This effect of DDAVP is not accompanied by an increase in platelet aggregation response, plasma von Willebrand factor antigen concentration, or von Willebrand factor multimer ratio.\r"

  ".W": "In a canine model of reperfused myocardial infarction, we tested the hypothesis that after reperfusion, technetium-99m-hexakis-2-methoxyisobutyl isonitrile (Tc-MIBI) tomographic imaging still reflects occlusion blood flow when the tracer is injected before reperfusion. Nine anesthetized dogs underwent 2 hours of coronary occlusion followed by 3 hours of reperfusion ending by being killed. Reference coronary blood flow was determined by radioactive microspheres injected during occlusion and after reperfusion. Biopsies in normal and ischemic myocardium and single photon emission computed tomography were obtained during occlusion and after reperfusion. Circumferential profiles were applied to axial slices divided into 5-degree sectors. The sectors were divided into 3 groups selected on the occlusion acquisition (normal, mildly reduced, and severely reduced) and compared with the postreperfusion acquisition. Tissular Tc-MIBI kinetics was assessed both by Tc-MIBI time-activity curves of normal and ischemic tissue obtained by biopsy and by the relative gradient between normal, ischemic, and necrotic postmortem tissue samples. In biopsy samples, Tc-MIBI content remained unchanged during occlusion and after reperfusion in normal as well as in ischemic tissue (4,662 +/- 2,237 counts/min/mg vs. 4,599 +/- 1,577 counts/min/mg in normal tissue, NS; 941 +/- 903 counts/min/mg vs. 1,087 +/- 721 counts/min/mg in ischemic tissue, NS). In postmortem tissue samples, there was a good correlation between occlusion microsphere blood flow and Tc-MIBI activity (r = 0.91). In the necrotic samples, mean normalized Tc-MIBI activity (10 +/- 17%) was slightly higher than the normalized microsphere blood flow (3 +/- 3%, p less than 0.001) but markedly lower than the normalized microsphere reperfusion blood flow (63 +/- 31%, p less than 0.001). Comparing the single photon emission computed tomographic acquisitions before and after reperfusion, Tc-MIBI activity remained unchanged in normal as well as in mildly reduced or severely reduced segments. Thus, our data are consistent with the hypothesis that Tc-MIBI traces blood flow, does not redistribute significantly despite reperfusion, and can be used for imaging the area at risk.\r"

To determine whether endothelial dysfunction occurs after relatively brief periods of moderate low-flow ischemia in vivo, open-chest swine were subjected to 15 minutes of critical, subtotal left anterior descending coronary artery occlusion (80%) followed by 60 minutes of reperfusion. Serial measurements of regional coronary flow were made with the radiolabeled microsphere technique. After 60 minutes of reperfusion, the left anterior descending coronary artery was excised together with a section of the normally perfused left circumflex coronary artery to examine in vitro the relaxations to the endothelium-dependent dilators ADP and bradykinin and to the endothelial-independent dilators sodium nitroprusside and adenosine. Contractions to serotonin in quiescent rings were also examined. Endocardial and transmural blood flows recovered to preocclusion levels within 60 minutes of reperfusion, as did the epicardial-to-endocardial ratio. Vascular responses in isolated, reperfused left anterior descending coronary artery rings were significantly different from responses in control left circumflex coronary artery rings. Endothelium-dependent relaxations to adenosine diphosphate and bradykinin were significantly depressed in the left anterior descending coronary artery rings compared with left circumflex coronary artery rings (p less than 0.05). Serotonin-induced contractions were significantly greater in occluded-reperfused left anterior descending than in left circumflex coronary arteries (p less than 0.05). Relaxations to adenosine and sodium nitroprusside were not significantly different between the two groups.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Freshly dissected rabbit thoracic aortas and dog carotid arteries were mounted in a muscle bath-perfusion chamber and perfused at 80 mm Hg. The proximal half of each aorta was dilated with a 5-mm (41 +/- 6% stretch), 6-mm (64 +/- 6% stretch), or 8-mm (97 +/- 9% stretch) balloon angioplasty catheter, and the uninjured half of each vessel served as the control. The vasoconstrictor behavior of the dilated segment was then assessed by dose-response testing; long-axis, ultrasonic imaging combined with computerized edge-detection image processing was used to measure changes in segmental internal vessel diameters that were induced by phenylephrine. A similar series of experiments was performed in dog carotid arteries with 5-mm balloon catheters (42 +/- 2% stretch) to compare the susceptibility to smooth muscle injury between elastic (aortic) and muscular (carotid) arteries. Additional experiments were performed to determine the roles of prolonged (30 minutes) balloon inflation and arterial precontraction on smooth muscle injury after balloon angioplasty. In rabbit aortas, the dilated arterial segments demonstrated normal reactivity to phenylephrine after dilatation with 5- and 6-mm balloons (p = NS versus control). Severe smooth muscle injury (histopathologically) with \"arterial paralysis\" was observed after severe stretch (8-mm balloon) and after 5-mm balloon dilatation (46 +/- 5% stretch) in precontracted vessels. Prolonged balloon inflations did not impair aortic vasoconstrictor behavior. Dog carotid (muscular) arteries demonstrated angioplasty-induced smooth muscle injury with less severe degrees of stretch (47-52% stretch). Geometric modeling suggests that medial stretching during balloon angioplasty of diseased vessels in vivo is in the range of 15-41%.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

During the 7-minute occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery below its first diagonal branch, 60 epicardial unipolar electrograms were recorded simultaneously at 1-minute intervals by a computerized mapping system. ST alternans was found in the eight dogs we observed. The amplitude of ST alternans (difference in the ST segment elevation of two consecutive electrograms) was greater in dogs with ventricular fibrillation (n = 4) than in those without it (n = 4) (3.92 +/- 1.24 versus 0.58 +/- 0.49 mV, p less than 0.05). Three of the four dogs with ventricular fibrillation demonstrated discordant ST alternans (i.e., adjacent leads were out of phase). Results from the present study indicate that an increased amplitude and discordance of ST alternans during acute myocardial ischemia are related to ventricular fibrillation and act as indicators of time and spatial unevenness of ventricular repolarization.\r"

  ".U": "91055301\r", 
  ".W": "A model of proliferative human restenosis was developed in domestic pigs by using deep injury to the coronary arterial media. Metal wire coils were delivered percutaneously to the coronary arteries of 11 pigs with an oversized, high-pressure (14 atm) balloon and were left in place for times ranging from 28 to 70 days. During placement, the balloon expanded the coils and delivered them securely within the arterial lumen. Light microscopic examination of the vessels confirmed fracture of the internal elastic lamina by the coil. An extensive proliferative response occurred in 10 of the 11 pigs and was associated with a luminal area narrowing of at least 50% in all but one pig. The histopathologic features of the proliferative response were identical to those observed in human cases of restenosis after angioplasty. Immunohistochemical studies confirmed the prominence of smooth muscle cells in the proliferative tissue. A similar response was obtained in two of five porcine coronary arteries in which balloon inflation only was performed, without coil implant. This model is practical and inexpensive and closely mimics the proliferative portion of human restenosis both grossly and microscopically. Thus, it may be useful for understanding human restenosis and for testing therapies aimed at preventing restenosis after balloon angioplasty or other coronary interventional procedures.\r"

  ".U": "91055302\r", 
  ".W": "Previous studies have suggested that Wenckebach periodicity in cardiac tissues may occur because of discontinuous propagation across junctional areas in which there is high intercellular resistivity or different cell types. Under these conditions, the impulse may stop altogether at a given junction, or may renew its propagation but only after a step delay imposed by the diastolic time-dependent recovery in the excitability of cells distal to that junction. Accordingly, Wenckebach periodicity in the atrioventricular node may be explained in terms of electrotonically mediated delay in the activation of the nodal cells. To test this hypothesis, we have studied recovery of excitability, and susceptibility to rate-dependent activation failure in single myocytes isolated from the adult rabbit atrioventricular node. Recordings were obtained by using the patch technique in the whole-cell, current clamp configuration. Repetitive stimulation of single atrioventricular nodal myocytes with depolarizing current pulses of critical amplitude yielded frequency-dependent stimulus response patterns that ranged from 1:1, through various Wenckebachlike periodicities (e.g., 5:4 and 4:3) to 2:1 and 3:1. Both typical and atypical Wenckebach structures were demonstrated, as well as \"complex\" patterns (e.g., reverse Wenckebach or alternating Wenckebach) previously ascribed to multiple levels of block. The diastolic recovery of excitability curve, determined by application of repetitive stimuli at cycle lengths that were longer than the action potential duration, showed a monotonic function with a refractory period outlasting the action potential duration (i.e., postrepolarization refractoriness). Abbreviation of the stimulation cycle length to values below those of the action potential duration revealed the existence of a period of supernormal excitability during the repolarizing phase of the action potential. In either case, the stimulus response patterns obtained were a direct consequence of the shape of the recovery of excitability curve. The monotonic portion of the recovery curve was fitted to an empirical equation that when iterated reproduced the stimulus response patterns observed in the atrioventricular nodal cell. Our data demonstrate that recovery of excitability after an action potential is indeed a function of the diastolic interval, and that this slow process sets the conditions for the development of Wenckebach periodicity in the atrioventricular node.\r"

  ".W": "To examine whether acute myocardial ischemia activates the coagulation system and platelet activation in the coronary circulation, we measured plasma levels of fibrinopeptide A and beta-thromboglobulin in the coronary sinus and the aortic root simultaneously in 15 patients with coronary spastic angina before and after the left coronary spasm induced by intracoronary injection of acetylcholine and in 15 patients with stable exertional angina before and after acute myocardial ischemia induced by rapid atrial pacing. Fifteen patients with chest pain but normal coronary arteries and no coronary spasm served as controls. The coronary sinus-arterial difference of fibrinopeptide A increased markedly (p less than 0.001) from 0.1 +/- 0.2 to 4.3 +/- 0.7 ng/ml after the anginal attacks in the coronary spastic angina group. However, fibrinopeptide A levels remained unchanged after the attacks in the stable exertional angina group and after intracoronary injection of acetylcholine in the control group. Plasma beta-thromboglobulin levels remained unchanged after the attacks in both patient groups and after acetylcholine in the control group. Our data indicate that coronary spasm induces thrombin generation and may lead to thrombus formation in the coronary artery involved, but pacing-induced ischemia does not activate the coagulation system.\r"

  ".W": "Recent studies demonstrate that endothelin, a potent endogenous vasoconstrictor peptide, circulates in plasma of normal animals and humans. However, the role of this peptide in pathophysiological states remains unclear. The present study was designed to test the hypothesis that circulating endothelin concentrations are increased in experimental congestive heart failure (CHF), a pathophysiological state characterized by activation of vasoconstrictor mechanisms. In anesthetized dogs with CHF produced by 8 days of rapid ventricular pacing (n = 28), circulating plasma endothelin was increased compared with values for normal controls (n = 28; 20.4 +/- 1.4 versus 9.7 +/- 0.9 pg/ml, respectively; p less than 0.0001). A plasma endothelin level of more than 14.0 was a sensitive and specific indicator of significant CHF. Moreover, within the group with experimental CHF, right atrial pressure and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure correlated independently with circulating endothelin levels. Based on recent studies demonstrating the physiological actions of twofold increases in circulating endothelin, as observed in the present study, a possible role for endothelin in the pathophysiology of CHF is advanced.\r"

Although prolongation of repolarization carries with its own tendency for pause-dependent arrhythmogenesis (i.e., torsade de pointes), available data suggest that this may be a function of nonspecificity in potassium channel block rather than a general characteristic of class III activity. The availability of new and more selective blockers of specific cardiac potassium channels under development as class III agents have already helped to clarify basic questions about the ionic mechanism of repolarization in the heart, and one hopes that a growing clinical data base will eventually determine the relative safety and efficacy of these agents in preventing symptomatic and life-threatening arrhythmias.\r"

In addition, the 450 microsecond pulse duration produced by this laser approximates the thermal relaxation time for dermal blood vessels thereby confining the energy to the target. This new laser effects excellent lightening of port-wine stain (PWS) in infants and young children without the adverse complications of hypertrophic scarring, permanent pigmentation abnormality, or textural changes, complications often seen with conventional laser systems. The FLPDL now permits treatment of this patient population expected to gain the most benefit from early laser therapy in a much safer manner, before the psychological complications of being a \"marked\" person develop. The purpose of this report is to: (1) describe the theoretical considerations behind achieving selective removal of PWS that can be understood and used by a nonsurgically-oriented practitioner; and (2) describe the practical application of the device used in the clinical management of infants and young children.\r"

The common neurologic problems in our patients were alterations in consciousness (40.7%) and convulsions (35.1%). When BUN concentration was above 135 mg/dl and creatinine clearance was below 8 m/min/1.73 m2, alteration of consciousness was observed and when BUN concentration was 200 mg/dl and creatinine clearance was below 7 m/min/1.73 m2, abnormal convulsives appeared. Changes in deep tendon reflexes and pathologic reflexes were associated with hypertension. All of the patients with cortical atrophy using computerized cranial tomography aluminum hydroxide at least for 18 months, and six of them had hemodialysis. Fourteen patients who underwent dialysis developed convulsions and were thought to have disequilibrium syndrome. These findings are consistent with the suggestion that the metabolic and biochemical derangements associated with CRF may be particularly detrimental to the still developing CNS of the child.\r"

Organic mental disorders are very frequent in AIDS, particularly with seriously ill patients who are medical inpatients. There is a high priori probability that such common symptoms as agitation, irritability, and insomnia will be caused by an organic mental disorder. Psychopharmacology in the patient with AIDS requires considerable caution. Lower doses and careful surveillance for subtle neuropsychiatric side effects are necessary. Routine medical contact with a compassionate physician may be of inestimable value to the patient in coping with the fear and dread that surround the illness.\r"

  ".W": "Some authors describe acute bacterial prostatitis as a self-limiting disease, and as with any other acute septic condition, parenteral broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy is indicated. Chronic bacterial prostatitis, however, is associated with a causative organism persisting unaltered in prostatic fluid and leading to relapsing urinary tract infections. In the 1970s, several workers produced a classification system and bacteriologic localization cultures for establishing the diagnosis of prostatitis. Krieger and Crawford point to an important factor that is omitted in many clinical trials with episodes of chronic bacterial prostatitis in men. If localization studies of the prostate infection are attempted in the presence of bacteriuria, the urine must be sterilized with nitrofurantoin or penicillin G. Urine cultures obtained from first-voided urine, bladder urine, and urine voided after prostatic massage should show no growth, and the expressed prostatic secretion can then be examined for evidence of prostatic infection. This procedure reduces the contamination of the expressed prostatic secretion by the organism from the urinary tract infection. This is important, because antibiotic treatment is determined by the sensitivity of the organism isolated from the prostate as well as by the ability of the antibiotics to penetrate the prostate. Meares outlines the pharmacokinetic features needed for drug diffusion into prostatic fluid and provides detailed information on the physical characteristics of the prostate during acute and chronic bacterial prostatitis. Unfortunately, the choice of an ideal drug cannot be extrapolated from this information because pharmacodynamic principles cannot predict clinical efficacy. Some authors find that sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim has the best cure rate in the treatment of chronic bacterial prostatitis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Based on eye examination results, the families were divided into 2 groups. In a first group of 34 families, all 61 members diagnosed as having polyps and 13 of the 33 patients at risk had 4 or more lesions distributed in both eyes. By contrast, in a second group of 18 families, all 32 polyposis patients and all 18 members at risk had less than 4 lesions. Extra-colonic manifestations were present in 26 of 34 families in the first group and in 11 of 18 families in the second group. Data on one family with ambiguous ancestry were reviewed separately. The existence of 4 or more CHRPE lesions distributed in both eyes seems to be a congenital marker for FAP, present in 65.4 percent of families. When present in a family: 1) it is found in all diagnosed patients in that family, 2) can therefore be considered predictive for the development of polyps in other family members who carry the trait, and 3) if confirmed by longer follow-up, may possibly preclude members without the trait from further evaluation and surveillance.\r"

According to the electromyographic investigation, the patients could be divided into three main groups: 1) normal sphincter reaction; 2) paradoxical sphincter reaction; and 3) combined reaction. Group A was characterized by a marked reduction of muscular activity during emptying and a pronounced closing reflex after emptying. This was followed by return of normal tonic activity. Patients in group B had no relaxation of the sphincters during emptying but a pronounced increased activity in the external sphincter and the puborectalis muscle. They also had severe emptying difficulties at defecography. No closing reflex was seen. In group C the electrical activity in the sphincters increased during moderate straining and when emptying was complete a clear closing reflex was seen. In this study, a dynamic visualization of the defecation together with a registration of electromyographic activity in the striated anal sphincters was performed. It was shown that patients with paradoxical sphincter reaction were lacking a closing reflex after emptying was complete. This has not been reported previously and is important evidence for the paradoxical defecation pattern. It was also shown that the patients with rectoceles had paradoxical sphincter reaction.\r"

Of the 14 infants presenting with an abscess, in 12 (85.7 percent), a fistula-in-ano was discovered at surgery. In contrast, in the group of 18 children older than 2 years of age, there were 7 females and 11 males, and fistulas were identified in only 7 of 13 patients (54.8 percent) who presented with abscesses. Surgical treatment consisted of examination under anesthesia and a diligent search for a fistulous tract. Abscesses were primarily saucerized and fistulotomy and cryptotomy of the confluent crypt was performed if a fistulous tract was identified. The only recurrences with this form of treatment occurred in the two immunocompromised patients.\r"

Of these patients, 25 were treated by surgery alone and 36 were given preoperative radiotherapy. The total dose was 42.6 Gy, (30.6 Gy [1.8 Gy/fr x 5/week]) delivered to the entire pelvis plus an additional 12 Gy (3.0 Gy/fr x 4/week) delivered to the primary tumor. Of 36 patients, 21 were administered intratumor injections of peplomycin and bromodeoxyuridine at the time of boost radiation and 15 were treated without intratumor injections. During the follow-up period (3 to 9 years), in the groups of patients who underwent radiation, there was only one local failure (2.8 percent). In contrast, in the group of patients treated by surgery alone, eight local failures occurred (32 percent). The intratumor injection significantly enhanced the effect of radiation on tumor regression. The incidence of positive lymph nodes was higher in patients in the surgery alone group than it was in the groups treated with radiation. There was no difference in the rate of distant metastasis among the three treatment groups. The five-year survival rate for the radiation with intratumor injection group, radiation alone group, and surgery alone group, was 77.8, 69.2, and 56.0 percent, respectively. No severe complication was experienced.\r"

Erythrocyte fatty acid profiles were determined by gas liquid chromatography. Neither age, sex, Dukes' stage, nor degree of differentiation of the tumors had a significant effect on the erythrocyte saturation index. The erythrocyte saturation index was lower in patients with primary and recurrent colorectal cancer compared with control subjects and patients with inflammatory bowel disease or benign colonic polyps (P less than 0.0001). The erythrocyte saturation index was not found to be useful in the postoperative follow-up of these patients. Using both saturation index and age as a means of differentiating between patients with primary colorectal cancer and control subjects gave a sensitivity of 67 percent and a specificity of 81 percent.\r"

One hundred seven patients were proposed to perform the irrigation: 17 refused to do so with the remaining 90 able to learn the method without problems. Nearly all patients achieved full continence for at least 24 hours. Three patients refused to continue, and nine interrupted for minor complications. The median duration of irrigation in the whole group is 257 days (range, 1 to 2669 days): 32 patients have been irrigating from one to five years, and 9 patients for more than 5 years. Based on these results, we recommend irrigation as standard rehabilitative treatment for elderly patients.\r"

A hypothesis is put forward that nitrites, lowered pH, and bacterial amines are conducive to formation of carcinogenic n-nitroso compounds, which reflect a cancer risk in patients with ulcerative colitis dependent on the type and extent of inflammatory cell activation as well as metabolic impairment of colonic epithelial cells.\r"

The authors describe a patient with AIDS with intestinal perforation due to CMV infection, and review 14 additional cases reported in the English-language surgical literature. The diagnostic triad of pneumoperitoneum on x-ray, evidence or history of CMV infection, and AIDS occurred in 70 percent of patients. The most common site of intestinal perforation was the colon (53 percent), followed in frequency by the distal ileum (40 percent) and appendix (7 percent); perforation usually occurred between the distal ileum and splenic flexure of the colon. Colonoscopy, rather than sigmoidoscopy, is recommended as a screening examination in patients with AIDS suspected of having colonic ulceration due to CMV infection. Multiple biopsies of ulcerated tissue should be obtained. Gross and microscopic analyses of involved intestinal tissue reveal the characteristic findings of ulceration and CMV infection. Despite aggressive therapy, the operative mortality rate in patients with AIDS with intestinal perforation due to CMV infection was 54 percent and the overall mortality rate was 87 percent. Postoperative complications occurred in most patients and consisted mainly of systemic sepsis and pneumonia caused by Pneumocystis carinii infection. An increased awareness of this syndrome by physicians frequently called on to manage patients with AIDS is recommended.\r"

  ".W": "During the past two decades, an explosive growth in both the prevalence and types of sexually transmitted diseases has occurred. Up to 55 percent of homosexual men with anorectal complaints have gonorrhea; 80 percent of the patients with syphilis are homosexuals. Chlamydia is found in 15 percent of asymptomatic homosexual men, and up to one third of homosexuals have active anorectal herpes simplex virus. In addition, a host of parasites, bacterial, viral, and protozoan are all rampant in the homosexual population. Furthermore, the global epidemic of AIDS has produced a plethora of colorectal manifestations. Acute cytomegalovirus ileocolitis is the most common indication for emergency abdominal surgery in the homosexual AIDS population. Along with cryptosporidia and isospora, the patient may present to the colorectal surgeon with bloody diarrhea and weight loss before the diagnosis of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) disease. Other patients may present with colorectal Kaposi's sarcoma or anorectal lymphoma, and consequently will be found to have seropositivity for HIV. However, in addition to these protean manifestations, one third of patients with AIDS consult the colorectal surgeon with either condylomata acuminata, anorectal sepsis, or proctitis before the diagnosis of HIV disease. Although aggressive anorectal surgery is associated with reasonable surgical results in some asymptomatic HIV positive patients, the same procedures in AIDS (symptomatic HIV positive) patients will often be met with disastrous results. It is incumbent upon the surgeon, therefore, to recognize the manifestations of HIV disease and diagnose these conditions accordingly.\r"

We observed a population of cells within the bone marrow which produce bone-specific or bone-related proteins. The production of these proteins was developmentally regulated in human long-term bone marrow cell cultures; the bone protein-producing cells (BPPC) are observed under serum-free, short-term culture conditions, respond to bone-related and not hematopoietic growth factors, and are derived from a population of low-density, nonadherent, My10-negative (or low My10 density), marrow cells (My10 is an antigen found on most hematopoietic progenitor cells). Cultivation of marrow-derived BPPC in secondary, serum-containing cultures results in their differentiation into osteoblastlike cells. At this stage of development, BPPC produce an extracellular matrix which incorporates both bone-related proteins and radiolabeled calcium. Human bone marrow BPPC thus represent a newly described cell phenotype important to both bone and hematopoietic cell biology.\r"

A cysteine-rich, highly glycosylated 30-kD TNF-binding protein (TNF-BP) purified from urine may have a role in regulation because it protects in vitro against the biological effects of TNF. The cytotoxic effect of TNF on the fibrosarcoma cell line WEHI 164 was inhibited by 50% at a 10-fold excess of TNF-BP. The binding of TNF to the receptor was partially reversed after the addition of TNF-BP. Results from biosynthetic labeling of cells with 35S-cysteine followed by immunoprecipitation with anti-TNF-BP indicated that TNF-BP is formed and released at the cell surface by cleavage because no corresponding cellular polypeptide was observed. A cellular 60-kD polypeptide, which was immunoprecipitated with anti-TNF-BP, may correspond to the transmembrane TNF-receptor molecule and be the precursor of TNF-BP. Thus, TNF-BP appears to be a soluble form of a transmembrane TNF-receptor. Moreover our results demonstrate that the production of TNF-BP is increased when the TNF receptor is downregulated in cells by treatment with TNF or by activation of protein kinase C with phorbol esters. TNF-BP may be an important agent that blocks harmful effects of TNF, and, therefore, useful in clinical applications.\r"

Resting energy expenditure and plasma catecholamines were normal in all three groups. The basal rate of glycerol appearance in blood in the patients with cancer (2.96 +/- 0.45 mumol.kg-1.min-1) was similar to that in the nutritionally matched controls (3.07 +/- 0.28 mumol.kg-1.min-1), but 48% greater than in the normal-weight volunteers (2.00 +/- 0.16 mumol.kg-1.min-1) (P = 0.028). The antilipolytic effect of propranolol and the rate of triglyceride-fatty acid cycling in the patients with cancer were also similar in the cachectic control group and approximately 50% greater than in the normal-weight volunteers, but the differences were not statistically significant because of the variability in the data. We conclude that the increase in lipolysis and triglyceride-fatty acid cycling in \"unstressed\" cachectic patients with esophageal cancer is due to alterations in their nutritional status rather than the presence of tumor itself. Increased beta-adrenergic activity may be an important contributor to the stimulation of lipolysis.\r"

The present study was done to determine whether this \"neurogenic plasma extravasation\" can be inhibited by glucocorticoids, to learn the time course of this inhibition, and to determine whether glucocorticoids can prevent the potentiating effect of viral respiratory infections on neurogenic plasma extravasation. Groups of pathogen-free F344 rats were treated with dexamethasone for 2 or 8 h (4 mg/kg i.p.) or 48 or 120 h (0.5-4 mg/kg per d i.p.). Another group of rats was treated with dexamethasone for 120 h following the intranasal inoculation of Sendai virus. The magnitude of plasma extravasation produced by capsaicin or substance P was assessed after this treatment by using Monastral blue pigment and Evans blue dye as intravascular tracers. We found that dexamethasone reduced, in a dose-dependent fashion, the magnitude of plasma extravasation produced in the rat trachea by capsaicin and substance P. Significant inhibition was produced by a dose of dexamethasone as small as 0.5 mg/kg i.p. The effect of dexamethasone had a latency of several hours and reached a maximum after 2 d of treatment. Furthermore, dexamethasone prevented the potentiation of neurogenic plasma extravasation usually present after 5 d of Sendai virus respiratory infection.\r"

Defects at the uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase locus cause the human genetic disease familial porphyria cutanea tarda. A splice site mutation has been found in a pedigree with familial porphyria cutanea tarda that causes exon 6 to be deleted from the mRNA. The intron/exon junctions on either side of exon 6 fall between codons, so the resulting protein is shorter than the normal protein, missing only the amino acids coded by exon 6. The shortened protein lacks catalytic activity, is rapidly degraded when exposed to human lymphocyte lysates, and is not detectable by Western blot analysis in lymphocyte lysates derived from affected individuals. The mutation was detected in five of 22 unrelated familial porphyria cutanea tarda pedigrees tested, so it appears to be common. This is the first splice site mutation to be found at the URO-D locus, and the first mutation that causes familial porphyria cutanea tarda to be found in more than one pedigree.\r"

To assess the importance of skeletal muscle metabolism as a determinant of metabolic rate, 24-h energy expenditure, basal metabolic rate (BMR), and sleeping metabolic rate (SMR) were measured by indirect calorimetry in 14 subjects (7 males, 7 females; 30 +/- 6 yr [mean +/- SD]; 79.1 +/- 17.3 kg; 22 +/- 7% body fat), and compared to forearm oxygen uptake. Values of energy expenditure were adjusted for individual differences in fat-free mass, fat mass, age, and sex. Adjusted BMR and SMR, expressed as deviations from predicted values, correlated with forearm resting oxygen uptake (ml O2/liter forearm) (r = 0.72, P less than 0.005 and r = 0.53, P = 0.05, respectively). These findings suggest that differences in resting muscle metabolism account for part of the variance in metabolic rate among individuals and may play a role in the pathogenesis of obesity.\r"

To enhance the immunogenicity of this polysaccharide, we coupled the type III polysaccharide to tetanus toxoid. Prior to coupling, aldehyde groups were introduced on the polysaccharide by controlled periodate oxidation, resulting in the conversion of 25% of the sialic acid residues of the polysaccharide to residues of the 8-carbon analogue of sialic acid, 5-acetamido-3,5-dideoxy-D-galactosyloctulosonic acid. Tetanus toxoid was conjugated to the polysaccharide by reductive amination, via the free aldehyde groups present on the partially oxidized sialic acid residues. Rabbits vaccinated with the conjugate vaccine produced IgG antibodies that reacted with the native type III group B streptococcal polysaccharide (3/3 rabbits), while rabbits immunized with the unconjugated type III polysaccharide failed to respond (0/3 rabbits). Sera from animals receiving conjugate vaccine opsonized type III group B streptococci for phagocytic killing by human peripheral blood leukocytes, and protected mice against lethal challenge with live type III group B streptococci. The results suggest that this method of conjugation to a carrier protein may be a useful strategy to improve the immunogenicity of the type III group B Streptococcus polysaccharide in human subjects.\r"

  ".W": "Reactive oxygen species are a major cause of damage occurring in ischemic tissue after reperfusion. During reperfusion transitional metals such as iron are required for reactive oxygen species to mediate their major toxic effects. Xanthine oxidase is an important source of reactive oxygen species during ischemia-reperfusion injury, but not in all organs or species. Because cytochrome P-450 enzymes are an important pulmonary source of superoxide anion (O2-.) generation under basal conditions and during hyperoxia, and provide iron catalysts necessary for hydroxyl radical (.OH) formation and propagation of lipid peroxidation, we postulated that cytochrome P-450 might have a potential role in mediating ischemia-reperfusion injury. In this report, we explored the role of cytochrome P-450 enzymes in a rabbit model of reperfusion lung injury. The P-450 inhibitors 8-methoxypsoralen, piperonyl butoxide, and cimetidine markedly decreased lung edema from transvascular fluid flux. Cimetidine prevented the reperfusion-related increase in lung microvascular permeability, as measured by movement of 125I-albumin from the vascular space into lung water and alveolar fluid. P-450 inhibitors also prevented the increase in lung tissue levels of thiobarbituric acid reactive products in the model. P-450 inhibitors did not block enhanced O2-. generation by ischemic reperfused lungs, measured by in vivo reduction of succinylated ferricytochrome c in lung perfusate, but did prevent the increase in non-protein-bound low molecular weight chelates of iron after reperfusion. Thus, cytochrome P-450 enzymes are not likely a major source of enhanced O2-. generation, but serve as an important source of iron in mediating oxidant injury to the rabbit lung during reperfusion. These results suggest an important role of cytochrome P-450 in reperfusion injury to the lung and suggest potential new therapies for the disorder.\r"

  ".W": "Sodium-phosphate cotransport in the PTH-responsive opossum kidney (OK) cell line is inhibited by PTH, cAMP, and activators of protein kinase C. In order to probe the role of cAMP, we stably transfected OK cells with an expression vector for a cAMP-binding mutation of the murine protein kinase A regulatory subunit. Two-dimensional electrophoresis of cAMP-binding proteins from transfected cells indicated a 20-fold overexpression of the mutant regulatory unit. Protein kinase A from these cells had a 20-fold increase in the concentration of cAMP required for half-maximal activation, 2.8 microM vs. 0.15 microM for wild type cells. In the transfected cells, Na-phosphate cotransport was insensitive to up to 1 mM 8-Br-cAMP and 1 microM PTH, while these same agonists caused a significant inhibition of transport in the wild type cells. The effects on Na-phosphate cotransport of the protein kinase C activators oleoyl-acetyl glycerol and tetradecanoyl-phorbol acetate, which were marked in the wild type cells, were still present, although attenuated, in the transfected mutants. With prolonged passage, the cAMP-insensitive phenotype reverted to wild type cAMP sensitivity despite continued selection for the cotransfected neo marker. The revertant cells had a normal cAMP requirement for half-maximal activation of protein kinase A, 0.13 microM, and the PTH and cAMP-sensitive inhibition of Na-phosphate cotransport was restored. We suggest that an intact and normally cAMP-sensitive protein kinase A pathway is an absolute requirement for PTH inhibition of Na-phosphate cotransport in the OK cell.\r"

After the documentation of impaired left ventricular pump performance, radioligand binding studies of the alpha-1 adrenoreceptor, norepinephrine-stimulated phosphoinositol turnover, and ADP ribosylation of 41 kD substrate by pertussis toxin were examined in the hypertrophying unaffected myocardium. Moreover, the expression of sarcomeric actin isoforms was analyzed by Northern blots and hybridization with specific oligonucleotide probes. Alpha-1 adrenoreceptor density was found not to be altered in membranes obtained from the spared left ventricular tissue, whereas phosphoinositol turnover was increased 3.1-fold in the viable myocytes of infarcted hearts. Furthermore, pertussis toxin substrate was augmented 2.5-fold in membranes prepared from the surviving left ventricular myocardium. Finally, an upregulation of the skeletal actin isoform was detected in the tissue of the failing left ventricle. In conclusion, the possibility is raised that in the presence of severe myocardial dysfunction and ongoing reactive hypertrophy, effector pathways linked to the alpha-1 adrenoreceptor may stimulate the myocyte hypertrophic response which would tend to normalize cardiac hemodynamics. The reexpression of alpha skeletal actin may be a molecular indicator of the persistance of an overload on the myocardium.\r"

The structural changes in the arterial walls include increased production of extracellular matrix components and smooth muscle cell hypertrophy, changes that have been similarly induced by transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) in culture. In the present study, experiments were performed to determine whether TGF-beta is present in sheep lung lymph, and whether TGF-beta levels were altered in an animal model of chronic pulmonary hypertension induced by continuous air embolization. Several standard biological assays for TGF-beta activity were used for these determinations including soft agar assays, inhibition of epithelial cell proliferation, and a TGF-beta-specific radioreceptor assay. In each case, control lung lymph contained high concentrations of TGF-beta (100 ng/ml) which required transient acidification for detection. Samples of lung lymph from hypertensive sheep showed a transient and early two- to threefold increase in concentrations of latent TGF-beta. This activity could be partially blocked by TGF-beta antibodies. These studies indicate that sheep lung lymph contains TGF-beta and that the level of TGF-beta increases early during the development of pulmonary hypertension. Thus, TGF-beta may contribute to the development of the structural changes in the pulmonary arteries that occur during the onset of chronic pulmonary hypertension.\r"

A family was identified through a 37-yr-old female captain in the United States Air Force who was scrutinized only because many of her direct blood relatives had died of ruptured aortic aneurysms. The woman was heterozygous for a single-base mutation that converted the codon for glycine 619 of the alpha 1(III) chain of type III procollagen to a codon for arginine. Studies on cultured skin fibroblasts demonstrated the mutation caused synthesis of type III procollagen that had a decreased temperature for thermal unfolding of the protein. The same mutation was identified in DNA extracted from pathologic specimens from her mother who had died at the age of 34 and a maternal aunt who died at the age of 55 of aortic aneurysms. Examination of DNA from samples of saliva revealed that the woman's daughter, her son, a brother, and an aunt also had the mutation. The results demonstrated that mutations in the type III procollagen gene can cause familial aortic aneurysms and that DNA tests for such mutations can identify individuals at risk for aneurysms.\r"

To test the hypothesis that acid-induced release of secretin is mediated by a secretin-releasing factor (S-RF), anesthetized rats were prepared with pyloric ligation, duodenal and jejunal cannulas, and pancreatic duct cannulas. Donor rats were infused intraduodenally with 0.01 N HCl, 0.15 M NaCl, or a combination of 0.01 N HCl and 0.05 N NaHCO3 at 0.3 ml/min for 1.5 h, and the perfusates were collected via jejunal cannulas. The perfusates with pH adjusted to 6.0 were concentrated threefold and infused into the duodena of recipient rats. The concentrate of acid perfusate (CAP) significantly increased both pancreatic volume flow and bicarbonate output and plasma concentration of secretin, whereas concentrates of the saline perfusate (CSP) or the perfusate of a combination of 0.01 N HCl and 0.05 N NaHCO3 (CABP) did not influence pancreatic secretion or plasma concentration of secretin. The increased pancreatic secretion by CAP was attributed to increased circulating secretin because when secretin was immunoneutralized by a rabbit antisecretin serum, CAP-stimulated pancreatic secretion was abolished. The bioactivity of CAP was trypsin-sensitive and heat stable. The active substance in CAP had a molecular weight of less than 5,000 and greater than 1,000, as determined by ultrafiltration and bioassay. In conclusion, dilute HCl releases an S-RF into the upper small intestinal lumen to stimulate release of secretin. This substance, with molecular weight of less than 5,000, is heat stable and trypsin sensitive. Thus, the acid-stimulated release of secretin is mediated by a secretin-releasing peptide in the upper small intestinal lumen.\r"

However, we now find that human monocytes are as sensitive as lymphocytes to dAdo or to the ADA-resistant congener 2-chloro-2'-deoxyadenosine (CldAdo). Monocytes exposed in vitro to CldAdo, or to dAdo plus deoxycoformycin rapidly developed DNA strand breaks. Both the DNA damage and the toxicity of CldAdo or dAdo toward monocytes were blocked by deoxycytidine, but not by inhibitors of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase. A partial decrease in RNA synthesis and a gradual decline of cellular NAD were early biochemical events associated with monocyte DNA damage. Low CldAdo concentrations (5-20 nM) inhibited monocyte phagocytosis and reduced the release of interleukin 6. Higher CldAdo concentrations led to a dose- and time-dependent loss of monocyte viability. Circulating monocytes disappeared within 1 wk in patients with cutaneous T cell lymphoma or with rheumatoid arthritis during continuous CldAdo infusion. The marked sensitivity of human monocyte function and survival to CldAdo in vitro, together with the monocyte depletion in patients receiving CldAdo chemotherapy, suggests that CldAdo or other dAdo analogues offer a novel therapeutic strategy for chronic inflammatory and autoimmune diseases characterized by inappropriate monocyte deployment or function.\r"

To test this hypothesis, we have evaluated synthesis and secretion of four metalloproteinases (interstitial collagenase, stromelysin, 72-kD type IV collagenase, and 92-kD type IV collagenase) by human mononuclear phagocytes with regard to (a) the effect of cellular differentiation, (b) regulation of secretion, and (c) comparisons/contrasts with a prototype metalloproteinase-secretory cell, the human fibroblast. We found that regulated secretion of greater quantities and a wider spectrum of metalloenzymes correlated with a more differentiated cellular phenotype. As extreme examples, the 92-kD type IV collagenase was released by peripheral blood monocytes and uninduced U937 monocyte-like cells, whereas stromelysin was secreted only by lipopolysaccharide-stimulated alveolar macrophages. Macrophage production of interstitial collagenase, stromelysin, and 72-kD type IV collagenase was approximately 20%, 10%, and 1-2%, respectively, of that from equal numbers of fibroblasts; secretion of the 92-kD type IV collagenase was not shared by fibroblasts. This work confirms the potential of macrophages to directly degrade extracellular matrix via secreted metalloproteinases in a manner that differs both qualitatively and quantitatively from that of fibroblasts. Moreover, varying regulation of metalloenzyme synthesis, evidenced by distinct patterns of basal and stimulated secretion during differentiation, can be studied at a molecular level in this model system.\r"

In the present study, we have employed a new, sensitive, and specific radioimmunoassay for the direct measurement of insulin receptors in surgical specimens of breast cancers. In 159 specimens the insulin receptor content was 6.15 +/- 3.69 ng/0.1 mg protein. This value was more than sixfold higher than the mean value found in both 27 normal breast tissues obtained at total mastectomy (0.95 + 0.68, P less than 0.001) and in six normal specimens obtained from reduction mammoplasty (0.84 +/- 0.78, P less than 0.001). The insulin receptor content in breast cancer tissues was also higher than in any normal tissue investigated including liver (Pezzino, V., V. Papa, V. Trischitta, A. Brunetti, P.A. Goodman, M.K. Treutelaar, J.A. Williams, B.A. Maddux, R. Vigneri, and I.D. Goldfine, 1989. Am. J. Physiol. 257:E451-457). The insulin receptor in breast cancer retained its ability to both bind insulin and undergo insulin-induced tyrosine kinase activation. Immunostaining of the specimens revealed that the insulin receptor was present in malignant epithelial cells, but was not detected in stromal and inflammatory cells. Univariant analysis revealed that the insulin receptor content of the tumors correlated positively with tumor size (P = 0.014), histological grading (P = 0.030), and the estrogen receptor content (P = 0.035). There were no significant correlations between insulin receptor content and the age, body weight, menopausal status, and nodal involvement of the patients. These studies indicate, therefore, that the insulin receptor content is increased in breast cancers and raise the possibility that the insulin receptor may have a role in the biology of these tumors.\r"

The enzyme occurs in two major forms, beta-hexosaminidase A, composed of an alpha- and beta-subunit and beta-hexosaminidase B, composed of two beta-subunits. Both isozyme activities are deficient in Sandhoff disease, owing to mutations of the HEXB gene encoding the common beta-subunit. We have cloned and fully characterized a deletion at the HEXB gene from fibroblasts of a patient with the infantile form of Sandhoff disease. The deletion removes approximately 16 kb of DNA including the HEXB promoter, exons 1-5 and part of intron 5. It most likely arose from recombination between two Alu sequences, with the breakpoints occurring at the midpoint between the left and right arms in each case and regenerating an intact Alu element in the deletion sequence. The deletion allele accounts for 27% of the Sandhoff mutant alleles we analyzed. Two cell lines were shown to be homozygous for the deletion and both had the infantile form of the disease. Four additional patients were compound heterozygotes with other mutations, all of whom displayed a different clinical phenotype. Finally, the mutant allele was present in different ethnic backgrounds, suggesting that it may have been subject to genetic drift.\r"

Renal blood flow (RBF) responses were determined before and during intrarenal infusion of an AII and TXA2 antagonist. Saralasin or SQ29548 alone partially corrected the slopes of RBF to RNS and RPP reduction in NE-ARF rats (P less than 0.02). Saralasin + SQ29548 normalized the RBF response to RNS. While combined saralasin + SQ29548 eliminated the vasoconstriction to RPP reduction, similar to the effect of renal denervation, appropriate vasodilatation was not restored. Renal vein norepinephrine efflux during RNS was disproportionately increased in NE-ARF (P less than 0.001) and was suppressed by saralasin + SQ29548 infusion (P less than 0.005). It is concluded that the enhanced sensitivity to RNS and paradoxical vasoconstriction to RPP reduction in 1 wk NE-ARF kidneys are the result of intrarenal TX and AII acceleration of neurotransmitter release to adrenergic nerve activity.\r"

We measured RLum in the jejunum of conscious dogs by assessing the absorption rate of two rapidly absorbed probes, glucose, and [14C]warfarin. When RLum was expressed as an unstirred layer, the maximal thickness of the unstirred layer (assuming negligible epithelial cell resistance) was only approximately 35 and 50 microns for perfusion rates of 26 and 5 ml/min, respectively. Maximal unstirred layer thickness for the human jejunum, calculated from previous studies of glucose absorption, yielded a mean value of only 40 microns (range: 23 to 65 microns). Since epithelial resistance appears to be negligible during absorption of low concentrations of glucose, the maximal unstirred layer of 40 microns should be close to the true value for glucose in the human small intestine. We conclude that the unstirred layer for rapidly absorbed compounds in dogs and man are less than one-tenth of previously reported values, but this layer still may remain the rate limiting step in absorption of rapidly transported compounds.\r"

  ".W": "The mechanism of cell proliferation by a combination of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) was studied in rat thyroid (FRTL-5) cells. IGF-I stimulated an approximately 3.5-fold increase in the rate of Ca2+ influx sustained for at least 6 h in TSH-pretreated cells but not in quiescent cells. The significant cell proliferation was observed when TSH-primed cells were incubated with IGF-I for 24 h but not for 12 h. IGF-I stimulated the rate of Ca2+ influx in a dose-dependent manner that was similar to that for induction of DNA synthesis. Both Ca2+ influx and DNA synthesis observed in response to IGF-I in TSH-primed cells were inhibited by cobalt. In addition, the stimulations of Ca2+ influx and DNA synthesis by IGF-I were dependent on extracellular Ca2+ in TSH-pretreated cells. When TSH-primed cells were pretreated with pertussis toxin, both IGF-I-induced Ca2+ influx and DNA synthesis were abolished. However, pertussis toxin did not block the priming action of TSH or forskolin. When calcium entry was induced by Bay K8644, it stimulated cell growth in TSH-primed cells but not in quiescent cells. Moreover, cobalt and lanthanum inhibited DNA synthesis even when added several hours after the addition of Bay K8644 but not when added 24 h after the growth factor in TSH-primed cells. These findings suggest that at least two important mechanisms may work in response to IGF-I only in the TSH-primed G1 phase of the cell cycle: first, IGF-I can activate directly or indirectly the Ca2+ channel via a pertussis toxin-sensitive substrate in TSH-primed cells; and second, a long lasting calcium entry by IGF-I may be a cell cycle-dependent mitogenic signal.\r"

LPS induced a dose-dependent release of LTB4 that began by 1 h, 4.0 +/- 3.2 ng/10(6) viable AM; peaked at 3 h, 24.7 +/- 13.5 ng/10(6) viable AM; and decreased by 24 h, 1.2 +/- 1.0 ng/10(6) viable AM (n = 8). Quantities of LTB4 in cell-free supernatants of AM stimulated with LPS were determined by reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography and corresponded well with results obtained by radioimmunoassay. By contrast, NAP-1 release began approximately 3-5 h after stimulation of AM with LPS, 197 +/- 192 ng/ml, and peaked at 24 h, 790 +/- 124 ng/ml. Release of NAP-1 was stimulus specific because A23187 evoked the release of LTB4 but not NAP-1, whereas LPS and zymosan induced the release of both LTB4 and NAP-1. The appearance of neutrophil chemotactic activity in supernatants of AM challenged with LPS for 3 h could be explained completely by the quantities of LTB4 present. After stimulation with LPS or zymosan for 24 h, AM had metabolized almost all generated LTB4. Preincubation of AM with nordihydroguiaretic acid (10(-4) M) completely abolished the appearance of NCA, LTB4, and NAP-1 in supernatants of AM challenged with LPS. Therefore, LPS and zymosan particles were potent stimuli of the sequential release of LTB4 and NAP-1 from AM.\r"

No unifying mechanism for these actions of VPA has won general acceptance. alpha-Ketoglutarate dehydrogenase complex (KDHC) is a critical control enzyme in the CNS. We hypothesized that VPA may be an inhibitor of this enzyme since decreased KDHC activity would reduce substrate flux through the citric acid cycle and may increase flux into GABA synthesis. To test this hypothesis, inhibition of purified beef brain KDHC by VPA and its metabolites 2-n-propylpent-2-enoic acid (delta 2,3 VPE) and their coenzyme A (CoA) derivatives were studied. Preincubation of the NADH-reduced enzyme with delta 2,3 VPE, VPA-CoA, and delta 2,3 VPE-CoA caused time-dependent inactivation, reversible by addition of CoA. Under steady-state conditions, delta 2,3 VPE and VPA-CoA were competitive inhibitors of KDHC and delta 2,3 VPE-CoA was a mixed inhibitor. These observations have implications for the molecular mechanisms of VPA action. VPA derivatives cause inactivation and inhibition of KDHC, which may explain the anticonvulsant and some toxic actions of VPA.\r"

Correction of the abnormal orthostatic changes by an inflated pressure suit (MAST) confirmed previous evidence of excessive gravitational pooling of blood in the leg veins. Intravenous L-norepinephrine infusion raised diastolic blood pressure in the same relationship to the infusion-induced increments in plasma norepinephrine concentrations as in normal subjects, indicating normal arteriolar responses. Contractile responses of the veins to infused L-norepinephrine were measured with a linear variable differential transformer (LVDT). The venous responses of hand veins in the patients fell within the 95% confidence limits of the responses of normal hand veins, as did the responses of foot veins in the seven normal subjects. However, foot veins of the patients with hyperadrenergic orthostatic hypotension, and both hand and foot veins of patients with \"diffuse\" autonomic failure, were supersensitive to norepinephrine, as reflected by a steeper slope of the regression of log (norepinephrine infusion rate) on percentage reduction in venous distensibility, and a significantly lower ED50 (i.e., norepinephrine infusion rate that induced 50% reduction in venous distensibility). The findings suggest anatomical or functional postganglionic denervation of lower limb veins causing excessive gravitational blood pooling with consequent orthostatic hypotension in these patients.\r"

Previous studies have shown that in vitro MTT directly inhibits microsomal gamma-carboxylation of a synthetic pentapeptide. Since MTT is a thiocarbamide, a type of compound that can increase oxidation of glutathione, the present studies were carried out to determine whether alterations in hepatic glutathione redox state might interfere with vitamin K metabolism. Dose-related increases in biliary efflux and hepatic concentration of oxidized glutathione (GSSG) occurred after intravenous administration of MTT or MTT-containing antibiotics to rats. This finding suggested that these compounds could alter the hepatic glutathione redox state in vivo. Microsomal reduction of vitamin K epoxide occurred in the presence of 100 microM dithiothreitol (DTT), but was inhibited by preincubation with GSSG at concentrations as low as 10 microM. At higher concentrations of DTT (1.0 mM) inhibition by GSSG persisted, but higher concentrations were required, suggesting that the thiol/disulfide ratio, rather than the absolute concentration of GSSG was important. By contrast, GSSG did not effect microsomal gamma-carboxylation of a pentapeptide, using either vitamin K1 or its hydroquinone as a cofactor. These findings suggest a novel mechanism for the hypoprothrombinemia occurring after administration of MTT-containing antibiotics.\r"

In both sexes the number of BAR binding sites was about twice as high in abdominal as in gluteal fat cells (P less than 0.01). Northern blot analysis of total RNA from adipose tissue showed hybridization of the BAR1 probe to an mRNA species of about 2.5 kb and of the BAR2 probe to an mRNA species of approximately 2.2 kb. The steady-state mRNA levels of BAR 1 and BAR 2 were also about twice as high in abdominal as in gluteal adipocytes of men and women (P less than 0.01). In abdominal fat cells the mRNA levels were approximately 45 and 30 molecules/cell for BAR1 and BAR2, respectively. There were no regional or sex variations in BAR 1 and BAR 2 mRNA stability. The apparent half-life of mRNA for both receptor subtypes was approximately 6 h in both regions. The mRNA levels for beta actin did not differ between the two regions in either sex. Thus, differences in expression of the genes encoding for BAR 1 and BAR 2 can explain why abdominal fat cells have more BAR than gluteal fat cells. This variation in gene expression may be a molecular mechanism underlying the well known regional differences in catecholamine-induced lipolysis activity between central and peripheral adipose tissue.\r"

Since rearrangements of the mitochondrial genome between direct DNA repeats were consistently found in all tissues tested, our results show that this disease is in fact a multisystem mitochondrial disorder, as suggested by the clinical course of the patients. Based on these observations, we would suggest giving consideration to the hypothesis of a defect of oxidative phosphorylation in elucidating the origin of other syndromes, especially those associated with an abnormal oxidoreduction status in plasma.\r"

Using a combined reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay developed by us, HCV RNA was detected in 0.6 ml of plasma from 8 of 11 (73%) of the anti-HCV-positive but in none of the 90 anti-HCV-negative specimens. The relatively low concentration of HCV RNA could be detected in the remaining three anti-HCV-positive specimens when 2.4 ml of plasma was analyzed. The plasma concentration of virions was estimated to range from 10(2) to 5 x 10(7)/ml. Direct sequencing performed on the PCR-amplified HCV cDNAs (210 base pairs) from three specimens revealed heterogeneity between 2.5 and 8.6% at the nucleotide level and less than 4% at the amino acid level.

  ".W": "Previous studies from our laboratories have suggested a defect in glucose transport in islets isolated from BB rats on the first day of overt diabetes. To quantitate by immunostaining the glucose transporter of beta-cells (GLUT-2) before and at the onset of autoimmune diabetes we employed an antibody to its COOH-terminal octapeptide. On the first day of overt diabetes, defined as the day the daily blood glucose first reached 200 mg/dl, the volume density ratio of GLUT-2-positive to insulin-positive beta-cells was only 0.48 +/- 0.06, compared to 0.91 +/- 0.02 in age-matched nondiabetic diabetes-resistant controls (P less than 0.001). In age-matched nondiabetic diabetes-prone rats, most of which would have become diabetic, the ratio was 0.85 +/- 0.02, also less than the controls (P less than 0.05). Protein A-gold labeling of GLUT-2 in beta-cells of day 1 diabetic rats revealed 2.17 +/- 0.16 gold particles per micrometer length of microvillar plasma membranes compared to 3.91 +/- 0.14 in controls (P less than 0.001) and 2.87 +/- 0.24 in the nondiabetic diabetes-prone rats (P less than 0.02). Reduction in GLUT-2 correlates temporally with and may contribute to the loss of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion that precedes profound beta-cell depletion of autoimmune diabetes.\r"

  ".W": "A novel X-linked combined immunodeficiency disease was found in five living males in an extended family in the United States. The age of the affected males ranged from 2.5 to 34 yr. The most prominent clinical abnormalities were a paucity of lymphoid tissue; recurrent sinusitis, otitis media, bronchitis, and pneumonia; severe varicella; and chronic papillomavirus infections. The principal immunologic features of the disorder were normal concentrations of serum immunoglobulins but restricted formation of IgG antibodies to immunogens; normal numbers of B cells and NK cells but decreased numbers of CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes, particularly the CD45RA+ subpopulations; diminished proliferative responses of blood T cells to allogeneic cells, mitogens and antigens; and decreased production of IL-2 by mitogen stimulated blood lymphocytes. Thus, affected males in this family carry an abnormal gene on their X chromosome that results in a combined immunodeficiency that is distinct from previously reported disorders.\r"

  ".W": "Cisplatin (DDP) is the most effective drug for the treatment of human ovarian cancer, but the mechanisms that determine sensitivity to the cytotoxic action of DDP are not well understood. Treatment of two human ovarian carcinoma cell lines with epidermal growth factor (EGF) simultaneously increased sensitivity to DDP and caused a persistent change in morphology in the absence of any mitogenic effect. Sensitization to DDP was shown to be dependent on both EGF concentration and EGF receptor number in C127 mouse fibroblasts expressing the human EGF receptor after transfection with a pBPV plasmid construct containing the human EGF receptor gene under control of the transferrin receptor 3'-inducible regulator. Sensitization of human ovarian carcinoma cells to DDP was not blocked by inhibition of protein synthesis. EGF did not enhance sensitivity to DDP or alter morphology in DDP-resistant human ovarian carcinoma cells despite the presence of functional EGF receptors on these cells. These results showed that elements of the signal transduction pathway activated by EGF determined cellular sensitivity to DDP, and that a DDP-resistant phenotype is associated with a defect in this signal transduction pathway.\r"

  ".W": "Whether parenchymal or nonparenchymal liver cells play a predominant role in the pathophysiology of hepatic fibrosis has not been firmly established in vivo. We have addressed this question by quantitating the relative abundance of specific mRNAs for collagen types I, III, and IV, and laminin in purified populations of hepatocytes, sinusoidal endothelial cells, and lipocytes from normal and fibrotic rat liver. In normal liver, type I collagen gene expression was minimal in all cell types; mRNA for types III and IV collagen were apparent in endothelial cells and lipocytes, but not in hepatocytes. Laminin mRNA was present in all cell types. Induction of fibrogenesis by either bile duct ligation or carbon tetrachloride administration was associated with a substantial increase in mRNA for types I and III collagen in nonparenchymal cells. Lipocytes from fibrotic animals exhibited a greater than 30-fold increase in type I collagen mRNA relative to normal lipocytes, and greater than 40-fold relative to hepatocytes. Type III collagen mRNA reached 5 times that in normal lipocytes and greater than 120 times that in hepatocytes. Endothelial cells exhibited an isolated increase in type I collagen mRNA, reaching five times that in normal liver. Type IV collagen and laminin gene expression were not significantly increased in nonparenchymal cells during fibrogenesis; in fact, mRNA for type IV collagen and laminin decreased by up to 50% in endothelial cells. Despite the pronounced changes that occurred in matrix gene expression in nonparenchymal cells during fibrogenesis, no change was noted in hepatocytes. We conclude that nonparenchymal liver cells, particularly lipocytes, are important effectors of hepatic fibrosis in vivo.\r"

  ".W": "In this study experiments were performed to correlate the rate of digestive enzyme secretion to morphologic observations of the apical cytoskeleton using dispersed rat pancreatic acini with various concentrations of caerulein. Caerulein at concentrations of 10 pM to 0.1 nM stimulated increasing rates of secretion of amylase, a digestive enzyme. Greater concentrations of caerulein caused progressively less amylase secretion. Transmission electron microscopy demonstrated several characteristics of the apical cytoskeleton in untreated acini that were altered with the \"inhibitory\" concentrations of caerulein. In control acini and acini stimulated with concentrations of caerulein up to 0.1 nM, the micrographs reveal an apical actin network extending into microvilli, an intermediate filament band, and electron-dense structures contained in both the actin filament network and the intermediate filament band. With concentrations of caerulein greater than 0.1 nM, these structures were progressively ablated. The findings with respect to the actin filament network were confirmed with light microscopic observations of dispersed acini stained with rhodamine-phalloidin. These results indicate that caerulein has marked morphologic effects on the pancreatic acinar cell cytoskeleton and that the cytoskeletal changes may modulate the secretory response.\r"
