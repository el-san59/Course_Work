A total of 338 randomly selected adults aged 25 to 65 years residing in the Boston metropolitan area completed an HRA on two occasions seven to 12 weeks apart. Test-retest reliability was assessed by comparing self-reported baseline risk scores to follow-up scores for heart attack risk and selected coronary heart disease risk factors. Respondents generally gave consistent reports for family history, cigarette smoking, and relative weight (test-retest r greater than .75), but self-reported scores for physiologic status (blood pressure and cholesterol) and lifestyle (diet, physical activity, and stress) were much less stable. Coefficients for heart attack risk and appraised age ranged from .43 to .87 for the four HRAs. The reliabilities of two self-scored instruments were greatly reduced by mathematical errors made by respondents when computing their heart attack risk scores. These results were not affected by the length of the follow-up period (seven to 12 weeks).\r"

Data derive from a random sample of 732 Greater Boston, Massachusetts area men and women ages 25-65 years, who participated in a field trial of health risk appraisal instruments. At baseline and approximately two months later, all respondents completed a questionnaire assessing their own health-related behavior, risk factors, and perception of heart attack risk. At baseline, respondents also completed one of four HRA instruments. Physiologic measures of cholesterol, blood pressure, and weight were taken at either baseline or follow-up visit. Results showed that respondents used established risk factors in estimating overall risk; that compared to objective measures of risk, a high percentage of respondents displayed an optimistic bias; and that HRA feedback had some effect on perception of heart attack risk for those at high risk. Implications of these results for health promotion are discussed.\r"

Cumulative silicosis incidence decreased from 36.1 percent in workers employed before 1950 to 1.5 percent in workers employed after 1960. From the 1950s to 1970s, eight-year cumulative incidence of tuberculosis decreased from 54.7 percent to 16.7 percent and case fatality of silicosis patients dropped from 53.9 percent to 18.3 percent. From 1950s to 1980s, the average age at the detection of silicosis increased from 41.3 to 52.7 and the average survival time of silicosis patients prolonged from 2.0 to 12.2 years. Workers over age 40 who began exposure to dust before 1960 will be the main source of new silicosis patients in future. Most expected new cases of silicosis will occur within the next 15 years. The silicosis population will remain unchanged for the next 20 years and will decrease dramatically after 25 years. There will be few silicosis patients in 30 years and new cases of silicosis will be difficult to find in 45 years. These results show that the preventive and therapeutic actions against silicosis in China have been effective.\r"

Nearly 80 percent of patients underwent surgery at hospitals performing 40 or fewer carotid endarterectomies per year on the Medicare population. The adjusted odds ratio for 30 day mortality for patients undergoing surgery in these low-volume hospitals was 2.8 (95% CI = 1.1, 7.2) compared to higher volume hospitals. Although the Medicare claims data provided only limited data about post-operative strokes, analysis of post-operative stroke risk supported these findings.\r"

Using loglinear regression methods, a quadratic regression model was fitted to the observed numbers of male deaths in each region in the period 1950-84, controlling for changes in age-structure of populations. The quadratic regression model proved inadequate to describe the mortality experience of females. For the country as a whole, the estimated year of onset of male ischemic heart disease mortality decline is 1973.9. The difference between the earliest and the latest region is almost nine years (1970.0 and 1978.9, respectively). An early onset of decline (less than or equal to 1972) is only found in the urbanized, western part of the country. A later (greater than or equal to 1975) onset of decline is characteristically found in more peripheral regions in the South-West and South-East, as well as in the North. Exploratory correlation and regression analyses show that both average income and percent of population living in larger cities have independent, negative associations with the year of onset of male ischemic heart disease mortality decline. We argue that regional variation in the timing of lifestyle changes is a more plausible explanation of these observations than regional variation in the timing of medical care improvements.\r"

Four filters and seven chemical treatments were evaluated for both clear and turbid water at 10 degrees C. Three contact disinfection devices were also tested for cyst inactivation. Filters were tested with 1-liter volumes of water seeded with 3 x 10(4) cysts of G. lamblia produced in gerbils inoculated with in vitro cultured trophozoites; the entire volume of filtrate was examined for cyst passage. Chemical treatments were evaluated at concentrations specified by the manufacturer and for contact times that might be expected of hikers (30 minutes) and campers (eight hours, i.e., overnight). Two of the four filter devices tested were 100 percent effective for Giardia cyst removal. Of the other two filters, one was 90 percent effective and the other considerably less effective. Among the seven disinfection treatments, the iodine-based chemicals were all significantly more effective than the chlorine-based chemicals. None of the chemical treatments achieved 99.9 percent cyst inactivation with only 30-minute contact. After an eight-hour contact each of the iodine but none of the chlorine preparations achieved at least 99.9 percent cyst inactivation. None of the contact disinfection devices provided appreciable cyst inactivation. Heating water to at least 70 degrees C for 10 minutes was an acceptable alternative treatment.\r"

Comparing seven men who were probable transmitters of HIV and 11 men who had not transmitted HIV to their uninfected partners despite unprotected insertive anal intercourse, we found no differences in HIV isolation from peripheral blood mononuclear cells, circulating HIV antigen detection, or presence of neutralizing antibody to HIV. Helper T-cell numbers were not significantly different between the two groups, but transmitters had more suppressor T-cells than did nontransmitters.\r"

Using information on both deceased and living patients, we estimated means of 40.3 lifetime inpatient days and 3.3 hospitalizations among all AIDS patients. Those presenting with Kaposi's sarcoma experienced a mean of 7.6 fewer lifetime inpatient days than those presenting with Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (95% confidence interval = .61, 14.6) and a mean of 11.0 (3.9, 18.6) fewer inpatient days than all other AIDS patients. Older patients had fewer hospital admissions than younger ones. Year of diagnosis does not appear to be related to lifetime utilization, and there is an indication that increased survival has been accompanied by decreased inpatient utilization intensity as measured on a per person-year basis. We recommend the use of survival analysis methods in the study of utilization among groups of patients with incomplete follow-up.\r"

  ".W": "We describe a successful program of poliomyelitis control using a combination of killed and live polio vaccines over a 10-year period in two developing areas, the West Bank and Gaza, adjacent to a relatively developed country, Israel. During the 1970s, immunization using live trivalent oral polio vaccine (OPV) in these areas covered more than 90 percent of the infant population. Nevertheless, the incidence of paralytic polio continued to be high, with many cases occurring in fully or partially immunized persons. It was thought that this could be due to interference with OPV take by other enteroviruses present in the environment due to poor sanitary conditions in these areas. A new policy combining five doses of OPV with two doses of inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) was adopted and implemented in 1978. In the 10 years since then, immunization coverage of infants increased to an estimated 95 percent and paralytic poliomyelitis has been controlled, despite exposure to wild poliovirus from neighboring countries including an outbreak in Israel in 1988. This experience suggests that wide coverage using the combination of IPV and OPV is an effective vaccination policy that may make eradication of polio possible even in developing areas.\r"

NIOSH has developed a Sentinel Event Notification System for Occupational Risks (SENSOR) that uses targeted sources of sentinel providers to recognize and report selected occupational disorders to a state surveillance center. SENSOR is a cooperative state-federal effort designed to develop local capability for preventing selected occupational disorders. To demonstrate the feasibility of this approach, NIOSH initially funded seven SENSOR projects in 1987 and three additional projects in early 1988 (Table 1). Currently, these projects are in the preliminary stages of organization and start-up, with some having begun to receive case reports. As funds become available, NIOSH intends to gradually expand the scope of the program to include additional states over the next several years.\r"

We have proposed alternative hazard surveillance systems that would expand the database on actual exposures in the workplace by requiring that industry systematically conduct environmental monitoring for defined substances and then provide the data to OSHA and NIOSH for use in hazard surveillance.\r"

Animals in the low-fiber diet group were significantly more likely to become infected when inoculated with 100 Giardia lamblia cysts than were animals in the high-fiber group. No differences were detected in gastrointestinal transit, gastric, and small intestinal luminal pH, or in duodenal mucus blanket acidic glycoprotein between animals in the high- and the low-fiber diet groups at the time of cyst inoculation. The fiber content of the diet after cyst inoculation determined the infection rate. These data suggest that the dietary fiber effect occurred during trophozoite colonization of the small intestine. When infected animals on the low-fiber diet were placed on the high-fiber diet for 24 hr, trophozoite clearing occurred in the lower small intestine. In the jejunum, the number of trophozoites attached to the mucosal surface decreased, while the number associated with luminal mucus increased. We conclude that the fiber-induced mucus secretion and the bulk movement of the insoluble fiber reduced the attachment of trophozoites to the intestinal mucosa, which decreased the probability of trophozoites establishing and sustaining colonization of the mucosa.\r"

  ".W": "The newly recognized pathogenic virus-like infectious agent (VLIA), originally reported in patients with AIDS but also known to be pathogenic in previously healthy non-AIDS patients and in non-human primates, was cultured in cell-free conditions using a modified SP-4 medium and classified as a member of the order Mycoplasmatales, class Mollicutes. The infectious microorganism is tentatively referred to as Mycoplasma incognitus. M. incognitus has the unique biochemical properties of utilizing glucose both aerobically and anaerobically, as well as having the ability to metabolize arginine. Among all known human mycoplasmas, these specific biochemical characteristics were found previously only in a rarely isolated species, M. fermentans. In comparison with M. fermentans, M. incognitus appears to be even more fastidious in cultivation requirements and fails to grow in all tested mycoplasma media other than modified SP-4 medium. In addition, M. incognitus grows much more slowly, has a smaller spherical particle size and occasional filamentous morphology, and forms only irregular and very small colonies with diffuse edges on agar plates. Antigenic analysis using polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies and DNA analysis of sequence homology and restriction enzyme mappings in M. incognitus, M. orale, M. hyorhinis, M. hominis, M. pneumoniae, M. fermentans, M. arginini, M. genitalium, M. salivarium, Ureaplasma urealyticum, and Acholeplasma laidlawii revealed that M. incognitus is distinct from other mycoplasmas, but is most closely related to M. fermentans.\r"

The Mabs identified M. incognitus immunohistologically in thymus, liver, spleen, lymph node, or brain from 22 patients with AIDS, as well as in 2 placentas delivered by patients with AIDS. Using an 35S-labeled DNA probe specific for M. incognitus and in situ hybridization technique, we also identified M. incognitus-specific genetic material in these tissues. Furthermore, ultrastructural studies of the specific areas of tissues which were highly positive for M. incognitus antigens revealed characteristic structures of mycoplasma organisms. These mycoplasma-like particles could be identified intracellularly and extracellularly. Histopathology of the tissues infected by M. incognitus varied from no pathological changes to fulminant necrosis with or without an associated inflammatory reaction. M. incognitus, a novel pathogenic mycoplasma, was cytopathic and cytocidal.\r"

The recurrence rate for total thyroidectomy patients was much lower than for any other operation. Many investigators, including those of two current surgery textbooks, have acknowledged that total thyroidectomy is superior for control of the disease but have been reluctant to recommend it because the complications are presumed to be too numerous. The results of this analysis rebut that presumption. The operating surgeons are not thyroid experts, yet their results were excellent. It is reasonable to assume that a trained general surgeon is capable of performing a total thyroidectomy without an unacceptable high incidence of postoperative complications.\r"

A significant finding of our study was the relatively high rate of tumor foci in the nipple-areolar complex (7 percent) in those patients with early invasive stage I or II breast carcinoma eligible for conservative therapy. Analysis of nipple-areolar complex involvement with consideration of different clinico-morphologic variables indicates that it was directly associated with tumor size. No significant correlation was found with axillary metastases, tumor histologic type, or with the presence of noninvasive cancer in the vicinity of the dominant tumor. Our estimate of the significant change of finding tumor in the nipple-areolar complex, especially in the patient group eligible for conservative therapy, underlines the need for postoperative radiation.\r"

In the transhiatal group, excessive bleeding and tumor perforation as a result of blunt dissection each occurred in seven patients (18 percent). Recurrent nerve injury was noted in five patients (13 percent), but tracheal damage and chylothorax were avoided. The incidences of operative mortality and postoperative complications were similar in both groups. Survival by life-table analysis showed the transhiatal approach to be inferior to the transthoracic one. This nonrandomized study did not answer the question as to whether respiratory complications were lessened but did show a significant number of intraoperative complications when the transhiatal approach was used. The results indicated that survival was better when resection was performed through the chest.\r"

The role of intraperitoneally administered cefazolin and tetracycline in the formation of adhesions was studied in the rodent model. Thirty-two rats were divided into 3 groups. Group 1 underwent midline laparotomy with instillation of 10 ml of normal saline solution. Group 2 and Group 3 underwent the same procedure with instillation of 0.2 percent saline solutions of cefazolin or tetracycline, respectively. Animals were sacrificed after 2 weeks. Intraabdominal adhesions were graded and samples of parietal peritoneum were processed for histologic data. Group 2 and Group 3 had significantly higher adhesion scores compared with Group 1 (p less than 0.001). Histologic appearance of both antibiotic-irrigated groups showed mesothelial thickening with presence of fibroblasts and collagen. Cefazolin and tetracycline irrigation of the abdominal cavity contributes to the formation of peritoneal adhesions in the rat model.\r"

Early thrombosis (within 30 days of operation) was successfully treated in 14 of 17 patients (82 percent) with either graft thrombectomy (13 of 17 patients) or graft replacement (1 patient). Late graft closure (2 to 55 months after operation) was successfully treated with thrombectomy in 17 of 28 patients (61 percent) or graft revision or replacement in 4 patients (14 percent). Aneurysms and graft infections were each seen in 3 percent of the grafts at risk. The former were successfully reconstructed in six of seven instances, whereas the latter eventuated in amputation in six of seven patients. An aggressive approach to graft closure in stabilized human umbilical vein grafts is recommended as this conduit is amenable to thrombectomy or revision if closure occurs.\r"

Extirpation with the full-thickness of the abdominal wall is required except for small, superficial lesions. A wide-margin resection, including any adherent viscus, segments of adjacent ribs, and iliac or pubic crest, offers the best assurance of local control. Adjunctive radiotherapy can be given when the margin of resection is unavoidably limited, but an effective radiation dose can be difficult to administer, due to the sensitivity of underlying intestines. Metastases develop frequently with high-grade sarcomas; adjuvant chemotherapy may be tried in these patients, but its value remains unproven.\r"

In the two groups, 94 percent and 92 percent of patients were operated on. The operation was considered curative in 200 and 265 patients in Groups 1 and 2, respectively. There was a shift towards more radical operations, with 215 total or subtotal gastrectomies in Group 2 compared with 76 in Group 1, when distal gastric resection was considered radical enough. Despite the increasing number of curative operations and more radical surgery in Group 2, no progress in the 5-year survival rate was noted. Distal and subtotal gastrectomies gave slightly better results than total gastrectomies, but the most important single factor contributing to the long-term survival was cancerous invasion of the serosa. It is concluded that in the past 20 years, the results of surgical treatment of gastric carcinoma have not improved, despite the more advanced diagnostic methods and more radical surgery.\r"

The disposition of alfentanil was determined after rapid intravenous administration to four extensive debrisoquin metabolizers and three poor debrisoquin metabolizers. Debrisoquin hydroxylation phenotype was determined using the urinary dextromethorphan/dextrorphan metabolic ratio test. The disposition of alfentanil was characterized by a three-compartment open mammillary model. There was no relationship between the dextromethorphan/dextrorphan metabolic ratio and the elimination clearance of alfentanil despite a nearly seven hundred-fold range of the metabolic ratio in the seven volunteers. This indicates that the variability in the elimination clearance of alfentanil is not due to the polymorphism of debrisoquin hydroxylase. Nor is this variability due to variable hepatic blood flow because in this study alfentanil clearance was not related to indocyanine green clearance.\r"

Clonidine produced analgesia, as measured by change in verbal pain scores and supplemental iv morphine usage. The largest doses examined (700-900 micrograms) produced complete pain relief for 5.0 +/- 0.8 h (mean +/- SEM; range 2-11 h), without other sensory or motor blockade. Clonidine also produced dose dependent decreases in blood pressure, being less following small (100-300 micrograms) and large (700-900 micrograms) doses than following intermediate (400-600 micrograms) doses. Six patients required iv ephedrine for treatment of blood pressure decrease of greater than 30%. Clonidine decreased heart rate 10-30% and produced transient sedation. Oxyhemoglobin saturation, serum glucose, and arterial blood gas tensions were not altered by clonidine, whereas there was a small (28%) dose-independent decrease in serum cortisol following clonidine injection. Clonidine was absorbed in a dose-dependent manner into the systemic circulation, with plasma concentrations 0.1-3.3 ng/ml 1 h following injection. These results suggest that hemodynamic depression and short-lasting analgesia may limit the usefulness of bolus epidural clonidine analgesia in the postoperative setting.\r"

Halothane has been the recommended agent, but without experimental justification. Isoflurane, which has no reported organ toxicity and produces electrographic suppression at clinically useful concentrations in normal humans, should be a better volatile anesthetic for this purpose. The efficacy and safety of isoflurane administered to control convulsive status epilepticus were assessed on 11 occasions in nine patients in seven North American hospitals. Isoflurane, administered for 1-55 h, stopped seizures in all patients and was able to be titrated to produce burst-suppression patterns on electroencephalograms. Blood pressure support with iv fluids and/or pressor infusions was required in all of the patients. Seizures resumed upon discontinuation of isoflurane on eight of 11 occasions. Six of the nine patients died. The three survivors sustained cognitive deficits. In one patient urine fluoride concentrations were elevated, although not to nephrotoxic levels. These cases suggest that isoflurane 1) is an effective, rapidly titratable anticonvulsant; 2) does not reverse underlying causes of the refractory seizures; and 3) usually necessitates hemodynamic support with fluids and/or pressors. Isoflurane may be administered for seizures, but only when iv agents in anesthetic doses are ineffective or produce unacceptable side effects.\r"

  ".W": "The blood pressure (BP) response to cerebellar retraction during microvascular decompression of the fifth cranial nerve was investigated in 26 ASA physical status 2 or 3 patients with trigeminal neuralgia. One surgeon performed all operations. To determine the effect of three anesthetic techniques on the BP response, patients were randomly assigned to receive halothane, isoflurane, or sufentanil in sufficient doses with 60% nitrous oxide to achieve a precerebellar retraction systolic BP that was 10-20% below the average ward systolic BP (as per standard clinical practice). The resultant doses were halothane 1.65 +/- 0.27 (mean +/- SD) MAC, isoflurane 1.56 +/- 0.17 MAC (P greater than 0.05), and sufentanil 2.7 micrograms/kg (MAC values include 0.6 MAC contribution from 60% nitrous oxide). In all patients BP increased during the cerebellar retractor placement period compared with the preretractor placement period (P less than 0.05). The peak increase in systolic BP in response to cerebellar retraction was 17 +/- 6 mmHg for halothane, 38 +/- 20 mmHg for isoflurane, and 26 +/- 19 mmHg for sufentanil. The difference between halothane and isoflurane was significant (P less than 0.05). Mean and diastolic BP showed similar significant differences. The authors conclude that halothane attenuates the hypertensive response to cerebellar retraction more than isoflurane when administered in approximately 1.6 MAC concentrations (MAC value includes contribution from nitrous oxide).\r"

Although movement in response to skin incision was correlated with an increase in heart rate, blood pressure, and an increased SLEC frequency, there was no correlation between the SLEC prior to skin incision and movement in response to this stimulus. Moreover, cardiovascular responses preceded the detection of SLEC changes. The relationship between changes in SLEC activity and times to awakening during emergence from anesthesia was also examined. During emergence from anesthesia there was an increase in SLEC, but the time to awakening could not be predicted from the SLEC. Cardiovascular changes again preceded SLEC changes during emergence. Monitoring of the lower esophageal contractility rate would appear to be of limited usefulness in evaluating the depth of anesthesia in unparalyzed children during nitrous oxide and halothane anesthesia.\r"

Patients in group 1 (n = 6) had an average daily consumption of 20-40 g alcohol. Patients in group 2 (n = 8) were life-long abstainers or drank only occasionally (less than 60 g per year). Anesthesia was induced and maintained with 66% N2O in O2 and alfentanil. Alfentanil was administered by a computer-controlled infusion pump. If during surgery the patient exhibited somatic, hemodynamic, or other autonomic signs of inadequate anesthesia (response), the target alfentanil plasma concentration was increased by 50-100 ng/ml. If there was no response during a 15-min period, the target concentration was decreased by 50-100 ng/ml. Arterial blood samples were taken before any change of the target concentration, 4 min after a new predicted target concentration was achieved, and at extubation. Plasma concentrations were determined by capillary gas chromatography. Alfentanil protein binding was measured by equilibrium dialysis. Plasma alfentanil concentration-effect data were analyzed by nonlinear regression, where effect was either response or no response to surgical stimuli. The average total alfentanil requirement was significantly (P less than 0.005) higher in group 1 (3.7 +/- 1.2 micrograms.kg-1.min-1) than in group 2 (1.9 +/- 0.4 micrograms.kg-1.min-1). The average Cp50 (the plasma concentration for which the probability of no response during surgery is 50%) was significantly (P less than 0.001) higher in group 1 (522 +/- 104 ng/ml) than in group 2 (208 +/- 26 ng/ml).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In addition, medications received were noted. No differences were found between the groups in terms of severity or incidence of pain, or requests for analgesic or antipruritic medication. Although there was no difference between the groups in the first 2 h, patients with TDS had significantly less nausea, vomiting, and retching than patients in the placebo group in each time interval between 2 and 10 h. Additionally, the TDS group required less antiemetic medication. There was no difference in the frequency of retching or vomiting between groups. Side effects were minimal and equal in both groups. The authors conclude that TDS results in a decreased incidence of nausea and vomiting in patients who have delivered by cesarean section and received epidural morphine. TDS appears safe for continuous antiemetic administration.\r"

  ".W": "The value of a new technique of protected bronchoalveolar lavage not requiring bronchoscopy was prospectively evaluated for the diagnosis of nosocomial pneumonia in two groups of critically ill patients. The control group was comprised of 29 patients free of any pulmonary disease whose lungs were ventilated for a mean time of 14 +/- 9 days (mean +/- SD). The pneumonia group was comprised of 30 patients with histologically proven nosocomial pneumonia whose lungs were ventilated for a mean time of 11 +/- 8 days. All patients of the pneumonia group died, and postmortem lung biopsies were taken for bacteriologic and pathologic examination. Twice a week in the control group or within the day preceding death in the pneumonia group, distal bronchial samples were obtained by a technique of protected bronchoalveolar lavage performed at the bedside. Fifty-one distal bronchial samples were bacteriologically analyzed in the control group and 30 in the pneumonia group. The sensitivity of a positive protected bronchoalveolar lavage for diagnosing nosocomial pneumonia was 80%, whereas the specificity was 66%. In 73% of the patients of the pneumonia group, the microorganisms isolated in the protected bronchoalveolar lavage and in the lung culture were partially (16%) or completely in agreement (57%). Among the 43 microorganisms isolated in the lung cultures, 74% were recovered by the protected bronchoalveolar lavage technique. This study shows that the protected bronchoalveolar lavage is an accurate technique for the diagnosis of nosocomial pneumonia. Because the technique is simple, noninvasive, easily repeatable at the bedside, and enables gram staining, it represents an attractive alternative to the fiberoptic bronchoscopy technique using a plugged double-sheathed brush.\r"

Free running Purkinje fibers were superfused with 2 X 10(-7)M ouabain in Krebs-Henseleit buffer for 30-50 min until DAD appeared. Purkinje fibers were then paced for 20 beats at cycle lengths between 1,000 ms and 200 ms, and the amplitude of the DAD and coupling interval between the DAD and last paced beat were determined. Halothane (0.5, 1, and 2%) was then administered and measurements repeated. Halothane produced dose-related decreases in DAD amplitude without changing DAD coupling interval. The ability of calcium to antagonize the effects of halothane was evaluated by doubling buffer calcium concentration to 5 mM in the presence of halothane 2%. Doubling buffer calcium concentration to 5 mM antagonized the reduction of DAD amplitude caused by halothane. In several preparations, dysrhythmias occurred during ouabain superfusion. Halothane reversibly terminated these arrhythmias. Halothane antagonizes DAD and dysrhythmias induced in vitro by ouabain toxicity. This effect, in part, may account for the apparent effectiveness of halothane against ouabain-induced dysrhythmias in vivo.\r"

The analgesic interaction between subcutaneous (sc) nalbuphine and intrathecal morphine in conscious, male, Sprague-Dawley rats implanted with chronic intrathecal catheters was investigated. Nalbuphine (10 mg/kg) injected 30 min after intrathecal morphine (4 micrograms) significantly antagonized the effect of morphine in the tail flick test. The antagonism was rapid in onset and persisted beyond the experimental period of 240 min. The magnitude and the duration of the effect were comparable to that observed with sc naloxone (1 mg/kg). In contrast to the results in the tail flick test, nalbuphine enhanced the effect of intrathecal morphine in the noninflamed paw pressure test. Nalbuphine (10 mg/kg) alone had no effect on the time course of tail flick latency but significantly increased paw pressure threshold during the 15-90 min interval after sc injection. Nalbuphine (0.5 mg/kg, sc) alone had no antinociceptive effect in either pain test and did not antagonize the antinociceptive effect of intrathecal morphine (4 micrograms) in the tail flick test. However, sc nalbuphine (0.5 mg/kg), injected 30 min after intrathecal morphine (1.5 micrograms), significantly enhanced the effect of morphine in the paw pressure test compared with intrathecal morphine + sc saline-treated rats. The results indicate a complex analgesic interaction between intrathecal morphine and sc nalbuphine. The net analgesic effect during the interaction was determined by the following: 1) the doses of morphine and nalbuphine; 2) the time after nalbuphine administration; and 3) the nature of the nociceptive stimulus. At lower doses, sc nalbuphine appeared to potentiate the effect of intrathecal morphine in the noninflamed paw pressure test.\r"

  ".W": "To determine what effect the addition of epinephrine has on bupivacaine toxicity, toxic doses of bupivacaine were administered to awake spontaneously breathing pigs. Twenty animals were randomized to one of two groups. One group received an infusion of bupivacaine with epinephrine (5 micrograms/ml) at a rate of 2 mg.kg-1.min-1; the other received an infusion of plain bupivacaine at the same rate. Bupivacaine infusion was continued until cardiovascular collapse. Following cardiovascular collapse we attempted to resuscitate the animals via open chest cardiac massage and a standardized resuscitation protocol. The addition of epinephrine to bupivacaine significantly increased blood pressure and systemic vascular resistance but not heart rate or cardiac output early in the bupivacaine infusion. Epinephrine had no effect on the dose of bupivacaine that caused cardiovascular collapse (P = 0.1), on the plasma concentration of bupivacaine at collapse (P = 0.9), or on the ability to resuscitate animals following cardiovascular collapse. The addition of epinephrine decreased the dose of bupivacaine required to initiate cardiac dysrhythmias (P = 0.003). The first dysrhythmia experienced by the epinephrine group was second degree heart block, which contrasts with the premature ventricular and atrial dysrhythmias experienced by the plain group. The dose of bupivacaine that produced seizures was also reduced by the addition of epinephrine (P = 0.006). The addition of epinephrine to bupivacaine did not alter the dose of bupivacaine that caused cardiovascular collapse in awake spontaneously breathing pigs but did decrease the dose of bupivacaine that caused seizures and dysrhythmias.\r"

To assess acute fetal hemodynamic effects of maternally administered esmolol, saline or esmolol (4-200 micrograms.kg-1.min-1 in a stepped manner) was infused into maternal venous catheters in nine chronically prepared pregnant ewes, and the degree of beta-adrenergic blockade was assessed by isoproterenol challenge. In control experiments saline infusion and repeated isoproterenol challenges did not alter measured parameters, although maternally administered isoproterenol (0.1 micrograms) transiently decreased uterine blood flow by 20 +/- 5% (mean +/- SEM; P less than 0.05). Esmolol produced a dose-dependent decrease in maternal blood pressure and fetal heart rate (maternal blood pressure decreased by 22 +/- 8% and fetal heart rate decreased by 27 +/- 7% following esmolol, 200 micrograms.kg-1.min-1; P less than 0.05). Fetal arterial PO2 decreased from 18.2 +/- 1.2 mmHg before to 14.1 +/- 1.5 mmHg following esmolol, 200 micrograms.kg-1.min-1 (P less than 0.05). Maternally administered esmolol produced similar dose-dependent beta-adrenergic blockade in both ewe and fetus, with complete blockade following the 80 and 200 micrograms.kg-1.min-1 doses. Thirty minutes following cessation of esmolol infusion, fetal resting heart rate and maternal and fetal isoproterenol-stimulated heart rate remained below control values. These results suggest that maternally administered esmolol may produce adverse fetal effects, limiting its usefulness in the obstetric setting.\r"

Responses to histamine aerosol challenge (0.01, 0.03, 0.1, 0.3, 1.0, and 3.0 mg/ml) were measured during six conditions: 1) thiopental/fentanyl anesthesia (control), 2) thiopental/fentanyl with aminophylline infusion, 3) halothane anesthesia (1.5 MAC), 4) halothane anesthesia with aminophylline infusion, 5) thiopental/fentanyl anesthesia after pretreatment with iv propranolol, and 6) thiopental/fentanyl anesthesia with aminophylline infusion after pretreatment with iv propranolol. Prior to aerosol challenge baseline pulmonary resistance (RL) did not differ in the six groups. Aminophylline significantly attenuated the pulmonary response to histamine and increased catecholamine concentrations during thiopental/fentanyl anesthesia. Although halothane itself significantly attenuated the pulmonary response to histamine, the administration of aminophylline during halothane anesthesia produced no additional protective effect and no increases in catecholamines were noted. Moreover, no protective effect was seen after aminophylline administration during thiopental/fentanyl anesthesia in the same dogs pretreated with propranolol. These data suggest that the protective effect of aminophylline on histamine reactivity results from release of endogenous catecholamines and that the use of aminophylline during halothane anesthesia, which blocks this release, is not warranted.\r"

Puppies were anesthetized with nitrous oxide, paralyzed, and their lungs artificially ventilated to maintain arterial normoxia (PaO2 greater than 60 mmHg) and normal acid-base balance (PaCO2 = 35-41 mmHg; pHa = 7.34-7.42). When rectal temperature was decreased from 37 to 20 degrees C, mean arterial blood pressure (MABP) decreased from 75 to 47 mmHg (P less than 0.001) and heart rate from 238 to 64 beats/min (P less than 0.001). Arterial PCO2 was reduced from 38 to 31 mmHg (P less than 0.001) (corrected to 37 degrees C), whereas pHa was unchanged from control (7.40). The electroencephalogram slowed progressively and became isoelectric at 22-25 degrees C. During normothermia (n = 6) blood flow to 16 component structures of brain varied from 17 (occipital white matter) to 65 (medulla) ml.100 g-1.min-1, whereas during hypothermia (n = 6) blood flow was lower in all regions (P less than 0.001) at remarkably uniform levels 8.3-10.3 ml.100 g-1.min-1). Thus, the greatest reductions (range, 16-48% of control) in CBF occurred in those structures with the highest intrinsic flows during normothermia and were proportionately less in low flow structures. Regional CGU also decreased in all brain regions analyzed (P less than 0.001).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Isolated rabbit renal tubules were subjected to zero (control), 30 (I-30), or 60 (I-60) minutes of simulated ischemia following the method of Weinberg. Following the ischemic period, tubules were reoxygenated in a Gilson respirometer (simulated reperfusion) and treated with either halothane (1%) or isoflurane (1%) in the controls and at I-30, or halothane (1%, 2%, 4%) or verapamil (5 microM, 15 microM, 30 microM) at I-60. Tubules were analyzed for lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release (measuring cell membrane integrity), intracellular potassium and adenosine triphosphate (ATP), and oxygen consumption (cellular respiratory rate). In nonischemic tubules, exposure to 1% isoflurane caused significantly reduced LDH release compared with that released by controls, indicating cell membrane protection, whereas 1% halothane had no effect on these cells. With 30 min of ischemia, 1% isoflurane was associated with significantly higher cellular LDH release and lower ATP concentration, suggesting increased cellular damage. Halothane (1%) was associated with only an increased ATP concentration in tubules exposed to 30 min of ischemia. Following 60 min of ischemia, halothane (4%) decreased LDH release by 45% (29.2 +/- 2.3% vs. 47.0 +/- 9.6% without halothane). Tubules exposed to halothane also had higher intracellular potassium and ATP concentrations, and increased respiratory rates. Halothane (2%) was less protective and only increased the ATP concentration. The release of LDH was not statistically different with or without 2% halothane.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Electrodes were similarly fastened to the ipsilateral laminae of the fifth (T5L), seventh (T7L), and ninth (T9L) thoracic vertebrae, and the contralateral cranium over the sensorimotor cortex (SMC). Pediatric feeding tubes were used as interpleural catheters. Following interpleural bupivacaine (10 ml, 0.5%) intercostal nerve block was produced, as manifested by decreases in amplitude (range 12-32% of control, P less than 0.05), and increases in latency (range 108-126% of control, P less than 0.05), of evoked potentials recorded between T7L and rib electrodes. The block was found to localize over dependent portions of the rib with changes in animal position, indicating a strong influence of gravity. No significant changes were seen in potentials recorded between T9L and T5L, and T9L and SMC, regardless of position. T9L-T5L and T9L-SMC potentials were abolished or severely attenuated following direct subarachnoid or epidural injection of bupivacaine at T7.

This raises important questions about the ability of the young lamb to increase myocardial performance if oxygen delivery were compromised by a decrease in oxygen content during anesthesia and surgery. To investigate the ability of the young lamb to increase oxygen delivery during isoflurane anesthesia, the response to hypoxemia, which is known to increase myocardial performance, was studied in awake 1-week-old lambs. Mean systemic arterial pressure, heart rate, cardiac output, and regional distribution of blood flow were measured during three states: awake, 1.0 minimum alveolar concentration (MAC) of isoflurane in an FIO2 of 1.0, and 1.0 MAC of isoflurane in an FIO2 of 0.09. Stroke volume, total body and myocardial oxygen consumption, and fractional extraction of oxygen were calculated for the total body and for the myocardium. Isoflurane anesthesia decreased mean systemic arterial pressure (70 +/- 8 mmHg), heart rate (222 +/- 29 beats/min), and cardiac output (277 +/- 72 ml.kg-1.min-1) significantly (43 +/- 11 mmHg, 163 +/- 20 beats/min, 191 +/- 34 ml.kg-1.min-1). Hypoxemia returned heart rate to control (191 +/- 23 beats/min), increased stroke volume (1.71 +/- 0.2 ml/kg) above both control (1.23 +/- 0.2 ml/kg) and 1.0 MAC isoflurane levels (1.19 +/- 0.3 ml/kg), and increased cardiac output (325 +/- 61 ml.kg-1.min-1) above the level during 1.0 MAC isoflurane.\r"

The extrinsic supply is responsive to adrenergic stimuli. In this study we measured nerve blood flow in rat sciatic nerves with a laser Doppler flow probe. Normal saline, solutions of 1% or 2% lidocaine HCl with and without 1:200,000 epinephrine, or 1:200,000 epinephrine in normal saline were topically applied to the nerves to determine their effect on nerve blood flow. At the end of the subsequent 10-min recording period, blood flow was significantly depressed for all of the solutions tested except saline. Reductions of blood flow ranged from 19.3% for 1% lidocaine HCl to 77.8% for 2% lidocaine HCl with epinephrine. Epinephrine by itself significantly reduced nerve blood flow; when added to local anesthetic solutions, it reduced nerve blood flow to a greater extent than the reduction caused by anesthetics alone. There was an additional significant reduction in nerve blood flow when the epinephrine groups were compared with the pure local anesthetic groups.\r"

Before the adrenaline infusions the volunteers were treated for three days with either a non-selective beta-blocking agent (propranolol) or a beta-1-selective agent (atenolol) or with placebo. Six of the volunteers underwent a fourth adrenaline infusion after pretreatment with a beta-2-selective beta-blocking agent (ICI 118551). S-Mg and S-FFA were determined every fifteen minutes. After pretreatment with placebo, adrenaline infusion caused an increase in S-FFA from 0.22 +/- 0.20 mmol/L (mean +/- SD) to max 0.59 +/- 0.39 mmol/L after thirty minutes of adrenaline infusion (p less than 0.001). At one hundred twenty minutes S-FFA had decreased to 0.35 +/- 0.26 mmol/L. Thirty minutes after cessation of the adrenaline infusion, S-FFA had returned to the same level as before the infusion. S-Mg before the adrenaline infusion was 0.83 +/- 0.05 mmol/L, rose to 0.85 +/- 0.05 at fifteen minutes, and then decreased to 0.78 +/- 0.05 at one hundred thirty-five minutes (p less than 0.05). Pretreatment with atenolol did not change this pattern, although the changes in S-FFA and S-Mg were of a smaller magnitude but still statistically significant.\r"

  ".W": "One hundred thirty-four patients, in whom acute and subacute arterial occlusions of lower limbs were treated with low dose intraarterial streptokinase, were observed for periods of up to five years. Primary recanalization of occluded vessels was achieved in 66 patients, but in the remaining 68 patients recanalization was not observed. In 45% of the patients with successful thrombolytic treatment, percutaneous dilatation (PTA) of remnant stenosis was performed. In patients with successful recanalization the reocclusion rate was greatest in the first year (17.4%); the first two weeks after therapy were most critical in this respect. The reocclusion rate during the succeeding years ranged from 4% to 9% per year. The cumulative patency rate after five years was 63.4%. Late results were better in patients in whom more proximal vascular segments were affected. The preservation of vessel patency was highly dependent on the severity and extent of the previous atherosclerotic process and especially on the state of peripheral (runoff) arteries. Presence of diabetes mellitus increased the reocclusion rate of recanalized vessels. Of the patients with unsuccessful recanalization, only 5 reported some symptomatic improvement during the observation period, 39 (57%) needed immediate amputation, and an additional 8 (4.7%) were amputated later on. Considering the fact that all patients were previously refused for bypass surgery owing to unsuitable runoff vessels or bad general condition, the long-term results were surprisingly good, suggesting that thrombolytic treatment, combined in remnant stenosis with PTA, was an efficient method in patients with acute or subacute arterial occlusions.\r"

Average preresuscitation systolic blood pressure was 71 mmHg, pulse was 105 beats/minute, and temperature was 34.3 degrees C. Initial resuscitation was with the RSAS, and total fluid infused in the first twenty-four hours averaged 4,632 mL of blood, 1,914 mL of blood products, and 11,248 mL of crystalloid. The average postresuscitation systolic blood pressure was 120 mmHg, pulse was 96 beats/minute, and temperature averaged 34.9 degrees C. Survival at twenty-four hours was 29/50 (58%). There were no local complications of RSAS use and no evidence of infusion-related coagulopathy.

  ".W": "Although the diagnosis of AIDS-associated heart disease is becoming routine, its treatment has not been reported except in anecdote. Also, it has been unclear whether the odds of successful treatment are altered because of the presence of cardiac involvement per se. This communication reports the authors' treatment of 18 patients with AIDS-associated heart disease. Their results are combined with the treatment results of all patients reported in the literature to date with AIDS-associated heart disease. Treatment success, defined as eradication of the organism and no relapse, was achieved in their patients with M. tuberculosis (M. tb), cardiac cryptococcosis, and Salmonella typhimurium. M. tb required emergency pericardiectomy (well tolerated in all patients), then administration of rifampin, isoniazid, and ethambutol. Cryptococcosis was treated acutely with amphotericin B and flucytosine, then with maintenance amphotericin B. The response, which included resolution of congestive heart failure, occurred within a week. Salmonella endocarditis was cured with administration of ampicillin and netilmicin for one month. When the patients' data were combined with those of patients from the literature, the authors found that the odds of successful treatment for tuberculous pericarditis were somewhat lower than if the tuberculosis was extracardiac (50% vs 67%). With cryptococcal heart disease, the odds of successful treatment were actually significantly better than when only extracardiac disease was present. The authors conclude that infectious forms of AIDS-associated heart disease are often treatable. Although some cardiac infections are less likely to respond to treatment if there is cardiac involvement, mostly the response to treatment is similar to the response with only extracardiac involvement.\r"

The time of day variation in circulating lymphocytes appears to affect T cells rather than B cells. The absolute numbers of OKT4+ cells at 8 AM was significantly higher than at 2 PM (p less than 0.05). It would appear that the OKT4+ cells are largely responsible for the time of day variation in peripheral blood lymphocytes, owing probably to a greater sensitivity to changes in plasma cortisol levels.\r"

The laser's greatest problem has been damage of the arterial wall and even perforation. The purpose of this presentation is to clarify the present status of available lasers for the treatment of peripheral vascular disease of the lower extremities. To this end, the initial experience with angioscopically guided laser-assisted angioplasty with a new hybrid laser probe is reported.\r"

While plasma viscosity and erythrocyte aggregation did not change significantly, there was marked improvement in erythrocyte deformability and yield shear stress. Nine patients improved clinically, 1 died. In 40 patients with lacunar infarcts (Study B) clinical and hemorheologic data were recorded during a three-month treatment with 800 to 1,600 mg oral pentoxifylline per day. The above-quoted variables, being pathologically altered in comparison with healthy controls, were again monitored. Thirty-six patients completed the study (4 dropouts). Clinically, 34 patients improved during treatment, 2 worsened. Hemorheologic variables, which were pathologically altered at baseline, improved significantly. Improvement of accompanying disturbances in the retinal microcirculation (confirmed by video fluorescence angiography) during therapy indicated a close correlation between hemorheologic factors and microcirculation.\r"

Patients with various degrees of peripheral vascular disease (stages II, III, and IV according to Fontaine's classification) were treated with HBT. Clinical symptoms improved in 70%. Ankle/brachial index increased by more than 0.10 in 47%. Photoplethysmographic pulse appearance has been detected in roughly one third of patients. Transcutaneous oxygen tension did not, however, improve significantly. Plasma malondialdehyde (MDA) was evaluated as a marker of lipid peroxidation, possibly influenced by hyperbaric oxygen. Surprisingly, the authors found that MDA levels decreased after HBT, probably as a result of the activation of antioxidant systems. These results show that HBT represents a useful approach in the treatment of peripheral vascular disease, since it improves clinical and hemodynamic parameters, with no potentially harmful side effects, such as enhanced lipid peroxidation, at least in the short term.\r"

A comparison between the allergic rhinitis group in which methacholine PC20 was more than 4.66 mg/mL and the allergic rhinitis group which presented negative results in the methacholine bronchial challenge test, indicated that there were significant differences in skin test reactivity and the ratio of specific IgE to total IgE (P less than .05). The allergic responses we observed were not different between the allergic rhinitis group in which methacholine PC20 was less than 4.66 mg/mL (asthmatic range of methacholine PC20) and the allergic rhinitis group in which methacholine PC20 was more than 4.66 mg/mL. When comparing the bronchial asthma group which showed positive results in D. farinae-RAST and the allergic rhinitis group in which methacholine PC20 was less than 4.66 mg/mL, significant differences were noted in total IgE level (P less than .05). These findings suggest that the development of bronchial asthma in patients with allergic rhinitis might be predicted by measuring the degree of bronchial hyperreactivity and their allergic responses.\r"

  ".W": "Allergen dot radioimmunoassay (dot-RIA), employing nitrocellulose filter paper (NFP) as the solid phase, and a Phadebas RAST tracer as the detecting antibody was used to measure the absolute amount of specific IgE to Dermatophagoides farinae (D. farinae) in forty-five D. farinae-sensitive patients and ten negative controls. These results with dot-RIA were compared with those with D. farinae radioallergosorbent test (RAST). When the elution of D. farinae-specific IgE from antibody-dotted NFP complex by alkaline buffer (pH 11.0) was done and followed by measurement of IgE contents in various dilutions of eluate to construct a standard curve, D. farinae-RAST exhibited greater binding than dot-RIA. There was a similar high degree of correlation of specific IgE levels between the ratio of specific IgE to total IgE by dot-RIA and RAST when compared with the wheal size on skin prick test to D. farinae. It was suggested that dot-RIA using NFP as the solid phase-a simple, less expensive, and reproducible method-is applicable for measuring the absolute level of specific IgE to D. farinae and for determining the relationship between the ratio of specific IgE to total IgE and the wheal size on skin prick test in D. farinae-sensitive patients.\r"

Recent reports have suggested that tests to measure levels of antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA) are useful in the diagnosis and management of WG. We developed an enzyme-linked immunoassay (ELISA) utilizing neutrophil granules and their fractions to detect such antibodies. We identified the major antigen in patients with WG as contained in a protein peak of 25-30,000 molecular weight. ELISA testing of patient, normal control, and disease control sera showed that the ELISA test suffered from a lack of specificity. It detected positive results in 19 of 49 disease control sera that were primarily from patients with diseases such as lupus erythematosus. Visual examination, by indirect immunofluorescence using patients' sera to stain normal fixed neutrophils, identified the coursely speckled (granule associated) WG binding pattern in seven of eight WG patients and this was distinguishable from the pattern of binding in non-WG sera. While the techniques such as the ELISA and flow cytometry are useful in identifying sera with antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies, positive sera should still be examined by visual fluorescence microscopy when entertaining the diagnosis of WG. Under these circumstances, tests for ANCA will be very useful in the diagnosis and management of WG.\r"

There was a positive correlation between the survey of flowering and airborne pollen counts, although pollen was occasionally found after the flowering season. Further, it predicted fairly accurately the beginning of the flowering time of each species in each regio, the expected flowering duration, and intensity. Conducting a survey of flowering is a simple, easy and inexpensive operation. It is highly recommended for regions with variable climates.\r"

We have also studied the daily variation of pollen concentration, which peaked between 10 AM and 3 PM. In order to determine the incidence of pollinotic patients sensitive to pollen grains from Chenopodium, we reviewed 1000 clinical records available in the Allergy Unit and found 8.42% to be allergic. On evaluation of the time evolution of the symptoms we found that most patients continued to show them until September each year.\r"

By 4 months of life, infants fed formula or breast milk with formula supplementation had elevated IgE and IgG antibody levels to CMPs, when compared with values before 1 month of age. Further, breast-fed infants demonstrated significantly lower levels of IgE and IgG antibodies to CMPs than infants who received formula or breast milk with formula supplementation. Clinical symptoms of cow milk allergy were more common in infants fed formula or breast fed with supplementation, but were not significantly related to the presence of specific antibody. Our data suggest that the formation of CMP antibodies may reflect a normal humoral response following exposure to CMP antigens in this age group.\r"

Determination of preventable death was made by a panel of experts and compared with an identical review of traumatic deaths in 1979, five years before the institution of regionalized trauma care. Of 211 traumatic deaths reviewed from 1986, two (1%) were classified as preventable, compared with 20 of 177 (11.4%) deaths in 1979 (P less than .001). A breakdown of trauma deaths into central nervous system and noncentral nervous system categories revealed the overall decline was in large part a consequence of the decline in non-central nervous system deaths from 16 of 83 in 1979 to one of 62 in 1986 (P less than .005). The decrease in central nervous system-related preventable deaths from four of 94 in 1979 to one of 149 in 1986 (P less than .10) was not statistically significant. Although it is likely the trauma system introduced in 1984 contributed to the decline in preventable death, it is not possible to isolate this variable from other changes that occurred during the interval between studies. A review of trauma deaths over the same time interval in a community with similar demographics but without a trauma system might help determine the relative contribution of the trauma system.\r"

During the nine-month study period, 251 Level 1 trauma patients were transported to the Cook County Hospital trauma unit by Chicago Fire Department (CFD) paramedics. The prehospital times and survival rates in the 203 (81%) patients who arrived with vital signs were analyzed. In this group, 64 (32%) had a hospital Trauma Score (TS) of 12 or less, 74 (39%) had at least one Abbreviated Injury Score (AIS) of 4 or more, and 58 (30%) had an Injury Severity Score (ISS) of more than 20. There were 66 (32%) directly transported patients and 137 (68%) patients who required hospital bypass. The time from CFD contact (by 911) to trauma center arrival (total run time) was on the average three minutes longer in the bypass group than in the direct group (36 +/- 11 vs 33 +/- 10 minutes, P less than .05). The travel time from the scene to the hospital (transport time) also was three minutes longer in the bypass group (7 +/- 3 vs 4 +/- 2 minutes, P less than .005). The need for bypass did not significantly influence survival. Survival was 86% in the bypass group and 85% in the direct group. The elapsed time between the injury and CFD contact (delay time) averaged 27 +/- 26 minutes and contributed 43% to the 63-minute mean overall time from the injury event to arrival at the trauma center. Total run time in directly transported patients accounted for 52% of the mean overall prehospital time.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

We used a four-component model of occupational stress in medical environments to show indications that much variation in the manifestation of stress was accounted for by the rank and job description of the EMT-paramedic, the district served by the EMT-paramedic, and the patient population served by the EMT-paramedic. Stress exhibited by field EMT-paramedics tended to manifest in more negative attitudes toward patients, whereas administrative-level paramedics exhibited more organizational stress. We noted that the age of the EMT-paramedic and the length of time employed as an EMT-paramedic correlated with the level of occupational stress (P less than .05). The recent occurrence of significant life events also was significantly related to the level of stress (P less than .05). An EMT-paramedic's gender, marital status, and number of calls per shift had no significant correlation to the level of occupational stress. Based on these results, we recommend tailoring occupational stress programs to meet the needs of individual EMT-paramedics. Special attempts should be made to identify and counsel EMT-paramedics who are undergoing stressful life events. Finally, we suggest that rotating EMT-paramedics through various districts on a regular basis may help alleviate the negative impact on patient care in areas that have been identified as particularly stressful. Further studies are needed to verify our hypothesis.\r"

Univariate analyses of variance revealed overall differences in both stress and depression. Mean levels of stress and depression were higher for women residents, and unmarried residents reported more depressive symptomatology. The results indicate that women emergency medicine residents experience more stress and depression than men and that spouses can buffer some of the stress of residency training for men and women residents. No significant differences in stress or depression by year in training were revealed by univariate analysis of variance, which suggests that residents experience stress throughout the course of training. The similarities and differences in the occupational stress and depression experienced by emergency medicine residents in comparison with residents from other specialties suggest that additional study in emergency medicine is warranted.\r"

With an experimental model that produces cerebral ischemia by bilateral carotid ligation combined with systemic hypotension, previous studies have shown that treatment with 25 mg/kg sodium dichloroacetate (DCA) is effective in reducing brain lactate more quickly than no treatment at all. Because higher doses of DCA may be more effective, the main objective of our study was to examine the dose-response of brain tissue lactate to DCA. In addition, other metabolites that may be indirectly affected by this response (eg, glucose, glycogen, ATP, and phosphocreatine) also were measured. Adult male Wistar rats were assigned to experimental and treatment groups, and real or sham ischemia was induced as described in our previous article. After 30 minutes of reperfusion, rats were euthanized by in situ freezing of the brain. Cerebral cortex, hippocampus, and cerebellum were analyzed bilaterally. There was no effect of DCA dose on glucose or glycogen. When compared with hippocampus, lactate was higher in the cerebral cortex after ischemia, and DCA was more effective in reducing those levels. This is evidence of a lower metabolic rate in hippocampus than in cortex. Cerebellum did not exhibit an increase in lactate; therefore, it can serve as an in situ tissue control for that metabolite. Significantly different levels of metabolites in one hemisphere of some DCA-treated ischemic rats appeared to reflect a dose effect of DCA on lactate and a significant change in ATP and phosphocreatine at the higher doses.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The purpose of our study was to determine whether changes in the frequency or amplitude of the ventricular fibrillation ECG signal during cardiac arrest could be used to estimate downtime. We characterized the dynamics of both total power and frequency distribution of the power in the ECG during ventricular fibrillation in 11 swine to determine whether enough information existed in either parameter to estimate downtime. The median frequency of the power spectrum was used to track power distribution. Both parameters followed a dynamic, repeatable pattern. However, median frequency showed less intersubject variability than did total power. A mathematical model of median frequency was developed and used with data obtained from ten additional swine to estimate downtime. The model estimated downtime to within 1.3 minutes of actual downtime between one and ten minutes of ventricular fibrillation. Our study has identified a new, potentially useful parameter for studying various management strategies in ventricular fibrillation as a function of downtime.\r"

The degree of severity (ie, asymptomatic, mild, moderate, or severe) as determined by plotting the serum concentration and time on the nomogram for 55 acute salicylate intoxications was compared with the degree of severity decided on by three experienced emergency physicians who based their decision on the clinical presentation of the cases and the original criteria devised by Done for each category of severity. Discordant classifications between the nomogram and the physicians provided a basis on which a predictive index for the nomogram and various subsets of cases could be determined. The calculated predictive index for the nomogram was 0.42, with the highest predictive index of 0.79 in the mild salicylate category. The nomogram tends to overpredict the severity of intoxication in the moderate and severe categories. There was no significant difference between predictive indexes of mixed versus nonmixed or enteric-coated acetylsalicylic acid versus plain acetylsalicylic acid cases, although the nomogram had a higher predictive index when used for concentrations drawn six to 12 hours after ingestion (P less than .01, Fisher's exact test). Decisions on management of an acute salicylate overdose should be based on clinical presentation and good judgment as well as the serum salicylate concentration in relation to the time of ingestion.\r"

Seventy-one patients who presented to the emergency department filled out visual analog pain scores (range, 0 to 10) before and after use of topical anesthetic (proparacaine 0.5%). Mean initial pain scores were higher (6.3 +/- 3.0 vs 4.8 +/- 2.8, P less than .05), final pain scores were lower (1.1 +/- 1.7 vs 3.5 +/- 2.5, P less than .001), and changes in scores were greater (5.2 +/- 3.0 vs 1.3 +/- 1.3, P less than .001) in patients who had simple corneal injury compared with those who had other causes of acute eye pain. By defining response to topical anesthetic as a reduction in pain score by more than 5 (on a scale of 1 to 10) or as a final pain score of less than 1, we found the sensitivity of this test for simple corneal injury to be 80% and the specificity to be 86%. This information is useful to physicians, either with or without a slitlamp, attempting to diagnose the cause of acute eye pain.\r"

Previously, physicians have not had information about what hazardous chemicals were in their community or a warning that release of a hazardous chemical had occurred. The Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act of 1986, known as Title III of the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act (SARA), now mandates that every facility using, storing, or manufacturing hazardous chemicals make public its inventory and report every release of a hazardous chemical to public officials and health personnel. Every facility also must cooperate with physicians who are treating victims of exposure. Emergency physicians, both in their role in their community's emergency medical services system and as physicians in emergency departments, will soon be involved in many aspects of SARA's numerous ramifications. This report is intended to familiarize the emergency physician with the basic components of Title III of SARA.\r"

Even though many states have passed mandatory reporting laws, most provide little or no funding for meaningful intervention. All physicians should become familiar with applicable elder abuse laws and the procedure for referring a suspected case. This presentation of our findings is necessarily brief and should not take the place of familiarity with the legislation in the reader's own state. A copy of relevant state legislation generally can be obtained from the local state legislator's office or law library.\r"

One hundred thirty-three patients with 140 fractures were reviewed relative to fracture site, oral versus nasal route of intubation, and location of intubation (surgery versus emergency department or field). Fracture site incidence was determined as follows: C-1, ten (7.1%); odontoid/C-2, 17 (12.1%); C-3, eight (5.7%); C-4, 21 (15.0%); C-5, 41 (29.2%); C-6, 38 (27.1%); and C-7, five (3.5%). Ten of the injuries resulted from blows to the neck or head, 25 from falls, seven from diving, and six from sports-related injuries. The remaining eighty-five patients were in motor vehicle accidents. Nine patients were nasally intubated in the ED, and one patient was orally intubated in the field. Ninety-four of the patients intubated in surgery were intubated nasally: 29 were intubated orally while in-line stabilization was maintained. No neurologic complications occurred in any patient. These data suggest that, under controlled circumstances, patients with unstable cervical spine fractures can be safely intubated with standard, nonsurgical approaches.\r"

To simulate the infected, non-diseased state of humans, a nonreplicating bacillary population of limited size was developed in the mouse. Mice were vaccinated intravenously with 2.74 log10 M. bovis BCG and infected a month later with 3.38 log10 M. tuberculosis. Treatment began 2 wk after infection when the mean size of the M. tuberculosis population was 4.98 +/- 0.26 log10 cfu in the spleen. After 2 months of therapy, the proportion of mice with positive spleen cultures was 100%, 50%, 0%, and 20% in those animals treated, respectively, with INH alone, RMP alone, RMP + PZA, or RMP + PZA + INH. After 6 months of therapy with INH alone, the proportion of mice with positive spleen cultures was 38%. In order to confirm the extreme activity of the combination RMP + PZA and to assess the value of 3 months of therapy with RMP, a second experiment was performed following similar procedures. On completion of treatment, the proportion of mice with positive spleen cultures was 100%, 20%, 0%, and 80% in those animals treated, respectively, for 6 months with INH alone, 3 months with RMP alone, or 2 months with RMP + PZA, or RMP + PZA + INH.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

We have investigated the establishment and maintenance of compliance with isoniazid prophylaxis in this population. Factors affecting compliance were studied in a sample of young men who were found to be tubercullin-reactive at the time of their incarceration. Compliance was quantified by determining the number of doses taken divided by the total number of available doses. Mean compliance for the 74 subjects was 37.5%. Two factors were important determinants of compliance: (1) the building where the inmate was incarcerated and (2) his knowledge of tuberculoses and the isoniazed regimen. The influence of the housing unit on compliance suggests that administrative responses to prison overcrowding, an increasingly prevalent condition in the nation's jails and prisons, may have an unintended and detrimental effect on medical care and public health.\r"

All of 14 strains of M. avium complex, isolated from patients with AIDS, grew inside J774 cells during an incubation period of 7 days. The susceptibility of macrophage-ingested M. avium complex to antimicrobial agents was determined by comparing the number of colony-forming units (cfu) of M. avium complex inside untreated macrophages at the time of drug addition with the number of cfu present in macrophages after treatment with drugs for 7 days. Simultaneous experiments were carried out in broth medium without macrophages in order to compare killing of free mycobacteria with killing of macrophage-ingested mycobacteria. Antimicrobial agents (rifampin, rifabutin [Ansamycin], ethambutol, ciprofloxacin, clofazimine, isoniazid, and amikacin) were tested using concentrations that are achievable in the serum of patients. Among drugs known to penetrate macrophages, there was 96.2% agreement in susceptibility test results between the broth experiments and the J774 experiments when single drugs were tested, but only 74% agreement when combinations of drugs were tested. Killing of M. avium complex inside J774 cells by any single drug was uncommon. However, killing in J774 cells occurred against 10 of 11 (91%) strains with the combination of rifabutin + ethambutol + ciprofloxacin and against all of seven strains tested with the combination of rifabutin + ethambutol + amikacin. Interpretive criteria of in vitro susceptibility data need to be developed so that these interpretations correlate with a predictable clinical response in patients.\r"

To determine differences in P. carinii pneumonia in patients with and without AIDS, the P. carinii parasite numbers, lung inflammatory cell populations, gas exchange, and survival were assessed in a series of 75 consecutive patients with P. carinii pneumonia. Bronchoalveolar lavage was used to quantify the parasite and inflammatory cell numbers in these patients. The data from this study indicate: (1) patients with P. carinii pneumonia and AIDS have significantly greater numbers of P. carinii per ml of lavage compared to other immunocompromised patients with P. carinii pneumonia (p less than 0.0001); (2) patients with P. carinii pneumonia and AIDS also have significantly fewer neutrophils recovered in the lavage compared to other immunocompromised patients with P. carinii pneumonia (p = 0.0001); (3) patients with AIDS and P. carinii pneumonia have higher arterial oxygen tensions than those patients with P. carinii pneumonia in conditions other than AIDS (p = 0.008); and (4) increased lavage neutrophils (rather than parasite number) correlate with poorer oxygenation and poorer patient survival (p = 0.01). This investigation demonstrates substantial differences in lung inflammation and parasite number during P. carinii pneumonia in patients with and without AIDS. The data further suggest that lung inflammation contributes substantially to respiratory impairment in patients with P. carinii pneumonia.\r"

  ".U": "90054617\r", 
  ".W": "Lipoxygenase metabolites of arachidonic acid have been proposed as possible mediators of hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction (HPV) in the rat. Since reduced glutathione (GSH) is a required substrate for the synthesis of the sulfidopeptide eicosanoid leukotriene C4 (LTC4), we reasoned that this specific GSH dependence of LTC4 synthesis might allow us to distinguish between the roles of sulfidopeptide leukotrienes and other 5-lipoxygenase metabolites of arachidonic acid. In the present study we have examined the effect of in vivo pretreatment with the GSH synthesis inhibitor buthionine sulfoximine (BSO) on both the hypoxic pressor response and lung leukotriene synthesis in the rat. The intraperitoneal administration of 4 mmol/kg of BSO 30, 20, and 4 h prior to lung excision significantly depleted total lung glutathione as compared to saline-pretreated controls. This depletion of glutathione was associated with a significant attenuation of HPV in isolated perfused lungs but no alteration in pressor response to angiotensin II or KCl. In addition, hypoxia-associated LTC4 levels in lung homogenates were significantly lower in animals pretreated with BSO than in saline-pretreated controls. The specificity of the effects of BSO on lung leukotriene synthesis was examined by quantitating immunoreactive leukotrienes produced by unstimulated and ionophore A23187-stimulated parenchymal lung fragments, lonophore stimulation of lung fragments from BSO-pretreated rats produced 76 +/- 12.2% as much LTC4 and 127 +/- 22.3% as much leukotriene B4 as did fragments from saline-pretreated rats. Our data demonstrating that GSH depletion caused parallel reductions in both HPV and hypoxia-associated lung LTC4 levels are therefore consistent with the hypothesis that sulfidopeptide leukotrienes are involved in this pressor response in the rat.\r"

  ".W": "Patients with asthma frequently show a bimodal distribution of ventilation-perfusion (VA/Q) ratios. One mode is centered on a VA/Q ratio of near normal value, whereas the other has a very low VA/Q ratio. There is usually almost no perfusion of unventilated units. We have suggested that this bimodal pattern is caused by complete obstruction of some airways with ventilation of their distal alveoli through collateral channels. To test this hypothesis we occluded airways of anesthetized dogs with beads of 1.6, 2.4, and 4.8 mm in diameter, and measured VA/Q distributions using the multiple inert gas elimination technique. Beads were inserted via a bronchoscope until the Pao2 fell by 20 mm Hg, or its value was less than 70 mm Hg. Occlusion of small airways (1.6 mm diameter) resulted in a mild increase in dispersion of VA/Q ratios. With 2.4 mm beads, the dispersion increased further. By contrast, all dogs given 4.8 mm beads showed a bimodal distribution of VA/Q ratios. All animals developed some shunt. We interpret these results as showing that when 1.6 mm airways are occluded, collateral ventilation to distal units is so efficient that ventilation is only mildly impaired; however, as occlusion becomes more proximal, collateral ventilation is less effective until with 4.8 mm beads, the ventilation of distal units is so poor that a bimodal pattern develops. The results suggest that the bimodal distributions seen in asthma are compatible with complete obstruction of some airways, and that the levels of obstruction may affect the pattern of VA/Q distribution.\r"

We monitored blood pressure, electrocardiogram, and radionuclide ejection fraction in 14 healthy volunteers on exposure to four experimental conditions: expiratory resistive loading while breathing room air (RAL), expiratory resistive loading while hypoxic (HL), hypoxia alone (H), and expiratory resistive loading while voluntarily hyperventilating in a pattern similar to HL trials (VL). Mean respiratory-related oscillation in systolic blood pressure (pulsus paradoxus) increased significantly under each experimental condition compared with those at baseline (2 +/- 2.3 mm Hg): for RAL, 21 +/- 8.4 mm Hg; for HL, 34 +/- 16.3 mm Hg; for H, 10 +/- 5.4 mm Hg; for VL 26 +/- 13.4 mm Hg. Pulsus paradoxus was significantly greater under conditions of moderate hypoxia (saturation, 80%) than of mild hypoxia (saturation, 90%). Electrocardiographic changes were more marked under HL and H conditions than under RAL and VL conditions. HL induced changes in blood pressure and frontal QRS axis that were qualitatively similar to those seen in naturally occurring asthma. Radionuclide ejection fraction showed no dramatic change with any experimental condition. We conclude that hypoxia magnifies the cardiovascular changes induced by acute expiratory resistive loads and may contribute to the degree of pulsus paradoxus seen in severe asthma.\r"

To this end experiments were carried out in anesthetized dogs in which pulmonary vasoconstriction was induced by infusion of histamine, serotonin, or norepinephrine or by hypoxia. In a group of closed chest dogs, the time course for the fall in the catheter tip pressure toward the wedge pressure was different for the different vasoconstrictors. For example, during histamine infusion the fall in pressure was slow, whereas during serotonin infusion it was rapid. To evaluate the information in the decay curves, a group of dogs was studied with open thorax to permit the simultaneous occlusion of both the artery and vein of one lung lobe (double occlusion) as well as occlusion of the lobar artery alone (arterial occlusion). The pattern of response to the various vasoconstrictors observed with lobar arterial occlusion was similar in these animals to the closed chest animals. The equilibrium pressure after double occlusion (the double occlusion pressure), expressed as a fraction of the mean arterial-venous pressure difference before occlusion, was correlated with the mean decay time of the arterial pressure curve after arterial occlusion. We also found significant correlations between the double occlusion pressure and the estimates of capillary pressure based on model interpretations of the pressure decay curve after arterial occlusion. However, there was wide scatter in the individual comparisons.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Nocturnal oxyhemoglobin desaturation (NOD) has been reported in patients with disease of the pulmonary parenchyma and/or chest wall. The resulting hypoxemia could play a role in the development of pulmonary hypertension. We have previously demonstrated a small but statistically significant difference in resting pulmonary artery pressure (Ppa) and pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) between two groups of patients with COPD of similar age, symptomatology, and degree of pulmonary dysfunction. These two groups were selected only on the basis of the presence or absence of NOD, and all had a mean daytime PaO2 at or above 60 mm Hg. The present study uses exercise to stress the pulmonary circulation of two groups of patients similar to the above. The purpose was to see if exercise can amplify underlying cardiopulmonary hemodynamic differences between NOD and non-NOD subjects. In addition, we attempted to confirm or refute previous studies which claimed that exercise desaturation correlates with NOD. Resting supine, resting upright, and upright exercise cardiopulmonary hemodynamics were measured using an indwelling right heart catheter, and arterial blood and expiratory gases were collected to assess metabolic and other gas exchange parameters. Although both groups showed increase in Ppa during exercise, the increases in systolic Ppa, mean Ppa, and driving pressure were disparately higher in subjects with NOD. Exercise desaturation was not predictive of NOD. The presence of NOD was predictive of a resting PVR greater than 120 dyne.s.cm-5, whereas mean sleep SaO2 and daytime PaO2 were unable to discriminate patients with COPD above or below this level.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The patients, seven men and one woman with a mean age of 63 +/- 2.8 (SEM) yr (FEV1 33 +/- 5.2% of predicted), required MV for 9.0 +/- 2.4 days prior to the study. The patients were studied at maintenance FIO2 (0.28 to 0.40) while breathing 100% O2, both during MV and SV. After 30 min of SV, PaCO2 increased from 48.9 +/- 3.4 to 58.3 +/- 3.1 mm Hg (p = 0.003) and pH decreased from 7.42 +/- 0.01 to 7.36 +/- 0.01 (p = 0.001) without significant changes in PaO2. Despite a decrease in tidal volume (VT) from 700.0 +/- 41.1 during MV to 313.0 +/- 39.6 ml during SV (p = 0.001), minute ventilation remained unchanged (from 8.2 +/- 0.7 during MV to 7.4 +/- 0.6 L/min during SV). Furthermore, cardiac output (QT), oxygen delivery (QO2), and mixed venous PO2 (PVO2) significantly rose during SV when compared with the MV (QT: from 4.7 +/- 0.4 to 6.7 +/- 0.7 L/min, p = 0.011; QO2: from 857.3 +/- 113.0 to 1078.5 +/- 158.9 ml/min, p = 0.0074; PVO2: from 36.7 +/- 1.1 to 42.3 +/- 2.2 mm Hg, p = 0.041). Overall VA/Q inequality worsened as blood flow was redistributed to low VA/Q areas (from 9.4 +/- 4.4 to 19.6 +/- 5.3% of QT, p = 0.05). The dispersion of the ventilation distribution (log SDV) significantly worsened during SV (from 1.0 +/- 0.08 during MV to 1.2 +/- 0.08 during SV, p = 0.044).

Recent work has implicated coexisting chronic airflow limitation (CAL) as an important contributing factor. We approached this question by studying consecutive patients with both OSA syndrome and severe CAL in detail and comparing those with and without retention of CO2 while awake. Of 28 patients with both severe OSA (mean NREM apnea index = 48 +/- 9, SEM) and severe CAL (mean FEV1 = 1.07 +/- 0.07 L), 14 had persistent awake hypercapnia (mean PaCO2 = 50 +/- 1 mm Hg), and 14 were normocapnic (mean PaCO2 = 40 +/- 1 mm Hg). When separated according to their PaCO2 level, there was no difference in the apnea indices in both non-rapid-eye-movement (NREM) sleep, or rapid-eye-movement (REM) sleep, although the hypercapnic group had lower average levels of oxyhemoglobin saturation in both NREM (SaO2 = 77 +/- 2% versus 85 +/- 3%, p less than 0.05) and REM (SaO2 = 60 +/- 4% versus 82 +/- 3%, p less than 0.001) sleep. The mean values for FEV1, VC, lung volumes, and diffusing capacity for CO measured while awake did not differ. The hypercapnic group had lower awake PaO2 levels (p less than 0.001), were heavier (p less than 0.05), had narrower upper airway size on CT scan measurements (p less than 0.01), and gave a history of much heavier alcohol intake (p less than 0.05). Our results demonstrate that some patients with severe OSA and severe CAL can maintain normal awake arterial CO2 levels.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The upper airway was isolated from the lower airway by transecting the cervical trachea, and the pressure flow relationship of the upper airway was obtained by applying constant negative pressure (5, 10, and 20 cm H2O) to the proximal cut end of the trachea. Electrical stimulation of the genioglossus was performed at a constant voltage (10 to 20 V) and at various frequencies (as high as 100 Hz). Upper airway resistance (Rua) during both inspiration and expiration increased with an increase in tracheal negative pressure, and at each tracheal negative pressure Rua was significantly reduced by stimulation of the genioglossus. The effects of genioglossal muscle stimulation were nonlinearly dependent on the stimulating frequency. Below 50 Hz, Rua decreased markedly as the stimulating frequency was increased, but above 50 Hz, Rua plateaued at a minimum value. These findings suggest that at a stimulating frequency of more than 50 Hz, upper airway patency is stably maintained in anesthetized dogs.\r"

Six patients with OSAS were polysomnographically studied in the supine position during all-night sessions with and without electrical stimulation of the genioglossus. Using an apnea demand-type stimulator that we developed, electrical pulses of 0.5 ms (repetition rate, 50 Hz) and 15 to 40 V were delivered through bipolar electrodes (10 mm in diameter) attached to the skin of the submental region when apnea lasted more than 5 s, and was stopped immediately after breathing resumed or after 10 s at the longest. With submental stimulation, the apnea index, apnea time/total sleep time, longest apnea duration, and the number of times per hour that oxygen saturation dropped below 85% decreased significantly compared with those on control nights. The lowest arterial oxygen saturation and the duration of sleep stages III and IV increased significantly. The stimulation employed did not cause arousal, and it did not affect blood pressure or heart rate significantly. These findings show that submental stimulation decreases the incidence of apnea episodes and promotes deeper sleep without accompanying serious side effects, suggesting that the apnea demand-type stimulator may be a noninvasive and effective treatment for OSAS.\r"

Coughs disappeared as a complaint an average of 161 +/- 75 days after medical therapy for GER. Comparisons of pretreatment and post-treatment EPM data revealed the following: numbers of coughs (p = 0.029), total refluxes (p = 0.001), refluxes greater than or equal to 5 min (p = 0.019), and reflux-induced coughs (p = 0.005) had significantly decreased in the distal esophagus, and total refluxes (p = 0.05) had significantly decreased in the proximal esophagus. During the entire study period, the number of coughs were significantly correlated with the number of total refluxes (p = 0.039), longest reflux (p = 0.019), number of refluxes greater than or equal to 5 min (p = 0.006), and percent of total time that pH was less than 4 (p = 0.017) in the distal esophagus. On the basis of these results, we conclude that (1) cough can be the sole presenting manifestation of GER, and it gradually responds to standard GER therapy; (2) prolonged EPM is safe, well-tolerated, and extremely useful in diagnosing clinically silent GER; (3) the mechanism by which GER causes cough is related to a critical number and/or duration of reflux episodes in the distal and/or proximal esophagus.\r"

We have determined the ventilatory and arousal responses to the addition of inspiratory resistance of 4, 7, or 10 cmH2O/L/s during sleep in 10 normal men who slept wearing valved face masks. Insufficient ventilatory response data were obtained during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep to allow adequate analysis. The immediate responses to loading were decreases in tidal volume (VT), breathing frequency (f), and minute ventilation (VE), with no difference between wakefulness and Stage 2 and Stage 3/4 sleep in the effects of loading on VT and VE, but f fell more during wakefulness than during sleep (p less than 0.05) because of a greater lengthening of inspired time (TI) (p less than 0.05). During the first 10 breaths, occlusion pressure (P0.1) increased similarly in all EEG stages. Averaging responses during the 2-min periods when resistances were applied, the only variable to differ between EEG stages was TI, which increased more in wakefulness than in Stage 2 or Stage 3/4 sleep (p less than 0.01). Arousal within 2 min of application of resistance occurred less frequently from Stage 3/4 sleep than from Stage 2 or REM sleep (p less than 0.02). The study demonstrates that sleep modifies the changes in respiratory timing produced by resistive loading without having a major effect on ventilation or P0.1 responses. The low frequency of arousal from Stage 3/4 sleep with loading may explain why asthmatics rarely awaken from this stage with wheeze.\r"

The relative risk (estimated by relative odds) of having airway obstruction, defined as a FEV1/FVC less than or equal to 65%, was measured for different levels of nutrient and food group intakes after adjustment for age, sex, Quetelet Index, caloric intake, and cigarette smoking. Among the white respondents (never smokers or current smokers) whose recalled diet could be considered as typical of their usual diet, the relative odds of having airway obstruction was inversely related to vitamin A intake (x2 for trend = 7.2, p less than 0.01). In the analysis by food groups, the adjusted relative odds of airway obstruction for meat and poultry were 2.4 (95% confidence limits: 1.0 to 5.8) and for milk 1.6 (95% confidence limits: 1.0 to 2.5). The association of airway obstruction with lack of vitamin A or milk intake was clearer among smokers. These findings suggest that a diet poor in vitamin A increases the risk of airway obstruction, and are consistent with the previously reported association of chronic bronchitis, milk intake, and smoking.\r"

In comparison with the inhaled bolus, the exhaled bolus is more spread because of convective mixing, may have a shift in the location of the mode caused by asymmetries of filling and emptying of lung units, and contains fewer particles because of particle deposition. We hypothesized that the extent of these changes is related to lung health. To examine this, 11 patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) and 11 healthy subjects inhaled 70 cm3 boluses containing 1 micron monodisperse particles that were inspired to volumetric penetrations (Vp) of 100 to 700 cm3. As each bolus was expired, we measured spreading (volumetric width at one-half aerosol concentration peak height), modal shift, and particle deposition. Patients with CF exhaled boluses that were broader than those exhaled by normal subjects at all penetrations examined. At a Vp of 600 cm3, patients had a mean bolus half-width that was 68% greater than that of healthy subjects (p less than 0.0001), and they exhaled the bolus mode 20% earlier (p less than 0.0002). Particle deposition was increased compared with that in normal subjects at all Vp. For example, mean deposition at a Vp of 600 cm3 was 46.2 +/- 2.6% (SE) for the patients versus 25.8 +/- 1.6% for the normal subjects (p less than 0.0001). Among the patients with CF, pulmonary function parameters indicating obstruction were significantly correlated with bolus spreading and aerosol deposition: the percent predicted FEV1/FVC was inversely correlated with spreading (r = -0.88, p less than 0.0004) and deposition (r = -0.84, p less than 0.0008).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Changes in respiratory symptoms, spirometry, and airway responsiveness to histamine in childhood and adult life were analyzed. It was found that 43 of the 101 adults (43%) had current symptoms; 29 of the 43 (67%) were receiving maintenance therapy. In the first study, 83 of the 101 children (82%) showed a response on inhalation of histamine (PC10-histamine less than or equal to 16 mg/ml). The number of subjects in the second study who still had a PC10-histamine less than or equal to 16 mg/ml fell to 29, suggesting that airway responsiveness decreases from childhood to adulthood. During the second survey (in adults), 25 of the 43 (59%) subjects with current symptoms and four of the 58 (7%) without respiratory symptoms responded to histamine. Adults with current symptoms had a significantly lower %FEV1 in both childhood and adulthood than did adults without current symptoms; %FEV1 was not different in females and males or in smokers and nonsmokers in either the first or the second survey. The outcome of childhood asthma is primarily predicted by the initial degree of bronchial obstruction (p = 0.041) and airway responsiveness to histamine (p = 0.050), and does not appear to be related to sex, smoking habits, or age of onset of respiratory symptoms.\r"

  ".U": "90054637\r", 
  ".W": "We studied the effect of corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) on airway smooth muscle functions in isolated rabbit tracheal segments under isometric conditions in vitro. The addition of ovine CRF synthesized by solid-phase methods did not cause muscle contraction, but it potentiated the contractile response to electrical field stimulation (EFS) at 5 Hz in a dose-dependent fashion, the maximal increase from the baseline response being 43.9 +/- 6.1% (mean +/- SE, p less than 0.001). This effect was not influenced by propranolol, phentolamine, indomethacin, pyrilamine, or (D-Pro2,D-Trp7.9)-substance P, but was completely inhibited by alpha-helical CRF, a CRF receptor antagonist. CRF (10(-7) M) also increased the responses to EFS at all frequencies of stimulation (1 to 40 Hz), so that the stimulus frequency required to produce a half-maximal contraction (ES50) decreased from 7.7 +/- 1.0 to 3.8 +/- 0.6 Hz (p less than 0.01). In contrast, contractile response to administered acetylcholine was not affected by CRF. CRF-induced potentiation of the response to EFS (5 Hz) was further increased from 44.5 +/- 5.4 to 144.6 +/- 11.1% in the presence of physostigmine and was abolished by atropine. These results suggest that CRF prejunctionally potentiates the vagally mediated contraction of airway smooth muscle through activation of CRF receptors on the cholinergic nerve terminals, likely involving the accelerated release of acetylcholine.\r"

  ".W": "Isocapnic hyperpnea (ISH) of cold air induces bronchoconstriction in many asthmatic subjects. Although this response is well described, it is unclear whether this bronchoconstriction is related to the release of bronchoactive mediators. We examined whether pretreatment with LY171883, a competitive antagonist of leukotriene D4 activity via LTD4 receptors, reduced the bronchospastic response to cold air ISH in asthmatics using a randomized, double-blind, two-phase crossover design. In 20 subjects, 2 wk of treatment with either LY171883 600 mg twice a day or placebo did not result in a change in FEV1 (3.45 +/- 0.21 L placebo versus 3.59 +/- 0.20 L LY171883; p greater than 0.05). Nineteen subjects underwent cold-air ISH; LY171883 increased the geometric mean respiratory heat loss required to reduce the FEV1 by 20% (PD20RHE) from 1.00 kcal/min with placebo to 1.24 kcal/min with LY171883 (p less than 0.05). A similar difference was noted when responses were expressed as a function of minute ventilation. LY171883 produced greater shifts in the PD20RHE in more reactive subjects (r = 0.69, p less than 0.002). Among 11 different symptom scores recorded by 18 subjects, there was a significant decrease in daytime chest tightness with LY171883 (p less than 0.03). The increase in PD20RHE while the subjects received LY171883 is consistent with the hypothesis that LTD4 becomes available during cold-air ISH and may mediate bronchoconstriction. The small magnitude of the effect on the PD20RHE may be due to the role of other mediators in cold-air-induced bronchoconstriction or, alternatively, to an inadequate blockade of LTD4 effects.\r"

Home dampness was characterized from questionnaire reports of mold or mildew inside the home, water damage to the home, and the occurrence of water on the basement floor. Symptoms of respiratory and other illness were collected by questionnaire. Pulmonary function was measured by spirometry. Signs of home dampness were reported in a large proportion of the homes. In five of the six cities, one or more of the dampness indicators were reported in more than 50% of the homes. The association between measures of home dampness and both respiratory symptoms and other non-chest illness was both strong and consistent. Odds ratios for molds varied from 1.27 to 2.12, and for dampness from 1.23 to 2.16 after adjustment for maternal smoking, age, gender, city of residence, and parental education. The relationship between home dampness and pulmonary function was weak, with an estimated mean reduction of 1.0% in FEF25-75 associated with dampness and 1.6% with molds. We conclude that dampness in the home is common in many areas of the United States and that home dampness is a strong predictor of symptoms of respiratory and other illness symptoms among 8- to 12-yr-old children.\r"

We have compared PEF recordings made by 121 subjects selected at random from the population of a small town (Group A) and 221 subjects selected because of wheeze in the last year (Group B). Subjects were asked to record PEF every 2 h during waking hours for 7 days using a mini-Wright peak flow meter. Seven indices of PEF variability were derived for each subject and the range for each index determined. All indices showed a positively skewed distribution in the random sample. Two variability indices, standard deviation percent mean and amplitude percent mean, provided the greatest separation between subjects with both a diagnosis of asthma and wheeze in the last year and subjects with neither feature and also provided the highest intra-class correlation coefficients. We conclude that amplitude percent mean and standard deviation percent mean provide the best means of expressing PEF variability for epidemiological purposes, but that amplitude percent mean is more easily derived and appears to be the index of choice. PEF variability has a continuous distribution in the general population and no clear-cut division between asthmatic and nonasthmatic subjects can be defined.\r"

They underwent an incremental exercise test on a cycle ergometer using the same incremental protocol and exercise mode as the previous study, and were retrospectively judged to be normal. Although Wcap predicted was either not significantly different (males) or underestimated Wcap by less than 5% (females, p less than 0.05), significant differences were found in subjects at the extremes of the population ranges for height and age. The influences of age 9yr) and height (m) were found to be nonlinear and interactive, as described by the equations: Males: Wcap = 1506*Ht2.70*Age-0.46(r = 0.78) (lower limit 81% pred) Females: Wcap = 969*Ht2.80*Age-0.43(r = 0.77) (lower limit 79% pred) Wcap (kpm/min) predicted by these equations was compared to Wcap achieved by the 100 subjects who took part in the original study; no significant differences were found (paired t test, p less than 0.05). The interactive influences of age and height expressed by the equations are more plausible from a biological point of view than the linear, additive relationships previously described. The equations should be more reliable than previous equations for patients referred for exercise testing.\r"

However, during induced inflammation, fibrin deposition concomitant with cessation of exudation is seen. To judge the involvement of the fibrinolytic system in this process, concentrations of fibrinolytic factors were followed in 10 patients during treatment by quinacrine instillation and tube drainage. Plasminogen and alpha-2-antiplasmin were found in low concentrations and did not show significant changes during treatment. The plasminogen activator inhibitor PAI-1, which plays an important role in the regulation of fibrinolysis, was also studied during treatment. Before treatment the concentration of PAI-1 was 21.7 +/- 12.0 (mean +/- SD) AU/ml and it increased to 86.9 +/- 25.9 AU/ml 6 h after quinacrine instillation. D-dimer, a product of the lysis of fibrin, was found in high concentrations before treatment (62.7 +/- 25.5 micrograms/ml) and in low concentrations 6 h after treatment (12.2 +/- 7.9 micrograms/ml). Thus, it was possible to demonstrate that the fibrinolytic system is activated during chronic malignant pleural exudation and, furthermore, that the activity decreases during induced inflammation.\r"

  ".W": "In 1981 to 1982, we reported that many (19/43) asymptomatic dairy farmers, especially those with positive serum precipitins, had a lymphocytic alveolitis. We reevaluated, six and seven years later, 33 of the initial 43 farmers to verify their outcome. The restudied group included 31 men and 2 women between 24 and 67 years of age. In both studies, 24 were nonsmokers and 9 were exsmokers. Each farmer answered a questionnaire, had a physical examination, blood withdrawal for precipitin analysis, a chest roentgenogram, and pulmonary function tests (forced expiratory flows and diffusion capacity). At restudy, one subject had developed symptoms suggestive of sub-acute farmer's lung and now had inspiratory crackles; six had chronic morning cough and sputum production. Serum precipitins were positive in 10 subjects, whereas 16 had been positive at the initial study. Precipitins reverted from positive to negative in eight subjects and from negative to positive in six. Chest roentgenograms were normal in 23 subjects, while discrete interstitial abnormalities were noted in nine. One subject had significant pulmonary infiltrates. Results of current pulmonary function tests were (% predicted, mean +/- SEM) DL(CO) 114.8 +/- 3.0, FEV1 108.1 +/- 2.4, FVC 105.4 +/- 1.1. No correlations were found between these data and the lymphocytes or mast cells found in the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) at the initial study of 1981 and 1982. We conclude that bronchoalveolar lavage cell counts of asymptomatic farmers have no long-term clinical significance.\r"

  ".U": "90054648\r", 
  ".W": "We have investigated the possible role of pulmonary surfactant in mediating a deficiency in alveolar macrophages (AM) from infant animals to produce chemiluminescent (CL) responses elicited by phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) or opsonized zymosan (Op-Zym). Freshly harvested AM from rabbits 7 to 28 days of age produced much reduced PMA-elicited CL responses compared to 5- to 6-month-old rabbits. Initially we observed that AM from both infant and adult rabbits exhibited increasing PMA- or Op-Zym-elicited CL responses in a time-dependent manner when they were incubated in RPMI 1640 medium without serum for more than 3 h. In addition, AM from infant rabbits acquired the capacity to become primed with macrophage activation factor (MAF) containing supernatants or fetal bovine serum (FBS) during an 18-h incubation period that was basically equivalent to that of AM from adult rabbits. Our studies reveal that natural and artificial surfactant inhibited \"spontaneous\" priming as well as priming of AM induced by MAF-containing supernatant or FBS for producing PMA- or OP-Zym-elicited CL responses from both normal infant and adult animals. In addition, these surfactant preparations also suppressed the response of AM from adult BCG-sensitized rabbits during the course of an 18-h incubation period. It is especially noteworthy that AM from infant rabbits appeared to be more susceptible to the inhibitory activity of surfactant than AM from adult animals. Our data indicate that freshly harvested AM from infant rabbits are under greater suppression than AM from adult rabbits in terms of their capacities to produce oxidative responses.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

We examined several aspects of differentiated adult human type II cells cultured on either bovine corneal endothelial cell extracellular matrix (BCECM) or matrix derived from the Englebreth-Holm-Swarm tumor (EHS). Compared to cells cultured on BCECM, adult human type II cells grown on EHS assumed a more cuboidal shape, had a more defined apical-basal polarity, and appeared to contain a greater number of lamellar bodies and neutral lipid inclusions. These cells also incorporated a greater percentage of [14C]acetate into saturated phosphatidylcholine (SPC) than did their counterparts grown on BCECM. In contrast, the relative incorporation of [14C]acetate into phosphatidylglycerol (PG) was lower in cells grown on EHS than cells cultured on BCECM. The histochemical stain for alkaline phosphatase was useful in identification of human type II cells. Alkaline phosphatase expression was elevated in cells cultured on EHS compared to those cultured on BCECM. These results suggest that maintenance of a differentiated morphology, lipid synthesis, and expression of alkaline phosphatase activity by primary cultures of adult human type II cells are also influenced by cell-matrix interactions. All markers of differentiated function of type II cells except synthesis of PG are better maintained on EHS than on BCECM. Under the conditions of these experiments, synthesis of SPC and PG appears to be independently regulated.\r"

Analysis of the effects of the beta-adrenoceptor antagonists on I-CYP binding demonstrated that betaxolol (20 nM, beta 1-selective) had no significant effect on specific grain density in either nonasthmatic or asthmatic human bronchus, whereas ICI-118551 (20 nM, beta 2-selective) inhibited I-CYP binding by 85 +/- 9% and 89 +/- 3%, respectively. Thus, homogeneous populations of beta 2-adrenoceptors existed in bronchi from both sources. Large populations of beta-adrenoceptors were localized to the bronchial epithelium, submucosal glands, and airway smooth muscle. Asthmatic bronchial tissue featured epithelial damage with exfoliated cells associated with luminal mucus plugs. A thickened basement membrane and airway smooth muscle hyperplasia were also evident. High levels of specific I-CYP binding were also detected over asthmatic bronchial smooth muscle, as assessed by autoradiography and quantitation of specific grain densities. Isoproterenol and fenoterol were 10- and 13-fold less potent, respectively, in bronchi from asthmatic lung than in those from nonasthmatic lung. However, this attenuated responsiveness to beta-adrenoceptor agonists was not caused by reduced beta-adrenoceptor density in asthmatic airways. A defect may exist in the coupling between beta-adrenoceptors and postreceptor mechanisms in severely asthmatic lung.\r"

Whereas the geometric mean histamine concentration required to produce a 15% fall in FEV1 in the warm humid tests was 22.7 mg/ml, it was 11.9 mg/ml in the cold dry test (p less than 0.01).

After a 24-h period of occlusion of a rabbit pulmonary artery followed by a 2-h period of reperfusion, the lungs were removed from the animal and perfused with a 0.5 g% Ringer's-albumin solution. An increase in lung weight was observed within 60 min compared with control lungs (i.e., lungs subjected to pulmonary arterial occlusion but not reperfusion) (p less than 0.05). Shorter periods of occlusion (6 or 12 h) did not result in edema, which suggests that a period of ischemia was required for the reperfusion-induced pulmonary edema. The extravascular lung water content also increased in the contralateral lung (i.e., the lung not subjected to pulmonary arterial occlusion and reperfusion). The capillary filtration coefficient increased in reperfused lungs compared with controls (p less than 0.05), indicating an increase in lung vascular permeability following reperfusion. Infusion of allopurinol (a xanthine oxidase inhibitor) and superoxide dismutase during the reperfusion period prevented the increases in lung weight and vascular permeability; infusion of catalase was ineffective. We conclude that pulmonary reperfusion following pulmonary artery occlusion increases pulmonary vascular permeability, which is mediated by the generation of oxidants.\r"

The purified lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from endotoxin has been employed to investigate structure-activity relationships for various biologic effects. The current study was undertaken to examine the relationship between LPS structure and its ability to cause respiratory toxicity in guinea pigs after inhalation exposure. Animals were exposed to atmospheres containing 0.076 to 2.1 micrograms/m3 Salmonella minnesota LPS (S. minn. LPS), LPS from the mutant S. minn. Re595, S. minn. Re595 lipid A, and monophosphoryl S. minn. Re595 lipid A (S. minn. Re595 MPL). Each of the LPS aerosols caused increased breathing frequency (f), decreased tidal volume (VT), and airflow disturbance when measured 18 h after the 6-h inhalation exposure. The LPS preparations had equivalent toxicity, whereas the lipid A aerosol had slightly reduced toxicity. The MPL preparation did not produce this respiratory toxicity response. The results indicated that absence of the terminal phosphate group from the reducing end of the lipid A disaccharide destroyed its ability to cause the respiratory effect. These results initiate structure-activity studies of defined LPS in the lung and indicate the possibility of chemically treating endotoxins to remove adverse pulmonary effects.\r"

Myotonia of inspiratory muscles was diagnosed on the grounds of marked prolongation of transdiaphragmatic pressure (Pdi) decay during sniffs. In view of the recognized sensory role of inspiratory muscles in dyspnea, it was hypothesized that antimyotonic therapy might relieve dyspnea in this patient. Procainamide therapy induced a decrease in half relaxation time of Pdi during sniffs and yielded a striking clinical improvement with cessation of tachypnea and dyspnea. Later, this beneficial effect was maintained by tocainide after procainamide was stopped because of a lupus syndrome. We conclude that myotonia of respiratory muscles can cause severe dyspnea that can be improved by antimyotonic therapy.\r"

  ".W": "Both allogeneic immunocompetent CD4+ lymphocytes and activated macrophages of mice can induce neovascularization when inoculated intradermally into host animals. Because sarcoidosis is associated with an increase in both activated macrophages and CD4+ effector lymphocytes in the lung, we carried out experiments in which cells obtained by bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) of patients with pulmonary sarcoidosis were tested in a murine intradermal angiogenesis assay. BAL cells from patients with pulmonary sarcoidosis induced a significantly greater degree of angiogenesis than those from normal volunteers or from patients with other lung diseases. Moreover, the degree of angiogenesis induced by BAL cells from patients with sarcoidosis correlated positively with the severity of the disease. When BAL cells were separated into macrophage and lymphocyte subpopulations by flow cytometric techniques, the observed angiogenic activity was restricted primarily or exclusively to macrophages; lymphocytes were unable to induce angiogenesis in this xenogeneic assay system. These experiments suggest that pulmonary macrophages may play a role in the pathogenesis of sarcoidosis by inducing changes in the pulmonary microvasculature. Moreover, we hypothesize that these vascular changes may be induced not only in the lung but also in other organ systems such as skin, muscle, and eye in which microangiopathies are associated with sarcoid disease.\r"

Because bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) cells from patients with pulmonary sarcoidosis have an enhanced capacity to induce neovascularization, the BAL fluids from these patients were assessed for their effect on human and murine endothelial cells and fibroblasts obtained from a variety of tissue sources. A recently developed computer-assisted image analysis system was used to determine the extent and pattern of cell migration in a microwell screening assay. Data were obtained for BAL fluids from 10 patients with pulmonary sarcoidosis and from five normal volunteers. BAL supernatants from patients with active sarcoidosis showed an enhanced (2- to 8-fold) capacity to induce chemokinesis of both endothelial cells and fibroblasts, as measured by increased area of migration and polarized cell movement. There was a marked heterogeneity in the motility of cells from different organ origins, but enhanced cell movement was observed with both endothelial cells and fibroblasts. In contrast, BAL fluids from normal and sarcoid patients were similar in their effect on muscle cells and urothelial cells, whereas pericytes, which responded to BAL fluids from normal subjects or patients with nongranulomatous pulmonary disease, were inhibited by BAL fluids from patients with pulmonary sarcoidosis. The induction of endothelial cell movement in vitro induced by individual supernatants generally correlated with the capacity of BAL cells from these patients to induce angiogenesis in vivo.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In contrast, transcript levels were elevated in lobar arteries from hypertensive calves. Histologically, medial thickening and hypertrophy were apparent in distal lobar arteries from pulmonary hypertensive calves, but at this level no structural changes were observed in veins. These results indicate that the synthetic response to hypoxic pulmonary hypertension is complex, with different alterations in the expression of extracellular matrix components in the pulmonary arterial and venous circulations.\r"

We find that lung-colonizing murine melanoma cells produce an enzymatic activity that degrades elastin. In addition, the elastin fragments liberated by enzymatic digestion of insoluble elastin stimulate tumor cell chemotaxis. Chemotactic activity is associated with other forms of soluble elastin, including alpha-elastin and tropoelastin. Val-Gly-Val-Ala-Pro-Gly, a synthetic peptide that is a repeat sequence in the elastin molecule, also displayed tumor cell chemotactic activity. The ability to degrade elastin and to migrate in response to soluble elastin peptides is not a property of all tumor cells, but it is most commonly found associated with metastatic tumor cells that colonize pulmonary tissue. We postulate that the ability to migrate in response to elastin fragments may facilitate tumor cell invasion of elastin-rich pulmonary tissue.\r"

The present studies address whether there is an inherent loss in the ability of tetraploid cells to respond to proliferative stimuli by examining whether these cells initiate DNA replication after balloon catheter-induced vascular injury. Left carotid arteries of 5- to 7-month-old spontaneously hypertensive rats were subjected to balloon injury, and the animals were perfused intravenously with [3H]thymidine for 32 h. The animals were killed, and smooth muscle cells were isolated from carotid medial preparation by enzymatic digestion. Cells were processed for simultaneous autoradiographic analysis of [3H]thymidine incorporation and fluorometric analysis of cellular DNA content as a means of simultaneously assessing both the ploidy level of a cell and whether or not it had initiated DNA replication in response to balloon injury. Results demonstrated the presence of [3H]thymidine-labeled cells with DNA contents that were greater than 4C but less than 8C (p less than 0.01), indicating that they are cycling tetraploid cells. These data demonstrate that tetraploid smooth muscle cells in vivo are capable of initiating DNA synthesis in response to balloon injury. Results indicate that there is not an inherent loss in the capacity of tetraploid cells to respond to a proliferative stimulus, although it remains to be determined whether the polyploid cells that initiate DNA replication after balloon injury actually go on to divide.\r"

Bursts of intimal, medial, and adventitial cell proliferation different in their timing and extent contribute to lung vascular wall remodelling in these injuries. The Ll of the microvascular fibroblast increased most on Day 4 of hyperoxia (20-fold); it persisted above the normal rate throughout hyperoxia and was high at the start of weaning (greater than 1- less than 2-fold).

Isolated blood-perfused lungs of CH rats (2 to 3 wk in 10% O2) were compared with those of C rats kept in air. High inflation (alveolar) pressure (Palv) caused a rise in pulmonary artery pressure (Ppa) close to delta Palv in both groups; in CH rats, Ppa continued to rise, whereas it adapted to a lower level in C rats. Pressure-flow (P/Q) lines were measured at high and low Palv, all in Zone 2 state. In normoxia, high Palv caused a parallel shift in the P/Q line close to delta Palv in both C and CH rats. However, during hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction (HPV), high Palv caused a shift in the P/Q line less than delta Palv in C rats and greater than delta Palv in CH rats. Similar differences between C and CH rats were seen during constriction caused by almitrine, a drug that simulates HPV. Thus, these stimuli affect vessels that are functionally \"extra-alveolar\" in C rats but functionally \"alveolar\" in CH rats. We consider whether vasoconstriction by hypoxia and almitrine moves peripherally to the newly muscularized alveolar arterioles that are found in CH rats. Reactivity of lung vessels to bradykinin, angiotensin-1, and platelet-activating factor was greater in CH than in C rats, possibly also associated with muscularization of arterioles in the former.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

A \"specific\" cause for the ascites could not be identified in any of the 14 patients. The ascites was an exudate in every patient (protein content greater than 3.5 gm/dl). Twelve patients (86%) obtained significant relief of the discomfort and all effects of the ascites, and objective clinical improvement persisted for at least six months. Nine patients (75%) survived one year and six (50%) survived three or more years. Three patients (21%) had recurrence of ascites because of shunt malfunction; however, two of them were successfully treated with placement of a second shunt. Eight (57%) patients have died since the onset of their ascites (x 14.1 months +/- 3.5 SEM); one death was attributable to PVS placement, while the other seven deaths were due to complications of their ESRD.

After the establishment of the responding colonoscopist's training, experience, and other background data, impressions of fluoroscopy's role in many issues were obtained using a graded response system. Concluding the two-page survey were open-ended questions addressing the respondent's indications, contraindications, and rationale for using or not using fluoroscopy. Six hundred thirty-one colonoscopists responded. Seventy-five per cent never use fluoroscopy; the most frequently cited reasons were lack of need and inaccessibility of fluoroscopy. For many colonoscopists, fluoroscopy is unavailable (22%) or available outside of the usual endoscopy setting (44%). Fluoroscopy is used by 25 per cent of colonoscopists. Almost three quarters of this group have the capability of performing fluoroscopy in their colonoscopy unit. The indications for fluoroscopy varied with the frequency of its use; frequent users employ fluoroscopy to treat loops, to confirm cecal intubation, and to locate the instrument tip precisely. Infrequent users employ fluoroscopy to apply the sigmoid straightening overtube or because of prior failed colonoscopy. Impressions regarding the impact of fluoroscopy on learning, completing, and safeguarding colonoscopy were obtained. Most colonoscopists are satisfied without using fluoroscopy, although 65 per cent of nonusers believe it would improve colonoscopy performance if it were used. Ninety-two per cent of frequent users of fluoroscopy reported that they would feel significantly impaired without having the capability to perform fluoroscopy.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

PTCA involves the use of a larger sheath and catheter assembly than does cardiac catheterization, potentially increasing the risk of injury to the peripheral vessels used for access. Over an 18-month period, 295 angioplasty procedures resulted in six major vascular injuries (2%). The peripheral vascular complications that were recognized early included thrombosis of the common or superficial femoral artery in two patients and laceration of the iliac artery in two additional cases. Late complications included one superficial femoral artery aneurysm and one common iliac vein thrombosis. All patients required emergency operation at the time of recognition of their vascular complication, and five of six required multiple operative procedures. At operation, all but one patient had severe peripheral arterial disease. There was one death, three amputations, and multiple major complications. Although persistent dysrhythmias were common, major cardiac complications were unusual. These patients had prolonged hospital stays and high hospital costs. Although the incidence of arterial complications with PTCA is low, the consequences are potentially disastrous when they occur. Greater attention to basic evaluation for arterial disease is strongly recommended before elective PTCA, and informed consent about possible extremity complications is mandatory. These untoward results, with their prolonged stays and high costs, must be considered when evaluating the results of \"nonoperative\" treatment of coronary artery disease.\r"

  ".W": "STUDY OBJECTIVE: To determine the effect of supplemental oxygen on Cheyne-Stokes respiration, nocturnal oxygen saturation (SaO2), and sleep in male patients with severe, stable congestive heart failure. DESIGN: Randomized, single-blind, placebo-controlled crossover study. SETTING: Patients referred from outpatient cardiology clinics of two teaching hospitals. PATIENTS: Sequential sample of nine outpatients with severe, stable congestive heart failure. INTERVENTIONS: For each patient, sleep studies (after an adaptation night) from two consecutive randomized nights were compared; one study was done while the patient breathed compressed air and the other while the patient breathed oxygen (O2). Compressed air and oxygen were both administered through nasal cannulae at 2 to 3 L/min. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Cheyne-Stokes respiration, defined as periodic breathing with apnea or hypopnea, was found in all patients. Low-flow oxygen significantly reduced the duration of Cheyne-Stokes respiration (50.7% +/- 12.0% to 24.2% +/- 5.4% total sleep time), mainly during stage 1 NREM (non-rapid eye movement) sleep (21.3% +/- 7.1% to 6.7% +/- 2.3% total sleep time) with no significant change during stage 2 sleep, slow-wave sleep, or REM (rapid eye movement) sleep. Although patients had normal SaO2 (96.0% +/- 1.7%) while awake, severe sleep hypoxemia was common; breathing oxygen reduced the amount of time that SaO2 was less than 90% from 22.3% +/- 8.0% to 2.41% +/- 1.93% of total sleep time. Sleep, disrupted to a variable extent in all patients, improved with oxygen therapy: There was an increase in total sleep time from 275.3 min +/- 36.6 to 324.6 min +/- 23.3; a reduction in the proportion of stage 1 sleep (27.6% +/- 5.8% total sleep time to 15.2% +/- 2.6% total sleep time); and a reduction in the number of arousals (30.4/h +/- 8.0 to 13.8/h +/- 1.9). The apnea-hypopnea index was reduced from 30.0 +/- 4.7 to 18.9 +/- 2.4 with oxygen breathing. CONCLUSION: In severe, stable congestive heart failure, nocturnal oxygen therapy reduces Cheyne-Stokes respiration, corrects hypoxemia, and consolidates sleep by reducing arousals caused by the hyperpneic phase of Cheyne-Stokes respiration. Correction of nocturnal hypoxemia and sleep disruption may improve the clinical status of these patients.\r"

SETTING: A geographically defined population of older white adults. PARTICIPANTS: Men (836) and women (1112) ages 50 to 79. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Waist-hip circumference ratio and body mass index (weight in kg/height in m2) were measured in participants wearing light clothing without shoes. Past and current cigarette smoking habits were ascertained by a standard self-administered questionnaire. Cigarette smokers had higher waist-hip ratios than non-smokers. We observed a dose-response relation of increasing waist-hip ratio with increasing number of cigarettes smoked. Although smokers were leaner than nonsmokers, the increased waist-hip ratio in smokers was independent of body mass index and was consistent within body-mass index tertiles. The associations, seen in both sexes, were stronger in women. CONCLUSIONS: Cigarette smokers have more central obesity than nonsmokers. These results suggest that body fat distribution can be modified by behavioral factors such as smoking.\r"

DESIGN: Retrospective incidence cohort study. SETTING: Population-based in Rochester, Minnesota. PATIENTS: Residents of Rochester, Minnesota, with diabetes initially diagnosed between 1945 and 1979 who had follow-up to 1984 for clinically defined chronic renal failure. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Among 1832 persons with non-insulin-dependent diabetes who were initially free of chronic renal failure, 25 developed chronic renal failure (incidence, 133 per 100,000 person-years: CI, 86 to 196). The subsequent incidence of chronic renal failure among 136 insulin-dependent diabetic Rochester residents, three of whom developed chronic renal failure, was 170 per 100,000 person-years (CI, 35 to 497). After adjusting for potential confounding factors, we found that the risk for chronic renal failure associated with the presence of persistent proteinuria at the time of the diagnosis of non-insulin-dependent diabetes was increased 12-fold (hazard ratio, 12.1; CI, 4.3 to 34.0). When persistent proteinuria developed after the diagnosis of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, the cumulative risk for chronic renal failure 10 years after the diagnosis of persistent proteinuria was 11%. CONCLUSIONS: These population-based data suggest that most cases of chronic renal failure in diabetes occur in persons with non-insulin-dependent diabetes. These data also identify the increased risk for chronic renal failure among persons with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus who have persistent proteinuria present at or developing after the diagnosis of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, such data may be useful for directing interventions to prevent or delay the development of chronic renal failure.\r"

  ".W": "Cystic fibrosis is the commonest autosomal recessive genetic disorder among northern Europeans and their descendants. Recently, investigators have mapped the gene for cystic fibrosis to chromosome 7. We report the results of DNA linkage analysis in a consanguineous family with mild cystic fibrosis. The probes used in this study were pmet D. pmet H, XV-2c, KM.19, and pJ3.11. Linkage to the identified cystic fibrosis locus of 7q22 was established with a peak logarithm of the odds (lod) score of 3.00 at a recombination fraction theta =0.00 using the tightly linked marker KM.19. In addition, we found the D haplotype, which is not commonly associated with cystic fibrosis, to be segregating in this family. The D haplotype is composed of the 1.4-kb allele detectable by XV-2c and the 6.6-kb allele detectable by KM.19. The three patients with cystic fibrosis who had consanguineous parents were homozygous DD, were among the least severely affected, and had no pancreatic insufficiency. The five patients with unrelated parents were heterozygous for the D haplotype and the commoner B haplotype, except one patient who was homozygous DD. All affected persons with pancreatic insufficiency had the DB genotype. These DNA linkage studies provide additional evidence for the existence of a cystic fibrosis allele that is associated with mild disease.\r"

DESIGN: Survey of a family for two diseases. SETTING: Evaluation of patients at a clinical research center. PATIENTS: Nineteen family members with MEN 2a. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: In this family cutaneous lichen amyloidosis presented as multiple infiltrated papules overlying a well-demarcated plaque in the scapular area of the back (right or left). Immunohistochemical studies showed amyloid that stained for keratin but not calcitonin. Three family members had the characteristic skin lesion and also carried the gene for MEN 2a; two additional members carried the gene for MEN 2a, but did not manifest the observable skin changes associated with lichen amyloidosis. CONCLUSIONS: From the findings in this kindred and in another recently reported but unrelated family with an identical type of pruritic skin rash and MEN 2a, several conclusions can be drawn. First, the syndrome of cutaneous amyloidosis and MEN 2a is a clearly defined autosomal dominant hereditary syndrome. Second, the dermal amyloid appears to be caused by deposition of keratin-like peptides rather than by calcitonin-like peptides. Third, known families with hereditary lichen amyloidosis should be screened to determine the true frequency of this syndrome.\r"

DESIGN: A cross-sectional study of serum levels of PLP using a newly developed radioimmunoassay. SETTING: A university-affiliated Veterans Administration hospital in San Francisco, California, a University hospital in Hong Kong, and a private hospital in Danville, Pennsylvania. PATIENTS: Patients with hypercalcemia (calcium greater than 2.65 mmol/L) and a diagnosis of malignancy were studied. Control groups included normocalcemic patients with malignancy, patients with hyperparathyroidism, and normal subjects. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Serum immunoreactive PLP (iPLP) levels in normal subjects were less than 2.5 pmol eq/L (10 pg/mL), and 68% of subjects had undetectable levels. The serum concentration of iPLP was normal in 15 of 16 hypercalcemic patients with hyperparathyroidism. Serum iPLP was increased (greater than 2.5 pmol eq/L) in 36 of 65 (55%) patients with malignancy-associated hypercalcemia, with a mean value of 6.1 +/- 0.9 pmol eq/L (24 pg/mL). In a subgroup of patients with solid tumors serum iPLP was increased in 30 (71%) of 42 hypercalcemic patients, with a mean value of 6.5 +/- 0.9 pmol eq/L. Serum iPLP was elevated in only 3 of 23 normocalcemic patients with cancer. In patients with solid malignancies (n = 59), levels of iPLP were positively correlated with the total serum calcium (r = 0.43, P less than 0.01). CONCLUSION: The data indicate a relation between the serum concentration of iPLP and the presence of hypercalcemia in solid malignancies. The results support a role for PLP as a humoral mediator of hypercalcemia in most patients with solid tumors. Measurement of iPLP should be useful in the differential diagnosis of hypercalcemia.\r"

  ".W": "STUDY OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the clinical and biochemical features of patients with TSH (thyroid-stimulating hormone, thyrotropin)-secreting pituitary tumors; to measure the biologic activity in vitro of circulating TSH from selected patients before and after pituitary surgery. DESIGN: Case series. SETTING: Patients in an endocrinology unit. PATIENTS: Nine patients with TSH-secreting pituitary tumors. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: All patients had hyperthyroidism, elevated free thyroxine and triiodothyronine levels, and detected levels of TSH. The free alpha subunit, a tumor marker for neoplasms of gonadotropic or thyrotropic cell origin, was elevated in all nine patients. Seven of the nine patients had been treated with thionamides, radioactive iodine, or thyroidectomy for presumed primary hyperthyroidism. The delay from the initial treatment of hyperthyroidism to the correct diagnosis of a pituitary neoplasm was 6.2 +/- 4.8 (mean +/- SD) years. Two of the seven patients with macroadenomas died in the perioperative period (one at NIH, one at a referring hospital). Of the remaining five patients with macroadenomas, four have residual tumor and inappropriate TSH secretion, despite surgery and radiation therapy, at follow-up from 3.5 to 6 years. In contrast, the two patients with microadenomas are clinically cured 2.5 and 4 years after transsphenoidal adenomectomy. The biologic to immunologic (B/I) ratio of serum TSH, determined preoperatively in five patients with TSH-secreting tumors, was elevated compared with euthyroid subjects. In three patients the B/I ratio of serum TSH was also measured after pituitary surgery; in two the elevated B/I ratio returned to normal after successful pituitary adenomectomy, while in the third this ratio remained elevated after incomplete adenoma resection. CONCLUSIONS: With the routine availability of ultrasensitive TSH assays and their increasing use to confirm thyrotoxicosis from all causes, we expect that TSH-secreting pituitary tumors will be diagnosed earlier, before inappropriate antithyroid therapy, permitting an improved outcome.\r"

The Holter tapes were coded, scanned in a blinded manner, and mixed with the tapes of 42 normal volunteers and 119 patients with either stable or unstable angina. SETTING: A 28-day inpatient, substance abuse treatment program followed by an outpatient treatment program. PATIENTS: Twenty-one consecutive male chronic cocaine users. MAIN RESULTS: Eight of the 21 patients with cocaine addiction had frequent episodes of ST elevation during Holter monitoring; these episodes occurred almost exclusively during the first 2 weeks of withdrawal. None of the volunteers and patients with stable angina and only 4% of the patients with unstable angina had episodes of ST elevation during Holter monitoring (cocaine users compared with volunteers, P = 0.0004). Of the 20 cocaine patients who had exercise treadmill testing, only 1 had a positive test for ischemia. CONCLUSIONS: Cocaine users frequently develop silent myocardial ischemia manifesting as episodes of ST elevation during the first weeks of withdrawal. The underlying mechanisms for these changes remain unknown, but our observations support the hypothesis that coronary vasospasm plays an important role in cocaine-related ischemic syndromes.\r"

Nine had diaphragmatic dysfunction on the same side as the internal mammary artery graft side (7 bilateral and 2 unilateral) as determined by fluoroscopy during phrenic nerve stimulation. Although topical cardiac hypothermia has been the prevailing mechanism for diaphragmatic dysfunction due to phrenic nerve injury after open-heart surgery, dissection of the internal mammary artery with electrocautery, traction, or vascular compromise to the phrenic nerve, or a combination, could be additional factors. Rocking bed ventilation was instituted to facilitate passive diaphragmatic movement and airway decannulation and was continued at home until the phrenic nerve or nerves recovered. These patients were followed up clinically and with serial measurements of vital capacity, respiratory muscle strength, phrenic nerve latency, and fluoroscopy to determine recovery rate. Phrenic nerve recovery occurred from 4 to 27 months after surgery. This recovery was heralded by the patients' ability to assume the supine position without dyspnea when use of the rocking bed was discontinued. Unilateral diaphragmatic recovery was sufficient for the restoration of symptom-free supine posture.\r"

DESIGN: A mailed survey to all program directors in the United States. RESPONDENTS: Program directors or their designees from 389 of 431 (90%) internal medicine residency programs. RESULTS: For several procedures, 40% more respondents said all residents should master the procedure than said all their residents do master the procedure. Some procedures commonly done in practice were perceived as mastered by all residents in fewer than half of the programs. There were few differences in procedures learned by size or type of program. A fellowship program did affect exposure to some procedures in the field covered by the program. Median recommendations of training needed to master each procedure were similar to those of practicing internists for most procedures. CONCLUSIONS: Current residency training does not assure competency in all of the procedures the general internist does in practice. Program directors should examine which skills are adequately taught, test competence, and ways to improve residents' skills. Practicing general internists should have access to supervised training in procedural skills.\r"

The Guide focuses on the clinical practitioner and strongly advocates integrating preventive activities into clinical practice. It also shows how required interventions can be done by the physician normally responsible for ongoing care. Case-finding is emphasized as a viable and desirable strategy in early detection of disease. The report also acknowledges behavioral and lifestyle components of risk factors for disease and the physician's opportunities to promote change in patients' risky behavior. We discuss the implications of including patient education and counseling in the physician's clinical armamentarium, highlighting changes in educational and health care delivery systems that can make such interventions work in preventive programs. The soundness of a best-evidence synthesis method to formulate recommendations and the use of a priori scientific rules to determine the effectiveness of many current and proposed preventive activities are hallmarks of the task force's approach to integrating science and clinical practice.\r"

The author has drawn on three decades of ophthalmic practice. When blindness, for example, is threatened, our \"normal\" responses change, and what we judge as normal should also. Ways of evaluating and treating patient or parent responses are suggested, along with guidelines for using consultants and others. This may play a role in malpractice suits.\r"

With all concentrations, pupil size was maximal at 60 minutes, and there was no significant difference between the groups in mean pupillary diameter. Inhibition of the pupillary responses to light and loss of accommodation were directly related to the concentration of tropicamide.

Patients who have been alerted to this condition may notice distortion on the Amsler grid and report within days of the onset of symptoms. Unfortunately most patients either do not notice the early changes in central vision or incorrectly attribute these symptoms to the development of cataracts and defer proper retinal evaluation for several months. We reviewed our records to determine the natural history of those SRNVMs which on initial IVFA either originated or extended into the foveal portion of the macula. Our results clearly indicate that treatment must be undertaken early in the course of this disease to maintain useful visual function for as long as possible.\r"

To explore further this link between tinnitus and depression, and to investigate the efficacy of treating depression in the treatment of tinnitus, a single-blind, placebo-washout, nonrandomized pilot study of the tricyclic antidepressant nortriptyline (hydrochloride) was undertaken in disabled tinnitus patients who also met diagnostic criteria for major depression. Nineteen patients began the study, two responded to placebo, and two dropped out prior to completion. Fourteen considered their tinnitus improved, and 12 chose to continue taking nortriptyline after the study. Depression severity decreased, on the average, by 65% (p less than .0001). Tinnitus loudness measured by audiometric matching decreased by a mean of 10 dB or 50% (p less than .02). Self-reports of tinnitus loudness and severity, somatic and psychologic symptoms, and psychosocial dysfunction all showed significant improvement with treatment. These results suggest that what initially appears to be an irreversible otologic disability in these patients may be in large part a reversible psychiatric disability.\r"

Seven patients underwent surgical extirpation or section of the vestibular nerve, and seven patients underwent labyrinthectomy without vestibular nerve section. The vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) and postural control were evaluated preoperatively and monitored for up to 4 years postoperatively with use of pseudorandom rotation (combined sinusoidal frequencies from 0.009 to 1.5 Hz) and moving platform posturography. Immediately following surgery all patients showed minimal reductions in the VOR gain constant, but marked reduction in the time constant, and marked increase in slow eye velocity bias. Bias returned to normal values within about 10 days, but time constants never returned to normal values. Results of standard Romberg tests in these patients were normal throughout the preoperative and postoperative periods. However, all patients showed marked postural control abnormalities in tests of the ability to maintain balance in unusual sensory environments in the immediate postoperative period. Seventy-five percent of the patients eventually recovered normal postural control. Postural control returned to near baseline performance with a time course similar to that of the VOR bias. However, postural control also continued to improve after the recovery of VOR bias was complete.\r"

Excellent results (decannulation and good voice) were achieved in eight patients with a follow-up of 9 months to 6 years. Persistent granulation tissue and some degree of fibrosis were the most common complications (eight of 12 patients). Two patients died of medical complications. A high success rate with this endoscopic technique justifies this approach as our initial therapy, with open surgical techniques reserved for failure.\r"

This tumor may be discovered incidentally on radiographs or may enlarge to produce symptoms and, rarely, complications referable to its location near the orbit and anterior cranial vault. A series of 22 cases of frontal sinus osteoma treated at the UCLA Center for the Health Sciences is reviewed. The presenting symptoms of this tumor, patient examination, radiographic evaluation, diagnosis, and indications for surgical and nonsurgical management are discussed. Various surgical approaches are reviewed, with emphasis on the advantages and disadvantages of each technique. Issues at surgery include the location of the surgical incision, technique of sinus entry, tumor removal, status of the posterior sinus table, patency of the nasofrontal duct, sinus obliteration, and avoidance of cosmetic deformity. Patient outcomes are assessed and recommendations given based on our findings and experience.\r"

However, surgical widening of a sinus ostium is contrary to common precepts. A study therefore was performed to reevaluate the effects of antrostomies and of intrasinus mucosal removal. Widening of the natural ostium, a separate antrostomy at some distance from the ostium, or radical mucosal removal was performed on 30 rabbits. Fifteen sinuses were used as controls. After 6 to 8 weeks the status of the sinus mucosa and mucociliary clearance was studied. The study confirmed that mucociliary clearance continued toward the natural ostium following inferior antrostomy. Following widening of the natural ostium, mucociliary clearance through the ostium redeveloped in 11 of 18 sinuses but was typically imperfect. There were no cases of ostial closure; however, the incidence of infection was significantly higher in all three experimental groups than in the control group.\r"

In the neurotization group, the superior laryngeal nerve (SLN) motor branch-cricothyroid muscle pedicle was used to reinnervate the posterior cricoarytenoid muscle. In the direct nerve anastomosis group, the SLN was anastomosed to the abductor branch of the recurrent laryngeal nerve (RLN), and the ansa hypoglossi (AH) to the adductor branch of the RLN. A third group of animals (control) had the right RLN sectioned without any anastomosis. About 5 to 6 months postoperatively the animals were killed painlessly and evaluated. The neurotization group revealed vocal fold mobilization on the right side to have an average of about half of the mobility of the left, normal side. After the RLN and SLN on the left were severed as well as the AH bilaterally, the vocal cord mobility was reduced to about one fourth. The direct nerve anastomosis group showed about fourfold less vocal cord mobility than the neurotization group. After the SLN, RLN, and AH were severed bilaterally, the control group showed no vocal cord mobility. The neurotization technique has been selected for further experimentation in human adults.\r"

Ferrets are small, hardy animals that are inexpensive and easy to house, handle, and anesthetize. They are readily available from breeders in a uniform size, age, and sex. Their airway is disproportionately large for their body size, making them particularly well suited for the study of acquired subglottic stenosis and subsequent surgical therapy.\r"

The Parkinsonian brains had over 50% fewer dopaminergic neurons within the midbrain than age-matched normal brains. The cell loss occurred within the combined substantia nigra (dopaminergic nucleus A9) and retrorubral (dopaminergic nucleus A8) areas (greater than 61%) and the ventral tegmental area (dopaminergic nucleus A10) (greater than 42%). The cell loss was greatest within the ventral portion of the substantia nigra zona compacta. The specific pattern of cell loss is very similar to the pattern of cells that project to the striatum (as opposed to cortical and limbic sites) in animal neuroanatomical tracing experiments. These data suggest that Parkinson's disease preferentially destroys midbrain dopaminergic neurons in nuclei A8, A9, and A10, which project to the striatum.\r"

Recent studies have revealed an association between tropical spastic paraparesis and human T-cell lymphotropic virus type I (HTLV-I) infection. We report the results of a detailed morphological and immunocytochemical study of a patient with tropical spastic paraparesis. Lesions were restricted to the spinal cord and optic nerve, where demyelination, inflammation, and fiber loss were common features. Lymphocytes were seen closely applied to nerve fibers within which were changes resembling those seen in myelinated central nervous system cultures exposed to cytokines. Immunocytochemically, HTLV-I p19 core protein and a predominance of CD8+ (suppressor/cytotoxic) T cells and expression of class I major histocompatibility antigen were demonstrated in spinal cord lesions. It is postulated that cytotoxic T cells, either directly or via cytokines, induce lysis of the myelin sheath and subsequently the axon, resulting in a mixed picture of demyelination and axonal loss with secondary tractal degeneration. Despite this destruction, extensive remyelination was evident within affected areas of spinal cord.\r"

The density of [3H]TBZOH binding sites in the caudate nucleus of control subjects decreased significantly with age, suggesting an age-dependent reduction in striatal dopamine innervation. In contrast, an increase with the age at time of death was observed in patients with Parkinson's disease, although the density of [3H]TBZOH binding sites was subnormal. Mean values represented 26.5% and 12.7% of control values in the caudate nucleus and in the putamen, respectively. The binding of [3H]TBZOH in the caudate nucleus decreased exponentially with the duration of Parkinson's disease. The rate of [3H]TBZOH binding decrease, an index of the rate of striatal dopaminergic denervation, was about twice as high in parkinsonian patients as in controls and was not related to the age at onset of the disease. The data suggest that (1) parkinsonian symptoms appear above a threshold degeneration state corresponding to 50% of the normal innervation at the age of 60, and (2) aging does not play a major role in the process of nigrostriatal neuron degeneration in Parkinson's disease.\r"

Disorders of iron and calcium-phosphate metabolism are thought to play a role in its pathogenesis. We present the case of a patient with familial striopallidodentate calcinosis who had porphyria cutanea tarda, refractory anemia, and pseudohypoparathyroidism type 2. The serum level of ferritin was markedly increased, serum iron and iron-binding capacity were below normal, and at autopsy she had deposition of iron in liver, spleen, bone marrow, and brain. She showed intermittent mild hypocalcemia, increased serum values of parathyroid hormone, elevated renal tubular reabsorption of phosphate, and low serum levels of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, suggesting blunted renal responsiveness to endogenous parathyroid hormone. Pseudohypoparathyroidism type 2 was confirmed by infusion of synthetic parathyroid hormone, which gave a normal urinary cyclic adenosine monophosphate response, but a blunted phosphaturic response. After splenectomy for hypersplenism and weekly phlebotomies, she showed progressive improvement in function, mental status, weight, and seizure control. The hypothesis advanced is that the underlying pathophysiology of the separate diseases contributed to the formation of the brain stones through mechanisms of defective iron transport and free radical production.\r"

A fifth animal served as a longitudinal control subject. Slowing of the response across the spinal-medullary junction was a reliable sign, manifest only after prolonged exposure. Associated morphological changes were preterminal accumulation of axonal neurofilaments without synaptic disruption in the gracile nucleus. The induced alterations in the latency of short-latency somatosensory evoked potentials and in axon morphology were reversible after 7 months of recovery. The extreme delay in onset of subtle neurological dysfunction (940 days) following administration of a presumed safe level of acrylamide suggests that permissible levels of human exposure to toxins of this type should be reassessed.\r"

One hundred HIV-1 seropositive homosexual or bisexual men, of whom 26 had AIDS-related complex, 31 had generalized lymphadenopathy, and 43 had no signs or symptoms of HIV-1 infection, and 157 HIV-1 seronegative men were enrolled from a cohort of 6,701 men who were originally recruited between 1978 and 1980 for studies of hepatitis B virus infection. Evaluation included medical history, physical examination, and neuropsychological tests. Of 26 HIV-1 seropositive subjects with AIDS-related complex, 11 (42%) reported neurological, cognitive, or affective symptoms compared with 30 (19%) of 157 HIV-1 seronegative subjects (relative risk = 2.2, p = 0.02). On neuropsychological testing, subjects with AIDS-related complex performed at a significantly lower level than the HIV-1 seronegative group (p = 0.001). A significantly higher percentage of subjects with AIDS-related complex (8[31%]of 26) than HIV-1 seronegative subjects (19 [12%] of 157) had abnormal results on two or more neuropsychological tests (rate ratio = 2.5, p = 0.03). Symptoms and impairment on neuropsychological tests were correlated only within the group who had AIDS-related complex. Subjects with generalized lymphadenopathy and subjects who had no signs or symptoms of HIV-1 infection were not different from HIV-1 seronegative subjects with respect to symptoms or performance on neuropsychological tests.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Within the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study, we determined the cross-sectional prevalence of neurological abnormalities in 270 HIV-1 seropositive homosexual and bisexual men in Centers for Disease Control Groups II and III, using a control group of 193 HIV-1 seronegative homosexual men. Utilizing a neurological and neuropsychological screening battery, we found no differences in the prevalence of neuropsychiatric symptoms or in neuropsychological performance. One hundred nineteen subjects with abnormalities on screening tests completed additional neuropsychological testing and had neurological examinations. The majority had normal results and the frequency of neurological abnormalities and impaired neuropsychological performance was not significantly increased among HIV-1 seropositive subjects. Most of the abnormalities could be attributed to causes other than HIV-1. One subject had mild HIV-1-related dementia, yielding a prevalence of 3.7:1,000 (95% confidence interval: 0.19-23.7:1,000). Magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated sulcal prominence and focal areas of high signal intensity in white matter in 63% of HIV-1 seropositive subjects and 48% of uninfected control subjects. Abnormalities in cerebrospinal fluid were noted in 23 (85%) of 27 HIV-1-infected individuals. Our studies indicate that the prevalence of dementia and other HIV-1-related neurological disorders is very low among healthy HIV-1 seropositive homosexual men. The confounding effects of factors such as substance abuse or preexisting medical conditions must be considered in the neurological evaluation of such patients.\r"

Probands had symptoms before 28 years of age, had at least one Ashkenazi grandparent, and were ascertained independently of family history and not referred by another relative. All available first- and second-degree relatives were examined, and videotapes were made. Examination notes and blinded review of videotapes led to rating of dystonia as definite, probable, possible, or absent. We determined rates of illness for first- and second-degree relatives and calculated age-adjusted lifetime risks. The methods of maximum likelihood and likelihood ratio goodness-of-fit tests were used to estimate parameters and to test dominant and recessive models of inheritance. We studied 43 probands, 146 (90.1%) of 162 living first-degree relatives, and 96 (40.2%) of 239 living second-degree relatives. Nineteen relatives had definite dystonia, and 2 had probable dystonia. Using definite cases only, the age-adjusted risk for all first-degree relatives was 15.5% and for all second-degree relatives 6.5%, with no significant sex differences; parent, offspring, and sibling risks did not differ significantly. The risks were consistent with autosomal dominant inheritance with a penetrance estimated at 29.4% using definite cases only or 32.2% using definite and probable cases. Assuming a disease frequency of 1/15,000, the gene frequency was estimated to be 1/9000.\r"

Treatment for a total of 4 hours with low-molecular-weight dextran (5 mg/kg/min) and nimodipine (0.25 microgram/kg/min) produced a decrease in hematocrit from 46 +/- 1 to 33 +/- 1% at the end of the study and a statistically significant increase in local cerebral blood flow, when compared to the control group, in 6 regions of interest: the territories of the right middle (p = 0.01), right anterior (p = 0.007), and left anterior cerebral arteries (p = 0.001); the superior (p = 0.03) and inferior border zone (p = 0.003); and white matter in the right hemisphere (p = 0.04). The ischemic volume, defined as brain volume with a cerebral blood flow of less than the critical level of 25 ml/min/100 gm was determined as a percentage of total brain volume for the control and treatment groups. The group treated with low-molecular-weight dextran and nimodipine showed a 31% decrease in ischemic volume (p = 0.03). These results indicate that a bimodal approach with low-molecular-weight dextran and nimodipine can be safely used in a model of acute stroke and has a beneficial effect on local cerebral blood flow and ischemic volume when compared with control subjects. After 4 hours, the potential exists that this treatment is therapeutic, assuming that the ischemic volume progresses to infarction.\r"

  ".W": "Cytoskeletal disruption is a key pathological feature of Alzheimer's disease (AD). We used refined immunocytochemical techniques to define the range of abnormalities affecting the microtubule system in AD hippocampus. Minimal tau and tubulin immunoreactivity was granular and accumulated in otherwise normal neuronal perikarya. As tau-reactive neurofibrillary tangles formed, granular tau and tubulin staining diminished, and ubiquitin reactivity developed. In regions of high neurofibrillary tangle density, microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2) histochemical features of remaining nontangled neurons included apical dendritic degeneration with proliferation of basal dendrites. In addition to perisomatic dendritic proliferation, there was massive sprouting of tau-immunoreactive distal dystrophic neurites. Sprouting proximal dendrites and dystrophic neurites often demonstrated growth-cone-like lamellipodia and filopodia. Degeneration of the perisomatic proliferating dendrites was characterized by the accumulation of fibrillar tau immunoreactivity. The colocalization of MAP2 and tau in growth structures recapitulated their codistribution in developing neurites. The data suggest that extensive plasticity and growth response occur in tandem with neuronal degeneration in AD, and that reorganization of the cytoskeletal microtubule system may underlie these proliferative changes.\r"

We evaluated seizure localization with interictal and immediate postictal single photon emission computed tomographic images of cerebral perfusion using technetium-99m-hexamethyl-propyleneamineoxime (99mTc-HMPAO) in comparison with conventional ictal electroencephalographic (EEG) localization. Thirty-two patients with intractable complex partial seizures were studied. The mean delay from seizure onset to injection was 6.3 +/- 5.3 (SD) minutes. Independent blinded observers assessed the scans for interictal hypoperfusion and postictal focal hyperperfusion. Interictal scans alone were unreliable, indicating the correct localization in 17 patients (53%) and an incorrect site in 3 (9%). When interictal and postictal scans were interpreted together, the focus was correctly localized in 23 patients (72%). There was 1 false-positive study, and 8 patients had inconclusive changes, including 2 with inconclusive depth EEG studies. Postictal hyperperfusion was predominantly mesial temporal and frequently associated with hypoperfusion of lateral temporal cortex. Secondarily generalized seizures tended to show focal hyperperfusion less often than complex partial seizures did (Fisher's exact test p = 0.09). Combined interictal and immediate postictal single photon emission computed tomography with 99mTc-HMPAO is a useful noninvasive technique for independent confirmation of electrographic seizure localization. It may provide a suitable alternative to the use of depth electrode studies for confirmation of surface EEG findings in many patients with complex partial seizures.\r"

Following treatment with thiamine, both patients' vestibular responses improved but remained abnormal, with a short vestibulo-ocular reflex time constant and increased low-frequency rotational phase lead. Impairment of the velocity storage element attributable to damage to the vestibular nucleus and nucleus prepositus hypoglossi may account for this permanent effect on the vestibulo-ocular reflex.\r"

We investigated the effects of varying doses of intravenous phenytoin on serum concentrations and on several indexes of stimulation-evoked kindled seizures. Intravenous phenytoin produced a dose-dependent increase in serum phenytoin concentration and powerfully suppressed both limbic and clonic motor seizures. Although focal afterdischarge threshold was elevated to some extent, the most profound effect of phenytoin was limitation of seizure propagation. Variable and low serum concentrations of intraperitoneal or oral phenytoin may explain previous findings that phenytoin is only partly effective or ineffective against kindled seizures. Together with previous results with other drugs, the excellent correlation among drugs effective against human and kindled seizures strengthens the validity of this model. We suggest that the efficacy of experimental anticonvulsant drugs be established in the kindling model before initiation of clinical trials for partial and secondarily generalized seizures.\r"

Polymyxin B nonapeptide (deacylated polymyxin B) is devoid of antibiotic activity but retains the capacity to disorganize the outer membrane of gram-negative bacteria. To evaluate the potential therapeutic usefulness of this derivative, we produced purified polymyxin B nonapeptide, tested its in vivo toxicity in animals, and evaluated its in vitro antiendotoxin activity. Effectiveness as an antiendotoxin agent was assessed by examining the ability of polymyxin B nonapeptide to block the enhanced release of toxic oxygen radicals induced by lipopolysaccharide in human neutrophils (priming). In vivo, at doses of 1.5 and 3.0 mg/kg, polymyxin B nonapeptide did not exhibit the neuromuscular blocking, neurotoxic, or nephrotoxic effects that were observed with polymyxin B sulfate. Both polymyxin B and polymyxin B nonapeptide inhibited lipopolysaccharide-induced neutrophil priming in a concentration-dependent manner, but the parent compound, polymyxin B, was 63 times more effective on a weight basis. The inhibitory activity of both compounds, however, diminished rapidly when they were added after the start of the lipopolysaccharide-neutrophil incubation. We conclude that polymyxin B nonapeptide is less toxic than polymyxin B and, at the doses tested, lacks the neurotoxicity and nephrotoxicity of the parent compound. Polymyxin B nonapeptide retains the antiendotoxin activity of polymyxin B but is much less potent. The findings suggest that these compounds block an early step in the neutrophil priming process, possibly lipopolysaccharide attachment to or insertion into the neutrophil membrane.\r"

Because of the increasing importance of infections due to other species of Candida, we studied the efficacy of fluconazole in a rat model of established systemic candidiasis, using clinical isolates of C. tropicalis, C. glabrata, and C. Krusei. In normal rats, oral fluconazole at both 20 and 80 mg/kg per day for 7 days reduced both kidney and liver titers of C. tropicalis and C. glabrata compared with those in control animals and was only slightly inferior to amphotericin B. Both fluconazole and amphotericin B were ineffective in reducing kidney titers of C. krusei, but amphotericin B was more effective than fluconazole in reducing liver titers. Fluconazole showed no increased efficacy at the higher dose of 80 mg/kg per day compared with 20 mg/kg per day in any experiment. These results suggest that oral fluconazole may be useful in the treatment of established disseminated candidiasis caused by species other than C. albicans. Further in vivo studies are needed, however, to define minimum effective doses and length of therapy and to test additional Candida isolates.\r"

Six normal subjects (CLCR, greater than 60 ml/min), six patients with mild renal failure (CLCR, 31 to 60 ml/min), four patients with severe renal failure (CLCR, 7 to 30 ml/min), and four patients requiring maintenance hemodialysis (CLCR, less than 7 ml/min) were studied. The terminal half-lives for ampicillin and sulbactam more than doubled in patients with severe renal failure compared with subjects with normal renal function and mild renal insufficiency. CLCR significantly correlated with ampicillin (r = 0.88) and sulbactam (r = 0.54) total body clearance. Mean steady-state volume of distribution and nonrenal clearance for ampicillin and sulbactam were not affected by renal function. Hemodialysis approximately doubled the ampicillin and sulbactam total body clearance. Mean totals of 34.8 +/- 4.0% of the ampicillin dose and 44.7 +/- 3.2% of the sulbactam dose were removed during a 4-h hemodialysis treatment. A slight rebound in concentrations in serum after hemodialysis was observed for both drugs in all four subjects. In hemodialysis patients, the ampicillin half-life was 17.4 +/- 8.0 h and the sulbactam half-life was 13.4 +/- 7.4 h. The ampicillin and sulbactam half-lives were appreciably altered during the hemodialysis period (means of 2.2 and 2.3 h, respectively). The nearly parallel decrease in total body clearance, with volume of distribution and nonrenal clearance remaining relatively constant, suggests that the same ratio of ampicillin to sulbactam is appropriate regardless of renal function.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

At 50 to 200 mg/kg given as single or divided intraperitoneal (i.p.) doses 1 day before virus inoculation, significant protection was afforded to mice infected i.p. with Semliki Forest, San Angelo, banzi, and encephalomyocarditis viruses. Similarly, suckling rats were protected from an intranasal challenge with rat coronavirus. Against San Angelo virus, treatments could be delayed to 1 day post-virus inoculation and still show a beneficial effect. The compound was moderately effective in mice infected i.p. with herpes simplex virus type 2 or intranasally with vesicular stomatitis virus. No activity was seen against influenza B virus in mice when the analog was administered one time pre-virus inoculation or in multiple doses given before and after the virus inoculation. Nor was there a prophylactic effect against herpetic skin lesions on mice. This immune modulator may have promise for the treatment of a variety of virus infections.\r"

  ".W": "Ethambutol at 3.0 micrograms/ml inhibited the transfer of label from D-[14C]glucose into the D-arabinose residue of arabinogalactan in whole cells of a drug-susceptible strain of Mycobacterium smegmatis. This inhibition began almost immediately after exposure of the cells to the drug. When drug-resistant M. smegmatis was used in a similar experiment, no such drug inhibition was detected. A much higher concentration of ethambutol (greater than 50 micrograms/ml) was required to show this inhibition. The drug also inhibited synthesis of arabinose-containing oligosaccharides when a cell-free enzyme system was used. These results suggest that the site of action of ethambutol is somewhere on the pathway between the conversion of D-glucose to D-arabinose and the transfer of arabinose into arabinogalactan. The primary mode of action of ethambutol appears to be inhibition of arabinogalactan synthesis.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of diclofenac, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug, on biliary excretion of ceftriaxone were evaluated in rabbits. In a previous study, we demonstrated that diclofenac increased the extravascular diffusion and antibacterial efficacy of ceftriaxone without any effect on serum protein binding and urinary excretion of this antibiotic. We perfected a surgical procedure that allowed the study of biliary secretion in conscious rabbits with a stable hemodynamic state. The kinetic study was carried out on the fourth day of treatment with ceftriaxone alone (30 mg/kg per day given intramuscularly; group 1) or combined with diclofenac (1.5 mg/kg per 12 h given intramuscularly; group 2). Cumulative biliary excretion of ceftriaxone over 6 h was significantly reduced in group 2 (5,291.6 +/- 2,017.5 micrograms in group 1 versus 1,379.1 +/- 567.1 micrograms in group 2). This phenomenon occurred without any change in biliary flow. Indocyanine green clearance (20 mg/kg) increased in animals treated with ceftriaxone alone compared with the saline-treated control group (55.04 +/- 4.68 versus 33.29 +/- 7.52 ml/min per kg, respectively). Diclofenac alone caused a significant decrease in indocyanine green clearance compared with clearance in controls (25.05 +/- 4.74 versus 33.29 +/- 7.52 ml/min per kg), and indocyanine green clearance appeared not significantly different from control values in animals receiving ceftriaxone plus diclofenac. These results suggest that (i) ceftriaxone could increase hepatic blood flow and (ii) reduction of the hepatic clearance of ceftriaxone by diclofenac may be due to hepatic hemodynamic variations involving diclofenac inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis, although an interaction of diclofenac with hepatic uptake of ceftriaxone cannot be ruled out.\r"

Therapy initiated 12 h after viral inoculation and given twice a day significantly reduced the acute neural infection so that HSV was recovered from only 1 of 64 neural tissue specimens obtained from R837 recipients compared with 43 of 56 specimens obtained from placebo recipients (P less than 0.0001). R837 initiated 36 h after HSV inoculation and given once a day also significantly reduced the total mean lesion score of the acute disease from 14.1 +/- 4.3 to 2.6 +/- 5.3 (P less than 0.0001) and shortened the period of vaginal HSV shedding from 6.9 +/- 1.7 to 3.2 +/- 1.4 days (P less than 0.001). R837-treated animals also developed fewer HSV recurrences than did controls (2.0 +/- 1.7 versus 5.1 +/- 1.7; P less than 0.0002). Latent HSV was detected in 23 of 24 dorsal root ganglia explant cultures from placebo recipients but in only 2 of 30 cultures from R837-treated animals, and HSV in these 2 cultures was detectable only with the addition of a demethylating agent. Topical R837 exhibited in vivo anti-HSV activity, reducing both acute and latent neural infections as well as acute and recurrent genital disease.\r"

The conjugates and parent beta-lactam antibiotics showed similar antibacterial activities against Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus. The affinity of each conjugate for the chemotactic peptide receptor was determined in a competitive binding assay, using 3H-labeled N-formyl-L-methionyl-L-leucyl-L-phenylalanine. All conjugates bound to the receptor, but with affinities ranging from 1/3 to 1/100 that of the tritiated substrate. There was good correlation between receptor affinity and stimulation of chemotaxis. The peptide-antibiotic conjugates also stimulated the oxidative metabolism of the HL-60 cells by inducing the production of superoxide and hydrogen peroxide as determined by Luminol- and Lucigenin-enhanced chemiluminescence. These conjugates, based on N-formyl-L-methionyl-L-leucyl-L-phenylalanine, thus combine both potent antibacterial and immunostimulatory properties within the same molecule.\r"

Strains of Staphylococcus aureus. S. epidermidis, Streptococcus sanguis, and Enterococcus faecalis were used to establish endocarditis. A single 10-mg/kg dose of daptomycin and a single 25-mg/kg dose of vancomycin were both effective in prevention of endocarditis produced by strains of S. aureus and S. sanguis. Daptomycin was more effective than vancomycin for prevention of endocarditis caused by the strain of S. epidermidis. A single dose of daptomycin also was more effective in prevention of staphylococcal and enterococcal endocarditis than were single-dose regimens of cefazolin (100 mg/kg) and the combination of ampicillin (30 mg/kg) plus gentamicin (3 mg/kg), respectively. For treatment of endocarditis, daptomycin (10 mg/kg) as a single daily dose was as effective as regimens of either vancomycin or beta-lactam antibiotics for staphylococcal and enterococcal endocarditis. Daptomycin, however, was not as effective as a single daily dose of 600,000 U of procaine penicillin for endocarditis caused by the strain of S. sanguis.\r"

Clarithromycin (A-56268; TE-031) is a new macrolide which is twofold more active than erythromycin against most aerobic bacteria. In addition, higher levels in serum and tissue are achieved with clarithromycin than with erythromycin. In this study, clarithromycin, erythromycin, difloxacin, temafloxacin, ciprofloxacin, rifampin, amikacin, and ethambutol were tested in vitro and in vivo against the M. avium complex. The MICs for 90% of strains tested were 4 micrograms/ml for clarithromycin, 64 micrograms/ml for erythromycin, 32 micrograms/ml for difloxacin, 8 micrograms/ml for temafloxacin, 4 micrograms/ml for ciprofloxacin, 4 micrograms/ml for rifampin, 32 micrograms/ml for amikacin, and 32 micrograms/ml for ethambutol. Beige mice were infected intravenously with 10(7) CFU of M. avium ATCC 25291. Treatment was started on day 6 after infection and was administered twice a day at 8-h intervals for 9 days. Clarithromycin was the most effective compound in these tests and was effective in reducing the viable bacterial counts in the spleen when it was administered subcutaneously or orally at a dose of 25 mg/kg. Amikacin was the only other compound which showed activity in vivo. The peak concentration in serum at which clarithromycin was active was approximately 1.0 microgram/ml.\r"

The MIC of norfloxacin for the strain increased from 0.1 to 3.13 micrograms/ml. Furthermore, when the fragment was recloned into S. aureus, the transformant NY12, containing recombinant plasmid pTUS20, had the same level of resistance to norfloxacin as did the original strain, although it was less resistant to ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin.

By virus yield reduction and plaque reduction assays, 2'-nor-cGMP was demonstrated to be 15- to 20-fold more potent against GPCMV infection than its parental drug DHPG. The selectivity index of 2-nor-cGMP was 110, which was 10-fold higher than that of DHPG. In cultured cells, 2'-nor-cGMP attained maximal antiviral activity when added to the cells within 12 h postinfection. In the studies on GPCMV infection in guinea pigs, 2'-nor-cGMP administered subcutaneously once daily (5 mg/kg per day) for 8 days, starting 24 after virus inoculation, significantly suppressed GPCMV infectivity titers in the blood, spleen, lung, and salivary gland during acute infection (10 days postinfection) as compared with sham-treated infected animals. A greater reduction of GPCMV infectivity titers in the salivary gland was noted during chronic infection (i.e., 24 days postinfection). Clinically, splenomegaly and peripheral lymphocytosis were significantly modified as compared with the sham-treated animals (P less than 0.05). The drug, administered at this dosage, was reasonably tolerated by the guinea pigs and showed clinical benefit.\r"

At the beginning of the experiment, female Sprague-Dawley rats were infused intravenously with saline (control) or endotoxin (0.25 mg/kg) during 15 min. Thereafter, saline was constantly infused for the following 4 h. Two hours after the beginning of the infusion, animals were injected intravenously with a single dose of vancomycin (20 mg/kg). The drug levels in serum; renal cortex, medulla, and papilla; and urine were evaluated from 0.08 to 24 h after injection. Analysis of the area under the curve of the drug concentration in the different kidney components versus time showed a higher accumulation of vancomycin in the renal cortex and medulla in the endotoxin-infused rats than in the normal rats (P less than 0.01). Endotoxin was associated with an increase in the half-life in serum (P less than 0.01) and a lower elimination rate constant. The total clearance of vancomycin from plasma was significantly decreased in endotoxin-treated rats (P less than 0.01).

Caution should be exercised in the use of this combination in treatment of meningitis, in which a high bacterial density is commonly encountered.\r"

Although the MICs of itraconzole obtained with seven of the eight Mel- strains were lower than those obtained with the melanized wild-type strains, there was no such trend observed with fluconazole, the other triazole tested. Furthermore, there was no apparent difference in MICs when comparing the melanized wild-type and the Mel-strains for the other drugs tested. Thus, no consistent increase in in vitro antifungal activity was found to be associated with a specific class of drug. Therefore, melanin does not appear to confer protection against some of the more important antifungal agents.\r"
