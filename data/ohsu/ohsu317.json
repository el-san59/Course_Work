The choroidal fissure, the site of attachment of the choroid plexus in the lateral ventricle, is located between the fornix and thalamus in the medial part of the lateral ventricle. The choroidal fissure is divided into three parts: (a) a body portion situated in the body of the lateral ventricle between the body of the fornix and the thalamus, (b) an atrial part located in the atrium of the lateral ventricle between the crus of the fornix and the pulvinar, and (c) a temporal part situated in the temporal horn between the fimbria of the fornix and the lower surface of the thalamus. The three parts of the fissure are the thinnest sites in the wall of the lateral ventricle bordering the basal cisterns and the roof of the third ventricle. Opening through the body portion of the choroidal fissure from the lateral ventricle exposes the velum interpositum and third ventricle. Opening through the temporal portion of the choroidal fissure from the temporal horn exposes the structures in the ambient and crural cisterns. Opening through the atrial portion of the fissure from the atrium exposes the quadrigeminal cistern, the pineal region, and the posterior portion of the ambient cistern. The neural, arterial, and venous relationships of each part of the fissure are reviewed. The operative approaches directed through each part of the fissure are also reviewed.\r"

Preoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of 27 children showed tethering (27), intradural fat (17), distal syrinxes (8), and thickened filum terminale (2). There was an excellent correlation between MRI and the surgical findings. Postoperative MRI was obtained within 1 year after operation in 14 children; spinal cord ascent was seen on only four studies and retethering was suspected on five studies. We consider MRI the procedure of choice to diagnose a tethered cord because this technique accurately defines anatomical relationships without risk to the patient. In addition, we conclude that cord ascent is seen less often than expected and that retethering may occur, especially to cadaveric dura mater.\r"

The purpose of this study was to determine if the incidence of complicated coronary lesions, which may be a cause of unstable ischemic syndromes, is increased in survivors of an aborted sudden death, especially those without ventricular tachycardia inducible by programmed ventricular stimulation. Nineteen consecutive survivors of an aborted sudden death not due to an acute infarction who underwent coronary angiography and programmed ventricular stimulation within 3 weeks of the event were matched for age, sex, previous infarction, and severity of coronary artery disease with 38 control patients with stable coronary artery disease. There was no difference in the incidence of complicated coronary lesions between the total group of sudden death victims and controls (47% vs 42%). However, 6 of the 11 (64%) sudden death patients who did not have inducible ventricular tachycardia had a complicated lesion as compared to only two of the eight (25%) patients with inducible ventricular tachycardia (p = 0.10). Angiograms identified a complicated lesion or functioning myocardium supplied only by collateral vessels as possible sources of transient ischemia in 73% of noninducible sudden death patients and in 25% of inducible sudden death patients (p = 0.04). Thus coronary angiography in cardiac arrest survivors who do not have inducible ventricular tachycardia often suggests a possible mechanism of transient ischemia.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Responders (13 patients) showed an increase in stroke volume index (SVI) as a result of a mean 30% increase in right ventricular end-diastolic volume index (RVEDVI) and a mean 17% increase in left ventricular end-diastolic volume index (LVEDVI) during volume loading. In the nonresponders (five patients) fluid loading resulted in a decreased or unchanged SVI; this was accompanied by a 7% increase in RVEDVI but no change in LVEDVI, although both the central venous pressure and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure increased. At baseline, nonresponders differed from responders as evidenced by a high central venous pressure and RVEDVI but a lower mean arterial pressure: thus, right ventricular coronary perfusion pressure was lower and right ventricular wall stress may have been higher. Mean pulmonary artery pressure did not differ between the groups. Our data suggest that in some patients with septic shock volume loading does not result in increased forward flow because of right ventricular failure associated with pulmonary hypertension and coronary hypotension.\r"

One of the key questions is which combination of laser source, energy parameters, and transmitting fiberoptic would be best suited for intravascular use. In most experiments argon, neodymium-YAG, and excimer lasers, coupled to suitable optical fibers, have been used. We now describe the use of a carbon dioxide fiberoptic laser catheter for the creation of an atrial septal defect. Silver halide infrared transmitting fibers were inserted into standard 6 French cardiovascular catheters. This laser catheter system, capable of transmitting several watts of pulsed CO2 laser energy, was initially used to create atrial septal defects in isolated dog hearts to determine the best energy parameters. Atrial septostomy was later performed successfully in four of five anesthetized dogs. The thermal damage extended 50 to 60 micron beyond the \"holes\" created by the laser irradiation in the interatrial septum. Thus, pulsed CO2 laser irradiation, delivered through optical fibers, can create an atrial septal defect.\r"

Among 12 Japanese infants in whom a diagnosis of opening of the atrial septum was made in the neonatal period, eight had spontaneous closure at age 2 to 16 months, as shown by two-dimensional echocardiography. To study the exact incidence and natural course of atrial openings in the neonatal period, another 102 consecutive infants from two neonatal care units were followed prospectively with the use of two-dimensional echocardiography. Atrial openings were evident in 24 infants (24%) within the first week of life, in 13 (13%) older than 1 week, in seven (7%) older than 1 month, in five (5%) older than 6 months, and in two (2%) older than 1 year. Twenty-eight of the 30 infants with spontaneous closure in both groups had valvelike openings of the atrial septum that closed by fusion of the valves. ASDs that closed spontaneously in infants with clinical signs and symptoms of atrial shunt may be the same clinical entity as the valvelike openings of the atrial septum frequently observed in neonates with few clinical symptoms and may be differentiated morphologically from ASDs with openings without valve formation, which have little tendency to close.\r"

We assessed hemoglobin levels, aortic oxygen saturation, iron stores, red cell 2,3-DPG, oxygen consumption, and systemic O2 transport in 19 hypoxemic patients, aged 3 months to 8 years. Low erythropoietin titers (less than 30 mU/dl) were found in 14 patients. Patients with high erythropoietin titers had lower Pao2 (36 +/- 7 vs 49 +/- 7 mm Hg, p less than 0.01), lower aortic saturation (68 +/- 12 vs 81 +/- 9%, p less than 0.01), and higher red cell 2,3-DPG (2.47 +/- 0.34 vs 3.23 +/- 0.73 mumol/ml, p less than 0.01). Aortic oxygen saturation higher than 80% was associated with a low erythropoietin titer and a hemoglobin level below that associated with hyperviscosity. The relationship between aortic oxygen saturation and hemoglobin concentration was strong (r = 0.77). These data suggest that for children less than 8 years of age, adequate compensation for moderate hypoxemia can occur with moderate increases in hemoglobin levels.\r"

To determine whether these differences persisted and whether AAI pacing resulted in a lower mortality rate than VVI pacing during long-term follow-up, the treatment groups were restudied after an average of 4 years of pacemaker treatment. The incidence of permanent atrial fibrillation was still significantly higher (p less than 0.0005) in the VVI group than in the AAI group after the additional 2 years (VVI = 47%, an increase from 29%; AAI = 6.7%, an increase from 3.4%). Congestive heart failure occurred significantly more often in the VVI group than in the AAI group (37% vs 15%, p less than 0.005). Analysis of survival data showed a higher overall mortality rate in the VVI group (23% vs 8%, p less than 0.05). The development of high-degree atrioventricular block in the AAI group remained low (total 4.5%). Thus, in sinus node disease, the advantages of AAI over VVI pacing persist during long-term follow-up. The differences in cardiovascular morbidity between the groups tend to increase with time and appear to result in a lower mortality rate among patients treated with AAI pacing.\r"

  ".W": "Few reports have been published on the epidemiology of heart rate in general populations including women and blacks. In the first cycle of the National Health Examination Survey, resting heart rate was significantly higher in women than in men at each age in both races. Age and race were inconsistently related to heart rate, black men having slightly lower rates than white men at ages 18 to 34. The product of heart rate and mean blood pressure was consistently highest in black women. Heart rate was associated with obesity, waist girth, and waist-to-hip girth ratio in men under 55 years and with blood pressure and post-load serum glucose in all groups. Sex differences at each age were larger (6 to 14 beats/min) when adjusted for multiple variables. Multivariate linear regression analysis confirmed the independent associations of heart rate with blood pressure and serum glucose. After controlling for other risk factors, prevalent hypertensive subjects had higher heart rates than normotensive individuals in all groups. Further research is needed to elucidate mechanisms of the associations of resting heart rate with sex, risk factors, coronary heart disease, and mortality.\r"

Among 985 patients presenting within 18 hours of the onset of ischemic chest pain, 35 had complete LBBB. Acute MI was identified by serial MB-creatine kinase (CK) elevations and prior MI was determined by previously documented ECG and/or enzyme changes. Among those with LBBB, 24 patients had acute and/or prior MI, while 11 had neither. Eleven ECG criteria previously proposed for detecting MI in the presence of LBBB were evaluated. In patients presenting with ischemic chest pain and complete LBBB, presence of any one of the following ECG criteria was highly specific (90% to 100%) and predictive (85% to 100%) for acute or prior MI: Q waves in at least two of leads I, aVL, V5, or V6; R wave regression from V1 to V4; notching of the upstroke of the S wave in at least two of leads V3, V4, or V5, and primary ST-T wave changes in two or more adjacent leads.\r"

Results indicated a direct relationship between self-reported distress levels and occurrence of ectopic beats. This relationship was unaltered by adjusting simultaneously for known predictors of arrhythmias, including cardiac risk, age, and the prescription of beta-blocker agents. Thus this study represents an initial demonstration in a post-myocardial infarction population that psychosocial factors have prognostic significance for arrhythmias and, presumably, sudden death.\r"

  ".W": "Sympathetic hyperactivity plays a major role in the genesis of malignant arrhythmias during acute myocardial ischemia. An experimental model in which life-threatening arrhythmias are specifically and consistently induced by the interaction between acute myocardial ischemia and left stellate ganglion stimulation has been developed in alpha-chloralose anesthetized cats. In this preparation, drugs that share antiischemic, antiadrenergic, and specific electrophysiologic effects, such as verapamil, diltiazem, and amiodarone, were most effective. To evaluate the relative role of these different properties in mediating the effect of antiarrhythmic drugs, we used this same model to test nifedipine, a calcium channel blocker that is able to counteract the consequences of sympathetic stimulation on coronary circulation but has no electrophysiologic properties at concentrations relevant in the clinical setting. Nifedipine (15 micrograms/kg) prevented the occurrence of ventricular fibrillation in 10 of 13 animals (77%). Its efficacy was independent of changes in the peripheral hemodynamics. Plasma concentrations of nifedipine were within the therapeutic range in humans. To evaluate if this rather striking protective effect was specifically related to the prevention of the deleterious consequences of sympathetic stimulation, the effect of nifedipine on ventricular fibrillation threshold was studied in an additional group of 13 cats in the nonischemic state, during acute myocardial ischemia and during ischemia plus sympathetic stimulation. Nifedipine did not modify ventricular fibrillation threshold in nonischemic or in ischemic conditions. However, nifedipine specifically prevented the further reduction in ventricular fibrillation threshold occurring when sympathetic stimulation was superimposed on acute ischemia. These data suggest that the extension of ischemic damage by sympathetic stimulation is an important progenitor of arrhythmogenic action during acute ischemia.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The acute effects of intravenous metoprolol were evaluated in 30 patients with myocardial infarction by means of serial hemodynamic and radionuclide measurements of left ventricular function. Within 1 hour of completion of the metoprolol dosing, 90% of the patients underwent cardiac catheterization to define anatomy and to assess patients for interventional therapy; the remainder had catheterization by 72 hours. All patients tolerated intravenous metoprolol without significant side effects. Patient responses to therapy were divided into two groups based on the angiographic findings. At catheterization, all group 1 patients had visible collaterals to or a patent vessel supplying the vascular distribution of the infarction. All group 2 patients had occluded coronary arteries without evidence of collaterals to the infarct zone. Group 1 (n = 13) improved both systolic and diastolic left ventricular function (mean ejection fraction [EF] = 46% to 55%, peak filling rate [PFR] = 2.1 to 3.2 Edv/sec), while group 2 (n = 17) patients were unchanged (EF = 43% to 42%, PFR = 2.0 to 1.9). Patient characteristics and time to treatment were similar in both groups, as were the hemodynamic effects of metoprolol. Heart rate decreased 20% in group 1 and 22% in group 2 and cardiac output fell 22% in group 1 and 32% in group 2. Acute improvement in ventricular function in these patients appears to be closely related to the coronary anatomy, and in those with flow to the infarct zone, intravenous metoprolol may be effective in preserving left ventricular function.\r"

  ".W": "To evaluate the time course of spontaneous changes in wall motion following anterior infarction, we prospectively performed serial apical four-chamber two-dimensional echocardiography on 45 consecutive long-term survivors of initial transmural anterior infarction. Studies were performed on admission (1 +/- 1 days), 1 week after admission (6 +/- 2 days), at discharge (15 +/- 8 days), and at long-term follow-up (235 +/- 186 days). Ventricular size was expressed as end-diastolic area in square centimeters. Wall motion for this tomographic section was evaluated as the percent change in left ventricular area from end diastole to end systole (% LVA). Patients were grouped on the basis of significant differences for %LVA between the first and fourth studies. Group I (n = 14) had improved wall motion (23 +/- 5% to 38 +/- 9%); group II (n = 23) did not change (22 +/- 9% to 23 +/- 11%); and group III (n = 8) had worsened wall motion (28 +/- 6% to 18 +/- 7%). End-diastolic area did not change over the study period for groups I and II but increased significantly for group III (30 +/- 6 to 35 +/- 4 cm2, p less than 0.05). Most of the increase in end-diastolic area for group III was between the third and fourth study. The percent improvement (%IMP) in wall motion for patients in group I who did not have ventricular fibrillation outside the hospital expressed in days (t) following infarction fit an exponential curve (%IMP = 100-100e-(.108t) that predicts that 70% of eventual recovery will occur in the first 15 days post-infarction. We conclude that changes in left ventricular size and wall motion occur following anterior infarction with improvement or worsening occurring spontaneously in some patients. If improvement occurs, it should be evident within 2 weeks of infarction; infarct expansion in this select group of long-term survivors occurred primarily after discharge.\r"

  ".W": "The role of blood pressure alterations in the delayed onset of myocardial ischemia following sympathetic stimulation was studied in seven anesthetized dogs. In the presence of coronary stenosis, stimulation of the left stellate ganglion produced significant increases in heart rate and mean aortic pressure, but not in mean coronary blood flow or intracoronary pressure. Following cessation of stimulation, heart rate and aortic pressure returned to control levels over a 1- to 2-minute period. During this time, there was a progressive coronary vasoconstriction, as indicated by a significant fall in coronary arterial flow and intracoronary pressure. When the hypertensive response to stellate stimulation was prevented by controlled exsanguination, the coronary vasoconstriction was not delayed but occurred during stimulation. In the second phase of experiments, the aorta was constricted so as to raise systemic pressure to the peak level achieved during stimulation. Elevation of systemic pressure consistently restored coronary arterial blood flow and intracoronary pressure to the control values. By contrast, induction of hypertension by restimulation of the stellate ganglion failed to reverse the delayed coronary vasoconstriction. We conclude that delayed myocardial ischemia results from the imbalance between coronary distending pressure and an alpha-adrenergically mediated vasoconstrictor activity that persists following cessation of sympathetic nervous system stimulation.\r"

The neuron disruption was achieved by the application of phenol to the epicardium of the left ventricle. Evidence for denervation was the reduction in endogenous norepinephrine (NE) concentrations in the myocardium beneath the region of phenol treatment and toward the apex. Radiolabeled meta-iodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) acts as an analog of NE and as such is concentrated in adrenergic nerve terminals. Following phenol application, MIBG labeled with 125I was found, 20 hours after injection, to be distributed within myocardium in patterns comparable to those of NE. However, left stellectomy did not alter the distributions of NE or 125I-MIBG in the myocardium and apparently did not disrupt adrenergic innervation. MIBG labeled with 123I enabled scintigraphic images of heart neurons in the living dog 3 and 20 hours after injection; these images portrayed the regions of adrenergic neuron disruption caused by phenol treatment. Concentrations of thallium-201 depicted on scintigraphic image and of triphenyltetrazolium observed on in vitro staining demonstrated no myocardial injury. Thus scintigraphy with 123I-MIBG will display regional adrenergic denervations in the heart.\r"

In 24 patients the indications were: acute sinoatrial block, atrioventricular block, or asystole with unconsciousness due to acute myocardial infarction in eight; sick sinus node syndrome in 12; and other indications in four patients. These patients were paced for 2 minutes to 14 hours; the median length of pacing was 15 minutes. The pacing thresholds varied from 30 to 110 mA; pacing was achieved in 22 patients without serious side effects. Nine patients needed sedation and six were unconscious; 12 later had a temporary or permanent transvenous pacemaker implanted. In 11 patients noninvasive transcutaneous pacing was performed prior to implantation of a permanent pacing catheter: in eight pacing was done just prior to catheter insertion, and in three the threshold was determined before a weekend on which the patient had to wait for implantation. Pacing thresholds were from 45 to 90 mA; the median was 55 mA. Seven of these eight patients felt chest pain. No serious side effects were seen. We conclude that transcutaneous pacing is effective and safe and can be used instead of inserting a transvenous catheter if this is impossible or until one can be inserted.\r"

  ".W": "During a 4-year period, 1,022 blacks underwent angiography at our institution for the presumptive diagnosis of coronary artery disease (CAD). Among the 454 men, at least one coronary stenosis was demonstrated in 288 cases (63%), while significant narrowing was found in 242 of 568 women (43%). Despite the frequent finding of normal coronary arteries, those patients with significant CAD had severe disease. Thus among men with CAD, left main stenosis was present in 7% and three-vessel narrowing was seen in 53%; among the women, 8% had left main stenosis and three-vessel disease was present in 52%. Two countervailing processes appear to be occurring, namely (1) identification of true coronary symptoms is difficult in this group of patients and (2) diagnosis of true cases occurs late in the course of the disease and the distribution of the number of vessels involved is skewed upwards. Increased echocardiographically determined left ventricular mass and hypertension were prevalent among all groups. These data suggest that the approach to the diagnosis of CAD in the black population is difficult and severe CAD occurs frequently.\r"

This trend is largely attributable to improved detection and management of cardiovascular risk factors. The pioneering work of the Framingham Heart Study, which has followed subjects since the late 1940s, has helped shed light on the risks conferred by factors such as advancing age, hypertension, smoking, elevated serum cholesterol, diabetes, left ventricular hypertrophy, and obesity. As a result of this ongoing investigation, clinicians have gained a better understanding of the ways in which cardiovascular risks can be modified so that mortality rates will hopefully continue to decline.\r"

  ".W": "Left ventricular hypertrophy, which is defined as an abnormal increase in the mass of the left ventricle, has become recognized as an important independent risk factor for predicting several untoward cardiac events, including myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, and sudden death. The presence of left ventricular hypertrophy is difficult to detect by electrocardiography but can be accurately assessed by echocardiography. Left ventricular hypertrophy can be detected in about 5% of all hypertensive patients by electrocardiography but is found in about 50% by echocardiography. Although it is possible to restore left ventricular mass to normal by controlling hypertension with pharmacotherapy, several commonly prescribed antihypertensive medications, including diuretics and vasodilators, have failed to demonstrate the ability to reverse left ventricular hypertrophy. Other agents, including most beta-blockers, have been found to reverse it. Reversal may take 18 to 24 months from the initiation of therapy. This reversal may be accompanied by an increase in cardiac index, reductions in total peripheral resistance, and improvements in the diastolic properties of the left ventricle. It has yet to be determined whether these improvements reduce the risk of myocardial infarction, heart failure, and sudden death. However, it is likely that some antihypertensive medications may be superior to others in reducing long-term cardiac risks.\r"

  ".W": "Epidemiologic evidence increasingly implicates psychosocial variables in the development of coronary heart disease in human beings, an association that appears to be independent of the effects of other coronary disease risk factors. It has been hypothesized that behavioral influences on coronary heart disease are mediated by activation of the sympathetic nervous system, perhaps through exacerbation of coronary artery atherosclerosis. This article summarizes several studies of the effects of stress and sympathetic arousal on atherosclerosis in a nonhuman primate model of atherogenesis. The application of a behavioral stressor involving periodic reorganization of social group memberships resulted in worsened coronary atherosclerosis among male cynomolgus monkeys (Macaca fascicularis) fed a cholesterol-containing diet, relative to control animals housed in groups of fixed (stable) membership, but only among those monkeys that retained dominant social status during the course of the study. This effect could not be attributed to concomitant variability in blood pressure or serum lipid concentrations. When the same experimental procedures were applied to males fed a diet low in saturated fat and cholesterol, the manipulation of group memberships similarly led to development of greater atherosclerosis in the coronary arteries. In related observations, monkeys that exhibited the largest heart rate responses to a standardized behavioral challenge had more extensive coronary atherosclerosis than animals showing a less pronounced cardiac responsivity to stress. In a final investigation, we observed that the exacerbated atherosclerosis of dominant monkeys consuming an atherogenic diet and housed in unstable social groups could be prevented by long-term administration of a beta-adrenoreceptor-blocking agent, propranolol hydrochloride.\r"

Because experimental stress testing in the laboratory permits the examination of the underlying mechanism for stress-induced blood pressure, analyses of cardiovascular reactivity during emotional stress could be of particular clinical importance. The analyses of pooled data during the past 6 years (n = 298, age from 20 to 60 years, normotensive subjects as well as patients with borderline and mild essential hypertension) reveal that stress-induced changes in stroke volume and especially in total peripheral resistance are crucial parameters to analyze the hemodynamic stress response. However, neither those simple nor complex response patterns such as \"hot reactor\" describe clinically distinct subgroups of persons. When physiologic testing was repeated in hypertensive patients after effective long-term antihypertensive therapy with clonidine, oxprenolol, nitrendipine, or enalapril, no attenuation of the stress-induced increase in blood pressure was found in any of these groups. However, heart rate reactivity and stress-induced changes in total peripheral resistance were altered significantly by oxprenolol and nitrendipine. The beta-adrenoceptor blocker decreased heart rate reactivity and increased reactivity of peripheral resistance; the calcium antagonist decreased stress-induced changes in peripheral resistance and increased the heart rate response. The centrally acting sympatholytic regimen and the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor had no impact on the hemodynamic response pattern during emotional challenge.\r"

The \"stress\" pressure used was the mean blood pressure obtained by averaging three readings taken during videogame playing. A good correlation (r = 0.78) between work-time blood pressure and the laboratory stress pressure was noted. The correlation was improved (r = 0.8) when the averages of laboratory resting and stress values were used. A relationship was also noted between peak pressures obtained during the laboratory testing and those obtained during work-time by ambulatory monitoring.\r"

Mean daily blood pressure determined by ambulatory monitoring is generally conceded to be the most significant prognosticator but is not suitable for routine use. Psychophysiologic stress testing may provide a means of estimating the mean daily blood pressure. Carbon dioxide rebreathing and other techniques being investigated may also provide useful hemodynamic measurements. Because of the adverse impacts of antihypertensive medications, nonpharmacologic approaches to treatment may be preferable where possible.

  ".W": "The foam cell has been recognized as a characteristic feature of xanthomas in skin and tendons, and also of atheromas. Many foam cells in these lesions share properties characteristic of the macrophages. Therefore macrophages may be the progenitor of certain foam cells that are involved in atherogenesis. Several investigators demonstrated in vitro that macrophages can ingest large amounts of certain chemically modified lipoproteins, such as acetylated low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and malondialdehyde-treated LDL, through the process of receptor-mediated endocytosis. By this process, macrophages become foam cells. But this process has not been demonstrated in vivo. Recently, oxidized LDL has been suggested to play an important role in atherogenesis by facilitating the accumulation of lipids in macrophages in vitro. Probucol, originally developed as an antioxidant, prevents this oxidative modification of LDL in vitro. Moreover, there are some clinical reports that probucol induces regression of cutaneous and tendon xanthomas in patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia. A question was posed whether in vivo probucol could prevent the progression of atherosclerosis in homozygous Watanabe heritable hyperlipidemic (WHHL) rabbits, an animal model for familial hypercholesterolemia. At age 2 months, 8 WHHL rabbits were classified into 2 groups: group A rabbits were controls and group B rabbits were treated with 1% probucol. After 6 months of treatment, average plasma concentrations of cholesterol were 704 +/- 121 mg/dl in group A and 584 +/- 61 mg/dl in group B. The percentage of surface area of total thoracic aorta with visible plaques in group A vs group B was 54.2 +/- 18.8% vs 7.0 +/- 6.3%, respectively.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

These developments led to the current study of lipoprotein oxidation in streptozotocin-induced diabetes in the rat. This presentation will first review investigations of the toxicity of LDL to cells grown in tissue culture that occurs when LDL becomes oxidized. Then the results are presented indicating that lipoprotein oxidation occurs in vivo in experimental diabetes and renders diabetic lipoproteins cytotoxic in vitro.

  ".W": "Insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) results from an inflammatory process leading to destruction of the insulin-producing beta cells of the pancreas. Genetically mediated autoimmune processes are considered the most likely explanation for IDDM in humans, while viral infections, toxic agents, nutritional alterations and stress are also considered possibilities. The precise mechanisms by which autoimmunity, infections, toxins or other agents produce beta cell damage are not known. Toxin-induced diabetes in animals can be prevented by antioxidant therapy, while an agent that inhibits hydroxyl radical formation, desferrioxamine, extends the survival time of free allotypic islets in nonobese diabetic mice. The BB/W rat develops IDDM secondary to a pervasive autoimmune defect. This well-studied animal model develops IDDM with a highly predictable frequency and timing. This study describes the effects of the potent antioxidant, probucol, on the development of diabetes in BB rats by introducing it into standard rat chow at a 1% concentration at the time of weaning, and continuing this feeding schedule through 160 days of life. Control rats from split litters received standard chow only. Diabetes developed in 86.2% of the control rats at a mean age of 90.4 days. Probucol administration was associated with a reduction to 62% and a delay in diabetes diagnosis to 99.6 days. These very preliminary results suggest that probucol may be altering the inflammatory process, resulting in beta cell destruction in these genetically diabetes-prone rats.\r"

  ".W": "To explain the strong effect of probucol on xanthomas, the drug's effect on lipid storage in macrophages in the presence of denatured low-density lipoprotein (LDL) was studied. Two macrophage cell lines, UE-12 and THP-1, were used. Those cells stored lipids and became foam cells when they were incubated with acetylated LDL (acetyl-LDL). When probucol was added into the medium either in ethanolic solution or in the form bound to LDL, the storage of cholesterol and other lipids and the development of macrophages into foam cells were greatly suppressed. Two functions of probucol should be considered: (1) It inhibited the uptake of acetyl-LDL by macrophages; and (2) it enhanced the release of cholesterol from these cells. Cells were first incubated with probucol. After the cells were washed with fresh medium, the radiolabeled acetyl-LDL was added to the medium and the degradation of acetyl-LDL was measured. Increasing the concentration of probucol led to a decrease in degradation of acetyl-LDL by macrophages. Probucol also suppressed the uptake of albumin. Macrophages were incubated with acetyl-LDL, washed once, then incubated with or without probucol and high-density lipoprotein (HDL). Addition of HDL caused a rapid decrease in cholesterol content in the cells, and this phenomenon was enhanced by probucol for both kinds of cells. The secretion of apolipoprotein E was also stimulated by the addition of probucol. These 2 sets of experimental results suggest that probucol prevents lipid storage in macrophages by both suppressing the uptake and stimulating the release of cholesterol and other lipids into or from the macrophages.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Also, total cellular cholesterol was increased, cholesterol synthesis was decreased, and cholesterol esterification was increased. The increase in cellular cholesterol was not the result of increased lipoprotein uptake but appeared to be the result of an interaction between cell and lipoprotein in which the cell became enriched and the lipoprotein depleted in cholesterol. This type of change in lipoprotein composition after treatment is also observed clinically.\r"

Consequently, the rate of degradation of oxidized LDL by macrophages can be 3 to 10 times that of native LDL. Antioxidants, such as probucol, are highly effective in preventing the oxidative modification of LDL. Our recent studies show that probucol treatment of LDL receptor-deficient Watanabe heritable hyperlipidemic (WHHL) rabbits selectively inhibits the degradation of LDL in fatty streak lesions (which are rich in macrophage-derived foam cells) without inhibiting degradation in nonlesioned areas (where degradation is predominantly in smooth muscle cells, which do not express the scavenger receptor). Furthermore, the rate of progression of lesions in probucol-treated animals was significantly slower than in a lovastatin-treated group maintained at equal total plasma cholesterol levels. These results strongly suggest that probucol, through an antioxidant activity not necessarily related to its ability to lower plasma cholesterol levels, can slow the progression of the foam-cell-rich fatty streak lesion of atherosclerosis.\r"

A 0.54 kb apoE cDNA was cloned from a rabbit liver cDNA library using a synthetic oligonucleotide probe. The amino acid sequence deduced from an apoE coding region indicated 78% homology for human apoE and 63% homology for rat apoE. RNA blot analysis showed that apoE mRNA was most abundant in the liver, then in the brain and spleen. The relative amounts of apoE mRNA were determined in tissues of rabbits fed a normal diet, or high-cholesterol (1%) diet with or without probucol (1%). ApoE mRNA levels increased 2- to 4-fold in the spleen and brain after cholesterol feeding for 4 weeks and were higher by 52 to 70% in the spleen of probucol-treated rabbits than in nontreated rabbits. This induction of apoE mRNA occurs within 7 days after the initiation of probucol treatment. However, apoE mRNA levels in the liver, a major apoE-synthesizing organ, were not enhanced after probucol treatment. These results indicate that probucol induces apoE mRNA expression specifically in the spleen and may affect apoE-mediated lipoprotein metabolism, the so-called reverse cholesterol transport.\r"

Furthermore, a close correlation was found between the extent of the regression and the reduction of HDL cholesterol, which suggests that the probucol-induced decrease in HDL may not be an atherogenic change, but may reflect a favorable change for lipoprotein metabolism. The present study also evaluated the effects of probucol on HDL metabolism in patients with familial hyperHDL2 cholesterolemia who had extremely high levels of HDL cholesterol ranging from 130 to 280 mg/dl. Premature corneal opacities were present in 2 patients, 1 of whom also had coronary artery disease despite high HDL cholesterol levels. In the 2 cases, the net transfer of cholesteryl ester from HDL to very low density lipoprotein and LDL was impaired, and low hepatic triglyceride lipase activity was observed, but cholesteryl ester transfer protein was not deficient. Administration of probucol to these patients caused a marked reduction of serum cholesterol, which was accounted for exclusively by a reduction in the HDL2 fraction. The size of the HDL2 particles, which had been much larger, decreased to normal, and the net transfer rate of cholesteryl ester was normalized. In the other 3 cases of hyperHDL2 cholesterolemia, the cholesteryl ester transfer activity was completely deficient. Unlike its effect in the first 2 cases, probucol did not cause any change in lipid and apoprotein in the 3 patients with complete deficiency of cholesteryl ester transfer activity.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Antigenic heterogeneity was a common feature of rectal mucosa and was observed to a considerable degree in adenomas. In general, the rectal mucosa expressed only a few antigens and to a limited extent. The adenomas were more extensively stained than the rectal mucosa. The proportion of positive cells increased with the grade of dysplasia but was relatively unrelated to the histologic type. The proportion of individual antigens expressed and the number of antigens extensively expressed increased between rectal mucosa, benign adenomas, and adenomas with early invasive carcinoma. These findings support the concept of an adenoma (dysplasia)-carcinoma sequence.\r"

Both ER and PR were almost exclusively located in carcinoma cell nuclei, with heterogeneous distribution and intensity. The staining results were evaluated semiquantitatively (histoscore), based on the percentage of positively stained carcinoma cells and nuclear staining intensity. The receptor status thus determined was as follows: ER+PR+ in 50 patients, ER+PR- in 23, ER-PR- in 26, and ER-PR+ in 3 patients. There was a 79% (ER) or 70% (PR) agreement in the positivity/negativity between the immunocytochemical and steroid-binding assay (in 102 patients) with a highly significant correlation. The histoscore values increased significantly with cytosol receptor levels (ER, r = 0.623, P less than 0.001; PR, r = 0.366, P less than 0.01).\r"

Widespread lymphadenopathy and blood smears indistinguishable from those typically encountered in the acute phase of infectious mononucleosis were present in all cases. There were also varying combinations of fever, sore throat, and malaise, as well as mild abnormalities of hepatic function and elevated cold agglutinins (anti-I). Anti-HIV was detected by both enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and Western blot techniques in all cases, with increasing titers noted in two of three serially studied cases. In one patient, a dual infection with the hepatitis B virus was also documented. Diagnostic possibilities in patients with acute mononucleosis-like illnesses dominated by prominent lymphadenopathy should include primary seroconversions to HIV.\r"

The authors attacked this problem by treating serum samples with neuraminidase, then running treated and untreated samples side-by-side on specially prepared agarose gels. Each isoenzyme showed a characteristic mobility before and after neuraminidase treatment that allowed its identification. The mobility of the bone isoenzyme was most affected, whereas the intestinal isoenzyme was resistant to the action of neuraminidase. In samples with both liver and bone isoenzymes, pretreatment with neuraminidase clearly distinguished the bands, allowing quantitation by densitometry. Using this method, the authors discovered 22 liver isoenzymes in 54 samples that were interpreted as only bone isoenzyme before neuraminidase treatment. They also detected two bone isoenzymes in 35 samples that appeared to contain only liver +/- biliary isoenzymes. In addition, this procedure enabled them to characterize several unusual isoenzymes with respect to mobility, thus avoiding confusion with the other isoenzymes.\r"

The axillary lymph node dissections of 23 patients were studied by light microscopy and graded for the amount of erythrophagocytosis. None of the patients had evidence of a systemic hemolytic process. Nineteen of them exhibited some degree of erythrophagocytosis, and this was present even in four of the six patients who never had a prior breast biopsy. Breast biopsy was associated with massive degrees of erythrophagocytosis in 8 of 17 patients, and after a postbiopsy interval of two weeks 11 of 13 patients had hemosiderin deposition in the lymph nodes, evidence of red blood cell breakdown. This study serves to substantiate statements, made by others without confirmatory data, that large degrees of erythrophagocytosis may be seen in axillary lymph nodes after breast biopsies and that small amounts of erythrophagocytosis may be identified in lymph nodes of patients with no prior trauma history.\r"

Serum protein electrophoreses and IgG quantifications were performed for all three groups. Serum haptoglobin and lactate dehydrogenase (LD) isoenzyme electrophoreses were also assayed for Group 1. Of 52 patients in Group 1, 17 (33%) had an elevated serum IgG level and nonreactive eluates. Clinical history, haptoglobin, and LD isoenzyme studies did not suggest increased red blood cell destruction. Only 2 (4%) of 52 patients in Group 2 had an elevated serum IgG level. Of 50 in Group 3, 25 (50%) had a positive DAT result with nonreactive eluates and did not have hemolytic diseases. Two of 10 patients (20%) with serum IgG levels ranging from 18 to 20 g/L (1.8-2.0 g/dL), 13 of 29 (45%) with serum IgG levels from 20 to 40 g/L (2.0-4.0 g/dL), 4 of 6 (67%) with serum IgG levels from 40 to 60 g/L (4.0-6.0 g/dL), and 6 of 6 (100%) with serum IgG levels from 60 to 80 g/L (6.0-8.0 g/dL) had a positive DAT result. The authors concluded there is a significant correlation between a positive DAT result and serum IgG concentrations and that the higher the elevated serum IgG, the more frequently the positive DAT result is observed. Elevated serum IgG levels may explain many positive DAT results in pretransfusion blood samples.\r"

The proliferative features of the neural tissue in this case support the notion that neural elements may play an active role in the establishment of intimate neural-epithelial relationships. The mechanism for this phenomenon in the present case is postulated to be proliferation and ingrowth of the nerve tissue, possibly mediated by nerve growth factor or some related substance.\r"

The illness is generally discrete, and symptoms regress as the lipemia clears. The transient nature of the syndrome has allowed only speculation as to its pathogenesis. The authors report an autopsy study of a child who died during an acute episode of fat overload and document the causative role of fat sludging in the associated end-organ failure. In addition, they offer evidence that the coagulopathy, previously an enigma, results from primary fibrinolysis, possibly caused by release of tissue plasminogen activators from the damaged endothelial cells.\r"

We hypothesized that this elevation might be due in part to competition of Mg with calcium (Ca) bound to proteins or complexed to salts. Serum and its ultrafiltrate were obtained from five placental blood samples. The iCa concentration was measured in both serum and its ultrafiltrate at five incremental Mg concentrations (delta Mg) up to 6.58 mmol/L. In both serum and ultrafiltrate, incremental iCa (delta iCa) correlated significantly with delta Mg. By multiple regression analysis, delta ica in serum correlated positively with delta Mg in serum and negatively with albumin concentration in serum. Thus, iCa concentration in serum is increased in vitro by hypermagnesemia; it appears that Mg may compete with Ca bound to albumin and complexed to salts.\r"

Seventy percent of injuries involved the lower extremities. Contusions represented 35.2%, strains 27.8%, sprains 19.4%, and fractures and dislocations 2% of all reported injuries. The ankle was the most frequent site of injury in both sexes. Quadriceps strain was a common injury in boys. The boys with the highest incidence of injury were tall (greater than 165 cm) and had a weak grip (less than 25 kg), suggesting that skeletally mature but muscularly weak boys may be more susceptible to injury while playing soccer with peers of the same chronological age.\r"

The reliability of intraosseous infusion of many substances has not been established. Glucose and dopamine hydrochloride are two commonly used emergency drugs in pediatric practice that have not been carefully studied when administered into the bone marrow. In an animal model, we compared the response of an intraosseous injection of hypertonic glucose with that of an intravenous injection of hypertonic glucose. Serum glucose measurements following the injection revealed both routes of administration to be effective. A dopamine infusion was then administered through the bone marrow for 20 minutes. A statistically significant rise in blood pressure was observed two minutes after initiation of the infusion. Intraosseous infusion of hypertonic glucose and dopamine is an effective route by which to administer these medications and is potentially useful in emergency situations in which intravascular access is delayed.\r"

The positive predictive value of a low plasma fibronectin level in conjunction with leukocytosis and elevated band ratio for discriminating serious bacterial infection was 71%. Normal white blood cell counts or fibronectin level alone or in combination predicted the absence of serious bacterial infection with an accuracy of at least 94%. Plasma fibronectin determination provides a useful adjunct to the complete blood cell count for the rapid evaluation of extent of illness in young infants with possible sepsis.\r"

The objective of our study was to determine if double-lumen CVC usage increased the possibility of infectious and mechanical complications compared with that of traditional single-lumen CVCs in a population at high risk for infection (oncology patients). Thirty pediatric patients (2.5 +/- 3.0 years old; mean +/- SD) who received single-lumen CVCs were compared with 31 patients (5.9 +/- 4.7 years old) who received double-lumen CVCs. The incidence of infectious complications was compared while controlling for potential confounding variables. Fifty-seven percent (17/30) of patients in the single-lumen group experienced bacteremia or cellulitis that required removal of six catheters compared with a rate of 52% (16/31) and nine catheter removals in the double-lumen group. Fewer manipulations occurred in the single-lumen group compared with the double-lumen group, but the incidence of mechanical complications tended to be greater. When managed carefully, double-lumen CVCs were not associated with a greater risk of infection than single-lumen CVCs.\r"

Transcutaneous carbon dioxide pressure and oxygen pressure were recorded continuously overnight with episodes of hypercapnia and/or hypoxia scored for frequency, duration, and relationship to activity. Episodes occurred in 12 infants with laryngomalacia and eight control infants. Infants with laryngomalacia had significantly more episodes. The greatest decrease in transcutaneous oxygen pressure was 29 mm Hg and increase in transcutaneous carbon dioxide pressure was 31 mm Hg, both occurring in infants with laryngomalacia. Three infants had prolonged episodes of hypoxia and hypercapnia. History or physical examination did not distinguish those infants with laryngomalacia who had hypercapnia and/or hypoxia from those without episodes. Two- to 15-month follow-ups in 13 infants with laryngomalacia revealed that symptoms were unchanged or improved. Twelve of these 13 infants had normal growth without developmental delay or other complications. These results demonstrate that episodes of hypoxia and hypercapnia occur more frequently in infants with laryngomalacia than in control infants; however, their apparent risk for complications is low.\r"

Monopolar recording has been used, by us and by others, to record the basic electrical rhythm of the stomach. In an effort to improve our ability to routinely obtain a recording of the basic electrical rhythm of the stomach, using cutaneous electrodes (electrogastrography), we have investigated different electrode recording techniques, and compared them with monopolar recording. We studied 10 healthy asymptomatic volunteers who were fasting, using each of the techniques while simultaneously monitoring a monopolar electrogastrogram. Three different recording techniques were studied: a Wilson central terminal, comparing alternative placements of the reference electrodes; a Wilson central terminal with a single placement of the reference electrodes, but alternative placements of the active exploratory electrode; and, last, a differential recording technique. We found all of the studied techniques to be superior to monopolar recording in the amount of time a recognizable three/min basic electrical rhythm could be recorded. However, the differential recording arrangement yielded an improvement in percent of recording time so significant that the electrogastrographic signal could be visually discerned to greater than 80%, compared with 37%, of the monopolar recording. Thus, the differential recording technique is far superior for recording the electrogastrogram.\r"

  ".W": "Anorectal manometry was performed on 12 normal children and 18 patients suffering from constipation and soiling. In both groups, the results of the rectoanal inhibitory reflex and the squeezing anal pressure were similar. The pressure recording in all the normal children showed that the anal canal relaxed during defecation. Fourteen (78%) constipated children closed the anal canal while straining by contracting the anal sphincter. This paradoxical contraction appears to be the cause of chronic constipation. Twelve children with paradoxical anal closure were treated by biofeedback therapy. The results show that all these children were successfully conditioned to relax their anal sphincter during defecation. This therapy improved their bowel habits and relieved them from constipation and soiling. It is proposed that the paradoxical anal closure itself is the result of a self-conditioning process. In this process, the patient learns to paradoxically contract the external anal sphincter in response to the urge and the act of defecation. Biofeedback therapy seems to be the appropriate treatment in such cases.\r"

Patients with cancer of the cecum, ascending colon, and hepatic flexure had the highest percentage of benign adenomas. Patients with right-sided cancer had adenomas in 47% of resected specimens, which percentage was significantly higher than that in the group of patients with left-sided cancer, who had adenomas in 22% of their specimens (p less than 0.001). Patients with cancer and synchronous adenomas were also older (70.2 vs 67.8, p less than 0.02) and more likely to be male (p less than 0.002) than patients with cancer and no adenomas. It is suggested that efforts be made to identify adenomas preoperatively in patients with colorectal cancer. In addition, since patients with cancer and associated adenomas are at increased risk of developing metachronous cancer, the group with right-sided cancer should be part of a particularly active surveillance program.\r"

The side of the lesions ranged from the gastric body to the second portion of the duodenum, and the lesions that developed were multiple ulcers in four, and multiple erosions with white coat in nine. The development of these gastroduodenal lesions may be due to mucosal ischemia caused by embolic materials, the toxic effect of antineoplastic drugs infuse, or to stress. In light of these events, upper gastrointestinal endoscopy should be added to the usual examinations done for patients undergoing TACE.\r"

Although the histological degree of fatty infiltration was equal in the two groups, the delta Er569-650, as an index of the regional liver blood flow estimated by spectrophotometric method, was significantly lower in alcoholic fatty liver than in nonalcoholic fatty liver, and the in vivo hepatic oxygen consumption (VO2), also determined by hepatic reflectance spectrophotometry during peritoneoscopy, tended to be lower in alcoholic fatty liver than in nonalcoholic fatty liver. The oxygen saturation of hemoglobin in local liver blood (SO2) was, however, significantly higher in alcoholic fatty liver than in nonalcoholic fatty liver. These results suggest that an increase in oxygen extraction to maintain oxygen consumption, which was indicated by the lowering of the SO2, was not found in alcoholic fatty liver, in spite of a reduction of oxygen supply to the liver. It is concluded that the impairment of hepatic circulation and hepatic oxygen consumption was more serious in alcoholic fatty liver than in nonalcoholic fatty liver, possibly contributing to a different prognosis for the two forms of fatty liver.\r"

Venous concentrations of propionate and acetate were measured for 90 min after administration of the enteral dose by gas-liquid chromatography. In patients with liver cirrhosis, propionate rose from a basal value of 6.1 +/- 4.7 (SD) microM to a peak concentration of 50.1 +/- 25.6 microM, whereas, in controls, it rose only from 1.4 +/- 1.6 to 10.3 +/- 7.6 microM. The oral propionate clearance was significantly lower in patients with cirrhosis (4.51 +/- 1.63 L/min) than in controls (118.47 +/- 154.79 L/min). Acetate went up from 39.5 +/- 16.3 to 134.1 +/- 62.7 microM in patients with cirrhosis and from 60.9 +/- 19.0 to 102.0 +/- 44.0 microM in controls. The oral acetate clearance was lower in patients with liver cirrhosis (2.80 +/- 2.17 L/min) than in control persons (10.86 +2- 5.72 L/min). The differences between the groups were more striking for propionate than for acetate values. It is concluded that the systemic availability of propionate and acetate is higher in patients with liver cirrhosis than in controls. This may be due to portosystemic shunting and/or diminished hepatic and extrahepatic extraction of the acids.\r"

The lowest risk of premature birth was found when maternal hematocrit was between 41% and 44%. Statistically increases in prematurity were noted at all hematocrit levels of less than or equal to 38%. A woman with a hematocrit of 37% had twice the risk of having a premature birth as a woman whose hematocrit was between 41% and 44% (p less than 0.01). In a logistic regression analysis with premature birth as the dependent variable and hematocrit as the only predictor variable, it was noted that decreasing the hematocrit by a single point was associated with a 24% increase in the risk of prematurity (odds ratio = 1.24) while a five-point decrease in hematocrit was associated with a tripling in the risk of prematurity (odds ratio = 2.98). In a multivariable logistic regression analysis hematocrit was noted to explain more of the variation in prematurity than any of the other risk factors included in the model. An investigation of this association in specific groups at high risk of having premature births revealed that 46% of the increased risk of prematurity in black women and 49% of the increased risk of prematurity in women receiving welfare was related to hematocrit or some factor associated with hematocrit.\r"

  ".W": "Gram stain examination of amniotic fluid is a method used for the rapid diagnosis of intraamniotic infection in patients with preterm premature rupture of membranes and preterm labor. The management of these patients relies heavily on the Gram stain results. Therefore, it is critical that the diagnostic value and limitations, optimal technique, and outcome correlates be precisely established. Most studies have focused on culture results rather than on Gram stain results to describe neonatal and maternal outcome. However, management is based on the Gram stain because culture results are not immediately available. One hundred eighty-seven amniocenteses were performed in 131 patients with preterm premature rupture of the membranes (n = 90) and preterm labor (n = 41). Spun and unspun Gram stains were performed. Centrifugation of the sample did not improve the sensitivity of the technique significantly. The agreement between the two methods was substantial (kappa index 0.89, p less than 0.001). The sensitivity of the Gram stain was 44.8% and the specificity was 97.6%. The sensitivity of the Gram stain was directly proportional to the number of bacteria present in amniotic fluid. In the presence of greater than 10(5) colony forming units per milliliter, 80% of the Gram stains were positive. The absence of both bacteria and white blood cells in a smear was associated with a negative culture of amniotic fluid in 95% of the cases. Clinical chorioamnionitis was associated with a positive Gram stain of amniotic fluid (p less than 0.001). There was a trend toward a higher incidence of endometritis in patients with a positive Gram stain compared with those with a negative Gram stain (p = 0.07). There was no neonatal infectious morbidity in patients with a true negative Gram stain. Patients with a false negative Gram stain had a 25% incidence of neonatal infectious complications (proved and suspected sepsis).\r"

Clinical signs of acute chorioamnionitis occur relatively late, and laboratory tests for acute chorioamnionitis lack the desired sensitivity and specificity. Early antibiotic treatment may have important neonatal implications. The leukocyte esterase test is both rapid and simple. Because of the specificity (100%) and sensitivity (81%) of the test in predicting bacterial colonization of the amniotic fluid, we conclude that it has the potential to become an invaluable tool in assessing the intrauterine environment.\r"

Although abnormalities of the four-chamber screening examination of the fetal heart identifies structural anomalies associated with semilunar and atrioventricular valve hypoplasias, the anomalies associated with tetralogy of Fallot are not as readily identifiable from the four-chamber view alone. This study was designed to determine whether aortic root dilatation, commonly observed in the newborn with tetralogy of Fallot, is a marker for tetralogy of Fallot diagnosed in utero. In 45 normal (control) fetuses the biparietal diameter, head circumference, abdominal circumference, and femur length were measured and M-mode measurements were made of the biventricular outer dimension and aortic root dimension. The aortic root dimension from seven fetuses (18, 19, 20, 23, 32, 33, and 34 weeks' gestation) with tetralogy of Fallot was increased in dimension when compared with cardiac (biventricular outer dimension) and noncardiac biparietal diameter, head and abdomen circumferences, and femur length parameters. In conclusion, incorporation of aortic root imaging with the four-chamber view of the fetal heart during a routine screening examination allows for identification of fetuses with tetralogy of Fallot.\r"

Ninety women undergoing surgery for the first time because of genuine stress incontinence were studied. A full clinical examination including simultaneous urethrocystometry according to a standardized methodology with the patients in the supine, sitting, and standing positions was performed preoperatively, 3 months postoperatively, and again 1 to 2 years later. Clinical follow-up continued for 5 to 7 years. Neither surgical anterior vaginal repair nor Burch colposuspension affected the resting variables of the urethral sphincter mechanism. After Burch colposuspension the transmitted intraabdominal pressure to the urethra significantly increased in all recording positions in all women who were successfully treated. After successful anterior colporrhaphy, the increase in pressure transmission from the abdomen to the urethra was less prominent and was only present in the sitting and standing positions. The postural changes in the urethral pressure profile characteristic of stress urinary incontinence were still present even after successful restoration of continence. The impact of successful surgery for stress incontinence is the enhancement of transmission of the intraabdominal pressure rise to the proximal urethra. This is achieved primarily by anatomic alterations rather than by altering urethral sphincter function. Burch colposuspension was more effective for the correction of genuine stress incontinence than was anterior vaginal repair.\r"

The symptom of stress incontinence, moderate to severe cystocele, and Q-tip cotton swab test result greater than or equal to 30 degrees were more common in women with genuine stress incontinence. Of the other urologic symptoms, only sensory urgency and enuresis were significantly associated with overactive detrusor function and voiding disorders. The combined findings of stress incontinence, cystocele, and no sensory urgency correctly identified 22% of women with genuine stress incontinence and eliminated 96% of women with other urologic disorders. Stress incontinence, moderate to severe cystocele, and no sensory urgency had a positive predictive value of 100%, but a sensitivity of only 10%. When used in series, the Q-tip cotton swab test contributed no additional information to that found by history taking and physical examination.\r"

The first 17 procedures were performed by use of the dragging technique; the last 45 procedures were performed with a blanching technique. Both procedures were performed at the same institution and by the same surgeon. Sixty-five percent of patients undergoing the blanching technique became amenorrheic after the procedure versus 12% of those undergoing the dragging technique. Moreover, the blanching technique required less time, fewer joules of energy, and resulted in less fluid absorption by the patient. The blanching technique is apparently more effective, easier to accomplish, and safer for the patient than the dragging technique.\r"

Each of the 26 patients was paired with a primiparous woman by year delivered, age, race (black versus nonblack), and weight +/- 1/3. In 23 pairs blood pressure follow-up was available in 1980 or thereafter, which was at least 3 1/2 years after delivery (average interval between delivery and follow-up = 10 years). Three in the preeclampsia group and two in the matched control group had hypertension, with diastolic blood pressure greater than or equal to 90 mm Hg. Mean systolic blood pressure (123.7 mm Hg) was 9.3 mm Hg higher in the preeclampsia group than in the matched controls (114.4 mm Hg), with a standard error of 4.15 mm Hg (p = 0.04). Mean diastolic blood pressure (77.0 mm Hg) was 2.9 mm Hg higher in the preeclampsia group than in the controls (74.1 mm Hg), with a standard error of 3.0 mm Hg (p = 0.345). We conclude that no significant difference in frequency of hypertension or diastolic blood pressure and a small but significant difference in systolic blood pressure is shown in follow-up between patients with preeclampsia and matched controls.\r"

Blood was drawn from 1034 consecutive women on their second postpartum day and tested for antimicrosomal and antithyroglobulin antibodies by hemagglutination. Seventy-two women (7.0%) were seropositive for antimicrosomal antibodies, but only seven (0.7%) had antithyroglobulin antibodies. There was a significant difference in the racial prevalence of antimicrosomal antibodies, with seropositivity in 52 of 588 white women (8.8%) versus nine of 367 black women (2.5%; p less than 0.001). Thirty-four of 51 (67%) antimicrosomal seropositive women followed at least 6 months post partum developed biochemical thyroid dysfunction and 20 of these patients required treatment for hypothyroidism. The mean (+/- SEM) serum thyroxine and thyrotropin levels in these patients before treatment were 3.0 +/- 0.3 micrograms/dl (normal 6.1 to 12.3 micrograms/dl) and 77 +/- 17 mU/L (normal 0.3 to 4.0 mU/L), respectively. Psychologic interviews revealed a significant increase in impaired concentration, carelessness, depression, and total complaints when patients with postpartum hypothyroidism were compared with postpartum euthyroid women. Medical evidence now suggests that postpartum thyroiditis is a common event and causes significant symptoms in women who develop hypothyroidism. Therefore, we propose that serum antimicrosomal antibody testing of postpartum women provides a feasible cost-effective screening method of identifying women likely to suffer from this disease.\r"

Sound transmission decreased dramatically with increasing distance between the sound source and the hydrophone; this may account for some of the variability in fetal response when the sound test is used clinically. Caution is recommended in administering the sound test until the effects of high noise levels on the fetus are better understood.\r"

Among control animals, between 133 days and 160 days there were significant increases in adrenal size (p less than 0.05) and in amniotic fluid 13,14-Dihydro-15-keto-prostaglandin F2a metabolite, (p less than 0.005), estrone, and progesterone concentrations (p less than 0.05). The increase in adrenal size and the rise in amniotic fluid 13,14-Dihydro-15-keto-prostaglandin F2a metabolite, did not occur in betamethasone-treated monkeys. Maternal serum estradiol levels were suppressed immediately after treatment with betamethasone but recovered to control levels by day 160. Other changes in maternal serum and amniotic fluid sex steroid levels were sought but not observed. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that glucocorticoids delay primate parturition by altering intrauterine prostaglandin F2 alpha metabolism.\r"

RU 486 achieved a gradient equilibrium between the maternal and fetal-placental circulation within 5 minutes, suggesting free passage by simple diffusion. The clearance kinetics of immunoreactive RU 486 are consistent with an open three-compartment system in mother and fetus.

The geometric mean of the immunoreactive substance P concentration was 0.55 pg/mg wet weight (95% confidence limits 0.04 and 6.15). Thecal and stromal concentrations of immunoreactive substance P were greater than those in the corpora lutea and tunica albuginea.

We therefore compared peripheral and cardiac responses to alpha-agonists in pregnant (n = 6) and nonpregnant (n = 6) sheep, measuring mean arterial pressure, heart rate, and cardiac output before and during steady-state dose responses to norepinephrine (0.458 to 45.84 micrograms/min) and phenylephrine (1.29 to 129 micrograms/min). Both alpha-agonists caused dose-dependent increases in mean arterial pressure and systemic vascular resistance, more so in nonpregnant than pregnant sheep (p less than 0.01), and decreases in cardiac output and heart rate (p less than 0.01). In both nonpregnant and pregnant sheep the percent change in systemic vascular resistance generally exceeded the percent change in mean arterial pressure, reflecting decreases in cardiac output; however, at equivalent increases in percent change in mean arterial pressure and percent change in systemic vascular resistance, the fall in the percent change in cardiac output was greatest in pregnant sheep (p less than 0.05). Also, at similar increases in mean arterial pressure the percent change in heart rate was greatest in pregnant sheep (p less than 0.01). In contrast to angiotensin II, the attenuated pressor responses to alpha-agonists observed during ovine pregnancy are partly a result of reflex decreases in cardiac output mediated mainly through falls in heart rate.\r"

The patients' disorders consisted of vaginal pruritis, burning, a white discharge, and painful coitus. Vaginal pH in each case was 4.5. Microscopic examination of wet mounts of vaginal secretion had no clue cells and no organisms other than lactobacillus. One culture was positive for Candida albicans; however, successful treatment of the C. albicans vaginitis did not eliminate the patient's symptoms. Semen samples from the patients' partners were negative for C. albicans. One of the seminal fluids had highly elevated concentrations of total IgE. The other two semen samples contained IgE antibodies that were reactive with a particulate fraction of vaginal fluids obtained from their wives. In contrast, vaginal fluids from the patients were all negative for IgE antibodies to their partner's semen. Use of a condom during coitus ended the recurring cycles of vaginitis in all three women. Vaginitis may be induced by an allergic reaction initiated by the transfer from men to women during coitus of IgE antibodies reactive either to antigens of the female genital tract or components of semen. Men allergic to female vaginal secretions, to vaginal microbes or their products, or to semen represent a previously unrecognized noninfectious vector for this disorder.\r"

The most important obstetric problem is to determine which fetuses are well in utero and which are at risk of irreversible damage or severe and prolonged neonatal morbidity. The optimal timing of delivery is at present made by subjective assessment of clinical variables. We present hematologic and biochemical values obtained by fetal blood sampling of 24 idiopathic fetuses with intrauterine growth retardation to give objective information on which to base clinical management. The results show that there is stimulation of erythropoiesis as well as evidence of red blood cell destruction and liver damage. In many cases there is acute decompensation with acid base abnormalities in a setting of chronic hematologic and biochemical changes.\r"

At steady state the diffusion rate of the lipid-soluble propranolol, timolol, and labetalol was three to four times higher than that of the hydrophilic atenolol and celiprolol. Albumin binding had no significant effect on diffusion when equal concentrations were used in the two perfusion circuits. With increased albumin concentration on the fetal side an acceleration of the diffusion of propranolol could be shown. Propranolol and labetalol showed considerable binding to placental tissue. After bolus injection transfer was clearly suppressed, as a result of tissue binding, and there was a delay until a steady state of diffusion was reached when constant concentrations were maintained in the maternal compartment. With recirculation of the fetal and maternal compartments propranolol rapidly equilibrated in the two perfusion circuits at 35% of the initial level in the maternal circuit. Atenolol after 4 hours of recirculation had not reached full equilibration between the two compartments, and the fetal concentration was at 55% of the initial level on the maternal side.\r"

All cases were live-births without intrauterine growth retardation. Associated clinical features were pregnancy-induced hypertension, nuchal cord at delivery, and postterm gestation. One infant had severe perinatal asphyxia with long-term psychomotor retardation. In the placenta, hemorrhagic endovasculitis was associated with infarction, fetal vessel thrombosis, and villitis of unknown cause. Interference with umbilical blood flow or regional compromise of villous perfusion may be an initiating event in the development of this lesion.\r"

A retrospective review of vulvar melanoma was undertaken to determine if mode of therapy affected recurrence. Survival correlated independently with depth of invasion and age (p = 0.05 and p less than 0.02, respectively). In the comparison of radical vulvectomy with local excision, no patient differences in age or histopathologic variables were determined (nodal disease status, histology, mitotic count, lymphocytic infiltration, or ulceration). Radical vulvectomy did not improve survival over local therapy (p greater than 0.2). Six of eight patients whose melanoma had less than 2 mm of invasion treated with local therapy are disease free after a median of 127 months (range 6 to 300 months). For local excision, recurrences were more frequent when margins were less than 2 cm, but this was not statistically significant in this small sample. Although the current series is small and retrospective, its findings suggest that treatment recommendations of large cutaneous nonvulvar melanoma studies are applicable to vulvar melanoma. A prospective randomized study of radical versus conservative surgery for vulvar melanoma will be necessary to confirm these treatment recommendations.\r"

Throughout pregnancy there was a significant increase in maternal blood pressure (p less than 0.001) and proteinuria (p less than 0.0001), with nephrotic syndrome (greater than 3.0 gm protein/day) developing in 71% of pregnancies. After birth, however, proteinuria reverted to levels not significantly different from values in early pregnancy. There was no apparent adverse effect of pregnancy on the natural course of the underlying renal disease. Stillbirths occurred in two patients (6%), and the remaining 29 pregnancies resulted in live-births at a mean gestational age of 36 weeks. Seventy percent of these infants were appropriate for gestational age, whereas 16% were small and 13% were large for gestational age. Birth weight was best correlated with gestational age and creatinine clearance (p less than 0.0001). Neonatal complications included respiratory distress syndrome (19%), hyperbilirubinemia (26), and congenital malformations (10%). The uncorrected perinatal survival rate was 94%. These data suggest that with contemporary methods of maternal evaluation and treatment, fetal surveillance, and neonatal care, the risks to patients with diabetic nephropathy during pregnancy are not excessive. The likelihood of a successful fetal and neonatal outcome is comparable to that in other patients with insulin-dependent diabetes.\r"

Eighty-five percent of women with gestational diabetes had peak serum fructosamine levels above the normal range. If maternal levels exceeded 3.2 mmol/L, there was an 88% chance of abnormal glucose tolerance post partum. Our aim of management was a serum fructosamine level less than 2.5 mmol/L; patients who achieved this goal by 35 to 37 weeks' gestation had fewer obese babies with lower cord insulin and C-peptide levels as compared with neonates of mothers with elevated fructosamine concentrations.\r"

These antibodies showed specificity toward ovarian epithelial cancer when tested against ovarian tumor cell lines and paraffin-embedded tissue sections of ovarian cancer. The antigens in sera of patients were separated from IgG and IgG complexes by affinity chromatography and the free antigens were isolated. With the antibodies purified from ascitic fluid, the levels of tumor-associated antigens in sera of 10 patients with serous cystadenocarcinoma and 12 control patients were detected by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The antigens in patients with ovarian epithelial cancer were 2 to 10 times higher than those in control patients.

  ".W": "The long-range goal of our research is to determine whether the presence of bioactive agents of infection in amniotic fluid may serve as sensitive indexes of the existence of infection as the cause of preterm labor in a given pregnancy. The aim of this study was to explore the possibility that bacterial endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide) could be detected and quantified in amniotic fluid. In particular, we sought to ascertain (1) if amniotic fluid could be collected in a manner to prevent endotoxin contamination, (2) whether there were inhibitors of lipopolysaccharide in amniotic fluid, and (3) if Limulus amebocyte lysate-based assays could be used to identify and quantify lipopolysaccharide in this fluid. We found that the Limulus amebocyte lysate assays (gelation assay and chromophore generation assay) were useful in the qualitative and quantitative analysis of lipopolysaccharide in amniotic fluids. Lipopolysaccharide-mediated generation of chromophore in the presence of amniotic fluid was accelerated strikingly compared with that of lipopolysaccharide in endotoxin-free water. In three amniotic fluid samples obtained during preterm labor, lipopolysaccharide was detectable in aliquots of 1 to 10 microliters by use of the gelation assay and lipopolysaccharide was quantifiable by use of chromophore generation assays. Two of these amniotic fluid samples were sterile as determined by bacteriologic examination; in the third sample, Fusobacterium species was identified. We suggest that these assays may be extremely useful in the identification of lipopolysaccharide in amniotic fluid. Indeed, lipopolysaccharide may serve as one marker of infection useful in establishing the cause of preterm labor.\r"

Initial visual acuities ranged from 20/20 to hand motions (median, counting fingers). All patients showed rapid improvement after starting oral corticosteroid therapy, and all but one of the six affected eyes regained a visual acuity of 20/20. The clinical appearance and course of these patients matched those of a condition previously described in Japan and labeled frosted branch angiitis.

As diplopia may occur from botulinum toxin injections for blepharospasm, most commonly from injection of the lower eyelid, and surgical relief of blepharospasm is often achieved by excision of only the upper eyelid protractors, omission of toxin from the lower eyelid seemed both desirable and possible. All patients received botulinum toxin in the upper eyelids, above the eyebrows, across the glabella, and near the lateral canthus. Thirteen of 15 patients who received saline in their lower eyelids had relief of spasm, with the same spasm-free interval as those who received toxin. We recommend avoiding injection of toxin in the medial two thirds of the lower eyelid in order to diminish the likelihood of diplopia from inferior oblique muscle paresis.\r"

As expected, the characteristic air space fibrosis was composed of spindled fibroblasts and myofibroblasts arranged concentrically within an electron-lucent stroma. In 6 patients there was evidence of incorporation of air space fibrosis into the interstitium. A surprising finding in all patients was the presence of extensive epithelial damage involving peribronchiolar alveolar septa. Necrosis and sloughing of alveolar lining cells resulted in denuding of epithelial basal laminae. Complex infoldings and deep invaginations of the denuded basal laminae into alveolar septa were common. These ultrastructural changes involving the interstitium are similar to those occurring in the interstitial pneumonias, and suggest that BOOP also results from acute epithelial injury. The different clinical manifestations and prognosis of these entities may relate to the peribronchiolar localization of the epithelial damage in BOOP compared with more diffuse involvement of distal lung in the interstitial pneumonias.\r"

  ".W": "A variety of heavy metals are recognized as environmental pollutants, and although a significant body of literature exists on the acute toxicity of these metals in various tissues, little is known about the effects of metals such as mercury on host defense. Therefore, the effect of mercuric chloride (HgCl2) on human polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) function in vitro was evaluated. The acute toxicity of HgCl2 for human PMN was calculated initially using vital dye exclusion (trypan blue), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release. Concentrations of HgCl2 less than or equal to 10(-6) M did not induce significant LDH release, or uptake of trypan blue. Additionally, HgCl2 at less than or equal to 10(-7) M produced no ultrastructural alterations in the PMN. The effects of HgCl2 on human PMN functions involved in host defense were evaluated next. HgCl2 consistently suppressed human PMN adherence, polarization, chemotaxis, and erythrophagocytosis at concentrations between 10(-6) and 10(-17) M. Because of the established role of oxygen metabolites in host defense, the effects of HgCl2 on human PMN chemiluminescence and H2O2 production were evaluated next. These studies demonstrated that low concentrations of HgCl2 (ie, 10(-9)-10(-15) M) significantly enhanced chemiluminescence, as well as stimulated H2O2 production by the PMN. These studies clearly demonstrate the ability of extremely low levels of HgCl2 not only to suppress various PMN functions involved in host defense, but also to stimulate oxygen metabolism. In vivo, these HgCl2 effects would not only compromise host defense but also promote tissue injury via the local production of oxygen metabolites.\r"

Accurate histologic preoperative prediction of the presence of regional lymph node metastases is not possible at this time. A retrospective quantitative pathologic analysis was performed to investigate the possibility of predicting the presence or absence of regional lymph node metastases in 24 patients with bronchopulmonary carcinoid tumors. The results of univariate analysis showed that large tumor size was associated significantly more frequently with regional lymph node metastases than small tumor size (P less than 0.01). The other quantitative features, ie, a larger mean nuclear area, higher standard deviation of the nuclear area and the presence of an aneuploid DNA index, were frequently associated with regional lymph node metastases, but this tendency was not significant. In multivariate analysis the combination of tumor size and mean nuclear area predicted the presence or absence of regional lymph node metastases correctly in 80 and 94% of the cases, respectively. These results indicate that the combination of tumor size and mean nuclear area may serve as a guideline to predict the presence of regional lymph node metastases.\r"

The tissues investigated included cytospins of ten cell lines derived from patients with SCLC, four corresponding nude mouse xenografts from cell lines, and metastatic tumor tissue obtained by surgical biopsy and at autopsy. The probes were prepared as 35S labeled complementary RNA. The expression of each gene was demonstrated specifically by autoradiography in the cytoplasm of the neoplastic cell samples. The average levels of oncogene expression in each specimen corroborated previous data obtained by Northern blot assays. In addition, heterogeneity in gene expression from cell to cell in each sample was noted. This study represents the first attempt to demonstrate oncogene expression in lung cancer cell lines and tissues in situ, and confirms that the expression of these myc related genes can be seen in the primary tumor. The technique of RNA-RNA tissue in situ hybridization has great potential in answering fundamental questions of tumor cell heterogeneity and progression in SCLC. It should be useful in both prospective and retrospective studies.\r"

Patients with a diploid thyroid or parathyroid adenoma had a lower mean age at diagnosis than patients with a nondiploid adenoma. None of the adenomas gave rise to metastases after conservative surgery.

Unfractionated and density-defined alveolar macrophages were then characterized as to their ability to migrate towards F-Met-Leu-Phen and zymosan-activated serum. Alveolar macrophages of density 1.083-1.097 gm/ml were found to have the greatest migrational movement toward F-Met-Leu-Phen, which was higher than the unfractionated population. In contrast, 2 peaks in alveolar macrophage subpopulations migrational movement towards zymosan-activated serum were noted that were lower than the unfractionated population. These results demonstrated that alveolar macrophages are heterogeneous in their migrational ability towards the chemotactic stimuli F-Met-Leu-Phen and zymosan-activated serum and that there may be a cooperative interaction between the subpopulations that affects macrophage migrational ability.\r"

For elucidation of the role of extracellular matrix-driven cell size changes in the modulation of endothelial cell proliferation and sheet migration an in vitro model system was used that allows for the culture of bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAEC) on various purified extracellular matrix components. BAEC exhibited distinct patterns in rates of attachment, spreading, migration, and proliferation when cultured on the selected extracellular matrix components laminin, types I and III collagen, type IV collagen, and fibronectin. In addition, there was a correlation between cell and nuclear size (on the various matrices tested) and rates of cell attachment and spreading. In contrast, an inverse correlation was noted between cell and nuclear size (on the various matrices tested) and proliferation and sheet migration. These data demonstrate that endothelial cells respond to matrix components in specific but complex fashions, mediated, in part, by changes in cell and nuclear size.\r"

Thus, LLC tumor cells that were PNA+ SBA+ had metastatic potential, but with no organ-specific preference.

  ".W": "To determine the relationship among endothelial cell (EC) retraction, cell adenosine triphosphate (ATP), and the status of cellular actin, ATP levels, F-actin content, and cytochemical redistribution in bovine pulmonary artery endothelial cells were assessed. EC monolayers 7 days after confluence were exposed to ethchlorvynol (ECV), histamine, or cytochalasin B (cyto B) for time intervals from 5-90 minutes. All 3 agents resulted in endothelial cell retraction without significant effect on cellular ATP content. Sixty-minute incubation of monolayers in glucose-free media containing antimycin A and 2-deoxyglucose depleted cellular ATP to less than 10% of control levels. ATP depleted monolayers failed to retract when incubated with ECV, histamine, or cyto B. ATP depletion resulted in loss of the prominent EC margins but only a rare gap between adjacent cells. When ATP levels were allowed to recover, the ability of EC monolayers to retract was restored. Actin filaments in control monolayers localized to a dense peripheral band of actin, a paranuclear complex, and bundles of microfilaments orientated parallel to the long axis of the cell. ECV induced complete loss of the dense peripheral band and other changes in the actin disposition. Monolayers exposed to histamine showed a retraction of the dense peripheral band of actin to a subcortical position. Cyto B caused loss of the dense peripheral band and the longitudinal microfilament bundles. Monolayers depleted of ATP lost their dense peripheral band and exhibited a disorganized, tangled web of microfilaments. Neither histamine nor ECV modified the actin distribution in ATP-depleted monolayers, whereas exposure to cyto B resulted in substantial change in actin with formation of a rim inside the cell membrane and considerable loss of actin filaments. ECV or histamine induced a small reduction in F-actin content while cyto B resulted in a 50% decline in 15 minutes. ATP depletion resulted in a 19% decrease in F-actin, with no further reduction on subsequent exposure to histamine or ECV. Cyto B treatment of ATP-depleted monolayers caused a drop in F-actin content equivalent to that observed in cells with normal ATP levels. These studies indicate that ATP is essential for changes in actin filament distribution and endothelial cell retraction produced by ECV, histamine or cyto B, and make it unlikely that any of these agents acts simply by depolymerization of actin filaments or modification of the dense peripheral band, although disruption of the dense peripheral band may facilitate retraction in the presence of adequate levels of cell ATP.\r"

  ".W": "Macroscopic nodules composed of regenerating intestinal epithelium were developed within an area of the murine jejunum ulcerated by X-irradiation (1700 rads). The authors investigated whether such intestinal nodules were clonal and whether this method was useful as a tool for studying differentiation of intestinal stem cells. For examination of the clonality, intestinal nodules were produced in the jejunum of (C57BL/6 X DS)F1-Pgk-1b/Pgk-1a mice that carried X-chromosome inactivation mosaicism for the phosphoglycerate kinase gene. All intestinal nodules contained only 1 type of phosphoglycerate kinase, suggesting the monoclonal origin of nodules. Histochemical and electron microscopic studies showed the presence of absorptive epithelial, goblet, and entero-endocrine cells in most intestinal nodules, suggesting the multipotentiality of the nodule-forming stem cells. Moreover, villi developed on the top of some intestinal nodules, implicating the potential of the multipotential stem cell to construct the highly organized structure. The result indicates that the intestinal nodule method is useful for investigating differentiation potentials of multipotential intestinal stem cells.\r"

Rhodamine-phalloidin staining of actin filaments demonstrated that hyperoxia was associated with a progressive alteration in the actin distribution. Three days after oxygen exposure, the number and thickness of cytoplasmic stress fibers were increased, while the peripheral bands were disrupted or absent. Sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis revealed that the amount of filamentous actin was increased in oxygen-exposed cells, while the total actin content remained unchanged, suggesting that oxygen exposure shifted the equilibrium from G actin to F actin.\r"

  ".W": "Eight pairs of young adult rats were pair-fed a high fat-low protein diet and ethanol or isocaloric glucose by permanent intragastric cannula for up to 6 months. Biopsies of the liver were taken monthly and the fibrosis was quantitated morphometrically using the sirius red polarization method of collagen visualization by light microscopy. Morphometric analysis of the sinusoids and scars were performed on electron micrographs made from the liver biopsies. An increase in the collagen in both the central and portal areas was found when the livers of the alcohol-fed rats were compared with controls. The predominant cell in the scars was the Ito cell. An increase in the percentage of the total Ito cell square area made up of rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER) was noted when the sinusoids of the liver of the ethanol-fed rats were compared with controls. No difference in the RER was found when the sinusoidal Ito cells were compared with the Ito cells located within the scars of the ethanol-fed rats. It was concluded that Ito cell \"activation\" by chronic ethanol feeding in the sinusoids of rats accurately predicts \"activation\" of the Ito cells within scars. The Ito cells are diffusely activated even though the scarring is localized. This implies that local factors as well as Ito cell activation are necessary for scar formation. In the case of alcoholic liver disease, scar formation may be initiated by centrilobular necrosis.\r"

The marked differences between these two treatment forms raise many conceptual and methodological problems for the investigator. In a two-part series, the authors discuss a number of these conceptual issues and their implications for research design, implementation, and interpretation of findings. Part I focuses on differences in the active ingredients and hypothesized mechanisms of change of psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy. Issues addressed include the need for standardization of treatments, adequate delivery of treatments, and controlling for factors other than the active ingredients of each treatment.\r"

The higher S2 serotonin receptor binding occurred in uninjured regions of the right parietal and temporal cortex. The ratio of binding in the ipsilateral to contralateral cortex showed a significant negative correlation with severity of depression scores in the left temporal cortex. These findings suggest that the biochemical response of the brain may be different depending on which hemisphere is injured and that some depressions may be a consequence of the failure to upregulate serotonin receptors after stroke.\r"

The method of colon wound management and infectious complications thought to be secondary to the colon wound were reviewed. These patients were admitted to the trauma service and underwent exploratory laparotomy for their injuries. The penetrating abdominal trauma index, as well as other risk factors, were evaluated for their efficacy in predicting potential complications associated with the colon wound. Sixty-four percent of patients were managed by primary closure, 27 percent by end colostomy or end ileostomy, and 9 percent by exteriorization of the injury. The complication rates for these categories were 18, 42, and 40 percent, respectively. There were no significant differences in complications in terms of location and mode of injury. This review confirms that the presence of shock, transfusion (4 or more units), significant contamination, and associated injuries (evaluated by the penetrating abdominal trauma index) contribute to the development of complications. There were no disruptions of the suture line in the primary closure group. We believe that infections and septic complications are secondary to the original injury to the colon and not related to the method of repair. Primary repair of all colon wounds not requiring resection may be feasible. Prospective evaluation of that approach is indicated.\r"

Transient palliation was obtained in four patients who underwent partial excision (three patients) and radical radiotherapy (one patient). Two patients remained free of disease at last follow-up more than 4 years after gross total tumor resection and radical radiotherapy and were presumably cured. One patient treated by partial resection and radical radiotherapy died from other causes 17 months later. His disease status was unknown. Complete excision with postoperative radiotherapy may be curative, and debulking followed by external irradiation may provide short-term palliation. Patients with unresectable tumors are best managed by supportive measures only unless a truly effective chemotherapeutic regimen is developed for squamous cell cancer of the head and neck.\r"

Phospholipase A2 activity was compared with amylase activity in the plasma. Three hundred eighty-four male Wistar rats were randomized into eight groups receiving different diets with either 15 percent (volume for volume) ethanol or tap water for 12 weeks. Thereafter, all groups were subdivided into control (intact) and pancreatitis subgroups. Pancreatitis was induced by retrograde bile infusion into the pancreatic ducts. Sampling was performed 24 hours after induction in the surviving rats. Ethanol ingestion alone and in combination with the fat-rich diet increased the mortality rate (p less than 0.05), whereas the lowest mortality rate was observed in the carbohydrate-rich diet and water and the carbohydrate-rich diet and ethanol groups. Plasma phospholipase A2 activity increased in most of the groups, but it correlated with the mortality rate in the standard diet group only. Plasma amylase activity increased significantly in all groups, but did not correlate with mortality rate. Plasma phospholipase A2 activity seems to be dependent on diet in experimental acute pancreatitis in rats. Plasma amylase activity may be less affected by the dietary composition, but the lack of a correlation with mortality makes it unreliable as a parameter of severity in experimental acute pancreatitis.\r"

When 5-fluorouracil was employed, it produced a remarkably high drug concentration in the rectum and regional lymph nodes. 5-fluorouracil suppository alone did not increase the 5 year postoperative survival rate. Preoperative irradiation combined with 5-fluorouracil suppository (combined treatment group) produced shrinkage of tumor size in 18 of 23 patients, including tumor disappearance in 2 patients, whereas irradiation alone produced shrinkage of tumor size in 13 of 24 patients. Cancer invasions to the external wall of the rectum and lymph node metastases, which were the most influential factors on local rectal recurrence postoperatively, were significantly reduced by preoperative combined treatment.\r"

  ".W": "The purpose of this study was to investigate whether regression of sensory analgesia during constant epidural bupivacaine infusion was different in postoperative patients with acute pain than in patients with chronic nonsurgical pain. Sensory levels of analgesia (to pinprick) and pain (on a five-point scale) were assessed hourly for 16 hours during continuous epidural infusion of 0.5% plain bupivacaine (8 ml/hr) in 12 patients with chronic nonsurgical pain and in 30 patients after major abdominal surgery performed under combined bupivacaine and halothane--N2O general anesthesia. No opiates were given. If sensory analgesia decreased more than five segments from the initial level or if the pain score reached 2 (moderate pain), the patient was removed from the study. Initial levels of sensory analgesia after loading doses of 21.8 +/- 0.5 and 19.3 +/- 0.8 ml bupivacaine 0.5% were similar (T3.8 +/- 0.3 and T3.8 +/- 0.5) in the surgical and chronic pain patients, respectively (mean +/- SEM). Of the surgical patients, only 4 of the 30 (13%) maintained the initial level of sensory analgesia, and a pain score below 2 throughout the study compared with 7 of the 12 patients with chronic pain (58%) (P less than 0.01). Mean duration of sensory blockade was significantly longer (P less than 0.005) in the patients with chronic pain than in surgical patients (13.1 +/- 1.2 and 8.5 +/- 0.7 hours, respectively). Thus, surgical injury hastens regression of sensory analgesia during continuous epidural bupivacaine infusion. The underlying mechanism remains to be determined.\r"

  ".W": "The influence of volatile anesthetics on ventricular repolarization in vivo (QT interval) has not been studied in a systematic fashion. The purpose of this investigation was to characterize the electrocardiographic and hemodynamic actions of the volatile anesthetics halothane, isoflurane, and enflurane in chronically instrumented dogs. Because autonomic nervous system tone may influence ECG findings, experiments were completed with and without concomitant pharmacologic autonomic nervous system blockade. In six groups comprising 50 experiments with 21 instrumented dogs, anesthesia was mask-induced with nitrous oxide, oxygen, and one of the volatile anesthetics and maintained with the volatile anesthetic in 100% oxygen for 2 hours. Changes in the ECG and in hemodynamics were compared to the conscious state. In the absence of autonomic nervous system blockade, halothane and isoflurane significantly prolonged the QT interval (0.24 +/- 0.01 to 0.30 +/- 0.01 second and 0.22 +/- 0.01 to 0.28 +/- 0.01 second, respectively), whereas enflurane produced no change in ventricular repolarization (0.24 +/- 0.01 to 0.26 +/- 0.01 second). All of the volatile anesthetics increased the QT interval corrected for changes in basal heart rate (QTc), and all agents decreased intravascular pressure and dP/dt. Following autonomic nervous system blockade, halothane, isoflurane, and enflurane significantly increased the QT interval and QTc. The results demonstrate that ventricular repolarization is directly altered by the volatile anesthetics independent of changes in autonomic nervous tone. Whether or not such effects are additive with other congenital or acquired forms of QTc prolongation has yet to be examined. The present results indicate that caution should be used during the administration of volatile anesthetics to patients with abnormalities of the QT interval.\r"

A variant of the \"psoas compartment block\" and the classic technique were used in groups 1 (n = 25) and 2 (n = 25), respectively. All procedures were carried out under light general anesthesia with the patients in the lateral position using insulated needles and electrical stimulation. Both procedures were effective, allowing completion of surgery without additional treatment in almost all patients. However, the distribution of analgesia differed: 23 (ipsilateral) lumbar and sacral plexus blocks and 2 (ipsilateral) lumbar blocks alone were produced in group 2, compared to 22 areas of anesthesia comparable to those that might be associated with a lumbar epidural block and two ipsilateral lumbar plexus blocks in group 1. The two techniques are not, therefore, mere variants of the same basic approach to the lumbar plexus. The procedure described by Winnie et al. (Anesthesiol Rev 1974;1:11-6) was more suitable for providing unilateral blockade than the \"psoas compartment block.\"\r"

However, the combination has been reported to cause fatal hyperkalemia in pigs. The present study evaluated the serum concentrations of cations, serum osmolarity, and cardiovascular responses in 20 mongrel dogs after dantrolene with and without the concurrent administration of verapamil. The dogs were randomly classified into four groups of five dogs each: group 1 received neither dantrolene nor verapamil; group 2 received three successive intravenous doses of dantrolene (1, 3, and 6 mg/kg) at 30-minute intervals; group 3 received verapamil 0.1 mg/kg IV bolus, followed by a continuous infusion of 5 micrograms.kg-1.hr-1; and group 4 received verapamil as in group 3, followed by dantrolene as in group 2. Measurements were made at 15-minute intervals for 2 1/2 hours. Progressive and similar statistically significant increases in mean serum potassium occurred after 105 minutes in dogs given dantrolene (group 2, mean peak serum potassium levels 5.4 +/- 0.5 mmol/L) and after 90 minutes in dogs given verapamil-dantrolene (group 4, 5.2 +/- 1.6 mmol/L). A statistically significant decrease in serum sodium levels was also found in groups 2 and 4. One dog in group 4 developed intermittent second-degree heart block after the final dose of dantrolene. Serum calcium levels (ionized and total) tended to decrease in groups 2 and 4. There were no statistically significant differences in osmolarities, cardiac outputs, or mean arterial blood pressures among groups. In summary, significant elevations of serum potassium were observed in this dog model given dantrolene with and without verapamil.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The left lung was initially ventilated with 100% O2 (hyperoxia) but subsequently underwent either reabsorption atelectasis (atelectasis; group I) or ventilation with a hypoxic gas mixture (hypoxia; group II). The mean intrapleural pressure in the left hemithorax was 5.4 cm H2O during hyperoxia, but with left lung atelectasis decreased significantly to -3.8 cm H2O by 15 minutes and to -4.2 cm H2O by 90 minutes. Venous admixture (% VA) increased significantly from 10.3% during hyperoxia to 33.2% at 15 minutes of left lung atelectasis and to 34.6% at 90 minutes. However, after sternotomy with the left lung still atelectatic, the %VA decreased significantly to 25.4% For the hypoxia group, %VA increased significantly from 9.2% during hyperoxia to 29.9% at 15 minutes of left lung hypoxia and 25.1% at 90 minutes. HPV diverted blood flow away from both atelectatic lung and hypoxic lung. However, due to the negative intrapleural pressure generated during left lung resorption atelectasis when the chest was closed, HPV was less effective during atelectasis than during hypoxia.\r"

The urinary excretion of AAP was determined in patients after enflurane anesthesia with or without concurrent aminoglycoside administration to determine if enflurane enhances the nephrotoxic potential of aminoglycosides. Twenty-two patients with normal renal function were studied. Ten received enflurane alone, eight received enflurane plus gentamicin or tobramycin, and four patients who underwent nitrous oxide and narcotic anesthesia were the control group. Preoperative values ranged from 1010 to 2461 microU/24 hour. Urinary AAP excretion increased significantly in both enflurane groups 2 days postoperatively (P less than 0.025). Patients who received both enflurane and aminoglycosides had significantly greater urinary AAP excretion on postoperative day 2 than did patients given enflurane alone: 21,342 +/- 4074 microU/24 hour and 6336 +/- 1496 microU/24 hour, respectively (mean +/- SEM, P less than 0.005). There was no change in AAP excretion in the control group compared to baseline; on day 3 AAP was 1412 +/- 710 microU/24 hour. No changes in blood urea nitrogen or serum creatinine levels were observed. These data suggest that enflurane increases the renal tubular effects of aminoglycosides, possibly increasing the risk of aminoglycoside renal toxicity.\r"

Patients were given either NEO (seven elderly and ten young) or PYR (seven elderly and eight young) and received nitrous oxide in oxygen (60:40) and 1 MAC halothane. Neuromuscular transmission was assessed by using evoked compound electromyography. Metocurine 0.1 mg/kg was given, followed by a continuous infusion to achieve 90% reduction in baseline single twitch height. After at least 30 minutes, either NEO (0.07 mg/kg) or PYR (0.14 mg/kg) and atropine (0.02 mg/kg) were given IV. After injection of NEO or PYR, the duration of maximal response (DOMR) was recorded. Mean (+/- SE) ages were 38 +/- 5 and 68 +/- 2 years in the two groups of patients receiving PYR. In the elderly, PYR significantly prolonged DOMR compared to younger patients (35.3 +/- 8.2 vs 14.4 +/- 4.2 minutes, respectively). The mean ages in the two groups of patients receiving NEO were 41.5 +/- 4 and 72 +/- 2 years. The elderly group demonstrated a significant increase in the DOMR compared to younger patients (32 +/- 10 vs 11 +/- 2 minutes, respectively). It is concluded that, compared to younger patients, the duration of action of NEO and PYR in the aged patient is prolonged.\r"

Linear analog scale for pain and pain relief, level of alertness, and vital signs were assessed at 60 and 120 minutes after each study drug dose, before additional doses, and at discharge. Eighteen patients (12 men, six women; mean age, 29.3 +/- 7.7 years) were studied. Six received only morphine, six received only butorphanol, and six received each treatment at some time during the study period, resulting in 45 randomizations to treatment. The two therapies did not differ significantly (P greater than .40) with respect to pain or relief of pain scores, level of alertness, or vital signs. The discharge rate was 69.6% and 68.2% with morphine and butorphanol, respectively (P = .92). The incidence of adverse effects was 13% and 23% with morphine and butorphanol, respectively (P = .46). We conclude that morphine and butorphanol are equally effective in the treatment of sickle cell crisis pain.\r"

Of the 284 patients presenting within the first 48 hours after injury, 23 were not diagnosed initially, 21 because radiographs were initially read as negative and two because no radiographs were taken.

The mean +/- SEM urinary LDH for the five patients with renal injuries was 129.4 +/- 35 U/L, which was not significantly different from the mean urinary LDH levels in either the 22 patients without demonstrable genitourinary or retroperitoneal injuries (92.9 +/- 20.7 U/L) or the nine patients with nonrenal genitourinary or retroperitoneal injuries (165 +/- 46 U/L). Urinary LDH at a threshold of 135 U/L was more specific (75% vs 53%, P less than .01) and more accurate (74% vs 57%, P less than .01) than hematuria at a threshold of 50 red blood cells per high-power field in predicting lacerations of the kidney or ureter; urinary LDH was less sensitive than hematuria at these thresholds (67% vs 100%), but not significantly.

One hundred twenty patients (65%) had no initial symptoms and remained asymptomatic throughout an 18-hour follow-up period. Sixty-two (34%) of patients had symptoms initially but quickly became asymptomatic. Two (1%) developed significant complications (one chemical pneumonitis, one death). These data suggest that the risk of significant complications after accidental hydrocarbon ingestion is low (approximately 1% of patients at risk). Patients who are asymptomatic or who quickly become asymptomatic can be watched safely at home, and referral of asymptomatic patients to a hospital may be unwarranted.\r"

Although 75% of the survivors had ventricular tachyarrhythmias as initial rhythms, bradyasystolic arrests were not uniformly lethal, even with long CPR and ALS times. This study supports the need for early CPR in the prehospital care of potential sudden-death victims. We recommend, with qualification, this reporting format to emergency medical services systems to describe their cardiac arrest experience.\r"

Emergency medical technicians trained in defibrillation were directed to record the rhythm in three different monitor leads whenever they noted an initial flat line. Before these lead switches, the technicians performed a flat line protocol that included inspection of the lead connections to the patient and to the defibrillator, and checks of the calibration and battery status of the devices. They performed this flat line protocol for 127 cardiac arrest patients; 118 were in confirmed asystole after technical problems were corrected. Ventricular fibrillation was detected in only three (2.5%) when the monitor lead was switched. Initial technical problems were more frequent and were identified for ten patients (8%). The frequency of occult ventricular fibrillation (three of 118 asystolic patients) yields a 95% confidence that the true frequency is no greater than 8% to 9%. This suggests that ventricular fibrillation masquerading as asystole is rare. These data do not support protocols for empiric countershocks of patients with an initial flat line on the monitor.\r"

These solid-state modules store information about each clinical use, including selected segments of the ECG rhythm and notations on defibrillator operation. A playback unit provides annotated printouts of the recorded information. The purpose of our evaluation was to determine whether this memory module could adequately support medical control \"run-reviews\" when compared with dualfunction (voice and ECG) tape recordings. A total of 41 resuscitation attempts by emergency medical technicians trained to defibrillate (EMT-Ds) were evaluated in five preselected performance areas: defibrillation skills, command and communication at the scene, patient assessment and support, safety, and speed. When performance was reviewed using the tape recordings, the average EMT-D performance score was 16.2 (maximum, 20); when reviewed using the printouts from the medical control modules, the average score, 7.2, was significantly lower (P less than .01). The lower scores with the medical control module occurred because not all five areas of skill could be evaluated adequately by the memory module approach. Assessment of the areas of communication/command at the scene, patient assessment/support, and safety required verbal tape recordings. The medical control module appeared superior to the tape recordings at providing a quick, convenient, and accurate evaluation of rhythm assessment, shock decisions, time intervals, and defibrillator performance. They make several features of medical control review easier and more convenient, and may encourage implementation of early defibrillation programs. We conclude, however, that medical control modules cannot replace on-scene tape recordings for adequate medical control of EMT-D programs.\r"

Medical incidents were an uncommon occurrence (1.20 to 5.23 per 10,000 people) with true medical emergencies being even more unusual (0.09 to 0.31 per 10,000 people). Cardiac arrest was rare (0.01 to 0.04 events per 10,000 people). However, the rates of successful resuscitation in three studies were 85% or higher. The previous studies were descriptive in nature and failed to provide specific recommendations for medical aid system configuration or response times. A model is proposed to provide rapid response of advanced life support care to victims of cardiac arrest. We believe that the use of this model in large stadiums throughout the United States could save as many as 100 lives during each football season.\r"

Of those injured who were older, alcohol was involved in 70 per cent of the accidents. Five accidents occurred on highways (21.7%), in spite of laws banning their use on public roads. Rollover type accidents and collisions were the most frequent mechanisms of injury (39% and 35%). Of 18 patients known not to have worn a helmet, 61 per cent sustained a closed head injury. In all, there were 88 injuries in 23 patients. Common injuries included lacerations (13), long bone fractures (13), renal contusions (11) and head injury (11). There were two deaths (8.7%), two cord transections with permanent disability, and a below-knee amputation. ATVs present a serious hazard to adult and children riders alike.

  ".W": "An attempt was made to construct an ileal reservoir in 15 colectomized dogs by making a longitudinal myotomy of 15 cm length. The volume of the myotomized ileal segment did not increase, even when accompanied by more than 50 per cent obstruction of the distal sigmoid colon for periods of follow-up to 4 months. Peristalsis was not altered by the longitudinal muscular incision on the antimesenteric side of the ileum. Although the operative technique for longitudinal ileal myotomy has the benefit of simplicity compared with construction of an ileal reservoir, the latter techniques, which have been used clinically on an extensive basis, are more likely to produce a consistent distension that is suitable for fecal storage. Although there were no leaks from the mucosa and no complications occurred in the 15 dogs evaluated, the dilatation of an isolated ileal segment was so minor that this technique appears to have little application in the treatment of patients undergoing the endorectal ileal pullthrough procedure.\r"

One patient treated conservatively did well. Two patients were operated on without delay. Their hospitalization was short and they had no complications. Six patients were referred to surgery after a delay ranging from 5 days to 17 days from the time of perforation. Their hospitalization ranged from 9 to 113 days, averaging 62.7 days. Complications were common and two patients died. In order to assure survival of patients with esophageal perforation, early aggressive treatment is essential in nearly all instances. In an occasional patient with a small and clean perforation at the esophageal inlet, conservative treatment may be justified.\r"

  ".W": "During the past 19 years, 52 cases of hepatic cavernous hemangioma have been treated at our institution. Thirty patients underwent hepatic resection. In six patients, the extensive tumor mass invaded multiple segments or both lobes of the liver and complete resection was deemed hazardous. Therefore, hepatic artery ligation was carried out. In all six cases the hemangioma occupied more than two segments. Right hepatic artery ligation was done in five patients and left hepatic artery ligation in one. All are doing well without complication. The longest follow-up is 19 years and the shortest 2 years and 2 months following operation. Four patients have been followed for more than 4 years and in all patients there are no residual complaints. Computerized tomography (CT) revealed the reduction of the tumor size after arterial ligation. One patient suffered from cholecystolithiasis 9 years after hepatic artery ligation, and at the time of cholecystectomy, a biopsy and microscopic examination of the lesion revealed evidence of fibrotic degeneration of the hemangioma. These findings indicate the effectiveness of hepatic artery ligation for treatment of hepatic cavernous hemangioma that are judged hazardous to resect.\r"

The mean age was 65.7 years in resected cases and 63.5 years in unresected cases. The mean survival times in curative, noncurative resection and unresected cases were 49.8, 7.9 and 2.9 months, respectively. Although early diagnosis is difficult due to the lack of specific symptoms and signs, our results suggested that the measurement of serum CA 19-9 is a useful marker for detection and ultrasonography is helpful in the early assessment of disease. These tests, together with more aggressive surgery, may extend the survival of patients with primary carcinoma of the gallbladder.\r"

Group I patients received a 1-gram preoperative dose of cefamandole followed by 4 additional postoperative doses at 6-hour intervals. Group II received a similar regimen except that 2-gram doses of cefamandole were used. Group III received a comparable cefoxitin regimen in 2-gram doses. The patients were deemed to be at high risk for postoperative infection by virtue of the fact that most (almost 70%) were obese and all had had a recent attack of cholecystitis. There were no significant differences among the 3 groups with respect to postoperative infectious complications. It is concluded that perioperative cefamandole and cefoxitin are both effective in reducing the postoperative infectious complications of cholecystectomy. A 5-gram course of cefamandole is as effective as either a 10-gram course of cefamandole or a 10-gram course of cefoxitin and could provide a substantial savings in cost.\r"

  ".W": "The external carotid artery and its branches may serve as critical collateral pathways to the cerebral hemisphere when the internal carotid artery is occluded. In this setting, a stenotic lesion of the external carotid artery can result in hypoperfusion as well as lead to embolic phenomena via enlarged collaterals. This is a report of an experience with six external carotid endarterectomies in five patients from April 1983 to March 1986. All five of the patients had an internal carotid artery occlusion ipsilateral to a significant external carotid artery stenosis. Each patient had symptomatic cerebrovascular insufficiency with four of the five patients demonstrating clear cut symptoms, which lateralized to the side with external carotid stenosis and internal carotid occlusion. These symptoms included amaurosis fugax in four patients and transient extremity weakness in two patients. Four out of five patients were completely relieved of their symptoms after external carotid endarterectomy with follow up periods ranging from 6 months to 2 and one half years. There were no perioperative neurological deficits or complications. The duplex scan was useful in identifying possible candidates for this operation. Important technical details include use of an arterial shunt and closure of the internal carotid artery stump, which may be a source of further emboli. It is concluded that with appropriate patient selection, external carotid endarterectomy can be safely employed with gratifying results in patients with advanced cerebrovascular disease.\r"

  ".W": "Four patients developed acute arthritis following parathyroidectomy over a 3 year period in two general surgical practices. The diagnosis of pseudogout was made by clinical presentation, radiologic findings and demonstration of synovial fluid crystals exhibiting weakly positive birefringence. Rapid resolution of clinical arthritis followed joint aspiration and administration of anti-inflammatory agents in all four patients. Patients with hypercalcemia have a high incidence of calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate crystal deposition into joints. Rapid drops in serum calcium levels can cause shedding of these crystals into synovial fluid which may precipitate acute attacks of pseudogout. Because the relative hypocalcemia following parathyroidectomy provides a good stimulus for crystal shedding, it follows that hypercalcemic patients undergoing parathyroidectomy should experience a high incidence of acute pseudogout. Although this entity has been described before, its occurrence is not widely recognized in clinical practice. It is proposed that these four cases observed over a 3 year period indicate that pseudogout following parathyroidectomy occurs more commonly than previously recognized.\r"

The surgeon is frequently faced with the necessity of intestinal resection in treating such cases. The remaining bowel, while judged viable may have been exposed to significant ischemic injury. The surgeon must decide whether such bowel will heal satisfactorily if used in an anastomosis. This study was undertaken to determine the effect of transient ischemia on intestinal anastomotic healing in the rat. Male albino rats were subjected to superior mesenteric artery occlusion for periods of 30 minutes or 45 minutes. The circulation was then re-established. The small bowel was the transected and anastomosed. Animals in each group were sacrificed at 7 and 10 days and bursting pressures performed to test the healing of the anastomosis. Results were compared with a control group having an anastomosis without precedent ischemia. There were no significant differences among the groups. The data clearly indicate that if the bowel remains viable following an ischemic insult its healing is unimpaired.\r"

Treatment has included surgical decompression by cecostomy and colectomy. Successful nonoperative decompression by colonoscopy was first reported by Kukora and Dent in 1977. Since that report several authors have reported their results using this technique. Presented here is a series of nine patients with colonic pseudo-obstruction treated initially with colonoscopy. Patients presented with a variety of associated conditions, including post operative patients, orthopedic injuries, metastatic carcinoma, and an unusual case after a normal vaginal delivery. Eight patients responded well to colonoscopic decompression. One patient, the second in the series, was unable to be decompressed with colonoscopy and underwent a cecostomy under local anesthesia. Successive colonoscopy may be required to allow restoration of normal colonic function, as was the case in seven of our patients. One death occurred, due to unrelated causes. The authors have found colonoscopy to be a safe and reliable therapy for colonic pseudo-obstruction.\r"

SETTING: Governmental medical referral center. PATIENTS: Fourteen patients with malignant pheochromocytoma confirmed by histologic tests. All patients had metastatic disease and elevated urinary catecholamine secretion. INTERVENTIONS: After optimization of antihypertensive therapy, patients received cyclophosphamide, 750 mg/m2 body surface area on day 1; vincristine, 1.4 mg/m2 on day 1, and dacarbazine, 600 mg/m2 on days 1 and 2, every 21 days. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Combination chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide, vincristine, and dacarbazine produced a complete and partial response rate of 57% (median duration, 21 months; range, 7 to more than 34). Complete and partial biochemical responses were seen in 79% of patients (median duration, more than 22 months; range, 6 to more than 35). All responding patients had objective improvement in performance status and blood pressure. Toxicity included expected hematologic, neurologic, and gastrointestinal effects of chemotherapy without serious sequelae. There were four minor hypotensive episodes and one minor hypertensive episode. CONCLUSIONS: Combination chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide, vincristine, and dacarbazine is effective for advanced malignant pheochromocytoma. Urinary catecholamines are useful to ascertain biochemical response to therapy.\r"

Four patients who developed pneumonitis after unilateral thoracic irradiation for carcinoma of the breast were studied with bronchoalveolar lavage, gallium scan of the lung, and respiratory function tests. On the irradiated side of the chest, all four patients showed an increase in total cells recovered from the lavage fluid and a marked increase in the percentage of lymphocytes. When results for the unirradiated lung were compared with results for the irradiated lung, there was a comparable increase in total cells and percentage of lymphocytes. Gallium scans showed increases for both irradiated and unirradiated lungs. Prompt improvement was seen after corticosteroid therapy in all patients. The fact that abnormal findings occur equally in irradiated and unirradiated lung is inconsistent with simple direct radiation-induced injury and suggests an immunologically mediated mechanism such as a hypersensitivity pneumonitis.\r"
