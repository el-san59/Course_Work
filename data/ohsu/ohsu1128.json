The precise mechanisms for enhanced drug clearance in CF remain to be elucidated, and it will be important to examine the two major organs of drug elimination, the kidney and liver, for answers to these questions. Although it has not been studied to date, the role of the lung as a contributor to enhanced drug clearance in CF needs to be considered as well. In the liver it appears that both hepatic biotransformation as well as biliary excretion may be enhanced. In the kidney, there is enhanced CL of acidic drugs, but variable findings for cationic and zwitterionic drugs. The latter finding can be explained on the basis of the pKa of the drugs and the urine pH. It would be most appealing if enhanced renal and nonrenal clearance of drugs in CF could be attributed to a common single defect. At this time, there is no obvious candidate, although altered transmembrane transport would represent a place to start.\r"

These include: need for higher oral dosages of cyclosporine, likelihood of precipitation of diabetes mellitus with high dosage corticosteroid therapy for acute lung rejection, constant threat of pathogens remaining in the sinuses, increased likelihood of drug toxicity to the liver and kidneys, and need to make a psychological transition from a patient with a fatal disease to one with optimism about the future.

There is little evidence that the high prevalence of positive allergy skin tests in CF is a clinical manifestation of a hypersensitivity lung disease complicating the primary pulmonary disorder, except in the special case of allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis. The lung disease of CF appears to be caused by excessive bronchial secretions and recurrent infection that are the result of abnormal ion transport across the apical membrane of the respiratory epithelial cell. There are two important questions concerning the allergic reactions: Are they clinically significant, and, why do they occur? The former question is partly resolved by the data presented, although well-controlled studies of intervention would help to resolve it further. The cause of these reactions, which occur particularly in relationship to the mold Aspergillus fumigatus, is unknown but the author is inclined to the view that they are the result of recurrent infection that induces heightened immunologic reactivity to inhaled allergens. The significance of AF may be simply that this mold has a \"predilection for diseased airways\" or may be more complex; for example, owing to abnormal ion composition in respiratory secretions, abnormal lectin expression by CF respiratory epithelial cells, or selective filtration by the airways based on particle size.\r"

  ".W": "Respiratory viruses have been implicated in pulmonary exacerbations of CF and in the long-term course of pulmonary dysfunction in these patients. However, the data are by no means complete and there is the clear need for more intensive evaluations of the role of viral pathogens in this population. Further controlled prospective studies assessing the impact of viral infections in large cohorts of patients with CF are still necessary. Placebo-controlled, antiviral treatment protocols also should be initiated. In clinical practice at the present time, patients with CF should be assessed for respiratory viral infections, at least at the time of hospitalizations for pulmonary deterioration. This assessment should include obtaining specimens from the respiratory tract for viral cultures and rapid respiratory viral antigen detection. Identifying a respiratory viral infection may alter clinical care. The patient can be isolated appropriately, and it may be possible to reduce the intensive use of expensive and potentially toxic parenteral antibiotics. The role of antiviral therapy in these patients must await further evaluations. The mechanisms of the short- and long-term effects of respiratory viruses in patients with CF have not been defined. However, pathophysiologic studies conducted in normal children and adults allow the development of several plausible hypotheses. The definition of mechanisms of injury in this population must be a priority, since it may influence clinical practice. If airway obstruction is the principal mechanism of viral-induced injury, therapeutic approaches designed to relieve the obstruction would be most appropriate. For example, if the obstruction resulted from induced or aggravated reactive airway disease, the current common practice of prescribing chronic bronchodilator therapy would be appropriate. This therapy might be especially suited to those experiencing frequent viral infections. In addition, the administration of bronchodilators to patients during acute exacerbations of pulmonary disease caused by viruses might be of clinical benefit. If, on the other hand, the principal mechanism of viral-induced injury is found to be through synergistic interaction with bacteria, the current practice of aggressive antimicrobial therapy would remain appropriate.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND. Most patients do not undergo acute reperfusion after myocardial infarction, and which of these patients should undergo coronary angiography is still debated. METHODS AND RESULTS. We analyzed the 1-year clinical outcomes and rates of coronary angiography performed as late as 60 days after myocardial infarction in 3,804 patients admitted between 1979 and 1988 and followed in six different centers. Patients less than 75 years old were classified into low-, medium-, and high-risk groups using a multivariate analysis of historical and clinical variables gathered during the first 8 hospital days. Patients who underwent early reperfusion (17%, all after 1984) were analyzed separately. To analyze time trends, patients were compared before and after mid-1984. Mortalities from day 9 through 1 year were similar for the two time periods in the low- (3.3% versus 2.5%) and medium-risk (7.4% versus 5.6%) groups, but mortality was lower for the high-risk group after 1984 (31.6% versus 20.0%). The proportion of patients undergoing coronary angiography increased dramatically in each group after 1984 (low risk, 18% versus 48%; medium risk, 23% versus 49%; high risk, 10% versus 32%, before and after 1984, respectively). Furthermore, a large percentage of patients (more than 40%) in the low-risk group did not have at least one of the indications for coronary angiography recently recommended by a joint task force. Among patients undergoing coronary angiography, the proportion of patients with three-vessel coronary artery disease decreased after 1984, whereas the proportion undergoing mechanical revascularization in the year after infarction increased in all risk groups. CONCLUSIONS. Despite the recent development of noninvasive techniques with high sensitivity for detecting high-risk patients after myocardial infarction, coronary angiography is being performed increasingly in all patients, including those determined to be at low risk for complications based on clinical data. The economic consequences of such a trend could be considerable, and its impact requires careful analysis.\r"

We hypothesized that this is related to an abnormally large decrease in left ventricular end-diastolic volume (LVEDV) and stroke volume (SV) for any given decrease in filling pressure. METHODS AND RESULTS. We measured pulmonary capillary wedge (PCW) pressure (Swan-Ganz catheter), LVEDV (two-dimensional echocardiography), and cardiac output (C2H2 rebreathing) during lower body negative pressure (LBNP, -15 and -30 mm Hg) and rapid saline infusion (15 and 30 ml/kg) in seven athletes and six controls (VO2max, 68 +/- 7 and 41 +/- 4 ml/kg/min). Orthostatic tolerance was determined by progressive LBNP to presyncope. Athletes had steeper slopes of their SV/PCW pressure curves than nonathletes (5.5 +/- 2.7 versus 2.7 +/- 1.5 ml/mm Hg, p less than 0.05). The slope of the steep, linear portion of this curve correlated significantly with the duration of LBNP tolerance (r = 0.58, p = 0.04). The athletes also had reduced chamber stiffness (increased chamber compliance) expressed as the slope (k) of the dP/dV versus P relation (chamber stiffness, k = 0.008 +/- 0.004 versus 0.031 +/- 0.004, p less than 0.005; chamber compliance, 1/k = 449.8 +/- 283.8 versus 35.3 +/- 4.3). This resulted in larger absolute and relative changes in end-diastolic volume over an equivalent range of filling pressures. CONCLUSIONS. Endurance athletes have greater ventricular diastolic chamber compliance and distensibility than nonathletes and thus operate on the steep portion of their Starling curve. This may be a mechanical, nonautonomic cause of orthostatic intolerance.\r"

We tested the hypothesis that beta-adrenergic receptor-stimulated acceleration of left ventricular (LV) isovolumic relaxation (i.e., positive lusitropic response) is attenuated in patients with severe congestive heart failure (CHF) compared with patients without LV dysfunction or CHF. METHODS AND RESULTS. The beta-adrenergic agonist dobutamine was infused by the intracoronary route in 14 subjects (normal group, six; CHF patients, eight) and by the intravenous route in a second group of 14 subjects (normal group, four; CHF patients, 10). The positive inotropic response to intracoronary or intravenous dobutamine was substantially and significantly reduced in the patients with CHF. LV isovolumic relaxation rate was determined by the methods of Weiss (TL), Mirsky (T1/2), and by a nonlinear regression technique (TNL). LV isovolumic relaxation assessed by all three methods was significantly prolonged in CHF patients compared with normal subjects. Intracoronary and intravenous infusions of dobutamine caused significant acceleration of LV isovolumic relaxation in both normal subjects and patients with CHF. The magnitude of the dobutamine-stimulated acceleration of isovolumic relaxation in patients with CHF was comparable with that in normal subjects. CONCLUSIONS. These data demonstrate that beta-adrenergic receptor stimulation causes significant acceleration of LV isovolumic relaxation in both normal subjects and patients with severe CHF. Coronary to our hypothesis, the lusitropic response to beta-adrenergic stimulation is well preserved in patients with severe CHF despite substantial attenuation of the beta-adrenergic positive inotropic response. These findings have potentially important implications regarding the physiology and pharmacology of adrenergically mediated LV relaxation in humans.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND. Resistance, pulse wave velocity, and wave reflections have been shown to be increased in patients with essential hypertension compared with normotensive controls. These alterations are completely normalized by nitroprusside infusion but exacerbated during beta-adrenergic blockade, suggesting an enhanced smooth muscle tone that is in part modulated by adrenergically mediated vasodilation. The present study was performed to examine the extent to which this apparently enhanced smooth muscle tone is a result of alpha-adrenergically mediated vasoconstriction. METHODS AND RESULTS. Age-matched normotensive and hypertensive Chinese subjects were instrumented with catheter-tipped micromanometers and an electromagnetic flow velocity sensor positioned in the ascending aorta. Aortic impedance and wave reflection properties were obtained from Fourier analysis of the pressure and flow signals during baseline conditions, after beta-blockade with propranolol (0.15 mg/kg i.v.), and after alpha-blockade with intravenous phentolamine (range, 15-80 mg) that was sufficient to either normalize blood pressure or produce a pressure that could not be further lowered. Compared with normotensives, in the baseline state, hypertensives had elevated resistance (1,962 versus 1,268 dyne.sec/cm5, p less than 0.001), total power (1,893 versus 1,568 mW, p less than 0.08), reflected pressure wave component (25.6 versus 13.5 mm Hg, p less than 0.001), ratio of reflected to forward wave (0.65 versus 0.42, p less than 0.001), and pulse wave velocity as determined from the frequency of the first zero-crossing of impedance phase angle (4.6 versus 3.5 Hz, p less than 0.03). During combined alpha- and beta-adrenergic blockade, blood pressure decreased into the normal range (from 162/103 to 131/87 mm Hg) but was still somewhat higher than that in the normotensive subjects. Resistance (1,914 dyne.sec/cm5, p less than 0.03), reflected wave (19.5 mm Hg, p less than 0.01), and ratio of reflected to forward wave (0.61, p less than 0.001) were, however, persistently elevated above normal values. CONCLUSIONS. alpha-Adrenergically mediated vasoconstriction cannot account for all of the hemodynamic alterations seen in essential hypertension.\r"

  ".U": "91356623\r", 
  ".W": "BACKGROUND. Left ventricular endocardial reentry is the conventional concept underlying surgery for ventricular tachycardia (VT). We assessed the incidences of patterns showing complete reentry circuits at either the subendocardial or subepicardial level and of patterns in which left ventricular endocardial mapping could only in part account for a reentrant mechanism. METHODS AND RESULTS. We retrospectively analyzed epicardial and left ventricular endocardial isochronal maps of 47 VTs induced in 28 patients with chronic myocardial infarction (inferior, 14 patients; anteroseptal, 14 patients). Electrograms were recorded intraoperatively from 128 sites with epicardial sock and transatrial left ventricular endocardial balloon electrode arrays. Given the methodology used in this study, the mapping characteristics of the tachycardias suggested five types of activation patterns: 1) complete (90% or more of VT cycle length) subendocardial reentry circuits in seven VTs (15%) and seven patients (25%), 2) complete subepicardial reentry circuits in four VTs (9%) and four patients (14%), 3) incompletely mapped circuits with a left ventricular endocardial breakthrough preceding the epicardial breakthrough in 25 VTs (53%) and 21 patients (75%), 4) incompletely mapped circuits with a left ventricular epicardial breakthrough preceding the endocardial breakthrough in three VTs (6%) and three patients (11%), and 5) a right ventricular epicardial breakthrough preceding the left ventricular endocardial breakthrough in eight VTs (17%) and seven patients (25%). After surgery, one type 3 VT and three type 5 VTs were reinducible. Thus, left ventricular endocardial reentry substrates (types 1 and 3) accounted for 68% of VTs, but substrates involving subepicardial (types 2 and 4) and deep septal layers (type 5) accounted for 32% of VTs. CONCLUSIONS: In a substantial number of VTs, a substrate localization that is at variance with the conventional concept can be detected by simultaneous epicardial and endocardial mapping and may require modification of the surgical approach conventionally aimed at endocardial layers.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND. To assess the extent and nature of the dysfunction surrounding aneurysms of the left ventricle (LV), we examined the parameters of local and global three-dimensional shape, size, and function of LVs of eight patients with histologically confirmed anterior fibrous aneurysms. METHODS AND RESULTS. Three-dimensional reconstructions of each LV were made from 10-12 short-axis fast cine-angiographic computed tomography (cine-CT) slices encompassing the entire heart at end diastole and end systole. Regional three-dimensional wall thickness, thickening, motion, curvature, and stress index were calculated for 84 elements encompassing the entire LV. The aneurysmal border was defined by a sharp decrease in end-diastolic wall thickness and separated the LV into an aneurysmal zone and a normal zone that was further divided into adjacent normal (AN) and remote normal (RN) zones. As expected, thickening was negligible in both the aneurysmal and the border zones. Although both the AN and the RN zones had normal wall thickness (1.05 +/- 0.20 and 1.09 +/- 0.20 cm, respectively), thickening was depressed in the AN (0.22 +/- 0.08 cm) but not the RN (0.44 +/- 0.19 cm) zones. The size of the dysfunction zone (defined as less than 2 mm thickening) was found to be considerably greater than the anatomic size of the aneurysm (60.9 +/- 13.7% versus 33.6 +/- 7.6% of the left ventricular endocardial area, respectively; p less than 0.001). In addition, the AN zone had a smaller curvature and a higher stress index than the RN zone. CONCLUSIONS. LVs with fibrous aneurysms are characterized by a relatively large region of nonfunction that encompasses the thin aneurysmal area and its transitional border zone, a normally functioning remote zone, and an intermediate region of normal wall thickness but with reduced function, which may be attributed to its low curvature and high stress index.\r"

Intravascular ultrasound is a new tomographic imaging method for evaluation of coronary dimensions and wall morphology. Few data exist regarding intravascular ultrasound in patients with CAD, and no data exist for subjects with normal coronaries. METHODS AND RESULTS. We used a multielement 5.5F, 20-MHz ultrasound catheter to examine eight normal subjects and 43 patients with CAD. We assessed the safety of coronary ultrasound and the effect of vessel eccentricity on comparison of minimum luminal diameter by angiography and ultrasound. Normal and atherosclerotic wall morphology and stenosis severity were also evaluated by intravascular ultrasound. The only untoward effect was transient coronary spasm in five patients. At 33 sites in normal subjects, the lumen was nearly circular, yielding a close correlation between angiographic and ultrasonic minimum diameter (r = 0.92). At 90 sites in patients with CAD, ultrasound demonstrated a concentric cross section; correlation was also close (r = 0.93). However, at 72 eccentric sites, correlation was not as close (r = 0.77). For 41 stenoses, correlation between angiography and ultrasound for area reduction was moderate (r = 0.63). In normal subjects, wall morphology revealed a thin (0.30 mm or less) intimal leading edge and subadjacent sonolucent zone (0.20 mm or less). Patients with CAD exhibited increased thickness and echogenicity of the leading edge, thickened sonolucent zones, and/or attenuation of ultrasound transmission. CONCLUSIONS. These data establish that intravascular ultrasound is feasible and safe and yields luminal measurements that correlate generally with angiography. Differences between angiographic and ultrasound measures of lumen size in eccentric vessels probably reflect the dissimilar perspectives of tomographic and silhouette imaging techniques. Intravascular ultrasound provides detailed images of normal and abnormal wall morphology not previously possible in vivo.\r"

  ".U": "91356626\r", 
  ".W": "BACKGROUND. We wished to assess whether dipyridamole echocardiography test (DET) can detect jeopardized myocardium after thrombolytic therapy. METHODS AND RESULTS. Seventy-six consecutive patients with a first acute myocardial infarction (AMI) were treated with 2 million IU urokinase i.v. within 4 hours of the onset of AMI and underwent high-dose (as much as 0.84 mg/kg over 10 minutes) DET 8-10 days after AMI. The results were correlated to the anatomy of the infarct-related vessel (IRV). In patients with positive DET, we evaluated the wall motion score index (WMSI; a semiquantitative integrated estimation of extent and severity of the stress-induced dyssynergy). WMSI was derived by summation of individual segment scores divided by the number of interpreted segments. In a 13-segment model, each segment was assigned a score ranging from 1 (normal) to 4 (dyskinetic). Fifty-three patients had positive results on DET. Of these, 42 had dipyridamole-induced new wall motion abnormalities (WMAs) confined to the infarct zone or adjacent segments. In these patients, mean WMSI increased from 1.46 +/- 0.26 (at resting conditions) to 1.73 +/- 0.35 (at peak dipyridamole) (p less than 0.01), whereas no significant change was detected in negative patients (1.6 +/- 0.34 versus 1.57 +/- 0.34, p = NS). Coronary angiography showed a patent IRV (TIMI grade 2 or 3) in 53 patients and no or minimal reperfusion (TIMI grade 0 or 1) in 23 patients. A patent IRV with critical residual stenosis was found in 35 of 42 patients with dipyridamole-induced WMAs in the infarct zone and in 18 of 34 patients without WMAs (p less than 0.05). Among the 23 patients with occluded IRVs, nine had collateral flow to the distal vessel; six of these had a positive DET. Thus, the sensitivity and specificity for identifying a critically stenotic but patent IRV or the presence of a collateral-dependent zone were 66% and 93%, respectively. In a subset of nine patients with a positive DET in the infarct zone or adjacent segments, DET and a control coronary angiography were repeated 1-3 months after an angiographically successful (residual stenosis, 50% or less) coronary angioplasty in the IRV. The repeat DET was negative in eight patients (all with patent IRV at control angiography) and again positive in one patient, who showed restenosis at angiography. The WMSI, at resting conditions was similar before and after angioplasty, whereas it differed significantly at peak dipyridamole (1.7 +/- 0.2 versus 1.4 +/- 0.2, p less than 0.01). CONCLUSIONS. DET can identify the anatomy of the IRV, and dipyridamole-induced WMAs within the infarct zone detect regions with jeopardized myocardium that may benefit from intervention.\r"

This could result from inotropic actions or from direct sensitization of cardiac mechanoreceptors. METHODS AND RESULTS. To determine if digitalis has similar actions in humans and to evaluate the mechanisms involved, we measured muscle sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA; microneurography) during unloading of cardiopulmonary baroreceptors with incremental lower body negative pressure (LBNP; 0 to -15 mm Hg) and during the cold pressor test in 22 normal subjects (age 22 +/- 1 year, mean +/- SEM). Arterial and central venous pressures, heart rate, and MSNA were measured during LBNP before and after intravenous digitalis (Cedilanid 0.02 ng/kg, n = 8), dobutamine (2.8 +/- 0.5 micrograms/kg/min, n = 8), or placebo (n = 6). Digitalis and dobutamine produced similar increases in baseline mean arterial pressure and decreases in central venous pressure and MSNA. LBNP produced similar decreases in central venous pressure in all groups before and after drug administration. The MSNA responses to LBNP were markedly potentiated by digitalis but not by dobutamine or placebo. CONCLUSIONS. Digitalis did not alter responses to the cold pressor test. Thus, digitalis selectively potentiated cardiopulmonary baroreflex regulation of sympathetic neural responses in normal humans, whereas dobutamine (another positive inotropic agent) did not produce this effect. We conclude that digitalis augments cardiopulmonary baroreflex control of sympathetic activity, probably by direct baroreceptor sensitization.\r"

A consecutive series of 40 chronic cocaine abusers 23-44 years old who were enrolled in an inpatient drug rehabilitation program were considered for the study. Subjects with elevated resting blood pressure (n = 4) or a history of hypertension (n = 3) were excluded. Technically adequate two-dimensional echocardiograms were obtained in 30 cocaine abusers and 30 age- and race-matched normal control subjects. All subjects were men, and the groups were similar with regard to resting blood pressure, height, weight, and body surface area. All echocardiograms were read in blinded fashion, and left ventricular mass was calculated by the area-length method. Left ventricular cavity dimensions and wall motion were normal in all subjects. Left ventricular mass index was higher in the cocaine group (103 +/- 24 versus 77 +/- 14 g/m2, p = 0.0001). Posterior wall thickness was increased (1.2 cm or more) in 13 cocaine abusers (43%) compared with four controls (p = 0.0099). CONCLUSIONS. Chronic cocaine abuse is associated with increased left ventricular mass index and wall thickness. Left ventricular hypertrophy may provide a substrate facilitating the development of myocardial ischemia and/or arrhythmias in cocaine abusers.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND. The Long QT Syndrome (LQTS) is an infrequently occurring familial disorder in which affected individuals have electrocardiographic QT interval prolongation and a propensity to ventricular tachyarrhythmic syncope and sudden death. We prospectively investigated the clinical characteristics and the long-term course of 3,343 individuals from 328 families in which one or more members were identified as affected with LQTS (QTc greater than 0.44 sec1/2). METHODS AND RESULTS. The first member of a family to be identified with LQTS, the proband, was usually brought to medical attention because of a syncopal episode during childhood or teenage years. Probands (n = 328) were younger at first contact (age 21 +/- 15 years), more likely to be female (69%), and had a higher frequency of preenrollment syncope or cardiac arrest with resuscitation (80%), congenital deafness (7%), a resting heart rate less than 60 beats/min (31%), QTc greater than or equal to 0.50 sec1/2 (52%), and a history of ventricular tachyarrhythmia (47%) than other affected (n = 688) and unaffected (n = 1,004) family members. Arrhythmogenic syncope often occurred in association with acute physical, emotional, or auditory arousal. The syncopal episodes were frequently misinterpreted as a seizure disorder. By age 12 years, 50% of the probands had experienced at least one syncopal episode or death. The rates of postenrollment syncope (one or more episodes) and probable LQTS-related death (before age 50 years) for probands (n = 235; average follow-up 54 months per patient) were 5.0% per year and 0.9% per year, respectively; these event rates were considerably higher than those observed among affected and unaffected family members. CONCLUSIONS. Among 232 probands and 1,264 family members with prospective follow-up, three factors made significant independent contributions to the risk of subsequent syncope or probable LQTS-related death before age 50 years, whichever occurred first (Cox hazard ratio; 95% confidence limits): 1) QTc (1.052; 1.017, 1.088), 2) history of cardiac event (3.1; 1.3, 7.2), and 3) heart rate (1.017; 1.004, 1.031). The findings from this prospective longitudinal study highlight the clinical features, risk factors, and course of LQTS.\r"

Unfortunately, the usefulness of the drugs currently available is limited by accompanying systemic hypotension. A vasodilator with effects confined to the pulmonary circulation would therefore be advantageous in such patients. METHODS AND RESULTS. The purine nucleoside adenosine was infused into the pulmonary artery in seven patients with primary pulmonary hypertension (baseline pulmonary vascular resistance [PVR], 442-1,295 dyne/cm/sec-5) to determine its effect on PVR. In all patients, there was a dose-dependent and significant reduction (mean maximal percent decrease from baseline, 38.9%; p less than 0.001) in PVR mediated through a decrease in pulmonary artery pressure and an increase in cardiac output. Systemic vascular resistance (SVR) also decreased, but the ratio of PVR to SVR decreased (maximal mean percent decrease from baseline) by 10.5% (p less than 0.025), indicating that adenosine has a preferential vasodilator effect on the pulmonary circulation when administered in this manner. CONCLUSIONS. Because of its pharmacokinetic and vasodilator properties, adenosine may have a specific role in the investigation of primary pulmonary hypertension.\r"

Several reports have documented both the efficacy and safety of this procedure. However, there are little data available on the long-term follow-up of these patients. This report details the initial results and long-term evaluation of both the relief of obstruction and the presence of hypertension after balloon angioplasty for recurrent coarctation. METHODS AND RESULTS. Balloon angioplasty for recurrent coarctation of the aorta was performed 29 times in 26 patients at a median age of 4 years and 9 months (range, 4 months to 29 years), with eight patients less than 1 year old. Initial surgical techniques were end-to-end anastomosis in 11 patients, subclavian flap aortoplasty in 11 patients, and patch aortoplasty in four patients. Angioplasty was performed at a median interval of 2 years and 7 months (range, 4 months to 23 years) after surgery. Mean peak systolic pressure difference across the coarctation decreased from 40.0 +/- 16.8 to 10.3 +/- 9.5 mm Hg (p less than 0.05) after the initial angioplasty, and mean diameter of the aortic lumen at the coarctation site increased from 5.8 +/- 3.5 to 9.0 +/- 4.3 mm (p less than 0.05). There was no mortality, and only one patient developed an aneurysm (4%). Three patients underwent repeat angioplasty for a pressure difference of more than 20 mm Hg. Long-term follow-up is available on 24 of 26 patients with a mean follow-up of 42 +/- 24 months (range, 12-88 months). Mean peak systolic pressure difference across the area of coarctation decreased from 40.3 +/- 17.4 before angioplasty to 8.5 +/- 8.3 mm Hg after final angioplasty (p less than 0.05) and 7.5 +/- 7.5 mm Hg at follow-up. Mean peak systolic blood pressure in the upper extremities decreased from 133.1 +/- 14.9 before angioplasty to 111.1 +/- 14.1 mm Hg at long-term follow-up (p less than 0.05). CONCLUSIONS. Balloon angioplasty should be considered the treatment of choice for relief of recurrent aortic coarctation.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND. To determine the effect of vasovagally mediated syncope on the cerebral circulation, transcranial Doppler sonography was used to assess changes in cerebral blood flow velocity during head-upright tilt-induced syncope. METHODS AND RESULTS. Thirty patients (17 men and 13 women; mean age, 43 +/- 22 years) with recurrent unexplained syncope were evaluated by use of an upright tilt-table test for 30 minutes, with or without an infusion of intravenous isoproterenol (1-4 micrograms/min), in an attempt to provoke bradycardia, hypotension, or both. Transcranial Doppler sonography was used to assess middle cerebral artery systolic velocity (Vs), diastolic velocity (Vd), ratio of systolic to diastolic velocities, pulsatility index (PI = Vs-Vd/Vmean), and resistance index (RI = Vs-Vd/Vs) before, during, and after tilt. Syncope occurred in six patients (20%) during the baseline tilt and 14 (46%) during isoproterenol infusion (total positives, 66%). In the tilt-positive patients, concomitant with the development of hypotension and bradycardia, transcranial Doppler sonography showed a 75 +/- 17% decrease in diastolic velocity, unchanged systolic velocity, a 46 +/- 17% decrease in mean velocity, a 295 +/- 227% increase in pulsatility index, and a 73 +/- 34% increase in resistance index. CONCLUSIONS. These findings reflect increased cerebrovascular resistance secondary to arteriolar vasoconstriction distal to the insonation point of the middle cerebral artery. This is paradoxic because the expected response of the cerebral circulation to hypotension is vasodilation. We conclude that abnormal baroreceptor responses triggered during vasovagal syncope result in a derangement of cerebral autoregulation with paradoxic vasoconstriction in the face of increasing hypotension.\r"

During the last decade, this possibility has received support from three large prospective studies. METHODS AND RESULTS. In the present study, the association between CVD, glucose intolerance, obesity, and hypertension (the GOH conditions) and hyperinsulinemia was examined cross-sectionally in a representative sample (n = 1,263) of the adult Jewish population aged 40-70 years in Israel. Previously known diabetics were excluded. CVD comprising clinical or ECG evidence of ischemic heart disease, as well as clinical evidence of cerebrovascular or peripheral vascular disease, was identified in 97 men and 39 women. A significant (p less than 0.01) hyperinsulinemia-sex interaction was found for CVD rate, with the adjusted risk ratios (followed by 95% confidence limits), relative to the rate in 298 normoinsulinemic women, being 1.15 (0.68-1.95) in 328 normoinsulinemic men, 0.85 (0.48-1.49) in 277 hyperinsulinemic women, and 2.27 (1.33-3.08) in 360 hyperinsulinemic men. Age-adjusted CVD rates in men versus women were: a) similar and low among all normoinsulinemic normotensives and hyperinsulinemics free of any of the GOH conditions (all rates less than or equal to 6.5%); b) similar and high among normoinsulinemic hypertensives (13.4% versus 10.4%); c) significantly higher in men among hyperinsulinemic normotensives with glucose intolerance and/or obesity (15.2% versus 3.3%; p = 0.02) and all hyperinsulinemic hypertensives (21.5% versus 12.8%; p = 0.04). These trends remained significant after adjusting for age, ethnic group, and blood lipids. CONCLUSIONS. Therefore, hyperinsulinemia was associated with excess CVD risk in men but not in women, and all excess CVD risk in men was confined to hyperinsulinemic individuals in the presence of glucose intolerance, obesity, or hypertension.\r"

The relation between self-reported parental disease and risk factor levels was examined in 2,637 black and 2,478 white men and women aged 18-30 years at the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) Study baseline examination (1985-1986). METHODS AND RESULTS. The prevalence of parental disease (at least one parent) in white versus black participants was 44% and 56% for hypertension, 47% and 44% for obesity, 16% and 13% for myocardial infarction, 11% and 17% for diabetes, and 6% and 10% for stroke, respectively. Among these young adults, parental hypertension was associated with higher sex- and age-adjusted systolic and diastolic blood pressure levels. Parental myocardial infarction was associated with higher plasma cholesterol, higher blood pressure levels, and lower high density lipoprotein cholesterol levels in white participants. Parental diabetes was associated with higher fasting blood glucose and insulin levels in all race-sex groups and with higher triglycerides and lower high density lipoprotein cholesterol in black participants only. Parental history of obesity was related to less favorable age- and sex-adjusted lipid levels in white participants and higher blood pressure levels in black participants. Parental history of stroke was associated with higher systolic blood pressure levels in black participants. In general, these differences across family history were predicted only in part by obesity. The prevalence of more than one disease reported in parents occurred more frequently than would have been expected due to chance alone. CONCLUSIONS. These associations between parental disease and risk factors in their adult children probably reflects the impact of both environmental and genetic factors. Parental history may be a useful marker for high risk individuals.\r"

  ".U": "91356636\r", 
  ".W": "BACKGROUND. Obstruction to left ventricular outflow in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is usually due to systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve. Occurrence of structural mitral valve abnormalities in HCM and their significance in producing outflow obstruction (even in the absence of typical systolic anterior motion) has not been fully appreciated. METHODS AND RESULTS. Analysis of 78 mitral valves excised from patients with obstructive HCM showed that 10 (13%) had anomalous insertion of one or both left ventricular papillary muscles directly into the anterior mitral leaflet. This malformation was identified by echocardiography, which demonstrated direct continuity between the hypertrophied papillary muscle and mitral leaflet, resulting in a long rigid area of midcavity narrowing that appeared to be solely or largely responsible for outflow obstruction. Basal subaortic pressure gradients were large (70-150 mm Hg). Mitral valve replacement reduced the outflow gradient substantially to 0-15 mm Hg in four patients with postoperative cardiac catheterization. However, two other patients who underwent septal myotomy/myectomy had persistent symptoms and incomplete relief of obstruction (gradients 60 and 70 mm Hg) because of continued midcavity apposition of papillary muscle and ventricular septum. CONCLUSIONS. Anomalous papillary muscle insertion into anterior mitral leaflet represents a mechanism of obstruction to left ventricular outflow in patients with HCM and differs considerably from typical dynamic obstruction caused by mitral valve systolic anterior motion that occurs in many other patients with HCM. Recognition of this malformation emphasizes the diverse morphological expression of HCM and also has important clinical implications for patients requiring operation because the gradient is likely to persist even after adequate myotomy/myectomy; consequently, mitral valve replacement would appear to be the operation of choice in most such patients.\r"

Administration of dobutamine in nine calves that underwent replacement of the native right and left ventricles with pneumatically driven total artificial hearts resulted in a significant (p = 0.0001) increase in cardiac output from 7.0 +/- 1.8 to 8.2 +/- 1.8 l/min and a significant (p = 0.0001) decrease in total peripheral vascular resistance from 1,224 +/- 559 to 745 +/- 317 dyne.sec/cm5. A less marked influence was noted on the pulmonary vasculature, with pulmonary vascular resistance exhibiting a significant (p less than 0.05) decrease from its baseline value only at the peak infusion. Consistent with an increase in venous return, both left and right atrial pressures increased significantly (p less than 0.005) with dobutamine administration. CONCLUSIONS. These data demonstrate that the vasoactive properties of dobutamine significantly contribute to improved ventricular performance independent of direct myocardial stimulation. This effect appears to result in part from a direct modulation of myocardial stimulation. This effect appears to result in part from a direct modulation of arterial and venous tones rather than from a reflex response to primary changes in contractility.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND. Although chronic volume overload is thought to induce uniform cardiac enlargement, the stimulus for tissue growth has not been defined. Changes in diastolic and systolic stress or strain have been proposed as mechanical factors that may stimulate hypertrophy. Since there are thought to be transmural variations in these stresses and strains, three-dimensional patterns of myocardial tissue growth may provide insight into the role of these factors. METHODS AND RESULTS. To assess the transmural variation in tissue growth after volume overload, the configurations of three columns of four to six gold beads (1-mm diameter) implanted in the left ventricular anterior free wall were recorded in five dogs before and after cardiac enlargement induced by creating a systemic arteriovenous fistula. Data were obtained with end-diastolic pressures adjusted to the same level in the control and hypertrophic states. End-diastolic wall thickness remained constant, whereas left ventricular diameter increased. Small increases in transmural systolic strain were seen. The volumes defined by four beads (a tetrahedron) at end diastole showed increases in myocardial mass of 20-27% after 3.6 (mean) weeks of hypertrophy and were uniform across the wall of the left ventricle. The edges of single bilinear-quadratic finite elements were fitted to the three columns of the bead set at end diastole in control and at end diastole after hypertrophy at equal end-diastolic pressures. Thus, continuous transmural strain distribution were obtained at the hypertrophic state with respect to the control state. The transmural distributions of these end-diastolic growth strains were uniform and positive for both the circumferential and longitudinal components measured in a cardiac coordinate system, with small radial growth strain indicating that growth was predominantly parallel to the epicardial tangent plane. Moreover, when strains were transformed (rotated) to fiber coordinates, in-plane fiber and cross-fiber growth strains were both positive at all locations across the wall and approximately equal in magnitude, indicating considerable growth in the cross-fiber direction. CONCLUSIONS. These results indicate that the stimulus for volume-overload hypertrophy may be constant across the wall and that substantial cross-fiber growth occurs during volume-overload hypertrophy.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND. Mice (n = 58) with abdominal heterotopic heart transplants were studied to examine the effectiveness of 111In-labeled antimyosin scintigraphy in the detection of rejection and to determine the consequence of cyclosporine therapy on the results. METHODS AND RESULTS. Allografts from B10D2 donors were transplanted into B6AF1 recipients. Of the 49 allografted mice, 19 were treated with cyclosporine (15 mg/kg.day). Nine isografted mice served as controls. Scintigraphy was performed by injecting 100 muCi 111In antimyosin monoclonal antibody 2-15 days after transplantation. An increase in the ratio of percent dose of antimyosin injected per gram (% dose/g) of the grafted heart (G) to that of the autologous heart (A) (G/A) as well as the increasing percent dose per gram of antimyosin in the grafts reflected the severity of histopathological rejection regardless of the presence or absence of cyclosporine. Scintigraphic images demonstrated unequivocally intense accumulation of 111In in rejected allografts as confirmed by histologically demonstrable myocyte necrosis. The G/A ratio in allografted mice with mildly deteriorated mechanical activity (4.2 +/- 1.0, mean +/- SD) was greater than that in mice with normal contractility (1.8 +/- 0.7) (p less than 0.001), and the necrosis correlated with this modest decline in mechanical function could be scintigraphically identified. Of mice with normally contracting allografts, the G/A ratio was greater in animals with demonstrated myocyte necrosis (2.6 +/- 0.5) than in those without necrosis (1.5 +/- 0.5) (p less than 0.001). In contrast, isografted mice or a subset of allografted mice treated with cyclosporine and not showing evidence of rejection did not manifest any significant change in G/A ratio, nor did they have scintigrams positive for rejection as late as 15 days after transplantation. CONCLUSIONS. These findings suggest that antimyosin scintigraphy is a sensitive and early indicator of cardiac transplant rejection and that it could be useful as a noninvasive method for assessing the efficacy of cyclosporine treatment.\r"

In humans, clinically overt coronary artery disease is characterized by loss of dilation to both acetylcholine and blood flow. The temporal relation, however, between functional abnormalities of the endothelium and the development of atherosclerosis has not been established. METHODS AND RESULTS. We examined endothelial vasodilator function in vivo at an early stage of the development of atherosclerosis. Two groups of seven Macaca fascicularis monkeys were studied; one group was fed a high cholesterol diet (0.73-1.0 mg cholesterol per calorie) for 11 months. Cholesterol feeding was associated with increased plasma cholesterol levels and with intimal thickening of the iliac arteries but with no reduction in luminal diameter. Endothelium-dependent vasomotor responses of the iliac arteries were then examined in vivo by quantitative contrast angiography. Acetylcholine produced significant dilation in the controls but paradoxical constriction in the group with early atherosclerosis (+9.0 +/- 3.2% versus -5.3 +/- 5.4%, p less than 0.05). In response to a twofold increase in blood flow achieved by administering adenosine distal to the arterial segment under examination, the controls again dilated, whereas the atherosclerotic group failed to dilate (+ 11.6 +/- 2.1% versus + 0.5 +/- 2.4%, p less than 0.05). Both groups, however, were able to dilate, and dilated equally, to the nonendothelium-dependent agent nitroglycerin (+ 13.7 +/- 4.8% versus + 19.1 +/- 4.3%, NS). CONCLUSIONS. Endothelium-dependent vasodilation in response to both acetylcholine and increased blood flow may be lost early in the course of developing atherosclerosis before the appearance of stenosing and occlusive disease.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND. Platelet deposition at the site of injury caused by balloon angioplasty is associated with acute closure and restenosis. METHODS AND RESULTS. In a new ex vivo whole artery angioplasty model, we examined the roles of thrombin inhibition with D-Phe-Pro-ArgCH2Cl (PPACK) and inhibition of the platelet membrane fibrinogen receptor glycoprotein IIb/IIIa (GPIIb/IIIa) with monoclonal antibody 7E3 on platelet deposition at the site of balloon injury. Fresh rabbit aortas were mounted in a perfusion chamber. One half of the mounted arterial segment was dilated with a standard angioplasty balloon catheter and the uninjured half served as the control segment. The vessels were perfused with human blood at physiological pressure and shear rates of 180-250 second-1 for 30 minutes. Platelet deposition was measured using 111In-labeled platelets and scanning electron microscopy. With heparin (2 units/ml) anticoagulation, 8.2 +/- 2.2 x 10(6) platelets/cm2 were deposited at the site of balloon injury compared with 0.7 +/- 0.2 x 10(6) platelets/cm2 on uninjured segments (p less than 0.02, n = 7). PPACK was tested at a concentration (10 microM) that totally inhibited platelet aggregation in response to thrombin. 7E3 was tested at a concentration (10 micrograms/ml) that totally inhibited platelet aggregation. Platelet deposition at the site of balloon injury was reduced 47% by PPACK and 70% by 7E3 compared with heparin. CONCLUSIONS. At shear rates seen in nonstenotic coronary arteries, PPACK and 7E3 are more effective than heparin in reducing platelet deposition at the site of balloon injury. The significant inhibition of platelet deposition by PPACK demonstrates the importance of heparin-resistant thrombin in platelet thrombus formation. The 7E3 results suggest that approximately 70% of platelet deposition at the site of balloon injury is GPIIb/IIIa dependent and that the remaining 30% results from non-GPIIb/IIIa-mediated platelet-subendothelial adhesion. Finally, the ex vivo whole artery system is a useful model for studying platelet-vessel wall interactions under physiologically defined parameters.\r"

Microcinephotography was used to study a model of persistent truncus arteriosus created in chick embryos by ablation of premigratory neural crest destined for the third and fourth aortic arch arteries as well as the septum of the cardiac outflow tract. METHODS AND RESULTS. Twenty-five control embryos and 105 of 202 experimental embryos were filmed on day 3 of incubation and then reincubated. The remaining 97 experimental embryos were not filmed because of twisting of the embryos, but they were reincubated. There was no difference in either the survival rate (p greater than 0.23) from day 3 to day 11 of incubation or the incidence of persistent truncus arteriosus (p greater than 0.08) between the filmed and the nonfilmed embryos. Incomplete looping of the cardiac tube observed in experimental embryos during early cardiogenesis correlated with a right ventricular origin of the outflow vessels in the definitive heart. Hemodynamic measurements indicated that there was no difference in heart rate, ejection fraction, systolic and diastolic areas, stroke volume, and cardiac output between controls and the experimental group as a whole. However, embryos that did not survive to day 11 had decreased stroke volume (p less than 0.001) and cardiac output (p less than 0.001), whereas embryos that survived to day 11 with cardiac malformations had increased stroke volume and cardiac output in early embryogenesis. CONCLUSIONS. Increased stroke volume and cardiac output may be necessary factors for survival in embryos with cardiac dysmorphogenesis and probably are associated with dilation of the ventricular portion of the cardiac tube, which leads to malalignment of the outflow vessel or vessels.\r"

METHODS AND RESULTS. A ring of perfused uniform anisotropic ventricular epicardium in Langendorff-perfused rabbit hearts was created by an endocardial freezing technique. High-resolution mapping (248 channels) was used to analyze epicardial activation of the left ventricle. One to three premature beats were induced at a total of 272 points in 17 experiments (16 different points around the ring in each experiment). Reentrant VT could be initiated at 43 of the 272 points tested. The cycle length of VT was stable and ranged from 128 to 198 msec (mean, 161 +/- 19 msec). Correlation between conduction velocity and the angle between the circulating activation wave and epicardial fiber orientation showed that in segments of the ring where conduction was perpendicular to the fiber axis, mean conduction velocity was 25 +/- 5 cm/sec compared with 60 +/- 7 cm/sec when conduction was parallel to the fiber orientation. Analysis of the site of unidirectional conduction block showed that in 41 of 43 cases, block occurred while the impulse was propagating parallel to the fiber orientation. Measurement of the refractory periods at either side of the line of unidirectional block showed that only in 12 of 43 cases did block occur while the impulse was propagating into an area with a longer (more than 10 msec) refractory period. CONCLUSIONS. In uniform anisotropic ventricular myocardium, reentrant VT is initiated because lowering the stimulating efficacy of the depolarization wave by premature beats leads to preferential conduction block parallel to the fiber orientation.\r"

The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that electrical uncoupling and depression of the fast sodium channels have differential effects on propagation of the electrical impulse relative to the fiber orientation. METHODS AND RESULTS. In a model of reentrant ventricular tachycardia (VT) (mean cycle length, 144 +/- 13 msec) around a ring of anisotropic myocardium in 10 Langendorff-perfused rabbit hearts, the effects of extracellular K+ concentration [( K+]o) and heptanol were studied. [K+]o and heptanol each had a dose-dependent effect on VT cycle length. However, high [K+]o slowed the VT mainly by depressing longitudinal conduction, whereas heptanol preferentially depressed transverse conduction. The ratio between longitudinal and transverse conduction velocities progressively decreased with high [K+]o and progressively increased with heptanol. Heptanol terminated VT at a mean concentration of 3.5 +/- 0.5 mM. The cycle length before termination was 446 +/- 120 msec (p less than 0.001). In eight of 10 experiments, termination occurred by failure of conduction during transverse propagation. VT terminated at a mean [K+]o of 11.6 +/- 1.8 mM. The cycle length before termination was 493 +/- 341 msec (p less than 0.01). In seven of 10 cases, termination occurred by failure of conduction during longitudinal propagation. In the remaining five episodes (two with heptanol and three with high [K+]o), termination occurred by collision of the reentrant beat with an antidromic impulse being reflected within the ring. In a separate series of six hearts, tetrodotoxin was administered during VT. Like high [K+]o, tetrodotoxin prolonged the cycle length of the VT by preferentially slowing longitudinal conduction, and VT was terminated by longitudinal block. CONCLUSIONS. During reentrant VT, electrical uncoupling of cells by heptanol or modification of active membrane properties by high [K+]o or tetrodotoxin has a differential depressing effect on propagation of the impulse relative to the fiber orientation.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND. The precision and limitations of ventricular pacemapping as a method to localize the site of earliest breakthrough of ventricular tachycardia (VT) were investigated in a canine model of experimental myocardial infarction. METHODS AND RESULTS. Forty-one episodes of VT induced in 10 animals were mapped using a standard grid of 64 endocardial and epicardial bipolar electrodes to determine the site of earliest endocardial or epicardial breakthrough of activation during VT. Each of these 64 recording sites was also used for ventricular pacing during sinus rhythm at cycle lengths comparable to those of the VTs. Orthogonal X, Y, and Z Frank electrocardiographic (ECG) leads were recorded during all episodes of VT and ventricular pacing from all sites after the chest was closed in all animals. Surface ECG waveforms corresponding to each VT and each ventricular pacing were compared pairwise by measuring the Euclidean metric difference between the VT and ventricular pacing vectors with the orthogonal ECG leads as their X, Y, and Z components. The pacing site that generated the vector most similar to VT vector (smallest vectorial difference) was defined as the predicted breakthrough site. This predicted site of breakthrough was identical to the actual site of breakthrough determined by activation sequence mapping during VT for only nine VTs (22%). However, for an additional 27 VTs (66%), the observed and predicted breakthrough locations were at adjacent (1 cm or less apart) recording sites. For five VTs (12%), the two sites were remote, the distance between them exceeding 1 cm. CONCLUSIONS. In this model, locating the breakthrough site by pacemapping is exact in only a small minority of VTs. However, when orthogonal surface ECG leads are used for comparison, pacemapping can predict the site of earliest breakthrough during VT with a 1-cm resolution in the majority of VTs.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND. In single heart cells, abrupt changes in stimulation rate elicit complex alterations in repolarization. The effects of rate change on dispersion of repolarization, however, have not been well characterized. METHODS AND RESULTS. To determine the effects of abrupt cycle length (CL) shortening on spatial inhomogeneity of repolarization in a syncytium of ventricular cells, 124 action potentials were simultaneously recorded from Langendorff-perfused guinea pig hearts using high-resolution optical mapping with voltage-sensitive dye. The distribution of ventricular action potential durations (APDs) mapped during each cardiac cycle was used to calculate mean APD and repolarization dispersion index (DI), defined as the variance of the distribution. After abruptly shortening CL from 500 to 300 msec, mean APD declined exponentially in normoxic controls (by 23 +/- 3 msec, p less than 0.0001). This response was characterized by beat-to-beat oscillations of APD that were synchronized at all ventricular sites. After 30 minutes of hypoxia, mean APD decreased from 175.0 +/- 13.3 to 76 +/- 25.7 msec. However, during hypoxia, abrupt CL shortening lowered mean APD by only an additional 6 +/- 6 msec, and APD oscillations were no longer synchronized throughout the ventricle. In controls, beat-to-beat DI decreased significantly (-51.0 +/- 6.8%, p less than 0.01) by the sixth post-CL shortening beat and then recovered (by 15-20 beats). In contrast, DI failed to decrease during hypoxia (+7.1 +/- 23%). Two mechanisms for the transient decline of DI in controls were identified: synchronous APD oscillations and transient diminution of the apical-to-basal ventricular APD gradient. CONCLUSIONS. These data demonstrate that inhomogeneity of ventricular repolarization, as measured by DI, changes dynamically with CL shortening. Furthermore, the hypoxic ventricle does not attenuate DI after abrupt CL shortening and thereby lacks a physiological response expected to diminish vulnerability to arrhythmias.\r"

Right and left ventricular pacings were performed, and the pacing site was altered every 6 minutes. After 4 minutes of a given pacing, 54 unipolar electrograms distributed over the entire cardiac surface were recorded. Next, refractory periods at electrode sites near pacing electrodes were measured. Paired right ventricular/left ventricular (RV/LV) pacing data were obtained six or seven times in each sample. Although the QRST isoarea maps during the two activation orders were qualitatively similar, it was recognized consistently from the right ventricle-left ventricle difference map that leads around the RV free wall had positive values and that leads around the LV free wall and apex had negative values. Compared with the same leads at RV and LV pacing, QRST areas were larger when pacing sites were near the leads. The local QRST areas of individual leads at which we measured local refractory period were consistently larger during drive from proximal pacing sites than during drive from distant pacing sites. Refractory periods were consistently longer during proximal pacing than during distal pacing, and there was a positive correlation between change in local QRST area and change in refractory period (r = 0.64) during altered activation sequence, whereas there was an inverse correlation between change in QRST area and change in refractory period (r = -0.91) during localized myocardial warming. CONCLUSIONS. Both local QRST areas and local refractory periods were dependent on the activation sequence, and there was a positive correlation between QRST areas and refractory periods during various activation sequences compared with localized myocardial warming.\r"

  ".U": "91356653\r", 
  ".W": "BACKGROUND. Reuptake of norepinephrine by cardiac sympathetic nerves before and during two levels of electrical stimulation of the left ansa subclavia was estimated in anesthetized dogs from the cardiac production of dihydroxyphenylglycol (DHPG), the intraneuronal metabolite of norepinephrine. METHODS AND RESULTS. The method depended on the effects of neuronal uptake blockade with desipramine on the cardiac production of [3H]DHPG from intravenously infused [3H]norepinephrine. The ratio of the desipramine-induced decrease in the cardiac extraction of [3H]norepinephrine to the production of [3H]DHPG was used to transform the cardiac production of DHPG from recaptured norepinephrine into a rate for norepinephrine reuptake. Cardiac spillover of norepinephrine into plasma increased from 49 +/- 12 to 205 +/- 40 and 451 +/- 118 pmol/min during sympathetic activation. Cardiac DHPG production increased from 108 +/- 18 to 166 +/- 34 and 240 +/- 47 pmol/min. Desipramine decreased resting cardiac DHPG production by 20% and completely blocked the stimulation-induced increase. Thus, most (80%) cardiac DHPG produced at rest was derived from norepinephrine leaking from storage vesicles. This amount remained constant, and that derived from recaptured norepinephrine increased during sympathetic activation. The cardiac extraction of [3H]norepinephrine (126,000 dpm/min) and production of [3H]DHPG (3,790 dpm/min) were decreased by 55-57% after desipramine. Thus, only 3% of the norepinephrine recaptured by cardiac sympathetic nerves appeared in plasma as DHPG. The remainder was sequestered into storage vesicles (more than 94%) or ultimately formed metabolites other than DHPG (less than 3%). Reuptake of norepinephrine by cardiac sympathetic nerves was 1,188 +/- 476 pmol/min and increased in parallel with cardiac norepinephrine spillover to 4,182 +/- 1,982 and 6,594 +/- 2,241 pmol/min during sympathetic stimulation. CONCLUSIONS. Of the norepinephrine released by cardiac sympathetic nerves, 16-fold more was recaptured than entered plasma. Combined estimation of norepinephrine reuptake and spillover offers an approach to assess the efficiency of neuronal reuptake in disorders of cardiac function.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND. The use of flecainide and encainide was terminated in the Cardiac Arrhythmia Suppression Trial because of an excess of sudden cardiac deaths in the active treatment group. Such events might arise from reentrant rhythms initiated by premature stimulation in the presence of anisotropic sodium channel availability. Drugs that bind to sodium channels increase the functional dispersion of refractoriness by slowing (a result of the drug-unbinding process) the transition from an inexcitable state to an excitable state. It is interesting that encainide and flecainide unbind slowly (15-20 seconds), whereas lidocaine and moricizine unbind rapidly (0.2-1.3 seconds). METHODS AND RESULTS. With a computer representation of a cable with Beeler-Reuter membrane properties, we found a small (6 msec) vulnerable window that occurred 338 msec after the last drive stimulus. Premature stimuli falling within the vulnerable window resulted in unidirectional block and reentrant activation. In the presence of a slowly unbinding drug, the window was delayed an additional 341 msec, and its duration was extended to 38 msec. The delay (antiarrhythmic effect) before the onset of the vulnerable window and its duration (proarrhythmic effect) were both dependent on the sodium channel availability and the recovery process. Both effects were also prolonged when sodium channel availability was reduced by membrane depolarization. Defining the proarrhythmic potential as the duration of the vulnerable window, we found that hypothetical use-dependent class I drugs have a greater proarrhythmic potential than non-use-dependent drugs. CONCLUSIONS. The antiarrhythmic and proarrhythmic properties of pure sodium channel antagonists are both dependent on sodium channel availability. Consequently, the price for increased antiarrhythmic efficacy (suppressed premature ventricular contractions) is an increased proarrhythmic vulnerability to unsuppressed premature ventricular contractions.\r"

  ".U": "91356655\r", 
  ".W": "BACKGROUND. Myocardial stunning has been associated with a greater than twofold increase in intracellular free [Mg2+] from 0.6 to 1.5 mM. The effect of this increase in free [Mg2+] on the function of the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca2+ pump was assessed in SR isolated from Langendorff perfused, isovolumic rabbit hearts after 15 minutes of global ischemia. METHODS AND RESULTS. Our results indicate that myocardial stunning results in a shift in the Ca2+ sensitivity of oxalate-supported, Ca2+ transport over the entire range of free [Ca2+] associated with the cardiac cycle. Using 0.6 mM free Mg2+ as control, maximal rates of Ca2+ transport occurred at 1 microM free Ca2+ (control, 519 +/- 32; stunned, 337 +/- 37 nmol Ca2+.min-1.mg-1). At 0.56 microM free Ca2+, SR Ca2+ transport was reduced from a control of 351 +/- 49 to 263 +/- 12 nmol Ca2+.min-1.mg-1 at 0.6 mM free [Mg2+]. Moreover, an increase in the free [Mg2+] from 0.6 to 1.5 mM results in a greater shift in the Ca2+ activation curve with no change in the level of maximal activation. Ca2+ transport at 0.56 microM free Ca2+ was shifted in the stunned SR from 263 +/- 12 to 138 +/- 29 nmol Ca2+.min-1.mg-1 at 0.6 and 1.5 mM free Mg2+, respectively. CONCLUSIONS. These results indicate that an increase in free [Mg2+] after stunning in combination with the inherent defect in the SR Ca2+ ATPase may reduce the ability of the cell to regulate Ca2+ to a greater extent than previously observed. This impairment in Ca2+ regulatory function may contribute directly to the increase in diastolic tone and indirectly to the reduced systolic function characteristic of the stunned myocardium.\r"

To assess and compare the energy demands of normal and hypertrophic hearts, we defined the relation between myocardial oxygen consumption (MVO2, an index of the energy consumed by contraction) and the left ventricular pressure-volume area (PVA, an index of the total mechanical energy generated by contraction) in eight normal and eight hypertrophic (aortic band model) dog hearts; MVO2 was also measured in the nonworking (empty beating) and basal (potassium arrest) states. METHODS AND RESULTS. The hearts were studied in an isolated, blood-perfused heart apparatus. The slope of the MVO2-PVA relation (the inverse of which reflects myofibrillar efficiency) was similar in normal and hypertrophic hearts (3.89 +/- 1.91 and 4.19 +/- 1.25 ml O2/mm Hg.ml.10(5), p = NS). The MVO2 in empty beating (0.038 +/- 0.006 and 0.041 +/- 0.015 ml/beat/100 g, p = NS) and potassium-arrested (1.95 +/- 0.06 and 1.98 +/- 0.20 ml/min/100 g, p = NS) hearts was likewise similar in the two groups. CONCLUSIONS. Basal and nonworking energy demands and working efficiencies of hypertrophic hearts are equivalent to those of normal hearts.\r"

  ".U": "91356657\r", 
  ".W": "BACKGROUND. Vasomotor reactivity may contribute to the pathophysiology of ischemic injury. The atherosclerotic vessel may be particularly susceptible to vasoconstriction because of the damaged endothelial layer with resultant loss of vasodilatory factors. While dietary omega 3 fatty acids have been proposed to protect against vascular occlusion, it is not clear to what extent this results from alterations in the function of platelets or from changes intrinsic to the blood vessel itself. METHODS AND RESULTS. The effects of dietary supplementation with fish oils on vascular contractility were examined in endothelialized and de-endothelialized aortic rings under pre- and postanoxic conditions. De-endothelialization was defined functionally by the loss of acetylcholine-induced vasodilation in norepinephrine-preconstricted aortic rings from rats fed normal rat chow. Three groups of rats were fed diets containing either 20% menhaden oil or 20% beef tallow, both supplemented with 3% corn oil or 23% corn oil for longer than 4 weeks. All animals received vitamin E. Under well-oxygenated conditions, de-endothelialized aortic rings from rats fed fish oil and corn oil contracted to similar extents with norepinephrine and vasopressin and less than rings from rats fed beef tallow. Endothelialized (intact) and de-endothelialized rings from rats fed fish oil relaxed more in response to acetylcholine than rings from rats fed beef tallow and corn oil. After anoxic exposure and reoxygenation, KCl-induced contraction of intact rings from rats fed fish oil and corn oil was similar and less than rings from rats fed beef tallow. Intact and de-endothelialized rings from rats fed fish oil relaxed more to acetylcholine than did rings from rats fed beef tallow and corn oil. CONCLUSIONS. Under preanoxic or postanoxic conditions, rings from rats fed fish oil and corn oil contracted less than rings from rats fed beef tallow. The relaxation response to acetylcholine, however, was greater in rings from rats fed fish oil than from rats fed either corn oil or beef tallow. These vascular effects of fish oil feeding may result in increased blood flow to ischemic and reperfused tissues in vivo.\r"

Sensitivity and specificity of qualitative visual Tl-201 scintigraphy for detection of coronary artery disease average 84% and 87%, respectively. Quantitative analysis of planar Tl-201 scintigrams has yielded sensitivity and specificity in the 90% range. Single photon emission computed tomographic imaging is associated with even higher sensitivity but with specificity in the 82-85% range. Perfusion defects representing ischemia can now be distinguished from scar by demonstration of delayed Tl-201 redistribution or enhanced uptake after reinjection of a second dose of Tl-201. Stenoses of the left circumflex coronary artery are less easily detected than lesions of the right and left anterior descending coronary arteries. False-positive Tl-201 perfusion defects may occur as a result of attenuation artifacts, most often caused by overlying breast tissue or by a high left hemidiaphragm. Patient motion during acquisition of single photon emission computed tomographic images results in artifactual defects on reconstruction. Abnormal Tl-201 uptake has been noted in patients with 1) left bundle branch block and normal coronary arteries, 2) hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and 3) progressive systemic sclerosis.\r"

Single photon emission computed tomography improves the detection and quantification of infarct size, and its use with new radiopharmaceuticals will assume an important role in future trials. For an 8-year period, these radionuclide techniques have been used in the Western Washington Thrombolysis Trials and have generally shown smaller infarct size and higher ejection fractions in patients receiving streptokinase and tissue-type plasminogen activator. However, in the most recent trial there was no direct relation between these end points and the time between symptom onset and initiation of treatment. Future trials that direct efforts to treatment in the first hour after symptom onset should further clarify this observation.\r"

  ".W": "With the introduction of the coronary care unit and more effective therapy for primary life-threatening arrhythmias, cardiogenic shock and the mechanical complications of acute myocardial infarction are now responsible for the majority of in-hospital deaths. These mechanical complications, which include myocardial rupture of the left ventricular free wall, rupture of the ventricular septum, and rupture of the papillary muscle, are estimated to account for 25,000 fatalities yearly in the United States. Although the mechanism of myocardial rupture has not been clearly defined, there is increasing evidence that infarct expansion, which can be readily detected by two-dimensional echocardiography, may be an important pathophysiologic factor. The ready availability of echocardiography in the coronary care unit has made a major impact on the immediate diagnosis of mechanical complications in the hemodynamically compromised patient with acute myocardial infarction. In particular, two-dimensional and Doppler echocardiographic techniques have been extremely useful in the identification and localization of ventricular septal rupture. In addition, papillary muscle rupture can be readily diagnosed by Doppler approaches and is easily distinguished from ventricular septal rupture. In view of increasing evidence that early surgical intervention is indicated in these patients, these echocardiographic approaches offer the surgeon prompt diagnostic and anatomic information. Unfortunately, rupture of the free wall of the left ventricle often results in sudden death within minutes before echocardiographic evaluation can be attempted. Nevertheless, rapid echocardiographic diagnosis provides the patient with the possibility of potential life-saving resuscitative interventions before immediate surgery. Thus, over the past decade, echocardiography has become a vital tool in the diagnosis and evaluation of patients with mechanical complications of acute myocardial infarction. The development of Doppler techniques, color flow Doppler, and esophageal approaches should further enhance our diagnostic abilities and allow careful monitoring of patients before, during, and after surgical repair. It is hoped that with the improvements in echocardiographic evaluation of mechanical rupture and more rapid surgical intervention, future studies will demonstrate better surgical results with good long-term survival in patients with myocardial rupture.\r"

Detection of reversible dysfunction and distinction from irreversible tissue injury by positron emission tomography is based on identification of preserved or even enhanced glucose metabolism with F-18 2-fluoro 2-deoxyglucose. Regional patterns of myocardial glucose utilization and blood flow, defined as perfusion-metabolism mismatches or matches, on positron emission tomography in patients with chronic or even acute ischemic heart disease are highly accurate in predicting the functional outcome after interventional revascularization. Compared with thallium-201 redistribution scintigraphy, positron emission tomography appears to be diagnostically more accurate, especially in patients with severely impaired left ventricular function. While larger clinical trials are needed for further confirmation, positron emission tomography has already proved clinically useful for stratifying patients with poor left ventricular function to the most appropriate therapeutic approach.\r"

  ".W": "Dipyridamole 201Tl imaging has been proposed as an alternative to exercise ECG testing for the prehospital discharge evaluation of patients recovering from myocardial infarction. The rationale is that many postinfarction patients with exercise-induced ischemia experience later cardiac events, and the sensitivity of predischarge exercise ECG testing in patients with multivessel disease ranges from only 45% to 62%. In addition, several groups of investigators have shown the sensitivity of submaximum exercise 201Tl imaging to be less than ideal. This report summarizes the current status of dipyridamole 201Tl imaging in the period of 1-13 days after myocardial infarction. Although the number of studies performed to date is limited, the following conclusions can be drawn: dipyridamole 201Tl imaging after myocardial infarction was associated with no serious side effects, and those present could be quickly reversed with aminophylline; redistribution with dipyridamole 201Tl images definitely correlates with prognosis after uncomplicated myocardial infarction; dipyridamole 201Tl imaging is definitely useful in patients unable to exercise for a variety of reasons; and future studies are definitely indicated to further define the role of dipyridamole 201Tl imaging for assessing prognosis, especially in those patients undergoing interventional therapy after acute myocardial infarction.\r"

  ".W": "Numerous highly complex and sensitive noninvasive imaging techniques have enhanced the care of patients with acute myocardial infarction. Optimum use requires specific objectives to be defined in advance, including a review of the potential impact of the test on subsequent decisions. An additional issue that is subject to scrutiny in the current climate of cost containment relates to the incremental value of a specific examination. The imaging modality to be used will partially depend on other issues, including accessibility, cost, and interindividual or institutional expertise with a particular technique. Major applications in noninvasive imaging in the acute coronary syndromes include the following: 1) diagnosis, including identification of associated diseases and contraindications for acute reperfusion; 2) evaluation and management of complications (mechanical and nonmechanical); 3) determination of prognosis (both early and late); 4) estimation of myocardial viability; 5) assessment of therapeutic efficacy; 6) investigational approaches, including 99mTc-sestamibi tomographic imaging, ultrafast cine computed tomographic scanning, and nuclear magnetic resonance imaging. Previous studies in the prethrombolytic era have documented the powerful impact of radionuclide stress testing on prognosis, but this needs to be reevaluated in the light of the changing current population undergoing stress testing. Preliminary data imply that the prognostic accuracy of stress testing after thrombolytic therapy is diminished. Moreover, the role of the open infarct-related artery in traditional estimates of prognosis (e.g., ejection fraction) requires further study. Noninvasive imaging has multiple applications in the diagnosis and management of patients with acute coronary disease, but the decision to use a specific technology in a particular circumstance mandates good clinical judgment and selectivity.\r"

  ".W": "Although exercise ECG testing has been shown to have important prognostic value after acute myocardial infarction, exercise 201Tl scintigraphy offers several potential advantages, including: 1) increased sensitivity for detecting residual myocardial ischemia; 2) the ability to localize ischemia to a specific area or areas subtended by a specific coronary artery; 3) the ability to identify exercise-induced left ventricular dysfunction, which is manifested by increased lung uptake or transient left ventricular dilation; and 4) more reliable risk stratification of individual patients. The more optimal prognostic efficiency of 201Tl scintigraphy partially results from the fact that the error rate in falsely classifying patients as low risk is significantly smaller with 201Tl scintigraphy than with stress ECG. Because of these substantial advantages, there seems to be adequate rationale for recommending exercise perfusion imaging rather than exercise ECG alone as the preferred method for evaluating mortality and morbidity risks after acute myocardial infarction.\r"

The addition of cardiac imaging modalities to exercise testing has augmented this capacity. Exercise echocardiographic imaging before and immediately after treadmill exercise can be accomplished in 85-95% of patients. New or worsening wall motion abnormalities identify 63-80% of patients who will suffer cardiac events and correctly predict 78-95% of those who will not. In addition, exercise echocardiography can detect multivessel coronary artery disease with a sensitivity of 80% and a specificity of 90%. These results are superior to those obtained by analyzing global left ventricular function during exercise, exercise aortic Doppler velocity profiles, or exercise electrocardiography. How exercise echocardiography compares with 201Tl perfusion imaging after myocardial infarction awaits a systematic study. Therefore, the choice between exercise echocardiography and perfusion imaging depends on physician preference, availability, cost, and service.\r"

Radionuclide ventriculography is well suited for noninvasive assessments of resting and exercise ventricular function after acute myocardial infarction. The prognostic importance of resting left ventricular function after acute myocardial infarction is well established. Several studies have reported the prognostic utility of submaximal exercise radionuclide ventriculography at the time of hospital discharge. Patients with globally depressed left ventricular function after acute myocardial infarction are at increased risk for cardiac death, while patients with normal resting ventricular function but abnormal function during exercise appear to be at risk for nonfatal ischemic events. The development of gated tomographic techniques and new radiopharmaceuticals will make available more accurate and detailed assessments of ventricular function and combined assessments of function and perfusion. These new developments require further investigation but appear to be promising new techniques with the potential for providing improved assessments of prognosis after acute myocardial infarction.\r"

In patients with uncomplicated myocardial infarction the assessment of symptoms, physical findings, and ECG changes during predischarge exercise testing often identifies patients at increased risk for further cardiac events. Because of the suboptimum sensitivity and specificity of the exercise ECG for detecting myocardial ischemia, myocardial perfusion imaging with 201Tl and/or assessment of global and segmental ventricular function by two-dimensional echocardiography or radionuclide cineangiography during or immediately after exercise are often added to the predischarge risk stratification.\r"

The presence of valve stenosis and associated regurgitation is based on detecting abnormal intracardiac velocity patterns near the affected valve. Defining the specific valve involved and the type of lesion present is based on determining the location and timing of the abnormal velocities. Both color flow imaging and duplex pulsed Doppler with two-dimensional echocardiographic imaging are highly accurate in identifying the lesions present. Quantification of the severity of stenotic lesions requires calculation of the pressure gradient across the valve and estimation of valve area; quantification of volume flow rate is frequently helpful. The pressure gradient is calculated from high velocity data acquired in the stenotic valve orifice by using the Bernoulli equation. Volume flow rate through the valve can be estimated by using Doppler velocity data and two-dimensional echocardiographic imaging data acquired at sites upstream from the stenotic valve. The continuity equation allows calculation of valve area that is based on this noninvasive stroke volume and pressure gradient data. This review characterizes flow patterns present near stenotic valves, discusses the equations required to quantify aortic and pulmonic stenosis, and then describes the clinical approach to the noninvasive quantification of both stenotic lesions.\r"

In mitral stenosis two-dimensional echocardiographic imaging allows definition of leaflet anatomy and dynamics, subvalvular disease, ventricular function, and involvement of other valves. Spectral and color Doppler echocardiographic techniques permit accurate measurement of transvalvular gradient, determination of functional orifice area, evaluation of associated valvular regurgitation, and assessment of pulmonary artery pressures. These approaches are of recognized clinical value, and they provide additional diagnostic information that is unavailable from clinical assessment alone in a significant number of patients. Compared with available invasive diagnostic standards of reference, echocardiographic data have been found to be comparable in accuracy. In tricuspid stenosis echocardiographic imaging and Doppler techniques provide an assessment of valve morphology and function that should be similarly useful in clinical management decisions, although rigorous comparative studies have not been performed. Currently, carefully done echocardiographic studies are a definitive means of establishing the presence and significance of mitral stenosis and tricuspid stenosis, thereby obviating the need for invasive evaluation in many patients, reducing risk, and potentially decreasing the cost of diagnostic assessment.\r"

Regurgitation is recognized as a signal void in the high intensity blood pool on these images. Mitral regurgitation causes a signal void in the left atrium in systole, and aortic regurgitation produces one in the left ventricle in diastole. The specificity, sensitivity, and diagnostic accuracy of cine GRE for the detection of mitral and aortic regurgitation was greater than 0.93, 0.89, and 0.92, respectively. The severity of regurgitation has been quantified as the difference in the stroke volume between the two ventricles by measuring the volume of the blood pool, as shown in the stack of magnetic resonance tomograms. Severity has also been assessed by measuring the volume of the signal void. Finally, measurements of the volume of aortic regurgitation have recently been achieved by using velocity-encoded cine GRE. This technique provides a direct measurement of retrograde flow in the aorta during diastole. New cine GRE imaging techniques provide a noninvasive means for quantification of valvular as well as ventricular function.\r"

In many circumstances, such abnormalities related to impaired relaxation or reduced distensibility may precede evidence of left ventricular systolic dysfunction. Radionuclide angiography may be adapted to study the rapid filling phase of diastole, the duration of the isovolumic relaxation phase, the relative contributions of rapid filling and atrial systole to left ventricular stroke volume, and the relation between regional nonuniformity of left ventricular function and global filling properties. Technical aspects of data acquisition that must be considered for such studies include the effects of cardiac cycle length fluctuations, temporal resolution, temporal smoothing, and normalization parameters. As noninvasive radionuclide methods (and any other analyses using purely noninvasive techniques) do not permit assessment of the left atrial-left ventricular pressure gradient or the simultaneous evaluation of changes in left ventricular pressure and volume during relaxation and filling, complete clinical interpretation of \"abnormal\" left ventricular filling indexes, or changes in these indexes after interventions, is not possible. Despite the inherent limitations of noninvasive assessment of left ventricular diastolic function, radionuclide evaluation of left ventricular filling may provide clinically useful insights, especially in patients with congestive heart failure symptoms and normal left ventricular systolic function.\r"

NMR approaches will probably be most useful in patients with chronic valvular regurgitation, in which there continues to be uncertainty regarding the optimum timing for surgical intervention. In these patients it is possible to simultaneously assess both the valvular regurgitation and the resulting changes in myocardial structure and function. In patients with aortic stenosis, NMR can be applied to the assessment of left ventricular mass, both before and after valvuloplasty or valve replacement. In mitral stenosis, NMR may be applied to the assessment of right ventricular volumes and function. NMR may be used for the detection of prosthetic valve regurgitation when Doppler studies are equivocal. Finally, NMR imaging may be applied in patients with congenital or aortic root disease to evaluate valvular function in addition to diagnostic assessment of such patients. The future development of isotropic three-dimensional acquisition approaches, ultrafast imaging strategies, automated surface detection techniques, and more rapid function and flow analysis could considerably enhance the use of the current NMR approaches. The application of spectroscopic techniques could provide a means of monitoring myocardial metabolic abnormalities in ventricles exposed to chronic overload. Meanwhile, in patients with valvular regurgitation and stenosis, it would seem timely to initiate long-term serial NMR studies to further define natural history and the effects of various medical regimens and to ultimately help determine optimum medical and interventional regimens.\r"

Doppler/2DE has made possible an understanding of the mechanism of increase in valve area. Before the procedure, Doppler/2DE provides a reasonable estimate of the severity of the valvular stenosis and associated cardiac abnormalities. The evaluation of mitral valve morphology by 2DE before catheter balloon treatment has shown that patients with excellent leaflet motion and minimal increase in valve thickness have the greatest increase in mitral valve area. During the procedure, Doppler/2DE can aid in the transseptal puncture, in positioning the balloons across the stenotic orifice, and in the immediate assessment of changes in valve function and complications. The estimate of the aortic and mitral valve gradients and areas by Doppler/2DE before catheter balloon treatment shows a reasonable correlation with hemodynamic measurements. Immediately after the procedure, the Doppler/2DE estimates of aortic valve gradient and area show a fair correlation with data from cardiac catheterization, provided care is taken to avoid technical problems. Doppler/2DE assessment of mitral valve area immediately after catheter balloon commissurotomy (CBC) shows a poor correlation with catheterization data, which has been attributed to rapid changes in left atrial compliance and gradient. However, the correlation of Doppler estimates of mitral valve area with catheterization data improves at 3 months after CBC. Serial evaluations of patients after aortic or mitral catheter balloon dilatation should permit detection of restenosis and valve regurgitation and assessment of ventricular function and may provide valuable insights into the mechanisms of restenosis and changing clinical status.\r"

Traditionally employed procedures for intraoperative assessment of the adequacy of repair, such as fluid injection into the arrested ventricle for assessment of valve leakage, measurement of atrial pressure and height of V-waves, and palpation of the atria for the presence of systolic thrills, have not proved to be reliable approaches in the intraoperative evaluation of mitral and tricuspid regurgitation and in the assessment of the adequacy of repair procedures. Intraoperative color Doppler, using either the epicardial or the transesophageal approach, offers rapid and accurate information about the presence and severity of mitral regurgitation at the time of surgery. This technique provides instantaneous evaluation of the adequacy of mitral and tricuspid valvuloplasty and appears capable of predicting postoperative outcome. Intraoperative color Doppler is useful for evaluation of the adequacy of repair before chest closure and may thus help to avoid the need for reoperation. This approach may ultimately allow valve repair procedures to be performed in greater numbers of patients with better control over outcome and with lower reoperation rates.\r"

We now have a wealth of noninvasive techniques capable of imaging the heart and the great vessels. With Doppler echocardiography and magnetic resonance imaging we are beginning to develop methods that can measure pressures and flow. All of these advances have duplicated to a large extent the information obtainable in the past only from cardiac catheterization and angiography. In some instances, in aortic and mitral stenosis, for example, echo-Doppler evaluation is so good that catheterization is rendered unnecessary. The decision to send patients to surgery without catheterization is especially secure when the valvular obstruction is very severe. When the gradient is only moderately increased, then estimation of severity depends on flow, and in many cases these patients are sent to catheterization before surgery is recommended. With regurgitant lesions there is less confidence with noninvasive techniques that the severity is always correctly estimated, and therefore catheterization and angiography are more often necessary before sending the patient to surgery. At the present time cardiac catheterization and angiography are required 1) whenever there is an inconsistency between the clinical picture and noninvasive information, for example, the symptomatic patient with aortic stenosis who has mild-to-moderate aortic stenosis by echo-Doppler techniques, and 2) whenever additional information not obtainable by noninvasive techniques is necessary, for example, the need to know the status of the coronary arterial circulation. Noninvasive techniques have not in any way replaced a good history and physical examination.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

However, the delineation of derangements of regional perfusion and metabolism have been accomplished only relatively recently with positron emission tomography (PET). Regional myocardial accumulation and clearance of 11C-palmitate, the primary myocardial substrate under most conditions, demonstrate marked spatial heterogeneity when studied under fasting conditions or with glucose loading. PET with 11C-palmitate permits the noninvasive differentiation of patients with nonischemic from ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy, since patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy demonstrate large zones of intensely depressed accumulation of 11C-palmitate, probably reflecting prior infarction. Patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and Duchenne's muscular dystrophy demonstrate relatively unique patterns of myocardial abnormalities of perfusion and metabolism. The availability of new tracers and techniques for the evaluation of myocardial metabolism (11C-acetate), perfusion (H2(15)O), and autonomic tone (11-C-hydroxyephedrine) should facilitate further understanding of the pathogenesis of the cardiomyopathies.\r"

  ".W": "Fab fragments of antibodies specific for cardiac myosin have been labeled with indium-111 and injected intravenously into animals and into patients with heart transplants. The antibodies, developed by Khaw, Haber, and co-workers, localize in cardiac myocytes that have been damaged irreversibly by ischemia, myocarditis, or the rejection process. After clearance of the labeled antibody from the cardiac blood pool, planar imaging or single photon emission computed tomography is performed. Scintigrams reveal the uptake of the labeled antimyosin in areas of myocardium undergoing transplant rejection. In animal studies, the degree of antimyosin uptake appears to correlate significantly with the degree of rejection assessed at necropsy. In patients, the correlation between scans and pathologic findings from endomyocardial biopsy is not as good, possibly because of sampling error in the endomyocardial biopsy technique. The scan results at 1 year correlate with either late complications (positive) or benign course (negative). Current limitations of the method include slow blood clearance, long half-life of indium-111, and hepatic uptake. Overcoming these limitations represents a direction for current research. It is possible that from these efforts a noninvasive approach to the diagnosis and evaluation of cardiac transplantation may evolve that will decrease the number of endomyocardial biopsies required to evaluate rejection. This would be particularly useful in infants and children.\r"

  ".W": "Recently, considerable effort has been directed toward the application of Doppler methods for detecting diastolic dysfunction. Recordings of transmitral filling velocity as obtained from pulsed-wave Doppler have been extensively investigated as a noninvasive method for determining left ventricular diastolic filling properties. Although Doppler parameters appear to reflect volumetric transmitral flow, close correlations with invasive descriptors of diastolic performance have not been found. Furthermore, Doppler transmitral velocities are sensitive to changes in ventricular preload, afterload, and heart rate. However, at least two distinct Doppler spectral patterns have been identified that are associated with impaired ventricular relaxation and restrictive physiology. Thus, Doppler recordings have proven to be of value in identifying the presence and type of diastolic dysfunction, and in the future they may be helpful in following the response to therapeutic interventions. The purpose of this paper is to review the available information relating Doppler transmitral recordings with catheterization and clinical descriptors of diastolic function. Additionally, the aim is to provide an understanding of the value and limitations of these noninvasive measurements in identifying and treating patients with diastolic abnormalities.\r"

  ".W": "Left ventricular systolic function is an important determinant of long-term prognosis in patients with chronic aortic regurgitation. In patients undergoing aortic valve replacement, those with preoperative left ventricular dysfunction have a greater risk of postoperative congestive heart failure and death than do those in whom preoperative left ventricular systolic function is normal. However, patients with preoperative left ventricular dysfunction are not a homogeneous group but may be further stratified according to risk on the basis of the severity of symptoms, exercise intolerance, and temporal duration of left ventricular dysfunction. Therefore, asymptomatic patients with reproducible and definite evidence of impaired left ventricular function should undergo operation without waiting for the development of symptoms or more severe left ventricular dysfunction. In addition, among asymptomatic patients with normal systolic function, indexes of left ventricular function are also helpful, especially when measured serially, in predicting the development of symptoms and the need for valve replacement surgery over the course of the next 5 to 10 years. Noninvasive imaging techniques should play a major role in this evaluation, and radionuclide angiography is ideally suited for the quantitative evaluation of systolic function in the volume-overloaded left ventricle. Although the prognostic value of left ventricular ejection fraction at rest is well established, ejection fraction during exercise has little value once age and left ventricular function at rest are accounted for and is of minor importance in formulating patient management decisions.\r"

  ".W": "Echocardiography and Doppler ultrasound are useful in evaluating a variety of pathological conditions affecting the pericardium. Cardiac tamponade results in right atrial collapse and right ventricular diastolic collapse detectable by echocardiography. These echocardiographic signs have a high degree of sensitivity and specificity. False-negative echocardiographic studies may be seen in patients with pulmonary hypertension, and false-positive studies for cardiac tamponade may occur in severe hypovolemia. Although cardiac tamponade is usually caused by pericardial effusion, less commonly intrapericardial clot may result in hemodynamic compromise. Pericardial clot may be echogenic, and hence the diagnosis potentially can be missed. If the intrapericardial clot is localized, the classic echocardiographic signs of pericardial effusion may be absent, and a localized mass may be seen on the echocardiogram. Increased respiratory variation in transvalvular blood flow velocities detectable by Doppler ultrasound is found in cardiac tamponade. Doppler ultrasound studies may be particularly useful in those patients in whom the characteristic echocardiographic abnormalities are absent. Both M-mode and two-dimensional echocardiography may be useful in diagnosing pericardial thickening. Constrictive pericarditis results in a variety of echocardiographic abnormalities including pericardial thickening; biatrial enlargement with good left ventricular function; a diastolic septal bounce; and a dilated inferior vena cava without significant respiratory variation. Doppler echocardiographic abnormalities are commonly found in constrictive pericarditis. Echocardiography is also useful as a guide to performing pericardiocentesis and in the detection of pericardial adhesions and pericardial metastases.\r"

The lack of radiation exposure makes it particularly advantageous for patients requiring serial studies. It serves as an important clinical adjunct to ultrasound in evaluating diseases of the abdominal aorta, other great vessels, the myocardium, and the pericardium. Myocardial function, thickness, and mass can be assessed without geometric assumptions. Myocardial tagging offers a unique way to study cardiac biomechanics. The combination of anatomic and quantitative functional information becoming available in clinically reasonable acquisition times makes magnetic resonance imaging an increasingly attractive noninvasive tool. The contribution of tissue characterization has been disappointing, but may improve with utilization of contrast agents; that of in vivo spectroscopy remains investigational.\r"

Such tools must permit accurate measurement of the amount of myocardium that is initially at risk. 99mTc-sestamibi is a new radiopharmaceutical with unique properties that are well suited to the measurement of myocardium at risk without any delay in acute therapy. Tomographic imaging with this agent has been shown to provide accurate quantitative estimates of the myocardium at risk, which varies widely, even for patients with a similar coronary occlusion. For example, there is more than a threefold range in myocardium at risk for patients with a nonproximal occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery. The determination of the myocardium at risk before intervention and the change in this region after intervention constitute a promising measurement tool for the assessment of the effect of acute therapy. Initial studies with tomographic imaging have shown a significant improvement in a group of patients treated with thrombolysis, although the magnitude of improvement is highly variable in individual patients. Qualitatively similar results have been reported with planar imaging. Although it has a number of technical limitations, sequential imaging with 99mTc-sestamibi seems to have a clear advantage over those end points that have previously been used to assess acute therapy. This new measurement tool should facilitate future clinical trials of different treatments in acute myocardial infarction.\r"

Its accuracy for detecting coronary artery disease is high enough to allow for clinical use. In such a role it has added value to the analysis of the routine electrocardiogram and symptoms during exercise. In the patient unable to exercise, pharmacological stress with the use of dobutamine or dipyridamole are realistic alternatives.

During a 6 1/2-year period, beginning in January 1978, 2,042 consecutive patients underwent radionuclide angiocardiography, with a clinical diagnosis of coronary artery disease, at Duke University Medical Center. A subgroup of 318 patients who underwent surgical myocardial revascularization near the time of initial study were excluded from later analysis. Clinical follow-up information was complete in a group of 1,663 patients who did not undergo interventional therapy. The 141 cardiac deaths in these 1,663 patients were the study end point. Cox proportional hazards models analyzed the prognostic information contained in three clinical variables (pain type, age, and sex) and three radionuclide angiocardiogram variables (exercise ejection fraction, resting end-diastolic volume, and change in heart rate with exercise). One-variable models confirmed the prognostic importance of each of these six variables. A multivariable model in which all six variables were used showed clinical variables to contain only 5% and the radionuclide variables 95% of the prognostic information. The exercise ejection fraction was the single most important variable, which alone contained 85% of the total information in the model. Curves relating probability of no cardiac death to the exercise ejection fraction identified a value of 0.50 as an inflection point. Patients with exercise ejection fractions below 0.50 demonstrate a probability of cardiac death that increases as the ejection fraction decreases.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Echocardiography at rest and exercise, combined with Doppler and color flow imaging, are properly applied to the differential diagnosis of common clinical syndromes in ischemic heart disease, the identification of the proximal coronary arteries, and the effects of ischemia and prior infarction. Subsequent use of coronary arteriography partially depends on the philosophy regarding the applicability of coronary surgery or angioplasty in an individual patient.

Both agents allow assessment of ejection fraction by the first-pass technique at rest or during exercise, thus providing additional information not available with thallium-201. 99mTc-Sestamibi has long myocardial residence time, as well as adequate myocardial extraction, providing images of higher count density and superior quality compared with thallium-201. 99mTc-Teboroxime has excellent myocardial uptake characteristics but is cleared very rapidly from the myocardium. Both tracers have shown results similar to those obtained with thallium-201 for detection of coronary artery disease and the assessment of defect reversibility. 99mTc-Sestamibi studies using the rest/stress imaging sequence can be accomplished in approximately 5 hours; studies using dual-isotope imaging (rest thallium-201 and stress 99mTc-Sestamibi injection) can be completed in 1 to 2 hours. Gated stress images can be performed with 99mTc-Sestamibi, providing simultaneous information of myocardial perfusion at stress and resting wall motion or thickening and allowing rapid differentiation of ischemic from infarcted tissue. Because of its slow myocardial clearance and absence of redistribution, 99mTc-Sestamibi allows uncoupling of the time of injection from the time of imaging and thus can be valuable in the evaluation of acute myocardial infarction and outcome of thrombolytic therapy. With 99mTc-Teboroxime, rapid serial studies are feasible.

This conclusion results from an awareness of CT's capacity to solve the fundamental limitation of all forms of x-ray imaging--the superimposition of anatomic structures. Because CT is potentially a fully three-dimensional method, this problem is addressed in a manner not subject to the risks, complications, and technical limitations of selective angiography, subtraction angiography, tomography, and other techniques. Ultrafast CT provides a broad spectrum of useful quantitative cardiac data during one minimally invasive procedure. Therefore, the optimism for cine CT imaging of the heart is well founded. Apart from the demonstration of anatomic structures in any reconstructed plane and in movie format, without the need for any form of electrocardiographic gating, this new generation of millisecond CT scanners offers a unique potential for measuring myocardial mechanics and perfusion. Myocardial integrity can be evaluated by measuring myocardial wall thickening, which is a sensitive indicator of blood flow. It can also be assessed by time-density changes derived from analyzing the passage of contrast medium through thin slices of myocardium. Feasibility studies have demonstrated that this should be possible in the clinical setting by use of fast CT scanning. The radiation exposure to the patient with cine CT is low and comparable to, or less than, that of conventional CT and 10-15% of that received during angiocardiography; therefore, it is not a practical limitation. Further clinical and research studies are needed to determine the future role of this exciting new modality in the diagnosis and management of patients with heart disease.\r"

We also hypothesized that because the absence of RWMA would probably not be associated with AMI, the use of two-dimensional echocardiography would significantly limit unnecessary hospital admissions. To test these hypotheses, we undertook a prospective study that used two-dimensional echocardiography in 180 patients presenting to the emergency room with symptoms suggestive of AMI. The emergency room physicians were not informed of the two-dimensional echocardiography findings, and their decision to admit or not admit to the hospital was based on conventional clinical and electrocardiographic criteria. Forty patients were not admitted to the hospital and 140 were admitted. Of the 30 patients with enzyme-confirmed AMI, nine had typical ST elevation on the ECG that was consistent with acute injury, three had normal ECGs, and eight had ECGs in the presence of which AMI could not have been diagnosed (left bundle branch block, paced rhythm, or repolarization changes); the rest had nonspecific ECG findings. Of the 29 AMI patients with technically adequate two-dimensional echocardiography studies, two did not demonstrate RWMA and 27 had RWMA, compared with nine with diagnostic ECG changes (p less than 0.001).

  ".W": "Rest and exercise radionuclide angiography is frequently employed for the diagnosis of chest pain syndromes. Its value and limitations in this regard have been well studied, but proper utilization of the technique requires an understanding of five critical concepts: 1) Radionuclide angiography is superior to treadmill exercise testing and probably equivalent to thallium scintigraphy, although the published series did not use current methods. 2) The true specificity of radionuclide angiography is about 80%, intermediate between the early optimistic estimates and the later pessimistic ones. 3) The peak exercise ejection fraction is the preferred test parameter for diagnosis, although exercise hemodynamics, symptoms, and electrocardiographic changes should also be considered. 4) Although radionuclide angiography is clearly helpful for noninvasive diagnosis, significant numbers of patients will continue to fall in an uncertain category. 5) The proper application of the technique requires recognition of its limitations and careful attention to technical details. When properly applied, this modality can make an important contribution to clinical decision making.\r"

In the second stage of the study, the efficacy of preventive chemotherapy after radical surgery was studied in 55 patients. The five-year disease-free survival rate was 34.4%. In the third stage of the study, the efficacy of combination therapy consisting of preoperative treatment, limb-saving surgery, and preventive chemotherapy was studied in 66 patients. The five-year disease-free survival rate was 35.5%. The authors examined results in 21 patients with Grade IV responses to evaluate the relationship between prognosis and morphogenic changes after preoperative radiotherapy and chemotherapy. The five-year disease-free survival rate was 57.9%. In the fourth stage of the study (conducted in 1986), two regimens of preoperative chemotherapy were initiated. The first regimen consists of intraarterial platinum infusions to patients with lower extremity bone damage. The second regimen consists of high-dose methotrexate infusions. The preliminary conclusion is that primary tumor damage is significantly more marked after intraarterial cisplatin infusion.\r"

Twenty cases treated in this way between May 1983 and May 1989 are reviewed. There were 18 Stage IIB osteosarcomas and two Stage IIB malignant fibrous histiocytomas. Chemotherapeutic effect was evaluated in the resected tumors. There was little correlation between the clinical response to the induction chemotherapy and cell necrosis present in the resected tumor mass. Wide resection margins were achieved in 17 cases, a minimal margin in two, and a contaminated margin in one. Radiotherapy was used in these three cases where resection margin was in doubt. There were two local recurrences in these three cases. Four patients have died of their disease, and there was one treatment-related death.

Progressive pain is an important clinical feature in both conditions. Careful roentgenographic studies demonstrate cortical destruction and a soft-tissue mass in virtually all patients. Metastasis was present in 25% of both groups of patients at presentation. In contrast to previous series, more than 80% of the patients with postirradiation osteosarcoma had had irradiation for malignant entities and more than 70% had been treated with modern radiotherapy regimens (cobalt-60 or linear accelerator). Twice as many patients with postirradiation osteosarcoma were evaluated and treated in the 1980s than in the previous decade. The initial indication for irradiation often was carcinoma of the breast, uterus, or cervix, or lymphoma. Two-thirds of the patients had progressive disease that was not controllable within six months after diagnosis. Early detection may be the only effective means of improving survival with postirradiation or Paget's osteosarcoma. These patients require lifelong follow-up evaluations.\r"

The group as a whole may be referred to by a single descriptive term that emphasizes their common site of origin and underscores their malignant osteogenic potential: surface osteosarcoma. Its biologic heterogeneity may be approached via a number of avenues. Detailed description of individual tumors and grading are frequently employed. However, implementation of a classification system based upon reproducible clinical, roentgenographic, macroscopic, and histologic parameters is advantageous. The suggested classification system serves to clearly define parosteal and periosteal osteosarcoma, as well as recognize unusual variants. Most important, it defines therapeutic strategy. The classification system identifies low-grade, biologically indolent forms (i.e., parosteal osteosarcoma and periosteal osteosarcoma) that are best treated by surgery alone. At the same time, it recognizes high-grade forms with significant potential for life-threatening behavior (i.e., 'dedifferentiated' parosteal osteosarcoma and high-grade surface osteosarcoma) that are best managed by multimodality therapy incorporating chemotherapy and surgery.\r"

In two patients, a new planning strategy was applied using three-dimensional reconstruction. There were two chondrosarcomas, three Ewing-sarcomas, two osteosarcomas, and two metastases of thyroid cancer. Excision was wide, marginal, and intralesional in three cases each. Ages ranged from eight to 68 years (average, 40 years), and follow-up periods ranged from 12 to 36 months with an average of 27 months. Overall functional evaluation was good in five cases, fair in three, and poor in one. Four patients died of local recurrences and lung metastases; all of them had marginal or intralesional resections. Histologic analysis of one retrieved specimen revealed bone ingrowth with connective tissue interface. Three-dimensional planning has proven to be a very valuable tool for achieving an anatomic reconstruction of the pelvic ring. These results are encouraging and endorse the authors to continue with the current approach of prosthetic reconstruction following Type IIC resections.\r"

The major differences are age of onset, with dogs being affected in middle age; greater frequency in the dog, with over 8000 new cases per year; and time to metastasis being faster in the dog than man.

Using propidium iodide and a home-built flow cytometer, the authors have studied the DNA distribution in 95 patients with osteosarcoma and determined the percentage of cells in diploidy, S-phase, tetraploidy, and aneuploidy. Using these values and a derived one, mean DNA concentration, it was possible to demonstrate the extent of the abnormalities observed in this group of neoplasms and show their severity as compared with the normal pattern. When the data are compared against disease-free survival and total survival, correlations were noted that, although weak, suggested that some patterns were predictive of increased risk of metastasis and death. The effect of treatment could also be assessed by evaluating the pattern before and after chemotherapy and correlating these with survival. It seems likely that with some improvement in technology, flow cytometry will be of value in the future in assessing the prognosis for osteosarcoma and predicting whether treatment has been effective.\r"

  ".W": "Limb preservation is increasingly being employed in the local treatment of high-grade extremity osteosarcoma. Bone allografts used to reconstruct the bony defects following tumor resection offer many advantages, including joint reconstruction and incorporation of the graft to the host bone in these relatively young patients. The results of 53 patients 30 years of age or younger were assessed to determine functional outcome. Fresh-frozen allografts were employed as osteoarticular grafts, allograft-arthrodeses, allograft-prosthesis composites, or intercalary grafts. Follow-up intervals averaged 25 months (range, two to 63 months). Life-table analysis showed that the probability of a satisfactory functional result was 73% if local tumor recurrences were excluded. Complications included 16 infections, six fractures, 12 nonunions, and six unstable joints. There were five local recurrences. Eighteen grafts ultimately failed, and in six patients, this resulted in an above-knee amputation. An additional five received a second graft. The functional \"end results\" of the 38 patients with two or more years of follow-up examinations were 70% satisfactory in those without a local recurrence. There was no statistically significant difference in functional outcome or local or distant relapse in those patients receiving preoperative chemotherapy. The authors conclude that allografts can be used for limb reconstruction in patients with high-grade osteosarcoma who receive aggressive adjuvant chemotherapy. The functional results are comparable to other methods of reconstruction, and once incorporated by the host, offer the advantage of longevity, compared with metallic implants.\r"

Twenty-eight of the 78 patients treated with endoprosthetic reconstruction experienced 30 complications (36%). Mechanical failure was the most common complication (10%) but was generally correctable. The local recurrence rate was 5% and the infection rate was 3%. Local complications were manageable.

The tumor types were osteosarcoma (17), malignant fibrous histiocytoma (three), leiomyosarcoma (one), and malignant schwannoma (one). Surgical stages were IIA (three), IIB (17), and IIIB (two). The prechemotherapy surgical options chosen were 12 amputations (55% of patients) and ten LSPs (45%). The initial decisions to amputate were based on a combination of the following: improper biopsy (five cases), large tumors (ten) and those with neurovascular encroachment (six), and pathological fracture (one). Following chemotherapy, 18 LSPs (81%) and four amputations (19%) were performed. Nine of 12 patients (75%) initially deemed unresectable were converted to LSP. The median tumor response (necrosis; range, 0%-100%) was 70%; ten of 22 specimens had necrosis greater than 95%. Median tumor necrosis for the patients treated by amputation and LSPs was 45% and 88%, respectively. Following surgery, all patients received four additional cycles of cisplatin and doxorubicin. The median follow-up period is 30 months; six patients have developed metastatic disease, with a median disease-free interval of 16.6 months. The rate of local tumor control is 95% (21 of 22 patients).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The outlook for patients with nonmetastatic high-grade osteosarcoma has improved dramatically since 1972. Updated results of the single-agent adjuvant (postoperative) chemotherapy trial project a five-year disease-free survival (DFS) of 42% (95% confidence interval [CI], 14% to 70%) with follow-up periods of 5.7 to 13.8 years compared to a two-year DFS of 78% (60% to 95%) and follow-up periods of 0.6 to 6.8 years with six-agent, alternating, adjuvant postoperative chemotherapy. Additionally, since limb-salvage surgery began to be offered in 1976 to selected patients, 36 of 74 patients (49%) have had limb-salvage operations performed. The two-year DFS is 69% (52% to 85%) for patients having limb-salvage operations with follow-up periods of 0.6 to 10.3 years compared to 72% (57% to 87%) for amputees with follow-up periods of 0.3 to 10.3 years. It is concluded that patients receiving limb-salvage operations appear to be at no greater risk for relapse than patients receiving cross-bone amputation and that the administration of alternating, multiagent, adjuvant chemotherapy has significantly improved the DFS for patients who present with nonmetastatic high-grade osteosarcoma.\r"

The concept of an expandable adjustable prosthesis addresses the problem of leg-length discrepancy. The problem of prosthesis longevity will require further long-term evaluation of current designs and methods of fixation, as well as the development of a permanent prosthesis or biologic replacement. At skeletal maturity, the expandable prosthesis may either be maintained or substituted with another implant or biological alternative if warranted by the clinical situation.\r"

Salvaging of the limb with allogeneic or prosthetic replacement results in a shortened limb with functional limitations. Arthrodesis yields a stiff and shortened limb. The so-called growing prosthesis has a high complication rate and is still unproven. However, rotationplasty has been successfully used as a reconstructive technique following resection of these types of tumors in the skeletally immature patient. A limb with normal sensation and proprioceptions, adequate range of motion, and without leg-length discrepancies, functional limitations, or painful neuroma is to be expected. Although a prosthesis must be worn, these patients are active and participate in unrestricted physical activity. Cosmetic acceptance has not been a problem and complications are minimal. Thus, rotationplasty requires only a single operation and results in a highly functional limb.\r"

Both the RB1 gene and p53 have been proposed to act as tumor-suppressor genes, suggesting that, in this instance, tumorigenesis is the result of the loss of gene function of these two genes, rather than a gain of function.\r"

  ".W": "Pulmonary metastases are the primary cause of death from bone and soft-tissue sarcoma. Recognition that even multiple resections of metastases can improve survival has led to a more aggressive surgical approach to these patients. The authors instituted an aggressive approach and a new technique and retrospectively analyzed the results of multiple, pulmonary metastasectomies for pulmonary metastases in 34 patients, 21 of whom had osteogenic sarcoma (OGS). A number of cases were referred from other institutions, where they had been considered inoperable because of extensive or recurrent disease. Using lateral thoracotomies, laser technique with minimal parenchymal excision, and thin gloves for palpation, aggressive metastectomy was carried out. A mean of 3.1 thoracotomies were performed, with an average of 10.6 nodules resected per thoracotomy. Operative morbidity and mortality were minimal. Evaluation of potential prognostic factors revealed no statistically significant survival difference on the basis of disease-free interval (DFI), number of nodules resected, number of thoracotomies, or size of largest nodule resected. There was a clear trend toward decreased survival of patients with larger nodules (greater than 2 cm), but because of the small number of patients in this group, no firm conclusions can be drawn. Five-year survival was 49% for the study group as a whole, and 39% for the OGS patients. Aggressive surgical resection of pulmonary metastases from bone and soft-tissue sarcoma should be considered when there is control of local disease, no evidence of extrapulmonary metastasis, and adequate postresection pulmonary reserve. The presence of bilateral, extensive, or recurrent disease is not a contraindication to thoracotomy.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Following limb salvage, the incidence of morbidity increases with a few patients occasionally requiring prolonged or repeated hospitalizations and further surgical procedures, even amputation. The durability of the reconstructions is variable, and many of the mobile knee reconstructions may need to be revised if the patients become long-term survivors. The function of salvaged limbs is better than that after the alternative amputation, but none of the reconstructions will give normal function. Finally, no matter which type of surgery on the lower extremity is selected, patients will have a good early psychosocial adjustment if no premorbid psychosocial disorder is present.\r"

Eight of 23 osteosarcoma cases (35%) showed structural alterations of the Rb gene. Three of the eight demonstrated homozygous deletions, and the remaining five cases showed heterozygous deletions. Seven out of eight cases represented deletion of a 7.5-kb HindIII fragment. Northern blot analysis of five cases of osteosarcoma showed that four demonstrated no detectable Rb gene transcription, and one case had a truncated 3.5-kb fragment with a faint 4.7-kb band. In the other 34 cases of bone and soft-tissue tumors, two cases of three malignant fibrous histiocytomas showed an Rb gene abnormality by Southern blot analysis. These results strongly suggest that Rb gene alteration is pertinent to the tumorigenesis of most osteosarcoma cases and some other bone and soft-tissue tumors.\r"

A total of 698 students (362 girls and 336 boys aged nine to 12 years) were followed for three years to study their growth in the pubertal period and changes in spinal status. Every six months measurements were taken of body height and the development of secondary gender characteristics was recorded. The onset of the adolescent growth spurt could thus be detected in each child. When children with and without scoliosis were compared, it became evident that scoliotic children grew faster. Girls whose scoliosis developed from a previously normal body posture showed a peak height velocity (PHV) of 8.1 cm per year, whereas girls with a normal body posture throughout the pubertal stage had a PHV of 7.1 cm per year. The most rapid growth spurt was observed in Stages 2 and 3 of breast and pubic hair development. Simultaneously, the most frequent spinal status changes occurred in Stages 2 and 3 of sexual maturity; they were twice as frequent as in Stage 1 and four times as frequent as in Stages 4 and 5. Students in whom scoliosis developed in puberty during the adolescent growth spurt grew faster than their peers who did not develop scoliosis, which need not imply that they will eventually be taller after growth is completed.\r"

The data were analyzed statistically using survival analysis (Cox model). The six months mortality rate was 20% and the one year mortality rate was 28%. The following factors, in order to decreasing importance, had significant influence on mortality: cardiac factors other than previous myocardial infarction; status as a nursing home patient; chronic pulmonary disease; serum creatinine level greater than 1.7 mg/100 ml; pneumonia; previous myocardial infarction; duration of surgery; and gender. The following factors had no significant influence on mortality: age, time delay from admission to surgery, mode of anesthesia, and cerebrovascular diseases. In conclusion, medical conditions were the most important determinants of survival in the present study. The time delay between admission and surgery did not influence the chances of survival. This does not mean that surgical delay beyond that essential for stabilizing the patient is not problematic, but indicates that ample time should be spent on assessment and resuscitation before surgery.\r"

Therefore, the research on etiology and on the understanding and rating of oncologic power of the tumoral cells as well as other kinds of treatment (vaccine, immunotherapy, and other types of chemotherapy) must be increased. The initial function after replacement is good and is often excellent but increasing deterioration is noticed during each follow-up evaluation. A considerable effort is still to be done for bone and joint replacement. Biocompatible material with mechanical strength and resistance to wear will be used for a long time because of the young age of the patients. There must be better use and understanding of the allograft revascularization, as well as a better biologic connection between the bone host and replacement device. This will probably be used in the future with less cement and more of a modular system. The final prognosis will remain for a long time in the perfect cooperation between the various members of the teams (oncologist, surgeon, imager, pathologist, and research team) who treat the patients.\r"

  ".W": "Ninety-two patients with IIB osteosarcoma of the extremities were treated with intraarterial (IA) cisplatinum (CDDP) followed by surgery [amputation (61.6%) or resection with endoprosthesis (38.4%)]. Postoperative chemotherapy alternating adriamycin and CDDP was used. The total three-year survival was 62.1%, and the disease-free survival was 41.1%. The pathologic evaluation of the degree of tumor necrosis in response to the IA CDDP showed that in 53.2%, the necrosis was over 90%. The multivariate analysis of prognostic factors has shown that the highest survival was among females with tumors smaller than 15 cm. Patients with lesions equal to or larger than 15 cm were three times as likely to die of the disease. A second, more aggressive study is now underway, in which high dose methotrexate (HDMTX) is preoperatively combined with adriamycin and CDDP. Following operation, ifosfamide is added to the cases with a smaller degree of tumor necrosis, while the other group of patients will continue with HDMTX, in addition to CDDP and adriamycin (these last two drugs are used in both arms). Until now, complete remission has been achieved in 82% and 86%, respectively, with a follow-up examination varying from four to 26 months (average, 14 months). This is of extreme importance, because the majority of the authors' patients have tumors at initial evaluation larger than 10 cm in diameter.\r"

This is due to improvements in diagnostic imaging techniques, staging, adjuvant chemotherapy, and surgical treatment. Five-year survival rates have increased from 25% to 80%. En bloc resection is currently possible. This makes reconstructive procedure justified, both from an oncologic and orthopedic view. Many questions are still unanswered, concerning evaluation of tumor necrosis because of chemotherapy, optimal adjuvant therapy, functional evaluation of different types of reconstruction, and psychological development of the patient. An international gathering of data on the overall treatment of IIB osteosarcoma is advocated to find answers on the above-mentioned questions. A noninvasive adjustable-lengthening prosthesis is mentioned as a Dutch solution to leg-length discrepancy. This prosthesis can be used after limb-saving surgery in young children.\r"

Twenty-five of the 55 cases in the authors' series were treated by limb-salvage surgery, 27 by amputation, and the remainder by chemotherapy. In all 226 cases from the three institutes, 106 were treated by amputation and 120 by limb-salvage surgery. Two local recurrences (4%) were found in the authors' series, three in the Osaka series, and eight in the Chiba series. Five-year accumulative survival rates in this study showed some differences, depending upon the institution or upon the protocol employed: in the authors' series it was 60% overall and 68% for a stronger chemotherapy group; in the Osaka series, it was 50% in a mild chemotherapy group and 72% in an intensive chemotherapy group; and in the Sapporo series, it was 36% and 73%, respectively. This study showed that local control of IIB osteosarcoma was successfully achieved by preoperative adjuvant chemotherapy and wide resection, and that an intensive chemotherapeutic combination of high-dose methotrexate, cisplatinum, and doxorubicin is promising.\r"

The authors' investigations have increased the authors' knowledge of chemotherapy for osteosarcoma, the differential efficacy of currently used agents, and the pronounced schedule dependency and relative route independency of their efficiency. The authors were able to confirm the prognostic significance of tumor response after preoperative chemotherapy. Preoperative chemotherapy in itself has facilitated and promoted limb-salvage surgery. Also, more patients can be cured today by use of aggressive thoracic surgery in case of primary or secondary pulmonary metastases. The authors' efforts to steadily increase metastasis-free survival rates by intensifying chemotherapy in this series of studies, however, have been only moderately successful. Still, chemotherapy-related acute toxicity is considerable and increases with aggressiveness of treatment, and the manifestations of late toxicity may continue to increase with follow-up time. Future trials should be targeted toward exploration of the minimum indispensable amount of toxic treatment yielding comparable or even better results than those currently attainable.\r"

  ".W": "The Multi-Institutional Osteosarcoma Study (MIOS) was designed to determine whether intensive multiagent adjuvant chemotherapy improves the outcome of patients with nonmetastatic high-grade osteosarcoma of the extremity as compared with concurrent controls. After definitive surgery of the primary tumor, patients were randomly assigned to immediate adjuvant chemotherapy or to observation without adjuvant treatment. Updated results of this trial indicate that the projected six-year event-free survival for the control group is 11% compared to 61% for the chemotherapy group (p less than 0.001). Similar results were observed in patients who declined randomization but who were followed according to the treatment arms of the protocol. When randomized and nonrandomized patients are pooled according to assigned treatment, a survival advantage favoring those patients treated with immediate adjuvant chemotherapy is apparent. An analysis of prognostic factors among patients receiving immediate adjuvant chemotherapy reveals that elevation of the serum lactic dehydrogenase at diagnosis is the factor most predictive of adverse outcome. Location of the primary site in the tibia confers a favorable prognosis. The authors conclude that the natural history of high-grade osteosarcoma of the extremity has not changed over the past two decades. The administration of immediate adjuvant chemotherapy has a significant favorable impact on event-free survival and should be recommended for all such patients.\r"

  ".W": "Between September 1986 and December 1988, 125 patients with osteosarcoma of the extremities entered the second neoadjuvant study at the authors' institution. Patients received preoperatively two cycles of methotrexate (MTX) intravenously, followed by cisplatinum (CDP) intraarterially, plus adriamycin (ADM) intravenously. After surgery, the patients classified as \"good responders\" (more than 90% tumor necrosis) received ADM, MTX, and CDP, while the \"poor responders\" (less than 90% tumor necrosis) had a longer chemotherapy that included ifosfamide and etoposide (VP-16) in addition to MTX, ADM, and CDP. Limb salvage was possible in 85% of patients, 8% had an amputation, and 7% had a rotationplasty. The surgical margins were adequate (radical or wide) in 88% of cases and inadequate (marginal or intralesional) in 12%. At an average follow-up period of 28 months (range, 13 to 41), 109 patients (87%) remained continuously disease free, 15 (12%) relapsed with pulmonary metastases, and one patient (0.8%) had a local recurrence. Compared with the first neoadjuvant study at the authors' institution that used only MTX and CDP preoperatively, the percentage of limb salvages, \"good responders,\" and continuously disease-free survival at two years was significantly higher in the second Rizzoli neoadjuvant study (85%, 74%, and 87% versus 77%, 52%, and 59%). Systemic toxicity because of chemotherapy was superimposable. A retrospective analysis of the real dose intensity for each patient demonstrated a correlation between the intensity of chemotherapy and prognosis.\r"

Preoperatively, the patients received high-dose methotrexate (HD-MTX) and cisplatinum (CPD) (HD-MTX/CPD) and doxorubicin. CPD was delivered intraarterially, the other drugs intravenously. Limb-salvage surgery was performed in 12 instances, and five patients were treated with amputation. Postoperative chemotherapy was tailored according to the grade of chemotherapy-induced necrosis. In 13 cases (86%), the resultant grade of necrosis was greater than 90% (good responders). The mean follow-up interval was 3.5 years with a range of 18 to 78 months. Fourteen patients (82%) remained continuously disease-free, while three patients developed lung metastases. Two of these died because of uncontrolled disease, whereas the third patient is alive and disease-free after metastasectomy. No local recurrences were observed. These results are better than those observed in 215 contemporary cases of conventional osteosarcoma treated with the same protocols. This study confirms that TOS is not a uniformly lethal tumor as suggested by prior reports. By employing neoadjuvant chemotherapy, a high percentage of patients with TOS can be cured, and in most of them, a limb-sparing surgery is possible and safe.\r"

DESIGN: Prospective, randomized clinical trial. SETTING: A clinical immunology ward at the center for internal medicine in a university hospital. PATIENTS: Fifty-five patients with septic shock were randomly allocated to two groups according to criteria of septic shock. INTERVENTION: One group of patients (n = 27) received a commercially available immunoglobulin preparation (containing high titers of antibodies specific for determinants to bacterial endotoxin) during the first 3 days after inclusion in the study. The other randomized group (n = 28) did not receive any immunoglobulin preparation. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: During the period of less than or equal to 6 wks after the beginning of clinically apparent septic shock, death related to the septic process occurred in one (4%) of 27 patients who received immunoglobulin. By comparison, nine (32%) of 28 control group patients died during this period (p less than .01). Within the first 48 hrs after onset of the clinically apparent septic process, significantly increased activity of circulating endotoxin and simultaneously decreased specific IgG serum titers to lipid A were detected in the group of nonsurvivors.

SETTING: Critical care unit at a university medical center. PATIENTS: Twelve patients with sepsis syndrome requiring hemodynamic monitoring with pulmonary artery catheters. Seven patients were diagnosed with pulmonary infections and five patients had intra-abdominal infections. INTERVENTIONS: Fatty acid hydroperoxide was measured in the fresh arterial plasma (radial artery) and mixed venous plasma (pulmonary artery) from each patient. Hydroperoxide was determined using a sensitive assay based on activating the cyclooxygenase reaction of prostaglandin H synthase. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The mean difference between the amount of fatty acid hydroperoxide measured in the plasma draining involved regions (arterial plasma for pulmonary sepsis, mixed venous plasma for intra-abdominal sepsis) compared with the paired, uninvolved regions was 0.45 +/- 0.14 microM (mean +/- SEM; p less than .005). CONCLUSIONS: Increased lipid hydroperoxides in blood-draining septic foci are markers of oxyradical release associated with severe infection, although they are not specific for infectious conditions, being released also from nonseptic regions of surgical trauma. Assays for hydroperoxides may be useful when relatively free of other tissue trauma.\r"

SETTING: Medical ICU of a university hospital. PATIENTS: Eight patients treated by ventilatory support for neurologic or neuromuscular diseases. INTERVENTIONS: Patients were investigated on two occasions: during normoventilation (pH 7.42 +/- 0.1, PCO2 41 +/- 2 torr [5.5 +/- 0.2 kPa]) and during respiratory alkalosis (pH 7.59 +/- 0.1, PCO2 27 +/- 2 torr [3.6 +/- 0.2 kPa]) induced by controlled hyperventilation. To evaluate lactate elimination kinetics, 1 mmol/kg body weight of L-lactic acid was infused over 5 mins. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Arterial lactate concentrations and blood gas values were determined before and repeatedly after the infusion. Lactate elimination variables were calculated from the plasma curve by using a two-compartment model. Respiratory alkalosis increased plasma lactate from 1.56 +/- 0.1 to 2.49 +/- 0.2 mmol/L (p less than .001). The lactate elimination half-life increased from 4.57 +/- 0.2 mins at pH 7.42, to 9.96 +/- 1.1 mins during pH 7.59 (p less than .01), and beta half-life increased from 12.2 +/- 1.9 to 44.1 +/- 1 mins (p less than .01). Whole-body clearance decreased 40% from 24.2 +/- 2.9 to 14.3 +/- 2.0 mL/kg body weight-min (p less than .01). CONCLUSIONS: Respiratory alkalosis increases the basal concentration of plasma lactate and decreases clearance of infused lactic acid. These findings provide further evidence of the adverse effects of alkalosis.\r"

The purpose of this study was to further describe a group of patients who developed prolonged weakness after treatment with these agents. DESIGN: Clinical information, electrodiagnostic and muscle pathology results are described in this group of patients. Clinical information includes diagnoses, dosage of neuromuscular junction blocker, other medications affecting the neuromuscular system, and neuromuscular examination and clinical course. SETTING: All patients were seen in the ICUs of three local hospitals. PATIENTS: Included were critically ill patients with a variety of diagnoses, all of whom developed severe weakness after discontinuation of neuromuscular junction blocking agents. INTERVENTIONS: Electrodiagnostic studies and muscle biopsies were performed on several of the patients. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: All patients had pronounced weakness without sensory loss. Electrodiagnostic and muscle pathology findings were consistent with failed neuromuscular transmission. Although many patients had disorders or were taking medications that can injure the neuromuscular system, no disorder or medication was common to all. Recovery of strength often took several months and most patients were slow to wean from mechanical ventilator support. CONCLUSIONS: Although alternative explanations cannot be excluded with certainty, the use of neuromuscular junction blocking agents may lead to neurogenic atrophy and care must be taken when using them.\r"

SETTING: ICU and operating theater. SUBJECTS: Forty-three mechanistically ventilated patients in the ICU or undergoing cardiothoracic surgery in whom a pulmonary arterial catheter was in situ. INTERVENTIONS: LV preload was a) increased from hypovolemic states (pulmonary arterial occlusion pressure [PAOP] less than 8 mm Hg) by fluid challenge, b) decreased from normovolemic states (PAOP 10 to 15 mm Hg) by either iv nitrates or intravascular fluid loss, and c) decreased from heart failure or fluid overload states (PAOP greater than 20 mm Hg) by iv nitrates. No other maneuver was performed concurrently. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Descending aortic blood flow was measured by an esophageal Doppler transducer. Corrected flow time was calculated by dividing systolic flow time by the square root of the cycle time. PAOP and corrected flow time increased after fluid challenges in hypovolemic states, and decreased when LV preload was decreased from normovolemic states. However, when preload was decreased from overload states, PAOP always decreased, but the corrected flow time usually increased before any subsequent decrease. The greatest value of corrected flow time corresponded with the maximal stroke volume seen. CONCLUSIONS: Esophageal Doppler measurement of aortic blood flow can be used for rapid, noninvasive optimization of LV filling in mechanically ventilated patients.\r"

MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Ascending aortic blood flow was measured by the suprasternal Doppler approach allowing calculation of waveform variables of stroke distance and minute distance (linear measures of stroke volume and cardiac output), peak velocity, mean acceleration and flow time corrected for heart rate. An index of systemic vascular resistance was obtained by dividing mean systemic BP by the minute distance. Inotropic changes predominantly affected peak velocity and mean acceleration. Changes in preload mainly affected the flow time corrected for heart rate, whereas afterload changes had an intermediate effect. Unsuspected but subsequently confirmed hemodynamic effects were seen with esmolol and metaraminol.

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE: To assess the frequency and mortality rates of septic shock in ICU patients and the clinical course of multiple organ failure associated with septic shock. DESIGN: Retrospective case survey. SETTING: Tertiary care center. PATIENTS: During a 2-yr period, 2,469 consecutive intensive care patients were studied regarding the frequency and hospital mortality rates of septic shock. A subset of 1,311 patients was further analyzed for the occurrence of organ system failures within 48 hrs of the onset of septic shock and again 4 to 7 days later. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The frequency rate of septic shock was 1.9% (n = 48), with a mortality rate of 72.9% (n = 35) in patients with septic shock. Deaths due to septic shock represented 14.6% of all deaths in the ICU during the study period. Eighteen patients died within 72 hrs of the onset of septic shock. Refractory hypotension was the cause of death in 15 of these 18 patients. Beyond 72 hrs, multiple organ failure accounted for eight of 17 deaths. The mean +/- SD number of organ systems failing at 48 hrs was 3.3 +/- 1.3 in survivors and 4.0 +/- 1.1 in nonsurvivors, and at 4 to 7 days was 2.1 +/- 1.5 in survivors and 4.0 +/- 1.5 in nonsurvivors (p less than .05). None of the specific organ system failures had prognostic value. The number of organ system failures was not related to the duration of hypotension, but had a weak correlation (r2 = .26, p less than .05) with the duration of vasoactive treatment at 4 to 7 days. The prolonged need for norepinephrine therapy was associated with an increased occurrence of renal failure. Thirty (62.5%) patients had positive blood cultures and a mortality rate similar to the mortality rate of patients with negative blood cultures. Patients with negative blood cultures died more often with hypotension (p less than .02). CONCLUSIONS: Septic shock is a major cause of death in intensive care patients. Refractory hypotension is a main cause of early deaths. Later on, multiple organ failure becomes the primary clinical problem and cause of mortality.\r"

DESIGN: Retrospective chart review. SETTING: A university hospital medical ICU. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We reviewed medical records of 86 patients admitted to the medical ICU over a 2 1/2-yr period of time, for 107 consecutive episodes of serious acute upper GI bleeding. Clinical features of patients who developed respiratory complications of pneumonia, witnessed aspiration of gastric contents, or who required intubation and mechanical ventilation for other reasons were compared with those features of patients without respiratory complications. MAIN RESULTS: Respiratory complications occurred during 23 (22%) serious upper GI bleeding episodes (mean transfusion requirement, 7 units of packed RBCs). Twelve patients developed pneumonia and all had evidence of advanced liver disease. Five patients were observed to aspirate gastric contents and six patients require intubation and mechanical ventilation for reasons other than pneumonia or aspiration. Esophageal sites of bleeding (esophagitis, esophageal ulcers and esophageal varices), advanced liver disease, age greater than 70 yrs, and an Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II score greater than 13 appeared to be risk factors. Mortality rate was increased in patients with respiratory complications: 70% of patients with respiratory complications died, compared with 4% of those patients without such problems (p less than .001). CONCLUSIONS: Respiratory complications are common in critically ill medical patients with serious acute upper GI bleeding, and are associated with a poor outcome. Risk factors include advanced liver disease, esophageal site of bleeding, age greater than 70 yrs, and higher APACHE II score.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to alert critical care physicians to the syndrome of obstructive sleep apnea with respiratory failure (\"near miss\" death) and to elucidate characteristics that might allow earlier recognition and treatment of such patients. DESIGN: We examined clinical and laboratory characteristics of eight patients with obstructive sleep apnea presenting to the ICU with respiratory failure. These characteristics were compared with those of eight stable apnea patients of similar severity but without a history of presentation with respiratory failure. SETTING: Medical ICU and pulmonary outpatient clinic at the Houston Veterans Administration Medical Center, a teaching hospital affiliated with Baylor College of Medicine. PATIENTS: Eight patients with obstructive sleep apnea who presented in, or developed, acute respiratory failure requiring tracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation were matched to eight stable obstructive sleep apnea outpatients from the chest clinic. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The records of these 16 patients were reviewed and multiple characteristics that might predict these obstructive sleep apnea patients prone to respiratory failure and death (called the \"near miss\" death group; n = 8) were examined. The mean age of the near miss group was 57 yrs. All eight patients presented with respiratory acidosis (mean pH 7.22), hypercarbia (mean PaCO2 82 torr [10.9 kPa]), and hypoxemia (mean PaO2 45 torr [6.0 kPa]). Six of the eight patients had concomitant chronic obstructive pulmonary disease as determined by clinical characteristics and spirometry. Predisposing factors included facial trauma, lower respiratory tract infections or bronchospasm, and use of pain medication. All but one of the near miss subjects had awake hypercarbia (mean PaCO2 49 torr [6.5 kPa]) and hypoxemia (mean PaO2 58 torr [7.7 kPa]) during periods of clinical stability while only two controls had concomitant chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and none had hypercarbia. The prevalence of a history of wheezing and prior hospitalization for \"respiratory problems\" were greater in the near miss group. Once cured of apnea, no patient presented with recurrence of respiratory failure in follow-up ranging from 6 to 80 months, and cor pulmonale recurred in only one patient during subsequent onset of central apneas. CONCLUSION: Patients with obstructive sleep apnea who have concomitant chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or hypercarbia and hypoxemia are more prone to develop severe respiratory failure and probable death than those patients with apnea alone. The current study shows that recurrent respiratory failure and presumably mortality from this acute complication can be reversed with effective treatment of the obstructive apnea.\r"

The six scoring systems tested were: Multiorgan Failure; the Acute Organ System Failure; the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE II); the Multisystem Organ Failure scoring system; the Mortality Prediction Model; and the grading of sepsis. DESIGN: Retrospective, case series, consecutive sample. SETTING: Adult ICUs of three teaching hospitals. PATIENTS: Seventy-one patients from 12 to 84 yrs, fulfilling specific criteria for the diagnosis of septic shock, who were admitted to the ICU during 15 consecutive months. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The Multiorgan Failure scoring system, Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE II), and Acute Organ System Failure scoring system were found, with our modifications, to be statistically significant predictors of mortality. Predictive data for these three scoring systems were as follows: Multiorgan Failure scoring system p = .008, mean number of points of survivors 5.2 +/- 1.5 (SD), mean number of points of nonsurvivors 6.3 +/- 1.5; APACHE II p = .013, mean number of points of survivors 21.1 +/- 5.9, mean number of points of nonsurvivors 24.6 +/- 6.0; and Acute Organ System Failure scoring system p = .011. None of the other three scoring systems showed significant predictive ability: Multisystem Organ Failure scoring system p = .072, Mortality Prediction Model p = 0.091, and the grading of sepsis p = .27. There was a significant (p = .004) difference in the survival rate of the three hospitals. CONCLUSION: The Multiorgan Failure scoring system, APACHE II, and the Acute Organ System Failure scoring system, with minor modifications, were found to be useful prognostic tools for patients with septic shock and allowed us to compare the performance and treatment programs of different ICUs.\r"

Our objective was to define this symptom complex and attempt to delineate its etiology. DESIGN: Retrospective chart review. SETTING: A pediatric ICU in a children's oncology hospital. PATIENTS: Children admitted to the ICU over a 24-month period who developed persistent bradycardia (heart rate less than 5% for age for greater than 1 hr) after an episode of sepsis. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Seven children developed postsepsis bradycardia. Six patients had a primary diagnosis of acute myelogenous leukemia and one patient had acute lymphocytic leukemia. All patients had positive blood cultures (Streptococcus mitis, n = 4; Escherichia coli, n = 2; and Klebsiella pneumoniae, n = 1). All seven children were clinically recovering from sepsis when the bradycardia developed. Neither hypotension nor other symptom was associated with the bradycardia. No therapy was given for the bradycardia. Echocardiograms and ECGs were normal in all patients, except for the presence of bradycardia. Bradycardia persisted for 24 to 72 hrs. After that time, heart rates slowly increased to the normal range for age. CONCLUSIONS: We speculate that this syndrome may result from alterations in beta-adrenergic receptor function or an unidentified humoral factor produced by the invading organism or as part of the host's response to sepsis. Prior drug therapy or the underlying illness may predispose to this condition, since all the patients had acute leukemia. As the bradycardia was clinically insignificant, invasive therapeutic or diagnostic strategies were not indicated.\r"

ANIMALS: Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats. INTERVENTIONS: Experimental endocarditis, pyelonephritis, or peritonitis were caused. Controls included free-fed rats and sham-operated rats, pair-fed to infected animals. Infection was verified by tissue culture. Rats were killed 3 days (acute infection) or 10 days (chronic infection, except endocarditis) after the induction of infection. RESULTS: Sham rats had lower liver weights, liver/body weight, and liver glutathione values than controls. Infected rats had larger liver weights and liver/body weight ratios and liver glutathione content than shams, and larger liver/body weight ratios than controls (acute infection). Infected rats had lower P450 values than both shams and controls. CONCLUSION: The malnutrition associated with infection caused decreased liver weight and glutathione content. Infection increased the liver weight, and liver glutathione content, but caused severe reduction in liver P450. If the same finding is true in infected patients, it could have consequences for the management of such patients.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND AND METHODS: During liver transplantation, reperfusion of the donor liver and in the clinical setting, end-stage liver disease, have occasionally resulted in profound cardiovascular disturbances. The etiology of hepatic injury-induced myocardial dysfunction is still unclear. In this study, the aims were to develop an experimental model that would facilitate the study of the effects of hepatic failure on myocardial function and to determine whether hepatic ischemia or anoxia and reperfusion injury of similar duration would result in the same degree of hepatic failure. Seventy male Sprague-Dawley rats were used as organ donors. Three simultaneous liver-heart perfusions (corresponding to three groups) were established using a modified Krebs-Henseleit buffer with 2% bovine albumin, membrane oxygenation, and a peristaltic pump. Group 1 (n = 10) and group 2 (n = 15) experiments consisted of liver-heart perfusions after 90 mins of normothermic hepatic ischemia or 90 mins of hepatic anoxia, respectively, followed by reoxygenation and 60 mins of reperfusion. Group 3 (n = 8) experiments consisted of sham liver-heart perfusions studied over the same experimental time period (60 mins). Myocardial function variables, liver function tests, arterial blood gases, and electrolytes were measured at baseline and at 3-, 10-, 30-, and 60-min intervals during reperfusion in all experiments. RESULTS: Ischemia or anoxia-induced hepatic failure resulted in a similar degree of hepatic dysfunction. Both forms of acute hepatic failure caused significant increases in liver function tests, a reduction in heart rate (p less than .05), coronary flow (p less than .05), and an increase in calculated coronary vascular resistance (p less than .05). There were no changes in buffer pH, CO2, or ionized calcium that could explain the coronary vasoconstriction. CONCLUSIONS: Hepatic dysfunction induced by ischemia or anoxia of similar duration results in a similar hepatic metabolic profile during reperfusion and can cause direct myocardial dysfunction of the isolated perfused rat heart.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND AND METHODS: We postulated that low-dose heparin (10 IU/kg.hr) administered as a continuous iv infusion may prevent or ameliorate the induction of thrombin-induced disseminated intravascular coagulation in baboons under general anesthesia. In a nonrandomized experiment lasting 8 hrs, animals were divided into three groups: 11 received thrombin only (group A); ten were pretreated with heparin before thrombin administration (group B); and 15 received heparin 2 hrs after disseminated intravascular coagulation was induced with thrombin (group C). All animals were monitored hemodynamically and coagulation tests were performed hourly. Tests included the following: one-stage prothrombin ratio; activated partial thromboplastin time; fibrinogen and fibrin degradation products; thrombin time; plasma fibrinogen level; antithrombin III and activated clotting time. After the acute phase of the experiment, the animals were observed for 6 days and a postmortem examination was performed on a survivor of each group. RESULTS: Six (55%) group A animals died within 6 days, while there were no deaths in group B and one animal (7%) died in group C. In group C, the administration of heparin could not normalize the clotting profile, but the mortality rate was significantly less than in group A. The prophylactic administration of heparin in group B prevented the induction of disseminated intravascular coagulation. The postmortem findings were of interest, but no statistically valid conclusions could be made, as only one autopsy was done for each group. However, the results suggest that heparin pretreatment may protect against lung edema and liver necrosis. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that heparin, in a dose of 10 IU/kg.hr iv, could possibly be safely used in patients at high risk of developing disseminated intravascular coagulation and in those patients with established disseminated intravascular coagulation.\r"

Twenty-one of the 28 patients were studied by videofluoroscopy and 86% of the videos were abnormal, showing aspiration in eight, webs in five, and delay in the oral phase in five. Patients with bradykinetic dysphagia (secondary to neuroleptic-induced extra-pyramidal syndrome [EPS]) and paralytic dysphagia appeared to experience a more severe form of choking.\r"

Image sequences from videotape are digitized for computerized manipulation and analysis in an attempt to improve on conventional visual inspection. The system is \"interactive\" or \"event-driven\": after executing a function, the computer waits for guidance from the user who controls the program through keyboard and mouse input, selecting options from menus and responding to prompts. The analyst alters image clarity by the application of filters and heightens contrast through video enhancement. A technique called \"remapping\" reduces head motion and provides uniform spatial scaling. Animated sequences of images are used, as opposed to frame-by-frame analysis, to preserve temporal context and increase efficiency of measurement. Low cost off-the-shelf personal computer hardware is used along with original software tailored to the application.\r"

Results of the A-B-A-B-A-B withdrawal paradigm, chosen to demonstrate the functional relationship between drug therapy and the degree of drooling, revealed that administration of atropine sulfate reduced by more than 50% of baseline levels the amount of resting secretion, intraoral accumulation, and pharyngeal-laryngeal pooling of saliva, with negligible side effects. These results are discussed and compared to the alternative drug and surgical approaches to treatment that have been the primary focus of recent research on drooling.\r"

Our study indicates that dysphagia tends to decrease after surgery. Neither conventional nor ambulatory pressure recording revealed motor abnormalities that could be held responsible for the dysphagia.

Care must be taken to assure that clinicians possess the understanding of both basic concepts and requisite hardware to provide quality patient care. Equipment selection and calibration, patient selection, data interpretation, potential complications, troubleshooting, and procedure limitations must all be considered. Broader application of the Swan-Ganz catheter in surgery, anesthesiology, and critical care as well as in cardiology has provided information on hemodynamics that has had considerable impact on diagnostics as well as on therapy for patients with a wide variety of clinical conditions.\r"

Of the 1981-1990 graduates of Wright State University School of Medicine (n = 832) investigated, 217 switched preference during medical school (53 to primary care, 164 to nonprimary care). Reasons relating to the medical school experience were more influential than personal or societal reasons, more so for students changing to nonprimary care than for those changing to primary care. Increased awareness of specialties and positive clinical experience in chosen specialties were indicated by 76% and 70% of those who switched. Among reasons selected less frequently, content and emphasis of the curriculum (19% versus 7%) and location of residency (17% versus 6%) were more likely to be cited by those switching to primary care than by those who switched to nonprimary care, while better financial opportunities were more important for those who switched to nonprimary care (17% versus 4%).\r"

Smokers were less likely to be significantly overweight than former smokers or those who never smoked. These associations were present for both men and women for sleep behavior, skipping breakfast, overweight status, and alcohol use, but not for physical activity.

Ninety-six eligible women seen for Pap smears were randomized to one of these three groups. In addition, two comparison groups were included to evaluate the effects of education about collection protocols and of strict protocol adherence. The cytology brush and extended-tip wooden spatula combination captured endocervical elements in 90.3% of Pap smears, compared to 66.7% for cotton swab and extended-tip wooden spatula, and 60.0% for Ayre spatula and extended-tip wooden spatula. The strict adherence to a collection protocol or education on tools and collection methods did not significantly increase the capture of endocervical elements. Widespread use of the cytology brush was introduced into the clinical setting after the study was completed and resulted in an increase to 80.1% capture rate for endocervical elements from a preexisting rate of 49.9%.\r"

The importance of various types of support changes with the changing needs of women as they move from pregnancy to labor and delivery, and then to the postpartum period. During pregnancy, emotional and tangible support provided by the spouse and others is related to the expectant mother's mental well-being. In addition, informational support in the form of prenatal classes is related to decreased maternal physical complications during labor and delivery, and to improved physical and mental health postpartum. Mothers who have the support of a companion during labor and delivery experience fewer childbirth complications and less postpartum depression. Mothers' postpartum mental health is related to both the emotional support and practical help (eg, housework and child care activities) provided by the husband and others. Health care providers are in a unique position to educate prospective parents about the importance of social support around the time of childbirth and may play a critical role in mobilizing support systems for new mothers.\r"

A crucial aspect of each family culture are those beliefs, behaviors, habits, and life-styles that are either protective of health or pathogenic, depending on the context. For family physicians, the insights of medical anthropology are useful in understanding the role of family culture in health, illness, and medical care.\r"

We investigated 33 patients (12 women, 21 men; mean age 36 years) with typical symptoms, a negative oesophagoscopy, and a 24 hour oesophageal pH-metry indicative of pathological gastro-oesophageal reflux. All patients received antacids or prokinetic drugs or both for three to six months. Nineteen of 33 patients still had symptoms at the end of treatment, of whom five had developed erosive changes of the oesophageal mucosa. The other 14 discontinued treatment and remained asymptomatic during a six month follow up period. Comparison of the pretreatment pH-metry data of the 19 symptomatic patients and the 14 asymptomatic patients showed no differences in the pattern of gastro-oesophageal reflux in the two groups. We conclude that in a substantial proportion of patients with pathological reflux without oesophagitis symptoms may persist and mucosal lesions may develop during conventional treatment without any apparent change in the reflux. Patients who developed endoscopic oesophagitis did not have a more severe pretreatment pattern of gastro-oesophageal reflux when compared with those who did not develop oesophageal mucosal damage.\r"

The mean PG I concentration was significantly higher in male control subjects (n = 90) than in female control subjects (n = 84). In male patients with ulcers in the duodenum (n = 69), antrum (n = 34), or angulus portion (the lower third of the body; n = 83), the mean serum PG I concentration was significantly higher than in the control subjects but in patients with an ulcer in the upper body (n = 49) it was similar to control values. Men with active or healing ulcers (n = 149) showed a significantly higher serum PG I concentration than those with scarred lesions (n = 86) when the abnormality was located in either the upper body or in the angulus portion. For female patients (n = 87), the results were similar. These results suggest that serum PG I concentrations reflect the stages of activity of peptic ulcer.\r"

The aim of this work was to study the activation of human PMNL by substances produced by H pylori. Filtered H pylori conditioned media stimulated a significant PMNL oxidative burst (p less than 0.002). This was equal to 26% of the maximal response stimulated by the PMNL chemotactic peptide N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (FMLP, 1 mumol/l). The response to FMLP was prolonged by the combined presence of complement inactivated human anti-H pylori plasma and conditioned medium (p less than 0.002). High pressure liquid chromatography of an extract of conditioned medium showed a fraction that stimulated PMNL, eluted, and antigenically cross reacted with FMLP. Washed H pylori cells, and those opsonised with complement inactivated human anti-H pylori plasma, did not induce a significant oxidative burst. Opsonized H pylori, however, prolonged the oxidative burst induced by FMLP (p less than 0.02). In conclusion, H pylori synthesizes and secretes a substance, probably FMLP, that may account for the PMNL accumulation that accompanies H pylori infections. Immune complexes composed of H pylori antigen and specific antibody potentiate the PMNL oxidative burst. This combination of H pylori derived products, and host PMNL and antibodies, may be involved in the mucosal damage observed in H pylori associated gastritis.\r"

In the inherited peroxisomal diseases one or more enzymes are deficient in hepatic, renal, and fibroblast peroxisomes. We have examined peroxisomes by light and electron microscopy in 29 duodenal biopsy specimens (21 with normal mucosa) after staining for catalase activity, a marker enzyme. Peroxisomes were most numerous in the apices of the nucleus and at the villus base. Two types were distinguished: rounded to oval forms with a median lesser diameter of 0.23-0.31 microns, and tubular, vermiform organelles 0.1 microns thick and up to 3 microns long. Both types coexist in most patients. Tilting of sections and examination of semithin sections at 120 kV did not show connections between individual organelles. By morphometry, volume density was at least 0.45-0.62% of cellular volume, compared to 1.05% in human liver. In contrast, in four out of five individuals surface density of the peroxisomal membrane was 1.4-2.3 times higher than in control livers; this is expected to favour the exchange of metabolites. We suggest that intestinal peroxisomes contribute substantially to the breakdown of very long chain fatty acids.\r"

  ".U": "91357566\r", 
  ".W": "The mechanism of the hypergastrinaemia associated with Helicobacter pylori infection is unknown. It may be an effect of the ammonia produced by the bacterium near the antral epithelial surface. We have examined the effect on serum gastrin of inhibiting H pylori urease activity with acetohydroxamic acid in six duodenal ulcer patients. On day 1 the fasted patients received placebo tablets at 8 am, a peptide meal at 10 am, and a 14C urea breath test at 11.30 am. The next day 750 mg acetohydroxamic acid was administered orally in place of the placebo. The median (range) 30 minute breath test value (dose/mmol CO2 X kg body wt X 100) was 152 (111-335) on day 1, but only 22 (14-95) the next day (p less than 0.03). Further studies performed in one subject confirmed that acetohydroxamic acid lowered the ammonium concentration and raised the urea concentration in gastric juice. The inhibition of urease activity and ammonia production did not result in a fall in the basal gastrin concentration or in the median integrated gastrin response to the peptide meal, which was 78 ng/1.h (range 21-222) on day 1 and 79 ng/1.h (33-207) the next day. Ten days after acetohydroxamic acid, the urea breath test values were similar to those before treatment. This study shows that the raised gastrin concentration in patients with H pylori infection is not directly related to the organism's urease activity. It also shows that temporary suppression of H pylori urease activity does not clear the infection.\r"

  ".W": "The aim of our experiments was to produce a local T cell mediated immune response to gliadin in the mouse small intestine as a possible animal model of gluten sensitive enteropathy, coeliac disease. BALB/c and BDF1 mice were immunised systemically with gliadin in complete Freund's adjuvant. The jejunal mucosa was challenged by feeding a gluten containing diet, and villus and crypt lengths, crypt cell production rate, and intraepithelial lymphocyte counts were determined to assess mucosal cell mediated immunity. In some animals permeability and local immunity were modulated by concurrent intestinal anaphylaxis or a graft versus host reaction. There were no changes in the jejunal mucosa of BALB/c mice fed a gluten containing diet after having been parenterally immunized. When, however, mice were parenterally immunised with gliadin, fed a gluten containing diet, rendered hypersensitive to helminth antigen by infection with the nematode parasite Nippostrongylus brasiliensis, and challenged intravenously to produce intestinal anaphylaxis crypt cell production rate was significantly higher than in ovalbumin immunized controls at 12 days after parasite challenge. Finally, graft versus host reaction was induced in BDF1 mice that had been parenterally immunised with gliadin and were on a gluten containing diet. Two weeks later these mice had significantly longer crypts and a higher crypt cell production rate and intraepithelial lymphocyte count than control, unimmunized mice with graft versus host reaction. We conclude that active immunization with gliadin does not in itself produce intestinal cell mediated immunity to gliadin contained in the diet, or enteropathy.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

A small group of patients with active ulcerative colitis (n = 4) was included as a bowel disease control group. Clearance was estimated by measuring the disappearance rate of a bolus dose of intravenously injected IgG coated autologous erythrocytes. The mean T1/2 of clearance was prolonged in both coeliac disease (86 (24) minutes) and dermatitis herpetiformis (111 (35) minutes), compared with healthy subjects (20 (5) minutes) and coeliac patients with concomitant serum IgA deficiency (T1/2 = 17 (6) minutes). Patients with ulcerative colitis had a prolonged clearance, with a T1/2 of 195 (63) minutes. Values of circulating immune complexes were measured by four assays; C1q binding and C3, IgG, and IgA containing immune complexes. C1q binding immune complexes were detected only in IgA deficient gluten sensitive enteropathy. Patients with coeliac disease and dermatitis herpetiformis had higher values of C3, IgG, and IgA containing immune complexes than control subjects and serum IgA deficient patients with coeliac disease. The clearance rate was inversely correlated to the amount of immune complexes for the subgroups of gluten sensitive enteropathy.\r"

Of these adolescents with coeliac disease, 65% were adhering to a strict gluten free diet, 11.4% were on a gluten free diet but with occasional gluten intake, and 23.6% were on a gluten containing diet. Clinical symptoms occurred more frequently in patients on a gluten containing diet, but not in patients on a semi-strict diet. Occasional intake of small amounts (0.06-2 g/day) of gluten did not produce increased concentrations of antigliadin antibodies but resulted in an appreciably increased crypt epithelial volume and expanded crypt intraepithelial lymphocyte population.\r"

The binding of Phaseolus vulgaris (PHA) isolectins E4 and L4 to the microvilli and microvillus vesicles in the top area of the villi was shown by immunoelectron microscopy. Differences were observed in the distribution of the isolectins. In the explants cultured for five hours with the PHA isolectins, the enterocyte height and the villus length were decreased, and a lower villus: crypt ratio was calculated. Ultrastructurally, the microvilli were shorter and irregularly positioned. After incubation with both PHA E4 and PHA L4, clusters of small vesicles, tied off from the microvilli, were seen in higher numbers when compared with control explants. The activity of the brush border enzyme sucrase-isomaltase was reduced in the PHA E4 incubated explants but did not change in the PHA L4 incubated explants. This investigation shows that explants of pig jejunal mucosa in organ culture are suitable for study of the pathological effects of lectins on the small intestinal mucosa. This method may also be used in elucidating the mechanisms by which damage to mucosal structure occurs.\r"

These enterocytes have been used to study the values of intracellular free calcium and the rises in adenosine 3'5'-cyclic monophosphate (cAMP) induced by secretagogues in normal and cystic fibrosis cells. Basal intracellular free calcium of cystic fibrosis enterocytes, measured fluorimetrically with fura-2, was within the range of the basal intracellular free calcium of non-cystic fibrosis enterocytes (cystic fibrosis 263 nmol/l; non-cystic fibrosis 287 nmol/l). Changes in intracellular free calcium were observed after exposure to ionomycin: a 100 nmol/l solution induced a 2.5 fold increase in intracellular free calcium in the cystic fibrosis enterocytes and a 2.2 fold increase in the intracellular free calcium concentration of the non-cystic fibrosis enterocytes. Basal cAMP values were not significantly different between cystic fibrosis and non-cystic fibrosis enterocytes (cystic fibrosis 575 fmol/100,000 cells; non-cystic fibrosis 716 fmol/100,000 cells, p greater than 0.05) and the enterocyte cAMP value increased in response to stimulation with prostaglandin E2 (7 mumol/l) (cystic fibrosis 2.2 fold increase over basal, p less than 0.05; non-cystic fibrosis 1.9 fold stimulation over basal, p less than 0.05) and vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (100 nmol/l) (cystic fibrosis 7.1 fold increase over basal, p less than 0.05; non-cystic fibrosis 5.8 fold increase over basal, p less than 0.05). There was no significant difference in the magnitude of the response between cystic fibrosis and non-cystic fibrosis enterocytes (p greater than 0.05).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Biopsy specimens were taken from 10 predetermined locations in the colon and rectum. No patient had definite dysplasia but three displayed DNA aneuploidy (12.5%), and one of these subsequently developed a carcinoma (Dukes' C at operation) in the ascending colon. No concomitant dysplasia was detected but the carcinoma as well as other parts of the mucosa were DNA aneuploid. It is concluded that dysplasia is rare in patients with Crohn's colitis, but findings of DNA aneuploidy warrant vigilance in follow up as this may indicate impending carcinoma. Further prospective studies are needed before the predictive value of DNA aneuploidy can be determined and before general recommendations of colonoscopic surveillance, as in longstanding ulcerative colitis, can be made.\r"

Oxygen radicals react with cell membrane lipids and induce cell damage by peroxidation and induce accumulation of polymorphonuclear leucocytes in the tissue. The aim of the study was to elucidate the involvement of polymorphonuclear leucocytes in post-ischaemic intestinal damage. Intestinal ischaemia was induced in cats by partial occlusion of the superior mesenteric artery. Samples from the small intestine were excised before and at the end of the two hour hypotensive period as well as 10 minutes and 60 minutes after reperfusion. Conjugated dienes, myeloperoxidase, and the purine metabolites were determined in the samples. The tissue was also examined histologically. Seven cats were treated before reperfusion with a monoclonal antibody (IB4) which inhibits leucocyte adherence to endothelial cells and its subsequent activation. After reperfusion myeloperoxidase activity increased and the ischaemic mucosal lesions worsened significantly. IB4 treatment prevented an increase in post-hypotensive myeloperoxidase activity and attenuated the normally observed severe mucosal lesions. We conclude that the severe post-ischaemic lesions are induced by polymorphonuclear leucocytes. Such mucosal injury may be appreciably reduced by blocking leucocyte adherence with IB4.\r"

  ".W": "Serum tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha) concentrations were measured by enzyme linked immunoadsorbent assay in 31 normal children and during 65 episodes of clinical remission and 54 episodes of relapse in 92 children with chronic inflammatory bowel disease. An appreciable rise in TNF alpha was found only in children in relapse of ulcerative colitis and colonic Crohn's disease. The group of children with small bowel Crohn's disease in relapse did not show increases of TNF alpha above control concentrations, despite an equivalent rise in disease indices. Height velocity was depressed in children with relapse of large bowel Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis compared with the equivalent condition in remission. The impairment of growth velocity was significantly greater in relapse of large bowel Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis than in small bowel Crohn's disease alone, although for the subgroups in stage 1 puberty (prepubertal) the differences were not significant. Inadequate growth in chronic inflammatory bowel disease is currently ascribed to inadequate nutrition and TNF alpha may contribute to this through its cachexia inducing effects. It may, in addition, diminish pituitary growth hormone release. These results suggest that production of TNF alpha may be associated with growth failure in relapse of colonic inflammatory bowel disease.\r"

  ".W": "Using two colour immunofluorescence with fluorescein isothiocyanate and phycoerythrin labelled monoclonal antibodies and multiparameter flow cytometry, we investigated the coexpression of CD4 and CD8 antigens on peripheral blood lymphocytes and lamina propria lymphocytes of patients with ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease and normal control subjects. Both the absolute number and the proportion of peripheral blood CD4+, CD8+ cells in inflammatory bowel disease were small but significantly increased compared with those in normal control subjects. Peripheral blood lymphocytes activated with phytohaemagglutinin showed appreciably increased coexpression of CD4+, CD8+. These CD4, CD8 positive cells were large and granular. Thus the increased number of peripheral blood CD4+, CD8+ cells in inflammatory bowel disease suggests that chronic immune activation occurs not only in the active state of the disease but also in remission. The proportion of CD4+, CD8+ cells in the lamina propria was greater than in peripheral blood in normal subjects, suggesting chronic immune stimulation of the local immune system. This was also seen in patients with Crohn's disease or inactive ulcerative colitis. The proportion of CD4+, CD8+ cells was, however, significantly less in the lamina propria of patients with active ulcerative colitis. Whether this implies a possible defect in mucosal immunoregulation in active ulcerative colitis cannot be determined from these results.\r"

  ".W": "Short chain (C2-C6) fatty acids are produced in the colon through bacterial fermentation of mainly dietary fibre. Butyrate (C4) possesses antineoplastic effects on human colon carcinoma cells, and epidemiological studies indicate that high fibre diets may reduce the incidence of colorectal cancer. The role of dietary fibre during colorectal carcinogenesis might therefore be related to its fermentation to butyrate. Faecal concentrations of total short chain fatty acids and concentrations and ratios of the individual C2-C6 fatty acids did not differ between 16 healthy controls, 17 patients with colonic adenomas, and 17 patients with colonic cancer. Comparison of the molar production velocities (mmol/l.hour) of total and individual short chain fatty acids from glucose, ispagula, wheat bran, and albumin in six and 24 hour faecal incubations showed no differences. The ratio of butyrate production to total short chain fatty acid production from fibre, however, was reduced in patients with colonic cancer and adenomas compared with healthy controls (ispagula, six hours: 6.4, 7.6, and 11.5% respectively, p = 0.005 and 24 hour: 9.1, 9.9, and 15.4%, p = 0.002; wheat bran, six hours: 9.9, 10.2, and 14.7% respectively, p = 0.06 and 24 hours: 15.1, 16.8, and 21.0%, p = 0.01). It may be that the low ratios of colonic butyrate formation combined with low fibre diets increase the risk of colonic neoplasia.\r"

A double blind study was carried out using enemas containing 1, 2, or 4 g or 5-ASA or placebo for a one month treatment period. One hundred and thirteen patients with ulcerative colitis attending our outpatient clinic volunteered to participate. Clinical, sigmoidoscopic, and histological assessments were carried out at the beginning of the study and after 15 and 30 days of treatment. All patients who received 5-ASA enemas showed significantly better results than those who received a placebo enema (p less than 0.001) but no difference was detected among the patients receiving differing concentrations of 5-ASA. This study suggests that 1 g 5-ASA (in a 100 ml enema) is a sufficient dosage for patients with a mild to moderate attack of ulcerative colitis.\r"

  ".W": "Recent studies suggest that the ability of glucocorticoids to reduce diarrhoea in active colitis may reflect their direct effects on distal colonic electrogenic Na+ transport and water absorption, as well as their anti-inflammatory action. To determine whether glucocorticoids induce similar changes in proximal colon, specific Na+ and K+ channel blockers (amiloride and tetraethylammonium chloride (TEA) respectively) were used to evaluate the cation transport properties of rat proximal and distal colon in vitro after three days treatment with the glucocorticoid agonist dexamethasone (600 micrograms/100 g/day). In the proximal colon, dexamethasone increased short circuit current (Isc) 2.3 fold (p less than 0.025) and total conductance (Gt) by 87% (p less than 0.015), but had negligible effects on the maximum activity of the basolateral membrane Na(+)-K+ pump and the baseline Na+ and K+ conductive properties of the apical membrane. Additional studies with diphenylamine-2-carboxylic acid (a Cl- channel blocker) suggested that the dexamethasone induced increases in Isc and Gt in proximal colon reflected stimulation of an electrogenic Cl- secretory process. In contrast, in the distal colon dexamethasone increased Isc 10 fold (p less than 0.025), Gt by 100% (p less than 0.015), and the maximum activity of the basolateral Na(+)-K+ pump by 200% (p less than 0.05), and induced substantial Na+ and K+ conductances in the apical membrane. These results indicate that dexamethasone stimulates electrogenic Na+ transport and water absorption to a significant degree only in the distal segment of rat colon. Thus in patients with active colitis, that part of the antidiarrhoeal action of glucocorticoids that reflects stimulation of electrogenic Na+ transport (and hence water absorption) may be restricted to the descending colon and rectum.\r"

The exercise was performed at two thirds predicted maximum heart rate (equivalent to 50% VO2 max). The sequences were rotated; no studies were performed in the perimenstrual period. Transit was measured by the method of measuring the excretion of a single dose of radio-opaque markers; all stools were collected, weighed, and x rayed after the ingestion of radio-opaque markers. Dietary fibre and fluid intake were measured on the fourth day of each test period by 24 hour record. Lifestyle was otherwise unchanged. Transit time was dramatically accelerated by moderate exercise (both jogging and cycling); however, stool weight, defecation frequency, dietary fibre intake, and fluid intake did not change significantly. Whole gut transit changed from 51.2 hours (95% confidence intervals 41.9 to 60.5) at rest to 36.6 hours (31.6 to 39.2) when riding and 34.0 hours (28.8 to 39.2) when jogging. Riding and running both differed significantly from resting (p less than 0.01); the difference between riding and running was not significant.\r"

Equivalent results were obtained with both methods, which showed the proliferative activity of gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumours to be heterogeneous. In four malignant small intestinal carcinoids and one extravisceral carcinoid localised in the retroperitoneum the percentage (index) of proliferating tumour cells as measured by DNA flow cytometry ranged from 2.9 to 36.2% corresponding to low, moderate, or high proliferative activity. In four malignant pancreatic endocrine tumours and their metastases indices ranged from 8.7 to 18.3%, corresponding to low, moderate, or high proliferative activity. In four benign pancreatic endocrine tumours indices ranged from 4.3 to 7.7%, all corresponding to low proliferative activity. This heterogeneity of proliferative activity may in part explain the heterogeneous results reported of chemotherapy treatment. As chemotherapy of tumours is largely affected by favourable cell cycling kinetics, individual diagnostic investigations of the proliferative activity of these neuroendocrine tumours may be of value for identifying patients suitable for this treatment.\r"

The animals were then fed a nonatherogenic \"prudent\" ration for 6 additional months (hypertension-regression group). Twelve additional monkeys were fed the atherogenic diet for 6 months; six were killed (lesion-induction control group) and six were changed to the prudent diet for 6 additional months without coarctation (normotension-regression control group). At the end of the induction period, cholesterol levels averaged 744 +/- 178 mg/dl for the 22 animals and were similar for the three groups throughout the induction period. For the animals restored to the nonatherogenic diet (hypertension-regression and normotension-regression groups), serum cholesterol levels fell to 486 +/- 252 mg/dl at 1 month, to 341 +/- 162 mg/dl at 2 months, and to 234 +/- 78 mg/dl at 6 months. There was no significant difference between the hypertensive and normotensive animals. Six months after coarctation, blood pressure proximal to the coarctations for the hypertension-regression group ranged from 100/60 to 220/145 mm Hg with a mean of 166/103 +/- 36/28 mm Hg. Cross-sectional area of coronary plaques was somewhat lower for the normotension-regression control group compared with the lesion-induction control group, but the difference was not significant. Plaque area was, however, markedly greater in the hypertension-regression group than in either the lesion-induction or the normotension-regression groups (p less than 0.05 for each) despite progressive reduction in hyperlipidemia.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Hypertension is associated with an impairment of endothelium-dependent relaxation. The angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors captopril and cilazapril can prevent this endothelial dysfunction. We recently observed that long-term treatment with cilazapril could also prevent subendothelial infiltration by mononuclear cells in spontaneously hypertensive rats. This prompted us to examine whether, in spontaneously hypertensive rats, endothelial dysfunction and subendothelial infiltration by mononuclear cells are associated. These cells were characterized as monocyte macrophages. Infiltration by monocyte macrophages was quantified by morphometry. Endothelial function was estimated by calculating serotonin ratio (maximal contraction to serotonin on isolated arterial rings with endothelium over maximal contraction on paired rings without endothelium). The regional distribution of endothelial dysfunction and subendothelial monocyte macrophages was similar. Both were maximal in the carotid artery, less in the aorta, and nonexistent in the renal artery. A 2-week treatment with cilazapril decreased both endothelial dysfunction (serotonin ratio decreased by 32%) and the number of subendothelial monocyte macrophages in the aorta, which decreased by 38%. We conclude that in spontaneously hypertensive rats, endothelial dysfunction and subendothelial monocyte macrophage infiltration are associated and that cilazapril can decrease both. The observation that angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors affect subendothelial accumulation of monocyte macrophage may lead to a better understanding of the mechanism of action of this class of drugs.\r"

  ".W": "We have previously reported that antioxidant drug intervention protects against magnesium deficiency-induced myocardial lesions. In the present study, Golden Syrian male hamsters were fed either a magnesium-deficient diet or a magnesium-supplemented diet. Animals from each group received sulfhydryl-containing angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors: captopril, epi-captopril (a stereoisomer of captopril), and zofenopril* (arginine blend of zofenopril containing a free SH group); another group of animals received the non-sulfhydryl-containing angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor enalaprilat. The animals were killed after 14 days, and their hearts were isolated for morphological and morphometric analyses. Hematoxylin and eosin-stained sections were examined by a computer image analysis system for a morphometric determination of the severity of myocardial injury. Captopril reduced both the density of lesions, from 0.32 to 0.08 lesions/(mm2) (p less than 0.01), and the area fraction of lesions, from 7.42 x 10(-4) to 2.03 x 10(-4) lesion area/(mm2) (p less than 0.01), as well as the degree of inflammatory infiltration around the blood vessels. Epi-captopril and zofenopril* were virtually equipotent to captopril, but enalaprilat afforded only slight (nonsignificant) protection. These results indicate that a significant component of the protective effect of captopril in this model was attributable to its sulfhydryl moiety, rather than solely due to the inhibition of the angiotensin converting enzyme. These data further support our previous findings of possible free radical participation in cardiomyopathy due to magnesium deficiency.\r"

  ".W": "To evaluate the effects of hypertension on cardiac hypertrophy, on myocardial structure, and on ventricular arrhythmias, 27 3-month-old spontaneously hypertensive rats were treated with enalapril (10 mg/kg) daily for 11 months and compared with 26 untreated control rats. Systolic arterial pressure was significantly decreased in treated rats, and at the end of the experiment, it was 199 +/- 3 mm Hg (treated) versus 237 +/- 3 mm Hg (controls) (p less than 0.001). At this time, spontaneous arrhythmias and induced arrhythmias either by programmed electrical stimulation (train of stimuli +1 or 2 extrastimuli) or by trains of eight stimuli at decreasing coupling intervals were observed in isolated heart preparations. Comparing enalapril-treated and control rats, spontaneous arrhythmias (9 of 27 versus 20 of 26, respectively; p less than 0.01), programmed stimulation-induced arrhythmias (3 of 26 versus 12 of 23, respectively; p less than 0.01), and trains of stimuli-induced arrhythmias (4 of 26 versus 14 of 19, respectively, p less than 0.001) were less frequent in the enalapril group. Left ventricular weight was decreased in treated rats by 18% (p less than 0.001). Enalapril administration diminished the fraction of myocardium occupied by foci of replacement fibrosis normally occurring in control rats by 59% (p less than 0.001). Finally, a significant correlation was found between left ventricular weight, the extent of myocardial fibrosis, and the occurrence of ventricular fibrillation. It was concluded that chronic treatment with enalapril, which resulted in attenuation of systemic arterial pressure by limiting cardiac hypertrophy and myocardial fibrosis, decreases the propensity of the heart of hypertensive rats to arrhythmogenesis.\r"

The comparisons were made in rings of aorta taken from normotensive rats and from rats with aortic coarctation-induced hypertension at 12 days and 90-113 days after coarctation. These rings released thromboxane B2, which was found to be endothelium dependent, increased in hypertensive rats, and stimulated by angiotensin II (10(-6) M) in normotensive rats and in hypertensive rats at 12 days after coarctation. The angiotensin II (10(-6) to 10(-5)M)-induced contraction of aortic rings was increased by about 30% at 12 days after coarctation and decreased at 90-113 days after coarctation. Removal of the endothelium increased the contractile effect of angiotensin II (10(-6) M) in aortic rings of normotensive rats and hypertensive rats at 90-113 days after coarctation but decreased the effect in aortic rings of hypertensive rats at 12 days after coarctation. In rats at 12 days after coarctation, the angiotensin II (10(-6) M)-induced contraction of aortic rings with endothelium was attenuated by indomethacin and SQ29548 but not by CGS13080. These data suggest that a prostanoid-mediated and endothelium-dependent mechanism of vasoconstriction contributes to the constrictor effect of angiotensin II in aortic rings of rats in the early phase of aortic coarctation-induced hypertension.\r"

Recently, the original claim of a normalization of arterial pressure in the spontaneously hypertensive rat after a single administration of interleukin-2 has been disputed. Therefore, the present study was performed to determine whether the administration of interleukin-2 was effective in attenuating both the development and maintenance of hypertension in the spontaneously hypertensive rat. Both young prehypertensive spontaneously hypertensive rats and adult spontaneously hypertensive rats with established hypertension received a single subcutaneous dose of 5,000 units/kg human recombinant interleukin-2. Arterial pressure was monitored at weekly intervals in both control and treated animals by the tail-cuff technique. Interleukin-2 administered as a one time single injection had no effect on the development of hypertension in the young animals or on the maintenance of hypertension in the adult animals. Interleukin-2 also was administered as a continuous infusion via osmotic minipumps at dose levels of 5,000 and 50,000 units/kg/wk to both young and adult spontaneously hypertensive rats. Continuous administration of interleukin-2 also had no effect on the development or maintenance of spontaneous hypertension. Therefore, this study firmly demonstrates that interleukin-2 has no effect on the onset or maintenance of hypertension in the spontaneously hypertensive rat.\r"

The men had higher mean arterial blood pressure, serum creatinine, and body mass index than the women. Serum total calcium, plasma ionized calcium, and parathyroid hormone (measured as both intact hormone and mid-molecule fragment) were not different between men and women; however, serum phosphate was higher in women than in men. Basal platelet cytosolic calcium was higher in men than in women (113.7 +/- 1.9 versus 105.9 +/- 1.7, respectively; p less than 0.01), but there was no difference in the peak platelet cytosolic calcium responses to thrombin between the two groups. In the combined group of male and female subjects, platelet cytosolic calcium correlated with diastolic blood pressure and mean arterial pressure (r = 0.37, p less than 0.001 and r = 0.32, p less than 0.01, respectively). Intact parathyroid hormone correlated with systolic and mean arterial blood pressure (r = 0.41, p less than 0.001 for both). Age correlated with both systolic blood pressure (r = 0.40, p less than 0.001) and intact parathyroid hormone (r = 0.51, p less than 0.001). When multiple regression analysis was performed using mean arterial pressure as the dependent variable, platelet cytosolic calcium and intact parathyroid hormone maintained significant correlations with mean arterial pressure. Platelet cytosolic calcium did not correlate with intact parathyroid hormone. These results suggest that both platelet cytosolic calcium and intact parathyroid hormone are associated with blood pressure regulation in normotensive subjects. However, the influences of these two factors on blood pressure are not interrelated.\r"

We studied 543 men and 589 women from the population of Rochester, Minnesota. Mean sodium-lithium countertransport was higher in hypertensive than in normotensive subjects in men (370 +/- 147 [mean +/- SD] versus 315 +/- 110 mumol/l red blood cells [RBC]/hr, p less than 0.001) and in women (339 +/- 114 versus 269 +/- 92 mumol/l RBC/hr, p less than 0.001). Interindividual differences in plasma triglycerides, body mass index (wt/[ht]2), and plasma total cholesterol explained 13.0% of sodium-lithium countertransport variation in men (p less than 0.001) and 20.2% in women (p less than 0.001). Age did not predict additional sodium-lithium countertransport variation in either gender. Slopes of the regressions of sodium-lithium countertransport on plasma triglycerides, body mass index, and plasma total cholesterol did not differ between diagnostic groups in men (p = 0.31) or in women (p = 0.29). After adjustment to remove sodium-lithium countertransport variation attributable to these covariates, mean sodium-lithium countertransport remained significantly higher in hypertensive than in normotensive subjects in men (354 +/- 139 versus 319 +/- 104 mumol/l RBC/hr, p less than 0.01) and in women (311 +/- 103 versus 278 +/- 83 mumol/l RBC/hr, p less than 0.01).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Electroencephalographic sleep recordings were performed during 4 consecutive nights. Blood pressure and heart rate were measured every 10 minutes for 24 hours starting in the morning preceding the fourth night of recording. Sleep quality was not significantly altered by ambulatory blood pressure monitoring. A best-fit curve based on the periodogram method was used to quantify changes in blood pressure and heart rate over the 24-hour cycle. The typical blood pressure and heart rate patterns were bimodal with a morning acrophase (around 10:00 AM), a small afternoon nadir (around 3:00 PM), an evening acrophase (around 8:00 PM), and a profound nocturnal nadir (around 3:00 AM). The amplitude of the nycterohemeral variations was largest for heart rate, intermediate for diastolic blood pressure, and smallest for systolic blood pressure (respectively, 19.9%, 14.1%, and 10.9% of the 24-hour mean). Before awakening, a significant increase in blood pressure and heart rate was already present. Recumbency and sleep accounted for 65-75% of the nocturnal decline in blood pressure, but it explained only 50% of the nocturnal decline in heart rate. Thus, the combined effects of postural changes and the wake-sleep transition are the major factors responsible for the 24-hour rhythm in blood pressure. In contrast, the 24-hour rhythm of heart rate may reflect an endogenous circadian rhythm, amplified by the effect of sleep. We conclude that modulatory factors different from those controlling nycterohemeral changes in blood pressure influence the 24-hour variation in heart rate.\r"

Sustained hypotension after a single session of exercise may have important implications in the treatment of patients with mild hypertension. We studied 24 subjects (12 normotensive subjects and 12 patients with mild or borderline hypertension). Blood pressure was measured in the laboratory for 30 minutes before and for an hour after graded bicycle exercise to maximal voluntary capacity. Subjects then left the hospital and measured their blood pressures at home (three measurements every 2 hours) following a strict measurement protocol for the rest of the day (usually between 8 and 12 hours). These home blood pressure measurements were compared with home blood pressure measurements recorded at the same times on a nonexercise control day. At 30 minutes after the graded maximal exercise test, the hypertensive patients experienced a fall in blood pressure from 142 +/- 3.5/93 +/- 6.5 mm Hg (mean +/- SEM) to 124 +/- 4.5/79 +/- 2.8 mm Hg (p less than 0.01). For the normotensive subjects, blood pressure after exercise fell from 117 +/- 3.1/70 +/- 2.1 mm Hg to 109 +/- 3.1/62 +/- 2.8 mm Hg (p less than 0.01). Despite these striking blood pressure reductions for the second half hour after exercise, blood pressure measurements recorded at home were not significantly different on the exercise and control days in either group. We conclude that although a single bout of exercise lowers blood pressure for a short (1-hour) period, this hypotension is not sustained.\r"

During a predilated state achieved by infusion of sodium nitroprusside into the branchial artery, subsequent infusion of norepinephrine induced a mean increase in forearm vascular resistance of 571%, whereas this response was only 270% when an equipotent vasodilator dose of adenosine was used instead of sodium nitroprusside (nitroprusside versus adenosine, p less than 0.05, n = 6). A comparable difference was found when the endogenous release of norepinephrine was stimulated by the local infusion of tyramine, with tyramine-induced increments in forearm vascular resistance of 438% during nitroprusside versus 93% during adenosine (n = 6, p less than 0.05). During these tyramine infusions a similar increase in the calculated forearm norepinephrine overflow occurred in the adenosine and the nitroprusside tests. In a third experiment, we demonstrated that adenosine also reduced the vasoconstrictor response to lower body negative pressure, an endogenous stimulus, of the sympathetic nervous system. During nitroprusside, lower body negative pressure induced an increase in forearm vascular resistance of 135%, whereas this was 39% during adenosine (n = 6, p less than 0.05). We conclude that adenosine attenuates the response to sympathetic nervous system-mediated vasoconstriction in humans, and that this effect may at least partly be explained by a postsynaptic inhibition of alpha-adrenergic vasoconstriction. Therefore, we think that adenosine may be an important endogenous modulator of sympathetic nervous system activity in humans.\r"

Further, acute microinjection of clonidine into the anterior hypothalamic area produced depressor responses that were augmented by high salt feeding in SHR-S but not in SHR-R or WKY rats. The current study tested the hypothesis that chronic infusion of clonidine into the anterior hypothalamic area prevents salt-sensitive hypertension in SHR-S. Beginning at age 7 weeks, immediately before initiation of 1% or 8% salt diets, clonidine (2 ng/min) or saline vehicle was infused into the anterior hypothalamic area or femoral vein of male SHR-S via osmotic minipump for 20 days. In SHR-S fed an 8% salt diet, chronic microinfusion of clonidine into the anterior hypothalamic area offset the hypertensive effect of the dietary salt supplementation and reduced the enhancing effects of dietary salt on left ventricular weight and plasma norepinephrine levels. In contrast, chronic microinfusion of clonidine into the anterior hypothalamic area did not significantly affect any of these measures in 1% salt-fed SHR-S. Intravenous infusion of clonidine at the rate used for the anterior hypothalamic area infusion did not alter any of these measures in 8% salt-fed SHR-S.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "PFD (Paired Filtration Dialysis) is the only hemodiafiltration (HDF) technique in which the ultrafiltrate (UF) is continuously available not mixed with the dialysate. As with all convective or prevailingly convective techniques, a replacement fluid is necessary in an amount equal to the difference between the UF and the desired weight loss. This replacement fluid (R) must have an adequate electrolytic balance (Na+, Ca++, and buffer), and must be sterile and pyrogen-free. Using an uncoated adsorbent charcoal cartridge, we \"regenerated\" the UF obtained in PFD, eliminating the small (except for urea, which was later eliminated by diffusion in the dialyzing section of the PFD system) and the medium-to-large molecules (vit B12 and myoglobin in vitro and beta-2-microglobulin (B2m) and (hANP) in vivo), but not the electrolytes and the endogenous bicarbonate, so as to verify its possible use as R. This technique, experimentally performed in 12 patients under HDF treatment with standard PFD, with a total mean UF of 9650 +/- 875 ml and the use of 130 g of uncoated charcoal, produced a solution with the following composition: Na+ 135.4 +/- 2.4 mmol/l, K+ 3.4 +/- 1.23 mmol/l, Ca++ 1.18 +/- 0.14 mmol/l, HCO3- 26.7 +/- 2.3 mmol/l, phosphates 2.88 +/- 0.81 mg/dl, urea 63 +/- 14 mg/dl, creatinine 0.08 +/- 0.02 mg/dl, uric acid 0.05 +/- 0.0 mg/dl, beta-2 microglobulin 0.5 +/- 0.5 mg/l, and hANP 4.15 +/- 5 pg/l.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

We have now done 34 kidney transplantations from living related donors, who were 60 years of age and older. Donor-specific transfusions and low-dose triple drugs were used for all recipients. The overall patient survival was 97.5% and graft survival was 85.29%. In the light of these results we conclude that elderly living donor kidneys can be used satisfactorily with low-dose triple therapy.\r"

The present study illustrates the utility of the Finite Element Method for fluid dynamic evaluation of prosthetic heart valves. The valves investigated were the Bjork-Shiley Convex-Concave (curved disc), the Medtronic-Hall (flat disc) and the Carbomedics (bileaflet). These three types were chosen in order to clarify the role of different occluder geometries on global and local fluid dynamics. The Finite Element Method was used to calculate pressure and velocity fields in the fluid domain around each valve. There were significant differences, mainly in local fluid dynamics, between the three valves. The Reynolds number also plays an important role.\r"

Different pulse duplicators are used for heart valve testing, but the results depend very much on the system adopted and the measurement protocol. Tests on two pulse duplicators currently used at the Biomedical Engineering Laboratory at the Istituto Superiore di Sanita, Rome, are reported here. The most significant parameters for valve evaluation were measured following each system's own protocol. Attention was focused on vascular load tuning when setting up the system and on the relationship between drive unit flow waveform and valve regurgitation and energy loss measurements. Standardization criteria must be defined in order to ensure the reliable comparability of in vitro testing results.\r"

However, present limitations preclude wider application of the so-called artificial pancreas. Therefore, a thorough understanding of these limitations is needed to design better systems for future long-term use. The present simulation study was design: to obtain better information on the impact of the measurement delay of currently available closed-loop devices both during closed-loop insulin delivery and blood glucose clamp studies, and to design and test a time delay compensator based on the method originally described by O.J. Smith. Simulations were performed on a Compaq Deskpro 486/25 personal computer under MS-DOS operating system using Simnon rel. 3.00 software. There was a direct relationship between measurement delay and amount of insulin delivered, i.e., the longer the delay the higher the insulin dose needed to control a rise in blood glucose; the closed-loop response in presence of a time delay was qualitatively impaired both during insulin delivery and blood glucose clamp studies; time delay compensation was effective in reducing the insulin dose and improving controller stability during the early phase of clamp studies. However, the robustness of a Smith's predictor-based controller should be carefully evaluated before implementation in closed-loop systems can be considered.\r"

We published that this discrepancy was approximately 8% of the left ventricular cardiac output. A variety of methods have been used to achieve balance between the right and left atrial pressures. Relatively large volume-displacement chambers (VDC) present potential problems, but do provide balance. The VDC in volumetrically coupled right-left stroke volumes was eliminated by using a small-diameter interatrial shunt (IAS). Preliminary studies demonstrated excellent balance in contracted and expanded blood volume (preload) and by hypotension and hypertension created with vasoactive drugs (afterload). At a mean aortic pressure of 120 mmHg, heart rate of 120 BPM, cardiac output of 8 L/minute and right atrial pressure of 13 mmHg, the peak IAS flow was 3.2 ml/beat in a right to left direction and 8.0 ml/beat in a left to right direction. The net left to right flow was 4.8 ml/beat. Over a wide range of preload (2 to 20 mmHg) and afterload (45 to 180 mmHg), the left atrial pressure was routinely 5 mm Hg more than the right atrial pressure. Elimination of the VDC reduces the number of components, volume, and weight of the totally implantable artificial heart. The IAS offers a simple solution to a very complex problem and provides a device that is simpler to implant and is possible to explant.\r"

  ".W": "We have shown previously that blood flow pulsations created by intermittent squeezing of the inlet blood line significantly increased the plasma filtration rate in membrane plasmapheresis. However, in order to avoid hemolysis, the filtration increase had to be limited to about 50%. We have now devised a more efficient pulsation generator. By properly matching the tubing compliance and the pulsation amplitude, it is possible to extract 50 ml/min of plasma from 90 ml/min of blood at 36% hematocrit with a 1000 cm2 polypropylene hollow fiber filter without hemolysis. Simultaneous recording of the time course of plasma filtration rate measured by an electromagnetic flow meter and transmembrane showed that the increase in mean plasma flow rate was due to a dynamic filtration process which prevents the establishment of concentration polarization. The transmembrane pressure (Ptm) increases over a 0.5-second interval when the tube is squeezed. The membrane responds with an increase in filtration since the concentration polarization layer takes a few seconds to build up. The Ptm then drops when the tube is released before the polarization layer has time to build up appreciably and a sudden acceleration of the blood flow (velocity spike) helps clean the membrane, reducing the polarization. Tests with bovine show that the system is very efficient in reducing membrane plugging with small area filters.\r"

Fractals are useful to describe the natural irregularity of physiological systems because their irregularity is not truly random and can be demonstrated to have spatial or temporal correlation. The concepts of fractal analysis are introduced from intuitive, visual, and mathematical perspectives. The regional heterogeneities of pulmonary and myocardial flows are discussed as applications of spatial fractal analysis, and methods for estimating a fractal dimension from physiological data are presented. Although the methods used for fractal analyses of physiological data are still under development and will require additional validation, they appear to have great potential for the study of physiology at scales of resolution ranging from the microcirculation to the intact organism.\r"

Repetition of this procedure after 1 h gave responses of comparable magnitude and duration. Anti-platelet antiserum pretreatment did not influence the response of neutrophils to PAF. Iloprost infusion (10 ng.kg-1.min-1 over 15 min) did not affect the response of neutrophils to PAF, whereas accumulation of radiolabeled platelets in the lung was totally suppressed by this dose. Intrathoracic accumulation of neutrophils in response to PAF can be considered to be independent of platelet activation.\r"

ER were studied in the early follicular and midluteal phases of the menstrual cycle. Physical, training, and gynecological characteristics were similar, and cardiorespiratory and metabolic responses to the exercises were indistinguishable in the groups. ACTH, cortisol, and prolactin data from the follicular luteal phases in ER were combined for comparison to AR, because no differences were noted between the menstrual phases at rest. Similar preexercise ACTH levels and responses following exercise occurred in both groups, but preexercise cortisol levels were elevated (ER = 293.1 +/- 46.3, AR = 479.6 +/- 42.4 nmol/l) and cortisol responses blunted in AR. Adrenal sensitivity was blunted in AR compared with ER after submaximal (ER = 121.9 +/- 17.4, AR = 51.7 +/- 13.6) and maximal exercise (ER = 27.9 +/- 9.2, AR = 12.1 +/- 3.8). Preexercise prolactin levels were reduced (ER = 16.4 +/- 2.7, AR = 10 +/- 2.3 micrograms/l), and prolactin responses to maximal exercises were blunted in AR, despite high lactate levels (11.4 +/- 0.4 mmol/l). We conclude that 1) control for menstrual phase in ER is important in studies of prolactin responses following exercise but not in studies of ACTH and cortisol responses following exercise, 2) cortisol responses following submaximal and maximal exercise in AR are blunted at the adrenal level, 3) prolactin responses following submaximal and maximal exercise are also blunted in AR, and 4) prolactin responses following exercise may be mediated by adrenal activation.\r"

Changes in pleural pressure, airflow rate, and lung volume produced by maximal stimulation of both intercostal muscle layers were measured at and above functional residual capacity (FRC). In five animals measurements were also obtained during isolated stimulation of the internal layer. At FRC, intercostal stimulation in the upper interspaces had invariably an inspiratory effect on the lung but no effect was detectable in the lower interspaces. Qualitatively similar results were obtained during isolated stimulation of the internal layer. Increasing lung volume reduced the inspiratory action of the upper intercostals and conferred an expiratory action to the lower intercostals. These results indicate the following: 1) when contracting in a single interspace, the external and internal intercostals have a qualitatively similar action on the lung; and 2) this action, however, depends critically on their location along the cephalocaudal axis of the rib cage: in the upper portion of the rib cage, both muscle layers have an inspiratory effect at and above FRC; in the lower portion of the rib cage, they have no respiratory action at FRC and act in the expiratory direction at higher lung volumes.\r"

  ".W": "A wide variety of neuroactive substances have been suggested to be involved in the respiratory depression observed in response to severe hypoxia. By use of the technique of microdialysis, the release of dopamine (DA) was measured in the nucleus tractus solitarii during severe hypoxic provocations (6% O2 in N2) in the adult pentobarbital-anesthetized rabbit. DA release was analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection. Such hypoxic provocations caused pronounced phase of depression in the phrenic nerve activity and enhanced release of DA. After bilateral carotid sinus nerve denervation, acute severe hypoxia did not give rise to enhanced release of DA or to phrenic nerve depression. Mild hypoxic (9% or 12% O2 in N2) or hypercapnic (6% CO2) stimuli resulted in an increased phrenic nerve activity without any concomitant changes in DA release. Decerebration at the midcollicular level in rabbits prevented an enhanced release of DA in the nucleus tractus solitarii during severe hypoxia. The results suggest that 1) DA is involved in the central ventilatory response to severe hypoxia, 2) not only the initial excitatory but also the second depressive phase in response to severe hypoxia is mediated partially by the peripheral chemoreceptors, and 3) the depressive phase is dependent on intact connections from suprapontine structures.\r"

Measurements were made during atelectasis and again after the lobes were inflated with either a gas mixture (air) or 0.9% saline. Inflation with air resulted in a 20% increase in vascular volume (P less than 0.02), whereas saline inflation had no effect on vascular volume. Inflation with either air or saline increased static vascular compliance by approximately 58% (P less than 0.001) and dynamic vascular compliance by approximately 85% (P less than 0.001). The larger dynamic compliance in the inflated lobes appears to have been mainly due to a larger microvascular compliance. The results suggest that atelectasis can result in a stiffer pulmonary capillary bed. This effect appears to be due primarily to the reconfiguration of the lung tissue structure, because replacing the air with an incompressible fluid did not have the same effect.\r"

Nine healthy subjects were studied to determine the effect of expiratory resistive loads on the electromyographic activity of the thyroarytenoid (TA) muscle, a vocal cord adductor. Four of the nine subjects also underwent the application of inspiratory resistive loads and voluntary prolongation of either inspiratory (TI) or expiratory (TE) time. TA activity was recorded by intramuscular hooked-wire electrodes. During quiet breathing in all subjects, the TA was phasically active on expiration and often tonically active throughout the respiratory cycle. TA expiratory activity progressively increased with increasing levels of expiratory load. Inspiratory loads resulted in increased TA \"inspiratory\" activity. Voluntary prolongation of TE to times similar to those reached during loaded breathing induced increases in TA expiratory activity similar to those reached during the loaded state. Voluntary prolongation of TI was associated with an increase in TA inspiratory activity. Similar increases in TI during inspiratory loading or voluntary conditions were associated with comparable increases in TA inspiratory activity in three of the four subjects. In conclusion, increased activation of TA during the application of expiratory resistive loads implies that the reported narrowing of glottic aperture during expiratory loading is an active phenomenon. Changes in activation of the TA with resistive loads appear to be related to changes in respiratory pattern.\r"

Lungs were perfused with Tyrode's solution osmotically balanced with 1% albumin and 4% dextran and containing the vasodilator papaverine (0.05 mg/ml). Lung volume was varied by negative pleural pressure form 0 to -25 cmH2O. Pulmonary artery (Ppa) and venous (Ppv) pressures were fixed at various levels relative to the lung base. Alveolar pressure (PA) was always zero, and perfusate flow was measured continuously. In zone 1 Ppa was -2.5 cmH2O and Ppv was -15 cmH2O. In zone 2 Ppa was 10 cmH2O and Ppv was -5 cmH2O. In zone 3 Ppa was 15 cmH2O and Ppv was 8 cmH2O. We found that in zone 1 the interface was essential for perfusion, but in zones 2 and 3 it had much lesser effects. In general, PVR depended almost uniquely (i.e., with small hysteresis) on transpulmonary pressure, whereas a large hysteresis existed between PVR and lung volume. PVR was high in collapsed and especially in atelectatic lungs, fell sharply with moderate inflation, and within the ranges of vascular pressure studied did not rise again toward total lung capacity. These results suggest that in zone 1 the interface maintains the patency of some alveolar vessels, probably in corners. The majority of alveolar septal vessels appears to be exposed directly to PA in zones 2 and 3, because at equal transpulmonary pressure the PVR is similar in the presence or absence of an interface.\r"

The corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIo) were compared with those computed from a single set of data (CIL) according to Lutchen and Jackson (J. Appl. Physiol. 62: 403-413, 1987). Ztr was analyzed with the six-coefficient model of DuBois et al. (J. Appl. Physiol. 8: 587-594, 1956), which includes airway resistance (Raw) and inertance (Iaw), tissue resistance (Rti), inertance (Iti), and compliance (Cti), and alveolar gas compressibility (Cg). The lowest variability was seen for Iaw (CIo = 11.1%), closely followed by Raw (14.3%) and Cti (14.8%), and the largest for Rti and Iti (24.6 and 93.6%, respectively). Using a simpler model, where Iti was excluded, significantly decreased the variability of Iaw (P less than 0.01) and Rti (P less than 0.05) but was responsible for a systematic decrease of Raw and Iaw and increase of Rti. Except for Raw with both models and Iaw with the simpler model, CIL was greater than CIo. Whatever the model, a high correlation between both sets of confidence intervals was found for Rti and Iaw, whereas no correlation was seen for Raw. This suggests that the variability of the former coefficients mainly reflects experimental noise, whereas that of the latter is largely due to biological variability.\r"

In six anesthetized open-chest dogs, left phrenic vein blood flow (Qphv) was measured by pulsed Doppler flowmetry. Contractility was measured by sonomicrometry in the left costal and crural diaphragm. The diaphragm was paced for 15 min by continuous bilateral supramaximal phrenic nerve stimulation. In five separate runs the following arteries were occluded at minute 5: 1) left phrenic artery, 2) internal mammary artery (IMA), 3) left phrenic artery and IMA, 4) descending aorta, and 5) descending aorta and IMA. Occlusion was then released at minute 10 of the run. In runs 1-3 there were no changes in contractility in costal or crural diaphragm and no changes in Qphv. However, in runs 4 and 5, Qphv decreased to 55.2 +/- 7.4 and 24.0 +/- 6.5% of control values, respectively. In run 4, percent maximum shortening from functional residual capacity (%LFRC) of the crural diaphragm decreased by 39.1%, while %LFRC of the costal diaphragm increased by 41.4% and abdominal pressure decreased by 47.0%.

  ".W": "On the basis of its potent proinflammatory and spasmogenic effects, N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (FMLP), a bacterial oligopeptide, is a putative mediator of bronchoconstriction and airway inflammation during bacterial bronchial infection. However, after an FMLP dose-response curve in rabbits, tachyphylaxis to a second challenge was seen in some rabbits and airway inflammation was absent. This study was designed to reproduce the more prolonged airway exposure to FMLP that may occur during bacterial infection. Two groups of rabbits received FMLP [5 mg/ml in 66% dimethyl sulfoxide- (DMSO) saline] or DMSO diluent alone by nebulization every 15 min for 2 h. Pulmonary resistance (RL) was measured at 1 and 2 h. Recovery from bronchoconstriction was also assessed by measuring RL every 30 min for 2 h after the final FMLP administration. Sections of trachea and large bronchi were prepared and graded by quadrant from 0 to 3 for inflammation, a total score from 0 to 12 being given for each section. There was a progressive increase in RL in FMLP-treated rabbits, reaching 68 +/- 9% above baseline after 120 min, a significantly greater change than after diluent, 8 +/- 12% (P less than 0.01). RL remained elevated above baseline for 90 min after the final FMLP dose. Inflammation scores were greater after FMLP than DMSO: 9.3 +/- 0.5 vs. 4.3 +/- 0.7 (P less than 0.01) in trachea and 5.2 +/- 0.4 vs. 1.7 +/- 0.5 (P less than 0.01) in lobar bronchi. We conclude that prolonged exposure of airways to FMLP produces a sustained increase in RL and airway inflammation, the cardinal features of infective exacerbations of chronic airflow limitation.\r"

  ".W": "Zero-stress state of the main pulmonary arteries, from the main trunk to a vessel with a lumen diameter approximately 60 microns, was determined in 25 normal control and 38 hypoxic pulmonary hypertensive rats. Pulmonary hypertension was induced by placing the rats in a hypoxic chamber with 10% O2-90% N2 at atmospheric pressure. The zero-stress state of each vessel was obtained by first cutting the vessel transversely into a series of rings and then cutting each ring radially, whereupon the ring opened into a sector, which is characterized by an opening angle defined as the angle subtended between two lines originating from the midpoint of the inner wall (endothelium) to the tips of the inner wall. Whereas the pulmonary blood pressure increased monotonically during the development of pulmonary hypertension, the opening angle followed a different course; e.g., the values (means +/- SD) of the opening angle at the pulmonary trunk at times 0 (control) and 2, 12, 28, 96, 144, 240, 480, and 720 h after exposure to hypoxia are, respectively, 294 +/- 30 degrees, 378 +/- 24 degrees, 385 +/- 12 degrees, 374 +/- 11 degrees, 246 +/- 63 degrees, 267 +/- 49 degrees, 193 +/- 19 degrees, 195 +/- 83 degrees, and 239 +/- 38 degrees. Trends at other places on the artery are similar, but the magnitudes differ. In this period of time, intimal edema and thickening were found. The intima media thickened rapidly from 48 to 240 h and then more slowly from 240 to 720 h. Adventitia thickened later; its thickness exceeded that of the intima media at approximately 96 h. Thus the changes of zero-stress state of the pulmonary arteries are seen to be related to the nonuniform remodeling of the vessel wall as revealed by the edema, blebs, and thickening of different layers.\r"

Although PMN are known to be activated by ZAP, it is unclear whether PMN delayed in the lung by ZAP infusion actually cause lung injury. The present study was designed to examine this question by measuring airway epithelial and endothelial injury. Airway epithelial injury was determined by depositing a known dose of fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled dextran in the lung and measuring its appearance in the blood, and endothelial injury was measured by injecting colloidal carbon and measuring its accumulation in the microvasculature of the lung. The data show that ZAP infusion caused a mild epithelial and endothelial injury that did not increase either extravascular water or protein. This injury could be prevented either by depleting the animals of PMN or by pretreating them with indomethacin. In addition, the effect of ZAP infusion could be partially restored by transfusing donor PMN into the PMN-depleted animals. We conclude that ZAP infusion produces a mild lung injury that is dependent on PMN and the products of the cyclooxygenase pathway of arachidonic acid metabolism.\r"

The primary aim of the present study was to determine the role of arousal in the termination of apnea in preterm infants. Videorecording was used to identify spontaneous behavioral arousal in a group of healthy full-term (n = 7) and preterm (n = 10) infants before and during polygraphic monitoring of cardiorespiratory variables and in a group of preterm infants with apnea (n = 10) during similar polygraphic monitoring. Spontaneous arousal rates (mean +/- SE) in full-term infants before and during polygraphic monitoring were 0.18 +/- 0.03 and 0.23 +/- 0.07 episodes/min, respectively. Corresponding values in nonapneic preterm infants were 0.24 +/- 0.03 and 0.24 +/- 0.02 episodes/min. In apneic preterm infants, mean spontaneous arousal rate during polygraphic recording was 0.26 +/- 0.02, but it was considerably higher during apneic sleep periods (0.59 +/- 0.17) than during nonapneic sleep periods (0.25 +/- 0.01). The frequency of occurrence of arousal was significantly higher (P less than 0.005) in long vs. short apnea, mixed vs. central apnea, and severe vs. mild apnea. Although a clear association between arousal and apneic resolution was observed in preterm infants, lack of arousal responses in a large number of apneic episodes suggests that behavioral arousal is not essential for the termination of apnea in these infants.\r"

Overload was induced by way of a bilateral tenotomy of the MG's functional synergists coupled to a daily walking training program (15 m/min, 30% incline, up to 60 min per session, 12-18 wks). This latter condition ensured that the MG were used on a regular basis. In comparison to control values, overloaded MG showed 25 and 19% increases (P less than 0.05) in muscle wet weight and protein concentration, respectively. The content in AChe (activity per muscle) was also increased in these MG (28%, P less than 0.05). Sedimentation analyses revealed a general elevation in the content of AChe molecular forms, with A8, G2, and G1 displaying significant changes (35-42%, P less than 0.05). In a second group of rats, daily running training (27 m/min, 30% incline, using the same timetable) was supplemented to the compensatory overload. In this group, the additional running training led to a greater hypertrophic response as attested to by increases (P less than 0.05) in the MG wet weight (41%) and protein concentration (35%) in comparison to controls. However, total AChe content of these muscles was increased to an extent similar to that observed in the MG subjected only to compensatory overload (24%, P less than 0.05).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The biochemical regulation of this ion transport mechanism is still under investigation. In this study we evaluated the effect of an adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (cAMP) analogue [dibutyryl cAMP (DBcAMP)] and a phosphodiesterase inhibitor (aminophylline) given alone or together on lung liquid and protein clearance. To study lung liquid and protein clearance, we measured the removal of 100 ml of autologous serum from the air spaces of anesthetized and ventilated adult sheep. Either serum alone or serum mixed with 10(-3) M DBcAMP, 10(-3) M or 10(-5) M aminophylline, or 10(-3) M aminophylline plus 10(-3) M DBcAMP was instilled. After 4 h, the residual lung water was 73.5 +/- 8.7 ml when serum alone was instilled and 56.8 +/- 13.6 ml when aminophylline and DBcAMP were given together. Neither aminophylline nor DBcAMP alone increased lung liquid clearance. However, the increase in clearance cannot be explained by an increase in protein clearance or changes in the pulmonary hemodynamics. These data suggest that the cAMP second messenger system can stimulate lung liquid clearance in vivo.\r"

Maximal tetanic tension (Po) was reduced after 30 min of PS (P less than 0.001), IC (P less than 0.001), or EC (P less than 0.0001). However, the magnitude of the force deficit was a function of the treatment method. After 30 min of cyclic PS, Po decreased by 13%, whereas after IC or EC, Po decreased by 31 and 69%, respectively. The time course of tension decline in the various groups suggested that the EC-induced injury occurred during the first few minutes of treatment. Although the morphology of samples from the PS and IC groups appeared normal, eccentrically exercised muscles exhibited portions of abnormally large fibers (diam greater than or equal to 110 microns) when viewed in cross section. Examination of 231 such fibers from 6 muscles revealed that all enlarged fibers were exclusively of the fast-twitch glycolytic fiber type. Although no ultrastructural abnormalities were observed in any of the muscles from the IC or PS groups, a significant portion of the fibers in the EC group displayed various degrees of disorganization of the sarcomeric band pattern. Taken together, these studies highlight the importance of fiber oxidative capacity in EC-induced injury, which may be related to the damage mechanism.\r"

With hypercapnia, the masseter was generally recruited after the genioglossus had been activated. Once recruited, activation of both muscles increased linearly with increasing CO2. Combined hypercapnia and loading produced more activation than either stimulus alone. These data indicate that the masseter is activated by ventilatory stimuli that activate the genioglossus. Earlier recruitment of the genioglossus suggests that activation of the masseter serves to stabilize the mandible and allow the genioglossus to function as a more efficient dilator of the upper airway.\r"

Raw EMG signals for 10-20 step or stroke cycles were rectified, averaged, and processed to determine cycle period (EMG onset of one cycle to EMG onset of the next cycle), EMG burst duration, and integrated area of the rectified burst (IEMG). Mean EMG per burst was calculated as IEMG/burst duration. IEMG/min was calculated as IEMG times the number of bursts (cycles) per minute. Cycle period and burst duration of the extensors decreased hyperbolically, while the TA burst duration was unchanged, with increased treadmill speed. With increased treadmill speed, IEMG was decreased in the Sol and unchanged in the MG and TA, whereas IEMG/min decreased in the Sol and increased in the MG and TA. An elevation in treadmill incline resulted in an increase in the activation levels of the MG but not in the Sol or TA. These data indicate that the additional power required at increased speeds and/or inclines of treadmill locomotion is derived from the recruitment of the fast extensors, e.g., the MG. The mean cycle period during swimming was similar to that observed during the fastest treadmill locomotion. EMG burst durations and amplitudes, however, were higher in the TA, relatively similar in the MG, and lower in the Sol during swimming than treadmill locomotion.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The present study was designed to test the hypothesis that the changes in natural killer (NK) cell activity in response to physical exercise were mediated by increased epinephrine concentrations. Eight healthy volunteers 1) exercised on a bicycle ergometer (60 min, 75% of maximal O2 uptake) and 2) on a later day were given epinephrine as an intravenous infusion to obtain plasma epinephrine concentrations comparable with those seen during exercise. Blood samples were collected in the basal state, during the last minutes of exercise or epinephrine infusion, and 2 h later. The NK cell activity (lysis/fixed number of mononuclear cells) increased during exercise and epinephrine infusion and dropped below basal levels 2 h afterward. The increased NK cell activity during exercise and the epinephrine infusion resulted from an increased concentration of NK (CD16+) cells in the peripheral blood. On the other hand, the decreased NK cell activity demonstrated 2 h after exercise and epinephrine infusion did not simply reflect preferential removal of NK cells from the blood, because the proportion of CD16+ cells was normalized. On the basis of the finding that indomethacin abolished the suppressed NK cell activity in vitro and the demonstration of a twofold increase in the proportion of monocytes (CD14+ cells) 2 h after exercise and epinephrine infusion, we suggest that, after stress, prostaglandins released by monocytes are responsible for downregulation of NK cell function. Our findings support the hypothesis that increased plasma epinephrine during physical stress causes a redistribution of mononuclear subpopulations that results in altered function of NK cells.\r"

Tonic AN and AB stimulations shortened TI and TE with no change in PPNG, while tonic CSN and CB stimulations shortened TE, increased PPNG, and transiently lengthened TI. Phasic AB and AN stimulations throughout inspiration shortened TI with no changes in PPNG or the following TE; however, similar phasic stimulations of the CB and CSN increased both TI and PPNG and decreased the following TE. Phasic AN stimulation during expiration decreased TE and the following TI with no change in PPNG. Similar stimulations of the CB and CSN decreased TE; however, the following TI and PPNG were increased. These findings differ from those found in the cat and suggest that aortic chemoreceptors affect mainly phase timing, while carotid chemoreceptors affect both timing and respiratory drive.\r"

  ".W": "To determine whether microvessels in resting or contracting skeletal muscle constrict during baroreceptor activation, vascular diameters were measured in the spinotrapezius muscle of adult rats (n = 12) during occlusion of the common carotid arteries. Neural and myogenic components were distinguished using two types of occlusion: 1) \"normal\" (arterial pressure was allowed to increase with baroreceptor activation) and 2) \"isobaric\" (arterial pressure was maintained constant by decreasing blood volume). During normal occlusions, intermediate and small arteriolar diameters decreased in resting and contracting muscle (10-15% and 25-30%, respectively). Large arterioles and all-sized venules distended slightly (approximately 5%) in resting muscle, but diameters were maintained or decreased in contracting muscle. When arterial pressure was maintained constant (isobaric), the microvascular responses to baroreceptor activation in both resting and contracting muscle were essentially eliminated. We conclude that nearly all the arteriolar constriction observed in the spinotrapezius muscle during normal carotid artery occlusion is myogenic in origin, secondary to increased arterial pressure. This pressure-dependent constriction is augmented during skeletal muscle contraction and functional vasodilation.\r"

We measured Q (ml.min-1.100 g-1) in each intercostal space (ICS) during spontaneous breathing, inspiratory resistive loading, and mechanical ventilation following paralysis. At necropsy the EI, II, and PS were excised and sampled separately for each ICS. During paralysis there was no consistent gradient in Q among the PS, II, and EI muscles. During spontaneous breathing, Q to PS increased linearly by 125% between the first and fourth to sixth ICS, Q to EI decreased progressively from the first/second ICS to the fifth/sixth ICS, whereas Q to the II was uniform. During inspiratory resistive loading, in which mouth pressures of -16 +/- 4 cmH2O were generated, the PS gradient was similar to that during spontaneous breathing. Also, Q to the EI increased in the cranial interspaces (P less than 0.02), whereas Q to the II of the seventh/eighth ICS was greater than that of the first/second ICS (P less than 0.001). Furthermore, with loading, ventrodorsal gradients in Q appeared within both EI and II interspaces. There was no consistent gradient in Q within the transversus thoracis muscle during any of the interventions. Our results demonstrate nonuniform Q within PS, EI, and II during both spontaneous and inspiratory resistive loaded breathing. On the assumption that changes in Q reflect changes in activation, our results suggest systematic topographical patterns of recruitment of rib cage respiratory muscles.\r"

To evaluate presynaptic regulation of kNE, conscious guinea pigs subjected to normoxia and then hypoxia (n = 7-8 in each group) were pretreated with 1) vehicle; 2) a cholinergic muscarinic antagonist, methyl atropine; 3) an alpha 2-antagonist, yohimbine; or 4) a combination of the two. An increase of kNE was determined from incorporation of radiolabeled tyrosine into NE in a control period (arterial PO2 130 +/- 1.7 Torr, PCO2 36 +/- 0.5 Torr) and during a hypoxic state (PO2 49.6 +/- 1.0 Torr, PCO2 36 +/- 0.5 Torr). Hypoxia activated kNE in the atrioventricular node and right ventricular moderator band in vehicle-treated animals (P less than 0.05). Sympathetic activation was more general, however, because alpha 2-presynaptic influence acted to limit kNE in all tissues tested (P less than 0.05) except muscle, spleen, and posterior left ventricle. Cholinergic muscarinic presynaptic restraint on kNE was detected during hypoxia only in the left atrial appendage and lung (P less than 0.05). These data indicate that hypoxia increases kNE in the heart, but restraint by cholinergic muscarinic and alpha 2-adrenergic presynaptic mechanisms limits increases in neurotransmitter synthesis and noradrenergic activation regionally.\r"

We investigated the TP to determine the influence of sleep on TP muscle activity and the relationship between changing TP activity and upper airway resistance over the entire night and during short sleep-awake transitions. Seven normal male subjects were studied on a single night with wire electrodes placed in both TP muscles. Sleep stage, inspiratory airflow, transpalatal pressure, and TP moving time average electromyogram (EMG) were continuously recorded. In addition, in two of the seven subjects the activity (EMG) of both the TP and the genioglossus muscle simultaneously was recorded throughout the night. Upper airway resistance increased progressively from wakefulness through the various non-rapid-eye-movement sleep stages, as has been previously described. The TP EMG did not commonly demonstrate phasic activity during wakefulness or sleep. However, the tonic EMG decreased progressively and significantly (P less than 0.05) from wakefulness through the non-rapid-eye-movement sleep stages [awake, 4.6 +/- 0.3 (SE) arbitrary units; stage 1, 2.6 +/- 0.3; stage 2, 1.7 +/- 0.5; stage 3/4, 1.5 +/- 0.8]. The mean correlation coefficient between TP EMG and upper airway resistance across all sleep states was (-0.46). This mean correlation improved over discrete sleep-awake transitions (-0.76). No sleep-induced decrement in the genioglossus activity was observed in the two subjects studied.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

They performed multiple MEFV maneuvers at 0, 1, and approximately 2 G. The MEFV curves for each subject were filtered, aligned at residual volume, and ensemble averaged to produce an average MEFV curve for each state, allowing differences to be studied. Most subjects showed a decrease in the forced vital capacity at 0 G, which we attribute to an increased intrathoracic blood volume. In most of these subjects, the mean lung volume associated with a given flow was lower at 0 G over about the upper half of the vital capacity. This is similar to the change previously reported during headout immersion and is consistent with the known effect of engorgement of the lung with blood on elastic recoil. There were also consistent but highly individual changes in the position and magnitude of detailed features of the curve, the individual patterns being similar to those previously reported on transition from the erect to the supine position. This supports the idea that the location and motion of choke points that determine the detailed individual configuration of MEFV curves can be significantly influenced by gravitational forces, presumably via the effects of change in longitudinal tension on local airway pressure-diameter behavior and thus wave speed.\r"

The elusive nature of sleep imposes major methodological restrictions on examination of this question. We have now measured CBF and CMRO2 in young healthy volunteers using the Kety-Schmidt technique with 133Xe as the inert gas. Measurements were performed during wakefulness, deep sleep (stage 3/4), and rapid-eye-movement (REM) sleep as verified by standard polysomnography. Contrary to the only previous study in humans, which reported an insignificant 3% reduction in CMRO2 during sleep, we found a deep-sleep-associated statistically highly significant 25% decrease in CMRO2, a magnitude of depression according with studies of glucose uptake and reaching levels otherwise associated with light anesthesia. During REM sleep (dream sleep) CMRO2 was practically the same as in the awake state. Changes in CBF paralleled changes in CMRO2 during both deep and REM sleep.\r"

  ".W": "Pulmonary and chest wall mechanics were studied in 18 anesthetized paralyzed supine humans by use of the technique of rapid airway occlusion during constant-flow inflation. Analysis of the changes in transpulmonary pressure after flow interruption allowed partitioning of the overall resistance of the lung (RL) into two compartments, one (Rint,L) reflecting airway resistance and the other (delta RL) representing the viscoelastic properties of the pulmonary tissues. Similar analysis of the changes in esophageal pressure indicates that chest wall resistance (RW) was due entirely to the viscoelastic properties of the chest wall tissues (delta RW = RW). In line with previous measurements of airway resistance, Rint,L increased with increasing flow and decreased with increasing volume. The opposite was true for both delta RL and delta RW. This behavior was interpreted in terms of a viscoelastic model that allowed computation of the viscoelastic constants of the lung and chest wall. This model also accounts for frequency, volume, and flow dependence of elastance of the lung and chest wall. Static and dynamic elastances, as well as delta R, were higher for the lung than for the chest wall.\r"

Because the abdomen forms part of the \"chest wall,\" the purpose of this study was to clarify the effects of AD on ventilatory mechanics. Airway pressure, four (vertical) regional pleural pressures, and abdominal pressure were measured in five anesthetized, paralyzed, and ventilated upright pigs. The effects of AD on the lung and chest wall were studied by inflating a liquid-filled balloon placed in the abdominal cavity. Respiratory system, chest wall, and lung pressure-volume (PV) relationships were measured on deflation from total lung capacity to residual volume, as well as in the tidal breathing range, before and 15 min after abdominal pressure was raised. Increasing abdominal pressure from 3 to 15 cmH2O decreased total lung capacity and functional residual capacity by approximately 40% and shifted the respiratory system and chest wall PV curves downward and to the right. Much smaller downward shifts in lung deflation curves were seen, with no change in the transdiaphragmatic PV relationship. All regional pleural pressures increased (became less negative) and, in the dependent region, approached 0 cmH2O at functional residual capacity. Tidal compliances of the respiratory system, chest wall, and lung were decreased 43, 42, and 48%, respectively. AD markedly alters respiratory system mechanics primarily by \"stiffening\" the diaphragm/abdomen part of the chest wall and secondarily by restricting lung expansion, thus shifting the lung PV curve as seen after chest strapping. The less negative pleural pressures in the dependent lung regions suggest that nonuniformities of ventilation could also be accentuated and gas exchange impaired by AD.\r"

The current literature reports only the responses of OHT patients to greater than or equal to 4 mo of exercise training (ET) and frequently lacks adequate controls. Most programs currently treating OHT patients usually provide 6-12 wk of ET. This study describes the effects of a 10-wk supervised ET program in 12 male OHT patients and 5 other male OHT patients who served as a comparison group. Graded exercise tests were performed before and after ET. After ET, maximal O2 consumption was significantly greater for the ET group than the comparison group (P less than 0.05) and the mean increase in peak heart rate was 18 +/- 4 and 6 +/- 4 (SE) min-1 for ET and comparison groups, respectively (P less than 0.05). Maximal ventilation was also significantly greater for the ET group at after ET, while resting heart rate and blood pressure and peak blood pressure, O2 pulse, respiratory rate, and ventilatory equivalents for O2 and CO2 were not significantly changed. We conclude that after OHT a 10-wk ET program improves maximal O2 consumption and, by improving peak heart rate, improves O2 delivery.\r"

Subjects breathed against expiratory resistances at their own breathing frequency and tidal volume until exhaustion or for 60 min. Respiratory muscle strength was assessed from both the maximum static expiratory and inspiratory mouth pressures (PEmax and PImax). At the lowest resistance, PEmax and PImax measured after completion of the expiratory loaded breathing were not different from control values. With higher resistance, both PEmax and PImax were decreased (P less than 0.05), and the decrease lasted for greater than or equal to 60 min. The electromyogram high-to-low frequency power ratio for the rectus abdominis muscle decreased progressively during loading (P less than 0.01), but the integrated EMG activity did not change during recovery. Transdiaphragmatic pressure during loading was increased 3.6-fold compared with control (P less than 0.05). These findings suggest that expiratory resistive loaded breathing induces muscle fatigue in both expiratory and inspiratory muscles. Fatigue of the expiratory muscles can be attributed directly to the high work load and that of the inspiratory muscles may be related to increased work due to shortened inspiratory time.\r"

Quantitative lung histology indicated progressive sequestration of PMN in the lungs, 25 +/- 3 (SE) PMN/10 high-power fields (HPF) 10 min after reperfusion vs. 20 +/- 2 PMN/10 HPF in sham animals (NS), increasing to 53 +/- 5 PMN/10 HPF after 4 h vs. 23 +/- 3 PMN/10 HPF in sham animals (P less than 0.01).

Similarly, there was edema, shown by the lung wet-to-dry weight ratio, which increased by 4 h to 4.70 +/- 0.12 vs. 4.02 +/- 0.17 in sham animals (P less than 0.01). There was generation of leukotriene B4 in BAL fluid (720 +/- 140 vs. 240 +/- 40 pg/ml, P less than 0.01), and in three of six rats tested at this time TNF was detected in plasma, with a mean value of 167 pg/ml.

Cardiac output, stroke volume, and left ventricular ejection fractions were determined using radionuclide angiographic techniques at rest and during exercise on a cycle ergometer at 40, 60, and 90% of a previously determined maximal O2 consumption. Subjects at rest were subjected to two-dimensional and M-mode echocardiograms and a standard 12-lead electrocardiogram. Hemoglobin and hematocrit were measured on arrival at sea level by use of a Coulter Stacker S+ analyzer. After a 6-wk deacclimation period, all variables were remeasured using the identical methodology. Hemoglobin values decreased significantly over the deacclimation period (15.7 +/- 1.1 to 13.5 +/- 1.2 g/dl; P less than 0.01). The results indicate that the removal of these high-altitude-adapted natives from 4,300 m to sea level for 6 wk results in only minor changes to the cardiac structure and function as measured by these noninvasive techniques.\r"
