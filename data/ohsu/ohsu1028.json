  ".W": "Transesophageal and transthoracic echocardiography and color flow Doppler were performed in patients with 42 normal and 20 dysfunctioning bioprosthetic mitral and aortic valves. Transesophageal echocardiography was superior to the transthoracic approach in delineating bioprosthetic valve cusps and the presence of valve thickening due to valve degeneration. In 27 clinically normal bioprosthetic mitral valves, regurgitation was demonstrated in three patients by the transthoracic approach and in seven by transesophageal study. Both transesophageal and transthoracic color flow Doppler demonstrated mitral regurgitation in 17 clinically regurgitant valves. The severity of mitral regurgitation was accurately assessed by the transesophageal study in all 13 patients who underwent angiography, whereas the transthoracic imaging underestimated valvular regurgitation in 7 of the 13 cases (54%). Bioprosthetic aortic valves were normal on clinical examination in 15 patients and were regurgitant in three others. Both transthoracic and transesophageal color flow Doppler were of equal value in observing and quantifying aortic regurgitation. In five clinically normal and regurgitant mitral and aortic valves, transesophageal color flow Doppler revealed eccentric regurgitant jets suggestive of paravalvular leak. This feature was not evident by the transthoracic approach. In conclusion, transesophageal echocardiography and color flow Doppler are superior to transthoracic imaging in estimating bioprosthetic mitral, but not aortic regurgitation, in differentiating valvular from paravalvular regurgitation, and in demonstrating thickened valves due to cusp degeneration.\r"

Saline (n = 7), serum (n = 4), blood (10% hematocrit [n = 5]; 20% hematocrit [n = 5]), and lipid (n = 4) effusions were chosen to resemble: (1) transudative/exudative, (2) nonhemorrhagic/hemorrhagic, and (3) chylous effusions, respectively. There was a linear correlation between the infused volume and the pericardial/epicardial distance measurements on the nuclear magnetic resonance images. Hemorrhagic and nonhemorrhagic exudative effusions were distinguished from transudative effusions by the low signal intensity of transudative effusions images obtained at a TR (repetition time) of 400 and 800 msec. Nonhemorrhagic effusions had significantly lower effusion-to-myocardial signal intensity ratio at TR of 400 msec than did hemorrhagic effusions. Differences in hematocrit were not appreciated qualitatively or quantitatively. Compared with other effusion types, only chylous effusions were hyperintense to myocardium at a TR of 400 msec. Chylous effusions were further uniquely characterized by a decreasing effusion-to-myocardial signal intensity ratio with increasing TR. These experimental findings corroborate the findings of earlier clinical reports and suggest that NMR can provide important assistance in the evaluation of pericardial effusions.\r"

Following dialysis, body weight decreased and heart rate increased equally in both groups. Ejection fraction did not change in the two groups. Left ventricular end-diastolic volume fell by 13 +/- 10% in group A and by 24 +/- 16% in group B. Cardiac index (CI) fell in group B, but remained unchanged in group A. Systemic vascular resistance (SVR) did not change in both groups. The change in mean AP before and after dialysis was significantly correlated with that in Cl (r = 0.49, p less than 0.05), but not with that in SVR. Calf venous pressure-volume curves were not different between the two groups before dialysis. Hemodialysis shifted the curve toward the volume axis for group B but not for group A. These results suggest that hypotension following dialysis is mainly due to the fall in cardiac output, in which increases in venous distensibility play an important role.\r"

Experimental data in animals and preliminary studies in humans have demonstrated that early administration of captopril, an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, may limit infarct expansion and will attenuate progressive LV dilatation.

By interrupting this chain of events, perhaps at multiple sites, it may be possible to prevent or slow the development of symptomatic heart disease and hopefully prolong life. Many opportunities exist for obtaining further information regarding the underlying pathophysiology, the fundamental mechanisms of action of interventions designed to prevent and/or treat the development of myocardial ischemia and cardiac failure and for effecting favorably the natural history of various forms of heart disease.\r"

  ".W": "Epidemiologic research indicates that glucose intolerance and hypertension are interrelated phenomena, each powerfully predisposing to atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Both diabetic and hypertensive patients have greater amounts of atherogenic risk factors, including dyslipidemia, hyperuricemia, elevated fibrinogen, and left ventricular hypertrophy. Diabetic persons have an increased prevalence of hypertension (50%), and glucose intolerance is more common in hypertension (15% to 18%). Both share a strong relationship to excess weight, but the excess of hypertension in diabetic persons occurs in both lean and obese subjects. Diabetes doubles the risk of hypertension associated with overweight. The risk of coronary disease, stroke, and peripheral arterial disease increases with increasing blood pressure to the same degree in diabetic persons as in nondiabetic persons, but at any level of blood pressure, diabetic persons have a doubled risk of these outcomes. Both diabetic and hypertensive patients are particularly prone to silent or unrecognized myocardial infarctions. Greater efforts at primary prevention of both hypertension and diabetes are clearly needed, including efforts at weight control, exercise, limitation of salt intake, and control of blood lipid levels. In either diabetic or hypertensive candidates for cardiovascular disease, optimization of the chances of avoiding sequelae requires a comprehensive multifactorial approach. Prevention requires more than normalization of either the blood sugar or blood pressure. Rational preventive measures must also include weight reduction, a fat-modified diet, cessation of smoking cigarettes, raising high-density lipoprotein, lowering low-density lipoprotein, and reduction of fibrinogen. Hypertension, obesity, insulin resistance, hyperinsulinemia, hypertriglyceridemia, and low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol tend to coexist.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Evidence to suggest that insulin resistance is a marker for an \"atherogenic syndrome\" is reviewed.

  ".W": "The basic mechanisms that initiate and sustain hypertension in the diabetic population are poorly understood. Obesity, insulin, genetic factors, and abnormalities in calcium homeostasis may contribute, and could be related to an elevated Na+/H+ antiport activity. In the first study described in this investigation, hypertensive subjects with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) who had an elevated Na+/Li+ countertransport activity were found to have a lower whole body glucose utilization, a lower insulin-stimulated forearm carbohydrate oxidation, larger ultrasound kidney volume, and increased left ventricular mass index when compared with hypertensive IDDM subjects with a normal Na+/Li+ countertransport activity or normotensive IDDM subjects. Thus an elevated Na+/Li+ countertransport activity appears to identify a subset of IDDM patients who are more susceptible to the development of the renal and cardiac complications associated with hypertension. This underlines the importance of choosing an appropriate antihypertensive therapy that will not produce a deterioration in glucose and lipid metabolism. In the second part of the report, results are presented for the treatment of hypertensive patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus with doxazosin. The selective alpha 1-inhibitor produced a significant reduction in blood pressure, together with favorable changes in the serum lipid profile. As a result, the calculated risk of developing coronary heart disease was significantly reduced. Throughout the study no patients required a dose reduction or discontinuation of doxazosin because of side effects, and no clinically significant changes in laboratory tests were apparent. Thus doxazosin could be considered a useful antihypertensive agent in hypertensive patients with IDDM who are insulin-resistant and who have renal and cardiac abnormalities.\r"

Hypertension and dyslipidemia may be the major determinants of macrovascular disease in these patients. With the high prevalence of hypertension in NIDDM, antihypertensive drugs are likely to be important determinants of an atherogenic lipid profile. To date, there is no completed major randomized controlled trial of antihypertensive treatment outcome in a diabetic population, and as such, drug choice for the treatment of diabetic hypertension is often based on evidence extrapolated from studies in nondiabetic groups. However, two short-term studies have assessed the effects of doxazosin antihypertensive therapy in subjects with NIDDM. Both studies showed that the significant reduction in blood pressure with doxazosin treatment was associated with favorable effects on the serum lipid profile. In one study, contrasting adverse effects of atenolol treatment on glycemic control, lipids, and lipoproteins were observed. Doxazosin therapy was associated with a trend toward correcting the disturbances of lipoprotein metabolism characteristic of NIDDM. These metabolic effects, combined with effective lowering of blood pressure by doxazosin, may be important determinants of cardiovascular disease in the long term.\r"

  ".W": "To clarify the long-term effects of alpha-adrenergic blockade on blood pressure, glucose, and lipid metabolism, a selective alpha 1-adrenergic inhibitor (prazosin, 1.0 to 2.0 mg/day in divided doses) was administered as a single antihypertensive agent to 10 (four men and six women, aged 52 to 76 years) hypertensive patients (systolic blood pressure [SBP] greater than or equal to 150 mm Hg or diastolic blood pressure [DBP] greater than or equal to 90 mm Hg) with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) for up to 20 weeks. Blood pressure, glucose tolerance and immunoreactive insulin (IRI) response to 75 gm oral glucose load, hemoglobin A1 (Hb A1), serum lipid profile, and serum apolipoprotein were examined before and after treatment. SBP and DBP were significantly reduced at 20 weeks after treatment with the selective alpha 1-adrenergic inhibitor (SBP 167 +/- 6 mm Hg versus 152 +/- 7 mm Hg; DBP 81 +/- 3 mm Hg versus 76 +/- 3 mm Hg, (p less than 0.05 and p less than 0.01, respectively). Glucose tolerance and IRI response to glucose load were not significantly changed at 4 and 12 to 20 weeks after selective alpha 1-inhibitor treatment compared with the baseline data before treatment; the level of Hb A1 was not significantly changed at 4 and 20 weeks after treatment.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Following 26 weeks of treatment with doxazosin, supine and standing blood pressures were significantly decreased at a final mean daily dose of 6.4 mg. Blood glucose levels were significantly lower at 26 weeks than after the initial placebo period (p less than 0.05) or after 4 weeks' treatment with doxazosin (p less than 0.001). There was a significant (p less than 0.05) decrease in serum insulin levels following 4 weeks of treatment, and a highly significant (p less than 0.001) decrease after 26 weeks. In addition, doxazosin produced a significant reduction in total cholesterol (p less than 0.05) and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol (p less than 0.01) after 26 weeks, although the levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) cholesterol, and triglycerides showed no significant change. There was a tendency for the ratio of HDL: total cholesterol to increase. The combined changes in blood pressure, blood glucose levels, serum insulin, and serum lipids favorably affect the probability of developing coronary heart disease (CHD).\r"

Sixteen men in two groups matched for weight, height, hemoglobin, and physical-work capacity followed a crossover protocol with 6-wk supplementation and control periods. Productivity was assessed over the final 3 wk of each period by quantifying piece-rate-paid road building. Supplementation comprised an ad libitum supply of highly palatable energy-dense food provided three times daily. Outcome variables were total loads transported, loads per working hour, time per load, total energy expenditure assessed by doubly labeled water and heart-rate monitoring, postwork activity, and anthropometry. Body weight decreased during control periods, indicating a real energy deficit, and increased during supplementation in both groups. Supplementation had no significant impact on productivity variables. Energy-deficient men can maintain maximal productivity over short periods if sufficiently motivated but at the expense of body weight.\r"

Subjects were 503 adults [49% non-Hispanic white (NHW), 51% Hispanic]. Physical activity at work rather than leisure-time activity largely determined total energy expenditure. Average EE at work increased with work rank for all subjects combined [mean EE (SEE) for rank 1 (low) = 324.2 (24.4), rank 4 (high) = 874.0 (102.1)] and within sex, ethnic, and occupational subgroups. Leisure EE increased with leisure rank only for NHW men and employed women. Similar patterns were observed in comparisons of PAR data with history of vigorous activity. Further development and validation of instruments appropriate for use across population subgroups are needed.\r"

The elderly subjects had lower mean height (P less than 0.001), weight (P less than 0.01), and fat-free mass (P less than 0.001) but higher percent body fat (P less than 0.01) than did the young adults. Absolute 24EE, basal metabolic rate (BMR), and sleeping metabolic rate were significantly lower (P less than 0.01) in the elderly subjects than in the young subjects. However, after differences in fat-free mass, fat mass, and sex were adjusted for, only BMR was found to be lower in the elderly subjects (P less than 0.01). Despite a reduced adjusted BMR in older subjects, sedentary 24EE was decreased only in proportion to their reduced body size, suggesting that the lower energy intake reported in elderly people might be mainly related to lower physical activity in free-living conditions.\r"

The evolution in lean body mass (LBM) during the VLCD was estimated from nitrogen balance, measuring urine and fecal losses and taking into account skin, nitrate, and menstrual losses to avoid underestimation bias that could explain the decreased ratio of resting metabolic rate (RMR) to LBM previously reported. RMR was measured at days 0, 3, 5, and 21. The RMR-LBM ratio declined significantly during the VLCD period and decreased faster during the first week; the day 3, day 5, and day 21 ratio values were 94%, 91%, and 82%, respectively, of the original. The RMR-LBM ratio decrease after 21 d of a VLCD was near that found in chronic undernutrition. Results of previous studies that did not find any drop in the RMR-LBM ratio in obese adults on VLCDs might be explained by their LBM-assessment methods.\r"

Control-group 1 was fed a normal diet ad libitum and control-group 2 was pair fed according to the experimental group with the lowest consumption.

Resting oxygen consumption (mL.min-1.kg0.65) was significantly higher in Pyr-fed rats than in pair-fed controls and food-conversion efficiency was significantly decreased. Rats fed Pyr had a lower resting respiratory-exchange ratio than did ad libitum- and pair-fed controls (0.81 +/- 0.01 vs 0.88 +/- 0.01 and 0.87 +/- 0.01, respectively).

Tricyclic antidepressants and opiate antagonists effectively suppress binge eating in normoweight bulimics. This 8-wk placebo-controlled, double-blind trial investigated the effect of naltrexone and imipramine on 33 obese bingers and 22 bulimics. Naltrexone (100-150 mg/d) produced a significant reduction in binge duration in bulimics (36 +/- 16%, median +/- SIQR; P = 0.02) whereas imipramine significantly reduced binge duration in obese bingers (88 +/- 31%; P = 0.02). A strong placebo effect was observed in obese bingers and, although a reduction in binge frequency occurred with both naltrexone and imipramine, it was not significantly different from the effect in placebo control subjects. We conclude that naltrexone and imipramine may be useful agents in the treatment of binge eating.\r"

However, most investigators have found that aspartame consumption is associated with decreased or unchanged ratings of hunger. Even if aspartame consumption increases ratings of hunger in some situations, it apparently has little impact on the controls of food intake and body weight. Aspartame has not been found to increase food intake; indeed, both short-term and long-term studies have shown that consumption of aspartame-sweetened foods or drinks is associated with either no change or a reduction in food intake. Preliminary clinical trials suggest that aspartame may be useful aid in a complete diet-and-exercise program or in weight maintenance. Intense sweeteners have never been found to cause weight gain in humans.\r"

Logistic-regression analyses showed that the probability of menstrual regularity among all study subjects (n = 75) was positively associated with increasing protein/kJ and increasing cholesterol/kJ intakes. The probability of being menstrually regular was negatively associated with increasing dietary fiber/kJ and increasing magnesium/kJ intakes. These results are consistent with the notion that menstrual regularity can be influenced by specific dietary nutrients that may have direct effects or exert their effects by modulating circulating sex steroid status.\r"

Concentrations of high-density-lipoprotein cholesterol did not change significantly. LDL-receptor status in fresh monocytes, affinity of LDL towards the LDL receptor in cultured fibroblasts, zonal-centrifugation profiles, and lipoprotein composition were not significantly different between the diets. There was a significantly higher tendency toward lipid peroxidation on the PUFA diet, as ascertained by more thiobarbituric acid-reactive-substances formation on that diet. Dietary PUFA results in somewhat lower TC and LDL-C concentrations whereas with MUFA the susceptibility of LDL to oxidative stress is lower.\r"

Thirty human subjects kept diet records for 10 d and then underwent preference testing with fat-containing stimuli: 10 different foods, each prepared with 2-5 levels of fat. The mean preferred level of fat across all foods was used as an indicator of overall fat preference. Analyses indicate 1) wide individual variation in the most preferred fat level for each stimulus, with no consistent correlation among the various stimuli; 2) no consistent relationships among sensory and dietary measures; and 3) a positive correlation between overall fat preference and percent body fat (r = 0.46, P less than 0.01). Although a battery of test stimuli may be used to identify individual and group sensory preferences for fats, relationships between sensory and dietary measures remain unclear.\r"

However, urea clearance is not a precise measure of glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and these studies did not indicate the mechanism for the reduced GFR. To measure renal function more precisely and to assess whether B-6 deficiency augments renal injury, we examined [14C]inulin clearance, urine oxalate excretion, and renal histopathology in rats with CRF pair fed to receive a pyridoxine-replete or -deficient diet for 3 or 6 wk. After 3 or 6 wk, pyridoxine-deficient rats had significantly lower [14C]inulin clearances and increased urine oxalate excretion. Histological evaluation indicated increased renal damage in kidneys from pyridoxine-deficient rats as compared with tissue from pyridoxine-replete rats. These findings suggest that in rats with CRF, vitamin B-6 deficiency reduces the GFR and increases renal scarring.\r"

Analysis of variance indicated that presence of lactose in the diets increased calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, and zinc concentrations in the vertebrae (P less than 0.02) and also increased magnesium (P less than 0.01) and zinc (P less than 0.05) in femur and tibia-fibula. In contrast, the source of protein had an effect only on bone magnesium concentration, with the soy protein resulting in lower magnesium retention in all bones studied (P less than 0.05). These data suggest that differences in lactose content rather than in the source of protein may be mainly responsible for the differential effects of milk-based and soy-based infant formulas on bone minerals.\r"

In the colon the SCT group had significantly increased segment and mucosal weights and mucosal protein and DNA compared with both the MCT and CD groups. Body-weight change and measurements of serum ketones, albumin, glucose, and triglycerides revealed no significant differences among groups.

Recently, advances in molecular genetics have made it possible to acquire cytogenetic information through the study of interphase and terminally differentiated cells. By using chromosome-specific DNA probes or probes that are specific for certain chromosomal regions, and by employing techniques of in situ hybridization along with nonradioactive detection methods, it is now possible to detect numerical and structural chromosomal abnormalities from nonmetaphase cells. When used as an adjunct to conventional cytogenetic analysis or when used together with knowledge of established cytogenetic findings for a particular malignancy, this new technology can serve to broaden the scope and utility of cytogenetic analysis beyond the limits of the present metaphase-based technology. Interphase cytogenetic analysis has application to the diagnosis and study of neoplastic disorders and, thus, has particular importance in pathology.\r"

  ".W": "The use of nuclear grade as a prognostic indicator for breast carcinoma has been limited by interobserver variability. Advances in image analysis and automated cell classification offer one approach to this problem. The authors used the CAS-100 (Cell Analysis System. Elmhurst, IL) system to measure and analyze nuclear morphometric and texture features of cytologic preparations from 35 breast carcinomas (well, moderate, and poorly differentiated) as well as benign lesions. Morphometric and Markovian texture feature data from breast cancer nuclei of various grades comprised a training set, which was then used to establish classification criteria by multivariate (Bayesian) analysis and to train a neural network system. Both systems were tested for the ability to classify the nuclear grade of individual nuclei. There was good agreement between computer classification and the grade assigned by human observer to individual nuclei using either Bayesian or neural network analysis. Thirty-one unknown cases, which were assigned an overall grade by an observer, were then analyzed by computer, and an overall grade assigned based on the grade of nucleus most frequently present. Using this method, both classification systems were able to assign a \"correct\" grade to low-grade lesions (approximately 70% correct) more often than to high-grade tumors (approximately 20%). Difficulty in computer assignment of high-grade tumors was explained by nuclear heterogeneity in these tumors (i.e., although the percentage of high-grade nuclei was increased compared with that of low-grade tumors, high-grade nuclei frequently did not predominate). The authors present this study to demonstrate the feasibility of using image analysis as an objective means of nuclear grading. Further studies will be needed to establish criteria for assigning overall nuclear grade based on computer analysis of imaging data.\r"

In this rotation, emphasis is placed on the pathologist's role as a laboratory director and decision maker and in the necessary computer skills and managerial background that must be acquired to make this role most effective. Specific behavioral goals and objectives were formulated for this rotation. The goals served as a guideline for the resident while involving each resident in the decision making process and in problem solving in day-to-day laboratory activities. The resident was encouraged to become familiar with the laboratory computer system, its operation, access, and reporting. Computer fundamentals were taught in instances where there was little or no prior computer experience. Management activities in which the resident was involved dealt with affirmative action, position searches, hiring and firing, laboratory accreditation, licensure laws, and decision making. This paper describes the rotation in detail and discusses each objective while incorporating both the resident's and laboratory director's perspectives.\r"

These vascular proliferations represent a unique example of tissue reactivity recalling the vascular proliferations of patients with AIDS. In addition, the authors review the life and times of Daniel Alcides Carrion, a Peruvian medical student who in 1885 by self-experimentation linked both phases of the disease and died in doing so. Carrion's life, and the impact of his experiment on the subsequent study of Bartonellosis by Peruvian and international scholars, epitomize the constant struggle of the Peruvian medical profession (past and present) to upgrade domestic biomedical research and to find a national identity.\r"

Molecular probes are now available for the rapid diagnosis of diseases caused by a large number of viruses, bacteria, fungi, spirochetes, rickettsia, and other infectious agents. Since nucleic acid probes can distinguish minute differences indicative of genetic mutations or alternations, specific probes also can be developed even for those diseases with unknown causative agents or etiologies. Further, using these techniques, specific drug-resistant and pathogenic strains associated with epidemics in widely separated areas of a country or a town have been identified. Thus, the sensitivity and specificity of molecular detection methods using both radioactive and nonradioactive probes are at a point that clinical specimens can be tested for rapid diagnosis and identification of etiologic agent(s) that may be responsible for the pathogenesis of a wide variety of diseases.\r"

An analysis of liver samples from 59 PH1 patients showed considerable heterogeneity at the enzymic level. Approximately two thirds of patients had zero AGT catalytic activity, whereas the remaining one third had activities that ranged from 3% to 48% of the mean normal level. Two thirds of patients with zero AGT activity also had zero immunoreactive AGT protein, while the other one third, together with all the patients with detectable AGT catalytic activity, had levels of immunoreactive AGT protein that varied from normal to only a few percent of normal. All patients with AGT catalytic activity had their enzyme in the wrong intracellular compartment (ie, mitochondria). On the other hand, in all but one of the patients with immunoreactive AGT protein, but zero catalytic activity, the inactive AGT was correctly located within the peroxisomes. This enzymic heterogeneity was matched by considerable heterogeneity at the clinical level (eg, age at onset, rate of progression, age at renal failure, etc). No simple relationship was found between the level of hepatic AGT and the severity of the disease. It is suggested that a lack of AGT might be responsible for a broader pathological phenotype than classically associated with PH1. The possibility is advanced that some patients with idiopathic oxalate stone disease might owe their predisposition to stone formation to a functional deficiency of AGT.\r"

In control animals, both cortical and papillary cells exhibited a time-dependent accumulation of oxalate. This uptake was mediated both by passive diffusion and by one or more transport processes sensitive to the anion transport inhibitor, DIDS. Oxalate uptake was also markedly sensitive to extracellular pH, showing increased uptake at acidic pH outside (pHo) (6.0), and reduced uptake at alkaline pHo (8.0). In renal tubular cells from stone-forming animals, oxalate uptake was markedly altered. Uptake was significantly reduced in cortical cells, whereas it was significantly stimulated in papillary cells from the same animals. Since the observed changes in oxalate handling occurred only in stone-forming animals, it is possible that alterations in renal cell oxalate transport contribute to calcium oxalate stone formation.\r"

We present here the cloning of the oxalyl-CoA decarboxylase gene from the bacterium Oxalobacter formigenes and its subsequent expression in a foreign environment. These results provide the basis for eventual transfer of an oxalate decarboxylase gene into mammalian cells.\r"

  ".W": "Hypercalciuria, defined as the urinary excretion of more than 0.1 mmol Ca/kg/d (4 mg/kg/24 h), is observed in approximately 50% of patients with calcium oxalate/apatite nephrolithiasis and is one of the risk factors for stone formation. Urinary Ca excretion rates among such patients are higher than normal, despite comparable ranges of glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and serum ultrafiltrable Ca concentrations, and thus glomerular filtration of Ca, suggesting that hypercalciuria is the result of inhibition of net tubular Ca reabsorption. Although increased dietary NaCl or protein intake and reduced K intake increase urinary Ca excretion rates, urinary Ca excretion rates are higher among hypercalciuric stone formers than among normal subjects in relation to comparable ranges of urinary Na, SO4 (as a reflection of protein intake), or K excretion rates, indicating that these dietary factors are not primarily responsible for hypercalciuria. Hypophosphatemia is observed among a subset of hypercalciuric patients and consequent activation of 1,25-(OH)2-D synthesis increases intestinal Ca absorption and urinary calcium excretion. Other hypercalciuric patients exhibit augmented intestinal Ca absorption without elevated plasma 1,25-(OH)-2-D levels, suggesting that either the capacity of 1,25-(OH)2-D to upregulate its own receptor in the intestine or 1,25-(OH)2-D-independent intestinal Ca transport are responsible for increased Ca absorption and hypercalciuria. Hypercalciuric patients also exhibit accelerated radiocalcium turnover, negative Ca balances, reduced bone density, delayed bone mineralization, fasting hypercalciuria, and increased hydroxyproline excretion, all of which reflect participation of the skeleton and presumably a more generalized acceleration of Ca transport. Hypercalciuria may be familial.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Recent experimental studies have indicated that while small urinary ions such as citrate, magnesium, and phosphocitrate retard the mineralization rate of CaOx, urinary macromolecules may act either as inhibitors of growth or promoters of nucleation. Some CaOx mineralization inhibitors have also been found to influence the growth mechanism of the phase and its flocculation properties. Therefore, urinary macromolecules that are adsorbed on the mineralizing crystals and incorporated into the developing stone may play a significant role in urolithiasis.\r"

Studies in the literature as early as 1937 have highlighted that the initiation of renal calculi followed the formation of subepithelial calcified plaques in the renal pelvis. The renal papilla is one of the primary sites for crystal fixation and stone maturation. We have developed an in vitro model system for the study of kidney stone crystal retention to tubular epithelium using rat renal papillary collecting tubule (RPCT) cells in primary culture. We have qualitatively and quantitatively analyzed the binding of preformed calcium oxalate monohydrate (COM), hydroxyapatite (HA), and uric acid (UA) crystals to RPCT cells. Our goal was to determine if three common urinary stone crystals evidenced different crystal-cell binding characteristics. Also, since these crystals are frequently observed admixed in stones, we have studied the inhibitive binding characteristics of these crystals with RPCT cells. The RPCT cells in culture grow both as the typical polygonal cells in monolayer and as clumps of aggregated cells. The cells in the aggregates are viable epithelial cells that have lost their attachment to the basement membrane, resulting in the exposure of surface molecules that would not normally be present unless the cells were damaged or if there was a loss of intercellular tight junctions. COM, HA, and UA crystals all preferentially bound to the aggregated cells and all exhibited similar saturable binding patterns.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Little is known about the mechanism of their excretion, but there is no doubt that urinary GAGs are degradation products of high molecular weight proteoglycans. Renal excretion takes place chiefly as glomerular filtration, and tubular reabsorption or secretion has not been demonstrated. Differences in the literature comparing GAG excretion in urolithiasis patients and healthy subjects are mainly attributable to methods of analysis and noncomparability of the investigation conditions. We found no differences between the two groups in several series. It is interesting to note that GAG excretion in men is significantly higher than in women, that a circadian rhythm of GAG concentration and excretion occurs in healthy subjects on a standardized diet, and that values are raised postprandially and at night. Seasonal course of GAG excretion curves is almost synchronous for men and women, irrespective of the absolute values, and GAG excretion in the spring and summer significantly exceeds that in winter months by up to 50%. All crystallization models cited demonstrate that GAG reduce the risk of calcium oxalate stone formation. Inhibitors of crystal growth and aggregation act by blocking the growth sites. Inhibition of calcium oxalate crystallization is also attributed to direct binding of calcium to GAG. In the presence of urate ions, and favorable pH, the ability of chondroitin sulfate C to bind calcium may be impaired by as much as 31%. These measurements support the concept that urate ions interact with GAG in urine.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Analysis of the relevant literature shows that speculation is based on the clinical impression that CaOx stone-formers appear to excrete more urate than do normal subjects, and that allopurinol reduces the rate of CaOx stone recurrences. On balance, this is sufficient to suggest that a high urinary excretion of urate promotes CaOx stone formation. However, in the past, evidence to disclose the mechanism by which urate could exert this effect has been largely shrouded in confusion and controversy. The evidence for two theories that have dominated thinking in this area are reviewed and new findings are reported that indicate that neither can account for the purported effect of urate. It is concluded that dissolved urate in urine, at normal physiological pH values, directly provokes CaOx crystal nucleation by the phenomenon of salting-out. The possibility that urate promotes CaOx stone formation is further strengthened by its ability to increase significantly the amount of CaOx precipitated from solution and to cause the aggregation of individual crystals into large clusters. Future avenues of investigation that should assist in the formulation of diagnostic and therapeutic guidelines are presented.\r"

It is only through additional study of the basic physics of high-energy shock waves that we will be able to further enhance the clinical benefits of extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy. Further understanding of the individual characteristics of a shock wave pressure field such as peak positive pressure, peak negative pressure, pulse duration, and size/shape of the focal region will allow the subsequent enhancement of stone fragmentation while minimizing the potential for shock wave injury to surrounding tissues.\r"

The major problem in comparing and contrasting these studies has been the wide range of mechanical, biological, and analytical variables facing the investigator. However, if one takes the time to select out only those studies in which a wide range of experimental variables have been defined or controlled, then it becomes possible to begin to understand the effects of HESW on cells in vitro. With this in mind, the literature has been thoroughly reviewed. It would appear that HESW do cause cellular damage regardless of the cell's doubling time. The cell damage is likely due to the impact of cavitation and the attendant shear forces and jets that are produced by the shock waves as it passes through the cell suspension. The damage occurs both at the cell membrane and within the cell itself. With regard to the latter, it would appear that the mitochondria are most sensitive to HESW; however, damage also occurs within the nucleus and along the endoplasmic reticulum and in other cell organelles (eg, lyosomes). Applications of HESW to other clinical situations are currently being studied. One example of interest is the in vitro combination of chemotherapeutic agents and HESW to enhance the effect of a specific chemotherapeutic regimen on a given tumor cell line. Several investigators have noted a beneficial effect of this combination therapy in vitro; however, similar favorable results have not been obtained when the same or similar tumor system was studied in vivo.\r"

SWL-induced acute renal damage may result in severe injury to the nephron, microvasculature, and the surrounding interstitium. In addition, at least three chronic adverse effects have been identified when shock waves are administered at a therapeutic dose. These include (1) an accelerated rise in arterial blood pressure, (2) a decrease in renal function, and (3) an increased rate of stone recurrence. The clinical and experimental data that document tissue injury as a result of shock wave treatment are compelling, but have not allowed us to determine the factors responsible for the adverse acute side effects or to identify conditions that may predispose a patient to serious long-term health problems. Thus, there is an urgent need for incisive, fundamental experimental studies to establish the safe limits for shock wave delivery. To accomplish this goal, animal experimentation is required so that the time course and severity of acute and chronic alterations can be followed in a model that closely mimics human renal structure and functions. The minipig provides this model.\r"

Positive values of IgA antibodies against dietary Ag had variable prevalences, but again Italian patients showed the highest frequency, from 19% to 28.5% versus 0 to 38% in Australians and 0 to 16% in Japanese. Mean values of these antibodies were not significantly increased in any patient groups in comparison to the corresponding healthy populations. However, patients with elevated values of IgAIC had significantly higher serum concentrations of antibodies to alimentary components and a linear correlation was found between IgAIC and some IgA antibodies to food components. The relationship between these two series of data was particularly evident for Italian and Australian IgAGN patients. Moreover, the patients with positive data tended to have a cluster of increased levels of IgA antibodies against several alimentary Ag at the same time.

None of these correlations was evident among healthy controls.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The conventional open surgical technique involves deltoid detachment and reattachment, which may cause postoperative weakness and requires protection during the postoperative period to allow for healing. Arthroscopic acromioclavicular joint resection has the theoretical advantages of no deltoid disruption and a shorter rehabilitation period. The purpose of this study was to compare open versus arthroscopic acromioclavicular joint resection in a laboratory setting. The goals of acromioclavicular joint resection in this study were to remove 5 mm of the medial acromion and 10 mm of the distal clavicle. Acromioclavicular joint resections were performed on 10 cadaver shoulders (5 open resections and 5 arthroscopic resections). Open resection was successful at 10 of 15 distal clavicle locations and 14 of 15 medial acromial locations. Arthroscopic resection was successful at 14 of 15 distal clavicle locations and 10 of 15 medial acromial locations. The combined bone resection averaged 14.8 mm (+/- 1.99 mm) for the open technique and 14.8 mm (+/- 2.58 mm) for the arthroscopic technique. The combined bone resection was 1.5 cm or more in all of the measured locations for the open technique and in 14 of 15 measure locations for the arthroscopic technique. There was no statistically significant difference between the two groups. In the laboratory setting, acromioclavicular joint resection was performed effectively and predictably with arthroscopic instruments. Arthroscopic bone resection was comparable to open bone resection.\r"

  ".W": "The static restraints of the scapulohumeral joint provide stability for the humeral head in the glenoid cavity, limit extremes of motion of the glenohumeral joint, and guide positioning of the humerus during normal shoulder movement. Eleven fresh-frozen cadaver shoulders of unknown age were attached to a shoulder motion device that allowed measurement of motion in three planes with an accuracy to 0.5 degrees. Four shoulders underwent motion analysis and seven were used for strain gauge analysis of the static scapulohumeral ligamentous restraints. The results of the motion analysis demonstrated that any attempt at simple motion (flexion, extension, abduction, internal or external rotation) resulted in coupled motion in two additional planes. The strain gauge data, expressed as a percent of total tension for each ligament tested, demonstrated a reciprocal tension-sharing relationship among all ligament components and a transference of tension among these components when original and new joint positions were compared. These data provide an in vitro model of shoulder restraint function to explain primary restraint, tension sharing, and transference of tension functions in the in vivo scapulohumeral joint. Clinical relevance: These principles of shoulder function have application in the treatment of instability and frozen shoulder syndrome, and provide an in vitro model to better understand static restraint function in the throwing mechanism.\r"

A detailed subjective evaluation using the Lysholm scale was recorded as well as a functional evaluation using the Tegner activity scale. All of the patients received a detailed physical examination that included testing with the KT-1000 ligament arthrometer and the Cybex dynamometer. Complete chart reviews and radiographic evaluations were also obtained. Only 17 patients were considered to be functionally successful and performing at their desired activity level. The average KT-1000 showed a side-to-side difference of 5.9 mm at 30 pounds for the successful group and 7.9 mm for those who had functional failure. The Lysholm scores were 91.6/100 versus 61.1/100 in the failures. Eight patients (22%) at repeat surgery were noted to have complete dissolution of the graft. Large femoral cysts were noted radiographically in all of these patients. It was concluded that freeze-dried, ethylene oxide-sterilized, bone-patellar tendon-bone allografts have a high failure rate and cannot be recommended for ACL reconstruction.\r"

Twenty-one ACL deficient knees (14 chronic, 7 acute) were reconstructed. Instability developed in five knees within the first 6 months of graft implantation (24%). Magnetic resonance examinations were performed at 1, 6, 12, 24, 36, and greater than 48 weeks postoperatively (repetition time 1500, echo delay time = 50). A total of 104 scans were reviewed (average, five per knee). The ACL graft was divided into four unequal size zones for analysis. The proximal, middle, and distal thirds of the intraarticular portion of the graft and the portion of the graft within the tibial tunnel were independently analyzed. The magnetic resonance signal in each portion of the graft was graded on a scale with (I) being a normal signal, (II) greater than 50% of the total volume of the graft having a normal signal, (III) less than 50% of the graft having a normal signal, and (IV) 100% of the graft having an increased signal. The increased magnetic resonance signal of the ACL graft was observed to be regionalized and confined to the distal two-thirds of the intraarticular portion of the graft. The portion of the graft exiting the femoral tunnel and within the tibial tunnel retained a normal magnetic resonance signal. The increases in magnetic resonance graft signal were time-dependent, became well established by 3 months, and remained unchanged at 1 year. The clinical outcome could not be predicted based on the magnetic resonance signal of the graft.\r"

  ".W": "Injuries to the cervical spine at the C3-C4 level involving the bony elements, intervertebral disks, and ligamentous structures are rare. We present 25 cases of traumatic C3-C4 injuries sustained by young athletes and documented by the National Football Head and Neck Injury Registry. Review of the cases reveals that the response of energy inputs at the C3-C4 level differ from those involving the upper (C1-C2) and lower (C4-C5-C6-C7) cervical segments. Specifically, the C3-C4 lesions appear to be unique with regard to the infrequency of bony fracture, difficulty in effecting and maintaining reduction, and a more favorable recovery following early, aggressive treatment. In the majority of instances, injury at this level results from axial loading of the cervical spine. Lesions were distributed into specific categories: 1) acute intervertebral disc herniation (N = 4), 2) anterior subluxation of C3 on C4 (N = 4), 3) unilateral facet dislocation (N = 6), 4) bilateral facet dislocation (N = 7), and 5) fracture of vertebral body C4 (N = 4). Analysis of these 25 cases suggests that traumatic lesions of the cervical spine in general can be classified as involving the upper (C1-C2), middle (C3-C4), or lower (C4-C7) segments. This is based on our observations from this series that C3-C4 lesions 1) generally do not involve fracture of the bony elements; 2) acute intervertebral disc herniations are frequently associated with transient quadriplegia; 3) reduction of anterior subluxation of C3 on C4 is difficult to maintain; 4) reduction of unilateral facet dislocation is difficult to obtain by skeletal traction and is best managed by closed manipulation and reduction under general anesthesia; and 5) reduction of bilateral facet dislocation is difficult to obtain by skeletal traction and is best managed by open methods. The more favorable results observed in this series of immediate reduction of both unilateral and bilateral facet dislocations deserves emphasis. In two cases of unilateral facet dislocation reduced within 3 hours of injury and subsequently fused anteriorly, significant neurologic recovery occurred. The other four patients, two who underwent an open reduction and laminectomy and two treated closed with skeletal traction, remained quadriplegic. In the four instances of bilateral facet dislocation where reduction was achieved by either closed or open methods, although there was no neurologic recovery, all four patients survived their injuries. However, the three patients who were not successfully reduced died.\r"

The disease entity is a good example of an overloaded process of the plantar fascia at its calcaneal insertion. This study was designed to examine the strength and flexibility findings in the muscles that are put on tensile load during running, and which are responsible for controlling the forces on the foot during stance and pushoff, thus modifying the overload. Three groups of athletes underwent physical examination, including checking ankle range of motion in plantar flexion and dorsiflexion. Cybex peak torque measurements were taken at 60 and 180 deg/sec. The groups were a control group of 45 athletes with no symptoms, a group that included 43 affected feet with symptomatic plantar fasciitis, and a group that included the 43 unaffected contralateral feet. Analysis of data showed dynamic range of motion deficits in 38 of 43 affected feet, static range of motion deficits in 37 of 43 affected feet, deficits in peak torque at 60 deg/sec in 41 of 43 affected feet, and deficits in peak torque at 180 deg/sec in 37 of 43 affected feet. Statistical comparison of range of motion showed that the group with symptomatic plantar fasciitis was significantly restricted compared to both control and unaffected contralateral feet groups. Statistical comparison of peak torque showed that the symptomatic plantar fasciitis group was significantly lower than both other groups at both velocities. This study documents strength and flexibility deficits in the supporting musculature of the posterior calf and foot that are affected by plantar fasciitis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

This study used the Cybex II to evaluate the isokinetic strength of the rotator cuff in elite water polo players and in a group of control subjects. The water polo players were significantly stronger than the controls. Of greater importance was the confirmation of imbalances in the rotator cuff force couples of adduction/abduction and external/internal rotation. These changes are similar to those reported for pitchers. The adductors in the water polo group had gained in relative strength resulting in an increase in the adduction/abduction ratio to about 2:1. The internal rotators had gained in relative strength resulting in a decrease in the external/internal ratio to about 0.6:1. For both force couples the differences are more apparent at a slow speed. Side-to-side differences were not significant.\r"

Strength was measured as the maximal isokinetic torque of the right and left knee flexors and knee extensors at 30 and 180 deg/sec. Flexibility was measured as the active range of motion of several lower body joints. An athletic trainer evaluated and recorded injuries occurring to the athletes in practice or competition. Forty percent of the women suffered one or more injuries. Athletes experienced more lower extremity injuries if they had: 1) a right knee flexor 15% stronger than the left knee flexor at 180 deg/sec; 2) a right hip extensor 15% more flexible than the left hip extensor; 3) a knee flexor/knee extensor ratio of less than 0.75 at 180 deg/sec. There was a trend for higher injury rates to be associated with knee flexor or hip extensor imbalances of 15% or more on either side of the body. These data demonstrate that specific strength and flexibility imbalances are associated with lower extremity injuries in female collegiate athletes.\r"

Fifty-seven percent of the surveyed schools returned properly completed forms. Sixty-one percent of the schools responding reported having a physician available for at least one team at some time during the year. This was almost universally the football team; with 59% of the schools with varsity football reporting a physician present at either a practice or a contest at least once during the year. Only 13% of the schools reported having a physician available for a team other than varsity football. Seventy-four percent of all varsity teams had neither a physician nor an athletic trainer present at any time during the year. Comparison of the results of this study with similar studies performed in Michigan in 1975 and 1979, as well as studies in other states, demonstrates that despite the increased awareness and popularity of sports medicine, there has been no appreciable change in the amount of access interscholastic athletes have to physician care.\r"

Duration of spasticity relief and adverse effects were recorded. Both drugs equally reduced spasticity and increased the range of motion. There were no supraspinal side effects from the fentanyl, whereas three subjects became hypotensive after receiving lidocaine. The reduction of spasticity with intrathecal fentanyl lasted at least 3 h. The authors postulate that fentanyl reduced spasticity by an effect on spinal pathways. Intrathecal fentanyl should be considered as an alternative to lidocaine for diagnostic blocks in patients with spasticity.\r"

The authors assessed the accuracy of FIN mean arterial pressure (MAP) measurements relative to simultaneous direct radial arterial pressures in 20 patients undergoing general anesthesia for major elective surgery. Data were collected digitally with the use of RS-232 communications over a total of 16.2 h. The data were processed into 6012 interference-free time samples, each spanning 6 s. The authors determined the difference between FIN and direct MAPs during each time sample. The authors calculated not only the bias of FIN measurements, but also the frequency, magnitude, and duration of discrepancies between simultaneous FIN and direct MAPs. The overall bias of the FIN MAP was -0.5 +/- 1.0 mmHg, which was not significantly different from zero. However, 32.3 +/- 6.2% of all MAP comparisons differed by greater than +/- 10 mmHg, and 5.0 +/- 1.1% differed by greater than +/- 20 mmHg. Moreover, there was an average of one episode every 2 patient-hours when the FIN MAP differed by greater than +/- 20 mmHg for more than 1 min. Although the MAP measured by FIN accurately reflected direct MAPs most of the time, there were occasional discrepancies of different magnitude such that clinical usefulness may be limited in patients in whom continuous accurate blood pressure measurements are essential.\r"

  ".W": "The authors compared the incidence of respiratory complications and arterial hemoglobin desaturation during emergence from anesthesia in children whose tracheas were extubated while they were anesthetized or after they were awake and to whom halothane or isoflurane had been administered. One hundred children 1-4 yr of age undergoing minor urologic surgery were studied. After a standard induction technique, patients were randomized to receive either isoflurane or halothane. In 50 patients tracheal extubation was performed while they were breathing 2 MAC of either halothane or isoflurane in 100% oxygen. The remaining 50 patients received 2 MAC (volatile agent plus nitrous oxide) during the operation, but tracheal extubation was delayed until they were awake. A blinded observer recorded the incidence of respiratory complications and continuously measured hemoglobin saturation for 15 min after extubation. When tracheal extubation occurred in deeply anesthetized patients, no differences were found between the two volatile agents. When tracheal extubation of awake patients was performed, the use of isoflurane was associated with more episodes of coughing and airway obstruction than was halothane (P less than 0.05). Awake tracheal extubation following either agent was associated with significantly more episodes of hemoglobin desaturation than was tracheal extubation while anesthetized.\r"

Each child was randomly assigned to receive a bolus dose of one of the following muscle relaxants: succinylcholine 2.0 mg/kg (n = 10), vecuronium 0.1 mg/kg (n = 10), vecuronium 0.2 mg/kg (n = 10), or vecuronium 0.4 mg/kg (n = 10). The evoked electromyogram of the abductor digiti minimi to train-of-four stimulation was monitored. We found that with succinylcholine, the time to 95% twitch depression (speed of onset, mean +/- SD), 24 +/- 7 s, was significantly less than that with each dose of vecuronium: 0.1 mg/kg, 83 +/- 21 s; 0.2 mg/kg, 58 +/- 17 s; and 0.4 mg/kg, 39 +/- 11 s, respectively (P less than 0.05). The time to laryngoscopy and intubation did not differ significantly between succinylcholine (48 +/- 10 s) and vecuronium 0.4 mg/kg (57 +/- 13 s); however, both were significantly less than than with vecuronium 0.1 and 0.2 mg/kg (P less than 0.005). The intubating conditions were excellent in 100% of patients. The duration of action was least with succinylcholine (5.7 +/- 1.5 min) and increased with increasing doses of vecuronium: 0.1 mg/kg, 23.9 +/- 5.1 min; 0.2 mg/kg, 55.2 +/- 11.6 min; and 0.4 mg/kg, 74.6 +/- 9.9 min, respectively (P less than 0.001).

The CTRL group was treated in an identical fashion except that, after placement of the introducer needle, actual dural puncture was omitted. After inhalational induction with halothane as the sole anesthetic agent, the patients' responses to surgical incision were recorded. MAC was determined with the modified up-down method of Dixon and verified with probit analysis. MAC (+/- SE) after ITMS was 0.76 +/- 0.06, compared with a CTRL MAC of 0.78 +/- 0.15 (not significant).

Cardiac output was measured simultaneously with both methods in 17 adult patients. For 86 pairs of measurements, the average difference between the two techniques was -0.21.min-1. This bias had a standard deviation of 1.71.min-1. The average of the absolute value of the difference between measurements made with the two techniques was 1.31.min-1, with a standard deviation of 1.11.min-1. The limits of agreement were -3.6 to 3.11.min-1. Linear regression yielded the following equation: DOP = 0.62 TD + 1.54 l.min-1 (r = 0.63). To evaluate the ability of transtracheal DOP to trend changes in cardiac output, the changes in cardiac output at sequential time points were compared for the two techniques. The average difference in the changes in cardiac output measured by the two techniques was 0.01.min-1. This bias had a standard deviation of 1.71.min-1. In conclusion, the transtracheal DOP technique did not reproduce the measurement of cardiac output by TD intraoperatively. Transtracheal DOP did not accurately trend changes in the TD measurement. These findings were obtained from patients with cardiovascular disease, and the conclusions may depend in part on the patient population and the investigators' experience with the transtracheal DOP technique.\r"

In phase 1, 41 children weighing 12 +/- 3 kg (range 7-20 kg) and 31 +/- 16 months (range 8-67 months) of age (mean +/- SD) received midazolam, 0.4-5.0 mg.kg-1, in an attempt to produce unconsciousness. Only one child lost consciousness (4.5 mg.kg-1). However, at all doses, inhalational induction of anesthesia was facilitated because children were tranquil and calmly separated from their parent(s). There were no clinically significant changes in arterial blood pressure, heart rate, oxyhemoglobin saturation, and end-tidal carbon dioxide concentration, 10 min after drug administration. In phase 2, 26 children weighing 17 +/- 4 kg (range 10-26 kg) and 44 +/- 19 months (range 17-84 months) months of age undergoing tonsil and/or adenoid surgery were studied to determine the optimal sedative dose of rectally administered midazolam. Patients received 0.3, 1.0, 2.0, or 3.0 mg.kg-1 of midazolam in a randomized, double-blind fashion. One third (3 of 9) of patients receiving 0.3 mg.kg-1 struggled during mask induction. All patients receiving greater than or equal to 1.0 mg.kg-1 were adequately sedated (P less than 0.008).

The effects of preanesthetic medication with intramuscular midazolam were examined in 100 elderly patients, aged 60-86 yr, given 1, 2, or 3 mg midazolam or placebo using a randomized, double-blind study design. Level of sedation and anxiety were assessed every 15 min for 1 h. Picture cards were presented at the same times in order to assess recall of these cards 24 h later. All three doses of midazolam produced rapid onset of sedation, anxiolysis, and anterograde amnesia. These effects decreased in intensity by 60 min after drug injection. The intensity and extent of these effects were comparable with those reported with higher doses in younger patients, although with the 1-mg midazolam dose the effects were shorter-lived, and a difference from placebo was not consistently seen. Three patients (3%), all older than 70 yr, became unresponsive to vocal and tactile stimuli. This level of drowsiness was unrelated to body weight, age, or ASA physical status. We conclude that in adults between 60-69 yr old, midazolam 2 or 3 mg intramuscularly can be effective as preanesthetic medication without causing excessive drowsiness. However, intramuscular midazolam should be used cautiously, under continuous observation, in patients aged 70 yr and older because excessive drowsiness may occur.\r"

  ".W": "Five healthy, nonpregnant volunteers were studied before and after induction of lumbar epidural anesthesia to determine the cause of central hypothermia during epidural anesthesia. Cutaneous heat loss was measured from 10 area-weighted sites using thermal flux transducers. Oxygen consumption was measured and converted to heat production in watts (W). After a 2-h control period at approximately 20 degrees C, epidural anesthesia was induced by injection of 30-50 ml 3% chloroprocaine. Additional boluses were given to extend the sensory blockade to at least the T5 dermatome. Tremor during epidural anesthesia was compared with normal shivering induced by rapid central venous infusion of approximately 4 l iced saline in six unanesthetized volunteers. Average skin temperature and cutaneous heat loss decreased during the control period, while tympanic membrane temperature remained stable. During the 1st h of epidural blockade, tympanic membrane temperature decreased 1.1 +/- 0.3 degrees C, and average skin temperature increased 0.9 +/- 0.5 degrees C. Cutaneous heat loss increased 16 +/- 6% (15 +/- 5 W), but metabolic heat production increased even more (and was associated with a shivering-like tremor). Tremor during epidural anesthesia and shivering induced by iced saline infusion had similar synchronous waxing-and-waning patterns. No abnormal EMG patterns were detected during epidural anesthesia. We conclude that central hypothermia during the 1st h of epidural anesthesia does not result from heat loss to the environment in excess of metabolic heat production, but results primarily from redistribution of body heat from central to peripheral tissues. Analysis of the tremor patterns suggests that oscillations recorded during epidural anesthesia in nonpregnant individuals is normal thermoregulatory shivering. Shivering occurred sooner and was more intense during iced saline infusion than during epidural anesthesia, despite comparable central hypothermia. The low intensity of shivering during epidural anesthesia, and in some individuals the delay in onset, may result from blockade of afferent cutaneous cold signals.\r"

To determine if systemic alpha-adrenergic blockade with phentolamine can be used to diagnose SMP, we compared the effects on pain of local anesthetic sympathetic ganglion blocks (LASB) and phentolamine blocks (PhB) in 20 patients with chronic pain and hyperalgesia that were suspected to be sympathetically maintained. The blocks were done in random order on separate days. Patients rated the intensity of ongoing and stimulus-evoked pain every 5 min before, during, and after the LASB and PhB. Patients and the investigator assessing pain levels were blinded to the time of intravenous administration of phentolamine (total dose 25-35 mg). The pain relief achieved by LASB and PhB correlated closely (r = 0.84), and there was no significant difference in the maximum pain relief achieved with the two blocks (t = 0.19, P greater than 0.8). Nine patients experienced a greater than 50% relief of pain and hyperalgesia from both LASB and PhB and were considered to have a clinically significant component of SMP. We conclude that alpha-adrenergic blockade with intravenous phentolamine is a sensitive alternative test to identify patients with SMP.\r"

These complications may be related to systemic or local hemodynamic alterations. This study was designed to evaluate the influence of inhalational anesthetic agents on the intestinal circulation supplying these ileocolic grafts. Seven patients (age 30 +/- 5 yr, mean +/- standard deviation [SD]) were studied in the immediate postlaparotomy period. Miniaturized Doppler implantable microprobes were sutured to the single artery supplying the graft and connected to an 8-MHz pulsed Doppler flowmeter. Continuous fentanyl infusion (300 micrograms.h-1) was maintained throughout the study. Measurements were performed at the end of four 30-min periods, which were, successively: first control; isoflurane or halothane anesthesia; second control; and isoflurane or halothane anesthesia. Isoflurane and halothane were administered in cross sequence with end-tidal concentration of 0.8% and 0.5%, respectively, to induce equipotent anesthesia. Both anesthetics induced similar decreases in mean systemic arterial pressure (MAP), cardiac output (CO), and systemic vascular resistance. During isoflurane, mean mesenteric blood flow (MBFm) supplying the graft was increased (+38%; P less than 0.05), and the mesenteric vascular resistance index (MVRI; -44%; P less than 0.05) was decreased, leading to an increase in the MBFm/CO ratio (P less than 0.05). Halothane changed neither the MBFm nor the MBFm/CO ratio, despite a mild decrease in MVRI (-14%; P less than 0.05). Diastolic blood flow velocity increased significantly (2.3 +/- 0.9 vs. 0.8 +/- 0.3 cm.s-1, P less than 0.05) only with isoflurane, suggesting a local vasodilation not observed with halothane.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The patients were studied while they were either awake (n = 40) or anesthetized with enflurane and nitrous oxide in oxygen (n = 40). Hemodynamic measurements were made at 1-min intervals for 10 min after ephedrine 0.1 mg.kg-1 was injected as a bolus. Although the responses to ephedrine were always greater in anesthetized patients, the magnitudes of mean blood pressure increases in patients who received clonidine (10 +/- 8% for awake and 27 +/- 11% for anesthetized subjects, mean +/- standard deviation [SD]) were significantly greater (P less than 0.05) than in patients not receiving clonidine (4 +/- 5% for awake and 17 +/- 11% for anesthetized subjects). The enhanced pressor responses to ephedrine observed in both awake and anesthetized patients in the presence of clonidine may be attributed to increased catecholamine storage at sympathetic nerve endings due to clonidine, enhanced sensitivity of tissue receptors to which ephedrine binds, potentiation of alpha-adrenoceptor mediated vasoconstriction of both agents, or all of these. It is concluded that oral clonidine preanesthetic medication of 5 micrograms.kg-1 does augment rather than attenuate the pressor responses to intravenous ephedrine in patients both prior to and during general anesthesia.\r"

They were randomly divided into three groups: group 1 (n = 20) received IT morphine; group 2 (n = 22) received epidural bupivacaine; and group 3 (n = 20) received a combination of both using a combined spinal-epidural (CSE) technique. According to a visual analogue scale for assessing analgesia, neither IT 0.2 mg morphine nor 10 ml 0.125% epidural bupivacaine was effective in producing adequate pain relief in labor, whereas the combination produced excellent analgesia. The use of IT morphine significantly reduced the dosage requirement of epidural bupivacaine. The incidence of nausea, vomiting, and pruritus was significantly higher when IT morphine had been administered, whereas that of urinary retention did not differ. No serious respiratory depression occurred in any of the patients. When the course of labor was studied, the prior use of IT morphine significantly prolonged the duration of the first stage of labor and the total duration of labor. We conclude that the administration of 0.2 mg IT morphine in combination with epidural administration of 0.125% bupivacaine provides better analgesia than the administration of either drug alone.\r"

We compared the sedative properties of intravenous butorphanol with those of midazolam or the combination in 126 healthy preoperative patients. Subjects were randomly assigned to receive one of nine treatments in a double-blind fashion: 7.1, 22.5, or 71.4 micrograms/kg butorphanol; 4.3, 13.6, or 42.9 micrograms/kg midazolam; or 3.6 + 2.2, 11.3 + 6.8, or 35.7 + 21.5 micrograms/kg butorphanol and midazolam in combination. Eight visual analogue scales (VAS) were completed by the subject and an observer. The subject then performed two psychomotor tests (the Trieger dot test and the Halstead trail-making test) and was shown two playing cards in order to assess memory. The test drug was administered, and 5 min later the evaluations were repeated and two more cards were shown. On the following day the subjects were asked to recall the names of the playing cards. Butorphanol, midazolam, and their combination produced dose-related changes in VAS scores that were significant and qualitatively similar: subjects became sleepy, less nervous, weak, and less clear-thinking. There was no significant euphoria or dysphoria. The sedative and depressant effects on respiratory rate of the high-dose combination were significantly greater than those predicted by simple additivity: 14 of 14 subjects receiving the high dose of the butorphanol/midazolam combination had lid droop and marked sedation, and 2 of 14 subjects had respiratory rates of less than 4 breaths per min. All three drug treatments caused significant, dose-dependent impairment of psychomotor function.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

An 800-ml-capacity intravenous bag was placed within the anterior mediastinum of 12 dogs to simulate a mediastinal mass. After mediastinal mass inflation, the authors measured cardiac index (CI) during periods of spontaneous ventilation (SV), SV with added continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), intermittent positive-pressure ventilation (IPPV), and continuous positive-pressure ventilation (CPPV). Similar mediastinal mass volumes resulted in similar decreases in CI during SV (169 +/- 51 to 105 +/- 10 ml.kg-1.min-1); CPAP (175 +/- 48 to 122 +/- 34 ml.kg-1.min-1); IPPV (151 +/- 15 to 93 +/- 24 ml.kg-1.min-1); and CPPV (183 +/- 56 to 117 +/- 46 ml.kg-1.min-1). The authors also found, by linear regression, that the relationship between CI and mass volume was similar during both SV and IPPV. In six dogs, transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) was used to measure ventricular short axis dimensions. The authors found that mass inflation caused left ventricular end-diastolic dimension to decrease significantly by 6 +/- 2 mm and 4 +/- 1 mm during SV or IPPV, respectively, and right ventricle dimensions to increase by 2 +/- 1 mm and 3 +/- 1 mm during SV or IPPV, respectively. The changes in chamber dimensions were similar with either SV or IPPV. These results suggest that the decrease in CI associated with a mediastinal mass results from an increase in right ventricular afterload, causing right ventricular enlargement. Subsequently, there is impingement on the left ventricle volume because of interventricular interdependence.\r"

  ".W": "Several studies have demonstrated synergistic antinociception following low-dose administration of morphine and alpha-2 adrenergic agonists at the spinal level. This study was carried out in order to identify the opiate subtypes that are likely to be involved in such synergistic suppression of noxiously evoked activity of wide-dynamic-range (WDR) neurons in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord. We also examined the effect of opiate antagonists and alpha-2 adrenergic antagonists on the suppression produced by opiate or alpha-2 adrenergic agonists. Extracellular activity of single WDR neurons in the spinal dorsal horn, which was evoked by a radiant heat stimulus (51 degrees C), was recorded in decerebrate, spinally transected cats. Agonists were administered spinally and antagonists intravenously. In the synergism study, ineffective doses of the moderately selective mu agonist morphine (25 micrograms), the delta agonist DADL (20 micrograms), and the selective delta agonist DPDPE (30 micrograms), when combined with an ineffective dose of the alpha-2 adrenergic agonist clonidine (5 micrograms) produced significant synergistic suppression of noxiously evoked WDR neuronal activity. However, the ineffective or slightly effective dose of the selective mu agonist DAGO (1 or 1.5 micrograms, respectively) did not show any synergistic action with clonidine. Furthermore, the synergism between morphine and clonidine was reversed by the selective delta antagonist ICI 174,864. We interpret these results to indicate that opiates interact at spinal delta receptors to produce a synergistic suppression of evoked WDR neuronal activity in the presence of spinal clonidine. An alternative explanation is that ICI 174,864 may interact in some way with alpha-adrenergic systems.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The influence of isoflurane and adenosine on left ventricular myocardial blood flow was investigated in dogs chronically instrumented for measurement of systemic and coronary hemodynamics, regional myocardial contractile function (with ultrasonic sonomicrometers), and myocardial perfusion (by the radioactive microsphere method). An Ameroid constrictor was implanted on the left circumflex coronary artery to produce a progressive stenosis that gradually reduced vascular reserve of the distal perfusion territory. The depletion of reserve was evaluated by daily monitoring of the hyperemic response to adenosine. A stenosis of moderate severity was considered present when left circumflex reserve was attenuated by approximately 60-70%. During left circumflex stenosis development, the left anterior descending coronary artery was totally occluded for 2 min each hour eight times daily with a hydraulic occluder to stimulate coronary collateral development over a period of 9-13 days. Contractile dysfunction during and flow debt repayment after each brief occlusion were used to monitor coronary collateral development. After stenosis and collateral development had occurred, the left anterior descending coronary artery was permanently occluded to simulate a condition of multivessel coronary artery disease with enhanced collateral development. In separate groups of experiments, hemodynamics and myocardial perfusion were measured before and after administration of adenosine (0.54 and 1.08 mg/min) or isoflurane (1.1 and 1.9%, end-tidal) and in the presence of either agent during adjustment of diastolic aortic pressure and heart rate to control levels. Total left anterior descending coronary artery occlusion in the presence of a moderate left circumflex stenosis produced an increase in mean arterial and left ventricular end diastolic pressures. Isoflurane decreased arterial pressure, left ventricular systolic pressure, and positive rate of increase of left ventricular pressure (dP/dt50) without altering heart rate. Administration of the high concentration of isoflurane reduced blood flow in normal areas and in regions distal to the partial (from 1.05 +/- 0.10 to 0.76 +/- 0.11 ml.min-1.g-1) or total coronary occlusion (from 0.64 +/- 0.10 to 0.41 +/- 0.11 ml.min-1.g-1). However, when arterial pressure and heart rate were restored to levels present in the conscious state, perfusion in all zones was maintained at control levels (1.06 +/- 0.11 for the stenotic and 0.69 +/- 0.12 ml.min-1.g-1 for the occluded region). Ratios of transmural blood flow between occluded and normal or occluded and stenotic zones were not different from the conscious state during a constant aortic pressure and heart rate.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Previous studies of coronary vasomotor effects of isoflurane were complicated by changes in systemic hemodynamic conditions and in global cardiac work demands. Accordingly, in the current study, the left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) of 11 open-chest dogs anesthetized with fentanyl and pentobarbital was cannulated and perfused with isoflurane-free arterial blood or with arterial blood equilibrated in an extracorporeal oxygenator with isoflurane (0.5, 1.0, 2.0% in 95.5% oxygen-4.5% carbon dioxide). Steady-state changes in coronary blood flow (CBF) in LAD were measured electromagnetically, and their transmural distribution (endocardium: epicardium ratio) was evaluated with 15-microns radioactive microspheres. Venous blood was obtained from the anterior interventricular vein and analyzed for oxygen tension (PO2) and oxygen content. Myocardial oxygen consumption (MVO2) was calculated using the Fick equation. Cardiac responses during isoflurane were compared to those during maximal vasodilation with intracoronary adenosine. Perfusion pressure was maintained at 100 mmHg. CBF increased 271, 279, and 503% with 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0% isoflurane, respectively, with no change in the endocardium:epicardium ratio. With 2.0% isoflurane, the increase in CBF was 80% of the maximal, adenosine-induced response. The increases in CBF caused by isoflurane were accompanied by greater than proportional increases in venous PO2 and decreases in the arteriovenous oxygen difference, reflecting the reduction (approximately 40% in MVO2. In conclusion, isoflurane has a direct, concentration-dependent relaxing effect on coronary vascular smooth muscle in the canine heart in situ. The ability of isoflurane to increase CBF nearly maximally while also significantly reducing local myocardial oxygen requirements attests to the potency of isoflurane's direct vasodilator action.\r"

  ".W": "Intrathecally administered alpha 2-adrenergic agonists produce analgesia in humans but may also produce hypotension and bradycardia. To further characterize hemodynamic depression produced by intrathecally administered alpha 2-adrenergic agonists, clonidine (100-1,500 micrograms) was injected into the cervical, thoracic, or lumbar intrathecal space of conscious sheep. Only thoracic intrathecal clonidine injection (100 or 300 micrograms) decreased blood pressure, whereas these doses did not affect blood pressure when injected at other sites. A greater clonidine dose (1,500 micrograms) increased blood pressure to a similar degree at all sites. Hypotension after thoracic intrathecal clonidine injection was inhibited by pretreatment with the alpha 2-adrenergic antagonist idazoxan (1 mg, intrathecally) or the depleter of acetylcholine stores hemicholinium-3 (2 mg, intrathecally), suggesting an action at alpha 2-adrenoceptors on cholinergic preganglionic sympathetic neurons. ST-91, a polar clonidine analog, did not decrease blood pressure after thoracic intrathecal injection. Intrathecal injection of the muscarinic receptor agonist carbamylcholine increased blood pressure. These data describe a complex action of intrathecal alpha 2-adrenergic agonists on hemodynamic parameters that is dependent on site of injection, drug dose, and drug lipophilicity; that can be explained by anatomic factors; and that may possibly be exploited to minimize hemodynamic depression from these agents.\r"

Decision trees were constructed including test availability, test result, test predictive values, and the consequences of correct or incorrect treatment decisions. Five diagnostic algorithms were assessed. ELISA was found to make a contribution to the diagnosis of tuberculosis similar to that of sputum smear. Chest roentgenography improved the quality of patient care, but it did so at substantially increased cost. While ELISA did not add to the diagnosis when sputum smear was available, it might be of great use where sputum smear is not available.\r"

The demographic group with the highest cumulative incidence of acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) (non-white residents of the four urban counties adjacent to New York City) sustained an increase of 10.1 deaths/100,000 men/yr and 3.1 deaths/100,000 women/yr. Groups with lower cumulative incidence of AIDS sustained smaller increases in mycobacterial disease mortality. The group with the lowest cumulative incidence of AIDS (white residents outside the four urban counties adjacent to New York City) sustained the smallest increase in tuberculosis (TB) mortality. Using single cause of death data, it was not possible to identify a relationship between increased extrapulmonary TB deaths and AIDS cumulative incidence, but such a relationship was identifiable from multiple cause of death data. Of 30 mycobacterial disease deaths of all ages with cellular immune deficiency as a contributory diagnosis on the death certificate, 21 (70%) were known to the state's AIDS registry as AIDS cases and four more (13%) were known to the registry as having human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) disease not meeting the full clinical criteria for AIDS. Young populations with a high cumulative incidence of AIDS have experienced substantially increased mortality from mycobacterial diseases. The association of mycobacterial disease mortality with HIV disease may be underestimated from AIDS registry data and from searches of single cause of death data for mycobacterial disease deaths.\r"

Rates of both adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma increased throughout the period in both Jewish men and women, but the increase in adenocarcinoma was more pronounced in the last study period than that in squamous cell carcinoma. In 1977-1982 the rate ratio of squamous cell carcinoma to adenocarcinoma among Jewish men was 1.7. In Arab men it was 2.9, and in Jewish women 0.57. The Kreyberg I/II ratio among Jewish men was about 2.7 with no clear trend throughout the study period, and among Arab men this gradually decreased from 8.1 to 3.5. Jewish women had a constant Kreyberg I/II ratio of about 1 through the whole study period, but the ratio in Arab women was significantly higher than 1, with a mean overall ratio of 3.2. Jews and Arabs in Israel are different from each other in their patterns of lung cancer histology and are different to some extent from other populations in the Western world.\r"

  ".W": "Although aerosolized pentamidine (AP) has recently been approved for prophylaxis and is undergoing clinical trials for treatment of pneumocystis, pneumonia (PCP), factors important in the deposition of AP have not been described. Using radioaerosol techniques, deposition was measured in 22 patients receiving AP for prophylaxis or treatment of PCP. In all patients total and regional deposition of pentamidine, breathing pattern, pulmonary function (PFT), regional ventilation, and type of nebulizer were analyzed. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was performed 24 h after inhalation to assess the relationship between pentamidine levels in BAL fluid and measured aerosol deposition. The nebulizers tested were the Marquest Respirgard II and the Cadema AeroTech II, both previously characterized in our laboratory. The aerosol particles consist of water droplets containing dissolved pentamidine and technetium 99m bound to albumin. Analysis of particles sampled during inhalation via cascade impaction confirmed a close relationship between radioactivity in the droplets and the concentration of pentamidine as measured by HPLC (r = 0.971, p less than 0.0001; n = 18). Deposition was measured by capturing inhaled and exhaled particles on absolute filters and measuring radioactivity. This technique allows the determination of the deposition fraction (DF, the fraction of the amount inhaled that is deposited), which provides information on factors strictly related to the patient. To confirm the filter measurements, pentamidine deposition was also measured by gamma camera. The camera measurement was possible because each patient's thoracic attenuation of radioactivity was determined by a quantitative perfusion scan (mg pentamidine deposited via both techniques, r = 0.949, p less than 0.0001; n = 26). Regional lung volume and ventilation were determined by xenon 133 equilibrium scan and washout. Pentamidine deposition varied markedly between patients, but BAL levels of pentamidine significantly correlated with measured deposition (r = 0.819, p less than 0.01; n = 9). DF averaged 0.621 +/- 0.027 (SEM) and did not correlate with any measured lung parameter, including breathing pattern and PFT. Regional deposition did not correlate with regional ventilation. The major factor influencing pentamidine deposition was aerosol delivery (mg deposited versus mg inhaled; r = 0.963, p less than 0.0001; n = 26). The nebulizer was an important determinant of aerosol delivery, with the AeroTech delivering between 2.5 and 5 times more drug than the Respirgard. These observations are important in assessing treatment failure and cost of therapy.\r"

Moreover, changing ventilator tubings every 24 rather than every 48 h increases the risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia. To study the effects of ventilator circuit changes on the rate of nosocomial pneumonia and on patient and circuit colonization, 73 consecutive patients requiring continuous mechanical ventilation for more than 48 h were randomly assigned to either ventilator circuit changes every 48 h (Group 1, n = 38) or no change (Group 2, n = 35). Patients dying or being weaned before 96 h were not analyzed (Group 1 n = 3; Group 2 n = 7; leaving Group 1 n = 35 and Group 2 n = 28; p = 0.13). Ventilator-associated pneumonia was defined as the occurrence during mechanical ventilation or within 48 h after weaning of a new and persistent infiltrate on chest X-ray, purulent tracheal secretions, and a positive culture of a protected brush specimen (greater than or equal to 10(3) cfu/ml). Bacterial colonization was assessed every 48 h by quantitative cultures of pharyngeal swab, tracheal aspirate, humidifying cascade, and expiratory tubing trap. The two groups were similar in terms of age, indication for and duration of ventilation, and severity of illness.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Sulfuric acid (H2SO4) is the most common acid air pollutant in the United States and is thought to have adverse respiratory effects. Sulfuric acid exists in polluted air as a dissolved solute in both small (haze) and large (fog) particles. Previous work in our laboratory has failed to demonstrate bronchoconstriction after near ambient, large-particle H2SO4 exposure in subjects with asthma. However, other investigators have found slight but significant changes in lung function following inhalation of small-particle or small-particle, low-relative-humidity (RH) H2SO4 aerosols, leading us to hypothesize that particle size and/or RH may be important variables in acid aerosol exposure. We initially studied the effects of resting inhalation of large-particle (volume median diameter, VMD, approximately equal to 6 microns) and small-particle (VMD approximately equal to 0.4 microns) aerosols with an H2SO4 concentration of 3 mg/m3 through a mouthpiece and found no effect on specific airway resistance (SRaw) or symptom scores. In a second mouthpiece study designed to compare high-RH (100%), large-particle (VMD approximately equal to 6 microns) and low-RH (less than 10%), small-particle (VMD approximately equal to 0.3 microns) aerosols with an H2SO4 concentration of 3 mg/m3, we again found no effect of either aerosol. We then examined the effects of small-particle aerosols inhaled in dry air during moderate exercise. Although breathing low-RH air during exercise provoked increases in SRaw in almost all subjects, this could not be attributed to H2SO4 since low-RH saline aerosol produced a similar result.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Under controlled conditions in a climate chamber, 11 persons with bronchial hyperreactivity to histamine and bronchial asthma were exposed for 90 min to a mixture of organic solvents at levels of zero, 2.5, and 25 mg/m3. During exposure to 25 mg/m3 a decrease in FEV1 to 90.7% of baseline value was measured. This was significantly different from the initial value (p less than 0.05), but not significantly different from the value found after sham exposure (FEV1, 97.4% of initial value). The decline in FEV1 during exposure to 25 mg/m3 was most pronounced in persons with high bronchial sensitivity. No changes were found in histamine reactivity after exposure, and no late reactions were registered. Ratings of discomfort showed different individual patterns ranging from no response to reactions towards both of the concentrations. The ratings indicated development of tolerance during exposure. Volatile organic compounds in concentrations found in both the work and the home environments may influence lung function and are probably of importance as bronchial irritants.\r"

  ".W": "Recurrent lower respiratory tract symptoms are common and disabling in childhood, but little is known of their natural history and relationship to asthma. We report a 12-month longitudinal study designed to determine the influence of atopy on respiratory symptoms and bronchial responsiveness in 7- and 8-yr-old children. A postal questionnaire inquiring into the presence of respiratory symptoms was sent to 3,698 children aged 7 and 8 yr. Those reporting either current wheeze (14.8%) or current cough in the absence of wheeze (12.8%) were randomized, and a sample was invited to attend for skin testing. The following groups of symptomatic children entered the longitudinal study: 48 atopic children with cough, 48 atopic children with wheeze, 48 nonatopic children with cough, and 48 nonatopic children with wheeze. All children recorded twice daily the best of three peak expiratory flow (PEF) measurements and completed a 10-point symptom score card, each day for 1 yr. They also recorded all treatment taken and made a note of relevant life events. Each child was seen monthly for general assessment and for measurement of methacholine bronchial responsiveness. Despite the arduous nature of the study 183 of the 192 children (95.3%) successfully completed the 12 months of observation. Symptom groups were compared with regard to FEV1, bronchial responsiveness, symptom chronicity and severity, and diurnal and day-to-day variation in PEF. Atopy was associated with a lower FEV1, increased prevalence of bronchial hyperresponsiveness, greater within-day and between-day variation in PEF, and greater severity of respiratory symptoms compared with the absence of atopy.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Because the patterns of mediators released during the early reaction to antigen and CDA-induced rhinitis are similar, we believe that mast cell activation is part of the reaction to CDA. In view of our previous finding that 1-wk pretreatment with topical steroids reduced symptoms and mediator release in the early nasal response to antigen of allergic subjects, we examined the effect of beclomethasone dipropionate on the response to CDA. Using a double-blind, crossover design, 84 micrograms of beclomethasone or placebo were administered in each nostril twice a day to 13 volunteers for 7 days prior to CDA challenge. The reaction to CDA was monitored by measuring the levels of histamine, N-alpha-p-tosyl-L-arginine methyl ester (TAME)-esterase activity and albumin in nasal lavages before and after provocation. Overall symptom scores, as well as scores for rhinorrhea and congestion, were also obtained. Cold, dry air challenge resulted in elevation over baseline of all parameters after placebo pretreatment. After beclomethasone, a significant reduction in histamine levels, but not in TAME-esterase activity or albumin levels or in number of symptoms, was observed. These results indicate that 1-wk pretreatment with beclomethasone affects mast cells, reducing histamine release after CDA, as it did in antigen-induced rhinitis. They also indicate that histamine may not be essential for the development of the immediate nasal reaction to CDA.\r"

  ".W": "We have documented the physiologic effects of fiberoptic bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and endobronchial biopsy performed under local anesthesia in 20 asthmatic subjects, 8 healthy nonatopic control subjects, and 8 atopic nonasthmatic subjects. Premedication consisted of nebulized albuterol (2.5 mg; except for the study of atopic nonasthmatic subjects), ipratropium bromide (500 micrograms), and intramuscular atropine (0.6 mg). Intravenous midazolam was given for mild sedation, and oxygen was delivered via a nasal cannula. FEV1 was measured before and after premedication, immediately postbronchoscopy, and after 2 h recovery. There was a significant fall in mean (+/- SD) FEV1 immediately postbronchoscopy in both the asthmatic (26.2 +/- 16.7%; p less than 0.001) and normal (9 +/- 4.7%, p less than 0.05) groups, which in the asthmatic subjects correlated inversely with the concentration of methacholine provoking a 20% fall in FEV1 (PC20) measured 5 days prebronchoscopy (r = -0.74, p less than 0.001) but not with symptom scores, albuterol use, or peak expiratory flow (PEF) variation recorded during 2 wk before the investigation. There was significant arterial hemoglobin O2 desaturation during biopsy in the asthmatic subjects (median 3%, range -1 to 17% fall from baseline; p less than 0.01), which was not related to any of the measured indices of asthma severity. PC20, measured 5 days before and 5 days after bronchoscopy in the asthmatic subjects and 2 days before and 1 day after bronchoscopy in the atopic nonasthmatic subjects was not significantly affected by the procedure. We conclude that fiberoptic bronchoscopy with BAL and endobronchial biopsy can be conducted safely in asthmatic subjects, but requires caution in those with very responsive airways.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Tracheal smooth muscles from adult dogs 17 to 20 months of age sensitized with ragweed pollen demonstrated a Schultz-Dale phenomenon in response to specific antigen challenge. Seventy percent of the sensitized tracheal smooth muscles developed a Schultz-Dale reaction that consisted only of a phasic response, and the remaining 30% developed a Schultz-Dale reaction that consisted of a phasic component followed by a discrete tonic component. All the Schultz-Dale reactions were mediated only by histamine. The triggering of presynaptic acetylcholine release by histamine during the Schultz-Dale reaction from tracheal smooth muscles of ragweed-pollen-sensitized puppies 6 to 8 months of age was not detected in sensitized adult dogs. Hyperresponsiveness to acetylcholine was detected in tissues from sensitized puppies but not from sensitized adult dogs. Maximal active tension obtained from the sensitized adult canine trachealis during the Schultz-Dale reaction was lower than that obtained from trachealis from sensitized puppies. Dose-response studies showed that sensitized tissues used in the present studies were hyperresponsive to histamine when compared with their nonsensitized control littermates. These results suggest that the nature of the Schultz-Dale response and the identity of the transmitters is age-dependent.\r"

  ".W": "We assessed the role of bradykinin (BK) in allergen-induced early and late bronchial responses, airway inflammation, mediator release, and antigen-induced airway hyperresponsiveness in allergic sheep by studying the effects of the BK B2 receptor antagonist, NPC-567 (D-Arg-[Hyp3, D-Phe7]-BK), on these parameters. Antigen challenge was performed on two occasions greater than 3 wk apart, once with placebo (control) and once after high-dose (10 mg/ml) and low-dose (5 mg/ml) treatments with aerosol NPC-567. In the control trials (n = 14) antigen challenge resulted in an early and late increase in specific lung resistance (SRL). The early response was associated with increases (p less than 0.05) in prostaglandin (PG) D2, immunoreactive kinin, tosyl-L-arginine methyl ester (TAME)-esterase, and PGE2 in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid. The late response was associated with increases (p less than 0.05) in leukotrienes (LT) B4 and C4, thromboxane (TX) B2, 6-keto-PGF10, and PGE2. There was a significant influx of neutrophils in the BAL fluid during the late response, and airway hyperresponsiveness to carbachol aerosol was apparent 4 h after challenge. In six sheep the high-dose NPC-567 treatment (given before, during, and 4 h after antigen challenge) did not attenuate the early bronchoconstrictor response or the early release of mediators but caused a significant reduction in the late response (p less than 0.05). This protective effect was accompanied by reductions (p less than 0.05) in both the concentrations of all the mediators associated with the late response and the severity of the BAL neutrophilia. High-dose NPC-567 did not attenuate the airway hyperresponsiveness or the cellular inflammatory response seen 24 h after challenge. In eight sheep treated with the low dose of NPC-567 (given before, during, and 4, 8, and 24 h after challenge) the early response was not blocked but the late response was again inhibited, as were the mediators associated with the late response. At the low dose the drug did not prevent the airway inflammation at 8 or 24 h. The additional treatments did, however, prevent the 24 h hyperresponsiveness. These data suggest that kinin generation during antigen-induced airway anaphylaxis may be important for controlling the release of arachidonic acid metabolites from airway inflammatory cells that contribute to the development of the late response in the allergic sheep model.\r"

In the present study, the possible significance of hemolysin production was investigated in a model of septic lung failure through infusion of viable bacteria in isolated rabbit lungs; 10(4) to 10(7) E. coli/ml perfusate caused a dose- and time-dependent appearance of hemolysin, accompanied by release of potassium, thromboxane A2, and PGI2 into the perfusate. Concomitantly, marked pulmonary hypertension developed. Inhibitor studies suggested that the pressor response was predominantly mediated by pulmonary thromboxane generation. Administration of hemolysin-forming E. coli additionally caused a protracted, dose-dependent increase in the lung capillary filtration coefficient, followed by severe edema formation. The permeability increase was independent of lung prostanoid generation. An E. coli strain that releases an inactive form of hemolysin completely failed to provoke the described biophysical and biochemical responses. Preapplication of 2 x 10(8) human granulocytes was without effect in the present experimental model. We conclude that the hemolysin produced by low numbers of E. coli organisms can provoke thromboxane-mediated pulmonary hypertension and severe vascular leakage. E. coli hemolysin and, possibly, other related cytolysins may thus contribute directly to the pathogenesis of acute respiratory failure under conditions of sepsis or pneumonia.\r"

An acclimatization night was followed by two study nights randomly assigned to control (C) and oropharyngeal anesthesia (OPA). On the OPA night topical anesthesia was induced using 10% lidocaine spray and 0.25% bupivacaine gargle. A saline placebo was used on night C. All subjects slept well on both study nights (mean sleep duration was 6.2 h on both study nights), and sleep stage distribution was similar on both nights. Obstructive apneas and hypopneas (OAH) rose from 114 +/- 43 during C to 170 +/- 49 during OPA (p less than 0.02). Central apneas and hypopneas (CAH) were unchanged between the two nights (8 +/- 4.9 versus 7 +/- 3).

The mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of CD2 on lung T cells obtained by bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was significantly higher than that on blood T cells in all study groups except the control group. In patients with pulmonary sarcoidosis this enhancement of the expression of CD2 antigen was observed only on CD4+ T cells. Since ligands for CD2 are present on immunocompetent cells of other types in the local pulmonary milieu, these results suggest that increased expression of CD2 molecules could facilitate the communication and interaction of lung T cells with their environment in the lung and thereby possibly contribute to the local accumulation of T cells.\r"

The alveolar macrophage plays an important role in pulmonary host defense, and to fulfill this role it must have the ability to orient and migrate in the direction of a stimulus. Thus migratory activity was measured in cells recovered from lung transplant recipients by bronchoalveolar lavage. The primary patient group consisted of recipients who had no evidence of infection or rejection at the time of bronchoalveolar lavage. These patients were further subdivided into an early postoperative group (less than 6 wk posttransplant) and a late postoperative group (greater than 6 wk posttransplant). Other categories included patients with chronic rejection and a small group of patients with Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia. Alveolar macrophages recovered by bronchoalveolar lavage were assayed for migratory response to N-formylmethlonylphenylalanine and endotoxin-activated human serum. Stimulated migration of cells from healthy recipients obtained in the late postoperative course was similar to that of normal control subjects, but stimulated migration of cells from healthy recipients in the early postoperative period and those undergoing chronic rejection was greater than expected. Spontaneous migration was similar in all groups except those with P. carinii pneumonia, in whom it was greatly increased. We conclude that alveolar macrophage migration is not impaired in lung allograft recipients without apparent signs of infection or rejection and is in fact increased during periods of possible macrophage activation (shortly after transplantation and during chronic rejection).\r"

  ".W": "Activation of the complement pathway with generation of the potent chemotaxin C5a may play a significant role in the neutrophil accumulation seen in the lungs of patients with smoking-associated diseases. Although C5a is rapidly degraded to the less potent chemotaxin C5a des Arg, binding of this peptide with its cochemotaxin Gcglobulin (GcG) can restore its chemotactic potency. Therefore, modulation of Gcglobulin levels in smoking-induced lung disease could affect the accumulation of neutrophils seen in this disorder. To test this hypothesis GcG was measured by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in bronchoalveolar lavage fluids (BALF) obtained from non-smokers, asymptomatic smokers, and patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Antigenic amounts of GcG in BALF were increased in COPD patients and asymptomatic smokers compared with nonsmokers (6.35 +/- 1.02 and 5.15 +/- 1.07 versus 2.82 +/- 0.37 micrograms/mg albumin, p less than 0.05). In addition, we found that BALF enhanced C5a des Arg-mediated chemotaxis (48.3 +/- 5.6 versus 11.2 +/- 1.6 cells/high power field, p less than 0.05), an effect that was not seen in the presence of GcG antibody. Furthermore, BALF GcG was similar to serum GcG using Western blot analysis, and the interaction of GcG with C5a des Arg was not inhibited by cigarette smoke. These data demonstrate that elevation of BALF GcG levels occurs in smoking-associated lung disease and that this protein is biologically active and capable of increasing C5a des Arg-mediated chemotaxis. This suggests that modulation of GcG levels may be important in smoking-associated lung diseases.\r"

Quantitative bacterial cultures of the PBAL specimens had a diagnostic sensitivity of 97% and a specificity of 92%, with a positive predictive value of 97% and a negative predictive value of 92%. The diagnostic efficiency was 96%. The presence of intracellular organisms in much greater than or equal to 2% of the recovered alveolar cells (Giemsa stain) was seen in all but two patients with pneumonia (on corticosteroids) and in none of the patients without pneumonia. Gram stains of the PBAL specimens were positive in all but one patient with pneumonia and negative in all but one patient without infection (patient with endobronchial narrowing secondary to neoplasm with false positive cultures). Either the Giemsa or the Gram stain was positive in all patients with pneumonia, allowing early and accurate diagnosis of lower respiratory tract infection before the results of cultures were available. The time off antibiotic therapy before bronchoscopy did not affect the result of PBAL cultures, contrary to what we observed for the protected brush specimen.\r"

  ".W": "High-frequency oscillatory ventilation (HFOV) permits adequate gas exchange but avoids the large phasic pressure-volume excursions of conventional mechanical ventilation (CMV); such avoidance may reduce the lung injury associated with hyaline membrane disease (HMD). We hypothesized that premature monkeys ventilated from birth with HFOV would have reduced lung injury compared to those assigned to CMV. Macaca nemestrina were delivered at 134 days (80% of term gestation) and ventilated from the first breath with either HFOV (n = 10) or CMV (n = 10). The mean airway pressure (Paw) was kept at 15 cm H2O pressure in HFOV animals; in CMV animals Paw was increased from 8 cm H2O at 2 h to 13 cm H2O at 6 h to prevent hypoxemia. At the conclusion of the 6-h experiment the HFOV animals had better oxygenation (p less than 0.05) and less evidence of HMD by chest radiograph (p less than 0.05). At 6 h of age a piece of the right middle lung lobe was removed, divided, and placed in fixatives for light and transmission electron microscopy. The lungs were subsequently inflated to 30 cm H2O pressure, and the right lower lobe was rapidly frozen in situ for morphometric studies. The proportion of peripheral lung tissue occupied by clear alveoli was greater in HFOV animals (66.3 +/- 14.8%) than in those assigned to CMV (44.2 +/- 16.9%, p less than 0.01); less alveolar debris and fluid was present in the HFOV animals (12.7 +/- 9.9%) compared with CMV animals (27.1 +/- 12.5%, p less than 0.02).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "We studied intra- and extrapericardial surface pressures (Ppe and Pex) over the left ventricle with air-filled flat balloons in six dogs under different levels of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) and left ventricular end-diastolic pressure. Pex reflected lung constraint and the transpericardial pressure (Ppe-Pex) reflected the elastic recoil of the pericardium (pericardial constraint). Under baseline plasma volume conditions with a PEEP of 0 cm H2O, Ppe was 2.4 +/- 0.2 (SEM) mm Hg and Pex was 0.2 +/- 0.1 mm Hg; that is, 91% of Ppe was contributed by the transpericardial pressure. With incremental increases in PEEP, Pex increased and approach Ppe with a decrease in the transpericardial pressure (p less than 0.01). With a PEEP of 20 cm H2O, Ppe was 5.3 +/- 0.1 mm Hg and Pex was 5.0 +/- 0.2 mm Hg; that is, less than 5% of Ppe was contributed by the transpericardial pressure. Under plasma volume-loaded conditions with an increase in PEEP to 20 cm H2O, Pex increased but remained lower than Ppe, with a substantial contribution of transpericardial pressure still present (19%). These results suggest that lung constraint alone can substantially constrain the left ventricle and that the influence of lung constraint, rather than pericardial constraint, may be progressively important with an elevated lung volume produced by either positive- or negative-pressure respiration.\r"

Surgical resection offers the best opportunity for cure, but resection of disease is possible in only a minority of patients with Stage IIIa disease. Even among patients who have \"successful\" surgery systemic relapse is common, and the 5-yr survival after complete resection is only 30%. Preoperative (neoadjuvant) chemotherapy is under investigation in an attempt to improve the bleak outcome of patients with Stage IIIa NSCLC. Preliminary trials have shown that this approach is feasible: neoadjuvant treatment can be administered with moderate toxicity and in most cases without compromising the possibility for surgical resection. In some instances, neoadjuvant treatment has produced pathologic complete responses, and in others it has decreased tumor bulk so that inoperable patients became surgical candidates. Whether this latter phenomenon has an impact on survival is unknown. Therefore, the role of neoadjuvant treatment for locally advanced lung cancer will not be known until properly designed randomized trials are conducted.\r"

The detection of a fetal anomaly may now lead to a change in the timing of delivery, a change in the mode of delivery, or prenatal treatment. Because most therapeutic maneuvers involve some risk to the fetus and mother, there must be a reasonable expectation that the procedure is feasible, safe, and effective before it can be attempted in humans. This requires reliable information about the pathophysiology and natural history of the disease process, the efficacy of fetal surgical intervention in ameliorating the disease, and the feasibility and safety of the proposed intervention. This paper focuses on the rationale and initial clinical experience with fetal surgery for a variety of life-threatening fetal anatomic defects.\r"

The mechanisms that underlie this remarkable process are mediated in part through a fetal wound extracellular matrix rich in hyaluronic acid. In this study a newly developed assay was used to determine the hyaluronic acid levels in fetal and adult wound fluid. Adult wound fluid had a rapid increase in hyaluronic acid, which peaked at 3 days and decreased to 0 by 7 days. In contrast levels of hyaluronic acid in fetal wound fluid increased rapidly and remained significantly elevated for 3 weeks. This prolonged presence of hyaluronic acid in the matrix of fetal wounds creates a 'permissive' wound environment that promotes fetal fibroblast movement and proliferation and inhibits cytodifferentiation. Such a matrix environment promotes healing by regeneration rather than by scarring. This observation has therapeutic implications. The prolonged application of hyaluronic acid or hyaluronate protein complexes to wounds in children or adults may modulate healing in a manner that makes the wounds more fetal-like.\r"

Results were analyzed for trends in overall and disease-free survival, and patterns of local and distant relapse, the years 1965 to 1970 versus 1971 to 1974 versus 1975 to 1978. Significant changes (p less than 0.00001) from 1965 to 1978 included progressively earlier stage of disease, less frequent use of RM and ERM, a decline in the use of postoperative radiotherapy, and the introduction in 1975 of multidrug adjuvant chemotherapy. Ten-year disease-free survival rates improved significantly for all patients (by 11%, p = 0.00004) and for node-negative (by 12%, p = 0.0024), node-positive (by 8%, p = 0.012), clinical stage II (by 15%, p = 0.0022), and pathologic stage II (by 12%, p = 0.016) disease. Ten-year local recurrence for all patients was 3% (local only) and 2% (local with distant metastasis), and survival from date of recurrence for all patients failing treatment increased two times (p less than 0.0001) for patients treated most recently. As the primary surgical treatment of breast cancer continues to become more moderate, the promise of systemic adjuvant therapies can be realized only with continued emphasis on earlier diagnosis and maximal local control of disease.\r"

During this 4-year interval, 250 patients with melanoma were seen. Of these patients, 75 with a history of stage I (localized) melanoma and three patients with stage II (history of controlled regionally metastatic melanoma) underwent removal of multiple skin lesions on a prophylactic basis. Of the removed lesions, 28% showed hyperplasia, atypia, dysplasia, or melanoma. Nine unsuspected in situ, or level I melanomas, and three unsuspected invasive melanomas were removed from these 75 melanoma patients while excising lesions prophylactically during the 4-year interval. It is estimated that four to six additional melanomas were prevented by excision of precursor lesions. During the same 4-year interval, an additional 112 of approximately 1000 patients without a previous history of melanoma underwent prophylactic lesion removals. In 31% of the 112 patients, there was a history of melanoma in a first-degree relative. In 22% of the removed lesions there was hyperplasia, atypia, or dysplasia. Three cases of melanoma in situ were detected and it is estimated that an additional three to five cases of melanoma were prevented. Atypical findings occurred in 71, or 63%, of the patients biopsied, which represented 7% of the approximately 1000 patients screened. During the 4-year interval, an average of 17.7 lesions were removed from each of the 190 melanoma and nonmelanoma patients undergoing prophylactic skin lesion excision. This was accomplished in one to four sessions per patient. This average reflects only those patients who underwent one excision or more and does not include those patients treated without operation. When including the nonoperated patients screened during this interval, the average number of lesions removed was 2.7 per patient. Death from new melanomas was prevented during the 14-year period of this study as evidenced by the fact that no patient died or developed metastatic disease from a cutaneous melanoma that was not apparent or known about at the time of first examination.\r"

Fifty-one black PSs contained bilirubin polymers, calcium carbonate, and/or phosphate, seldom cholesterol, and never evident amounts of calcium palmitate, were mostly found in the gallbladder, and were associated with hemolysis or liver damage and with hyperplastic cholecystosis. Bile infection was found in 19.6% of cases, but bacteria were never found in the center of black PSs by scanning electron microscopy. Nine additional patients (8.2% of PSs, 0.9% of GSs) had concomitant black and brown PSs that were mostly found in the common duct and were always associated with bile infection. It is suggested that, even if PSs with concomitant black and brown material can be found, black and brown PSs greatly differ not only in pathogenesis but also in clinical behavior and treatment. In particular bacterial infection is important only in the pathogenesis of brown PSs while it plays no role in the initial formation of cholesterol, mixed or black GSs.\r"

Survival showed no significant correlation with sex, tumor site, macroscopic appearance, extent of gastric resection, or histopathologic type. Tumors larger than 1.5 cm in diameter, invasion of submucosa, or lymph node metastasis resulted in significantly lower survival rates. Three of eight patients with nodal metastasis survived 5 or more years, including one who had second-echelon deposits. A high index of suspicion may permit more frequent detection. Extended lymphadenectomy (R2) is recommended to achieve the highest possible cure rate.\r"

An aliquot of the collected sample was kept and the enterohepatic circulation was maintained by reinfusion of the collected bile via the distal t-tube port. Glucagon increased bile flow and decreased cholesterol and phospholipid output during stable bile acid output. Furthermore high-performance liquid chromatographic analysis of bile acid profiles revealed no significant changes in bile salt species or conjugation after glucagon infusion. Glucagon is probably important in the physiologic regulation of biliary secretion in humans.\r"

The stimuli include the intra-arterial infusion of oleic acid (FFA), a 2-hour period of ischemia before perfusion (ISCH), partial obstruction of the pancreatic duct with secretin stimulation (POSS), and the intra-arterial infusion of cerulein at supramaximal doses (CER). In the present study, changes in high-energy phosphate metabolism, as determined by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and changes in cellular structure, determined by light and electron microscopy, were documented for all four models of acute pancreatitis. The control preparations remained stable for the 4-hour perfusion period, with no decrease in adenosine triphosphate (ATP) levels. In the FFA preparations, ATP decreased to 36% of baseline levels during the 4-hour perfusion (p less than 0.001). In the ISCH preparations, ATP decreased to undetectable levels during the 2-hour period of ischemia, but recovered rapidly and remained at baseline levels during the perfusion. ATP levels remained stable in the remaining two models of pancreatitis (POSS, CER). Microscopy demonstrated that the initial injury was located chiefly in the capillaries (swollen endothelium, intravascular thrombi) in the FFA and ISCH preparations. In the POSS and CER preparations, capillary changes were minimal and the injury was located chiefly in the acinar cells (swollen endoplasmic reticulum, zymogen granule depletion, vacuolization). The POSS preparations also showed striking dilation of centroacinar lumens reflecting duct obstruction. In additional studies it was shown that the ATP decline in the FFA preparations could be significantly reduced by pretreatment with free radical scavengers. The morphologic changes could be reduced by free radical scavengers in the FFA and ISCH preparations. Any amelioration of morphologic injury in the POSS preparations was obscured by dilatation of centroacinar lumens in both treated and untreated groups. The morphologic changes in the CER preparations were reduced by treatment with a cholecystokinin inhibitor.\r"

The purpose of this study was to develop an animal model of noninfectious biliary tract inflammation and fibrosis. An implantable osmotic pump was connected to a catheter placed into the gallbladder of hamsters. Phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) was infused into the biliary tract for periods of 6 hours to 28 days. After 7 days the animals developed neutrophil infiltration, cellular necrosis, and edema of the biliary ducts. After 14 days, the animals demonstrated intrahepatic cholestasis with bile duct fibrosis and acute and chronic inflammatory cell infiltration. By 28 days pronounced portal fibrosis was present, some of which created an early bridging cirrhosis pattern. In addition there was evidence of neocholangiogenesis. We conclude that long-term PMA infusion into the biliary tract generates an inflammatory response characterized by obliterative cholangitis and fibrosis, sharing many of the histologic features of human biliary atresia. This model may provide a relatively simple technique for investigating the process of nonpyogenic biliary tract inflammation.\r"

  ".W": "Clinical and necropsy findings are described in 40 patients who had aortic dissection with the entrance tear in the descending thoracic aorta. Their ages at death ranged from 39 to 91 years (mean, 66 years); 24 (60%) were men and 16 (40%) were women. Systemic hypertension was present by history in 33 patients (83%) and the hearts were of increased weight in 78%. Of the 40 patients, 31 (78%) had no operative intervention, while 9 (22%) underwent operation for aortic dissection. Of the 31 patients without operative therapy, the diagnosis of aortic dissection was established in life in 9 patients (29%) and at necropsy in 22 (71%). The interval from aortic dissection to death was 30 days or less in 13 patients (42%); rupture of the false channel was the cause of death in 9 patients (69%), renal failure in 2 (15%), and the cause was unclear in 2 (15%). The interval from aortic dissection to death was more than 30 days in 18 (58%) of the 31 patients without operative therapy. The cause of death in these 18 patients was related to the dissection in 11 (61%) (rupture of the false channel in 5; renal failure from dissection in 3, and rupture of the false channel of a second acute dissection in 3), but in the other 7 patients (39%) death was unrelated to the dissection but a nonfatal complication, specifically stenosis of the true channel from compression by a thrombus-filled false channel, occurred in 4 of these 7 patients. Thus only 3 (10%) of the 31 patients without operative therapy had no complications of aortic dissection. All nine patients who underwent operation had had an aortic dissection within 30 days, and the operation was performed because of a major complication of the dissection. Four patients survived 8 to 84 months after the operation. Thus early operative intervention (before the appearance of complications) appears justified in patients with aortic dissection with the entrance tear in the descending thoracic aorta to prevent rupture of the false channel acutely or after initial healing; to prevent renal failure from compression of renal arteries by an aneurysmal false channel; to prevent true channel stenosis from compression by a thrombus-filled false channel; and possibly to prevent the recurrence of acute dissection.\r"

  ".W": "Prompted by a recent study suggesting that the combination of desipramine hydrochloride and fluoxetine down-regulates beta-adrenergic receptors more rapidly than either drug alone, we administered both desipramine and fluoxetine to 14 inpatients with major depression in an open, 4-week trial. Desipramine plasma levels drawn 24 hours after an initial standardized dose were used to rapidly adjust desipramine dosage and compensate for the interactive effects of fluoxetine on desipramine levels in the blood. Responses were retrospectively compared with those of 52 inpatients who were descriptively similar and previously treated in the same setting with desipramine alone. Response was significantly more rapid in the group that received both drugs. One week after treatment began, the mean change in Hamilton Depression Rating Scale scores was 42% in the group that received both drugs and 20% in the group that received desipramine alone (Mann-Whitney U test, P = .007). Two weeks after administration of the drugs, the mean change in scores of the group that received both drugs was 60%, while a 30% change was noted in the patients treated with desipramine alone (P = .001). Ten (71%) of the 14 patients in the group that received both drugs completely remitted (change in Hamilton Depression Rating Scale score of greater than 75%, and final score of less than 7) within 4 weeks, while few patients treated with desipramine alone met these criteria within 4 weeks. This preliminary study suggests that treatment with both desipramine and fluoxetine is a rapid and effective strategy for treatment of major depression, and supports recent hypotheses of noradrenergic-serotonergic synergism.\r"

Then, on the basis of the index data alone and without knowledge of their eventual outcomes, they were subtyped according to the Research Diagnostic Criteria, DSM-III, Newcastle Index, and Present State Examination diagnostic criteria. Patients who met the various subtype criteria at index were compared with those who did not in respect to their long-term outcome. Subtyping had little prognostic utility except for three endogenous criteria that were all associated with poor outcome. In addition, DSM-III melancholia had an interactive effect with the personality measure neuroticism, so that those melancholic patients who at index had high neuroticism scores were very likely to have a poor outcome.\r"

These patients were found to benefit selectively from therapy with monoamine oxidase inhibitors compared with tricyclic drug therapy. This supports our observation about treatment response in depressed patients with reversed vegetative features. The design we utilized in this study has not previously been reported, to our knowledge. It was hypothesized that it would offer the advantage of the removal of a portion of placebo responders and serve to replicate our original findings. Treatment response to therapy with both imipramine and pheneizine in placebo nonresponders was uniformly lower (roughly 20% less than corresponding rates for patients who did not participate in the initial 6-week placebo trial). This is consistent with the view that the lower response rates were a result of the removal of some \"placebo\" responders in the drug groups. We think this is a useful design that should be considered in all studies of placebo and two active treatment regimens.\r"

Forty subjects (21 given clonidine and 19 placebo) successfully completed the 12-week, double-blind clinical trial. Clinical ratings of tic severity improved for both groups. The magnitude of response was greater in the group receiving clonidine. Clinician-rated measures of motor tic severity, the degree to which the tics are \"noticeable to others,\" motor tic counts from videotaped interviews, and parent-rated measures of impulsivity and hyperactivity were the most responsive to clonidine treatment. These results indicate that clonidine is more effective than placebo in reducing some of the tic and other behavioral symptoms associated with Gilles de la Tourette's syndrome.\r"

Fourteen percent of patients given maintenance treatment were dropped from the study compared with 46% of intermittently treated patients. Relapse rates were 16% for patients given maintenance treatment and 30% for intermittently treated patients, a nonsignificant difference. Intermittently treated patients were receiving significantly less medication, but there were no differences found in drug side effects. There appears to be no advantage in using the intermittent approach, but we found that the use of an early intervention strategy reduced the relapse and rehospitalization rates for these patients.\r"

By 24 months, a persistent and significant effect of family intervention on forestalling relapse was observed, but the effect of social skills training was lost late in the 2nd year. There was no additive effect on relapse that accrued to the combination of treatments. Beyond 2 years, however, the effect of family intervention was likely compromised as well. Treatment effects on the adjustment of survivors were circumscribed, due, in part, to study design characteristics. Effects generally favored the social skills-alone condition at 1 year and the family condition or combined family/social skills condition at 2 years.\r"

Each study was preceded by 3 days of habituation to the laboratory environment. Sleep was polygraphically recorded. The circadian and pulsatile variations present in each hormonal profile were quantitatively characterized with the use of computer algorithms specifically designed for analyses of hormonal fluctuations. The major abnormality of neuroendocrine release that was observed in the schizophrenic patients was an almost threefold enhancement of the sleep-related increase in the prolactin level, associated with an intensified frequency of nocturnal prolactin pulses. This increased stimulatory effect of sleep on prolactin secretion was evident immediately after sleep onset. The normal inhibition of cortisol secretion during early sleep was absent in schizophrenic patients. The major sleep abnormalities were a prolonged sleep latency and a reduction in total rapid eye movement stage sleep. During wakefulness, prolactin and cortisol levels were normal. The 24-hour profile of growth hormone was unaltered in schizophrenic patients, and a sleep-onset growth hormone pulse was observed in all patients. No abnormalities were noted in the levels or temporal organization of corticotropin secretion. Both the amplitude and the timing of the cortisol rhythm were normal. We conclude that, in schizophrenic men, pituitary-adrenal function and circadian time-keeping are normal but prolactin secretion is hyperresponsive to the physiologic stimulus of sleep onset. Schizophrenia thus appears to be characterized by a subset of neuroendocrine disturbances distinct from that observed in major endogenous depression.\r"

Using the concept of diagnostic validators, I reviewed the empirical evidence for the validity of these four viewpoints. The available evidence argues relatively strongly against the first and fourth viewpoints and rather less strongly against the third. Data from diagnostic validators tend to support the second viewpoint, which is that taken by the framers of DSM-III and DSM-III-R.\r"

The comprehensive treatment team has been the foundation of rehabilitation, but its appropriateness has to be looked at in light of current conditions in health care. Evidence of its effectiveness has been meager. This article is an examination of the origins of the team, its current functioning, and its research on effectiveness. Several alternatives to the current delivery system are suggested, although economic forces may overtake attempts to establish effectiveness by research.\r"

  ".W": "Traumatic brain injury (TBI) can occur concomitantly with spinal cord injury (SCI). Much of the initial work in this area has focused on identifying coincidence rates and risk factors; less has focused on possible long-term implications of TBI when it occurs with SCI. In this study, SCI/TBI and neurologically matched SCI-only groups were formed on the basis of clinicians' ratings of neuropsychologic test scores. SCI/TBI and SCI-only groups were also formed using Halstead Category cutoff scores, presence/absence of loss of consciousness, and clinicians' ratings of severity of TBI. Dependent measures assessed an average of two years postinjury measured personal, social, and family adjustment of the individual with SCI and that of a significant other. Loss of consciousness and nonconsensus clinical ratings of presence/absence of TBI predicted postdischarge adjustment poorly. Severity ratings in the moderate to severe range, and Category cutoff scores did have some predictive value, with patients defined as impaired being more likely to report adjustment difficulties or being described as having adjustment difficulties by a significant other. The difficulty of making unequivocal diagnoses of TBI in this population is discussed and implications for future research delineated.\r"

  ".W": "This study was designed to determine the effect of testing posture and elbow position on grip strength. A hand dynamometer was used to measure the grip strength of 61 subjects (26 female and 35 male) in four positions: (1) sitting with elbow in 90 degree flexion, (2) sitting with elbow in full extension, (3) standing with elbow in 90 degree flexion, and (4) standing with elbow in full extension. The four experimental conditions were randomized, and standardized instructions were followed. A two-factor (gender and treatment) repeated measures ANOVA was used to determine any significant difference in grip strength between the sexes and the experimental (treatment) conditions. The result of the ANOVA revealed a significant F-ratio for gender and treatment main effects. Scheffe post hoc analysis revealed that males had higher (p less than .01) grip strength than females at all the testing postures and elbow joint angles, and that there was a significant (p less than .05) difference between the grip strength measured in subjects sitting with the elbow in 90 degree flexion and standing with the elbow in full extension. The findings suggest the need for clinicians to maintain standard testing conditions while measuring grip strength.\r"

Using a controlled triple-blind study design, one group of patients received hot pack applications and passive manual stretching and pulley exercises; the other group received the same therapy plus magnetotherapy. Treatment was administered three times a week. For a maximum of three months, a standardized treatment protocol was used. There was no significant improvement in pain reduction or in range of motion with electromagnetic field therapy. After 12 weeks of therapy, the patients who received magnetotherapy showed mean pain scores of 1.5 (+/- .61 SD) at rest, 2.2 (+/- .76 SD) on movement, and 1.9 (+/- .94 SD), on lying, compared to scores for the control group of 1.4 (+/- .65 SD), 2.2 (+/- .7 SD), and 1.9 (+/- .95 SD), respectively. Linear pain scale scores improved from 71 to 21 for both groups. At 12 weeks the gain in range of motion was mean 109 degrees +/- 46.8 in patients receiving electromagnetic field therapy, compared to 122 degrees +/- 33.4 for the controls (not significant). At entry, the functional handicap score was 53.5 for both groups. At 12 weeks, it was 24 for the magnetotherapy group and 17 for the control group (difference not significant). In conclusion, this study showed no benefit from magnetotherapy in the pain score, range of motion, or improvement of functional status in patients with periarthritis of the shoulder.\r"

The data demonstrated that this ability was significantly poorer in the patient group, indicating an alteration in neck proprioception. This test permits a discriminant classification of healthy and sick subjects, justifies proprioceptive rehabilitation programs, and allows a quantitative evaluation of their results.\r"

  ".W": "Standing balance was evaluated in ten subjects with hemiplegia using a sensory organization balance test (SOT). The SOT is a timed balance test which evaluates somatosensory, visual, and vestibular function for maintenance of upright posture. The duration of bilateral stance was assessed using combinations of three visual and two support surface conditions. Stance time was measured with eyes open, eyes closed, and with each patient wearing a visual dome to produce inaccurate visual information. The support surface conditions involved stance on a hard flat floor followed by attempted stance on a compliant foam surface. Visual deprivation or visual conflict conditions did not cause a loss of balance when stance was performed on a stable surface. However, a lower stance duration was found when patients stood on a compliant surface (p less than .05). Visual compensation was evident during the compliant-surface condition because stance duration showed the greatest reductions with eyes closed and with the visual dome. These findings suggest that the ability to integrate somatosensory information from the lower extremities for balance is compromised after cerebrovascular disease. The implications for diagnosing the specific cause of balance dysfunction and for developing sensory-specific therapeutic interventions are discussed.\r"

Making sense of data generated by these scales is a challenge well met by the Rasch measurement model, which allows detailed investigation of how individuals are likely to perform on a given occasion and indicates whether changes in performance occur in orderly patterns over repeated occasions. Additionally, the Rasch measurement model allows study of the quality of measurement and the degree to which the scoring adequately reflects the underlying, but not directly measurable, continuum. Data gathered at admission and discharge from 330 patients attending a rehabilitation program for chronic low back pain were evaluated using the Rasch measurement model, and the results were contrasted with those from the best available nonparametric technique, ridit analysis.\r"

Statistical analyses were by ANOVA and repeated-measures ANOVA. The RPE was obtained every 20 seconds during an isometric contraction of the quadriceps at 40% of maximal torque; median frequency (Fm) of the power spectrum of the surface electromyographic signal and neuromuscular efficiency (NME) were constantly monitored. The RPE increased similarly (p greater than .05), whereas Fm and NME decreased similarly (p greater than .05) during endurance exercise at 40% of maximal torque in all three groups. A significant (p less than .05) interaction was found between RPE and both Fm and NME. We conclude that physiologic measures of the fatiguing process (Fm and NME) occur in a similar manner in postpolio and control subjects and that there is a significant interaction between subjective RPE and physiologic measures of the fatiguing process.\r"

The gait of 30 ambulatory adults between the ages of 47 and 79 years was studied using two-dimensional cinematography and force-plate data in a link-segment model. About 40% of the positive work required for walking was performed by the muscles of the affected side. Major contributors were the ankle plantar flexors, hip flexors, and hip extensors. The results suggest interdependence between the limbs and between muscle groups of the same limb; a need for further research is indicated.\r"

Upper and lower extremities were evaluated by manual muscle testing for function, range of motion, and strength. The data were analyzed using intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs). For the interevaluator phase, ICCs were as follows: average muscle strength, .90; range of motion, .76; and upper extremity functional performance, .58. For the intraevaluator phase, corresponding ICCs were .80 to .96; .33 to .97; .34 to 1.00. Our results confirm and extend observations by others that these assessment measures are sufficiently reliable for use in a multiinstitutional collaborative effort. Such results can be used to design clinical trials that have sufficient statistical power to detect changes in the rate of disease progression. Investigators planning clinical trials in a multiinstitutional collaborative setting should first standardize the assessment methods, provide evaluator training, and document reliability.\r"

Severity of initial brain injury, best measured by length of coma, was the most significant predictor of GOS outcome. Length of acute hospitalization was a small, but significant, predictor of GOS. Severity of initial brain injury, length of acute hospitalization, and gender emerged as predictors of length of rehabilitation hospital stay. Although length of acute hospitalization is apparently affected by severity of brain injury, it adds significantly--more than severity of brain injury--to the prediction of length of rehabilitation.\r"

One hundred twenty-eight patients completed the third generation Hardiness Scale, together with questionnaires measuring Type A behavior, perceived family cohesion and adaptability, and psychosocial adjustment to illness. The results showed that personality hardiness was the most salient correlate of psychosocial adjustment. High hardiness scores were associated with good adjustment to the various life domains. Angina severity accounted for the variance in social domains, but not the psychologic distress domain. Type A behavior, both dimensions of perceived family dynamics, and the sociodemographic variables did not have a significant role in explaining the variance in psychosocial adjustment. We conclude that personality hardiness could serve as a valid indicator of long-term psychosocial adjustment in patients with coronary artery disease.\r"

Three (38%) of eight local recurrences (all comedo) were invasive. The 5-year actuarial survival for all subgroups was 100%. The median follow-up was 51 months. Intraductal carcinoma is unlikely to metastasize to axillary lymph nodes, and routine dissection is unnecessary. Ductal carcinoma in situ of the comedo variety is more aggressive and more likely to recur than its noncomedo counterpart. We currently view conservative therapy for patients with intraductal comedocarcinoma with caution.\r"

Hepatic metastases were generated by intrasplenic injection of 1.5 x 10(6) human melanoma cells. Three days after injection, animals received salt solution and interleukin 2 or interleukin 2 and cytotoxic T lymphocytes. Twenty-four of 25 control animals had developed multiple tumor nodules in the liver; 11 of 13 animals receiving only interleukin 2 also had significant tumor burdens. In striking contrast, 17 of 18 animals receiving cytotoxic T lymphocytes and interleukin 2 had no gross or histologic evidence of tumors. The remaining animal had a 2-mm nodule. Human tumor-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes are effective in vivo in a model of adoptive immunotherapy and may prove useful in adoptive immunotherapy of humans with metastatic melanoma.\r"

To examine whether visceral tumors mediated tumor-induced suppression, in vitro sensitization cells were generated from mice bearing SC tumors with and without concomitant liver or lung tumors. Antitumor efficacy of these cells was assessed in adoptive immunotherapy experiments. The presence of visceral tumors suppressed the ability to generate therapeutic in vitro sensitization cells from mice with SC tumors. By establishing visceral tumors at different intervals in relationship to SC tumor inoculation, we found that visceral tumor appeared to suppress directly the development of a host immune response to SC tumor, rather than inhibit function of established immune cells. Our model affords a means to study mechanisms of tumor-induced immunosuppression.\r"

In an experimental P815 liver metastasis model, the adoptive transfer of GD11 or GD11.17 clone cells and injection of recombinant interleukin 2 (7500 U intraperitoneally) 3 days after infusion of tumor cells reduced the number of tumor nodules, while the adoptive transfer of lymphokine-activated killer cells was ineffective.\r"

Since opiates are known to affect some components of immune function, this study was conducted to determine the effect of high-dose subcutaneous morphine sulfate and of low-dose intrathecal morphine on the postoperative growth of metastatic colon cancer. Five groups of 15 Fischer 344 rats were given intraportal injections of colon cancer cells as follows: group 1, control; group 2, daily subcutaneous injections of 20-mg/kg morphine the day before and for 2 days after colon cancer cell inoculation; group 3, daily subcutaneous injections of saline; group 4, daily intrathecal injections of 20 micrograms of morphine; and group 5, daily intrathecal injections of saline. There was a significant decrease in the hepatic tumor burden in group 2 compared with groups 1 and 3 and a significant increase in the hepatic tumor burden in groups 4 and 5 compared with group 1. This study demonstrates that intermittent injections of a narcotic may decrease the growth of tumor cells that gain access to the circulation during a surgical procedure. In addition, the results support the concept that tumor cells entering the circulation during a vulnerable period of postoperative immunosuppression are more likely to survive as metastatic tumor.\r"

Surgical resection of recurrent adrenocortical cancer was often extensive, with morbidity in 20% of patients and no mortality. Mitotane therapy was ineffective at controlling tumor growth. Median survival from the time of diagnosis for all patients was only 23 months and no patient was cured. Disease-free interval greater than 12 months was associated with prolonged survival, but it only occurred in six patients (18%), with a similar frequency in both treatment groups. Surgical resection of recurrent disease was associated with prolonged survival from the time of first recurrence. The potential benefit of this resection was evident in the 5 patients (33%) who were able to live greater than 5 years from the time of first recurrence with improvement in symptoms and signs of hypercortisolism. Although no patient with recurrent adrenal cancer could be cured, resection of recurrent disease was associated with a slight prolongation of survival and good palliation of Cushing's syndrome.\r"

In this study, we evaluated this ubiquitin hybrid protein gene expression in surgical specimens of colon cancers. Northern blot analysis showed that ubiquitin hybrid protein messenger RNA was overexpressed in primary colon cancers compared with adjacent normal colon mucosae in 17 of 20 patients. Dot blot analysis of RNA of 27 tumor samples revealed significantly greater expression in higher Dukes' stage primary colon tumors and liver metastases. These data imply that protein translation machinery is highly activated during progression and metastasis of colon tumors, and that ubiquitin hybrid protein may be useful as a marker of biological aggressiveness.\r"

In this study we examined the effects of two agents that promote cellular differentiation, sodium butyrate and hexamethylene bisacetamide, on the in vitro growth and secretory responses of a human pancreatic carcinoid (BON) and human gastrinoma (PT-2 and PT-SM) cell lines that have been established in our laboratory. We found that both sodium butyrate and hexamethylene bisacetamide strongly inhibited growth of BON, PT-2, and PT-SM cells. With continuous exposure of BON cells to sodium butyrate (2 mmol/L), the doubling time was prolonged, from 60 hours in controls to 156 hours, and saturation density was reduced to 28% that of controls. Hexamethylene bisacetamide (4 mmol/L) reduced saturation density to 37% that of controls in BON cells and prolonged the doubling time, from 60 hours to 103 hours. Antiproliferative effects of similar magnitudes were observed in the gastrinoma cell lines. In contrast, differential effects were produced on amine biosynthesis in BON cells; sodium butyrate stimulated levels of 5-hydroxytryptamine in the cells, whereas hexamethylene bisacetamide caused a profound dose-dependent inhibition of amine biosynthesis. The significant antiproliferative activity of sodium butyrate and hexamethylene bisacetamide and the inhibitory effects of hexamethylene bisacetamide on amine biosynthesis warrant evaluation of these agents or analogues for treatment of metastatic carcinoid and gastrinoma.\r"

Eight of 10 malignant effusions/media suppressed the induction of lymphokine-activated killer cell cytotoxicity, as measured in a 4-hour sodium chromate release assay. Seven of 10 effusions/media inhibited lymphokine-activated killer cell proliferation. Suppression was both dose and time dependent. A representative suppressive effusion was fractionated by agarose gel chromatography, treated with detergents disruptive of ionic bonds and lipids, and refractionated using polyacrylamide gel chromatography. Seven suppressive fractions ranging in molecular weight from 1 x 10(5) to 3 x 10(5) d were isolated. It is speculated that this suppressor factor may represent a large multimeric structure with ionic-bonded individual suppressive components.\r"

Scan results indicated that 28 of 32 confirmed metastatic sites were imaged with this technique (88% sensitivity). Analysis of the individual positive sites revealed that nodal basins and visceral metastases accounted for the highest percentage of metastatic sites imaged, with 14 (88%) of 16 nodal basin metastases and all four visceral metastases being detected through imaging. Occult nodal disease was detected in the iliac nodal chain in two of the 29 patients. The imaging of benign tumors and nodal basins not containing disease accounted for a confirmed false-positive rate of 21%. Three (10%) of the 29 scan results were confirmed to be false-negative. In vivo tumor localization with monoclonal antibodies showed a sensitivity similar to that of other roentgenographic procedures for identifying metastatic disease and was useful in two of three patients in identifying occult iliac nodal disease, a region that is difficult to evaluate with physical examination and other imaging modalities.\r"

Melanoma arising in skin of the upper part of the back, back of the arms, neck, and scalp (BANS) region occurred more frequently in male than female patients. There were no statistically significant differences in the distribution of Clark's level of invasion of BANS and non-BANS region primary melanomas or in the extent of nodal involvement in patients with stage II disease. The 5-year actuarial survival of patients with stage I BANS region melanomas was 87%; stage I non-BANS, 89%; stage II BANS, 38%; and stage II non-BANS, 69%. The BANS region appears to have prognostic significance in cutaneous melanoma and, particularly, in patients with stage II melanoma.\r"

Three specimens were cytologically unsatisfactory and 86 yielded benign findings, while material suggestive or diagnostic of malignancy was obtained from 25 specimens.

The expediency and the quality of the surgical act in a variety of surgical diseases have a positive effect on the immune system. Indeed, the data indicate that correction of shock, drainage of infection, excision or drainage of necrotic material, restoration of body composition, and solid basic care all have a positive influence on patients' immune responses. An immunomodulator might get credit if the role of surgical care is not properly assessed. A framework for the study of immunomodulators with the integration of clinical behavior is outlined.\r"

Scar elasticity was increased after both 1 and 2 months compared with that in controls. There was corresponding improvement clinically that persisted for at least 6 months. In the other cohort, scar volume changes in 21 surgical incisions were measured before and after 1 and 2 months. Gel-treated incisions gained less volume than control incisions after both intervals. Clinical assessment corroborated this quantitative demonstration of a decrement in scar volume.

In addition, 36 of these patients also underwent revascularization via an extra-anatomic bypass. We analyzed the early and long-term results with respect to survival, limb salvage, freedom from infection, and extra-anatomic graft patency. The 30-day mortality was 24% (11/45), and the amputation rate was 11% (8/73). During a mean follow-up of 36 months (range, 2 to 144 months), 80% (24/30) of the patients remained free of infection and are considered cured. Infection in the extra-anatomic bypass graft was the most common cause of recurrent sepsis and the leading cause of late amputations (four of seven). By life-table methods, 1-year survival was 63% and 5-year survival was 49%. Limb salvage rates at 1 and 5 years were 79% and 66%, respectively. The primary patency rate of extra-anatomic bypass was 43% at 3 years, with the secondary patency rate improved to 65%. These early and late results are in marked contrast to the natural history of untreated aortic graft infection. Nonetheless, a perioperative mortality rate of 24%, a 5-year limb loss rate of 33%, and 3-year graft thrombosis rate of 35% are testimony to the serious nature of aortic graft infection and the need to develop better methods to prevent this complication.\r"

DESIGN--Replacement of an existing system of regularly spaced appointments at 10 minute intervals with one in which the doctor arranged appointments according to his perception of individual patients' requirements, from December 1988 to June 1989. SETTING--One general medical outpatient clinic. PATIENTS--All (181) [corrected] patients under regular review with fixed appointment times during six months; those arriving for blood testing before the start of the clinic and those requiring ambulance transport were excluded. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Mean waiting time (mean of difference between appointment time and start of consultation), maximum waiting time, number of patients, and total duration of clinics. RESULTS--Mean waiting time was reduced by about 30 minutes (from 39.6 to 9.5 mins) over the six months. There was no change in the number of patients attending (mean 15.8 v 15.4) or the duration of the clinics (mean 187 v 160 mins). CONCLUSION--Efficiency was improved by simple adjustment to the appointments system used in the hospital outpatient clinic.\r"

  ".W": "Renin secretion by the kidney is inhibited by an increase in free intracellular calcium concentration. This increase in free intracellular calcium content may be augmented by serum 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D. In 10 subjects with high renin hypertension, an increase in dietary sodium intake resulted in an increase in urinary calcium excretion (2.5 to 3.4 mmol/L, P = .011) and an increase in serum 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (51.2 to 61.0 pmol/L, P = .045). An inverse correlation existed between the change in vitamin D and the change in plasma renin activity (r = -0.765, P = .01). An inverse correlation also existed between the change in plasma renin activity and the change in mean arterial blood pressure (r = -0.757, P = .011). It is postulated that the increase in dietary sodium led to an increase in serum 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D concentration, which may have contributed to an increase in intracellular calcium concentration, a decrease in renal secretion of renin, and a fall in plasma renin activity. The resultant fall in PRA in part effected the change in blood pressure to the increased sodium intake. Therefore, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D may be a mediator in the response of high renin hypertension to increased sodium intake.\r"

There was an inverse relationship between plasma ionized calcium and blood pressure (P = .002), whereas albumin-modified total serum calcium was directly related to blood pressure (P = .02). The plasma cyclic AMP level (P = .05) and the 24 h urinary excretion of cyclic AMP (P = .03) were also positively associated with blood pressure. Patients with vascular retinopathy had lower plasma ionized calcium concentrations (P = .01) and higher 24 h urinary cyclic AMP excretions (P = .05) than those without such changes, even when the differences in blood pressure, age, sex and body mass index were taken into account in analyses of covariance. Plasma renin activity did not interfere with the relationships between calcium metabolic indices and blood pressure, nor were there any associations between the renin status and the calcium metabolic indices. These findings suggest that a low concentration of plasma ionized calcium is an independent risk factor for vascular disease.\r"

Nineteen-year-old men with similarly elevated mean blood pressure at a medical screening, but without knowledge of this, were randomized into two groups. The first group (n = 16) was sent a letter saying that their pressure was too high, and the second (n = 13) was sent a neutral letter. Information increased mean blood pressure both after 15 min sitting, by an average of 11.5 mm Hg (P less than .01), and after 30 min supine rest, by an average of 4.5 mm Hg (P less than .05). Changes in heart rate (8.4 +/- 2.4 v 1.9 +/- 1.7 beats/min) and plasma epinephrine (0.11 +/- 0.04 v 0.01 +/- 0.03 nmol/L) during execution of a cold pressor test were significantly greater in the informed group (P less than .05). Plasma dopamine was lower in the informed group (P less than .05). Thus, psychological stress caused by the awareness of hypertension may increase blood pressure and sympathetic responses to a provocative maneuver. Ideally, studies on sympathetic function in essential hypertension should be undertaken on subjects unaware of their blood pressure status.\r"

Before captopril administration, RVR ratio was less than 1.5 in 8 patients (36.4%) with renovascular hypertension and all patients (100%) with EHT. Captopril enhanced the lateralization of renal vein renin in renovascular hypertension; the postcaptopril RVR ratio was greater than 2.0 in 18 patients (81.8%) and greater than 1.5 in all the patients (100%). On the other hand, RVR ratio remained unchanged in most patients with EHT. There was no significant difference in the postcaptopril RVR ratios between URVH and BRVH. However, the postcaptopril RVR ratio was higher in atherosclerosis (10 patients) than in fibromuscular dysplasia (11 patients) (P less than .05). Captopril also elucidated contralateral renin suppression as expressed by a contralateral/peripheral renin ratio of less than 1.0, which was associated with a favorable outcome of unilateral surgical intervention. Captopril-stimulated RVR indices were valuable in detecting the functionally significant renal artery stenosis and predicting surgical curability in renovascular hypertension.\r"

We studied platelets of spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR), normotensive Wistar-Kyoto (WKY), and domestic Wistar rats (DWR), since platelets have similarities to smooth muscle cells and have been shown to have potentially related ion metabolism abnormalities, such as increased intracellular calcium activity. We determined the exchange rate by the intracellular acidification-dependent, extracellular sodium-dependent volume increase. The rate of increase during the first 3 min is linear and is shown to be higher in SHR (0.475 X min-1) than in WKY (0.410 X min-1) or DWR (0.389 X min-1). We conclude that the Na-H activity is increased in platelets of SHR. Similar findings in lymphocytes and neutrophils of SHR, and analogous findings in platelets of humans with essential hypertension, suggest that this abnormality is expressed by several cell types, some of which may be involved in the pathophysiology of genetic hypertension in both rats and humans.\r"

Hypotonic medium (150 mOsm) increased initial rates of ouabain and bumetanide-resistant (OBR) Rb+ uptake by 100%, bumetanide and DIDS-resistant Cl- uptake by 200%, and OBR net K+ efflux by 130%. DIOA inhibited 40 to 100% of the Rb+ influx and net K+ efflux stimulation with an IC50 of 4 X 10(-5) mol/L. DIOA-sensitive Rb+ influx was a sigmoidal function of the decrease in osmolarity, with a threshold at about 230 mOsm. Our results suggest that vascular smooth muscle cells have a DIOA-sensitive [K+,Cl-]-cotransport system. Dissipation of the outwardly directed Cl- gradient with an apparent [Cl- to K+] stoichiometry much higher than one may provide the energy to ensure net KCl (and osmotic water) extrusion and cell volume regulation in these cells.\r"

Consequently, only patients of the passive group showed a significant day-night difference in BP and a significant circadian rhythm of BP as well.

Subclinical elevation of urinary albumin excretion is seen more frequently than clinical proteinuria in essential hypertension and the levels of microalbuminuria (excretions of 30 to 300 mg/24 h) correlate with blood pressure. The increased urinary albumin excretion in hypertension may be explained by several factors such as renal hemodynamic changes, permselectivity changes of the glomerular filter, and structural arteriolar and glomerular changes due to nephrosclerosis. It has been clearly demonstrated that microalbuminuria is a risk factor for the development of clinical proteinuria, renal failure and increased cardiovascular mortality in insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. It is still not known whether microalbuminuria also predicts development of proteinuria and decline in renal function in hypertension but there is some evidence indicating that microalbuminuria may be a marker of increased cardiovascular risk in hypertensives.\r"

Since their plasma renin levels were normal or subnormal, renin in the vascular tissue was considered to play a key role in the maintenance of the hypertension. To clarify the source and localization of renin in SHR, antirenin antibodies, the converting enzyme inhibitors delapril, enalapril, and the Ang II receptor antagonist DuP 753 were administered to intact and bilaterally nephrectomized SHR and their normotensive controls. The efficient hypotensive action of the renin antibody indicated that renin of renal origin is a dominant factor. Gradual but complete disappearance of antihypertensive action of these inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin system upon bilateral nephrectomy indicated the importance of membrane-associated renin of the renal origin and angiotensin converting enzyme in the maintenance of the spontaneous hypertension.\r"

These ischemic nephrons, responding individually to their perception of underperfusion, secrete renin. In response, the normal nephrons are in adaptive natriuresis and have appropriately shut off their renin production. Nevertheless, they are affected adversely by the discordant renin-angiotensin II arising from the ischemic nephrons' presence, which exerts an unwanted sodium-retaining effect on the proximal tubules of the adapting nephrons. The end result is elevated blood pressure from too much sodium retention for the level of renin activity, that is, an abnormal renin-sodium product. Thus, \"normal\" renin levels in a hypertensive individual are abnormal because healthy kidneys shut off renin production entirely when blood pressure rises. This construction explains why angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition often corrects \"normal\" renin hypertension. Although such hypertension may be partly sodium-mediated as a consequence of inappropriate sodium retention by the normal and ischemic nephrons, the source of the problem lies in the renin production from ischemic nephrons. The correct treatment, then, is an antirenin therapy designed to block renin synthesis or secretion or angiotensin II formation or action. In view of modern studies suggesting that renin excesses also correlate with an increased risk of heart attack and stroke, the role of antirenin and antiangiotensin agents in treatment assumes additional relevance.\r"

Delapril effectively inhibits rabbit lung ACE activity and lowers blood pressure in spontaneously hypertensive rats. Delapril has several characteristics that differ from captopril and enalapril, including high lipophilicity and weak bradykinin potentiating action. Delapril is a more potent inhibitor of vascular wall ACE activity than enalapril or captopril. It also shows a weaker potentiating action on the citric acid-induced cough in the guinea pig model compared with captopril and enalapril. In 12 out of 150 patients with essential hypertension who complained of cough during treatment with enalapril, changing to delapril resulted in resolution of the cough in 6 out of 12 of these patients: the percentage of patients in the total population with cough decreased from 8% to 4%.\r"

When the effect of twice-a-day administration of delapril at daily doses of 30 to 90 mg was examined using the indirect monitoring system in 12 outpatients, delapril decreased systolic and diastolic arterial pressures significantly only at limited points during the day. However, each of the averaged 24 h daytime and nighttime arterial pressures showed significant reductions. The 24 h intraarterial pressure monitoring demonstrated that delapril decreased systolic and diastolic arterial pressure at most of the measurement points. The arterial pressure reductions during daytime and nighttime were not significantly different, that is, there was no excessive reduction in nighttime arterial pressure. Heart rate and its variability were virtually unaffected by the delapril treatment in either monitoring study. No adverse reactions were observed in the indirect or direct monitoring studies. Thus, it is concluded that twice-a-day administration of delapril at daily doses of 30 to 90 mg brings about a safe and stable antihypertensive effect, without affecting the diurnal variation of arterial pressure.\r"

At the end of a 2 week initial placebo period, the diastolic blood pressure of these patients ranged from 95 to 115 mm Hg in the sitting position. After this placebo period, randomization took place. Patients in the delapril group received 15 mg of the drug twice daily. Treatment with enalapril was started with a daily dose of 10 mg. If the diastolic blood pressure did not fall to less than or equal to 90 mm Hg or at least by 15 mm Hg after 2 weeks of treatment, the doses of the ACE inhibitors were doubled. After another 2 weeks, 25 mg hydrochlorothiazide daily was added if the target level of diastolic blood pressure was not reached. Both drugs caused a similar decrease of systolic and diastolic blood pressure. The antihypertensive effect of both ACE inhibitors was increased by the addition of the diuretic. The frequency and severity of side effects were similar in the two groups of patients. It is concluded from this study that delapril and enalapril do not differ in antihypertensive efficacy nor in safety.\r"

  ".W": "Delapril, a new angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor discovered in the laboratory of Takeda Chemical Industries, Ltd., is the result of drug design based on the structure-activity relationships of ACE inhibitors. Delapril is an antihypertensive agent with a relatively long duration of action and no SH moiety in its structure. Following administration, it is converted into two active metabolites. Delapril effectively lowered blood pressure in 73% of 1,008 patients with hypertension during clinical trials in Japan. Efficacy rates were 73% for essential hypertension, 85% for renal hypertension, and 80% for renovascular hypertension. Excellent hypotensive response was observed in all age groups, from young to elderly patients. Side effects during administration of delapril, based on subjective evidence, were reported in 80 out of the 1,008 cases (7.9%). The main symptoms included orthostatic dizziness (1.7%), dizziness (1.3%), and nausea (1.1%). Dry cough, which has attracted attention in recent years as a side effect of ACE inhibitors, was reported at a low incidence of 1.1%. In a double-blind, controlled study in patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension in which captopril served as a positive control, delapril showed superior hypotensive effect and greater safety. Data derived from the Japan Study Group on Delapril indicate that this ACE inhibitor has excellent hypotensive effects and a high level of safety. It is suitable as a first-line drug in both monotherapy and combined therapy.\r"

Two groups of 7 normal subjects (single dose study: 15 mg delapril v 18.75 mg captopril or 2.5 mg enalapril) and a group of 6 mildly hypertensive patients (1 week study: cross-over administration of 30 mg/day delapril, 37.5 mg/day captopril, or 5 mg/day enalapril) were studied. Another group of 6 patients with essential hypertension was treated with three ACE inhibitors for 4 weeks in a randomized order, with a 2 week washout period between active therapies. Aerosols of 1 mumol/L and 3 mumol/L capsaicin and 0.68% citric acid in 0.9% NaCl were generated by an ultrasonic nebulizer, and the frequency of cough was counted during inhalation. Delapril treatment resulted in substantially fewer patients with a significant increase (greater than or equal to 4 coughs during treatment than during the control period) in the frequency of cough than did captopril treatment. In the 1 and 4 week studies, enalapril and captopril had substantially more occurrences of significantly increased capsaicin-induced cough than did delapril. These results indicate that delapril has the least cough stimulatory effect among these ACE inhibitors, which may be clinically beneficial.\r"

There was a significant (P less than .05) increase in renal blood flow (RBF) without affecting glomerular filtration rate. Filtration fraction increased, while renal vascular resistance decreased. There were also significant (P less than .05) increases in urinary kallikrein and prostaglandin excretion, while thromboxane excretion decreased. There was no change in urinary aldosterone excretion. These results suggest that renal hemodynamic changes seen during long-term therapy with delapril are caused, in part, by activation of the kallikrein-prostaglandin system, as well as suppression of the renin-angiotensin system.\r"

By comparison, captopril significantly (P less than .01) increased cGMP concentrations. Only captopril showed a significant (P less than .01) effect on 45Ca kinetics in cultured human vascular endothelial cells. Captopril also decreased PGI2 generation in vascular endothelial cells. These effects were not seen with delapril or enalapril. The significance of the SH moiety in ACE inhibitors remains controversial. However, these results suggest that there could be differences in the vascular actions of ACE inhibitors related to the presence or absence of SH radical.\r"

  ".W": "Accumulating evidence suggests an important role of vascular renin-angiotensin system (RAS) in the local control of arterial tone. To further gain insight into the significance of vascular RAS in hypertension, we investigated the relationship between the antihypertensive action of delapril, a newly developed converting enzyme inhibitor (CEI), and its effects on vascular angiotensin II (Ang II) release in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). Male SHRs were given delapril or its active metabolite (5-hydroxydelapril diacid; 5-hydroxy-DPD) orally (10 mg/kg/day) for 2 weeks. Isolated hind legs of these rats were perfused with angiotensinogen-free Krebs-Ringer solution, and Ang II released into the perfusate was directly determined by extraction with Sep-Pak C18 cartridges connected to the perfusion system. Both delapril and 5-hydroxy-DPD produced a sustained antihypertensive action. The spontaneous release of Ang II from isolated perfused hind legs of control SHRs was about 50 to 110 pg during the first 30 min of perfusion, and it remained stable up to 3 h. Another active metabolite, delapril diacid (DPD), when added to the perfusion medium (10(-9) to 5 x 10(-5) mol/L), suppressed the Ang II release in a dose-dependent manner. The maximal percent inhibition of Ang II released evoked by DPD (5 x 10(-6) mol/L) was approximately 51%. Oral pretreatment of either delapril or 5-hydroxy-DPD for 2 weeks suppressed the Ang II release by 61% and 73% for delapril and 5-hydroxy-DPD, respectively. These results suggest the presence of a functional RAS in vascular tissues, and that delapril exerts its antihypertensive effect through inhibition of vascular Ang II release in SHRs.\r"

To further investigate the mechanism by which Ang II is generated in the blood vessels of humans, we examined the effects of various inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin system (captopril, delapril, N-acetyl-pepstatin, and human renin inhibitor KRI-1314) on Ang II release from perfused human umbilical cord veins in vitro. Isolated human umbilical veins were perfused with Krebs-Ringer solution, and immunoreactive Ang II released into the perfusate was measured directly by using a Sep-Pak C18 cartridge connected to the perfusion system. Both captopril and delapril diacid (10(-9) to 5 x 10(-6) mol/L), an active metabolite of delapril hydrochloride, suppressed the Ang II release in a dose-dependent fashion; the maximal percent suppression of Ang II release evoked by these inhibitors (5 x 10(-6) mol/L) was 56% and 64%, respectively, for captopril and delapril. Both N-acetyl-pepstatin (10(-9) to 10(-5) mol/L) and KRI-1314 (10(-9) to 10(-6) mol/L) suppressed Ang II release in a dose-related manner. At a 10(-6) mol/L concentration, KRI-1314 produced a 74% reduction in the basal rate of Ang II release, and a reduction threefold greater than the maximal reduction in basal Ang II release produced by N-acetyl-pepstatin.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

However, acute renal deterioration may occur in some conditions in association with the crucial role of angiotensin in the regulation of glomerular filtration rate (GFR), such as volume depletion, severe stenosis of both renal arteries, and stenosis of a single functioning kidney. CEI-induced acute renal failure can develop in the absence of a fall in systemic pressure, is facilitated by prior sodium depletion, and is reversible upon discontinuation of treatment. In a personal study conducted in 28 patients with CEI-induced renal dysfunction (reversible after discontinuation of CEI), the incidence of stenosis of large renal vessels was 61%, whereas 39% of these subjects had no significant renal artery abnormalities. Although the occurrence of such a complication is not a convincingly accurate predictor of the existence of renovascular hypertension, angiographic detection of renal artery stenosis (bilateral or on a single-functioning kidney) may be justified in some of these patients.\r"

It is not new but has only relatively recently become a parameter to be measured in patients treated for cardiovascular disease. Lessons can be learned from other conditions in which the Karnovsky Index and the Arthritis Impact Measurement Scale have been used. Several investigators have used questionnaires to assess quality of life during antihypertensive therapy. However, assessment of the effect of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition on quality of life has only been done recently. The largest and best known study, of 625 white men with mild hypertension, reported that patients given captopril showed a significant improvement after 6 months in general well-being, work performance, and those skills associated with cognitive function. No such improvement was found with methyldopa and there was significant worsening in measures associated with depression, sexual dysfunction, and life satisfaction. The propranolol group, while showing improvement in cognitive functioning and social participation, manifested worsening of sexual function and physical symptoms. Diuretic therapy had a greater negative impact on the quality of life of hypertensive patients than captopril, propranolol, or methyldopa alone. Whether these results will be seen in other patient populations, and the pharmacological basis for these results, remains to be determined. As newer agents become available (eg, beta-blockers with ancillary properties, calcium channel blockers with allegedly more selective actions on various vascular beds), comparative studies between these agents and ACE inhibitors old and new are awaited with interest.\r"

This report describes the presentation and rehabilitative course of a 31-yr-old man with quadriparesis secondary to spinal cord sarcoidosis. The patient had insidious, progressive weakness in his arms and legs for six weeks before evaluation. Examination revealed a C4 incomplete spinal cord injury. Computed tomography demonstrated an intrinsic cord lesion from the brainstem to approximately T8. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) suggested the lesion was granulomatous and cervical laminectomy confirmed noncaseating granulomas. The patient was started on high dose steroids, subsequently gained strength in the distal upper extremities, and was sent for spinal cord rehabilitation. Examination revealed 3 to 4+/5 strength in the upper extremities, 2- to 3-/5 in the lower extremities. The right side was slightly stronger than the left, with proximal musculature stronger than distal. Sensory examination was intact except in the C-8 to T-2 dermatomes. The patient was dependent in self-care and mobility except for feeding. Initial progress was inhibited by severe spasticity requiring medication, but by discharge he was independent at the wheelchair level with 4/5 strength in all four extremities except for his hands, which had 3/5 strength. Sensory exam did not change. Follow-up MRI studies revealed reduction of the lesion. Review of previous cases revealed that myelopathy is the most common presenting complaint and cervical segments are most commonly involved. Survival averaged almost three years and significant gains were made in functional status. Rehabilitative course and special considerations, treatment and follow-up recommendations are discussed.\r"

VPT measurements were made using a \"two-alternative, forced-choice\" method in which the patient is required to identify which of the two rods is vibrating at progressively decreasing vibration intensities. VPTs correlated significantly with nerve conduction velocities in all upper and lower extremity sensory and motor nerves tested, and with the amplitudes of the evoked motor responses in three motor nerves: median and ulnar (motor components) and tibial. For the median and ulnar nerves (motor components) the amplitudes of the evoked motor responses were more sensitive than nerve conduction velocities in correlation with VPTs. Comparison of VPT values, based upon whether or not evoked sensory and motor responses were obtained, indicated that mean VPTs were consistently higher among subjects in whom these evoked responses were not elicited. VPT measurements is thus shown to be a valid and valuable method for evaluation of severity in peripheral neuropathy. It has the advantages of being simple, quick and painless. Patient cooperation and compliance with this form of testing are excellent.\r"

  ".W": "This study documents the types and degree of disability seen in persons with AIDS at discharge from acute hospitalization. Based on 37 discharge evaluations using the Functional Independence Measure (FIM), 60% required human assistance in at least one of 18 FIM areas. Thirty-two percent required human assistance in five or more areas. Fifty-one and 38% required human assistance in stair climbing and ambulation, respectively. Feeding and bathing required assistance in about 33% and transferring to tub or shower in 25% of the sample. Increasing disability was associated with longer duration of AIDS diagnosis and increasing lengths of hospital stay (P less than 0.01 and P less than 0.05, respectively). There were individuals who remained nearly functionally independent up to 30 months after an AIDS defining event. The overall variability in function, however, was not significantly different between those with diagnoses less than and greater than 12 months. We conclude that significant physical disability exists in persons with AIDS at discharge from acute hospitalization. Consultation with and intervention by rehabilitation professionals may be helpful in the management of physical disability in this population and setting.\r"

Two types of abnormal SEP patterns were found in six patients. Two patients had the SEP pattern of peripheral neuropathy, which was also detected by peripheral sensory nerve conduction studies. Four patients had abnormal SEPs seen in patients with the lesions in the central nervous system (dorsal column, medial lemniscus). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed multiple sclerosis (MS). It is possible that clinically diagnosed OPCA sometimes includes a similar form of Friedreich's ataxia with subclinical sensory fiber neuropathy detected by SEPs and peripheral sensory conduction studies. In cases of lesions in the central nervous system demonstrated by both SEPs and MRI, there must be a follow-up in order to make a final diagnosis. In those cases, an alternative diagnosis of MS must be considered when the temporal profile of symptoms and signs characteristic of MS is observed.\r"

Here we report Southern blotting analysis of 26 APLs, including cases with normal karyotypes and atypical morphology, which showed RAR-alpha rearrangements in 92% cases, myl rearrangements in 73%, and either RAR-alpha or myl rearrangements in 100%. Despite a negative clinical and morphologic picture, DNA rearrangement analysis showed that neoplastic promyelocytes persisted in the bone marrow of two patients sampled after induction chemotherapy. Therefore, the RAR-alpha and myl rearrangements provide molecular markers for accurately diagnosing APLs and monitoring the course of the disease during and after chemotherapy.\r"

  ".W": "Eighty-one patients with acute myeloid leukemia (ANLL, n = 44) or acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL, n = 37), aged 10 to 50 years were randomized to receive 1 mg/kg per day (n = 41, group A) or 5 mg/kg per day (n = 40, group B) of cyclosporine A (CyA) from day -1 to day +20 after bone marrow transplant (BMT). All patients received CyA orally thereafter. All patients were prepared with cyclophosphamide (CY) 120 mg/kg and fractionated total body irradiation (TBI), and received unfractionated BM from an HLA-identical sibling. The two groups were comparable for diagnosis, disease status, French-American-British (FAB) classification, WBC count at diagnosis, cytogenetic abnormalities, extramedullary disease before BMT, donor/recipient age and sex, number of cells infused, and number of days with intravenous (IV) CyA. Median follow-up for surviving patients in group A was 983 v 632 days in group B. Patients in group A had lower serum levels of CyA (295 v 686 ng/mL, P = .004), lower bilirubin levels (1.9 v 2.6 mg/dL, P = .07), lower creatinine levels (0.9 v 1.4 mg/dL, P = .06), and a lower proportion of CD8+ cells in the peripheral blood (PB) within day +21 (19% v 28%, P = .07). First day to 0.5 x 10(9)/L neutrophils was comparable in the two groups (13 v 14 days; P = .1). In a Cox model, the actuarial risk of acute graft-v-host disease (GVHD) grade II+, after stratification for age (less than 20 years greater than) was significantly lower in group B patients (0.54, P = .04). The actuarial risk of developing chronic GVHD was comparable (P = .9). Actuarial transplant-related mortality (TRM) at 240 days was 28% and 26% (P = .8) in group A and B: the major cause of death was GVHD in group A (P = .02) and multiorgan toxicity in group B (P = .07). The actuarial risk of relapse at 2 years overall was 20% in group A and 52% in group B (P = .001); it was 9% v 43%, respectively, for patients in first remission (P = .0001) and 48% v 63% for patients in non-first complete remission (CR) (P = .1). Actuarial 2-year disease-free survival (DFS) in group A and B was 58% v 32% (P = .02) for all patients, 71% v 35% (P = .01), in first remissions, and 30% v 23% (P = .2) in advanced disease.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".U": "91183160\r", 
  ".W": "Seventy consecutive adult patients with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), median age 44 years, received high-dose cytarabine (3 g/m2 every 12 hours for 12 doses) followed by daunorubicin (45 mg/m2 daily for three doses) for remission induction. A single, identical course was planned for postremission therapy. Complete remission (CR) was achieved in 63 patients (90%, 95% confidence interval [CI] 83% to 97%), 60 after a single course. Eight patients were selected to undergo elective bone marrow transplantation (BMT) during first CR. Of the remaining 55 patients, 40 (73%) underwent planned post-CR therapy; 15 patients did not, owing to early relapse, excessive toxicity from the induction chemotherapy, or refusal. Nineteen patients, including 13 who received planned post-CR therapy, remain in continuous CR at a median follow-up of 5.2 years (range 3.0 to 7.1 years). The 5-year actuarial leukemia-free survival was 30% (95% Cl, 19% to 42%) for all patients achieving CR and 32% (95% Cl, 19% to 47%) for the 40 patients who received the planned post-CR chemotherapy. Analysis of various putative prognostic factors for CR and overall and leukemia-free survival showed significance for a previous history of myelodysplasia, higher initial leukocyte counts, certain French-American-British (FAB) types, and certain abnormal karyotypes. None of these factors was consistently significant regarding the above parameters, although small patient numbers in certain analyses may have obscured significant associations. Myelosuppression was occasionally prolonged after remission induction and especially post-CR therapy. Severe cerebellar toxicity was observed in 13 patients; in 11 cases, this toxicity was fully reversible. Other serious complications were infrequent. Intensive chemotherapy with high-dose cytarabine and daunorubicin has substantial antileukemic activity in adult AML, and may represent an improvement over conventional therapy. Relapses were common, however, even in patients who received planned therapy, and substantial toxicity was observed. The optimum use of this regimen in AML remains to be determined.\r"

  ".U": "91183163\r", 
  ".W": "The physiologically active form of vitamin D, 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D3 [1,25(OH)2D3], was found to inhibit erythroid differentiation of human leukemic K562 cells. Differentiation was induced by 1 mumol/L arabinocytosine (Ara-C), 40 mumol/L tiazofurin, 1 mumol/L aphidicolin, or 1 mumol/L hydroxyurea, and was monitored daily by the appearance of hemoglobin in an increasing proportion of cells. Pretreatment for 48 hours with 2.4 x 10(-8) mol/L 1,25(OH)2D3, a concentration that is also optimal for induction of monocytic differentiation of HL-60 cells, reproducibly inhibited subsequent induction of erythroid differentiation by all of the above inducers, and modified the morphologic changes that Ara-C produced in these cells. The inhibition of hemoglobinization was approximately 50% irrespective of the degree of differentiation produced by the various inducers, but growth inhibition associated with exposure to the inducers was not affected by 1,25(OH)2D3. Similar inhibition of differentiation by 1,25(OH)2D3 was observed in mouse erythroleukemia cells MEL-D1B treated with 5 mmol/L hexamethylenebisacetamide. The inhibitory effect of 1,25(OH)2D3 on erythroid differentiation of K562 cells was abrogated by cyclohexamide (20 micrograms/mL), an inhibitor of protein synthesis. The mRNA for 1,25(OH)2D3 receptor (VDR) was detected in K562 cells, and was downregulated by a 96-hour exposure to 1,25(OH)2D3 or a 48-hour exposure to Ara-C. The presence of VDR mRNA suggests a physiologic role for 1,25(OH)2D3 in K562 cells that are precursors of erythroid cells. This role is perhaps to shift the pathways of differentiation from the erythroid to the monocytic lineage.\r"

We examined the effects of recombinant human interleukin-5 (IL-5) and other human cytokines in vitro on myeloid colony formation in methylcellulose and on alkaline passaged HL-60 basophilic cell differentiation. Myeloid colonies (CFU-C) at day 14, formed in the presence of either IL-3, IL-5, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), or G-CSF included peripheral blood-derived progenitors of the eosinophil/basophil lineage. IL-5 stimulated a greater proportion of basophil-containing, histamine-positive, eosinophil-type colonies compared with GM-CSF, IL-3, or G-CSF. IL-5 also stimulated dose-dependent increases in histamine content of alkaline-passaged, butyrate cotreated HL-60 cells. The concentration of IL-5 required for half-maximal induction of HL-60 histamine content was similar within twofold to that needed for half-maximal stimulation of the multifactor dependent TF-1 erythroleukemic cell line. Neutralizing rat monoclonal antibodies to human IL-5 were developed and used to demonstrate that each of these IL-5 bioactivities could be specifically blocked. We conclude that in addition to its previously described eosinophil differentiation activity, IL-5 may be considered a basophilopoietin.\r"

An antifibrinogen monoclonal antibody (MoAb) (antibody 1D4/xl-f), directed against an epitope in the A alpha-chain C-terminal region (A alpha 241-476), bound to 35% of the epitope in crosslinked fibrin clots and 37% of the same epitope in factor XIII-induced fibrinogen gel networks. A different MoAb (4-2/xl-f, anti gamma 392-406) bound to only 7% of the epitope in both fibrin and fibrinogen gels. As expected, an antifibrin MoAb (antibody T2G1, antiB beta 15-21) did not bind to fibrinogen gels, but bound to fibrin, although to only 14% of the available T2G1-reactive epitopes. An antibody that does not recognize fibrin (antibody 1-8C6, antiB beta 1-21) predictably did not bind to fibrin clots and bound to 35% of the 1-8C6 epitopes present in fibrinogen gels, a level of binding also observed with antibody T2G1 and fibrinogen gels only after the latter were treated with thrombin. T2G1 epitope expression was affected much more than 1D4/xl-f epitope expression in clots formed in buffers of high or low ionic strength, conditions known to influence clot structure. Studies on the availability, in quantitative terms, of the T2G1-reactive epitope in fibrin clots is of particular importance because this antibody is currently being used in clinical trials as a clot imaging agent.\r"

However, the molecular pathogenesis of type IIB vWD remains unresolved and, with the complex posttranslational processing required for fully functional vWF, the mutations responsible for this phenotype may occur at loci other than the vWF gene. This study has used six intragenic vWF polymorphisms to assess the linkage of type IIB vWD to this gene in three families (48 individuals). The results of these studies indicate that there is significant linkage between the vWF gene and the type IIB phenotype (logarithm of the odds ratio of 7.2 at theta = 0), suggesting that the mutations responsible for this disorder frequently occur at this locus. Results from one of these families indicates that the disorder has been transmitted from an unaffected parent to two children who have inherited the same vWF gene as seven unaffected siblings. This finding is suggestive of the presence of germinal mosaicism for the mutation in the father.\r"

In the present study, we analyzed the structures of O-glycans attached to leukosialin present in various T-lymphocytic leukemia cells. T-lymphoid cells from patients with acute T-lymphocytic leukemia express a large amount of the branched hexasaccharides, NeuNAc alpha 2----3Gal beta 1----3(NeuNAc alpha 2----3Gal beta 1----4GlcNAc beta 1----6)GalNAc, which are also expressed in activated normal T lymphocytes, but that are almost absent in resting normal T lymphocytes. T-lymphoid cells from patients with chronic T-lymphocytic leukemia, on the other hand, mainly express the tetrasaccharides NeuNAc alpha 2----3Gal beta 1----3(NeuNAc alpha 2----6)GalNAc on leukosialin, but they also express a small significant amount of the hexasaccharides. The same hexasaccharides can be detected in thymocytes. The increased amount of the hexasaccharides in acute leukemia is associated with increased activity of beta 1----6 GlcNAc-transferase, a key enzyme in forming the hexasaccharides. Immunoblot analysis of cell lysates showed that monoclonal antibody (MoAb) T-305 reacts preferentially with leukosialin of high mol wt containing the hexasaccharides. These findings indicate that T-lymphocytic leukemia cells reexpress the oligosaccharides present in immature cells.\r"

  ".W": "Heterogeneity of p53 protein expression is seen in blast cells of patients with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). p53 protein is detected in the blasts of certain AML patients but not in others. We have identified p53 protein variants with abnormal mobility on gel electrophoresis and/or prolonged half-life (t 1/2). We have sequenced the p53 coding sequence from primary blast cells of five AML patients and from the AML cell line (OCIM2). In OCIM2, a point mutation in codon 274 was identified that changes a valine residue to aspartic acid. A wild type p53 allele was not detected in these cells. Two point mutations (codon 135, cysteine to serine; codon 246, methionine to valine) were identified in cDNA from blasts of one AML patient. Both mutations were present in blast colonies grown from single blast progenitor cells, indicating that individual leukemia cells had sustained mutation of both p53 alleles. The cDNAs sequenced from blast samples of four other patients, including one with prolonged p53 protein t 1/2 and one with no detectable p53 protein, were fully wild type. Thus, the heterogeneity of p53 expression cannot be explained in all cases by genetic change in the p53 coding sequence. The prolonged t 1/2 of p53 protein seen in some AML blasts may therefore reflect changes not inherent to p53. A model is proposed in which mutational inactivation of p53, although not required for the evolution of neoplasia, would confer a selective advantage, favoring clonal outgrowth during disease progression.\r"

Correlations were made between clinical outcome and individual recurring cytogenetic aberrations, each of which was noted in greater than 5% of cases belonging to LG NHL and DLLC, and derived measures of karyotypic complexity, comprising modal chromosome number, number of marker chromosomes, and number of translocation breakpoints. No correlations with survival were noted in LG NHL, although median follow-up was only 2 years. Seven patients with t(8;14) LG NHL had an indolent course. Among 104 patients with DLLC and abnormal karyotypes at diagnosis, breaks at 1q21-23 or more than 4 marker chromosomes was associated with a shortened median survival. Using these variables we constructed a proportional hazards model with a good fit to observed data. Breaks at 6q21-25 predicted a decreased probability of achieving remission. Patients with DLLC and breaks at 1q21-23 or 1p32-36 had a shorter duration of complete remission. Of 41 DLLC studied at relapse, the only long-term survivors had t(14;18).\r"

  ".W": "We have examined, by Southern blotting, the patterns of chromosomal breakpoint locations in 55 cases of Burkitt's lymphoma (BL) with respect to geography and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) association. We have confirmed the association between chromosome 8 breakpoint and geography: 74% of endemic (eBL) but only 9% of sporadic BL (sBL) had breakpoints outside the HindIII fragment encompassing the c-myc gene (P2 less than .00001). Conversely, not only did 91% of sBL manifest a rearranged HindIII fragment, but at least 56% of these cases, in contrast to 17% of eBL cases, had a breakpoint within the first exon or intron of c-myc (P2 less than .004). Breakpoints outside the switch mu (S mu) region (ie, the HindIII fragment encompassing S mu) on chromosome 14 were twice as common overall (73%) as those within S mu (27%), but in the 15 tumors with S mu breakpoints, 13 (87%) had a rearranged c-myc gene. Breakpoints outside the HindIII fragment encompassing c-myc on chromosome 8 were predominantly associated with non-S mu breakpoints on chromosome 14 (85%) and this was the combination most frequently associated with eBL (65%; 6% of sBL, P2 less than .00001). In sBL, the most frequent breakpoint combination was a rearranged c-myc gene with a non-S mu breakpoint (63%; 13% of eBL). Twenty-eight percent of sBL and 13% of eBL had breakpoints both within c-myc and within S mu. EBV DNA was present in 19 of 20 tumors with breakpoints outside c-myc, in none of 7 with a breakpoint in the immediate 5' region of c-myc, in 4 of 5 tumors with breakpoints in the first exon, and in 7 of 12 tumors with breakpoints in the first intron. These data suggest that the pathogeneses of eBL and sBL differ with regard to the mechanism of c-myc deregulation, and probably also with regard to the state of differentiation of the target cell for malignant transformation. We have formulated a testable hypothesis regarding the potential role of EBV in pathogenesis: that it is required to contribute to the deregulation of c-myc in the presence of some, but not all, types of c-myc damage arising from the chromosomal translocations.\r"

  ".W": "Individuals infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) have an increased incidence of high-grade B-cell lymphoma. In many instances, these lymphomas contain Epstein-Barr viral (EBV) genomes. To investigate the role of EBV in development of HIV-related lymphoma, benign fixed lymph node biopsies from normal individuals and HIV-infected individuals with persistent generalized lymphadenopathy (PGL) were analyzed for EBV sequences by polymerase chain reaction and in situ DNA hybridization techniques. EBV DNA was not detected in any of 16 benign lymph node biopsies from normal individuals, but could be detected from 13 of 35 PGL biopsies. The EBV-infected cells were present in both follicular and interfollicular areas and in both small and large lymphoid cells. The presence of detectable amounts of EBV DNA in the 13 PGL biopsies was associated with an increased incidence of concurrent lymphoma at another site (n = 3) or development of lymphoma in time (n = 2). In contrast, only 1 of 22 individuals with EBV-negative PGL biopsies developed lymphoma in time (P less than .05). EBV was detected in all five lymphomas in which tissue was available for subsequent analysis, including the lymphoma that developed in the individual without EBV in his previous PGL biopsy. These findings support the hypothesis that EBV plays a role in development of some HIV-related lymphomas. Detectable EBV lymphoproliferations occur in a few PGL biopsies and are associated with a significant risk of EBV DNA-positive non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.\r"

  ".W": "Cells from 10 cases of childhood acute T-lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) were cultured in the presence of recombinant human interleukins (rhIL) or colony-stimulating factors (CSF) to analyze their growth factor requirements and differentiative potential. Although cells from most leukemic samples displayed a short-term proliferative response to several hematopoietic growth factors, only the ones featuring chromosomal translocations could be established as permanent cell lines. Two cell lines could be initiated only in the presence of IL-3 (TALL-103 and TALL-106), one in granulocyte-macrophage CSF (GM-CSF) (TALL-101), and one in IL-2 (TALL-104); only one cell line (TALL-105) was originated in the absence of growth factors. The TALL-101 and TALL-103 cell lines, derived from very immature T-ALL cases, underwent growth factor-dependent phenotypic conversion (lymphoid to myeloid). However, the T-cell receptor rearrangement and karyotype of the original leukemic clones were retained. In contrast, the TALL-104, -105, and -106 cell lines which originated from more mature T-ALL cases, maintained a T-lymphoblastic phenotype regardless of the growth factors in which they were expanded. These data demonstrate in vitro the aggressive nature of T-ALL cases bearing chromosomal abnormalities, and indicate that the lineage commitment of the malignant clone depends on its stage of maturation in T-cell ontogeny.\r"

  ".W": "In this study five monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs) to T-cell receptor (TCR) proteins (WT31, alpha F1, beta F1, TCR delta-1 and delta TCS-1) were used to identify discrete maturative stages in 40 cases of T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL). These MoAbs reacted exclusively with CD3+ T cells and did not label B-lineage and myeloid cells. In 17 of the 40 T-ALL cases studied the leukemic blasts lacked membrane and cytoplasmic TCR chains (group I). In 12 cases cells did not have membrane CD3/TCR but expressed cytoplasmic TCR proteins heterogenously: nine cases had cytoplasmic TCR beta chains (beta F1+, alpha F1-; group II), one case had cytoplasmic TCR alpha chains (alpha F1+, beta F1-; group III), and two cases were labeled by both alpha F1 and beta F1 MoAbs (group IV). The remaining 11 cases were mCD3+: nine were TCR alpha beta+ (group Va) and two exhibited TCR gamma delta (TCR delta-1+, delta TCS-1+; group Vb). The analysis of the TCR beta, -gamma, and -delta gene configurations in 23 of the 40 T-ALLs showed that: (1) the lack of TCR protein expression was due to the lack of TCR gene rearrangements only in one of nine cases; (2) five of five TCR beta+, TCR alpha- cases studied had germline TCR alpha genes (ie, no detectable TCR delta gene deletions); (3) seven of eight cases with TCR delta gene deletions expressed TCR alpha proteins, whereas in 12 of 20 of the T-ALLs with TCR beta gene rearrangements the synthesis of the corresponding protein occurred; only 2 of 16 cases with rearranged TCR delta genes expressed TCR delta chains. The T-ALL categories identified with anti-TCR MoAbs did not have additional characteristic phenotypic patterns and may correspond to the normal stages of T-cell development more precisely than those defined by other differentiation antigens.\r"

Eight cases had three or more rearranged JH bands, indicating oligoclonality, clonal evolution, or chromosomal translocation. One case had a rearrangement of the bcl-1 locus and three of the bcl-2 locus. In the first case, comigration of the rearranged bcl-1 and JH sequences indicated a t(11;14)(q13;q32) translocation, which, in contrast to previously described cases, seems to be completely reciprocal. One case with a bcl-2 rearrangement showed comigration of the bcl-2 major breakpoint region and a rearranged JH band. This indicates a t(14;18) (q32;q21). The two other cases showed rearrangements of the bcl-2 5' breakpoint region without apparent comigration. No rearrangements were detected of c-myc and bcl-3, located at chromosome 19, nor was a deletion of Rb found. All but three cases had CD5 expression. The exceptions included the t(11;14) and the t(14;18) cases. Our results confirm recent data on rearrangements at the 5' site of bcl-2 in CLL. Additionally, they corroborate the presumption that CD5-negative chronic B-cell leukemias should be considered apart from classical CLL.\r"

  ".W": "Intravital video microscopy was used to investigate leukocyte margination in 80 mesenteric venules (19 to 54 microns) of 50 anesthetized rabbits. After intravenous (IV) bolus injection, sulfated polysaccharides reduced in a reversible and dose-dependent way the number of leukocytes rolling slowly along the venular wall. The presence of sulfate groups is essential because other negatively charged or neutral polysaccharides had no effect. It was not caused by an increase in RBC velocity or chelation of divalent cations. Inhibition by sulfated dextrans (n = 7) was independent of molecular weight (mol wt 13,000 to 500,000) but was influenced by the average number of sulfate groups per monosaccharide. With substitution 0.13, the 90%-inhibition dose was 104 mg/kg, with 0.7 it was 56 mg/kg, and between substitution 1 and 2 it ranged from 20 to 23 mg/kg. At 100 mg/kg, plasma concentration was 0.6 to 0.7 mg/mL. Xylan sulfate (mol wt 6,000, substitution 1.8) gave 90% inhibition at 11 mg/kg, and heparin gave 90% inhibition at 97 mg/kg. Duration of inhibition (0.5 to 2 hours) depended on mol wt and appeared to be related to plasma clearance. Because protamine also inhibited rolling (12 mg/kg; less than 10 minutes), we propose that repetitive formation and breakup of ionic bonds between sulfate groups and positively charged amino acids is involved in leukocyte rolling. During inhibition of rolling, systemic lymphocyte/monocyte levels appeared to increase. Granulocyte counts did not change, indicating that rolling is not the main mechanism responsible for the marginal granulocyte pool.\r"

  ".U": "91183178\r", 
  ".W": "Antibodies to the neutrophil-specific antigens NA1 and NA2 are associated with alloimmune neonatal neutropenia (ANN), autoimmune neutropenia of childhood, and acute pulmonary transfusion reactions. These antigens have been found to be located on the neutrophil Fc-gamma receptor III (FcRIII). The mother of a child with ANN was found to lack both NA antigens and to produce an antibody that reacted with all normal neutrophils tested. We used maternal antibody and a CD16 monoclonal antibody (MoAb) that has specificity for FcRIII to immunoblot and immunoprecipitate neutrophil membranes of various NA phenotypes. Both antibodies immunoblotted an approximately 40- to 70-Kd glycoprotein (GP) on NA1, NA2-positive membrane, an approximately 40- to 55-Kd GP on NA1-homozygous membranes, and an approximately 55- to 70-Kd GP on NA2-homozygous membranes. Both antibodies also immunoprecipitated a 50- to 80-Kd GP from NA1, NA2-positive cells, a 50- to 60-Kd GP from NA1-homozygous cells, and a 55- to 80-Kd GP from NA2-homozygous cells. To further examine the specificity of the maternal antibody, sequential immunoprecipitation studies were performed using maternal antisera and a CD16 MoAb. After extracts of 125I surface-labeled neutrophils were precleared with maternal serum, CD16 MoAbs no longer immunoprecipitated any GP. Neither the CD16 MoAb nor a rabbit polyclonal antibody specific for FcRIII detected any GP in maternal neutrophil membranes by immunoblotting. Neutrophil FcRIII is a glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol anchored membrane GP as is decay accelerating factor and both are absent from neutrophils of patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH). Maternal neutrophil membranes were probed with antibody specific for DAF and an 80-Kd GP was detected. This woman also has had no clinical evidence of PNH. These studies provide further evidence that the NA1 and NA2 antigens are on FcRIII and identify a healthy person whose neutrophils lack not only the neutrophil specific antigens NA1 and NA2 but multiple other epitopes of FcRIII and, therefore, likely lack FcRIII entirely.\r"

  ".W": "In an effort to evaluate the role of the band 3-ankyrin linkage in maintenance of red blood cell membrane integrity, solution conditions were sought that would selectively dissociate the band 3-ankyrin linkage, leaving other membrane skeletal interactions intact. For this purpose erythrocytes were equilibrated overnight in nutrient-containing buffers at a range of elevated pHs and then examined for changes in mechanical stability and membrane skeletal composition. Band 3 was found to be released from interaction with the membrane skeleton over a pH range (8.4 to 9.5) that was observed to dissociate the band 3-ankyrin interaction in vitro. In contrast, all other membrane skeletal associations appeared to remain intact up to pH 9.3, after which they were also seen to dissociate. Whereas hemolysis of mechanically unstressed cells did not begin until approximately pH 9.3, where the membrane skeletons began to disintegrate, enhanced fragmentation of shear stressed membranes was seen to begin near pH 8, where band 3 dissociation was first observed. Furthermore, the shear-induced fragmentation rate was found to reach a maximum at pH 9.4, ie, where band 3 dissociation was essentially complete. Based on these correlations, we hypothesize that the band 3-ankyrin linkage of the membrane skeleton to the lipid bilayer is essential for red blood cell stability in the face of mechanical distortion but not for cellular integrity in the absence of mechanical stress.\r"

The patients ranged in age from 16 to 60 years (median 42 years). All patients received dexamethasone, high-dose cytarabine, and cisplatin (DHAP) for two courses at 3- to 4-week intervals. Patients achieving a partial or complete response were scheduled to receive involved-field radiotherapy and high-dose carmustine, etoposide, cytarabine, and cyclophosphamide (BEAC), followed by autologous bone marrow transplantation (ABMT). Among 48 evaluable patients (ie, 1 was lost to follow-up and 1 had no measurable disease) 7 patients obtained a complete response (CR) and another 21 patients achieved partial response (PR), whereas the remaining 20 patients failed. One responder died of treatment-related toxicity, and six others declined ABMT. The patient with no measurable disease did not progress on DHAP and was submitted to ABMT. Twenty-two patients underwent ABMT [20 with BEAC and 2 with cyclophosphamide plus total body irradiation (TBI)] of whom 2 (9%) died of toxicity and 10 relapsed. One patient was a suicide at 28 months post-ABMT in CCR and 9 are alive disease-free 24 months to 32 months (median 30 months) post-ABMT. The actuarial 2-year event-free survival for patients undergoing transplantation is 40%. This prospective multicenter trial documents the ability of DHAP followed by ABMT to produce durable complete remission in a significant proportion of patients with relapsed aggressive NHL. Forty-four percent of all patients with relapsed lymphoma who entered the study actually underwent ABMT and 20% of the total group are projected to be long-term disease-free survivors.\r"

  ".W": "We report the safety and efficacy of 34 consecutive autologous bone marrow transplant (ABMT) procedures performed in adult patients with high-grade lymphoid malignancy after remission induction therapy. Fifteen patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and six with high-grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) received pretransplant conditioning with intravenous (IV) melphalan and fractionated total body irradiation (TBI). Thirteen other patients with NHL were conditioned with melphalan alone, having previously received local involved field radiotherapy. Unmanipulated noncryopreserved autologous marrow was reinfused within 48 hours of harvesting. Engraftment occurred in all patients with medians of 10 days of neutropenia (neutrophils less than 0.5 x 10(9)/L), 4-day platelet transfusion requirement, 3 U packed RBC transfusion, and 18 days in hospital posttransplant. There were no procedure-related deaths. Actuarial disease-free survival in the 13 patients with ALL receiving autotransplant early in first remission is 48% with a median follow-up of 3 years. Two other ALL patients who had autotransplants after a period of maintenance therapy also remain in complete remission (CR). These results compare favorably with our 34% disease-free survival (DFS) in 15 allogeneic ALL transplant patients and 21% DFS in 19 patients on standard maintenance after a common induction schedule. No relapses have occurred in the 17 NHL patients transplanted in remission (median follow-up 2 years), but the two NHL patients who developed recurrent disease before ABMT died of progressive disease after temporary responses. We conclude that this method of ABMT results in rapid reengraftment with lack of toxicity and that the conditioning treatment used shows good efficacy against disease. It is applicable in high-grade lymphoid malignancy in first remission, and our results call into question the need for marrow purging in ALL and NHL patients transplanted in first remission.\r"

  ".W": "To improve the grafting efficiency of transplanted murine hematopoietic progenitors, we briefly preincubated mouse bone marrow cells with interleukin-3 (IL-3) or granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) ex vivo before their transplantation into irradiated recipients. This treatment was translated into an increase in the seeding efficiency of colony-forming unit-spleen (CFU-S) and CFU-GM after transplantation. Not only was the concentration of CFU-S in the tibia increased 2 and 24 hours after transplantation, but the total cell number and CFU-S and CFU-GM concentrations were persistently higher in IL-3- and GM-CSF-treated groups 1 to 3 weeks after transplantation. In addition, the survival of animals as a function of transplanted cell number was persistently higher in IL-3- and GM-CSF-treated groups compared with controls. The data indicate that the pretreatment of marrow cells with IL-3 and GM-CSF before transplantation increases the seeding efficiency of hematopoietic stem cells and probably other progenitor cells after transplantation. This increased efficiency may be mediated by upward modulation of homing receptors. Therefore, ex vivo preincubation of donor marrow cells with IL-3 and GM-CSF may be a useful tactic in bone marrow transplantation.\r"

  ".U": "91183183\r", 
  ".W": "We combined the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with oligonucleotide hybridization as a novel and sensitive technique to evaluate posttransplant chimerism. Specific oligonucleotides for hybridization were synthesized homologous to tandemly repetitive core sequences of regions with a variable number of tandem repeats (VNTRs). Polymorphisms at such loci result from allelic differences in the number of repeats. Primers flanking the repeat region of each of the corresponding VNTRs were used for amplification. Recipient and donor pretransplant DNA and recipient posttransplant DNA were amplified. The resultant fragments were analyzed after gel electrophoresis either by hybridization in-gel or after Southern transfer. To confirm our findings, we also performed standard assays of restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs). Evaluation of 13 selected cases indicated mixed chimerism (4), complete chimerism (5), recurrence of leukemia (2), and endogenous repopulation of hematopoiesis (2) after marrow transplantation. Sensitivity of the method was determined by mixing various proportions of recipient and donor DNA; the limit of detection of the minor component in a mixture was 0.1%. PCR data correlated with RFLP data in all cases except two in which PCR proved more sensitive than RFLP. PCR amplification of VNTRs combined with oligonucleotide hybridization is a novel technique for documenting posttransplant chimerism and has advantages over RFLP analysis: high sensitivity, use of small amounts of DNA (250 ng), ease of preparation of DNA, elimination of need for restriction enzymes, and the ability to complete studies in 2 days.\r"

This report on the management of the postmyocardial infarction patient represents the first in a series of these consensus conferences. The process for establishing consensus recommendations involved several steps. A primary panel of 11 experts from various fields was selected to review the available clinical evidence and to make a list of recommendations about management decisions in the postmyocardial infarction period. The initial report was distributed to a secondary panel of 16 reviewers* representing allied health care constituencies from across Canada. On the basis of the critical reviews and feedback from these reviewers, a revised report was distributed to all members (over 800) of the Canadian Cardiovascular Society for further review and feedback. This iterative approach resulted in a penultimate report that was presented at a plenary session of the annual scientific meeting of the Canadian Cardiovascular Society on Oct. 18, 1990, in Halifax, NS. On the basis of discussion and feedback from this symposium, the consensus review was completed.\r"
