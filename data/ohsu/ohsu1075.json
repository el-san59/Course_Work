Growth of infants with diarrhea is adversely affected by associated diseases including anorexia, malabsorption, catabolic response to infection, and iatrogenic starvation. To prevent the negative effects of diarrhea on the nutrition of infants, continued feeding during the active and early convalescent phases has been recommended. Although this concept is not new, until recently it has been little used in the treatment of diarrhea. In this article we examine the current knowledge about, and trends in, feeding infants with diarrhea. We will discuss treatments for the well-nourished infant with acute diarrhea, the infant with prolonged diarrhea, and the malnourished infant. Information regarding the use of local staples will also be provided.\r"

Advanced technologies, including neutron activation analysis systems and dual photon absorptiometry, now enable investigators to extend body composition estimates and to construct near-complete chemical models in vivo. These new or refined approaches will advance our knowledge of human body composition and will also improve our accuracy in calibrating simpler epidemiologic and bedside body-composition techniques.\r"

Because all practical methods of measurement are indirect (i.e., not involving carcass analysis), appropriate models of body composition must be applied. Today's improved precision is due both to better instrumentation and to improved models based on partition of the body into its constituent compartments. With this improved methodology has come the recognition that loss of lean body mass is associated with survival in starvation, acute illness, and aging. In addition, correlations of lean body mass with immune competence and functional status are beginning to emerge. It remains to be proven that changes in lean body mass in aging and disease independently determine outcome. Interventions that preserve or normalize lean body mass could be important for preservation of vigorous functional status.\r"

Between January 1, 1989 and June 30, 1990, we performed 854 fetal echocardiograms on 776 fetuses. Color flow mapping was used in 45 of 48 fetuses diagnosed as having cardiac abnormalities. Scans were reviewed to assess how color flow mapping influenced the ultimate diagnoses. Color flow mapping was essential to the correct anatomical diagnoses in 13 fetuses (29%), helpful but not essential in 21 (47%), and added little to two-dimensional examination alone in 11 (24%). It was essential in determining the course and flow direction in the great vessels when outflow obstruction was present or with transposition, and it was helpful but not essential in locating small jets of atrioventricular valve regurgitation. It was not helpful when the anatomical abnormalities were clearly identified from two-dimensional examination alone. We conclude that color flow mapping is helpful in the delineation of anatomical diagnoses in three-quarters of cases of fetal heart disease, particularly when the great vessels are abnormal. It may speed examinations by directing pulsed Doppler sampling. We did not find it essential to the proper recognition of anatomically abnormal hearts.\r"

Glucose tolerance and insulin secretion were measured at baseline and at 6 and 12 months after an oral glucose stimulus. Both preparations produced a relative hyperglycemia at 6 and 12 months compared with baseline, but within the norms for glucose tolerance. The insulin response, measured in 48 treated and eight control subjects, also increased over 12 months in both treated groups, but the total insulin area was within the range of the reference laboratory. Such minor changes have not been associated with cardiovascular diseases and support the safety of low-dose triphasic preparations.\r"

To study the possible association of HPV infections with pearly penile papules, we examined tissue specimens from 13 men with pearly penile papules with and without associated penile condylomata. Biopsy specimens were tested for the presence of HPV DNA by the polymerase chain reaction. None of the pearly penile papules contained HPV DNA sequences, whereas four of seven cases clinically suspected of being condylomata associated with pearly penile papules contained HPV DNA. These results confirm that pearly penile papule lesions do not contain HPV DNA; therefore, the distinction between pearly penile papules and penile condylomata is clinically significant.\r"

A review of data from multiple centers shows that a complete and detailed, normal ultrasound is an appropriate basis for a reduction of at least 95% in the maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein (MSAFP)-based risk for neural tube defects. The use of this adjusted risk in patient counseling before amniocentesis may lower the rate of the procedure with no significant loss of diagnostic sensitivity. Among patients with elevated MSAFP, the rate of abnormal cytogenetic findings in fetuses with no abnormalities detected at ultrasound appears to be near 0.61%. Furthermore, the spectrum of abnormal cytogenetic results appears to differ from that associated with increased maternal age, in that the incidence of sex chromosome abnormalities is higher and that of Down syndrome is lower.\r"

A total of 25 publications reported 85 pregnancies in 81 women, including three twin pregnancies. Captopril had been used in 49, enalapril in 35, and both drugs in one of these pregnancies. The number of unbiased data are too limited to permit firm conclusions on teratogenicity, if any, of these agents. Contrary to earlier suggestions, we found no evidence that the use of these agents increases the likelihood of low weight for gestational age, respiratory distress syndrome, and/or persistent ductus arteriosus. Use of these agents in pregnancy can cause severe disturbance of fetal and neonatal renal function, such as oligohydramnios, pulmonary hypoplasia, and long-lasting neonatal anuria. Although the true incidence of these perinatal problems cannot be derived from the type of data hitherto available, there are strong suggestions that renal dysfunction is more common with the use of enalapril than with captopril. The frequency of serious perinatal complications is high enough to warrant extreme reluctance in prescribing angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors during pregnancy.\r"

The study assessed the following: 1) the degree to which raters distinguished among six categories of performance, 2) the concordance among raters in terms of evaluation criteria used, 3) the degree of inter-rater agreement, and 4) the relationship between the ratings and student performance on the National Board of Medical Examiners Subject Examination in obstetrics and gynecology. Data from physician ratings and examination scores of 82 students were analyzed. The physicians received no standardized training in using the evaluation form. Seven raters (three faculty, four residents [one per postgraduate year]) were randomly selected from each student's set of evaluations. Contrary to expectations, physicians made global ratings of the students using a single criterion and did not distinguish among the six evaluation categories. Each of the five groups of physicians used a different criterion to evaluate students. The ratings were inflated and suffered from low inter-rater reliability. First-year residents were more lenient in their grading tendencies than the other physician groups. The ratings showed a weak correlation with the examination scores, and the strength of this relationship varied with the physician group and performance category. These findings and supporting literature should remind clerkship directors to periodically check the quality of clinical performance ratings and to recognize the limitations of these ratings for grading purposes. Suggestions are presented for improving the student evaluation process.\r"

Low birth weight (LBW), shortened gestation, LBW at term, and neonatal death occurred more often in women reporting first-trimester bleeding than in those who never bled. These relationships remained statistically significant after adjusting for confounding factors. Women who experienced vaginal bleeding limited to the first trimester (N = 1174) had double the risk of delivering a preterm infant compared with those experiencing no bleeding (adjusted risk ratio = 2.0; 95% confidence interval 1.6-2.5). Bleeding limited to the first trimester was associated with a 1.6-fold risk of delivery of a term LBW infant (95% confidence interval 1.3-2.0). These results suggest that first-trimester vaginal bleeding is an important correlate of adverse infant outcomes.\r"

It locks readily, it takes less time to tie than numerous square knots, and it is not as bulky as other knots. The clinch knot has been found to be especially useful for securing pedicles in relatively inaccessible places such as the infundibulopelvic ligament when performing oophorectomy at the time of vaginal hysterectomy. During endoscopic surgery, the knot has been used as an alternative to the Endoloop and as the preferred knot to secure the Endo-knot.\r"

Fifty women with uncomplicated pregnancies at or beyond 41 weeks' gestation and Bishop scores below 9 received twice-weekly outpatient administration of gel containing 2.0 mg of PGE2 or placebo. Thirty nulliparas and 20 multiparas were enrolled. The PGE2 gel failed to improve cervical ripening over placebo, as judged by Bishop scores. There was no difference between the groups in gestational age on admission to the labor and delivery suite, number of gel applications, requirement for oxytocin, incidence of cesarean delivery, or neonatal outcome. Only two patients (4%) experienced regular uterine contractions after gel insertion; these subsided spontaneously in both. None of the subjects experienced labor, tetanic contractions, evidence of fetal distress, or any other side effects related to gel insertion. We conclude that PGE2 gel in this dosage may be used safely in an outpatient setting, but more frequent application or earlier initiation may be required to produce a clinical effect.\r"

  ".W": "The aim of this study was to determine whether neutrophil activation occurs in the fetal circulation in pregnancy-induced hypertension and to correlate this with evidence of neutrophil activation in the maternal circulation. Twenty-one normal pregnancies and 23 complicated by pregnancy-induced hypertension were studied in the third trimester. The mean length of gestation at delivery was significantly shorter (P less than .01) and the mean birth weight percentile was significantly lower (P less than .05) in the hypertensive group; otherwise the groups were comparable. Blood was obtained before cesarean delivery or established labor in the mothers and immediately after delivery from the umbilical vein. Plasma neutrophil elastase, which is released after neutrophil activation, was measured by radioimmunoassay as a marker for neutrophil activation. The mean (+/- standard error) concentration of neutrophil elastase in maternal plasma in the hypertensive group (35.9 +/- 4.7 ng/mL) was significantly higher than in the normal group (20.8 +/- 0.87 ng/mL) (P less than .005). The concentration of neutrophil elastase in umbilical venous plasma was not significantly different between the normal and hypertensive groups. However, significantly higher concentrations of neutrophil elastase were found in the umbilical venous plasma of pregnancies delivered vaginally compared with those delivered by cesarean (P less than .05) regardless of diagnosis. There was no correlation between maternal venous and umbilical venous plasma neutrophil elastase concentrations, birth weight percentile, plasma urate, or platelet count. These data suggest that neutrophil activation is confined to the maternal circulation in pregnancy-induced hypertension where it may contribute to vascular damage and dysfunction in areas such as the placental bed.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Thirty-one patients received vitamin B6, 25-mg tablets orally every 8 hours for 72 hours, and 28 patients received placebo in the same regimen. Patients were categorized according to the presence of vomiting: severe nausea (score greater than 7) or mild to moderate nausea (score of 7 or less). The severity of nausea (as graded on a visual analogue scale of 1-10 cm) and the number of patients with vomiting over a 72-hour period were used to evaluate response to therapy. Twelve of 31 patients in the vitamin B6 group had a pre-treatment nausea score greater than 7 (severe) (mean 8.2 +/- 0.8), as did ten of 28 patients in the placebo group (mean 8.7 +/- 0.9) (not significant). Following therapy, there was a significant difference in the mean \"difference in nausea\" score (ie, baseline - post-therapy nausea) between patients with severe nausea receiving vitamin B6 (mean 4.3 +/- 2.1) and placebo (mean 1.8 +/- 2.2) (P less than .01). In patients with mild to moderate nausea and in the group as a whole, no significant difference between treatment and placebo was observed. Fifteen of 31 vitamin B6-treated patients had vomiting before therapy, compared with ten of 28 in the placebo group (not significant). At the completion of 3 days of therapy, only eight of 31 patients in the vitamin B6 group had any vomiting, compared with 15 of 28 patients in the placebo group (P less than .05).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The decreasing incidence of direct causes of maternal death over the past half century has led to a heightened awareness of nonobstetric factors responsible for maternal mortality. For example, cerebrovascular accidents are an important nonobstetric cause of maternal morbidity and mortality. During the 6.5-year period from 1984 to mid-1990, we encountered 15 women in whom pregnancy or the puerperium was complicated by an acute cerebrovascular accident. Six of these women had hemorrhagic strokes and nine had ischemic strokes. During this same time, approximately 90,000 women were delivered at Parkland Memorial Hospital, and thus the incidence of stroke was about one in 6000 pregnancies. Chronic hypertension or preeclampsia was causative in three cases of hemorrhagic stroke. It is important that 20% of the women died as a result of stroke, and of the 12 survivors, 40% have residual neurologic deficits. An aggressive work-up to define the etiology of stroke is necessary in order to implement cause-specific management, with subsequent reduction in morbidity and mortality.\r"

For effective communication among clinicians, the percentage method requires agreement about the length of the uneffaced cervix. Variation in beliefs regarding cervical effacement and length was assessed among practicing obstetricians at a single medical center. The mean estimate for the length of the uneffaced cervix at term was 2.47 +/- 0.64 cm, with a range of 1-4 cm and a coefficient of variation of 26%. The mean estimate of physicians in private practice was significantly shorter (P less than .001) than that of faculty and house staff combined. There is the potential for miscommunication among physicians based on variation in beliefs about effacement. Adoption of the metric system for description of the cervix would eliminate hidden assumptions about cervical length and the concept of effacement.\r"

  ".W": "Six hundred eighty-five primigravidas followed as a series had complement activation evaluated by the formation of anaphylatoxins (C3a and C5a) and terminal C5b-9 complement complexes in venous blood. Samples for complement determinations were obtained four times during pregnancy, in pregnancy weeks 12-16, 20-24, 28-32, and 34-36. Seven of the women developed preeclampsia and one of them the syndrome of hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelet count (HELLP syndrome). Eleven others with uncomplicated pregnancies were selected as a control group. Plasma samples were taken from these 18 women at delivery and 1 and 7 days after delivery. At delivery, plasma C5a levels were significantly greater in the preeclamptics than in controls, and four of the seven preeclamptics had elevated plasma C3a values compared with controls. One week after delivery, these plasma anaphylatoxins had returned to normal. Elevations of the anaphylatoxins could not be detected before the women developed clinical signs of preeclampsia. No alterations in terminal C5b-9 complement complexes could be observed in the women with preeclampsia. However, the women who developed HELLP syndrome had elevated plasma concentrations of C3a, C5a, and terminal C5b-9 complement complex at delivery. These values returned to the normal range 1 week after delivery. We conclude that complement activation in the systemic circulation does not occur early in pregnancy and that plasma concentrations of C3a, C5a, or terminal C5b-9 complement complex cannot be used as predictors of preeclampsia.\r"

During a 36-month period, 31 patients were referred for ultrasound and/or computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging because of postpartum fever unresponsive to broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy of at least 72 hours' duration. Hematomas were identified in 11 women. Abscesses were diagnosed in seven patients, ovarian venous thrombosis in two, vesicouterine fistula in one, small-bowel obstruction in one, and a subcutaneous seroma in one. Twenty-one women had endomyometritis, 13 of whom also had other extrauterine abnormalities (abscess in six, hematoma in four, and ovarian venous thrombosis, vesicouterine fistula, and small-bowel obstruction in one each). Retained placental tissue was found in two women with endomyometritis. Only two subjects had negative imaging studies. In most patients, imaging led to definitive diagnosis and specific therapeutic measures resulting in resolution of the febrile morbidity. Our experience suggests that these imaging techniques may be helpful in evaluating puerperal fever.\r"

  ".W": "There is little information on the effect of lactation on maternal mineral and calcitropic hormone status. Therefore, we prospectively compared 26 lactating women with 32 nonlactating postpartum controls over the first year postpartum. Nineteen of the 26 women breast-fed their infants for fewer than 12 months and seven breast-fed for at least 12 months. During the first 6 months postpartum, serum phosphorus and parathyroid hormone (PTH) concentrations decreased with increasing time (P = .04 and P = .003, respectively) and were higher in lactating compared with nonlactating women (P less than .001 and P = .06, respectively). Mean serum phosphorus concentrations at 1, 3, and 6 months postpartum were 4.45, 4.75, and 4.34 mg/dL, respectively, in lactating women, versus 4.01, 3.64, and 3.44 mg/dL in controls. Mean PTH concentrations were 1.58, 1.48, and 1.36 ng/mL in lactating women, compared with 1.45, 1.20, and 1.16 ng/mL, respectively, in controls. At 12 months, women who were weaning had significantly higher mean serum calcium (10.11 mg/dL) and magnesium (2.36 mg/dL) concentrations than those who had weaned (8.79 and 2.03 mg/dL, respectively) or who had never lactated (8.90 and 1.95 mg/dL, respectively). Serum phosphorus, PTH, and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D were similar among women who were weaning (4.02 mg/dL, 1.46 ng/mL, and 54 pg/mL, respectively) and those who had weaned (3.94 mg/dL, 1.68 ng/mL, and 55 pg/mL), and were significantly higher than concentrations in women who had never lactated (3.25 mg/dL, 0.92 ng/mL, and 39 pg/mL). Our findings during lactation and the persistent differences observed during and after weaning are consistent with bone mobilization during lactation and a recovery of bone mass during and after weaning.\r"

Thirty-three patients (12.5%) developed recurrence or died of disease. In univariate statistical analysis, prognostic factors significantly associated with disease recurrence were as follows: age (mean 68.6 years with versus 60.3 years without recurrence; P = .0001); histology (adenocarcinoma 8.8%, adenosquamous 35.7%, papillary 25%, clear-cell 57.1%; P less than .0001); tumor grade (grade 1, 7.7%, grade 2, 10.5%, grade 3, 36.1%; P less than .0001); depth of myometrial invasion (none 9.8%, less than one-half 7.4%, one-half or greater 29.6%; P = .0001); lymph node status (negative 8.3%, positive 47.6%; P less than .0001); non-nodal extrauterine disease spread (absent 11.0%, present 50%; P = .0003); peritoneal cytology (negative 9.4%, positive 26.3%; P = .004), and tumor size (2 cm or less 7%, greater than 2 cm 17.3%; P = .05). Cervical extension and uterine size had no significant effect on recurrence. Using multivariate analysis, grade 3 tumor (P = .002), advancing age (P = .004), lymph node metastasis (P = .006), and presence of extrauterine disease spread other than lymph node metastasis (P = .038) were the only variables significantly associated with disease recurrence or death.

Our purpose was to maximize the discrimination between benign and malignant entities. Transvaginal sonographic pelvic images of 143 patients were correlated with surgical findings or histopathology. Of 281 ovaries, 108 had benign lesions (30 endometriomas, 24 teratomas, 21 simple cysts, and 33 other abnormalities) and 20 had malignancies. The scoring system devised was useful in distinguishing benign from malignant masses, with a specificity of 83%, sensitivity of 100%, and positive and negative predictive values of 37 and 100%, respectively. Further experience and refinements of this method of scoring should maximize the benefit of high-resolution transvaginal sonography of ovarian lesions.\r"

Of this group, 1253 women have been followed up for 3 years or more and 380 for 6 years or more. There have been 119 treatment failures (5.6%), of which 71% of the women had the second lesion detected during the first year of follow-up, 24% during the second year, 3.3% during the third year, and 1.7% during the sixth year. In 18% of these 119, the second lesion was detected colposcopically in the presence of negative cytology. There were two cases of microinvasion and one frankly invasive lesion following laser, all diagnosed during the second year of follow-up. Our data suggest that if the first year of follow-up includes at least one colposcopic examination, some second lesions will be diagnosed in the presence of negative cytology.\r"

All had cervical cytology, colposcopically directed biopsy, and T-cell studies performed. Thirteen of 32 patients (41%) had cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN). Another 14 of 32 patients (44%) had histologic evidence of cervicitis. Abnormal cytology, noted in only three women, suggested CIN in one and inflammatory atypia in two. All (five of five) patients with a clinical diagnosis of AIDS had CIN, compared with 30% (eight of 27) of non-AIDS HIV-positive patients (P less than .05). Patients diagnosed with CIN had significantly lower CD4 cell counts (221/mm3 versus 408/mm3; P less than .06) and CD4:CD8 ratios (0.33 versus 0.62; P less than .02) than those without CIN. Patients with cervicitis had greater T-cell immunosuppression than did those with normal histology. In addition, patients with AIDS were more likely to have higher-grade lesions than were non-AIDS HIV-seropositive patients. Seven of 12 CIN specimens available for analysis by polymerase chain reaction using consensus sequence primers detected human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA, including three patients with three or more HPV types. Our data suggest that abnormal cervical pathology is common among HIV-positive women and that cytologic screening is not predictive of CIN in this population. In addition, the presence and severity of cervical dysplasia correlates with quantitative T-cell function. We strongly recommend that cervical colposcopy be part of the routine management of HIV-seropositive women.\r"

Acceptance of this approach, however, appears to have preceded detailed evaluation of possible adverse side effects of progestins that could result in patient noncompliance. We evaluated the nonmenstrual physical and psychological side effects of oral medroxyprogesterone acetate given in conjunction with transdermal estrogen in two groups of women with previous hysterectomy and oophorectomy. Twenty-four women with prospectively documented severe premenstrual syndrome (PMS) before surgery and 24 women with no such history of adverse premenstrual changes received transdermal estrogen 100 micrograms on days 1-25 and either oral medroxyprogesterone acetate 10 mg daily or an identical placebo (days 12-25) in a randomized, double-blind, cross-over design. Mood and physical symptoms were monitored prospectively, using daily self-ratings on the Daily Symptoms Checklist. The Beck Depression Inventory and Premenstrual Tension Self-Rating Scale were completed on day 24. At the study's completion, the patients were asked which treatment period they preferred. Paired comparisons did not reveal any significant differences, and preference for treatment was equally divided between medroxyprogesterone acetate and placebo. We conclude that addition of medroxyprogesterone acetate 10 mg/day for 14 days to cyclic transdermal estrogen therapy (days 1-25) produces no consistent adverse physical or psychological effects on women for one cycle of treatment, regardless of their PMS history.\r"

There were no statistically significant differences between the Healon and Viscoat groups at 4, 10, and 72 hours. At 24 hours, the Healon group had a mean pressure rise over baseline of 6.5 mm Hg, while the Viscoat group had returned to baseline levels (P = .02). We conclude that both Healon and Viscoat raise postoperative IOPs, but that Healon appears to elevate IOPs for a longer period after surgery than Viscoat.\r"

The mean age of onset of esotropia in these patients was 3.5 months, and the mean age at the time of surgery was 12.9 months. The mean preoperative deviation was 69 delta of esotropia. This procedure resulted in satisfactory horizontal alignment in 47 patients (61%) at their latest follow-up examination (mean, 27 months; range, 6 months to 6 years). The esotropia was undercorrected in 21 patients (27%) and overcorrected in nine (12%). Amblyopia was noted in 30%, oblique muscle dysfunction in 44%, and dissociated vertical deviation in 36% of the patients. Regression analysis of multiple variables showed alignment at 6 weeks to be the only predictor of the final outcome (R = .83). Extramacular fusion was achieved in 10 of 11 patients for whom reliable sensory data were available. The mean age at surgery of these patients was 9.7 months. Seven-millimeter bilateral medial rectus recessions are an effective alternative to three- and four-muscle procedures in the initial treatment of large-angle congenital esotropia during infancy.\r"

In porcine eyes, outflow increased directly with the number of noncontact burns as well as with the amount of perfusion pressure. Our results suggest that intraocular pressure and outflow are functions of both the intensity of irradiation and the surface area treated, and that each individual pressure head may require an optimal pars plana area of treatment of therapeutic degree to lower pressure and yet prevent overfiltration and phthisis. Our results also suggest that there may be a passive transneuroepithelial and transscleral outflow component in clinical laser cycloablation and, therefore, a need to grade laser treatments in order to prevent visual loss through unnecessary injury.\r"

Subjective pain scores of 10 subjects were significantly less (P less than .008) on the iontophoresis treated eyelids (0.25) than on the untreated eyelids (2.55). Nine patients undergoing bilateral upper eyelid surgery had iontophoresis applied to one randomly chosen eyelid prior to the usual anesthetic injections. In this double-masked evaluation, patients reported significantly less pain (P less than .02) on the treated eyelids (1.4) than on the untreated eyelids (4.7).

Though the rise in IOP after diazepam pretreatment was significant, the magnitude was lower than that observed in the groups pretreated with the other two agents. Halothane brought the IOP down faster and lower than ether. SCh is unsafe for intubation for the administration of general anesthesia in cases involving penetrating ocular injuries. It can, however, be used safely for routine ophthalmic surgery, providing that 8 minutes are allowed to elapse between injection and corneal or scleral incision. Halothane is preferred to ether, since the former lowers IOP faster and in a greater amount than the latter.\r"

Except for subluxation (29%), trauma history typified TMD patient groups 1 to 5 (63%, 79%, 44%, 53%, 54%) (p less than 0.001) compared with 13% and 18% of asymptomatic (n = 61) and symptomatic (n = 161) student control subjects, and 11% of general dental patients (n = 150). TMD groups 2 and 3 differed significantly (p less than 0.05). The high prevalence of trauma in the myalgia-only group complicates the concept of myofascial pain-dysfunction syndrome as solely a stress or centrally mediated disorder. DD without reduction (43%) and with reduction (38%) had the highest prevalences of motor vehicle accident trauma, myalgia and OA groups had less, and subluxation-only cases had none. On the other hand, patients with DD without reduction were also the only group to report multiple trauma (29%), suggesting that although specific traumatic events may seem to precipitate clinical symptoms, they may not always have initiated the problem. Trauma may be both an important cumulative and precipitating event in TMDs.\r"

Eighty-nine percent were pleased with esthetic changes, and 83% responded that the functional problem had been corrected. For most, the greatest discomfort related to the surgery was the postoperative intensive care unit. Two of the most common side effects of the surgery were the loss of sensation in the lips and chin area and a short period of depression. Women had depression more often than men but were more enthusiastic about the final results of the procedure. Two major areas of interest to surgeons emerged from the research. First, although women have functional problems, the majority seem to have a desire for cosmetic improvement. Having a functional problem seemed to provide the psychological permission necessary to spend the time and money for a cosmetic change. The second point focused on the need for good communication between surgeon and patient. The patients who were more positive toward the procedure and more satisfied with the results were those who were better informed and who thought they had a good system of communication with the orthodontist, surgeon, and their respective staffs.\r"

The relationship of oral soft and hard tissue changes to the disease mechanisms in different EB types remains to be elucidated. The purpose of this investigation was to evaluate selected aspects of salivary function in a healthy control population and in persons affected with different types of EB. Sixty-one patients with EB, representing all the major types of EB, and 36 unaffected persons were examined to measure their stimulated salivary flow rates and salivary levels of IgA, albumin, and total protein. Our results show that none of the types of EB demonstrated a decreased salivary flow rate. However, patients with recessive dystrophic EB had significantly elevated salivary IgA, albumin, and total protein levels. The increased IgA level seen in this form of EB appears most likely to be related to the high prevalence of oral blistering rather than the result of altered mucosal immune function. Despite severe cutaneous and extracutaneous involvement associated with inherited EB, we found no evidence to support the hypothesis of abnormal salivary function or mucosal immunity in this disease. Taken together, these findings suggest that the rampant dental caries seen in the severe forms of EB are likely attributable to nonsalivary factors such as enamel involvement, soft tissue alterations, and/or diet. Alternatively, there may be mucosal immunity or salivary enzyme alterations that influence oral disease in these patients, but these were not evaluated in this investigation.\r"

Twelve areas of the gingiva on each patient were graded at 4-week intervals for 16 weeks with respect to the three indexes: hyperplasia, gingival health, and plaque index. There were no significant differences between treatment groups for any of the three indexes over time. The poststudy serum folate levels were three times baseline levels for the active drug group (p less than 0.001) but unchanged in the placebo group. Phenytoin blood levels that began within the therapeutic window (10 to 20 micrograms/ml) tended to remain within the therapeutic window for both groups, with no reported seizure activity. A single daily oral 3 mg capsule of folic acid did not show efficacy as the sole therapeutic agent in the reduction of phenytoin-induced gingival hyperplasia.\r"

It is a common disorder, with an increasing prevalence among young adults. It may be associated with a disinterest in performing appropriate preventive oral hygiene techniques, a cariogenic diet, diminished salivary flow, rampant dental decay, advanced periodontal disease, and oral dysesthesias. Many medications used to treat the disease magnify the xerostomia and increase the incidence of dental disease. Appropriate dental management necessitates a vigorous preventive dental education program, the use of saliva substitutes and anticaries agents containing fluoride, and special precautions when prescribing or administering analgesics and local anesthetics.\r"

No other endodontic investigation has used this type of graft material in the treatment of bony resorptive defects of the periapical lesions associated with failed endodontic therapy. Therefore this study was conducted with the use of FDBA, to assess healing ability of osseous defects after removal of periapical lesions associated with failed endodontically treated teeth. In all patients periapical lesions were surgically removed with retrograde amalgam seal and the graft material was then carefully packed without pressure into the bony defect. The lesions were fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin and prepared for histologic examination. Long-term recall demonstrated bone regeneration and good tolerance of allograft material by the periapical tissues. The periapical lesions were either periapical granulomas or apical periodontal cysts. We conclude that FDBA is a biocompatible material of osteogenic potential and can be used effectively in treating osseous defects of periapical lesions associated with failed endodontically treated teeth.\r"

Compared with the other techniques, the HPL device produced a smaller number of overlapped surfaces and substantially fewer technical errors. In vivo studies of the new device are therefore indicated. The restriction of the field of primary and secondary irradiation may lead to a substantial reduction in absorbed radiation dose compared with other techniques.\r"

On the images obtained after ductal ligation but before stimulation, there was no significant change in signal intensity on either side. After injection of pilocarpine the signal intensity of the ligated gland increased significantly (p less than 0.01) in T2-weighted images and nonsignificantly in inversion recovery images, and remained constant in T1-weighted images. Significant (p less than 0.01) volume increases of the glands after ligation and stimulation were measured for the T1, T2, and inversion recovery protocols. These findings likely reflect the retention of saliva caused by pilocarpine stimulation and the absence of drainage through the obstructed duct. The results indicate that the T2-weighted images obtained after pilocarpine stimulation may be useful for studying patients with disturbance of major salivary gland function and may provide an objective basis for the noninvasive diagnosis of unilateral stenosis.\r"

Before screening was available, diagnosis of this condition was often delayed. The IQ of 65% of all patients with congenital hypothyroidism was below 85, and 19% were profoundly retarded (IQ less than 15). In two large screening programs in which long-term IQ data are available, no child has tested below the IQ of 74. Furthermore, a comparison of affected children treated within the first month of life with matched controls demonstrated no significant difference in IQ scores between the two groups. Widespread screening has lead to the evaluation of over 7 million infants annually. This represents over 1200 fewer children with subnormal intelligence, and approximately 360 children annually who are saved from the effects of profound mental retardation. There is little doubt that newborn screening is one of the greatest advances in diagnosis and treatment of endocrine disease in the newborn period to occur in the past 20 years. However, even experienced screening programs are not perfect, so the practitioner must remain alert to the possibility of undiagnosed hypothyroidism presenting in infancy.\r"

  ".W": "The incidence of goiters in children is about 4% to 5%. The first step in the evaluation is to decide whether the swelling indeed involves the thyroid. After careful examination, one determines if the thyroid is diffusely or focally enlarged. A solitary nodule merits an extensive workup because of the high rate of malignancy. The evaluation of a diffuse goiter proceeds after deciding if the patient is euthyroid, hypothyroid, or hyperthyroid. In most cases, the child is euthyroid and the diagnosis is either CLT or simple colloid goiter. Laboratory tests for thyroid function and antibodies usually make the diagnosis. The hypothyroid patient most likely has CLT, although drugs or goitrogens, dyshormonogenesis, and thyroid resistance are also possible. The hyperthyroid patient usually has Graves' disease. The incidence of malignancy of solitary thyroid nodules is 15% to 40%; therefore, evaluation must be sensitive enough not to miss cancer. Ultrasonography helps to delineate the anatomy and to reveal if the nodule is cystic. Radionuclide scans are useful, as warm or hot lesions are rarely malignant. Cold nodules require further investigation, and in most institutions, this amounts to open biopsy. Fine-needle aspiration may be used if the clinician and pathologist are experienced. With this aggressive approach to thyroid nodules, malignancies are given early treatment. The prognosis is good in most thyroid carcinomas.\r"

However, the clinician should be aware of agents that can cause significant harm to patients if not detected and treated quickly. Iron and carbon monoxide are good examples of lethal agents that need a high index of clinical suspicion for early recognition and require specific therapy to ensure a good outcome. Patients who overdose with clonidine, calcium-channel blockers, beta-adrenergic blockers, or albuterol must be managed expectantly and according to their clinical presentation because rapid laboratory verification is not available for these poisons. In all situations, the clinician must integrate information from history, physical examination, and laboratory to render the best care.\r"

The health care team shares responsibility for providing optimal pharmacologic interventions. Nurses, however, spend more time with patients and are more likely to focus on the patient as an individual. These factors place them in a prime position to assess the patient's response to a drug. Nurses should always consider the probability that a change in a patient's physical condition or behavior could be caused by an adverse drug effect or, conversely, that a change in physiologic status could alter the patient's response to a drug. Before administering a new drug or a medication that is prescribed on an as-needed basis, one should consider whether the patient has disease-, nutrition-, age-, genetic-, or other-related factors that might alter pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic parameters. Even without knowing the myriad specific side effects attributed to a drug, an initial prediction of increased risk for adverse drug effects can be made by assessing the patients. Do they have a history of adverse drug reactions? Are they obese, malnourished, dehydrated, an alcoholic, or a smoker? Do they have hepatic or renal dysfunction? Is it possible that a loss of homeostatic reserve might affect the drug response? Application of the principles of pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics to nursing assessment can improve the outcome of drug therapy and decrease the incidence of adverse drug effects.\r"

  ".W": "Pharmacologic advances in anesthesia over the last decade have focused on drug safety, shorter durations of action, reversibility, and ease of administration. This is reflective of major changes in the focus of patient care from inpatient to outpatient settings as well as from available risk management data that support the investigation of these new drugs. The pharmacologic advances discussed included those drugs in current practice as well as experimental drugs yet to be released for general clinical use. Inhaled agents, such as isoflurane and perhaps the experimental agent, desflurane, will maintain or achieve their popularity because of the relative ease of administration and wide margins of safety. Propofol, the most recent intravenous anesthetic available for clinical use, has already gained wide acceptance because of its dual function as an induction and maintenance agent and its appropriateness for use in the ambulatory surgical population. The role of midazolam in anesthesia practice has increased to such an extent that it has largely supplanted the use of diazepam (Valium). The introduction of the antagonist, flumazenil, will undoubtedly enhance the safety and efficacy of midazolam as well as broaden its applicability of use across various patient populations. Several of the newer synthetic narcotics, such as alfentanil and sufentanil, have replaced other narcotics formerly used in anesthesia practice, such as meperidine and morphine, primarily because of their short action and lack of significant side effects. The use of muscle relaxants as a critical component of anesthetic management has led to the development of a number of new drugs in this classification. Pharmacologic management of patients under anesthesia will at some future date likely include the administration of alpha 2 agonists. Administration of these drugs can reduce anesthetic requirements of traditional agents by as much as 50%. As research continues, new drugs will be incorporated into the practice of anesthesia, ones that will promote rapid uptake, low toxicity, intense analgesia, easy reversibility, shorter durations, and fewer side effects. One measure of success relative to pharmacologic development in anesthesia is the recent and dramatic decreases in patient morbidity and mortality figures over the last decade. This attests to the rapid growth and development of not only improved patient monitoring systems but also newly improved \"agents of sleep.\"\r"

  ".U": "91261656\r", 
  ".W": "Intraspinal drug delivery provides agents directly to their site of action. These sites, receptors within the spinal cord, are bound to a greater degree when drugs are administered intraspinally. The purpose for drug therapy, the acute or chronic nature of delivery, and the drug administration system affect the choice of epidural versus intrathecal route of delivery. Pharmacologic properties, such as solubility, pH, and pKa, aid in dictating the drug chosen for administration. Intraspinal opiates and anesthetics have been used extensively since the 1970s in postoperative, postpartum, and cancer populations. Various delivery systems are in use, including external catheters and implanted ports and pumps. Nursing care includes titration of doses, prevention and management of side effects, and maintenance of delivery systems. Intrathecal baclofen is a new treatment for severe spasticity for patients with multiple sclerosis or spinal cord injury. Candidates include patients who experience persistent spasticity unrelieved by antispasmodics or who experience unacceptable side effects to those oral drugs. Nurses assess spasticity, titrate the intrathecal baclofen to obtain an acceptable degree of spasticity, and manage side effects associated with intrathecal baclofen. A long-term benefit of intraspinal drug delivery, potentially providing benefit to many patients, is the identification of experimental agents that do not cross the blood-brain barrier but prove effective when delivered intraspinally. Pharmacologists and others then might undertake the costly modifications necessary to improve the solubility of the drug. The analogue then might be given orally. \"The feasibility of an operation is not an indication for its performance.\" These words, attributed to the late Lord Cohen, also apply to intraspinal drug delivery. As with any therapy, the simplest and least invasive course should be taken. If, for example, the patient experiences good relief without side effects when given oral opiates or baclofen, there is no good rationale for inserting an intraspinal catheter. The potential for increased morbidity and the escalated expense make this an illogical choice. There are, however, many patients who cannot tolerate oral opiates or baclofen but obtain significant benefit from intraspinal drug delivery. Those who benefit should not be denied this therapy. Much research is necessary as this modality develops. Nurses who comprehend the science of intraspinal drug delivery, as well as the art of patient management, can contribute to this advancing field.\r"

The following attributes of the training programs were studied: number of programs, length of training, number of first-year positions, number of graduates, program participation in the National Resident Match Program, amount of clinical time required, elective rotations, didactic, research, administrative, and teaching experience, patient volumes, and attending staffing. Emergency department time varies between three and nine months each year. Forty-three (100%) of the programs require specific rotations and offer didactic medical education, and nearly all (97%) require research and offer training in administrative areas. Patient volumes vary between 15,000 and 90,000, with a median of 39,000. The data offered are meant to act as a guide to further development of new and existing programs.\r"

Studies have shown that there is a need for improved communication between physicians and patients, and it is believed that quality of, and satisfaction with, health care services will improve with increased emphasis on interpersonal communication skills in medical training. The Department of Pediatrics at Harbor-UCLA Medical Center includes interpersonal telephone communication as part of residency training. This article describes the telephone program, which differs from other programs in medical settings in that it focuses on communication process skills only. A conceptual framework around the acronym T.A.L.K. is outlined. Topic sessions in the pediatric emergency department and individual resident review sessions are discussed. The guidelines designed to follow the conceptual framework are presented.\r"

Ethylene glycol is rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, with peak levels measured one to four hours after ingestion. Metabolism of the parent compound and the production of several organic acids are responsible for the metabolic acidosis observed in ethylene glycol poisoning. Target organ cellular damage is seen in the kidney, brain, myocardium, pancreas, and blood vessel walls. Renal tubular deposition of calcium oxalate crystals is felt to be responsible for the development of the severe renal injury which may accompany ethylene glycol ingestion. The clinical course is quite varied and includes inebriation, hematuria, cardiorespiratory compromise, and neurologic effects. Prompt diagnosis and initiation of treatment, including ethanol therapy and hemodialysis, is necessary to ameliorate the effects of ethylene glycol ingestion. Two cases of ethylene glycol poisoning, one accidental and one intentional, are reviewed.\r"

For example, Kaposi's sarcoma, a common finding in adults with AIDS, is rare in children. Other cutaneous manifestations, including bacterial and fungal lesions and viral exanthems, are common in children with AIDS and can be atypical and severe. Because 90% of the pediatric AIDS population acquires the virus via maternal transmission to the fetus, a dysmorphic syndrome associated with intrauterine infection has been described. Physicians caring for and evaluating pediatric patients at risk for AIDS should be aware of these dermatologic manifestations, so that early detection and treatment can be instituted to reduce the morbidity of the complication of HIV infection.\r"

Osteoarticular beta 2-microglobulin amyloid deposits were also found in patients who had been treated mainly by continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis. Systemic amyloid deposition was only seen in patients who had been haemodialysed for more than 13 years and consisted of sparse tiny deposits in blood vessel walls.\r"

Thus we analysed the initial ECGs of 94 consecutive cases with suspected myocardial infarction who were seen within six hours after the onset of chest pain by a mobile coronary care unit. The study included 91 patients (three patients admitted twice) (61 male), aged 27-83 years (mean 60.5). Median time from onset of chest pain to arrival of the mobile coronary care unit was 75 minutes (range 15-345), and mean mobile coronary care unit response time was 12.3 +/- 7 (SD) minutes (range 5-45). The majority of cases (65 of 94, 69.1 per cent) were seen within two hours of the onset of symptoms. A final diagnosis of myocardial infarction was made in 48 of 94 (51.1 per cent) cases; 38 had unstable angina and eight other diagnoses. Of the 48 with myocardial infarction the initial ECG showed ST segment elevation in 37, ST depression and or T wave inversion in six, Q waves only in three and left bundle branch block in two. No patient with an initially normal ECG had a myocardial infarction. Thrombolytic therapy was given out of hospital to 33 of 38 patients with ST segment elevation. In seven patients with ST elevation (median delay time to intensive care 60 minutes), rapid resolution of ST segment elevation occurred following thrombolytic therapy and there was no significant elevation of cardiac enzymes, suggesting that the infarct had been aborted.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The phenotypic variability of the syndrome is explored: four members had hypothyroidism; two had abnormal gonadal function; all five had abnormal prolactin response to TRH; one had abnormal hepatic response to glucagon infusion. All had normal hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axes, renal responsiveness to vasopressin and growth hormone responses to a variety of stimuli. Special note is made of oral pathology, and evidence of platelet aggregation abnormalities is presented which has not previously been described in the syndrome.\r"

Eighteen patients (eight male) aged 16-49 years underwent dynamic tests of the hypothalamic-pituitary axis with insulin hypoglycaemia, thyrotrophin releasing hormone (TRH) and gonadotrophin releasing hormone stimulation and basal measurement of prolactin, sex steroids and thyroid hormones. Growth hormone responses (mean peak 64 +/- 36 mU/l, range 21-146 mU/l) and cortisol responses (mean peak 831 +/- 122 nmol/l, range 626-1105 nmol/l) were all within the normal range. Two patients had minimally elevated serum prolactin levels (445 and 588 mU/l, normal less than 350 mU/l). Serum thyroxine levels (57-133 nmol/l) were normal but six patients had elevated basal thyrotrophin (TSH) levels (6-9 mU/l) and seven had an exaggerated TSH response to thyrotrophin releasing hormone, indicating radiation-induced damage to the thyroid. Amenorrhea developed within 3 months of irradiation in all females and oestradiol levels were low, at 37-108 pmol/l (mean 58 +/- 22 pmol/l). Severe oligospermia or azoospermia was noted in men tested 5-70 months after irradiation and testicular volume was below the normal adult range in five of seven men assessed. Serum testosterone levels (12.4-35 nmol/l) were normal. Gonadotrophin-releasing hormone-stimulated gonadotrophin levels were elevated in all patients. However, two men have fathered two children each; one has refused semen analysis, but the other has a sperm count of 7 x 10(6)/ml (60 per cent motile, 20 per cent abnormal forms) 70 months after irradiation. When given by the above fractionated regimens, the endocrine sequelae of total body irradiation are limited to gonadal failure requiring oestrogen replacement in women and severe impairment of fertility in men. Subclinical thyroid dysfunction has been seen in 39 per cent of patients there is no evidence of direct damage to the hypothalamic pituitary axis.\r"

We reviewed our experience of 63 patients who presented with abdominal pain as the main reason for admission to the AIDS unit at St Stephen's and Westminster Hospital between January 1988 and January 1990. All patients were assessed within the same structured diagnostic programme. Thirty-five had upper abdominal pain, predominantly in the right upper quadrant in 27; seven had lower abdominal pain, which was concentrated in the right iliac fossa in three; 21 had diffuse abdominal pain. The causes of pain were determined satisfactorily in the majority of patients using routine gastroenterological investigations. The predominant site of pain had considerable predictive value in the diagnosis. The commonest cause of right upper quadrant pain was sclerosing cholangitis (17 of 27); endoscopic retrograde cholangio-pancreatography was necessary for a confident diagnosis. Diarrhoea was frequently associated (15 of 21) with diffuse abdominal pain; the commonest cause (six of 21) was cytomegalovirus colitis. Neoplasia was the cause of abdominal pain in eight patients. The other causes of abdominal pain and the utility of various investigations are discussed. An investigatory route which may provide maximum information has been suggested.\r"

The four Shigella species (S. dysenteriae, S. flexneri, S. boydii, and S. sonnei) are classically identified by culture of fecal specimens on selective media and testing of isolates for agglutination in species-specific antisera. DNA probes have been used to identify both lactose-fermenting and non-lactose-fermenting EIEC as well as Shigella isolates that do not agglutinate in antisera. These DNA probes are not necessary for the identification of Shigella if a competent bacteriology laboratory with shigella antisera is available. In Thailand Shigella and EIEC are isolated more often from children greater than 2 years of age than from younger children. The clinical illness associated with EIEC infections is similar to shigellosis. Fewer children with EIEC infections than with shigellosis, however, have occult blood in stool (36% vs. 82%) and more than 10 fecal leukocytes per high-power field (36% vs. 67%). Standard bacteriologic methods and testing of E. coli isolates for hybridization with the shigella/EIEC probe are currently the most sensitive means of diagnosing infections caused by these enteric pathogens. A more rapid method of identifying Shigella and EIEC infections in a situation where a bacteriology laboratory is not available will probably involve immunologic assays.\r"

  ".W": "Nearly 20% of children seen in the outpatient department of Children's Hospital in Bangkok, Thailand, for diarrheal disease had bloody diarrhea. Shigella species and enteroinvasive Escherichia coli--isolated from 13% and 2% of children with diarrhea, respectively--were the most frequent causes of bloody diarrhea. Campylobacter species and nontyphoidal Salmonella species were also isolated frequently but were much less often associated with bloody diarrhea. Shigella species were rarely isolated from patients who did not have diarrhea, while Campylobacter and Salmonella species were isolated frequently from well children. None of the species isolated always caused bloody diarrhea. Studies on infection with Campylobacter suggest that natural immunity may prevent bloody diarrhea and in fact may eventually prevent all disease due to this organism. Studies of endemic Shigella flexneri and epidemic Shigella dysenteriae 1 in Thailand have shown that immunity may also explain an age-related decrease in rates of S. flexneri infection but not in rates of S. dysenteriae 1 isolation.\r"

For the purpose of several studies, serum samples from a total of 175 Vietnamese and 47 Swedish patients, for whom Shigella species had been isolated from fecal specimens, were obtained at various intervals until less than or equal to 1 year after the onset of infection. Titers of antibodies in serum samples from infected patients were compared with those in serum samples from healthy control subjects; the combined control population of all studies comprised 426 Vietnamese and 154 Swedes. The sensitivity of the EIAs ranged from 78% to 100% for patients whose fecal culture was positive for Shigella. For diagnosis of S. flexneri, a species-specific but no serotype-specific assay based on LPS antigens is possible. Among Vietnamese patients the EIA with use of S. flexneri was sensitive and diagnostic only for children less than 3 years of age, most likely because healthy older Vietnamese children and adults have high titers of antibody to the O-antigens of S. flexneri. Among Swedish patients the same EIA was diagnostic for adults as well as children. Increased titers of IgA in the early phase and of IgG in the convalescent phase, as determined by EIA, were the best indicators of infection due to Shigella species.\r"

  ".W": "This paper explores the epidemiologic importance of dysentery with use of several community studies that demonstrate its prevalence and incidence as well as its association with pathogens, nutritional status, persistent diarrhea, and death. Results of these studies showed that while watery diarrhea was most prevalent in children aged 6-11 months, the prevalence of dysentery peaked between 18 and 23 months of age. Severely stunted children were found to have significantly prolonged episodes of dysentery. Shigella and persistent diarrhea were more frequent in children with dysentery than in those with nonbloody diarrhea. A striking feature was that watery diarrhea, dysentery, persistent diarrhea, and malnutrition each account for less than 5% of all deaths among children aged less than 5 years. However, persistent diarrhea in association with malnutrition causes 13% of deaths in children aged 0-4 years and 27% of deaths in those aged 1-4 years. These data suggest that a more balanced strategy for diarrheal control is required simply because most diarrheal deaths occur among malnourished children with prolonged diarrhea, which is mainly due to dysentery. Results of the studies also suggest that methods to control dysentery in the community should focus on improved hygiene and antimicrobial treatment with use of appropriate algorithms. Recognition of the synergism between dysentery and persistent diarrhea accompanied by malnutrition is crucial in formulating effective programs for control of diarrhea.\r"

Attack rates during epidemics of dysentery due to infection with S. dysenteriae type 1 have ranged from 1% to 33%, and case-fatality rates have ranged from 1% to 7%. In Matlab, a rural district in Bangladesh, most diarrhea-related deaths and approximately 25% of all deaths among children 1 through 4 years of age are attributable to dysentery. In 1984, an epidemic of dysentery was associated with a 42% increase in the death rate in that age group. At the Dhaka Treatment Centre of the International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh, the fatality rate for 970 inpatients with shigellosis was 11% in 1988, with most deaths occurring among malnourished children who were infected with Shigella flexneri. Control of mortality from shigellosis will require prevention of epidemic S. dysenteriae type 1 disease and endemic S. flexneri infections in children who live in countries with a high prevalence of malnutrition.\r"

In Bangladesh, four types of illnesses with names derived from folk terminology have been identified for which the clinical symptoms resemble those of diarrhea. These include dud haga, which is due to ingestion of breast milk by infants; ajirno, which is due to overeating; amasha, a mucoid diarrhea; and daeria, which is severe watery diarrhea or cholera. Use of the word diarrhea in epidemiologic evaluations was discovered to be problematic; people confused this term with daeria, which accounted for only 5% of all episodes of diarrhea. The implications of such epidemiologic information for a large-scale program of oral rehydration therapy are also discussed.\r"

We found that ideas about cleanliness generally are not based on germ theory; cleanliness is viewed in a larger, socioreligious context of purity vs. impurity. Washing serves both physical and spiritual needs and is performed according to defined patterns that may not effectively interrupt transmission of microorganisms. Soap is regarded as a cosmetic rather than an agent for removal of microorganisms.\r"

The biologic characteristics of the organism and sociocultural responses to it imply that it is unlikely that a purely technologic solution (vaccine) to shigellosis will be found soon. Infrastructural development (protected water supply and sanitary disposal of feces) may be too expensive to be feasible due to the economic, environmental, and demographic conditions in developing countries. Behavioral change to reduce the risk of transmission may be a more effective preventive strategy. Case management in developing countries will require prompt, appropriate action when symptoms of shigellosis occur. A general model of health-seeking behavior suggests patients' parents or guardians (anyone responsible for care of the child and for overseeing the child's health, e.g., older siblings or grandparents) will take no action if the symptoms are not recognized or are perceived as normal or if the condition is not evaluated as serious or treatable. It is not necessary for patients' parents or guardians to learn about etiologic models from medical practitioners to behave in ways that will reduce the risk of infection or to seek effective treatment. For example, hand washing may be promoted on the basis of symbolism. Agreement between potential patients or their guardians and health care providers on signs of potentially severe disease may be enough to bring them into effective contact.\r"

The various steps of invasion of epithelial cells are controlled by a 220-kilobase plasmid. Plasmid genes that encode for entry into cells through bacterium-directed phagocytosis have been identified. Among these, ipa genes encode four highly immunogenic polypeptides. The ability of intracellular bacteria to multiply subsequently in an efficient manner is attributable to their capacity to lyse phagocytic membrane with a plasmid-encoded contact hemolysin that also determines bacterial entry capacity. In a further step, bacteria that lie free within the cytosol spread intracellularly and infect adjacent cells by inducing rapid polymerization of actin or accumulation of actin. Another plasmid gene, icsA (virG), that encodes a 120-kDa outer-membrane protein accounts for this phenotype. Finally, intracellular shigellae kill host cells rapidly by means of an unknown mechanism that does not seem to involve production of Shiga toxin or Shiga-like toxin. The invasion genes are controlled by both positive and negative regulatory systems.\r"

These two peptides associate with a stoichiometry of one A and five B subunits to form the holotoxin. The A chain is responsible for the biochemical effect of the holotoxin: cleavage of the N-glycosidic bond of adenine at nucleotide position 4324 in the 28S rRNA of the 60S ribosomal subunit. The B chain mediates binding of toxin to cell surface receptors.

Gb3, which is developmentally regulated in the rabbit small bowel, is present in very low concentration until the animals reach day 16 of life. In older animals an increase in Gb3 content is paralleled by an increase in the ability of MVM to bind toxin, which also correlates with the fluid secretion response. Shiga toxin selectively binds to villus cells, which contain Gb3, and not to crypt cells, which do not express Gb3. Targeting of the villus cell by the toxin is consistent with physiologic studies that demonstrate inhibition of villus cell Na+ absorptive pathways, with no effect on crypt cell Cl- secretory mechanisms. These effects are sufficient to account for the enterotoxicity of Shiga toxin in the rabbit model.\r"

The vascular lesion was widespread in the lamina propria mucosae. Extensive ulceration was associated with invasion of epithelial cells by the organism. There was marked depletion of mucus and an increase in mitotic activity in the crypts. Abscesses of the crypts were rare. The only difference between patients from whom the Shiga bacillus was isolated and patients from whom other shigellae were isolated was a higher prevalence of epithelial cell detachment and luminal exudate. In patients who had been ill for greater than 1 week, cell damage of the crypts was associated with cell-mediated cytolysis, a release of cytotoxic substances from eosinophils and mast cells, and relative vascular insufficiency, all of which may contribute to persistence of dysentery.\r"

Data on the frequency of these complications come primarily from hospital-based studies, in which sepsis-either with Shigella or with other Enterobacteriaceae-and hypoglycemia are the most common causes of death. Management of these two complications requires broad-spectrum empiric antibiotic treatment of all severely ill, malnourished patients with shigellosis as well as frequent feedings to prevent hypoglycemia. Unfortunately, in developing countries, access to parenteral broad-spectrum antimicrobial agents is often limited, and frequent feedings are often precluded by the severe anorexia that is characteristic of shigellosis. Realistic approaches to the reduction of mortality from shigellosis must continue to focus on prevention and early antimicrobial therapy rather than on treatment of established complications.\r"

Clinically evident dehydration of a moderate degree is not uncommon with invasive diarrhea, and when it occurs, the response to ORT is satisfactory. Studies from hospitals and the community each document the effectiveness of ORT for rehydration of patients with invasive diarrhea. This has been confirmed in a clinical trial of oral rehydration solution (ORS) for the treatment of diarrheal diseases in children less than 5 years of age. Children with moderate dehydration benefited most from ORS, especially those who had culture-proven invasive diarrhea. Significant early weight gain was observed for this group of patients alone after rehydration with ORS. In developing countries, there is no reason to withhold ORT at the first signs of watery or dysenteric diarrhea regardless of the cause and independent of the decision to treat the patient with antimicrobial agents.\r"

Not all antimicrobial agents that are active in vitro against Shigella are effective in vivo, and efficacy of an agent can only be assessed by properly conducted clinical trials. Resistance to both ampicillin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, the drugs of choice for the treatment of shigellosis, is now common among Shigella dysenteriae type I isolates in Africa and Asia and is increasing among isolates of other Shigella species, including Shigella sonnei in the United States. Nalidixic acid, the newer quinolones, and amnidocillin pivoxil are additional agents that have been found to be effective in controlled clinical trials. There is a need, however, for more data on the safety of the quinolones before they can be routinely administered to children. Newer agents that deserve evaluation include the orally administered to children. Newer agents that deserve evaluation include the orally administered second- and third-generation cephalosporins, which are highly active in vitro against most strains of Shigella.\r"

The majority of Shigella species isolated from specimens from patients with acute diarrhea in Bangkok in 1988 were resistant to both ampicillin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMZ). Shigella flexneri was the most commonly isolated organism and had the highest rate of resistance to ampicillin, chloramphenicol, TMP-SMZ, and tetracycline. The antimicrobial agents of choice for the treatment of shigellosis have been changed from ampicillin to TMP-SMZ and recently to the fluoroquinolones. We conducted a controlled study of norfloxacin that revealed its efficacy for eradication of Shigella species from the stool of both adults and children. The fluoroquinolones shorten the course of diarrhea, reduce the shedding of the organism, and prevent the spread of infection. No short-term adverse effects of the quinolones were observed in this study; however, its use among children should be restricted to treatment of severe shigellosis and the duration of treatment should be as short as possible.\r"

The children were admitted to the hospital with acute diarrhea, high fever, abdominal pain, and greater than or equal to 25 red blood cells and white blood cells per high-power field in the stool. Microbiologic diagnosis was made within 48 hours of admission. On the basis of clinical and microbiologic criteria, children were classified as having mild or severe infection. Ten children with mild infection did not receive antibiotics, whereas nine children with severe infection were treated with ampicillin. After the children were rehydrated, a 72-hour balance study was carried out during the acute stage of infection with Shigella and was repeated 2 weeks after recovery. The levels of consumption of food and absorption of nutrients were estimated. During the acute stage of infection, such levels were higher for the children treated with antibiotics than for the untreated group. During the recovery phase, the levels of intake of food and absorption of nutrients were equal for both groups. Thus, children who are treated with appropriate antibiotics not only may recover from infection with Shigella more rapidly, but they also may be able to absorb nutrients more efficiently.\r"

  ".W": "A rural area of Bangladesh with a population of 191,000 had 643 health care providers, of whom 324 (50%) practiced allopathic (Western) medicine, 152 (24%) were spiritualists, 109 (17%) were herbalists, and 58 (9%) were homeopaths. Two hundred eight (64%) of the allopaths had no formal training, and only 18 (6%) were graduates of medical school. In a community-based study of 480 children with bloody diarrhea and 480 children with nonbloody diarrhea, allopathic treatment was the most common care provided. Furazolidone and metronidazole were the two most commonly prescribed drugs, given to 26% and 23% of children, respectively, who were seen by a practitioner. Only 25% of children had received oral rehydration therapy. We conclude that in this region of Bangladesh care of acute diarrhea is provided mostly by private medical practitioners who have little or no training; that such care currently is largely irrational; and that the provision of rational care will require the development of simple algorithms that these practitioners can implement for treatment of this disease.\r"

The safety and immunogenicity of SFL114 were next studied in volunteers who were given either 10(9) or 10(10) SFL114 bacteria orally. Mild intestinal discomfort that lasted for 1-2 days was reported by three (12%) of 25 volunteers given 10(9) live SFL114 bacteria and by 13 (54%) of 24 volunteers given 10(10) live SFL114 bacteria. A local intestinal secretory IgA response to the S. flexneri O-antigen was recorded. The in vitro and in vivo results suggest that the aroD transductant SFL114 possesses properties that are desirable in an oral live candidate vaccine.\r"

Our proposed use of the B subunit of Shiga toxin as a carrier protein is based upon evidence (even more indirect) that serum antitoxin may reduce the severity of dysentery and diarrhea. Because animal models of disease may provide information inapplicable to the prediction of vaccine-induced protective immunity, we suggest that clinical trials in the population at risk should be started after successful completion of the safety and immunogenicity phases of vaccine development in laboratory animals and in the target population. Clinical studies of shigella vaccines are difficult because of the many causes of dysentery in a population with a high rate of intestinal disease.\r"

The DNA replication cycle differs with the method of assay: no G1 phase is found in asynchronous cultures, and a long G1 phase is found in synchronous cultures. Encystment most likely occurs from G2, but whether it is limited to a portion of this phase is not clear. Encystment-enhancing factors are released by Acanthamoeba castellanii and Acanthamoeba palestinensis, and encystment can be induced by monoclonal antibodies to plasma membrane proteins. Likewise, encystment can be induced by inhibitors of polyamine synthesis, especially diamidines that inhibit S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase, but inhibition of this enzyme is not necessarily responsible for differentiation. Studies on the regulation of gene expression during encystment have focused on actin and the ribosomal RNA transcriptional unit.\r"

The recent increase in cases of keratitis, especially in relation to an increase in the use of contact lenses, is probably due to the omnipresence of the organism as a result of the pronounced resistance of its cysts to disinfection and desiccation. The temperature of the eye is lower than that of the rest of the human body. Therefore, the presence of Acanthamoeba strains that grow at lower temperatures may also contribute to infection, thereby increasing the number of possibly infectious amebas. Recent evidence, however, indicates that perhaps only a limited number of species cause ocular disease. Delineation of the exact species of Acanthamoeba that cause keratitis is a prerequisite for the study of the ecology of the keratitis-producing amebas.\r"

Central nervous system (CNS) infection due to Acanthamoeba species usually occurs in chronically ill, debilitated individuals, some of them receiving immunosuppressive therapy or taking broad-spectrum antibiotics. The disease runs a protracted, insidious clinical course and is known as granulomatous amebic encephalitis. Histopathologically, Acanthamoeba species may produce a multifocal, chronic, or subacute granulomatous encephalitis, with trophozoites and cysts present in CNS lesions. The portal of entry of the amebas into the CNS is probably the respiratory tract or a skin lesion, and the organisms reach the CNS by hematogenous spread. As of 1 January 1989, about 50 cases of granulomatous amebic encephalitis had been reported worldwide, 27 in the United States alone.\r"

This, as well as the capacity of these amebas to activate complement via the alternative pathway, may be a first-line defense against acanthamoeba infections in humans. Both antibody and complement appear to be important in promoting recognition of these amebas by phagocytic cells such as neutrophils. However, killing of amebas by neutrophils is dependent on lymphokine/monokine priming of the neutrophil. This priming augments the respiratory-burst activity and release of lysosomal enzymes of neutrophils in their response to the ameba. The products of the oxygen-dependent respiratory burst appear to be of prime importance in the killing of this free-living ameba. Antibodies also may prevent tissue invasion by Acanthamoeba by inhibiting its adherence, phagocytic activity, and migration and by neutralizing cytopathogenic amebic agents. Studies on experimental Acanthamoeba infections in mice showed marked species and strain specificity with regard to induction of protection with amebic antigens. Immune compromise or, alternatively, invasion at unique body sites in healthy individuals may form the basis for human infection with Acanthamoeba.\r"

Despite alerts and warnings, education of eye-care professionals and patients, and identification of risk factors that are associated with the use of soft contact lenses, acanthamoeba keratitis remains a threat. It is presumed that in some cases, the soft contact lens is the vector by which Acanthamoeba is introduced to the cornea. This presumption has spurred concern regarding the efficacy of systems used for the disinfection of soft contact lenses in killing the organism. Many questions have been raised regarding the proficiency of disinfection. These have stemmed from a poor understanding of the interactions among soft contact lenses, soft contact lens paraphernalia, and Acanthamoeba. Another issue to be addressed is the need for standardized testing of the efficacy of contact lens disinfection systems against Acanthamoeba. Only through a concerted and focused effort by eye-care and other concerned health care professionals can these questions be answered.\r"

To date, the results of medical therapy have been disappointing, and the optimal medical regimen for acanthamoeba keratitis is yet to be defined. Clinical cure necessitates eradication of the encysted amebae with medications known to have ocular toxic effects in combination with surgical maneuvers. Antiinfective agents possessing in vitro cysticidal activity include paromomycin, neomycin, ketoconazole, natamycin, and ciclopirox olamine, but no agent has been shown to be uniformly effective against all isolates of Acanthamoeba. Treatment of amebic cysts with propamidine isethionate plus either paromomycin or neomycin has produced slightly additive cysticidal effects. Multiple factors, including the varied clinical presentation and the lack of standardized in vitro techniques for the assay of cysticidal activity, account for the lack of correlation between in vitro activity and in vivo efficacy.\r"

In both studies, a subsample of children who were in two-parent families during the initial interview (at age 7 in the British data and at ages 7 to 11 in the U.S. data) were followed through the next interview (at age 11 and ages 11 to 16, respectively). At both time points in the British data, parents and teachers independently rated the children's behavior problems, and the children were given reading and mathematics achievement tests. At both time points in the U.S. data, parents rated the children's behavior problems. Children whose parents divorced or separated between the two time points were compared to children whose families remained intact. For boys, the apparent effect of separation or divorce on behavior problems and achievement at the later time point was sharply reduced by considering behavior problems, achievement levels, and family difficulties that were present at the earlier time point, before any of the families had broken up. For girls, the reduction in the apparent effect of divorce occurred to a lesser but still noticeable extent once preexisting conditions were considered.\r"

Simultaneously, large heteronuclear couplings are exploited to circumvent problems due to the larger linewidths that are associated with increasing molecular weight. These novel experiments have been designed to extend the application of NMR as a method for determining three-dimensional structures of proteins in solution beyond the limits of conventional two-dimensional NMR (approximately 100 residues) to molecules in the 150- to 300-residue range. This potential has recently been confirmed with the determination of the high-resolution NMR structure of a protein greater than 150 residues, namely, interleukin-1 beta.\r"

Evidence for the formation of a stable complex of IL-2R beta and the lymphocyte-specific protein tyrosine kinase p56lck is presented. Specific association sites were identified in the tyrosine kinase catalytic domain of p56lck and in the cytoplasmic domain of IL-2R beta. As a result of interaction, IL-2R beta became phosphorylated in vitro by p56lck. Treatment of T lymphocytes with IL-2 promotes p56lck kinase activity. These data suggest the participation of p56lck as a critical signaling molecule downstream of IL-2R via a novel interaction.\r"

The addition of a phospholipid and its subsequent slow depletion by phospholipase A2 have been used to successfully grow well-ordered monolayer crystals that extend up to about 10 micrometers. The interaction of the L-P ring complex with lipid membranes was also visualized during this process.\r"

Activation of COUP-TF by physiological concentrations of the neurotransmitter dopamine was observed in transient transfection assays. Treatment of transfected cells with the dopamine receptor agonist alpha-ergocryptine also activated COUP-dependent expression of a reporter gene. COUP-TF that contained a deletion in the COOH-terminal domain was not activated by these compounds. These observations suggest that dopamine may be a physiological activator of COUP-TF.\r"

One such epitope is a fragment of human serum albumin. This epitope bound selectively to the human class II molecule DRw11 and was constitutively present on antigen-presenting cells in vivo.

The integrator for horizontal eye position is in the pons, but the locations of the vertical and torsional integrators have not been clearly defined. Recording three-dimensional eye movements in alert monkeys during microstimulation and pharmacological inactivation of midbrain sites showed that the interstitial nucleus of Cajal generates both the torsional and vertical eye position signals. Up and down signals are linked with clockwise signals in the right brain and counterclockwise signals in the left brain. This three-dimensional coordinate system achieves orthogonality and bilateral symmetry without redundancy and optimizes energy efficiency for horizontal visual scanning.\r"

Barrels and boundaries form in transplanted visual cortex and are organized in an array that resembles the pattern in the normal barrelfield.

  ".U": "91262650\r", 
  ".W": "The crystal structure of the binary complex tRNA(Asp)-aspartyl tRNA synthetase from yeast was solved with the use of multiple isomorphous replacement to 3 angstrom resolution. The dimeric synthetase, a member of class II aminoacyl tRNA synthetases (aaRS's) exhibits the characteristic signature motifs conserved in eight aaRS's. These three sequence motifs are contained in the catalytic site domain, built around an antiparallel beta sheet, and flanked by three alpha helices that form the pocket in which adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and the CCA end of tRNA bind. The tRNA(Asp) molecule approaches the synthetase from the variable loop side. The two major contact areas are with the acceptor end and the anticodon stem and loop. In both sites the protein interacts with the tRNA from the major groove side. The correlation between aaRS class II and the initial site of aminoacylation at 3'-OH can be explained by the structure. The molecular association leads to the following features: (i) the backbone of the GCCA single-stranded portion of the acceptor end exhibits a regular helical conformation; (ii) the loop between residues 320 and 342 in motif 2 interacts with the acceptor stem in the major groove and is in contact with the discriminator base G and the first base pair UA; and (iii) the anticodon loop undergoes a large conformational change in order to bind the protein. The conformation of the tRNA molecule in the complex is dictated more by the interaction with the protein than by its own sequence.\r"

Steady-state aminoacylation kinetics of unmodified tRNA transcripts indicate that G34, U35, C36, and G73 are important determinants of tRNA(Asp) identity. Mutations at these positions result in a large decrease (19- to 530-fold) of the kinetic specificity constant (ratio of the catalytic rate constant kcat and the Michaelis constant Km) for aspartylation relative to wild-type tRNA(Asp). Mutation to G10-C25 within the D-stem reduced kcat/Km eightfold. This fifth mutation probably indirectly affects the presentation of the highly conserved G10 nucleotide to the synthetase. A yeast tRNA(Phe) was converted into an efficient substrate for aspartyl-tRNA synthetase through introduction of the five identity elements. The identity nucleotides are located in regions of tight interaction between tRNA and synthetase as shown in the crystal structure of the complex and suggest sites of base-specific contacts.\r"

This strategy eliminated the need for recipient immunosuppression and allowed islet xenograft survival beyond 200 days, as demonstrated functionally by C peptide secretion as well as by histology.

These results indicate that cell surface heparan sulfate is directly involved in bFGF cell signaling.\r"

However, the biochemical properties of p53 and the effect of mutation on these properties are unclear. A human DNA sequence was identified that binds specifically to wild-type human p53 protein in vitro. As few as 33 base pairs were sufficient to confer specific binding. Certain guanines within this 33-base pair region were critical, as methylation of these guanines or their substitution with thymine-abrogated binding. Human p53 proteins containing either of two missense mutations commonly found in human tumors were unable to bind significantly to this sequence. These data suggest that a function of p53 may be mediated by its ability to bind to specific DNA sequences in the human genome, and that this activity is altered by mutations that occur in human tumors.\r"

The repeat exhibits instability both when cloned in a nonhomologous host and after amplification by the polymerase chain reaction.

The presence of GluR-B subunits in heteromeric GluRs determined the I-V behavior of the resulting channels. Site-directed mutagenesis identified a single amino acid difference (glutamine to arginine) in the putative transmembrane segment TM2 responsible for subunit-specific I-V relationships. The properties of heteromeric wild-type and mutant GluRs revealed that the dominance of GluR-B is due to the arginine residue in the TM2 region.\r"

During induction, gamma-aminobutyric acid A (GABAA) inhibition decreased, causing the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor-mediated excitation to increase. 2-OH Saclofen, a GABAB receptor antagonist, prevented the reduction of inhibition, the increase of excitation, and the induction of LTP. Therefore, disinhibition caused by GABAB receptors is required for induction of LTP by 5-hertz stimulation. GABAB receptor modulation of synaptic plasticity occurs at frequencies in the range of the endogenous hippocampal theta rhythm, which has been shown to modulate LTP in vivo.\r"

There was a fivefold proportion of failures among patients with scoliosis greater than 30 degrees at the start of therapy but no difference in progression between different kinds of nonsurgical therapies or between treated and untreated patients; these were the main findings of this quantitative analysis. These data cannot be used to prove the effectiveness or ineffectiveness of nonsurgical therapy for idiopathic scoliosis, and experimental controlled studies of different therapies seem to be justified both on ethical and scientific grounds. The findings of this overview can be used for their planning.\r"

The operation was done in 190 patients younger than 20 years of age. Fusion in situ, using a posterior or posterolateral technique, had no statistically significant effect on progression. Surgically treated patients did not differ from conservatively treated patients. Ninety percent of the slip, on average, had already occurred at the first radiologic examination compared with the final amount of slip. More than 10% progression occurred in 62 patients, mainly within the first year postoperatively or after the first examination. Progression of the lumbosacral kyphosis and sinking of the vertebral body was noted in severe slips. Although female gender and dysplasia (spina bifida) at the lumbosacral junction were more frequent in severe slips, they statistically had no value in predicting progression. A wedge form of L5 or sacral rounding also had no prognostic value. These were secondary to the slip and expressed it but did not predict it. The only radiologic variable with predictive value of progression was the percentage amount of the primary slip. In age groups corresponding to the growth spurt in early puberty (girls, 9-12 years; boys, 11-14 years), there was a tendency to progress.\r"

  ".W": "Thirty-four patients with traumatic distractive flexion injuries in the mid to lower cervical spine were treated with posterior wire stabilization without bony fusion from January 1981 through May 1987. Fifteen had cord involvement, and nine had root involvement. Ten were neurologically intact. Thirty patients were followed for a mean of 38 months. Two neurologically intact patients had root deficits postoperatively. One patient was reoperated because of redislocation due to a spinous process fracture. Mean loss of lordosis was 7.5 degrees. Eight patients had a wire break at follow-up, but no case of late instability was observed. Sixteen patients had signs of spontaneous anterior interbody fusion at follow-up, and 11 patients had signs of posterior fusion. Twenty-four patients complained of late--but in most cases--minor pain. These results indicate that simple posterior wiring without bony fusion is a reliable method to obtain good immediate stability in traumatic distractive flexion injuries of the mid to lower cervical spine. The wires provide sufficient stability during the time of soft tissue healing.\r"

These were compared with 14 cases with other malignancies of the spine and 37 controls with nonneoplastic spinal lesions. The diagnosis was confirmed by histologic study in all malignant cases. The results were analyzed by diagnostic test analysis and McNemar chi 2 testing. This yields 18.3-21.6%, 97.2-100%, and 92.8-100% sensitivity, specificity, and predictive value, respectively, for a positive test for VN and RS to differentiate significantly adenocarcinoma from other malignancies and control patients (P less than 0.005). These findings may thus be considered as a simple and economic guide for physicians to determine the proper approach to patients with a spinal lesion suspected to be malignant.\r"

The clinical factors influencing both the 1- and 20-hour corrected count increment (CCI), were studied in 623 human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-unmatched platelet transfusions in 108 patients. The 1- and 20-hour CCIs were highly correlated (r = 0.67, p less than 0.001). On average, the 20-hour CCI was 64 percent of the 1-hour CCI. Multiple linear regression analyses identified splenectomy, bone marrow transplantation, disseminated intravascular coagulation, administration of amphotericin B, palpable spleen, and HLA antibody grade as the major factors influencing the 20-hour posttransfusion CCI. Platelet-specific antibodies, number of concurrent antibiotics, clinical bleeding, and temperature did not significantly influence the 20-hour posttransfusion CCI. The 1-hour CCI was the only significant factor influencing the 20-hour CCI in a regression model containing the 1-hour CCI and the above factors. Thus, the same clinical factors exert a major influence on the CCI at both 1 and 20 hours after platelet transfusion, with no evidence that any factor has more influence at 20 hours after transfusion than at 1 hour.\r"

To determine whether specific antibodies of the IgA or IgM class are present as markers of recent infection in donor specimens that have borderline reactivity on routine enzyme immunoassay (EIA) screening, 15 specimens that were positive by immunoblot were tested for IgA and IgM HIV antibodies. All 15 had detectable IgA HIV antibodies, and 14 had IgM HIV antibodies. The 15 specimens were tested further, each by two independent laboratories, with nine licensed EIAs. Two of the nine EIAs found all 15 units positive in both laboratories; seven EIAs found 1 to 5 of the 15 units negative, for a total of 31 false-negative results. The results indicated a difference between the sensitivity of EIA kits using only anti-IgG reagents and of kits using multispecific reagents that react with IgG and other classes of antibody. In a modified procedure, the addition of enzyme-conjugated anti-IgA or anti-IgM to the kit's enzyme-conjugated reagent increased the optical density values of most false-negative specimens to the positive range. It was concluded that licensed kits vary in reactivity with IgA and IgM HIV antibodies and that sensitivity could be increased by improved detection of these classes of antibody.\r"

The product and procedure were accepted unanimously and enthusiastically, and three potential mistransfusions were avoided by use of the system during the limited period of observation. This type of approach to the identification process affords greater security than conventional practices and minimally burdens staff.\r"

  ".W": "For convenience, small volumes of platelet concentrate (PC) intended for neonatal patients are often dispensed in syringes. The PC, however, may remain in the syringe for up to several hours before the actual transfusion. As there are few data on the effect of such syringe storage on PCs, the in vitro syringe storage properties of small volumes of 1- and 5-day-old units, and volume-reduced units of PC were evaluated. In four separate experiments, PCs were stored in syringes in volumes of 10, 15, or 30 mL for up to 6 hours at 20 to 24 degrees C without agitation. Platelets were evaluated for pH, platelet count, and a variety of biochemical and in vitro functional assays. Results showed that even with the equivalent of a full unit of platelets stored in the syringe for up to 6 hours, the pH did not fall below 6.0. Although there was an increase in lactate production and consumption of glucose, which paralleled the decline in pH, the changes were not greater than those seen in platelets stored up to 5 days in gas-permeable blood bags. Similar results were seen for PCs stored in syringes for 6 hours at 37 degrees C. All of the pH levels recorded at the end of 6 hours of syringe storage were above the minimum required level of pH 6.0. Data from in vitro platelet assays imply that at any time during their shelf life, PCs can be stored in gas-impermeable polypropylene syringes for up to 6 hours and can maintain acceptable storage characteristics; in vivo data are needed to confirm these observations.\r"

  ".W": "Platelets are known to become activated during storage, but it is unclear whether such activation affects recovery or survival after platelet concentrate (PC) transfusion. With the use of flow cytometry to determine the percentage of platelets expressing the alpha-granule membrane protein 140 (GMP-140), a known adhesive ligand appearing on the platelet surface after activation, several studies were conducted. These investigations evaluated 1) the occurrence of significant platelet activation over time in PCs (n = 46) stored under standard blood bank conditions; 2) the correlation between platelet activation and platelet recovery in normal subjects after PC storage (n = 12), as assessed by the recovery of Indium-labeled platelets; and 3) the recovery of activated and unactivated platelets in thrombocytopenic cancer patients transfused with standard PCs (n = 11). It was determined 1) that an increasing duration of storage of PC was associated with increasing platelet activation as measured by the percentage of platelets expressing GMP-140, progressing from a mean of 4 +/- 2 percent (SD) on the day of collection to a mean of 25 +/- 8 percent by 5 days of storage: 2) that, in normal subjects, posttransfusion recovery of autologous platelets stored for 2 to 4 days and then labeled with In111 was inversely correlated with the percentage of activated platelets in the transfused PC (r = -0.55, p = 0.05); and 3) that, when thrombocytopenic patients were transfused with standard PCs, the recovery of the activated platelets in the transfused PCs averaged only 38 +/- 15 percent of the number predicted by the absolute platelet increment.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The effect of the photosensitizer merocyanine 540 (MC 540) on platelets and on three marker viruses was examined to assess its potential in reducing virus transmission by blood products. The results demonstrated several deleterious effects of MC 540 (4-24 micrograms/mL) on platelet morphology and function in both the absence and presence of light (450-600 nm). Treatment of washed platelets with MC 540 in the dark resulted in a significant release of serotonin in the absence of added agonist, as well as a diminished response to thrombin as measured in vitro. In addition, photosensitization caused spontaneous platelet aggregation and release of 92 percent of the releasable serotonin without the addition of an agonist. Because photo-treatment of blood products is likely to be performed in a protein-rich medium, the influence of albumin on the phototoxic effects on platelets was assessed. Albumin added to the suspension medium at concentrations greater than or equal to 1.0 percent protected the platelets against the effects of MC 540 in the dark, whereas 5-percent albumin was required for protection against the phototoxic effects of MC 540 on the platelet response to thrombin. The antiviral activity of MC 540 and light was examined by using the lipid-containing viruses herpes simplex virus (HSV) and bacteriophages phi 6 and PM2. Of the lipid-enveloped viruses, HSV was 25 times more photosensitive to MC 540 than was phi 6 (15 micrograms/mL). PM2, which has an internal lipid layer, was almost 300 times less sensitive to MC 540 and light than was HSV.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The techniques thus far reported have focused on the reliability of detecting a WBC, provided it is present in the test system. The likelihood of selecting a WBC from the product of interest for counting in the analytical system--that is, the sampling error--must also be considered. The occurrence of a WBC in a WBC-depleted component is a rare event and may be modeled with the binomial or the Poisson distribution. Several assay techniques were analyzed by using these distribution models to determine the confidence intervals of the WBC content. The 95-percent confidence intervals spanned more than 2 logs10 for some methods at 3 x 10(5) WBCs per product. It is concluded that the reporting of WBC content for research provides not only the estimate of the mean but also a confidence interval for this estimate. Quality control procedures should be designed to verify that the WBC content is less than the targeted amount and should provide an associated statement of confidence.\r"
