  ".W": "To determine the long-term outcome of children admitted to a pediatric ICU (PICU), we studied 976 consecutive patients admitted to our PICU in the 12 months ending June 30, 1983, and evaluated their outcome 30 to 36 months after PICU admission. There was no relationship between duration of PICU admission and outcome. Young children were more likely to die than older children, but young children who survived did not have an increased risk of handicap. Of the 974 children available for follow-up, 20% died, 5% had a severe handicap, 2% had a moderate handicap, 12% had a mild handicap, 17% were functionally normal but required medical supervision, and 42% were normal. Thus, 80% of the children survived 30 months or more, and 91% of the survivors will probably lead an independent life.\r"

The more common diagnoses included asthma, pneumonia, trauma, and adult respiratory distress syndrome. The average Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE II) score was 12.3, and 68% of the patients were mechanically ventilated. The ICU atmosphere was described as friendly or relaxed by 94% of patients. Confidence in doctors and nurses was good. The most frequently reported unpleasant experiences were arterial blood gas sampling (48% of patients) and tracheal suctioning (30 of 68 ventilated patients). Only 6% of patients disliked ward rounds and discussion around the bedside. This study suggests that arterial lines or pulse oximetry could be used to avoid frequent arterial blood gas analyses and that tracheal suctioning should be performed with greater care. The need for better communication with patients is emphasized.\r"

  ".W": "Exogenous surfactant materials have been used under a variety of treatment protocols in cases of neonatal respiratory distress syndrome (RDS). To evaluate the differences in radiologic changes that follow either an early or late therapy with exogenous bovine surfactant, we reviewed 189 serially obtained chest radiographs from 48 premature baboons with RDS studied under different treatment regimen. Twenty-six animals were controls (100 chest films), and 22 received 100 mg/kg bovine surfactant instilled via the trachea in three study protocols (89 chest films). Surfactant was given within 10 min of birth in one group and at 2 h of age in the other. In 25/26 controls, radiologic evidence of severe RDS was seen by 2 h of age; these changes persisted in 15 animals at 24 h. By contrast, a rapid clearing of radiologic features of RDS was seen following surfactant instillation in all 22 (100%) animals within 4 h, but one (4.5%) of these 22 deteriorated at 9 h of age. Pulmonary interstitial emphysema (PIE) was seen in 9/26 (34.6%) and pneumothorax in 5/26 (19.2%) control animals, while 1/22 (4.5%) surfactant-treated animals developed PIE, and none had pneumothorax. The presence of a shunt via the patent ductus arteriosus did not affect radiographic findings in 20 animals studied by contrast injection. Therapy for patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) also had no substantial influence on the radiographic findings, or with regard to the pulmonary course. Radiographic clearing of RDS occurred approximately 18 to 20 h prior to the improvement in pulmonary compliance.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Animals received eight 90-min exposures twice daily to 2.4 ata and 100% or 10% oxygen. Control animals were maintained in room air. On the ninth day spleens and peritoneal cell exudates were harvested. Phagocytosis was measured by flow-cytometric analysis of the ability of PMN to engulf formalin-killed, fluorescence-labeled Staphylococcus aureus. PMN-killing capacity was measured by the ability of PMN to undergo an oxidative burst after stimulation with N-formyl methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine, phorbol myristate, or opsonized zymosan. T-lymphocyte subpopulations were identified using monoclonal antibodies and two-color flow cytometry after 48 h stimulation with phytohemagglutinin, and lymphocyte proliferation was measured by 3 H-thymidine incorporation. We found PMN phagocytosis and oxidative burst were unchanged after HBO treatment. Lymphocyte proliferation was decreased, and an activated population of CD8+ T cells appeared after mitogen stimulation. We conclude that, although PMN function is not affected by prior HBO, lymphocyte proliferation is decreased.\r"

  ".W": "We determined the effects of volume infusion on cardiac output, oxygen delivery (Do2), oxygen consumption (Vo2), and oxygen extraction (O2 extr) in piglets at ages 5 to 14 days and 3 to 5 wk. Eighteen piglets were anesthetized, intubated, and mechanically ventilated. Six piglets (5 to 14 days old) and six piglets (3 to 5 wk old) received iv dextran (MW 70,000 daltons; 30 to 40 ml/kg) sufficient to raise mean left atrial pressure (LAP) from approximately 4 to 15 mm Hg over 30 min. Six piglets received 0.9% NaCl at 4 ml/kg.h to maintain LAP constant at 4 mm Hg over a 30-min period. All piglets receiving dextran had increased cardiac output (mean elevation 39 +/- 16 [SD]%; range +19% to +73%; p less than .005). This response was mediated entirely by an elevation in stroke volume, as heart rate did not change significantly. However, all piglets receiving dextran reduced Hgb concentration (10.1 +/- 1.5 to 7.5 +/- 1.4 g/dl, p less than .001), a decrease which completely offset the increase in cardiac output. Consequently, Do2 did not increase after dextran infusion (17.4 +/- 1.8 to 18.4 +/- 2.8 ml/min.kg). Neither Vo2 nor O2 extr changed significantly after dextran. No differences were noted in the response to dextran infusion comparing 5 to 14-day-old piglets with 3 to 5-wk-old piglets. Unlike fetal lambs, newborn piglets are able to elevate cardiac output significantly in response to volume loading. However, if these data can be extrapolated to human infants, volume infusion without concurrent blood transfusion is likely to increase systemic cardiac output but not improve Do2.\r"

The latter were used to simulate respiratory failure from viral pneumonitis in man. Acute progressive hypoxia was induced by rebreathing through a respirometer while hemodynamic and oxygen transport variables were rapidly and repeatedly measured. The immediate effects of hypoxia were decreased PaO2 and oxygen delivery. In the middle period of hypoxia, defined as periods 4, 5, and 6 of eight equally spaced time periods, cardiac index, stroke volume, and oxygen extraction increased; these occurred as compensatory responses. Oxygen consumption (VO2) remained relatively stable until late in both control and distemper dogs. Initially, physiologic compensations in distemper dogs were found to be partially exhausted and overall to be shorter in duration and of lesser magnitude when compared with the healthy control animals. Failure to maintain near normal VO2 toward the end of the hypoxic episode indicated the progression of decompensation, imminent circulatory deterioration, and death.\r"

Using the TEB technique, the different thoracic habitus of the pig had to be corrected for A good correlation with the TD technique was obtained (r = .87; p less than .001; n = 86) using thoracic length value (the measured value plus 25%) in an NCCOM3-R6 cardiodynamic computer for Qt values ranging from 2.9 to 9.8 L/min in pigs weighing from 40 to 75 kg. However, the Qt values given by the NCCOM3 were systematically 11% to 15% higher over the full range of values than the average of NCCOM-3 and TD Qt values. On the basis of the good agreement in the present study between the TEB and TD techniques over a broad range of Qt values, we conclude that TEB offers a valuable continuous, noninvasive alternative to TD for Qt determinations in experimental porcine models.\r"

  ".W": "To evaluate the morphologic basis of the different outcomes of toluene diisocyanate (TDI) asthma after quitting occupational exposure, we examined ten patients with TDI asthma who showed, at diagnosis, a positive TDI challenge test and nonspecific bronchial hyperresponsiveness (NSBH) to methacholine. After diagnosis, all patients ceased work and a 4- to 40-month follow-up was obtained with three to eight determinations of the cumulative dose producing a 15 percent fall in FEV1 (PD15FEV1) methacholine in each patient. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and biopsy of bronchial muscosa were performed 3 to 39 months after cessation of work, in the absence of acute exacerbations of the disease. Total cell count in BAL fluid was moderately increased in four of ten patients, eosinophils were increased in five of ten patients, and neutrophils were increased in eight of ten patients. Mucosal biopsy specimens of main or lobar bronchi were available in eight of ten patients; epithelial damage and thickening of basement membrane was observed in almost all patients, as well as a mild-to-moderate inflammatory reaction in the submucosa, mainly represented by lymphocytes, eosinophils, and neutrophils. No relationship was observed between the cellularity of BAL and the degree of NSBH at the time of BAL; mean values of total cells and differential count were not different between patients with presence or absence of the different histologic findings. Mucosal biopsy and BAL were performed also in four subjects exposed to dusts without respiratory symptoms or NSBH; similar findings were obtained except for the absence of eosinophils in BAL and a lesser degree of basement membrane thickening and inflammatory reaction in the submucosa. The study of the changes in NSBH after quitting exposure showed that five of ten patients had a significant improvement in NSBH to methacholine, as evaluated by a positive significant linear regression between months of work cessation and PD15FEV1 methacholine; only one of these five patients had an increased number of eosinophils in BAL fluid. By contrast, four of the five patients with persistent NSBH after quitting exposure had an increased number of eosinophils in BAL. We suggest that persistent NSBH in TDI asthma after cessation of work may be related to an inflammatory reaction in which eosinophil infiltration seems to be a major determinant.\r"

To our knowledge, this is the first observation of intracardiac shunting in CF. This phenomenon may account for unexplained levels of cyanosis and worsening of hypoxemia with exercise, vasodilators, or PEEP and poses the threat of paradoxic emboli when central venous lines are used in these patients.\r"

Questionnaire data were obtained from ten family members (ages 7 to 66 years), overnight sleep studies were performed in nine subjects, and ventilatory responses to hyperoxic hypercapnia and to eucapnic hypoxia and cephalometry were obtained in five subjects. All ten family members reported habitual snoring or nighttime snorting/gasping; five of ten family members also reported excessive daytime sleepiness. All studied subjects except for a pregnant woman had greater than ten apneas/hypopneas per hour. Ventilatory responses to hypoxia were markedly reduced in all five subjects studied (less than or equal to 0.51 L/min/SaO2); hypercapnic responses were reduced in three of five subjects (less than or equal to 0.61 L/min/mm Hg CO2). No subject was morbidly obese (body mass index less than 29 kg/m2) or demonstrated retrognathia. The posterior airway space was reduced in three subjects, and the mandibular to hyoid distance was increased in four subjects. The two subjects with the longest soft palates and the most inferiorly displaced hyoids had the most severe sleep disorder. Sleep apnea was present, albeit less profound, in the one subject with normal anatomy who had an abnormal hypoxic ventilatory response. The distribution of these physiologic and anatomic measurements in this family provides further support for a genetic basis for SA, and suggests that the disorder may occur as a result of interactions between ventilatory control abnormalities and anatomic risk factors.\r"

  ".W": "We investigated whether analysis of cellular composition (including lymphocyte subsets) in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid at the start of follow-up in patients with untreated sarcoidosis has any predictive value for further evolution of the disease. The outcome was evaluated by the chest roentgenograms, the lung volumes, and the single breath diffusing capacity for CO (DCO) after 22 to 36 months. In contrast to the general belief, patients who improved radiologically had a significantly higher T4 cell count (as percentage of BAL lymphocytes) (p less than 0.02) and a higher T4-T8 ratio in the initial BAL sample (9.3 vs 3.2; p less than 0.05) than those whose chest roentgenogram showed deterioration or remained unchanged. Total cell count and the percentage of lymphocytes in BAL fluid were not different between both groups. The change in DCO at the end of the follow-up period correlated positively with the baseline BAL T4 cells (Rs = 0.44; p less than 0.05) and with the BAL T4-T8 ratio (Rs = 0.51; p less than 0.03) and negatively with the baseline BAL T8 cells (Rs = -0.48; p less than 0.04). In only three patients progression of the disease necessitated steroid therapy, and they all had a low to normal T4-T8 ratio in the initial BAL sample. Bronchoalveolar lavage was repeated at least once in ten patients. Improvement of the chest roentgenograms in these patients was accompanied by a decrease of the BAL T4 cell count (as percentage of lymphocytes) and of the T4-T8 ratio. We conclude that a high lymphocyte count, a high T4 cell count (as percentage of lymphocytes), and a high T4-T8 ratio in BAL fluid reflect an intense alveolitis at the time of the procedure, but they are not indicators of poor prognosis on which therapeutic decisions can be based.\r"

Cell differentials were performed on most specimens. Cytomegalovirus was detected by one or more method in 55 BAL specimens from 39 patients. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) pneumonia was diagnosed by lung tissue (primarily autopsy) histologic findings and conventional culture results or the presence of CMV in extrapulmonary tissue, fulfillment of specific clinical and radiographic criteria plus failure to recover a pathogen other than CMV from a respiratory specimen. Probable CMV pneumonia was diagnosed if only the latter two criteria were met. The EA-assay was positive in all patients with proven or probable CMV pneumonia and in 92 percent of those without documented pneumonia. Cytologic findings were positive only in patients with CMV pneumonia but were negative in one-third of those patients. As a diagnostic test for CMV pneumonia, the EA-assay, conventional culture, and cytology had positive predictive values of 45, 57, and 100 percent, respectively. Lymphocyte percentages in BAL specimens from patients with CMV pneumonia were significantly decreased compared with those of patients without CMV pneumonia (p less than 0.005). Although the EA-assay should not be used alone as a diagnostic test for CMV pneumonia in our patient population, the combination of alveolar lymphopenia and a positive BAL CMV EA-assay was highly suggestive of disease.\r"

Adherent target AM were exposed to concentrated BALF in the presence or absence of LPS (1 microgram/ml) for two hours. Control AM were unexposed to BALF. After an additional 24-hour incubation, AM supernatants were collected and measured for IL1 beta by ELISA. No spontaneous IL1 beta release occurred from unstimulated AM. One of the sarcoid-BALF and three of the AIDS-BALF samples induced a small amount of IL1 beta release from unstimulated AM. In LPS-stimulated AM, exposure to normal BALF did not significantly alter IL1 beta release compared to unexposed AM. Exposure to sarcoid-BALF significantly increased the release of IL1 beta, while exposure to AIDS-BALF significantly reduced the IL1 beta level in the AM supernatants. The latter effect was related to the higher mortality induced by AIDS-BALF in AM. These data show that release of IL1 beta from LPS-stimulated AM is modified by a short exposure to a sample of alveolar fluid from patients with lung disease.\r"

Although only six of 24 of the \"successfully\" photoresected patients with squamous cell carcinoma survived for one year, only one patient with inoperable mucoepidermoid carcinoma in the nonsquamous group survived beyond ten months. Karnofsky indices improved in both \"successful\" (p less than 0.001) and \"unsuccessful\" (p less than 0.05) photoresection groups. Improvement in the latter group may be attributed to either a salutary effect of the bronchoscopic procedure or variability in patients' level of functioning. We conclude that a subset of patients with advanced stages of squamous cell carcinoma and airway obstruction due to exophytic tumor may derive substantial benefit in both functional status and survival after Nd:YAG laser photoresection. In addition, unsuccessful restoration of the airway is a grave prognostic sign leading to limited survival.\r"

  ".W": "The development of airflow obstruction, most often due to bronchiolitis, is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in recipients of allogeneic BMT. Current consensus holds that this airways disease is the result of chronic GVHD and/or CMV infection. However, recent studies of idiopathic forms of BRO have demonstrated a striking influx of neutrophils into the lungs of affected individuals. Reasoning that the immune cell populations involved in tissue injury associated with either CGVHD or CMV infection would consist predominantly of lymphocytes, we tested this hypothesis by performing BAL in 12 adults with minimal or absent smoking histories who developed significant airflow obstruction (FEV1/FVC = 80.7 +/- 1 percent preBMT and 56.8 +/- 2.4 percent postBMT; p less than 0.001) following allogeneic BMT. Eleven of 12 patients had evidence of chronic, stable GVHD at the time of the study. In contrast to non-BMT patients with BRO, BAL defined two distinct patterns of lung inflammation in the BMT patients with airflow obstruction: (a) neutrophil predominance (five patients; neutrophil percentage = 20.2 +/- 6.6 percent); and (b) lymphocyte predominance (three patients; lymphocyte percentage = 35.9 +/- 12.1 percent). These data suggest that the pattern of inflammation in the lungs of BMT patients with BRO is not uniform and is not associated with active microbial infection. From these results, it is inferred that the airways injury in BMT patients may reflect diverse pathogenetic mechanisms initiated in the context of CGVHD and cytotoxic drug therapy.\r"

The mean (+/- SD) tracheal mucus velocity of the five patients with proved or presumptive primary ciliary dysfunction was 2.9 +/- 0.2 mm per minute and for the 12 patients without ciliary dysfunction, 7.9 +/- 1.4 mm per minute. (The previously determined rate for normals was 4.7 +/- 1.3 mm per minute.) In four of five patients with ciliary dysfunction, CBF was below 7.5 Hz while in the one patient of the 12 without ciliary dysfunction CBF was at the lower limit of normal values. Thus, mucociliary clearance responds to load, depends partly on CBF, and has a built-in control system and the means for compensating for ciliary dysfunction.\r"

The VM weakness was identified in all patients early after botulism. Upper airway muscle weakness was also common, requiring intubation for airway protection in one patient. Recovery of VM and upper airway muscle strength occurred in all patients, predominantly over the first 12 weeks but continued up to one year in several. A similar time course of improvement was noted for exercise performance. Ventilatory limitation was an unusual cause for exercise limitation. By 12 months, lung function, VM and upper airway muscle strength and exercise performance had returned to normal in all but one patient. We conclude that VM and upper airway muscle weakness occurs in most patients with clinically significant type A botulism.\r"

We tested hospital admission characteristics and hospital mortality on 59 consecutive high-risk patients from our Surgical Department using the APACHE II severity of disease classification system. Predicted mortality rate for the high-risk patients was 12.44 percent and total mortality ratio (actual deaths/predicted deaths) was 0.94.

The 64 patients who did not develop RF survived. All cases of RF developed within 96 hours after poisoning: within 24 hours in 35 patients (acute onset) and between 24 and 96 hours in eight patients (subacute onset). Severity of poisoning was the primary determinating factor for RF. Cardiovascular collapse and pneumonia were also associated with RF. In 19 patients with cardiovascular collapse, 17 had acute onset of RF and two had subacute onset. In 28 patients with pneumonia, 17 developed acute onset of RF and eight developed subacute onset. No organophosphorus compound caused RF more frequently than another. The duration of ventilator support for subacute RF was significantly longer than for acute RF (287 +/- 186 vs 115 +/- 103 hours, p = 0.02). The use of pralidoxime did not reduce the incidence of RF. We found that severity of poisoning, cardiovascular collapse, and pneumonia were the predisposing factors to RF. The golden time for treatment of acute organophosphate or carbamate poisoning was the initial 96 hours. No RF occurred after this time. Aggressive treatment and prevention of the above three factors will reduce the incidence of RF, or in other words, reduce the mortality.\r"

  ".W": "A forced expiratory flow ratio, derived from the average slope of the maximum expiratory flow-volume (MEFV) curve over a specified volume interval, was examined in healthy asymptomatic cigarette smokers and nonsmokers. This index was developed to have the properties that it would be (1) simple to calculate, (2) less effort dependent than indices that incorporate peak flow, and (3) free of influence from the configurational detail and noise frequently occurring at higher lung volumes on MEFV curves. Forced expired vital capacity maneuvers were performed by participants in a worksite health promotion program. Data from asymptomatic individuals with normal pulmonary function were analyzed for 49 cigarette smokers and 52 nonsmokers; 25 individuals had MEFV curves collected twice over a one-year interval. The ratio of flow derived from an average MEFV slope to instantaneous flow was calculated over the lower half of the vital capacity. Flow ratios were expressed as a percentage of the instantaneous flow at 75 percent of the expired vital capacity (FR75). This ratio was reproducible from year 1 to year 2 (r = 0.86, p less than 0.0001). Furthermore, the FR75 was well correlated with age among cigarette smokers and nonsmokers (r = 0.68 and 0.63 respectively). The slope of the least squares regression equation relating FR75 to age was significantly greater among smokers than nonsmokers (2.90 percent per year vs. 1.73 percent per year, p less than 0.025). While there was a significant interactive influence of age and total pack-years on the FR75 (F = 2.91, p = 0.02), this index did not differ systematically by gender. We conclude that the FR25 is a more sensitive index of altered lung function in cigarette smokers than are results of conventional pulmonary function.\r"

The FVC, FEV1, Pmax and PEmax pressures, latency of conduction and amplitude of CDAP with phrenic nerve stimulation, and diaphragmatic excursion during fluoroscopy were measured for 12 months after CAB. Left phrenic paralysis was substantiated in four of five patients, and paresis was present in the other patient. Recovery of the left phrenic nerve occurred in all patients, complete in one and partial in four, but was delayed and continued for up to 12 months. We conclude that phrenic nerve recovery is delayed after CAB-associated injury and may be incomplete up to 14 months later, in keeping with rates of regeneration of other peripheral nerves.\r"

None of the patients had an ischemic electrocardiographic response during exercise. Despite an increase in HR and the pressure-HR product with both types of exercise, the pressure-HR product was significantly higher at three minutes of dynamic exercise, which was associated with a significant lengthening of left ventricular ejection time. Diastolic blood pressure rose significantly during static exercise, but it remained unchanged with dynamic exercise. Electromechanical systole and HR had a linear inverse relation at three minutes of exercise, and DT and HR had a nonlinear inverse relation (DT = e7.29-0.0156 x HR, and DT = e7.07-0.0142 x HR for static and dynamic exercises, respectively). A significant prolongation of QS2 with a consequent shortening of DT (p less than 0.05) was observed in dynamic exercise. In addition to a higher pressure-HR product, the disproportionate shortening of diastole in the early phase of dynamic exercise has a potential for initiating imbalance of myocardial oxygen supply and demand.\r"

  ".W": "To examine the effects of theophylline toxicity on cardiac rhythm, patients underwent continuous ambulatory ECG recording during acute theophylline toxicity and recovery. The patients, who were recruited form inpatient wards, intensive care units, and emergency departments of a University Medical Center and a Veterans Administration Medical Center, had serum theophylline concentrations (STC) greater than 30 mg/L. There were 14 men and two women with a mean age of 66 years. Fourteen patients had COPD and developed toxicity following long-term theophylline overmedication. Two patients had asthma and ingested an intentional overdose. The STC at the onset of ECG recording ranged from 23 to 67 mg/L. The principal rhythm was sinus in 15 patients; one patient had atrial fibrillation. Sinus tachycardia (heart rate greater than 100/min) was common, and heart rate fell in proportion to STC as toxicity resolved. Supraventricular ectopic beats (SVEs) were noted in seven patients with multiple runs of SVE being present in four. One patient developed multifocal atrial tachycardia (MAT) during toxicity that resolved spontaneously. During the 11 +/- 8 hours of recording during toxicity (STC greater than 20 mg/L), 80 percent of patients had ventricular premature beats (VPBs), 44 percent had paired VPBs, and 25 percent had ventricular runs. One elderly patient with heart disease developed sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT) when STC = 66 mg/L. No other patient had ventricular ectopy that required intervention. During the 10 +/- 6 hours of recording during the \"recovery phase\" (STC less than 20 mg/L), all patients with VPBs continued to have ectopy; however, the number of VPBs declined significantly. A follow-up 24-hour ECG recording obtained one week after recovery from toxicity in the patient with sustained VT demonstrated marked reduction in the frequency and complexity of VPBs. Patients with frequent (greater than 10/h) or repetitive VPBs were older (p less than 0.05) than those without complex ectopy. There was a trend (p = 0.07) suggesting patients with underlying heart disease were at risk for having complex ventricular ectopy. We conclude that sinus tachycardia, SVE, and VPBs are common among patients with theophylline toxicity; however, sustained ventricular or supraventricular tachyarrhythmias that require antiarrhythmic therapy are uncommon.\r"

It was concluded that changes in VO2 and DO2 can occur spontaneously in patients with normal lactates, even when there are no experimental interventions. These spontaneous changes in VO2 and DO2 make it extremely difficult to interpret studies that demonstrate that VO2 is transport-limited. The changes in DO2 can likely be explained by changes in oxygen demand.\r"

Serial sections of whole alveoli from control animals and from animals sacrificed 4 h, two weeks and one month after the instillation into one lung of crude papain in saline solution containing India ink as a marker were compared. In dogs, as in humans, there is normally a zonal distribution of alveolar macrophages and type 2 cells at alveolar junctional sites. We hypothesize that early alveolar septal injury takes place at these junctional sites, judging from concentration of alveolar macrophages and interstitial septal gaps at these sites following papain exposure, and also that septal repair activities are greatest at these sites, in view of the preponderance and high prevalence of type 2 cells occupying interstitial septal gaps in junctional zones. Consequently, the type 2 cell may play a role beyond that of merely replacing type 1 epithelial cells following alveolar septal injury.\r"

During 12 weeks of prednisone treatment in a dosage of 40 mg daily, her condition markedly deteriorated clinically and hemodynamically as manifested by pulmonary artery pressure (PAP), pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR), cardiac output (CO), mixed venous O2 saturation, and systemic vascular resistance (SVR). Successive trials with various vasodilators demonstrated ineffectiveness of isosorbide dinitrate and phenoxybenzamine, whereas nifedipine was effective in a 15-mg single dose, and prazosin 1 mg was partially effective in reducing PVR, SVR, and increasing CO and mixed venous O2 saturation. The combination of nifedipine 10 mg and prazosin 0.5 mg given alternately every four hours for 48 hours was the most effective in reducing PVR and PAP. Clinical response was favorable as well until treatment with medications was discontinued due to gastrointestinal side effects one month later.\r"

Because the colon can be involved in inflammatory bowel disease, the mechanisms, kinetics, and influence of intraluminal factors on polyethylene glycol 400 permeation of perfused colonic segments of rats were studied. The absorption rate of polyethylene glycol 400 was linearly related to its luminal concentration (r = 0.94), suggesting that passive diffusion is a significant mechanism involved in polyethylene glycol 400 absorption. Changing the perfusate pH from 6.0 to 7.5 did not affect water absorption or polyethylene glycol 400 permeation. Increasing luminal osmolarity significantly decreased water and polyethylene glycol 400 absorption (P less than 0.01). The relationship between polyethylene glycol 400 and water absorption at different luminal osmolarities was linear (r = 0.97). At luminal osmolarity of 0.3 osm/L, 14.3% of polyethylene glycol 400 absorption was mediated by passive diffusion and 85.7% was mediated by convection. The solvent drag reflection coefficient for polyethylene glycol 400 in the colon was 0.03. Taurocholic acid (10 mmol/L) and chenodeoxycholic acid (5 mmol/L) decreased polyethylene glycol 400 and water absorption (P less than 0.01). Addition of 1 micrograms/mL of 16,16-dimethyl prostaglandin E2, 2 mmol/L of dibutyryladenosine-3',5'-cyclic monophosphate, or 10 mmol/L of aminophylline significantly decreased water and polyethylene glycol 400 absorption (P less than 0.01). These studies demonstrate that polyethylene glycol 400 permeation of the colon is mediated by both passive diffusion and solvent drag. Convective absorption is the major mechanism of polyethylene glycol 400 permeation of the colon. Polyethylene glycol 400 permeation is modified by bile acids, prostaglandins, and cyclic nucleotides through changes in water flux.\r"

  ".U": "90367895\r", 
  ".W": "Anorectal motor activity and rectal sensation were recorded in 12 normal male subjects during ramp distention of the rectum with water and air at randomized rates of 10, 20, 50, and 100 mL/min and during intermittent rapid distention with air. There were no significant differences between the results of ramp inflation with water or with air, and the repeated infusion of the same medium yielded reproducible results. Ramp distention induced sigmoid pressure-volume profiles. Different sensations occurred at specific points on the pressure-volume curve and were maintained until succeeded by the next sensation. Initial perception of the distention occurred during the initial steep pressure increase, the sensation of wind occurred during the plateau phase, and the desire to defecate occurred at the onset of the final rapid ascent. Rectal sensations were induced at lower volumes at low infusion rates when the slope of the pressure-volume relationship was shallower than at high infusion rates. This suggests that the receptor triggering rectal sensation is not a simple volume or pressure receptor, but is more likely to be a slowly adapting mechanoreceptor lying parallel to the circular muscle of the rectal wall. During rapid intermittent distention, the rectal volumes required to elicit rectal sensations were lower than during ramp distention, although the pressure-volume curve was steeper. Moreover, sensations often only lasted a short period of time but recurred on deflation. These data suggest activation of an additional population of rapidly adapting or high threshold mechanoreceptors. Anal relaxation was always evoked by intermittent rectal distention and was almost always associated with a rectal sensation and an increase in external anal sphincter activity. In contrast, anal relaxation could be absent or delayed during ramp inflation, especially at lower infusion rates, suggesting that internal sphincter can maintain continence for a long period of time while the rectum is slowly filling. Rectal sensation and concomitant external anal sphincter activity was not associated with anal relaxation during ramp inflation; most subjects felt the sensation long after the pressure reached its lowest level. However, under all circumstances the onset of rectal sensation was associated with an increase of external anal sphincter electrical activity. In conclusion, the rectal sensory and anorectal motor responses to distention depend on the rate and pattern of distention, which may activate a different population of receptors. Results from different laboratories cannot be compared directly unless the pattern and rate of distension are the same.\r"

  ".W": "Because even after low doses of fructose and sorbitol, fructose-sorbitol malabsorption has been found in a high number of patients with the irritable bowel syndrome, an etiological role of fructose-sorbitol malabsorption in the irritable bowel syndrome has been suggested. However, these studies have been uncontrolled. Therefore, a controlled study of fructose-sorbitol malabsorption in the irritable bowel syndrome compared with healthy controls was performed. Seventy-three patients, 23 men and 50 women with a mean age 43.1 +/- 1.7 years (range, 18-66 years) with the irritable bowel syndrome were compared with 87 age- and sex-matched control subjects. Fructose-sorbitol malabsorption was determined by a breath-hydrogen test (Lactoscreen, Hoek Loos, Schiedam, The Netherlands) following an oral load of 25 g fructose and 5 g sorbitol after a 10-hour fast. Fructose-sorbitol malabsorption, as shown by an H2 peak of 20 ppm over basal values, was found in 22 (30.1%) of the patients and 35 (40.2%) of the control subjects. With a lower peak level of 10 ppm over basal values, these percentages were 45.2% and 57.5%, respectively. Also, the highest H2 peak values (15.2 +/- 2.3 ppm vs. 21.5 +/- 2.6 ppm), time to reach peak levels (110.7 +/- 5.4 min vs. 107.1 +/- 5.9 min), and area under the H2 curve (1310 +/- 219 ppm.min vs. 1812 +/- 255 ppm.min) did not discriminate between patients and controls. During the test, symptoms developed in 31 of 70 patients and in 3 of 85 control subjects (P less than 0.0001). Symptomatic patients did not differ from asymptomatic patients regarding the presence or absence of fructose-sorbitol malabsorption, H2 peak values, and area under the curve. No differences could be identified between male and female patients or controls. In conclusion, fructose-sorbitol malabsorption is frequently seen in patients with irritable bowel syndrome, but this is not different from observations in healthy volunteers. Therefore, fructose-sorbitol malabsorption does not seem to play an important role in the etiology of irritable bowel syndrome.\r"

At endoscopy, low-grade dysplasia was detected in seven patients, high-grade in four, and a carcinoma (Dukes' stage A at operation) in one. One of the patients with high-grade dysplasia and macroscopical lesions at colonoscopy had a carcinoma (Dukes' A) detected at operation. A sequential development of dysplasia was found in seven patients. The cumulative risk of developing at least low-grade dysplasia was 14% after 25 years of disease duration. Using flow cytometric analyses, abnormal, aneuploid DNA content was detected in biopsies of 12 of 59 patients (20.3%); this correlated significantly with low-grade and high-grade dysplasia. Aneuploidy preceded dysplasia in two patients and was also detected in two dysplasia-free patients. The long-term use of colonoscopic surveillance in ulcerative colitis is a reliable way to select patients, in whom dysplasia is developing, for prophylactic surgery. Additionally, flow cytometric DNA analyses may help in the selection. The risk of missing a carcinoma until it becomes incurable appears to be low.\r"

To measure a possible association, 46 incident cases of ulcerative colitis patients, women aged 18-50 years, were compared with peer-nominated age-matched and sex-matched controls. There were no differences between case and control patients in demographic characteristics. There was no association between oral contraceptive use and ulcerative colitis (current use: odds ratio 0.70, 95% confidence interval 0.27-1.83; former use: odds ratio 1.14, confidence interval 0.41-3.15; current or former use: odds ratio 0.86, confidence interval 0.40-1.85). Stratifying by disease location (pancolitis or left-sided disease) also failed to identify an association. Controlling for possible confounding effects of cigarette smoking did not alter the lack of association between oral contraceptive use and ulcerative colitis. Similarly, testing for interaction failed to demonstrate any effect modification. Analyzing for duration of current oral contraceptive use or time interval since last use failed to demonstrate a \"dose-response\" effect. The study was of sufficient size to detect statistical significance for oral contraceptive use for odds ratios of 2.8 and higher. In this matched case-control study of incident cases and community controls, there was no association between oral contraceptive use and ulcerative colitis incidence. To date, there is no evidence suggesting that women predisposed to the development of ulcerative colitis should be advised to avoid oral contraceptive use.\r"

Hepatic microsomes and mitochondria, isolated by differential centrifugation, showed similar enrichment and recovery among all experimental groups. Evidence of in vivo peroxidation of membrane lipids (generation of conjugated dienes and thiobarbituric acid reacting substances) was present in mitochondrial but not microsomal preparations from copper-overloaded rats. Serum aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, and cholylglycine (which were increased in all copper-overloaded rats), as well as mitochondrial thiobarbituric acid-reacting substances, were more elevated in vitamin E-deficient rats. In copper-overloaded rats, liver histology showed changes of acute and chronic hepatocyte injury with mild periportal fibrosis; electron microscopy showed abundant copper-containing lysosomes and dilated cristae of hepatocyte mitochondria, findings similar to those in the liver of humans with copper-overload disorders. These findings suggest that an oxidant injury to hepatocyte mitochondria may be one of the initiating factors in hepatocellular damage that leads to hepatic lesions in copper-overload states in humans.\r"

  ".W": "The sulfation of tyrosine is a common posttranslational modification of peptides and may regulate the biological activity of a peptide. The biological activity of cholecystokinin is dependent on sulfation at the tyrosyl residue. Study of the enzyme(s) responsible for this activation step should provide the basis for future studies of the posttranslational control of peptide biological activity. The experiments reported here were designed to determine the subcellular distribution and biochemical properties of tyrosyl-sulfotransferase activity in normal human liver tissue. tert-Butoxycarbonylcholecystokinin octapeptide (desulfated) served as the sulfate-acceptor substrate. Subcellular distribution studies showed that tyrosyl-sulfotransferase activity was localized to the membrane-bound fraction. Tyrosylsulfotransferase was characterized by a pH optimum of 5.8, and activity was increased in the presence of sodium chloride and manganese chloride. The addition of detergents inhibited this enzyme activity. Using the optimized assay conditions, tyrosylsulfotransferase was measured in 20 individual human liver samples. Twenty-fold interindividual variation was found--variation that may be related to individual differences in the degree of posttranslational sulfation of proteins. The level of tyrosylsulfotransferase activity did not correlate with the levels of activity of two soluble sulfotransferases, thermostable and thermolabile phenol sulfotransferase. These results provide the basis for future studies to determine the role of sulfation of peptides in humans and whether individual variations in tyrosylsulfotransferase activities correlate with individual differences in the degree of sulfate conjugation of peptides.\r"

  ".W": "Liver biopsy with measurement of hepatic iron concentration is the most certain procedure for evaluation of iron-storage disease, although use of computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging procedures recently have been proposed as alternative, noninvasive methods for estimating the degree of iron overload. The results of these imaging procedures were compared with those of other noninvasive techniques and liver biopsies in 48 patients. Final diagnoses, based on synthesis of clinical and laboratory data, included (a) primary hemochromatosis (n = 25; 19 homozygous, 6 heterozygous); (b) secondary hemochromatosis (n = 7); (c) alcoholic liver disease (n = 11); (d) chronic active hepatitis (n = 3); and (e) other (n = 2). Serum ferritin and computed tomography or magnetic resonance scanning had 100% sensitivity in detecting hepatic iron overload more than fivefold above the upper limit of normal (greater than 10.7 mumol Fe/100 mg dry liver) but did not detect lesser degrees of iron overload reliably, including those found in 6 of 13 patients with untreated homozygous primary hemochromatosis and 3 of 7 with secondary hemochromatosis. Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging were more specific than ferritin (64% and 92% vs. 21%) in the detection of iron excess, more than five times the upper limit of normal. Among magnetic resonance imaging measures, the ratio of the second echo signal intensities of liver to paraspinous muscle was the most sensitive and most specific for detection of this degree of iron overload. The degree of correlation between hepatic iron concentration and results of noninvasive laboratory or imaging studies were insufficient to permit prediction of hepatic iron content by noninvasive studies alone. It is concluded that computed tomography or magnetic resonance scanning as currently usually used is not cost-effective in routine evaluation of iron overload, although these imaging procedures may play a role in patients in whom liver biopsy is contraindicated. Because of their low cost and ready availability, serum ferritin and transferrin saturation tests remain the preferred screening studies for iron overload. Liver biopsy with quantitative iron measurement remains the study of choice for the definitive diagnosis of hemochromatosis.\r"

Because \"lagodeoxycholic acid,\" the 12 beta-hydroxy epimer of deoxycholic acid, is also more hydrophilic than deoxycholic acid, it was hypothesized that it should also be less hepatotoxic than deoxycholic acid. To test this, lagodeoxycholic acid was synthesized, and its transport and metabolism were examined in the rat, rabbit, and hamster. The taurine conjugate of lagodeoxycholic acid was moderately well transported by the perfused rat ileum (Tmax = 2 mumol/min.kg). In rats and hamsters with biliary fistulas, the taurine conjugate of lagodeoxycholic acid was well transported by the liver with a Tmax greater than 20 mumol/min.kg; for the taurine conjugate of deoxycholic acid, doses infused at a rate greater than 2.5 mumol/min.kg are known to cause cholestasis and death. Hepatic biotransformation of lagodeoxycholic acid in the rabbit was limited to conjugation with glycine; in the hamster, lagodeoxycholic acid was conjugated with glycine or taurine; in addition, 7-hydroxylation occurred to a slight extent (approximately 10%). When lagodeoxycholic acid was instilled in the rabbit colon, it was absorbed as such although within hours it was progressively epimerized by bacteria to deoxycholic acid. When injected intravenously and allowed to circulate enterohepatically, lagodeoxycholic acid was largely epimerized to deoxycholic acid in 24 hours. Surgical creation of a distal ileostomy abolished epimerization in the rabbit, indicating that exposure to colonic bacterial enzymes was required for the epimerization. Lagodeoxycholic acid was administered for 3 weeks at a dose of 180 mumol/day (0.1% by weight of a chow diet; 2-4 times the endogenous bile acid synthesis rate); other groups received identical doses of deoxycholic acid (hamster) or cholyltaurine, a known precursor of deoxycholic acid (rabbit). After 3 weeks of lagodeoxycholic acid ingestion, liver test results and liver appearance were normal. The total bile acid pool expanded by 37% in the rabbit, lagodeoxycholic acid composing 10% of biliary bile acids. In the hamster, the total bile acid pool was expanded by 95%, lagodeoxycholic acid composing 22% of biliary bile acids; biliary lipid secretion remained unchanged. Tracer studies indicated that the fractional turnover rate of lagodeoxycholic acid was high (157%/day, rabbit; 116%/day, hamster) because of its rapid epimerization to deoxycholic acid in the colon. These studies indicate that lagodeoxycholic acid, the more hydrophilic epimer of deoxycholic acid, is transported and metabolized as other dihydroxy bile acids but is much less toxic than deoxycholic acid.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The mechanisms responsible for ethanol-associated inhibition of liver regeneration are poorly understood but may involve the modulation of protooncogene expression. To test this hypothesis, the steady-state messenger RNA levels of several protooncogenes involved in cellular proliferation were measured in livers obtained from ethanol-fed rats and isocalorically maintained controls before and during surgically-induced liver regeneration. Regeneration was significantly inhibited in ethanol-fed rats as evidenced by delayed induction of ornithine decarboxylase activity and reduced thymidine incorporation, mitotic index, and restoration of liver mass after partial hepatectomy. As previously reported, partial hepatectomy induced the time-dependent expression of mRNA for c-fos, c-myc, and c-Ha-ras. However, the transcript levels of these protooncogenes were indistinguishable in ethanol and control livers at various time points between 0-72 hours after partial hepatectomy. Although regeneration after partial hepatectomy is significantly delayed in ethanol-fed rats, the transcription of certain protooncogenes, which encode for both DNA-binding and signal-transducing proteins, appears to proceed normally. Consequently, ethanol-associated impairment of liver regeneration cannot be explained by altered transcription of these protooncogenes. The results suggest that either the expression of these protooncogenes alone may not be sufficient to trigger liver regeneration or that ethanol inhibits protooncogene-mediated events at posttranscriptional levels.\r"

  ".W": "Some patients with type B chronic active hepatitis have a high titer of hepatitis B virus DNA despite antibody against e antigen in the serum. Clones of hepatitis B virus were propagated from the sera of seven patients with this disease, and the precore region was sequenced. Essentially all clones (128/131 or 98%) showed a point mutation from guanine to adenine at nucleotide 83, converting codon 28 for tryptophan (TGG) to a stop codon (TAG); the second guanine-to-adenine point mutation at nucleotide 86 was identified in only 29 clones from two patients. In patients followed up since they had hepatitis B e antigen, a shift from guanine to adenine was observed at nucleotide 83 along with the seroconversion to the antibody to e antigen. The precore-region product is required for the synthesis and secretion of e antigen from hepatocytes. A point mutation from guanine to adenine at nucleotide 83 observed in the seven patients, therefore, would be responsible for disturbed secretion of e antigen.\r"

  ".W": "Little is known about exocrine pancreatic secretory function in patients with acute pancreatitis, in particular during the early phase of the disease. Therefore, this study evaluates basal and stimulated pancreatic secretion in vivo and in vitro in four different models of acute pancreatitis which reflect its clinical spectrum of severity: (a) edematous pancreatitis induced in the rat by seven IP injections of 50 micrograms/kg cerulein at hourly intervals; (b) edematous pancreatitis with cellular necrosis induced in the mouse by seven IP injections of 50 micrograms/kg cerulein at hourly intervals; (c) hemorrhagic pancreatitis induced in the mouse by feeding an ethionine-supplemented, choline-deficient diet for 66 hours; and (d) hemorrhagic pancreatitis induced in the rat by retrograde infusion of 0.6 mL 5% sodium taurocholate into the pancreatic duct. Secretory studies were performed in vivo and in vitro at various times after onset of pancreatitis. The results show that the exocrine pancreas gradually became resistant to cholecystokinin stimulation after the onset of acute pancreatitis in all four animal models. Cholecystokinin-stimulated secretion was almost abolished in vivo and in vitro at the time of maximal histological damage. In vivo basal secretion was also reduced. In vitro there was an increase in basal release of amylase from isolated acini that was not caused by an increase in luminal secretion but by enzyme release from damaged cells. The time course of improvement of secretory function after acute experimental pancreatitis depended on the severity of the pancreatitis. Recovery of secretory capacity took longer after severe necrotizing pancreatitis than after edematous pancreatitis. However, the ultimate resolution of secretory function was remarkable, in particular after severe hemorrhagic pancreatitis. In all four models, secretory capacity became indistinguishable from normal before the morphological alterations had completely resolved. The present experimental data suggest that pancreatic secretion, and particularly pancreatic secretory response to cholecystokinin, may also be reduced in patients early after the onset of acute pancreatitis.\r"

This technique was evaluated in 25 complex patients whose stones, usually because of large size, did not respond to standard nonoperative treatment. The laser imaging was applied through a quartz fiber and aimed either under direct vision with choledochoscopes passed percutaneously or through a special \"mother\" duodenoscope or under fluoroscopic guidance at standard duodenoscopy. Laser treatment resulted in some fragmentation of stones in 23 cases. Subsequently, it proved that it was possible to clear the bile duct of stones in 20 patients, 12 of them receiving successful treatment during the same endoscopic procedure. There were no significant complications. This endoscopic technique seems to be a useful new alternative to surgery in patients with large and difficult bile duct stones.\r"

Although most of the patients had a bone mineral density within the normal range, the bone mineral densities of the lumbar spine and distal and proximal forearm were 8% (P less than 0.004), 8% (P less than 0.03), and 5% (NS) respectively, lower than in age-matched healthy women. Multiple regression analysis showed that the histological stage of the liver disease (early stage vs. late stage) was an independent determinant of axial bone mineral density, whereas the use of glucocorticoids resulted in only a moderate and not significant bone loss. Serum calcium proved to be significantly lower in the patients with late-stage primary biliary cirrhosis than in those with early-stage disease, whereas no significant differences were found in these groups with regard to several biochemical parameters of bone metabolism. In conclusion, in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis, bone loss was only moderate and related to the histological stage. The effect of low-dose glucocorticoids on bone mass seemed not significant.\r"

Cytoplasmic pH (pHi) was measured using the pH-sensitive fluorescence dye 2',7'-bis(2-carboxyethyl)-5 (and -6) carboxyfluorescein acetoxymethyl ester. Cells were acidified to the desired pHi by suspension in solutions with varying external pH (pHo) in the presence of nigericin. When cells acidified to pHi 6.3 were suspended in a choline chloride solution (pHo 7.4), cytoplasmic pHi did not increase. In contrast, Nao+ caused a concentration-dependent increase in the rate of cytoplasmic alkalinization with saturation occurring above 50 mmol/L Nao+. The transporter behaved according to first-order Michaelis-Menten type kinetics with respect to external Na+ and had an apparent Km for Nao+ of 38.4 mmol/L. In contrast, the transporter behaved with greater than first-order kinetics with respect to external Na+ and had an apparent Km for Nao+ of 38.4 mmol/L. In contrast, the transporter behaved with greater than first-order kinetics with respect to cytoplasmic hydrogen ion concentration. Amiloride (10(-4) mol/L) caused a reversible inhibition of Na(+)-dependent alkalinization. Amiloride-sensitive cytoplasmic alkalinization was not observed when either cholineo or Ko+ was substituted for Nao+, while Lio+ resulted in alkalinization that was 60% +/- 8% of that seen with equimolar concentrations of Nao+. The basal pHi of cells suspended in a bicarbonate-free 130 mmol/L NaCl solution (pHo 7.4) averaged 7.42 +/- 0.03 (n = 10); amiloride (10(-4) mmol/L caused the basal pHi to decrease to 7.26 +/- 0.05 (n = 10; P less than 0.0025). When cells were suspended in a choline chloride (pHo 7.4) solution, pHi averaged 7.29 +/- 0.06 (n = 10) (P less than 0.0025 compared with Nao+). These studies indicate that nucleated esophageal cells obtained from rabbits possess an amiloride-sensitive Na+,H+ antiport that functions to regulate basal pHi and responds to intracellular acidification.\r"

  ".W": "In this study, two different methods were used to investigate the prevalence of columnar-lined (Barrett's) esophagus. First, a population-based study of clinically diagnosed cases was performed in Olmsted County, Minnesota. Twenty-five residents of this county, who had undergone endoscopy and biopsy between 1969 and 1986, were diagnosed as having Barrett's esophagus. On January 1, 1987, 17 of these patients were still living in the county, representing an age- and sex-adjusted prevalence rate of 22.6 cases per 100,000 population (95% confidence interval, 11.7-33.6 cases). A prospective search of Mayo Clinic autopsy material for Barrett's esophagus was conducted using the same diagnostic criteria as in the clinical study. Over an 18-month period ending in September 1987, 7 cases of Barrett's esophagus were found in 733 unselected autopsies. In 5 of the 7 cases, Barrett's esophagus was first detected at the time of autopsy. Using the age- and sex-specific prevalence from the clinically diagnosed study, researchers expected to find 0.19 cases of Barrett's esophagus at the 226 autopsies performed on Olmsted County residents, although 4 were actually observed (P less than 0.001). This approximately 21-fold increase (95% confidence interval, 5-54 cases) corresponds to an autopsy estimated prevalence of 376 cases per 100,000 population (95% confidence interval, 95-967 cases). In conclusion, a majority of cases of Barrett's esophagus, a condition that predisposes to esophageal malignancy, remains unrecognized in the general population.\r"

Both rapid emptying and a narrow extracellular space seem to contribute to the early dumping syndrome.\r"

  ".W": "The enterochromaffinlike cells in the rat stomach are rich in histamine and are thought to be under the influence of gastrin. The effect of sustained endogenous and exogenous hypergastrinemia on the activity and proliferation rate of the enterochromaffinlike cells was studied by determining the histidine decarboxylase activity and histamine concentration and by combining histamine immunocytochemistry and autoradiography after in vivo labeling with [3H]thymidine. The proliferation rate of the stem cells in the oxyntic mucosal progenitor zone was also studied. Exogenous hypergastrinemia was induced by infusion of rat gastrin-17 (60 nmol.kg-1.day-1). Endogenous hypergastrinemia was induced by inhibition of gastric acid secretion with omeprazole (80 mumol.kg-1.day-1) or ranitidine (1200 mumol.kg-1.day-1). The effect of omeprazole was also studied in antrectomized rats. In intact rats, all treatments resulted in elevated plasma gastrin levels and were accompanied by an increase in the histidine decarboxylase activity and the histamine content of the oxyntic mucosa. This resulted in an increase in the enterochromaffinlike cell proliferation rate, leading to enterochromaffinlike cell hyperplasia. The number of labeled stem cells was increased, but this effect was not as pronounced as in the enterochromaffinlike cells. In antrectomized rats, the inhibition of acid secretion by omeprazole did not result in elevated plasma gastrin or in an increase in the activity or number of enterochromaffinlike cells, indicating that omeprazole per se had no effect on these cells. These data support the view that gastrin stimulates the proliferation rate of both enterochromaffinlike cells and stem cells. Gastrin also stimulates the activity of the enterochromaffinlike cells.\r"

  ".W": "In 1983, all trials of omeprazole in humans were stopped because rats given the drug developed gastric endocrine cell hyperplasia and carcinoid tumors. Further studies in rats showed that drug-induced achlorhydria and hypergastrinemia caused these changes. Because data in humans are limited, we compared the numbers of endocrine cells, as judged by silver staining (argyrophilia), in the gastric mucosa of patients with Zollinger-Ellison syndrome, who are hypergastrinemic, and in normogastrinemic patients with idiopathic acid-peptic diseases. In addition, we analyzed the number of gastric endocrine cells in patients with Zollinger-Ellison syndrome given omeprazole for up to 3 years. Patients with Zollinger-Ellison syndrome had 15.7% +/- 6.9% argyrophil cells in biopsies of gastric oxyntic mucosa, and patients with idiopathic acid-peptic disease had 7.8% +/- 2.3% (P less than 0.01). In patients with Zollinger-Ellison syndrome, the percentage of argyrophil cells was not related to serum gastrin concentration, duration of symptoms, time since diagnosis, basal or maximal acid output, extent of tumor, or age. There was a tendency for patients with multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 to have a greater percent of argyrophil cells than patients with sporadic Zollinger-Ellison syndrome. Considering the biopsies from both normogastrinemic and hypergastrinemic patients, there was a significant relationship between the percentage of argyrophil cells and the serum concentration of gastrin (P less than 0.01). Patients with Zollinger-Ellison syndrome given omeprazole for up to 3 years developed no significant changes in percentage of argyrophil cells, no carcinoid tumors, and no changes in serum concentrations of gastrin. The present study shows that patients with Zollinger-Ellison syndrome have an increased percentage of argyrophil cells in oxyntic mucosa and that omeprazole does not increase this percentage. In periods of up to 3 years, omeprazole had no effects on gastric morphology in patients with Zollinger-Ellison syndrome.\r"

Because prostaglandins of the E class increase human proximal duodenal bicarbonate secretion, this study tested the hypothesis that endogenous prostaglandin E2 production is defective in patients with duodenal ulcer. Ten patients, five with active and five with inactive duodenal ulcer disease, were studied along with 10 normal volunteers. The proximal 4 cm of duodenum, the bulb, was isolated and continuously perfused with 154 mmol/L NaCl. Basal bicarbonate secretion was measured for 30 minutes. The test segment was then acidified with a physiological amount of HCl (2 mmol over 5 minutes), and acid-stimulated bicarbonate secretion was measured by pH/PCO2 and back-titration for 55 more minutes. Prostaglandin E2 was measured in the effluents by a radioimmunologic assay validated by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Compared with the normal subjects after luminal acidification, the duodenal ulcer patients had significantly greater PGE2 release and decreased total 1-hour bicarbonate output. The peak 5-minute acid-stimulated bicarbonate responses were not significantly different between the duodenal ulcer patients and normal subjects. After luminal acidification, PGE2 output remained elevated in the duodenal ulcer patients but returned promptly to basal in the normal subjects. Furthermore, the ratio of bicarbonate secreted to the amount of PGE2 released was significantly less in the ulcer patients. These findings suggest that patients with duodenal ulcer disease have an impaired mucosal bicarbonate response to endogenous PGE2. The increased acid-stimulated PGE2 response in duodenal ulcer patients suggests a compensatory phenomenon in response to the diminished mucosal bicarbonate production.\r"

Recurrent lesions were observed endoscopically in the neoterminal ileum within 1 year of surgery in 73% of the patients, although only 20% of the patients had symptoms. Three years after surgery, the endoscopic recurrence rate had increased to 85% and symptomatic recurrence occurred in 34%. The ultimate course of the disease was best predicted by the severity of the early postoperative lesions, as observed at ileoscopy. Clinical parameters that influenced outcome were preoperative disease activity, the indication for surgery, and the number of surgical resections. When patients were stratified for preoperative disease activity, the severity of lesions found at endoscopy remained a strong predictive factor for symptomatic recurrence. In 22 other patients submitted to \"curative\" ileal resection and ileocolonic anastomosis, the segment to be used as neoterminal ileum was carefully examined during surgery, and two large biopsies were taken before making the anastomosis. An ileoscopy was performed 6 months after surgery. Although all patients had a macroscopically normal neoterminal ileum and 19 had entirely normal biopsies at the time of surgery, 21 patients were found at ileoscopy to have developed ileitis involving a 15-cm segment (range, 4-30 cm), and 20 had unequivocal microscopic lesions on biopsies. These studies suggest that early lesions in the neoterminal ileum after Crohn's resection do not originate from microscopic inflammation present in this bowel segment at the time of surgery. The early postoperative lesions in the neoterminal ileum seem to be a suitable model to study the pathogenesis of Crohn's disease and also to evaluate new therapeutic modalities, either to prevent development of these early lesions or to treat progressive recurrence.\r"

In the proximal small intestine at pH 5.5 and 6.5, [3H]folic acid accumulated to concentrations 2.64- and 2.17-fold higher than those of the medium, respectively, but at pH 7.5 the concentration was same as that of the medium. Saturability of initial rates of uptake was demonstrable with respect to luminal concentrations of [H+] and folic acid. Two proton-dependent transport mechanisms were evident: (a) a carrier with a low affinity for H+ and a low capacity for folic acid, and (b) a high-affinity, high-capacity carrier (Km, 635 and 54.6 nmol/L [H+]; Vmax, 0.066 and 2.583 pmol folic acid/microL intracellular water per 10 minutes, respectively). Kinetic studies of folic acid uptake at pH 5.5 and 7.5 revealed a difference in Km for folic acid (15.76 and 34.38 mumol/L, respectively) with no change in Vmax. In the colon, folic acid did not accumulate against a concentration gradient, and the initial rate of uptake was not affected by luminal pH. The accumulation of folic acid in colonic mucosa was significantly higher at pH 5.5 than at 7.5 and showed significant regional variation, with optimal uptake in the sigmoid colon. Methotrexate inhibited folic acid uptake competitively both in the proximal small intestine and in the cecum (inhibition constant 6.9 and 54 mumol/L, respectively, at pH 5.5). These data indicate the presence of a proton-dependent, active transport of folic acid in the proximal small intestine at pH 5.0-6.5. At pH 7.5 and in the mucosa of the colon, uptake of folic acid proceeds by facilitated diffusion through a low-affinity carrier.\r"

In contrast, cereals well tolerated in celiac disease (i.e., rice and maize) do not. Furthermore, purified A-gliadin peptides that damage in vitro-cultured flat celiac mucosa are powerful agglutinins for K 562(S) cells, whereas A-gliadin peptides that do not show any adverse in vitro effect on celiac intestine lack agglutinating activity. Mannan, acetylglucosamine, and its oligomers (N,N'-diacetylchitobiose and N,N',N\"-triacetylchitotriose) were able to prevent and reverse cell agglutination induced by peptides from all the toxic cereals. Moreover, mannan and N,N',N\"-triacetylchitotriose exhibited a protective effect on intestinal mucosa specimens of patients with active celiac disease cultured with wheat protein-derived peptides. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that the agglutinating and toxic peptides are bound by carbohydrates.\r"

  ".W": "We have previously shown that injection of platelet-activating factor causes necrotizing enterocolitis in the rat and that platelet-activating factor is an endogenous mediator in lipopolysaccharide-induced bowel necrosis. Because hypoxia is a known predisposing factor for neonatal necrotizing enterocolitis, we investigated the effect of hypoxia on platelet-activating factor formation and intestinal necrosis. Young male Sprague-Dawley rats were made severely hypoxic by placing them in a 100% N2 chamber for 2 minutes; moderate hypoxia was accomplished using 10% O2 for 15 or 30 minutes. To evaluate the role of platelet-activating factor on intestinal perfusion and injury, two platelet-activating factor antagonists, SRI 63-441 and WEB 2086, were injected 10 minutes before the hypoxic exposure. We found that plasma platelet-activating factor levels were significantly elevated after 2 minutes of severe hypoxia (13.8 +/- 2.9 ng/mL vs. control 2.1 +/- 0.8 ng/mL) and after 30 minutes of moderate hypoxia (41.1 +/- 11.7 ng/mL). This increase in platelet-activating factor level was not caused by decreased degradation, because neither plasma nor intestinal platelet-activating factor acetylhydrolase was decreased in the hypoxic rats. (Intestinal acetylhydrolase activity was actually increased). Intestinal perfusion was markedly decreased at 30 minutes in hypoxic animals. In contrast, all platelet-activating factor antagonist-treated animals had normal intestinal perfusion. Histological examination of affected bowel from hypoxic animals showed early intestinal necrosis which was completely prevented by pretreatment with SRI 63-441 and WEB 2086. Because 30 minutes of hypoxia also resulted in metabolic acidosis, we further investigated if acidosis alone could induce platelet-activating factor release and bowel injury. We found that acidosis alone resulted in moderate increase of plasma platelet-activating factor but did not produce bowel injury. We conclude that platelet-activating factor plays a central role in mediating hypoxia-induced intestinal necrosis. Acidosis may enhance the effect of hypoxia on platelet-activating factor production.\r"

Inflammatory bowel disease was associated with reduced fertility as measured by number of pregnancies, but measures of childlessness, infertility, fecundability, and methods of birth control suggested that this reduced fertility was the patients' choice rather than a consequence of disease-mediated biological impairments. There was no evidence of increased risk of pregnancy loss, but the risk of preterm birth was significantly elevated for patients with Crohn's disease (odds ratio, 3.1; 95% confidence interval, 1.8-5.4) and for those with ulcerative colitis (odds ratio, 2.7; 95% confidence interval, 1.8-5.4). Several plausible biological mechanisms that could explain the link between preterm birth and inflammatory bowel disease are suggested. These results may be useful when counseling patients who desire pregnancy. Physicians can reassure patients about potential fertility problems but should also encourage close obstetrical monitoring during the third trimester of pregnancy.\r"

  ".W": "Hirschsprung's disease, induced by aganglionosis of the distal intestinal tract, results in significant morbidity in affected children. This study uses a murine model of congenital aganglionosis in the distal colon to determine the effects of this type of obstruction on the proximal colon. In lethal spotted mice (Ls/Ls) there is a greater increase in the thickness of circular muscle (in the obstructed colon immediately proximal to the aganglionic region) than longitudinal muscle compared with controls. The active forces generated in vitro, as determined by length-tension curves of the circular muscle, are larger than in control littermates, and isolated muscle cells from the area proximal to the obstruction are larger and shorten to a significantly greater degree in response to acetylcholine. These data are consistent with increased muscle mass subsequent to hypertrophy, although simultaneously occurring hyperplasia cannot be excluded. However, the increased forces that developed are not entirely explained by increased muscle mass. When forces are normalized per cross-sectional unit of circular muscle present in the obstructed rings, stress is considerably higher in the rings proximal to the obstruction than in matched rings from obstruction-free littermates. Pressure-diameter relationships calculated from in vitro data show that the Ls/Ls colon is capable of exerting higher intraluminal pressures than the control colon. The increases in circular muscle thickness, forces, and stress are similar to those observed in other models of obstruction. The increased pressure-diameter relationships observed in the colon are unlike an experimental model of obstruction in the ureter and may reflect longstanding obstruction or a difference in response of colonic muscle to obstruction. It is possible that these mechanical changes may affect the course of Hirschsprung's disease.\r"

However, analysis of recent Census data suggests inequality is greatest among elderly people. The worst off one-fifth of the elderly (disproportionately unmarried women, minorities, and the physically impaired) receives 5.5% of the elderly's total resources, whereas the best off one-fifth receives 46%. Equalizing effects of Social Security are more than outweighed by private pensions, asset income, and other sources. Findings suggest a process of cumulative economic advantage and disadvantage throughout the life course.\r"

Many key officials and providers advocate regulatory reform by extending licensure to unlicensed agencies and providers. Competing special interest groups have not developed a consensus about regulation, leading to a political stalemate. Research has not determined differences in quality, access, and costs of licensed and unlicensed home care providers.\r"

By all four definitions, the crude prevalence of hypertension in both sexes was lower in Mexican-Americans than in non-Hispanic whites, although only two of the eight pairwise comparisons were statistically significant. However, after adjusting for the potentially confounding effects of age, body mass index, and non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, Mexican-Americans did have a statistically significant lower prevalence of both systolic and diastolic hypertension than did non-Hispanic whites in both sexes (odds ratios ranging from 0.66 to 0.71 depending on the definition of hypertension). The cause of this lower prevalence is unknown, but study of this ethnic group with elevated levels of risk factors for hypertension (obesity, hyperinsulinemia, and diabetes) may provide additional insights into the etiology of hypertension.\r"

  ".W": "Twenty-two patients with normal plasma renin and essential hypertension were classified as \"salt-sensitive\" (SS) (n = 9) or \"non-salt-sensitive\" (NSS) (n = 13) from an increase in mean blood pressure with changes in sodium intake from 25 to 250 meq/day. With the high sodium diet, the SS patients gained more weight (p less than 0.05), retained more sodium (p less than 0.05), and had a greater increase in cardiac output (p less than 0.05). Despite the markedly increased cardiac output, systemic vascular resistance did not change with sodium loads in the SS patients, whereas the NSS patients had a significant decrease in systemic vascular resistance. Thus, the greater increase in blood pressure with sodium loads in SS patients can be attributed not only to an increase in cardiac output, possibly resulting from greater sodium retention, but also to inappropriately elevated systemic vascular resistance. Concomitant with a greater increase in cardiac output, the SS patients had a greater increase in forearm blood flow with sodium loading than the NSS patients (p less than 0.02). In contrast, blood flow to the kidney and the liver was not significantly changed in either group; renal (p less than 0.05) and hepatic (p less than 0.01) vascular resistance increased significantly in SS patients but remained unchanged in NSS patients. Thus, evidence presented suggests that the greater increase in blood pressure with sodium loads seems to be characterized by a very inhomogenous distribution of local flow and resistance in SS patients; renal and hepatic blood flow remains essentially unchanged and skeletal muscle blood flow receives almost all of the increase in cardiac output. Moreover, systemic vascular resistance changes did not reflect the resistance of individual beds because vasoconstriction appeared in the kidney and the splanchnic area but was masked by prominent vasodilation in the skeletal muscle. Because this hemodynamic pattern is similar to the pattern evoked during defense reaction, it is suggested that sympathetic overactivity on a selective basis might be involved in the impaired renal function for sodium excretion and the increase in blood pressure with sodium loads in SS patients.\r"

In the presence of 2.5 mM Ca2+ in the bathing solution, aortic [Ca2+]i measured with fura-2 was higher in SHR than in WKY rats, and it was almost the same in CS-622-treated SHR and untreated WKY rats. Increase of external Ca2+ concentration from zero to 2.5 mM elicited a contraction in SHR aortas but not in aortas from both CS-622-treated SHR and untreated WKY rats. When the aortas were contracted by 60 mM K+, however, [Ca2+]i as well as developed tension was similar in the three groups. CGP-28392 (10(-6) M), a Ca2+ channel activator, induced a rhythmic activity superimposed on a gradual increase of [Ca2+]i and tension in SHR aortas but not in the aortas of CS-622-treated SHR or untreated WKY rats. Nicardipine (10(-7) M) decreased the resting [Ca2+]i and the resting tone in SHR aortas, but not in WKY rat aortas. These results suggest that SHR aortas have a higher myogenic tone due to increased [Ca2+]i than WKY rat aortas and that the increased [Ca2+]i is attributed to alterations of dihydropyridine-sensitive Ca2+ channels in SHR aortas. Further, the decrease of the vascular tone induced by long-term administration of the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor may be due to a reduction of increased [Ca2+]i in SHR.\r"

The drug was stopped and observations continued for another 16-21 weeks. At selected times, we measured blood pressure, in vitro hindquarter vascular resistance properties, left ventricular weight/body weight ratio, and skeletal muscle vessel norepinephrine kinetics in treated and untreated SHR and in Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats. At the end of each treatment period, all cardiovascular variables were close to values of WKY rats and well below those of untreated SHR, and the norepinephrine or fractional rate constant was about 25% below those levels. After enalapril was stopped, blood pressure and left ventricular weight/body weight ratio increased in parallel to levels ranging from 30% to 50% of the normal difference between untreated SHR and WKY rats. However, in SHR treated from 4 to 9 weeks and from 4 to 14 weeks of age, hindquarter resistance properties remained close to WKY rat levels for the entire observation period of 16-21 weeks after treatment, suggesting suppression of the enhanced resistance responses of SHR (amplifier properties). In SHR treated from 14 to 20 weeks of age, suppression of amplifier properties was more transient, and they redeveloped partially 5-6 weeks after cessation of therapy. When enalapril was given up to 14 weeks of age, the long-term suppression of amplifier properties was probably mainly through prevention of smooth muscle hypertrophy in resistance vessels and possibly through other mechanisms (e.g., \"rarefaction\").(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Blood pressure was significantly higher from 12 to 20 weeks in the male offspring derived from WKY mothers x SHR fathers as compared with male offspring derived from SHR mothers X WKY fathers (180 +/- 4 versus 160 +/- 5 mm Hg, p less than 0.01). There was no significant difference between the blood pressure of the F1 females, further supporting Y chromosome linkage and not parental imprinting. The blood pressure data from F2 males derived from reciprocal crosses of parental strains were consistent with the presence of a Y-linked locus, but not with an X-linked locus controlling blood pressure. The data strongly suggest that hypertension in the SHR has two primary components of equal magnitude, one consisting of a small number of autosomal loci with a second Y-linked component.\r"

An indwelling femoral arterial catheter was placed for blood sampling and measurement of blood pressure. After 5 days of either a high salt (7% NaCI) or a normal salt (1% NaCl) dietary regimen, DS and DR rats were subjected to an acute stress paradigm (graded electrical footshock). There were no differences in basal plasma catecholamine concentrations or in the acute pressor responses to graded footshock between the four substrain/diet groups. However, in both DS and DR rats, plasma epinephrine responses to acute footshock were greater on a 7% than on a 1% NaCl diet. Additional groups of DS rats were treated with an inhibitor of adrenal phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase, SK&F 29,661 (1-2 g/kg body wt/day) or with vehicle. Three days after placement of an arterial catheter, rats were placed on a 7% NaCl diet, and blood pressure was measured daily for an additional 3 weeks.

  ".W": "The startle response, consisting of behavioral and cardiovascular components, was used to study the reaction of the cardiovascular system to a mild environmental stressor. We used tactile air puff startle to study responses in adult Wistar-Kyoto and spontaneously hypertensive rats. In both strains, air puff elicits a transient motor response with rapid habituation over the test session of 30 trials. Spontaneously hypertensive rats exhibit exaggerated motor responses compared with Wistar-Kyoto rats. Similarly, a 2-3-second duration pressor response was significantly greater in spontaneously hypertensive rats than in Wistar-Kyoto rats (47.7 +/- 2.0 versus 37.1 +/- 1.5 mm Hg, respectively). However, spontaneously hypertensive rats and Wistar-Kyoto rats exhibited strikingly dissimilar heart rate responses. Wistar-Kyoto rats exhibited a transient bradycardia (-42 +/- 7 beats/min) on early trials yielding to tachycardia on later trials (35 +/- 11 beats/min). In contrast, spontaneously hypertensive rats exhibited only tachycardia to all stimuli with an absence of bradycardia. Adrenal medullary secretions chronically modulate cardiac responses in both strains. Sinoaortic denervation did not alter the magnitude or profile of the heart rate responses. Spontaneously hypertensive--Wistar-Kyoto rat differences were not secondary to hypertension because renovascular hypertensive Wistar-Kyoto rats show normal responses to air puff. Four-week-old spontaneously hypertensive rats exhibit enhanced pressor and suppressed bradycardia responses relative to age-matched Wistar-Kyoto rats, indicating chronotropic differences precede development of established hypertension. Our results indicate parasympathetic activation by the mild startle stimuli rather than sympathetic withdrawal allows bradycardia to mask a latent tachycardia in Wistar-Kyoto rats. Spontaneously hypertensive rats exhibit a parasympathetic insufficiency in the startle response to novel alerting stimuli. Thus, mild air puff startle identifies a unique and discriminatory phenotypic difference between inbred normotensive and hypertensive rats.\r"

Blood flows exceeded 250 mls/min and recirculation rates averaged 5.9%. Infection and insufficiency due to thrombosis were the major problems. In 8 patients (38.1%) infection required DLJVC removal; in three the catheter was immediately replaced over a guidewire along the same track under antibiotic cover and infection has not recurred. Insufficiency occurred in 10 patients (47.6%) and was successfully managed with oral anticoagulants, local instillation of urokinase (4 cases), systemic streptokinase (2 cases) or by changing the DLJVC over a guidewire (2 cases). We believe that the DLJVC is the long term access method of choice for patients in whom conventional access cannot be constructed.\r"

Plasma aldosterone concentrations were higher during acetate than bicarbonate HD, during low sodium compared to high sodium HD, and were correlated inversely to serum sodium concentrations. The decline in plasma aldosterone concentrations during HD paralleled the decrease in serum potassium concentrations, and plasma aldosterone concentrations were correlated with serum potassium concentrations. In addition, plasma aldosterone and plasma angiotensin II concentrations were correlated significantly. It is proposed that serum potassium and the renin-angiotensin system are the main factors of aldosterone release during hemodialysis, while serum sodium per se seems to be of less importance. The dialysate buffer employed also plays a role in aldosterone regulation (via the renin-angiotensin system).\r"

A medium capable of higher bacteria recovery from aqueous environments than those ordinarily employed in clinical assays was used. Endotoxins were determined by a quantitative colorimetric assay. By the more sensitive bacterial assay 53% of the centers had bacterial counts above the AAMI standard of 200 colony-forming units per ml (CFU/ml) for water and 35% of the centers had bacterial counts above the 2000 CFU/ml standard for dialysate in at least one sampling period. The samples showed 35% and 19% of water and dialysate above the standards, respectively. While there are no standards for endotoxin concentrations in water used to prepare dialysate, 2% of the centers had endotoxin levels in their water above five endotoxin units per ml (5 EU/ml = 1 ng/ml in our assay kit), the limit set by the AAMI standards for reprocessor water. Both bacterial and endotoxin levels tended to be elevated in dialysate, with the highest levels of endotoxin in dialysates posing an obvious potential risk when high-flux dialyzers are used.\r"

Eighty-eight percent of the peritonitis episodes were initially treated with a first generation cephalosporin, but results of microbial sensitivity studies led to a change in the initial antibiotic regimen in 23 episodes. Overall, 47/57 (82%) episodes were cured by antibiotic therapy alone (responders), while 10/57 (18%) required removal of the peritoneal catheter as a curative procedure (nonresponder). Neither the duration of symptoms on initial presentation nor the status of being a nonresponder could be related to the baseline peritoneal leucocyte values, either the total (PLC) or polymorphonuclear counts (PMN). Since the baseline PLC and PMN showed a 500-fold variation, subsequent changes were expressed as a percent [PLC (%) and PMN-PLC (%)] of the baseline value. On day 3 of peritonitis, PLC (%) and PMN-PLC (%) were less in responders (26% and 10%) than nonresponders (251% and 254%) (p less than 0.001). Differentiation between responders and nonresponders based on PLC (%) and PMN-PLC (%) was associated with a high degree of sensitivity (90%) and specificity (90%). Similar results were obtained for day 4. These data suggest that the temporal pattern of PLC and PMN, when expressed as a percentage of the baseline value, may be useful in predicting those episodes of peritonitis which require removal of the peritoneal catheter.\r"

First for each ventricle we determined the dependence of the maximum effective stroke volume on the systolic driving pressure and the afterload. The right ventricle (RV) is about 10% more effective than the left ventricle (LV). Control of the TAH permits different or equal frequencies for the RV and LV. For control with equal frequencies and full-to-empty regimen of one ventricle (RV-Master or LV-Master) the ratio of designed stroke volumes between RV and LV is important. This follows from the smaller efficiency of the LV and the left-to-left shunt. Otherwise a control mode with different heart rates must be used.\r"

The shore hardness of the tubings studied were similar but the luminal coating thickness differed (0.2 mm polyurethane, 0.99 mm EVA). The pattern of particle release was similar for all materials on the pump type used with the majority of particles released being less than 5 microns in diameter. The number of particles greater than 5 microns released was independent of the tubing material but depended on the pump type. Particle release with self-occluding pumps was significantly higher (p less than 0.001) than for the manually occluded pump. Scanning electron microscopy indicated that the particles released originate from the repeated compression and flexing of the insert during pumping which leads to material structural failure. The higher release observed in the case of self-occluding pumps is suggestive of over-occlusion by the springs utilised in the pump. DEHP release (ppm) over a six hour period while perfused at 300 ml/min was significantly reduced for co-extruded tubing (0.56 +/- 0.05 mg (PVC-polyurethane) and 0.12 +/- 0.04 mg (PVC-EVA) compared with PVC (0.74 +/- 0.05 mg).\r"

Stroke volume has been reported to increase and decrease over exercise values during early recovery. The confounding variable may be posture. With the use of pulsed Doppler ultrasound, we tested the hypothesis that there is a significant difference between seated and supine stroke index (SI) during passive recovery from seated ergometer exercise. Thirteen subjects aged 26 +/- 2 yr performed two seated cycle ergometer exercise tests to 70% of predicted maximum heart rate (HR). Recovery was supine on one test and seated on the other. Cardiac index (CI), HR, and SI were calculated during rest, exercise, and 10 min of recovery. At rest, SI and CI were significantly (P less than 0.01) less and HR significantly (P less than 0.01) greater when the subjects were seated than when they were supine. At the last exercise work load, no significant differences were found in any measured variable between tests. During recovery, supine SI was maximal 180 s postexercise (99 +/- 14 ml/m2) and exceeded (P less than 0.01) resting supine (81 +/- 14 ml/m2) and peak exercise (77 +/- 14 ml/m2) SI by 22 and 29%, respectively. Seated SI was constant at peak exercise levels for 2 min. Seated and supine recovery CI never exceeded exercise values. Systolic and diastolic blood pressure recovery curves were similar in the two postures. We conclude that posture significantly affects SI during recovery from submaximal seated exercise. These results have implications for choice of recovery posture after stress testing in cardiac patients where it is desirable to minimize ventricular loading.\r"

Resting total arterial compliance in heart-failure patients was not significantly different from control subjects. Total arterial compliance did not significantly change with exercise in either group despite increases in arterial pressure. However, nitroprusside administration in the heart-failure group increased total arterial compliance both at rest and on exercise compared with the unmedicated state. These different methodological approaches to the estimation of total arterial compliance in humans resulted in significantly different absolute values for compliance, although both methods provided concordant results with respect to the response of arterial compliance to physiological and pharmacological interventions.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The majority of in vitro studies on airway smooth muscle have used the trachealis (TSM) as a convenient substitute for muscle from airways that constitute the flow-limiting segment. The latter are technically difficult to work with. However, because the site of maximum resistance to airflow is at the third to seventh generations of the bronchial tree, the trachealis preparation is of limited value. Length-tension and force-velocity properties were therefore studied at optimal length (lo) of canine bronchial smooth muscle (BSM) from which cartilage had been carefully removed. Normalized maximum isometric tension or stress (Po x 10(4) N/m2) for BSM was 7.1 +/- 0.19 (SE), which was similar to that of BSM with cartilage (BSM+C, 6.8 +/- 0.21) but lower than for TSM (18.2 +/- 0.81). At length greater than lo, the BSM+C was stiffer than the BSM. The values of maximum shortening capacity (delta Lmax), obtained directly from isotonic shortening at a load equal to the resting tension at lo, were 0.76 lo +/- 0.03, 0.41 lo +/- 0.02, and 0.24 +/- 0.02 lo for TSM, BSM, and BSM+C, respectively. The BSM and BSM+C delta Lmaxs were different (P less than 0.05). Maximal shortening velocities (Vo) for BSM, elicited at 2, 4, and 8 s by quick release in the course of an isometric contraction were significantly higher than for the BSM+C. Vos showed gradual decreases in all three groups in the later phase of contraction, suggesting the operation of latch bridges.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Our aim was to determine the effect of prolonged fetal hypoxemia, induced by reduced maternal uterine blood flow (RUBF), on fetal lung liquid secretion, flow, and volume. In chronically catheterized fetal sheep, lung liquid volume (VL) and the secretion rate of lung liquid (Vs) were measured before and after a 24-h period of either RUBF or normoxemia. Tracheal fluid flow and the incidence of fetal breathing movements (FBM) were measured before, during, and after the 24-h period. In normoxic control fetuses Vs was not significantly altered. After 24 h of RUBF, Vs was significantly (P less than 0.005) reduced compared with pre-RUBF values. During 24 h of RUBF the incidence of FBM declined initially but returned to control values after 12-16 h. In seven of eight fetuses, over the 12- to 24-h period of RUBF, large amounts of liquid (22.7-62.6 ml) were drawn into the lungs during FBM, resulting in a net movement of amniotic fluid into the lungs. During the 18- to 24-h period of RUBF, changes in the incidence of FBM were found to be significantly and positively correlated (r = 0.86, P less than 0.005) with the changes in VL that occurred over the 24-h period. Thus, prolonged RUBF can result in the inhalation of large volumes of amniotic fluid by the fetus, which could be a cause of in utero meconium aspiration.\r"

MetHb was induced by infusing methemoglobin-containing erythrocytes in exchange for fetal blood. During the hour after MetHb was established, fetal methemoglobin concentrations averaged 1.23 +/- 0.12 (mild MetHb), 1.71 +/- 0.13 (moderate MetHb), and 2.27 +/- 0.17 g/dl (severe MetHb). MetHb reduced mean arterial O2 content by approximately 19 (mild MetHb), 29 (moderate MetHb), and 39% (severe MetHb). The average preductal arterial PO2 fell by 1.6 (-7%), 2.8 (-11%), and 4.0 Torr (-16%) for mild, moderate, and severe MetHb, respectively. Fetal heart rate increased significantly during mild and moderate MetHb, and mean arterial pressure fell slightly during moderate and severe MetHb. The incidences of fetal breathing and eye movements were reduced in a dose-dependent manner when the calculated brain end-capillary PO2 was less than 14 Torr. We conclude that: 1) the effective capillary PO2 in the fetal brain can be significantly reduced by increasing the distance between non-methemoglobin-laden erythrocytes in capillaries and 2) hypoxic inhibition of fetal breathing probably arises from discrete areas of the brain having a PO2 less than 3 Torr.\r"

The apparatus consists of an expandable dead space and a respirometer. When the dead space was increased at a constant rate (approximately 100 ml/min), minute ventilation (VE) and VO2resp increased gradually. Because the logarithm of VO2 was found to be approximately linearly related to VE, we characterized this relationship by the slope (logVO2/VE) and the intercept at VE = 0 (VO2met) of the semilog regression line. The second purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between VO2resp and aging. Six anthropometric and spirometric factors (age, height, weight, vital capacity, forced expiratory volume in 1 s, and body surface area) were analyzed in 37 normal subjects by simple and stepwise multiple regression analyses. We found a significant increase in logVO2/VE and a significant decrease in VO2met with age. In conclusion, 1) the present method is convenient to use, and we are able to study VO2resp over a wide range of ventilation without voluntary effort, and 2) age per se is one of the factors accounting for the observed increase in VO2resp with age.\r"

To evaluate the long-term effects of chronic hypoxia on water balance, urinary electrolyte excretion, heart weights, systemic arterial pressure, and components of the renin-angiotensin system, male Sprague-Dawley rats were exposed to periods of simulated altitude of 10,000 ft up to 90 days of age beginning at 2 or 30 days of age. Altitude exposure of both neonatal and adult rats was associated with increases in urine output and water intake after 30 days of exposure, and right ventricular (RV) hypertrophy at all ages was examined. However, the percent increase in urine output, water intake, and RV hypertrophy was numerically greater in neonates. Neonates also had increases in urinary sodium and potassium excretion after 30 days of exposure. Plasma renin activity and serum angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) activity were not affected, but plasma renin substrate was reduced in both neonatal and adult altitude-exposed rats. Lung ACE activity was also decreased in altitude-exposed neonates. These data indicate that the degree and, in some cases, the nature of these homeostatic responses varies with age during long-term hypoxia.\r"

Hypoxia increases central ventilatory drive through peripheral chemoreceptor stimulation and may also alter cerebral perfusion and glutamate metabolism locally. Therefore the effect of hypoxia and peripheral chemodenervation on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) transfer rate of in vivo tracer amidated central nervous system glutamate was studied in intact and chemodenervated pentobarbital-anesthetized dogs during normoxia and after 1 h of hypoxia induced with 10 or 12% O2 in N2 breathing at constant expired ventilation and arterial CO2 tension. Chemodenervation was performed by bilateral sectioning of the carotid body nerves and cervical vagi. CSF transfer rates of radiotracer 13NH4+ and [13N]glutamine synthesized via the reaction, glutamate + NH4(+)----glutamine, in brain glia were measured during normoxia and after 1 h of hypoxia. At normoxia, maximal glial glutamine efflux rate jm = 103.3 +/- 11.2 (SE) mumol.l-1.min-1 in all animals. After 1 h of hypoxia in intact animals, jm = 78.4 +/- 10.0 mumol.l-1.min-1. In denervated animals, jm was decreased to 46.3 +/- 4.3 mumol.l-1.min-1. During hypoxia, mean cerebral cortical glutamate concentration was higher in denervated animals (9.98 +/- 1.43 mumol/g brain tissue) than in intact animals (7.63 +/- 1.82 mumol/g brain tissue) and corresponding medullary glutamate concentration tended to be higher in denervated animals.

  ".W": "To quantify the inhomogeneity of alveolar pressures (PA) during cyclic changes in lung volume similar to those present during spontaneous breathing, inhomogeneity of PA was measured with an alveolar capsule technique in six excised canine lungs. The lungs were ventilated by a quasi-sinusoidal pump with a constant end-expiratory lung volume and tidal volumes of 10, 20, and 40% of vital capacity at breathing frequencies ranging from 5 to 45 breaths/min. Inhomogeneity of PA was quantified as the sample standard deviation of pressures measured in three capsules. A component of inhomogeneity in phase with flow and a smaller component out of phase with flow were present. The in-phase component increased approximately linearly with flow. The ratio of inhomogeneity to flow was smaller at large tidal volumes and, at the two higher tidal volumes studied, the ratio was greater during inspiration than during expiration. If these data are interpreted in terms of a simple circuit model, this degree of inhomogeneity implies an approximately twofold variation in regional time constants. Despite these considerable differences in time constants, the absolute amount of inhomogeneity as defined by the sample standard deviation of the three PA's was small (maximum 0.57 +/- 0.32 cmH2O at the highest breathing frequency and tidal volume) because airway resistance in the canine lung was small.\r"

  ".W": "Monte Carlo simulations of the passage of inert gas through muscle tissue reveal that countercurrent gas exchange is more important than heterogeneity of flow in determination of the shape of inert gas washout curves. Semilog plots of inert gas washout are usually curved rather than straight. Two explanations often offered are that countercurrent flow may distort the shape and that uneven perfusion of the tissue gives rise to nonuniform washout. The curvature of the semilog plot may be summarized by the relative dispersion (RD), which is the ratio of the standard deviation of transit times to the mean transit time. For straight semilog plots, RD is 1. Semilog plots of data showing xenon washout from dog tissues are curved and have and RD of approximately 2. We have simulated the transit of gas particles through a vascular bed composed of repeating units of 100 mg of tissue perfused by three small vessels 80 microns in diameter and several levels of branching that direct flow through 190,000 capillaries. Geometric distribution of flow is important. Similar degrees of flow heterogeneity affect the curvature of the washout curve more if regions of heterogeneous flow are widely spaced than if they are close together. Diffusion blunts the effects of heterogeneous flow by mixing particles in high-flow regions with particles in low-flow regions. Because of this mixing, alternating regions of high flow and low flow spaced at intervals of less than 0.5 cm are unlikely explanations for the curved semilog plots.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

To this end, we studied responses to specific antigen challenge and length-tension and force-velocity relationships in sensitized (SSV) and control saphenous veins (CSV). The antigen challenge revealed that the venous smooth muscle was strongly sensitized and developed a Schultz-Dale response, the two main mediators of which were histamine and norepinephrine. Length-tension relationship studies showed that whereas there is no difference in maximum isometric tension development between SSV and CSV [93.95 +/- 7.34 and 87.86 +/- 4.00 (SE) mN/mm2, respectively], SSV exhibited a significantly greater maximum isotonic shortening capacity of 0.613 +/- 0.009 optional length (lo) vs. 0.578 +/- 0.012 lo for CSV. Unloaded shortening velocity (Vo), which reflects the cross-bridge cycling rate, was determined at different times after the onset of electrical stimulation. Maximum Vo was attained early (5 s) in the contraction; a 15% decline in Vo was observed at the plateau of the contraction (15 s). At 5 s, Vo of SSV (0.316 +/- 0.019 lo/s) was significantly higher than that of CSV (0.269 +/- 0.018 lo/s), although Vos were same at 15 (0.249 +/- 0.021 lo/s for SSV and 0.237 +/- 0.019 lo/s for CSV). The increase in shortening likely results from th e increase in the early cross-bridge cycling rate because our studies show that the bulk of shortening occurs in the first 5 s.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The youngest animals tested were approximately 3 wk old (1.5-2.9 g). Animals were anesthetized with the thiobarbituric acid derivative, Inactin, and the electromyogram of the diaphragm was used to assess changes in breathing rhythm and ventilatory output. Glutamate concentrations of 50, 150, and 1,000 mM were injected into the rostral pons. Active sites were generally located between parabrachial and either lateral lemniscal or trigeminal nuclei. Effects of glutamate in opossums of all ages included changes in diaphragm activity and respiratory timing over several breaths. In the youngest animals, a very high incidence of apnea occurred as an initial response (17 of 20 sites) at the 1,000 mM concentration. The high incidence of apneic response in the youngest animals suggests that strong activation of rostral pontine neurons can more easily disrupt respiratory output; a physiological circumstance of such activation might include a diving response stimulated by trigeminal afferents.\r"

Blood sampling was performed every 10 min for 12 h. LH and GH pulsatile parameters were identified and characterized by the Cluster pulse detection algorithm. No significant differences were noted in the number of peaks, peak amplitude, interpeak interval, peak increment, or 12-h integrated concentrations between C and EX for LH or GH. We conclude that maximal exercise protocols typically used for exercise evaluation do not have an effect on the pulsatile characteristics of LH or GH release in untrained women during the early follicular phase of the menstrual cycle if 12-24 h of recovery are allowed before evaluation of the pulsatile secretion of gonadotropins or GH.\r"

We measured systemic vascular reactivity and contractile sensitivity of isolated aortic rings from pregnant and nonpregnant guinea pigs kept for 6 wk at either simulated high altitude (3,900 m) or low altitude (1,600 m). We found that pregnancy at high compared with low altitude increased baseline systemic vascular resistance (SVR) but not the SVR response to angiotensin II in awake unstressed guinea pigs. Contractile sensitivity to norepinephrine was also increased in aortic rings isolated from high-altitude compared with low-altitude pregnant animals. Meclofenamate, a prostaglandin synthesis inhibitor, did not equalize vasoreactivity in the high- and low-altitude pregnant guinea pigs or in their isolated aortic rings. We concluded that pregnancy at high compared with low altitude increased base-line SVR and aortic contractile sensitivity but that mechanisms other than decreased vasodilator prostaglandin production were responsible.\r"

  ".W": "The possible contribution of spinal reflexes to abdominal muscle activation during vomiting was assessed in decerebrate cats. The activity of these muscles is partly controlled by bulbospinal expiratory neurons in the caudal ventral respiratory group (VRG). In a previous study it was found that the abdominal muscles are still active during vomiting after midsagittal lesion of the axons of these neurons between C1 and the obex (A.D. Miller, L.K. Tan, and I. Suzuki. J. Neurophysiol. 57: 1854-1866, 1987). The present experiments indicate that this postlesion activity was due to spinal stretch reflexes because 1) such midsagittal lesions eliminate abdominal muscle nerve activity during fictive vomiting in paralyzed cats in which there are no abdominal stretch reflexes, 2) the abdominal muscles are activated during vomiting by spinal reflexes after upper thoracic cord transections, and 3) the normal 100-ms delay between diaphragmatic and abdominal activation during vomiting is reduced to approximately 20-25 ms after both types of lesions, which is consistent with postlesion abdominal reflex activation. Our results also suggest that, during normal vomiting, abdominal stretch and tension reflexes have only a minor role if any and abdominal muscle activation is probably mediated primarily or exclusively by expiratory neurons in the caudal ventral respiratory group. However, our finding that phrenic activity is reduced both during vomiting after thoracic transections and during fictive vomiting after paralysis is consistent with a contribution of reflex activity from abdominal and/or intercostal muscles to phrenic discharge during normal vomiting.\r"

A significant fall in LV WBC (P less than 0.01) but not in PA WBC occurred during or immediately after the maneuver in 18 subjects, with a mean maximum decrease of 26 +/- 12% (SD) from base line (range 9-46%). Between 1 and 3 min after the maneuver, there was an increase in LV and PA WBC (P less than 0.01) above base line.

The degree of fall in LV WBC correlated closely (r = 0.68, P less than 0.01) with the changes from lung zone 3 to zone 2 and 1 conditions, as determined from the pressure changes. We conclude that WBCs are retained in the lung during a forced expiratory maneuver because of alveolar capillary compression.\r"

  ".W": "The thermal profiles in the airways of healthy human volunteers and patients with asthma differ after cessation of hyperpnea. The asthmatic patients rewarm their airways more rapidly. To identify thermal properties and processes that could account for the difference between these populations, we developed a model describing the radial transport of heat and water across the trachea. A distinctive feature of the model is a variable parameter describing blood supply to the mucosal and submucosal layers. Simulations performed with the model are initiated by a breath-hold maneuver and are propagative in time. Blood perfusion rates in the airway wall, the thickness of the layer of airway surface liquid, and the mucosa-submucosa thickness, all thought to be more pronounced in asthmatic patients, were varied by changing model parameters and initial conditions. Increasing the thickness of the liquid layer by more than an order of magnitude had little effect on the temperature or water content in the airway lumen. Doubling the blood flow to the mucosa-submucosa resulted in a slight increase in airway temperature. When this effect was coupled, however, with an increase in the thickness of the mucosa-submucosa layer, the increase in temperature was more pronounced. Because the bronchial circulation is the major source of heat to the airway, these results indicate that differences in airway wall thickness coupled with differences in the magnitude or responsiveness of the bronchial microcirculation could account for the differences in intra-airway temperature between the two populations.\r"

Thirty healthy adult men (aged 20-31 yr) participated in four randomly ordered cycle ergometer rides: ride 1 (65% VO2max, 30 min), ride 2 (30% VO2max, 60 min), ride 3 (75% VO2max, 60 min), and ride 4 (65% VO2max, 120 min). Blood samples were drawn at various times before and after the exercise sessions. Lymphocyte subsets were determined by flow cytometry using monoclonal antibodies for total T (CD3+), T-helper (CD4+), and T-suppressor (CD8+) lymphocytes and for a subset of cells expressing a natural killer (NK) cell antigen (Leu7+). Plasma catecholamines were assayed to determine exercise stress. There were sharp reductions (P less than 0.01) in the percentage of pan-T and T-helper lymphocytes immediately after exercise across all fitness levels; the magnitude of this reduction was greatest after the highest intensity (ride 3) or longest duration (ride 4) work. In contrast, the absolute number of T and T-helper cells tended to increase after exercise and significantly so in the HF subjects (P less than 0.005). There was no significant effect of exercise or subject fitness category on the percentage of T-suppressor lymphocytes, although the absolute numbers of this subset increased significantly after exercise in LF subjects. Marked increases (P less than 0.01) in the percentage of NK cells occurred immediately after exercise at all intensities and durations tested; numerical increases in total NK cells were significant in all fitness groups after the highest intensity work (ride 3; P less than 0.005). Irrespective of whether the changes were expressed as percentage or total numbers, recovery to base line occurred at 30 min after exercise. The results suggest that the exercise effect on blood lymphocyte subset percentages in men is transient and occurs across all fitness levels. Concomitant changes in plasma catecholamine concentrations are only weakly associated with these lymphocyte subset percentage responses to exercise. Furthermore, this study shows that the exercise-induced changes in lymphocyte percentages do not consistently reflect changes in the absolute numbers of cells.\r"

Four of the nine subjects also performed voluntary isocapnic hyperventilation. During quiet breathing of room air, the TA exhibited phasic activity in expiration and often tonic activity throughout the respiratory cycle. Both phasic and tonic TA activity progressively decreased with either increasing hypoxia or hypercapnia. Tonic activity appeared to decrease more rapidly than phasic activity with increasing chemical stimulation. At comparable tidal volume increments, the relative decrease in phasic TA activity appeared to be greater under hypoxic than under hypercapnic conditions. During voluntary isocapnic hyperventilation, phasic TA activity decreased without significant change in tonic activity. At tidal volumes approximately double those of base line, the relative decrease in TA activity was similar during both hypercapnia and voluntary hyperventilation, although differences appeared at higher tidal volumes. The results, in combination with recent findings in humans regarding the posterior cricoarytenoid muscle, a vocal cord abductor, suggest that vocal cord position is dependent on the net balance of counteracting forces not only during quiet breathing but also during involuntary and voluntary hyperpnea.\r"

In addition, we studied the role of cyclooxygenase products on the in vitro responses. Tracheal rings were contracted with increasing concentrations of carbachol and KCl and relaxed with increasing concentrations of isoproterenol after contraction with carbachol at the concentration that produced 30, 50, and 70% of the maximal contraction (EC30, EC50, and EC70, respectively) and KCl at the EC50. Half the tracheae simultaneously underwent the same protocols after pretreatment with indomethacin (3 X 10(-6) M). Despite a severalfold difference in the maximal response to cholinergic agents in vivo, there were no significant differences between the strains in the tracheal responses to carbachol (P = 0.78) or KCl (P = 0.13) in vitro. Both strains showed inhibition of the isoproterenol relaxation by carbachol (P less than 0.0001). Multiple linear regression analysis showed that the strain that was more sensitive to carbachol in vivo was also more sensitive to isoproterenol in vitro after carbachol contraction (P = 0.014). The greater isoproterenol sensitivity of the tracheae from this strain was not present after contraction with KCl, nor were these tracheae more sensitive to relaxation with sodium nitroprusside. Indomethacin pretreatment of the tissues in vitro augmented the maximal response and the sensitivity to carbachol (P less than 0.001) and KCl (P = 0.0006), and this effect was similar in both strains. Evaluation of isoproterenol relaxation after indomethacin pretreatment was confounded by the lower concentrations of carbachol needed for contraction.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The method is illustrated with several examples--hypothetical data representing a wide range of VA/Q distributions as well as some real data.\r"

  ".W": "It has recently been suggested that pulmonary hypertension secondary to oleic acid lung injury mainly results from an increase in the critical closing pressure of the pulmonary vessels [Boiteau et al., Am. J. Physiol. 251 (Heart Circ. Physiol. 20): H1163-H1170, 1986]. To further test this hypothesis, we studied 1) the pulmonary arterial pressure- (Ppa) flow (Q) relationship with left atrial pressure (Pla) kept constant (n = 7) and 2) the Ppa-Pla relationship with Q kept constant (n = 9) in intact anesthetized and ventilated dogs before and after lung injury induced by oleic acid (0.09 ml/kg iv). Q was manipulated by use of a femoral arteriovenous bypass and a balloon catheter inserted in the inferior vena cava. Pla was manipulated with a balloon catheter placed by thoracotomy in the left atrium. Ppa-Q plots were rectilinear before as well as after oleic acid. Before oleic acid, the extrapolated pressure intercept of the Ppa-Q plots approximated Pla. Oleic acid administration resulted in a parallel shift of the Ppa-Q plots to higher pressure; i.e., the pressure intercept increased, whereas the slope was not modified. Increasing Pla at constant Q before oleic acid led to a proportional augmentation of Ppa. After oleic acid, however, changes in Pla over the same range affected Ppa only at the highest levels of Pla. These results suggest that oleic acid lung injury increases the critical closing pressure that exceeds Pla, becomes the effective outflow pressure of the pulmonary circulation, and is responsible for the pulmonary hypertension.\r"

This study was undertaken to examine the potential for cardiac myosin P-LC(P) for both equivalent heart rate and work load in exercising endurance-trained and nontrained rodents. A 10-wk training protocol elicited a significant reduction in submaximal running O2 uptake while enhancing peak O2 uptake (-17 and 10%, respectively, P less than 0.05). Left ventricular functional index during submaximal exercise, obtained with a high-fidelity Millar ultraminiature pressure transducer, indicated that the trained animals were able to maintain peak left ventricular pressure (LVP) in comparison to their sedentary counterparts, even though both heart rate and rate of LVP development were significantly reduced (P less than 0.05). When expressed on the basis of equivalent submaximal heart rate, peak LVP was augmented in the trained animals. Cardiac myosin P-LC(P) was examined under two conditions known to produce disparate responses in trained vs. sedentary animals. For an equivalent work load, we observed parallel increases in P-LC(P) (20%) and systolic pressure (17%) in both groups, even though the trained animals exhibited significantly lower heart rates (P less than 0.05). For an equivalent heart rate, training evoked a significant increase in systolic pressure (26%, P less than 0.05) and caused a slight increase in P-LC(P) relative to the nontrained controls. Cardiac myosin adenosinetriphosphatase was reduced approximately 10% in the trained animals (P less than 0.05), commensurate with a 2.0-fold increase in the V3 (low adenosinetriphosphatase) isomyosin.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Compared with normal controls (NC), Ca2(+)-regulated myofibril adenosinetriphosphatase was reduced by 39% in TD and increased by 9% in H rats. This response was associated with a 20-fold increase in the V3 isoform and an 11% increase in the V1 isoform in TD and H rats, respectively. Submaximal treadmill exercise elicited significant elevations in all myocardial functional indexes examined in H rats compared with the NC group, whereas the opposite occurred for the TD group. Despite the marked contrast in cardiac function among the three groups, intrinsic levels of P-LC(P) were similar at rest among the groups and were significantly reduced in both TD and H groups relative to controls during exercise. These data suggest that although thyroid state exerts a profound impact on intrinsic myocardial functional state, it exerts little control over cellular processes regulating P-LC(P) during rest and exercise.\r"

Animals were randomly assigned to one of three groups: 1) euthyroid controls, 2) thyroid deficient (propylthiouracil treated), and 3) hyperthyroid (triiodothyronine treated). Thyroid deficiency resulted in a marked increase in the low-adenosinetriphosphatase V3 isoform by 20- and 49-fold in the left and right ventricle, respectively. Conversely, hyperthyroidism induced a modest (3-11%) but significant increase in the high-adenosinetriphosphatase V1 isoform in both ventricles. The thyroid-deficient rats exhibited significant increases in slow myosin in both soleus (8%) and red gastrocnemius (24%), with concomitant reductions in intermediate myosin in both muscles. Interestingly, while the slow-myosin isoform was decreased in both the soleus (-19%) and the red gastrocnemius (-43%) of the hyperthyroid group, the intermediate-myosin isoform was affected differentially in the two muscles, with a fivefold increase in the former vs. a 16% decrease in the latter. Furthermore, hyperthyroidism increased the fast myosins in the red gastrocnemius while exerting no effect on the same isoforms in the white gastrocnemius. Collectively these data suggest both different specificity and sensitivity among the myosin genes of different striated muscle types in response to thyroid hormone.\r"

The O2 time required to produce convulsions and death was increased significantly in both species by intermittency. To determine whether changes in brain and lung superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and glutathione peroxidase (GSHPx) correlated with the observed tolerance, enzyme activities were measured after short or long HBO exposures. For each exposure duration, one group received continuous and one intermittent HBO; O2 times were matched. HBO had marked effects on these enzymes: lung SOD increased (guinea pigs 47%, rats 88%) and CAT and GSHPx activities decreased (33%) in brain and lung. No differences were seen in lung GSHPx or brain CAT in rats or brain SOD in either species. In guinea pigs, but less so in rats, the observed changes in activity were usually modulated by intermittency. Increases in hematocrit, organ protein, and lung DNA, which may also reflect ongoing oxidative damage, were also slowed with intermittency in guinea pigs. Intermittency benefited both species by postponing gross symptoms of toxicity, but its modulation of changes in enzyme activities and other biochemical variables was more pronounced in guinea pigs than in rats, suggesting that there are additional mechanisms for tolerance.\r"

To test this hypothesis, the relationship between Tx and pulmonary arterial pressure was evaluated in a model of acute lung injury induced with PMA in pentobarbital sodium-anesthetized male mongrel dogs. Sixty minutes after administration of PMA (20 micrograms/kg iv, n = 10), TxB2 increased 10-fold from control in both systemic and pulmonary arterial blood and 8-fold in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid. Concomitantly, pulmonary arterial pressure (Ppa) increased from 14.5 +/- 1.0 to 36.2 +/- 3.5 mmHg, and pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) increased from 5.1 +/- 0.4 to 25.9 +/- 2.9 mmHg.l-1.min. Inhibition of Tx synthase with OKY-046 (10 mg/kg iv, n = 6) prevented the PMA-induced increase in Tx concentrations in blood and BAL fluid but did not prevent or attenuate the increase in Ppa. OKY-046 pretreatment did, however, attenuate but not prevent the increase in PVR 60 min after PMA administration. Pretreatment with the TxA2/prostaglandin H2 receptor antagonist ONO-3708 (10 micrograms.kg-1.min-1 iv, n = 7) prevented the pressor response to bolus injections of 1-10 micrograms U-46619, a Tx receptor agonist, but did not prevent or attenuate the PMA-induced increase in Ppa. ONO-3708 also attenuated but did not prevent the increase in PVR. These results suggest that Tx does not mediate the PMA-induced pulmonary hypertension but may augment the increases in PVR in this model of acute lung injury.\r"

To study heat and water vapor transport in the human respiratory tract, a time-dependent model, based on a single differential equation with an analytical solution, was developed that could predict the intra-airway temperatures and water vapor contents. The key feature is the dependence of the temperature and water vapor along the respiratory tract as a function of the air residence time at each location. The model assumes disturbed laminar flow leading to enhanced transport mechanisms and wall temperature profiles modeled according to experimental data (E. R. McFadden, Jr., B. M. Pichurko, H. F. Bowman, E. Ingenito, S. Burns, N. Dowling, and J. Soloway. J. Appl. Physiol. 58: 564-570, 1985). It predicts that 1) the air equilibrates with the wall before it reaches body conditions (37 degrees C, 99.5% relative humidity); 2) conditioning of the inspired air involves several generations, with the number depending on the respiratory conditions; and 3) the walls of the upper airways are unsaturated, although it is difficult to judge at this state the depth of the respiratory tract affected.\r"

The mechanical properties of the poly-HEMA bridges make them easy to manufacture, store, and sterilize. When agar bridges were compared with poly-HEMA bridges in long-term cell culture experiments, the failure rate of the agar bridges was found to be approximately 10% per week vs. a virtually nonexistent failure rate for the poly-HEMA bridges. Because poly-HEMA salt bridges are reliable, durable, and nontoxic to cells, they are a practical alternative to agar salt bridges in certain experimental designs.\r"

  ".W": "The present study derives simple formulas for the prediction of optimal insertion length of an esophageal temperature-sensitive probe from the measurements of either standing or sitting height. The formulas assume that the optimal site for an esophageal temperature probe is in the region of the esophagus bounded by the left ventricle and aorta, corresponding to the level of the eighth and ninth thoracic vertebrae (T8 and T9, respectively). An esophageal probe was constructed of polyethylene tubing containing 1-cm segments of alternating radiopaque and nonradiopaque tubing in the distal 20 cm of the probe. The probe was inserted through a nostril into the esophagus of 20 subjects (12 males and 8 females) of various heights (range 163-194.6 cm) and weights (range 52.2-100.8 kg), and lateral chest radiograms were obtained for determination of the insertion length of the probe (L) required to situate the probe in the retrocardiac esophagus. Analysis of the radiograms demonstrated that, at the level of the intervertebral disc between T8 and T9, the probe was below the tracheal bifurcation and close to the left ventricle. The distance from the nasal flare to this level showed a good correlation with the subject's stretched stature (r2 = 0.71) and sitting height (r2 = 0.86). The following equations were derived to predict the placement of the esophageal probe at the T8/T9 level based on standing height: L (CM) = 0.228 x (standing height) - 0.194, and sitting height: L (cm) = 0.479 x (sitting height) - 4.44.\r"

  ".W": "Recent evidence suggests that exercise training may significantly increase the expression of the cardiac myosin isozyme V1 in the diabetic heart, a change associated with improved cardiac functional capacity. To test this hypothesis, cardiac myofibrillar adenosinetriphosphatase (ATPase) activity and myosin isozyme profiles were determined in trained and sedentary male hyperinsulinemic obese Zucker (OZT, OZS) and obese Wistar (OWT, OWS) rats. Lean sedentary (LZS, LWS) animals served as age-matched controls. Myofibrillar ATPase activity and the relative quantity of the high-ATPase isozyme V1 was significantly lower in both strains of sedentary obese rats than in the respective lean sedentary controls (P less than 0.05). Both 5 (OZT) and 10 wk (OWT) of moderate treadmill training increased these markers of cardiac myosin biochemistry in the obese animals (P less than 0.05). Thus, endurance exercise training remodels the cardiac isomyosin profile of hyperinsulinemic rats and, in doing so, may enhance cardiac contractility and functional capacity. Such changes may reflect an improvement in glucose availability and utilization in these hearts.\r"

  ".W": "Treadmill exercise of 2-min duration and increasing intensity resulted in increased formation of acetyl-CoA and acetylcarnitine in working muscle of Thoroughbred horses. At high work intensities a plateau was reached for both acetyl-CoA (approximately 50 mumols/kg dry muscle) and acetylcarnitine (approximately 20 mmol/kg dry muscle). Postexercise concentrations were significantly (P less than 0.001) correlated; [acetylcarnitine] = 349.[acetyl-CoA] + 2.4. The results indicate that approximately 350 mumols acetylcarnitine were accumulated for every 1 mumol acetyl-CoA. Under the conditions of exercise used it is probable that most of the acetyl-CoA formed is generated through the intramitochondrial decarboxylation of pyruvate. The acetyl groups of acetyl-CoA are apparently redistributed throughout the whole cell through formation of acetylcarnitine, which readily transverses the mitochondrial membrane. Despite the redistribution, however, the close correlation between acetylcarnitine and acetyl-CoA would indicate that equilibrium was maintained and that neither acetylcarnitine transferase nor carnitine/acetylcarnitine translocase were rate limiting. There is some question as to whether the changes observed relate directly to exercise itself or to the state in muscle 10 s or more after exercise.\r"

In the 3 days after this exercise four subjects consumed diets containing 4.25 g CHO/kg body wt, and the remainder were fed 8.5 g CHO/kg. All subjects experienced severe muscle soreness and edema in the quadriceps muscles of the eccentrically exercised leg. Mean (+/- SE) resting serum creatine kinase increased from a preexercise level of 57 +/- 3 to 6,988 +/- 1,913 U/l on the 3rd day of recovery. The glycogen content (mmol/kg dry wt) in the vastus lateralis of CL muscles averaged 90, 395, and 592 mmol/kg dry wt at 0, 24, and 72 h of recovery. The EL muscle, on the other hand, averaged 168, 329, and 435 mmol/kg dry wt at these same intervals. Subjects receiving 8.5 g CHO/kg stored significantly more glycogen than those who were fed 4.3 g CHO/kg. In both groups, however, significantly less glycogen was stored in the EL than in the CL.\r"

Several factors may contribute to the elevation, e.g., loss of vascular bed, overinflation of the remaining lung, and active pulmonary vasoconstriction. We measured hemodynamic changes during graded exercise in conditioned foxhounds and compared pulmonary pressure-flow relationships before and after left pneumonectomy. Pulmonary arterial pressure-flow relationship in the remaining lung is not altered by pneumonectomy, suggesting that the increase in pulmonary vascular resistance post-pneumonectomy is largely the passive consequence of increased pulmonary blood flow to the remaining lung. The potential for chronic hyperinflation of the remaining lung to increase pulmonary resistance after pneumonectomy may have been counterbalanced by a concomitant reduction in lung elastic recoil. Unexpectedly, both mean systemic blood pressure and hematocrit were higher with respect to cardiac output after pneumonectomy. Cardiac output and stroke volume at any given work load were lower after pneumonectomy than before, and heart rate response was unaltered. This pattern of responses suggests that increases in left and right ventricular afterload may have contributed to the reduction in cardiac output.\r"

Soleus electromyogram (EMG) activity was recorded before and during tail suspension. Unloading caused progressive reduction in the muscle-to-body weight ratio. After 14 days, type I and IIa fibers decreased in area 63 and 47%, respectively. Subsarcolemmal mitochondria and myofibrils were degraded more rapidly than intermyofibrillar mitochondria and the cell membrane. After 10 days, 3% of the fibers exhibited segmental necrosis; affected fibers were all high-oxidative type IIa fibers. This suggested ischemic injury. By 13 days, 30% of the fibers possessed central corelike lesions involving primarily type I fibers. Video monitoring revealed abnormal plantar flexion of the hindfeet by 4 days; this posture shortened the soleus working range. Corelike lesions indicated adaptation to the shortened length. No morphological signs of denervation were detected. EMG activity shifted from tonic to phasic, and aggregate activity was 13% of normal after 7 days. These findings indicate that the atrophy and pathological changes result from unloaded contractions, reduced use, compromised blood flow, and shortened working length.\r"

Wet weights of cryofixed soleus muscles were increased at 3 (16%), 6 (28%), 9 (16%), and 24 (16%) h after running compared with those of nonexercised controls. The transient increase in muscle wet weight correlated in time with an increase in muscle volume. Muscle fiber swelling accounted for most of the muscle swelling in absolute terms because of the large proportion (approximately 90%) of the muscle volume composed of fibers, but swelling of the interstitium was about twofold larger than fiber swelling per unit area. Muscle fiber degeneration was most frequently found at the end of the observation period, i.e., 24 h after running. The muscle swelling was not associated with an increase in intramuscular pressure. During the postexercise measuring period (18 min to 24 h after exercise), intramuscular pressures of exercised rats (1.3 +/- 0.3 mm Hg) did not differ significantly from control values (1.0 +/- 0.2 mm Hg). These findings indicate that increased intramuscular pressure is not responsible for the muscle fiber degeneration found in rat soleus muscle 24 h after endurance running.\r"

Muscarinic reactivity in vivo was determined by measuring specific airway resistance (sRaw) in response to increasing concentrations of aerosolized acetylcholine (ACh) administered before and 30 min after exposure. Immediately after reactivity testing, multiple tracheal rings from ozone- and air-exposed animals were prepared and the contractile responses to increasing concentrations of substance P, ACh, or KCl were assessed in the presence of 10 microM indomethacin with or without 1 microM phosphoramidon, an inhibitor of neutral endopeptidase. Isometric force generation in vitro was measured on stimulation by cumulative concentrations of the agonists, and force generation (in g/cm2) was calculated after determination of muscle cross-sectional area. The smooth muscle of mucosa-intact airways from guinea pigs with ozone-induced bronchial hyper-reactivity proved to be hyperresponsive in vitro to substance P and ACh but not to KCl. Pretreatment with phosphoramidon abolished the increase in substance P responsiveness but had no effect on muscarinic hyperresponsiveness after ozone exposure. Furthermore, substance P responsiveness was not augmented in ozone-exposed airways in which the mucosa had been removed before testing in vitro. Likewise, muscarinic hyperresponsiveness was not present in ozone-exposed airways without mucosa. Our data indicate that airway smooth muscle responsiveness is increased in guinea pigs with ozone-induced bronchial hyperreactivity and suggest that this hyperresponsiveness may be linked to non-cyclooxygenase mucosa-derived factors.\r"

  ".W": "We studied airway opening in a benchtop model intended to mimic bronchial walls held in apposition by airway lining fluid. We measured the relationship between the airway opening velocity (U) and the applied airway opening pressure in thin-walled polyethylene tubes of different radii (R) using lining fluids of different surface tensions (gamma) and viscosities (mu). Axial wall tension (T) was applied to modify the apparent wall compliance characteristics, and the lining film thickness (H) was varied. Increasing mu or gamma or decreasing R or T led to an increase in the airway opening pressures. The effect of H depended on T: when T was small, opening pressures increased slightly as H was decreased; when T was large, opening pressure was independent of H. Using dimensional analysis, we found that the relative importance of viscous and surface tension forces depends on the capillary number (Ca = microU/gamma). When Ca is small, the opening pressure is approximately 8 gamma/R and acts as an apparent \"yield pressure\" that must be exceeded before airway opening can begin. When Ca is large (Ca greater than 0.5), viscous forces add appreciably to the overall opening pressures. Based on these results, predictions of airway opening times suggest that airway closure can persist through a considerable portion of inspiration when lining fluid viscosity or surface tension are elevated.\r"

However, the role of unilateral phrenic nerve stimulation [left (LPNS) or right (RPNS)] on the blood flow and O2 consumption of the contralateral hemidiaphragm is not known and is explored here. In six anesthetized, mechanically hyperventilated dogs, left phrenic arterial blood flow (Qlpha) was measured (Doppler technique). Supramaximal (10 V, 30 Hz, 0.25-ms duration) LPNS, RPNS, and BPNS at a pacing frequency 15/min and duty cycle of 0.50 were delivered in separate runs. Left hemidiaphragmatic blood samples for gas analyses were obtained by left phrenic venous cannulation. During RPNS, Qlpha and left hemidiaphragmatic O2 consumption (VO2ldi) did not change significantly compared with control. During LPNS and BPNS, there was a significant increase in Qlpha and VO2ldi (P less than 0.01). There was no significant difference in Qlpha and VO2ldi between LPNS and BPNS (P greater than 0.05). We conclude 1) that there is a complete independence of left-right hemidiaphragmatic circulation both at rest and during diaphragm pacing and 2) that during unilateral stimulation transdiaphragmatic pressure is not related to diaphragmatic blood flow.\r"

  ".W": "To determine whether an increase in expiratory motor output accentuates the sensation of dyspnea (difficulty in breathing), the following experiments were undertaken. Ten normal subjects, in a series of 2-min trials, breathed freely (level I) or maintained a target tidal volume equal to (level II) or twice the control (level III) at a breathing frequency of 15/min (similar to the control frequency) with an inspiratory load, an expiratory load, and without loads under hyperoxic normocapnia. In tests at levels II and III, end-expiratory lung volume was maintained at functional residual capacity. A linear resistance of 25 cmH2O.1(-1).s was used for both inspiratory and expiratory loading; peak mouth pressure (Pm) was measured, and the intensity of dyspnea (psi) was assessed with a visual analog scale. The sensation of dyspnea increased significantly with the magnitude of expiratory Pm during expiratory loading (level II: Pm = 9.4 +/- 1.5 (SE) cmH2O, psi = 1.26 +/- 0.35; level III: Pm = 20.3 +/- 2.8 cmH2O, psi = 2.22 +/- 0.48) and with inspiratory Pm during inspiratory loading (level II: Pm = 9.7 +/- 1.2 cmH2O, psi = 1.35 +/- 0.38; level III: Pm = 23.9 +/- 3.0 cmH2O, psi = 2.69 +/- 0.60). However, at each level of breathing, neither the intensity of dyspnea nor the magnitude of peak Pm during loading was different between inspiratory and expiratory loading. The augmentation of dyspnea during expiratory loading was not explained simply by increases in inspiratory activity. The results indicate that heightened expiratory as well as inspiratory motor output causes comparable increases in the sensation of difficulty in breathing.\r"

To test the hypothesis that lung size is a determinant of magnitude of response within a gender, two groups of 14 healthy young adult females differing significantly in forced vital capacity [FVC; i.e., small-lung group mean = 3.74 liters (range 3.2-4.0) and large-lung group mean = 5.11 liters (range 4.5-6.2] were exposed for 1 h to filtered air (FA) and to 0.18 and 0.30 ppm O3. On each occasion, subjects exercised continuously on a cycle ergometer at a work rate that elicited a mean minute ventilation of approximately 47 l/min. For the small-lung group [mean total lung capacity (TLC) = 4.52 liters] exercise O2 uptake was 67% of maximal O2 uptake (VO2max), and that for the large-lung group (TLC 6.37 liters) was 61% of VO2max. Statistical analysis revealed significant decrements for both groups in FVC, forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1.0), and forced expiratory flow rate in the middle half of FVC on exposure to 0.18 and 0.30 ppm O3. Exercise respiratory frequency increased, and tidal volume decreased significantly in both groups in response to 0.18 and 0.30 ppm O3 exposure. On exposure to 0.30 ppm O3, the number of individual subjective symptoms reported and their severity were significantly greater for both groups than those reported for the FA and 0.18 ppm O3 exposures. Both groups evidenced similar percent changes in pulmonary function and exercise ventilation response, and in subjective symptom response.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The most effective treatment modality or combination of modalities is an area of controversy. However, it must be remembered that the approach to management undertaken should be finely tuned to the needs of the particular individual afflicted with the condition. Perhaps with a greater understanding of pathophysiology, more reliable and effective treatments, based on specific pathophysiological mechanisms, may be developed. In addition, tests to reliably predict those patients most likely to progress in their disease might be developed, allowing preventive measures to be taken.\r"

In contrast, the 34K IGF-BP binding ratio was significantly greater in the elderly than in the young (0.30 +/- 0.03 vs. 0.12 +/- 0.01; P less than 0.001) and correlated closely with advancing age (r = 0.64; P less than 0.01). The changes in IGF-BPs found in the elderly are quite similar to alterations in serum IGF-BPs previously reported in GH deficiency. Since several IGF-BPs in vitro have been shown to modulate the mitogenic activity of IGF-I, the serum IGF-BP changes noted above may be important for the growth and maintenance of connective tissue, muscle, and bone during the aging process.\r"

We have developed and validated a RRA which allows direct measurement of receptor-bindable LH in human serum. Using a cultured Leydig tumor cell line (MA-10) known to express the CG/LH receptor as the receptor source and polyacrylamide-gel electrophoresis purified hCG as the radioligand, we have established an assay system with the requisite sensitivity (0.04 ng/tube) to measure circulating LH, without significant alteration in total specific binding upon addition of up to 150 microL gonadotropin-free serum when compared to no serum. Standard curves of hLH diluted in gonadotropin-free serum were not statistically different in slope or ED50 from buffer curves. Dilutions of human serum from postmenopausal women and men with Klinefelter's syndrome containing LH measured in the assay were parallel to the standard curve. Further validation of the RRA included measurement of LH by RRA and RIA in daily serum samples from normal women across the menstrual cycle (n = 6) where there was excellent correlation (P less than 0.001) between RRA and RIA measurements with the exception of the mid-cycle surge where the RRA/RIA ratio fell to 0.5. This LH RRA will be useful in further studies of the physiology and biochemistry of LH in human serum.\r"

  ".U": "90368861\r", 
  ".W": "Although there have been numerous studies on the production of prostaglandins (PGs) by human endometrium in vitro during the menstrual cycle, considerable variation exists in the levels reported during the proliferative vs. the secretory phase. Such variation may be due in part to the difficulty in obtaining endometrium from a precisely known hormonal environment and in part to the use of the different culture systems employed. The aim of the present study was to develop a non-human primate model in which precisely dated endometrial tissue could be obtained reliably. Moreover, PG levels in the endometrium of the rhesus monkey or other primates have not previously been reported during the artificial menstrual cycle. An important objective in establishing such a model was to permit future manipulations of the cycle in vivo [e.g. by omitting the midcycle estradiol (E) peak] to further dissect specific roles of E and progesterone (P) in regulating PG synthesis during the menstrual cycle. Ovariectomized rhesus monkeys were maintained on a standard artificial menstrual cycle via the insertion and removal of Silastic capsules containing E or P. Samples of endometrium (approximately 50 mg) were obtained by hysterotomy under sterile conditions at predetermined stages of separate menstrual cycles: day 9 (midproliferative; n = 5), day 13 (E peak; n = 3), day 14 (1 day post-E peak; n = 5), and day 23 (midsecretory; n = 8). Measurement of the primary PGs in unextracted medium by RIA over 4 days of organ culture indicated PGF2 alpha greater than 6-keto-PGF1 alpha greater than PGE2 greater than thromboxane-B2, PGD2 greater than leukotrienes. PGF2 alpha, the most abundant PG produced on the first day of culture, was low on day 9 and increased dramatically on day 13 (P less than 0.01). On day 14, PGF2 alpha levels fell significantly only 1 day post-E peak (P less than 0.01), while on day 23, after exposure to P in vivo, PGF2 alpha was 10-fold higher (P less than 0.01) than on cycle days 9 and 14. The other PGs measured showed a lower but similar profile at the cycle stages examined. Physiological concentrations of P (5.0 ng/mL) added to cycle day 23 cultures in both the absence and presence of low or high E markedly inhibited the high levels of PGs found in day 23 cultures (P less than 0.01).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

To characterize the defect producing PTH resistance in these cells and determine whether the abnormality is potentially reversible, we evaluated the ability of fibroblasts from patients with PHP-Ib to produce cAMP in response to PTH both before and after exposure to dexamethasone, an agent known to increase PTH responsiveness in other cell types. Before dexamethasone treatment, fibroblasts from five of eight patients with PTH-Ib produced reduced amounts of cAMP in response to PTH (but not prostaglandin E1 and forskolin) compared to that of control cells (6.3 +/- 1.0 and 37.3 +/- 6.3 pmol cAMP/100 micrograms protein, respectively). Whereas dexamethasone pretreatment had no effect on cAMP production by control or PTH-responsive PHP-Ib fibroblasts, it resulted in a dose-dependent increase in PTH-induced cAMP production by PTH-resistant fibroblasts to normal levels in four of five cases. Studies evaluating the binding of radiolabeled PTH did not permit quantification of the small number of high affinity PTH receptors present on these cells. We conclude that PTH resistance in PHP-Ib patients with PTH-resistant fibroblasts results from an abnormality in the expression of or coupling to cyclase of high affinity PTH-receptor complexes. Because it is expressed in only some tissues and is reversible, the defect could be regulatory in nature.\r"

The relationships between the diurnal variation in saliva (free) cortisol and baseline levels of total cortisol, corticosterone-binding globulin (CBG), progesterone, and estrogens were studied in several groups of women (normal nonpregnant, taking a combined oral contraceptive pill, after superovulation therapy, during early and late pregnancy, and postpartum). Saliva cortisol levels were significantly elevated in late pregnancy throughout the day, with preservation of diurnal variation. Total cortisol and CBG levels were also significantly raised in pregnancy, but total cortisol levels were normal in women taking a combined oral contraceptive pill in spite of significantly elevated CBG. There was no relationship between saliva cortisol and progesterone levels, and it is unlikely that the increase in cortisol is due to displacement of cortisol from CBG by progesterone. Cortisol levels fell slowly postpartum over several days, making it improbable that the increase in cortisol is solely due to elevated CRH levels. It appears that increased free and total cortisol levels in pregnancy are related to resetting of the sensitivity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and not merely to raised CBG, progesterone, or CRH levels.\r"

Methods to detect anti-TPO antibodies (anti-TPO Ab) employing purified antigen have been developed, but the available information on the clinical usefulness of this technique is still limited to small patient series. In the present investigation anti-TPO Ab were assayed by a newly developed monoclonal antibody-assisted RIA in a large number (n = 715) of subjects, including 119 normal controls and 596 patients with different autoimmune or nonautoimmune thyroid disease: Anti-TPO Ab were detected in 10 of 119 (8.4%; range, 11-210 U/mL) normal controls, 134 of 181 (74%; range, 11-74.000 U/mL) patients with Graves' disease, all but 1 of 144 (99.3%; range, 11-90.000 U/mL) with Hashimoto's thyroiditis (n - 98) or idiopathic myxedema (n = 46), 20 of 180 (11.1%; range, 11-6.700 U/mL) with miscellaneous nonautoimmune thyroid diseases, 16 of 83 (19.2%; range, 11-6.600 U/mL) patients with differentiated thyroid carcinoma, and in none of 8 patients with subacute thyroiditis. The highest anti-TPO Ab concentrations were found in untreated hypothyroid Hashimoto's thyroiditis, but no simple relationship between anti-TPO Ab levels and thyroid function was observed. Anti-TPO Ab significantly decreased in patients with Graves' disease after treatment with methimazole and in those with hypothyroid Hashimoto's thyroiditis or idiopathic myxedema during L-T4 administration. A highly significant positive correlation (r = 0.979; P less than 0.001) was found between anti-M Ab titers by passive hemagglutination (PH; available in 650 sera) and the corresponding average anti-TPO Ab by RIA; discrepant results were almost exclusively limited to sera with negative or low (1:100-1:400) anti-M Ab titers. Analysis of these discrepant data indicated higher autoimmune disease specificity and sensitivity of anti-TPO Ab RIA tests compared to anti-M Ab by PH. Absorption studies showed that interference of anti-Tg Ab was responsible for anti-M Ab-positive tests in occasional anti-TPO Ab-negative/anti-M Ab-positive sera from autoimmune thyroid disease patients. Anti-TPO Ab determination by RIA was unaffected by circulating thyroglobulin concentrations up to more than 10,000 ng/mL. In conclusion, anti-TPO Ab assay by monoclonal antibody-assisted RIA appears to be more sensitive and specific for thyroid autoimmune diseases than anti-M Ab determination by PH. Since the assay is easy to perform and employs only tracer amounts of purified antigen, these characteristics should allow its rapid diffusion to the clinical routine.\r"

The subjects were living under normal nychtohemeral conditions. The plasma levels of melatonin, cortisol, TSH, PRL, and GH were evaluated by hourly blood samples over 24-h periods on the preceding day and on the last day of each condition. Our main finding is that 5MOP specifically stimulates melatonin secretion in humans, with a pronounced effect when administered during the dark phase of the day (at 2100 h). The other endocrine rhythms were unaffected by 5MOP administration. Melatonin has been shown to interact with the regulation of the human circadian system; this specific stimulation may, therefore, be of great interest in disorders associated with abnormalities of circadian rhythms.\r"

We sought to determine if they also possessed receptors for calcitonin (CT), the third classical calciotropic hormone. We isolated blood mononuclear cells from healthy volunteers to separate monocytes, total lymphocytes, and T-lymphocytes; the purity of the three cell populations was more than 90%, 95%, and 85%, respectively. Salmon CT (sCT) was labeled by the chloramine-T method (SA, 254 muCi/micrograms) without loss of biological activity. We found saturable (16 h at 8 C), specific, high affinity binding sites for [125I]sCT on unstimulated lymphocytes. As for CT receptors on other cells, binding of [125I]sCT was poorly reversible. Binding specificity was demonstrated by the total absence of competing effect of several unrelated hormones; human CT and CT gene-related peptide competed much less efficiently than sCT for the binding sites, whereas PDN-21 had no effect. When plotted according to the method of Scatchard, binding data on the mixed population of T- and B-lymphocytes showed an apparent Kd (mean +/- SD) of 2.9 +/- 1.0 x 10(-10) M (n = 34), with an estimation of 91-8338 (median, 1971) binding sites/cell. The data were repeatedly compatible with an aspect of positive cooperativity between the binding sites, as confirmed by a Hill coefficient greater than 1 (1.18 +/- 0.13). However, this aspect of positive cooperativity in CT binding was not observed on isolated T-lymphocytes (Hill coefficient, 0.96 +/- 0.08; n = 9; P less than 0.001 vs. the mixed population of lymphocytes). CT did not induce a significant increase in cAMP levels, but regulation of receptor concentration was demonstrated by the finding of down-regulation of CT-binding sites after sCT or human CT preincubation. In summary, we have found saturable, specific, high affinity receptors for CT on unstimulated normal human T-lymphocytes, which could, thus, be target sites for CT action on bone metabolism or on the immune system.\r"

The compound was administered in a single daily dose for a period of 6-12 months. The treatment resulted in normalization of plasma PRL levels (less than or equal to 20 micrograms/L) in 5 of 6 women at a mean dose of 135 micrograms (range, 75-300 micrograms) and in 6 of 9 men at a mean dose of 192 micrograms (range, 75-300 micrograms). Among patients for whom computed tomographic scans were available before and after at least 6 months of therapy, definite tumor shrinkage occurred in 6 of 7 patients. Libido was improved in 5 of 6 women and in 6 of 8 men, galactorrhea disappeared in all cases (3 women and 1 man) and menses resumed in 3 of 5 women. Plasma testosterone rose to normal levels in 3 of 6 men who were not receiving testosterone injections. The PRL response to TRH was blunted in 4 of 6 patients with normalized basal PRL. Serum total cholesterol was reduced by CV 205-502 treatment in women from 5.35 +/- 0.49 to 4.63 +/- 0.51 mmol/L (P = 0.031) and in men from 5.93 +/- 0.89 to 5.28 +/- 0.82 mmol/L (P = 0.045). Side-effects included mainly headache, nausea, and dizziness. One side-effect or more occurred transiently and with mild intensity in 14 patients. No patient discontinued the therapy because of side-effects. In conclusion, CV 205-502 appears to be a safe and valuable compound in the treatment of patients with PRL-secreting macroadenomas.\r"

The 24-h GH profiles were analyzed using the Pulsar program. Girls had significantly higher 24-h GH secretion than boys (P less than 0.004). Children with end-stage nephrotic syndrome had higher baseline GH levels and total area under the curve (AUCo) than patients with dysplastic kidneys (P less than 0.05), while the area under the curve above baseline (AUCb) was similar in all types of renal diseases. The type of treatment (conservative, peritoneal, hemodialysis) did not significantly influence the 24-h GH secretion. No correlation was found between 24-h GH profiles and age, height SDS for chronological age, height velocity SDS for bone age, and weight for height. Fourteen children showed a normal 24-h GH profile, defined as a GH profile with well defined, regular GH peaks returning to baseline GH levels and a distinct day and night pattern (AUCb, 90-300 micrograms/L.24 h). Four children had low profiles, with GH peaks below 10 micrograms/L, returning to baseline GH levels and occurring almost exclusively during the night (AUCb, less than 90 micrograms/L.24 h). The remaining four children had elevated 24-h GH profiles, with GH peaks on top of elevated baseline GH levels of more than 3 micrograms/L (AUCb, 35-205 micrograms/L.24 h; AUCo greater than 300 micrograms/L.24 h). In all patients 24-h urinary GH and beta 2-globulin excretion was 100-1000 times higher than that in controls. The urinary GH excretion correlated significantly with all characteristics of the 24-h GH profiles (r = 0.57-0.59; P less than 0.05). The maximal GH response during the arginine tolerance test was normal in 66% of the children. The mean (+/- SD) SDS for bone age for the IGF-I plasma levels was +1.1 (1.9), and that for IGF-II was +3.6 (3.4). IGF-I levels correlated significantly with the AUCb, maximum GH, and GH peak characteristics of the 24-h GH profiles (r = 0.05-0.73; P less than 0.02-0.001).

The effectiveness of the treatment, however, may depend on its duration. We investigated the effects of prolonged incubation with bromocriptine on the release and intracellular hormone and alpha-subunit concentrations in 10 such adenomas in vitro. The release of FSH, LH, alpha-subunit, or a combination of these was demonstrated in 7 tumors. Bromocriptine significantly suppressed this release in 6 tumors. In 5 tumors bromocriptine had an inhibitory effect on gonadotropin and/or alpha-subunit release which increased with duration of culture. Withdrawal of bromocriptine during the culture period led to a recovery of gonadotropin or alpha-subunit release in the 2 tumors in which it was tested. Intracellular hormone and alpha-subunit concentrations in 3 of 4 tumors cultured for 4 or more weeks were significantly lower in bromocriptine-treated than in untreated cells. We conclude that 1) bromocriptine can suppress the in vitro release of gonadotropins and alpha-subunit from the majority of clinically nonfunctioning, gonadotroph, and alpha-subunit-secreting pituitary adenomas; 2) during prolonged incubation of these tumors with bromocriptine, this drug has a time-dependent increasing inhibitory effect on the release and synthesis of gonadotropins and alpha-subunit, which eventually may lead to decreased intracellular concentrations of these glycoproteins.\r"

  ".W": "The accumulation of 5 alpha-dihydrotestosterone (DHT), particularly in stroma, is a possible etiological factor in regard of the age-dependent development of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). In this context, we have recently demonstrated age-dependent alterations of 5 alpha-reductase, which is responsible for the irreversible conversion of testosterone to DHT. Therefore, it was also of interest to study possible age-dependent alterations of those enzymes mainly involved in the reversible metabolism of DHT to 5 alpha-androstanediols. Thus, we determined, in the presence of NADPH/NADP+, kinetic parameters [Km and maximum velocity (Vmax)] of 3-hydroxysteroid oxidoreductases (3 alpha-HSORred, 3 beta-HSORred, and 3 alpha-HSORox) in separated epithelium and stroma of 10 normal (NPR) and 20 hyperplastic prostates (BPH) and correlated the data with the age of the donors (15-86 yr). The mean Km (nanomolar concentrations +/- SEM) of 3 alpha-HSORred was significantly (P less than 0.01) higher in epithelium (NPR, 1391 +/- 181; BPH, 2150 +/- 157) than in stroma (NPR, 778 +/- 22; BPH, 749 +/- 62), indicating the presence of epithelial and stromal enzymes. The mean Km values of 3 beta-HSORred and 3 alpha-HSORox were similar. Concerning 3 alpha-HSORred, the mean potential capacity, i.e. the quotient of Vmax/Km (+/- SEM), was significantly (P less than 0.01) higher in epithelium (0.56 +/- 0.08) than in stroma (0.19 +/- 0.02) of NPR, while in BPH nearly identical mean potential capacities were found in epithelium (0.33 +/- 0.04) and stroma (0.26 +/- 0.02). The respective Vmax/Km of 3 beta-HSORred and 3 alpha-HSORox were significantly (P less than 0.05) lower. In addition, the potential capacity of all three enzymes was distinctly lower than the potential DHT-forming capacity of 5 alpha-reductase. With advancing age, the Vmax/Km decreased significantly (P less than 0.001; 3 alpha-HSORred and 3 beta-HSORred) or tendentiously (3 alpha-HSORox) in epithelium, while in stroma a significant (P less than 0.001; 3 alpha-HSORred and 3 alpha-HSORox) or tendentious (3 beta-HSORred) increase with age was found. Our results indicate that aging has a significant impact on DHT-removing enzymes. However, these enzymes counterbalance only in part the strong potential capacity of 5 alpha-reductase.\r"

The effect of retinoids (13 cis-RA) was studied on the proliferation and differentiation of a human follicular cell line in vitro (UCLA R0 82 W-1). A significant and dose-dependent reduction (P less than 0.001) in cell number and [3H] thymidine uptake was found in cells exposed to 13 cis-RA up to 10 microM. Higher concentrations of 13 cis-RA, however, led to a dose-dependent restoration of cell proliferation. Various parameters of differentiation increased under the influence of 13 cis-RA (10 microM) over nonexposed cells. The 125I uptake increased 4-fold over that in control nonexposed cells (P less than 0.05). [125I] Epidermal growth factor binding increased 5-fold, and [125I] human TSH binding increased significantly after exposure to 13 cis-RA (P less than 0.02). Deiodinase activity, however, was significantly lower in 13 cis-RA exposed cells than in control cells. The present study shows that 13 cis-RA (10 microM) drives the tumor cells toward a more normal state of proliferation and differentiation.\r"

  ".W": "A chemiluminescent TSH assay (detection limit, less than 0.01 mU/L) allows for accurate measurement of subnormal TSH concentrations. We retrospectively analyzed serum TSH and the free T4 (fT4) index of 460 consecutive endocrine clinic visits to determine the usefulness of TSH measurements alone in the assessment of thyroid function. Additionally, case histories were presented nonconsecutively to one of us (TSH alone or TSH with fT4) to determine if knowledge of the fT4 level would alter management. Of hypothyroid patients on replacement therapy (n = 127), 60% had concordant fT4 and TSH, 14% had subnormal TSH with normal fT4, 18% had high TSH with normal fT4, and 4% normal TSH with high fT4; only 4% were managed differently when the fT4 level was known in addition to TSH. Of the patients receiving suppressive therapy with TSH levels above 0.05 mU/L (n = 81), only 4% were managed differently when fT4 was known; 4% had high fT4. With TSH levels below 0.05 mU/L (n = 64), knowledge of fT4 was felt to be necessary for management in all cases; 53% had high fT4. Twenty-three of 46 (50%) patients being treated for hyperthyroidism had discordant TSH and fT4, including 7 patients with low TSH and low fT4. Two of 21 (10%) patients screened with pituitary/hypothalamic disease had discordant TSH and fT4, and 4 of 9 (44%) patients treated with L-T4 for secondary hypothyroidism had subnormal TSH. Knowledge of fT4 was felt to be necessary in all these cases. We conclude that TSH alone is sufficient for screening and monitoring L-T4 replacement or suppression therapy if TSH levels are above 0.05 mU/L. These patients account for the majority of visits to our endocrine clinic. TSH alone is misleading in pituitary disease and during the treatment of hyperthyroidism. fT4 is needed if TSH levels are less than 0.05 mU/L to assess the degree of hyperthyroidism.\r"

No clinically apparent ill effects occurred. Changes in endocrine function were largely short-term and transient: at 7-10 days after surgery, urinary catecholamine levels were significantly increased, PRL levels were significantly elevated despite markedly increased serum dopamine levels, and gonadal steroid levels (estradiol and testosterone) were significantly lower despite unchanged basal and stimulated levels of gonadotropins. Dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate was significantly reduced at 7-10 days after surgery and remained low at 3-6 months. Other changes at 3-6 months after surgery included increased stimulated corticotropin levels and reduced serum aldosterone response to upright posture. The changes at 7-10 days were probably due to stress or unilateral adrenalectomy or both; the changes at 3-6 months were likely due to unilateral adrenalectomy. We conclude that unilateral adrenalectomy and autologous adrenal medullary transplantation to the central nervous system does not produce clinically important changes in endocrine function; however, possible adverse consequences of long-term reduction of dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate levels cannot be excluded.\r"

In all three patients, an A to G transition was identified at position 985 of the coding region. Since no appropriate restriction sites for detecting this point mutation were found, we devised a PCR method that amplifies an 87-bp fragment from position 955. In the 5' primer encompassing positions 955 to 984, A-981 was artificially substituted with C. With the presence of C-981 and G-985, an Nco I restriction site is introduced in the mutant copies. When cDNA or genomic DNA from fibroblasts of nine MCAD-deficient patients were tested with this method, the copies from all of them completely cleaved into two shorter fragments by Nco I, indicating their homozygosity for the A----G-985 transition. In contrast, the copies from all eight controls remained intact. Thus, this A----G-985 transition is the single prevalent mutation causing MCAD deficiency, a highly unusual feature for any genetic disorder. The PCR/Nco I digestion method is suitable for the diagnosis of MCAD deficiency.\r"

We previously described increased PTP immunoreactivity in AD brains and now report high levels in the developing human brain. Using a full-length cloned bovine PTP cDNA and synthetic oligonucleotides corresponding to human PTP cDNA, which is identical to human islet cell regeneration factor, we analyzed the expression of PTP in pancreas and brain. A major 0.9-kb as well as several minor transcripts were identified in human pancreas. In AD brain, the same size transcripts were detected by Northern analysis, primer extension assay, or polymerase chain reaction amplification of cDNAs generated by reverse transcriptase assay. There were significantly higher levels of PTP mRNA in brains with AD compared with aged controls, with increased amounts of 1.2-, 0.6-, and 0.4-kb transcripts by Northern analysis. In situ hybridization localized expression to pyramidal neurons in the cerebral cortex, the same population that contains neurofibrillary tangles and high levels of immunoreactive PTP. These findings suggest that AD is associated with enhanced expression of PTP-related transcripts with intraneuronal accumulation of PTP-like proteins.\r"

We hypothesized that this lipemia may be part of a defensive mechanism by which the body combats the toxic effects of circulating endotoxin. We tested the effects of mixtures of endotoxin, lipoproteins, and lipoprotein-free plasma and determined the ability of varying concentrations of human very low density lipoproteins (VLDL) and chylomicrons, as well as low density lipoproteins (LDL) and high density lipoproteins (HDL), and of the synthetic lipid emulsion SOYACAL to prevent endotoxin-induced death in mice. This study demonstrates that the triglyceride-rich VLDL and chylomicrons, as well as cholesterol-rich LDL and HDL, and cholesterol-free SOYACAL can protect against endotoxin-induced death. Protection required small amounts of lipoprotein-free plasma, and depended on the incubation time and the concentration of lipoprotein lipid. Despite stringent techniques to prevent exogenous endotoxin contamination eight of ten duplicate VLDL preparations contained endotoxin (5,755 +/- 3,514 ng endotoxin/mg triglyceride, mean +/- SEM) making the isolation of endotoxin-free VLDL difficult. In contrast, simultaneous preparations of LDL and HDL were relatively free of endotoxin contamination (3 +/- 3 and 320 +/- 319 ng/mg total cholesterol, respectively), suggesting that the contamination of VLDL occurs in vivo and not during the isolation procedure. These observations suggest a possible role for increased triglyceride-rich lipoproteins in the host's defense against endotoxemia and infection.\r"

The resulting fractions were 98% or more pure for a single subclass. In all 11 patients, TSAb activity appeared to be confined to the IgG1 fraction as determined by cAMP production on addition of the fractions to the FRTL-5 rat thyroid cell line. In all of eight specimens from seven patients so tested, the whole serum activity was recovered in the IgG1 fraction, after adjusting for the recovery of the isotype from the column. TSAb activity in one serum comprised both lambda and kappa light chains but was IgG1 restricted. This IgG subclass restriction was not found when the same fractions were tested for thyroglobulin, microsomal/thyroid peroxidase, or tetanus toxoid antibody activity. Together with previous results showing marked restriction of both light chain usage and isoelectric point of TSAb, these results support the idea that Graves' disease may be the result of an oligo- or possibly monoclonal response at the B cell level.\r"

Here we report a similar mutation on 21 alleles from 13 unrelated affected probands with LPL deficiency of French Canadian, English, Polish, German, Dutch, and East Indian ancestry. We show that an identical missense mutation within exon 5, resulting in an amino acid substitution of glutamic acid for glycine at position 188, is responsible for LPL deficiency in 21 of 88 LPL alleles assessed. This mutation alters an Ava II restriction site in exon 5 and will allow a rapid screening test for this mutation in patients with LPL deficiency. This mutation has occurred on the same haplotype in all the unrelated affected persons suggesting a common origin. The amino acid substitution lies within the longest segment of homology for LPL in different species and results in a protein that is catalytically defective.\r"

The phenotypic expression of heterozygous LPL deficiency has not been so clearly defined. We studied the pedigree of a proband known to be homozygous for a mutation resulting in nonfunctional LPL. Hybridization of DNA from 126 members with allele-specific probes detected 29 carriers of the mutant allele. Adipose tissue LPL activity, measured previously, was reduced by 50% in carriers, but did not reliably distinguish them from noncarriers. Carriers were prone to the expression of a form of familial hypertriglyceridemia characterized by increased plasma triglyceride, VLDL cholesterol and apolipoprotein B, and decreased LDL and HDL cholesterol concentrations. These manifestations were age modulated, with conspicuous differences between carriers and noncarriers observed only after age 40. Several noncarriers exhibited similar lipid abnormalities, but without the inverse relationship between VLDL cholesterol and LDL cholesterol noted among carriers. In addition to age and carrier status, the potentially reversible conditions, obesity, hyperinsulinemia and lipid-raising drug use were contributory. Thus heterozygous lipoprotein lipase deficiency, together with age-related influences, may account for a form of familial hypertriglyceridemia.\r"

Inorganic phosphate (Pi) and phosphocreatine (PCr) were monitored by magnetic resonance spectroscopy in both forearms at rest and during submaximal wrist flexion exercise at 6, 12, 24, and 36 J.min-1 before and after exercise training. Simultaneous measurements of limb blood flow were made by plethysmography at 12, 24, and 36 J.min-1. Forearm muscle mass and endurance were measured by magnetic resonance imaging and wrist flexion exercise before and after training. The Pi/PCr ratio and pH were calculated from the measured Pi and PCr. Exercise cardiac output, heart rate, plasma norepinephrine, and lactate measured during training were not elevated above resting values, confirming that training was localized to the forearm flexor muscles. After training, muscle bioenergetics, as assessed by the slope of the regression line relating Pi/PCr to submaximal workloads, were improved in the trained forearm of each patient, although muscle mass, limb blood flow, and pH were unchanged. Forearm endurance increased by greater than 260% after training. In the dominant untrained forearm, none of the measured indices were affected. We conclude that localized forearm exercise training in CHF patients improves muscle energetics at submaximal workloads in the trained muscle, an effect which is independent of muscle mass, limb blood flow, or a central cardiovascular response during training. These findings indicate that peripheral muscle metabolic and functional abnormalities in CHF can be improved without altering cardiac performance.\r"

The incorporation of radiolabeled methyl groups from S-adenosyl-L-methionine in diabetic sarcolemma was significantly depressed at all three catalytic sites (I, II, and III) of the methyltransferase system. An increase in methyl group incorporation was evident at site I without any changes at sites II and III in diabetic sarcoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria. Similar changes were also seen for the individual N-methylated lipids (monomethyl-, dimethylphosphatidylethanolamine, and phosphatidylcholine) specifically formed at each catalytic site in all cardiac membranes from diabetic animals. These alterations in N-methylation were reversible by a 14-d insulin therapy to the diabetic animals. In the presence of 10 microM ATP and 0.1 microM Ca2+, N-methylation was maximally activated at site I in both control and diabetic sarcolemma and sarcoplasmic reticulum, but not in mitochondria. Incubation of cardiac membranes with of S-adenosyl-L-methionine showed that Ca2(+)-stimulated ATPase activities in both sarcolemma and sarcoplasmic reticulum were augmented; however, the activation of diabetic sarcolemma was lesser and that of diabetic sarcoplasmic reticulum was greater in comparison with the control preparations. These results identify alterations in phosphatidylethanolamine N-methylation in subcellular membranes from diabetic heart, and it is suggested that these defects may be crucial in the development of cardiac dysfunction in chronic diabetes.\r"

  ".W": "We have studied the interaction of the congenitally abnormal type IIA and IIB von Willebrand factor (vWF) molecules, both lacking the larger multimeric forms, with the two vWF binding sites on platelets, the glycoprotein (GP) Ib-IX and GP IIb-IIIa complexes. Variant as well as normal (N) vWF were purified from plasma. Estimates for binding of subunit molecules per platelet at saturation (Bmax) and dissociation constant in moles/liter (Kd), respectively, were obtained from binding isotherms of 125I-labeled vWF, with the following results. In the presence of ristocetin (binding to GP Ib-IX): N, 25,693 and 0.5 x 10(-8); IIA, both parameters not measurable; IIB, 17,708 and 0.87 x 10(-8). After thrombin stimulation (binding to GP IIb-IIIa): N, 17,059 and 1.12 x 10(-8); IIA, 23,751 and 4.87 x 10(-8); IIB, 19,890 and 2.52 x 10(-8). Distinct experiments based on measuring the ability of the variant species (from the same patients and one additional IIB patient) to inhibit the binding of normal 125I-vWF to platelets gave results in agreement with those reported above. Other studies showed that only IIB vWF bound to platelets in the absence of any mediating substance (Kd = 5.21 x 10(-8) mol/liter and Bmax = 9,599 subunits per platelet) and induced aggregation at a concentration of 10 micrograms/ml (3.6 x 10(-8) M). Thus, IIB vWF binds to GP Ib-IX with high affinity and induces platelet aggregation, whether with or without ristocetin, in spite of the absence of larger multimers. In contrast, the binding of IIA vWF to GP Ib-IX occurs with very decreased affinity, and this defective function may result from specific structural abnormalities rather than just being a reflection of the absence of larger multimeric forms. Both IIA and IIB vWF exhibit decreased affinity for GP IIb-IIIa. In this case, the extent of the defect correlates with the absence of larger multimers.\r"

  ".U": "90368996\r", 
  ".W": "The effects of lovastatin therapy on the parameters of body cholesterol metabolism were explored in nine hypercholesterolemic patients. Long-term cholesterol turnover studies were performed before therapy, and were repeated after 15 mo of lovastatin therapy (40 mg/d) while continuing on therapy. The major question addressed was whether a reduction in plasma cholesterol level with lovastatin would be associated with a reduction in the whole-body production rate of cholesterol or with the sizes of exchangeable body cholesterol pools as determined by the three-pool model of cholesterol turnover. The mean plasma cholesterol level decreased 19.4% (from 294 to 237 mg/dl), and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol decreased 23.8% (from 210 to 159 mg/dl) with lovastatin therapy. Changes in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol level were not significant. The cholesterol production rate did not change significantly with therapy (1.09 +/- 0.10 [mean +/- S.D.] vs. 1.17 +/- 0.09 g/d). By comparison, colestipol and niacin treatment in three other subjects more than doubled the cholesterol production rate (1.14 +/- 0.28 vs. 2.42 +/- 0.34 g/d). Thus, hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibition by lovastatin at the therapeutic dose used here did not change the steady-state rate of whole-body cholesterol synthesis. Despite the changes in plasma cholesterol levels, no significant changes were seen in the values of M1, of M3 or of Mtot, the sizes of the pools of rapidly, of slowly, and of total body exchangeable cholesterol. Conclusion: lovastatin therapy to lower plasma cholesterol does not lead to corresponding reductions in body cholesterol pools or to a reduction in the rate of whole-body cholesterol synthesis. In the new steady state that exists during long-term lovastatin therapy, along with increased expression of the genes for HMG-CoA reductase and the LDL receptor, the body compensates for the effects of the drug so that cholesterol production rate and tissue pool sizes are not changed from pretreatment values.\r"

  ".U": "90369000\r", 
  ".W": "It has been recently proposed that 11 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (11 beta-OHSD) is responsible for aldosterone tissue specificity. A 11 beta-OHSD deficiency has been invoked as a cause of the syndrome of apparent mineralocorticoid excess, and 11 beta-OHSD inhibition by liquorice has been invoked to explain the hypertension induced by this drug. Since the renal tubule is composed of aldosterone-sensitive and insensitive segments, we determined the distribution of 11 beta-OHSD along the rabbit tubule. Pools of tubular segments isolated by microdissection were incubated for 2 h at 37 degrees C in the presence of [3H]corticosterone (3H-B, 8.10(-9) M). Afterwards, the amounts of 3H-B and of the metabolite 11-dehydrocorticosterone (3H-A) were determined using HPLC analysis. In the proximal tubule, in either its convoluted or straight portion, and in the medullary thick ascending limb, the amount of 3H-A was 19.6 +/- 3.8% (n = 12), 17.9 +/- 3.4 (n = 8), and 15.0 +/- 2.2 (n = 4), respectively, of the sum of 3H-A + 3H-B. In the cortical ascending limb and the collecting tubule in its cortical and medullary parts, it was 74.7 +/- 6.8% (n = 4), 74.1 +/- 4.9 (n = 9) and 64.6 +/- 14.1 (n = 3), respectively. In both proximal and cortical collecting tubule, addition of carbenoxolone 8.10(-4) M, an inhibitor of 11 beta-OHSD, almost completely inhibited the conversion of 3H-B to 3H-A. Thus, 11 beta-OHSD activity was high in the aldosterone-sensitive segments, and low in the aldosterone-insensitive segments. These results strongly favor the hypothesis that 11 beta-OHSD is a key enzyme in mineralocorticoid tissue specificity along the rabbit nephron. They reinforce the notion that a defect in 11 beta-OHSD plays a major role in the syndrome of apparent mineralocorticoid excess and liquorice-induced hypertension.\r"

  ".W": "Cigarette smoking is associated with hyperplasia of pulmonary neuroendocrine cells and variably increased levels of bombesin-like peptides in the lower respiratory tract. Because the neuropeptide bombesin is a chemoattractant for monocytes and a mitogen for 3T3 fibroblasts, we hypothesized that an excess of neuroendocrine cells and bombesin-like peptides could contribute to lung inflammation and fibrosis in certain cigarette smokers. Eosinophilic granuloma is a fibrotic lung disease of unknown etiology that in adults occurs almost invariably in cigarette smokers. We quantitated neuroendocrine cells with bombesin-like immunoreactivity in open lung biopsies from patients with eosinophilic granuloma (n = 6) and compared these with cigarette smokers (n = 6) who underwent lung resection for reasons other than primary lung disease. In addition, we compared them with patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (n = 8), a disease not associated with cigarette smoking. Finally, we also examined the mitogenic effect of bombesin on cultured human adult lung fibroblasts. The patients with eosinophilic granuloma exhibited a 10-fold increase in neuroendocrine cells with bombesin-like immunoreactivity compared to both smokers (P = 0.005) and patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (P = 0.005). In addition, bombesin produced a significant mitogenic effect on cultured human adult lung fibroblasts at concentrations of 1 nM and above. We conclude that increased numbers of pulmonary neuroendocrine cells with bombesin-like immunoreactivity are commonly found in patients with eosinophilic granuloma and, since bombesin-like peptides are chemotactic for monocytes and mitogenic for human lung fibroblasts, we speculate that neuroendocrine cell hyperplasia may be important in the pathogenesis of eosinophilic granuloma in adult cigarette smokers.\r"

The purpose of this investigation was to determine whether IL 2 alone or in combination with lymphokine-activated killer cells (LAK) cells depress cardiac function using the isolated, perfused, working rat heart preparation. Male Sprague-Dawley rats (250-350 g) were anesthetized and the hearts were removed and placed on the perfusion apparatus. Hearts were perfused with oxygenated Krebs-Henseleit buffer (KHB), or oxygenated KHB containing IL 2 alone, IL 2-Media (cell culture media supplemented with 1,500 U IL 2/ml), LYMPH (cell culture media from cultured mononuclear cells from healthy volunteers), or LAK (cell culture media from cultured lymphocytes harvested from patients receiving IL 2/LAK in the presence of 1,500 U/ml IL 2). The cells were removed before perfusion (n = 9). Cardiac output and coronary flow were measured at 20-min intervals with preload constant (afterload varied or afterload constant (preload varied). The results indicate a significant depression in cardiac function in hearts treated with LAK. This depression was evident at 20 min and was more pronounced at 60 min. Washout of the KHB plus LAK reversed this depression. Thus, IL 2-stimulated/cultured human mononuclear cells produce a soluble factor that produces a reversible severe depression of cardiac function.\r"

  ".W": "Human ovarian cancer, the leading cause of death from gynecologic malignancy, tends to remain localized to the peritoneal cavity until late in the disease. In established disease, ascitic fluid accumulates in the peritoneal cavity. We have previously demonstrated that this ascitic fluid is a potent source of in vitro mitogenic activity including at least one unique growth factor. We now report that the human ovarian adenocarcinoma line, HEY, can be induced to grow intraperitoneally in immunodeficient nude mice in the presence (23/28 mice), but not absence (0/21 mice) of ascitic fluid from ovarian cancer patients. Ascitic fluid from patients with benign disease did not have similar effects on intraperitoneal growth of HEY cells (1/15 mice). Once tumors were established by injections of exogenous ascitic fluid, they could progress in the absence of additional injections of ascitic fluid. The mice eventually developed ascitic fluid which contained potent growth factor activity, suggesting that the tumors eventually produced autologous growth factors. This nude mouse model provides a system to study the action of ovarian cancer growth factors on tumor growth in vivo and to evaluate preclinically, therapeutic approaches designed to counteract the activity of these growth factors.\r"

  ".W": "Proopiomelanocortin is a polypeptide precursor molecule, the processing of which generates ACTH, beta-endorphin, the beta- and gamma-lipotropins, the joining peptide, and the NH2-terminal fragment. Anterior pituitary corticotrophs are the major site of proopiomelanocortin gene expression in man and the predominant, if not sole source of circulating ACTH. Recent data have established that proopiomelanocortin gene expression also occurs in various normal nonpituitary tissues, one of the best studied being the testis. In this latter organ the dominant gene products are short transcripts of approximately 800 nucleotides, which lack the first two exons of the gene and cannot encode a complete proopiomelanocortin molecule. In this report we show that the mode of proopiomelanocortin gene expression is occasionally modified in human Leydig cell tumors: a 1,200-nucleotide mRNA species identical to that in the pituitary is produced. It results from the usual (pituitary) start site of transcription and thus can encode the complete proopiomelanocortin molecule. In two out of six tumors, large amounts of the 1,200-nucleotide transcript led to a dramatic increase of approximately 1,000-fold in proopiomelanocortin peptide concentrations as compared with the normal and peritumoral testis. Proopiomelanocortin processing in these tumors generates various peptide fragments including ACTH. These results may help to understand the mechanism of proopiomelanocortin expression in nonpituitary tumors and have implications for the more general phenomenon of ectopic hormone secretion.\r"

All three sera exhibited C8 alpha-gamma bands that dissociated into alpha and gamma chains under reducing conditions. Quantitation of the alpha-gamma subunit in these sera by a sensitive ELISA revealed an amount approximately 1% of that found in normal human serum. A similar assay performed with a specific antiserum to C8 beta showed unexpectedly low levels of C8 beta in these sera, which were confirmed by hemolytic titration of C8 beta. The remarkable differences between C8 alpha-gamma and C8 beta in the C8 alpha-gamma deficient sera was that in spite of their comparable immunochemical levels, C8 beta still exhibited functional activity whereas C8 alpha-gamma was totally inactive. That the residual C8 alpha-gamma was inactive was also proved by its inability to show lytic bands in an overlay system after SDS-PAGE and subsequent removal of SDS. The implications of these findings for a novel concept of C8 deficiency are discussed.\r"

  ".U": "90369009\r", 
  ".W": "To study the protective effects of maternal thyroxine (T4) and 3,5,3'-triiodothyronine (T3) in congenital hypothyroidism, we gave pregnant rats methimazole (MMI), an antithyroid drug that crosses the placenta, and infused them with three different doses of T4 or T3. The concentrations of both T4 and T3 were determined in maternal and fetal plasma and tissues (obtained near term) by specific RIAs. Several thyroid hormone-dependent biological end-points were also measured. MMI treatment resulted in marked fetal T4 and T3 deficiency. Infusion of T4 into the mothers increased both these pools in a dose-dependent fashion. There was a preferential increase of T3 in the fetal brain. Thus, with a T4 dose maintaining maternal euthyroidism, fetal brain T3 reached normal values, although fetal plasma T4 was 40% of normal and plasma TSH was high. The infusion of T3 pool into the mothers increased the total fetal extrathyroidal T3 pool in a dose-dependent fashion. The fetal T4 pools were not increased, however, and this deprived the fetal brain (and possibly the pituitary) of local generation of T3 from T4. As a consequence, fetal brain T3 deficiency was not mitigated even when dams were infused with a toxic dose of T3. The results show that (a) there is a preferential protection of the brain of the hypothyroid fetus from T3 deficiency; (b) maternal T4, but not T3, plays a crucial role in this protection, and (c) any condition which lowers maternal T4 (including treatment with T3) is potentially harmful for the brain of a hypothyroid fetus. Recent confirmation of transplacental passage of T4 in women at term suggests that present results are relevant for human fetuses with impairment of thyroid function. Finding signs of hypothyroidism at birth does not necessarily mean that the brain was unprotected in utero, provided maternal T4 is normal. It is crucial to realize that maintainance of maternal \"euthyroidism\" is not sufficient, as despite hypothyroxinemia, the mothers may be clinically euthyroid if their T3 levels are normal.\r"

  ".W": "alpha I/74 hereditary elliptocytosis (HE) is a subgroup of HE in which patients exhibit an impaired self-association of spectrin dimers and an abnormal proteolytic cleavage of the alpha I domain of spectrin. We studied a family in which the proband presented with a severe neonatal hemolytic anemia with poikilocytosis. Biochemical analysis of erythrocytes from the proband and his family members allowed us to ascertain a diagnosis of homozygosity for alpha I/74 HE in the proband and heterozygosity in his parents and several of their offspring. Results of polymorphism linkage analysis suggested that the defect in this family was located in beta rather than alpha spectrin. We analyzed the 3' end of the beta-spectrin gene of the proband and detected a mutation that changes a codon for alanine to one for proline. Allele-specific oligomer hybridization on slot blots of DNA from other family members confirmed the presence of the mutation only in members heterozygous for the disorder. This is the first example of a point mutation in the beta-spectrin chain that is associated with defective spectrin dimer self-association and an abnormal proteolytic cleavage of the alpha chain. Based on this finding, we propose a model for the mechanism of interaction between the alpha- and beta-spectrin chains.\r"

  ".W": "We examined the relationship between cholesterol biosynthesis and total and high affinity LDL binding in liver specimens from two sitosterolemic and 12 healthy control subjects who died unexpectedly and whose livers became available when no suitable recipient for transplantation was identified. Accelerated atherosclerosis, unrestricted intestinal sterol absorption, increased plasma and tissue plant sterol concentrations, and low cholesterol synthesis characterize this disease. Mean total microsomal HMG-CoA reductase (rate-control controlling enzyme for cholesterol biosynthesis) activity was sevenfold higher (98.1 +/- 28.8 vs. 15.0 +/- 2.0 pmol/mg protein per min) and microsomal enzyme protein mass was eightfold larger (1.43 +/- 0.41 vs. 0.18 +/- 0.04 relative densitometric U/mg protein) in 11 controls than the average for two sitosterolemic liver specimens. HMG-CoA reductase mRNA probed with pRED 227 and pHRED 102 was decreased to barely detectable levels in the sitosterolemic livers. In addition, there was a 50% decrease in the rate [2-14C]mevalonic acid was converted to cholesterol by sitosterolemic liver slices compared with controls (112 vs. 224 +/- 32 pmol/g liver per h). In contrast, average total LDL binding was 60% greater (326 vs. 204 +/- 10 ng/mg), and high affinity (receptor-mediated) binding 165% more active (253 vs. 95.1 +/- 8.2 ng/mg) in two sitosterolemic liver membrane specimens than the mean for 12 controls. Liver morphology was intact although sitosterolemic hepatocytes and microsomes contained 24 and 14% less cholesterol, respectively, and 10-100 times more plant sterols and 5 alpha-stanols than control specimens. We postulate that inadequate cholesterol biosynthesis is an inherited abnormality in sitosterolemia and may be offset by augmented receptor-mediated LDL catabolism to supply cellular sterols that cannot be formed.\r"

  ".W": "The activation patterns of surface adherent neutrophils are modulated via interaction of extracellular matrix proteins with neutrophil integrins. To evaluate neutrophil bactericidal activity, Staphylococcus aureus adherent to biological surfaces were incubated with neutrophils and serum, and the survival of surface bacteria was determined. When compared to albumin-coated surfaces, the bactericidal activity of neutrophils adherent to purified human extracellular matrix was markedly enhanced (mean survival: 34.2% +/- 9.0% of albumin, P less than 0.0001) despite similar efficient ingestion of extracellular bacteria. Enhancement of killing was observed when surfaces were coated with purified constituents of extracellular matrix, i.e., fibronectin, fibrinogen, laminin, vitronectin, or type IV collagen. In addition to matrix proteins, the tetrapeptide RGDS (the sequence recognized by integrins) crosslinked to surface bound albumin was also active (survival: 74.5% +/- 5.5% of albumin, P less than 0.02), and fibronectin-increased killing was inhibited by soluble RGDS. Chemiluminescence measurements and experiments with CGD neutrophils revealed that both oxygen-dependent and -independent bactericidal mechanisms are involved. In conclusion, matrix proteins enhance intracellular bactericidal activity of adherent neutrophils, presumably by integrin recognition of RGDS-containing ligands. These results indicate a role for extracellular matrix proteins in the enhancement of the host defense against pyogenic infections.\r"

  ".U": "90369016\r", 
  ".W": "Insulin-like growth factors (IGFs) in blood form two complexes with specific binding proteins (BPs): a large, growth hormone (GH)-dependent complex with restricted capillary permeability, and a smaller complex, inversely related to GH, with high turnover of its IGF pool and free capillary permeability. The distribution of BPs and of IGFs I and II between these complexes was studied in sera from healthy adults treated with IGF I or/and GH and from patients with extrapancreatic tumor hypoglycemia. Like GH, IGF I administration raises IGF I and two glycosylation variants of IGFBP-3 in the large complex, but unlike GH drastically reduces IGF II. During IGF I infusion, IGFBP-3 appears in the small complex whose IGFBP-2 and IGF I increase three- to fivefold and fivefold, respectively. GH treatment, associated with elevated insulin levels, suppresses IGFBP-2 and inhibits its increase owing to infused IGF I. The small complex of tumor sera contains increased amounts of IGFBP-2 and -3, and two- to threefold elevated IGF II. Conclusions: low GH and/or insulin during IGF I infusion and in extrapancreatic tumor hypoglycemia enhance expression of IGFBP-2 and favor partition of IGFBP-3 into the small complex. Free capillary passage and high turnover of its increased IGF I or II pools may contribute to compensate for suppressed insulin secretion during IGF I infusion or to development of tumor hypoglycemia.\r"

  ".W": "We hypothesized that the alveolar structures may contain extracellular macromolecules with antioxidant properties to defend against oxidants. To evaluate this 51Cr-labeled human lung fibroblasts (HFL-1) and cat lung epithelial cells (AKD) were exposed to a H2O2-generating system and alveolar epithelial lining fluid (ELF) from healthy nonsmokers was tested for its ability to protect the lung cells from H2O2-mediated injury. The ELF provided marked antioxidant protection, with most from a H2O-soluble fraction in the 100-300-kD range. Plasma proteins with anti-H2O2 properties were in insufficient concentrations to provide the antioxidant protection observed. However, catalase, a normal intracellular antioxidant, was present in sufficient concentration to account for most of the observed anti-H2O2 properties of ELF. Depletion of ELF with an anticatalase antibody abolished the anti-H2O2 macromolecular defenses of ELF. Since catalase is not normally released by cells, a likely explanation for its presence in high concentrations in normal ELF is that it is released by lung inflammatory and parenchymal cells onto the epithelial surface of the lower respiratory tract during their normal turnover and collects there due to the slow turnover of ELF. It is likely that catalase in the ELF of normal individuals plays a role in protecting lung parenchymal cells against oxidants present in the extracellular milieu.\r"

  ".U": "90369018\r", 
  ".W": "Interleukin 1 (IL-1) may be a key mediator of inflammation and tissue damage in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). In rabbits with immune complex-induced colitis, IL-1 alpha and beta mRNA levels were detectable at 4 h, peaked at 12 but were absent at 96 h after the induction of colitis. Colonic IL-1 tissue levels were measured by specific radioimmunoassays. IL-1 alpha was significantly elevated at 4 h (9.4 +/- 1.5 ng/g colon), progressively increased at 48 h (31 +/- 5.8 ng/g) and then decreased by 96 h (11.5 +/- 3.4 ng/g). IL-1 beta levels were 2.0 +/- 0.5 ng/g colon at 4 h, 5.0 +/- 1.6 ng/g at 48 h and undetectable by 96 h. By comparison, colonic levels of PGE2 and LTB4 were unchanged during the first 12 h and did not become elevated until 24 h. IL-1 alpha levels were highly correlated with inflammation (r = 0.885, P less than 0.0001), edema (r = 0.789, P less than 0.0001) and necrosis (r = 0.752, P less than 0.0005). Treatment with a specific IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1 ra) before and during the first 33 h after the administration of immune complexes markedly reduced inflammatory cell infiltration index (from 3.2 +/- 0.4 to 1.4 +/- 0.3, P less than 0.02), edema (from 2.2 +/- 0.4 to 0.6 +/- 0.3, P less than 0.01) and necrosis (from 43 +/- 10% to 6.6 +/- 3.2%, P less than 0.03) compared to vehicle-matched colitis animals. These studies demonstrate that (a) IL-1 gene expression and synthesis occur early in the course of immune complex-induced colitis; (b) are significantly elevated for 12 h before the appearance of PGE2 and LTB4; (c) tissue levels of IL-1 correlate with the degree of tissue inflammation and; (d) specific blockade of IL-1 receptors reduces the inflammatory responses associated with experimental colitis.\r"

The locus responsible for FHC in members of one large kindred was recently mapped to chromosome 14q11-12 (FHC-1). We have characterized three additional unrelated families in which the gene for FHC segregates as an autosomal dominant trait to determine if these disease loci also map to FHC-1. All family members were clinically studied by physical examination, electrocardiogram, and two-dimensional echocardiography. Genetic studies were performed using DNA probes which are derived from loci that are closely linked to FHC-1. In one family the genetic defect maps to the previously identified FHC-1 locus. However, the loci responsible for FHC in two other families were not linked to FHC-1. We conclude that FHC can be caused by defects in at least two loci and is a genetically heterogeneous disorder.\r"

Although individual lesions spontaneously regressed, prompt recurrence was observed after excision. Biopsy specimens taken from early proliferative, fully developed, and regressing stages revealed keratoacanthoma. Involucrin was demonstrated in the lesions during development and resolution. The early stage showed homogeneous staining of moderate intensity in the tumor cells at the suprabasal layers, and the staining became slightly irregular and intense when the lesions were fully developed. During resolution the intensity was markedly diminished. These results suggest that preterminal squamous differentiation accelerated during development of the tumors.\r"

Groups \"C+ alpha ox\" and \"R+ alpha ox\" received C or R diets supplemented with an antioxidant mixture (2-mercaptoethylamine plus ethoxyquin). R mice (mean life span 41 months) significantly outlived the other three groups (mean life span 30-34 months). Hepatic degeneration and increased hepatoma in the R+ alpha ox group suggested unusual hepatotoxicity of this regimen. Antioxidants had little effect on splenic cell mitogen response in similarly fed mice sacrificed at 12-15 months. Gompertz analysis suggests that the beneficial effect of DR may be due to reductions in initial vulnerability or rate-of-aging parameters, or both, and that the relative influence of each factor may vary with animal strain and DR protocol used.\r"

Analysis of body weights among these respective control and experimental groups from the first year of the study indicated that the monkeys undergoing dietary restriction were gaining weight at a markedly slower rate compared to control values. Actual food intake among diet-restricted groups had been reduced 22-24% below control levels. Periodic analysis of hematology and blood chemistry measurements over the first year of the study detected few significant differences between control and experimental groups to indicate that diet restriction was not detrimental to general health. When values obtained from hematology and blood chemistry measurements of juvenile and adult groups (control and experimental groups combined) were compared to ad libitum fed old monkeys from each species (greater than 18 yr for rhesus; greater than 10 yr for squirrel monkeys), many significant age differences were noted. Among the largest and most consistent findings in both species were age-related decreases in concentrations of lymphocytes, serum glutamic oxalacetic transaminase, serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase, alkaline phosphatase, and phosphates as well as the albumin/globulin ratio and the blood urea nitrogen/creatinine ratio. Age-related increases in serum globulin and creatinine concentrations were also found. These parameters as well as many others being implemented in the study will be monitored further to determine if diet restriction affects the rate of development as well as aging as observed in numerous rodent studies applying such nutritional manipulations.\r"

Four groups of male Lobund-Wistar rats were examined at 6 months, 18 months, and 30 months of age. Conventional-free-fed rats were housed in routine laboratory cages and fed ad libitum. Conventional-restricted diet rats were fed 12 grams a day, which becomes restrictive at 8 weeks of age. Germ-free rats were maintained using gnotobiotic procedures and were free of pathogens. The germ-free rats were maintained on either the full-fed or restricted diet regimens. Serum bone Gla protein and matrix concentrations of calcium, magnesium, and hydroxyproline (reflecting collagen content) and bone Gla protein were not significantly different between the four treatment groups. All of these parameters except hydroxyproline, however, showed age-related declines in all four treatment groups. We conclude that prolongation of rat life span by dietary restriction and/or a germ-free environment did not alter the measured parameters in each age group, and did not alter or slow the age-related changes in the bone matrix.\r"

Glucose regulation, inhibitory avoidance, and daytime sleep were assessed in young (3-month-old) and old (24-month-old) rats. Correlations were obtained between glucose regulation and the other variables in individual rats. In old rats, the magnitude of increases in blood glucose levels after glucose injections (500 mg/kg) was inversely correlated with retention of inhibitory avoidance and duration of paradoxical sleep bouts. In young rats, these measures were not significantly correlated. Because the deficits in sleep and memory in aged rats were largely confined to those rats with poor glucose control, peripheral glucose regulation may be a useful biological marker that accompanies cognitive and neurobiological dysfunction during aging.\r"

Age, prefracture physical function, and cognitive status were predictors of recovery. Controlling for these factors, persons consistently reporting few depressive symptoms were three times more likely than those with persistently elevated CES-D scores to achieve independence in walking, nine times more likely to return to prefracture levels in at least five of seven physical function measures, and nine times more likely to be in the highest quartile of overall physical function. These findings emphasize the importance of persistently elevated depressive symptoms for recovery. Routine screening, evaluation, and treatment of depression or depressed mood may be beneficial to the recovering hip fracture patient.\r"

In addition to significant differences on selection variables (e.g., AHI, frequency of hypertension, Multiple Sleep Latency Test), GSAS patients had significantly more sleep disturbance, were sleepier on subjective measures, were more depressed, and had lower scores on tests of nonverbal problem solving and nonverbal memory. Thus, GSAS resembles SAS described in middle-aged populations.

In each CT image, total cross-sectional area (CSA), bone CSA, muscle compartment CSA, and \"pure\" muscle CSA within the compartment were measured. Corresponding volumes were also calculated. Total limb and muscle plus bone CSA and volumes were estimated from AP measures. The two methods were compared, and multiple regression analyses were used to predict component CSA and volumes from AP measures. In both groups, AP component measures in the leg provided more accurate values than in the arm. Skin plus subcutaneous tissue in the old was not well estimated by AP. The greater preponderance of nonmuscle tissue in the muscle compartments of the old, as determined from CT images, was not related to any AP estimates. Prediction equations for various component areas and volumes were derived. Some equations derived for the young could not be obtained for the old due to the reduced ability of AP to accurately assess limb composition of aged men.\r"

Overall, the literature indicates increases in self-report psychiatric symptomatology and increases in psychiatric illness among most caregivers when compared to population norms or appropriate control groups. However, there is little information on the population prevalence or incidence of clinically significant psychiatric conditions attributable to caregiving. Studies of physical health effects as assessed by self-report, health care utilization, and immune function are less conclusive but, nevertheless, suggest increased vulnerability to physical illness among caregivers. We conclude with a discussion of why morbidity effects are difficult to obtain in caregiver studies and with recommendations for future research.\r"

Nonparticipants provided care for more impaired patients. No demographic differences were found between groups in either study, and there were no differences in the chronicity of caregiving. The implications of these data for aging research are discussed.\r"

Previous research has shown that young and old adults do not differ in their ability to recognize complex scenes. Other studies, however, using simple line drawings, do find age differences. This experiment investigated the possibility that the failure to find age differences with memory for complex pictures occurs because of memory support provided at encoding and retrieval by both the degree of visual detail (complex perceptual information) and the degree of propositional content (linguistic meaningfulness) that are represented in complex scenes. Pictures were shown to young and old subjects that differed in visual detail (complex vs simple) and propositional content (concrete vs abstract). The results indicated that age differences in picture memory emerge if the pictures are either deprived of visual detail or reduced in propositional content.\r"

The Multiphasic Environmental Assessment Procedure (MEAP) was used to assess social climate dimensions and their determinants in a national sample of 244 facilities. Residents saw more interpersonal support and self-direction in facilities with more physical resources (comfort and staff facilities) and policies providing more autonomy. A similar pattern was found for staff's perceptions of self-direction. Residents and staff also viewed facilities as providing more interpersonal support and self-direction when residents were more socially competent. Larger facility size was associated with residents' assessments of more conflict, and a higher staff-resident ratio was related to residents' judgments of having less independence and influence. These findings may help to improve residential facilities by suggesting factors that can be targeted in interventions to improve the social climate.\r"

Cross-sectional data on 1,379 elderly, noninstitutionalized, male Japanese American survivors of a population-based cohort study indicated the most common health problems were hypertension (43%), arthritis (33%), diabetes (13%), and gout (9%). For cancer and hypertension there is a trend toward higher prevalence in older age groups. For coronary heart disease, stroke, and angina the oldest age group (75-81 years) has a higher prevalence than that seen in younger age groups. Other relatively common diseases such as diabetes, gout, peptic ulcer, and arthritis do not have higher prevalence in older age groups. Drugs reported to be used frequently by study participants were for hypertension, gout, CHD, and diabetes. The prevalence rates of major limitations of mobility and of living alone appear to be relatively low in this population. Less than one percent of the current population rate their health status as poor. The prevalence of normal serum cholesterol and smoking are similar to those seen in U.S. White males, while the rates of hypertension appear lower. Prevalence rates for stroke and heart attack also appear to be somewhat lower in these long-lived individuals than those seen in U.S. Whites.\r"

First, because of population growth, migration from abroad was expected to be heavy, and about half came from abroad. Second, because of the pattern of Hispanic population concentration and the different settlement patterns of the four subgroups, a relatively small migration system with distinct subsystems for the four nationality groups was expected and found. Florida is the major ethnomagnet. Third, traditional family values, as reflected in dependent living arrangements, were expected to be more prevalent among migrants from abroad, and they were. Finally, returning to one's state of birth was highest among Mexican interstate migrants, as expected.\r"

Neither method offers support for the group benefit orientation. Both methods indicate that more recent cohorts show the highest levels of support for older workers' privileges and opportunities, reflecting social change in the direction of increasing tolerance of and support for the rights of older people. A period effect of increasing support for older workers was also observed on two of the indicators. The findings have implications for both the substantive issues raised and the analysis of cohort data.\r"

Both PMNLs and lymphocytes decreased platelet aggregation in a concentration-dependent fashion. PMNL-induced, but not lymphocyte-induced, inhibition of platelet aggregation was more pronounced as the incubation time of PRP with PMNLs was prolonged. The platelet-inhibitory effect of PMNLs was enhanced by superoxide dismutase (SOD) and was attenuated by oxyhemoglobin and methylene blue. These agents, in contrast, had no effect on lymphocyte-mediated inhibition of platelet aggregation. Adenosine deaminase did not modulate the platelet inhibitory effects of either PMNLs or lymphocytes. The incubation of PMNLs with PRP was associated with an increase in cyclic guanine 5' monophosphate (cGMP) levels in PRP. Incubation of lymphocytes, however, did not result in an increase in cGMP levels in PRP. Neither PMNLs nor lymphocytes in PRP caused a reduction in thromboxane B2 (TXB2) or an increase in 6-keto-PGF1 alpha. Thus this study shows potent inhibitory effects of isolated PMNLs mediated by a substance with biologic characteristics of nitric oxide. However, the mechanism of lymphocyte-induced inhibition of platelets appears to be independent of prostaglandins, nitric oxide, or adenosine.\r"

Serum amyloid A inhibited thrombin-induced gel-filtered platelet aggregation. However, it did not inhibit aggregation induced by collagen or adenosine diphosphate, nor did it influence the aggregation of platelet-rich plasma activated with thrombin. Further studies of its effect on thrombin-induced activities showed that serum amyloid A, at concentrations of 25 to 100 micrograms/ml (which are found in mild acute events), suppressed the increase of cytosolic [Ca2+], thromboxane generation, and carbon 14-labeled serotonin release in a dose-dependent fashion. Serum amyloid A did not interfere with the clotting or amidolytic activities of thrombin. Therefore, the data suggest a protective role for serum amyloid A in thromboembolic disease by specific interaction with thrombin-induced platelet activation. Amyloid A protein also markedly inhibited thrombin-induced platelet aggregation. Because amyloid A is homologous to the N-terminal portion of serum amyloid A, the observed activity probably resides in that part of the molecule. This finding may be of importance in localization of the active site on serum amyloid A.\r"

This somatotrophic effect of insulin might be involved in blood abnormalities in diabetes mellitus. We therefore investigated whether growth hormone (GH) affects the morphology or filterability of circulating red blood cells (RBCs) in hypophysectomized rats. After hypophysectomy, rats became anemic with a decrease in hematocrit, hemoglobin concentration, RBC count, and reticulocytes. The RBC membrane area was enlarged, giving an increased area-to-volume ratio compared with the control RBCs. The calculated minimum cylindrical diameter (MCD) and resistance to initial folding of the RBC decreased after hypophysectomy, and was confirmed by an enhanced filtration of RBCs through 3 microns Nucleopore membranes. The number of filter clogging particles was also lower in hypophysectomized rats than in control rats. Substitution for 21 days with bovine GH (via subcutaneously implanted osmotic minipumps) normalized RBC morphology and filterability. After withdrawal of GH, all parameters returned toward the presubstitutional levels. Neither cortisone nor thyroxine had any measurable effect on RBC morphology or deformability, indicating that GH deficiency contributes to the abnormal RBC morphology and rheology seen after hypophysectomy.\r"

We administered this drug to 15 patients with advanced diabetic nephropathy at a daily dose of 600 mg for 4 to 6 weeks. All patients had been treated with conventional therapy including angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and their diseases had stabilized for at least 2 weeks before the camostat mesilate therapy. Urinary protein excretion decreased promptly from 4.8 +/- 0.6 to 2.9 +/- 0.4 gm/day (mean +/- SEM, p less than 0.01) and serum albumin level increased from 2.7 +/- 0.2 gm/dl to 2.9 +/- 0.2 gm/dl (mean +/- SEM, p less than 0.05) within 4 to 6 weeks. The amount of plasma fibrinogen significantly decreased from 419.7 +/- 42.3 mg/dl to 306.6 +/- 28.3 mg/dl (mean +/- SEM, p less than 0.01), and urinary total fibrinogen degradation product excretion over 24 hours also decreased from 26,118 +/- 9,696 to 18,072 +/- 7,107 micrograms/day (mean +/- SEM, p less than 0.05). The value for serum creatinine level did not change during this intervention. We suggest that camostat mesilate suppresses the hypercoagulable state originating from diabetes mellitus, and changes the permselectivity of the glomerular capillary wall. These effects of camostat mesilate may improve the prognosis of diabetic nephropathy.\r"

  ".W": "Rat glomerular cells were cultured in vitro to evaluate their collagen phenotype. The enriched epithelial cell population that grew out from glomeruli in the initial stages of culture primarily synthesized type IV collagen. By 14 days, mesangial cell proliferation occurred with a coordinate change in collagen phenotype, after which time these cells mainly synthesized type I collagen and lesser amounts of types III, IV, and V collagens. In addition to the standard collagens, mesangial cells synthesized and accumulated in their extracellular matrix a small molecular weight collagenous protein that accounted for 16.6% of the total radioactivity incorporated into extracellular matrix proteins. This short-chain collagen, with an approximate molecular mass of 70,000 (70 kd), appears to be a unique product of mesangial cells. Collagen biosynthesis by the mesangial cells was down-regulated by dexamethasone in a time- and dose-dependent manner. Treatment with 10(-6) mol/L dexamethasone reduced synthesis of type I and type IV collagens by about 37% and 24%, respectively. Steady-state levels of the corresponding procollagen messenger RNAs were diminished in dexamethasone-treated mesangial cells. This effect of glucocorticoid was found to be specific because dexamethasone did not affect biosynthesis and secretion of noncollagenous proteins.\r"

When added to the assay mix, as little as 0.5 mmol/L acetaldehyde competitively inhibited ALAD even in the presence of dithiothreitol, a sulfhydryl reagent. ALAD activity also fell when undiluted cytosol was incubated at 37 degrees with as little as 0.25 mmol/L acetaldehyde for 8 hours before enzyme assay. Inactivation of ALAD by acetaldehyde was prevented by the metabolic inhibitor NaF but not by the aldehyde dehydrogenase inhibitor cyanamide. Incubation of undiluted cytosol with 20 mmol/L ethanol also decreased ALAD activity, but addition of ethanol to the assay mix had no effect. Ethanol-mediated inactivation of ALAD was reduced by inhibition of alcohol dehydrogenase with 4-methylpyrazole, but ALAD activity was not decreased by incubation of undiluted cytosol with acetate or sorbitol or by addition of acetate to the assay mix. The aldehydic B6 vitamers, pyridoxal and pyridoxal phosphate, also inhibited ALAD activity when added to the assay mix. However, these vitamers increased ALAD activity and decreased acetaldehyde-mediated inactivation of ALAD when incubated for 8 hours with undiluted cytosol. We conclude that (1) acetaldehyde decreases ALAD activity both by competitive inhibition with substrate and by inactivation of enzyme protein and that (2) inactivation of ALAD by acetaldehyde may require nonoxidative metabolism of acetaldehyde. The net pharmacologic effect of B6 vitamers on ALAD activity and on inactivation of ALAD by acetaldehyde remains to be determined.\r"

Monophosphoryl lipid A is a nontoxic derivative of lipid A that protects against lethal endotoxemia. We examined the effects of Salmonella minnesota monophosphoryl lipid A on S. minnesota lipopolysaccharide-induced priming of neutrophil superoxide anion generation. Human neutrophils were preincubated with and without either lipopolysaccharide or monophosphoryl lipid A before stimulation with 10(-5) formyl-norleucyl-leucyl-phenylalanine. Neutrophil priming reached a plateau at a concentration of 100 ng/ml of lipopolysaccharide, where superoxide anion generation increased from 10.1 +/- 0.8 to 25.2 +/- 1.7 nmol superoxide anions/10(6) neutrophils/10 min (p less than 0.01). In contrast, monophosphoryl lipid A did not exhibit any priming activity. Monophosphoryl lipid A also exhibited a time-dependent inhibitory effect on lipopolysaccharide-induced priming of neutrophils, which was maximal when monophosphoryl lipid A was added 15 minutes before lipopolysaccharide. Preincubation with monophosphoryl lipid A induced a dose-dependent inhibition of neutrophil priming by 1000 ng/ml lipopolysaccharide. Neutrophil superoxide anion generation decreased by 47% from 19.0 +/- 0.6 to 10.0 +/- 0.7 nmol superoxide anions/10(6) neutrophils/10 min by 2000 ng/ml monophosphoryl lipid A (p less than 0.01). These data indicate that monophosphoryl lipid A does not enhance neutrophil superoxide generation in response to formyl-norleucyl-leucyl-phenylalanine. Monophosphoryl lipid A also inhibits lipopolysaccharide-induced priming in a dose-dependent manner that may reflect blocking of lipopolysaccharide by monophosphoryl lipid A at cellular binding sites.\r"

  ".U": "90369219\r", 
  ".W": "Multiple lines of evidence indicate that the erythrocyte complement receptor (E-CR) system, which is unique to the primate, may play an important role in the clearing of immune complexes (ICs) from the circulation. However, all previous investigations of IC/E-CR interactions in vivo have involved the study of small amounts of preformed or passively formed ICs interacting with E-CR that were numerically in vast excess. The present study was undertaken to assess IC/E-CR interactions under conditions in which large amounts of ICs were formed in the circulation, amounts that when sustained for several weeks by daily intravenous administration of antigen resulted in the development of active glomerulonephritis. Twelve cynomolgus monkeys with E-CR levels ranging from 25 to 5000 mean CRs per erythrocyte (CR/E) were actively immunized to BGG, and 6 to 12 weeks later they were studied first at low levels of IC formation in vivo (L-Protocol experiments, mean 125I-labeled BGG dose of 0.04 mg/kg given over 1 minute, a marked antibody excess state) and then at high levels of IC formation in vivo (H-Protocol experiments, mean 125I-labeled BGG dose 4.9 mg/kg given over 10 minutes, a state approximating antigen-antibody equivalence). Cynomolgus monkeys with fewer than 100 CR/E showed no evidence of binding of ICs to erythrocytes with either low-dose or high-dose 125I-labeled BGG. However, cynomolgus monkeys with greater than 450 CR/E showed significant binding of ICs to erythrocytes: mean peak binding of 125I-labeled BGG to erythrocytes was 22.1% +/- 1.1% in the L-Protocol experiments and 33.4% +/- 8.0% in the H-Protocol experiments. During H-Protocol experiments, mean CR/E, measured by using a monoclonal anti-human CR1 antibody, decreased acutely (mean decrease 36.2% +/- 14.1%, p less than 0.05), with recovery of E-CR levels within the next 24 to 72 hours. The acute decrease in E-CR levels could not be accounted for by occupancy of E-CR by ICs or by change in hematocrit. In summary, the present study demonstrates that during the development of glomerulonephritis, IC/E-CR interactions occur and the E-CR system is altered by these interactions. The present observations are consistent with the hypothesis that the E-CR system may play a role in the pathogenesis of IC-mediated disease in the primate.\r"

Available information concerning the patients' presenting symptoms, age at diagnosis, clinical syndrome, tumour location, location of metastases, diagnostic radiology, biochemical and histopathological findings has been analysed. Our results indicate that most patients initially show rather vague and non-specific symptoms, with dyspepsia and pain being the most frequent presenting features. The median delay between appearance of the first symptom and diagnosis was 2 years; the delay was 35 months in sporadic cases and 14.5 months in familial cases. In spite of improvements in diagnostic methods, the median age at diagnosis (53 years) has not been reduced, and most patients are encountered when the tumour has reached an advanced stage. There is a need for a method of screening patients with still uncharacteristic abdominal symptoms for a neuroendocrine tumour. The presence of elevated levels of plasma chromogranin in all patients with a proven tumour suggests that such possibilities exist, and the use of this biochemical marker in the future might reduce the age at diagnosis and thus improve the likelihood of cure and survival of patients with endocrine pancreatic tumours.\r"

During a 5-year follow-up, 189 subjects quitted smoking, 312 changed to filter cigarettes, while 1524 continued to smoke plain cigarettes. Multiple logistic regression was used to adjust for age, duration of smoking, number of cigarettes smoked, socio-economic status and alcohol consumption. Smokers with morning phlegm at enrollment, who changed to filter cigarettes during the follow-up, had a probability ratio of 1.9 of phlegm production ceasing, compared with smokers who continued to smoke plain cigarettes (P less than 0.05). However, the probability ratio of developing morning phlegm among smokers who changed to filter cigarettes compared to those who continued to smoke plain cigarettes was 1.6 (P less than 0.05). The overall prevalence of morning phlegm at the end of the follow-up was the same in smokers who changed to filter cigarettes as in persistent plain cigarette smokers. The trends for chronic phlegm were similar, although they did not reach statistical significance. The smokers who stopped smoking had a probability ratio of 0.4 of developing morning phlegm (P less than 0.01) and a ratio of 7.7 for ceasing to produce it (P less than 0.001) compared to the smokers who continued to smoke plain cigarettes. Our results suggest that changing from plain to filter cigarettes is associated with a higher frequency of cessation of phlegm production, but offers no protection against the development of phlegm.\r"

The mean duration of diabetes was 25.5 years. Thirty-one of the patients had used tobacco regularly for at least 5 years. For 28 patients it was possible to calculate the intake of tobacco as the daily mean and the total consumption (expressed as pack years). The time period (in years) between initiation of tobacco usage and onset of persistent proteinuria, as an early indicator of diabetic nephropathy, was shorter if the daily consumption of tobacco was higher (P less than 0.01) and the total consumption (pack years) in these patients was lower (P less than 0.05). There was an increased risk of early death (P less than 0.01) in patients who were currently smokers when they were uraemic (predialysis), on dialysis or had kidney grafts, compared to those who had never used tobacco or who were ex-smokers. In conclusion, it appears to be important for insulin-dependent diabetic patients to avoid tobacco usage and for current smokers to give up the habit in order to reduce the risk of diabetic nephropathy and early death.\r"

Intraerythrocyte Na and K concentrations were determined by flame photometry. The Na-influx and Na-efflux rate constant were calculated from uptake values for 22Na in vitro. In NMH the Na-influx and Na-efflux rate constant were significantly higher while intraerythrocyte Na and K levels did not differ from the controls. Patients with MH tended to have an elevated intraerythrocyte Na concentration, but an unchanged Na-influx and Na-efflux rate constant relative to controls. The increased rate of erythrocyte membrane transport of Na in treated NMH could be due to a stimulatory effect of antihypertensive treatment on cellular Na transport. Patients with treated MH do not show this effect, and in addition, tend to have an elevated intraerythrocyte Na concentration, which is compatible with the existence of a more pronounced abnormality of cellular ion transport in MH.\r"

The most common procedure was an oral direction to the nurse, who documented the order in the nurses' day-to-day work sheet. The DNR orders were signed by 28% of the physicians. A wide range of symbols and code words were used, and there was considerable disagreement regarding the meaning of a DNR order. Such orders were often associated with withdrawal and withholding of life-sustaining treatments other than cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Most physicians stated that they never discuss DNR order with the patients, and that only in a minority of DNR decisions do they involve family members. There was considerable conflict with regard to DNR ordering procedures not only between internists in different hospitals, but also within individual hospitals.\r"

The triglyceride and cholesterol levels of serum very low density (VLDL) and low density (LDL) lipoproteins decreased during treatment (P less than 0.001). Serum HDL and HDL2 cholesterol levels increased by 37% and 135%, respectively. These changes were positively correlated (r = 0.93; P less than 0.001). There was no significant change in mean serum HDL3 cholesterol concentration. A negative correlation existed between changes in HDL3 and HDL2 cholesterol levels (r = -0.54; P less than 0.001). Multiple stepwise linear regression analyses revealed that the initial HDL3 cholesterol predicted more than 30% of the increase in HDL2 cholesterol. Changes in the concentrations of HDL2 and HDL3 cholesterol after 6 weeks of drug treatment were not related to the type of HLP, neither were these effects of nicotinic acid correlated with changes in VLDL or LDL lipid levels. The concept has previously been proposed, on the basis of in vitro data, that HDL2 is formed from HDL3 particles in the blood. Our results suggest that, in man, this reaction is stimulated in vivo by prolonged nicotinic acid therapy.\r"

After MaxEPA treatment, there was a marked increase in long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids of the n-3 series in the plasma lipid esters and in the platelet phospholipids, while the n-6 fatty acid content decreased. The very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) triglyceride concentrations decreased significantly (by 22%) on MaxEPA treatment. However, these changes were not significantly different from those observed during the placebo period. The blood glucose concentration tended to increase during MaxEPA treatment, and to decrease during the placebo period, the changes under the two regimes being significantly different (P less than 0.01). In addition, the rate constant for glucose disappearance (k value) for the intravenous insulin-tolerance test, which reflected the peripheral insulin sensitivity, tended to decrease during MaxEPA treatment and increase during administration of the placebo, there being a significant difference (P less than 0.03) between the changes during the two treatments. The reason for the observed changes in blood glucose concentration and peripheral insulin sensitivity is still unclear.\r"

Patients with peritoneal (n = 14), pleural (n = 7), pericardial (n = 6) or burn bullae fluid (n = 6) were studied. High C3a and TCC concentrations were found in all these fluids. Elevated C3a and TCC concentrations in inflammatory fluids were found not only in patients with elevated plasma C3a and TCC concentrations, but also in patients with normal plasma levels. No increases in C5a concentration were observed in pleural or burn bullae fluid. In one patient with pericarditis, and in subjects with acute pancreatitis with ascites, high C5a levels were found in the fluid. However, the high TCC concentration in the fluids suggests that C5a had been formed but was probably removed by leucocytes present in the fluid.\r"

Catecholamine excretion was found to be significantly correlated with urine cortisol concentration (r = 0.54, P less than 0.05) and limb paresis (r = 0.52, P less than 0.05). In a multiple regression analysis, urine cortisol values were shown to be positively associated with limb paresis (P = 0.003), disorientation (P = 0.03) and body temperature (P = 0.03). High cortisol excretion was associated with a poorer functional outcome in a discriminant analysis (P = 0.001). Thus acute ischaemic stroke is associated with an increased activity in the cortisol axis. This may have a number of negative effects on organ functioning, and is a predictor of a poorer functional outcome.\r"

All patients were investigated by phonocardiography, pulse curve recording, and M-mode echocardiography. Twenty-three of 30 (77%) patients had LV hypertrophy and/or diastolic impairment. Interventricular septum (P = 0.0001), LV posterior wall (P less than 0.05), and the wall thickness to cavity dimension ratio (P less than 0.001) were increased in patients compared to controls, as was LV mass index (P less than 0.002). Five patients had asymmetric septal hypertrophy. LV end-diastolic dimension did not differ between groups. LV distensibility was impaired, as judged from apexcardiographic a/H ratio (P less than 0.05) and from an increased left atrial index (P less than 0.005). LV early filling was impaired, with a reduced left atrial emptying index (P = 0.0001), and a reduced rate of dimension increase in digitized M-mode (P less than 0.02). We found no evidence of impaired LV relaxation. Blood pressure did not differ between patients and controls. With longer duration of the disease, left atrial dimension appeared to increase (r = 0.42, P less than 0.05), while other variables were not related to disease duration. The impaired LV filling was not secondary to systolic dysfunction. We conclude that systemic sclerosis patients have an increased LV wall thickness, with impaired early filling properties and LV distensibility.\r"

Inorganic calcium is increasingly promoted for its presumed, though unproven, effectiveness in prevention and treatment of osteoporosis. Massive overdose can be associated with serious risks, as illustrated by the present case, which we believe represents the highest serum calcium level yet reported in an ambulatory patient.\r"

Of these, 8.1% were adverse drug reactions and 2.7% were therapeutic failures due to ineffective dosage. In 8 cases (2.4%) the drug event could definitely have been avoided, and a further 13 cases (3.9%) were considered to have been potentially avoidable if appropriate measures had been taken by the health service. In 19 cases (53%) the referring physician was unaware of the drug-related problem. Those patients admitted because of a drug event were taking significantly more drugs than other individuals. The avoidable drug events pointed to the primary health care physicians as the appropriate targets for preventive measures in terms of intensified drug education. The study demonstrated that a reliable estimate of the DRH rate requires active data collection by a qualified health service worker in close collaboration with the patient's family doctor in cases of suspected DRH.\r"

  ".W": "To investigate whether leukotriene B4 is present in the arterial blood of asthmatic patients during wheezing attacks, 20 ml of arterial blood was drawn from the inguinal artery of five patients. Leukotriene B4 was detected in all five individuals, and its identity was confirmed by a combination of high pressure liquid chromatography and radioimmunoassay techniques. The concentration of leukotriene B4 was 48.34 +/- 16.27 pg ml-1 (mean value +/- SE). However, in five control subjects the leukotriene B4 concentration was found to be 9.43 +/- 5.44 pg ml-1. Thus there was a significant difference between the two groups (P less than 0.05). These results suggest that leukotriene B4 may be important in elucidation of the pathogenesis of bronchial asthma.\r"

The results suggest that, regardless of age of onset, the groups did not differ except on some features of coping style. Homogeneity, not heterogeneity, was the predominant finding. The results call into question the DSM-III-R procedure for classifying dysthymia by age of onset, but also point to the need for additional research.\r"

  ".U": "90369294\r", 
  ".W": "We assessed whether a relationship exists between posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and two quantitative aspects of war trauma: the duration of exposure to combat (expressed in months) and the intensity of combat (measured by ratings on the Laufer Combat Scale). These stressor characteristics were measured in relation to PTSD prevalence and persistence. Eighty-four veterans, inducted during the Vietnam War, who attended an orthopedic clinic participated in the study. A significant association was found between duration of combat exposure and prevalence and persistence of PTSD. The longest duration of combat exposure was found in patients who still suffered from PTSD. This duration was shorter for patients in remission and still shorter for patients who had never developed PTSD. Similarly, a significant association was found between combat scale ratings and PTSD. The highest rating was observed in subjects who still had PTSD. The rating was lower in patients in remission and still lower in those who had never experienced PTSD. Having been wounded, which is one of the Laufer Combat Scale items and could be considered particularly traumatic, was strongly associated with PTSD. The findings are discussed in relation to the reliability and validity of the PTSD construct and to the contribution of factors other than stressor characteristics to PTSD symptom expression.\r"

  ".U": "90369295\r", 
  ".W": "In the revision to DSM-III, generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is no longer considered only a residual category but can be diagnosed even when other axis I disorders are present. In this report, we present basic descriptive data on 22 patients meeting DSM-III-R criteria for GAD. Specific spheres of worry most commonly reported by patients with GAD are presented as well as data suggesting that these spheres of worry can be identified and judged as excessive or unrealistic in a reliable fashion. Nearly all GAD patients receive an additional diagnosis (comorbidity). Patterns of comorbidity indicate a high frequency of social phobia as an additional diagnosis in this sample. The present study suggests that, consistent with the new definition of GAD, a group of patients exist who worry excessively about two or more life circumstances and have the accompanying physiological symptoms with sufficient severity to satisfy the diagnostic criteria. Preliminary evidence suggests that this pattern of chronic intense worry about life circumstances discriminates GAD from other anxiety disorders.\r"
