  ".W": "The tumor-promoting phorbol ester 12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate (TPA) increases 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 (25OHD3)-24-hydroxylase and decreases 25OHD3-1-hydroxylase activity in cultured kidney cells, effects similar to those exerted by 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 [1,25-(OH)2D3] and opposite those of PTH, forskolin, and cAMP. In this paper it is shown that the effects of TPA and 1,25-(OH)2D3 are additive, suggesting that they operate through distinct mechanisms. TPA did not alter cAMP metabolism by cultured chick kidney cells, not did it alter their response, in terms of 25OHD3 metabolism, to cAMP, suggesting that these two regulators of 25OHD3 metabolism also operate through distinct pathways. Another presumed activator of protein kinase-C 1,oleoyl-2-acetyl-glycerol, was tested and found to have the same effect as TPA in decreasing 1-hydroxylase activity, but it does not increase 24-hydroxylase activity. In addition, 1-oleoyl-2-acetyl-glycerol increases intracellular cAMP levels to approximately 25% of those attained by stimulation with PTH. None of the treatments resulted in altered [3H]PDBu binding by the cells. The results, taken together, suggest that 25OHD3-1-hydroxylase and the 25OHD3-24-hydroxylase are subject to multifactorial regulation and can be regulated independently of one another.\r"

  ".W": "To document the presence of a low Km rT3 and T4-5'-monodeiodinase (5'MDL; Km in nanomolar concentrations) in the liver and to study its characteristics in comparison with the high Km 5'MD (5'MDH; Km in micromolar concentrations), we incubated rat liver microsomal protein (20 micrograms for rT3 substrate and 200 micrograms for T4 substrate) with 125I-labeled rT3 or T4 and dithiothreitol (DTT; up to 20 mM) for 5 min (for rT3) or 30-120 min (for T4) and determined the amount of 125I liberated during incubation. Pilot studies had shown that the activity of rT3 5'MDH is markedly (greater than or equal to 85%) inhibited in the presence of 2 M NaCl, while the rT3 5'MDL is essentially unaffected, and both low and high Km T4 5'MD are minimally (approximately 20%) inhibited. The representative kinetics of various substrates studied were: Km, 13 nM for rT3 5'MDL, 640 for rT3 5'MDH, 26 for T4 5'MDL, and 3620 for T4 5'MDH; maximum velocity, 0.28 nmol/h.mg protein for rT3 5'MDL, 46 for rT3 5'MDH, 0.002 for T4 5'MDL, and 0.46 for T4 5'MDH. Propylthiouracil and iopanoate inhibited all enzymic activities studied. The relative Ki values (micromolar concentrations) for propylthiouracil were: 7.1 for rT3 5'MDL, 1.5 for rT3 5'MDH, 24 for T4 5'MDL, and 40 for T4 5'MDH; those for iopanoate were 0.4 for rT3 5'MDL, 18 for rT3 5'MDH, 7.0 for T4 5'MDL, and 4.0 for T4 5'MDH. DTT was a potent stimulator of enzyme activities studied; its dose (millimolar concentrations) that caused a 50% maximal stimulation was 0.04 for rT3 5'MDL, 1.0 for rT3 5'MDH, 0.025 for T4 5'MDL, and 0.035 for T4 5'MDH. T4 inhibited rT3 5'-monodeiodination and vice versa. The Ki of T4 was 1.3 microM for rT3 5'MDL and 2.0 for rT3 5'MDH, while that of rT3 was 0.4 for T4 5'MDL and 0.6 for T4 5'MDH. We examined the activity of the hepatic 5'MDL (rT3, 0.5 nM; DTT, 0.06 nM; 2 M NaCl) and 5'MDH (rT3, 0.5 microM; DTT, 20 mM; no NaCl) in groups (six animals per group) of rats that were saline treated (control), thyroidectomized, or hyperthyroid (given T3, 20 micrograms/day for 5 days). The relative values for 5'MDL were (mean +/- SD) 17 +/- 3.0, 4.0 +/- 2.0 (P less than 0.01), and 24 +/- 2.0 (P less than 0.01) pmol/h.mg protein, respectively, whereas those for 5'MDH were 13 +/- 4.0, 3.0 +/- 1.6 (P less than 0.01), and 25 +/- 1.0 (P less than 0.01) nmol/h.mg protein, respectively.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The internalization of [125I]secretin in pancreatic acinar cells was evaluated by differentiation of surface-bound and internalized radioligand with an acidified glycine buffer. The amount of surface-bound radioligand was 2-fold higher at 37 C than at 4 C between 15 and 60 min; internalized radioactivity was more than 10-fold greater at 37 C than at 4 C during the same time period. The effects of chloroquine, dithiothreitol (DTT), carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenyl-hydrazone (CCCP), and dansylcadaverine on the binding and internalization of secretin were then evaluated. Chloroquine (0.1 mM), a lysosomotropic agent, did not affect secretin radioligand binding to its pancreatic receptor, while DTT, a sulfhydryl reducing agent, significantly lowered binding by more than 90% from 15-60 min. The metabolic inhibitor CCCP, however, significantly enhanced binding of the secretin radioligand in both the surface and the internalized pools. Surface binding was 1.6- to 3.3-fold greater from 15-60 min (P less than or equal to 0.01) in acinar cells exposed to CCCP than in untreated controls, while internalized radioactivity increased from 2.8- to 1.4-fold above the control value (P less than or equal to 0.01) at the same times. Dansylcadaverine, an inhibitor of receptor recycling, reduced internalized radioligand by 40% after 30 min of binding. The effects of these chemical agents on cAMP production were also considered. cAMP production was significantly reduced by DTT, CCCP, and dansylcadaverine at secretin concentrations of 0.1, 3.0, and 10 nM, respectively. This study demonstrates that 1) pancreatic acinar cells rapidly internalize [125I]secretin; 2) internalization of secretin does not enhance cAMP production; and 3) disulfide linkages are important for secretin receptor activity.\r"

  ".W": "The importance of the pituitary in postnatal regulation of peripheral preadipocyte proliferation and differentiation was examined by hormone supplementation of hypophysectomized pig serum in primary cultures of preadipocyte and stromal-vascular cells derived from rat inguinal adipose tissue. Hypophysectomized pig serum promoted at least 25% less preadipocyte proliferation, less differentiation of sn-glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase activity, and less histochemical differentiation than serum from intact pigs. Porcine GH supplementation of hypophysectomized serum-stimulated [3H]thymidine incorporation by preadipocytes and stromal cells and also histochemical differentiation of preadipocytes, but not enzymatic differentiation. Insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) stimulated [3H]thymidine incorporation by preadipocytes and stromal cells. Enzyme differentiation by developing cells was stimulated by IGF-I. Hydrocortisone supplementation of hypophysectomized serum inhibited [3H]thymidine incorporation and stimulated enzymatic differentiation. Thyroid hormones (T3 and T4) stimulated [3H]thymidine incorporation by preadipocytes in a dose-responsive manner when supplemented to hypophysectomized serum. Thyroid hormones stimulated differentiation of enzyme activity at the lowest concentrations examined. The mitogenic effects of GH, IGF-I, and T4 were not specific to the preadipocyte population, since the stromal-vascular cells responded in a similar manner. However, hypophysectomy resulted in a specific reduction in preadipocyte proliferation while stimulating multiplication of stromal-vascular cells. These results suggest that these hormones are nonspecific mitogens in adipose tissue, while unidentified factors of pituitary origin may be important for the specific regulation of proliferation of preadipocytes. Additionally, hypophysectomy appears to remove mitogenic inhibitors that are specific for the stromal-vascular cells.\r"

  ".W": "To study the effects of altered thyroid status on pretranslational control of pituitary hormones, adult male rats were given propylthiouracil for 6 weeks and underwent the following studies. 1) Rats were injected with T3 at 10 micrograms/100 g BW daily for 10 days. 2) Rats were given T3 injections at 0, 0.01, 0.1, 1.0, or 10 micrograms/100 g BW for 10 days. 3) Rats were killed 0, 1, 6, or 24 h after a single injection of T3 at 10 micrograms/100 g BW or after 5 or 10 days of daily T3 injections. Pituitary mRNA concentrations of TSH beta, alpha-subunit, PRL, GH, POMC, FSH beta, and LH beta were determined for individual animals. Marked increases in TSH beta and alpha-subunit mRNAs occurred after PTU treatment, and these changes were reversed by 1.0 microgram/100 g BW T3 and within 24 h of a single T3 injection of 10 micrograms/100 g BW. Further increases in the dose or time course of T3 administration led to a relatively greater suppression of TSH beta mRNA levels than alpha-subunit mRNA levels. In contrast, GH and PRL mRNA levels were low in hypothyroid animals, and both rose toward control levels with 0.1 microgram/100 g BW T3 and by 24 h after a single T3 dose. Induction of hyperthyroidism did not further increase GH mRNA levels above control, but increased PRL mRNA levels 2-fold over control. No changes were seen in FSH beta, LH beta, or POMC mRNA levels with any treatment. Thus, studies of altered thyroid status in the rat reveal dose-response and time-course variability in the pretranslational control of TSH beta, alpha-subunit, GH, and PRL by thyroid hormone.\r"

PP12 displayed a 5- to 10-fold higher affinity for IGF-I compared to hIGF-II or rIGF-II. These differences in binding affinity were confirmed by both saturation binding analysis and competitive binding analysis using 125I-labeled IGF-I, hIGF-II, and rIGF-II and each of the unlabeled ligands. PP12 produced dose-dependent inhibition of IGF-I-stimulated [3H]thymidine incorporation in the rat thyroid follicular cell line FRTL5. Inhibition of IGF-I-stimulated thymidine incorporation paralleled the ability of PP12 to inhibit IGF-I binding to the surface of FRTL5. At a high concentration, PP12 also inhibited TSH-stimulated DNA synthesis but did not inhibit the binding of 125I-labeled TSH to FRTL5. Insulin did not inhibit the binding of 125I-labeled IGFs to PP12, and PP12 did not inhibit the ability of insulin to stimulate DNA synthesis. These data suggest that the ability of PP12 to inhibit TSH-stimulated DNA synthesis is through the inactivation of IGF produced endogenously by FRTL5. Low concentrations of PP12 produced a statistically significant enhancement of TSH-stimulated DNA synthesis; the mechanism by which this occurs remains unclear.\r"

  ".W": "The major secretory product of the baboon and human decidua during pregnancy is an insulin-like growth factor-binding protein (IGF-BP). This study was designed to determine the site and regulation of synthesis of this protein in the nonpregnant baboon based on our previous findings that this molecule is biochemically and immunologically similar in the two species during pregnancy. Endometrial tissue was obtained from cycling baboons and steroid-treated ovariectomized animals. Portions of the tissue were fixed for immunocytochemical analysis, cultured in the presence or absence of cyclohexamide and actinomycin-D, or snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen for RNA isolation. Immunostaining using monoclonal antibodies to IGF-BP indicated that the protein was localized predominantly in the epithelium of the deep glands and was most intense during the late luteal stage of the cycle. Immunoreactive product was also present in tissue from estrogen-primed progesterone-treated ovariectomized animals. However, the staining pattern was more variable and less intense than that in intact animals. Western blots of explant culture media showed the presence of an immunoreactive product only in those tissues that also demonstrated immunocytochemical localization. The absence of an immunoreactive band in medium obtained from tissue incubated in the presence of cyclohexamide suggested that this protein was synthesized de novo. The mRNA coding for IGF-BP appeared to be stable, as synthesis in explant cultures continued in the presence of actinomycin-D. The cDNA probe hybridized to a single message transcript of 1.65 kilobases. The presence of mRNA in tissues coding for this protein correlates with the immunochemical data relating to the site and hormonal regulation of its synthesis. The presence of this protein in the glandular epithelium of the baboon endometrium may have implications in the autocrine and/or paracrine regulation of trophoblast growth and penetration during implantation.\r"

  ".W": "Previous studies have shown that tumor necrosis factor (TNF) administration acutely increases serum triglyceride levels and stimulates hepatic de novo fatty acid synthesis. We now demonstrate that 60-90 min after TNF administration the incorporation of glycerol into triglycerides in the liver is increased 57% in chow-fed rats. Additionally, the quantity of labeled lipid in serum is increased 96% in the TNF-treated animals. TNF also acutely increases hepatic lipid synthesis and the quantity of labeled lipids in serum in rats fed a high sucrose diet. Moreover, using the Triton WR-1339 method, from 1-2 h after TNF administration there is a 52% increase in total hepatic triglyceride secretion. In contrast, in animals fasted before TNF administration, the characteristic increase in serum triglyceride levels is not observed, and neither the incorporation of glycerol into hepatic lipids nor the quantity of labeled lipids in the circulation are increased. By 17 h after TNF administration the incorporation of glycerol into hepatic lipid and the quantity of labeled lipid in the serum are no longer increased. These results indicate that in addition to TNF acutely stimulating de novo fatty acid synthesis, TNF also acutely stimulates hepatic triglyceride synthesis. The increase in hepatic triglyceride synthesis leads to increased secretion of lipids into the circulation. These observations provide strong support for our hypothesis that a TNF-induced stimulation of hepatic lipid synthesis and secretion contributes to the TNF-induced hyperlipidemia.\r"

  ".U": "89210516\r", 
  ".W": "The action of forskolin on bovine and rat fasciculata cells was examined in freshly prepared cells. Bovine cells show a close parallelism between production of steroids and production of cAMP as a function of the concentration of ACTH up to 10(-8) M. By contrast, forskolin (10(-7)-10(-5) M) causes a similar increase in steroid synthesis but relatively little effect on the production of cAMP. cAMP-dependent protein kinase shows a similar response to ACTH but no response to forskolin in the same range of concentrations. ACTH and forskolin, at submaximal concentrations, cause greater steroid production when added together than when added separately, but the two agents at high concentrations produce the same response whether added together or separately. The inhibitors of voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels inhibit the steroidogenic response to forskolin (IC50 for nifedipine is 0.1 microM and for Py108-068 is 0.4 microM). A Ca2+ channel agonist (BAY K8644) increases the steroidogenic response of bovine adrenal cells to forskolin, but not that of ACTH. Finally, forskolin causes a concentration-dependent uptake of Ca2+ by these cells; in the concentration range of 0.1-10 microM, forskolin caused an increase in [Ca2+] from 185 nM to 345 nM. By contrast, forskolin caused some stimulation of the production of cAMP, but not that of steroids in rat fasciculata cells. It is concluded that in bovine fasciculata cells forskolin activates voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels with a consequent increase in steroid synthesis. This effect is independent of the well known action of forskolin on adenylate cyclase. Rat fasciculata cells, on the other hand, do not possess such Ca2+ channels and do not show a steroidogenic response to forskolin.\r"

  ".W": "These studies were undertaken to characterize 1) the immunoreactive somatostatin (SS) forms found in the gastrointestinal lumen and 2) to assess the possible role of luminal SS on pancreatic exocrine function. Results indicate that different forms of SS are secreted into the rat gastric and duodenal lumen in proportions corresponding to their gastric and duodenal contents. Inhibition of diversion-stimulated pancreatic exocrine secretion by intraduodenal infusion of SS (SS-ID) is dose dependent with a maximal effective dose of 24 micrograms/kg-1h-1 for volume and 48 micrograms/kg-1h-1 for protein output. Infusion of supramaximal doses result in a loss of the inhibitory effect of SS-ID on both volume and protein outputs. Comparison between inhibition of pancreatic secretion by iv SS (SS-IV) and SS-ID indicates that SS-ID is about 20 times less potent than SS-IV in its inhibition of stimulated pancreatic exocrine secretion. Intraileal (SS-IL) infusion of SS at 48 micrograms/kg-1h-1 did not inhibit stimulated pancreatic secretion but was rather stimulatory possibly through the inhibition of putative ileal inhibitors. Likewise, passive immunization against circulating SS did not affect the inhibitory effects of SS-ID on pancreatic secretion. These data indicate that SS is secreted into the rat gastrointestinal lumen and that its infusion into the duodenal lumen inhibits stimulated pancreatic secretion in a dose-dependent fashion. The observation that SS-IL did not inhibit pancreatic secretion and that passive immunization against circulating SS did not affect the inhibitory effect of SS-ID suggest that the action of SS-ID on stimulated exocrine pancreatic secretion is probably indirect and may involve a duodenal signal, possibly an inhibition of endogenous release of cholecystokinin and/or secretin.\r"

Serum T3, T4, and TSH concentrations were measured 7 and 14 days after surgery. Some groups of infused rats were mildly hypothyroid, as judged by elevated serum TSH concentrations. At both 7 and 14 days, there was a significant inverse correlation between serum T3 and serum TSH concentrations (day 7, r = 0.65, P less than 0.01; day 14, r = 0.71, P less than 0.01). The coefficients for the inverse correlations between serum T4 and TSH concentrations were 0.37 on day 7 (P less than 0.05) and 0.37 (P less than 0.05) on day 14. Linear regression analysis was performed using TSH as the dependent variable for outcome and serum T3 and T4 concentrations as the independent predictor variables. This analysis revealed that after controlling for T3, TSH and T4 were no longer significantly correlated (P = 0.14). The correlation between T3 and TSH remained highly significant. These results suggest that in the euthyroid and mildly hypothyroid rat, serum T3 has a greater inhibitory effect on TSH secretion than does serum T4.\r"

  ".W": "Prolonged exposure of many types of cells to drugs or hormones that inhibit the activity of the enzyme adenylate cyclase, such as narcotics and alpha 2-adrenergic agonists, leads to enhanced accumulation of cAMP upon removal of the inhibitory drug. We have found previously that chronic infusion of the adenosine A1 receptor agonist phenylisopropyladenosine (PIA), an inhibitor of adenylate cyclase, into rats leads to enhanced isoproterenol-stimulated cAMP accumulation in adipocytes isolated from these animals. The enhanced cAMP accumulation was associated with an impaired ability of PIA to inhibit lipolysis in these cells. In the present study we have investigated the mechanism of the enhanced cAMP accumulation in adipocytes from PIA-infused rats and the relationship of these changes to the impaired antilipolytic action of the drug. The enhanced isoproterenol-stimulated cAMP accumulation in adipocytes prepared from PIA-infused rats was due to both an increased rate of cAMP synthesis and a decreased rate of cAMP metabolism at high concentrations of cAMP without a change in phosphodiesterase activity. There was heterologous desensitization of the ability of PIA, prostaglandin E1, and nicotinic acid to inhibit cAMP accumulation in the adipocytes from PIA-infused rats; there was an increase in the EC50 of each of these agonists, although maximal inhibition of cAMP accumulation was similar. The relationship between the activation of cAMP-dependent kinase and extent of lipolysis was similar in the two groups of cells. We demonstrated that the explanation for the impaired ability of PIA to decrease the rate of isoproterenol (10(-7) M)-stimulated lipolysis in the cells from the PIA-infused rats was due to the markedly increased concentrations of cAMP in these cells, which led to sufficient activation of the kinase to maintain a high rate of lipolysis even in the presence of PIA. In addition, we found that the changes induced by the PIA infusion were largely reversible over a 2-day period after discontinuing the PIA infusion. These results demonstrate that adipocytes from PIA-infused rats provide an interesting model to investigate the mechanisms of tolerance to inhibitory drugs.\r"

At 37 C T3 uptake was linear with time up to 2 min, and then approached a plateau. The specific T3 uptake, obtained by subtracting the uptake in the presence of excess unlabeled T3, represented 48 +/- 6% of the total at equilibrium. Unlabeled L-T4, D-T3, and triiodothyroacetic acid were less effective than L-T3 in reducing [125I]T3 uptake. Kinetic studies on the initial rate of T3 uptake indicated, for the saturable process, a maximum velocity of approximately 1 pmol/10(6) cells.min and a Km of approximately 0.8 nM. Lowering incubation temperature to 4 C resulted in a two thirds reduction of the total T3 uptake. Washout experiments indicated a different hormone release, being more rapid for cells incubated at 4 C than at 37 C; at 30 min 70% of labeled T3 was released when incubation was carried out at 4 C compared to only 35% after incubation at 37 C, indicating the major intracellular location of the hormone at the latter temperature. An energy requirement of T3 uptake in thymocytes was shown by sensitivity to oligomycin; the effect was dose dependent, showing a maximal decrease in specific uptake of 85%. The involvement of cation movement in the entry process of T3 was indicated by the sensitivity to ouabain. These results indicate the existence of a stereospecific, energy-dependent, saturable process for T3 entry in thymocytes.\r"

After injection of dopamine, norepinephrine, bombesin, beta-endorphin, somatostatin, or prostaglandin F2 alpha, the level of hepatic venous plasma glucose did not differ from that in saline-treated control rats. However, neostigmine, an inhibitor of acetylcholine esterase, caused a dose-dependent increase in the hepatic venous plasma glucose concentration. This neostigmine-induced hyperglycemia was dose-dependently suppressed by coadministration of atropine, but not by hexamethonium. Injection of neostigmine (5 X 10(-8) mol) resulted in an increase not only in glucose but also in glucagon, epinephrine, and norepinephrine in hepatic venous plasma. In bilateral adrenalectomized rats, neostigmine-induced hyperglycemia was suppressed, but the hepatic venous plasma glucose concentration still increased significantly. These results indicate that the hippocampus is involved in central nervous system-mediated glucoregulation through cholinergic muscarinic activation, partly via epinephrine secretion.\r"

Biological activities present in CAC-8 were separated by reverse phase or cation exchange HPLC. TGF alpha in tumor extract was separated from TGF beta and ACSA by reverse phase HPLC. TGF alpha eluted between 26-30% acetonitrile and was identified by RIA. After the initial reverse phase separation, TGF beta and ACSA in tumor extract coeluted between 36-38% acetonitrile. Sequential cation exchange followed by reverse phase HPLC separated TGF beta from ACSA. Evaluation of fractions containing ACSA using an in vitro bone-resorbing assay demonstrated copurification of ACSA and bone-resorbing activity. The PTH receptor antagonist [Nle8,18,Tyr34]bovine PTH-(3-34)-amide, but not [Nle8,18,Tyr34]bovine PTH-(7-34)-amide, completely inhibited ACSA in column eluates. Conditioned cell culture medium from CAC-8 primary cultures contained predominantly latent TGF beta that could be activated by acidification. These findings indicate that the CAC-8 model of cancer-associated hypercalcemia produces a PTH-like factor, TGF alpha, and TGF beta that were separable by reverse phase or cation exchange HPLC. This feature should be useful to investigate the role of TGFs and PTH-like proteins in the pathogenesis of humoral hypercalcemia of malignancy.\r"

  ".W": "In addition to their capacity for steroid synthesis, guinea pig adrenal microsomes have a well documented ability to metabolize foreign compounds. The capacity for metabolism of foreign compounds is localized to the smooth endoplasmic reticulum-filled cells of the inner zone. However, it has not been clear whether they possess cytochrome P450(s) specific for this function, distinct from the two known steroid hydroxylases, P450(21) and P450(17)alpha. Multiple prominent protein bands in the mol wt range of known cytochrome P450s are seen on sodium dodecyl sulfate gels of guinea pig adrenal microsomes. Most are more intense in smooth microsomes, where the concentration of cytochrome P450 is highest. However, one band (52K) appears unique to the smooth microsomes. This band is also characteristic of microsomes obtained from the inner zone. This protein and two others (54K and 50K) are concentrated in the membrane pellet after carbonate treatment of the microsomes, indicating that they are integral membrane proteins. All three decrease in intensity after treatment of the animals with spironolactone, a compound known to cause depletion of adrenal cytochrome P450s. On Western blots of microsomal proteins the 54K and 50K proteins react with antibodies specific for P450(17) alpha and P450(21), respectively. The 52K protein, characteristic of the smooth microsomes and inner zone, does not react with anti-P450(21) or anti-P450(17) alpha, but does react with polyclonal antibody raised against microsomal cytochrome P450s induced by methylcholanthrene in rat liver (P450c,d). These results suggest that there is at least one additional cytochrome P450 in adrenal microsomes which is immunochemically distinct from P450(21) and P450(17) alpha. Its localization to the smooth microsomes and inner zone microsomes correlates with the high activity for ethylmorphine metabolism detected in these fractions. This suggests that this cytochrome P450, which is immunochemically related to members of the P450I subfamily, may be associated with the ability of guinea pig adrenal microsomes to metabolize foreign compounds.\r"

This is the first report of a sex-dependent cytochrome P450 in the adrenal. It is immunochemically related to the two members of the P450I family, P450 c and d, neither of which has been reported to be hormonally regulated. The correlation of this cytochrome P450 with the ability of the microsomes to metabolize ethylmorphine suggests that it accounts for this capacity. Whether metabolism of foreign compounds and/or male-specific steroid hydroxylation are its functions in vivo remains to be determined.\r"

Two mAbs (T1 and T6) were able to completely inhibit [125I]ovine PRL ([125I]oPRL) binding to solubilized rat liver PRL receptors, while two other mAbs (U5 and U6) showed only a small effect on PRL binding, but were able to precipitate hormone-receptor complexes. Scatchard analysis of [125I]oPRL binding to rat liver microsomes in the presence of mAbs resulted in a decrease in the number of sites without changing the affinity of PRL binding by T1 and T6, whereas U5 and U6 altered neither parameter. [125I]mAb binding to rat liver microsomes was performed in the presence of various concentrations of unlabeled mAbs or oPRL to examine the interaction between mAbs. Competition of binding to the receptor was observed, respectively, between T1 and T6, U5 and U6, and U5 and E21 (a mAb to the rat liver PRL receptor previously produced). Both [125I]T1 and [125I]T6 binding were inhibited by oPRL, although not completely (80% inhibition at the higher concentrations). When [125I]T1 binding was analyzed by Scatchard analysis, two classes of binding sites to rat liver microsomes were found, of which only the number of higher affinity sites was affected by the presence of oPRL in incubation. Similar results were observed for [125I]T6 binding. [125I]mAb binding to microsomes from other tissues and species was examined. All five mAbs were able to bind to microsomes from rat tissues (liver, ovary, adrenal, prostate, and Nb2 lymphoma cells), similar to the level of [125I]oPRL binding in these tissues. The binding characteristics of [125I]T6 or [125I]U5 were essentially identical in all rat tissues examined. Although T1, U6, and E21 showed strong species specificity, there was significant binding of T6 to rabbit liver and mammary gland and of U5 to rabbit and pig mammary gland and mouse liver Competition curves of [125I]U5 binding were parallel for rat, rabbit, and mouse tissues, while [125I]T6 binding was able to distinguish PRL receptors in rabbit mammary gland from those in rat tissues. The use of 125I-labeled mAb in immunoblot analysis of the PRL receptor resulted in a marked increase in sensitivity. All mAbs detected microsomal PRL receptors in rat liver with mol wt of 84,000, 42,000 and 40,000. As little as 4 fmol receptors can be identified using this approach. Microsomal PRL receptors from rat ovary, prostate, and Nb2 cells and purified receptors from pig and rabbit mammary gland were subjected to immunoblot analysis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

This animal has only about 5% of normal pituitary GH content, low circulating GH levels, and no regular GH surges. The defect seems to be specific for GH. Infusions of hIGF-I at 180 micrograms/day for 9 days elevated serum IGF-I concentrations significantly over those in the saline-infused controls (713 +/- 20 ng/ml vs. 395 +/- 31 ng/ml); hGH infusions did not raise IGF-I levels significantly (435 +/- 20 ng/ml). Gel filtration of serum samples showed that the high-dose hIGF-I infusions increased free IGF concentrations, without apparently altering the pattern of IGF-I binding whereas hGH infusions increased the amount of high mol wt IGF-I binding protein. Neither IGF-I nor hGH infusions affected the small amounts of rat GH present in the dwarf rat pituitary glands. Continuous iv infusions of hGH (200 mU/day for 9 days) stimulated body wt gain (2.1 +/- 0.2 g/day) and bone growth (96 +/- 9 microns/day) significantly compared to saline-infused dwarf rats (1.2 +/- 0.3 g/day and 43 +/- 3 microns/day). Infusions of hIGF-I at 180 micrograms/day produced a body wt gain (2.1 +/- 0.5 g/day) similar to that seen in the hGH-infused group but a significantly smaller stimulation of bone growth (63 +/- 3 microns/day). Infusion of a 5-fold lower dose of hIGF-I (36 micrograms/day for 9 days) had no effect on body wt or bone growth. Food intake was unaffected by either hGH or hIGF-I infusions. The pattern of tissue growth was affected differentially by hGH and IGF-I infusions that produced the same overall body wt gain. hGH induced a relatively proportional growth in most of the organs studied, whereas hIGF-I infusion at 180 micrograms/day stimulated a disproportionately greater growth of the kidney, adrenals, and spleen. In some of the animals, tissues were extracted for RIA of IGF-I; the amounts of IGF-I in the liver were similar in control, hGH, or IGF-I-infused animals, whereas kidney and adrenals from IGF-I infused animals contained larger amounts of immunoreactive IGF-I than did those tissues from hGH-treated rats. Thus, both hGH and hIGF-I can promote growth in the mutant dwarf rat, but they differ both quantitatively and qualitatively in their pattern of actions.\r"

The results showed that the plasma membrane was the major source of cholesterol substrate and that the cholesterol content changed independently of any mass changes in membrane protein or phospholipid. Membrane phospholipid composition also did not change as membrane cholesterol content decreased or increased, a finding inconsistent with the proposal that phospholipid composition dictates the amount of cholesterol contained in a membrane. The mitochondria of the MA-10 cells were cholesterol rich, containing more cholesterol per unit protein or phospholipid than the plasma membrane. This cholesterol was presumably in the outer mitochondrial membrane, since virtually all of the cholesterol of intact mitochondria was accessible to cholesterol oxidase. Although there was a high concentration of mitochondrial cholesterol, this cholesterol was largely inert as a substrate for steroidogenesis, and plasma membrane cholesterol was incorporated into steroid hormones without ever equilibrating with the mitochondrial cholesterol pool.\r"

A marked decrease in the percent free T3 was observed in these abnormal sera. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, pH 7.4, of normal dog serum enriched with tracer 125I-labeled thyroid hormones demonstrated binding of [125I]T4 to transthyretin, thyroid hormone-binding globulin, and albumin and of [125I]T3 primarily to thyroid hormone-binding globulin. In all abnormal sera, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis demonstrated strikingly higher binding of T3 to immunoglobulin (Ig). Eleven of 16 abnormal sera had minimal to moderate binding of T4 to Ig. The percent free T4 was lower only in dogs whose sera demonstrated markedly increased binding of T4 to Ig. All abnormal sera tested had positive antithyroglobulin antibodies, consistent with the diagnosis of autoimmune lymphocytic thyroiditis. As in humans, antibodies to thyroid hormones in dogs are more common in the presence of Hashimoto's thyroiditis and should be considered when elevated serum thyroid hormone concentrations are observed in the absence of clinical thyrotoxicosis. When an antibody to only one thyroid hormone is present, a marked discrepancy in the serum concentrations of T3 and T4 will be observed.\r"

To objectively define the nature and extent of statistical errors associated with the identification of episodic gonadotropin (LH) peaks, we have employed two complementary approaches. First, using a general biophysical model for simulating episodic LH secretion, we have estimated optimal pulse analysis parameters that yield maximal sensitivity (probability of finding any given peak) and positive accuracy (probability that any identified peak is a true pulse) in synthetic LH series approximating those observed spontaneously in vivo. Secondly, we have estimated optimal peak detection parameters in an in vivo primate animal model, in which electrophysiological correlates of spontaneous LH pulses were documented independently by continuous electrophysiological monitoring of medial basal hypothalamus multiunit activity. These combined approaches indicate that LH time series can be analyzed for episodic LH pulsatility by an appropriately constrained, objective computerized algorithm with minimal false negative and false positive errors, i.e. with resultant high sensitivity and positive accuracy. Moreover, optimal pulse analysis parameters exhibited similar sensitivity and positive accuracy rates in both the biophysical simulations and the animal model. Thus, we suggest that the combined use of an algebraically explicit biophysical simulation model and an in vivo animal paradigm may serve to clarify the nature and extent of false negative and false positive errors in the detection of other hormone peaks as well as the gonadotropin LH.\r"

After castration, treatment with 17 beta-estradiol (20 micrograms/kg.day) for 3 days induced the LF mRNA in the seminal vesicle of both control and prenatally DES-exposed mice; however, the levels in DES-treated tissues were approximately 6-fold higher than those in control tissue. This report describes the presence of LF in seminal vesicle tissues and secretions of prenatally DES-exposed mice, as determined by immunohistochemistry and Western blot analysis. Further, these data are correlated with immunolocalization of the estrogen receptor in the seminal vesicle tissue. We conclude that the seminal vesicle of prenatally DES-exposed male mice has acquired two key characteristics of female tissues, namely LF production/regulation and estrogen receptor localization/distribution similar to that in uterine tissues.\r"

  ".U": "89210543\r", 
  ".W": "The aim of this study was to determine the role of plasma clearance in the developmental increase in plasma corticosterone concentration in the infant rat. Previous studies indicated that the corticosterone rise may be mediated entirely by a decrease in the MCR. The rationale of the current study was that if this is true, then corticosterone from an exogenous source (at a constant dose) should also produce a developmental increase in circulating levels of the hormone. Therefore, infant rats, aged 12, 16, and 21 days (i.e. near the beginning, middle, and end of the endogenous corticosterone developmental rise), were adrenalectomized and provided with a constant dose of corticosterone via sc pellets. There was a significant age-related increase in plasma corticosterone in pellet-treated pups which closely paralleled that seen in sham-operated littermates. This indicates that the decrease in plasma clearance is sufficient to account entirely for the normal developmental rise in plasma corticosterone. The declining MCR for corticosterone with increasing age is due primarily to a decrease in the apparent volume of distribution (Vd), which, in turn, may result from the concurrent increase in plasma corticosteroid-binding globulin (CBG). To investigate this possibility, the Vd of dexamethasone, a synthetic glucocorticoid that does not bind to CBG, was determined and compared with that of corticosterone. While the Vd of corticosterone declined significantly with age, there was no consistent change in the Vd of dexamethasone. Taken together, these data indicate that the decrease in clearance of corticosterone from plasma with increasing age is sufficient to account for the normal developmental rise of corticosterone. Moreover, increased binding of corticosterone to CBG appears to be responsible for decreases in Vd and clearance.\r"

  ".W": "Previous studies showed that Y-1 cells in which the concentration of cholesterol in plasma membranes (expressed relative to phospholipid as a molar ratio, C/P) was raised by incubation with cholesterol produced more 20 alpha-dihydroprogesterone than cells with normal or low plasma membrane C/P values. This difference was not associated with any difference in the production of cAMP. The cells respond to (Bu)2cAMP in the order high greater than normal greater than low C/P. High C/P is associated with higher levels of cholesterol in the cytosol and higher concentrations of this steroid in the inner mitochondrial membrane. The rate of transport of cholesterol to the inner membrane differed in the three groups of cells: high greater than normal greater than low C/P. Production of pregnenolone by mitoplasts was no different in the three groups, and the same applies to the production of pregnenolone by mitochondria from cells incubated with and those incubated without (Bu)2cAMP. 25-Hydroxycholesterol increased the production of 20 alpha-dihydroprogesterone by cells showing normal or low C/P values, but not those with high values. It is concluded that the transport of cholesterol to the inner mitochondrial membrane is regulated by at least two processes, namely the supply of substrate (cholesterol), which can saturate this transport mechanism, and some mechanism(s) that is stimulated by cAMP and is capable of stimulating transport above maximal levels produced by high concentrations of cholesterol alone. The second mechanism requires the synthesis of a new protein(s).\r"

  ".U": "89210545\r", 
  ".W": "We recently reported that dexamethasone (DEX) enhances acetylcholine (ACh) release from pituitary cell aggregates. In the present study, the effect of DEX on the GH-releasing properties of the cholinergic agonist carbachol (CCh) was investigated. Perifusion of hemipituitaries from 14-day-old rats with CCh stimulated basal GH release. CCh also increased basal GH release from organ-cultured pituitaries and from pituitary cells cultured as reaggregates, but only when the thyroid hormone T3 was supplemented to the culture medium. Pretreatment of the animals in vivo with DEX abolished the CCh-induced increase in basal GH release from hemipituitaries tested in vitro. Treatment of pituitary organ cultures and reaggregate cell cultures with DEX reversed the stimulation of basal GH release by CCh into an inhibition. CCh also inhibited isoproterenol- and GRF-stimulated GH release from DEX-treated pituitary cell reaggregates. In contrast, the responsiveness of tumoral GH3 cell aggregates to CCh was not dependent on T3 or DEX during culture. The half-maximal concentration of CCh for inhibition was significantly lower than that for stimulation (1 and 10 microM, respectively). Perifusion with CCh of DEX-treated cell reaggregates consisting of a highly enriched somatotroph population (greater than 90% GH immunoreactive cells), obtained by sequential velocity and buoyant density sedimentation of dispersed cells, also inhibited basal GH release. Pretreatment of pituitary cell reaggregates cultured in DEX-supplemented medium with pertussis toxin completely abolished the inhibition by CCh. The inhibition of GH release by CCh was not affected by the Na+ conductance blocker tetrodotoxin, the Cl- channel blocker picrotoxin, or the K+ channel blocker caesium, but was abolished by the Ca2+ channel blockers cadmium and verapamil. In conclusion, CCh is capable of both stimulating and inhibiting GH release in different pituitary in vitro assay systems; the inhibition is dependent on glucocorticoids and the stimulation on the thyroid hormone T3. The mechanism of action of the inhibition seems to involve a GTP-binding protein and most probably a decrease in calcium conductance in the somatotroph.\r"

To our knowledge, this is the first report of stimulation of breast cancer growth by RU486.\r"

Six biotinylated lectins that bind to specific glycoconjugates of secretory or gestational endometrium in paraffin-embedded tissue were used. These lectins were wheat germ agglutinin (WGA), Ricinus communis agglutinin-I (RCA-I), Concanavalin A agglutinin (Con-A), peanut agglutinin (PNA), Dolichos biflorus agglutinin (DBA), and soybean agglutinin (SBA). On review, the histologic sections showed day 20 to 26 patterns. In retrospective analysis, 15 of the 16 cases had increased stromal edema and vascular congestion compared with endometria of equivalent postovulatory dates not associated with conception. In 2 cases, spiral arterioles showed increased thickness. There was no evidence of renewal or prominence of glandular secretions. Most lectin binding was similar to that of the secretory phase of the menstrual cycle (WGA, RCA-I, gland lumenal secretions and stromal granulocytes; Con-A, gland cell cytoplasm and predecidua). There was focal, irregular staining of gland secretions with PNA, DBA, and SBA, lectins that generally react only with gland secretions in later gestation. These results indicate that vascular changes including edema and congestion appear to be the earliest persistent morphologic manifestations of the pregnant endometrium. Secretory gland changes, however, are subtle and are not identifiable by routine histology.\r"

If amenorrhea was not obtained after 1 month of treatment, the gestrinone dose was increased to 2.5 mg three times a week (7 patients) and the danazol dose to 800 mg/day (2 patients). One month after the end of the treatment, a repeat laparoscopy was performed only in the women who agreed (7 of the gestrinone treated group, 9 of the danazol group). All of the patients were followed for at least 12 months after the end of the treatment, during which time they attempted to conceive. There was a marked improvement of pain symptoms during the treatment in the patients of both groups. The repeat laparoscopy did not reveal significant differences between the two groups in the reduction of the disease extent. Eighteen months after treatment suspension, the cumulative pregnancy rate was 33% in the patients treated with gestrinone and 40% in those treated with danazol. Pain symptoms recurred during the follow-up in 57% of the gestrinone and 53% of the danazol group. The side effects were more frequent and severe with the danazol treatment, whereas those caused by gestrinone were mostly weight gain and acne. The results of this study suggest that gestrinone is as effective as danazol in the treatment of infertility associated with endometriosis and is better tolerated.\r"

Groups A and B1 received intravascular volume expander, electrolytes replacement, and indomethacin up to 300 mg/day. The patients in group B2 had significant clinical and biochemical improvement after abdominal paracentesis. Urinary output and creatinine clearance improved significantly, and a decrease in hematocrit, blood osmolarity, and weight reduction were achieved. A strategy for treatment of OHSS based on consecutive ultrasonographic examination, clinical and biochemical evaluation, and abdominal paracentesis in severe OHSS with clinically significant ascites is suggested.\r"

In the 25 patients, the rapid increase in E2 proved to be combined with a significant increase in the left ventricular end diastolic dimension (LVEDD), the left ventricular end systolic dimension, the heart rate (HR), the systolic index, the cardiac index, and a significant reduction in the mean arterial pressure, in the systolic arterial pressure and in the systemic vascular resistence index. In the 14 pregnant patients in study III, all of the hemodynamic parameters studied proved to be significantly modified with respect to study I. In the 11 nonpregnant patients between Studies I and III were no significant cardiovascular modifications except for a significant increase in LVEDD in Study III. It is concluded that, during MFS, the rapid increase in E2 is combined with hemodynamic modifications and that, in pregnancy, the cardiovascular adaptation modifications occur in the very early stages.\r"

The 6-month trial included additional evaluations of ovarian function and serum NET values. In the 6-month trial, no indication of ovulation was detected in the 100-mg dose group, while 3 of the 19 women in the 65-mg group showed signs of ovulation (progesterone greater than 3 ng/ml). No pregnancies were reported in the 100-mg group and one pregnancy in the 65-mg group resulted in a life-table pregnancy rate for that dose of 2.6 per 100 woman-years (95% confidence interval, 0 to 7.5). Days of vaginal bleeding were analyzed for 30 days before treatment and in 90-day reference periods after treatment. The mean number of vaginal bleeding and spotting days increased initially after the first injection in both dose groups, but decreased to below baseline in both dose groups after 6 months. The two doses appear comparable in clinical safety, side effects, vaginal bleeding patterns, and laboratory measures. With the preliminary estimate of efficacy, the 65-mg dose would be the minimally effective dose for the NET 90-day injectable contraceptive.\r"

The pregnancy rate per GP cycle was 14.7%, compared with 5.4% per PP cycle (chi 1(2) = 12.7, P less than 0.001). The most important prognostic factors were female age, the pregnancy rate showing a linear decline after the age of 25, and previous failed fertilization due to abnormal sperm. The rate of pregnancy also declined after 14 or more follicles were aspirated and/or nine oocytes were retrieved. A formula for the probability of pregnancy, derived from the logistic regression, provides patients with a more accurate prognosis before treatment.\r"

  ".W": "The secretion of prolactin (PRL) after intravenous metoclopramide was evaluated in six prepubertal subjects with idiopathic isolated hypogonadotropic hypogonadism before and after repeated testosterone (T) injections. The PRL response to metoclopramide was markedly blunted before T treatment, but both the basal and metoclopramide-stimulated PRL secretion became normal after 4 to 15 months of intramuscular T enanthate, although in three of the subjects, serum T was low at the time of the repeat study. These results confirm that the pituitary lactotrophs are normal in this disorder and suggest that the attenuated response observed in the untreated patients is due to the chronic and persistent exposure of the lactotrophs to an environment low in T. The effect of exogenous T on the lactotrophs persists for several weeks after T is discontinued.\r"

Semen specimens from 28 men were incubated with either medium or FF. Incubations with FF have increased sperm penetration assay (SPA) scores from 24.8 +/- 17.3 to 34.3 +/- 13.6 (P less than 0.01). Incubation with heat-inactivized FF also has increased SPA scores, although to a lesser extent than noninactivized FF. Seventeen pregnancies occurred in the 31 couples treated by IUI (54.8%), 16 of them in FF-treated cycles (51.6%) and one in \"control\" IUI cycles (3.2%, P less than 0.01). All pregnancies occurred within four treatment cycles. Thus, IUI after sperm wash and preincubation with FF may be suggested for four to six cycles to couples with male factor and/or unexplained infertility who are reluctant to resort to artificial insemination by donor or adoption, before attempting the more costly and complex in vitro fertilization-embryo transfer procedure.\r"

These results demonstrate that a significant proportion of rhesus monkey oocytes can be maintained in meiotic arrest for 40 hours by treatment with HX and dbcAMP, and that this effect can be overcome by removal of inhibitors from the culture medium.\r"

When the antagonists were added to the ejaculate at a concentration of 10(-4) M 30 minutes before insemination of the females, a significant failure of fertilization was seen only with CV-3988, U66985, and SRI 63-441--all structural analogs of PAF. Antagonists that were not structural analogs were not effective. All compounds to a lesser or greater extent caused some qualitative agglutination and loss of sperm motility, but these effects were not correlated with inhibition of fertilization. SRI 63-441 was the most effective compound and was subjected to further study. When given intravenously prior to ovulation (5 mg/kg at 1, 5, and 9 hours after the ovulating injection), no effect on fertilization was seen. If SRI 63-441 (40 mg in 0.5 ml aqueous solution) was instilled into the vagina 2 minutes before insemination, a highly significant reduction in the fertilization rate was achieved. It is concluded that these compounds act by an action on the sperm membrane rather than by direct PAF antagonism on spermatozoa.\r"

This \"toxic\" effect of O2 is not seen at 5% O2 concentrations, suggesting that atmospheric O2 concentrations are toxic to preembryos. The present study examined the effect of short-term exposures to 20% O2, as may occur during in vitro fertilization procedures. The results demonstrated that when 1-cell preembryos were exposed to the atmospheric oxygen concentration for as little as 1 hour, their development was inhibited. Furthermore, such toxic effects did not become apparent until after four to five divisions. The authors conclude that it is critical to minimize exposure of zygotes to the atmospheric O2 concentration for optimal development to continue past the 8- to 16-cell stage, at least in the mouse.\r"

Of the 71 NCCP patients, 35 had a positive AP test (of whom 20 had an abnormal 24 hour pH) and 36 had a negative AP test (of whom 14 had an abnormal 24 hour pH study). Thus, the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) of the AP test in this group was 59%, 59%, 57%, and 61%, respectively. The corresponding values in the oesophagitis group were 85%, 67%, 94%, and 40%. In the NCCP group when heartburn alone was used as the positive criterion the PPV rose to 74%. When chest pain with or without heartburn was used, however, the PPV dropped to 38%. A 'symptom index' was used to define the number of chest pain episodes that were caused by acid reflux. Only 48% of AP test positive patients had demonstrable acid mediated chest pain. In the NCCP population with a normal oesophageal examination (1) AP test reproduction of chest pain is poorly predictive of GORD; (2) AP test reproduction of heartburn is more predictive of GORD but does not ensure that the chest pain is caused by GORD; (3) a negative AP test does not exclude GORD and (4) only 48% of AP test positive patients have demonstrable acid mediated chest pain. The ambulatory 24 hour pH test may have rendered the AP test obsolete in the assessment of GORD as the cause of NCCP.\r"

Prolonged administration of 1 mg tetragastrin/kg body weight in depot form starting one week after NaOH treatment resulted in a significant increase in gastric acid secretion and the incidence and number of villi with gastric epithelium in the duodenum in experimental week 10. Villi with gastric epithelium were found in five (23%) of 22 rats in control group, whereas abnormal villi were found in 13 (59%) of 22 rats in the tetragastrin treated group (p less than 0.05). The average number of villi with gastric epithelium rose from 0.6 (0.4) per 100 villi in control rats to 2.4 (0.6) per 100 villi in tetragastrin treated rats (p less than 0.01). On histological examination, gastric type epithelium was most often found on stunted or flattened villi, and was always within the boundaries of the area of Brunner's glands. These mucosal changes reverted toward normal with time. In week 35, the incidence of gastric epithelium was significantly less than at week 10 (p less than 0.05). In contrast, no villi with gastric epithelium were found in vagotomised rats in week 10 (p less than 0.05). Vagotomy also caused a significant decrease in gastric acid secretion. These results show that exposure of the duodenal mucosa to high levels of gastric acid enhance the induction of gastric eithelium in the duodenum.\r"

In this study the proportions of IgG1-, IgG2-, IgG3-, and IgG4-producing immunocytes were determined by paired immunofluorescence staining in specimens from simple gastritis, gastritis after Billroth II (BII) resection, and gastritis associated with dermatitis herpetiformis (DH). The results were related to histopathological degree of inflammation and atrophy. Generally, IgG1 immunocytes predominated (48-60%) in all types of gastritis. With increasing severity of inflammation, the IgG2-cell proportion was significantly increased from 4-6% to 26-34% in simple and BII gastritis, whereas the ratio of IgG1 immunocytes was correspondingly decreased from 58-69% to 38-43%. In the same types of gastritis the proportion of IgG3 cells was increased in association with severe (35-38%) compared with mild (15-23%) atrophy, whereas the proportion of IgG1 cells was correspondingly decreased. In severe gastritis associated with DH, the proportion of IgG1 cells was relatively high (60%) and that of IgG2 cells relatively low (13%), and severe atrophy did not seem to influence significantly the subclass proportions.\r"

The same series has therefore been kept under surveillance with the particular aim of assessing the effects of diet on malignancy after a further prolonged follow up period. Twelve new cancers have occurred: of which one was a carcinoma of the oesophagus and two lymphomas. Thirty nine cancers developed in 38 patients and of 69 deaths, 33 were the result of malignancy. A two-fold relative risk (RR) of cancer was found and was because of an increased risk of cancer of the mouth and pharynx (RR = 9.7, p less than 0.01, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 2.0-28.3), oesophagus (RR = 12.3, p less than 0.01, CI = 2.5-36.5), and of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (RR = 42.7, p less than 0.001, CI = 19.6-81.4). The results indicate that for coeliac patients who have taken a GFD for five years or more the risk of developing cancer over all sites is not increased when compared with the general population.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

We have investigated the relevance of mucosal mast cells (MMC) to the mechanisms of this enteropathy by using graft-versus-host reaction (GvHR) in the rat as a model of mucosal delayed type hypersensitivity. Measurements of mucosal architecture, intraepithelial lymphocytes (IEL) and MMC counts were performed in control and experimental rats, and release of rat mast cell protease II (RMCPII) into the bloodstream was used as an index of MMC activation. In unirradiated rats, jejunal MMC count was increased on day 14 of the GvHR (mean 272/mm2 v 182 in controls, p less than 0.01), as was serum RMCPII (p less than 0.01). Irradiated rats (4.5 Gy, reconstituted with isogeneic spleen cells) had low counts of IEL and crypt hyperplasia seven to 14 days after irradiation. Irradiated rats with GvHR (induced by ip injection of parental strain spleen cells) and studied on days 7, 10 and 14, had significant enteropathy with longer crypts and higher CCPR than matched irradiated animals (p less than 0.05 on day 14 when compared with irradiation alone). Intraepithelial lymphocytes counts, however, reflected only the effect of radiation. Irradiation, with or without GvHR, led to the virtual disappearance of jejunal MMC, undetectable jejunal RMCPII and very low levels of RMCPII in serum (all p less than 0.01 when compared with unirradiated controls). These experiments show that there is a modest expansion in jejunal MMC in unirradiated rats with semiallogeneic GvHR, whereas irradiation, alone or associated with GvHR, profoundly depletes MMC for at least two weeks. The enteropathy of GvHR can evolve in the virtual absence of MMC.\r"

Disability from Crohn's disease was 2.0-fold more common in women than men (95% confidence interval: 1.8-2.3), while disability from ulcerative colitis was similar in both sexes. White collar employees were affected by both diseases more frequently than blue collar employees, the ratio being 1.3 (1.2-1.5) in Crohn's disease and 1.6 (1.4-1.8) in ulcerative colitis.

Motility of the jejunum was measured in 11 patients with ileoanal anastomosis six (n = 6), or 12 (n = 5) months after closure of the loop ileostomy. Manometric recording from the jejunum were made during fasting (four hours) and after a liquid meal (one hour). These findings were compared with those of six healthy volunteers. Motor events were classified as follows: migrating motor complex (MMC), propagated contractions, or discrete clustered contractions. All patients were investigated for bacterial overgrowth (D-glucose breath test). Only two patients had bacterial overgrowth. The frequency of MMC remained unchanged after ileo-anal anastomosis (2.83 (0.37)/four hours) compared with normal volunteers (2.81 (0.29)/four hours). During fasting, four patients had numerous propagated contractions in the jejunum. This condition was associated in two with bacterial overgrowth and in two with intubation of the reservoir. Discrete clustered contractions were found in the seven patients studied postprandially (7.6 (2.5)/h), but not in volunteers. These seven patients emptied their pouch spontaneously and bacterial overgrowth was found in only one. As this motility pattern was previously described in partial small intestinal obstruction, it is postulated that discrete clustered contractions could be the consequence of a functional obstruction as a result of anastomosis of the small intestine to the high pressure zone of the anal sphincters.\r"

  ".W": "Recent findings suggest that supplemental calcium could lower the abnormally high proliferation rate found in the colonic mucosa of subjects at high risk for colon cancer. In this double blind controlled study, this effect in volunteers previously operated upon for a colorectal adenocarcinoma was tested. Thirty subjects were randomised to receive either elemental calcium 1200 mg/day or a placebo. Mucosal proliferation was measured with tritiated thymidine labelling before and after the 30 day intervention period. Diets, faecal pH and the concentration of calcium and bile acids in the aqueous phase of feaces were also measured. Labelling index did not differ significantly in the two groups before intervention (placebo 4.0(2.4) v calcium 4.9(2.9), but the difference approached significance afterwards (4.4(2.4) v 6.5(3.4), p = 0.06). Individual changes occurring with intervention were tabulated and comparison of the means for the groups was not significant (delta = 0.3 vs delta = 1.8, p = 0.11). Calcium concentration, faecal pH and deoxycholic acid concentration increased in the calcium group (p = 0.02, 0.005 and 0.004 respectively). Calcium does not show any effect in decreasing colonic mucosal proliferation in this high risk group for colon cancer; it may increase faecal pH and the production of deoxycholic acid in the colon.\r"

Deoxycholic acid (1 mmol/l) did not alter anorectal motor patterns under basal conditions but reduced the rectal volumes required to induce a desire to defecate (deoxycholic acid 76 (12) ml v saline 123 (12) ml; mean (SEM) p less than 0.01), and to produce anal relaxation (deoxycholic acid 83 (14) ml v saline 152 (24) ml; p less than 0.05) and perception of the rectal balloon (deoxycholic acid 56 (10) ml v saline 104 (17) ml; p less than 0.01) that were sustained for the period of distension (1 min). Seven of 10 subjects could not tolerate an infusion of 3 mmol/l deoxycholic acid. Between two and 30 minutes after the start of the infusion they experienced an extreme urge to defecate which was associated with large amplitude pressure waves in the rectal channels (amplitude 30 (5) mmHg, duration 0.7 (0.1) min, frequency 1.7 (0.4)/min). Such contractions were never seen during saline infusion. Thus, rectal infusion of deoxycholic acid at physiological concentrations increases the sensitivity of the rectum to distension, and promotes an urgent desire to defecate in normal subjects.\r"

  ".W": "Isaxonine and several other drugs transformed by cytochrome P-450 into reactive metabolites apparently lead to immunoallergic hepatitis in man. Protein epitopes modified by the covalent binding of the metabolites have been proposed as possible targets for the immune response. The purpose of this work was to determine whether covalently bound metabolites are indeed present on hepatocyte plasma membrane proteins. In a first series of experiments, rats were killed 15 or 60 min after administration of [2-14C]isaxonine (0.2 mmol.kg-1 i.p.), and various fractions were prepared from isolated hepatocytes; microsomal contamination of the plasma membrane fraction was 1.2% or less. At 60 min, the amount of isaxonine metabolite covalently bound per mg of protein was similar in plasma membranes (0.42 nmole metabolite.mg protein-1) and in microsomes (0.38); both values were decreased by about 70% in rats pretreated with piperonyl butoxide, an inhibitor of cytochrome P-450. At 15 min, however, covalent binding to plasma membrane proteins (0.06 nmole metabolite.mg protein-1) was only half of that to microsomal proteins (0.12). In a second series of experiments, [2-14C] isaxonine (0.1 mM) was incubated with NADPH, hepatic microsomes and plasma membranes. The reactive isaxonine metabolite became bound extensively to microsomal proteins, but not to plasma membrane proteins. These results show that administration of isaxonine leads to the presence of isaxonine adducts on the proteins of the hepatocyte plasma membrane.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The mechanisms whereby cellular injury occurs and the synergistic role of iron overload are unknown. In the present experiments, we studied hepatic mitochondrial function and lipid peroxidation in rats with hexachlorobenzene-induced porphyria in which iron loading was achieved by dietary carbonyl iron supplementation. Female rats were treated for 8 weeks, receiving a chow diet supplemented with hexachlorobenzene (0.2%, w/w), carbonyl iron (1.0%, w/w) or hexachlorobenzene + iron. Hepatic total porphyrins were increased 100-fold in rats receiving hexachlorobenzene (hexachlorobenzene alone and hexachlorobenzene + Fe), and total hepatic iron was increased approximately 10-fold in rats receiving iron supplementation (Fe alone and hexachlorobenzene + Fe). There was a significant increase in mitochondrial lipid peroxidation in rats treated with hexachlorobenzene alone and hexachlorobenzene + Fe. A significant reduction in mitochondrial respiratory control ratios and in oxidative phosphorylation (ADP/O ratios) using glutamate and succinate as substrates was demonstrated when rats were treated with hexachlorobenzene + iron. The reductions in respiratory control ratios were due to a combination of an inhibitory defect in electron transport as evidenced by an irreversible decrease in State 3 respiration and an uncoupling effect as evidenced by an increase in State 4 respiration. These findings suggest that lipid peroxidation and mitochondrial dysfunction may contribute to the hepatotoxicity seen in hexachlorobenzene-induced porphyria.\r"

  ".W": "The diagnosis of alcoholic hepatitis is difficult to establish by conventional clinical and laboratory methods, and a firm diagnosis relies on liver histology. Since there are severe limitations in following patients with repeated liver biopsies, noninvasive procedures are needed to assess the presence of alcoholic hepatitis in chronic alcohol abusers. It has been suggested that serum Type III procollagen peptide levels correlates with the degree of inflammation in chronic liver disease. Since inflammation is a major histological finding in alcoholic hepatitis, we therefore studied the usefulness of measuring serum Type III procollagen peptide and laminin values in 45 consecutive chronic alcohol abusers, with or without cirrhosis, in detecting those with alcoholic hepatitis. The results showed that both Type III procollagen peptide and laminin values were elevated in all of the patients with established liver damage. However, the values were highest in those with liver cirrhosis plus alcoholic hepatitis (Type III procollagen peptide 50.4 +/- 36.4 ng per ml vs. 8.1 +/- 2.6 in controls, p less than 0.01; laminin 4.50 +/- 1.49 units per liter vs. 1.24 +/- 0.26 units per liter in controls, p less than 0.01), followed by subjects with alcoholic hepatitis alone (Type III procollagen peptide 23.5 +/- 17.6 ng per ml, p less than 0.01; laminin 2.60 +/- 1.09 units per liter, p less than 0.01).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Difficulty in becoming sexually aroused was noted by 18%. Orgasm during intercourse was not experienced by 25%. The frequency of sexual intercourse decreased since onset of disease in 27%. Dyspareunia was a complaint by 21%, most often attributed to decreased vaginal lubrication. Liver disease was considered a significant factor interfering with sexual function in 17%. No statistical difference was found between sexual desire or function in our study and in large studies of sexual behavior in women. Each category was subdivided by presence or absence of cirrhosis, pre- or postmenopausal state, laboratory values and duration of disease. Except for a greater number of postmenopausal women with complaints of painful intercourse, no statistical differences or trends were found. Nonalcoholic liver disease does not affect sexual desire, function or performance. Variables other than liver disease influence sexuality. Women with liver disease can thus be reassured that they can maintain normal sexual relations.\r"

The levels of low-Km and total aldehyde dehydrogenase activity in the liver decreased both in alcoholic and nonalcoholic liver disease patients, who showed an isoelectric focusing pattern of the usual type. There was no significant difference in the aldehyde dehydrogenase activity between alcoholic and nonalcoholic liver disease. In alcoholic liver disease, the decrease in the activity was significantly correlated with the progression of liver histology. The activity in liver cirrhosis was significantly lower than that in the other types of alcoholic liver disease. In nonalcoholic liver disease patients, the unusual type of hepatic aldehyde dehydrogenase activity observed was not different from the unusual type observed in nonhepatobiliary disease patients. These results indicate that the reduction of hepatic low-Km aldehyde dehydrogenase activity is a change that occurs subsequent to liver damage. Genetic abnormality in aldehyde dehydrogenase may not be important in the pathogenesis of alcoholic liver injury.\r"

Elevated levels of 2',5'-oligoadenylate synthetase in peripheral blood mononuclear cells and serum were found in seven chronic hepatitis B patients with acute exacerbation, whereas in the remaining seven chronic hepatitis B patients without acute exacerbation, both levels were similar to those of normal subjects despite active hepatitis B virus multiplication. 2',5'-Oligoadenylate synthetase levels in peripheral blood mononuclear cells and serum, which were not statistically different from those of normal subjects prior to acute exacerbation, increased during acute exacerbation from 3- to 23-fold over initial levels following elevations in ALT activity. 2',5'-Oligoadenylate synthetase levels fluctuated over a normal range while ALT levels were elevated, and they returned to a baseline with ALT normalization. This suggests that the in vivo interferon system may be activated during acute exacerbation, and that this activation may not be a result of hepatitis B virus multiplication alone, but also of a host-immune response to hepatitis B virus multiplication. Three patients were treated with interferon during acute exacerbation. All three had elevated levels of 2',5'-oligoadenylate synthetase in peripheral blood mononuclear cells and serum just before treatment. 2',5'-Oligoadenylate synthetase levels increased only 1.1- to 2.2-fold over initial levels during treatment, with none of the patients clearing HBeAg during and after treatment.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In the same subjects, we also studied the display of CD2, CD3 and CD5 on lymphocytes. In patients with chronic hepatitis B manifesting viral replication (n = 21; Group 1), the expression of vimentin filaments and the other functional monocyte parameters were decreased, whereas in patients in the nonreplicative phase of the disease (n = 14; Group 2) and in control cases with various forms of acute liver damage or inactive HBsAg-negative cirrhosis, they were similar to those found in healthy subjects. In Group 1, there was also a selective defect in the display of CD3 on lymphocytes. The expression of this molecule correlated with the functional state of monocytes. In three patients with chronic hepatitis B that changed from the replicative to the nonreplicative phase of the disease, the expression of vimentin filaments in monocytes and of CD3 on lymphocytes increased to normal levels. On the other hand, the incubation of patients' monocytes with gamma-interferon corrected the diminished expression of vimentin filaments and the other decreased functional parameters.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Since glutaraldehyde-dependent cross-linking of albumin molecules is not likely to occur in vivo, we considered the possibility that albumin may be polymerized by the action of transglutaminase enzymes present in plasma as activated factor XIII or released into plasma from tissues. Guinea pig liver transglutaminase covalently cross-linked human serum albumin molecules into dimers, trimers and polymers up to hexamers as shown by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in sodium dodecyl sulfate. HBsAg particles bound transglutaminase-cross-linked as well as glutaraldehyde-cross-linked human serum albumin as demonstrated by radioimmunoassay and immunoelectron microscopy. The binding was blocked by preincubation of HBsAg with transglutaminase- or glutaraldehyde-cross-linked human serum albumin, anti-HBs or monoclonal anti-pre-S2, but not by polymerized bovine or rat serum albumin or by monomeric human serum albumin. These data indicate that HBsAg particles contain specific binding sites for transglutaminase-cross-linked human serum albumin, but it remains to be determined whether the albumin polymers play a role in the attachment of hepatitis B virus to hepatocytes.\r"

This abnormality has been reported to occur in the livers of animals fed hepatocarcinogens, even before there is any histologic evidence of malignancy (premalignant liver). We have proposed, in an earlier publication, that the deletion of feedback inhibition of cholesterol synthesis in malignancy is due, at least in part, to the loss of receptors which bind chylomicron remnants, the lipoprotein particles that transport dietary cholesterol to the liver. This hypothesis was further tested in the premalignant liver model. Rats were fed a diet containing 0.25% of a known hepatic carcinogen, ethionine. After 3 to 5 weeks on this diet, the liver had no histologic evidence of malignancy; the rate of [14C]acetate incorporation into cholesterol by liver homogenates was elevated as compared to that of controls (5.13 +/- 0.70 vs. 0.65 +/- 0.14 nmoles cholesterol per gm per hr), and in contrast to control animals, this was not reduced by the inclusion of 5% cholesterol in the diet for 48 hr before killing.

The behavior of the 9618A slow-growing hepatoma is more similar to that of the liver, indicating that the changes detected in the fast-growing hepatoma are correlated to the high growth rate of the tumor rather than to carcinogenesis. This conclusion is reinforced by the results obtained with Yoshida AH-130 cells, growing at two different rates imposed by the environment in which they develop. When the Yoshida hepatoma grows rapidly in the peritoneal cavity, constitutive expression of HSC 73 mRNA is high and the inducibility of HSP 70 mRNA is poor: the opposite occurs when the tumor grows slowly in the subcutaneous compartment. The amount of GRP 78 mRNA increases progressively from the liver to the fast-growing hepatoma. The level of HSC 73 mRNA seems to correlate with the methylation state of the corresponding gene.\r"

  ".W": "Hepatitis B virus surface and core antigens (HBsAg, HBcAg) were examined in the resected primary hepatocellular carcinoma from 204 patients who had HBsAg in serum. Ninety patients had small (less than 5 cm) and 114 had large hepatocellular carcinoma (greater than 5 cm). HBsAg was detected in hepatocellular carcinoma in 65 cases (32%) and HBcAg in 30 cases (14.7%); hepatitis B virus antigens were more frequently detected in small (HBsAg in 42.2% and HBcAg in 20%) than in large hepatocellular carcinoma (HBsAg 23.7% and HBcAg 10.5%). These results suggest that replicative forms of hepatitis B virus DNA may exist in hepatocellular carcinoma more frequently than previously believed and that the malignant hepatocytes can support hepatitis B virus replication. A lymphocytic infiltration in hepatocellular carcinoma was more often observed in hepatocellular carcinoma expressing HBsAg (71%) or HBcAg (63%) than in hepatocellular carcinoma with no detectable HBsAg (26%) or HBcAg (37%), p less than 0.01. The reaction was mild in the majority (85%) of the cases. These findings suggest that hepatitis B virus antigen expression in hepatocellular carcinoma can provoke a local immune response. The most striking finding was that patients with hepatitis B virus antigens in small hepatocellular carcinoma had a 5-year survival rate (13%) lower than that (50%) of the antigen-negative patients (p less than 0.05). In contrast, patients with a marked local immune response in hepatocellular carcinoma, regardless of the viral antigen status, had significantly better 5-year survival rates (43%) than those with no or a mild lymphocytic reaction (18%). These findings indicate that a marked immune response in hepatocellular carcinoma is a favorable prognostic sign.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Using the selection technique based on diminished binding of preneoplastic hepatocytes to tissue culture plates precoated with asialofetuin, we have isolated poly(A+)RNA from early preneoplastic foci as well as preneoplastic persistent nodules and primary hepatocellular carcinoma induced by the Solt-Farber protocol in the Fischer rat. The steady-state poly(A+)RNA levels of genes traditionally associated with growth, differentiation and/or transformation were then determined to address the question of their temporal expression in the multistep nature of cancer development. Ornithine decarboxylase- and P53-specific transcripts did not significantly change in preneoplastic foci but were increased in later-stage preneoplastic nodules and hepatocellular carcinoma. Albumin-specific transcripts were decreased in all hepatocellular carcinoma but there was no consistent coordinated increase in alpha-fetoprotein-specific transcripts. c-myc and raf transcripts increased at the very early preneoplastic foci stage and continued to increase throughout the neoplastic process. No L-myc or N-myc transcripts could be detected in any RNA sample. c-Ha-ras-specific transcripts were essentially unaltered in all RNA samples whereas no c-Ki-ras or N-ras transcripts could be detected throughout the neoplastic process. In addition, no dominant-acting transforming mutations in the ras gene family were detected by DNA transfection experiments using NIH/3T3 cells.\r"

We compared the tc gas values (ptcO2, PtcCO2) with the gas tension values in arterial blood samples (PaO2, PaCO2), in normal adults and in RDT-patients at the end of a 30-min test and six times during RDT. During the test, PtcO2 correlated with PaO2 both in normal adults (r 0.72 p less than 0.01) and in RDT patients (r 0.41 p less than 0.05). PtcCO2 correlated with PaCO2 (r 0.59 in normal adults and r 0.76 in RDT). During 14 acetate dialyses the changes were expressed as % delta from time 0. % delta PaO2 was -12.7 at 60 min, + 4.8 at 240 min; % delta PtcO2 -6.0 at 60 min, + 9.7 at 240 min; % delta PaO2 -17.7 at 240 min, -1.8 1 h later; % delta PtcCO2 was -15.8 at 240 min, -3.2 1 h later. Both in normal adults and in RDT, patients there was a good relationship between PtcCO2 and PaCO2 values. In normal adults the absolute PtcO2 values were always lower than PaO2 (-14.4 +/- 10 mmHg); in RDT-patients this difference was more pronounced (-27.6 +/- 15.1) and is probably attributable to the lower Hb levels (6.7 +/- 1.1 vs 12.4 +/- 1.2). During RDT the pattern was the same between tc and gas tension values.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Thirty adult mongrel dogs underwent posta-cavae (P-C) shunts with 40% and 70% hepatectomies. They were divided into two groups, the AST group (n = 19) and control group (n = 11). The AST group received about 0.5 g/kg of the adsorbent intermittently with diet after the operation. The control group was fed the ordinary diet. Body weight, blood ammonia, plasma bile acids were measured, and blood metabolites were analyzed by the multi-column HPLC system. P-C shunt dogs with 70% hepatotectomies died within three months showing about 40-50% body weight loss. HPLC analysis of their plasma showed some specific peaks for middle molecules, about 3000-5000 daltons. After administration of the adsorbent, these peaks were not detected, so it was considered that these substances had been adsorbed.\r"

Native enzyme was circulated on the external side of a lipophilic hollow-fiber membrane while the toxin-containing media (blood, plasma or aqueous solution) were circulated inside the fiber. Glutathione conjugation reactions were catalyzed by rat liver cytosol, with a specific glutathione transferase activity of 40 nmol/min/mg protein (acceptor: 1,2-epoxy-3-(p-nitrophenoxy)propane). Clearance rates of 1,2-epoxy-3-(p-nitrophenoxy)propane, phenylglycidether, styrene oxide, cis-9, 10-epoxystearic acid, cis-9, 10-epoxystearic acid methyl ester, 5a, 6a-cholesterol oxide, 16-, 17a-pregnenolone oxide, and p-nitrobenzylchloride were 10.44, 13.37, 32.25, 7.60, 7.31, 3.92, 4.20 and 29.24 nmol/mg protein/h/cm2 hollow-fiber surface respectively. This technique makes possible glutathione conjugation reactions with crude enzyme preparations over long periods without loss of activity from covalent immobilization and without loss of cofactor from (auto)oxidation. The lipophilic membrane ensures the absence of hemolysis, immunological hazards and hormone loss, while elimination of the toxin is not impaired.\r"

This goal can be achieved by the application of infrared spectroscopy which, unlike electrochemical sensors, responds directly to the glucose molecule. An investigation under physiological conditions revealed five glucose absorption bands in the near and middle infrared range. These are 1040, 1085, 1109, 1160 and 1365 cm-1. Only the 1040 cm-1 frequency coincides with none of the other infrared-active blood substances like proteins, lipids and urea. Nevertheless, the other absorption bands too, especially the 1109 cm-1 frequency, can be used for blood glucose measurement, if the superimposed absorptions are compensated. Methods for the compensation have been found. Technically feasible embodiments of an infrared glucose sensor are described.\r"

  ".W": "Conventional urea kinetic modelling (UKM) has several drawbacks, in particular the complexity of the required calculations and the need for accurate values of parameters which are difficult to measure, such as dialyzer clearance and blood flow. An alternative method of UKM is proposed based on collecting a small fraction of spent dialysate flow for 3 consecutive dialyses. Application of a urea mass balance to the 7 day period permits neglecting changes in body urea stores. Thus no blood sampling is required for most patients. The required calculations are simple and straightforward. The partial dialysate collection (PDC) method was compared to conventional UKM in a 3 patient, 15 week study. Protein catabolic rate (PCR) from PDC was a smooth curve and consistent with dietary estimation for each patient. Conventional UKM gave variable PCR results which were 17-27% higher on average. This discrepancy was attributed to overestimation of dialyzer clearance. PDC was concluded to be more convenient and accurate than conventional UKM and therefore ideal for routine clinical use.\r"

Further exploration usually revealed the headache symptoms had indeed been \"good\" in a relative sense, in that it had somehow served to help the patient avoid a more unpleasant emotional situation. The headache may have allowed a \"time out\" or a forced period of rest in a hectic schedule, resolved a conflict for the patient in an acceptable way by becoming sick, or represented a suppressed or repressed affect, usually anger. When headaches are described as good, there may very well be something in the patient's life that is worse.\r"

Pain, it is assumed, is experienced when the muscles are in spasm. It is further assumed that learned reductions in muscle tone between headache episodes will reduce the probability of future pain episodes. In this experiment, details are given of EMG measures made on the frontal, occipital, and neck muscles of separate groups of migraine and tension headache subjects. The measures were made before the onset of head pain and later when the same subjects reported pain. As part of the experiment, subjects were exposed to an experimental stressor during the pain-free period, and these results were compared with those of a group of non-headache subjects. Results showed that the headache groups did not differ on any of the pre-headache measures. Neck muscle levels varied markedly when compared with control subjects who had comparatively low levels reactive to an experimental stressor. When the data taken during the headache phase were analysed according to diagnosis, the occipital muscle output was found to be significantly lower in the migraine group and higher in the tension group.\r"

It has been hypothesized that derangement of the autonomic nervous system (ANS) plays an important role in the pathogenesis of migraine. However, reports on the ANS function in MCH have rarely been submitted. Therefore, in this report, MCH patients were investigated as well as migraine patients. The cardiovascular reflex responses by orthostatic test, isometric work test and the pulse rate (R-R interval) variation in fifteen MCH patients and fifteen migraine patients were recorded during headache-free intervals. The plasma norepinephrine (NE) levels were also measured throughout the orthostatic tests. Fifteen healthy subjects served as the age-matched control group. In the MCH group and the migraine group, blood pressure immediately after going from the supine to the erect position decreased more significantly than in the control group. The basal NE level was significantly low in both the MCH group and the migraine group, in comparison with the control group. MCH patients as well as migraine patients showed cardiovascular sympathetic hypofunction.\r"

There have been recent differences of opinion with regard to the effect of the artificial sweetener aspartame as a precipitant of headache. To assess the importance of aspartame as a dietary factor in headache, 190 consecutive patients of the Montefiore Medical Center Headache Unit were questioned about the effect of alcohol, carbohydrates and aspartame in triggering their headaches. Of the 171 patients who fully completed the survey, 49.7 percent reported alcohol as a precipitating factor, compared to 8.2 percent reporting aspartame and 2.3 percent reporting carbohydrates. Patients with migraine were significantly more likely to report alcohol as a triggering factor and also reported aspartame as a precipitant three times more often than those having other types of headache. The conflicting results of two recent placebo-control studies of aspartame and headache are discussed. We conclude that aspartame may be an important dietary trigger of headache in some people.\r"

We hypothesize the presence in weekend headache prone subjects of a particular psychological background, different from that of common migraine sufferers. In order to detect possible differences supporting our hypothesis, we studied 104 new outpatients: 46 patients suffering from headache only on weekends (23 males and 23 females) and 58 matched common migraineurs (26 males and 32 females) with no weekend predilection. The psychological assessment was performed using the following psychometric tools: MMPI, BDI, STAIX1-X2. A clinical assessment of each patient was also carried out. Significant differences were found after statistically analyzing the test results. Most of the MMPI scales were found to be more elevated in both male and female weekend headache sufferers. From a clinical point of view, the weekend headache attacks proved to be similar to those of common migraine, but with a significantly higher incidence of concomitant symptoms. Our study confirms the important role that psychological factors play in the pathogenesis and clinical development of migraine and leads us to conclude that a psychic tension component is associated with the vascular one in weekend headache.\r"

Comparisons were made with a group of healthy volunteer controls, 12 children and 15 adults, not suffering from headache. In Group A, only the CLM patients had significant mydriasis after phenylephrine; pupillary responses in the TH and CM cases did not differ significantly from the healthy controls, although there was an evident tendency for increased response in the CM by comparison with the TH cases. On the other hand, in Group B (adult CM) there was a significant pupillary hyper-responsiveness to adrenergic receptor stimulation, higher than in the same clinical condition in the pediatric group. In pre-pharmacological testing conditions, a significantly higher percentage of anisocoria (p less than 0.05) and a significant reduction in mean pupil size (p less than 0.01) were only evident in adult migraineurs as compared with controls. These findings suggest that a subtle chronic sympathetic deficiency affecting the iris neuromuscular junction in some clinical forms of primary headache may be detected by pupillometry at an early age. Moreover, apart from a temporal factor responsible for a progressive sympathetic imbalance during development, there may be a more evident neural transmission disorder in migraine forms as opposed to tension forms.\r"

Invest. 76: 620-629, 1985) reported that regional phasic lung distension during high-frequency oscillations (HFO) is substantially and systemically heterogeneous when both frequency (f) and tidal volume (VT) are large. They hypothesized that this phenomenon was attributable to central airway geometry and preferential axial flow induced therein by the momentum flux of the inspiratory gas stream. According to that hypothesis, the observed distribution of phasic lung distension would depend on the ratio VT/VD* (where VD* is an index of anatomic dead space), independent of gas density (rho), when f is scaled in proportion to lung resonant frequency, fo. To test this hypothesis, we used the methods of Allen et al. (ibid.) to study six excised dog lungs during HFO (f = 2-32 Hz; VT = 5-80 ml) using gases of different densities. Alveolar pressure excursions (PA) were measured as rho spanned a 12-fold range using He, air, and SF6. The apex-to-base and right-to-left ratios of PA were used as indexes of regional heterogeneity of phasic lung distension. For each gas at low f, distension of the lung base was favored slightly independent of VT, but at higher f distension of the lung apex was favored when VT was small, whereas distension of the lung base was favored when VT was large. In addition, we observed substantial right-to-left differences in apical lobes during oscillation at high f not seen before.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Two groups were trained to run on a motor-driven rodent treadmill at 27 m/min, 1 h/day, 5 days/wk and were given a nutritionally balanced liquid diet; one of these groups received 35% calories as ethanol whereas in the other, sucrose was isocalorically substituted for the ethanol. Appropriate sedentary and nonethanol controls were also used. Clearance of a 1.75-g/kg ethanol dose injected intraperitoneally was determined by measuring ethanol levels in the blood each hour and utilizing these values in the Widmark equation (R. Teschke, F. Moreno, and A. Petrides, Biochem. Pharmacol. 30: 1745-1751, 1981) for calculating whole-body ethanol clearance. Rates of ethanol clearance were determined for each rat at 4 and 7 wk of training. The clearance tests at 4 wk included a 60-min period of running exercise, whereas the tests 3 wk later were conducted at rest. The results indicate that both acute exercise and exercise training can increase rates of in vivo ethanol clearance. In addition, the chronic exercise appeared to increase in vitro ethanol metabolism by hepatic microsomes without altering in vitro hepatic alcohol dehydrogenase activity.\r"

  ".W": "The mitochondrial redox (NAD+/NADH) state can be used as a reflection of oxygen availability within the mitochondrion. Previous studies using isolated muscle preparations suggest that active muscle is not hypoxic during lactate production, whereas experiments with humans come to the opposite conclusion. Six men exercised for 5 min at 75% maximal O2 consumption (VO2max) and then at 100% VO2max to exhaustion. Ammonia, oxoglutarate (alpha-ketoglutarate), and glutamate, as well as lactate, were measured in biopsies (vastus lateralis) taken at the end of each exercise. The three former metabolites were used to determine the mass action ratio of glutamate dehydrogenase and thus were used as an estimate of the mitochondrial redox state. Muscle lactate increased (P less than 0.05) to 14.5 and 24.5 mmol/kg wet wt after 75 and 100% VO2max, respectively. At both exercise intensities, muscle ammonia rose (P less than 0.05), glutamate fell (P less than 0.05) to only 30-35% of rest levels, and oxoglutarate declined (P less than 0.05). Despite the high levels of muscle lactate accumulation, the estimated mitochondrial redox rate rose 300% (P less than 0.05) in both exercise bouts. This response should increase the activity of key oxidative enzymes and promote increased VO2. Furthermore the data do not support the concept that muscle lactate is formed because of tissue hypoxia.\r"

In particular, we wished to determine whether the occurrence of anaerobic metabolism correlated with fatigue as defined by decline in force generation. In 10 anesthetized mechanically ventilated mongrel dogs we measured arterial pressure, transdiaphragmatic pressure (Pdi), phrenic arterial flow (Qdi-Doppler flow probe), arterial and phrenic venous blood gases, and lactate levels. From these we derived indexes of diaphragm O2 consumption (VO2) and lactate production. Bilateral phrenic nerve pacing was carried out (50 Hz, duty cycle 0.4, 24 contractions/min) for two 15-min pacing periods separated by a 45-min rest period. Over each pacing period Pdi decreased from approximately 16 to approximately 10 cmH2O (P less than 0.01, no significant difference between periods). Initially, during pacing, Qdi and VO2 each increased fivefold over prepacing base line. Qdi remained elevated at this level whereas VO2 decreased over the pacing period by approximately 25%. Hence, the change in VO2 over the pacing period was due primarily to changes in O2 extraction. During the first pacing period lactate production was observed early and declined throughout the pacing period. No lactate production was observed during the second pacing period, although Pdi, VO2, and Qdi responses were the same for both pacing periods. Phrenic venous PO2 remained greater than 30 Torr throughout both pacing periods.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Rats pretreated with the long-lived conjugates PEG-inactivated-SOD + PEG-inactivated-CAT or PEG-albumin also had decreased acute oxidative edematous lung injury compared with rats pretreated with PEG, SOD + CAT + PEG, SOD + CAT, or saline. In vitro studies suggested that PEG itself may have contributed to protection by scavenging hydroxyl radical (.OH) but not superoxide (O2-.) or H2O2.

We have used dichloroacetate to test the hypothesis that a limitation in pyruvate dehydrogenase activity is responsible for the rise in plasma lactate. Dichloroacetate stimulates the activity of pyruvate dehydrogenase, which is normally the regulatory enzyme in the oxidation of glucose when tissue oxygenation is adequate. Six subjects were studied twice according to a randomized, crossover protocol, involving one test with saline infusion and another with dichloroacetate infusion. Exercise load on a bicycle ergometer was increased progressively until exhaustion. Blood samples were drawn each minute throughout exercise and periodically throughout 120 min of recovery. Dichloroacetate significantly lowered the lactate concentration during exercise performed at less than 80% of the average maximal O2 consumption. The peak concentration of lactate at exhaustion was not affected by dichloroacetate treatment, but dichloroacetate did lower lactate concentration throughout recovery. These results suggest that a limitation in pyruvate dehydrogenase activity contributes to the increase in plasma lactate during submaximal exercise and recovery.\r"

Two series of experiments were performed on 12 vagotomized and sinoaortic denervated cats. The first series examined the effect of focal cooling of the VMS on the respiratory response to DNP in four spontaneously breathing, anesthetized cats. When the VMS temperature was 37 degrees C, systemic administration of DNP increased minute ventilation under nearly isocapnic conditions, and focal cooling of the intermediate area of VMS to 20 degrees C attenuated the ventilatory augmentation caused by DNP. To eliminate the influence of anesthetics, a second group of experiments was performed on eight decerebrate, artificially ventilated cats while phrenic nerve activity was monitored as an index of respiration. AgNO3 (10%) was topically applied to the VMS until the respiratory response to inhaled CO2 was abolished. Apnea occurred in seven of eight cats after AgNO3, whereas in the remaining one animal, tidal phrenic activity decreased substantially. Systemic administration of DNP produced no respiratory excitation in any of the animals. On the other hand, rhythmic respiratory activity could be provoked by electrical stimulation of the mesencephalic locomotor area and carotid sinus nerve and by excitation of somatic afferents. Histological examination of the brain stem showed that the AgNO3 had penetrated no more than 350 microns from the ventral medullary surface. These results indicate superficial structures of the VMS are of potential importance in mediating the respiratory responses to hypermetabolism.\r"

  ".W": "If sonomicrometry transducers could be implanted permanently into the diaphragm, direct measurements of costal and crural length and shortening could be made during recovery from the laparotomy and then indefinitely in an awake, non-anesthetized mammal. We report results from six canines in which we successfully implanted transducers onto the left hemidiaphragm through a midline laparotomy and measured segmental shortening and ventilation at intervals through 22 days of postoperative recovery. After laparotomy, breathing pattern, including tidal volume, respiratory rate and mean inspiratory flow, stabilized by the 4th postoperative day (POD). Tidal shortening of costal and crural segments increased from 1.82 and 1.45% of end-expiratory length (%LFRC) on the 2nd POD to 5.32 and 8.56% LFRC, respectively, after a mean of 22 POD. Segmental shortening did not stabilize until 10 POD, and the recovery process displayed a sequence of segmental motions: lengthening, biphasic inspiratory lengthening-shortening, and increasing simple shortening. Three weeks after implantation, costal and crural segments were stable and shortening 5.32 and 8.56% LFRC, respectively, and capable of shortening 49% LFRC with maximal phrenic stimulation. In a pair of recovered animals, the initial postoperative dysfunction did not recur after a subsequent, simple laparotomy. At postmortem examination, the chronically implanted sonomicrometer transducers were found to have evoked only a thin fibrotic capsule within the diaphragm.\r"

  ".W": "This study examined the question of whether increases in plasma volume (hypervolemia) induced through exercise affect muscle substrate utilization and muscle bioenergetics during prolonged heavy effort. Six untrained males (19-24 yr) were studied before and after 3 consecutive days of cycling (2 h/day at 65% of peak O2 consumption) performed in a cool environment (22-23 degrees C, 25-35% relative humidity). This protocol resulted in a 21.2% increase in plasma volume (P less than 0.05). During exercise no difference was found in the blood concentrations of glucose, lactate, and plasma free fatty acids at either 30, 60, 90, or 120 min of exercise before and after the hypervolemia. In contrast, blood alanine was higher (P less than 0.05) during both rest and exercise with hypervolemia. Measurement of muscle samples extracted by biopsy from the vastus lateralis muscle at rest and at 60 and 120 min of exercise indicated no effect of training on high-energy phosphate metabolism (ATP, ADP, creatine phosphate, creatine) or on selected glycolytic intermediate concentrations (glucose 1-phosphate, glucose 6-phosphate, fructose 6-phosphate, lactate). In contrast, training resulted in higher (P less than 0.05) muscle glucose and muscle glycogen concentrations. These changes were accompanied by blunting of the exercise-induced increase (P less than 0.05) in both blood epinephrine and norepinephrine concentrations. Plasma glucagon and serum insulin were not affected by the training. The results indicate that exercise-induced hypervolemia did not alter muscle energy homeostasis. The reduction in muscle glycogen utilization appears to be an early adaptive response to training mediated either by an increase in blood glucose utilization or a decrease in anaerobic glycolysis.\r"

Concentration-response curves were generated with muscarinic stimulation (acetylcholine, ACh), alpha-adrenergic receptor activation (norepinephrine after beta-adrenoceptor blockade, NE), serotonin (5-HT), and KCl-substituted Krebs-Henseleit solution. The concentrations of 5-HT causing half-maximal shortening (ECS50, 1.54 +/- 0.14 X 10(-7) M) and half-maximal active isometric tension (ECT50, 1.72 +/- 0.30 X 10(-7) M) were similar (P = NS). Likewise, ECS50 (21.9 +/- 0.7 mM) and ECT50, (22.0 +/- 0.9 mM) were similar for KCl. In contrast, facilitated isotonic shortening (i.e., greater isotonic shortening for comparable degrees of force generation) was elicited with ACh and NE for all levels of force generation between 15 and 85% of maximum and for all concentrations of ACh from 3 X 10(-8) to 3 X 10(-5) M (P less than 0.05 for all points). Facilitated isotonic shortening also was elicited for all concentrations of NE from 10(-8) to 10(-6) M (P less than 0.05 for all points). Removal of Ca2+ from the perfusate substantially reduced the potency of ACh (P less than 0.001) and abolished differences between ECS50 (2.23 +/- 0.28 X 10(-5) M) and ECT50 (2.50 +/- 0.46 X 10(-5) M, P = NS). We demonstrate that for comparable degrees of force generation, muscarinic and alpha-adrenergic receptor activation cause greater isotonic shortening than KCl or 5-HT and that this facilitated shortening is associated with the concentration of external Ca2+.\r"

In five dogs, dose-response curves were generated by rapid intra-arterial injection of 10(-10) to 10(-6) mol PAF into the isolated tracheal circulation; tracheal contractile response was measured isometrically in situ. To examine the mechanism by which PAF elicits contraction of canine trachealis, concentrations of serotonin (5-HT) and histamine were assayed in the venous effluent as the arteriovenous difference (AVd) in mediator concentration across the airway for each level of contraction. PAF caused dose-related active tracheal tension to a maximum of 37.2 +/- 5.4 g/cm (10(-6) mol PAF). The AVd in 5-HT increased linearly from 0.20 +/- 0.05 (10(-9) mol PAF) to 3.5 +/- 0.3 ng/ml (10(-6) mol PAF) (P less than 0.005). In contrast, the AVd in histamine was insignificant and did not change with increasing doses of PAF. A positive correlation was obtained between the AVd in 5-HT and active tracheal tension (r = 0.92, P less than 0.001); there was no correlation between AVd in histamine and active tension (r = -0.16). PAF-induced parasympathetic activation was not mediated by 5-HT; contraction elicited by exogenous 5-HT was not affected by muscarinic blockade. We conclude that nonparasympathetically mediated contraction elicited acutely by PAF in dogs results at least in part from secondary release of serotonin and is not mediated by histamine.\r"

Testing included measurements of maximal O2 uptake (VO2 max) and select cardiovascular responses to graded treadmill exercise. VO2 max expressed on an absolute basis (ml/min) was significantly decreased after HOZ (-14.1 +/- 2.5%) and HDT (-14.3 +/- 2.0%), while being essentially unchanged in CON (-1.0 +/- 3.3%). Significant reductions in body weight were observed after both HOZ (-10.1 +/- 4.2 g) and HDT (-22.5 +/- 3.3 g), whereas CON animals exhibited a significant increase in weight (10.4 +/- 3.8 g). As a result, when VO2 max was normalized for body weight, all groups exhibited similar significant reductions of 6-7%. Although no differences in heart rate and blood pressure response to graded exercise were observed, the HDT group exhibited greater increases in mesenteric resistance at the same absolute exercise intensity. Furthermore, both suspended groups had higher iliac resistance values during exercise at similar relative exercise conditions, suggesting that muscle blood flow during treadmill running may have been reduced after suspension. In general, the decrements associated with the HOZ and HDT conditions were similar. It was concluded that reduction in exercise capacity and altered cardiovascular responses to exercise observed after 6-9 days of suspension were attributable to a combination of hypokinesia, lack of hindlimb weight bearing, or restraint, rather than to hydrostatic influences associated with HDT.\r"

Contralateral forearm and calf blood flows (strain gauge plethysmography) and arterial blood pressure (auscultation) were measured simultaneously. Each exercise caused a decrease in forearm vascular resistance and a progressive increase in calf resistance. These changes were greatest with the 40% MVC. With finger exercise at 20 and 40% MVC, the percentage decreases in forearm vascular resistance from control were 12.3 and 22.7%, respectively (P less than 0.01). Similar decreases (9.5 and 24.9%, respectively; P less than 0.01) were noted with exercise of the quadriceps muscle. By contrast, the corresponding increases in calf vascular resistance were greater (P less than 0.01) with quadriceps exercise (13.3 and 55.4%, respectively) than with finger exercise (6.0 and 36.0%). Arrest of the circulation to the exercising muscles just before the exercise ended caused an abrupt increase in forearm vascular resistance and a decrease in calf resistance. These studies provide further evidence of the heterogeneity of responses of forearm and calf resistance vessels to certain cardiovascular stimuli.\r"

We then tested the hypotheses that the specific Po of vascularized grafts is significantly less than that of control RFM muscles and the deficit in the specific Po is associated with increases in connective tissue and interstitial space. The specific Po of the grafts was 65% of the value for control RFM muscles. Connective tissue protein concentration of grafts was 3.8 times greater than the control value of 16.6 +/- 3 micrograms/mg wet mass, but this only accounted for a 5% correction in specific Po. The volume of interstitial space did not differ between grafts and control muscles. We conclude that the deficit of 35% in specific Po of vascularized grafts compared with control values is partially explained by an increase in connective tissue, but a 30% unresolved deficit remains.\r"

We used a pseudorandom load application technique to estimate the immediate pattern responses from the zeroth lag of the cross correlation between the load application sequence and the respiratory pattern components of tidal volume (VT), inspiratory and expiratory time (TI and TE), and the instantaneous respiratory frequency (f), minute ventilation (VI), and mean inspiratory flow (VT/TI). Elevation of the background resistance served to reduce the TI and TE responses to small perturbations in resistance from those in the control background state, which resulted in generally smaller perturbations of f, VI, and VT/TI. Elevation of the background elastance, however, served to initiate a TI reduction not seen in the control state but did not appreciably affect the rest of the pattern responses to the load perturbations. Thus the neural reflexes involved in breath-by-breath pattern regulation are modulated by the background level of the respiratory impedance, as well as by the type and size of the load perturbation.\r"

  ".W": "We studied the influence of central and peripheral chemoreceptor stimulation on the activities of the phrenic and internal intercostal (iic) nerves in decerebrate, vagotomized, and paralyzed cats with bilateral pneumothoraces. Whole iic nerves of the rostral thorax (T2-T5) usually discharged during neural inspiration, whereas those of the caudal thorax (T7-T11) were primarily active during neural expiration. Filaments of rostral iic nerves that terminated in iic muscles generally discharged during expiration, suggesting that inspiratory activity recorded in whole iic nerves may have innervated other structures, possibly parasternal muscles. All nerves were phasically active at hyperoxic normocapnia and increased their activities systematically with hypercapnia. Isocapnic hypoxia or intra-arterial NaCN injection consistently increased phrenic and inspiratory iic nerve activities. In contrast, expiratory iic nerve discharges were either decreased (10 cats) or increased (7 cats) by hypoxia. Furthermore, expiratory responses to NaCN were highly variable and could not be predicted from the corresponding response to hypoxia. The results show that central and peripheral chemoreceptor stimulation can affect inspiratory and expiratory motoneuron activities differentially. The variable effects of hypoxia on expiratory iic nerve activity may reflect a relatively weak influence of carotid body afferents on expiratory bulbospinal neurons. However, the possibility that the magnitude of expiratory motoneuron activity is influenced by the intensity of the preceding centrally generated inspiratory discharge is also discussed.\r"

Infarct size in the MI groups of rats comprised 28-29% of the total left ventricle and resulted in both metabolic and hemodynamic changes that suggested that these animals had moderate compensated heart failure. The training regimen used in the present study produced significant increases in maximal O2 uptake (VO2max) when expressed in absolute terms (ml/min) or when normalized for body weight (ml.min-1.kg-1) and consisted of treadmill running at work loads that were equivalent to 70-80% of the animal's VO2max for a period of 60 min/day, 5 days/wk over an 8- to 10-wk interval. This training paradigm produced two major cardiocirculatory adaptations in the MI rat that had not been elicited previously when using a training paradigm of a lower intensity. First, the decrement in the maximal heart rate response to exercise (known as \"chronotropic incompetence\") found in the sedentary MI rat was completely reversed by endurance training. Second, the downregulation of cardiac myosin isozyme composition from the fast ATPase V1 isoform toward the slower ATPase (V2 and V3) isoforms in the MI rat was partially reversed by endurance training. These cardiac adaptations occurred without a significant increase in left ventricular pump function as an increase in maximal cardiac output (Qmax) and maximal stroke volume (SVmax) did not occur in the trained MI rat.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

To evaluate aerosol delivery, 6 adult sheep (9 mo-3 yr old) and 12 lambs (4-8 wk old) were challenged with aerosol (aH) and intravenous histamine (ivH). Awake animals were intubated and studied in a plethysmograph, which measured dynamic compliance (Cdyn), resistance of the lung, and functional residual capacity. AR to histamine was measured by administration of increasing concentrations of histamine until a significant change in lung mechanics occurred or until the maximum dose of histamine was given. In all six adult sheep, the response to both aH and iVH was a decrease in Cdyn. In two lambs Cdyn was decreased with both aH and ivH, in five lambs with neither, in three lambs with aH only, and in two lambs with ivH only. To examine the role of beta-adrenergic activity in determining AR, six adult sheep and six lambs received ivH and on a separate day ivH with propranolol pretreatment (p + ivH). The median effective dose of histamine that caused a reduction in Cdyn to 65% of normal saline control (ED65Cdyn) for the adult sheep given ivH was 3.60 (range 0.23-4.85) and 0.70 (range 0.49-8.0) micrograms.kg-1.min-1 for p + ivH (P = NS). The median ED65Cdyn for the six lambs was 8.0 micrograms.kg-1.min-1 for both ivH alone and p + ivH. To evaluate the role of airway smooth muscle (SM), AR to aH was quantitated in six adult sheep and six lambs, and then an open-lung biopsy was performed.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The purpose of this study was to guage this response in rat plantaris muscles subjected to increased levels of activity resulting from the surgical removal of the synergistic gastrocnemius and soleus muscles. Thirty-seven days of overload increased plantaris absolute (69%) and relative (82%) weight, whole muscle (35%) and individual fiber (37%) mean cross-sectional area, half-relaxation time (1/2RT; 25%), and maximum tetanic tension (P0; 21%). In a separate group of animals that had undergone 30 days of overload, three-quarters of the plantaris muscle fibers were denervated by sectioning radicular nerve L4. At 7 days postlesion, contractile responses were obtained from sprouting motor units remaining in radicular nerve L5, and the results compared to a nonoverloaded group that had undergone this same procedure. Twitch time to peak tension and 1/2RT were prolonged in normal partially denervated (PD) and overloaded partially denervated (OPD) muscles, and this response was significantly greater in the overloaded muscles. Both PD and OPD muscles increased twitch tension (38%) and peak tension developed at 25 Hz (34%) to a similar extent, during recovery from partial denervation. These increases, attributable to sprouting of L5 motor axon collaterals, were matched in PD muscles with a corresponding increase in P0, a response which did not occur in OPD muscles. Additionally, a more extensive decrease in P0 occurred as a result of partial denervation in OPD muscles compared with whole muscle P0 of nondenervated muscle (L4 plus L5 stimulation).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Exposure to cold increased all these measurements significantly. Mean heart weight of CA rats was also increased significantly above that of controls. The responsiveness of MBP and heart rate to administration of the beta-adrenergic agonist, isoproterenol (3, 5, and 8 micrograms/kg ip), to unanesthetized, unrestrained, CA rats during exposure to air at 6 degrees C was similar to, and possibly less than, that of warm-acclimated (WA) rats measured at 25 degrees C. Acute administration of the alpha-adrenergic agonist, phenylephrine (100 micrograms/kg ip), to CA rats while in air at 6 degrees C induced less of a change in MBP from pretreatment level than was observed in WA rats. However, no differences were observed between groups when changes in heart rate from pretreatment level were compared. A similar statement may be made for a higher dose of phenylephrine (150 micrograms/kg ip), although MBP were elevated to higher levels in both groups with the higher dose. Abrupt exposure of WA rats to cold (6 degrees C) resulted in a sharp increase in heart rate and a more gradual increase in MBP over a period of 1 h. Removal of CA rats from 6 to 25 degrees C resulted in a gradual decrease in heart rate with no significant change in MBP during the ensuing hour.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Tasks consisted of maintaining a target esophageal pressure, breathing frequency, and duty cycle for 3-5 min, after which the subjects maintained the highest esophageal pressure possible for an additional 5 min. After loading, Pinsp decreased in all subjects [control, -128 +/- 14 (SD) cmH2O; with fatigue, -102 +/- 18 cmH2O; P less than 0.001, paired t test].

These data suggest that 1) inability to sustain the target during loading resulted from fatigue of the inspiratory rib cage muscles, not diaphragm, and 2) simultaneous measurement of Pinsp and Pdimax may be useful in partitioning muscle fatigue into rib cage and diaphragmatic components.\r"

  ".W": "This study sought to assess the effect of variations in upper airway muscle activity on upper airway pressure-volume properties. Upper airway elastance, closing pressure, and reserve volume were measured in the isolated upper airways of anesthetized rabbits under control conditions and after administration of gallamine (2 mg/kg iv) or after 10 min of spontaneous respiration of 7% CO2 in O2. Administration of gallamine to seven animals was associated with a fall in reserve volume from 0.94 +/- 0.24 to 0.69 +/- 0.17 (95% confidence interval) ml (P less than 0.01) and of closing pressure from -7.53 +/- 0.23 to -5.75 +/- 1.05 cmH2O (P less than 0.01), but airway elastance did not change significantly. Hypercapnia in seven animals was associated with a rise in elastance from 7.06 +/- 0.91 to 7.67 +/- 0.86 cmH2O/ml (P less than 0.001) and in reserve volume from 0.68 +/- 0.06 to 0.86 +/- 0.13 ml (P less than 0.05). Closing pressure also changed from -5.88 +/- 0.94 to -7.92 +/- 1.85 cmH2O. This change was correlated with the change in reserve volume but not with the change in elastance. In three animals exposed to hypercapnia, return to room air breathing was associated with return of elastance, reserve volume, and closing pressure to control levels. It is concluded that muscle activity in the upper airway affects both the size and elastance of the airway, but the dominant mechanism by which upper airway muscles increase the resistance of the upper airway to collapse is by increasing airway volume.\r"

  ".W": "In 10 anesthetized rabbits the upper airway cephalad of the vocal cords was isolated from the distal airway and sealed. Static deflation pressure-volume data were recorded from the isolated upper airway. The relationship between pressure and volume in the upper airway was a straight line; the correlation coefficient (r) ranged from 0.97 to 1.00. The following quantities were derived from the data: the pressure-volume ratio (upper airway elastance, cmH2O/ml), the pressure in the airway at airway closure (closing pressure, cmH2O), and the airway volume at zero airway pressure (reserve volume, ml). Mean upper airway elastance was 8.13 +/- 1.45 [95% confidence intervals (CI)] cmH2O/ml, closing pressure was -6.93 +/- 1.53 (95% CI) cmH2O, and reserve volume was 0.74 +/- 0.15 (95% CI) ml. There was no significant correlation between elastance and closing pressure (r = 0.47, P greater than 0.1), but closing pressure and reserve volume were significantly correlated (r = 0.77, P less than 0.01). Pressure-volume data recorded from newly dead animals exhibited the same linear relationship between pressure and volume observed in living animals. It is concluded that the pressure-volume properties of the isolated upper airway of the rabbit can be expressed as a single value for airway elastance, that estimation of pressure-volume properties over part of the volume range is representative of the whole volume range, and that pressure-volume properties are determined by passive elastic properties of the airway tissues. It appears that the resistance of the upper airway to collapse by negative intraluminal pressure is more dependent on the initial size of the airway than on its elastance.\r"

A weight corresponding to 10% of the bird's body mass was attached to one wing. Thirty days of stretch in 34 birds averaged 171.8 +/- 13.5% increase in muscle mass and 23.5 +/- 0.8% increase in muscle fiber length. The volume density of noncontractile tissue increased in middle and distal regions of stretch-enlarged muscles. Mean fiber cross-sectional area increased 56.7 +/- 12.3% in the midregion of stretched muscles. Further analysis indicated slow beta-fiber hypertrophy occurred in proximal, middle, and distal regions; however, fast alpha-type fiber hypertrophy was limited to middle regions of stretched muscles. Stretched muscles had a significant increase in the frequency of slow beta-fibers that were less than 500 microns 2 in all regions and fast alpha-type fibers in middle and distal regions. Total fiber number was determined after nitric acid digestion of connective tissue in 10 birds. Fiber number increased 51.8 +/- 19.4% in stretched muscle. These results are the first to clearly show that muscle fiber proliferation contributes substantially to adult skeletal muscle stretch-induced enlargement, although we do not know whether the responses of the slow tonic anterior latissimus dorsi might be similar or different from mammalian twitch muscle.\r"

Four groups were used: 1) prevagotomy (control), 2) bilateral vagotomy, 3) post-atropine, and 4) post-propranolol. Left lung hypoxia decreased Ql/Qt from 42.9 +/- 2.9 to 28.1 +/- 3.0%, from 41.1 +/- 5.3 to 26.7 +/- 4.2%, from 38.6 +/- 1.3 to 22.2 +/- 2.4%, and from 48.2 +/- 4.2 to 28.5 +/- 3.7% in the four groups, respectively.

However, chemoreceptor stimulation had no effect on Ql/Qt during left lung hypoxia after vagotomy or atropine, as Ql/Qt went from 26.7 +/- 4.2 to 29.3 +/- 5.2% and from 22.2 +/- 2.4 to 24.1 +/- 1.5% in groups 2 and 3, respectively. Because chemoreceptor stimulation did not affect HPV in groups 2 and 3, we conclude that the chemoreceptor attenuation of HPV is mediated by the parasympathetic nervous system.\r"

An antigravity suit was applied (60 Torr legs, 30 Torr abdomen) during the last 3 h of tilt. A similar noninflation experiment was conducted where the suited subjects were tilted for 3.5 h. To provide adequate urine flow, the subjects were hydrated during the course of both experiments. Immediately after inflation, mean arterial pressure increased by 8 +/- 3 Torr and pulse rate decreased by 16 +/- 3 beats/min. Plasma renin activity and aldosterone were maximally suppressed (P less than 0.05) after 2.5 h of inflation. Plasma vasopressin decreased by 40-50% (P less than 0.05) and plasma sodium and potassium remained unchanged during both experiments. Glomerular filtration rate was not increased significantly by inflation, whereas inflation induced marked increases (P less than 0.05) in effective renal plasma flow (ERPF), urine flow, osmolar and free water clearances, and total and fractional sodium excretion. No such changes occurred during control. Thus, LBPP induces 1) a significant increase in ERPF and 2) significant changes in kidney excretory patterns similar to those observed during water immersion or the early phase of bed rest, situations that also result in central vascular volume expansion.\r"

The primary mechanical determinant of arterial baroreceptor activity in humans remains unclear. We examined the influence of systolic, diastolic, pulse, and mean arterial pressures on efferent muscle sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA, microneurography) and heart rate responses during perturbation of arterial pressure in 10 normal human subjects [age 25 +/- 2 (SE) yr]. We directly measured arterial pressure, heart rate, and MSNA during intravenous vasodilator infusion (nitroprusside, 6 +/- 1 micrograms.kg-1.min-1, n = 6; or hydralazine, 16 +/- 2 mg, n = 4) while central venous pressure was held constant by simultaneous volume expansion. Changes in arterial pressures were compared with changes in heart rate and MSNA over 3-min periods of vasodilator infusion during which we observed increases in systolic and pulse pressures with simultaneous decreases in mean and diastolic pressures. During vasodilator infusion, there were increases in systolic (124.2 +/- 2.1 to 131.7 +/- 2.9 Torr, P less than 0.001) and pulse pressures (57.0 +/- 2.2 to 72.7 +/- 2.7 Torr, P less than 0.001) although mean arterial pressure fell (88.0 +/- 2.6 to 80.4 +/- 2.7 Torr, P less than 0.001) because of decreases in diastolic pressure (67.2 +/- 3.0 to 59.0 +/- 2.7 Torr, P less than 0.001). The changes in arterial pressures were accompanied by simultaneous increases in heart rate (66.4 +/- 3.0 to 92.6 +/- 4.8 beats/min, P less than 0.001) and MSNA (327 +/- 59 to 936 +/- 171 U, P less than 0.005).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

To determine whether increases in progestin, estrogen, and metabolic rate produced a rise in VE and hypoxic ventilatory response (HVR) similar in magnitude to that observed at full-term pregnancy, we studied 12 postmenopausal women after 1 wk of treatment with placebo, progestin (20 mg tid medroxyprogesterone acetate), estrogen (1.25 mg bid conjugated equine estrogens), and combined progestin and estrogen. Progestin alone or with estrogen raised VE at rest and decreased end-tidal PCO2 (PETCO2) by 3.9 +/- 0.8 and 3.3 +/- 0.6 Torr, respectively (both P less than 0.05), accounting for approximately one-fourth of the rise in VE and three-fourths of the PETCO2 reduction seen at full-term pregnancy. The addition of mild exercise sufficient to raise metabolic rate by 33-36% produced the remaining three-fourths of the rise in VE but no further decline in PETCO2. Combined progestin and estrogen raised HVR and hypercapnic ventilatory response more consistently than progestin alone and could account for one-half of the increase in HVR seen at full-term pregnancy. Mild exercise alone did not raise HVR, but when exercise was combined with progestin and estrogen administration, HVR rose by amounts equal to that seen at full-term pregnancy. We concluded that female hormones together with mild elevation in metabolic rate were likely responsible for the pregnancy-associated increases in VE and HVR.\r"

The hypothesis that the index, body height2 divided by resistance (RI), can accurately predict fat-free body mass (FFB) and percent fat (%FAT) in children was tested on 94 caucasian children 10-14 yr old. Criterion variables were FFB and %FAT estimated using multicomponent equations developed for children. BIA measurements (resistance and reactance) were found to be reliable. Prediction accuracy (standard error of the estimate, SEE) for FFB from RI alone was 2.6 kg and for %FAT from RI and body weight was 4.2%. For RI, anthropometric variables and reactance, the SEE improved to 1.9 kg FFB. For RI and anthropometric variables, the SEE was 3.3% FAT. For anthropometric variables alone, the SEE's were 2.1 kg FFB and 3.2% FAT. Adult FFB and %FAT prediction equations cross-validated with this sample resulted in SEE's similar to those for adult samples. We conclude that RI together with anthropometry is a reliable and an acceptably accurate method of estimating FFB mass and %FAT in children.\r"

Five subjects were tested for a total of nine nights under three conditions in a repeated-measures design. Subjects were confined to bed throughout their usual sleep period but were instructed to go to sleep 0, 3, or 6 h after their usual time for lights out. O2 consumption was measured in all conditions for the 0.5 h before and after each of the times for lights out and then throughout the sleep period after lights out. The results demonstrated that changes in energy expenditure during the sleep period are a function of both sleep and circadian cycle. In this study, the contribution of the two components was approximately equal. However, the effect of sleep was rapid asymptoting within 15 min of sleep onset, whereas that of circadian cycle was constant over the assessment period.\r"

Our objective was to compare the effect of changes in P50, the PO2 at which hemoglobin is 50% saturated, on tissue O2 consumption during severe hypoxemia. A high-affinity (HA) group (n = 9) was perfused with RBC incubated in NaCNO (P50 = 21.4 +/- 1.9 Torr). This was compared with a low-affinity (LA) group (n = 9) perfused with rejuvenated RBC (P50 = 31.1 +/- 1.8 Torr). The arterial PO2 of the perfusate was decreased to approximately 24 Torr in both preparations. Perfusion flow and hemoglobin concentration were maintained constant. During hypoxemia arterial O2 saturation and total O2 transport (TO2) were greater in the HA than the LA group (P less than 0.05). O2 consumption and effluent venous PO2 decreased with hypoxemia in both groups to similar levels. Consequently, the LA group showed a greater O2 extraction ratio than the HA group (P less than 0.05). The ratio of phosphocreatine to inorganic phosphate, measured with 31P magnetic resonance spectroscopy, decreased at a comparable rate in both groups. As shown by a mathematical model of peripheral O2 transport, these experimental results can be explained on the basis of peripheral limitation to O2 diffusion. We conclude that increased hemoglobin affinity does not appreciably improve tissue oxygenation in hypoxemia, since the increase in TO2 is offset by diffusion limitation at the tissues.\r"

In five of these subjects, the measurements from the resected lung were compared with preoperative measurements of the transit times of radiolabeled RBCs with a gamma camera-computer system. Time-activity curves from the cardiac chambers and the lung or its regions were obtained from which transit times were calculated by the centroid and deconvolution techniques. The reproducibility of transit times measured by this technique was assessed in another eight normal subjects, after sequential bolus injections of radiolabeled cells. The mean transit time of the upper lung region was longer (5.1 +/- 0.5 s) than that of the lower (4.1 +/- 0.6 s, P less than 0.05) in the preoperative study. Similarly, the mean transit time of the upper lung slice was longer (5.5 +/- 0.3 s) than that of the lower slice (3.8 +/- 0.3 s, P less than 0.05) in the resected lung specimens. We conclude that there was good agreement between these techniques and that there are long transit times in the upper regions of human lungs.\r"

We looked for a quantitative description of such an effect on HD as a function of both O2 pressure and exposure duration. Ventilation of rats was measured using the barometric method before and after hyperbaric O2 (HBO) exposure, at either air, 80% O2, or 4% O2. We used three exposure durations: 180, 550 and 900 min. The O2 pressure ranged between 1.2 and 3.0 ATA. At each time duration we used four to five groups of rats at a range of O2 pressures that yielded the full scale of effect on HD but avoided obvious lasting difficulties in breathing. HBO caused a reduction of breathing frequency and elevation of tidal volume in both air and 80% O2 but almost no change in minute ventilation. Hypoxic minute ventilation (4% O2) decreased after HBO, mainly through reduced frequency. HD was described by a power function of O2 pressure for each HBO duration. HD did not decline below 20% of the full control response. Ventilatory HD diminution is pictured as a function of both O2 pressure and HBO duration. The dependency of HD on exposure time and on pressure is similar to other known toxic effects of HBO.\r"

Pulmonary function and ventilation were measured under three experimental conditions: after 20 min of rest on land (LR), after 20 min of rest during immersion to the level of the xiphoid (IR), and after 20 min of exercise during immersion at 60% of predicted maximal capacity (IE). Forced vital capacity remained relatively constant, except for a decrease at 15 wk, for the duration of pregnancy. Expiratory reserve volume decreased with a change in the pregnancy status and with the duration of pregnancy. However, the forced vital capacity was maintained by an increase in the inspiratory capacity during pregnancy. Forced expiratory volume for 1 s, expressed as percent of forced vital capacity, did not differ significantly between conditions or as a result of pregnancy. Forced vital capacity was lower during the IR trial compared with LR and IE trials. The decreased forced vital capacity of the IR trials was mediated by a decrease in the expiratory reserve volume. Whereas the inspiratory capacity increased during IR and IE compared with LR, the increase was not large enough to offset the decrease in the expiratory reserve volume. Resting immersion resulted in a significant decrease in maximal voluntary ventilation as did pregnancy. Pregnancy resulted in significant increases in minute ventilation (VE), which were related to increases in the O2 consumption.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

After a progressive rise in afterload, pigs in group I could maintain a higher RV stroke volume than those in group II (1.3 +/- 0.3 vs. 0.4 +/- 0.1 ml; P less than 0.05). At shunt condition, the RVSW was increased by 21 +/- 14% of the initial value in group I vs. a 32 +/- 8% decrease in group II (P less than 0.05). The ductus arteriosus was constricted and right-to-left shunt was observed in all animals at the foramen ovale level even though Ppa exceeded Psa before the rise in the right atrial pressure in group I. Thus, as RV afterload is increased in the pig, the older animals' right ventricle is progressively less capable of maintaining pulmonary blood flow than animals within 24 h of birth.\r"

End-expiratory length did not change significantly in standing but fell by 11.5% for the costal and by 14.4% for the crural segment in sitting, when compared with decubitus position. Tidal shortening of both segments did not change significantly in the three postures. From decubitus to sitting, diaphragmatic electromyogram (EMG) activity increased only in some dogs, not significantly for the group. The inspiratory swing of abdominal pressure was always positive in decubitus and negative in standing and sitting. In the latter two postures, abdominal pressure increased gradually during expiration and fell in inspiration, suggesting a phasic expiratory contraction of abdominal muscles. We conclude that diaphragmatic tidal shortening is maintained in the different postures assumed by the awake dog during resting breathing. It seems that the main compensatory mechanism for changes in diaphragmatic operational length is a phasic expiratory contraction of the abdominal muscles rather than an increase in diaphragmatic EMG activity.\r"

Gating the analysis for the entire inspiratory phase resulted in dual spectral HFOs (27 and 83 Hz), both of which persisted when the analysis was repeated on the later phase of phrenic inspiratory activity alone (29 and 82 Hz). A third pass at the same data, gating for just the early phase of phrenic discharge, however, resulted in single spectral HFOs at the higher frequency only (86 Hz). Because both early and late recruited phrenic motoneurons carry both higher and lower spectral frequencies, these results demonstrate that the lower frequency HFO is distinctly delayed in onset compared with the higher frequency HFO, the latter of which is believed to have a brain stem origin. This delayed onset may be important in identifying the source of the lower frequency HFO, which appears to be specific to various respiratory efferent systems.\r"

Respective mean arterial O2 saturation values (ear lobe oximetry) were 98 +/- 1, 91 +/- 4 (P less than or equal to 0.01), and 99 +/- 1% (NS). Maximal mouth pressure (Pm) was measured during inspirations at rest and during a 10-min fatigue trial, and the Pm measurements obtained during the fatigue trials were fit to an exponential equation. The parameters of the equation included the time constant (tau), which describes the rate of decay of Pm from the initial pressure (Pi) to the asymptote, or \"sustainable\" pressure (Ps). The mean fraction of Pm remaining at the end of the fatigue trials (Ps/Pi) was 63 +/- 5%. No significant differences in Pi, Ps, or tau were observed between O2 treatments. This suggests that fatigue of the inspiratory muscles in normal humans occurs by a mechanism that is insensitive to changes in blood O2 content that occur during inspiration of O2 in the range of 13-100%.\r"

We studied P1 and P2 receptor signal transduction in type II pneumocytes. The EC50 for ATP on PC exocytosis was 10(-6) M, whereas the EC50 for ADP, AMP, adenosine, and the nonmetabolizable ATP analogue alpha,beta-methylene ATP was 10(-4) M. The rank order of agonists for PC exocytosis was ATP greater than ADP greater than AMP greater than adenosine greater than alpha,beta-methylene ATP. The rank order of agonists for phosphatidylinositol (PI) hydrolysis was ATP greater than ADP, whereas AMP, adenosine, and alpha,beta-methylene ATP did not stimulate PI hydrolysis. ATP (10(-4) M) caused a 15-fold increase in adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (cAMP) production, and the nonmetabolizable adenosine analogue 5'-N-ethylcarboxyamidoadenosine (10(-6) M) increased cAMP production threefold. The effects of both these agonists on cAMP production were completely inhibited by the adenosine antagonist 8-phenyltheophylline (10(-5) M). The effects of ATP (10(-4) M) on PC exocytosis were inhibited 38% by 10(-5) M 8-phenyltheophylline. Thus, ATP regulates PC exocytosis by activating P2 receptors, which stimulate PI hydrolysis to inositol phosphate, as well as by activating P1 receptors, which stimulate cAMP production. Interactions between the P1 and P2 pathways may explain the high potency of extracellular ATP as an agonist of PC exocytosis.\r"

  ".W": "The hypothesis that fluid reabsorption from the air spaces is mediated at least in part by active transport of Na+ was investigated in six sets of experiments conducted in isolated fluid-filled rat lungs. Fluid reabsorption was monitored by following the changes in the air space concentration of labeled albumin. We found that incorporation of bicarbonate rather than a nonvolatile buffer (N-2-hydroxy-ethylpiperazine-N'-2-ethanesulfonic acid) in the air space solution more than doubled the rate of fluid reabsorption. Addition of 10(-4) M amiloride to the air space solution reduced the rate of fluid reabsorption over a 2-h experiment from 1.2 +/- 0.1 to 0.7 +/- 0.1 ml and decreased reabsorption of both labeled and unlabeled Na+ from the air spaces. To show that Na+ could be reabsorbed from the air spaces even if the concentrations of Na+ in the perfusate increased above those in the air space, mannitol (150 mM) was added to the perfusate and air space solutions and the concentrations of Na+ and Cl- were reduced to 90 and 60 mM, respectively. Mannitol diffuses across the pulmonary epithelium very slowly, and it osmotically restrained the movement of water out of the air spaces. Na+ concentrations in the perfusate increased by 10 +/- 2 mM, but concentrations in the air space remained unchanged. Despite an increasingly unfavorable concentration gradient for Na+, 0.2 mmol Na+ and 0.6 ml water were reabsorbed from the air spaces in 2 h. Ouabain (10(-4) M) did not appear to slow fluid reabsorption in the presence of mannitol, but it reduced K+ secretion into the air spaces and increased K+ appearance in the perfusate in a manner consistent with inhibition of Na+-K+-adenosinetriphosphatase at the basolateral surface of the epithelial cells. Fluid reabsorption was not altered when the lungs were exposed to a hypotonic solution (185 mM), but secretion of K+ into the air spaces was accelerated and K+ was lost from the perfusate. These experiments are consistent with active Na+ transport from the air spaces.\r"

Unanesthetized, chronically catheterized guinea pigs increased mean pulmonary arterial pressure (PAP) from 11 +/- 0.5 to 13 +/- 0.7 Torr in acute hypoxia (10% O2 for 65 min). The response was maximal at 5 min, remained stable for 1 h, and was reversible on return to room air. Cardiac index did not change with acute hypoxia or recovery. Guinea pigs exposed to chronic hypoxia increased PAP, measured in room air 1 h after removal from the hypoxic chamber, to 18 +/- 1 Torr by 5 days with little further increase in PAP to 20 +/- 1 Torr after 21 days. Cardiac index fell from 273 +/- 12 to 206 +/- 7 ml.kg-1.min-1 (P less than 0.05) after 21 days of hypoxia. Medial thickness of pulmonary arteries adjacent to terminal bronchioles and alveolar ducts increased significantly by 10 days. The magnitude of the pulmonary vasoconstriction to acute hypoxia persisted and was unabated during the development and apparent stabilization of chronic hypoxic pulmonary hypertension, suggesting that if vasoconstriction is the stimulus for remodeling, then the importance of the stimulus lessens with duration of hypoxia. In individual animals followed serially, we found no correlation between the magnitude of the acute vasoconstrictor response before chronic hypoxia and the severity of chronic pulmonary hypertension that subsequently developed either because the initial response was small and variable or because vasoconstriction may not be the sole stimulus for vascular remodeling in the guinea pig.\r"

Twenty-eight of the male subjects were smokers. After the subjects were familiarized with the experimental procedure, respiratory muscle strength, inspiratory muscle endurance, and spirometric function, including forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1), FEV1/FVC, tidal volume, breathing rate, and duty cycle, were measured. The respiratory muscle strength was indicated by the maximal static inspiratory and expiratory pressures (PImmax and PEmmax). Inspiratory muscle endurance was determined by the time the subject was able to sustain breathing against an inspiratory pressure load on a modified Nickerson-Keens device. The results showed that 1) except for inspiratory muscle endurance and FEV1/FVC, men had greater respiratory muscle and pulmonary functions than women, 2) respiratory muscle function and pulmonary function decreased with age, 3) smoking tended to lower duty cycle and FEV1/FVC and to enhance PE,mmax, and 4) inspiratory muscle endurance was greater in men who were physically active than in those who were sedentary. Therefore we conclude that there are sexual and age differences in respiratory muscle strength and pulmonary function and that smoking or physical activity may affect respiratory muscle function.\r"

Cardiac output was determined using acetylene rebreathing at 30, 50, 70, and 85% VO2max. Maximal cardiac output was estimated using submaximal stroke volume and maximal heart rate. VO2max was 36% lower in master runners (45.0 +/- 6.9 vs. 70.4 +/- 8.0 ml.kg-1.min-1, P less than or equal to 0.05), because of both a lower maximal cardiac output (18.2 +/- 3.5 vs. 25.4 +/- 1.7 l.min-1) and arteriovenous O2 difference (16.6 +/- 1.6 vs. 18.7 +/- 1.4 ml O2.100 ml blood-1, P less than or equal to 0.05).

The dose of SP required to decrease pulmonary conductance to 50% of its base-line value (ED50GL) decreased 2.8-fold (P less than 0.002) and 3.3-fold (P less than 0.001) on the second and third dose-response curves, respectively, compared with the first. SP did not alter airway responses to intravenous histamine but did cause a significant (3.7-fold) decrease in ED50GL for dose-response curves to intravenous capsaicin, an agent that causes bronchoconstriction by release of endogenous tachykinins. The neutral metalloendopeptidase inhibitor thiorphan (0.5 mg) and the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor captopril (1.7 mg) both caused a marked enhancement of airway responses to SP observed on the first dose-response curve but did not alter the enhancement of SP-induced airway responses produced by repeated SP challenge. The anticholinergic atropine (5 mg/kg iv), the antihistamine mepyramine (8 mg/kg iv), and the cyclooxygenase inhibitor indomethacin (30 mg/kg ip) had no effect on the first SP dose-response curve. Atropine and mepyramine did not prevent the enhancement of SP responses observed with repeated challenge, but after pretreatment with either indomethacin or acetylsalicylic acid, dose-response curves to SP were reproducible. Our results indicate that airway responses to intravenous SP are enhanced with repeated SP challenge and suggest that cyclooxygenase products of arachidonic acid metabolism are involved in the mediation of this phenomenon.\r"

These plots revealed both tidal hysteresis and a change in slope as a function of distance along the airway. The slope of the regression line of the dA/dP plots decreased from the pharyngeal region to the trachea and became 0 at the thoracic inlet, the location of which was independently assessed. In most subjects the slope became negative distal to the thoracic inlet. Correlation coefficients between pressure and area approached 1 in the pharyngeal region and 0 at the thoracic inlet. When subjects breathed against a small resistive load (10 cmH2O.1(-1).s) pharyngeal, extrathoracic, and intrathoracic pressure-area plots were exaggerated but the slope at the thoracic inlet was unchanged. We conclude that this pressure-area characteristic defines regional differences in upper airway elasticity and delineates the transition point between the intra- and extrathoracic airways.\r"

The diaphragm was paced at a rate of 12/min by bilateral phrenic nerve stimulation. Left phrenic (Qphr-T) and left internal mammary (Qim-T) arterial flows were measured by electromagnetic flow probes. Changes in Pdi and duty cycle were achieved by changing the stimulation frequencies and the duration of contraction, whereas Part changes were produced by bleeding. With N and at a duty cycle of 0.5, incremental increases in Pdi produced peaks in Qphr-T and Qim-T at 30% maximum diaphragmatic pressure (Pdimax) with a gradual decline at higher Pdi. With MH and SH, blood flow peaked at 10% Pdimax. At any given Pdi, blood flow was lower with MH and SH in comparison to N. The effect of duty cycle was tested at two levels of Pdi. With N and at low Pdi (25% Pdimax), blood flow rose progressively with increases in duty cycle, whereas at moderate Pdi level (50% Pdimax) blood flow peaked at a duty cycle of 0.3, with no increase thereafter. With MH, blood flow at low Pdi rose linearly with increasing duty cycle but to a lesser extent than with N, and at a moderate Pdi flow peaked at a duty cycle of 0.3. With SH, blood flow at low and moderate Pdi was limited at duty cycles greater than 0.3 and 0.1, respectively.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

When not firing, the membrane potential trajectories of each cell type revealed two complementary patterns of relative inhibition. This latter finding suggests arrival of inhibitory synaptic potentials during these periods. These findings suggest that the respiratory control mechanisms of the newborn piglet are organized in a three-phased manner similar to that of adult cats.\r"

The basic principles were confirmed in the model, but it was found that when occlusion was caused over a relatively wide distance or in a predistended vessel, capillary pressure was overrated. This problem was due to volume backflow from the occlusion site, since it could be eliminated by placing a one-way valve upstream from the occlusion site. Upstream from the valve, the venous pressure transient accurately followed capillary pressure. Downstream, however, the reading of capillary pressure was impaired by the backflow volume squeezed between valve and occlusion clamp, which caused an immediate large pressure elevation. We also tested the method recently advanced to estimate capillary pressure in humans from venous pressure curves obtained after rapid venous occlusion with an air-filled compression cuff. With the cuff around the upper arm, venous pressure was recorded at different levels along the forearm. The tracings obtained from the dorsum of the hand and halfway along the forearm did not show the initial rapid upstrokes that might indicate the capillary pressure. Tracings obtained slightly below or above the cubital fossa were similar to those seen downstream from the one-way valve in the model. Extrapolation to zero-time, using the distally recorded curves as a template, yielded values equal to venous pressure. We conclude that although the problem of backflow can be circumvented by pressure recording distal from venous valves, the method of venous occlusion by a circular upper-arm cuff may not be appropriate to estimate capillary pressure in humans.\r"

The preparation of GSH-MEE used contained 91% GSH-MEE, approximately 9% GSH diethyl ester (GSH-DEE) and a trace amount of GSH. Both GSH and GSH-MEE markedly stimulated the intracellular concentrations of GSH in endothelial cells. GSH-MEE was more potent than GSH. The enhancement of endothelial GSH concentration by exogenous GSH was completely inhibited by buthionine sulfoximine (BSO), a potent inhibitor of gamma-glutamylcysteine synthase, or acivicin (AT-125), an inhibitor of gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase, suggesting that it was due to the extracellular breakdown and subsequent intracellular resynthesis of GSH. In contrast, the effect of GSH-MEE was largely resistant to BSO and acivicin, suggesting that it was primarily due to transport of GSH-MEE followed by intracellular hydrolysis. The GSH-MEE preparation, which contained 9% GSH-DEE, at concentrations of 2 mM or higher caused vacuolization of endothelial cells. The enhancement of GSH concentrations by exogenous GSH, but not by GSH-MEE, protected endothelial cells against H2O2-induced injury.\r"

  ".W": "To study the effect of adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (cAMP) on respiratory ciliary activity, we measured ciliary beat frequency (CBF) of rabbit tracheal epithelium by a photoelectric method in response to cAMP analogues and agents that can increase endogenous cAMP production. Addition of 8-bromo-cAMP dose dependently enhanced CBF, with the maximal increase and the concentration necessary to produce a half-maximal response (KD) being 31.0 +/- 3.4% (SE) (P less than 0.001) and 3.2 +/- 1.5 x 10(-7) M, respectively. Other structurally dissimilar cAMP analogues dibutyryl cAMP and chlorophenylthio-cAMP likewise caused increases in CBF. The phosphodiesterase inhibitor 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine and the adenylate cyclase stimulator forskolin also augmented CBF in a dose-dependent fashion and were accompanied by the increases in intracellular concentrations of cAMP. Ciliary discoordination was not observed in any of the experiments. These results suggest that cAMP may accelerate mucociliary clearance through the activation of ciliary motility and that intracellular cAMP levels appear to be an important determinant for the lung mucociliary transport functions.\r"

In contrast, methylene blue markedly potentiated hypoxic vasopressor response (4-fold) when injected before or during the alveolar hypoxic stimulation. Hemoglobin also potentiated the hypoxic pressor response. Similarly, methylene blue or aspirin augmented the pressor responses to angiotensin II (0.1-1 microgram). The increased hypoxic response induced by methylene blue was immediate and sustained. Methylene blue, when added during hypoxia in the presence of aspirin, further augmented the response to hypoxia compared with the enhanced hypoxic response observed with aspirin alone. Our results suggest that, in addition to the role of cyclooxygenase products, the pulmonary vascular bed may be regulated by endothelium-dependent factors that can be antagonized directly or indirectly by methylene blue.\r"

Body cooling from 40 to 32 degrees C augmented the bronchomotor responses to histamine, which eventually rose almost fourfold. The enhancement of histamine-induced bronchoconstriction induced by body cooling was not suppressed by pretreating guinea pigs with 5 mg/kg hexamethonium or 5 mg/kg hexamethonium plus 3 mg/kg atropine; neither was the enhancement of histamine-induced bronchoconstriction suppressed in pithed guinea pigs, demonstrating that the autonomic nervous system is not involved in potentiating bronchoconstriction at low body temperatures. These results suggest that, at low body temperatures, increased airway responsiveness to histamine may be because of some direct effect of temperature on bronchial airway smooth muscle.\r"

In doing so we showed that LPS induces a slight but significant (P less than 0.01) bronchial obstruction (measured as forced expiratory volume in 1 s) in asthmatics (n = 8) but not in normal subjects (n = 6). The histamine hyperresponsiveness, expressed as the dosage of histamine necessary to decrease the bronchial specific conductance by 50%, was increased 5 h after LPS inhalation in asthmatics (P less than 0.05) but not in normal subjects. This effect of LPS on bronchial obstruction and hyperresponsiveness was observed in extrinsic (n = 6) as well as in intrinsic (n = 2) asthma.\r"

The present study was conducted to determine if alveolar macrophages and type II cells (which are relatively resistant to oxidant injury) possess a specialized transport system for the accumulation of taurine. The results indicate that both cell types contain more taurine than plasma or whole lung. Taurine influx exhibited both carrier-mediated and simple diffusion components. Carrier-mediated uptake displayed saturation kinetics (Km = 26.3 and 22.5 microM, while Vmax = 33.2 and 4.9 pmol.10(6) cells-1.min-1 for macrophages and type II cells, respectively). Taurine uptake was dependent on extracellular sodium and inhibited by metabolic inhibitors or ouabain. Total taurine uptake by type II cells was lower than that of alveolar macrophages. However, type II cells exhibited a higher intercellular concentration of taurine (14 vs. 4 mM) because of a higher ratio of carrier-mediated uptake to leakage than with alveolar macrophages. It is possible that this specialized transport system for taurine uptake may lend these cells resistant to oxidant injury.\r"

The objective of the present investigation was to determine levels of total muscle RNA and the content and composition of the mRNA fraction as a qualitative assessment of the potential regulatory role of transcriptional alterations in unloaded skeletal muscles. Hindlimb muscle unloading was produced by whole-body suspension of rats for up to 7 days. The soleus, gastrocnemius, and extensor digitorum longus (EDL) were excised from 1-, 3-, and 7-day suspended and pair-fed controls, and RNA was extracted by homogenization in 5 M guanidinium thiocyanate. Total RNA and mRNA contents were lower in soleus and gastrocnemius after 7 days of suspension compared with pair-fed controls, but total RNA and mRNA concentrations (per g muscle and per microgram total RNA, respectively) were unaltered. alpha-Actin mRNA, assessed by dot blot hybridization, was significantly reduced in soleus after 1 (37%), 3 (28%), and 7 (59%) days of suspension and in gastrocnemius after 3 (44%) and 7 (41%) days. However, alpha-actin mRNA was unchanged in the EDL after suspension. Protein synthesis directed by RNA extracted from soleus and EDL indicated marked (30-400%) alterations in mRNAs coding for several small (15- to 25-kDa) proteins. The results of this study suggest that altered transcription and availability of specific mRNAs could contribute significantly to the regulation of protein synthesis during unloading of skeletal muscle.\r"

Immediately after the exercise, plasma free fatty acids (FFA) had increased from a resting value of 0.44 +/- 0.04 to 0.84 +/- 0.04 mM. Heart TG concentration was reduced 75%, whereas the glycogen level was decreased 34% below control. TG lipase activity was elevated 33% above control activity. One hour after the end of the exercise, lipolytic activity was still 26% above control and did not return to the resting level until the 4th h of recovery. The cardiac TG concentration was back to control levels by the 2nd h after the swim. Plasma FFA concentrations remained elevated during the first 4 h of recovery and were back to the control level by h 8. Cardiac glycogen was \"supercompensated\" during recovery h 1 and 2 and returned to the preexercise level by h 4. These data indicate that TG is being synthesized in the heart while lipolytic enzyme activity is elevated above control levels. This points out that the rate of TG synthesis is in excess of the hydrolysis. Since plasma FFA concentrations are elevated during periods of augmented TG synthesis, substrate availability, namely plasma FFA, may play a key role in regulating the size of the intracellular TG pool.\r"

The work rate was increased at either 8, 15, or 50 W/min. The continuous model for [La-] = a + b exp(cVO2) was compared statistically with a previously proposed log-log transformation model for the [La-] and VO2 variables. It was found that the mean square error was significantly less for the continuous as opposed to the log-log model (P less than 0.01) by analysis of variance pooled across all three ramp slopes. The mean square errors from the individual ramp slopes were also significantly less for the continuous model by paired t test (P less than 0.05). It was observed that the major contributor to the increased error of the log-log model was at VO2's at or above the intersection point (lactate threshold) of the two linear log-transformed segments. The log-log transformation does not appear to relate to any physiological process. The lactate slope index, taken as the point where the slope of the relationship between [La-] and VO2 (i.e., d[La-]/dVO2) equaled 1, occurred at a mean VO2 of 2.25 and 2.37 l/min for the 15- and 8-W/min ramp slopes, respectively, but at 2.76 l/min for the 50-W/min ramp (P less than 0.05). It is concluded that [La-] increases as a continuous function with respect to VO2 across a wide range of ramp work rate slopes.\r"

We used a recently described device (J. Appl. Physiol. 62: 2491-2499, 1987) to make mouth pressure during inspiration positive and proportional to inspiratory flow, thus causing inspiratory resistive unloading (IRUL); the magnitude of IRUL (delta R = -3.0 cmH2O.1(-1).s) was set so as to unload most (approximately 86% of the normal inspiratory resistance. Six conscious normal humans were studied. Driving pressure (DP) was calculated according to the method of Younes et al. (J. Appl. Physiol. 51: 963-1001, 1981), which provides the equivalent of occlusion pressure at functional residual capacity throughout the breath. IRUL resulted in small but significant changes in minute ventilation (0.6 1/min) and in end-tidal CO2 concentration (-0.11%) with no significant change in tidal volume or respiratory frequency. There was a significant shortening of the duration (neural inspiratory time) of the rising phase of the DP waveform and the shape of the rising phase became more convex to the time axis. There was no change in the average rate of rise of DP or in the duration or shape of the declining phase. We conclude that 1) the normal inspiratory resistance is an important determinant of the duration and shape of the rising phase of DP and 2) the neural responses elicited by the normal inspiratory resistance are similar to those observed with added inspiratory resistive loads.\r"

Bronchoalveolar lavage was performed in three dogs in each group before, during, and after pretreatment. Base-line airway resistance and dynamic compliance did not change with treatment in any of the groups. Placebo treatment had no demonstrable effect on methacholine and citric acid responsiveness. Methylprednisolone treatment abolished the constrictor response to citric acid during the 4th and 6th wk of treatment and significantly reduced methacholine responsiveness during the 3rd and 5th wk of treatment. Methylprednisolone treatment was associated with a marked reduction in the percent of eosinophils, but not mast cells, in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid during the 7th wk. Blood eosinophil counts were also markedly reduced in the methylprednisolone-treated group compared with the placebo-treated group during the 7th wk. The decrease in numbers of eosinophils in blood and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid suggests interference with the inflammatory process as a possible mechanism for the observed reduction in airway hyperresponsiveness in the Basenji-Greyhound dog.\r"

The present study was designed to investigate whether it is also a sufficient condition. To do so we studied the effects of varying expiratory effort on generation of FEW. Six normal subjects exhaled with varying force into an orifice in line with a high-impedance suction pump. Esophageal (Pes), airway opening, and transpulmonary (Ptp) pressures were measured alongside flow rate, lung volume, and tracheal lung sounds. In each subject a certain critical degree of effort had to be attained before FEW were generated. This effort, measured as Pes at the onset of wheezes, varied among the subjects (range -11 to 45 cmH2O). Similarly, a minimal Ptp had to be reached for FEW to evolve (mean +/- SD -34 +/- 12 cmH2O, range -18 to -50 cmH2O). These critical Pes and Ptp values were significantly higher than those required for FL. It was concluded that, in addition to the requirement for FL, sufficient levels of effort and negative Ptp must exist before FEW can be generated. By analogy to experimental and theoretical results from studies on flow-induced oscillations in self-supporting collapsible tubes, it was further concluded that these pressures are required to induce flattening of the intrathoracic airways downstream from the choke point. It is this configurational change that causes air speed to become equal to or exceed the critical gas velocity needed to induce oscillations in soft-walled tubes.\r"

Both hindlimb muscles received the same number of stimuli in a day, making the average stimulation frequency 10 Hz. Two periods of daily stimulation were studied, 8 and 24 h/day. Muscles stimulated at 30 Hz produced greater overall tetanic tension and, during a prolonged stimulation test, exerted a greater mean tension than muscles stimulated at 10 Hz (50 and 32% increase for animals stimulated for 8 and 24 h/day, respectively). Muscle mass was least reduced and fewer pathological abnormalities were observed in the muscles stimulated at 30 Hz. There were no apparent differences in the histochemistry or biochemistry between muscles stimulated at 10 and 30 Hz, which could account for these differences in muscle properties. These results indicate the 30-Hz paradigm may be better suited than 10 Hz continuous stimulation for applications requiring sustained muscle tension such as correction of scoliosis or muscle conditioning for motor prostheses.\r"

Some previous studies suggest the relationship between the blunted hypoxic ventilatory response (HVR) and HAPE. To examine whether all the HAPE-susceptible subjects consistently show blunted HVR at low altitude, we evaluated the conventional pulmonary function test, hypoxic ventilatory response (HVR), and hypercapnic ventilatory response (HCVR) in ten lowlanders who had a previous history of HAPE and compared these results with those of eight control lowlanders who had no history of HAPE. HVR was measured by the progressive isocapnic hypoxic method and was evaluated by the slope relating minute ventilation to arterial O2 saturation (delta VE/delta SaO2). HCVR was measured by the rebreathing method of Read. All measurements were done at Matsumoto, Japan (610 m). All the HAPE-susceptible subjects showed normal values in the pulmonary function test. In HCVR, HAPE-susceptible subjects showed relatively lower S value, but there was no significant difference between the two groups (1.74 +/- 1.16 vs. 2.19 +/- 0.4, P = NS). On the other hand, HAPE-susceptible subjects showed significantly lower HVR than control subjects (-0.42 +/- 0.23 vs. -0.87 +/- 0.29, P less than 0.01). These results suggest that HAPE-susceptible subjects more frequently show low HVR at low altitude. However, values for HVR were within the normal range in 2 of 10 HAPE-susceptible subjects. It would seem therefore that low HVR alone need not be a critical factor for HAPE. This could be one of several contributing factors.\r"

We studied the various responses with respect to frequency of occurrence, effect of increased stimulus intensity, and relation of stimulus fluid to laryngeal structures. Two groups of infants were studied: healthy full-term infants (n = 5) and preterm infants with a history of prolonged apnea (n = 9). We used a nasopharyngeal catheter to deliver small boluses of warm saline (0.02-0.35 ml) to the oropharynx. Responses repeatedly observed in both infant groups included swallows, obstructed respiratory efforts, brief apnea, prolonged apnea, and cough. In both infant groups, swallows and obstructed breaths occurred frequently and cough and prolonged apnea infrequently. The functional significance of some response patterns was clear, whereas that of others was obscure. Larger stimulus volumes yielded more frequent responses (P less than 0.01), and preterm infants responded much more frequently than full-term infants (P less than 0.01). Prolonged apnea was a composite of the other responses and was much more common in preterm than full-term infants (P less than 0.01). The stimulus technique was performed under direct visualization of the airway in two deceased infants. The findings suggested that the relation of the piriform fossae to the interarytenoid notch is important in determining response frequency. Implications for regulation of the removal of upper airway secretions during sleep are discussed.\r"

  ".W": "To study effects of cigarette smoke on the cytoplasmic motility (CM) of alveolar macrophages (AM), we measured remanent field strength (RFS) in dogs in vivo. Four days after instillation of ferrimagnetic particles (Fe3O4, 3 mg/kg) into the right lower lobe bronchus, RFS was measured at the body surface immediately after magnetization of the Fe3O4 particles by an externally applied magnetic field. RFS decreased with time due to particle rotation (relaxation), which is thought to be inversely related to CM of AM (J. Appl. Physiol. 55: 1196-1202, 1983). The initial relaxation curve was fitted to an exponential function. The relaxation rate (lambda 0) increased during cigarette smoke inhalation and returned to base-line values within 15 min. With the inhalation of the smoke of up to five cigarettes, peak lambda 0 was increased; with a further increase in the number of cigarettes, the effect of cigarette smoke decreased or disappeared. Nicotine injection and acetylcholine inhalation increased respiratory resistance to a degree similar to that observed with cigarette smoke but did not change lambda 0. However, either substance P (SP) or capsaicin injection increased lambda 0 in a fashion similar to that noted with cigarette smoke inhalation. Repeated administration of SP produced a significant tachyphylaxis of the effect, and capsaicin did not increase lambda 0 after the cigarette smoke-induced tachyphylaxis of the effect. Colchicine inhibited the cigarette smoke-induced increase in lambda 0. These results suggest that cigarette smoke increases CM of AM, probably through the release of tachykinins including SP from sensory nerves in the lung.\r"

A high-speed X-ray scanner (dynamic spatial reconstructor) provided three-dimensional images of the thorax during spontaneous breathing and during mechanical ventilation with paralysis. Tidal volume (VT) was measured by integrating gas flow. Changes in thoracic liquid volume (delta Vliq, presumably caused by changes in thoracic blood volume) were calculated as delta Vth - VT. Absolute volume displaced by the rib cage was not significantly different during the two modes of ventilation. During spontaneous breathing, thoracic blood volume increased during inspiration; delta Vliq was 12.3 +/- 4.1% of delta Vth. During mechanical ventilation, delta Vliq was nearly zero. Configuration of the relaxed chest wall was similar during muscular relaxation induced by either pharmacological paralysis or hyperventilation. Expiratory muscle activity produced 50 +/- 11% of the delta Vth during spontaneous breathing. We conclude that at constant VT the volume displaced by the rib cage is remarkably similar during the transition from spontaneous breathing to mechanical ventilation, while both diaphragmatic volume displacement and changes in intrathoracic blood volume decrease by a similar amount.\r"

To investigate mechanisms responsible for changes in RL, the relative contribution of airway resistance (Raw) and tissue resistance (Rti) to RL at similar breathing frequencies and tidal volumes was studied in six excised, exsanguinated canine left lungs. Lung volume was sinusoidally varied, with tidal volumes of 10, 20, and 40% of vital capacity. Pressures were measured at three alveolar sites (PA) with alveolar capsules and at the airway opening (Pao). Measurements were made during oscillation at five frequencies between 5 and 45 min-1 at each tidal volume. Resistances were calculated by assuming a linear equation of motion and submitting lung volume, flow, Pao, and PA to a multiple linear regression. RL decreased with increasing frequency and decreased with increasing tidal volume in both isolated and intact lungs. In isolated lungs, Rti decreased with increasing frequency but was independent of tidal volume. Raw was independent of frequency but decreased with tidal volume. The contribution of Rti to RL ranged from 93 +/- 4% (SD) with low frequency and large tidal volume to 41 +/- 24% at high frequency and small tidal volume. We conclude that the RL is highly dependent on breathing frequency and less dependent on tidal volume during conditions similar to quiet breathing and that these findings are explained by changes in the relative contributions of Raw and Rti to RL.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of changing tidal volume (VT) and frequency (f) on the distribution of ventilation during high-frequency ventilation (HFV) were assessed from the washout of nitrogen-13 by positron emission tomography. Six dogs, anesthetized and paralyzed, were studied in the supine position during conventional ventilation (CV) and during HFV at f of 3, 6, and 9 Hz. In CV and HFV at 6 Hz, VT was selected to achieve eucapnic arterial partial pressure of CO2 (37 +/- 3 Torr). At 3 and 9 Hz, VT was proportionally changed so that the product of VT and f remained constant and equal to that at 6 Hz. Mean residence time (MRT) of nitrogen-13 during washout was calculated for apical, midheart, and basal transverse sections of the lung and further analyzed for gravity-dependent, cephalocaudal and radial gradients. An index of local alveolar ventilation per unit of lung volume, or specific ventilation (spV), was calculated as the reciprocal of MRT. During CV vertical gradients of regional spV were seen in all sections with ventral (nondependent) regions less ventilated than dorsal (dependent) regions. Regional nonuniformity in gas transport was greatest for HFV at 3 and 6 Hz and lowest at 9 Hz and during CV. During HFV, a central region at the base of the lungs was preferentially ventilated, resulting in a regional time-averaged tracer concentration equivalent to that of the main bronchi. Because the main bronchi were certainly receiving fresh gas, the presence of this preferentially ventilated area, whose ventilation increased with VT, strongly supports the hypothesis that direct convection of fresh gas is an important mechanism of gas transport during eucapnic HFV. Aside from the local effect of increasing overall lung ventilation, this central area probably served as an intermediate shuttle station for the transport of gas between mouth and deeper alveoli when VT was less than the anatomic dead space.\r"

The hypothesis predicts, because of differences in the capillary PO2 profile, that the former condition will result in both a higher VO2max and muscle effluent venous PO2 (PVO2). We studied the relations among VO2max, PVO2, and O2 delivery during maximal isometric contractions in isolated, in situ dog gastrocnemius muscle (n = 6) during these two conditions. O2 delivery was matched by varying arterial O2 partial pressure and adjusting flow to the muscle accordingly. A total of 18 matched O2 delivery pairs were obtained. As planned, O2 delivery was not significantly different between the two treatments. In contrast, VO2max was significantly higher [10.4 +/- 0.5 (SE) ml.100 g-1.min-1; P = 0.01], as was PVO2 (25 +/- 1 Torr; P less than 0.01) in the low flow-high CaO2 treatment compared with the high flow-low CaO2 treatment (9.1 +/- 0.4 ml.100 g-1.min-1 and 20 +/- 1 Torr, respectively). The rate of fatigue was greater in the high flow-low CaO2 condition, as was lactate output from the muscle and muscle lactate concentration. The results of this study show that VO2max is not uniquely dependent on O2 delivery and support the hypothesis that VO2max can be limited by peripheral tissue O2 diffusion.\r"

In series I, during normothermia, systemic intravenous phenylephrine infusion increased mean arterial pressure (MAP) by 61.0 +/- 3.6 mmHg and induced a reflex decrease in tail perfusion pressure (TPP) from 105.0 +/- 6.3 to 84.2 +/- 4.4 mmHg (P less than 0.005). Hyperthermia decreased TPP to 66.5 +/- 5.1 mmHg (P less than 0.001) and abolished the TPP response to increased MAP (P greater than 0.05). Increases in MAP via systemic infusion of whole blood caused reductions in TPP during normothermia but failed to reduce TPP further during hyperthermia. Graded decreases in MAP during both normothermia and hyperthermia caused tail vasoconstriction. The increase in TPP was greater (P less than 0.025) during hyperthermia. In series II, conscious animals showed similar responses to hemorrhage. Graded decreases in MAP produced graded decreases in tail vascular conductance (TVC, ml.100 ml-1.min-1.100 mmHg-1). The slope of the TVC-MAP relationship averaged 0.011 +/- 0.003 TVC U/mmHg during normothermia and was markedly steeper (P less than 0.01) during hyperthermia (1.99 +/- 0.39 TVC U/mmHg). Thus the participation of the cutaneous vasculature of the rat in baroreceptor reflexes depends on thermal status, probably through the level of background sympathetic vasoconstrictor nerve activity.\r"

To determine whether the lung is the source of increased ethane production during exposure to 100% O2, we measured ethane in the expirate of nine exsanguinated, Sprague-Dawley rats (group II) mechanically ventilated with HFA and then with 100% O2. In all nine animals, ethane elimination rates on 100% O2 increased compared with HFA values. In five of the nine rats, HFA ventilation was reinstated after O2 (group III). In all five, ethane elimination fell with HFA ventilation compared with the value on 100%. Six rats with circulation intact were ventilated with HFA and then 100% O2 (group IV). Ethane production rate for group IV animals breathing HFA was not significantly different from the exsanguinated animals in group II while ventilated with HFA. The mean increase in ethane production for the group II animals was not significantly different from the group IV animals. Lung slices from four other rats (group V) were incubated in saline at 37 degrees C with FeCl2 (10 mg) added to enhance free radical formation. Paired lung samples from the same rat were incubated with either HFA or 100% O2. Headspace gas was analyzed chromatographically for ethane at 120 min. Mean ethane in the O2 samples was higher than for HFA. Rat lung tissue is the main source of increased ethane production during 100% O2 exposure.\r"

  ".W": "Radiation pneumonitis is a life-threatening result of therapeutic thoracic irradiation, yet its mechanisms are poorly understood. We studied the effects of unilateral lung irradiation (3,000 rad) in sheep from the immediate response to the later development of radiation pneumonitis. We defined radiation pneumonitis by its diagnostic clinical feature, radiographic infiltration of the irradiated zone with a straight margin corresponding to the radiation port. The immediate response in the few hours after irradiation was characterized by cough, labored respiration, hypoxemia (arterial PO2 decreased 19 Torr), mild pulmonary hypertension (pulmonary arterial pressure increased 20%), and lymphopenia. Hemodynamics and gas exchange returned to normal by day 2 but became abnormal again before or during radiation pneumonitis at 32 +/- 2 days. Respiratory distress, hypoxemia, and pulmonary hypertension recurred during radiation pneumonitis. Bronchoalveolar lavage during radiation pneumonitis contained increased neutrophils (19 +/- 4%, control = 7%), increased protein (0.27 +/- 0.1 g/dl, control = 0.12 +/- 0.03), and severely impaired ability to lower surface tension. Alveolar macrophages from both lungs during unilateral radiation pneumonitis exhibited impaired generation of superoxide after phorbol myristate (only a 30% increase). Normal control alveolar macrophages increased superoxide production after stimulation greater than 400%. We conclude that unilateral lung irradiation in sheep causes a mild immediate response followed by radiation pneumonitis at 1 mo. Unilateral radiation pneumonitis in this model is associated with ipsilateral neutrophilic alveolitis, increased bronchoalveolar lavage protein, and impaired surfactant function, as well as bilateral functional abnormalities of alveolar macrophages.\r"

  ".W": "Perfusion of isolated sheep lungs with blood causes spontaneous edema and hypertension preceded by decreases in perfusate concentrations of leukocytes (WBC) and platelets (PLT). To determine whether these decreases were caused by pulmonary sequestration, we continuously measured blood flow and collected pulmonary arterial and left atrial blood for cell concentration measurements in six lungs early in perfusion. Significant sequestration occurred in the lung, but not in the extracorporeal circuit. To determine the contribution of these cells to spontaneous injury in this model, lungs perfused in situ with a constant flow (100 ml.kg-1.min-1) of homologous leukopenic (WBC = 540 mm-3, n = 8) or thrombocytopenic blood (PLT = 10,000 mm-3, n = 6) were compared with control lungs perfused with untreated homologous blood (WBC = 5,320, PLT = 422,000, n = 8). Perfusion of control lungs caused a rapid fall in WBC and PLT followed by transient increases in pulmonary arterial pressure, lung lymph flow, and perfusate concentrations of 6-ketoprostaglandin F1 alpha and thromboxane B2. The negative value of reservoir weight (delta W) was measured as an index of fluid entry into the lung extravascular space during perfusion. delta W increased rapidly for 60 min and then more gradually to 242 g at 180 min. This was accompanied by a rise in the lymph-to-plasma oncotic pressure ratio (pi L/pi P). Relative to control, leukopenic perfusion decreased the ratio of wet weight to dry weight, the intra- plus extravascular blood weight, and the incidence of bloody lymph. Thrombocytopenic perfusion increased lung lymph flow and the rate of delta W, decreased pi L/pi P and perfusate thromboxane B2, and delayed the peak pulmonary arterial pressure. These results suggest that perfusate leukocytes sequestered in the lung and contributed to hemorrhage but were not necessary for hypertension and edema. Platelets were an important source of thromboxane but protected against edema by an unknown mechanism.\r"

We have found that verapamil, a phenylalkene with calcium channel and alpha 1-receptor binding properties, has a multiphasic concentration effect on surfactant secretion from [3H]choline-labeled rat type II pneumocytes in culture. Verapamil (10(-8) M) caused a 24% stimulation of surfactant secretion, whereas an 8% inhibition was found at 10(-6) M and a 70% stimulation was found at 10(-4) M. Lactate dehydrogenase release occurred at 5 x 10(-4) M verapamil. Verapamil (10(-4) M) also produced a 100% increase in adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (cAMP) in comparison with concentrations of less than or equal to 10(-6) M, an effect that could not be blocked by propranolol (10(-4) M). Verapamil (10(-6) M) increased the total formation of inositol phosphates (IP) by 23% in comparison with IP formation in control cells. Calcium influx was inhibited 15% by 10(-8) M verapamil and 37% by 10(-4) M verapamil. Calcium efflux was stimulated 44% by 10(-5) M verapamil. In combination with 50% effective concentrations (EC50) of terbutaline, phorbol ester, and ATP, the respective effects of verapamil (10(-4) M) on surfactant secretion were approximately additive. We conclude that verapamil has a novel multiphasic concentration effect on surfactant secretion, which appears to involve several signal transduction pathways including cAMP formation, IP formation, inhibition of calcium influx, and stimulation of calcium efflux.\r"

The cranial tracheal arteries were perfused at constant flow, with monitoring of the perfusion pressures (Ptr) and the external tracheal diameter (Dtr). Control fluid was Krebs-Henseleit solution (KH) with NaCl added to result in a 325-mosM solution (isotonic). Hypertonic solutions were KH with NaCl (warm hypertonic) or glucose (hypertonic glucose) added to result in a 800-mosM solution. All solutions were at 38 degrees C, with isotonic and the hypertonic NaCl solutions also given at 18 degrees C (cold isotonic and cold hypertonic). Fluorescent labeled albumin was given intravenously, and the change in fluorescence in the fluid was measured during each 15-min period. Changing from warm isotonic to cold isotonic decreased Dtr and Ptr. Changing from warm isotonic to warm hypertonic or hypertonic glucose decreased Ptr with no change in Dtr. The cold hypertonic responses were not different from cold isotonic responses. Warm hypertonic solution increased albumin flux into the tracheal lumen over a 15-min period to three times that of the control period, persisting for 15 min after replacement with warm isotonic solution. Cooling induces a vasodilation and smooth muscle contraction of the trachea, whereas hypertonic solutions result in vasodilation and, if osmolality is increased with NaCl, an increase in albumin flux into the tracheal lumen.\r"

Because this technique eliminates the net exchange of O2 between venous effluent and the environment, measurement of the O2 concentration is conveniently made by use of a polarographic sensor in a collected pool of effluent at the bottom of a closed organ chamber. The method was validated against conventional techniques using cannulation of the pulmonary artery. The two-sensor technique allows O2 consumption measurements to be made in isolated organ preparations in which representative venous cannulation is prohibitively difficult, for example in organs with multiple venous drains, or those in which cannulation would be expected to cause excessive perturbation of physiological status.\r"

SM EMG was evaluated during eupnea and brief experimental airway occlusion. Phasic inspiratory SM EMG was rarely seen during eupnea. SM EMG tended to increase on the first occluded effort, although this increase was not statistically significant in most babies. All infants showed progressive breath-by-breath augmentation of phasic SM EMG during occlusions in rapid-eye-movement (REM) as well as quiet (QS) sleep; phasic increases in SM EMG were similar during REM and QS occlusions in the majority (16/22) of babies. Periods of airway closure were detected during 24 occlusions in 5 infants; phasic SM EMG was reduced on these occasions. The results are consistent with the idea that recruitment of upper airway muscles contributes to the stability of the airway of the preterm human.\r"

  ".W": "The intracellular pathways and the kinetics of metabolism of surfactant apoprotein and lipid, which may be recycled from the alveolar space, are largely unknown. We used a lipid-apoprotein complex made from liposomes of pure lipids in a ratio found in mammalian pulmonary surfactant plus surfactant apoprotein (SP-A, Mr = 26,000-36,000) to test some possible relationships in the recycling of these major surfactant components between intrapulmonary compartments. After intratracheal instillation of 80 microliters of an apoprotein-liposome mixture with separate radiolabels in the lipid and the apoprotein, rats were killed at times from 8 min to 4 h later. The lungs were lavaged with saline, and subcellular fractions were isolated on discontinuous sucrose density gradients. Both the [14C]lipid radiolabel and the 125I-apoprotein radiolabel demonstrated a time-dependent increase in radioactivity recovered in a lamellar body-enriched fraction. Uptake of the radiolabels into other subcellular fractions did not exhibit a clear-cut time dependence; more of the protein than the lipid radiolabel was found in the Golgi-rich and microsomal fractions. We conclude that both the lipid and apoprotein portions of lung surfactant are taken up by lung cells and are incorporated into secretory granules of the cells.\r"

Heart rate, core (Tc) and tail-skin temperatures, and mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) were also monitored. Before heating, the celiac ganglion was removed (ganglionectomy) from one group of animals (n = 11) and a bilateral adrenal demedullation was performed in a second group (n = 14). As Tc progressively increased from 37 degrees C to 43 degrees C, MAP rose to a plateau then fell precipitously as Tc exceeded 41 degrees C. Ganglionectomy eliminated the rise in mesenteric resistance (P less than 0.05) and attenuated the rise in MAP compared with an intact control group (n = 11). Ganglionectomy also increased the heating rate (P less than 0.05) and reduced heat tolerance time (P less than 0.05). Demedullation attenuated the rise in both mesenteric resistance and MAP (P less than 0.05) and increased the rate of heating (P less than 0.05) compared with controls (n = 10). Renal and caudal resistance changes were similar in all groups. These data show the importance of intact adrenal medullas and sympathetic innervation to the splanchnic region in contributing to thermal tolerance in the rat. However, neither factor alone can explain splanchnic vasoconstriction during severe heat stress.\r"

  ".W": "To determine upper airway and respiratory muscle responses to nasal continuous negative airway pressure (CNAP), we quantitated the changes in diaphragmatic and genioglossal electromyographic activity, inspiratory duration, tidal volume, minute ventilation, and end-expiratory lung volume (EEL) during CNAP in six normal subjects during wakefulness and five during sleep. During wakefulness, CNAP resulted in immediate increases in electromyographic diaphragmatic and genioglossal muscle activity, and inspiratory duration, preserved or increased tidal volume and minute ventilation, and decreased EEL. During non-rapid-eye-movement and rapid-eye-movement sleep, CNAP was associated with no immediate muscle or timing responses, incomplete or complete upper airway occlusion, and decreased EEL. Progressive diaphragmatic and genioglossal responses were observed during non-rapid-eye-movement sleep in association with arterial O2 desaturation, but airway patency was not reestablished until further increases occurred with arousal. These results indicate that normal subjects, while awake, can fully compensate for CNAP by increasing respiratory and upper airway muscle activities but are unable to do so during sleep in the absence of arousal. This sleep-induced failure of load compensation predisposes the airways to collapse under conditions which threaten airway patency during sleep. The abrupt electromyogram responses seen during wakefulness and arousal are indicative of the importance of state effects, whereas the gradual increases seen during sleep probably reflect responses to changing blood gas composition.\r"

When contractile responses of equal magnitude were compared, the contractions elicited by acetylcholine were resistant to the inhibitory effects of PGE2, relative to comparable contractions elicited by histamine. To assess the role of adenylate cyclase in determining the different responses to histamine and acetylcholine in the presence of PGE2, we assayed adenylate cyclase activity in membranes prepared from canine tracheal smooth muscle and found that acetylcholine, but not histamine, decreased PGE2-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity by 48 +/- 2% (mean +/- SE; n = 5). However, in other experiments, we found that even large pharmacological increases in tissue adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (cAMP) content only partially inhibited muscarinic tone. Also, exogenously applied analogues of cyclic AMP inhibited contractions induced by histamine more effectively than comparable contractions induced by acetylcholine. We concluded that acetylcholine decreased adenylate cyclase activity in membranes prepared from canine tracheal smooth muscle and that this effect may have contributed to, but did not completely account for, the relative resistance of muscarinic contractions to the inhibitory effects of PGE2.\r"

  ".W": "We have previously demonstrated that the shortening of the canine parasternal intercostals during inspiration results primarily from the muscles' own activation (J. Appl. Physiol. 64: 1546-1553, 1988). In the present studies, we have tested the hypothesis that other inspiratory rib cage muscles may contribute to the parasternal inspiratory shortening. Eight supine, spontaneously breathing dogs were studied. Changes in length of the third or fourth right parasternal intercostal were measured during quiet breathing and during single-breath airway occlusion first with the animal intact, then after selective denervation of the muscle, and finally after bilateral phrenicotomy. Denervating the parasternal virtually eliminated the muscle shortening during quiet inspiration and caused the muscle to lengthen during occluded breaths. After phrenicotomy, however, the parasternal, while being denervated, shortened again a significant amount during both quiet inspiration and occluded breaths. These data thus confirm that a component of the parasternal inspiratory shortening is not active and results from the action of other inspiratory rib cage muscles. Additional studies in four animals demonstrated that the scalene and serratus muscles do not play any role in this phenomenon; it must therefore result from the action of intrinsic rib cage muscles.\r"

In the present studies, we have tested the hypothesis that this passive parasternal inspiratory shortening is due to the action of the other parasternal intercostals. Changes in length of the denervated third right parasternal were measured in eight supine phrenicotomized animals. We found that 1) the inspiratory muscle shortening increased after denervation of the third left parasternal but gradually decreased with denervation of the parasternals situated in the second, fourth, and fifth interspaces; 2) the muscle, however, always continued to shorten during inspiration, even after denervation of all the parasternals; 3) stimulating selectively the third left parasternal caused a muscle lengthening; and 4) bilateral stimulation of the parasternals in the second or the fourth interspace produced a muscle shortening. We conclude that 1) the two parasternals situated in the same interspace on both sides of the sternum are mechanically arranged in series, whereas the parasternals located in adjacent interspaces are mechanically arranged in parallel; and 2) if a denervated parasternal continues to shorten during inspiration, this is in part because of the action of the parasternals in the adjacent interspaces and in part because of other inspiratory muscles of the rib cage, possibly the external intercostals and the levator costae.\r"

All muscles were fixed by vascular perfusion at sarcomere lengths ranging from 1.5 to 2.7 micron. The ratios of capillary counts per fiber cross-sectional area on two sets of sections (0 and 90 degrees) to the muscle fiber axis were used to estimate capillary anisotropy and the coefficient c(K,0) relating 1) capillary counts on transverse sections (a commonly used parameter to assess muscle capillarity) and 2) capillary length per volume of fiber (i.e., capillary length density). Capillary orientation parallel to the muscle fiber axis decreased substantially with muscle fiber shortening. In muscles fixed at sarcomere lengths of 2.69 microns (dog vastus intermedius) and 1.52 microns (dog gastrocnemius), capillary tortuosity and branching added 7 and 64%, respectively, to capillary length density. The data obtained in this study are highly consistent with the previously demonstrated relationship between capillary anisotropy and sarcomere length in extended vs. contracted rat muscles, by use of the same method. Capillary anisotropy in mammalian locomotory muscles is curvilinearly related to sarcomere length. No systematic difference was found in capillary tortuosity with either body size, athletic ability, or aerobic capacity. Capillary tortuosity is a consequence of fiber shortening rather than an indicator of the O2 requirements of the tissue.\r"

To determine whether airway blood flow responds similarly in the sheep we studied 16 anesthetized sheep. Seven sheep (1-7) were subjected to two 30-min periods of eucapnic hyperventilation breathing 1) warm humid air [100% relative humidity (rh)] followed by 2) warm dry air [0% rh] at 40 breaths/min. To determine whether there was a dose-response effect on blood flow of increasing levels of hyperventilation of dry air, another nine sheep (8-16) were subjected to four 30-min periods of eucapnic hyperventilation breathing warm humid O2 followed by warm dry O2 at 20 or 40 breaths/min in random sequence. Five minutes before the end of each period of hyperventilation, hemodynamics, blood gases, and tracheal mucosal temperature were measured, and tracheal and bronchial blood flows were determined by injection of 15- or 50-micron-diam radiolabeled microspheres. After the last measurements had been made, all sheep were killed, and the lungs and trachea were removed for determination of blood flow to trachea, bronchi, and parenchyma. In sheep 1-7, warm dry air hyperventilation at 40 breaths/min produced an increase in blood flow to trachea (7.6 +/- 3.5 to 17.0 +/- 6.2 ml/min, P less than 0.05) and bronchi (9.0 +/- 5.4 to 18.2 +/- 8.2 ml/min, P less than 0.05) but not to the parenchyma. When blood flow was compared with the two ventilatory rates (sheep 8-16), tracheal blood flow increased (9.1 +/- 3.3 to 18.2 +/- 6.1 ml/min, P less than 0.05) at a rate of 40 breaths/min but not at 20 breaths/min.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The macrophage-derived cytokine tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha) has been proposed as the major mediator of endotoxin-induced injury. To examine whether a single infusion of human recombinant TNF alpha (rTNF alpha) reproduces the pulmonary effects of endotoxemia, we infused rTNF alpha (0.01 mg/kg) over 30 min into six chronically instrumented awake sheep and assessed the ensuing changes in hemodynamics, lung lymph flow and protein concentration, and number of peripheral blood and lung lymph leukocytes. In addition, levels of thromboxane B2, 6-ketoprostaglandin F1 alpha, prostaglandin E2, and leukotriene B4 were measured in lung lymph. Pulmonary arterial pressure (Ppa) peaked within 15 min of the start of rTNF alpha infusion [base-line Ppa = 22.0 +/- 1.5 (SE) cmH2O; after 15 min of rTNF alpha infusion, Ppa = 54.2 +/- 5.4] and then fell toward base line. The pulmonary hypertension was accompanied by hypoxemia and peripheral blood and lung lymph leukopenia, both of which persisted throughout the 4 h of study. These changes were followed by an increase in protein-rich lung lymph flow (base-line lymph protein clearance = 1.8 +/- 0.4 cmH2O; 3 h after rTNF alpha infusion, clearance = 5.6 +/- 1.2), consistent with an increase in pulmonary microvascular permeability. Cardiac output and left atrial pressure did not change significantly throughout the experiment. Light-microscopic examination of lung tissue at autopsy revealed congestion, neutrophil sequestration, and patchy interstitial edema. We conclude that rTNF alpha induces a response in awake sheep remarkable similar to that of endotoxemia. Because endotoxin is a known stimulant of TNF alpha production, TNF alpha may mediate endotoxin-induced lung injury.\r"

In 14 dogs anesthetized with pentobarbital sodium, electromyographic activity of the costal and crural diaphragm, parasternal intercostal, and upper airway respiratory muscles was measured during distension of the small intestine. Rib cage and abdominal motion and tidal volume were also recorded. Distension produced an immediate apnea (11.16 +/- 0.80 s). During the first postapneic breath, costal (43 +/- 7% control) and crural (64 +/- 6% control) activity were reduced (P less than 0.001). In contrast, intercostal (137 +/- 11%) and upper airway muscle activity, including alae nasi (157 +/- 16%), genioglossus (170 +/- 15%), and posterior cricoarytenoid muscles (142 +/- 7%) all increased (P less than 0.005). There was greater outward rib cage motion although the abdomen moved paradoxically inward during inspiration, resulting in a reduction in tidal volume (82 +/- 6% control) (P less than 0.005). Postvagotomy distension produced a similar apnea and subsequent reduction in costal and crural activity. However, enhancement of intercostal and upper airway muscle activation was abolished and there was a greater fall in tidal volume (65 +/- 14%). In conclusion, mechanical stimulation of intestinal afferents affects the various inspiratory muscles differently; nonvagal afferents produce an initial apnea and subsequent depression of diaphragm activity whereas vagal pathways mediate selective enhancement of intercostal and upper airway muscle activation.\r"

Permeability of 125I-albumin across confluent monolayers of cultured bovine pulmonary artery endothelial cells was measured before and after the addition of 0.1 microM alpha-thrombin. In the presence of normal extracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]o, 1000 microM), alpha-thrombin produced a 175 +/- 10% increase in 125I-albumin permeability. At lower [Ca2+]o (100, 10, 1, or less than 1 microM), alpha-thrombin caused a 140% increase in permeability (P less than 0.005). LaCl3 (1 mM), which competes for Ca2+ entry, blunted 38% of the increase in permeability. Preloading endothelial monolayers with quin2 to buffer cytosolic Ca2+ (Cai2+) produced a dose-dependent inhibition of the increase in 125I-albumin permeability. Preincubation with nifedipine or verapamil was ineffective in reducing the thrombin-induced permeability increase. A 60 mM K+ isosmotic solution did not alter base-line endothelial permeability. alpha-Thrombin increased [Ca2+]i in a dose-dependent manner and the 45Ca2+ influx rate. Extracellular medium containing 60 mM K+ did not increase 45Ca2+ influx, and nifedipine did not block the rise in 45Ca2+ influx caused by alpha-thrombin. Ca2+ flux into endothelial cells induced by alpha-thrombin does not occur through voltage-sensitive channels but may involve receptor-operated channels. In conclusion, the increase in endothelial albumin permeability caused by alpha-thrombin is dependent on Ca2+ influx and intracellular Ca2+ mobilization.\r"

We postulated that a lower mixed venous O2 saturation (Svo2) would steepen dSao2/dt by more rapid depletion of alveolar O2. Single isolated (NREP) and five or more sequential repetitive apneas (REP) were created by clamping an indwelling cuffed endotracheal tube at end expiration. Fiberoptic catheters were used for continuous monitoring of Sao2, Svo2, and cardiac output. The mean dSao2/dt for all duration NREP apneas was 0.60%/s. Mean dSao2/dt increased above base line for each consecutive REP apnea and was higher in 60 s than in 45 and 30 s REP apnea series. The increase in dSao2/dt corresponded closely with the fall in preapneic Svo2. Preapneic arterial O2 content fell during successive REP apneas but the maximal decrement from base line (1.3 ml/dl) was much less than the maximal decrement in preapneic mixed venous O2 content of 5.1 ml/dl. Preapneic cardiac output for NREP apneas and nadir cardiac output for REP apneas remained constant. Nadir cardiac output for NREP apneas showed higher values for longer duration apneas. We concluded that dSao2/dt is inversely related to preapneic Svo2.\r"

The purpose of this investigation was to determine the role that microvascular pressure plays in edema induced by reactive O2 species generated by xanthine oxidase. In isolated rat lungs perfused with Krebs buffer plus 4% albumin, 5 mM glucose, and 2 mM xanthine at constant flow (13 ml/min), addition of xanthine oxidase (0.02 U/ml) caused a progressive increase in both pulmonary arterial and microvascular pressure (double occlusion method), which preceded the onset of edema. Both the pressure rise and edema formation were blocked by catalase, suggesting that vascular injury was related to H2O2 production. Lungs not exposed to free radicals that had microvascular pressure elevated to match that of the xanthine oxidase-perfused lungs showed only a small, reversible (nonedematous) weight gain. Lungs exposed to xanthine oxidase but perfused at constant microvascular pressure (5 Torr, similar to control lungs) showed a significant delay in protein-rich edema formation. These data indicate that reactive O2 metabolites induced lung injury, which is accompanied by increased microvascular pressure. Although the rise in microvascular pressure was shown not to be essential for edema formation, it does play a role in acceleration of the rate of transvascular fluid loss.\r"

Exercise increased O2 consumption (Vo2) from 5 +/- 1 to 50 +/- 4 ml.min-1.kg-1, plasma norepinephrine level from 188 +/- 28 to 2,682 +/- 160 pg/ml, and plasma epinephrine level from 94 +/- 72 to 857 +/- 180 pg/ml. The density of beta-adrenergic receptors on lymphocytes obtained at rest was 31 +/- 3.7 fmol/mg protein; exercise increased the density of receptors by 86 +/- 33% (range 0-257%) to 58.3 +/- 1.5 fmol/mg protein but did not alter the affinity of the receptor for [125I]iodopindolol or the coupling of the receptor to the guanine nucleotide-binding regulatory protein. The density of beta-adrenergic receptors increased progressively throughout exercise and paralleled the increase in heart rate. The magnitude of the change in the density of beta-adrenergic receptors did not correlate with the magnitude of the increase in heart rate, Vo2, or plasma levels of catecholamines. The density of receptors was still elevated 15 min after completion of exercise but fell below base line 1 h after peak exercise to 18.2 +/- 6.7 fmol/mg protein (P less than 0.05 vs. base-line levels). These results demonstrate that exhaustive exercise results in a progressive increase in the number of beta-adrenergic receptors on lymphocyte membranes, followed by a reduction in the density of receptors during the recovery phase of exercise. Despite a significant increase in the level of plasma catecholamines, the receptor remains coupled to the guanine nucleotide-binding regulatory protein.\r"

  ".W": "Esophageal electrodes have been used for recording the electromyographic (EMG) activity of the posterior cricoarytenoid muscle (PCA). To determine the specificity of this EMG technique, esophageal electrode recordings were compared with intramuscular recordings in eight anesthetized mongrel dogs. Intramuscular wire electrodes were placed in the right and left PCA, and the esophageal electrode was introduced through the nose or mouth and advanced into the upper esophagus. On direct visualization of the upper airway, the unshielded catheter electrode entered the esophagus on the right or left side. Cold block of the recurrent laryngeal nerve (RLN) ipsilateral to the esophageal electrode was associated with a marked decrease in recorded activity, whereas cold block of the contralateral RLN resulted only in a small reduction in activity. After supplemental doses of anesthesia were administered, bilateral RLN cold block essentially abolished the activity recorded with the intramuscular electrodes as well as that recorded with the esophageal electrode. Before supplemental doses of anesthesia were given, especially after vagotomy, the esophageal electrode, and in some cases the intramuscular electrodes, recorded phasic inspiratory activity not originating from the PCA. Therefore, one should be cautious in interpreting the activity recorded from esophageal electrodes as originating from the PCA, especially in conditions associated with increased respiratory efforts.\r"

Fischer 344 rats 6 (n = 20) and 25 mo of age (n = 20) were received from the National Institute on Aging. NEt was determined at rest, during 30 min of submaximal exercise, and at maximal exercise by administration of alpha-methyl-p-tyrosine, a competitive inhibitor of tyrosine hydroxylase. Resting NE declined with age in both heart (38.2 vs. 30.5 ng.g-1.h-1) and liver (11.2 vs. 6.4 ng.g-1.h-1). NEt was greater in the older animals compared with the young animals in heart (120.9 vs. 169.5 ng.g-1.h-1), liver (23.1 vs. 38.9 ng.g-1.h-1), and adrenals (74.0 vs. 98.4 ng.mg-1.h-1) during submaximal exercise. In response to maximal exercise, NEt varied depending on age and tissue. It was concluded that, in response to exercise stress, the older animals generally demonstrated a higher NEt (reflecting elevated sympathetic activity) perhaps because of a decreased adrenergic receptor sensitivity and/or responsiveness.\r"

We reported that leg compliance was inversely related to the size of the muscle compartment. The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that reduced muscle compartment after long-duration exposure to microgravity would cause increased leg compliance. Eight men, 31-45 yr old, were measured for vascular compliance of the calf and serial circumferences of the calf before and after 30 days of continuous 6 degrees head-down bed rest. Cross-sectional areas (CSA) of muscle, fat, and bone compartments in the calf were determined before and after bed rest by computed tomography. From before to after bed rest, calculated calf volume (cm3) decreased (P less than 0.05) from 1,682 +/- 83 to 1,516 +/- 76. Calf muscle compartment CSA (cm2) also decreased (P less than 0.05) from 74.2 +/- 3.6 to 70.6 +/- 3.4; calf compliance (ml.100 ml-1.mmHg-1.100) increased (P less than 0.05) from 3.9 +/- .7 to 4.9 +/- .5. The percent change in calf compliance after bed rest was significantly correlated with changes in calf muscle compartment CSA (r = 0.72, P less than 0.05). The increased leg compliance observed after exposure to simulated microgravity can be partially explained by reduced muscle compartment. Countermeasures designed to minimize muscle atrophy in the lower extremities may be effective in ameliorating increased venous compliance and orthostatic intolerance after spaceflight.\r"

More importantly, the level of circulating serial circulating endotoxin can be diminished by early excision; late wound excision was associated with a transient increase of serial circulating endotoxin level. Early excision, therefore, may play a critical role in limiting endotoxemia after burn injury.\r"

The change in polymorphonuclear leukocyte fluorescence was calculated from fluorescence histograms before and after stimulation. The oxidative metabolism of burn polymorphonuclear leukocytes was clearly depressed on days 5 and 10 after burn injury. Control polymorphonuclear leukocytes in the presence of day 5 burn serum produced decreased levels of H2O2, returning to normal by day 10. In general, bactericidal activity is markedly depressed on days 5 and 10 after thermal injury and may be associated with increased risk of sepsis.\r"

Subclavian-carotid bypass is probably the most frequently performed operation. In the past 5 years 13 patients underwent an alternative operation, axillary-carotid bypass, which may be technically easier than subclavian-carotid bypass and just as durable. The graft is placed under the clavicle, in an easily constructed tunnel not involving the true thoracic outlet, deep to the sternocleidomastoid muscle and internal jugular vein. Five distal anastomoses were made to the common carotid (2 greater saphenous vein, 2 Dacron and 1 Gortex grafts), 4 to the internal carotid (all vein) and 4 to the external carotid (all vein, 1 sequential with a end-side anastomosis to the ipsilateral vertebral). There were no perioperative deaths. One stroke occurred in a patient with a Dacron graft to the common carotid who also had a concomitant ipsilateral carotid endarterectomy. All grafts were open by Doppler exam at a mean follow-up of 2 1/2 years. Improved cerebral hemodynamics was confirmed in 11 patients by Gee oculoplethysmography. These early results support the use of the axillary artery as a donor for extracranial cerebral revascularization when the proximal common carotid is occluded or severely stenotic.\r"

The most common cause of vertebrobasilar symptoms is hypoperfusion which may be relieved by correction of a critical carotid stenosis. A safe record with direct vertebral revascularization has led us to do simultaneous correction of lesions in the carotid and vertebral arteries through a single cervical incision. To evaluate combined carotid and vertebral reconstruction, procedures performed in a five-year period (1982 to 1987) were retrospectively studied. Thirty-six patients had combined carotid-vertebral reconstruction. In 10 patients, the primary indication was critical carotid disease; 26 patients had vertebrobasilar symptoms. The procedures performed were carotid endarterectomy with either vertebral reimplantation (22) or distal vertebral bypass (7), or external carotid angioplasty with either vertebral reimplantation (3) or distal vertebral bypass (4). Combined carotid-vertebral procedures are effective in relieving symptoms of hypoperfusion in the vertebrobasilar system. A specific lesson learned is that a distal vertebral bypass must not be done in conjunction with an external carotid angioplasty.\r"

In the remaining 14 patients the source of the embolus was not initially apparent but investigation by echocardiography, 24 hour Holter monitoring and coagulation studies suggested a source in eight. Embolectomy was performed in 51 patients and amputation as a primary procedure in two. The patients with subclavian artery aneurysms were not treated surgically. A normal circulation was restored both clinically and angiographically in 43 patients, four of whom later died from myocardial infarction. Four of the remaining eight patients had residual arm claudication, three required amputation and one had an ischaemic contracture.

Three patients were not operated upon (Group I), twenty patients had immediate surgery (Group II) with 60% mortality, four patients underwent delayed surgery (Group III) with 25% mortality. Analysis of cause of death show that associated lesions were present in 72% of pts who did not survive and in only 37% among survivors. Associated lesions may be lethal initially (e.g. brain trauma) or they may be aggravated by the thoracic procedure. Complications from associated lesions may also compromise the outcome. It is well known that the majority of deaths from ATRTA occur within 24 hours. Immediate repair of the aortic lesion should be the rule when aortic rupture is isolated or associated with moderate injuries. It may be however that in some cases with severe and multiple associated lesions who survive the initial aortic injury, delayed repair of ATRTA could be considered.\r"

Prior to 1976, a variety of surgical procedures (diaphragmatic crus release, arterial dilation, patch angioplasty, reimplantation, endarterectomy) were employed in treatment of patients with a wide range of symptoms and variation in number of mesenteric vessels involved. Since 1976, we have selected patients with \"typical\" symptoms (postprandial epigastric pain, fear of eating, weight loss) and 2 or 3 vessel disease, and have avoided surgery for celiac crus lesions. Typical symptoms were seldom present in isolated celiac artery crus compression, 4 of 15 pts (23%), but were often present with 2 or 3 vessel disease, 17 of 28 pts (61%, p = 0.03). Satisfactory resolution of pain was achieved in 18 of 24 pts with 2 or 3 vessel disease. We conclude that presence of \"typical\" symptoms and angiographic findings of 2 or 3 vessel disease are prerequisites for effective surgical treatment. Bypass graft is our surgical technique of choice, but the extent of arterial reconstruction required to relieve symptoms remains undefined.\r"

From June 1984 through June 1986, 172 patients underwent elective infrarenal abdominal aortic surgery on the Vascular Surgery Service at Eastern Virginia Medical School. One hundred nineteen were operated through a transperitoneal approach, and 53 through a retroperitoneal approach. The two groups were similar relative to age, sex, indications, risk factors and operations performed. The groups were then analyzed relative to operating time, blood transfusion, fluid replacement, ileus, morbidity, length of hospital stay, American Society of Anesthesiologists classification, and mortality. Significant differences were found: retroperitoneal patients had shorter operating time, shorter ileus, fewer cardiac complications, and shorter hospitalization than transperitoneal patients. This retrospective evaluation supports the conclusion that the retroperitoneal approach to abdominal aortic surgery is safe and beneficial in most patients. The retroperitoneal approach should therefore be given consideration in routine aortic surgery.\r"

Fifty-nine patients underwent a standard aortofemoral bypass and 116 patients underwent one of three alternative procedures consisting of femoro-femoral, iliofemoral, or axillofemoral bypass. The operative stress, morbidity, mortality and long-term results were compared. Although the aortofemoral group had a higher three-year cumulative patency rate (89% vs 81%), the alternative procedure group had a lower operative mortality (1.8% vs 7%). In addition, the patients in the alternative procedure group were slightly older, had a higher percentage of procedures performed for limb salvage, and had a less optimal run-off status, yet the complication rate was significantly less than that of the aortofemoral group (p less than 0.05). The use of these alternative procedures should be considered for patients with symptomatic aortoiliac disease, who represent a moderate operative risk as well as those in a high risk category.\r"

  ".W": "The use of chemically processed bovine heterografts is primarily confined to the construction of arterio-venous blood accesses in those patients requiring hemodialysis, plasmapheresis or chemotherapy. The grafts of the first generation i.e. Artegraft and Solcograft are now being supplanted by those of the second generation i.e. Reinforced Artegraft, Solco P and NCGT. We have investigated these three types of arterial prostheses as a biomaterial in terms of sterility, inflammatory response and cytocompatibility and as a blood conduit in dogs in terms of patency and healing. For each type of graft, two implantations were carried out for durations of 4 hours, 24 hours, 48 hours, one week, two weeks, one month, three months, and six months. Therefore a total of 48 grafts were implanted. All grafts but five were patent at sacrifice: thromboses were observed in two Reinforced Artegraft (after two weeks and after one month) and in three NCGT (after 24 hours, after 48 hours, and after one month). Therefore the following patencies were observed: Reinforced Artegraft 14/16, Solco P 16/16 and NCGT 13/16. In all the patent grafts, the healing was reduced to the formation of a pannus along both anastomoses; thrombotic accumulations were observed on the surface defects of the grafts, particularly the NCGT graft. The Reinforced Artegraft presents only minor advantages over the previous Artegraft; the Solco P, somewhat more acceptable is no longer commercially available since the manufacturer withdrew it after early clinical failures. The improvements noted in the bovine heterografts of the second generation appear to be marginal as compared to those of the first generation.\r"

A method of vascular scoring is presented, integrating symptoms, physical examination, vascular laboratory studies and arteriography. The score is expressed in a concise form by several letters and numbers supplying the relevant information as to the main segment involved, the severity of the ischaemia and the completeness of the examination. The files of 100 candidates for vascular surgery were recorded with the scoring method. Vascular indices were calculated by dividing the sum of points assigned to each item by the maximal available score. The internal consistency of the method was evaluated by computing separate indices for the three components of the scoring--clinical examination (CE), vascular laboratory (VL) and arteriography (AR)--and comparing them with the overall index and with each other. Correlation coefficients with the overall index were for CE 0.90, for VL 0.92 and for AR 0.75. The data on the 200 limbs were reviewed independently by three experienced vascular surgeons and ranked in order of increasing severity of ischaemia; the correlation coefficient between this ranking and one based solely on the scoring method was 0.91. A vascular scoring method may help create a mutual language among practitioners, enabling them to compare results and benefit from accumulating worldwide experience.\r"

PtcO2 greater than 24 mmHg was chosen to predict healing and indicated 13 above-knee (AK) and 25 below-knee (BK) amputations. Clinical criteria indicated 12 AK and 26 BK amputations. PtcO2 and clinical judgement differed on five occasions, a lower amputation was indicated by PtcO2 twice and by clinical selection three times (PtcO2 16 mmHg). Amputation was performed at the more distal level indicated (25 BK, 13 AK). Foot PtcO2 in both groups did not differ significantly, 4.08 +/- 2.00 mmHg (BK) and 3.9 +/- 1.29 mmHg (AK) (p greater than 0.5), nor did above knee PtcO2 (p greater than 0.3). Anterior below knee PtcO2 in both groups differed significantly, 34.92 +/- 10.84 mmHg (BK) and 9.5 +/- 5.60 mmHg (AK) (p less than 0.001). Likewise, posterior PtcO2, 39.64 +/- 6.85 mmHg (BK) and 14.1 +/- 4.43 mmHg (AK) (p less than 0.001). Amputation sites healed primarily within two weeks except the site with a pre-operative PtcO2 of 16 mmHg, where healing was delayed and occurred by second intention. These results indicate that PtcO2 is a valid predictor of primary healing following amputation.\r"

Occlusion of the popliteal vein had not been recognized during the early treatment period. Subsequent to identification of this mechanism, limb salvage was achieved with an interposition graft of the popliteal vein using externally supported PTFE. The prereconstruction venous pressure gradient of 29 cm H2O was virtually abolished immediately after reestablishing venous outflow. The distal arteriovenous fistula, initially established to maintain prosthetic arterial graft patency, now serves, in this case, a dual function by additionally maintaining prosthetic venous graft patency. An intact deep venous system is critical for achieving successful arterial reconstruction and to avoid the complications associated with an occluded outflow tract in the face of augmented inflow.\r"

Under CT control, a fine needle may be inserted into the peri-graft space, and cultures may be obtained. Further confirmation may be achieved by an injection of a small amount of contrast material which will demonstrate lack of incorporation of the graft into surrounding tissues. Prior confirmation of graft infection permits a staged procedure to repair this technique is illustrated with a case history.\r"

All 14 mice injected with a single dose of 2,200 (n = 10) or 2,800 microCi (n = 4) showed complete tumor remission. 8 of the 10 mice treated with 2,200 microCi survived in good health for 1 yr when they were killed and shown to be tumor free. Four of nine other mice treated with four fractionated doses of 400 microCi showed no tumor relapse for more than 9 mo. In contrast, all 15 mice injected with 1,600-3,000 microCi 131I-control IgG F(ab')2 showed tumor growth retardation of only 1-4 wk, and 15 of 16 mice injected with unlabeled anti-CEA MAb F(ab')2 showed unmodified tumor progression as compared with untreated mice. From tissue radioactivity distributions it was calculated that by an injection of 2,200 microCi 131I-MAb F(ab')2 a mean dose of 8,335 rad was selectively delivered to the tumor, while the tissue-absorbed radiation doses for the normal organs were: peripheral blood, 2,093; stomach, 1,668; kidney, 1,289; lung, 1,185; liver, 617; spleen, 501; small intestine, 427; large intestine, 367; bone, 337; and muscle, 198.

In this paper we have investigated the hypothesis that net loss of K+ through a K+ transport pathway protects erythrocytes from complement-induced colloidosmotic swelling and lysis. Antibody-sensitized human erythrocytes containing different intracellular cation concentrations (nystatin treatment) were exposed to low concentrations of guinea pig serum in media of different cation composition; complement lysis was assessed by the release of hemoglobin and the volume of the surviving cells estimated by their density distribution profiles. Complement-dependent swelling and lysis of erythrocytes (a) were limited by the presence of an outwardly directed K+ electrochemical gradient and (b) were enhanced by carbocyanine, a specific inhibitor of the Ca2+-activated K+ transport pathway, and by absence of Ca2+ in the external medium. We propose that during complement activation a rising cytosolic calcium triggers the Ca2+-activated K+ permeability pathway, the Gardos effect, produces a net K+, Cl- and water loss, and thus limits the colloidosmotic swelling and lysis of erythrocytes.\r"

Because PF4 (25 micrograms/ml) had no effect on either myeloid or erythroid colony formation lineage specificity of this effect was suggested. A synthetic COOH-terminal PF4 peptide of 24, but not 13 residues, also inhibited megakaryocyte colony formation, whereas a synthetic 18-residue beta-thromboglobulin (beta-TG) peptide and native beta-TG had no such effect when assayed at similar concentrations. The mechanism of PF4-mediated inhibition was investigated. First, we enumerated total cell number, and examined cell maturation in control colonies (n = 200) and colonies (n = 100) that arose in PF4-containing cultures. Total cells per colony did not differ dramatically in the two groups (6.1 +/- 3.0 vs. 4.2 +/- 1.6, respectively), but the numbers of mature large cells per colony was significantly decreased in the presence of PF4 when compared with controls (1.6 +/- 1.5 vs. 3.9 +/- 2.3; P less than 0.001). Second, by using the human leukemia cell line HEL as a model for primitive megakaryocytic cells, we studied the effect of PF4 on cell doubling time, on the expression of both growth-regulated (H3, p53, c-myc,and c-myb), and non-growth-regulated (beta 2-microglobulin) genes. At high concentrations of native PF4 (50 micrograms/ml), no effect on cell doubling time, or H3 or p53 expression was discerned. In contrast, c-myc and c-myb were both upregulated. These results suggested the PF4 inhibited colony formation by impeding cell maturation, as opposed to cell proliferation, perhaps by inducing expression of c-myc and c-myb. The ability of PF4 to inhibit a normal cell maturation function was then tested. Megakaryocytes were incubated in synthetic PF4, or beta-TG peptides for 18 h and effect on Factor V steady-state mRNA levels was determined in 600 individual cells by in situ hybridization. beta-TG peptide had no effect on FV mRNA levels, whereas a approximately 60% decrease in expression of Factor V mRNA was found in megakaryocytes exposed to greater than or equal 100 ng/ml synthetic COOH-terminal PF4 peptide. Accordingly, PF4 modulates megakaryocyte maturation in vitro, and may function as a negative autocrine regulator of human megakaryocytopoiesis.\r"

  ".W": "We have identified two distinct beta-myosin heavy chains (MHCs) present in baboon myocardium by electrophoresis in gradient pore gels and by Western blots with anti-MHC MAb. The two beta-MHCs have molecular masses of 210 and 200 kD and share several antigenic determinants including an epitope recognized by a beta-MHC-specific MAb. A fivefold increase in the level of the 200-kD beta-MHC was observed in the hypertrophied left ventricles of baboons with chronic (5.3 +/- 0.7 yr) renal hypertension. A 60% increase (P less than 0.01) in BP and a 100% increase (P less than 0.001) in left ventricular mass to body weight ratio occurred in hypertensive baboons compared with normotensive animals. The Ca2+-activated myosin ATPase activity in hypertrophied left ventricles was decreased by 35% (P less than 0.05) compared with controls. Normal levels of the 200-kD MHC were detected in the right ventricles and intraventricular septa of the hypertensive animals. These data suggest that cardiac MHCs of primates may exist in alternative molecular forms that are indistinguishable by nondenaturing gel electrophoresis and that increased concentration of a second beta-MHC is associated with ventricular hypertrophy (r = 0.55). The functional significance and mechanisms that control the concentration of beta-MHC subspecies remain to be determined.\r"

  ".W": "We asked this question: in normal humans, is either a normal dietary intake or normal serum concentration of phosphorus a determinant of the serum concentration of 1,25(OH)2D? In seven normal men whose dietary phosphorus was decreased from 2,300 to 625 mg/d, each intake for 8-9 d, under strictly controlled, normal metabolic conditions, we measured serum concentrations of 1,25(OH)2D daily, and concentrations of phosphorus hourly throughout a 24-h period, before and after restriction. Decreasing dietary phosphorus induced: (a) a 58% increase in serum levels of 1,25(OH)2D; (b) a 35% decrease in serum levels of phosphorus measured in the afternoon; (c) a 12% decrease in the 24-h mean serum level of phosphorus; but, (d) no decrease in morning fasting levels of phosphorus. Serum concentrations of 1,25(OH)2D varied inversely and significantly with 24-h mean concentrations of phosphorus (r = -0.77, P less than 0.001). When these data are combined with those of our prior study in which dietary phosphorus was varied over an extreme range, the relationship between serum levels of 1,25(OH)2D and 24-h mean serum levels of phosphorus is even stronger (r = -0.90, P less than 0.001). In the aggregate, the results demonstrate that in normal men, dietary phosphorus throughout a normal range and beyond, can finely regulate the renal production and serum concentration of 1,25(OH)2D, and provide evidence that this regulation is mediated by fine modulation of the serum concentration of phosphorus.\r"

Similar changes were found in the skin chambers. Although there were neutrophils in the control chamber, they were only twice as numerous in the antigen challenged site (P less than 0.01). Eosinophils were 35-fold (P less than or equal to 0.03) more prevalent in the antigen chamber than the control chamber for hours 8-12 and basophils were noted starting in the eighth hour and were 20-fold (P less than or equal to 0.03) more concentrated in the antigen chamber during the next 4 h. The mononuclear cells were not significantly different between antigen and control blisters. With respect to inflammatory mediators, there was an initial peak of histamine (13.2 +/- 2.9 ng/ml) in the blister fluid at 1 h.

  ".W": "Removal of the gallbladder is thought to increase formation and pool size of secondary bile acids, mainly deoxycholic acid (DCA), by increased exposure of primary bile acids (cholic acid [CA], chenodeoxycholic acid [CDCA]) to bacterial dehydroxylation in the intestine. We have tested this hypothesis by simultaneous determination of pool size and turnover of DCA, CA, and CDCA in nine women before and at various intervals after removal of a functioning gallbladder. An isotope dilution technique using marker bile acids labeled with stable isotopes (2H4-DCA, 13C-CA, 13C-CDCA) was used. After cholecystectomy, concentration and output of bile acids relative to bilirubin increased (P less than 0.02) in fasting duodenal bile and cholesterol saturation decreased by 27% (P less than 0.05) consistent with enhanced enterohepatic cycling of bile acids. Three months after removal of the gallbladder bile acid kinetics were in a new steady state: pool size and turnover of CDCA were unchanged. Synthesis of CA, the precursor of DCA, was diminished by 37% (P = 0.05), probably resulting from feedback inhibition by continuous transhepatic flux of bile acids. The fraction of CA transferred after 7 alpha-dehydroxylation to the DCA pool increased from 46 +/- 16 to 66 +/- 32% (P less than 0.05). However, this enhanced transfer did not lead to increased input or size of the DCA pool, because synthesis of the precursor CA had decreased.\r"

This study was undertaken to develop a canine model of chronic atrial hypertrophy and to define in both this group and in normal dogs the regional blood flow response to acute atrial fibrillation and to measure coronary flow reserve. In the 12 dogs with atrial but not ventricular hypertrophy the mean left and right atrial weights were 75 and 47% respectively greater than in the normal group. Blood flow in the normal dogs was less in the appendage than in the non-appendage region for both atria and increased significantly during atrial fibrillation. Similar findings were noted in the hypertrophy group except that during control conditions the left atrial appendage flow was similar to the nonappendage flow. Minimal vascular resistance for the hypertrophy group, 39 +/- 3 was significantly (P less than 0.05) greater when compared to the normal group 28 +/- 2 mmHg/cm3 per min per g. Thus, significant regional blood flow differences occur in both the normal and hypertrophied atria. In addition, atrial hypertrophy does not alter the autoregulatory capacity to the hemodynamic stress of atrial fibrillation but does reduce coronary flow reserve.\r"

In healthy men, mean basal levels of pro-S were 4 pg equivalent S-14/ml; S-14/S-13 combined were 9 pg equivalent S-14/ml; and S-28 levels were 16 pg/ml. After a 700-kcal meal, pro-S, S-14, and S-14/S-13 did not change, whereas S-28 levels doubled by 120 min and remained elevated for 240 min. To evaluate the origins of these peptides, their levels were compared in peripheral, portal, gastric, and mesenteric veins of anesthetized patients and in patients with total resection of stomach and pancreas before and after nutrient intake. The stomach and small intestine were sources of both peptides; however, most S-28 originated in the small intestine. These findings suggest that, in contrast to S-14, S-28 is a hormone and may modulate postprandial nutrient absorption and use.\r"

The cDNA inserts in these clones were 1,852 bases in length combined, and encoded the entire 412-amino acid precursor SCAD (mol wt 44,303). This sequence included the 24-amino acid leader peptide moiety (mol wt 2,576) and 388 amino acids corresponding to the mature protein (mol wt 41,727). The comparison of SCAD and medium chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase sequences revealed a high degree of homology, suggesting that these enzymes evolved from a common ancestral gene and belong to a gene family. We also studied mutant human SCAD in cultured skin fibroblasts from three patients with hereditary SCAD deficiency. Labeling fibroblast cultures with [35S]-methionine followed by immunoprecipitation with anti-SCAD antibody revealed that a normal size variant SCAD protein was synthesized. In all of the three SCAD-deficient cell lines, the size of variant SCAD mRNA as determined by Northern blotting using one of the normal SCAD cDNA as a probe was also normal, and no difference was observed on Southern blots in the restriction patterns of mutant genomic DNA using EcoRI, TaqI, HincII, and BamHI. These results suggest that the defects in SCAD in these cell lines are caused by a point mutation.\r"

Experiments were designed to determine whether dietary protein augmentation directly stimulates albumin synthesis, or whether instead increased albumin synthesis is triggered by the decrease in serum albumin concentration. Evidence is presented that dietary protein augmentation directly stimulates albumin synthesis, accompanied by a proportional increase in steady-state hepatic albumin mRNA concentration (AlbmRNA) and by an increase in AlbmRNA transcription. When the increased albuminuria resulting from dietary protein augmentation is blunted with enalapril, serum albumin concentration is shown to increase in nephrotic rats. Both albumin synthesis and AlbmRNA increase in these animals despite the greater serum albumin concentration. Albumin synthesis correlates inversely with both serum albumin and serum oncotic pressure in nephrotic rats fed 40% protein, but does not correlate with serum albumin concentration in nephrotic rats fed 8.5% protein (LP), even when serum albumin concentration is reduced. Albumin masses are preserved in LP primarily because of reduced albuminuria. Reduced serum oncotic pressure and dietary protein augmentation combine to stimulate albumin synthesis in nephrotic rats at the level of gene transcription.\r"

Using affinity chromatography with potato-tuber carboxypeptidase inhibitor as ligand, mast cell carboxypeptidase was purified to homogeneity from whole skin extracts. The purified enzyme yielded a single staining band of approximately 34,500 D on SDS-PAGE. Carboxypeptidase enzyme content estimated by determination of specific activity, was 0.5, 5, and 16 micrograms/10(6) mast cells from neonatal foreskin, adult facial skin, and adult foreskin, respectively. Human mast cell carboxypeptidase resembled bovine carboxypeptidase A with respect to hydrolysis of synthetic dipeptides and angiotensin I, but was distinguished from carboxypeptidase A in its inability to hydrolyze des-Arg9 bradykinin. The amino acid composition of human mast cell carboxypeptidase was similar to the composition of rat mast cell carboxypeptidase. The amino-terminal amino acid sequence of mast cell carboxypeptidase demonstrated 65% positional identity with human pancreatic carboxypeptidase B, but only 19% with human carboxypeptidase A. Thus, human mast cell carboxypeptidase is a novel member of the protein family of zinc-containing carboxypeptidases, in that it is functionally similar but not identical to bovine carboxypeptidase A, but has structural similarity to bovine and human pancreatic carboxypeptidase B.\r"

TPTX dogs received sufficient calcium carbonate and calcitriol to maintain normal plasma calcium and calcitriol levels, but developed evidence of decreased osteoblast recruitment and activity, including diminished osteoid-covered trabecular bone surface (3.22 +/- 0.21 vs. 10.95 +/- 1.30%) and a decreased osteoblast number (27.8 +/- 8.1 vs. 139.0 +/- 26.0/mm).

Much of the enhanced volume resulted from deposition of poorly mineralized woven bone (9.9 +/- 2.7%). In contrast, biopsies from aluminum-treated TPTX animals exhibited significantly less evidence of ectopic bone formation. In this regard, bone (35.5 +/- 1.7%) and woven tissue volume (1.4 +/- 0.8%) as well as trabecular number (3.3 +/- 0.1/mm) were significantly less than those of the aluminum-treated controls.

The average cytosolic [Ca2+] in various leukocyte populations was measured in Fura 2-loaded cell suspensions while the cytosolic [Ca2+] in individual, Indo 1-loaded leukocytes was assayed by flow cytometric methods. Utilizing normal blood- and marrow-derived cells, human leukemic cell lines, and mononuclear cell fractions derived from the blood of patients with various leukemias, we have found that ATP-induced Ca2+ mobilization appears restricted to leukocytes of neutrophil/monocyte ontogeny. Significant ATP-induced increases in cytosolic [Ca2+] were observed in neutrophils, monocytes, and myeloid progenitor cells as immature as myeloblasts, but not in lymphocytes. Extensive characterization of the ATP-induced changes in [Ca2+] observed in the HL-60 promyelocytic cell line have indicated these Ca2+-mobilizing effects of ATP can be correlated with an activation of inositol phospholipid breakdown via the occupation of P2-purinergic receptors Significantly, of the various agonists (FMLP, platelet-activating factor, LTB4, and ATP) which elicit equivalent and maximal Ca2+ mobilization in mature neutrophils and monocytes, ATP was the most efficacious stimulant of Ca2+ mobilization in immature neutrophil/monocyte precursors. Thus, expression of putative P2-purinergic receptors for ATP appears to precede expression of other receptor types known to activate the inositol phospholipid signaling cascades in terminally differentiated phagocytes.\r"

  ".W": "Approximately 1 out of every 10 eyes undergoing surgery for retinal detachment develops excessive intraocular fibrosis that can lead to traction retinal detachment and ultimate blindness. This disease process has been termed proliferative vitreoretinopathy (PVR). The ability to monitor and grade this fibrotic response accurately within the eye as well as the ability to aspirate vitreous cavity fluid bathing the fibrotic tissue makes this an ideal setting in which to investigate the development of fibrosis. Although laboratory studies have recently shown that transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) can enhance fibrosis, little clinical evidence is yet available correlating the level of this or other growth factors with the degree of fibrosis in a clinical setting. We have found that vitreous aspirates from eyes with intraocular fibrosis associated with PVR have more than three times the amount of TGF-beta (1,200 +/- 300 pM [SEM]) found in eyes with uncomplicated retinal detachments without intraocular fibrosis (360 +/- 91 pM [SEM]). Using an in vitro assay, 84-100% of the TGF-beta activity could be blocked with specific antibodies against TGF-beta 2, whereas only 10-21% could be blocked by specific antibodies against TGF-beta 1. TGF-beta 1 was used in an animal model of traction retinal detachment. Since beta 1 and beta 2 have essentially identical biologic effects and only human beta 1 was available in quantities required, beta 1 was chosen for these in vivo studies.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Addition of inositol to the incubation medium increased polyphosphoinositide turnover in glomeruli from diabetic rats to control values. Despite the reduction in inositol content and polyphosphoinositide turnover, protein kinase C was activated in glomeruli from diabetic rats, as assessed by an increase in the percentage of enzyme activity associated with the particulate cell fraction. Total protein kinase C activity was not different between glomeruli from control and diabetic rats. Treatment of diabetic rats with insulin to achieve near euglycemia prevented the increase in particulate protein kinase C. Moreover, incubation of glomeruli from control rats with glucose (100-1,000 mg/dl) resulted in a progressive increase in labeled diacylglycerol production and in the percentage of protein kinase C activity which was associated with the particulate fraction. These results support a role for hyperglycemia per se in the enhanced state of activation of protein kinase C seen in glomeruli from diabetic rats. Glucose did not appear to increase diacylglycerol by stimulating inositol phospholipid hydrolysis in glomeruli. Other pathways for diacylglycerol production, including de novo synthesis and phospholipase C mediated hydrolysis of phosphatidylcholine or phosphatidyl-inositol-glycan are not excluded.\r"

  ".W": "The role of oxygenation in the pathogenesis of alcoholic liver injury was investigated in six baboons fed alcohol chronically and in six pair-fed controls. All animals fed alcohol developed fatty liver with, in addition, fibrosis in three. No evidence for hypoxia was found, both in the basal state and after ethanol at moderate (30 mM) or high (55 mM) levels, as shown by unchanged or even increased hepatic venous partial pressure of O2 and O2 saturation of hemoglobin in the tissue. In controls, ethanol administration resulted in enhanced O2 consumption (offset by a commitant increase in splanchnic blood flow), whereas in alcohol fed animals, there was no increase. At the moderate ethanol dose, the flow-independent O2 extraction, measured by reflectance spectroscopy on the liver surface, tended to increase in control animals only, whereas a significant decrease was observed after the high ethanol dose in the alcohol-treated baboons. This was associated with a marked shift in the mitochondrial redox level in the alcohol-fed (but not in control) baboons, with striking rises in splanchnic output of glutamic dehydrogenase and acetaldehyde, reflecting mitochondrial injury. Increased acetaldehyde, in turn, may aggravate the mitochondrial damage and exacerbate defective O2 utilization. Thus impaired O2 consumption rather than lack of O2 supply characterizes liver injury produced by high ethanol levels in baboons fed alcohol chronically.\r"

The expressed channel, studied by whole-cell voltage clamp, reveals characteristic selectivity for sodium as the permeant ion, voltage-dependent gating, and block by nanomolar concentrations of tetrodotoxin. Such channels are not seen in control oocytes injected with solvent only. The anticonvulsant diphenylhydantoin (DPH) inhibits the expressed channel in a voltage- and use-dependent manner, much like the effect seen in primary mammalian neuronal preparations. The inhibition of the expressed human sodium channel by DPH can be described by models previously developed to explain block of Na channels by local anesthetics. The preferential block of Na channels during depolarization helps explain the selectivity of DPH for neurons involved in seizure activity.\r"

A group of patients with respiratory or cardiovascular disturbances and negative blood culture had 253 +/- 74, accessible receptors per platelet (n = 19 samples from 16 patients, P less than 0.01 as compared to septic patients, which was not significantly different when compared to control individuals). Patients with sepsis possessed significant amounts of PAF associated to their platelets, whereas this mediator could not be isolated from platelets of patients with respiratory or cardiovascular disturbances and negative blood culture, nor from platelets of control individuals. PAF was also assayed in whole blood samples and found at high concentrations in sepsis patients. These data indicate that occupancy of PAF receptors in combination with high amounts of platelet-associated PAF, is a common finding in patients with sepsis.\r"

In this study we explored factors controlling the frequency of clones of varying replicative capacities (clonal composition). We also explored the relationship between this frequency and fat depot growth. In perirenal and epididymal depots clonal composition was identical bilaterally; perirenal depots contained more extensively replicating clones. Although there were large interanimal differences in clonal composition, variation between animals was always in the same direction for both depots. Clonal composition was unaffected by undernutrition while with animal growth the frequency of the most extensively replicating clones was reduced. Differentiation of precursors occurred in all clones, while differentiation did not occur in skin fibroblasts cloned under identical conditions. Clonal composition and mature fat cell number were related in that fat cell numbers were identical bilaterally in both depots and increased more extensively with growth in perirenal than epididymal tissue. We conclude (a) that clonal composition of adipocyte precursor populations is regulated genetically and by age, (b) that this composition determines, at least in part, the capacity for adipose depot growth.\r"

  ".W": "Expression of transforming growth factor alpha (TGF alpha), and transforming growth factor beta (TGF beta) was assessed in isolated primary rat intestinal epithelial cells as well as a rat intestinal crypt cell-derived cell line (IEC-6). A gradient in TGF beta was present, with high concentrations of a 2.5-kb transcript found in undifferentiated crypt cells and progressively lower amounts of the TGF beta transcript in increasingly differentiated villus cell populations. In contrast, the concentration of 4.5-kb TGF alpha transcript was higher in differentiated villus cells than in mitotically active, undifferentiated populations of crypt epithelial cells. The concentrations of transforming growth factors alpha and beta as determined by radioreceptor binding inhibition assay and direct assessment of transforming growth factor biological activity correlated with Northern blot analysis. Although gradients in the expression of the TGFs were present, equivalent binding was observed in the different intestinal cell populations when assessed with 125I-TGF beta and 125I-EGF (TGF alpha). No EGF transcripts were detected in any intestinal cell population, suggesting that the true ligand of the EGF receptor was TGF alpha. IEC-6 cells expressed both TGF alpha and TGF beta transcripts. In addition to the transcripts identified in the primary intestinal cells, this cell line contained an additional larger TGF alpha transcript (4.8 kb) and smaller TGF beta transcripts (2.2 and 1.8 kb). TGF alpha and TGF beta may play a significant role in the regulation of the balance between proliferative and differentiated cell compartments in the intestinal epithelium through both autocrine and paracrine mechanisms.\r"

The purpose of this study was to determine if vasodilator drugs that generate nitric oxide inhibit vascular smooth muscle mitogenesis and proliferation in culture. Three chemically dissimilar vasodilators, sodium nitroprusside, S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine and isosorbide dinitrate, dose-dependently inhibited serum-induced thymidine incorporation by rat aortic smooth muscle cells. Moreover, 8-bromo-cGMP mimicked the antimitogenic effect of the nitric oxide-generating drugs. The antimitogenic effect of S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine was inhibited by hemoglobin and potentiated by superoxide dismutase, supporting the view that nitric oxide was the ultimate effector. Sodium nitroprusside and S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine significantly decreased the proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells. Moreover, the inhibition of mitogenesis and proliferation was shown to be independent of cell damage, as documented by several criteria of cell viability. These results suggest that endogenous nitric oxide may function as a modulator of vascular smooth muscle cell mitogenesis and proliferation, by a cGMP-mediated mechanism.\r"

  ".W": "The human platelet alloantigens, PlA1 and PlA2, comprise a diallelic antigen system located on a component of the platelet fibrinogen receptor, membrane glycoprotein (GP) IIIa. Of the known platelet alloantigens, PlA1, which is carried by 98% of the caucasian population, appears to be the alloantigen that most often provokes neonatal alloimmune thrombocytopenic purpura and posttransfusion purpura. The structural features of the GPIIIa molecule responsible for its antigenicity are as yet unknown. Using the polymerase chain reaction (PcR), we amplified the NH2-terminal region of platelet GPIIIa mRNA derived from PlA1 and PlA2 homozygous individuals. Nucleotide sequence analysis of selected amplified cDNA products revealed a C in equilibrium T polymorphism at base 196 that created a unique Nci I restriction enzyme cleavage site in the PlA2, but not the PlA1 form of GPIIIa cDNA. Subsequent restriction enzyme analysis of cDNAs generated by PcR from 10 PlA1/A1, 5 PlA2/A2, and 3 PlA1/A2 individuals showed that Nci I digestion permitted clear discrimination between the PlA1 and PlA2 alleles of GPIIIa. All PlA2/A2 individuals studied contain a C at base 196, whereas PlA1 homozygotes have a T at this position. This single base change results in a leucine/proline polymorphism at amino acid 33 from the NH2-terminus, and is likely to impart significant differences in the secondary structures of these two allelic forms of the GPIIIa molecule. The ability to perform DNA-typing analysis for PlA phenotype may have a number of useful clinical applications, including fetal testing and determination of the phenotype of severely thrombocytopenic individuals.\r"

Baseline Fe1 d I content ranged from 7.8 Food and Drug Administration units per gram of dust to 436.7 U/gm (median 61.2 U/gm), consistent with levels found in homes with a pet cat. Fe1 d I levels declined gradually in most homes, and by 20 to 24 weeks after cat removal, eight of 15 reached levels consistent with levels found in control homes without cats. In two of those homes, allergen levels fell much more rapidly after aggressive environmental control measures were undertaken. In the other seven homes, however, the decline occurred at a much slower rate, with three homes demonstrating persistent elevations in Fe1 d I content for 20 or more weeks. These data demonstrate that the task of allergen elimination from an indoor environment is extremely difficult, even when the source of a specific allergen can be identified and removed.\r"

Basophil SHR in patients with asthma not receiving medication was significantly greater than that in patients with asthma receiving medication (p less than 0.05). SHR from basophils in NAMS subjects was similar to that in normal subjects. SHR was highly dependent on temperature and Ca++ and Mg++ ions and appeared to be a slower event than anaphylactic release. The mean histamine content per basophil from normal subjects was 1.48 +/- 0.13 pg (mean +/- SEM). Basophils from subjects with asthma contained significantly less histamine than basophils from normal subjects (p less than 0.002). Histamine content per basophil from NAMS subjects was slightly lower than histamine content per normal basophil. No apparent relationship was found between the magnitude of SHR and the histamine content per basophil in the patients with asthma not receiving medication. Hypersensitivity to food or exercise does not appear to be essential for high SHR. High SHR appears to bear little, if any, relationship to cell damage or cell death.

There were no systemic reactions and no clinically significant changes in routine laboratory parameters, including hepatic and renal functions, with injections. There were significant rises in IgG titers by ELISA to each grass-pollen allergen administered, orchard, timothy, and Bermuda, and in total antibody binding of antigen E. Changes in IgE against orchard, timothy, Bermuda, and antigen E were minor. Thus, IPG and PRW administered concomitantly in accelerated dosage schedules are safe and immunogenic in patients with dual inhalant sensitivities.\r"

  ".W": "Highly atopic infants often form IgE antibodies toward multiple food protein in the first 2 years of life. They begin producing IgE antibody to inhalant allergens between the first and second year of life. We hypothesized that highly atopic children would be at significant risk of sensitization to peanut. We defined high atopy as serum IgE greater than or equal to 10 times 1 SD from normal plus multiple positive RASTs. In this study we have characterized the immunologic status of 141 patients by measuring total serum IgE and specific IgE to several allergens, including peanut. These data demonstrated that, independent of clinical history, a positive RAST to peanut was more common in the highly atopic category compared to the low atopy category. Significantly more patients who were highly atopic and had a positive peanut RAST had a positive RAST for egg or milk compared to low atopic patients. More significantly, 33 of the patients had never knowingly received peanut, yet 21 (63.6%) had a positive RAST for peanut, whereas seven (21.2%) had a peanut antibody in the highest RAST category. All these seven patients were considered highly atopic according to the definition above, and three were younger than 2 years of age. These results suggest that highly atopic infants are at special risk for sensitization to peanut, even when they have never received peanut, and that characterization of immunologic sensitization to milk, egg, and peanut will identify the highly atopic infant.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Azelastine has previously been demonstrated to inhibit histamine release, to antagonize histamine-mediated responses, and to be a bronchodilator. To determine the mechanism by which azelastine has antihistaminic and bronchodilatory actions, we studied its interaction with relevant human lung receptors. We performed competitive radioligand binding assays and determined the affinity of azelastine for [3H]pyrilamine (histamine H1), [125I]pindolol (beta), and [3H]quinuclidinyl benzilate (muscarinic) binding sites. Azelastine had a relatively high affinity for histamine H1 receptors with IC50 values consistently as low or lower than values measured for other antihistamines. In contrast, azelastine had a very low affinity for both beta-receptors and muscarinic receptors with IC50 values greater than 2 logs greater than those determined for beta-agonists and muscarinic antagonists, respectively. Thus, bronchodilatory activity of azelastine does not appear to result from either beta-agonist or muscarinic-antagonist properties. Azelastine does, however, have the ability to inhibit the release of histamine and to bind to histamine H1 receptors, thereby effectively antagonizing histamine H1 receptor-mediated responses in the lung. These characteristics make azelastine a potentially very useful drug to treat allergic responses in the respiratory tract.\r"

With Air Sentinels in the bedroom and living room for airborne collections, and a Sample Vac for collections from living room carpet and bedroom mattress, immunochemical quantifications of each were made with various radiometric assays with polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies. The most significant correlations were found between airborne mite in the bedroom and living room (p less than 0.001) and airborne mite in the bedroom and dust from the bedroom mattress (p less than 0.001). Most houses had specific epitopes of both Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus and D. farinae, but D. farinae was present in greater amounts. In seven houses we found greater than 10 micrograms of group I mite allergen per gram of settled dust, indicating that some houses in Minnesota have concentrations of mite allergens high enough to cause allergic disease, even in the winter. Clinical interpretation of these data on air levels is hampered by uncertainty as to whether symptoms are more closely related to average steady-state exposure, which we measured, or to brief heavy concentrations. Further epidemiologic studies are needed to define the concentration of mite and cat allergens in the air that are risk factors for allergic disease. The concentration of cat allergen correlated with mite allergen in the air, but not in settled dust, presumably reflecting the fact that both are influenced by ventilation rate.\r"

This is true even though in previous studies, 32% of atopic patients with respiratory allergies were skin test reactive to basidiospore extracts. Since sufficient quantities of Calvatia cyathiformis spores were available, their allergens were sequentially fractionated by gel filtration (GF) and hydrophobic interaction chromatography (HIC). Unfractionated extract (crude), GF, and HIC fractions were electrofocused in polyacrylamide gel (pH 3.5 to 9.5) and immunoprinted onto CNBr-activated nitrocellulose (0.2 microns) filters. Sera from 19 skin prick test positive and 10 negative subjects, with comparable total IgE levels, were used to screen individual strips of each blot. Blots were reacted with 125I-labeled anti-IgE and analyzed by autoradiography. IgE from 79%, 89%, and 89% of the positive sera bound to crude extract, GF, and HIC, respectively; IgE from none of the negative sera bound to crude extract. A series of bands (pH 3.6 to 4.6) reacted with 63%, one band (pH 6.6) reacted with 68%, and one band (pH 9.3) reacted with 63% of the sera tested. These studies demonstrate at least three important groups of allergens in C. cyathiformis spores. This characterization allows assignment of initial C. cyathiformis allergen designations and development of a purification protocol.\r"

The product contained a mixture of entomophilous and anemophilous pollens to which the patient was skin test positive. An open challenge with the bee pollen later reproduced the presenting symptoms with a concomitant rise of the eosinophil count from 207 to 890 cells per cubic millimeter. The patient has since remained well avoiding bee pollen. This study strongly suggests that hypereosinophilia with attendant pathophysiologic disturbances may be an adverse reaction to bee-pollen ingestion in atopic individuals.\r"

It also appears that potent standardized extracts may be more often involved in the generation of SRs than other extracts. Since these SRs may be potentially life threatening, it is desirable to predict their onset. A prospective study was carried out in 125 mite-allergic subjects with asthma ranging in age from 4 to 57 years to assess the incidence of SRs during a rush immunotherapy (RIT) protocol and maintenance injections and to attempt to predict the onset of the SRs. All patients received the same standardized extract of Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus with the same RIT and the same maintenance dose (3000 BU in subjects older than 10 years and 1500 BU in children younger than 10 years). Patients were carefully monitored during the RIT protocol, and possible SRs were followed for up to 2 hours after injections. Patients then received maintenance injections for a mean duration of 18.2 +/- 5.6 months. During maintenance injections, patients were under supervision of a physician for 30 minutes. Within 2 weeks before the RIT, all patients older than 6 years had a pulmonary function test, skin prick test end point with the standardized D. pteronyssinus extract, and RAST. The severity of asthma was examined with the score of Aas. Forty-seven patients had an SR during the RIT protocol: four mild generalized urticaria, 35 asthma exacerbations, and eight anaphylactic shocks. None of the patients had to be admitted to an intensive care unit. Most SRs started within 15 minutes, and none of the SRs started 45 minutes or later after the last injection.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Mediators specifically involved in EM are not well characterized; its pathogenesis remains enigmatic. In this study, evidence for participation of kinins in the pathophysiology of inflammation in EM was investigated by assessing cleavage of high-molecular-weight kininogen (HMWK) in plasma. These data were compared with analyses of plasmas from patients with serum sickness, chronic idiopathic urticaria/angioedema, and from normal control subjects. Patients with EM demonstrated significant levels of circulating cleaved HMWK in plasma during active disease (p less than 0.01), which declined during remission/recovery. Plasmas from patients with EM obtained during active disease also demonstrated significant levels of 94 kd C1 inhibitor (p less than 0.01) and C1 inhibitor-kallikrein complexes. Patients with serum sickness and chronic idiopathic urticaria/angioedema did not demonstrate these findings and did not differ from normal control subjects (p = not significant). Although the kininogenase responsible for HMWK cleavage in EM has not been conclusively demonstrated, these findings suggest that HMWK cleavage resulted from activation of the contact system and that some of the manifestations of EM in selected patients may in part be accounted for by inflammatory and proinflammatory actions of kinins. Based on these preliminary findings, it will be important to establish whether or not HMWK cleavage in EM is a general finding in patients with this disorder. Further investigation is needed to characterize more clearly kininogenase activity and elucidate the possible role of kinin generation in EM.\r"

All patients with pruritus had a small papaverine skin test response, and mean values were significantly (p less than 0.0001, Mann-Whitney U test) smaller in patients with pruritus. All patients with pruritus entered in a crossover, double-blind trial with nicergoline. In a first period of six dialyses, they received either nicergoline (daily oral dose, 30 mg, and intravenous dose during dialyses, 5 mg) or placebo. In the second period of six dialyses, patients received the crossover treatment. Nicergoline was effective in 13/15 patients, eight of these patients having a complete remission of pruritus. When nicergoline was stopped, patients relapsed within 24 to 48 hours. All patients who improved during the trial were then treated with a daily dose of 30 mg of nicergoline for 6 months. Seven patients had a complete remission, five had moderate symptoms, and one patient relapsed. This study demonstrated that some hemodialyzed patients with pruritus of unknown etiology had improvement with nicergoline.\r"

Cell counts and antibody concentrations were measured in serum, and bronchoalveolar fluid (BAF) samples and values were compared with data from previous periods of symptomatic exacerbations. During the asymptomatic exacerbation, concentrations of antibody to Aspergillus fumigatus, total IgE, and precipitating antibodies were elevated in peripheral blood. No quantitative differences in specific antibody concentrations (IgE, IgG, IgA, and IgM) against A. fumigatus were found between sera from symptomatic and asymptomatic periods of ABPA. In contrast to observations in the serum, protein concentrations in BAL fluid were normal during the asymptomatic period, whereas high concentrations were found during the symptomatic phases. Local antibody concentrations (in BAF) were characterized by high levels of IgA antibodies against A. fumigatus. During asymptomatic and symptomatic phases, eosinophils were elevated in peripheral blood, in sputum, in BAF, and highly elevated in tissue biopsy specimens. Activated eosinophils were found, as indicated by the presence of light-density cells in the circulation and monoclonal antieosinophil cationic protein binding to bronchoalveolar lavage eosinophils. In contrast to the symptomatic phase of ABPA in 1980, demonstrating aspecific airway reactivity to several pharmacologically active substances, no such hyperreactivity was found during the asymptomatic phase of ABPA in 1986. It is proposed that the asymptomatic infiltrative phase of ABPA is an intermediate stage that can develop into a symptomatic phase after prolonged and intensified infiltration of eosinophils. Mediators from the inflammatory cells may be involved in the induction of bronchial hyperresponsiveness. After induction of this hyperreactive stage of the airways, additional liberation of mediators from either eosinophils and/or mast cells will lead to a symptomatic (obstructive) phase of ABPA.\r"

A new murine mAb termed 515 recognizes a 85- to 90-kDa structure involved in lymphocyte binding to specialized endothelium in postcapillary venules of lymphoid organs (high endothelial venules). In crossed immunoprecipitations followed by SDS-PAGE analysis, 515 appears to be identical to the antilymphocyte homing receptor mAb, Hermes-1. We show here that 515 recognizes peripheral blood leukocytes of all classes examined, but, like Hermes-1, fails to recognize germinal center cells or nearly all cortical (but not medullary) thymocytes. In addition, we demonstrate that 515 recognizes both fibroblasts and epidermal keratinocytes, both in situ and in cultured cell lines. Immunoprecipitation and SDS-PAGE analysis reveals that 515-defined Ag from T lymphocytes, neutrophils, and the epidermal keratinocyte cell line HaCaT are clearly distinct, both before and after treatment with peptide N-glycosidase F, which removes all asparagine-linked oligosaccharides. In contrast, the Mr of 515-defined Ag from T cells and fibroblasts appear indistinguishable. Thus, the 515 mAb recognizes a broadly distributed family of glycoproteins which may be involved in a variety of adhesive functions.\r"

  ".W": "Fine specificity and H and L chain isotypes of insulin autoantibodies in sera from 11 subjects were examined. None of these 11 subjects was treated with exogenous insulin. Two patterns of fine specificity were found. In one, the autoantibodies were specific for human insulin, with a requirement for threonine at B30. The conservative substitution in pork insulin (threonine to alanine) abrogated IgG binding by these sera. Insulin autoantibodies in other sera cross-reacted with beef, pork, and human insulin; not requiring threonine at B30. Reciprocal competitive inhibition experiments showed that epitopes recognized by the human specific insulin autoantibodies were exclusively on the B chain, whereas the cross-reactive sera contain autoantibodies that recognize both the B chain and combinatorial (A and B chain) epitopes. The fine specificity of cross-reactive insulin autoantibodies are thus similar to insulin antibodies from insulin-treated subjects. When IgG subclasses and L chains of insulin autoantibodies were examined, however, restricted C region usage was found. The hierarchy was IgG3 greater than G1 greater than G2 greater than G4; with one subclass dominant in each serum, although others were used. L chain use was similarly restricted. There was no correlation between isotype and fine specificity or between H and L chain type. It is concluded that heterogeneity of insulin autoantibodies is restricted. The response is probably more oligo- or pauciclonal than insulin antibody from insulin-treated subjects.\r"

This report demonstrates that two cytokines which may be derived from monocyte-macrophage populations, namely platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), stimulate the DNA synthesis and proliferation of human synovial fibroblast-like cells cultured in low (i.e., 1%) fetal bovine serum. Epidermal growth factor, insulin-like growth factor-I, insulin-like growth factor-II (multiplication stimulating activity) and substance P were inactive. Unlike IL-1, PDGF and FGF do not also stimulate PGE2, plasminogen activator, and hyaluronic acid levels. Thus PDGF and FGF, arising from stimulated monocyte-macrophages, may play a role in the stimulation of mesenchymal cell proliferation that often accompanies chronic inflammatory arthritic disease. The synovial cells respond to a variety of cytokines in different ways suggesting multiple-signaling pathways.\r"

Finally, a mAb to human CR1 (E11) recognized epitopes on E of a variety of nonhuman primates, including baboons. SDS-PAGE analysis of biochemically purified baboon E membrane fractions reactive with E11 demonstrated a 65-kDa protein as a major component. Affinity absorption and elution experiments verified this protein to be E11 reactive as well as a C3b binding protein. E surface radiolabeling, followed by C3i affinity purification, confirmed that this 65-kDa protein is the only C3b-binding protein present on the baboon E membrane. We postulate that the baboon E 65-kDa protein is the equivalent of the human E CR1. In addition, there appear to be antigenic similarities between the baboon E 65-kDa protein and the human E CR1.\r"

  ".W": "Quinoline-3-carboxamide (LS 2616) is a broadly acting immunostimulator with anti-inflammatory effects in Coxsackie virus B3-induced myocarditis in female BALB/c mice. This infection caused extensive inflammatory and necrotic lesions in the myocardium 7 days after inoculation (6.8% of tissue section area). The damaged area was reduced (to 3.7% (p less than 0.05] and the lethality decreased when LS 2616 was administered over 14 days, starting 7 days before the inoculation. The response pattern of lymphocyte subsets in situ in myocardial inflammatory lesions was elucidated by a newly developed immune histochemical staining technique. LS 2616 increased the number of class II-expressing cells 3-fold (p less than 0.01) and the CTL, Ts:Th cell ratio by 55% (p less than 0.05), whereas Lyt-1+ and TIB+ cells were unaffected. After 7 days of LS 2616 treatment, spleen lymphocyte activity tended to increase (T cells by 21% (NS) and B cells by 60% (p less than 0.05), respectively). The activity of NK cells increased by 51% (p less than 0.01). LS 2616 may thus have potential in therapy of human inflammatory disorders, such as myocarditis.\r"

Hybridization was seen with three class I DNA probes, the strongest being seen with the probe pC800, which corresponds to an 800-bp section of the Cw3 gene. We have made cDNA libraries from BeWo cells and screened for positive clones by using class I DNA probes. Of the clones isolated, we determined the complete sequence of one and partial sequence of five shorter clones. They all code for an identical C locus-related product, which does not correspond to published C locus sequences.\r"

  ".W": "We have studied the relationship between MHC-restricted, Ag-specific recognition and TCR structure in a panel of seven Th-hybridomas specific for the foreign protein Ag, hen egg-white lysozyme, and the I-Ak class II MHC molecule. The fine specificity of these Th cells had been determined previously by their reactivity to a panel of APC lines bearing mutant I-Ak molecules and to proteolytic fragments of HEL. TCR gene segment composition was determined by cDNA cloning and DNA sequencing. A heterogeneous, yet repetitive usage of gene segments was observed within the panel. The same V alpha C10-J alpha MD13 rearrangement was used in three of the hybridomas, two with identical Ag and MHC-restriction fine specificities. The prevalent usage of the V beta 14 gene segment and members of J beta 2 cluster was noted. Inasmuch as gene segment usage did not correlate with MHC-restriction or Ag fine specificity alone, these results favor an interactive Ag model of T-cell recognition, in which Ag and MHC are recognized as a bimolecular complex.\r"
