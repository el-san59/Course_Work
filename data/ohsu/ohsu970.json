  ".W": "The Caerphilly Collaborative Heart Disease Study is based on a large cohort of men (2,398) aged 49-66 years at the time of study. Platelet aggregation induced by collagen, thrombin, and ADP was measured in fasting blood samples and was related to prevalent angina, past myocardial infarction, and electrocardiographic evidence of ischemic heart disease. A number of subjects had taken aspirin, other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or other drugs affecting platelet aggregation 7 days before blood sample collection; after the exclusion of these subjects, data were available for 1,811 men. No relations were demonstrated with angina, but significant relations were shown between past myocardial infarctions and electrocardiographic evidence of ischemia and ADP-induced aggregation (both primary and secondary) and between electrocardiographic evidence of ischemia and thrombin-induced aggregation. The strongest relation indicated more than a twofold increase in the odds of a past myocardial infarction in subjects of the highest fifth of ADP-induced primary platelet aggregation compared with the lowest fifth. No significant relations were detected with collagen-induced aggregation. Accounting for a number of possible confounding factors had a relatively small impact on the relations between platelet aggregation and ischemic heart disease. Other evidence, including the well-established effect of aspirin on reducing the incidence of ischemic heart disease, indicates that the relations we describe are unlikely to be simply an effect of IHD on platelets.\r"

The difference in men could result either from a lower incidence of cardiovascular disease or a lower case fatality rate among Mexican-Americans. Although the incidence of cardiovascular disease in Mexican-Americans is unknown, we have collected data on prevalence of myocardial infarction in 5,148 individuals examined in the San Antonio Heart Study, a population-based survey of cardiovascular disease conducted between 1979 and 1988 in Mexican-Americans and non-Hispanic whites aged 25-64 years. Myocardial infarction was assessed by Minnesota-coded electrocardiograms and by a self-reported history of a physician-diagnosed heart attack. For both end points, the age-adjusted prevalence of myocardial infarction was lower in Mexican-American men than in non-Hispanic white men. After adjustment for age and diabetes status (present/absent), the odds of a myocardial infarction, as defined by either criterion, was approximately one third lower in Mexican-American men than in non-Hispanic white men (p = 0.06). In women, the prevalence of both myocardial infarction end points was slightly higher in Mexican-Americans than in non-Hispanic whites, although neither of these differences was significant. Although the ethnic differences in prevalence in this study were not statistically significant, their pattern parallels the pattern in the mortality due to cardiovascular diseases. Therefore, the results support the hypothesis that the reduced cardiovascular mortality rate observed in Mexican-American men reflects a lower incidence of myocardial infarction rather than a reduced case fatality rate because the latter would result in a higher prevalence.\r"

  ".W": "The Multicenter Diltiazem Postinfarction Trial (MDPIT) reported no consistent diltiazem effect on new or worsened congestive heart failure (CHF) during 12-52 months' follow-up after acute myocardial infarction. This was puzzling in light of the observation that patients with findings suggesting left ventricular dysfunction (LVD) at baseline on diltiazem had more cardiac events (cardiac mortality or recurrent nonfatal infarction) than such patients on placebo. We hypothesized that diltiazem increased the frequency of late CHF as well as of cardiac events, but only in patients predisposed by LVD. Using the same characterizing variables as the primary MDPIT analysis, we found that patients with pulmonary congestion, anterolateral Q wave infarction, or reduced ejection fraction (EF) at baseline were more likely to have CHF during follow-up than those without these markers of LVD. CHF was particularly frequent in the patients with LVD who were randomized to diltiazem. Among those with a baseline EF of less than 0.40, late CHF appeared in 12% (39/326) receiving placebo and 21% (61/297) receiving diltiazem (p = 0.004). Life table analysis in patients with an EF of less than 0.40 confirmed more frequent late CHF in those taking diltiazem (p = 0.0017). In addition, the diltiazem-associated rise in the frequency of late CHF was progressively greater with increasingly severe decrements in baseline EF. This diltiazem effect was absent in patients with pulmonary congestion at baseline but an EF of 0.40 or more, suggesting a unique association between diltiazem-related late CHF and systolic LVD.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

To assess the potential of transesophageal echocardiography in evaluating CBFV and its variations induced by coronary-active drugs, we studied 15 patients by high-quality pulsed wave Doppler recordings of CBFV. In these patients, transesophageal Doppler evaluation of CBFV was performed before, 2 minutes after cessation of dipyridamole infusion (0.56 mg/kg in 4 minutes), and 2 minutes after aminophylline infusion (240 mg injected 4 minutes after cessation of dipyridamole infusion). The following CBFV parameters were evaluated at each of the three steps of the study protocol: maximal and mean diastolic velocities and maximal and mean systolic velocities. Furthermore, the following indexes of coronary flow reserve were evaluated: the ratio between maximal diastolic velocity recorded after and before dipyridamole administration and the ratio between mean diastolic velocity recorded after and before dipyridamole administration. Nine of the 15 patients had a normal left anterior descending coronary artery (group A), whereas the remaining six had significant (less than or equal to 75%) stenosis (group B). In group A patients, all CBFV parameters increased significantly during dipyridamole infusion and returned to near baseline values after aminophylline infusion. In group B patients, on the other hand, none of the CBFV parameters increased after dipyridamole infusion. Dipyridamole/baseline maximal diastolic velocity and mean diastolic velocity ratios were, respectively, 3.22 +/- 0.96 and 3.04 +/- 0.88 in group A and 1.46 +/- 0.45 (p less than 0.01 versus group A) and 1.48 +/- 0.49 (p less than 0.01 versus group A) in group B patients.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Diagnoses were subsequently proven by surgery, autopsy, computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, or angiography in all patients. All patients underwent precordial and transesophageal two-dimensional echocardiography to assess the various mass detection rates. Atrial myxomas and predominantly left-sided cardiac tumors were identified by both echocardiographic techniques with comparable detection rates. Left ventricular apical thrombi were detected more frequently by precordial echocardiography. In contrast, transesophageal echocardiography was superior in visualizing left atrial appendage thrombi, small and flat thrombi in the left atrial cavity, thrombi and tumors in the superior vena cava, and masses attached to the right heart and the descending thoracic aorta. These data indicate that transesophageal echocardiography leads to a clinically relevant improvement of the diagnostic potential in patients in whom cardiac masses are suspected or have to be excluded in order to ensure the safety of clinical procedures.\r"

This study compared regurgitant jet areas by Doppler color flow imaging derived from the newer transesophageal approach with measurements obtained from conventional transthoracic apical views. Maximal regurgitant jet area determinations and an overall visual estimate of lesion severity were obtained from 42 patients who underwent color flow examination by both techniques. Seventy-three regurgitant lesions were visualized by transesophageal flow imaging: 34 mitral, 22 aortic, and 17 tricuspid jets. Transthoracic studies in the same patients revealed fewer regurgitant lesions for each valve; 20 mitral, 16 aortic, and 12 tricuspid (p = 0.0009). A comparison of maximal jet areas determined by transesophageal and transthoracic studies showed a good overall correlation (r = 0.85, SEE = 2.8 cm2) and a systematic overestimation by the transesophageal technique (TEE = 0.96 TTX + 2.7). For the subgroup with mitral insufficiency, valve lesions visualized by both techniques were larger by the transesophageal approach (n = 18, 6.0 versus 3.6 cm2, p = 0.008). Semiquantitative visual grading of individual valve lesions by two independent observers revealed a higher grade of regurgitation with more jets classified as mild (38 versus 25), moderate (18 versus 13), and severe (17 versus 10) by esophageal imaging than by transthoracic imaging. Thus, transesophageal color flow mapping techniques yield a higher prevalence of valvular regurgitation than do transthoracic techniques in the same patients. Jet area and the overall estimate of regurgitant lesion severity were also greater by transesophageal color Doppler imaging compared with standard transthoracic imaging.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Training consisted of endurance exercise 4 +/- 0.3 days per week for 11.8 +/- 2.5 months at a progressively increasing intensity of 60-80% of maximal O2 uptake (Vo2max) with additional brief bouts of exercise equal to 93 +/- 13% of Vo2max. Vo2max increased from 29.6 +/- 4.1 to 37.2 +/- 5.7 ml/kg/min (p less than 0.001). Percent body fat was decreased (17.8 +/- 3.6% versus 15.6 +/- 3.6%; p less than 0.001). Before training, left ventricular ejection fraction, determined by electrocardiographic-gated equilibrium blood pool imaging, increased only modestly during exercise (from 66.3 +/- 6.7% at rest to 70.6 +/- 6.9% at peak exercise). After training, the increase in ejection fraction during exercise was significantly greater (from 67 +/- 4.8% at rest to 77.6 +/- 7.5% at peak exercise) than that observed before training and was similar to that in young sedentary men (64 +/- 7% at rest versus 74 +/- 9% at peak exercise). Although the changes in systolic pressure from rest to exercise were similar, end-systolic volume decreased significantly at peak exercise after (51 +/- 12 versus 38 +/- 13 ml; p less than 0.005) but not before (46 +/- 8 versus 43 +/- 13 ml; p = NS) training with a shift in the end-systolic volume-systolic blood pressure relation to the left compatible with enhanced inotropic state.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Ionizing radiation was used to treat childhood cancer long before the advent of chemotherapy, and it took little time for physicians to appreciate the deleterious effects it had on skeletal growth. The cause of this complication results predominantly from alteration of chondroblastic activity. This may stem directly from irradiation at the epiphyseal plate or indirectly from irradiation of glands that secrete growth-mediating hormones. The complication can go far beyond the obvious physical afflictions and extend into the psychologic domain, rendering deeper, more permanent scars. Presently, many of these effects are predictable, reducible, and treatable without compromising the cure that so often depends on the use of irradiation. Because of the complexities of childhood cancer therapy, strategies aimed at diminishing these effects are challenging. It is imperative that these effects be understood so that they can be reduced in current patients and prevented in future patients.\r"

A limb-length discrepancy in the humerus may cause minor cosmetic problems but does not generally result in a significant functional deficit. In the lower extremity, tumors about the knee, including the distal femur and proximal tibia, usually present the dilemma of whether limb salvage by arthrodesis, osteoarticular allograft, or endoprosthetic replacement would result in a significant limb-length inequality and whether amputation of the extremity is a preferable procedure. The techniques of rotationplasty and an expandable endoprosthesis have been successfully used for treating skeletally immature patients with osteosarcoma of the distal femur. With regard to survival and function, the results obtained with these innovative methods are favorable compared with those of a high above-knee amputation.\r"

Abnormalities in growth factor production or response tend to inappropriately activate cell growth. Tumor cell DNA content and cytogenetics may affect the diagnosis and prognostic grouping of osteosarcomas. In Ewing's sarcomas, a characteristic translocation between Chromosomes 11 and 22 has been identified; this translocation is also found in malignant neuroepitheliomas. A variety of studies point to both neuroectodermal and mesenchymal origins for Ewing's sarcomas. Applications of new biologic knowledge and technology to clinical problems will lead to significant changes in the diagnosis, and perhaps in the treatment, of these tumors in the coming years.

Spontaneous hemarthrosis of the shoulder includes rapid onset of severe pain, limitation of movement, subsequent appearance of a bruise on the affected shoulder and arm, and radiological evidence of joint degeneration. Hemosiderotic synovitis results from chronic intraarticular bleeding. With the breakdown of trapped hemoglobin, iron-containing hemosiderin is stored in synovial tissue producing rusty discoloration and proliferative reaction. The classic cytoarchitecture of PVS has additional subsynovial nodular proliferation of mononuclear cells. Hemarthrosis may produce significant structural alteration of joints. Its prompt recognition and the awareness of underlying causes should lead to earlier diagnosis, appropriate therapy, less joint destruction, and better outcomes.\r"

The two cases presented here demonstrate the difficulty in eradicating the organism even with modern regimens of chemotherapy. Intraoperative Gram's stain and frozen sections were useful to rule out other etiologies. Firm diagnosis must be established by tissue culture. The first case appeared cured after thorough initial debridement and had no recurrence for 36 years. While recurrences are common in patients treated with debridement alone, most appear within one year after the index procedure. The amount of time that elapsed in this case is unusual and serves as a sobering reminder that tuberculosis may recur at a time distant from the initial procedure. The second patient had tuberculosis diagnosed elsewhere and was treated twice with antituberculous chemotherapy. Although the first course of therapy for six months may have been inadequate, the second course with multiple drugs for 18 months would certainly be considered adequate; yet he had a recurrence in his wrist eight months after completing treatment. These two cases illustrate the fastidious nature of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis organism and the need for a combined treatment protocol of meticulous surgical debridement and combined chemotherapy.\r"

They included five men and three women, whose ages ranged from 54 to 82 years (average, 70 years). In all the cases, roentgenograms revealed osteoarthrotic changes in the wrist and dorsal subluxation or dislocation of the ulnar heads. Seven cases had operations. Friction with the dorsally subluxated or dislocated ulnar head and the osteophytes surrounding it caused these tendons to rupture. It was impossible to use end-to-end sutures, so tendon transfers or tendon grafts were performed. The patients were evaluated one to four years after surgery. Three patients complained of some disability in their daily lives, notably, limited flexion of their fingers. It is important that during surgery the reconstructed tendons should not be strained excessively.\r"

  ".U": "91085055\r", 
  ".W": "Ten adult male patients with scaphoid nonunions were treated by radical curettage, trapezoidal iliac crest bone grafting, and internal fixation with a Herbert screw. The mean patient age was 24.7 years, and the mean duration of the nonunion before surgery was 37.3 months. Mean follow-up time was 30.4 months. Nine of the ten nonunions healed, although one patient required a second bone-grafting procedure. The mean postoperative grip strength was 45.0 kg, and the mean postoperative pinch strength was 11.5 kg. The mean postoperative range of motion was volar flexion, 76.1 degrees; dorsiflexion, 74.2 degrees; radial deviation, 22.1 degrees; and ulnar deviation, 40.1 degrees. The scapholunate angle decreased from a mean of 72.8 degrees preoperatively to 60.6 degrees postoperatively (p less than 0.025). The mean carpal index was 0.57 postoperatively. Mean scaphoid length increased postoperatively and was within 0.2 mm of the opposite (normal) scaphoid in every patient except the single patient with a persistent nonunion (p less than 0.025). All patients returned to work (eight as laborers), and nine of ten wrists were subjectively rated as good or excellent. The results of the series suggests that treatment of displaced scaphoid nonunion by radical curettage, trapezoidal iliac crest bone grafting, and internal fixation with a Herbert screw is an effective method of treatment that reconstitutes scaphoid anatomy and promotes excellent wrist function.\r"

Lateral and anterior ultrasound scanning was employed, and the coverage of the femoral head by the acetabular roof was assessed. The ultrasound measurements were compared with standard roentgenography, and a good accordance between the methods was found. A lateral projection of the femoral head in relation to the bony acetabular rim of more than 8 mm in children younger than ten years of age indicated subluxation and more than 15 mm at age two to four years indicated dislocation. Reliable images were obtained by ultrasound at any age between two and 18 years. Ultrasound is recommended as the primary imaging technique in the evaluation of hip joints, even in older children, and ultrasound should replace roentgenography in most of the follow-up examinations of children with previous CDH.\r"

Two patients had loss of amplitude of the tracings at the time of closure, and both of these patients exhibited postoperative sciatic nerve palsies. There were no false negatives. Femoral reaming and reduction are the surgical events most commonly associated with nerve reactions. Patients who have had prior hip procedures appear to be at higher risk.

All patients were studied clinically for evidence of abductor weakness and leg-length discrepancy. They were also studied roentgenographically for evidence of femoral head deformity and trochanteric overgrowth. The overall results showed a 6% incidence of leg-length discrepancy greater than 2 cm after both operative and nonoperative treatment. The articulo-trochanteric distance (ATD) was less than +5 mm in 23% of patients, of which 43% had a positive Trendelenburg sign. A significantly lower mean ATD was found in patients treated by femoral varus osteotomy, which should be avoided in patients over eight years of age. The study also demonstrated a strong association between coxa magna and growth disturbance of the proximal femoral physis manifesting itself as either a leg-length discrepancy or as a low ATD.

Strength deficits, measured with a Kin-Com dynamometer using a static preloading protocol, were found in comparison with a group of matched healthy subjects preoperatively and three and eight weeks postoperatively in the knee extensors. These deficits were related to previously unreported modifications in the shape of the moment-angle curves and a tendency to lower activation levels of the vastus medialis (VM) but not the vastus lateralis or rectus femoris muscles. No deficits were found in the knee flexors preoperatively or three and eight weeks postoperatively, but the medial hamstrings activation level was lower for movements at 30 degrees per second. During flexion movements, the percentage of coactivation of the antagonist VM was significantly greater than healthy values at 30 degrees and 180 degrees per second. These results clearly indicate that neuromuscular recovery is not complete when return to work is advocated three to four weeks postoperatively. Such findings suggest the need for a rehabilitation program to promote recovery of the knee muscles in workers with a physically demanding occupation.\r"

The present study was performed to determine if venous drainage from the femur of immature animals possesses similar characteristics. Three-week-old rats were given a 5-microliters intramedullary injection containing radioactively labeled 15-mu-diameter microspheres. In the intact animal, the particles moved from the injection site in the femur to the lungs within two minutes; however, obliteration of blood flow in the soft tissue surrounding the femoral diaphysis significantly reduced this movement in most animals.

Increased dishing of the tibial surface reduced flexion, but some dishing was considered necessary for reduction of contact stresses. Anteroposterior translation of the tibial component had little effect on flexion. Femoral translation had some offset, and posterior positioning reduced flexion. The most important surgical variable was tibial component tilt in the sagittal plane. Posterior tilt increased motion, while anterior tilt decreased motion. The results apply to the choice of total knee system, instrument design, and surgical technique.\r"

In the treatment of severe flexion deformities of the knee in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, posterior release surgery was effective only in correcting the deformity. Posterior subluxation of the tibia, knee pain, and instability occurred soon after surgery. Therefore, patients may require additional reconstructive surgery soon after the posterior release.\r"

The ability of proteoglycan to act as a calcium-concentrating agent (Kalksalzfanger) in cartilage is consistent with the view that proteoglycans are promoters of calcification. However, study of their effect on hydroxyapatite formation in vitro suggests that proteoglycans are inhibitors of cartilage calcification. A resolution of this paradox is now proposed. Proteoglycans inhibit hydroxyapatite formation under in vitro conditions of limited calcium availability (in part) by binding calcium ions. However, under in vivo conditions of essentially infinite calcium availability, proteoglycans may promote hydroxyapatite formation, since binding of calcium to proteoglycan will not decrease the free calcium concentration, and the bound calcium may easily be displaced. Therefore, it is proposed that the role of proteoglycans in the calcification of cartilage is to function as a cation-exchanging calcium reservoir.\r"

This study compared autografts and allografts with respect to the time required and the success of graft incorporation. Fifty-four patients with 61 lesions were studied. Lesions were classified as small volume (less than 60 cc) or large volume (more than 60 cc) and were separated into four groups: small-volume autograft, large-volume autograft, small-volume allograft, and large-volume allograft. Allografts appeared comparable to autografts when small-volume lesions were treated. The healing time was slightly longer for allografts with an average period of 21 months versus 27 months for autografts. Autografts were superior to allografts in rate and completeness of healing for solitary large lesions. This increased efficacy presumes a somewhat older child in which an adequate amount of bone is available for an autograft. A young child with multicentric or polyostotic lesions can still achieve successful incorporation with allografts. In this study, 38% healed completely and 29% healed partially. Allografts have a distinct place in the treatment of benign bone lesions in children.\r"

  ".U": "91085072\r", 
  ".W": "Proteolytic enzymes acting at physiologic pH (neutral proteases) are involved in both the formation and modeling of new bone and the remodeling of mature bone. In endochondral ossification systems such as growth-plate calcification, fracture healing, osteophyte formation, and demineralized bone matrix-induced osteogenesis, neutral proteases are predominantly involved in modifying proteins and proteoglycans in the extracellular matrix in preparation for calcification. These enzymes are of low molecular weight (below 30,000 Mr), are poorly charged, metal ion dependent, and appear to become active only after being released from chondrocytes. These neutral proteases may be distributed to the extracellular matrix in association with matrix vesicles that are derived from chondrocyte plasma membranes. A similar mechanism of calcification may also exist during malignant osteogenesis in an osteosarcoma; however, the cell producing the neutral protease in this lesion is the osteoblast and the matrix being synthesized is osteoid. In remodeling bone, osteoblasts secrete neutral collagenase (as an inactive enzyme) and produce not only additional proteases capable of activating the collagenase but also a collagenase inhibitor. Osteoblast collagenase or neutral protease may act to remove unmineralized osteoid from bone surfaces, thus facilitating its subsequent degradation by osteoclasts. The production of all these factors by osteoblasts appears to be regulated by calciotropic hormones (e.g., parathyroid hormone, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, and calcitonin), possibly in a concerted fashion. Other possible functions of neutral proteases involve direct actions on cells or on specific molecules (growth factors) residing in the extracellular matrix.\r"

  ".W": "When whole marrow is introduced into porous calcium phosphate ceramic, bone forms on the walls of the pores. As an extension of earlier studies, bone marrow cells derived from the femora of inbred rats were introduced into tissue culture, and the adherent cells were cultivated, mitotically expanded, subcultured, harvested, placed in small cubes of porous calcium phosphate ceramic, and grafted into subcutaneous sites of syngeneic rats. Primary marrow-derived, cultured mesenchymal cells introduced into ceramic showed strong osteogenic potential, with bone forming in the pore regions of ceramic as early as two weeks after in vivo implantation; cartilage was observed infrequently in pores that appeared to be avascular. Osteogenesis could be observed after the 18th subculture (over 36 population doublings) when the cells were tested in ceramic at subcutaneous sites, whereas chondrogenesis was observed with only the first and second subcultured cells in the ceramic delivery vehicle. With increasing numbers of subcultures, the initiation of osteogenesis and the apparent rate of bone formation declined, and the course of osteogenesis was delayed. Cultured, marrow-derived mesenchymal cells, even after the 21st subculture (over 40 population doublings), exhibited a positive histochemical reaction for alkaline phosphatase. However, the in vivo osteogenic potential of these cells was not correlated with their alkaline phosphatase activity. The implantation of cell pellets or the injection of cell suspensions of fresh or cultured, adherent marrow cells never produced bone or cartilage in heterotopic sites. These data indicate that porous ceramic provides an excellent delivery vehicle for cells that are capable of osteogenic expression and suggest that the composite graft of marrow-derived mesenchymal cells and porous ceramic may be useful for repair of massive bone defects. It may be possible to culture marrow mesenchymal cells as a source for reparative cells for implantation back into autogeneic sites.\r"

This concept, designed by tumor surgeons and based on theory, has been cautiously approached. However, reproducible results have gradually increased clinical acceptance. Understanding the healing process has been restricted because of the lack of an experimental model. In an attempt to elucidate this mechanism of healing, a cell culture model was used to investigate the effects of methylprednisolone on synovial cells. Initially, three doses of the drug were tested and maximal changes were noted with the concentration of 40 mg/ml. Changes were then quantified by morphology, DNA assay, cell protein analysis, and electron microscopy. Results suggest that methylprednisolone may have a direct effect on the cellular component of unicameral bone cysts.\r"

  ".W": "This article reviews the clinical experience with cryosurgery (use of liquid nitrogen) and acrylic cementation (polymethylmethacrylate; PMMA) in the treatment of aggressive, benign bone sarcomas and the biologic basis of this technique. The results of 25 patients below the age of 21 treated by cryosurgery, with an average follow-up period of 60.8 months, are reported. Three approaches to surgical reconstruction were used: Group 1 (four patients) had cryosurgery with no reconstruction, Group 2 (13 patients) had bone graft reconstruction alone, and Group 3 (eight patients) had composite osteosynthesis with internal fixation, bone graft, and/or PMMA. The overall control rate was 96% (one recurrence). The tumor types were giant-cell tumor, chondroblastoma, aneurysmal bone cyst, and malignant giant-cell tumor. Nineteen lesions involved the lower extremity, and six lesions were located in the upper extremity. There were two secondary fractures (8%), one local flap necrosis, and one synovial fistula. There were no infections. Two epiphyseodeses were performed. The functional results were excellent (83%), good (13%), and fair (4%). The technique of composite osteosynthesis is recommended for all large tumors of the lower extremity. Cryosurgical results compare favorably with those obtained by en bloc resection and demonstrate the ability of cryosurgery to eradicate tumors while avoiding the need for extensive resections and reconstructive procedures.\r"

  ".W": "Two disorders involving histologically benign proliferations of fibrous tissue or of histiocytes occur preferentially in children and often require combined management by an orthopedic surgeon and a pediatric oncologist. Treatment of young people with aggressive fibromatosis usually begins with wide local excision of the lesion. However, some tumors cannot be completely removed either because of their location or because of the risk of subsequent serious dysfunction. Not infrequently, local recurrence supervenes despite previous wide local excision, and sometimes multiple tumors are present. In these situations a trial of multiple-agent chemotherapy incorporating vincristine, actinomycin D, and cyclophosphamide may be indicated in an attempt to control the disease. Radiation therapy may also be useful, but the relatively high dose (5000 cGy or more) needed in a growing child is at times a less attractive alternative. Biopsy of a lytic bone lesion in young patients with Langerhans' cell histiocytosis, formerly known as histiocytosis X, is also indicated for initial diagnosis. Biopsy and curettage are usually curative in the patient with an isolated lesion. Patients with multiple simultaneous or recurrent lesions need chemotherapy if dysfunction of the liver, spleen, or lungs is present. Drug therapy may also be beneficial for children with systemic symptoms. This article outlines suggestions for chemotherapeutic treatment in both diseases.\r"

  ".W": "Limb-salvage operations are being used with increasing frequency for patients with malignant bone tumors. For children, when a biologic reconstruction is desired, the choice is often between conventional and vascularized fibular grafts. An experimental study was performed in dogs to compare the two types of fibular grafts for bridging segmental defects in the radius and ulna. Twenty-six adult dogs were divided into two groups and studied at intervals of two, three, four, six, and 12 months after transplantation. The conventional grafts healed by creeping substitution i.e., they were first partially resorbed before new bone was laid down. In contrast, the vascularized fibulae maintained their normal structure and hypertrophied by subperiosteal new bone formation. The conventional fibulae eventually hypertrophied but much later than the vascularized grafts. The vascularized grafts were stronger at four and six months. Between six and 12 months, both grafts remodeled to resemble the size and shape of the forearm bones they were replacing. These experimental results have influenced the treatment of patients. Vascularized fibular grafts are ideal for diaphyseal defects greater than 10 cm long, especially in very young children, a poorly vascularized bed, or when bone healing is delayed by chemotherapeutic agents. To maximize hypertrophy, an external fixator is used to immobilize the graft rather than a plate, which acts as a stress shield.\r"

Sixteen skeletally immature children form the base of this report. The tumors were located in the distal femur in ten children, the proximal tibia in five and the proximal femur in one. There were no intraoperative complications and postoperative complications included one infection requiring debridement and three minor healing delays. There were no local recurrences, neurovascular compromises, late derotations, or psychologic decompensations. One patient died of metastatic disease and another died of a second malignancy (leukemia). The remaining patients are good, functional, below-knee prosthesis users who participate in a number of sporting and athletic activities. The procedure is safe, has a relatively low complication rate, allows for the functional demands of an active, growing child, and accommodates for the future growth of extremities.\r"

To explore the efficacy of this procedure and establish guidelines for an appropriate choice of patients, the experience with 43 thoracotomies in 24 children was reviewed. The appearance of first metastasis later than one year after diagnosis, presence of fewer than five nodules, and completeness of surgical resection were favorable predictors of postthoractomy survival. Early or multiple metastases, unresectable disease, and hilar, nodal, or pleural lesions conferred an unfavorable prognosis. With careful patient selection, pulmonary metastecotomy is a safe procedure that has few operative or long-term complications. It must be emphasized that although surgical removal of pulmonary metastases prolongs survival with good quality of life, the majority of patients with bone sarcomas ultimately succumb to their disease after thoracotomy. Follow-up time of greater than eight years is necessary to adequately assess the effectiveness of pulmonary resection in eradicating all disease in these patients.\r"

Only 15% of the patients grew at the expected rate during that year. The distribution of nutritional status scores was significantly different at the end of the first year than at baseline. The distribution of ultimate height scores was significantly different than the baseline distribution. The overall final distribution was also significantly different from the normal population expectation. Any absolute difference in height, however, is likely to be small. The subgroups that were observed to full adult stature showed mean heights of 162 cm for girls and 176 cm for boys.\r"

As part of this program, bronchoscopy with BAL was performed prior to therapy and at the onset of granulocytopenia. Thirty-three of the first 57 patients managed in this program developed some evidence of pulmonary complications. Twelve patients died in aplasia; all had pulmonary failure. Forty patients had clinically significant abnormalities on the bronchoscopy before treatment including 12 of 19 patients who had normal findings on chest x-ray films, physical examination, and pulmonary function testing, and no fever. Twenty-seven patients had clinically significant abnormal bronchoscopy or BAL at the onset of granulocytopenia. Thirteen patients required additional bronchoscopy. No patient required an open lung biopsy. Pulmonary surveillance using bronchoscopy with BAL is useful in the detection of pulmonary disease prior to the initiation of and following high-dose antineoplastic therapy.\r"

All patients were followed up prospectively for a mean of 117 weeks, and 103 fatal events were recorded. In Cox survival analysis, three variables were found to be independently related to survival: pulmonary artery mean pressure (PAMP), number of stenosed vessels, and left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction (p less than 0.01); in multivariate stepwise analysis, PAMP entered the model first with the largest chi 2 value of the three prognostic variables (chi 2 = 33.4; p less than 0.0001). The PAMP was 32 percent higher in decedents compared with survivors (25 + 11 mm Hg vs 19 + 8 mm Hg, p less than 0.01 [mean, SD]) and a 10 mm Hg increase in PAMP was associated with a more than fourfold increase in the relative risk of dying; this finding was independent of pulmonary vascular resistance and therefore could not be attributed to primary pulmonary vascular or parenchymal disease. In both the subgroup of 1,118 patients with a normal LV ejection fraction (greater than 50 percent) and the 253 patients with a reduced ejection fraction (less than 50 percent), PAMP emerged as an independent predictor of mortality (p less than 0.0001 and 0.01, respectively), and is therefore a marker of cardiac disease beyond impairment of systolic contractile function. Among patients without obstructive coronary artery disease, PAMP alone provided prognostic information in the multivariate survival analysis.\r"

Other than minor lengthening of filtered QRS duration, no significant change in time-domain SAECG parameters was noted.

There were 67 HIV-seropositive and 158 HIV-seronegative patients. Intrathoracic adenopathy alone was more common and parenchymal infiltrates less common in HIV-seropositive patients (p less than 0.05). Although a parenchymal infiltrate was less likely to be cavitating in the HIV-seropositive group (p less than 0.05) when cavitary parenchymal disease was present, HIV seropositivity did not affect the number of cavities (single or multiple) or the size of the largest cavity. Patients with AIDS were significantly more likely to have a chest radiographic pattern consistent with primary tuberculosis (80 percent) than HIV-seropositive patients without AIDS (30 percent), and the latter were significantly more likely to have such a pattern than HIV-seronegative patients (11 percent) (p less than 0.05). The HIV-seropositive patients were equally infectious, regardless of the pattern of disease (primary vs postprimary). Even though pulmonary tuberculosis in an HIV-seropositive adult probably results from reactivation of dormant foci or reinfection, the pattern on the chest roentgenogram often suggests primary disease, especially if the patient has AIDS.\r"

The mean age of the patients was 59 years, and the mean FEV1 was approximately 50 percent of predicted. All patients participated in a ten-week PR program. They were randomized to receive either additional TF-IMT (PR + IMT) or not (PR). The TF-IMT was performed by means of a target-flow resistive device; the generated mouth pressure and the duration of inspiration and of the respiratory cycle were imposed. After the training period, maximal inspiratory mouth pressure and EMG-fatigability of the diaphragm were significantly better in the PR + IMT group than in the PR group. Maximal work load and psychologic symptoms increased to the same extent in both groups. The 12-minute walking distance also increased in both groups, but it increased significantly more in the PR + IMT group than in the PR group. We believe that additional TF-IMT during PR in a selected group of patients with COPD who have ventilatory limitation has an extra beneficial effect on the performance of the inspiratory muscles and on exercise performance.\r"

In the study on initial PS flow, we found the following: (a) an optimal initial PS flow could be defined for a given level of PS that resulted in the patient obtaining maximal pressure and volume from the ventilator; (b) initial PS flows above and below this optimal flow were associated with faster breathing frequencies, shorter inspiratory times, smaller tidal volumes and a tendency for airway pressure to not reach the selected PS level; and (c) optimal initial PS flow was fastest in patients with the lowest compliances and the most active ventilatory drives. Changing PS termination criteria from 50 to 25 percent of peak flow had minimal effects on the ventilatory pattern or synchrony. We conclude that the initial PS flow to achieve the selected PS level is important in patient-ventilator synchrony but that termination criteria set between 25 and 50 percent of peak flow is not.\r"

This study evaluated the clinical feasibility of a 99mTc-labeled anti-CEA monoclonal antibody (BW 431/26, Behring Institute, FRG) in 11 patients for staging of primary adenocarcinoma of the lung. The primary tumor size ranged from 3 to 8 cm with a mean of 4 cm. Mediastinal and hilar nodes were present in four patients, intrapulmonary metastases were present in two patients, and pleural and liver metastases were present in one patient each. The CEA levels were in the range of 2 to 265 ng/ml and elevated (greater than 5 ng/ml) in six patients. Planar scintigraphy was performed at 6 h and 24 h post injection (pi). Analog and digitized images were interpreted by two observers. One patient was imaged twice and experienced serum sickness due to human anti-mouse antibodies (HAMA) after the second study, which showed marked unspecific tracer uptake in liver, spleen, and bone marrow, but no specific uptake by the tumor and was excluded from further analysis. Visual interpretation identified the primary tumor clearly in seven patients. No tumor imaging was observed in two patients. Two patients were classified as having questionable imaging due to a poor separation of tumor uptake from mediastinal blood pool. The primary tumor could be clearly delineated in both patients after comparison with the chest radiograph. Thus, the overall sensitivity for imaging of the primary tumor was 82 percent. The average target/background ratio was 1.31 +/- 0.17:1 at 6 h pi, and 1.30 +/- 0.16:1 at 24 h pi. Hilar and mediastinal nodes were correctly suspected in three patients, but the cardiac blood pool hampered a clear interpretation. Intrapulmonary and pleural metastases were diagnosed in all cases. The single liver metastasis was missed because of the high unspecific tracer uptake. Planar anti-CEA RIS with 99mTc BW 431/26 was superior to computed tomography (CT) in one case with subtotal tumor resection. We summarize that at present, planar anti-CEA RIS with 99mTc BW 431/26 cannot be advised as a routine staging procedure in adenocarcinoma of the lung, but it may be helpful in the detection of residual or recurrent tumor tissue.\r"

One patient each had polyarteritis nodosa, Wegener's granulomatosis, bronchiolitis obliterans with organizing pneumonia, and chronic lymphocytic leukemia with red blood cell aplasia. Hypoalbuminemia (serum albumin level less than 3.0 g/dl) and daily therapy were associated with increased risk for development of PCP (p less than 0.05). None of the patients had leukopenia (less than 3,500/cu mm) or neutropenia (less than 1,000/cumm) at diagnosis. All were negative for the human immunodeficiency virus. Patients receiving oral cyclophosphamide and prednisone may be at higher or increasing risk for PCP. A high index of suspicion and aggressive evaluation for opportunistic infection are needed in these patients; consideration for trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole prophylaxis and development of more quantitative measures of immunosuppression are needed.\r"

A Streptococcus pneumoniae serotype 1, resistant to cotrimoxazole, was isolated in 29 patients (74 percent). Blood cultures were positive in 24 (61 percent). The patients were relatively young; none was over 70 years old. Thirty-five (90 percent) were heavy smokers; 32 (82 percent) were alcoholics. The radiologic pattern was atypical in 14 cases (36 percent). The only fatal case was linked to the adult respiratory distress syndrome. It is likely that the rate of outbreaks of pneumococcal pneumonia is underestimated. The homeless are at high risk for pneumococcal pneumonia. In addition, the closeness existing in shelters favors the occurrence of outbreaks. Consequently, we suggest that shelter residents would benefit from pneumococcal vaccination.\r"

The increase in Rp during exercise does not appear to be related to acute hypoxic vasoconstruction but rather to functional changes (compliance or recruitment or both) of the pulmonary microvasculature. In the genesis of these functional changes, chronic alveolar hypoxia and the inflammatory-fibrotic process might be interacting.\r"

We classified into group 1 patients with confluent and good-sized pulmonary (greater than or equal to 3 mm) arteries, single ductus arteriosus, and normal pulmonary venous connections (\"favorable pattern\"). The other patients with PAVSD were classified into group 2 (\"unfavorable pattern\"). The intracardiac anatomy, the morphology of the pulmonary arteries, and the pattern of pulmonary blood supply and pulmonary venous connection were correctly identified with echocardiography in all but one patient, who was erroneously considered to be in group 2. No false-positive of the \"favorable pattern\" (group 1) was detected. Echocardiography is an effective tool in infants with PAVSD, in order to discriminate cases with \"favorable\" and \"unfavorable\" patterns of pulmonary arteries, pulmonary blood supply, and pulmonary veins. The first group with the \"favorable pattern\" may be considered for systemic-to-pulmonary shunt surgery without angiocardiography. Based on this experience from January to December 1989, four patients with this \"favorable pattern\" underwent a successful systemic-to-pulmonary artery shunt with an echocardiographic diagnosis alone.\r"

During this challenge, hemodynamic monitoring combined with thermodilution measurement of right ventricular (RV) ejection fraction (EF) and two-dimensional echocardiographic measurement of RV size permitted assessment of the effects of increasing levels of PEEP on RV function. RV preload, as reflected by RV end-diastolic volume (EDV) and two-dimensional RV end-diastolic area (EDA), remained unchanged and RV diastolic compliance progressively decreased. On the other hand, RV systolic function, as assessed by RVEF and two-dimensional RV fractional area contraction (FAC), was progressively depressed. Substantial deleterious effects of PEEP were noted at high levels of PEEP including reduced CT and augmented pulmonary vascular resistance. Inadequate increase in RV preload to compensate for increased RV afterload resulted in depressed RV systolic function and contributed to the reduction in cardiac output. Finally, two-dimensional echocardiography proved to be more sensitive than fast-response thermodilution to evaluate change in RV function.\r"

Detectable endotoxin occurred in 43 of 100 patients with septic shock, but in only one of ten patients with shock due to nonseptic causes. During septic shock, endotoxemia frequently occurred in the absence of Gram-negative bacteremia. Using a logistic regression model, multiple organ failure occurred 10.3 times more frequently and depression of left ventricular ejection fraction (less than or equal to 45 percent) 4.8 times more frequently in endotoxemic patients. In patients with positive blood cultures, endotoxemia was associated with a high mortality. We conclude that endotoxemia occurs frequently in septic shock and is associated with severe manifestations of this syndrome, including cardiac depression and multiple organ failure. This study suggests that endotoxin is an important mediator of septic shock and supports efforts to develop anti-endotoxin therapies for treating patients with this disease.\r"

Electrophysiologic studies indicated a primary axonal degeneration of motor and sensory fibers in 30 (70 percent). Fifteen (30 percent) had the clinical signs of difficulty in weaning from assisted ventilation, weakness of limb muscles, and reduced or absent deep tendon reflexes. Full recovery from the polyneuropathy occurred among the 23 (53 percent) who survived, except three who had a very severe polyneuropathy. A peripheral nerve function index, computed from electrophysiologic measurements, showed statistically significant (p less than 0.01) negative correlations with the time in the critical care unit, and the serum glucose value; the serum albumin level showed a positive correlation. Multiple regression analyses indicated all three factors accounted for 47 percent (r2 = 0.4678) of all potential variables. In a separate analysis, the nerve function index correlated with the amplitude of the diaphragm compound muscle action potential (p less than 0.01). The results were consistent with the polyneuropathy being due to the same mechanisms that are currently postulated to cause dysfunction in this syndrome of other organ systems (including the neuromuscular respiratory system).\r"

There were no clinical signs of extrapulmonary manifestations despite toxic serum mercury levels. Although serum mercury levels decreased in response to the mercury chelating agent dimercaprol, serum levels remained in the toxic range and no clinical response was observed. Acute inhalational exposure to high concentrations of mercury vapor causes pneumonitis that can lead to respiratory failure and death.

In this study, we have determined the prevalence of these complaints in a random population sample (n = 1,109) using standardized questionnaires at two points in time, eight years apart. Cross-sectional prevalence and changes in symptom occurrence have been correlated with smoking status, allergen skin test reactivity, and total serum IgE levels. Our objective was to determine the individual and combined influence of these three variables on symptom prevalence. Initially, 19.2 percent of the population admitted to wheeze, 17.9 percent to cough, and 44.1 percent to allergic rhinitis. Cough and wheeze prevalence changed little over the eight-year period, while rhinitis increased 11 percent by the second survey. The occurrence of chronic cough was strongly correlated with smoking, and was not further influenced by either allergen skin reactivity or IgE level. Conversely, rhinitis prevalence was related to skin test reactivity with no additional association with smoking or IgE level. The occurrence of wheeze in the absence of colds was associated with both smoking and allergen skin reactivity. Among smokers, the prevalence was over 30 percent and was similar in both skin test positive (STP) and skin test negative (STN) individuals. However, on both surveys, STP ex-smokers and nonsmokers had significantly more wheeze than those who were STN. While the prevalence of wheeze in STN nonsmokers was low (6.8 percent), an IgE-wheeze relationship was also suggested on the second survey. In addition to these cross-sectional symptom relationships, changes in either smoking status or allergen skin reactivity during the study period were associated with changes in the prevalence of each symptom.\r"

An array of surface PO2 microelectrodes was placed over the hindlimb biceps femoris muscle and sufficient readings were obtained to construct a PtO2 histogram. Changes in the histogram standard deviation were used to characterize micro-circulatory maldistribution. Systemic O2 consumption (VO2) was measured by the expired gas method. Cardiac output (Q) and systemic O2 transport (TO2) were calculated. Samples of arterial, right atrial (ra), and hindlimb venous blood, from a catheter placed in the infrarenal portion of the vena cava, were simultaneously obtained for measurement of blood gases and saturations. Following the administration of endotoxin, there were decreases in Q and TO2 of approximately 50 percent. The VO2 initially decreased 23 percent, but returned to baseline levels 30 minutes after endotoxin administration. Systemic O2 extraction ratio (ERO2 = VO2/TO2) increased from 0.32 +/- .03 to 0.54 +/- .07 (p less than 0.01), whereas hindlimb ERO2 increased from 0.42 +/- .03 to 0.60 +/- .02 (p less than 0.01). The arithmetic mean of the PtO2 histograms decreased after endotoxin infusion (43 +/- 4 to 7 +/- 2 mm Hg; p less than 0.01), but PLO2 remained at baseline levels (35 +/- 2 vs. 33 +/- 2 mm Hg; p = NS). The standard deviation of the PtO2 histograms remained constant during the experiment. This finding supports the notion that skeletal muscle microcirculatory heterogeneity does not increase during endotoxin induced hypodynamic sepsis.\r"

Increases in the percentages of lymphocytes in bronchoalveolar fluid of both patients and animals with amiodarone pulmonary toxicity have been reported. To assess whether these lymphocytes are functionally activated, we measured natural killer cell activity in the lungs and blood of rats with amiodarone-induced pulmonary toxicity. Amiodarone treated rats exhibited pathologic evidence of amiodarone-induced lung disease after one week of treatment and this injury was sustained and more extensive during the remainder of the study period. Control rats had histologically normal lungs. Blood NK activity was equally present in both amiodarone-treated and control groups and was not significantly different over the course of the study (16 +/- 3 percent and 13 +/- 2 percent, respectively; p greater than 0.05). Thus, NK cells were activated only in the lungs of rats treated with amiodarone, suggesting a local immune response in the lung. These data support the concept that lymphocytes play an important role in the pathogenesis of amiodarone-induced lung disease.\r"

DESIGN: Cross-sectional study of responses to a structured questionnaire, lung function assessed by spirometry and cough threshold to inhalation of capsaicin aerosol in a group of occupationally-exposed Capsicum workers as compared to non-exposed employees of the same work site. SETTING: Spice manufacturing facility. PARTICIPANTS: Twenty-two Capsicum-exposed and 19 nonexposed workers. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: When evaluated by questionnaire, 13 (59 percent) of the Capsicum-exposed workers reported cough as compared to 4 (21 percent) of the nonexposed workers (p less than 0.05). Baseline FEV1 and FVC did not differ between the two groups. Cough threshold, as assessed by the lowest concentration of inhaled capsaicin eliciting cough, was related to workplace exposure (p = 0.05), displaying a bimodal pattern of higher and lower cough thresholds among the Capsicum workers as compared to a unimodal distribution among the nonexposed workers. Within the exposed group, a higher cough threshold was significantly related to male gender (p = 0.03) and was associated to a lesser extent with dietary preference for hot food (p = 0.09) and cumulative cigarette smoking (p = 0.07). CONCLUSION: Chronic occupational exposure to chili peppers is associated with complaints of cough but does not alone lead to decreased responsiveness of capsaicin-sensitive nerves when assessed by cough threshold. The cough response to capsaicin inhalation may be modified by the effects of multiple, potentially interactive factors.\r"

We assessed the yield of FB for cough during a four-year period in patients with nonlocalizing chest roentgenograms who were refractory to diagnostic efforts and empiric bronchodilator or antitussive therapy. Seven (28 percent) of 25 patients undergoing FB for cough (of greater than 1,500 bronchoscopies) had diagnostic findings (broncholithiasis, two; tracheobronchopathia osteochondroplastica, two; and tuberculous bronchostenosis, laryngeal dyskinesia, and arytenoid polyp, one each). No tracheobronchial neoplasms were detected. Age greater than 50 years and female sex independently predicted positive results (p = 0.02 Fisher's exact test), while duration of cough (two to 240 months), airflow, and smoking status did not. When patients with prior pulmonary or extrathoracic neoplasms were excluded, seven (35 percent) of 20 studies were diagnostic. Diagnoses potentially could have been made by thoracic computed tomographic scanning in four patients and indirect laryngoscopy in two. Fiberoptic bronchoscopy has a respectable yield for diagnosis of refractory chronic cough and is a reasonable procedure in carefully selected patients.\r"

The overall prevalence of cough was 19 percent in the ACE inhibitor groups compared with 9 percent in the hydrochlorothiazide-treated group. The observed odds ratio for cough among ACE inhibitor users was 2.3 (95 percent CI, 1.02 to 5.00). This study is the first systematic investigation of frequency and characteristics of ACE inhibitor cough that includes a control group. Our results suggest that cough may more frequently accompany treatment with ACE inhibitors than has been previously reported. We recommend that physicians specifically inquire about cough in patients taking an ACE inhibitor. Recognition of this side effect may prevent unnecessary testing and treatment of patients receiving ACE inhibitors.\r"

The subjects were monitored several nights both with and without the following devices: a tight-fitting facial mask, a pneumotachometer, and an esophageal balloon. They were also monitored with and without nasal continuous positive airway pressure. The Multiple Sleep Latency Test was administered after three of the experimental nights (after the baseline nights and after the second nasal CPAP night). Determination of short EEG arousals during nocturnal sleep, which lasted 2 to 10 s, was performed. The relationship between short EEG arousals, the esophageal pressure nadir, and airflow decrease was investigated. We also determined the relationship between clinical reporting of decrease in daytime alertness and MSLT results, and the relationship between MSLT results and the frequency of EEG arousals. The monitoring indicated that heavy snorers may present significant increase in Pes nadir with abrupt decrease in flow leading to EEG arousals. The frequency at which EEG arousals occur has an impact on MSLT scores. Nasal CPAP improves MSLT scores and eliminates these respiration-related EEG arousals. Some heavy snorers without obstructive sleep apnea syndrome may be at risk of having a decrease in daytime alertness.\r"

Sixteen patients, 11 of whom had indwelling central venous catheters, were treated with either urokinase (n = 11) or streptokinase (n = 5). Either urokinase (4,400 U/kg bolus followed by 4,400 U/kg/h) or streptokinase (250,000 U bolus followed by 100,000 U/h) was used, and venograms were performed before and after. Overall, 56 percent of patients had complete clot lysis and relief of symptoms. Thrombolytic therapy was effective in eight (73 percent) of 11 patients receiving urokinase and one (20 percent) of five patients receiving streptokinase. Of those with a central venous catheter, eight (73 percent) of 11 patients were successfully lysed, whereas only one (20 percent) of five patients was successfully lysed if no catheter was present. If thrombolytic therapy was performed less than or equal to five days of symptom onset, seven (88 percent) of eight patients were successful, if thrombolytic therapy was performed greater than five days after symptom onset, two (25 percent) of eight patients were successful. Symptoms were relieved and the catheter was preserved in patients in whom thrombolytic therapy was effective. Factors predicting success were as follows: (1) the use of urokinase compared with streptokinase; (2) the presence of a central venous catheter; and (3) a duration of symptoms less than or equal to five days.\r"

  ".W": "We determined the relative efficacy of two bronchodilator aerosol delivery methods in 18 intubated mechanically ventilated patients with airways obstruction. Two treatment arms, consisting of albuterol 270 micrograms (three puffs) from a metered dose inhaler and albuterol 2.5 mg from a saline solution nebulized with an updraft inhaler, were compared in a single blind, randomized crossover design. Pulmonary function was evaluated using an interrupter technique. Changes in passive expiratory flow at respiratory system recoil pressures between 6 and 10 cm H2O provided the therapeutic endpoints. Paired measurements were made before and 30 minutes after drug delivery. The MDI and NEB resulted in similar improvements in iso-recoil flow (mean increase for both groups = 0.1 L/s). Treatment sequence, severity of obstruction, and bronchodilator responsiveness had no effect on relative efficacy. Albuterol caused a small but significant increase in heart rate that was similar following both delivery methods. We conclude that bronchodilator aerosol delivery with metered dose inhalers provides a viable alternative to nebulizer therapy in intubated mechanically ventilated patients and may result in a cost savings to hospitals and patients.\r"

Preoperative status, anesthetic methods and perioperative complications were analyzed by multiple regression to determine predictors of outcome. Twenty-three percent of patients had greater than 90 percent mainstem bronchus obstruction. Longer serum elimination half-life of relaxant drug was significantly correlated with longer duration of mechanical ventilation after neuromuscular blockade reversal. Cardiovascular complications were noted in 24 procedures and often required therapeutic intervention. Variables predicting cardiovascular complications included longer duration of GA and increasing age. Perioperative respiratory and cardiovascular complications are common after GA for Nd: YAG laser resection. Short-acting neuromuscular relaxants, careful assessment prior to postoperative extubation, limiting duration of GA and cardiovascular monitoring are recommended when implementing GA for Nd: YAG laser resection of endobronchial tumors.\r"

PATIENTS AND METHODS: All endotracheally intubated and mechanically ventilated patients for a two-month period were recruited for study. The diagnosis of LRTI was based on a clinical suspicion sufficient enough to start or change antibiotic therapy. Specimens were obtained by blind endotracheal tube suctioning. After processing, sputum smears were stained with fluorescein-labelled antibody to the Fc portion of IgG, IgM, and IgA. More than five fluorescein-labelled bacteria per oil immersion field were considered positive smears. RESULTS: Seventy-one specimens were obtained from 36 patients. Eighteen specimens were positive in 12 patients, all of whom had LRTI. No specimen was positive in patients not diagnosed as having LRTI. The ACB test was positive in 12 of 25 patients with LRTI. Patients with LRTI but negative ACB were more likely to have received prior antibiotic therapy (p less than 0.001). ACB was positive prior to the clinical diagnosis of LRTI in seven of nine patients (av 4.1 days, range 2-6 days) and converted to negative in three specimens obtained seven or more days after starting appropriate antibiotics, while in three specimens it remained positive three-six days post treatment initiation. CONCLUSIONS: The ACB test appears to be highly specific for the presence of LRTI in intubated patients. Sensitivity of the test may be adversely affected by prior antibiotic therapy. A positive ACB test may predict the subsequent development of LRTI. Further study is warranted.\r"

Campylobacter pylori has a urease enzyme (not present in man), which allows diagnosis by a [14C]urea breath test. We compared two noninvasive tests, the breath test and serum ELISA, to biopsy and histologic diagnosis. Twenty-two patients who underwent gastroduodenoscopy for evaluation of possible peptic ulcer disease entered the study. The breath test detected the organism in eight of eight patients biopsy-positive for the organism (sensitivity 100%). The breath test was negative in 12 of the 14 patients who were biopsy-negative (specificity 86%). The ELISA was performed in 14 patients. It was positive in 5 of 5 patients biopsy-positive for the organism (sensitivity 100%) and negative in 7 of 9 patients who were biopsy-negative (specificity 78%). We conclude that both the ELISA and the [14C]urea breath test are excellent noninvasive methods to detect Campylobacter pylori. However, only the breath test is suitable for following the response to treatment, as it detects the presence of the organism rather than an immune response to it.\r"

  ".U": "91085300\r", 
  ".W": "Since Helicobacter pylori infects the gastric mucosa in most patients with chronic duodenal ulcer, infection with this organism has been implicated in the pathogenesis of this common disease. We postulated that if H. pylori is pathogenic in the usual type of duodenal ulcer, it should be less common when duodenal ulcer has another, specific etiology, such as Zollinger-Ellison syndrome. Gastric mucosa was compared from 18 patients with proven Zollinger-Ellison syndrome (17 of whom had had duodenal ulcer disease) and 18 controls with chronic duodenal ulcer without such a diagnosis. All subjects, who were matched for age and sex, had undergone elective gastric resections. Gastric tissues were stained by hematoxylin-eosin and Giemsa and were reviewed by an experienced pathologist who was unaware of the diagnosis. The frequency of H. pylori in patients with Zollinger-Ellison syndrome (8/18) was lower than in controls with duodenal ulcer (16/18; P less than 0.02). Moreover, chronic antral gastritis scores were higher in patients with duodenal ulcer (P less than 0.01). In Zollinger-Ellison syndrome, peak acid output was lower in patients positive (median 22 meq/30 min) compared to those negative for H. pylori (median 32 meq/30 min; P less than 0.02) but serum gastrin was correspondingly lower in patients positive for H. pylori (P less than 0.05). H. pylori infection appears to be more frequent when duodenal ulceration is not associated with another etiology, such as acid hypersecretion in Zollinger-Ellison syndrome. H. pylori infection in Zollinger-Ellison syndrome may also be associated with decreased gastric acid secretion.\r"

The two groups were comparable with respect to demographic features, duration of symptoms, and clinical and endoscopic staging of the disease. Fifteen patients in group I and 17 in group II completed the trial. At four weeks, both groups showed significant clinical improvement (P less than 0.01 for group I and P less than 0.001 for group II) and endoscopic healing (P less than 0.01 for group I and P less than 0.001 for group II). When the two groups were compared, sucralfate enemas showed a significantly better response as assessed clinically (P less than 0.05), although endoscopically the response was not statistically different (P greater than 0.05). We conclude that both treatment regimens are effective in the management of radiation proctitis. Sucralfate enemas give a better clinical response, are tolerated better, and because of the lower cost should be the preferred mode of short-term treatment.\r"

Stored serum from her last pregnancy 17 months previously contained no cytomegalovirus antibodies. A thorough evaluation of her immune system revealed no abnormality. We are aware of only two other cases where seroconversion was documented in normal hosts. Cytomegalovirus infections in the gastrointestinal tract of normal hosts are very unusual but a common cause of morbidity in immunocompromised hosts. We believe that cytomegalovirus may have a role in the pathogenesis of gastrointestinal lesions in nonimmunocompromised patients.\r"

Analysis of lymphocyte subpopulations in peripheral blood showed lymphopenia with a decrease of CD3+ and CD4+ T cells, whereas CD8+ lymphocytes, B cells and NK cells were within the normal range. Fecal loss of lymphocytes as a cause of lymphopenia was evidenced by a marked excretion of 111-indium-labeled peripheral blood mononuclear cells via stool. Proliferative responses against several mitogens were severely reduced as was in vitro IgG production. Delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction against a variety of antigens was absent. Vaccination with tick-borne encephalitis virus, used for primary immunization, and with the recall antigen tetanus toxoid resulted in a blunted antibody response. After pericardectomy, the severity of enteric protein loss declined, serum immunoglobulin levels returned to the normal range, and total lymphocytes and CD3+ and CD4+ counts increased but remained low even 12 months after surgery. Fecal loss of lymphocytes was found to be reduced after pericardectomy, but was higher than that seen in a disease control patient with active inflammatory bowel disease. In vitro immunoglobulin production returned to normal, DTH could be demonstrated against purified protein derivative and proteus antigen, but mitogen-driven blastogenic response of lymphocytes remained low. Revaccination with tick-borne encephalitis and tetanus toxoid antigens seven months after surgery resulted in a dramatic increase of serum levels of antibodies against both antigens, comparable to that seen in healthy control individuals.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Helicobacter pylori (previously Campylobacter pylori) is almost invariably associated with chronic duodenal ulcer disease. The relationship between H. pylori infection and duodenal ulcer in Zollinger-Ellison syndrome is unknown. We investigated the frequency of H. pylori infection in Zollinger-Ellison syndrome and also what effect H. pylori infection had on gastric function in patients with Zollinger-Ellison syndrome. H. pylori infection was diagnosed based on a specific serologic (ELISA) assay based on high-molecular-weight cell-associated proteins of H. pylori. We studied 20 patients with Zollinger-Ellison syndrome; 15 men and 5 women ranging in age from 24 to 71 years, median age 51. Six Zollinger-Ellison syndrome patients had H. pylori infection compared to 100 consecutive patients with chronic recurrent duodenal ulcer disease (P less than 0.05). Pretreatment basal acid output in Zollinger-Ellison syndrome patients ranged from 7.9 to 95.0 mmol/hr, median 35.2. Pentagastrin-stimulated maximal acid output ranged from 8.5 to 132 mmol/hr; median 52.7. Acid secretion was lower in the H. pylori-infected patients than the uninfected patients (BAO 24.5 +/- 6.5 vs 45.4 +/- 6.6, and MAO 44.3 +/- 11.8 vs 67.9 +/- 10.7, for H. pylori infected vs uninfected patients, respectively). The difference in BAO was statistically significant (P less than 0.05). The present results indicate that H. pylori is not a major contributing factor in duodenal ulcer associated with Zollinger-Ellison syndrome. The association of a reduced BAO with H. pylori suggests that these findings may be related.\r"

Of 160 patients with Zollinger-Ellison syndrome, perforation occurred prior to the diagnosis being made in 11 (7%). At surgery, perforations were found in the duodenum in six cases and in the jejunum in five. In no case was tumor identified at emergency surgery, and the diagnosis of Zollinger-Ellison syndrome was made only in the postoperative period when excessive gastric secretions were noted. Neither acid output nor serum gastrin concentration were useful predictors for perforation. The patients, six men and five women, were 27-61 years old (median 48) and one had MEN-1. Three patients had no symptoms prior to the perforation. The other eight had symptoms for 1-15 years, with diarrhea occurring in 45% of the cases. Following the diagnosis of Zollinger-Ellison syndrome, patients were given medication to control gastric acid hypersecretion. Eight patients remained well, but the three patients who had had a partial gastrectomy had a complicated course despite medical therapy. Although features of perforation in Zollinger-Ellison syndrome are not specific, jejunal perforation or perforation associated with a history of diarrhea is suggestive of the diagnosis. Serum gastrin should be measured in every case and a partial gastrectomy avoided.\r"

Clindamycin, an antibiotic previously characterized under physiologic pH conditions, was administered intramuscularly and levels measured in serum and tissue using a high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) technique. The luminal mucosa concentration of clindamycin at 1 hr (pH 5.9) was fivefold greater compared to the concentrations seen under physiologic (pH 2.0) conditions (81.5 micrograms/g vs 15.9 micrograms/g; P less than 0.05) and 10-fold greater at 2 hr (82.7 micrograms/g vs 8.09 micrograms/g; P less than 0.05). There was no difference in peak serum levels between the groups. The finding that an antibiotic with characteristics of a base is thus affected by a nonconservative acid inhibitor such as cimetidine supports the presence of an acidic storage pool as proposed by other investigators. H2-receptor antagonists may be useful therapeutic adjuncts in H. pylori infections by virtue of increasing gastric concentrations of antibiotics that behave as weak bases.\r"

This form of vagotomy is significantly (P less than 0.01) more effective than the traditional truncal vagotomy in depressing the basal acid output (10.9 mumol +/- 1.4 vs 17.4 mumol +/- 1.8, mean +/- SEM, N = 10). It is also more effective (P less than 0.01) than truncal vagotomy in preventing reserpine-stimulated gastric acid secretion (9.9 mumol +/- 0.9 vs 20 mumol +/- 1.5, mean +/- SEM, N = 10). Furthermore, this vagotomy is more powerful (P less than 0.01) than truncal vagotomy in combating insulin-stimulated gastric acid secretion (10.5 mumol +/- 1.1 and 21 mumol +/- 1.6, respectively vs 169 mumol +/- 3.8, mean +/- SEM, N = 10). It is, therefore, concluded that the vagal denervation of the rat stomach achieved by transection vagotomy is more complete than that afforded by truncal vagotomy.\r"

  ".W": "The prevalence of Helicobacter pylori (HP) in the gastric mucosa of patients with chronic atrophic gastritis has been reported to be significantly higher than in normal mucosa. To clarify the role of HP in the etiology of chronic atrophic gastritis, we assessed the effect of ammonia on the gastric mucosal structure in rats, since HP has a strong urease activity and produces abundant amounts of ammonia. Ammonia administered orally at 0.01% and 0.1% as drinking water for two to four weeks decreased the mucosal thickness and the parietal cell number and oxyntic gland number in a dose- and time-dependent manner. The decrease of mucosal thickness was significantly greater in the antral mucosa than in the body mucosa. The border between the antral and body mucosa shifted toward the cardia, reflecting the decrease in oxyntic gland numbers. Furthermore, intracellular mucin was also decreased in a dose- and time-dependent manner, especially in the antral mucosa. Thus, ammonia chronically administered orally in rats led to changes in gastric mucosal structures and functions. The results suggest that the ammonia produced by HP partly plays an etiologic role in chronic atrophic gastritis.\r"

  ".W": "To elucidate the mechanism of intragastric nicotine protection against ethanol-induced gastric mucosal injury seen in a previous report and in our preliminary study, the following studies were performed. Rats were pretreated with naloxone (8 mg/kg intraperitoneal, 0.5 hr prior to study) to block opiate receptors; or capsaicin (125 mg/kg subcutaneous 10 days prior to study) to denervate the afferent sensory fibers; or indomethacin (2.5 mg/kg intragastric or 5 mg/kg subcutaneous, 1 hr prior to study) to inhibit endogenous prostaglandin synthesis. At 1-hr intervals, nicotine (4 mg/kg) or vehicle and 40% ethanol were then given intragastrically. Total gastric corpus mucosal lesion length was measured unbiasedly. In separate studies, gastric mucosal blood flow (GMBF) was assessed by hydrogen gas clearance before and after intragastric nicotine or vehicle; luminal mucus volume, gastric juice volume, and acid output were measured 1 hr after either intragastric nicotine or vehicle administration. The results showed that the acute protective effect of intragastric nicotine was associated with a significantly larger luminal mucus volume. It was not blocked by naloxone, capsaicin, or indomethacin. There was no increase in GMBF. The larger gastric residual volume did not account for the protection. We conclude that the mechanism mediating nicotine protection is unique and is independent of opiate receptors, capsaicin-sensitive afferent sensory nerve fibers, endogenous prostaglandin generation, or dilution of the injurious agent. The increase in luminal gastric mucus volume may contribute to the protective effect of intragastric nicotine against gastric mucosal injury produced by 40% ethanol.\r"

A radionuclide technique was used to measure gastric emptying of eight healthy volunteers. In addition, four parameters [SI (starting index): the lag time in the start of emptying; K value: the emptying rate; T1/2: the half emptying time; 120 min RR: the percent retention at 120 min] were determined for evaluation. Also, the PP response was analyzed according to two parameters: IPPRSI the integrated PP response for periods up to SI, and IPPR120, the integrated PP response for 120 min. The results demonstrated that 5 micrograms of orally administered ornoprostil significantly reduced the gastric emptying rate of solid meal (T1/2 and 120 min RR, P less than 0.05). However, ornoprostil affected neither the basal PP concentrations nor the cephalic phase of PP secretion which was determined as IPPRSI. This thus suggests that ornoprostil affects the gastric motor function without interfering with the vagal-cholinergic pathway to the stomach.\r"

In 194 patients (80%), Helicobacter pylori could be demonstrated histologically from gastric antral biopsies. The presence or absence of Helicobacter pylori was not influenced by age, sex, or use of tobacco or analgesics. Patients with duodenal ulcer or combined gastric and duodenal ulcer had similar gastric acid outputs irrespective of the presence or absence of Helicobacter pylori. However, gastric ulcer patients with Helicobacter had higher basal and maximal acid outputs when compared to patients without Helicobacter (mean basal output: 4.1 mmol/hr vs 2.4, P less than 0.05; mean maximal output 19.5 mmol/hr vs. 14.4, P less than 0.05). Although Helicobacter pylori is associated with both gastric ulcer and duodenal ulcer, its significance may be different in the two diseases.\r"

A rubber balloon was positioned 4 cm below the lower esophageal sphincter (LES) and inflated with progressively larger volumes of air by steps of 50 ml; pressures at the gastric fundus and at the LES were continuously recorded by perfused manometric catheters. Each subject was studied on two separate occasions after randomized double-blind administration of either placebo or 20 mg of domperidone. Symptomatic responses and the manometric data were analyzed at the time of the initial recognition of distension (bloating step) and at the time of reporting pain or up to a maximum of 700 ml of balloon inflation (pain or 700-ml step). On placebo, the volumes of gastric distension were more than two times lower in patients than in control subjects at the bloating step (185 +/- 32 ml vs 470 +/- 40 ml, P = 0.001) and at the pain or 700-ml step (265 +/- 54 ml vs 600 +/- 34 ml, P less than 0.005), while the pressure gradients (pressure at inflation steps minus baseline pressure before beginning inflation) were not statistically different between the two groups.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In this study, we utilized a previously validated self-administered questionnaire to assess the prevalence of symptoms of bowel dysfunction and irritable bowel syndrome in 123 patients with fibromyalgia as compared to 54 patients with degenerative joint disease (DJD) and 46 normal controls. Ninety (73%) of the fibromyalgia patients reported altered bowel function as compared to 20 (37%) DJD patients and none of the normal controls (P less than 0.001). Ninety-nine patients (81%) reported normal alternating with irregular bowel pattern, and 77 (63%) had alternating diarrhea and constipation. In contrast, only 24 (44%) of DJD patients and six (13%) of controls had regular alternating with irregular bowel pattern and only 12 (22%) of the DJD patients and none of the healthy controls had alternating constipation and diarrhea (P less than 0.01). Other bowel dysfunction complaints noted in the fibromyalgia group were abdominal gas (59%), nausea (21%), diarrhea (9%), and constipation (12%). Seventy-nine (64%) fibromyalgia patients reported frequent abdominal pain that was stress-related 47% of the time. Laxative use was frequent in the fibromyalgia group (19%) and absent in the other two groups. Fifty percent of fibromyalgia patients, compared to 28% of DJD patients, felt that their bowel complaints were worse during exacerbations of their joint disease (P less than 0.05). In conclusion, patients with fibromyalgia have a high prevalence of gastrointestinal complaints that should be carefully assessed. If the diagnosis of IBS is confirmed, appropriate treatment may improve patients' symptoms, although this approach requires further study.\r"

We have tested the ability of leukocyte scintigraphy using technetium-99m-hexamethyl propylene amine oxine (HM-PAO) as label to demonstrate the localization of leukocytes in the pancreas during acute pancreatitis. Twenty-eight patients with acute pancreatitis (eight with biliary, 13 with alcoholic, and seven with unknown origin) were studied with leukocyte scintigraphy using planar imaging and single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). Fourteen patients had a mild (group I), II a severe (group II), and three a lethal outcome (group III) of pancreatitis. All patients of group III, six of group II, and two of group I had a positive leukocyte scan. Thus, the sensitivity of leukocyte scintigraphy for the detection of a lethal course of acute pancreatitis was 100%, of a severe course 54%, and of a severe or lethal course 64%. The specificity of a negative scan for a mild pancreatitis was 86%. Comparison of the results of leukocyte scintigraphy with those of contrast enhanced CT showed that six of eight patients with pancreatic necrosis in CT had a positive leukocyte scan, but only five of 20 patients without detectable pancreatic necrosis in CT. In summary, leukocyte infiltration into the pancreas during pancreatitis can be demonstrated by noninvasive leukocyte scintigraphy using technetium-99m-HM-PAO as label. A correlation between the severity of the disease and leukocyte infiltration exists.\r"

Fifteen patients (ages 27-69) had the diagnosis of functional abdominal pain, 19 patients (ages 30-76) had partial biliary obstruction, and 24 patients (ages 15-80) had idiopathic acute recurrent pancreatitis. Resting ductal pressure was similar in the common bile duct and pancreatic duct in all patient groups. In the group with functional pain, basal SO pressure was similar, whether obtained from the common bile duct or pancreatic duct sphincteric segment. Eight of 19 patients with partial biliary obstruction had elevated basal SO pressure. Five of these eight patients had elevated basal SO pressure confined exclusively to the common bile duct segment of the sphincter, while three patients had elevated basal SO in both segments. Conversely seven of 24 patients with acute recurrent pancreatitis had an elevated basal SO pressure, with five patients having pressure elevation only in the pancreatic duct segment while two patients had abnormal basal SO pressure in both segments. We conclude that selective cannulation of the common bile duct and/or the pancreatic duct during manometric study of the SO is necessary in order to diagnose segmental SO dysfunction responsible for partial biliary obstruction or episodes of acute recurrent pancreatitis.\r"

We studied sequential ultrastructural characteristics of the loss of epithelial barrier function in the cat using lanthanum, an electron-opaque tracer, following perfusion of the duct from the tail to the duodenum with infected human bile. Tight junctions between duct epithelial cells were found to become permeable to the tracer as early as after 15 min of exposure. Later, there was progressive disintegration of intercellular junctions and epithelial loss. Lanthanum penetrated the duct epithelium exclusively on an intercellular path. Loss of barrier function of the pancreatic duct epithelium was consistently associated with subsequent development of acute interstitial edematous pancreatitis. There was no association between the degree of duct epithelial damage and the severity of acute pancreatitis. Both bile and a suspension of bacteria alone were not harmful to the pancreas. Sequential perfusion produced acute pancreatitis only when at first bile and then the bacterial suspension was perfused. A reversed succession of perfusates produced no morphologic alterations. We conclude: (1) Increased tight junction permeability is an early lesion in acute bile-induced pancreatitis: (2) loss of duct epithelial barrier function is important for the initiation but not for the severity of the inflammation; and (3) bile renders duct epithelial intercellular junctions vulnerable to Escherichia coli bacteria.\r"

In the remaining 10 patients (group 2), the effects of isosorbide dinitrate (5 mg/SL) administration or placebo were studied. In group 1, food intake caused a significant increase of portal blood flow (from 1038 +/- 539 to 1572 +/- 759 ml/min, P less than 0.02); this effect was due to a significant rise in mean blood velocity (from 18.5 +/- 3.7 to 23.9 +/- 3.9 cm/sec, P less than 0.02). In group 2, isosorbide dinitrate significantly reduced portal blood flow (from 985 +/- 491 to 625 +/- 355 ml/min, P less than 0.05); a significant decline of mean blood velocity (from 18.8 +/- 4.5 to 14.5 +/- 2.5 cm/sec, P less than 0.02) was observed.

Helper T cells increased, but the CD4+ cells decreased due to a marked decrease of suppressor inducer T cells. CD8+ cells increased due to a increase of both cytotoxic T and suppressor T cells. Fc-receptor-positive cells, which increased significantly, were not NK cells but Fc-receptor-bearing T cells. In comparison with immunohistochemical methods, flow cytometric analysis enables more objective quantitation and simpler two-color staining of intrahepatic lymphocytes. Our findings using this method suggest that activated T cells and helper T cells have important roles in hepatitis and that hepatocellular injury may be generated not only by cytotoxic T cells but also by Fc-receptor-bearing T cells.\r"

A representative population sample of 1300 subjects (471 men, 829 women) aged 65-74 yr participated in the study. The participation rate was 71%. The prevalence rates of previously and newly diagnosed NIDDM and IGT, based on a history of diabetes and an oral glucose tolerance test, were 8.7, 7.0, and 17.8% in men and 11.7, 7.1, and 19.1% in women. Thus, 33.8% of men and 37.9% of women had abnormal glucose tolerance according to World Health Organization criteria. Obesity (body mass index greater than or equal to 27 kg/m2 in men and greater than or equal to 25 kg/m2 in women) and central obesity (waist-hip ratio greater than or equal to 0.98 in men and greater than or equal to 0.89 in women) doubled the prevalence of IGT or NIDDM. The combination of obesity and a family history of diabetes was associated with a more marked increase in the prevalence of IGT or NIDDM in men than in women. Simultaneous presence of obesity, central obesity, and a family history of diabetes was associated with a threefold increase in the prevalence of IGT or NIDDM (65.4 vs. 24.1% in men, 52.8 vs. 19.6% in women, P less than 0.001). The major risk factors for NIDDM, e.g., obesity, central fat distribution, and a family history of diabetes, explained 10% of the variance in 2-h glucose values in multiple regression analysis. In conclusion, the prevalence of IGT and NIDDM was high in elderly subjects. Although obesity, central fat distribution, and a family history of diabetes were significantly associated with the increased prevalence of IGT or NIDDM, they explained only a minor proportion of the variance in 2-h glucose values.\r"

This study examined this relationship in a population-based sample of type I diabetic subjects participating in the Wisconsin Epidemiologic Study of Diabetic Retinopathy. Four hundred five adults (aged greater than or equal to 21 yr) with type I diabetes, who were diagnosed before age 30 yr, were studied from 1980 to 1982 and in a follow-up examination from 1984 to 1986. Weight gain over the 4-yr interval averaged 1.8 +/- 5.9 kg. Weight gain was significantly associated (r = -0.26, P less than 0.001) with improvements in glycosylated hemoglobin levels; the quartile of subjects with the greatest improvements in glycemic control gained 3.4 kg, whereas the quartile of subjects with the smallest improvements in glycemic control lost 0.6 kg. Weight gain was also correlated with increases in the number of shots of insulin per day and change in the treatment regimen from one type of insulin to a combination of short- and long-acting insulins. These results suggest that weight gain may be an adverse consequence of improved glycemic control. Efforts to better understand the mechanism explaining weight gain and to prevent weight gain are needed.\r"

At admission, patients reported the frequency of exercise, blood glucose monitoring, and meal skipping for the previous 2 wk. Metabolic control over the previous 8-12 wk was determined from glycosylated hemoglobin assays. In cross-sectional analysis controlling for patient sociodemographic and health characteristics, glycosylated hemoglobin levels were positively related to meal skipping (P = 0.0008) and negatively related to the frequency of blood glucose monitoring (P = 0.0025). Self-care behaviors explained 26% of the variance in glycosylated hemoglobin levels in NIDDM patients. Multivariate modeling demonstrated no significant interaction effects between insulin treatment and self-care on metabolic control. In conclusion, these findings support the clinical significance of self-care activities for metabolic control in NIDDM patients, particularly meal skipping and blood glucose monitoring.\r"

  ".W": "Triflusal (2-acetoxy-4-trifluormethylbenzoic acid) is a platelet-antiaggregant drug that selectively inhibits thromboxane synthesis with little effect on prostacyclin production. In this study, we evaluated the effect of 5-day administration of 900 mg/day triflusal on glomerular filtration rate (GFR), renal plasma flow (RPF), urinary albumin excretion (UAE), thromboxane B2 (TXB2), 6-ketoprostaglandin F1 alpha (PGF1 alpha), and PGE2 in nine normotensive insulin-dependent diabetic patients with UAE between 30 and 103 micrograms/min. Plasma TXB2 and plasma renin activity (PRA) were also determined. After administration of triflusal, we observed a reduction in microalbuminuria (59 +/- 25 vs. 33 +/- 22 micrograms/min, P less than 0.01), an increase in RPF (648 +/- 119 vs. 722 +/- 134 ml.min-1 x 1.73 m-2, P less than 0.01), and a reduction in filtration fraction (0.24 +/- 0.04 vs. 0.20 +/- 0.03, P less than 0.01). Triflusal produced a significant reduction in both plasma TXB2 (130 +/- 39 vs. 52 +/- 32 pg/ml, P less than 0.02) and urine TXB2 (523 +/- 249 vs. 312 +/- 11 pg/min, P less than 0.02), without changes in PRA and UAE of 6-keto-PGF1 alpha and PGE2. Metabolic control and arterial blood pressure did not change during the study. These results suggest that platelet-antiaggregant therapy can reduce microalbuminuria in diabetic patients. This effect could be mediated by a reduction in the transglomerular hydraulic pressure through a vasodilation of efferent arterioles secondary to renal thromboxane synthesis inhibition.\r"

The prevalence is increasing in Blacks, and there is evidence that it is accompanied by a greater severity of diabetic complications. In addition, mortality figures are higher in Blacks, and Black women are more seriously affected than Black men. Although the reasons for this are unclear, some factors stand out as important. These include obesity, socioeconomic status, and genetics. Obesity is a severe problem in Blacks, particularly in women. Both the degree and the distribution of fat may contribute greatly to the prevalence of diabetes in Blacks. Although the prevalence of obesity is higher in the poor economic groups, multivariate analysis suggests that poverty cannot explain all of the excess obesity that occurs in the Black population. More research is needed into a possible genetic predisposition of Blacks to obesity and diabetes and into the interrelationship between the two conditions in this racial group.\r"

With restriction-fragment-length polymorphisms and genomic sequencing, various candidate loci are being evaluated. Evidence that multiple genes are involved is only circumstantial. If NIDDM is genetically heterogeneous and also influenced by environmental components, population associations and linkage analyses in families may not be as easily interpreted as for diseases involving single major gene defects.\r"

Long-term adherence to dietary or weight-control regimens requires that the patient evaluate and restructure established eating and physical activity patterns. With the use of the social action theory as a conceptual framework, this complex behavioral change task can be understood as a function of the interplay of various self-regulatory mechanisms. These mechanisms are influenced by the person's capabilities for making changes, his/her physical condition and general health status, the physical and social environmental context, and the person's material and social resources. Many of these factors may differ for Blacks and Whites in a direction that suggests a lesser potential for effective diet and weight-loss therapy among Black NIDDM patients. For example, compared with Whites, Blacks are more likely to have limited incomes, low educational attainment, ambivalence about weight control, multiple health problems, and high-fat high-sodium low-fiber diets or food preferences. However, some evidence suggests that state-of-the-art counseling approaches can be as effective for Blacks as for Whites. The challenge is to adapt the types of approaches suggested by the social action theory for culturally appropriate and cost-effective delivery in Black community health-care settings.\r"

When performed on a regular basis, exercise may improve glycemic control and improve several risk factors for coronary heart disease including hypertriglyceridemia, hypertension, and hyperinsulinemia. In addition, it may be a useful adjunct to diet in producing weight loss. The metabolic benefits of exercise in part appear to be related to its ability to enhance insulin sensitivity. Benefits are short lived after discontinuing exercise. Because of problems with compliance and concurrent medical problems, many patients with type II diabetes are not good candidates for an exercise-diet program. For this reason, the optimum target population may be people at risk for type II diabetes and premature atherosclerosis. Such a population might include the offspring of patients with these disorders and individuals with impaired glucose tolerance, hyperinsulinemia, gestational diabetes, and/or an android pattern of fat distribution. Type II diabetes is more common in Blacks than in the general population. In most instances, it is associated with cardiovascular risk factors benefited by exercise. Despite this, there are no available studies regarding the effects of regular exercise in Blacks with type II diabetes or those at risk for it.\r"

One hundred thirty-seven studies were identified, of which 57 were selected as references for this article. Diabetes is associated with the development of cardiomyopathy, independent of coronary atherosclerosis. Pathological studies show myocardial hypertrophy and fibrosis; microvascular pathology is also present, but all of these pathological findings have an uncertain relationship to myocardial failure. Hemodynamic findings of both congestive and restrictive cardiomyopathy have been described. Noninvasive studies revealed abnormal systolic and diastolic function in many diabetic subjects, particularly in the presence of diabetic complications and/or hypertension. Experimental studies have focused on the mildly diabetic dog and the severely diabetic rat. One year of diabetes in dogs resulted in decreased left ventricular compliance and increased interstitial connective tissue. Studies in the diabetic rat showed a marked slowing of contraction and relaxation. Chronic insulin therapy reversed the changes in the rat model. Combining hypertension with diabetes in the rat resulted in increased myocardial and coronary microvascular pathology and greater changes in isolated muscle function, electrophysiology, and contractile protein biochemistry. Many hypertensive diabetic rats died spontaneously, showing signs of congestive heart failure. Diabetic cardiomyopathy is a significant cause of heart failure in diabetic subjects and occurs more frequently in those with microvascular complications and/or hypertension. Clinical studies are needed to clarify the natural history of this disorder, focusing on the benefits of tight control of hyperglycemia and treatment of associated hypertension. Experimental studies will clarify the pathophysiology and contribute to improved therapy. The high prevalence of diabetes and hypertension in Blacks makes these considerations especially relevant to this population.\r"

  ".W": "A significant segment of the Black population is affected by chronic diabetes, and most of them are subjected to severe cardiovascular, renal, and neurological complications that shorten survival and diminish quality of life. One of the important pathogenetic mechanisms under intensive investigation is advanced tissue glycosylation. Tissue and cell surface proteins modified nonenzymatically by glucose are shown to be highly active in protein cross-linking and have been implicated in tissue damage. Such protein-glucose interactions, called advanced glycosylation end products (AGEs), are processed by macrophages through a high-affinity receptor. Coupling of AGE proteins to their AGE receptors results in their degradation and removal and, simultaneously, in synthesis and secretion of pluripotential cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor and interleukin 1. This suggests that AGE may act normally as a signal for growth-promoting factor secretion in a coordinated replacement process during tissue remodeling. In chronic diabetes, however, where accelerated accumulation of tissue AGE occurs, a disturbance of this balance may lead to several pathological, lytic, and/or proliferative responses like those in the vasculopathy of diabetes. Progress has been made with the discovery of aminoguanidine HCl, an AGE inhibitor, which has prevented significant pathology in short-term diabetic animal studies.\r"

This was a cross-sectional study of 71 Black NIDDM patients with diagnosed diabetes duration from 1 mo to 21 yr. Hyperglycemia was regulated and stabilized before patients were entered into the study. GFR and RPF were determined by the clearance of [125I]iothalamate and 131I-labeled hippuran, respectively, with a constant-infusion technique and four urine collection periods. Hyperfiltration, as defined by a GFR of greater than 140 ml.min-1.1.73 m-2, was found in 7 of 20 patients (35%) with newly diagnosed (less than 2 yr duration) NIDDM. The percentage of patients with hyperfiltration decreased with increasing duration of diagnosed diabetes. Decreasing GFR and RPF occurred with increasing duration of diagnosed diabetes. In conclusion, renal hemodynamic changes in Black Americans with NIDDM are similar to those known to occur in White populations with IDDM.\r"

The prevalence of smooth muscle and nuclear autoantibodies was higher in gestational diabetic subjects. Gestational diabetic subjects who required insulin for glycemic control were more obese, had a lower frequency of the Bf-F phenotype and a higher frequency of the Bf-F1 phenotype, and had a lower frequency of the type 2 allele at the polymorphic locus adjacent to the insulin gene. Restriction-fragment-length polymorphisms flanking the insulin and apolipoprotein A-I and C-III genes, although not associated with gestational diabetes mellitus, may be associated with hyperlipidemia and subsequent atherosclerosis.\r"

The prevalence and rate of diabetes in this age-group are higher in Blacks than in Whites. The rate of blindness from diabetic eye disease is also higher in Blacks than in Whites. Severe macular edema, the most frequent cause of decreased vision in diabetic retinopathy, appears to be more common in Blacks. Risk factors for developing macular edema include poorly controlled hypertension, hyperglycemia, and duration of disease. The higher prevalence of hypertension in Blacks may contribute to the increased severity of diabetic retinopathy. Further evaluation is necessary to determine the influence of race on the severity of diabetic retinopathy.\r"

  ".U": "91085350\r", 
  ".W": "Overnutrition manifested by obesity has emerged as a major health problem in affluent countries. In spite of increased interest in fitness, obesity is on the increase in the United States. This is particularly so among children and adolescents. Although obesity is associated with many risk factors for diseases, the mechanisms whereby it enhances disease risk are not fully understood. Such an understanding is needed to develop strategies for management of these conditions. In this report we suggest that overnutrition produces clinical diseases only in individuals who already possess a metabolic weakness or \"defect\" in a given system. In the absence of such underlying defects, overnutrition, or obesity, is well tolerated. One of the most common consequences of obesity is dyslipidemia, that is, elevations of very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) triglycerides and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and low concentrations of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol. The major effect of overnutrition on lipoprotein metabolism is to stimulate the production of VLDL. For patients who have an underlying defect in lypolysis of VLDL triglycerides, hypertriglyceridemia will develop in the obese state. For those who have defective clearance of LDL, obesity will accentuate hypercholesterolemia. Both of these effects can be explained by overproduction of VLDL, due to obesity, combined with a genetic defect in clearance of VLDL or LDL. The mechanism whereby obesity causes a lowering of HDL cholesterol is uncertain, although it could enhance removal of HDL by an excess of adipose tissue. Another disease associated with obesity is cholesterol gallstones. The presence of obesity more than doubles the risk for gallstones. Two underlying factors increase the danger for gallstones: a deficiency of hepatic secretion of bile acids and a tendency for formation of cholesterol crystals in bile. Overnutrition promotes the synthesis of whole-body cholesterol, and the only route for excretion of this excess cholesterol is through the biliary tree.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

Competencies to be de-emphasized included major surgical procedures, specific technical and procedural aspects of hospital care, and obstetrics (except in rural areas). In addition, panelists thought the basic principles and values of family medicine will not change, although there will be emphasis on managed health care, increased care of the elderly, and changes in the professional status of the physician. Curricular changes will require help from other disciplines, new educational settings, and additional faculty and financial resources.\r"

Of the 2,363 questionnaires mailed and reviewed by graduates, 1,583 were returned (66.8% response rate). Respondents completed the survey within approximately 18 months of completing residency training. The results indicate that overall satisfaction with training, as well as the perception of adequacy of preparation for practice, lessened with increasing university affiliation of the training program (P less than .05). The findings reported here also suggest that university based family practice residency graduates are much more likely to report being treated like \"second-class citizens\" by attendings and residents of other specialties. In addition, satisfaction with educational rotation experiences is less if competing residencies exist at the institution sponsoring the residency.\r"

In particular, it is argued that the psychosocial M & M can highlight previously missed or trivialized dimensions of patient, family, and physician interactions which affect care and, simultaneously, can help address the affective distress of the physician-in-training which results from a difficult and painful case. Definition, goals, and a theoretical formulation are provided, as well as a detailed description of how a psychosocial M & M might be conducted. A discussion of potential difficulties and anecdotal positive outcomes are also included.\r"

In-person consultation frequency averaged 25.5%, but ranged from 9% to 53% among physicians (P = .02). Male patients were seen more frequently than female patients (P = .008) Younger patients were seen more frequently than older patients (P = .01). Calls for trauma, obstetrics, and respiratory complaints were more likely to result in in-person consultations than were calls for other problems (P less than .00001). Categorical modeling analysis, used for adjustment, confirmed differences in consultation frequencies both among physicians and due to the nature of the caller's complaint. Neither the time of the call, the patient's race, nor the physician's sex, marital status, level of training, distance lived from the family practice center, or personality type as measured by the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator were associated with the frequency of consultation. Additional research is needed to determine the factors responsible for physician differences in after-hours in-person consultation frequency.\r"

This study addressed these three issues: 1) A definition of physician humanism was developed based on the current literature; 2) an instrument was designed that measured patients' perceptions of humanism in their family physicians; and 3) health outcome variables were measured relative to these perceptions. The design was a cross-sectional survey of 185 randomly selected patients from two family practice sites. The questionnaire consisted of a humanism scale, in addition to items to assess patient satisfaction and patients' adherence to medical advice regarding exercise, diet, and smoking cessation. A positive association was found between perceived physician humanism and patient satisfaction. Greater success in patients' attempts to quit smoking was associated with higher physician humanism. The implications of these findings for evaluation and training of health care providers and patients' use of health care services are discussed.\r"

  ".W": "Although patients regularly see the same physicain for medical care, little is known about the effects of physician-patient familiarity on important visit outcomes. In a study of visits made to 79 physicians in 11 primary care settings, investigators sought to determine: 1) whether patient recall of prescription medication changes improved as physician-patient familiarity increased, and 2) whether characteristics which predicted recall for newer patients also predicted recall for intermediate and established patients. Sixty-six percent of patients recalled all medication changes recommended during the visit. While recall did not improve as physician-patient familiarity increased, predictors of recall did differ. Generally, the more drug information the physician gave during the concluding segment of the visit, the fewer drug changes the patient remembered. However, this relationship reversed as physician-patient familiarity increased. Elderly patients demonstrated diminished recall regardless of the number of previous visits. The findings suggest that the lengthy provision of drug information actually succeeds in heightening medication recall only when the physician and patient have a well-established relationship. In earlier stages, asking patients to restate recommendations may be a more effective strategy to enhance patient recall.\r"

This study was conducted to determine factors important in the decision of patients with panic disorder to seek health care, where they go for care, and their complaints to physicians. Overall, 44% of patients did not enter the health care system with complaints of either nervousness or panic attacks. Certain factors were found to be important to the patient's decision to seek care and where to go for care, including being white, having panic-related symptoms, educational level, and feeling free to discuss panic. Gender, marital status, age, phobic avoidance, limited-symptom attacks, and fear during panic were not important factors in the decision to seek health care. Through a better understanding of the important factors, health care givers can be more sensitive to the diagnosis of panic disorder in patients who do seek care and look for ways of reaching those who do not.\r"

The AIDS epidemic is \"The Plague.\" We seek the optimally therapeutic relationship, embodied in the metaphor of the covenant. There is a fundamental human possibility of healing through dying. \"Death teaches us to live.\" We advocate asking AIDS patients the explicit question, \"How do you want me to work with you?\" This can generate conversations that facilitate congruence in relationships. A reluctance to talk about uncertainties and limits is a major source of preventable ethical conflict and a major obstacle to fulfillment of the therapeutic possibilities of the doctor-patient relationship. The Durable Power of Attorney for Health Care (DPA) can be helpful in facilitating discussions with patients and their families. Successful \"preventive bioethics\" is communication that opens for the patient and doctor the broadest possibilities of hearing, understanding, and expressing. The doctor as parent, fighter, technician, teacher, and covenanter may be important roles at appropriate moments with a given patient who may be experiencing the disease variably as infectious chaos, brutal enemy, spiritual challenge, or opportunity for growth. The context of such communication is a real relationship that includes love, respect, humor, hope, and genuine interest in how this other person lives.\r"

Patient-physician encounters were rated in terms of propriety of charges by consensus of two faculty physicians and compared to the actual level of service marked on the encounter form. Private practice experience for faculty resulted in less undercharging (21% of encounters undercharged versus 31% for faculty without that experience, P = .03). Physicians with private practice experience undercharged on average $.36 per encounter, versus $1.94 for providers without that experience (Kruskal-Wallis test, P = .27). Physicians with private practice experience also tended to perform more procedures but not to bill for more. Academic family physicians with private practice experience demonstrated more appropriate billing practices for professional services, but ideally preference for this type of academic physician should be based on other attributes, such as breadth of experience and efficiency in patient care.\r"

Ten patients with laryngeal symptoms but none of the controls had laryngoscopic findings consistent with reflux laryngitis. Dual-site ambulatory pH recordings were obtained with the pH electrodes spaced 15 cm apart and with the proximal sensor positioned just distal to the upper esophageal sphincter. Patients in the three groups (disease controls: group 1; patients with symptoms but without laryngoscopic findings: group 2; and patients with both laryngeal symptoms and findings: group 3) were comparable in terms of age, smoking habit, the presence of esophagitis, and distal esophageal acid exposure. Proximal esophageal acid exposure was, however, significantly increased in groups 2 and 3, and nocturnal proximal esophageal acidification occurred in over half of these patients but in none of the group 1 patients. We conclude that the subset of reflux patients who experience laryngeal symptoms show significantly more proximal esophageal acid exposure (especially nocturnally) and often have laryngoscopic findings of posterior laryngitis not observed in control reflux patients.\r"

Ten weeks after operation, the gastric enterochromaffin (ECL)-like cell density in the remaining part of the oxyntic mucosa had increased significantly. In the present study, the effects on the gastric ECL cells of lifelong persistent hypergastrinemia induced by partial (75%) corpectomy have been investigated. Seventy-five partially corpectomized rats and 40 control rats were investigated for plasma gastrin and oxyntic mucosal changes in a 124-week study. The partially corpectomized rats showed increased plasma gastrin levels after the operation; the mean increase compared with the controls was almost 10-fold during the entire study. The remaining oxyntic mucosa of the partially corpectomized rats differed from that of control rats in two respects, showing first general hypertrophy and second a marked hyperplasia of argyrophil ECL cells. The degree and incidence of these changes increased towards the end of the study, i.e., in the aging rats. An age-related increase in ECL-cell density occurred spontaneously also in the control rats but to a lesser extent than in the partially corpectomized group. ECL-cell carcinoids were found in the oxyntic mucosa of 26 of the 75 partially corpectomized rats. The first carcinoid was found 78 weeks after the beginning of the study. Six rats with carcinoids (23%) were found before week 104 (2 years) and the remainder, 20 (77%), were discovered later. No carcinoid tumor was found in the control rats. It is concluded that lifelong hypergastrinemia induced by partial corpectomy leads to the development of ECL-cell carcinoids in the oxyntic mucosa of some rats towards the end of their life span. This observation strongly supports the hypothesis that the gastric ECL-cell carcinoids found in rats treated with antisecretory drugs are caused by long-standing hypergastrinemia developing secondary to inhibition of gastric acid secretion.\r"

  ".W": "Intracerebroventricular prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) inhibits stimulated gastric acid secretion; however, the central site of action is unknown. Specific PGE2 binding sites have been localized to the ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus and central amygdala (A). The nuclear accumbens has been shown to play a role in central neurotensin-induced antisecretory effects. These studies tested the hypothesis that microinjections of PGE2 into the ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus, central amygdala, and nuclear accumbens inhibit stimulated gastric acid secretion. The hippocampus served as a cerebral control region. Two days before the experiments, metal cannulas were stereotaxically positioned bilaterally into specific areas of the brain, and metal gastric cannulas were operatively implanted, under nembutal anesthesia, in male 250-g Sprague-Dawley rats. On the experimental day, the rats, fasted for 14 hours, were given saline or PGE2 (0.1-1.0 micrograms in 0.2 microL/side) through the central cannulas 10 minutes before administering pentagastrin (40 micrograms/kg SC). Gastric secretion was measured at 30-minute intervals and expressed as acid output, micromoles per hour. Acid output (mean +/- SE) in control animals was 161 +/- 14 mumol/h. Prostaglandin E2 administration at doses of 0.10, 0.50, and 1.0 micrograms/side (a) into ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus reduced acid output to 53 +/- 11,* 36 +/- 10,* and 27 +/- 11* mumol/h regularly; (b) into NACB reduced acid output to 157 +/- 36, 60 +/- 12,* and 38 +/- 12* mumol/h; and (c) into A reduced acid output to 144 +/- 31, 141 +/- 26, and 90 +/- 19* mumol/h, respectively (*P less than 0.05 by Neuman-Keuls test). Prostaglandin E2 (0.50 micrograms/side) administration into hippocampus had no significant effect on acid output (134 +/- 28 mumol/h). Although central PGE2 administration was associated with hyperthermia, this occurred at lower doses than those required to inhibit acid secretion. Prostaglandin E2 administration into specific brain areas known to have PGE2 receptors, the central amygdala and ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus, and into nuclear accumbens inhibits stimulated gastric acid secretion. These observations suggest that PGE2 may have a physiological role in the central control of gastric acid secretion.\r"

This study documents the prevalence of H. pylori in 28 patients with pernicious anemia and compares the findings with those of a group of 28 age-, race-, and sex-matched asymptomatic control subjects. All subjects underwent endoscopy with biopsy of the gastric antrum and corpus. A sample of serum was obtained before endoscopy for determination of antibodies (immunoglobulin A and immunoglobulin G) to H. pylori. The prevalence of H. pylori (by biopsy) in patients with pernicious anemia was significantly less than that in controls (11% vs. 71%, P less than 0.0001). All patients with pernicious anemia had abnormalities of corpus histology (inflammation and/or atrophy). In addition, 50% of patients with pernicious anemia had a lymphocytic infiltration of the antrum. All controls with H. pylori had gastritis, 50% having active chronic gastritis. Atrophic changes of the corpus were more commonly found in patients with pernicious anemia (75% vs. 7%, P less than 0.0001). Serology and biopsy results correlated poorly in the patients with pernicious anemia: all 5 patients with positive serology results had negative biopsy results, whereas all 3 patients with positive cultures on biopsy had negative serological studies. In conclusion, patients with pernicious anemia are protected from infection with H. pylori, and H. pylori does not passively colonize mucosa inflamed by an unrelated process.\r"

Rats were fasted for 22 hours, placed in restraint cages, and immersed in water to the xiphoid process for 6 hours. Animals were killed either immediately after the period of stress or at 2-hour intervals up to 24 hours thereafter. Duodenal mucosa was examined histologically, and ornithine decarboxylase and polyamine levels were measured. Ornithine decarboxylase activity was increased significantly up to 6 hours following stress, peaking at 4 hours at a level 10 times the prestress control. By 8 hours, enzyme activity had returned to near normal. Increases in mucosal putrescine, spermidine, and spermine content paralleled the changes in ornithine decarboxylase activity and peaked 4 hours after stress. Stress resulted in microscopic damage evidenced by a nearly complete absence of villi. Significant macroscopic lesions were not present following stress. Mucosal repair was evident 12 hours after stress and almost complete by 24 hours, although the restituted villi were short and blunted. The decreases in mucosal DNA, RNA, and protein content caused by stress were restored and reached near-normal levels 12 hours after the period of stress. In animals given the specific inhibitor of ornithine decarboxylase, alpha-difluoromethylornithine, increases in duodenal mucosal ornithine decarboxylase activity and polyamine levels were inhibited and mucosal repair was almost completely prevented following stress. alpha-Difluoromethylornithine also prevented the recovery of DNA, RNA, and protein content of the duodenal mucosa. These results indicate that duodenal mucosal damage following stress is repaired rapidly; the repair process is accompanied by significant increases in ornithine decarboxylase activity and polyamine levels; and the increases in ornithine decarboxylase and polyamines are absolutely required for the normal repair of the mucosa.\r"

Segments of distal ileum stripped of longitudinal muscle and bathed on both sides with a Krebs'-bicarbonate buffer responded to cholecystokinin octapeptide when studied under short-circuited conditions. Cholecystokinin octapeptide (0.5-50 nmol/L) evoked a transient (4-10-minute) increase in transepithelial potential difference and short-circuit current upon application to the serosal side. Maximal increases in short-circuit current, achieved at 50-500 nmol/L, were 67 +/- 11 microA/cm2, whereas half-maximal effects occurred at a concentration of 0.7 +/- 0.2 nmol/L. Pretreatment of the tissues with 0.5 mumol/L atropine reduced the maximal short-circuit response to cholecystokinin octapeptide by 53%. The change in short-circuit current due to cholecystokinin octapeptide was nearly abolished by pretreatment with 0.5 mumol/L tetrodotoxin, suggesting neuronal involvement. Cholecystokinin octapeptide-induced increases in short-circuit current were halved by removal of serosal buffer Ca2+ and were abolished in Cl(-)- and HCO3(-)-free buffer. The cholecystokin-receptor antagonists proglumide and lorglumide shifted the concentration-response curve for cholecystokinin octapeptide competitively to the right, having antagonists potencies of 130 and 0.03 mumol/L, respectively. Cerulein (0.1-500 nmol/L) also increased short-circuit current, whereas nonsulfated cholecystokinin octapeptide was ineffective. In conclusion, cholecystokinin octapeptide seems to act at neuronal cholecystokinin receptors to stimulate mucosal anion secretion, in part, by releasing acetylcholine.\r"

To address these problems, we identified all persons with confirmed ulcerative colitis (n = 2509) or Crohn's disease (n = 1469) in the Uppsala Health Care Region from 1965 to 1983. Age-specific incidence rates by sex were slightly greater for males with ulcerative colitis and females with Crohn's disease. Incidence rates for ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease were higher in urban than rural areas. The annual incidence rate of ulcerative colitis increased from less than 7 per 100,000 to more than 12 per 100,000 during the study period, while the rate for Crohn's disease remained between 5 and 7 per 100,000. The increase in the incidence of ulcerative colitis was the result of a marked increase in the number of patients with ulcerative proctitis. Analyses by 5-year birth cohorts suggest that those born from 1945 through 1954 were at higher risk for ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, and that this effect was accounted for by those born in the first half of the year. The seasonality in the cohort effect, combined with the urban preponderance of disease, suggests that environmental causes may be involved in ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease.\r"

Rats were iron loaded with three weekly IM injections of 50 mg of iron dextran and were rendered iron deficient with an iron-deficient diet for 3 weeks. Iron status was assessed by hepatic and gut mucosal iron determination. Uptake and transfer of 59Fe-ascorbate was measured in an isolated perfused segment of transplanted intestine 48 hours after transplantation. The mean rate of uptake of 59Fe from an iron-loaded intestine (mean mucosal iron concentration, 7.97 +/- 2.02 mumol/g) was 431 +/- 27 nmol/30 min, and from an iron-deficient intestine (mean mucosal iron concentration, 1.35 +/- .84 mumol/g), 743 +/- 222 nmol/30 min (P less than 0.001). The mean transfer of 59Fe from the mucosal cell to the body through an iron-loaded intestine was 63 +/- 22 nmol/30 min, and through an iron-deficient intestine was 86 +/- 32 nmol/30 min (P less than 0.05). These results suggest that the gut mucosal iron concentration regulates the uptake and transfer of iron in the intestine.\r"

The pS2 gene belongs to a family of genes encoding peptides that contain a conserved 5-cysteine domain, the P domains. Although the function of the pS2 protein is unknown, it has been suggested that it may have cell growth stimulatory activity. We report here that expression of the pS2 gene in the digestive tract, which is normally restricted to the stomach, is strongly induced by mucosal ulcerations elsewhere in the tract, most notably in Crohn's disease. pS2 gene expression is restricted to the mucosal layers adjacent to the ulcerations, in a region where a novel epidermal growth factor-secreting cell lineage was shown to be induced by mucosal ulceration. The human hSP gene, which contains a tandem duplication of the pS2 gene P domain and is coexpressed with the pS2 gene in normal stomach mucosa but not in breast cancers, is also expressed in Crohn's disease. We suggest that pS2 gene expression may provide a useful marker for mucosal ulcerations of the digestive tract.\r"

Long-chain lipids and glycerol both induced a decrease in the rate of basal antral activity. This effect was found to depend on the state of lipid hydrolysis (triglycerides, monoglycerides, and fatty acids) and was most marked with monolein, linoleic acid, and glycerol. With the middle-chain lipids used, these effects were only slight; short-chain lipids did not induce any visible changes in gastric activity. All these effects were prevented by cervical bivagotomy. It was concluded that the two types of lipid-sensitive vagal receptors, which we recently showed to exist in the small intestine, trigger an inhibitory enterogastric reflex that contributes to the regulation of gastric emptying.\r"

If brush border myosin I were to function primarily as a myosinlike molecule powering cellular or microvillar motility, one might expect it to be found in a variety of tissues with microvilli such as the renal brush border and bile canaliculus. On the other hand, a more specialized function such as participation in vitamin D regulated calcium transport might dictate a more restricted tissue distribution for brush border myosin I. To determine the tissue distribution of brush border myosin I, we purified this protein to apparent homogeneity, generated antisera to it, and used the antisera to localize the protein within the intestinal epithelial cell by immunocytochemistry. We then screened a variety of other tissues (brain, lung, heart, liver, spleen, pancreas, kidney, and skeletal muscle) both for calmodulin-binding proteins as well as for brush border myosin I using Western blots and immunofluorescence. Our results indicate that the intestinal brush border myosin I is limited in its distribution to the intestinal brush border.\r"

The presence of cholera toxin-induced secretion does not affect pH action measured by in vivo perfusion of the rat ileum. We examined the interaction of pH and cyclic adenosine monophosphate-induced secretion in the rabbit ileum. We found that alterations in arterial pH did not affect ileal absorption in the rabbit in the presence of cholera toxin-induced secretion. This was true whether transport was studied during in vivo ileal perfusion of anesthetized rabbits or by measuring Na+ and Cl- fluxes across isolated, short-circuited tissues in the Ussing chamber. The effects of pH also were blocked when normal rabbit ileum was exposed to 1 mmol/L dibutyryl cyclic adenosine monophosphate in vitro. By contrast, alterations in bathing solution pH affected ileal absorption in the rat in the presence and absence of cyclic adenosine monophosphate. Similarly, exposure to cyclic adenosine monophosphate did not affect the response of the rat colon to PCO2. These findings suggest that the apparently independent effects of pH and cyclic adenosine monophosphate in the rat ileum are not universal. In tissues such as the rabbit ileum, the mechanisms of pH and cyclic adenosine monophosphate action may have biochemical or physiological pathways in common.\r"

Seven twin pairs were concordant for the presence of ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease, whereas twin siblings of 10 ulcerative colitis probands and 9 Crohn's disease probands were not known to have inflammatory bowel disease. Content of one chromatographically defined component of colonic mucin, designated HCM species IV, was reduced in both patients with ulcerative colitis (1040 +/- 300 cpm/10,000 cpm total HCM) and their apparently healthy twins (1340 +/- 540 cpm/10,000 cpm total HCM) compared with control subjects (4030 +/- 1,000 cpm/10,000 cpm total HCM). Composition of mucin in Crohn's disease patients and their nonaffected twins was not significantly different than in controls. These observations suggest that altered profiles of mucin glycoprotein may be present before the onset of ulcerative colitis and may be genetically defined. Conversely, it appears that alterations in glycoproteins only are not sufficient to initiate mucosal inflammation.\r"

Patients had significantly lower basal and squeeze pressures than control subjects (P less than 0.01). The results of ultrasonographic studies of the anal canal in 7 patients and 7 control subjects suggest that this decrease in muscle strength is partly explained by muscular atrophy. In addition, patients with myotonic dystrophy showed exaggerated rebound contractions following and sphincter relaxation that was induced by rectal distention. The pattern of this response and the results of electromyographic studies in 6 patients with myotonic dystrophy suggest that such abnormalities are explained by a neurogenic defect rather than a myotonic response of the anal musculature. It is concluded that patients with myotonic dystrophy show a multitude of defects in the anal sphincter that are an expression of myopathy, muscular atrophy, and neural abnormalities.\r"

Continuous electric stimulation of the pelvic nerve at 4 Hz or intermittent electric burst stimulation of the pelvic nerve at 40 Hz during 1 second with 10-second rest periods produced a marked release of NKA-like immunoreactivity (NKA-LI) and SP-LI from the colon to blood (P less than 0.001). Reflex activation of the pelvic nerve by mechanical stimulation of the anus or rectal distension produced a less pronounced release of NKA-LI and SP-LI from the colon to blood (P less than 0.01). There was a simultaneous colonic contraction and vasodilation during each nerve stimulation. Reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography showed presence of NKA, NKA oxide, NKA (3-10)/NKA (4-10), and neuropeptide K (NPK) in colonic tissues and release of all these molecular forms except NPK on nerve stimulation. Substance P and SP oxide were present both in colonic tissue extracts and in released material. Close intraarterial infusions of NKA, neurokinin B, SP, NPK, eledoisin, and physalaemin at doses of 0.1-100 pmol/min induced dose-dependent contractions of the proximal and distal colon (P less than 0.001) and vasodilatation (P less than 0.001), NKA being the most potent. The effects of the tachykinins were reduced after tetrodotoxin (P less than 0.05) and atropine (P less than 0.05) but unchanged after treatment with hexamethonium. Our findings indicate that tachykinins are released from the pelvic nerve to induce a nonadrenergic noncholinergic contraction and vasodilatation of the colon in the cat.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of hypothalamic microinfusions of cholecystokinin octapeptide and its antagonist L364,718 on cecocolonic myoelectrical activity were evaluated by electromyography in fasted and fed rats. The rats were chronically fitted with electrodes implanted on the cecum and proximal colon and cannulas placed bilaterally in either the ventromedial or lateral hypothalamus. In fasted rats, microinfusion of cholecystokinin octapeptide (10 ng/kg) into the ventromedial hypothalamus increased the spike-burst frequency of the cecum and the colon by 45.6% and 43.7%, respectively, during the 30-minute period after treatment. The injection of cholecystokinin octapeptide (10 ng/kg) into the lateral hypothalamus had no effect on either cecal or colonic motility. Feeding increased the frequency of cecal and colonic spike bursts by 52.1% and 50.1% for 30 minutes postprandially. When infused bilaterally into the ventromedial hypothalamus 10 minutes before feeding, L364,718 (1 or 5 micrograms/kg) abolished the increase of the frequency of cecal and colonic contractions induced by the meal. Infused into the lateral hypothalamus at similar dosages, L364,718 had no effect on the postprandial enhancement of cecocolonic motility. Increase of cecocolonic spike-burst frequency induced by feeding or by cholecystokinin octapeptide injected into the ventromedial hypothalamus was abolished by previous intracerebroventricular but not intraperitoneal administration of atropine (1 microgram) and 4-diphenylacetoxy-N-methylpiperidine (1 microgram), a selective muscarinic M2-receptor antagonist. In contrast, pirenzepine (1 microgram, intracerebroventricularly) did not significantly reduce the meal- or cholecystokin octapeptide-induced increase in cecal and colonic motility. These results suggest that, in rats, (a) cholecystokinin octapeptide is involved in the generation of the cecocolonic motor response to a meal and these effects are mediated through cholecystokinin octapeptide receptors located in the ventromedial hypothalamic nuclei, and (b) these postprandial colonic motor changes involve central cholinergic activation through muscarinic M2 receptors.\r"

At 3 months, the treatment group showed significantly greater improvement than the controls on both gastroenterologists' and patients' ratings of diarrhea and abdominal pain, but constipation changed little. Good prognostic factors included overt psychiatric symptoms and intermittent pain exacerbated by stress, whereas those with constant abdominal pain were helped little by this treatment. This study has demonstrated that psychological treatment is feasible and effective in two thirds of those patients with irritable bowel syndrome who do not respond to standard medical treatment.\r"

Epidemiological studies performed by the Center for Disease Control implicated the water of a local restaurant as the source of the outbreak. Five patients underwent a comprehensive evaluation. Their mean age was 51 years, and they had a mean of 12 watery stools daily (range, 6-40). Detailed microbiological evaluations failed to identify a pathological organism. Stool studies showed a mean stool weight of 392 g/24 h with a normal fat content. Results of all biochemical studies of serum were normal. Chemical analysis of stool water suggested a secretory diarrhea. Colonoscopy revealed patchy erythema, and light microscopic examination of colonic biopsy specimens revealed multifocal areas of acute inflammation in the superficial mucosa in 4 of 5 patients. Electron microscopy of the affected areas revealed no viral particles. After 2 years, all of our patients continued to experience chronic diarrhea. One patient agreed to a follow-up colonoscopy; histological abnormalities of the colonic mucosa persisted after 2 years. We speculate that an infectious process arising from a contaminated water system induced a chronic, secretory diarrhea characterized by multifocal colitis. This histological abnormality may serve as a marker of an infectious, chronic diarrhea.\r"

The threshold volume at which patients with multiple sclerosis and fecal incontinence experienced rectal sensation was higher than that in healthy controls (42.7 +/- 6.2 mL vs. 13.3 +/- 2.8 mL; P less than 0.01) and was similar to that in incontinent diabetics (36.5 +/- 5.7 mL). Patients with multiple sclerosis and incontinent diabetics also showed increased thresholds of phasic external sphincter contraction compared with controls (P less than 0.05). Diabetics with incontinence had reduced resting and maximal voluntary anal sphincter pressures compared with controls (P less than 0.05), whereas patients with multiple sclerosis and incontinence showed only decreased maximal voluntary anal sphincter pressures (P less than 0.01 vs. controls and diabetics). Incontinent patients with multiple sclerosis also required smaller volumes of rectal distention to inhibit internal sphincter tone compared with diabetics and controls (P less than 0.01). Decreased maximal voluntary squeeze pressures were less severe in continent patients with multiple sclerosis than in incontinent patients with multiple sclerosis. We conclude that impaired function of the external anal sphincter and decreased volumes of rectal distention to inhibit the internal anal sphincter or both may contribute to fecal incontinence in multiple sclerosis. In addition, increased thresholds of conscious rectal sensation in some incontinent patients with multiple sclerosis and diabetes mellitus may contribute to fecal incontinence by impairing the recognition of impending defecation.\r"

In an effort to define pathophysiological mechanisms responsible for the diarrheal component of the illness, we examined the effect of crude and fractionated toxin preparations on isolated rabbit ileal tissue in a Ussing chamber model. Both the crude toxin preparation (prepared from toxic Ctenochaetus strigosus) and 10% and 50% methanol-chloroform toxin fraction (prepared from a pool of toxic fish samples) gave a striking increase in transepithelial electrical potential difference and short-circuit current. Enterotoxic activity seemed to be mediated by calcium. When examined by light microscopy, the intestinal mucosa was not damaged by the toxin preparations used. Our data demonstrate that toxins involved in ciguatera fish poisoning directly stimulate intestinal fluid secretion without accompanying tissue damage and suggest that calcium is the \"second messenger\" mediating the process.\r"

The decrease in the rate of mortality observed in the group undergoing selective intestinal decontamination did not reach statistical significance. These data show that selective intestinal decontamination is useful to prevent spontaneous bacterial peritonitis and extraperitoneal infections in hospitalized cirrhotic patients with low ascitic fluid total protein levels.\r"

Of 41 rats that survived the initial carbon tetrachloride toxicity, 38 (92.7%) developed cirrhosis with ascites. Of these 38, 21 (55.3%) developed 24 episodes of ascitic fluid infection without iatrogenic colonization. No surgically treatable source of infection was identified at autopsy in any rat; therefore, the infections were presumed to be \"spontaneous.\" Eight (50%) of the 16 rats with culture-positive ascitic fluid at postmortem examination also had spontaneous pleural fluid infection with the same organism. Escherichia coli and Proteus sp. were the organisms most commonly isolated. This rodent model of cirrhosis with ascites appears to be the first high-yield animal model of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. Ascitic fluid infection in these rats resembles ascitic fluid infection in humans. This model will allow further investigation of the mechanisms of pathogenesis of ascitic fluid infection and provide insight into the prevention and treatment of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis and pleural fluid infection in patients with cirrhosis.\r"

The aim of the current study was to investigate whether vasopressin also contributes to the maintenance of arterial pressure in cirrhosis with ascites. The study was performed using three groups of cirrhotic rats with ascites and three groups of control animals. The administration of d(CH2)5Tyr(Me)AVP, a selective antagonist of the vascular effect of vasopressin, to 10 cirrhotic rats induced a significant reduction in mean arterial pressure (from 94 +/- 4 to 85 +/- 4 mm Hg; P less than 0.001) and a significant increase in plasma renin activity (from 24.3 +/- 4.9 to 34.3 +/- 5.9 ng/mL.h; P less than 0.02) and plasma norepinephrine concentration (from 1474 +/- 133 to 2433 +/- 253 pg/mL; P less than 0.01). Similar results were observed following saralasin administration in a second group of 5 cirrhotic rats [mean arterial pressure decreased from 97 +/- 4 to 85 +/- 5 mm Hg (P less than 0.0001); and plasma renin activity and norepinephrine concentration increased from 18.4 +/- 5.8 to 40.3 +/- 5.7 ng/mL.h (P less than 0.02) and from 1383 +/- 70 to 2312 +/- 334 pg/mL (P less than 0.05), respectively]. The simultaneous blockade of angiotensin II and vasopressin in a third group of cirrhotic rats resulted in a significantly greater reduction of mean arterial pressure (from 97 +/- 6 to 74 +/- 6 mm Hg; P less than 0.05). No changes in arterial pressure were observed in the three groups of control rats. These findings indicate that endogenous vasopressin is as important as angiotensin II in the maintenance of arterial pressure in cirrhotic rats with ascites and support the contention that arterial hypotension is the initial event leading to the stimulation of the renin-angiotensin system and vasopressin in this animal model of cirrhosis.\r"

The TmPO4/GFR, its major extrarenal determinants, ratios of urinary excretion gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase and of alpha-glucosidase to GFR (uGGT/GFR and uAGL/GFR), indices of structural damage of renal tubular cells, and fractional clearance of lysozyme, an index of proximal renal function, were evaluated in 31 alcoholics with alcohol-related liver disease, 24 alcoholics without alcohol-related liver disease, 14 patients with non-alcohol-related liver disease, and 25 control subjects. Hypophosphatemia was found in 35% of alcoholics with alcohol-related liver disease, 29% of alcoholics without alcohol-related liver disease, and no patients with non-alcohol-related liver disease. A reduced TmPO4/GFR was the major determinant of hypophosphatemia in both groups of alcoholics. No difference in extrarenal determinants of TmPO4/GFR was found between alcoholics with and without hypophosphatemia. Alcoholics with and without alcohol-related liver disease had increased uGGT/GFR and normal uAGL/GFR regardless of serum phosphate level. Fractional clearance of lysozyme, instead, was increased only in hypophosphatemic alcoholics with and without alcohol-related liver disease. The TmPO4/GFR correlated inversely with the fractional clearance of lysozyme in both groups of alcoholics (P less than 0.01). The TmPO4/GFR and urinary enzymes were normal in patients with non-alcohol-related liver disease. It was concluded that a reduced TmPO4/GFR is involved in the pathogenesis of hypophosphatemia in alcoholics. A proximal tubular dysfunction seems to be responsible for the reduced TmPO4/GFR. Liver function impairment is not required for the expression of this tubular dysfunction.\r"

Luminal bacteria or their cell wall polymers were implicated in the pathogenesis of the lesions because sham-operated rats and rats with self-emptying blind loops, having only slightly increased bacterial counts, did not develop hepatic injury. In this study, antibiotics with different spectra of activities were continuously administered starting 1 day or 22 days after surgery to determine which intestinal flora may be responsible for the development of hepatic injury in rats with small bowel bacterial overgrowth. Four weeks following surgery, Lewis rats with self-filling blind loops receiving no antibiotics had elevated liver histology scores (8.2 +/- 1.3 vs. 0.7 +/- 0.4) and plasma aspartate aminotransferase levels (269 +/- 171 vs. 84 +/- 24) compared with sham-operated rats, P less than 0.001. Oral gentamicin as well as oral and intraperitoneal polymyxin B, which binds endotoxin, did not prevent hepatic injury in rats with self-filling blind loops. However, oral metronidazole and tetracycline therapy continuously administered beginning 1 day after surgery diminished hepatic injury (histology score 3.0 +/- 1.8, 2.9 +/- 1.1; aspartate aminotransferase 87 +/- 25, 98 +/- 34; respectively P less than 0.001 compared with self-filling blind loops receiving no antibiotics). Metronidazole also protected Wistar rats that require 12 weeks to develop hepatic injury following experimentally induced small bowel bacterial overgrowth compared with rats with self-filling blind loops that received no antibiotic treatment (histology score 10.4 +/- 1.3 vs. 0.7 +/- 1.1, and aspartate aminotransferase 273 +/- 239 vs. 76 +/- 20, P less than 0.001). When rats started metronidazole therapy 22 days after self-filling blind loop surgery, elevated aspartate aminotransferase values decreased to normal during the next 77 days and final histology scores were normal. All rats with self-filling blind loops had negative peritoneal, liver, spleen, and blood cultures but approximately 75% of mesenteric lymph node cultures were positive irrespective of antibiotic treatment. Because Bacteroides species have been implicated in causing vitamin B12 and disaccharidase deficiencies in rats with self-filling blind loops, we documented the presence or absence of these organisms from blind loops using selective culture techniques. Metronidazole and tetracycline eliminated Bacteroides sp. from blind loops, but polymyxin B and gentamicin did not.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

Ten (2%) of these patients, 6 of whom were clinically asymptomatic, had primary pulmonary hypertension. Second, 26 patients with symptomatic pulmonary hypertension complicating portal hypertension were reviewed. Pulmonary hypertension occurred later after diagnosis of portal hypertension in patients with a surgical shunt (10 patients) than in those without a shunt (147 +/- 49 vs. 44 +/- 27 months; P less than 0.0001). Cardiac index correlated inversely with pulmonary arterial pressure (r = -0.45; P less than 0.01) and was lower in the 5 patients who died of pulmonary hypertension than in the 5 who died of liver failure (1.52 +/- 0.14 vs. 3.69 +/- 1.88 L/min.m2; P less than 0.05). Third, systemic and splanchnic hemodynamics were compared in 285 patients with alcoholic cirrhosis and 29 controls. No significant relation was found between elevated pulmonary vascular resistance and increased portal pressure, zzygos blood flow, or cardiac index. Pulmonary hypertension is considerably more frequent than was previously estimated in patients with portal hypertension. The risk of developing pulmonary hypertension could increase with the duration of portal hypertension without any clear relation to the degree of portal hypertension, hepatic failure, or amount of blood shunted.\r"

In this model, induced tumors resemble the human disease morphologically, clinically, biologically, and immunologically. In the current study, primary-induced cancer and transplants of pancreatic cancer cell line (PC-1) into the SC tissue or pancreas of homologous hosts were used. In the primary-induced pancreatic cancer, perineural invasion was the most common path (88%), followed by lymphogenic (31%) or vascular (2%) metastases. Inoculation of PC-1 cells into the pancreas resulted in 100% tumor take within 3 weeks. Of 19 intrapancreatic allografts, all showed peritoneal invasion, 5 (26%) liver metastases, 3 (16%) lymph node metastases, 17 (89%) perineural invasion, and none vascular invasion. Even microscopic tumors were found to metastasize primarily via perineural spaces. It was also demonstrated, for the first time, that cancer cells take this route to reach distant tissues, including the lymph nodes. Intraductal spreading occurred in both primary cancers and intrapancreatic allografts either continuously or discontinuously. The patterns of discontinuous intraductal tumor expansion imitated tumor multicentricity. Although perineural invasion was the most common feature of primary cancer and intrapancreatic allografts, lymphatic, hepatic, and vascular invasion and metastases usually occurred in advanced cases. Environmental factors seem to influence expansion and metastases, as evidenced by differences in growth and in metastatic patterns between SC and intrapancreatic allografts.\r"

  ".W": "Pancreatic enzyme secretion is regulated in humans by the cholinergic system and by cholecystokinin (CCK). The interaction between both regulatory systems in response to exogenous and endogenous stimulation was analyzed in the present study using the cholinergic antagonist atropine and the CCK antagonist loxiglumide. A dose-dependent stimulation of pancreatic enzyme output was achieved either by duodenal perfusion of graded caloric loads or by IV infusion of increasing doses of cerulein. Prestimulated pancreatic secretion was inhibited by atropine and loxiglumide. Atropine furthermore almost completely blocked meal-stimulated pancreatic secretion, whereas loxiglumide caused 60% inhibition. The enzyme response to graded doses of exogenous CCK was significantly inhibited by atropine and loxiglumide. Plasma levels of CCK were not altered by atropine but increased with infusion of loxiglumide. This study supports the concept that pancreatic enzyme secretion is predominantly dependent on a cholinergic tone and that CCK modulates the enzyme-secretory response.\r"

These episodes occurred in two successive pregnancies, and liver biopsy confirmed the diagnosis in the second pregnancy. Both pregnancies were managed by prompt fetal delivery; on both occasions this led to a complete biochemical resolution of the liver function abnormalities. Two healthy babies were delivered by ceasarian sections. This case is of particular importance because a rapidly progressive and devastating illness developed in both infants, leading to death at 6 1/2 and 6 months, respectively. The illness in both babies was characterized by wide-spread fatty infiltration of several vital organs and a failure of any treatment to influence the outcome of that illness. Studies suggested that the illness in the children was caused by a still ill-defined disorder of fatty acid oxidation. The biochemical disorder evidenced in this family is discussed, in an attempt to shed light on the etiology of acute fatty liver of pregnancy.\r"

In the current report, chronic inflammatory bowel disease that developed in another adolescent with this glycogenosis is described, thereby corroborating the association. The neutrophil dysfunction observed in glycogen storage disease Ib is the most likely predisposing factor. Neutrophil function was investigated in our patient in an attempt to shed light on the pathogenesis of his intestinal inflammation. The patient displayed reduced neutrophil chemotaxis to zymosan-activated serum, N-formyl-methionine-phenylalanine, and Escherichia coli bacteria-derived factor and reduced intracellular killing of Staphylococcus aureus 502A. Others have found this defective bacteriocidal activity to be caused by impaired oxidative metabolism. The recent recognition of chronic inflammatory bowel disease in glycogen storage disease Ib, as well as in chronic granulomatous disease, suggests that further study of respiratory burst activity of neutrophils in Crohn's disease is warranted.\r"

We encountered a 73-year-old man with myelodysplastic syndrome who presented with fever, diarrhea, and abdominal pain. Colonoscopic evaluation (focal ulceration, friability, and nodularity) was compatible with Crohn's disease, although histology showed a dense myeloid cell infiltrate characteristic of granulocytic sarcoma. In patients with myelodysplastic syndrome or acute or chronic myelogenous leukemia presenting with diarrhea, abdominal pain, and/or fever, colonoscopy and biopsy are indicated to determine if the colon is affected by granulocytic sarcoma.\r"

These calcitonin gene-related peptide-immunoreactive cells were sparsely seen in normal mucosa but increased markedly in esophagitis. They were inaccessible to routine histological stains, but osmication showed them as dendritic forms resembling Langerhans cells of the skin. Their cytological identity was determined with immunocytochemical tests for human antigenic markers such as Ia, HLA-DR, and OKT6 for Langerhans cells, Leu-M5 and Leu-M3 for intraepithelial macrophages, CD3 and TCR-1 for T-lymphocytes, Leu-14 for B-lymphocytes, S-100 for Merkel cells, and chromogranin for amine precursor uptake and decarboxylation cells. Double localization showed that calcitonin gene-related peptide immunoreactivity colocalized with Ia, HLA-DR, and OKT6 but not with the other markers. These studies show that intraepithelial Langerhans cells in the esophageal mucosa contain calcitonin gene-related peptide, which may serve as an immunomodulator.\r"

Because they are vasodilators with a mild diuretic action, they are logical treatment choices for the majority of hypertensive patients who have increased peripheral vascular resistance. They offer the advantage of a dual benefit for hypertensive patients with angina, and they have no effect on carbohydrate or lipid metabolism.

  ".W": "Consumption of monosodium glutamate has long been considered to precipitate headaches in susceptible patients. In this study the direct effects of glutamate and its metabolite, glutamine, on arterial contractility were examined using rings of rabbit aorta. In a high concentration glutamate caused significant concentration-dependent contractions (EC50, 10(-1)M; maximum tension, 188.4 +/- 33.3 mg wt tension/mg tissue). Agonists and antagonists for alpha-adrenergic, histaminergic, serotonergic, cholinergic, and GABA-nergic receptors as well as inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis failed to influence glutamate contractions. At high concentrations (10(-5)M) the calcium channel blocker, verapamil, inhibited the glutamate response. Glutamate and glutamine both exhibited concentration dependent relaxation of norepinephrine (NE), phenylephrine (PE), histamine, serotonin (5-HT), and prostaglandin F2 alpha (PGF2 alpha)-induced contractions. Kainic acid (10(-4)M), an agonist of one subpopulation of central glutamate receptor, potentiated glutamate-induced vasoconstriction; a higher concentration (10(-3)M) produced an irreversible inhibition of glutamate contractility. Only the central glutamate receptor antagonist, ketamine (10(-4)-10(-2)M), induced a reversible, concentration dependent inhibition of glutamate-induced contractions. Glutamate contractility was not dependent on extracellular calcium, an intact endothelium or neuronal function. These results demonstrate a direct effect of glutamate on peripheral arterial tone. Dietary consumption of large quantities of MSG may represent a serious health hazard to certain individuals with pre-existing vascular disease.\r"

The results show that, under stress, the absorbance of 5-HT into the platelets in patients with TH is reduced. It is suggested that, in patients with TH, there are abnormalities of 5-HT uptake into platelets and factors which cause release of 5-HT from platelets.\r"

Clinical researchers have evaluated several behavioral treatment, such as biofeedback and relaxation training, that may be viable interventions. Adding a developmental perspective to the evaluation and treatment of childhood headache is a likely way to increase the effectiveness of these strategies. This paper presents developmental issues related to the assessment and treatment of childhood headache. Three major areas of development are examined and the impact of these areas on the treatment and assessment of headache are discussed. The three major areas are cognitive development, self-regulation and psychosocial development. Provided are practical suggestions for the application of child development principles to assessment and intervention practices that may be more developmentally appropriate.\r"

We recorded nocturnal sleep with a 4-channel cassette EEG monitoring device in 10 common migraine patients, 10 individuals with muscle contraction (tension) headache, and 10 chronic tension-vascular headache sufferers. Migraine patients had essentially normal sleep, although rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and REM latency were increased. Patients with tension headache had reduced sleep time and sleep efficiency, decreased sleep latency but frequent awakenings, increased nocturnal movements, and marked reduction in slow wave sleep, without change in REM sleep or latency. Mixed-element headaches with both tension and vascular features were associated with reduced sleep, increased awakening, diminished slow wave sleep, and REM sleep that was decreased in amount and reduced in latency. The findings suggest that patients with intermittent migraine may have minimal sleep disturbance, while chronic headache may be worsened by chronically poor sleep. Muscle contraction headache may be associated with frequent awakenings and decreased slow wave sleep similar to the sleep changes of fibrositis, while chronic tension-vascular headache may have a depressive substrate. Four-channel sleep recording may miss contributory sleep apnea, but nonetheless cassette EEG may facilitate outpatient evaluation of refractory headaches.\r"

CNV1 was recorded at the vertex while CNV3 was recorded at multiple electrode sites to assess topographical differences. Seven out of twelve migraine patients without aura had increased CNV1 amplitudes. CNV3 amplitudes were increased as well, but only at electrode positions C3 and C4 and not at Fz. CNV3, which allows for analysis of both an early and a late CNV component, could improve the discrimination of migraine without aura beyond that of CNV1. In migraine with aura all CNV parameters were at control levels, confirming previous results. The data obtained are discussed in terms of arousal, activation and stress and the \"biobehavioral model of migraine\" (Welch, 1986).\r"

The alphastat hypothesis states that proteins that contain appropriate function-determining titratable groups maintain a constant charge state and unaltered function with temperature-dependent pH changes but can be very sensitive to isothermal pH changes. Appropriate groups, e.g., imidazole histidine, are determined by the pK and the effect of temperature on the pK. The hypothesis explains how protein structure and function can be conserved among a diversity of vertebrate and invertebrate pH values. It also suggests a mechanism for sensing or regulating temperature-independent pH changes, e.g., in central chemosensitivity and transmembrane ion exchange. Possible candidates for such alphastat-conforming proteins include two, the glutamate receptor and the Na(+)-H+ antiporter, for which recent evidence indicates the presence of numerous histidines at probable function-determining sites and demonstrates pH sensitivity inhibitable by the histidine blocker diethylpyrocarbonate (DEPC).\r"

The remaining external intercostals were typically silent, regardless of the level of respiratory drive.

There was a clear correlation between recruitment patterns of the intercostals and the histochemically defined fiber type properties of the muscles. Intercostal muscles that were routinely recruited during inspiration had a significantly higher proportion of slow-oxidative muscle fibers.\r"

Pulmonary responses were measured in untreated dogs and in dogs pretreated with albuterol (1 and 2.5 micrograms/kg) or aminophylline. Before aerosol challenge, baseline pulmonary resistance (RL) and dynamic compliance (Cdyn) were not significantly different between the BGs and the mongrels. In the untreated dogs, pulmonary responses to methacholine and histamine aerosols were not different between the BGs and the mongrels. Pretreatment with albuterol (1 microgram/kg) or aminophylline significantly attenuated the pulmonary response to methacholine in the mongrels but was without effect in the BGs. Albuterol (2.5 micrograms/kg) significantly attenuated the pulmonary response to methacholine in the BGs and the mongrels; however, this attenuation was significantly greater (P less than 0.05) in the mongrels than in the BGs. In response to histamine challenge, no differences were seen between the BGs and the mongrels in the control state (no pretreatment) or after pretreatment with albuterol or aminophylline. This study demonstrates that in BGs pulmonary responsiveness to methacholine but not histamine is resistant to inhibition by beta-adrenergic agonists. This may result from a qualitative or quantitative defect in either the cholinergic or beta-adrenergic receptor or to an abnormality distal to the receptors in the signal transduction mechanism at a site where the two signals interact.\r"

In this study, we determined the importance of bronchial blood flow (QBA) in the recovery from methacholine-(MCh) induced bronchoconstriction. In 10 pentobarbital-anesthetized ventilated sheep, the bronchial branch of the bronchoesophageal artery was cannulated and perfused (0.7 ml.min-1.kg-1) with blood pumped from the femoral artery. MCh was infused directly into the bronchial artery at increasing concentrations (10(-7) to 10(-5) M). MCh infusion caused a concentration-dependent increase in airway resistance at constant QBA. However, the time constant of recovery (TC) from airway constriction after cessation of the MCh infusion was not dependent on the MCh concentration or the magnitude of the increases in airway resistance. When QBA was at 50, 100, and 200% of control level, with constant MCh concentration, TC was 44 +/- 6, 25 +/- 2, and 24 +/- 2 (SE) s at each flow level, respectively. TC at 50% of control QBA was significantly greater than at control QBA (P less than 0.01). Thus the magnitude of QBA can alter the time course of recovery from MCh-induced increases in airway resistance. These results document the importance of QBA in reversing agonist-induced constriction and suggest that an impaired bronchial circulation may contribute to the mechanism of airway hyperreactivity.\r"

Peak heart rate was 170 and 162 beats/min, corresponding to approximately 90% of estimated maximal heart rate. Muscle samples were taken at rest and immediately after exercise from the quadriceps femoris. Lactate content remained low in both muscle and blood. Acetylcarnitine, which constitutes a readily available form of acetyl units and thus a substrate for the tricarboxylic acid cycle, was very low in McA patients both at rest and during exercise, corresponding to approximately 17 and 11%, respectively, of that in healthy subjects. Muscle NADH was unchanged during exercise in McA patients in contrast to healthy subjects, in whom NADH increases markedly at high exercise intensities. Despite low lactate levels, arterial plasma NH3 and muscle inosine 5'-monophosphate increased more steeply relative to work load in McA patients than in healthy subjects. The low postexercise levels of lactate, acetylcarnitine, and NADH in McA patients support the idea that exercise performance is limited by the availability of oxidative fuels. Increases in muscle inosine 5'-monophosphate and plasma NH3 indicate that lack of glycogen as an oxidative fuel is associated with adenine nucleotide breakdown and increased deamination of AMP. It is suggested that the early onset of fatigue in McA patients is caused by an insufficient rate of ADP phosphorylation, resulting in transient increases in ADP.\r"

Six subjects received an intravenous fructose infusion (8.5 mmol/min) from 40 min of exercise to the end of recovery. Splanchnic glucose output, muscle glucose uptake, arterial glucose, and insulin were uninfluenced by the infusion. The respiratory exchange ratio rose to 0.93 +/- 0.04, and arterial free fatty acids fell by 50% (P less than 0.05). Fructose was taken up by splanchnic tissues (45% of administered load), leg muscle (28%), and resting muscle (28%). During infusion, arterial lactate and pyruvate rose two- to threefold, and these substrates were released from splanchnic tissues and taken up by exercising and resting muscle. Splanchnic release of lactate, pyruvate, and glucose accounted for 78% of fructose uptake at 90 min of exercise. Uptake of fructose, lactate, and pyruvate accounted for 55% and together with glucose for 103% of the total oxidative metabolism by exercising muscle. The regional fructose uptakes and lactate exchanges persisted throughout recovery. The present results indicate that fructose infusion during leg exercise 1) results in increased carbohydrate oxidation from fructose, lactate, and pyruvate in exercising muscle, 2) exerts a glycogenic effect in resting muscle and liver during exercise and in liver and muscle recovering from exercise, and 3) does not interfere with glucose metabolism, and that fructose transport into muscle differs from that of glucose.\r"

To test this hypothesis, we studied seven normal men throughout a single night of sleep. We recorded inspiratory supraglottic airway resistance, geniohyoid muscle electromyographic (EMGgh) activity, sleep staging, and ventilatory parameters in these subjects during supine nasal breathing. Mean inspiratory upper airway resistance was significantly (P less than 0.01) increased in these subjects during all stages of sleep compared with wakefulness, reaching highest levels during non-rapid-eye-movement (NREM) sleep [awake 2.5 +/- 0.6 (SE) cmH2O.l-1.s, stage 2 NREM sleep 24.1 +/- 11.1, stage 3/4 NREM sleep 30.2 +/- 12.3, rapid-eye-movement (REM) sleep 13.0 +/- 6.7]. Breath-by-breath linear correlation analyses of upper airway resistance and time-averaged EMGgh amplitude demonstrated a significant (P less than 0.05) negative correlation (r = -0.44 to -0.55) between these parameters in five of seven subjects when data from all states (wakefulness and sleep) were combined. However, we found no clear relationship between normalized upper airway resistance and EMGgh activity during individual states (wakefulness, stage 2 NREM sleep, stage 3/4 NREM sleep, and REM sleep) when data from all subjects were combined. The timing of EMGgh onset relative to the onset of inspiratory airflow did not change significantly during wakefulness, NREM sleep, and REM sleep. Inspiratory augmentation of geniohyoid activity generally preceded the start of inspiratory airflow. The time from onset of inspiratory airflow to peak inspiratory EMGgh activity was significantly increased during sleep compared with wakefulness (awake 0.81 +/- 0.04 s, NREM sleep 1.01 +/- 0.04, REM sleep 1.04 +/- 0.05; P less than 0.05). These data indicate that sleep-related changes in geniohyoid muscle activity may influence upper airway resistance in some subjects. However, the relationship between geniohyoid muscle activity and upper airway resistance was complex and varied among subjects, suggesting that other factors must also be considered to explain sleep influences on upper airway patency.\r"

Anatomic landmarks for placement of intramuscular geniohyoid recording electrodes were determined from a cadaver study. These landmarks were used in percutaneous placement of wire electrodes, and raw and moving-time-averaged EMGgh activities were recorded. Sleep stage was determined using standard criteria. Stable periods of wakefulness and non-rapid-eye-movement (NREM) and rapid-eye-movement (REM) sleep were selected for analysis. The EMGgh exhibited phasic inspiratory activity during wakefulness and sleep in all subjects. In six of seven subjects, mean and peak inspiratory EMGgh activities were significant (P less than 0.05) reduced during stages 2 and 3/4 NREM sleep and REM sleep compared with wakefulness. This reduction of EMGgh activity was shown to result from a sleep-related decline in the level of tonic muscle activity. Phasic inspiratory EMGgh activity during all stages of sleep was not significantly different from that during wakefulness. Of interest, tonic, phasic, and peak EMGgh activities were not significantly reduced during REM sleep compared with any other sleep stage in any subject. In addition, the slope of onset of phasic EMGgh activity was not different during stage 2 NREM and REM sleep compared with wakefulness in these subjects.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Each of these conditions was followed by an experimental protocol in which the five male subjects made a series of alternating 25-s static contractions of each leg at 50% maximal voluntary contraction until one leg failed to achieve the required force (Tlim). Glycogen concentration before the experimental protocol in both legs was significantly lower in the depletion than in the repletion condition. Muscle lactate and creatine phosphate concentrations were within normal limits before the static contractions. The number of contractions the repleted (12.7 +/- 2.2) and depleted (10.3 +/- 1.5) legs could sustain before Tlim were not different from each other, but both were 35% (P less than 0.05) fewer than the control (17.6 +/- 3.0). Surface electromyogram (EMG) amplitude was higher in depleted than in repleted or control muscles. At Tlim, EMG amplitude was maximal, creatine phosphate was 50-70% depleted, and lactate increased fourfold. Average glycogen utilization per contraction in both the repletion and depletion conditions was 5.8 mmol/kg dry wt, but postexercise lactate concentrations were lower in depleted (14.4 +/- 3.6 mmol/kg dry wt) than in repleted (43.2 +/- 7.4) muscles.

We measured 6 keto-PGF1 alpha as an index of PGI2 production during serotonin (5-HT) infusion, elevated venous pressure (Pv), or increased blood flow (Q) in the isolated canine lower left lung lobe (LLL). Lobar vascular resistance (LVR) was partitioned into arterial (Ra), middle (Rm), and venous (Rv) components by arterial and venous occlusions. The infusion of 55-210 micrograms/min 5-HT (n = 9) was associated with concomitant increases in PGI2 production and dose-related increases in pulmonary arterial pressure (Pa) and LVR. 5-HT increased Ra at each infusion rate, whereas Rm was not changed and Rv was increased only at the highest infusion rate. When Pa was increased by stepwise elevations in Pv from 3.7 to 19.1 cmH2O (n = 8) or by increases in Q from 250 to 507 ml/min (n = 5) to match the Pa increase observed during 5-HT infusion, PGI2 production was not altered. Increases in Pv reduced LVR largely by decreasing Ra, whereas increases in Q reduced LVR without changing Ra, Rm, or Rv. Infusion of 5-HT when Pa was held constant by reduction in blood flow (n = 6) did not increase PGI2. Thus infusion of 5-HT at a normal blood flow rate increased PGI2 formation in the isolated blood-perfused dog lung lobe. The results also suggest that sustained mechanical effects related to increased venous pressure or elevated blood flow are not associated with a sustained elevation of PGI2 formation.\r"

  ".W": "Breathing during hypercapnia is determined by reflex mechanisms but may also be influenced by respiratory sensations. The present study examined the effects of voluntary changes in level and pattern of breathing on the sensation of dyspnea at a constant level of chemical drive. Studies were carried out in 15 normal male subjects during steady-state hypercapnia at an end-tidal PCO2 of 50 Torr. The intensity of dyspnea was rated on a Borg category scale. In one experiment (n = 8), the level of ventilation was increased or decreased from the spontaneously adopted level (Vspont). In another experiment (n = 9), the minute ventilation was maintained at the level spontaneously adopted at PCO2 of 50 Torr and breathing frequency was increased or decreased from the spontaneously adopted level (fspont) with reciprocal changes in tidal volume. The intensity of dyspnea (expressed as percentage of the spontaneous breathing level) correlated with ventilation (% Vspont) negatively at levels below Vspont (r = -0.70, P less than 0.001) and positively above Vspont (r = 0.80, P less than 0.001). At a constant level of ventilation, the intensity of dyspnea correlated with breathing frequency (% fspont) negatively at levels below fspont (r = -0.69, P less than 0.001) and positively at levels above fspont (r = 0.75, P less than 0.001). These results indicate that dyspnea intensifies when the level or pattern of breathing is voluntarily changed from the spontaneously adopted level. This is consistent with the possibility that ventilatory responses to changes in chemical drive may be regulated in part to minimize the sensations of respiratory effort and discomfort.\r"

We studied the clearance routes and kinetics of an inert insoluble carbonized polystyrene particle of supramicron size (2.85 micron count median diameter) tagged with 57Co (half-life 270 days) in the adult unanesthetized sheep. The rate of particle clearance, assessed by gamma scintillation camera of the whole lung, showed a three-exponential function, comprising a rapid initial phase in the first 44 h of clearance for tracheobronchial deposition followed by a slower phase of mostly alveolar clearance in the next 30 days and a final phase of very slow relatively pure alveolar clearance. A balance study of particle route during clearance and autopsy of regional thoracic lymph nodes, blood, liver, and spleen demonstrated that this supramicron-sized particle cleared from alveoli predominantly via the mucociliary escalator of the tracheobronchial tree. Whole-lung lavage studies showed particle and macrophage recovery rates suggesting a sequestered state for alveolar-deposited particles, which may partly account for their slow clearance rates. The failure to find interstitial penetration by alveolar-deposited particles indicates that the macrophages engulfing these particles, at low particle burdens, travel normally in only one direction, i.e., from interstitium to alveolus and then to the mucociliary escalator.\r"

Female Sprague-Dawley rats (n = 20, 8 wk of age, 150-170 g) were exercised progressively 5 days/wk for approximately 1 h/day for 10 wk at 75-80% of maximum oxygen capacity on a motor-driven treadmill. Caged age-matched rats served as controls (n = 20). Rat FNs were tested in cantilever bending, and vertebral bodies were compressed to 50% of their initial height at a fast strain rate. In response to the strenuous exercise, the relative area of the FN trabecular core increased significantly at the expense of the cortical shell. With that structural change, the exercised FN had significantly less energy to proportional limit than controls. The FN material properties (normal stresses at proportional limit and maximum) were significantly diminished after 10 wk of strenuous exercise. At the same time, no differences were found in vertebral geometry or structural and material properties. In the immature rate, the differential responses of the FN vs. L6 may relate to load history rather than a general systemic response to the strenuous exercise.\r"

  ".W": "Increasing minute ventilation of dry gas shifts the principal burden of respiratory heat and water losses from more proximal airway to airways farther into the lung. If these local thermal transfers determine the local stimulus for bronchoconstriction, then increasing minute ventilation of dry gas might also extend the zone of airway narrowing farther into the lung during hyperpnea-induced bronchoconstriction (HIB). We tested this hypothesis by comparing tantalum bronchograms in tracheostomized guinea pigs before and during bronchoconstriction induced by dry gas hyperpnea, intravenous methacholine, and intravenous capsaicin. In eight animals subjected to 5 min of dry gas isocapnic hyperpnea [tidal volume (VT) = 2-5 ml, 150 breaths/min], there was little change in the diameter of the trachea or the main stem bronchi up to 0.75 cm past the main carina (zone 1). In contrast, bronchi from 0.75 to 1.50 cm past the main carina (zone 2) narrowed progressively at all minute ventilations greater than or equal to 300 ml/min (VT = 2 ml). More distal bronchi (1.50-3.10 cm past the main carina; zone 3) did not narrow significantly until minute ventilation was raised to 450 ml/min (VT = 3 ml). The estimated VT during hyperpnea needed to elicit a 50% reduction in airway diameter was significantly higher in zone 3 bronchi [4.3 +/- 0.8 (SD) ml] than in zone 2 bronchi (3.5 +/- 1.1 ml, P less than 0.012).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Almitrine bimesylate is a potent and long-lasting respiratory stimulant in adult species. It acts by stimulating the peripheral chemoreceptors, where it has been shown to accumulate specifically, although its exact mechanism of action is uncertain. In the fetal lamb, however, it produces a profound inhibition of breathing even after denervation of the peripheral chemoreceptors. In this respect its action is similar to hypoxia. To investigate whether almitrine is hypoxia mimetic, we examined the effect of almitrine in nine fetal lambs of 120-130 days gestation. Five had lesions in the lateral pons that changed the fetal depressive response to hypoxia to one of stimulation. In the remaining four fetuses, the lesions did not bilaterally encompass the appropriate area of the pons; thus they still showed the normal fetal depressive response to hypoxia and so acted as controls. Almitrine (10 mg iv) caused a pronounced stimulation of breathing that lasted 406 +/- 26 min in all five fetuses with lesions that caused a stimulatory response to hypoxia. However, in the remaining four fetuses, in which the response to hypoxia was inhibitory, almitrine caused an inhibition of breathing that lasted 184 +/- 28 min. We conclude that the action of almitrine is like that of hypoxia and that, because it acts specifically on the chemoreceptors, it may prove to be a useful tool in the study of possible central chemoreceptor mechanisms.\r"

  ".W": "We isolated the guinea pig right bronchus with the vagus nerves intact and evaluated the changes in isometric tension of the smooth muscle in response to nerve stimulation. Brief (10-s) trains of electrical field stimulation or vagus nerve stimulation caused a biphasic contraction: the \"first phase\" sensitive to atropine and the \"second phase\" sensitive to capsaicin. The two phases could be dissociated by adjusting the stimulus intensity; greater stimulus intensities (pulse durations or voltage) were required to evoke the capsaicin-sensitive phase. When stimulated at 30-min intervals, the magnitude of both phases of the contractions declined over a 2-h period of repeated stimulation; however, this was prevented by indomethacin. Stimulation of the left vagus nerve resulted in a monophasic contraction of the right bronchus, with little evidence of a capsaicin-sensitive phase. Blocking neurotransmission through the bronchial ganglion, as monitored by intracellular recording techniques, abolished the first-phase contraction but had no effect on the capsaicin-sensitive phase. Selective blockade of muscarinic M1 receptors had no effect on vagus nerve-mediated contractions. The results demonstrate that the left and right vagus nerves carry preganglionic fibers to the right bronchial ganglion. The right but not the left vagus nerve also carries capsaicin-sensitive afferent fibers that, when stimulated, result in a persistent contraction of the right bronchus. Finally, we provide functional and electrophysiological evidence supporting the hypothesis that capsaicin-sensitive afferent neurons communicate with postganglionic motoneurons within the bronchus.\r"

To determine whether amino acid uptake by muscle of obese Zucker rats is impaired, soleus strip (SOL) and epitrochlearis (EPI) muscles from 10-wk-old lean and obese Zucker rats were studied in vitro by use of [14C]alpha-aminoisobutyric acid (AIB). Muscles from fasted rats were incubated under basal conditions at rest or after a 1-h treadmill run at 8% grade. To equate total work completed, lean and obese rats ran at 27 and 20 m/min, respectively. Muscles were pinned at resting length, preincubated for 30 min at 37 degrees C in Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate buffer containing 5 mM glucose under 95% O2-5% CO2, and then incubated up to 3 h in Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate with 0.5 mM AIB, [14C]AIB, and [3H]inulin as a marker of extracellular fluid. Basal AIB uptake in EPI and SOL from obese rats was significantly reduced by 40 and 30% (P less than 0.01), respectively, compared with lean rats. For both lean and obese rats, exercise increased (P less than 0.05) basal AIB uptake in EPI and SOL, but the relative increases were greater in the obese rats (EPI 54% and SOL 71% vs. EPI 32% and SOL 37%). These results demonstrate that genetically obese Zucker rats have reduced basal skeletal muscle amino acid uptake and suggest that physical inactivity may partially contribute to this defect.\r"

Bilateral stenosis of the femoral artery of adult rats (300-350 g) was performed to reduce exercise hyperemia in the hindlimb but not limit resting muscle BF. Rats were divided into normal sedentary, acute stenosed (stenosed 3 days before the experiment), stenosed sedentary (limited to cage activity), and stenosed trained (run on a treadmill by a progressively intense program, up to 50-60 min/day, 5 days/wk for 6-8 wk). Hindlimb BF was determined with 85Sr- and 141Ce-labeled microspheres at a low (20 m/min) and high treadmill speed (30-40 m/min depending on ability). Maximal hindlimb BF was reduced to approximately 50% normal in the acute stenosed group. Total hindlimb BF (81 +/- 5 ml.min-1.100 g-1) did not change in stenosed sedentary animals with 6-8 wk of cage activity, but a redistribution of BF occurred within the hindlimb. Two factors contributed to a higher BF to the distal limb muscle of the trained animals. A redistribution BF within the hindlimb occurred in stenosed trained animals; distal limb BF increased to approximately 80% (P less than 0.001) of the proximal tissue. In addition, an increase in total hindlimb BF with training indicates that collateral BF has been enhanced (P less than 0.025). The associated increase in oxygen delivery to the relatively ischemic muscle probably contributed to the markedly improved exercise tolerance evident in the trained animals.\r"

Two weeks after sensitization, eight rats were challenged by inhalation of aerosolized OA through the nose. The airway responses of these rats 5-10 h after OA challenge were compared with those of seven animals challenged with saline. Seven of eight test rats had increased Ruaw, and six displayed discrete late responses (LR). Ruaw during expiration was highly alinear so analysis was confined to Ruaw during inspiration (Ruaw,I). The Ruaw,I averaged over 5 h was 1.262 +/- 0.09 (SE) cmH2O.ml-1.s, 2.6 times the value for saline-challenged animals (0.476 +/- 0.143 cmH2O.ml-1.s), and it reached a peak value of 3.454 +/- 0.45 cmH2O.ml-1.s. The time to the peak of the LR was 446 +/- 37.3 min. The duration of the LR in the upper airway was 146 +/- 34.9 min. At the time corresponding to the peak value of Ruaw,I, the lung elastance in the test rats was double the value preceding the peak. Lung elastance was unchanged in the control group. We conclude that inhalation of antigen through the upper airway of the sensitized rat results in a substantial increase in upper airway resistance and a distinct LR. The predominant site of the change in respiratory system resistance is in the upper airway.\r"

Electrophysiological recordings were also performed. Time to peak isometric tension in muscles from exercised aged rats (EAR) was shorter than in those from unexercised aged rats (UAR) (126 +/- 7 vs. 167 +/- 7 ms; P less than 0.01). Time to 50% relaxation from peak isometric tension was also shorter in EAR than in UAR (88 +/- 3 vs. 119 +/- 12 ms; P less than 0.05). There was a trend toward decrease in time to peak light and a significant decrease in time to 50% decline from peak light (33 +/- 4 ms in EAR vs. 59 +/- 17 ms in UAR; P = 0.001). Action potential amplitude was smaller in EAR than in UAR (67 +/- 4 vs. 82 +/- 3 mV; P = 0.003); however, action potential duration was longer (137 +/- 6 ms in EAR vs. 100 +/- 10 ms in UAR; P = 0.005). Right ventricular-to-body weight ratios revealed no evidence of hypertrophy in EAR compared with UAR. Cardiac tissue norepinephrine content was significantly greater in EAR than in UAR (1,212 +/- 25 vs. 630 +/- 105 ng/tissue; P = 0.02). In summary, exercise reversed the age-related prolongation of isometric contraction and associated intracellular calcium transient in the aged rat while it prolonged the transmembrane action potential. In addition, exercise in aged rats resulted in an increase in cardiac norepinephrine content.\r"

Effective respiratory resistance (Rrs; in cmH2O.l-1.s) fell sharply from 6.2 +/- 2.1 (SD) at 0.25 Hz to 2.3 +/- 0.6 at 2 Hz. From then on, Rrs decreased slightly with frequency down to 1.5 +/- 0.5 at 32 Hz. Respiratory reactance (Xrs; in cmH2O.l-1.s) was -22.2 +/- 5.9 at 0.25 Hz and reached zero at approximately 14 Hz and 2.3 +/- 0.8 at 32 Hz. Effective respiratory elastance (Ers = -2pi x frequency x Xrs; in cmH2O/1) was 34.8 +/- 9.2 at 0.25 Hz and increased markedly with frequency up to 44.2 +/- 8.6 at 2 Hz. We interpreted Zrs data in terms of a T network mechanical model. We represented the proximal branch by central airway resistance and inertance. The shunt pathway accounted for bronchial distensibility and alveolar gas compressibility. The distal branch included a Newtonian resistance component for tissues and peripheral airways and a viscoelastic component for tissues. When the viscoelastic component was represented by a Kelvin body as in the model of Bates et al. (J. Appl. Physiol. 61: 873-880, 1986), a good fit was obtained over the entire frequency range, and reasonable values of parameters were estimated. The strong frequency dependence of Rrs and Ers observed below 2 Hz in our anesthetized paralyzed patients could be mainly interpreted in terms of tissue viscoelasticity. Nevertheless, the high Ers we found with low volume excursions suggests that tissues also exhibit plasticlike properties.\r"

Controls were normoxic littermates (Nx) in which inspired O2 fraction was lowered from approximately 0.21 to 0.10 for 3 h. Arterial PCO2 decreased progressively and similarly in both groups (65-70% of control at 15 min). Initially, arterial pH increased less in 3WHx (0.09 +/- 0.004 vs. 0.15 +/- 0.008). As hypocapnia continued, delta[HCO3-]/delta pH (mmol.l-1.pH) became more negative in Nx, from -15.2 +/- 2.5 at 15 min to -37.0 +/- 2.9 at 3 h, indicating nonrespiratory compensation of alkalosis. In 3WHx, delta[HCO3-]/delta pH did not change during alkalosis. Cumulative renal excretion of base (mueq/100 g) during alkalosis increased by 73.2 +/- 11.1 in Nx and 25.4 +/- 7.3 in 3WHx. This difference was mainly due to a larger increase in HCO3- excretion in Nx. The data suggest that the smaller compensation of hypocapnic alkalosis in 3WHx is partly due to the smaller increase in renal base excretion. Because base availability limits renal base excretion, the smaller renal response of 3WHx may be secondary to the low plasma HCO3- concentration that accompanies altitude acclimation.\r"

The soleus muscle atrophied 32% during 7 days of non-weight bearing without countermeasures. Centrifugation treatment did not completely prevent atrophy relative to precontrol wet weight of the soleus muscle. Non-weight-bearing groups receiving 2-h daily treatments of 1, 1.5, or 2.6 G had 48, 56, and 65%, respectively, of the atrophy observed in the non-weight-bearing-only group compared with the precontrol group.

  ".W": "We examined the effects of theophylline on contractile properties and high-frequency fatigue of canine diaphragm in vitro. Eighteen diaphragm muscle bundles were obtained from 10 anesthetized dogs and equilibrated in oxygenated Krebs solution to 100, 200, or 300 mg/l theophylline. These bundles were compared with 18 matched control bundles from the contralateral hemidiaphragm. No statistically significant differences in twitch tension, tetanic tension, twitch-to-tetanus ratio, time to peak tension, or half-relaxation time were observed. Concentrations of 300 mg/l theophylline, however, significantly (P less than 0.05) increased force production at 10 Hz by 32%. A similar tendency was present at lower concentrations and exhibited a clear dose-response behavior. High-frequency fatigue was similar in control and theophylline-treated bundles. We conclude that supratherapeutic in vitro concentrations of theophylline do not increase maximal tetanic tension and do not protect against muscle fatigue but potentiate relative force production at low stimulation frequencies. This relatively small effect cannot be explained by poor diffusion of the drug in the muscle bundle, because theophylline concentrations in the muscle bath and in the muscle bundle were virtually identical. Moreover, it remains unclear whether this potentially beneficial effect can be achieved at in vivo attainable serum concentrations.\r"

  ".W": "Acetazolamide (ACZ), a potent carbonic anhydrase inhibitor, is a known diuretic and causal agent in metabolic acidosis. Its diuretic qualities are well established with respect to urine flow and electrolyte excretion. However, the impact of ACZ on body hydration status has not been adequately quantified. Thus, to establish the influence of ACZ treatment on body water, nine healthy males were evaluated for hydration status after clinically prescribed doses of ACZ. The drug was administered in three 250-mg oral doses 14, 8, and 2 h before determination of body water compartments. ACZ led to a significant 1.7-liter reduction in total body water (3.4%). A significant reduction in extracellular water of 3.3 liters is partitioned as the loss of total body water and a significant increase in intracellular water (1.6 liters). Venous blood pH and plasma HCO3- were significantly reduced 0.09 units and 5.9 mM, respectively, with ACZ. Plasma protein concentration was increased, but plasma osmolality did not change. Plasma Na+, K+, and Cl- concentrations were not different with ACZ, but total electrolyte content was significantly decreased 45.2, 1.17, and 44.1 meq, respectively, for all three. Urine K+, HCO3-, flow, and pH were elevated after ACZ treatment, whereas Na+ and Cl- were the same as placebo levels. In conclusion, acute clinical doses of ACZ reduce body fluid compartments, leading to a moderate isosmotic hypovolemia with an intracellular volume expansion as well as metabolic acidosis.\r"

  ".W": "Acetazolamide (ACZ), a potent carbonic anhydrase inhibitor, is known to decrease submaximal exercise tolerance under normoxic and hypoxic conditions. These decrements in performance occur despite the maintenance of O2 consumption and CO2 removal. Because ACZ is a diuretic, it induces a moderate hypohydration that may have a role in reducing the ability to sustain exercise through cardiovascular and thermoregulatory impairment. To investigate this potential impairment, seven healthy males between 21 and 35 yr of age were studied in a double-blind crossover design (placebo vs. ACZ). ACZ was administered in three 250-mg oral doses 14, 8, and 2 h before exercise. Subjects exercised at 70% peak O2 uptake for 30 min on a cycle ergometer in a normoxic thermoneutral environment (25 degrees C, 40% relative humidity). Results indicate that exercise minute ventilation was greater but O2 uptake, CO2 output, and respiratory exchange ratio did not differ with ACZ. ACZ led to lower mean skin (0.7 degrees C), higher rectal (0.6 degrees C), and higher mean body temperatures (0.4 degrees C) after 30 min of exercise. Whole-body sweat loss was reduced 23%, and heat storage during the exercise bout was increased 55%. Stroke volume decreased 25%, and arteriovenous O2 difference increased 15%. A significant inverse relationship (r = -0.63) between heart rate and stroke volume was observed. It is concluded that previously reported decreases in the ability to sustain submaximal exercise with ACZ may be related to hypohydration-induced impairment of the cardiovascular and thermoregulatory systems.\r"

We found 16 H(+)-sensitive cells; they were excited promptly on application of approximately 500 pl of acidified mock CSF in the vicinity of the neuron under investigation, whereas they were unaffected by microejection of the control mock CSF (pH 7.25-7.60). Of the 16 H(+)-sensitive cells, 10 units were further found to be excited by transcapillary stimulation of the central chemoreceptors by using a method of intravertebral arterial injection of CO2-saturated saline. The discharges increased in a similar time course to that of ventilatory augmentation. Distributions of these 10 specific H(+)-sensitive cells were found in the vicinity of nucleus tractus solitarii as well as deep in the ventrolateral medulla. The present results suggest a possibility that pH-dependent central chemoreceptors, if any, would be located in two distinct medullary regions described in this study.\r"

  ".W": "Wilson et al. (J. Appl. Physiol. 59:1924-28, 1985) have asserted that interdependence of regional expiratory flows could cause differences of interregional alveolar pressures to relax to time-independent limits during forced deflation. To test the hypothesis that such limiting differences do arise, we examined regional alveolar pressures during complete and partial maximally forced deflations of six excised canine lungs. Alveolar pressures were monitored using alveolar capsules on each of six lobes during forced deflations initiated at transpulmonary pressures of 30, 20, 15, and 10 cmH2O. In all lungs and in all maneuvers, interregional heterogeneity of alveolar pressure increased rapidly early in the deflation but much less so or not at all later in the deflation. When we compared complete with partial forced deflations, 16 of 24 maneuvers in six lungs showed clear evidence that as deflation progressed the degree of heterogeneity at isovolumic points became independent of the transpulmonary pressure from which the deflation was initiated. That is, alveolar pressures relaxed to limiting interregional differences that did not depend on time elapsed from the onset of the deflation. These data offer strong evidence of the existence of limiting differences. Such behavior implies that the sequence of regional emptying is controlled by a competition of opposing influences: nonuniformities of airway and parenchymal properties promoting nonuniformity of emptying vs. interdependence of regional expiratory flows promoting uniformity. As nonuniformity of regional pressures grows so do those factors that oppose that nonuniformity. These data underscore the insensitivity of maximum expiratory flow-volume curve configuration to the underlying inhomogeneous pattern of regional lung emptying.\r"

The ventilatory response was observed in conscious animals intact, after carotid denervation (CD), and after midcollicular decerebration. The results show that the initial small ventilatory depression was unaffected by CD but that the subsequent characteristic tachypnea was blunted after CD even after more prolonged exposure to CO. The CO tachypnea was not observed after decerebration, but a residual hyperventilation was noted with the higher concentration used. It may be concluded that carotid chemoreceptors do not mediate the CO tachypnea, which may then originate in suprapontine structures as shown by comparison of intact and decerebrate animals. The blunting of the tachypnea after CD may be caused by the relative hypercapnia observed in CD animals. The residual hyperventilation observed in decerebrate animals may be caused by central acidosis and/or some peripheral potentiation of chemoreceptor activity resulting from the decrease in arterial blood pressure that accompanied CO inhalation in decerebrate animals.\r"

  ".W": "In mammals submitted to a warm environment, intracerebral injection of dopamine (DA) produces no change or an increase in body temperature accompanied by an increase in metabolic heat production, but its effect on heat loss mechanisms such as vasodilation and tachypnea is not clear. Because the principal mechanism of heat loss in the conscious cat is thermal tachypnea, we studied the influence of DA on thermal tachypnea in response to heat stress (ambient temperature = 33-36 degrees C) in five conscious cats. We first studied the steady-state response to a DA agonist, apomorphine, which crosses the blood-brain barrier. Intravenous injection of apomorphine greatly reduced thermal tachypnea by decreasing respiratory frequency (from 94.9 to 52.5 breaths/min) and increasing tidal volume (from 13.2 to 20.4 ml). The subsequent injection of the DA antagonist haloperidol, which also crosses the blood-brain barrier, restored the initial tachypnea. To further investigate the mechanism involved in thermal tachypnea, we studied the influence of peripheral chemoreceptors by transiently stimulating or inhibiting carotid body (CB) activity during tachypneic breathing. CB stimulation by intravenous injection of NaCN or domperidone reduced thermal tachypnea mainly by decreasing the respiratory frequency, whereas CB inhibition by DA tended to increase frequency and thus tachypnea. It is concluded that 1) in a warm environment, central DA receptors are also greatly involved in heat loss mechanisms, 2) arterial chemoreceptor input appears to counteract this tachypneic breathing, and 3) thermal and hypoxic tachypnea may be controlled by the same mechanism in which a DA-like system has a key role.\r"

The right pulmonary artery (RPA) was cannulated within the pericardium, and systemic blood was pumped from the left atrium to the RPA between, but not during, periods of cooling. Cooled blood boluses were injected into the RPA under conditions in which either bolus temperature (5-35 degrees C) or volume (0-1.5 ml/kg body wt) varied. Inspiratory time (TI), expiratory time (TE), breath duration (TT), and peak integrated activity (PEAK) were determined from diaphragm EMG. Results for five postinjection breaths were converted to a percent of the values from five preinjection breaths. There was a linear relationship between bolus temperature and TI [r = 0.61, slope (x) = 0.59%/degrees C, P less than 0.001), TE (r = 0.73, x = 1.43%/degrees C, P less than 0.001] as well as TT (r = 0.74, x = 1.10%/degrees C, P less than 0.001), whereas PEAK was unaffected (n = 9). When injection temperature was 5 degrees C, an inverse linear relationship existed between bolus volume and TI (r = 0.75, x = -15.2%.ml-1.kg-1, P less than 0.001) and TE (r = 0.78, x = -23.4%.ml-1.kg-1, P less than 0.001) (n = 4). In two dogs tested the effect of bolus injection was minimal at residual volume and progressively increased with lung volume. The effect of cold bolus injection was eliminated after right vagotomy in three dogs. Results indicate that cooling of some vagal receptor in the lung increases breathing frequency primarily by shortening TE.\r"

Serum human growth hormone (hGH), testosterone (T), somatomedin-C (SM-C), glucose, and whole blood lactate (HLa) concentrations were determined preexercise, midexercise (i.e., after 4 of 8 exercises), and at 0, 5, 15, 30, 60, 90, and 120 min postexercise. All HREPs produced significant (P less than 0.05) temporal increases in serum T concentrations, although the magnitude and time point of occurrence above resting values varied across HREPs. No differences were observed for T when integrated areas under the curve (AUCs) were compared. Although not all HREPs produced increases in serum hGH, the highest responses were observed consequent to the H10/1 exercise protocol (high total work, 1 min rest, 10-RM load) for both temporal and time integrated (AUC) responses. The pattern of SM-C increases varied among HREPs and did not consistently follow hGH changes. Whereas temporal changes were observed, no integrated time (AUC) differences between exercise protocols occurred. These data indicate that the release patterns (temporal or time integrated) observed are complex functions of the type of HREPs utilized and the physiological mechanisms involved with determining peripheral circulatory concentrations (e.g., clearance rates, transport, receptor binding). All HREPs may not affect muscle and connective tissue growth in the same manner because of possible differences in hormonal and growth factor release.\r"

In 1973, elite athletes all trained vigorously, whereas in 1988 there was a great interindividual variation in physical training. In the lowest tertile of runners' training activity in 1988 (n = 9), the rate of decline in VO2max during the 15 yr was 1.11 +/- 0.15 (SE) ml.kg-1.min-1.yr-1, or 16% per decade, whereas the most active quintile of runners (n = 5) tended to increase VO2max (NS). The remaining 13 runners showed a rate of decline in VO2max of 0.54 +/- 0.14 ml.kg-1.min-1.yr-1, or 7% per decade. The rates of decline were 0.22 +/- 0.12 and 0.56 +/- 0.10 ml.kg-1.min-1.yr-1, or 5 and 11% per decade, in bobsledders and controls, respectively. When normalized for lean body mass instead of body weight, VO2max showed a reduced variability in the rate of decline, with values ranging from 0.00 +/- 0.27 (most active runners) to 0.69 +/- 0.15 ml.kg lean body mass-1.min-1.yr-1 (least active runners). In multiple linear regression analysis, 15-yr changes in mileage, running pace, and truncal fat together explained 51% of variance in the 15-yr change of VO2max normalized for body weight in runners and 41% in all study men. In runners, change in truncal fat was dependent on changes in both mileage and running pace. In the presence of physical training and anthropometric variables in the regression equation, the 15-yr decrease in maximum heart rate was only modestly predictive of the change in VO2max.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

When two of three lobes were ligated, Kf decreased (1.36 +/- 0.13 to 0.58 +/- 0.23 g.min-1.cmH2O-1; P less than 0.05), but PS did not change (2.02 +/- 0.4 to 1.71 +/- 0.3 ml/s). Kf per gram of perfused blood-free dry lung weight was unchanged by LL (0.051 +/- 0.17 to 0.052 +/- 0.18 g.min-1.cmH2O-1), indicating that surface area per gram measured by Kf remained the same. However, PS per gram dry lung doubled (0.07 +/- 0.016 to 0.146 +/- 0.06 ml/s; P less than 0.05) after LL, suggesting that recruitment occurred in the remaining lobe. When three lobes were embolized with 200-microns glass beads (0.48 +/- 0.01 g beads/kg body wt), PS decreased (2.1 +/- 0.22 to 0.94 +/- 0.09 ml/s; P less than 0.05), but Kf was not altered (1.01 +/- 0.17 to 1.04 +/- 0.18 g.min-1.cmH2O-1). The constancy of Kf after GBE implies that the vascular pressure increase during the Kf measurement was transmitted to both blocked and flowing vessels and thereby measured the same filtration area before and after GBE. PS decreased significantly after GBE because of a loss of perfused surface area by the beads blocking flow in small arterial vessels.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Serum total thyroxine (TT4) and serum total triiodothyronine (TT3), free T4 (FT4) and T3 (FT3), thyrotropin (TSH), and percent free fraction of T4 (%FT4) and T3 (%FT3) were measured in normal men (n = 15) before and after each of three SCATs. The SCAT was first carried out in California and then repeated after 24 and 44 wk AR. Mean arterial pressure (MAP) and sublingual oral temperature (Tor) were measured before and during each SCAT. The SCAT did not alter thyroid hormones before or after AR. The %FT4 decreased from 0.0334 +/- 0.0017 to 0.0295 +/- 0.0007% (P less than 0.002) with 44 wk AR but without a significant change in TT4 or FT4 for the same period. The %FT3 also decreased from 0.2812 +/- 0.0128 to 0.2458 +/- 0.0067% (P less than 0.005) after 44 wk AR. FT3 decreased (P less than 0.003) but TT3 and TSH were unchanged with 44 wk AR. The decrease in %FT4 and %FT3 may be theoretically accounted for by a 10% increase in either the capacity or the affinity of the serum binding proteins. The SCAT in California increased MAP and did not change Tor. After 44 wk AR, the SCAT no longer increased MAP but did lower Tor. The shift in the Tor and MAP response to the SCAT is consistent with the associated occurrence of cold adaptation during AR. We describe for the first time a decrease in the free fraction of both serum T3 and T4 present with extended polar residence and independent of a SCAT, further characterizing the recently reported \"polar T3 syndrome.\"\r"

Increasing breaths of SP (1.5 mg/ml, 1.1 mM), methacholine (0.15 mg/ml, 0.76 mM), or 0.9% saline were administered to tracheostomized and mechanically ventilated guinea pigs. Lung resistance (RL) increased dose dependently with a maximum effect of 963 +/- 85% of baseline values (mean +/- SE) after SP (60 breaths) and 1,388 +/- 357% after methacholine (60 breaths). After repeated hyperinflations, methacholine-treated animals returned to baseline, but after SP, mean RL was still raised (292 +/- 37%; P less than 0.005). Airway microvascular leakage, measured by extravasation of Evans Blue dye, occurred in the brain bronchi and intrapulmonary airways after SP but not after methacholine. There was a significant correlation between RL after hyperinflation and Evans Blue dye extravasation in intrapulmonary airways (distal: r = 0.89, P less than 0.005; proximal: r = 0.85, P less than 0.01). Examination of frozen sections for peribronchial and perivascular cuffs of edema and for alveolar flooding showed significant degrees of pulmonary edema for animals treated with SP compared with those treated with methacholine or saline. We conclude that the inability of hyperinflation to fully reverse changes in RL after SP may be due to the formation of both airway and pulmonary edema, which may also contribute to the deterioration in RL.\r"

Maximal exercise capacity (3.7 +/- 0.2 km/h and 10 +/- 5% inclination vs. 4.0 +/- 0.9 km/h and 15 +/- 0% inclination, P less than 0.02) and peak oxygen consumption (25 +/- 7 vs. 34 +/- 8 ml O2.min-1.kg-1, P less than 0.02) were both lower in the shunt than in the control lambs. This was due to a lower maximal systemic blood flow in the shunt lambs (271 +/- 38 vs. 359 +/- 71 ml.min-1.kg-1, P less than 0.01). Despite their high maximal left ventricular output, which was higher than in the control lambs (448 +/- 87 vs. 359 +/- 71 ml.min-1.kg-1, P less than 0.05), the left-to-right shunt could not be compensated for during maximal exercise because of a decreased reserve in heart rate (S: 183 +/- 22 to 277 +/- 38 beats/min; C: 136 +/- 25 to 287 +/- 29 beats/min) and in left ventricular stroke volume (S: 1.8 +/- 0.3 to 1.6 +/- 0.4 ml/kg; C: 1.0 +/- 0.3 to 1.3 +/- 0.2 ml/kg). We conclude that exercise capacity of shunt lambs is lower than that of control lambs, despite a good left ventricular performance, because a part of the reserves for increasing the left ventricular output is already utilized at rest.\r"

  ".W": "The effect of acute hypercapnia on skeletal muscle contractility and relaxation rate was investigated. The contractile force of fresh and fatigued quadriceps femoris (QF) and adductor pollicis (AP) was studied in normal humans by use of electrical stimulation. Maximum relaxation rate from stimulated contractions was measured for both muscles. Acute hypercapnia led to a rapid substantial reduction of contraction force. The respiratory acidosis after 9% CO2 was breathed for 20 min [mean venous blood pH 7.26 and end-tidal PCO2 (PETCO2) 65.1 Torr] reduced 20- and 100-Hz stimulated contractions of QF to 72.8 +/- 4.4 and 80.0 +/- 5.1% of control values, respectively. After 8 and 9% CO2 were breathed for 12 min, AP forces at 20- and 50-Hz stimulation were also reduced. Twitch tension of AP was reduced by a mean of 25.5% when subjects breathed 9% CO2 for 12 min [mean arterialized venous blood pH (pHav) 7.25 and PETCO2 66 Torr]. Over the range of 5% (pHav 7.38 and PETCO2 47 Torr) to 9% CO2, there was a linear relationship between twitch tension loss and pHav, arterialized venous blood PCO2, and PETCO2. Acute respiratory acidosis (mean PETCO2 61 Torr) increased the severity of low-frequency fatigue after intermittent voluntary contractions of AP. At 20 min of recovery, twitch tension was 63.2 +/- 13.4 and 46.8 +/- 16.4% of control value after exercise breathing air and 8% CO2, respectively. Acute hypercapnia (mean PETCO2 65.1 and 60.5 Torr) did not alter the maximum relaxation rate from tetanic contractions of fresh QF and from twitch tensions of AP.\r"

  ".W": "In the anesthetized closed-chest canine model of Gram-negative endotoxemia (n = 10), we tested the hypothesis that the effect of cardiac cycle-specific intrathoracic pressure pulses delivered by a heart rate-(HR) synchronized high-frequency jet ventilator (sync HFJV) on systolic ventricular performance is dependent on the level of preload. To control for HFJV frequency, hemodynamic responses were also measured at fixed frequency within 15% of HR (async HFJV). Biventricular stroke volumes (SV) were measured by electromagnetic flow probes. Measurements were made before (baseline) and 30 min after infusion of 1 mg/kg Escherichia coli endotoxin (serotype 055:B5) and then after 2 mg/kg propranolol at both low (less than 10 mmHg) left ventricular filling pressure (LVFP) and high (greater than 10 mmHg) LVFP. Ventricular function curves, aortic pressure-flow (P-Q) relationships, and venous return (VR) curves were analyzed. We found that endotoxin did not alter VR curves but shifted the aortic P-Q curves to the left with pressure on the x-axis (P less than 0.05). Volume loading increased SV (P less than 0.01) because of a rightward shift of the VR curve. No specific differences occurred with either sync or async HFJV during endotoxin, presumably because of preserved VR and shifted aortic P-Q. The lack of cardiac cycle-specific effects of ITP appears to be due to the selective endotoxin-induced changes in peripheral vasomotor tone that counterbalance any depressed myocardial contractility.\r"

  ".W": "A brain stem slice preparation from adult and neonatal (less than or equal to 12 days old) rats and intracellular recordings were used to examine the cellular properties of neurons within the hypoglossal (HYP) nucleus. Resting membrane potential (Vm) for adult hypoglossal neurons was -80 +/- 2 (SE) mV. Rheobase was 2.1 +/- 0.4 nA, and input resistance (RN) was 20.8 +/- 1.5 M omega and decreased during the hyperpolarizing period (\"sag\"). Compared with adult HYP cells, newborn HYP neurons had significantly lower resting potentials (Vm = -73 +/- 2 mV), lower rheobase (0.7 +/- 0.2 nA), and higher RN (27.6 +/- 3.9 M omega). Single action potentials, elicited by short depolarizing-current pulses, were followed by a slow afterhyperpolarization in adult [6.4 +/- 0.3 mV, time constant (tc) 31.0 +/- 1.2 ms] and newborn cells (7.4 +/- 0.2 mV, tc 37.2 +/- 8.2 ms). Prolonged outward current (2 s) produced little spike frequency adaptation in either adult or newborn neurons. Onset of spike activity was not delayed by hyperpolarizing pulses preceding depolarizations. In addition, pharmacological experiments showed that HYP neurons have a tetrodotoxin-sensitive Na+ current and a delayed and an inward rectifier current but no major Ca2+ current. We conclude the following. 1) Electrophysiological membrane properties mature postnatally in HYP neurons; some of these developmental changes can be ascribed to an increase in soma size and dendritic outgrowth but others cannot. 2) Adult HYP neurons, compared with other brain stem neurons (i.e., vagal cells or cells in the nucleus tractus solitarius), are not endowed with major Ca2+ currents or K+ currents such as the A current and the Ca2(+)-activated K+ current.\r"

Lung lymph flow rate (QL), plasma and lymph concentrations for nine protein fractions, urea permeability-surface area product (PS), urea effective diffusivity (D1/2S), and extravascular lung water (VE) were measured under each condition. Bloodless wet and dry lung weights were measured at the end of each experiment. QL increased and lymph-to-plasma concentration ratio for total proteins (L/P) decreased after the sheep were anesthetized and placed in a supine position. This possibly resulted from an increase in microvascular pressure induced by anesthesia and/or reorientation of the lungs. PS, D1/2S, and VE decreased, indicating a decrease in perfused surface area associated with a decreased cardiac output or alteration in lung orientation. After 90 min of extracorporeal perfusion, no significant differences were found in QL, PS, and D1/2S compared with those measured during the anesthetized period. No changes in PS or D1/2S could be detected after an average of 4.2 h of extracorporeal perfusion. The average bloodless wet-to-dry lung weight ratio [(W-D)/D] was 3.77 +/- 0.12, well within the range for normal sheep lungs. An increase in venous pressure of 15 cmH2O produced a response similar to that observed in the unanesthetized sheep lung lymph preparation: QL increased, L/P decreased, PS and D1/2S did not increase, and VE and (W-D)/D increased slightly.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The purpose of the present study was to provide a quantitative analysis of the ability of vagal excitatory innervation (encompassing the pre- and postganglionic fibers, airway ganglia, and airway smooth muscle) to alter pulmonary mechanics in the newborn. We measured the changes in pulmonary mechanics elicited by electrical stimulation of the vagus nerves in 20 newborn cats and 18 puppies anesthetized with chloralose urethan. Animals were tracheotomized and ventilated (chest open), and the cervical vagus nerves were sectioned and placed on stimulating electrodes. Animals were placed in a flow plethysmograph, and mean inspiratory resistance (RL,I) and dynamic compliance were measured on a breath-by-breath basis. In each animal RL,I increased, dynamic compliance decreased, and heart rate slowed during 10 s of vagal stimulation at frequencies ranging from 2 to 20 pulses/s. At each stimulus frequency there was a spectrum of responses with respect to the percent change in RL,I. At 15 pulses/s there was a fourfold difference in the RL,I response of the most- and least-sensitive animals. In both species, higher stimulus frequencies caused greater increases in RL,I; at 2 pulses/s RL,I increased on average approximately 40%, compared with approximately 250% at 20 pulses/s. The increase in RL,I was similar in the kitten and puppy at stimulus frequencies of 6 and 15 pulses/s but was less in the kitten at 2 pulses/s (P less than 0.01).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

These end points were related to the development of pulmonary edema by the measurement of the wet-to-dry weight ratio of the lung and the weight of fluid in the pleural cavity. No significant changes occurred until 48 h of hyperoxia, when sharp increases in both indexes of lung permeability and wet-to-dry weight ratio occurred. By 60 h of exposure, pleural effusions had developed. The volume of this effusion was significantly correlated to both 99mTc-DTPA clearance and 125I-albumin flux.\r"

The parameters A, B, and particularly K have been employed as descriptors of the intrinsic mechanical properties of the lung. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the sensitivities of A, B, and K to noise in measurements of P and V and to incompleteness of data. Using Monte-Carlo simulation, we found that the presence of typical levels of noise in P led to biased estimates of K and that the 95% confidence intervals about A and K were large compared with the parameter values themselves. These effects were increased as points were systematically removed from either end of the data set. These findings show that values of K estimated from PV data are difficult to interpret without accompanying confidence intervals.\r"

Current commercially available pneumotachographs (PNT) either increase the dead space, causing hyperventilation, or increase resistance, thus altering the mechanics of breathing. We modified a previously described low dead space PNT for infants to increase the linear range and frequency response. The mean resistance of the new PNT was 2.44 cmH2O.1-1.s compared with 2.65 cmH2O.1-1.s for the Fleisch no. 0 PNT. The added dead space over the standard endotracheal connector was 0.6 ml compared with 4.7 ml for the Fleisch PNT. Like the Fleisch PNT, the flow resistance was linear from 0 to 15 l/min. In response to a sinusoidal waveform, the new PNT had a phase angle of 21 degrees at 5 Hz and 50 degrees at 16 Hz compared with 19 degrees and 43 degrees, respectively, for the Fleisch PNT. The change in attenuation for both systems was zero until 20 Hz. In summary, the new PNT is lightweight and provides accuracy and low resistance with a very small dead space.\r"

  ".W": "Rahn et al. (J. Appl. Physiol. 69: 1546-1548, 1990) showed that the gas pressure in a plethysmograph containing an intact egg oscillates in phase with electrocardiogram (ECG) and that this pressure variation could be used as a noninvasive way to determine the heart rate of an avian embryo. One possible mechanism to account for the pressure oscillation is the mechanical movement of the embryonic heart, which leads to volume shifts of gas within the plethysmograph. Another possibility is that the oscillation of gas pressure with heartbeat is pulsatile gas exchange resulting from pulsatile blood flow. If gas exchange were transiently stopped, a pressure signal dependent on gas exchange should disappear, while a pressure signal dependent on cardiovascular motion should persist. Using a number of late-age hen eggs (at days 15-20 of incubation), we tested these hypotheses by suddenly changing the gas composition surrounding an egg and measuring the effect of the pressure oscillation. We found that 1) after 5% CO2-95% N2 was flushed into the plethysmograph (presumably halting gas exchange), pressure oscillations went almost to zero and the ECG signal remained; after air was flushed back to the plethysmograph, the pressure signal returned to control level; 2) after 20% CO2-20% O2-60% N2 was flushed into the plethysmograph (presumably increasing net gas exchange), the pressure signal increased 2.5-fold compared with that in air; and 3) after 1% CO2-99% N2 was flushed into the plethysmograph (presumably reversing gas exchange), the oscillation pressure decreased to one-fourth of that in air and the phase of pressure relative to ECG reversed compared with the phase in air.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The sources of emboli were probable cardiac (8 = 20%)--mural cardiac thrombus detected by echocardiogram; possible cardiac (12 = 29%)--arrhythmias or other cardiac pathology detected without mural thrombus; probable arterio-arterial (7 = 17%)--proximal arterial thrombus detected; probable paradoxical embolism (2 = 5%)--fulfills the Johnson criteria with cardiac defect and right-to-left shunt detected by contrast echo in one patient and cardiac catheterization in the other; possible paradoxical embolism (3 = 7%)--meets two of three Johnson criteria without evidence of other source; and unknown source (9 = 22%)--conventional work-up negative or incomplete. Five of nine patients (56%) less than 50 years old had probable or possible paradoxical embolism, while in two patients (22%), the origin was unknown.

  ".W": "Tumor involvement of the carotid artery with head and neck cancers may be present either simultaneously with the primary lesion or more often appears at a later date following resection of the primary tumor. Management of the secondary tumor consists of its resection together with the involved carotid artery with or without carotid artery reconstruction. The Authors are convinced that the best chance for cure of patients with advanced head and neck squamous cell cancers involving the carotid artery is radical extirpation with ablative surgery in the form of en block resection of the primary lesion, the secondary tumor, and the involved carotid artery followed by immediate revascularization. This bold approach was carried out in two male patients, 48 and 61 years of age, followed by chemotherapy and radiation therapy in one and radiation therapy alone in the other, with excellent results. Dermal grafts were placed over the entire length of the arterialized veins to protect them from radiation injury. Based on this limited experience and excellent results, we recommend this one-stage surgical ablative procedure in well selected patients. However, cooperation between the ENT and vascular surgeons, strict adherence to the principles and techniques of vascular surgery, and coverage of the arterialized vein with a dermal graft is absolutely essential.\r"

Sixty patients were operated as emergencies for aneurysm rupture and 181 electively. One hundred and fourteen bifurcated and 127 tube grafts were inserted. The transperitoneal approach was used in 64 cases and the remainder were placed using a retroperitoneal approach. There was a one-month mortality of 2.8% in elective and 20% in emergency cases. Median follow-up was 26 months. Specific graft complications included one infected graft resulting in a graft-enteric fistula. No graft rupture, degeneration, dilatation, pseudoaneurysm or late graft limb thromboses were observed in up to 7 years of follow-up. The aortic ePTFE prosthesis demonstrated satisfactory performance over the period studied.\r"

There were 18 males and 11 females with a medium age of 42 years. All cases had uncontrollable and severe hypertension for an average medium time of 48 months, 11 patients had variable degrees of renal insufficiency. The diagnosis was made utilizing standard methods including in all cases angiography of the abdominal aorta, celiac axis and renal arteries. One patient died after the operation due to intestinal infarction, the remaining have been followed for a medium time of 50 months. All patients improved or cured their renal insufficiency. The hypertension was cured in 23, improved in 4 and failed in 1, this latter patient was successfully autotransplanted. A precise exposition of the surgical technique is presented with comments about their advantages and indications. A review of the literature in surgical experience with the technique of splenorenal arterial anastomosis has been done.\r"

  ".W": "Several laboratories have found canine platelet aggregometry predictive of thrombotic potential in vascular grafts. Adenosine diphosphate (ADP) is a frequently used agonist, often at unspecified or differing concentrations. This study was designed to evaluate the predictive value of ADP-induced platelet aggregometry and the validity of the methodology. Platelet aggregometry in response to 2 x 10(-5) M ADP was assayed in 70 dogs. Twenty-six percent were aggregators, 51% were non-aggregators, and 20% were indeterminant. All dogs were then treated with aspirin and dipyridamole. Vascular prostheses were implanted bilaterally (aorto-iliac) and anti-platelet therapy continued for two weeks. Dose-response to ADP was studied at three concentrations in 20 dogs. At 2 x 10(-5) 1/20 aggregated, at 4 x 10(-5) 3/19 aggregated and at 2 x 10(-4) 15/20 aggregated. Time between samples and study was evaluated in 11 dogs, with 2/11 changing from non-aggregator to aggregator at two or three hours. Daily reproducibility was studied in 70 dogs, 14 of which changed aggregation status between days. Patency was 58/68 (85%) for non-aggregators, 23/34 (68%) for aggregators (p = 0.038). Platelet aggregometry has significant predictive value for graft patency but methodology must be specified and standardized.\r"

  ".U": "91086336\r", 
  ".W": "Based on our findings that changes in wall shear stress, not the rate of blood flow, were the main hemodynamic factor related to intimal hyperplasia of autologous vein grafts, we further investigated the effect of wall shear stress variation on sequential ultrastructural changes in the intimal hyperplasia of arterially transplanted autovein grafts, using canine models. As noted, wall shear stress variation (tau-variation) could be defined by the variation in wall shear stress within a cardiac cycle, using a desktop flow waveform analyzer. In Group I, which had a high flow rate of 78.4 +/- 4.6 ml/min and low tau-variation of 36.1 +/- 2.2 dynes/cm2, intimal hyperplasia was significant. Ultrastructurally, there was a marked transformation of intimal smooth muscle cells to secretory cells 2 to 4 weeks after implantation. The surface of the intima was lined with modified smooth muscle cells at 2 weeks after implantation. In Group II, which had a low flow rate of 5.6 +/- 2.2 ml/min and normal tau-variation value (174.6 +/- 13.0 dynes/cm2), intimal hyperplasia was minimal, and there were several layers of contractile type smooth muscle cells, with characteristic myofibrillae. The surface of the intima was lined with endothelial cells at 2 weeks after implantation. These findings suggest that, in regions of low wall shear stress variation, intimal smooth muscle cells of autovein grafts may well become secretory cells, and enhanced platelet adherence could occur during early intimal repair, causing intimal hyperplasia to develop.\r"

Pseudoaneurysm is not an infrequent complication. It is often difficult to differentiate pseudoaneurysm clinically from hematoma. In the past, we have used gray scale duplex scanning to aid in this differentiation. We have recently found color Doppler scanning to allow quicker, easier, and more accurate diagnosis. Color Doppler imaging also can often demonstrate the track between the artery and the aneurysm.\r"

  ".U": "91086338\r", 
  ".W": "As of the end of September 1989, 52 EXS Dacron grafts had been implanted for femoropopliteal bypass operations. The distal ends of 27 grafts were anastomosed to above-knee popliteal arteries and those of 25 grafts to below-knee popliteal arteries. The cumulative patency rate of above-knee grafts was 71.3% at 54 months, and that of below-knee grafts was 78.8% at 48 months (n.s.). Kinking and stenosis of the arteriosclerotic proximal and/or mid popliteal artery when the knee was bent were angiographically remarkable. These changes may explain why some femoropopliteal grafts occlude with time and why the late results of above-knee grafts are not much better than those of below-knee grafts.\r"

The indication for the reconstructive procedure was intermittent claudication 36%, rest pain 34%, and gangrene 26%. All patients had angiographic evidence of a patent proximal superficial femoral artery and many had relative indications for short bypass such as limited saphenous vein availability or compromised medical condition. There was a cumulative patency rate of 79% by life table method for the series with a six year follow-up. We have observed that the superficial femoral artery is a satisfactory inflow site for proximal popliteal bypass grafts in selected patients. The procedure can maximize use of a limited segment of vein with minimal operative time and morbidity. Inflow stenosis can be revised or long bypass procedures can be offered in the event of graft failure.\r"

Mean blood flow rates in the implanted grafts ranged from 43 to 340 ml/min and those of the reconstructed crural arteries from 20 to 100 ml/min. A stenotic lesion was noted on postoperative angiogram in one patient and stasis symptoms caused by downward blood flow into the distal veins in another. The other patients have remained well with good function of the grafts 1-5 years after surgery. We modified the distal corner of the anastomosis as follows: three additional interrupted simple sutures were made on the anterior wall of the concomitant arteriotomy and venotomy incisions after making the common posterior wall of the vessel incisions. A vascular pocket formed at the distal corner of the anastomosis prevents stricture at the anastomosis. The vein is finally ligated just distal to the fistula to intercept downward blood flow into the distal veins. This modification in technique is recommended to prevent stricture of the distal anastomosis and postoperative stasis symptoms.\r"

It is suitable for simple, uncomplicated side-to-side fistulas amenable to this procedure.\r"
