This trend is largely attributable to improved detection and management of cardiovascular risk factors, in which the Framingham Heart Study has played a major role. This article examines some of the risk factors associated with coronary heart disease, notably, advancing age, hypertension, left ventricular hypertrophy, smoking, elevated serum cholesterol, and reduced high-density lipoprotein, all of which have been investigated by the Framingham Heart Study. In addition, new data are presented from a multidimensional model of coronary heart disease. This is a novel approach that takes into account the interactions of multiple risk factors and their contribution to overall coronary heart disease risk.\r"

Specific elucidation of the effects of diuretics on electrolytes, however, has been difficult, since the heart failure state itself may alter the electrolyte balance. Nevertheless, it is noteworthy that the natriuretic effect of loop diuretics is greater in edematous patients than in healthy volunteers; yet, the initial kaliuresis is minimal--perhaps because aldosterone levels are low. With continued treatment (or after the edema has been cleared), however, the natriuretic action of loop diuretics is less than that seen in controls, but loss of potassium occurs. The addition of a thiazide to a loop diuretic enhances its natriuretic effect. Both loop and thiazide diuretics can induce depletion of magnesium. Potassium-sparing diuretic drugs augment the natriuresis induced by loop or thiazide diuretics but limit or prevent the loss of potassium or magnesium in the urine, at least in the short term. However, potassium-sparing diuretics can exacerbate the development of hyponatremia.\r"

  ".U": "90177923\r", 
  ".W": "Congestive heart failure is characterized by both disturbances in electrolyte homeostasis and neuro-hormonal regulation. Total body potassium is reduced, and this reduction bears a modest relation to activation of the sympathetic nervous system and the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. Patients with decompensated heart failure show increases in both plasma epinephrine and plasma norepinephrine, whereas patients with chronic stable heart failure usually have an increase only in plasma norepinephrine. High levels of circulating epinephrine may contribute to the development of hypokalemia by activating skeletal muscle and liver membrane beta 2-adrenergic receptors, which in turn stimulate intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate to activate the membrane-bound Na+K(+)-adenosine triphosphatase pump. The net result is that potassium flux across the cell membrane from the extracellular to the intracellular space increases, setting the stage for hypokalemia and possibly serious ventricular arrhythmias. Other mechanisms that may contribute to the development of hypokalemia in heart failure include the kaliuresis brought on by excessive levels of aldosterone. Moreover, it is likely that the activity of facilitated by concomitant activation of the renin-angiotensin system. Increased sympathetic nerve activity may then release additional renin from the kidney (by way of a beta 2-adrenergic mechanism). Therefore, both the sympathetic nervous system and the adrenal medulla may interact to cause hypokalemia in patients with heart failure. Because hypokalemia is known to predispose patients to ventricular arrhythmias, it may be prudent to aggressively maintain serum potassium levels in patients with heart failure in the range of 4 to 5 mEq/liter.\r"

  ".W": "In patients after myocardial infarction, survival is influenced by the presence or absence of anterograde flow in the infarct artery, and late potentials on signal-averaged electrocardiography identify those at risk for tachyarrhythmias and sudden death. To assess the frequency of late potentials in survivors of first infarction, coronary arteriography and signal-averaged electrocardiography were performed in 109 subjects (64 men, 45 women, aged 30 to 77 years), 49 with (group I) and 60 without (group II) anterograde flow in the infarct artery. The groups were similar in age, sex, infarct artery, severity of coronary artery disease and left ventricular function. However, only 4 (8%) of group I had late potentials, whereas 24 (40%) of group II had late potentials (p less than 0.001). Thus, anterograde flow in the infarct artery after myocardial infarction is associated with a low incidence of late potentials on signal-averaged electrocardiography, whereas the absence of anterograde flow is more often associated with late potentials.\r"

  ".W": "In a prospective series of 201 consecutive patients with creatine kinase-MB--documented acute myocardial infarction (AMI), postadmittance and predischarge echocardiographic wall motion indexes (WMI) were determined (median 45 hours vs 14 days after AMI). No significant change of left ventricular systolic performance was found between postadmittance and predischarge examinations in 179 survivors (WMI 1.3 +/- 0.4 vs 1.4 +/- 0.4, p greater than 0.05). Hospital mortality was 11% (22 of 201), cumulated 2-month mortality 15% (31 of 201) and cumulated 1-year mortality 26% (52 of 201). Mortality increased rapidly with decreasing left ventricular function as determined by WMI. When early WMI was less than 1.0, 1-year mortality was 51% (28 of 55) versus 8% (7 of 83) when WMI was greater than 1.3 (p less than 0.0001). Ventricular fibrillation (n = 24) and cardiogenic shock (n = 27) carried a much better prognosis when WMI showed good left ventricular function. When WMI was less than 1.0, 1-year mortality was 83% (10 of 12) versus 93% (13 of 14) in ventricular fibrillation and cardiogenic shock, respectively, whereas it was 0% (0 of 4) versus 33% (2 of 6) when WMI was greater than 1.3. In 15% of patients major discrepancies between early Killip class and WMI were noted. WMI showed much smaller fluctuations during the hospital course of AMI than did Killip class and appeared to be a more stable prognostic marker. Large-scale, early risk stratification by echocardiography has now become available and appears to facilitate a rational, individualized discharge policy in the coronary care unit and to provide an improved basis for randomization of patients in controlled studies aimed at tailoring new treatment in AMI.\r"

There were 6 +/- 2 extra minutes of procedure time and 86 +/- 63 extra seconds of fluoroscopy time used. Abnormalities were detected in 69 (35%) patients. These findings were unexpected in 37 of these patients and in 3 patients, further evaluation was prompted. However, management was altered in only 3 (1.5%) patients as a result of data obtained by right-sided catheterization. In conclusion this additional procedure rarely adds clinically useful information about patients undergoing left-sided catheterization and angiography for coronary artery disease without a clinical indication for right-sided catheterization.\r"

  ".W": "Previous studies of the value of electrophysiologic studies in patients with nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (VT) have been hampered by the inclusion of a small number of patients with various types of heart disease. This retrospective study was designed to assess the value of programmed stimulation in 205 asymptomatic patients who had had an acute myocardial infarction greater than 1 month before study. Inclusion was based on 24-hour Holter monitoring during which patients had to manifest greater than or equal to 3 consecutive ventricular beats at a rate greater than 135 beats/min. Forty-seven (23%) patients had normal, 70 (34%) mildly impaired and 88 (43%) severely impaired left ventricular function. Programmed stimulation, using up to 3 extrastimuli, was used in each. Seventy-five patients (36%) were noninducible, 59 (29%) had nonsustained VT (less than 30 seconds), 67 (33%) had sustained monomorphic VT and 4 (2%) had either polymorphic VT or ventricular fibrillation. Eighty-two patients were not treated with antiarrhythmic drugs, 57 others were placed on a program selected empirically and 66 had therapy guided by electrophysiologic testing. Satisfactory follow-up information was gathered in 187 of the 205 patients, with a mean follow-up of 18 months. One hundred forty-two patients are alive and well, 39 had sustained VT or sudden death and 6 others had a cardiac death. Only left ventricular function discriminated those who had a sustained arrhythmia or died from those who did not. Thus, programmed stimulation did not have independent predictive value in patients with nonsustained VT. However, definitive conclusions can be reached only with a large prospective study carried out in untreated patients.\r"

To study the clinical potential of vagomimetic intervention, the effect of transdermal scopolamine on fluctuations in heart rate was studied in 32 healthy adult subjects using both time-domain (mean RR interval, standard deviation of the mean RR interval, mean of the differences between consecutive RR intervals) and frequency-domain measures (spectrum analysis of 128 consecutive RR intervals) of heart rate variability. After an exposure of 24 hours, transdermal scopolamine resulted in a significant increase in all indexes tested. The increase was most pronounced in the 0.25-Hz respiratory peak of the RR interval power spectrum, compatible with a strong vagomimetic mode of action of transdermal scopolamine. Results indicate that transdermal scopolamine may have potential merit as a selective vagotonic agent in certain patients with myocardial infarction, heart failure or ventricular arrhythmias.\r"

The study consisted of a standard protocol (up to 2 extrastimuli given only once for each extrastimulus prematurity, 2 right ventricular sites and 3 basic pacing cycle lengths, as well as rapid ventricular pacing) in which double extrastimulation at the shortest coupling intervals that allowed ventricular capture was repeated 10 times. A stimulus current of 3 mA was used. Sustained ventricular tachyarrhythmias were induced in 23 of 25 (92%) patients who presented with sustained VT, 14 of 16 (88%) patients who presented with VF and 2 of 30 (7%) group 2 patients. Eighteen of 25 (72%) patients with sustained VT but only 4 of 16 (25%) with VF had arrhythmias inducible at \"immediate\" trials of single or double extrastimulation (p less than 0.01). Repetition of double extrastimulation increased the yield of inducible sustained ventricular tachyarrhythmia to 92% in patients with sustained VT (+20%, p = 0.14) and 75% (+50%, p = 0.013) in patients with VF. Rapid right ventricular pacing added a 13% increase in the overall yield in patients with VF. This new protocol of programmed ventricular stimulation has both high sensitivity (90%) and specificity (93%) for induction of sustained VT.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Tachycardia rate during electrophysiologic study in the head-up position more closely approximated the rate of clinical tachycardia than did the rate in the supine position. Head-up tilt significantly enhances anterograde and retrograde accessory pathway conduction, increases the rate of arrhythmias using an accessory pathway and may be clinically useful in the assessment of patients with an accessory pathway.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of intravenous cibenzoline (1.5 mg/kg) on atrial vulnerability and electrophysiology were assessed in 25 patients with documented paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (AF), in whom sustained (greater than 30 seconds) AF was induced by atrial stimulation with up to 2 extrastimuli and paced rates between 100 and 180 beats/min. In 7 patients AF persisted despite the application of cibenzoline, and in 8 patients the induction of sustained AF was prevented by cibenzoline. Intraatrial conduction time, flutter cycle length and shortest ventricular cycle length during AF were increased by cibenzoline (p less than or equal to 0.01). Sinus cycle length was decreased (p less than or equal to 0.05), whereas sinus node recovery time remained unchanged. The effective refractory period of the right atrium was not significantly affected. Eight patients with frequent episodes of paroxysmal AF received oral cibenzoline for control of paroxysmal AF irrespective of the efficacy of intravenous cibenzoline. Prevention of stimulation-induced AF predicted successful treatment of paroxysmal AF (p = 0.018). Cibenzoline could be effective in the treatment of atrial arrhythmias, and selection of an antiarrhythmic therapy for recurrent AF seems to be useful.\r"

In 1980, all of these women completed an independently validated dietary questionnaire, which included use of alcoholic beverages. During 4 years of follow-up, 3,275 women reported an initial diagnosis of hypertension; validity of the self-report measure was demonstrated in a subsample. When compared to nondrinkers, women drinking 20 to 34 g of alcohol per day (about 2 or 3 drinks) had a significantly elevated relative risk of 1.4; the 95% confidence interval (CI) was 1.2 to 1.7 after adjustment for age and Quetelet's index. For women consuming greater than 35 g/day, the relative risk was 1.9 (95% CI 1.6 to 2.2). Adjustment for smoking and dietary variables did not alter these results. Independent significant associations were observed for the consumption of beer, wine and liquor. These prospective data suggest that alcohol intake of up to about 20 g/day does not increase the risk of hypertension among women, but beyond this level, the risk increases progressively.\r"

Ten patients with congestive heart failure (class III and IV) underwent hemodynamic evaluation before and after a 5-mg oral dose of terazosin. At rest and during exercise, terazosin significantly decreased pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, systemic vascular resistance and mean arterial pressure while cardiac index increased. Stroke volume index increased (p less than 0.01) during exercise while left ventricular stroke work index remained unchanged in both experimental conditions. Terazosin administration significantly decreased both rest and exercise myocardial oxygen consumption while exercise coronary sinus oxygen content increased and arterial-coronary sinus oxygen difference diminished (p less than 0.05). Parallel with these changes, alpha blockade decreased the ratio of coronary blood flow to total cardiac output. Coronary vascular resistance remained unaltered with alpha blockade both at rest and during exercise. Coronary blood flow tended to diminish with decreased myocardial oxygen demand. Alpha 1 blockade induces systemic vasodilation and improves myocardial circulatory parameters without inducing coronary dilation or altering metabolic autoregulation.\r"

The technique was used successfully in 10 adult patients with rheumatic mitral stenosis. After the procedure there was a significant reduction in mitral valve pressure gradient and an increase in the mitral valve area in all cases. There were no serious complications during or after the procedure. This technique should prove to be a useful nonsurgical treatment for mitral stenosis and could provide an alternative to the transseptal method.\r"

Published data were used to determine the following for 7 theoretical subjects ranging in size from 0.2 m2 (normal newborn) to 2.2 m2 (large adult): average left ventricular (LV) end-diastolic diameter; aortic root diameter; right pulmonary artery diameter; aortic valve area; LV end-diastolic volume; and LV mass. Linear dimensions (LV, aortic and right pulmonary artery diameter) increased as a square root function of surface area and could not be described by a constant \"index\" of dimension to surface area. Aortic valve area was linearly related to surface area and equalled 3.4 cm2/m2 for subjects of all sizes. LV volume and mass were exponentially related to surface area. This study indicates that intracardiac areas may be indexed for body surface area, but that linear dimensions and volumes have a nonlinear relation to surface area and are more appropriately indexed by surface area to the 0.5 and 1.5 power, respectively.\r"

Similar and significant decreases of serum PA and RBP were observed during the VLCDs studied. The molar ratio of RBP to PA did not vary during dieting. Thus, when less than 500 kcal/d are given, changes of serum short-half-life visceral proteins are not affected by either the addition of CHO to protein or the changes in protein intake. Moreover, serum albumin concentration and RBP/PA do not vary during VLCDs.\r"

After multiple-logistic-regression adjustment for covariates, the odds ratio (OR) of stunting at 6 mo was reduced among infants breast-fed only or fed with supplement compared with weaned infants. Infant-feeding practices were not associated with stunting in later infancy; however, those stunted at 6 mo had an OR of 13 of stunting at 12 mo and those stunted at 12 mo had an OR of 14 of stunting at 18 mo. In a multiple-linear-regression analysis, seasonality, duration of breast-feeding, hospitalized morbidity, and residual of height at 6 mo were negatively associated with daily average linear growth from 6 to 12 mo; these factors only explained 12% of the variation in daily linear growth.\r"

Analyses were done for seven consecutive nonoverlapping intervals comparing children randomly assigned to receive supplemental feeding from birth to age 36 mo or to serve as control subjects. Absolute responsiveness was greatest between ages 3-6 mo; supplemented infants grew 0.61 cm more and gained 162 g more than did unsupplemented infants (p less than 0.005). Relative to rates of growth, responsiveness was greatest between ages 9 and 12 mo (the period of peak diarrheal prevalence), followed by ages 3-6 mo (the period of weaning). Responsiveness to supplementation is thus directly related to age-dependent risk patterns for malnutrition. Targeting supplementation programs to coincide with periods of high nutritional risk should maximize their effectiveness in reducing malnutrition, though caution should be exercised to avoid disruption of breast-feeding.\r"

Nitrogen losses in milk did not account entirely for these differences. Nitrogen balance showed linear (p less than 0.04) and quadratic (p less than 0.03) trends over time postpartum among the lactating women. Urinary 3-methylhistidine excretion also was reduced (p less than 0.05) in lactating compared with nonlactating women. These observations suggest that protein intakes of 1.0 g.kg body wt-1.d-1 in lactating women are associated with adaptive responses that promote the conservation of skeletal muscle protein stores and that currently recommended dietary protein allowances may be insufficient to meet the nutritional needs of well-nourished lactating women.\r"

Short-chain acylcarnitines were elevated in plasma and normal in RBCs. HD therapy decreased plasma free and acylcarnitines markedly but did not influence RBC values. Low-dose L-carnitine treatment normalized both plasma- and RBC-free carnitine. Dosages of 5 and 15 mg/kg body wt increased plasma and intracellular carnitine and carnitine esters impressively. Plasma and RBC carnitine fractions remained elevated even after a 6-wk washout period. Low-dose L-carnitine treatment is sufficient to correct disturbed plasma and RBC carnitine and carnitine esters of HD patients. Elevated RBC carnitine esters decreased very slowly, suggesting low RBC carnitine turnover. Carnitine overdosage should be prevented in those patients who benefit from carnitine therapy.\r"

The ratio of 14C to 3H (R) in protein 6 h after injection of these isotopes is a measure of the extent to which extracellular keto acid, as compared with extracellular amino acid, serves as the source of the intracellular amino acid used for protein synthesis. R for 2-ketoisocaproate (KIC) vs leucine was 0.45 +/- 0.03 for whole body protein after oral injection and 0.83 +/- 0.02 after iv injection. R values for 2-ketoisovalerate (KIV) vs valine were similar. R, measured in the protein of various organs and in albumin, fibrin, and globin, varied more than twofold. We conclude that at least half of KIC and KIV given orally in this dosage is oxidized in splanchnic organs during first pass but that, nevertheless, these keto acids given orally serve as significant sources of the intracellular amino acids used for protein synthesis in most organs, particularly brain and heart.\r"

EGRAC data were highly correlated between sexes (p less than 0.001) and between neighboring communes within the same county (p less than 0.001) and with riboflavin intake (p less than 0.001). The urinary-riboflavin-load test data were not correlated either with EGRAC or with riboflavin intake. Approximately 90% of the survey subjects were found to be deficient by Western and Chinese reference standards and allowances. Upon reconsideration of the Western experimental data originally used to establish these recommendations, it is suggested that riboflavin allowances are set too high both in China and in Western countries.\r"

In the rest of the anemic group, five patients had plasma ferritin concentrations greater than 1000 micrograms/L. There was no difference in riboflavin status between control subjects and patients or between the two anemic groups. Severity of anemia was no different between the two anemic groups either. The data indicate that riboflavin deficiency makes no contribution to the infection-induced elevation in plasma ferritin and that the contribution of malaria is smaller than that of other unidentified factors.\r"

During three consecutive 24-h periods, subjects consumed four foods per day that had each been supplemented with 72.0 mg PABA and also made complete urine collections. An additional 24-h urine collection was made by each subject for determination of baseline PABA excretion. The PABA was easily incorporated into the test foods and was not detected by taste. The recovery of the PABA in urine, determined by colorimetric assay, was 98.7 +/- 3.7% (means +/- SD) of intake. Thus, in metabolic studies for greater than or equal to 3 d, PABA can be used to provide a sensitive index of dietary compliance.\r"

For 81 cases, there was excellent correlation between the two methods. For nine cases, however, an aneuploid population, usually near tetraploid, was identified by image but not by flow cytometry. Three cases had aneuploid peaks by flow cytometry that were not identified by image. Although these methods show good correlation, rare populations may be missed by CAS, presumably because of sampling errors in the touch preparation. Aneuploid populations may also be missed by flow cytometry, either because of cell loss during processing or because visual identification by image can increase sensitivity.\r"

Increasing the sodium chloride concentration caused logarithmic increases in the partitioning. At 25 degrees C the slopes (log10[peak height]/mol sodium/L) obtained with the use of water or plasma were as follows: acetonitrile, 0.064 (0.059); ethanol, 0.126 (0.125); n-propanol, 0.152 (0.149); and t-butanol, 0.200 (0.183). Differences in water content between the two liquids may contribute to the small differences in the regression data. More importantly, saturation with sodium chloride at 25 degrees C produced solutions with different sodium molarities: 5.2 mol/L for water and 4.8 mol/L for plasma. This difference in salt concentration at saturation and the volatile dependent slopes can account for a large part of the error in plasma ethanol concentrations when measured with the use of aqueous external standardization and internal standardization with any of the other volatiles. Deproteinization of the plasma abolished the liquid phase-dependent differences in saturated salt concentration and partitioning.\r"

Circulating organisms were detected in the blood smears or buffy coat preparations from five patients and were associated with PB nRBCs and severe absolute monocytopenia. Morphologically, the marrow specimens showed one of four patterns: (1) no morphologic evidence of infection (two patients, one with a positive marrow culture); (2) discrete granulomas (two patients, both with positive marrow cultures); (3) lymphohistiocytic aggregates (six patients, four with positive marrow cultures); and (4) diffuse macrophage infiltrates (three patients, all with positive marrow cultures). Morphologic examination of the bone marrow combined with cultures is useful in diagnosing disseminated histoplasmosis in patients with AIDS. However, the morphologic findings in the bone marrow may be different in patients with AIDS compared with non-AIDS patients, and seemingly nondiagnostic morphologic features must be approached with a high degree of suspicion in diagnosing infections with H. capsulatum in this population.\r"

High MPV and PDW showed high specificity for detecting bacteremia (95% and 79%, respectively), and had good negative predictive value. Neonates with blood cultures positive at birth (early infection) tended to have normal platelet volumes, while those infected after three days of age (late infection) had dramatic increases in MPV and PDW.

Contamination by plasma von Willebrand factor to account for the higher values found by the first method was excluded by monitoring the presence of added purified I125 von Willebrand factor to platelet rich plasma. vWF multimer analysis showed the same distribution of multimers in both preparations but suggested a relative decrease in lower molecular weight multimers with the second method.

The authors evaluated the automated Behring Nephelometer using Behring reagents for the detection of low level urinary albumin. Within run coefficients of variation (CVs, N = 20) are 1.7%, 1.3%, and 2.4% at mean urinary albumin levels of 16, 70, and 217 mg/L, respectively. Between run CVs (N = 20) are 4.5%, 2.6%, and 4.4% at mean albumin levels of 19, 71, and 239 mg/L, respectively. The method is sensitive to 3 mg/L. Hemoglobin, immunoglobulins, bilirubin, urea, and radiographic contrast media beyond a few hours of injection show no significant interference at levels normally expected from clinical specimens. Analysis is unaffected by pH within the physiologic range. Most urine specimens are stable for at least eight days when refrigerated at 4 degrees C. Specimen centrifugation before analysis is essential to avoid a negative bias that occurs when analyzing uncentrifuged refrigerated samples. Preanalytical freezing produces results higher than those observed in fresh or refrigerated samples. The authors conclude that automated nephelometry using the Behring Nephelometer is a convenient, simple, and accurate technique for the determination of low level urinary albumin.\r"

However, they are seldom encapsulated and therefore may recur locally if incompletely excised. The authors report on two benign mesenchymomas composed of mature fat, thin-walled small and medium size vessels, and spindle cells demonstrated to be smooth muscle by immunohistochemical studies. They were diagnosed in women in their 50s. Both were located in the round ligament of the uterus. One was discovered incidentally during hysterectomy, and the other was unusually large, being diagnosed preoperatively as a retroperitoneal liposarcoma. Most round ligament tumors are leiomyomas or fibromas. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first report of benign mesenchymomas occurring in this location.\r"

Although there are few comparative data, a cost advantage is claimed for the radiographic method, as no endoscopy is required. We performed upper endoscopy on 201 patients prior to attempted percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG). The medical records of these patients were reviewed. Data collected included endoscopic findings which precluded gastrostomy, necessitated conversion to jejunostomy, or led to changes in medical management. For a total of 73 patients (36%), findings at pregastrostomy endoscopy led to major changes in medical management, including 35 patients with severe reflux esophagitis, 29 patients with peptic ulcers, and two patients with gastric outlet obstruction. Appropriate treatment of such conditions may improve morbidity, mortality, and cost by reducing length of hospital stay. The authors recommend diagnostic upper endoscopy in patients undergoing percutaneous gastrostomy, regardless of placement method.\r"

In our study, we investigated the absorption and transport of synthetic and natural particles by means of scanning electron microscopy (SEM). In Wistar rats, closed loops of jejunum with intact mesenteric blood supply were established in ether anesthesia so that we might study the absorption of latex particles of different sizes. After variable absorption times, loops were removed and prepared for examination by microscopic techniques. The average surface of M-cells was 35 +/- 2 microns2, whereas the total number was dependent on follicle size. The proportion of M-cells to absorptive-like enterocytes on follicle epithelium was 1:12. Latex particles were found easily on the surface of M-cells, and for the most part they were surrounded by microfolds. In only 10 min from the time of application, latex beads were concentrated or even included within macrophages of the dome of lymph follicles. The results indicate that primary insorption of small particles occurs in M-cells of Peyer's patches, and time of insorption is dependent on particle size.\r"

In the 1987 program, 73,508 fecal occult blood test (FOBT) kits were distributed free of charge, of which 63% were returned for analysis (57,000, 53%). Twenty-five percent of persons from the initial screening participated again in the 1987 program: 1,303 or 2.8% of persons had a positive screen (1,165, 3.9%). The predictive value of a positive screen was 23% for an adenomatous polyp and 8% for colorectal cancer (22%, 8%). Seventy-nine percent of the cancers detected were Dukes A or B or carcinoma in situ (78%). In order to promote a more thorough diagnostic work-up in positive screenes, a suggested diagnostic algorithm for the work-up of a positive FOBT was sent to participating physicians. Despite this, 35% of positive screenees had a diagnostic work-up limited to a repeat FOBT, and/or sigmoidoscopy only (32%). In conclusion, television-advertised mass screening programs consistently enroll large numbers of participants. The rate of compliance (percent of kits returned) and the limited diagnostic evaluation of persons with a positive screen appear to be the major factors limiting the success of our screening program.\r"

The present study was undertaken to determine the effectiveness of our immunoprophylaxis regimen (hepatitis B immune globulin at 36-72 h, hepatitis B vaccine at 36-72 h, 1 month and 6 months) in eliciting protective antibody to hepatitis B surface antigen (anti-HBs) in the infants of these women, the rate of perinatal transmission of HBV in this population prior to vaccination, the prevalence of anti-hepatitis delta antibody (anti-HD), and the prevalence of liver disease in our hepatitis B surface antigen-positive (HBsAg+) population. Four hundred eleven infants of HBsAg+ women were born during the 33-month study period. Of these, only 64 (15.6%) completed the vaccine series and returned for testing at 12 months. Sixty of the 64 had anti-HBs, and one (1.6%) had become HBsAg+. Eighty-nine older siblings of the immunized infants were tested, and 17 (19%) were HBsAg+. Of 54 mothers and eight siblings who were HBsAg+, none had anti-HD. Serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels were normal in 53 of 54 HBsAg+ mothers tested. These data demonstrate 1) reduction of perinatal transmission of HBV from 19% to 1.6% using our protocol, 2) absence of hepatitis delta infection in this population, and 3) high prevalence of asymptomatic carriage of HBV, rather than clinically significant liver disease, in this population. It is imperative to improve compliance in order to maximize the effectiveness of immunoprophylaxis for newborns of HBsAg+ mothers.\r"

The results were analyzed to determine the sensitivity, specificity, and overall accuracy of the histologic, cytologic, and of the two combined methods. Thirty-four patients had malignant liver disease (MLD), whereas 159 patients had no evidence of MLD. Malignant neoplasms were detected by cytology alone in five patients, by histology alone in 15 patients, and by both histologic and cytologic findings in six patients. Liver cancer was not diagnosed by both methods in eight patients. The sensitivity of the cytologic, histologic, and combined cytologic and histologic results for detecting malignancy were 32.4%, 61.8%, and 79.4%, respectively, whereas the specificity was 100% for all methods. The overall accuracy was 88.1%, 93.2%, and 95.5%, respectively. This study demonstrates that cytologic examination of the fluid obtained by liver needle biopsy (LNB) has a high specificity and low sensitivity that increased the diagnostic yield of histology alone for detecting MLD by 14.7%.\r"

  ".W": "Impressive progress has been made during the past several decades in understanding the pathogenesis of human genetic disease. The tools of molecular biology have allowed the isolation of many disease-related genes by forward and a few by reverse genetics, and the imminent completion of a complete human genetic linkage map will accelerate the genetic characterization of many more genetic diseases. The major impacts of the molecular characterization of human genetic diseases will be 1. To increase markedly the number of human diseases that we recognize to have major genetic components. We already understand that genetic diseases are not rare medical curiosities with negligible societal impact, but rather constitute a wide spectrum of both rare and extremely common diseases responsible for an immense amount of suffering in all human societies. The characterization of the human genome will lead to the identification of genetic factors in many more human diseases, even those that now seem too multifactorial or polygenic for ready understanding. 2. To allow the development of powerful new approaches to diagnosis, detection, screening and even therapy of these disorders aimed directly at the mutant genes rather than at the gene products. This should eventually allow much more accurate and specific management of human genetic disease and the genetic factors in many human maladies. The preparation of a fine-structure physical map of the entire human genome together with an overlapping contiguous set of clones spanning entire chromosomes or large portions of chromosomes is rapidly becoming feasible, and the information that will flow from this effort promises eventually to affect the management of many important genetic diseases.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

To address this issue, we studied transcription and translation of deleted mtDNA in two patients with KSS harboring two different deletions. We found that the deleted genomes were transcriptionally active in both cases. Analysis of translation in one of the patients showed that the \"fusion\" mRNA derived from the region spanning the deletion did not seem to be translated. Thus, the biochemical defects in KSS can be explained by a lack of translation of mtDNA-encoded respiratory-chain polypeptides in some mitochondria, which, in turn, is probably due to the lack of indispensable mtDNA-encoded tRNAs in these organelles. These results imply that deleted mtDNAs may be segregated from normal genomes in this group of diseases. It seems likely that the absence of translation in proliferating mitochondria containing partially deleted genomes plays a major role in the pathogenesis of these disorders.\r"

  ".W": "We have examined the population genetic consequences of the model of Laird (Genetics 117:587-599, 1987) in which the fragile-X syndrome is caused by \"imprinting\" of a mutant chromosome. The imprinting event in this model results from a block to reactivation of an inactive X chromosome prior to oogenesis. If it is assumed that males carrying the imprinted chromosome never reproduce, the frequencies of females and males carrying the imprinted chromosome are expected to be equal. When a mutation-selection balance is established, there are expected to be somewhat more than twice as many females carrying the nonimprinted fragile X as carry the imprinted fragile-X chromosome, the excess depending on the fertility of fragile-X females. Nonpenetrant (transmitting) males, i.e., those with the nonimprinted fragile-X chromosome, are expected to be present at about the same frequency as are males with the syndrome. More than one-third of the nonimprinted chromosomes in the population are expected to be newly arisen in each generation. We have considered possible alternatives to the model of a mutation-selection balance. Nonimprinted carrier females would need to have 100% fertility excess to avoid postulating a high mutation rate to account for the very high prevalence of the syndrome.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of mutation, migration, random drift, and selection on the change in frequency of the alleles associated with Huntington disease, porphyria variegata, and lipoid proteinosis have been assessed in the Afrikaner population of South Africa. Although admixture cannot be completely discounted, it was possible to exclude migration and new mutation as major sources of changes in the frequency of these alleles by limiting analyses to pedigrees descendant from founding families. Calculations which overestimated the possible effect of random drift demonstrated that drift did not account for the observed changes in gene frequencies. Therefore these changes must have been caused by natural selection, and a coefficient of selection was estimated for each trait. For the rare, dominant, deleterious allele associated with Huntington disease, the coefficient of selection was estimated to be .34, indicating that this allele has a selective disadvantage, contrary to some recent studies. For the presumed dominant and probably deleterious allele associated with porphyria variegata, the coefficient of selection lies between .07 and .02. The coefficient of selection for the rare, clinically recessive allele associated with lipoid proteinosis was estimated to be .07. Calculations based on a model system indicate that the observed decrease in allele frequency cannot be explained solely on the basis of selection against the homozygote. Thus, this may be an example of a pleiotropic gene which has a dominant effect in terms of selection even though its known clinical effect is recessive.\r"

  ".W": "Although recent data established that a specific very-long-chain fatty acyl-CoA synthetase is defective in X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD), the ALD gene is still unidentified. The ALD locus has been mapped to Xq28, like the red and green color pigment genes. Abnormal color vision has been observed in 12 of 27 patients with adrenomyeloneuropathy (AMN), a milder form of ALD. Furthermore, rearrangements of the color vision gene cluster were found in four of eight ALD kindreds. This led us to propose that a single DNA rearrangement could underlie both ALD and abnormal color vision in these patients. Study of 34 French ALD patients failed to reveal a higher than expected frequency of green/red visual pigment rearrangements 3' to the red/green color vision gene complex. The previous report of such rearrangements was based on small numbers and lack of knowledge that the frequency of \"abnormal\" color vision arrays on molecular analysis was twice as high as expected on the basis of the frequency of phenotypic color vision defects. The red/green color pigment (R/GCP) region was studied by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis in 14 of these patients, and we did not find any fragment size difference between the patients and normal individuals who have the same number of pigment genes. The R/GCP region was also analyzed in 29 French and seven North American ALD patients by using six genomic DNA probes, isolated from a cosmid walk, that flank the color vision genes. No deletions were found with probes that lie 3' of the green pigment genes. One of the eight previously reported ALD individuals has a long deletion 5' of the red pigment gene, a deletion causing blue cone monochromacy. This finding and the previous findings of a 45% frequency of phenotypic color vision defects in patients with AMN may suggest that the ALD/AMN gene lies 5' to the red pigment gene and that the frequent phenotypic color vision anomalies owe their origin to deleted DNA that includes regulatory genes for color vision. It is possible, however, that phenotypic color vision anomalies in AMN may be phenocopies secondary to retinal or neural involvement by the disease. The single case of blue cone monochromacy may therefore be a fortuitous coincidence of two diseases.\r"

The proband was initially detected because of hypertriglyceridemia and chylomicronemia. He was later demonstrated to have beta-VLDL despite an apo E3/E3 phenotype and the lack of stigmata of type III hyperlipoproteinemia. The proband had no HTGL activity in postheparin plasma. Two of his half-sisters had very low HTGL activity (39 and 31 nmol free fatty acids/min/ml; normal adult female greater than 44). His son and daughters had decreased HTGL activity (normal male and preadolescent female greater than 102), which would be expected in obligate heterozygotes for HTGL deficiency. Low HTGL activity was associated with LDL particles which were larger and more buoyant. Several family members, including the proband, had reduced LPL activity and mass less than that circumscribed by the 95% confidence-interval ellipse for normal subjects and had hyperlipidemia similar to that described in heterozygote relatives of patients with LPL deficiency. All the sibs with hyperlipidemia had a reduced LPL activity and mass, while subjects with isolated reduced HTGL (with normal LPL activity) had normal lipid phenotypes. Analysis of genomic DNA from these subjects by restriction-enzyme digestion revealed no major abnormalities in the structure of either the HTGL or the LPL gene. Compound heterozygotes for HTGL and LPL deficiency show lipoprotein physiological characteristics typical for HTGL deficiency, while their variable lipid phenotype is typical for LPL deficiency.\r"

Using data from the Atlanta Birth Defects Case-Control study, we evaluated sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive value of mothers' responses regarding the presence of birth defects in their offspring. A total of 4929 mothers of infants with major structural defects ascertained by the Metropolitan Atlanta Congenital Defects Program and a total of 3,029 mothers of normal infants were asked whether their babies had had a birth defect or a health problem diagnosed during the first year of life. Interviewers and coders of maternal responses were blinded to the case-control status of infants. Sensitivity (the proportion of case mothers who gave responses that could be coded as denoting a major birth defect) was 61%. Specificity (the proportion of control mothers who gave responses that could not be coded as denoting a major birth defect) was 98%. The positive predictive value (the proportion of mothers who gave a major-birth-defect response who in fact had babies with major birth defects) was estimated as 47%. Sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive value varied by maternal sociodemographic factors such as race and education, as well as by type of defect. These results suggest that family history data obtained through maternal interviews should be cautiously interpreted and, if not properly validated, may alter estimates of recurrence risks.\r"

VWS is a well-characterized example of a single-gene abnormality that disturbs normal craniofacial morphogenesis. As a first step in identifying genes involved in human development, we used a candidate-gene-and-region approach to look for a linkage to VWS. Six families with 3 or more generations of affected individuals were studied. Evidence for linkage (theta = 0.02, lod score = 9.09) was found between the renin (REN) gene on 1q and VWS. Other linked loci included CR1, D1S58, and D1S53. The genes for laminin B2 (LAMB2), a basement-membrane protein, and for decay-accelerating factor (DAF) were studied as possible candidate genes on 1q. Recombinants between VWS and both LAMB2 and DAF excluded these genes from a causal role in the etiology of VWS for the families studied in this report. Multipoint linkage analysis indicated that the VWS locus was flanked by REN and D1S65 at a lod score of 10.83. This tight linkage with renin and other nearby loci provides a first step in identifying the molecular abnormality underlying this disturbance of human development.\r"

Transcriptional start sites of the CKMM and DNA-repair genes are all on the telomeric side of the genes. Our results provide a framework for the construction of a larger physical map of the area, which will facilitate the search for the DM gene.\r"

  ".W": "The aim of this investigation is to examine the distribution of the Ag immunological polymorphism in human populations on a worldwide scale and to look for possible explanations of this distribution in the field of modern human peopling history and Ag-system evolution. Extensive Ag-antigene typings were carried out on 13 human population samples, including sub-Saharan African, European, west and east Asiatic, Melanesian, Australian aborigine, and Amerindian groups. Complete Ag-haplotype frequencies were estimated by maximum-likelihood-score procedures, and the data were analyzed by genetic distance computations and principal coordinate projections. With the exception of the Amerindian sample, the Ag polymorphism is shown to be highly polymorphic in all the populations tested. Their genetic relationships appear to be closely correlated to their geographical distribution. This suggests that the Ag system has evolved as a neutral or nearly neutral polymorphism and that it is highly informative for modern human peopling history studies. From the worldwide Ag haplotypic distributions, a model for the Ag molecular structure is derived. According to this model and to the most recent results obtained from molecular data, the establishment of the Ag polymorphism could be explained by several mutations and recombination events between the haplotypes most frequently found in human populations today. As a conclusion, genetic and paleontological data suggest that the genetic structure of caucasoid populations (located from North Africa to India) may be the least differentiated from an ancestral genetic stock. Worldwide genetic differentiations are properly explained as the results of westward and eastward human migrations from a Near East-centered but undefined geographical area where modern humans may have originated. The importance of Ag polymorphism analyses for the reconstruction of human settlement history and origins is discussed in the light of the main conclusions of the most recent genetic polymorphism studies.\r"

Varying amounts of denatured DNA from a normal control, a trisomy 21 patient, and the subject to be analyzed were loaded on the same membrane. Successive hybridizations with reference probes and chromosome 21 probes were then carried out. Intensities of the signals on autoradiograms were quantified by densitometric scanning. Graphic and statistical analysis of the linear regressions between reference and chromosome 21 probe signals were performed, and the conclusion that the DNA from the studied subject had two or three copies for a given chromosome 21 sequence was assessed by statistical comparison of the slopes. As a test for the validation of this method, 10 coded blood DNAs from five normal controls and from five trisomy 21 patients were analyzed, by using two reference (COL1A1 and COL1A2) and two chromosome 21 (D21S11 and D21S17) probes. Among the 10 DNAs analyzed, it was possible to diagnose, with 100% accuracy, normal controls and trisomic 21 individuals.

The streptavidine-horseradish-peroxidase and DAB detection system used permitted the unequivocal identification of sperm heads with zero, one, or two hybridization signals and proved superior to either quinacrine staining or radioactive in situ hybridization. The low incidence of 0.27% of sperm nuclei with two Y chromosomes that was found is similar to the frequency of XYY males among newborns. The average proportions of X- and Y-bearing sperm nuclei were 50.3% and 49.4%, respectively, corresponding to the expected 1:1 ratio. The Y heterochromatin was located in the central part of the nucleus in 58% of the Y-carrying sperm cells.\r"

  ".W": "Profilin is a conserved actin-monomer-binding protein which is found in all eukaryotes, including yeast. Although amino acid sequence analysis and RNase protection analysis suggest a single profilin isoform in mammalian cells, Southern blot analysis of human and somatic cell hybrid DNA indicates several loci in the human genome which hybridize with the profilin cDNA. We therefore isolated human genomic clones to analyze these genetic loci in detail. Only one of the cloned loci has typical features of a functional gene, including upstream transcriptional elements and typical exon-intron structure. Four other isolated loci are all diverged, intronless pseudogenes and are likely to be nonfunctional. The functional gene was localized to human chromosome band 17p13 by analysis of somatic cell hybrids and by in situ chromosomal localization. The Miller-Dieker syndrome (MDS), a rare congenital disorder manifested by characteristic facial abnormalities and lissencephaly (smooth brain), is associated with microdeletions of the distal 17p region. RFLP analysis of a patient with MDS, and analysis of somatic cell hybrids containing partially deleted chromosomes 17 from patients with MDS, using the profilin gene probe, indicate that profilin is localized to chromosome subband 17p13.3. These results also indicate that profilin is the first identified cloned gene which is part of the genetic material deleted in some patients with MDS but that other patients have smaller deletions not affecting the profilin locus. Thus, single allelic deletion of the profilin locus may contribute to the clinical phenotype of the MDS in some patients but does not play a major role in the essential phenotype.\r"

To test this hypothesis, complex segregation analysis was performed on data on 487 probands and their families. Demographic information on probands and the recurrence risk to relatives of probands are presented. An increased sex ratio (3.9 male:female) and an elevated risk to sibs (4%), as compared with the population incidence (0.02%), are observed, with the sex ratio decreasing and the recurrence risk to sibs increasing as the aganglionosis becomes more extensive. Down syndrome was found at an increased frequency among affected individuals but not among their unaffected sibs, and the increase was not associated with maternal age. Complex segregation analysis was performed on these family data. The families were classified into separate categories by extent of aganglionosis. For cases with aganglionosis beyond the sigmoid colon, the mode of inheritance is compatible with a dominant gene with incomplete penetrance, while for cases with aganglionosis extending no farther than the sigmoid colon, the inheritance pattern is equally likely to be either multifactorial or due to a recessive gene with very low penetrance. A model of gene action with random effects during morphogenesis is compatible with our observations.\r"

Ideally this subset should include much of the linkage information in the sample but include only a fraction of the pedigrees. We previously described a strategy for selecting pedigrees for linkage analysis of a quantitative trait on the basis of a pedigree likelihood-ratio statistic. For quantitative traits controlled by a major locus with a rare dominant allele, the likelihood-ratio strategy extracted nearly all the information for linkage while typically requiring marker data on only about one-third of the pedigrees. Here, we describe a new strategy to select pedigrees for linkage analysis on the basis of the expected number of potentially informative meioses in each pedigree. We demonstrate that this informative-meioses strategy provides an efficient and more general means to select pedigrees for a linkage study of a quantitative trait.\r"

The mutation was also detected in the father's sperm, demonstrating that mosaicism in the father's germ line explains recurrence. The presence of both germ-line and somatic mosaicism indicates that the mutation occurred prior to segregation of the germ-line and somatic cell progenitors. About one in eight sperm carry the mutation, which implies that at least four progenitor cells populate the germ line in human males. The observation that the mosaic individual is clinically normal suggests that genetic diseases can have both qualitative and quantitative components.\r"

  ".W": "Mnichinan, a variant of alpha 1-antitrypsin (alpha 1-AT) was detected in a Japanese individual with serum alpha 1-AT deficiency (18 mg/dl), associated with aggregated alpha 1-AT molecules in the hepatocytes. Cloning and sequencing of the 10,627-bp-long region containing the Mnichinan gene and the normal M1(Val213) alpha 1-AT gene revealed all five exons of the Mnichinan gene to be identical with the M1(Val213) alpha 1-AT gene, except for two changes: a TTC trinucleotide deletion in the codon for amino acid Phe52 and a G-A substitution, by which the normal Gly148 (GGG) became Arg148 (AGG). Dot blot analysis of the polymerase chain-reaction-amplified DNA derived from the proband and other family members showed both mutations to be associated with an alpha 1-AT deficiency phenotype. Ninety-eight alpha 1-AT alleles were all negative for both changes. Comparison of the region, except for five exons between the Mnichinan and M1(Val213) genes, demonstrated one base difference in the 5' flanking region and 14 base changes in the introns. All exon-intron junctions were identical, and base changes in the 5' flanking region did not seem significant. The G-A substitution in codon 148 of the Mnichinan gene could not be responsible for the alpha 1-AT deficiency phenotype because Arg- and not Gly- was located at the corresponding position of the protein C inhibitor belonging to the serine protease inhibitor superfamily. The deletion of Phe52 may cause the newly synthesized alpha 1-AT protein to aggregate, resulting in alpha 1-AT deficiency. Comparison of the alpha 1-AT gene sequences available indicated that the C-T substitution at the CpG dinucleotide has an important role in generation of variants and nucleotide changes in the noncoding regions of the alpha 1-AT gene.\r"

In addition, the Asian-specific deletion between the cytochrome c oxidase subunit II (COII) and tRNA(Lys) genes was also prevalent in both the Pima and the Maya. These data suggest that Amerindian mtDNAs derived from at least four primary maternal lineages, that new tribal-specific variants accumulated as these mtDNAs became distributed throughout the Americas, and that some genetic variation may have been lost when the progenitors of the Ticuna separated from the North and Central American populations.\r"

  ".U": "90178098\r", 
  ".W": "Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2A (MEN2A) is a rare cancer syndrome that is inherited in an apparently autosomal dominant fashion. Previous linkage studies had assigned the MEN2A locus to chromosome 10 in the pericentromeric region. We recently have described several new easily scorable RFLPs for the chromosome 10-specific alpha satellite DNA (the D10Z1) locus that is known, on the basis of previous in situ hybridization experiments, to lie at the centromere. We report here tight linkage between MEN2A and D10Z1, as demonstrated by a maximum lod score of 12.02 at the recombination frequency of zero (1-lod-unit support interval 0-4 cM), indicating that the genetic defect in MEN2A lies in the immediate vicinity of the centromere. By means of a set of ordered polymorphic DNA markers from the pericentromeric region, multipoint as well as pairwise linkage analyses place the MEN2A locus at the middle of a small region (approximately 11 cM) bracketing the centromere with FNRB (at 10p11.2) and RBP3 (at 10q11.2) on either side, providing further support for the centromeric location of the MEN2A locus. Marked sex difference in recombination frequencies exists in this pericentromeric region: significantly (P less than .01) more female than male crossovers were observed across all of the adjacent intervals D10S24-FNRB, FNRB-D10Z1, and D10Z1-RBP3. However, a sex difference was not seen in the 7-cM interval from RBP3 to D10S5, suggesting that large variation in the sex difference in recombination can occur over small chromosomal regions.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Salt sensitivity of blood pressure responses is compared to vascular reactivity to infused angiotensin II on the two sodium diets. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We studied 19 patients with NIDDM (seven normotensive, 12 hypertensive) and seven nondiabetic control subjects under metabolic balance after 6 days on a constant low- (20 mEq) sodium diet and again after 6 days on a high- (250 mEq) sodium diet. Salt sensitivity of blood pressure was determined by the increment in integrated 24-hour blood pressure values on changing from the low- to the high-sodium diet. Blood pressure and plasma aldosterone responses to a graded-dose infusion of angiotensin II were also examined on both sodium diets. RESULTS: Eight of 12 hypertensive patients with NIDDM displayed salt-sensitive blood pressure responses, whereas none of the normotensive patients with NIDDM or control subjects were salt-sensitive. Patients with NIDDM also had augmented blood pressure responses to infused angiotensin II on both sodium diets when compared to control subjects. Whereas controls had reduced vascular responses to angiotensin II on the low-sodium diet, these responses were not decreased in patients with NIDDM. Patients with NIDDM also retained more sodium on the high-sodium diet than did the control subjects. CONCLUSION: Hypertension in patients with NIDDM is frequently salt-sensitive, which may be due to sodium retention and enhanced vascular reactivity to angiotensin II. Since sodium restriction does not normally reduce vascular reactivity to angiotensin II in NIDDM, salt-restricted diets may be less effective in blood pressure control in hypertensive NIDDM.\r"

  ".W": "PURPOSE AND METHODS: To ascertain the relative prevalence of abnormalities of coronary flow reserve and esophageal function in patients with chest pain despite angiographically normal coronary arteries, 87 patients underwent invasive study of coronary flow reserve and, during the same week, esophageal testing. RESULTS: Sixty-three of the 87 patients (72%) demonstrated abnormalities of coronary flow reserve, as evidenced by an increase in coronary resistance during the stress of rapid atrial pacing after administration of ergonovine 0.15 mg intravenously (1.33 +/- 0.36 mm Hg.minute/mL), compared with pacing at the same heart rate before ergonovine administration (1.10 +/- 0.33 mm Hg.minute/mL). This higher coronary vascular resistance occurred in the absence of significant epicardial coronary artery luminal narrowing. Fifty-seven of these 63 patients (90%) with a coronary vasoconstrictor response to ergonovine described their typical chest pain during pacing stress, compared with only six of 24 patients (25%) who demonstrated no coronary flow abnormality (p less than 0.001). After administration of dipyridamole 0.5 to 0.75 mg/kg intravenously to 65 patients, the 48 patients with ergonovine-induced vasoconstriction had a significantly higher minimum coronary resistance, compared with the 17 patients without a coronary vasoconstrictor response to ergonovine (0.65 +/- 0.21 versus 0.47 +/- 0.13 mm Hg.minute/mL, p less than 0.03). Twenty of 87 patients (23%) had abnormal esophageal motility [nutcracker esophagus (11), nonspecific motility disorder (seven), and diffuse esophageal spasm (two)], including 16 of the 63 patients (25%) with abnormal coronary flow reserve. Twenty-four (28%) patients experienced their typical chest pain during motility testing, but only five of these patients met criteria for abnormal esophageal motility. Nine of 75 patients tested (12%) had their typical chest pain during Bernstein testing, and 18 of 38 patients (47%) tested had their typical chest pain provoked by intraesophageal balloon distention. CONCLUSIONS: Seventy-one of 87 patients (82%) with anginal-like chest pain and normal epicardial vessels in our series had a disorder of either coronary flow reserve, esophageal motility, and/or reproduction of typical chest pain during acid infusion. Of interest, chest pain was commonly encountered during cardiac and esophageal testing (85% of patients), regardless of the ability to demonstrate an abnormality of coronary flow reserve or abnormal esophageal function. This suggests that pain experienced by these patients may be a consequence of myocardial ischemia, esophageal dysfunction, abnormal visceral nociception, or a combination of any or all of these entities.\r"

Previous work has suggested that the characteristics of the fluid may change into those of an exudate with diuresis. The purpose of the present study was to determine whether aggressive diuresis does result in this change in pleural fluid characteristics. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twelve patients with severe congestive heart failure (ejection fraction 23.9 +/- 9.6%) and pleural effusions were studied serially as they underwent diuresis. After an initial thoracentesis was performed, the patients then underwent aggressive diuresis for 12 to 48 hours with one or two follow-up thoracentesis. RESULTS: The mean weight loss during the study period was 4.5 +/- 2.8 kg. With diuresis the LDH level, LDH ratio, protein level, and protein ratio all increased significantly (p less than 0.05). All 12 patients had transudative pleural effusions at the onset of diuresis. However, despite the increases in the levels of protein and LDH with diuresis, only one patient's pleural fluid attained values compatible with an exudate. CONCLUSION: From this study we conclude that it is uncommon for a transudative pleural effusion due to congestive heart failure to develop the characteristics of an exudative pleural effusion with rapid diuresis.\r"

PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study population included five patients with end-stage renal disease and systemic calciphylaxis undergoing hemodialysis, 12 patients without evidence of calciphylaxis undergoing dialysis, eight patients with nephrotic syndrome, and eight normal healthy volunteers. Protein C antigen levels were measured by rocket immunoelectrophoresis, and functional activity was quantitated by a chromogenic assay and an anticoagulant assay utilizing the venom of Agkistrodon contortrix. RESULTS: Skin biopsy specimens of involved areas in three patients showed thrombotic occlusion of venules identical to that seen in warfarin-induced skin necrosis. Protein C antigen levels were normal in all groups. However, protein C activity was significantly reduced as measured by chromogenic (p less than 0.01) or anticoagulant assays (p less than 0.01) in patients with calciphylaxis compared with the other three groups. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that hypercoagulability due to functional protein C deficiency may contribute to thrombosis, resulting in skin necrosis and digital gangrene in systemic calciphylaxis.\r"

PATIENTS AND METHODS: On the second day of admission to a medical intensive care unit, 20 consecutive patients with the major diagnosis of acute respiratory failure underwent TSH measurements at 8 A.M., 9 P.M., 11 P.M., and 1 A.M., with two sensitive assays. RESULTS: Six patients died, five of whom had hypothyroxinemia (thyroxine [T4] less than 5.5 micrograms/dL) (83%) on the day of the study, whereas only three of the 14 survivors had low T4 (21%; p less than 0.05). Baseline 8 A.M. TSH measured with the two assays was similar in both groups and there was a progressive increase in TSH in survivors and a decrease in nonsurvivors at 9 P.M. and 11 P.M. However, the difference at these time points was not statistically significant. At 1 A.M., TSH levels were significantly lower among nonsurvivors (0.75 +/- 0.34 microU/mL with assay 1, and 0.7 +/- 0.4 microU/mL with assay 2) than in survivors (2.3 +/- 0.46 microU/mL with assay 1, and 2 +/- 0.5 microU/mL with assay 2; p less than 0.005; Wilcoxon test). Five of the nonsurvivors and none of the survivors had a suppressed 1 A.M. TSH level (p less than 0.001), suggesting a good correlation between suppressed 1 A.M. TSH and mortality. After exclusion of patients receiving drugs known to affect TSH levels (two nonsurvivors and four survivors), the same dissociation in TSH changes was observed, and significantly lower 1 A.M. TSH levels were observed in nonsurvivors than in survivors (0.13 +/- 0.08 microU/mL versus 2.7 +/- 0.6 microU/mL with assay 1; p less than 0.01). Cortisol levels were significantly higher only at 8 A.M. in nonsurvivors whether patients receiving drugs were included in the analysis (41.6 +/- 3.2 versus 28.4 +/- 2.7 micrograms/dL; p less than 0.01) or not (45.3 +/- 4.6 versus 30.5 +/- 3.6 micrograms/dL; p less than 0.01). At other times, cortisol levels were similar in both groups. The 24-hour TSH areas under the curve were also lower in nonsurvivors than in survivors whether patients receiving drugs known to affect TSH levels were included or not. However, cortisol areas under the curve were similar in both groups. CONCLUSION: It is concluded that fatal illness is associated with a suppression of the late night TSH surge.\r"

Many junior faculty are overburdened with clinical demands and do not have a well-focused research agenda. Such situations will hinder the full development of many talented young persons. In order to optimize chances for success, young faculty should clearly define their goals, carefully negotiate the terms of their employment, practice sound principles of time management, identify a mentor, and develop a focused research agenda.\r"

A review of the literature indicates a definite need for a uniform definition, diagnosis, and management of this syndrome. Patients manifesting this syndrome usually are seen before term (less than 36 weeks' gestation) complaining of malaise (90%), epigastric or right upper-quadrant pain (90%), and nausea or vomiting (50%), and some will have nonspecific viral-syndrome-like symptoms. Hypertension and proteinuria may be absent or slight. Thus some of these patients may have a variety of signs and symptoms, none of which are diagnostic of classic preeclampsia. In consideration of the high maternal and perinatal mortality and morbidity reported with the presence of this syndrome, I recommend that all pregnant women having any of these symptoms should have a complete blood cell count with platelet and liver enzyme determinations irrespective of maternal blood pressure.\r"

Low-risk cesarean section was defined as a scheduled procedure without an urgent indication, with any duration of ruptured membranes being less than or equal to 12 hours. In a cohort of 1863 patients, 26 (1.4%) developed endometritis and 21 (1.1%) had wound infections. Primary cesarean section was associated with endometritis in the cohort (p less than 0.01) and in a retrospective study with the same cases as in the cohort (p = 0.01). Absence of antibiotic prophylaxis was associated with endometritis (p less than or equal to 0.013) or endometritis with wound infection (p less than 0.01) in both studies. Without prophylaxis 37 such infections occurred in 957 (3.7%) women; with prophylaxis eight infections occurred in 906 (0.9%) women. Routine timely antibiotic prophylaxis in low-risk cesarean sections could lead to an annual national savings of approximately $9 million.\r"

There was no significant difference between the degree of adhesions in the treated group and in the nontreated group.

This fibronectin variant is concentrated in the endothelium of blood vessels and has been shown to be released at sites of vascular injury. In addition, total circulating fibronectin levels, composed primarily of hepatic-derived fibronectin lacking the extra type III domain, were also determined. Significant elevations in the average circulating concentrations of fibronectin with an extra type III domain (5.5 micrograms/ml [95% confidence interval, 4.7,6.2] versus 3.2 micrograms/ml [95% confidence interval, 2.9,3.5]; p = 0.0001) as well as total fibronectin (387 micrograms/ml [95% confidence interval, 357,417] versus 327 micrograms/ml [95% confidence interval, 305,348]; p = 0.036) were observed in preeclamptic versus control patients. Significant elevations in fibronectin levels with an extra type III domain occurred in the first trimester before clinical evidence of preeclampsia. In addition, multivariate logistic regression demonstrated a 5.4-fold increase in the risk of preeclampsia with each 1 microgram/ml elevation in concentration of fibronectin with an extra type III domain. These findings lend support to the hypothesis that endothelial-vascular injury is a primary event in the genesis of preeclampsia.\r"

The presence of increased proteinuria (greater than 0.3 gm/L) predicted an adverse pregnancy outcome. Furthermore, the majority of small-for-gestational-age infants occurred in the group with proteinuric preeclampsia (52%), whereas the rate of small-for-gestational-age infants was 18% and 12% in the group with nonproteinuric gestational hypertension and chronic hypertension, respectively.

  ".W": "Neonatal intensive care unit survivors (N = 494) from 10 tertiary care centers were evaluated over the first 4 to 5 years of life to determine the relative contributions of birth weight and sociodemographic factors to mental development. Six sociodemographic factors were studied: sex, race, family income, and mother's marital status, age, and educational level; the last five factors also are known to be associated with premature birth. Mental development was measured with the Bayley Scales of Infant Development (12 to 24 months) and the Stanford Binet Intelligence Test (4 to 5 years). Each factor's influence was assessed by multivariate analysis. Birth weight had limited long-term implications; at 4 to 5 years, only infants with birth weights less than 1000 gm had significantly lower scores than those in other birth weight categories. Sociodemographic variables had a greater impact on mental development, with age-dependent differences found between nonwhite and white children and between children with mothers of low, medium, and high educational levels.\r"

However, many intrapartum asphyxial episodes are not identified on the basis of clinical observations. Consistent diagnosis of intrapartum asphyxia in the preterm fetus requires routine umbilical cord blood gas and acid-base assessment at delivery.\r"

Abortion occurred in all patients; in 95 it was complete, in four it was incomplete, and one resulted in a missed abortion. In 88% the abortion occurred within 4 hours of prostaglandin treatment. A total of 25% of patients had nausea and 15% vomited after RU 38,486 treatment. After prostaglandin-treatment, 13% vomited, 10% had diarrhea, and 23% required administration of an opiate analgesic agent. No patient was transfused and there was no genital tract trauma; one case of suspected pelvic infection occurred. If the need for termination arose again, 88% would elect to use the method again, 9% would not. The combination of the antiprogestin RU 38,486 and a vaginal prostaglandin pessary appears to offer a safe, efficient, acceptable nonsurgical outpatient method of termination. Further studies on dosage and treatment protocols would be justified.\r"

Each of the individual abnormal histologic subtypes exhibited a survival of less than 50%. At the time of surgical staging, 62% of patients with unfavorable histologic subtypes had extrauterine spread of disease. Despite liberal utilization of postoperative adjuvant therapy in 42 of the 52 patients (81%), only 10% of these patients survived 5 years. Fifty-five percent had a component of recurrence outside of the abdominal/pelvic cavity. Subsequent treatment considerations should incorporate regimens addressing systemic and local tissue control.\r"

Recurrent disease developed in 13 patients. All of those who had pelvic (1), abdominal (4), or pulmonary (2) metastases had elevated serum CA 125 levels. None of the six patients with isolated vaginal recurrences had elevated CA 125 levels. Four patients had small bowel obstruction as a result of postoperative pelvic radiation, and all had elevated CA 125 levels during these episodes, although no evidence of recurrent disease was found during exploratory laparotomy for intestinal bypass. Serum CA 125 levels may have a role in the posttreatment surveillance of patients with early-stage endometrial carcinoma, but may be falsely elevated in the presence of severe radiation injury and at a normal level in the presence of isolated vaginal metastases.\r"

With constant infusion of 50 micrograms/minute, steady state ritodrine concentrations reached 28 +/- 11 ng/ml (SD) with a range of 15 to 45 ng/ml. This wide variation is a result of differences in plasma clearance, which ranged from 1.0 to 3.3 L/min, mean 1.94 +/- 0.71 L/min. The apparent volume of distribution was 6.95 +/- 3.54 L/kg, indicating that ritodrine is extensively bound to extravascular tissue. When an infusion of ritodrine is stopped, plasma concentrations fall rapidly initially with a distribution half-life of 5.9 +/- 6.0 minutes. After the initial rapid fall, plasma concentrations decrease more slowly with a mean disposition half-life of 156 +/- 51 minutes. On the basis of the pharmacokinetic parameters defined, we recommend that the current infusion regimen for ritodrine be changed. The infusion rate of ritodrine should start at 50 micrograms/minute rather than 100 micrograms/minute. The maximal infusion rate of 350 micrograms/minute should be increased and once labor is inhibited, the infusion rate should be reduced.\r"

An additional 10 women meeting the same criteria served as a comparison group by taking calcium only. During 12 months of therapy, continuous users had significantly less vaginal bleeding and spotting than did sequential users. As compared with baseline values, bone metabolism and computerized tomographic measurements of vertebral trabecular bone density at month 12 indicated reduced bone turnover and increased density in hormone users. Endometrial biopsy specimens were negative for hyperplasia and neoplasia. The continuous ethinyl estradiol-norethindrone acetate tablet, even at the lowest doses studied, provided the same salutary effects on bone, endometrium, and postmenopausal symptoms as sequential therapy while minimizing annoying vaginal bleeding and spotting.\r"

In seven patients obstetric intervention took place on the basis of the domiciliary fetal monitoring recording and subsequent hospital monitoring. There were no intrauterine or neonatal deaths, and there was no overall increase in obstetric operative intervention. There appeared to be a significant reduction in the inconvenience suffered by the patient and her family, compared with conventional monitoring. Fetal heart recordings performed solely by the patient were of a high quality and reduced the demand on midwifery resources. To allow this only 3 hours of midwifery time daily was required and no additional demands on obstetric staff were made. It is anticipated that domiciliary fetal monitoring, performed by patients, will become an essential and established service throughout the United Kingdom (and probably Europe) as the principal means of monitoring fetal well-being.\r"

Eight women in the study group were delivered of infants within 48 hours, as compared with none in the control group (p less than 0.0001). The mean time until the appearance of regular uterine contractions in the study group (4.15 +/- 1.76 hours) was significantly shorter (p less than 0.001) than that in the control group (56.13 +/- 5.28 hours). Patients who were not delivered of infants within 48 hours received other medications (prostaglandin E2, oxytocin). The mean maternal blood level of disopyramide at the time of appearance of uterine contractions was 1.52 +/- 0.9 mg/ml. The mean maternal level at delivery was 0.93 +/- 0.43 mg/ml and the cord blood level at the time of delivery was 0.33 mg/ml (cord blood/maternal level ratio = 0.36, r = 0.73, p less than 0.05). These results indicate that disopyramide should not be used in pregnancy for antiarrhythmic purposes because it may induce uterine contractions and delivery.\r"

In addition to the expected increase in both painless and painful uterine contractions, several symptoms have been commonly cited in textbooks and patient educational materials as preceding preterm labor including menstrual-like cramps, backache, pelvic pressure, and an increased amount of vaginal discharge. We interviewed 107 women with preterm labor, 102 women with preterm prematurely ruptured membranes, and 106 ambulatory normal pregnant women to ascertain the frequency of each of eight putative warning symptoms of preterm labor in each group. Preterm labor patients were distinguished as expected from both normal women and amniorrhexis patients by a greater frequency of painful and painless contractions. Menstrual cramps, backache, and increased vaginal discharge, symptoms often said to be normally present in pregnancy, were also significantly more common in preterm labor patients than in women with preterm membrane rupture and in normal subjects.\r"

  ".W": "Macrosomia (birth weight greater than 4000 gm) is associated with a wide variety of adverse intrapartum and perinatal outcomes. To evaluate the effect of pregravid obesity on infant birth weight, we examined data from a low-income population of women (n = 127,879). The population was divided into five groups on the basis of pregravid body mass index (weight/height) designated by the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey II reference population (less than 25th percentile, 25th to less than 75th percentile, 75th to less than 85th percentile, 85th to less than 95th percentile, and greater than or equal to 95th percentile). The prevalence of infant macrosomia ranged from 5% for the lowest group to 17% for the highest group. With the use of the second group (25th to less than 75th percentile) as a reference, odds ratios (adjusted for maternal age, smoking status, race, height, parity, gestational age, and infant sex) for macrosomia for the five sequential weight groups were 0.6, 1.0, 1.3, 1.6 and 2.2. We conclude that pregravid overweight had a significant independent effect on birth weight outcome.\r"

There were no incorrect sex predictions and no diagnostic errors involving trisomies 21, 18, or 13, sex chromosome aneuploidies, or structural abnormalities. There were no cases of normal cytogenetic diagnosis followed by birth of a cytogenetically abnormal infant. Three cases of unusual aneuploidies (tetraploidy, trisomy 16, and trisomy 22) detected by the direct method only were not confirmed by cytogenetic follow-up. Mosaic cytogenetic abnormalities were observed in 0.83% of all cases in which chorionic villus sampling was done but were confirmed by amniocentesis or in fetal tissues in only 7 of 30 cases (23.3%). Maternal cell contamination occurred in 1.9% of long-term cultures, although this did not present any cytogenetic diagnostic difficulties. Overall, a very high degree of laboratory success and diagnostic accuracy was observed with either cytogenetic method, although fewer predictive errors were observed with the long-term culture method and none were observed when both methods were used.\r"

Villitis areas were filled with activated (HLA-DR, HLA-DP, and HLA-DQ reactive) macrophages. B lymphocytes were not identified, and T lymphocytes were of the helper (CD4) phenotype. Antibodies to coagulation components revealed perivascular and trophoblastic basement membrane deposits of factor IX, increased numbers of platelets, and fetal stem vessels that did not react with endothelial markers. These findings suggest helper T lymphocytes activate macrophages that mediate coagulation activation and alter endothelium. This combination of immunologic events results in tissue changes that are histologically diagnosed as villitis. It is not known what triggers these immunologic events, but the finding of villitis in normal placentas suggests the causative factor(s) is present in all pregnancies.\r"

  ".W": "The ether phospholipid PAF (1-alkyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine) was originally described as a potent bioactive lipid associated with inflammatory responses. More recently, we have suggested a functional role for PAF in fetal lung maturation and the initiation of parturition. Previously, PAF was detected in the amniotic fluid of women at term during labor. A significant proportion of this PAF was associated with a lamellar body-enriched fraction. In addition, the PAF concentration was elevated in fetal rabbit lung during the latter stages of gestation and in human fetal lung in organ culture. It was therefore concluded that the PAF present in amniotic fluid during labor was, in part, of fetal lung origin. In the reported study, amniotic fluid samples were obtained from a group of patients with uncomplicated pregnancies at term \"not in labor\" and \"in labor\" and a group with complicated pregnancies. We found an eightfold greater concentration of PAF in amniotic fluid obtained from the \"term, in labor\" samples compared with that of the \"term, not in labor\" samples (40 vs. 312 fmol/ml). A twentyfold elevation in PAF (838 fmol/ml) was evident in the amniotic fluid of patients incurring \"preterm labor\" with an average gestational age of 32 weeks compared with the \"term, not in labor\" group. PAF concentrations also were elevated to 756 fmol/ml amniotic fluid in a group of patients with an average gestational age of 31.5 weeks who had premature rupture of membranes. We have previously suggested that a second autacoid, PAF, in addition to eicosanoids, may function in the initiation of parturition at term in uncomplicated pregnancies. On the basis of our findings of a severalfold increase in the PAF concentration in amniotic fluid from complicated pregnancies, it is suggested that this potent activator of myometrial contraction, together with the eicosanoids, may be a contributing factor associated with premature labor.\r"

The examinations were done on the first day of stimulation (day 3 of the menstrual cycle, mean serum estradiol concentration 0.2 nmol/L), and the day before oocyte aspiration (day 10 to 12, mean serum estradiol concentration 6.8 nmol/L). Interstitial colloid osmotic pressure was measured on the thorax at heart level by the \"wick\" method, and interstitial hydrostatic pressure by the \"wick-in-needle\" method. Plasma colloid osmotic pressure decreased (mean, 2.0 mm Hg; p less than 0.002) and interstitial colloid osmotic pressure increased (mean, 1.0 mm Hg; p less than 0.02) during hormonal stimulation. This implies a reduced transcapillary colloid osmotic gradient (plasma colloid osmotic pressure--interstitial colloid osmotic pressure), probably because of increased capillary permeability to plasma proteins. Hemoglobin and hematocrit were significantly reduced, and body weight and foot volume significantly increased. These results demonstrate that during ovarian stimulation there are both water retention and augmented filtration of fluid from the vascular to the interstitial compartment. This may be of significance for the pathophysiologic condition in the ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome.\r"

Hypoxemia was accomplished by tracheal infusion of nitrogen and did not result in significant changes in fetal arterial pH and PCO2. Fetal arterial blood gases and pH were continuously measured with an extracorporeal flow-through cuvette. Nuchal muscle activity was measured by electromyography and was expressed as the percentage of time spent moving. A decrease in fetal arterial oxygen saturation to three fourths of the initial value for 2 hours was not associated with significant changes in nuchal muscle activity. When fetal arterial oxygen saturation was further reduced for 2 hours to one half, fetal nuchal muscle activity fell significantly from 34.6% +/- 10.5% during normoxemia to 20.9% +/- 13.9% during hypoxemia. However, the most pronounced changes in fetal nuchal muscle activity occurred in the first 15 minutes after the changes in arterial oxygen saturation. A considerable transient increase in nuchal muscle activity was observed during the first 15 minutes after recovery from hypoxemia. During hypoxemia there was a relative predominance of short-lasting (less than 3 minute) movements.\r"

After photocoagulation, the retina reattached in 11 eyes (85%), and the visual acuity improved in eight eyes (62%), returning to 20/25 or better in six eyes (46%). Twelve of the tumors (92%) that received surface photocoagulation grew after treatment. Seven of these tumors (54%) developed a collar-button configuration and showed evidence of basal expansion. Of the nine tumors that did not receive surface photocoagulation, seven (78%) eventually grew, but none developed a collar-button configuration. Surface photocoagulation applied to a growing melanoma appears to increase the likelihood of tumor extension through Bruch's membrane in a collar-button configuration. The impact of such growth on tumor metastasis is unknown.\r"

The number of foveal photoreceptors and retinal pigment epithelial cells, the presence of macular pigment, and lipofuscin fluorescence were assessed. Pathologic characteristics typical of age-related macular degeneration occurred in nine of the 90- to 101-year-old group with changes ranging from early neovascularization to fully developed disciform scars, geographic atrophy, and macular holes. Several retinas had pigment epithelial and photoreceptor cell numbers equal to those of the younger group, but most showed cell loss. Thickened, debris-filled Bruch's membrane and choriocapillary atrophy, although common, were not an invariable accompaniment to old age. Clinicians should advise elderly patients that their chances of maintaining macular structure, and hopefully function, are better than 50%.\r"

The amplitude of the pattern electroretinogram was reduced in diabetic patients who had no observable retinal changes. The amplitude was further reduced with increasing retinopathy. The pattern electroretinogram amplitude change was a more sensitive indicator of retinal change among the diabetic subpopulations than the statistically significant changes in latency. A significant correlation between pattern electroretinogram amplitude and the duration of diabetes were found in diabetic patients with either no observable retinopathy or minimal background retinopathy. The pattern electroretinogram may be useful as a quantitative, dependent variable to establish and monitor short-term metabolic and physiologic changes in diabetic patients.\r"

Twin vessels were detected in four of the six patients examined. The proband had bilateral retinal vascular hamartomas with central nervous system involvement but no twin vessels. The proband's mother had vascular hamartomas of the retina and brain with twin vessels. In the other three family members, twin vessels were associated either with retinal cavernous hemangiomas (one patient) or with normal fundi (two patients). Because twin vessels may be an ocular manifestation of von Hippel-Lindau disease, their presence in one of our two patients and in the otherwise healthy three family members suggests that twin vessels may be associated with different retinal vascular hamartomas, including capillary and cavernous hemangiomas.\r"

All arteriovenous crossings within three disk diameters of the optic disk, including the crossings at the sites of branch retinal vein occlusions, were studied. The relative positions of the crossing artery and vein could be determined at 1,939 crossings in all eyes. Crossings at which a vein crossed over an artery were a common finding (22.3% to 33.0% of crossings), but were rare at the crossings where branch retinal vein occlusions were found (2.4%). A greater proportion of arterial overcrossings was found in eyes with branch retinal vein occlusions (77.7%) compared to fellow eyes (70.6%) or control eyes (67.0%). Our data indicate that arterial overcrossings are at relatively higher risk of branch retinal vein occlusion than venous overcrossings, and that the risk of branch vein occlusion in an eye is proportional to the number of arterial overcrossings in the eye.\r"

If we used an inoculum of more than 10(7) organisms, many of the features of the human Listeria keratitis were mimicked. We also found that treatment with either penicillin or gentamicin did not control the infection as well as using both antibiotics simultaneously, a combination which resulted in relatively rapid resolution of infection and no corneal scarring. The human and animal data indicate that L. monocytogenes can be a virulent corneal pathogen. Listeria corneal infections must be treated aggressively with both penicillin and gentamicin to prevent permanent visual loss.\r"

On the General Health Questionnaire, the prevalence of psychological symptoms among the migraine subjects was 2.5 times the prevalence among the control subjects. The migraine sufferers also had significantly higher scores on the psychoticism (women only), neuroticism, and lie scales of the Eysenck Personality Questionnaire. Frequency of migraine attacks was not related to scores on any of the scales. These results suggest that classical migraine is associated with psychological abnormalities.\r"

In control subjects, the metabolic rate was higher in the right hemisphere than in the left, but patients with bulimia did not have this normal asymmetry. Lower metabolic rates in the basal ganglia, found in studies of depressed subjects, and higher rates in the basal ganglia, reported in a study of anorexia nervosa, were not found. This is consistent with the suggestion that bulimia is a diagnostic grouping distinct from these disorders.\r"

Age differences in nonanxiety behavior were found between subjects with and without anxiety, particularly with regard to interpersonal dysfunction.\r"

  ".U": "90178668\r", 
  ".W": "The optimal dose of thiopental depends both on its initial distribution kinetics, which determine its concentrations at sites of action after iv administration, and on its pharmacodynamics. The disposition of concomitantly administered thiopental and indocyanine green (ICG), a marker of intravascular space, was determined in 21 patients, aged 20-80 yr, to determine the pharmacokinetic basis of increased reactivity of the elderly to thiopental. Data obtained from frequent early arterial blood samples and the simultaneous modelling of thiopental disposition with that of ICG allow a rigorous description of early drug distribution. Their disposition is described by a two-compartment ICG model and a four-compartment thiopental model that have a common central volume, V1, the central blood pool. ICG distributes, by intravascular mixing, from V1 to a peripheral blood volume that is a subset of a rapidly equilibrating (fast) peripheral thiopental compartment; elimination clearance of both drugs is modelled from these peripheral compartments. In contrast to the results of others, the results of this study demonstrate that V1 does not decrease with increasing age. The only pharmacokinetic variable that changed with age is the intercompartmental clearance (Cl21) from V1 to the rapidly equilibrating peripheral volume, V2, which decreased 35% between the ages of 20-80 yr. The authors suggest that V1 and the intercompartmental clearances may be used together to explain smaller dose requirements in individuals with increased reactivity to thiopental; such an analysis does not predict that dose adjustments should be made on the basis of age alone.\r"

  ".W": "The authors have previously attributed the mechanism for the 50-67% decrease in the required dose of thiopental for induction of anesthesia in aged human patients to a decrease in the initial distribution volume for thiopental. Using a larger group of patients and volunteers studied in the laboratory, the authors have re-examined thiopental pharmacokinetics and EEG pharmacodynamics relative to age. A population data analysis approach (NONMEM), using a three-compartment model, was used to analyze bolus and rapid iv infusion thiopental serum concentration versus time data from 64 subjects. A one-compartment model was also used on the first 10 min of serum concentration data to focus only on the initial distribution phase. The population pharmacokinetic analysis demonstrated that when thiopental is administered via an iv bolus injection, traditional pharmacokinetic models limit the accurate characterization of thiopental distribution phenomena. Using the rapid iv infusion data, the pharmacokinetic mechanism for the decreased thiopental dose requirement in the elderly was a decreased rapid intercompartment clearance. Thiopental distribution from the central compartment of the three-compartment model to the rapidly equilibrating compartment (rapid intercompartment clearance) decreased 27% between the ages of 35-80 yr and decreased 34% in the one-compartment analysis. EEG spectral edge versus time data from 37 subjects was analyzed with a semiparametric modelling approach to remove the disequilibrium between thiopental serum concentration and the spectral edge. A population data analysis (NONMEM) was performed with several pharmacodynamic models. There was no age-related change in brain responsiveness or pharmacodynamics when the spectral edge is used as a measure of drug effect.\r"

These infants ranged between 32 and 43 weeks of gestational age (mean, 37.7 weeks) and the adult age range was from 27 to 54 years (mean, 35.4 years). Because the unbound fraction of the drug is responsible for its pharmacologic effect, a marked difference in the protein binding between neonates and adults may be relevant to the clinician. Blood obtained from freshly delivered placentas or from adult volunteers was allowed to clot and the serum separated from the sample. A portion of the serum was sent for protein and bilirubin analysis and the remainder retained for study. This latter serum was combined with four concentrations of thiopental. These specimens were then ultrafiltered and the amount of thiopental in the ultrafiltrate (unbound) compared with the prefiltered amount (total), as measured by reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography. The binding studies were repeated at pH 7.2, 7.4, and 7.6 in both the adult and neonatal serum. Total protein and albumin are significantly less in neonatal serum, whereas bilirubin (total and direct) is significantly higher in neonatal serum than in adult serum (P less than 0.01). Neonatal serum was associated with significantly more unbound thiopental than adult serum at all levels of pH studied (P less than 0.005). Increasing the pH resulted in less free drug in both groups, but this reached statistical significance only in the adult group (P less than 0.025). Drug concentration had no effect on binding in the range examined.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "To determine in infants and children the neuromuscular effect of pipecuronium during alfentanil-N2O/O2 anesthesia, the authors studied 32 ASA Physical Status 1 and 2 pediatric patients undergoing minor elective surgery, divided into three groups according to their age: group 1 included 12 infants, 1.9 +/- 0.2 months old (mean +/- SE; range, 20 days to 3 months), weighing 5.2 +/- 0.3 kg; group 2, 10 infants, 6.1 +/- 0.9 months old (range, 3-11 months), 6.9 +/- 0.4 kg; and group 3, 10 children 5.6 +/- 0.9 yr old (range, 2-9 yr), 19.6 +/- 2.2 kg. Neuromuscular blockade at the ulnar nerve-adductor pollicis muscle was measured by electromyography. Incremental iv doses of pipecuronium were given (one 20 micrograms/kg first dose, followed by 10 micrograms/kg increments) to reach a 95 +/- 2% twitch depression (ED95). In children ED50 and ED95 of pipecuronium were 45.0 +/- 5.8 micrograms/kg (mean +/- SE) and 70.5 +/- 9.3 micrograms/kg, respectively. In 3- to 12-month-old infants ED50 and ED95 were 25.8 +/- 1.5 micrograms/kg and 48.7 +/- 3.5 micrograms/kg, respectively, and both significantly (P less than 0.05) less than those in children. In 0- to 3-month-old infants ED50 and ED95 were 23.7 +/- 1.7 micrograms/kg and 46.5 +/- 2.9 micrograms/kg, respectively, and also significantly (P less than 0.05) less than those measured in children. Time from maximal initial neuromuscular blockade to 75% recovery was 64.5 +/- 8.8 min in children and significantly shorter (P less than 0.05) in the two infant groups (0- to 3-month-old: 38.7 +/- 5.7 min, 3- to 12-month-old: 43.8 +/- 5.3 min, respectively).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "In patients undergoing neurosurgical procedures at high risk for venous air embolism (VAE), the presence of a right-to-left shunt adds an additional risk for paradoxical air embolism (PAE). Although this is a rare complication, it can have devastating results. The most common form of right-to-left shunt is a patient foramen ovale (PFO), which can be detected by contrast echocardiography. This study evaluates the efficacy of preoperative precordial and intraoperative transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) to detect right-to-left shunting in patients undergoing neurosurgical procedures while in the sitting position. In 101 patients precordial contrast echocardiography was performed prior to surgery. The Valsalva maneuver was utilized as a provocative maneuver to facilitate demonstration of right-to-left shunting. Fifty-one of these patients also had intraoperative TEE monitoring. Right-to-left shunting was demonstrated in only six of the 101 patients examined. Of these, four were detected by TEE. This is less than the expected incidence based on the known incidence of PFO in the general population. The usefulness of preoperative ECHO as a screening test for PFO in patients undergoing neurosurgical procedures is limited, but when a PFO is found, valuable information is acquired to help manage these patients.\r"

To verify this the authors measured the position of larynx in lateral radiographs of necks taken in human volunteers when they were awake, and after induction of general anesthesia and muscle paralysis. The authors found that the hyoid bone and epiglottis were shifted anteriorly and the supraglottic region or the vestibule of the larynx was enlarged with the onset of general anesthesia and muscle paralysis. In addition, the larynx was also stretched longitudinally with wide separation of the vestibular and vocal folds. The authors conclude that consciousness is associated with tonic muscular activity that folds the larynx and partially closes it and that onset of general anesthesia and muscle paralysis opens the larynx wider and shifts it anteriorly, which might make visualization of the larynx during direct laryngoscopy difficult in some patients.\r"

Eleven patients with a history of excessive alcohol intake were studied from an inpatient alcohol rehabilitation program and compared with nine control patients or volunteers who were social drinkers. The alcoholic population had consumed ethanol 9-17 days prior to the study. They had no evidence of acute intoxication or acute withdrawal at the time of the study. Five of the 11 alcoholic patients were restudied after 1 month of abstinence from alcohol consumption. Each study consisted of a thiopental infusion until EEG burst suppression (1-3 s of isoelectric signal) was achieved. Timed arterial and then venous blood samples were obtained for measurement of thiopental serum concentrations for up to 36 h. Pharmacokinetic differences between groups were analyzed using a three-compartment model. Power spectral analysis of the EEG allowed determination of spectral edge frequency. An inhibitory sigmoid Emax pharmacodynamic model combined with an effect compartment was used to analyze concentration-response relationships and to provide an estimate of brain sensitivity to thiopental in the study populations. The thiopental anesthetic dose requirement using the EEG was not different between alcoholics and nonalcoholics. The mean dose requirement (+/- SD) of alcoholics was 823 +/- 246 mg and the mean dose requirement of nonalcoholics was 733 +/- 218 mg. There were no differences in thiopental pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters between alcoholics and nonalcoholics.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Binding of sufentanil was determined in vitro by equilibrium dialysis, and radioactive tritiated sufentanil was used for the determination of drug concentrations in plasma and buffer. The free fraction of sufentanil was significantly higher in the newborn (19.5 +/- 2.7%; P less than 0.01) than in the other age groups. The free fraction was also significantly higher in infants (11.5 +/- 3.2%; P less than 0.01) than in children (8.1 +/- 1.4%) or in adults (7.8 +/- 1.5%) but did not differ significantly between children and adults. The free fraction of sufentanil was strongly correlated with the alpha 1-acid glycoprotein plasma concentration (r = -0.73; P less than 0.001) whereas it was weakly correlated with albumin plasma concentration (r = -0.35; P less than 0.05). These data suggest that the lower concentration of alpha 1-acid glycoprotein in newborns and infants probably accounts for the decrease in protein binding of sufentanil in these age groups when compared with that in older children or adults. The increased free fraction in the neonate might contribute to the enhanced effects of lipophilic opioids in the neonate.\r"

The laryngeal mask airway consists of a tube, at the distal end of which is attached an elliptically shaped cuff resembling a miniature face mask. The laryngeal mask is inserted blindly into the pharynx, and its cuff forms a low pressure seal around the larynx through which the patient can breathe spontaneously. No complications occurred during use of the laryngeal mask in 25 children who received 312 anesthetics. This experience suggests that the laryngeal mask airway has a valuable role in this situation and may contribute to the safety of anesthesia.\r"

Fifteen minutes after injection, while the women lay supine on a horizontal operating table, the maximum cephalad extent of sensory analgesia (loss of sensation of sharpness to pin prick) and anesthesia (loss of sensation of light touch) was determined. Age (20-42 yr), height (146.9-174.0 cm), weight (55.5-136.4 kg), body mass index (19.2-50.0 kg/m2), and vertebral column length (49.6-67.0 cm) did not correlate with the spread of sensory blockade.

Lidocaine, 6 mg/kg (base), was infused at a constant rate for 1 h and measurements continued to 5 h. Rate of fetal uptake was determined from the product of the umbilical venous (UV) and fetal aortic (FA) concentration difference and umbilical blood flow (Qu). Total fetal uptake was determined by integrating fetal uptake rate with respect to time. Maternal and fetal protein binding was determined, and its effect on fetal blood concentrations was evaluated. Mean total fetal uptake as it related to time and infused dose increased linearly (r = 0.998, P less than 0.001) with a constant, weight-normalized fetal-maternal dose fraction of 0.45 during the infusion. Despite rapidly declining blood concentrations after the infusion, uptake increased an additional 17%. The sevenfold variation in uptake appeared to be inversely related to the biodegradation rate of lidocaine. Fetal-maternal concentration ratios (F/M) increased during declining blood concentrations. Protein binding determinations for maternal and fetal blood were 43.6 +/- 2.48% and 26.9 +/- 1.59%, respectively. These values were used to calculate the F/M in conjunction with the maternal and fetal pH. At maternal-fetal equilibrium the calculated F/M, 1.0 +/- 0.05, closely approximated the observed, 1.0 +/- 0.03. Variations in lidocaine concentrations among the vital organs 4 h after the infusion were small, but high concentrations of metabolites were found in the lungs and kidneys. The results challenge the validity of placental transfer estimates commonly based on the F/M and umbilical cord blood concentrations.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

A bronchial divider was inserted, the right lung (RL) was continuously ventilated with 100% O2, and the left lung (LL) was ventilated with either 100% O2 (hyperoxia) or a hypoxic gas mixture (hypoxia). Sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) was used to measure differential lung blood flow and the multiple inert gas technique assessed gas exchange. The response to LL alveolar hypoxia (hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction, HPV) was studied in each animal prior to, during, and after the ICP was increased by infusing mock cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) into a lateral ventricle so that cerebral perfusion pressure was 25 mmHg. During both control periods, QT was randomly altered by opening (high QT) or closing (normal QT) two arteriovenous fistulas. Increasing ICP significantly increased QT (P less than 0.01), pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) (P less than 0.05), and mixed venous oxygen tension (PVO2) (P less than 0.05), compared with normal QT controls. Opening the arteriovenous fistulas achieved similar increases in QT (P less than 0.01), PAP (P less than 0.05), and PVO2 (P less than 0.05). The percentage of blood flow to the LL (QL/QT%) during hyperoxia was 43.9 +/- 0.8% (mean +/- SE) and did not vary with manipulation of QT or ICP.

Single-channel currents activated by 200 nM acetylcholine were recorded from cell-attached patches of BC3H1 mouse tumor cells grown in culture. Channels were recorded in the absence and presence of edrophonium (1-20 microM), neostigmine (2-20 microM), or pyridostigmine (10-200 microM). All three drugs shortened channel open time but did not alter single-channel current amplitude. Effects on channel open time were not secondary to inhibition of cholinesterase but appeared to involve direct interactions between anticholinesterase drugs and acetylcholine-activated channels. Drug concentrations calculated to reduce the time constant of open time distributions by 50% were 3.8 microM edrophonium, 4.6 microM neostigmine, or 97 microM pyridostigmine. Channel open time was decreased by edrophonium at concentrations comparable to those occurring during reversal of neuromuscular block, but it was reduced by neostigmine and pyridostigmine only at levels higher than those encountered clinically. Differences in interactions between anticholinesterases and acetylcholine-activated channels at the end plate may possibly account for some of the clinical differences between these drugs.\r"

Hepatocytes isolated from rat livers were used fresh or treated with saponin and then incubated in 45Ca++ media. The uptake of 45Ca++ by hepatocytes was maximal following 13-16 min of incubation (untreated or saponin-treated) and the effects of various agents on the release of 45Ca++ was studied following maximal loading. The agents used included halothane, enflurane, isoflurane, and several putative intracellular second messengers. The anesthetics, to various degrees, all stimulated a significant release of 45Ca++ from internal stores at concentrations that were at or less than clinical concentrations. The release of intracellular 45Ca++ by each of the anesthetic agents was dose-dependent with halothane and enflurane being equally potent at concentrations equivalent to 1 MAC exposure. The halothane-induced release was only somewhat suppressed by preincubation in either 2 mM LaCL3 or 10 microM dantrolene, both suggested Ca++ channel blockers. Transient increases in intracellular Ca++ regulates a number of enzyme systems, including glycogenolysis, while prolonged elevation in Ca++ concentrations have been implicated in the mechanism of hepatotoxicity.\r"

Arteriovenous oxygen content difference (C(a-v)O2), O2 extraction ratio, mixed venous oxygen tension (PVO2), pH, and base deficit (BD) were not different from control values even during prolonged hypothermia. Normothermic control dogs also demonstrated a significant decrease in CI (P less than 0.05) at 24 h. Surface rewarming increased VO2 back to control values in the acute hypothermia group and to values above control (P less than 0.05) in the prolonged hypothermia group. DO2 remained below control in both groups, resulting in a significant increase in O2 extraction (P less than 0.05) and a decrease in PVO2 (P less than 0.05) in the prolonged hypothermia animals.

  ".W": "This study was performed to study the effects of acute pulmonary embolization (injection of autologous muscle) on global and regional (ultrasonic dimension technique) right ventricular (RV) performance, coronary hemodynamics (electromagnetic flow probes), and gas exchange during underlying critical stenosis (cuff occluder) of the right coronary artery (RCA) in eight open-chest dogs. Resting coronary blood flow (CBF) and regional myocardial performance remained unaffected by the induction of RCA stenosis. Following embolization pulmonary artery (PA) pressure, pulmonary vascular resistance, end-diastolic dimensions and pressure increased, and PA flow, stroke volume (SV), and aortic pressure (AoP) decreased (P less than 0.05). There was a marked decline (60%) in CBF accompanied by severe myocardial dysfunction suggestive of ischemia (akinesis, systolic lengthening, postsystolic shortening) in the area supplied by the stenosed RCA. Gas exchange, lung compliance, and pH worsened. Release of the RCA constriction led to a fourfold increase in CBF, return of PA flow, SV, and AoP to baseline values, and disappearance of regional myocardial dysfunction despite continued pulmonary hypertension. These data indicate that RV function may deteriorate in response to even small increases in afterload if coronary vascular reserve is absent and aortic pressure is allowed to decrease.\r"

  ".W": "The aim of this study was to investigate direct cytotoxicity to human and rat hepatocytes in primary culture from halothane and compare it with that of isoflurane, which is known to be minimally metabolized and less toxic in vivo. Both human and rat parenchymal cells were isolated by the two-step collagenase perfusion method and after attachment to plastic were incubated with either volatile anesthetic for 24 h. All the cultures were maintained in 20% O2 condition and were not induced prior to anesthetic treatment. Temperature, atmosphere conditions, and anesthetic concentrations were kept constant during the study period. Evaluation of cytotoxicity was based on morphologic, biologic (determination of both extracellular and intracellular lactate dehydrogenase activity), and metabolic (protein synthesis and secretion) end points. Protein synthesis and secretion rates were found to be the most sensitive parameters in hepatocyte cultures from both species. Protein synthesis was inhibited by 18% and protein secretion by 50% in the presence of 1 and 1.25 mM halothane, respectively, in human cell cultures (P less than 0.05). With 1.25 mM halothane intracellular lactate dehydrogenase was also decreased; lactate dehydrogenase leakage and morphologic alterations were detected only beyond 5 mM halothane. By contrast, in rat hepatocyte cultures protein secretion was inhibited by 26% and protein synthesis by 20% in the presence of 0.1 and 0.75 mM halothane, respectively, whereas morphologic alterations and a 37% lactate dehydrogenase leakage increase were observed with the concentration of 1 mM (P less than 0.05).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Both arterial and arteriolar responses were assessed; particular attention was directed to epicardial vessels. Four experimental methods and three animal species were used. Isolated canine coronary artery rings with and without endothelium were suspended in organ chambers, and changes in their tension were measured. Fentanyl (100 ng/ml) had no effect on resting tension of unstimulated rings on a contraction evoked by serotonin 10(-8) to 10(-4) M. In rings with endothelium, the opioid had a minimal depressant effect on the contractile response to phenylephrine. Tension of vessels precontracted with serotonin (3 x 10(-7) M), or phenylephrine (10(-5) M) was unchanged following fentanyl at 10, 30, 70, or 150 ng/ml. Computerized quantitative angiography was used in intact pigs anesthetized with ketamine to determine the effects of fentanyl on coronary artery diameters of vessels with or without endothelium. Intravenous fentanyl 50 and 250 micrograms/kg had no effect on vessel diameters. Isolated perfused rat hearts were used to assess fentanyl effects upon coronary flow and arteriolar tone and upon myocardial energy state. Coronary blood flow was not altered by fentanyl (100 ng/ml) and was unchanged following washout of the drug. The heart maintained a normal energy status prior to and following fentanyl treatment. These data demonstrate that, under the conditions tested, fentanyl is devoid of major effects on the coronary circulation and upon myocardial metabolism.\r"

Radio Shack no. 44-1155 and 3M no. 1430 were quickly perforated by the laser. Laser contact with the adhesive side of 3M no. 433 resulted in combustion. The nonadhesive side of the Venture copper tape was not affected by the laser; however, when its adhesive side was struck, a fire occurred. 3M no. 425 tape provided the best protection: no effect was seen when the laser was aimed at its nonadhesive side for 1 min, with only smoking of the tape evident when its adhesive side was tested. Finally, 3M no. 425 and Venture copper foil tapes were shown to be resistant to an Nd-YAG laser set to 110 watts in an atmosphere of 98% O2.\r"

Thirty-six healthy adult white rabbits received 0.3 ml/kg epidural injections of either lactated Ringer's solution (negative control group), 1% lidocaine containing methylprednisolone acetate (study group), or normal saline containing talc (positive control group). Animals were killed either 4 or 10 days after injection and stained sections of the spinal cord and meningeal membranes were examined by light microscopy. In all animals that received either lactated Ringer's solution or lidocaine with methylprednisolone acetate, microscopic examination of specimens taken from the L5-L6 interspace revealed no white cell infiltrates and no fibroblastic activity. All animals that received epidural injections of normal saline containing talc had marked infiltration of tissue macrophages in the epidural space. There was no thickening of the meningeal membranes or nerve roots in any animal. The complete lack of inflammatory changes and meningeal thickening demonstrated in this pilot study helps to confirm the safety of methylprednisolone acetate when injected into the epidural space.\r"

In 13 individuals with a normal ankle index, the flow of cessation external pressure (FCEP) was, on average, 28 mmHg lower than the systolic ankle pressure (range: 7-62). In 19 patients with an ankle index below 1.0, FCEP correlated with the ankle pressure (rs = 0.76) and even more closely with the ankle index (rs = 0.82). In patients with a more pronounced degree of arterial occlusive disease, FCEP can be equal to or even higher than the ankle pressure. This may be due to a release of sympathetic vasoconstrictor tone and possibly to the presence of a collateral circulation supplying the skin. Individual LDF values from the skin at rest do not reflect the degree of peripheral circulatory insufficiency.\r"

  ".U": "90178706\r", 
  ".W": "Twelve healthy male volunteers were given adrenaline infusions, 0.05 microgram/kg body weight/minute over one hundred twenty minutes (min), in order to achieve serum adrenaline concentrations comparable with those seen in acute myocardial infarction. The infusions were given on three occasions, at intervals of at least four weeks. Before the infusions the subjects were given, in random order, two days' pretreatment with placebo, a beta-1-selective adrenoceptor blocker (atenolol), or a nonselective beta blocker (propranolol) with each subject receiving each pretreatment. Six of the volunteers also had a fourth adrenaline infusion, after two days' pretreatment with a beta-2-selective beta blocker, ICI 118551. Adrenaline increased heart rate by 11 beats/min, increased systolic blood pressure by 10 mmHg, and decreased diastolic blood pressure by 15 mmHg. These changes were partly prevented by atenolol. Propranolol and ICI 118551 partly prevented the rise in systolic blood pressure but differed from atenolol in their effects on heart rate and diastolic blood pressure, causing falls in heart rate by 7 beats/min and 12 beats/min respectively, secondary perhaps to increases in diastolic blood pressure by 13 mmHg and 17 mmHg respectively. Adrenaline caused a prolongation of QTc duration by 0.03 second and a flattening of the T-wave amplitude by 1.04 mm. These changes in cardiac repolarization were partly inhibited by atenolol, but the effects of propranolol and ICI 118551 were greater, each causing a reduction of QTc and an increase in T-wave amplitude. During adrenaline infusion S-potassium declined by 0.60 mmol/L, S-magnesium by 0.05, S-calcium by 0.10, and S-phosphate by 0.24, but S-free fatty acids increased nearly threefold. All these changes were statistically significant and were presumably mediated mainly by the beta-2-adrenoceptor, for they were blocked more effectively by the beta-2-adrenoceptor blockers than by the selective beta-1-adrenoceptor blocker. B-glucose increased by 4.1 mmol/L, the increase being practically unaffected by the different pretreatments. These adrenaline-induced hemodynamic, electrocardiographic, and metabolic changes may predispose to arrhythmias and impair cardiac performance after a myocardial infarction. Nonselective beta blockers may be more effective in blocking the electrocardiographic and metabolic effects, but beta-1-selective beta blockers may have hemodynamic advantages.\r"

Infarcted hearts and normal hearts were investigated mainly by means of coronary angiography, as well as by gross and histologic examinations. Transmural myocardial infarction originated in the inner half of the myocardial layer, which was predominantly supplied by class A arteries, followed by gradual extension to the outer layer. The early infarcted focus revealed an angiographically avascular state. This may have been the result of shrinkage of the peripheral branches of class A arteries due to increased extravascular resistance rather than to arteriolar obstruction by small thrombi and/or leukocyte plugs. By contrast, class B arteries remained patent and were almost entirely free from such phenomena. They usually penetrated the infarcted focus to drain into the papillary muscles and trabeculae carnae. As the process of myocardial infarction progressed, various patterns of vascular reactions corresponding to the healing phase were demonstrated by these branches within the infarcted foci. The passive response of class A arteries during acute ischemia characterized the early myocardial lesion. Subsequently, neovascularization from the surviving class B arteries in the infarcted focus occurred as a part of the formation of granulation tissue. Newly formed small arteries from class A arteries also participated in this reaction at the marginal area of the lesion. These well-coordinated vascular reactions revealed in greater detail the initiation and progression of the healing process and were reflective of the clinical prognosis.\r"

In 16 patients with a history of cold hands and feet the presence of peripheral vasospasms without any underlying disease was demonstrated by means of nailfold video-capillaroscopy. These patients showed the phenomenologic diagnosis of low-tension glaucoma with visual field defects characteristic of glaucoma even though intraocular pressure above 21 mmHg was excluded. The visual field defects were not homonymous, indicating a prechiasmal location of the vascular disturbance. Ocular vasospasms cause visual field damage that can be aggravated or provoked by cooling one hand in cold water and that often improves after treatment with the calcium channel blocker nifedipine. The results suggest that vasospasms not only are present in Raynaud's disease, migraine, and Prinzmetal's variant angina but also may be an important factor in the genesis of low-tension glaucoma. This is a new finding and may be related to a general vasospastic syndrome.\r"

Of 22 toe amputations, the open technique performed in 14 patients required a mean of nine postoperative days; the closed-toe amputation technique performed in 8 patients needed a mean of 5.8 days; the closed-toe amputation requiring revision needed a mean of 36.3 days. Healing rates were significantly different when the wound was left open versus primarily closed (chi 2 8.56 p less than .01). Nineteen transmetatarsal amputations (TMA) were completed; 10 open TMAs required a mean of twenty-four days; 9 closed TMAs required a mean of fifteen days; and revision a mean of eighteen days. Of 51 below-the-knee amputations (BKA), 20 open BKAs required a mean of thirteen days; 3 closed BKAs required a mean of 18.5 days; and 1 revision required two hundred fifty-eight days postoperatively. Twenty-five above-the-knee amputations (AKA) were performed; the 10 open AKAs required a mean of sixteen days; the 15 closed AKAs required a mean of eleven days. There was no significant difference in healing rates of TMA, BKA, or AKA. Healing rates of toe amputations and amputation overall are, however, significantly different. Closed lower extremity amputation wounds require fewer hospital days than open, except if problems in wound healing require revision.\r"

  ".W": "The prevalence and risk factors of varicose veins in Japan were investigated in 541 Japanese women. Varicose veins were defined as any dilated, tortuous, and elongated veins of the lower extremity and classified into four types. The total prevalence rate was 45%. Saphenous type was observed in 22%, segment type in 35%, reticular type in 28%, and web type in 16%. Varicose veins in Japan seem to be less common than in the United States and Europe but more prevalent than in Africa. Concerning risk factors for varices, age, sex, heredity, and childbirth were related to the incidence of varicosities, as reported by others. However, these risk factors were shown to differ according to type of varicose veins.\r"

  ".W": "The blood-brain barrier to endogenous serum albumin labeled with Evans blue was studied by standard fluorescence microscopic techniques in cats. Systematic studies confirm that, except in certain well-known loci (hypothalamic median eminence, subfornical organ, area postrema, etc.), blood vessels within brain tissue are impermeable to endogenous albumin. But studies also demonstrate that in virtually all arteries at the base and over the surface of the brain and brain stem, labeled albumin passes readily through endothelium and the vascular wall to the adventitia. These observations are discussed in the context of current concepts of intracranial vascular permeability and, in terms of general biology, the possible consequences of the permeability to serum albumin of intracranial, extraparenchymal blood vessels on the composition and physiology of cerebrospinal fluid and in the pharmacokinetics of antibiotics, anticonvulsants, and antineoplastic and vasoactive agents.\r"

In concordance with dye injection studies, a zone of flow separation was clearly demonstrated at the origin of the internal carotid artery opposite the flow divider. This zone of flow reversal was detected when the ratio of external to common carotid flow rates was greater than 0.27 and became progressively larger as the ratio increased, finally evolving into a zone of heterogenous flow at a ratio greater than 0.5. The authors conclude that the zone of flow reversal seen in the human carotid artery is a geometric property of the bifurcation and that its size depends on the relative flow between both branches. Doppler color imaging can be used to noninvasively map out its extent.\r"

  ".W": "A sixty-two-year-old man who underwent coronary angiography and received acute thrombolytic and anticoagulant therapy for acute myocardial infarction developed multisystemic injury, including renal insufficiency and cutaneous manifestations. Fundoscopic examination and skin biopsy specimen led to the diagnosis of multiple cholesterol embolization syndrome (MCES). Discontinuation of anticoagulants and administration of hemostatic (carbazochrome, tranexamic acid, reptilase, and vitamin K) and antihyperlipidemic (cholestyramine and probucol) drugs resulted in temporary improvement of cutaneous and renal disorders and extended survival for about one year. Besides severe aortic atherosclerosis, postmortem examination revealed numerous cholesterol emboli to multiple organs. MCES is a rare but serious complication of left heart catheterization and anticoagulant therapy, and the optimal treatment remains to be established. The authors suggest here that the above-mentioned therapy might be effective for management of MCES.\r"
