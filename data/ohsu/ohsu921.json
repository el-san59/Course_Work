Three consecutive pulmonary function tests were obtained before and after repositioning of the esophageal catheter, for a total of six measurements per day in each subject. The daily coefficient of variation for these 11 subjects ranged from 6% to 32% for respiratory rate; 6% to 27% for tidal volume; 3% to 28% for specific dynamic compliance, and 11% to 69% for pulmonary resistance. Repositioning the esophageal catheter did not produce significant differences in measurements of pulmonary mechanics (p greater than 0.05). We conclude that within a given subject, the maximum variability (mean + 2 SD) was 28% for specific dynamic compliance and 56% for pulmonary resistance. These intrasubject variability limits are important when one is interpreting pulmonary mechanics measurements in neonates before and after specific treatment, such as bronchodilators, diuretics, surfactant, or steroids.\r"

In those babies (n = 72) with no periventricular-intraventricular hemorrhage (PV-IVH) or with grade 1 PV-IVH, the MAP values increased during the study period, with minute-to-minute variation and interval undulation. The MAP values in those with birth weight greater than 1000 gm were higher than in those of lower birth weight. Infants in whom grades 2 to 4 PV-IVH developed (n = 28) had consistently lower MAP values during the study period. Minute-to-minute variability, expressed as the average of the coefficients of variation at 15-minute intervals, did not differ between birth weight groups, nor did they differ between the PV-IVH group and their matched control subjects. However, those with PV-IVH spent a greater percentage of time, with a coefficient of variation greater than or equal to 13% or less than 3%, than their matched control subjects spent (p less than 0.005). This study provides reference data for MAP changes in premature babies. The observed MAP changes in those with PV-IVH lend support to a significant role for MAP alterations in the pathogenesis of PV-IVH.\r"

The infants were divided into three groups: (1) those with no IVH (22 infants), (2) those with IVH with acute ventricular dilation (13 infants), and (3) those with IVH with progressive ventricular dilation requiring intervention (13 infants). The decision to intervene because of progressive ventricular dilation was based on clinical criteria and the subjective assessment of increasing ventricular size on weekly cranial sonograms. The rate of cerebral ventricular volume growth in infants with IVH who needed intervention was greater (4.2 +/- 3.3 ml/day) than that in infants without IVH (0.0 +/- 0.1 ml/day; p less than 0.001) and in infants with IVH and acute ventricular dilation (0.0 +/- 0.2 ml/day; p less than 0.001). Using these data, we generated guidelines for predicting prospectively which infants with IVH and ventricular dilation will need intervention for posthemorrhagic hydrocephalus. The guidelines were then confirmed prospectively in 10 infants.\r"

  ".W": "The relationship of maternal use of marijuana and cocaine during pregnancy to measures of neonatal body proportionality and body composition was assessed in a multiethnic sample of 1082 newborn infants. Maternal use of marijuana and cocaine during pregnancy was ascertained by self-report and by an enzyme-multiplied immunoassay technique for screening of urine samples obtained prenatally and again post partum. After each substance was analytically controlled for use of the other and for other potentially confounding variables, detection of marijuana metabolites in maternal urine was associated (p less than 0.05) with depressed mean arm muscle circumference and nonfat area of the arm but not with any measure of neonatal fatness. In contrast, detection of cocaine in maternal urine was associated (p less than 0.05) with decrements of subscapular fat folds and of the fat and nonfat areas of the arm. Although both substances were associated with depressed birth weight, there was no decrement of neonatal ponderal index or of the arm circumference/head circumference ratio in association with exposure to either substance. We conclude that both marijuana exposure and cocaine exposure during pregnancy are associated with symmetric intrauterine growth retardation, but that deficits are in differing compartments of intrauterine growth. These findings suggest that marijuana may retard fetal growth through maternal-fetal hypoxia, whereas cocaine may alter nutrient transfer to the fetus and fetal metabolism.\r"

The albuterol therapy resulted in a significantly greater improvement in the accessory muscle score (decreases 0.70 vs decreases 0.30; p = 0.03), oxygen saturation (increases 0.71% vs decreases 0.47%; p = 0.01) after one dose, and in the accessory muscle score (decreases 0.86 vs decreases 0.37; p = 0.02), respiratory rate (decreases 19.6% vs decreases 8.0%; p = 0.016), and oxygen saturation (increases 0.76% vs decreases 0.79%; p = 0.015) after two doses of the drug. The response to therapy was similar in infants younger and those older than 6 months of age. The heart rate rose slightly more in the albuterol group (increases 7.76 from baseline) versus the placebo group (decreases 6.79). There were no other side effects of the treatment. Of the 34 children from whom nasal specimens were obtained by swab for viral identification, 24 had positive test results (21 for respiratory syncytial virus, 1 for parainfluenza, 1 for paramyxovirus, and 1 for influenza A). We conclude that nebulized albuterol constitutes a safe and effective treatment of infants with bronchiolitis.\r"

  ".W": "Because intravenously administered immune globulin (IVIG) is effective in reducing the incidence of coronary artery aneurysms in Kawasaki syndrome when given at a dose of 400 mg/kg daily for 4 days, we undertook a multicenter clinical trial comparing two dosage regimens of IVIG. Patients were randomly assigned to receive IVIG at either 400 mg/kg daily for 4 days (22 patients) or 1 gm/kg as a single dose (22 patients). All patients received aspirin therapy, and all were enrolled within 7 days of onset of fever. The presence of coronary artery aneurysms was evaluated by means of two-dimensional echocardiography before infusion; at days 4 to 6, 14 to 21, and 42 to 49 after infusion; and at 1 year. Coronary artery aneurysms were detected in 3 of the 44 patients, including one patient receiving 400 mg/kg and two patients receiving 1 gm/kg (p value not significant). No giant aneurysms were detected. No major side effects occurred with either dosage regimen. Patients receiving the 1 gm/kg dose had a faster resolution of fever and were discharged from the hospital approximately 1 day sooner than the 400 mg/kg group (p = 0.01). Although the relatively small sample size in this trial does not allow for a more definitive statement regarding the occurrence of coronary artery aneurysms, it appears that the 1 gm/kg dose is associated with a more rapid clinical improvement and a shorter hospital stay.\r"

No significant intergroup differences in response rates or in the amount of improvement in articular indexes of disease activity were observed. More children treated with aspirin discontinued treatment early because of adverse reactions. After this trial, 84 additional patients with juvenile rheumatoid arthritis entered a 24-week, multidose (30, 40, and 50 mg/kg/day), open trial of ibuprofen suspension. Favorable response rates for the three groups were similar, and continued improvement was observed throughout the 24-week period. A dose-response relationship was observed with respect to adverse reactions of the upper gastrointestinal tract. We conclude that ibuprofen suspension is an effective nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug and that its tolerability in children is acceptable.\r"

The initial dose of methotrexate averaged 7.1 mg/m2/wk and was given as a single, oral weekly dose or as three divided doses, each separated by 12 hours. Current antiinflammatory medications were continued; 25 of 29 children had had lack of efficacy, and 8 of 29 had toxic effects, with one or more prior drugs such as intramuscularly or orally administered gold, hydroxychloroquine, or D-penicillamine. Intolerable corticosteroid dependency or toxic effects were present in 18 of 29 cases. Methotrexate-treated patients were examined monthly; minimum treatment duration required to assess efficacy and toxicity was 6 months. The range of treatment duration was 8 to 39 months (mean 18.5 months). Efficacy was assessed by comparing pretreatment versus posttreatment fever and rash, swollen-joint counts, articular indexes, duration of morning stiffness, functional class, hemoglobin levels, and platelet counts. Treatment with methotrexate effectively controlled fever and rash in 83% of children with systemic juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, reduced morning stiffness by 63%, eliminated recalcitrant joint restriction in 48%, and reduced numbers of swollen joints and swelling indexes by 46% and 52%, respectively. No significant toxic effects were observed. Juvenile rheumatoid arthritis of long duration, or with major erosions, was more likely to be refractory to methotrexate therapy. We recommend earlier consideration of methotrexate in place of other slow-acting antirheumatic drugs for juvenile rheumatoid arthritis not responding well to usual therapy. Future studies should address potential methotrexate toxic effects in the lungs and reproductive system, as well as outcome after discontinuation of methotrexate treatment.\r"

The immunologic and pathologic manifestations of SIV infections in rhesus monkeys are described.\r"

The red blood cells bearing recombinant CD4 (RBC-rCD4+) specifically bound to gp 120-covered plates. The binding showed a threshold effect at low rCD4 concentrations per RBC. The binding of RBC-rCD4+ to gp120 plates was not inhibited by plasma proteins (incubation in human blood plasma). Preincubation of the RBC-rCD4+ with monoclonal anti-CD4 antibodies blocked the binding to the gp120-covered plates. Incubation of chinese hamster ovary (CHO) fibroblasts, which constitutively express the HIV envelope protein gp120 with RBC-rCD4+, resulted in the formation of large cell aggregates. These in vitro data suggest that RBC-rCD4+ retain affinity for gp120 and thus could have potential therapeutical value in AIDS treatment.\r"

Electron microscopy revealed the accumulation of intact virus particles on the cell surface of the cells treated with IFN-alpha. Thus, IFN-alpha might suppress the release stage of the particle from infected cells.\r"

One strategy is to use early markers of disease progression, such as CD4+ lymphocyte levels, as surrogates for ultimate clinical endpoints, such as the development of acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) or death, in the evaluation of new therapies. We used a simple model of transitions among three health states (well; alive but with an adverse marker; and having experienced a definitive clinical endpoint) to examine the extent to which treatment comparisons based on the surrogate endpoint predict ultimate clinical benefits. With parameters chosen to model the treatment of HIV infection, computer simulations of clinical trials demonstrated substantial time savings by use of the surrogate endpoint. However, reliance on the surrogate led to serious overestimates of ultimate clinical benefit if treatment entailed delayed toxicity or had only transient beneficial effects. Likewise, reliance on the surrogate led to serious underestimates of ultimate clinical benefit when the treatment had no effect on the transition from well to the marker state but did reduce the rates of transition from the marker state to the ultimate clinical endpoint and directly from the well state to the ultimate clinical endpoint.\r"

  ".W": "We identified 277 homosexual and bisexual men diagnosed with acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) whose estimated human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) seroconversion dates, ranging from 1977-85, could be well approximated. These men were from a cohort of 6,705 homosexual and bisexual men originally recruited for studies of sexually transmitted hepatitis B in San Francisco in 1978-80. We compared the time from HIV seroconversion to the initial disease diagnostic of AIDS (AIDS latency period) with the time from first AIDS diagnosis to death (AIDS survival time) and found no significant overall correlation between latency period and survival time. Both Kaplan-Meier and Cox proportional hazard stepwise analyses found the initial AIDS diagnosis to be significantly associated with latency period, with individuals first diagnosed with Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) having a shorter latency but longer survival than those first diagnosed with Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP) or other AIDS diagnoses. Individuals with KS tended to be diagnosed earlier in the epidemic compared to those with PCP and other non-KS diagnoses. The AIDS survival time was significantly associated with the initial AIDS diagnosis but not with the estimated year of seroconversion, the year of first AIDS diagnosis, age at seroconversion, or racial/ethnic group. The information presented here on the relationship between the AIDS latency period and survival times suggests a model for the pathogenesis of HIV infection in which there is continual deterioration of the immune system. The wider use of antiviral and prophylactic therapies both preceding and following a diagnosis of AIDS may change this model as both latency and survival times are improved.\r"

We present the baseline behavior of this model in a generic community and demonstrate the model's utility for assessing public health interventions.

Estimates of HTLV-I infection rates in eight endemic prefectures, by age group and sex, were obtained from serologic studies of blood donors; population figures, by age group, sex, and prefecture, were obtained from the census. Of 589 definite cases of HAM/TSP reported nationally, 397 occurred in residents of the eight endemic prefectures; of these, 170 reported onset of illness during the years 1982-1988 (average incidence, 24.3 cases/year). Using the estimated HTLV-I infection rates and the 1985 census figures, we estimated the number of HTLV-I-infected persons in the eight prefectures in 1985 at 794,800. We therefore estimated the incidence of HAM/TSP among HTLV-I-infected persons at 3.1 x 10(-5) cases/year; assuming a lifetime of 75 years, the lifetime incidence is approximately one quarter of 1%. This estimate is important in counseling persons such as blood donors found to be infected with HTLV-I.\r"

In Tobago, from a coastal village, among persons of African ancestry ascertained as part of a cardiovascular survey, the rate was 11.4%, which was significantly higher when corrected for age and race than the rate in Trinidad. The seroprevalence rate of antibodies to hepatitis A and B was also significantly elevated in Tobago compared to Trinidad. HTLV-I seroprevalence rates were higher in females than males while hepatitis A and B rates were not significantly different in the two sexes. For males, age was a significant determinant of HTLV-I seropositivity, while for females, age, markers of poor sanitation, and hepatitis B were each independently linked to HTLV-I seropositivity. The frequent occurrence of multiple infectious exposures in persons of lower socioeconomic circumstances in this tropical environment may result in immune activation that heightens susceptibility to HTLV-I infection.\r"

In Yemen, all sera were negative. In the Congo, the seropositivity among patients and controls was, respectively, 3.8 and 5.2%; in Senegal, it was 1.3 and 0.6%; and in the Ivory Coast 4.8 and 3.9%. Differences were not statistically significant, even considering lepromatous or tuberculoid forms (3.6% and 3.7%, respectively). HIV-2 antibodies were only detected in subjects from the Ivory Coast and Senegal. Using appropriate criteria for seropositivity (confirmation by Western blot, reactivity to HIV envelope glycoproteins) and a large selection of patients (several countries with several centers), it appears that leprosy (and specially the lepromatous form) is not a factor for HIV infection.\r"

After 1 month and after 1 year of treatment, a significant decrease in the mean firing rate of substantia nigra pars reticulata neurons was found. Subtle changes in the response of pars reticulata neurons to striatal stimulation were seen after extended haloperidol intake. No consistent effects of haloperidol administration for 4 weeks or 13 to 14 months were found for either the number of spontaneously active dopamine neurons or their firing rates. Histopathologic assessment of tissue from dorsomedial, dorsolateral and ventrolateral sectors of the striatum revealed no significant effect of long-term haloperidol treatment on neuronal cell counts.

The rank order of potencies of the agonists was: sulprostone greater than 16, 16-dimethyl-PGE2 greater than PGE2 greater than 11-deoxy-PGE1 greater than iloprost (stable PGl2 analog) greater than PGF2 alpha greater than or equal to PGD2. However, the Tx-mimetic, U-46619, was without effect on transmitter release at concentrations up to 1 microM. The selective EP1-receptor antagonists, AH 6809 (30 microM) or SC-19220 (10 microM) had no effect on basal or field-stimulated [3H]NE secretion, nor did they antagonize the PGE2-mediated reduction of evoked [3H]NE overflow. Indomethacin (3 microM) and the 5-lipoxygenase inhibitor, BW A4C (1 microM) were without effect on basal or evoked [3H]NE release, suggesting that endogenously formed arachidonic acid metabolites have no significant modulatory role in this in vitro system. Inhibitory effects of submaximal or maximal concentrations of PGE2 combined with corresponding concentrations of clonidine or carbachol were not additive, suggesting that prejunctional PGE2 receptors coexist with alpha-2 adrenergic and muscarinic receptors at neurotransmitter release sites. In the presence of yohimbine (100 nM) and/or atropine (100 nM), however, the inhibition produced by PGE2 was enhanced markedly, suggesting that tonic activation of prejunctional alpha-2 adrenergic or muscarinic receptors by endogenously released transmitters may impair the response to exogenous PGE2.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The fura-2-Ca++ fluorescence emitted from endothelial and smooth muscle cells was detected at the endothelial surface. In the aorta with endothelium, NE increased both [Ca++]i and muscle tension whereas CCh slightly relaxed the muscle and increased [Ca++]i. The CCh-stimulated [Ca++]i was partially inhibited by verapamil. Addition of CCh to the NE-stimulated aorta relaxed the muscle with additional increase in [Ca++]i and positive correlation was obtained between the increase in [Ca++]i and relaxation. In the aorta without endothelium, NE increased both [Ca++]i and tension although CCh was ineffective. When endothelium was removed only from a small area from where the fura-2-Ca++ fluorescence was detected, CCh relaxed the muscle without changing [Ca++]i. In this preparation, NE increased both [Ca++]i and muscle tension and sequential addition of CCh relaxed the muscle with a small decrease in [Ca++]i, suggesting that Ca++ sensitivity of contractile elements is decreased. In Ca+(+)-free solution, CCh induced a transient increase in [Ca++]i and a decrease in muscle tension only in the presence of endothelium. HIS showed similar effects as CCh. By contrast, sodium nitroprusside decreased [Ca++]i and relaxed the muscle in NE-stimulated aorta with or without endothelium. These results suggest that CCh and HIS increase [Ca++]i in the endothelial cells which regulates the synthesis and/or release of endothelium-derived relaxing factor. Endothelium-derived relaxing factor may decrease [Ca++]i in the smooth muscle cells and also decrease Ca++ sensitivity of contractile elements resulting in vasodilatation.\r"

The current study was initiated to identify a rich source of SP receptor that would be amenable for studying the regulatory mechanism of the receptor. By using a radioligand receptor binding technique, sheep ileal smooth muscle membranes showed a much higher density of [3H]SP specific binding than other non-neural rat or sheep tissues and organs surveyed. Of the protease inhibitors tested, only phosphoramidon, a specific and potent enkephalinase inhibitor, prevented the degradation of [3H]SP and enhanced [3H]SP binding to the membrane. [3H]SP binding to the specific binding sites in the membranes was time-dependent and reached a steady state after 60 min at 22 degrees C in 25 mM Tris.NH3 (pH 7.4). Calcium and magnesium ions enhanced [3H]SP specific binding. Saturation binding studies showed that the dissociation constant (KD) and the density of maximum binding sites for [3H]SP specific binding were 0.54 nM and 83 fmol/mg of protein, respectively. The specificity of the [3H]SP labeled sites was SP greater than (4-11) SP greater than eledoisin greater than spantide greater than neurokinin-A greater than D-Pro2D-Phe7D-Trp9-SP.

  ".W": "The mechanism by which exposure to 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) produces thymic atrophy and cell-mediated immune suppression in experimental animals is poorly understood. A previous study from our laboratory found that terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-synthesizing lymphocyte stem cell populations in fetal liver and neonatal bone marrow, but not thymus, were profoundly altered after perinatal TCDD exposure, implying that a defect in the prothymocyte population in liver and marrow may play a role in the etiology of thymic atrophy in TCDD-exposed animals. In this report, we present results of experiments designed to directly assess the prothymocyte compartment in mice exposed to TCDD perinatally by examining the ability of these stem cells to reconstitute an irradiated thymus. Maternal TCDD exposure (15 micrograms/kg) caused a significant impairment of both fetal liver and neonatal bone marrow prothymocyte activity. These alterations occurred at tissue concentrations less than 200 fg of TCDD per mg. TCDD treatment also resulted in a mild reduction in colony-forming unit-spleen in these organs and a decrease in colony-forming unit-granulocyte-macrophage in fetal and neonatal liver, but not bone marrow. Overall, these data provide evidence that alterations to early stages of T-lymphopoiesis, at the level of the prothymocyte, may be involved in the development of TCDD-induced thymic atrophy and cell-mediated immunosuppression.\r"

In Ca(++)-containing solution, PDB (2.5 x 10(-8) to 10(-6) M) increased in a concentration-dependent manner the amplitude of the electrically induced contraction, but had no effect on the resting tension. PDB (10(-7) M) had a dual action, stimulatory then inhibitory, on contractions evoked by K(+)-rich (40 mM K+) solution or oxytocin. The inhibitory effect appeared more rapidly and the percentage of inhibition was increased for 10(-6) M PDB, which in addition abolished completely oxytocin-induced contraction after 20 min of application. PDB also reduced the amplitude of transient contraction evoked by oxytocin in Ca(++)-free solution. In saponin-skinned strips, 10(-7) M PDB increased the contraction induced by pCa ranging from 7 to 6, whereas 10(-6) M PDB reduced all Ca(++)-activated contractions from pCa = 7 to pCa = 5. PDB had no significant effect on the Ca(++)-uptake and the Ca(++)-release mechanisms of the intracellular Ca(++)-store. All of the effects of PDB were antagonized by the addition of 1-(5-isoquinolinesulfonyl)-2-methylpiperazine (2 x 10(-5) M). In addition, the inactive phorbol 13,20-diacetate (10(-8) to 10(-6) M) had no effect on the mechanical activity in uterus. These results suggest the existence of different sites of action of PDB in rat uterus, via the activation of protein kinase C: 1) contractile machinery; 2) potential-dependent Ca channels; and 3) phospholipase C.\r"

AZT was filtered freely and subsequently secreted, reabsorption being of minor importance. Probenecid, the classical inhibitor organic anion secretion, decreased AZT secretion. AZT, on the other hand, decreased p-aminohippurate secretion. These observations demonstrate that AZT is secreted by the organic anion secretory mechanisms. Cimetidine, an organic cation, also decreased AZT secretion at a concentration which did not inhibit the secretion of the organic anion, p-aminohippurate. This suggests that AZT might also be transported by the mechanisms secreting organic cations. However, as AZT did not inhibit the secretion of the organic cation tetraethylammonium, it cannot be concluded that AZT is transported by the mechanisms secreting organic cations.\r"

  ".W": "6-Nitroquipazine (DU 24565; 6-nitro 2-piperazinylquinoline) is a very potent 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT; serotonin) uptake inhibitor. It has been demonstrated very recently that [3H]-6-nitroquipazine is a suitable radioligand for studying 5-HT uptake sites. The present study evaluates [3H]6-nitroquipazine as a radioligand for in vivo labeling of 5-HT uptake sites in mouse brain. Very high uptake of radioactivity in the brain after i.v. administration of [3H]-6-nitroquipazine was shown. Regional distribution of the radioactivity in mouse brain 3 hr after injection of [3H]-6-nitroquipazine was in the order (highest to lowest) hypothalamus greater than midbrain greater than striatum greater than hippocampus greater than cerebral cortex greater than medulla oblongata greater than cerebellum. The regional distribution of in vivo [3H]-6-nitroquipazine binding in mouse brain was highly correlated with that in rat brain obtained from previous in vitro binding studies. Coadministration of carrier 6-nitroquipazine (5 mg/kg) significantly decreased the radioactivity in the hypothalamus, whereas that in the cerebellum and cerebral cortex was increased. Because the cerebellum has very low density of [3H]-6-nitroquipazine binding sites, the radioactivity in the cerebellum could, therefore, reflect the amount on nonspecific binding and free ligand. Kinetic studies showed highest in vivo specific binding 1 hr after injection of [3H]-6-nitroquipazine and slow clearance of specific binding. Specific binding in the hypothalamus was inhibited in a stereoselective manner by the stereoisomers of norzimelidine. Furthermore, specific binding in the hypothalamus was reduced by several 5-HT uptake inhibitors, in a dose-dependent manner.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Changes in systolic and diastolic blood pressure, heart rate and plasma catecholamine concentrations were determined in response to cocaine injected i.a. or i.c.v. in conscious unrestrained rats. Systemically administered cocaine produced brisk, transient dose-related increases in systolic and diastolic pressure at doses of 0.05 to 5 mg/kg i.a. Plasma catecholamine concentrations increased in a dose-related manner, reaching peak levels at 5 to 10 min after i.a. cocaine injection. Only the higher doses of cocaine induced reflex vagal bradycardia that was blocked by atropine (0.4 mg/kg i.a.). Propranolol (1 mg/kg i.a.) prolonged the duration of cocaine-induced hypertension and bradycardia. Ganglionic blockade with chlorisondamine (7.5 mg/kg i.a.) antagonized completely the cardiovascular and sympathoadrenal effects of cocaine, indicating that intact ganglionic transmission is required for full expression of the autonomic responses. Antagonist drugs selective for the D-1 or D-2 dopamine receptors attenuated effects of cocaine on plasma catecholamine concentrations but not on cardiovascular parameters. Intracerebroventricular injection of cocaine (50-250 micrograms) increased systolic pressure and plasma catecholamine concentrations, providing direct evidence for an action of cocaine in the central nervous system. These results demonstrate that cocaine acts centrally to increase sympathetic outflow leading to hypertension and reflex bradycardia in conscious rats.\r"

This was measured by a cough symptom score and by the cough reflex sensitivity to inhaled capsaicin in a double blind, randomized, cross-over study comparing the effects of placebo with sulindac, 200 mg daily for 1 week. We studied six hypertensive patients with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor-associated cough and six patients with an idiopathic, dry, unproductive cough, all of whom had an increase in the sensitivity of the cough reflex. There was no change in blood pressure control in the hypertensive patients during sulindac therapy. The patients with the angiotensin converting enzyme-associated cough had a significant reduction in the cough symptom score and also a significant increase in the dose of capsaicin causing two or more coughs (threshold sensitivity) and that causing five or more coughs (near maximum response) during sulindac therapy as compared to placebo. In those patients with idiopathic, dry, unproductive cough, sulindac did not alter the symptom of cough or the cough reflex response to capsaicin. These results suggest that prostaglandins may be involved in cough associated with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor therapy, but are less likely to be important in the pathogenesis of more common dry coughs of unknown cause.\r"

  ".U": "91012124\r", 
  ".W": "The response of guinea pig trachea to 5-hydroxytryptamine (serotonin; 5-HT) was investigated by studying tracheal strips suspended in organ chambers for isometric tension measurements. Serotonin concentrations of 0.1 to 10 microM produced concentration-dependent contractions, whereas at higher concentrations (10-300 microM) the agonist caused concentration-dependent relaxations. The 5-HT2 antagonist ketanserin shifted the bimodal 5-HT response-curve to the right (pA2 for ketanserin was 8.98). The 5-HT1A agonist, (+)-8-hydroxy-2-(di-N-propylamino)tetralin hydrobromide and 5-HT3 antagonist, ICS 205930 (3-tropanyl-indole-3-carboxylate) had no effect on the 5-HT-response curve. Incubation with atropine resulted in a depression of the maximal contractility and an increase in the EC50 without changing the bimodal nature of the concentration-response curve. Hexamethonium was able to block the atropine effect without significantly affecting the 5-HT concentration-response curve. Neither the constriction nor the relaxation was altered by propranolol, chlorpheniramine or capsaicin pretreatment. Histamine and carbachol preconstricted airways were also relaxed by 5-HT in a concentration-dependent fashion and this relaxation was antagonized by ketanserin (pKb for ketanserin in histamine preconstricted airways was 9.4). Epithelial denudation did not inhibit the 5-HT-induced relaxation. 5-HT stimulated inositol-monophosphate production which also exhibited a bimodal response and correlated well with the functional response. The above findings suggest that 5-HT causes both constriction and relaxation of the guinea pig airway, and that both responses are antagonized by a 5-HT2 receptor blocker. In addition, part of the constrictor response of 5-HT is mediated through a cholinergic preganglionic pathway. Finally, inositol-monophosphate production induced by 5-HT correlates with the functional response.\r"

Cells were exposed for 1 hr to AMB, alone or intercalated in small unilamellar vesicles prepared with one of the following phospholipids: dipalmitoylphosphatidyl choline, distearoylphosphatidyl choline or dimyristoylphosphatidyl choline. Although AMB concentrations of 20 microM or less did not increase lactic dehydrogenase release, P1 and MGP uptakes were significantly reduced (50% inhibition) by 2.5 and 5 microM AMB, respectively. AMB toxicity was dose-dependent, up to 20 microM. Analysis of P1 and MGP uptake kinetics, after treatment of the cells with 10 microM AMB, showed that inhibition occurred through a decrease in Vmax (66 and 57% inhibition for P1 and MGP, respectively) without affecting Km value. K+ release appeared for 2.5 microM AMB and increased with higher concentrations. Alteration of Na(+)-dependent uptakes by AMB, which parallels K+ release, may result from an alteration of the sodium gradient. Na(+)-dependent uptakes and K+ release were unaffected by liposomal AMB, even at the highest concentration tested (80 microM). The protective effect of liposomes was the same regardless of the phospholipid used.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Tetrodotoxin reduced N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-evoked release of adenosine by 35% but virtually abolished [3H]norepinephrine release. Although [3H]norepinephrine release from rat cortical slices evoked by 500 microM NMDA was abolished by 1.2 mM Mg++, which produces a voltage-sensitive, uncompetitive block of NMDA-channels, adenosine release was increased in the presence of Mg++. Partial depolarization with 12 mM K+ relieved the Mg++ block of 500 microM NMDA-evoked [3H]norepinephrine release but did not affect adenosine release, indicating that a Mg++ requirement for the adenosine release process per se cannot account for this discrepancy. NMDA was 33 times more potent in releasing adenosine than [3H]norepinephrine. At submaximal concentrations of NMDA (10 and 20 microM), adenosine release was augmented in Mg+(+)-free medium. Although a high concentration of the uncompetitive NMDA antagonist MK-801 [(+)-5-methyl-10,11,dihydro-5H-dibenzo[a,d]cyclohepten-5-10-imine maleate] (3 microM) blocked NMDA-evoked release of [3H]norepinephrine and adenosine, a lower concentration (300 nM) decreased NMDA-evoked [3H]norepinephrine release by 66% without affecting adenosine release. These findings suggest that maximal adenosine release occurs when relatively few NMDA receptors are activated, raising the possibility that spare receptors exist for NMDA-evoked adenosine release. Rather than acting as a protectant against excessive NMDA excitation, released adenosine might provide an inhibitory threshold which must be overcome for NMDA-mediated neurotransmission to proceed.\r"

In both absence and presence of cyproheptadine, the supernatant-induced contraction of intact arteries was significantly larger than that of endothelium-removed arteries. The cyproheptadine-resistant contraction by the supernatant of intact arteries was attenuated by aspirin, OKY-046 (a thromboxane A2 synthetase inhibitor) and ONO-3708 (a thromboxane A2 antagonist), whereas such contraction of endothelium-removed arteries was not affected by these agents. The concentrations of serotonin, ATP and ADP in the supernatant used here were approximately 3, 67 and 44 micrograms/ml, respectively. The mixed solution of serotonin, ATP and ADP, at the same concentrations as the supernatant, also induced cyproheptadine-resistant, endothelium-dependent contractions in intact arteries. The contraction induced by the mixed solution in intact arteries was also attenuated by aspirin, OKY-046 and ONO-3708.

The central and peripheral effects of physostigmine were evaluated in C57BL/6 mice using a battery of behavioral and physiological tests that included respiratory rate, Y maze crossing and rearing activities, heart rate and body temperature. With the exception of the heart rate test, which was blocked by a peripheral muscarinic antagonist, all responses to physostigmine measured in the test battery seem to be mediated centrally. Sensitivity to physostigmine and to nicotine and oxotremorine were examined as were nicotinic and muscarinic receptors after continuous infusion of physostigmine. Mice (C57BL/6) continuously infused with physostigmine (0.1 mg/kg/h) for 10 days developed marked tolerance to physostigmine and exhibited a slight decrease in sensitivity to nicotine; sensitivity to oxotremorine was largely unaltered. Chronic physostigmine treatment resulted in a 62% inhibition of AChE activity and elicited a significant increase in the amount of L-[3H] nicotine binding in midbrain, hippocampus, striatum and colliculi; alpha-[125I]bungarotoxin and [3H]quinuclidinyl benzilatl binding were not changed. Although physostigmine treatment might partially reverse the reduction of brain nicotinic receptors seen with Alzheimer's disease, it is questionable whether it would be effective for a prolonged period since the up-regulated nicotinic receptors may not have normal function.\r"

Female Sprague-Dawley rats were treated with saline or an escalating dose regimen of amphetamine for 4 weeks and withdrawn from treatment for either 2 or 4 weeks. Thirty minutes before sacrifice, rats in both groups were given a challenge dose of either saline or 1.0 mg/kg of amphetamine. In striatal membranes from rats chronically treated with saline and withdrawn 4 weeks, calmodulin increased SKF38393-stimulated adenylyl cyclase activity by 195% over that seen in the presence of GTP alone. In contrast, this pronounced potentiative interaction was absent in rats chronically treated with amphetamine. The lack of potentiation by calmodulin was independent of length of withdrawal from the drug or amphetamine challenge. Although the repeated amphetamine treatment abolished the potentiative response to calmodulin, this treatment significantly increased the calmodulin content in the striatal cytosol by 40%. Heightened responsiveness of several dopamine-related neurochemical activities was evident after an amphetamine challenge to rats that had been treated repeatedly with amphetamine. A challenge dose of 1 mg/kg of amphetamine decreased SKF38393-stimulated adenylyl cyclase activity in amphetamine-treated but not saline-treated rats. The degree of desensitization induced by amphetamine challenge was heightened with increased length of withdrawal.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Modulation of [3H]NE release was studied in rat urinary bladder strips prelabeled with [3H]NE. [3H]NE uptake occurred in strips from the bladder base and body, but was very prominent in the base where the noradrenergic innervation is most dense. Electrical field stimulation markedly increased [3H]NE outflow from the superfused tissue. The quantity of [3H]NE release was approximately equal during three consecutive periods of stimulation. Activation of presynaptic muscarinic receptors by 1.0 microM oxotremorine reduced [3H]NE release to 46% of the control. Atropine (1 microM) blocked the effect of oxotremorine and increased the release to 147% of predrug control levels. Activation of presynaptic alpha-2 adrenoceptors by 1 microM clonidine reduced [3H]NE release to 55% of control. Yohimbine blocked the action of clonidine and increased the release to 148% of control. The release of [3H]NE from the bladder base and body was increased by both 1 microM atropine (to 167% and 174% of control, respectively) and 1 microM yohimbine (to 286% and 425% of control, respectively). Atropine and yohimbine administered in combination had similar facilitatory effects as when administered alone. We conclude that the release of [3H]NE from adrenergic nerve endings in electrically stimulated bladder strips is modulated via endogenous transmitters acting on both muscarinic and alpha-2 adrenergic presynaptic receptors and that the latter provide the most prominent control.\r"

EXP3174 is a major metabolite generated after the oral dosing of 2-n-butyl-4-chloro-5-hydroxymethyl-1-[(2'-(1H- tetrazol-5-yl)biphenyl-4-yl)methyl]imidazole, potassium salt in rats. It displaced [3H]angiotensin II (AII) from its specific binding sites in rat adrenal cortical membranes with an IC50 of 3.7 x 10(-8) M. In the isolated rabbit aorta, EXP3174 caused nonparallel shifts to the right of the AII concentration-contractile response curves and reduced the maximal response by 30 to 40% with an apparent pA2 value of 10.09 and a KB value of 10(-10) M. At 10(-6) M, EXP3174 did not alter the contractile responses to norepinephrine and KCl. In the spinal pithed rat, EXP3174 at 0.03 to 0.3 mg/kg i.v. also inhibited the pressor responses to AII and angiotensin III noncompetitively and did not change the pressor responses to vasopressin and norepinephrine. When given i.v. and cumulatively to normotensive rats at 0.003 to 0.3 mg/kg, EXP3174 did not alter blood pressure but inhibited the pressor response to AII. In conscious renal artery-ligated rats, EXP3174 decreased blood pressure with an i.v. ED30 of 0.038 mg/kg and a p.o. ED30 of 0.66 mg/kg. These results demonstrate that EXP3174 is a selective and noncompetitive AII receptor antagonist and lacks agonistic effect. As EXP3174 is a potent antihypertensive agent, it may be responsible for part of the antihypertensive effect of DuP 753 in rats.\r"

  ".W": "In several studies in guinea pig ileum or rat colon a beta adrenoceptor with characteristics distinct from beta-1 or beta-2 receptors has been observed and has been denoted as \"atypical\" beta adrenoceptor. In this study the relaxation of the rat small intestine was investigated, using isolated segments of the rat jejunum. Several beta-1 or beta-2 agonists and antagonists were tested on the rat jejunum preparation, and it was found that nonselective and selective antagonists for beta-1 or beta-2 receptors showed a relatively low affinity, compared to their affinity for beta-1 or beta-2 receptors. BRL 37344, an agonist which has been reported to be selective for the atypical beta adrenoceptor, was more potent although a partial agonist compared to isoprenaline, whereas it is clearly less active than isoprenaline on beta-1 or beta-2 receptors. These findings indicate that beta adrenergic relaxation of the rat small intestine is mediated via atypical beta adrenoceptors. Efforts were made to confirm these findings with binding studies on small intestinal 45,000-g membranes. Competition radioligand binding experiments were performed with the radiolabeled ligand [125I]iodocyanopindolol and the various antagonists which were also tested in the intact rat jejunum preparations. Receptor binding experiments only revealed beta adrenoceptors of the beta-2-subtype, which does not correspond with the results obtained in the jejunum relaxation. Probably the beta-2 receptors found in the binding studies are located on circular smooth muscle cells or on epithelial cells, whereas longitudinal smooth relaxation is mediated by atypical beta adrenoceptors. Atypical beta adrenoceptors were not measured in binding studies probably because [125I]iodocyanopindolol is an unsuitable ligand to label atypical intestinal beta adrenoceptors.\r"

Work was done with type E toxin in three different states: 1) unactivated (post-translational product before proteolytic processing), 2) activated (proteolytically modified product) and 3) denatured. Four different monoclonal antibodies were studied (E3, E14, E17 and E32), three of which were capable of diminishing the potency of the toxin. All four antibodies had approximately equivalent affinity for the unactivated and the activated forms of the toxin. Monoclonals E17 and E32 had little ability to interact with denatured toxin, suggesting they recognized conformational epitopes; monoclonals E3 and E14 retained partial ability to bind to denatured toxin, suggesting they recognized both conformational and linear determinants. When phrenic nerve-hemidiaphragm preparations were exposed to toxin under conditions that allowed binding but retarded internalization, the toxin remained accessible to antibodies. However, when tissues were stimulated in an effort to promote endocytosis, the toxin disappeared from accessibility to antibodies. The data indicate that various antigenic domains remain exposed after binding and suggest that certain parts of the toxin molecule undergo little or no conformational change during binding. The data further indicate that the molecular domains recognized by E14, E17 and E32 are internalized simultaneously.\r"

U-46619 and U-44069 are among the most potent microvascular permeability factors described to date for the conjunctiva; their potency is exceeded only by that reported for leukotrienes D4 and E4. The conjunctival microvascular permeability response to U-46619 was inhibited by the TxA2-antagonists daltroban (BM 13505) and SQ 29548. Prostaglandin (PG) D2 also increased conjunctival microvascular permeability, but was less potent than U-46619 and far less susceptible to pretreatment with daltroban or SQ 29548. PGE2, PGF2 alpha and the prostacyclin analog carbocyclin did not increase conjunctival microvascular permeability. It appears that the conjunctiva exhibits a unique microvascular permeability response to TxA2-mimetics: this view is experimentally supported by the absence of a cutaneous microvascular permeability response to U-46619, U-44069 and carbocyclic-TxA2.\r"

Variations in the sensitivity and potency of the agonists results primarily from the variation in the affinity for the 5-HT2 receptor and less so in the efficacy, alpha-Methyl-5-HT was a full agonist compared to 5-HT. The others were partial agonists. The mean KA values for 5-HT and DOM were 4.71 +/- 0.62 x 10(-7) and 0.36 +/- 0.04 x 10(-7) M, respectively. Contractions to 5-HT and DOM were antagonized by ketanserin with pA2 values being 9.4 and 9.1, respectively, suggesting that they act on the same receptor and that their responses are mediated by 5-HT2 receptors. Contractile responses to 8-hydroxy-dipropylaminotetralin, 2-methyl-5-HT and the phenylpiperazines [m-trifluoromethyl-phenylpiperazine and 1-(3-chlorophenyl) piperazine] were also blocked by ketanserin (10(-8) M), indicating that contractions produced by these agonists were mediated by 5-HT2 receptors. No antagonism by MDL 72222 (3-tropanyl-3,5-dichlorobenzoate) of responses to 5-HT indicates that 5-HT3 receptors are not present in this tissue.\r"

Two doses which produced average MAP fall of 32 to 47 mm Hg were used for comparison. Guanethidine (1 and 3 mg/kg) depressed markedly not only the tilt responses but also responses to BCO and SNS. In contrast, clonidine (2 and 6 micrograms/kg) or dopamine2 receptor agonists, apomorphine (100 and 300 micrograms/kg) and VICO-81 (trans-6,9-dimethoxy-1-n-propyl-1,2,3,4,4a,5,10,10a-octahydrobenzo[g] quinoline, 60 and 200 micrograms/kg), only prolonged the time required for compensation. Apomorphine inhibited BCO reflexes slightly, not affecting SNS-induced responses. However, neither the BCO nor the SNS responses were influenced by VICO-81. On the other hand, serotonin1A receptor agonists, (8-hydroxy-2-di-n-propylaminotetralin, 100 and 300 micrograms/kg) and PM-1000 (10-methyl-11-hydroxyaporphine, 1 and 3 mg/kg), did not inhibit responses to tilt. MAP during tilt was somewhat higher than controls after the two serotonin1A receptor agonists. Although BCO or SNS was not influenced by 8-hydroxy-2-di-n-propylaminotetralin, both responses were depressed slightly by higher doses of PM-1000 (3 mg/kg). To correlate the degree of inhibition on tilt reflex with that on sympathetic neurotransmission after these hypotensive agents, plasma catecholamines, norepinephrine, epinephrine and dopamine, were measured.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

We examined the effects of three fluorinated gamma-butyrolactone derivatives on GABA currents and synaptic currents in cultured hippocampal neurons. alpha-(2,2,2-trifluoroethyl)-alpha-methyl-gamma-butyrolactone was a partial picrotoxin agonist, meaning that like picrotoxin, it blocked GABA currents, but not completely. This action is in marked contrast to that of its parent compound, alpha-ethyl-alpha-methyl-gamma-butyrolactone, which is a mixed inverse agonist/antagonist, enhancing GABA currents at low GABA concentration (less than or equal to 1 microM) and antagonizing picrotoxin block of GABA currents at higher GABA concentrations (approximately 30 microM). The properties of two difluorinated derivatives were found to be very different from the trifluorinated compound. Both alpha-(1,1-difluoroethyl)-alpha-methyl-gamma-butyrolactone and alpha-(1,1-difluoroethyl)-alpha-methyl-gamma-thiobutyrolactone+ ++ dramatically increased the current produced by low concentrations of GABA. The former had less marked inverse agonist effects at higher GABA concentrations but behaved instead like a picrotoxin antagonist. In addition, alpha-(1,1-difluoroethyl)-alpha-methyl-gamma-butyrolactone reduced both excitatory and inhibitory synaptic currents suggesting a separate effect on presynaptic transmitter release through an unknown mechanism. These experiments support the hypothesis that gamma-butyrolactones can have a variety of effects at the picrotoxin receptor and indicate that specific properties of these compounds can be altered drastically by fluorination.\r"

If this premise is correct then 1) specific antagonists of the antidiuretic effect of vasopressin (V2 antagonists) should mimic alpha-2 adrenoceptor stimulation and 2) in the presence of V2 antagonists, the diuretic and natriuretic effect of clonidine should be attenuated. The renal effects of [d(CH2)5,D-Ile2,Ile4]AVP, a specific V2 antagonist, were studied. On the day of the experiment, uninephrectomized rats were anesthetized, and the carotid artery and jugular vein were cannulated for recording blood pressure and saline infusion, respectively. The left kidney was exposed and the ureter cannulated. A 31-gauge needle was advanced into the renal artery to permit direct i.r. infusion of study drugs. Bolus doses of the V2 antagonist (0, 1, 3, 10, or 30 nmol/kg i.v.) produced a dose-related increase in urine volume and free water clearance at all doses tested. Sodium excretion increased only at the higher doses (10 and 30 nmol/kg). This dose-related dissociation in water and then sodium excretion is similar to that observed after i.r. clonidine infusions. In the presence of the V2 antagonist, clonidine (3 micrograms/kg/min) had no effect on urine volume or free water clearance but significantly decreased the excretion of sodium from control. These results demonstrate that V2 antagonists mimic the effects of i.r. clonidine. As well, in the absence of vasopressin (V2 antagonism), the effects of clonidine are attenuated. Moreover, they are also consistent with not only an antidiuretic role for endogenous vasopressin but also an antinatriuretic one.\r"

Apparent Km was 85 +/- 2 microM and Vmax was 8.0 +/- 0.2 nmol/mg of tubular protein per min. Amantadine accumulation was inhibited competitively by quinine and quinidine with Ki values of 32 +/- 3 and 84 +/- 11 microM, respectively (n = 4). Amantadine was also concentrated by renal cortical slices with tissue/medium ratio of 3.3 +/- 0.3 (n = 4). Apparent Km and Vmax were 94.0 +/- 5.2 microM and 1.27 +/- 0.08 nmol/mg of tubular protein per min, respectively (n = 10). Quinine and quinidine again inhibited amantadine accumulation competitively by the slices, with Ki values of 368 +/- 28 and 780 +/- 84 microM, respectively (n = 4). A similar affinity (Km) for amantadine was observed in both preparations. However, the lower Vmax value in the slice system may be due to additional amantadine transport sites with lower capacity, lesser luminal accumulation and/or limited substrate(s) penetration in the cortical slices. In either preparation, quinine and quinidine functioned as competitive inhibitors and stereoselectivity was observed for the (-)-isomer, quinine, over the (+)-isomer, quinidine. Additional transport sites, reduced luminal substrate accumulation and/or diffusional restraints in the slices are also feasible mechanisms in explaining the differences in Ki values between the two preparations, and their relative contributions await further investigation.\r"

  ".W": "(+)-4-Propyl-9-hydroxynaphthoxazine (PHNO) is a highly potent, D2-selective dopamine (DA) receptor agonist. In the present study, we have examined the electrophysiological effects of PHNO on identified nigrostriatal DA (NSDA), mesoaccumbens DA (MADA) and Type I caudate neurons. Intravenous PHNO dose-dependently inhibited the firing rate of NSDA and MADA neurons in both chloral hydrate (CH)-anesthetized rats (ED50 values = 21.2 +/- 1.2 and 26.5 +/- 1.4 ng/kg, respectively) and locally anesthetized, paralyzed rats (ED50 values = 105.0 +/- 1.4 and 109.1 +/- 1.4 ng/kg, respectively). PHNO was significantly more potent in the CH-anesthetized rats. There was a significant, positive correlation between basal firing rate and log ED50 for NSDA neurons in both preparations and for MADA cells only in CH-anesthetized animals. Neither pretreatment with the D1 receptor agonist SKF 38393 nor hemitransection of the forebrain altered the rate-dependent nature of PHNO-induced inhibition of NSDA neurons. Likewise, depletions of serotonin with either p-chlorophenylalanine or 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine failed to alter the rate-dependent PHNO-induced inhibition of NSDA neurons. Iontophoretically applied PHNO inhibited both NSDA and MADA neurons to a similar degree as either DA or the D2 agonist quinpirole. In contrast, the similar effects of PHNO and quinpirole on Type I caudate neurons were significantly different than those of DA. These results suggest that PHNO inhibits midbrain DA neurons via stimulation of somatodendritic autoreceptors and that PHNO exhibits an electrophysiological profile characteristic of D2 agonists. In contrast to quinpirole, however, the rate-dependent nature of PHNO-induced inhibition of these cells was resistant to modulation.\r"

Rabbit platelet aggregation was tested with 1.9 nM PAF, i.e., a concentration producing maximal response, and was completely blocked with 10 microM PCA 4233 and 3 microM 4248 (IC50 values, 2.55 and 1.05 microM, respectively). Human platelet aggregation in platelet-rich plasma was studied with 1 microM PAF, a concentration that caused a response comparable with that of 1.9 nM PAF in rabbit platelets. The IC50 of PCA 4248 for ATP release under these conditions was 3.6 microM. PCA 4248 behaved as a competitive and selective antagonist in [3H]serotonin secretion studies on rabbit platelets, since it displaced rightwards log dose-response curves and lacked any effect on thrombin- and ionophore A23187-induced platelet secretion. A pA2 value of 7.5 was obtained from Schild plots on [3H]serotonin secretion studies. PCA 4248 also produced a dose-dependent inhibition of [3H]PAF binding to human platelets and to human polymorphonuclear leukocytes. These data indicate that PCA 4233 and PCA 4248 belong to a new class of selective PAF-receptor antagonists.\r"

Serosal administration of the neuronal conduction blocker tetrodotoxin (TTX; 0.1 mumol/l), the presynaptic Ca channel blocker omega-conotoxin GVIA (0.1 mumol/l) and the ganglionic-blocking agent hexamethonium (0.1 mmol/l) decreased basal short-circuit current (Isc) across sheets of jejunal mucosa-submusa in vitro. The TTX-induced change in Isc was attributable to an increase in net Cl absorption. Electrical transmural stimulation (ETS; 300 pulses at 0.5, 3 or 10 Hz, 0.5-msec pulse width, 2.8 mA cm-2) of the mucosa-submucosa produced a frequency-dependent increase in Isc and an increase in net anion secretion. TTX, conotoxin and hexamethonium produced concentration-dependent decreases of the ETS-evoked increase in Isc, indicating that ETS depolarizes enteric neurons and suggesting that cholinergic neurons synapsing with submucosal neurons play a significant role in mediating ETS-evoked ion transport. The ETS-induced Isc appears to be mediated by neurons containing acetylcholine but not substance P or vasoactive intestinal polypeptide. These results suggest that submucosal noncholinergic neurons tonically limit Cl but not Na absorption. Electrical depolarization of submucosal neurons evokes anion secretion which appears to be mediated by cholinergic neurons as well as neurons of unknown chemical identity.\r"

  ".W": "The compound 8-)N,N-diethylamino)-octyl-3,4,5-trimethoxybenzoate hydrochloride (TMB-8) had been introduced as an intracellular Ca++ antagonist. We have studied the effects of TMB-8 on electrical and mechanical activity of isolated cardiac tissues in order to estimate its spectrum of action in heart muscle. In spontaneously beating right atria of the guinea pig, TMB-8 (1-100 microM) had a negative chronotropic effect. In left atria, TMB-8 (1-100 microM) induced a frequency-dependent biphasic inotropic effect: A transient increase in force of contraction was followed by a sustained decrease; the latter could be antagonized partially by an increase in [Ca++]o. TMB-8 prolonged the time-to-peak force. At high concentrations of TMB-8 (greater than 10 microM), the electrical stimulation threshold was elevated. TMB-8 (20 microM) competitively inhibited the positive inotropic effect of Bay K 8644 and reduced the magnitude of the positive inotropic and/or chronotropic effects of veratridine, (-)-isoproterenol, forskolin, histamine and (-)-phenylephrine. TMB-8 (30 microM) prolonged the action potential duration (APD) [in particular at 90% of repolarization (APD90)] and the refractory period, and decreased the AP amplitude and Vmax. In right ventricular papillary muscles, TMB-8 (30 microM) shortened the APD (APD20 = APD50 greater than APD90) and the refractory period but hardly affected the AP amplitude and Vmax. The resting membrane potential remained unchanged in both tissues. These findings suggest that in addition to interference with the Ca++ release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum, TMB-8 also affects the membrane conductances for cations.\r"

TMB-8 concentration dependently and reversibly reduced calcium current (ICa) (pD2 5.0). The Ca++ channel blockade was only slightly use dependent. The steady-state inactivation curve of ICa was shifted to more negative membrane potentials by TMB-8; the curve for the normalized conductance of ICa was not significantly affected. The quasi steady-state K+ currents as a measure for K+ conductance were examined by means of slow depolarizing ramp pulses between -120 and +60 mV. In this potential range. TMB-8 (100 microM) reduced quasi steady-state potassium currents. The sodium current sodium current (INa) was investigated at low extracellular Na+ concentration (30 mM) after blocking ICa by Cd++ and reducing K+ currents (Cs+ substituted for K+). Under these conditions, TMB-8 concentration dependently and reversibly decreased INa (pD2 5.3), slightly shifted the steady-state inactivation curve of INa to more negative potentials and shifted the curve for the normalized conductance of INa to more positive potentials. We conclude that TMB-8 possesses both Ca++ channel- and Na+ channel-blocking properties and reduces the membrane K+ conductance. It is speculated that, because of its amphiphilic nature, TMB-8 accumulates at lipid-water interphase of biologic membranes and therefore interferes with the normal function of many membrane proteins.\r"

Serotonin mobilized intracellular Ca++ in a dose-dependent fashion from basal level of 98 +/- 2.7 and up to 211 +/- 5.8 nM with an EC50 value for 5-HT of 0.2 microM. Ketanserin, a 5-HT2 antagonist, reversed the 5-HT (10 microM)-induced Ca++ increase in a dose-dependent manner with an IC50 value of 2 nM. An initial treatment with 10 microM 5-HT abolished the response to a second treatment with 100 microM 5-HT, suggesting that 5-HT evoked an acute desensitization of 5-HT2 receptors in human platelets. Mezerein and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, activators of protein kinase C, inhibited 5-HT-stimulated inositol monophosphate accumulation with IC50 values of 3 and 10 nM, respectively. Furthermore, a protein kinase C inhibitor 1-(5-isoquinolinesulfonyl)-2-methylpiperazine dihydrochloride prevented the protein kinase C activator-induced inhibition against 5-HT-mediated inositol monophosphate accumulation. Mezerein also inhibited 5-HT (10 microM)-mediated Ca++ release with an IC50 value of 3 nM. 1-(5-isoquinolinesulfonyl)-2-methylpiperazine dihydrochloride prevented the inhibition by mezerein of the 5-HT-stimulated Ca++ increase. Moreover, 1-(5-isoquinolinesulfonyl)-2-methylpiperazine dihydrochloride by itself enhanced the Ca++ spike induced by 100 microM 5-HT, the plateau phase induced by 10 microM 5-HT and the second response to 5-HT. These findings suggest that 5-HT2 receptor activation mobilizes intracellular Ca++ in human platelets and that this receptor may be desensitized acutely by a protein kinase C mediated feedback system.\r"

Recent experiments have reported calcium ion to be a cellular mediator of the regulation of electrolyte transport through the enterocyte membrane, especially the Na/H exchange which is partly responsible for the proton gradient energizing the carrier system. In order to assess the in vivo relevance of these data, we studied, in healthy volunteers, the influence of nifedipine, a calcium channel blocking agent, on the intestinal uptake of amoxicillin, a commonly prescribed and well-absorbed aminopenicillin. Results obtained show that 1) intestinal absorption kinetics of amoxicillin follows a zero-order process, which further substantiates the existence of a saturable carrier-mediated process for this antibiotic in humans and 2) calcium channel blockade significantly enhances both absorption rate (by 70%) and bioavailability of amoxicillin (by 21.4%) without modifying its distribution or elimination. These findings might suggest that nifedipine could enhance amoxicillin intestinal uptake by stimulating its active transport.\r"

Obesity was induced by programming pups to overeat immediately after birth and then feeding them a high-fat diet thereafter. Elevations in tail-cuff systolic and mean pressures from 7 through 11 months of age and in plasma insulin at 8 months of age indicated that obese rats had developed borderline hypertension and hyperinsulinemia. Cardiovascular responsiveness was then tested by recording blood pressure, heart rate and renal blood flow from chronically implanted arterial catheters and flow probes while graded doses of the three test drugs were infused intravenously. Heart rate and renal blood flow decreased during pressor responses to angiotensin and phenylephrine and were oppositely increased during depressor responses to isoproterenol. Magnitude of all cardiovascular receptors was dose-dependent. Obese rats had weaker reflex bradycardic responses to angiotensin and phenylephrine than control rats. More importantly, they also had larger renal vasoconstrictor responses to 2 ng/100 g of angiotensin or vasodilator responses to 15 ng/100 of isoproterenol. Whether or not the changes in cardiovascular responsiveness were related to hyperinsulinemia was undetermined. Our results suggest that, in addition to being overweight, slightly hypertensive and hyperinsulinemic, obese Oscai rats have impaired baroreflexes and a renal vascular bed more responsive to beta adrenergic vasodilation.\r"

A dose-dependent increase in the extracellularly recorded firing of cells was observed when 10(-6) to 10(-4) M acetylcholine (ACh) were locally applied to the cells in the vicinity of the target cell being recorded using a microinflow method. During voltage clamp recording at the resting membrane potential, ACh induced two different sequential inward currents: a transient current with a rapid rising phase (fast response) and an apparent inward current with a slow rising phase (slow response). The membrane conductance increased during the ACh-induced fast response, and it subsequently decreased during the slow response. The amplitude of the fast response decreased when the holding potential was shifted to depolarized levels, whereas the amplitude of the slow response increased with depolarization. Nicotine produced fast depolarization and a transient inward current that was reduced by the membrane depolarization. In contrast, muscarine induced a slow depolarization and an apparent inward current that increased with depolarization. Muscarine also reduced the inward K+ current that had been induced by the application of a high K+ medium to the outside of the cell at the resting membrane potential. It is suggested that muscarinic excitation is triggered by the suppression of K+ channels that are open at potentials near the resting membrane potential. The present results indicate that ACh-induced excitation of adrenal chromaffin cells involves two separate mechanisms mediated by nicotinic and muscarinic receptors.\r"

These studies were complemented with experiments using soluble aggregates of immunoglobulin G (A-IgG), bacterial endotoxin and the cytokine tumor necrosis factor as putative inducers of the generation of endogenous PAF. Significant inhibition of PAF-induced systemic hypotension was observed with i.v. PCA 4248 at doses of 0.3 to 1 mg/kg (IC50 value, 0.45 mg/kg, with PAF 0.33 micrograms/kg). Reversal of the hypotension was rapidly observed when PCA 4248 was administered after PAF. The extravasation induced by 1 microgram/kg PAF was also blocked by PCA 4248 (IC50 value, 0.36 mg/kg). Inhibition of the extravasation induced by A-IgG and endotoxin was also provided by PCA 4248 at the dose of 1 mg/kg, and lasted for at least 1 hr in the experiments carried out with endotoxin, which caused extravasation with a temporal pattern more protracted than that of PAF and A-IgG. Intradermal extravasation induced by PAF reached a maximum at 30 min after injection, and was also inhibited by PCA 4248. In contrast, PCA 4248 caused a less remarkable, but statistically significant reduction of the intradermal extravasation caused by tumor necrosis factor. Pretreatment of mice with an oral dose of 30 mg/kg PCA 4248, 5 min before challenge with PAF (LD84 = 80 micrograms/kg PAF, i.v.) increased the survival rate from 16% to 68%.

Burst-like, single-channel currents with brief openings were recorded during cell-attached or cell-free patch recording when the pipette solution contained high K+ media (70-140 mM), and the currents were recorded at potentials near the resting membrane potential. The amplitude and frequency of channel openings were dependent on the membrane potential and the K+ concentration of the external medium. Moreover, the single-channel currents observed with high K+ outside the membrane during inside-out recording were suppressed by the addition of a K+ channel blocker, tetraethylammonium, inside the membrane. These results suggest that the single K+ currents recorded in the present study had properties similar to those of the resting or muscarine-activated K+ currents in atrioventricular cells of the rabbit heart. During cell-attached patch recording with the high K+ medium in the recording pipette, muscarine at concentrations of 10(-5) to 10(-4) M dose dependently decreased the frequency of the channel openings but did not affect the current-voltage relationship or the time constants of open and close time histograms. These results indicate that muscarinic-induced suppression of K+ currents is caused by a decrease in the number of active K+ channels at the resting membrane potential.\r"

CoQ as well as captopril and the combined treatment significantly improved exercise capacity as evaluated by lactate production during a standardized treadmill exercise test. No significant changes in heart rate or mean blood pressure were observed during the study in the captopril-treated group. CoQ treatment increased the maximum heart rate significantly, whereas no effect on mean blood pressure was observed. Both captopril and CoQ decreased pulmonary congestion. Furthermore, the data may suggest that captopril prevents right ventricular hypertrophy seen in placebo-treated rats with large infarcts. This was not observed after CoQ treatment. Captopril treatment improved 3-month probability of survival (93%) as compared with placebo (74%) (P less than .05). CoQ and the combined treatment tended to improve survival, but this was, however, not statistically significant.\r"

Previous work in this laboratory has shown A-4 and A-5 to be inhibitors of the sodium-dependent, high affinity choline uptake system (SDHACU). Their effects on choline transport were characterized further using neuroblastoma 41A3 cells. These cells rapidly take up choline through two separate mechanisms: a SDHACU system and a sodium-independent, low affinity uptake system (SILACU). A-4, A-5 and HC-3 decreased 5 microM choline transport in a dose-dependent fashion. The compounds were unable to decrease choline transport at 250 microM choline suggesting that they are inactive with respect to SILACU. All three compounds significantly increased the Km but not the Vmax for the SDHACU system, suggesting a competitive mechanism of inhibition. Ki values ranged from 18 to 25 microM for A-4, 20 to 26 microM for A-5 and 68 to 75 microM for HC-3. Dose-response curves for inhibition of choline transport by A-5 and HC-3 were not changed by a 24-hr pre-exposure of the cells to each inhibitor. However, after a 24-hr pre-exposure to A-4, a significantly different dose-response curve was obtained compared to the dose-response curve for A-4 in untreated cells. After a 24-hr pre-exposure, a 4-hr recovery period was sufficient to remove the effect of each compound. These data suggest that A-4 and A-5, like HC-3, inhibit the SDHACU, competitively and reversibly.\r"

  ".W": "Verapamil elimination kinetics and pharmacodynamic effects were studied in 29 healthy individuals (23-81 years of age) after single i.v. doses (0.15-0.22 mg/kg) and during infusions to reach stable plasma verapamil concentrations of 28 +/- 11, 57 +/- 19 and 112 +/- 26 ng/ml (mean +/- S.D.). Aging prolonged verapamil elimination (P less than .008): elimination half-life of 218 +/- 91 min in young (ages 20-39), 280 +/- 78 min in middle-aged (40-59) and 288 +/- 73 min in elderly (greater than 60). After single verapamil doses. 1) heart rate increased with lesser increases in elderly subjects; 2) blood pressure decreased (P = .006) with greater decreases in elderly subjects; 3) spontaneous P-R intervals increased with lesser increases in elderly subjects but, 4) atrioventricular conduction times increased during transesophageal pacing without detectable age differences in responses. During steady-state infusions, 1) heart rate during sinus rhythm was unchanged but atrioventricular dissociation with junctional rhythms developed in elderly subjects (3/9); 2) blood pressure decreased with greater decreases in the elderly; 3) spontaneous P-R intervals increased with lesser increases in the elderly but no age differences in paced P-R interval changes were detected at equivalent verapamil concentrations; 4) heart rate variation (during sinus rhythm) decreased in an age-independent manner as measured by decreases in the S.D. of R-R intervals and decreased power spectral content with greatest changes seen in high frequency (respiratory) content; and 5) heart rate and blood pressure responses to cold pressor and handgrip testing were not attenuated by verapamil. In conclusion, aging prolongs verapamil elimination and alters dynamic responses to verapamil with greater sinus node depression and hypotensive effects in elderly vs. younger subjects. Although less spontaneous P-R interval prolongation was seen on ECG of the elderly vs. young, underlying atrioventricular conduction was prolonged by verapamil independent of age as shown by results when pacing was used to eliminate frequency-dependent effects caused by differing heart rate responses.\r"

Microinjection of AII (2-2000 ng) in the AP of renal hypertensive rats elicited a dose-dependent decrease in blood pressure, heart rate and renal sympathetic nerve activity. Similar effects were observed in the NTS. In the NT rats, low doses of AII (2 and 20 ng), either in the AP or NTS, were also depressor. High doses of AII (200-2000 ng) were needed to observe a modest pressor effect in the NT animals. A decrease in heart rate and renal sympathetic activity was observed with the pressor effect. The AII-antagonist, [Sar1,Val5,Ala8]-AII, into the NTS or AP increased blood pressure and heart rate and inhibited the cardiovascular effects of low doses of AII in both group of rats. In contrast, [Sar1,Val5,Ala8]AII did not affect the pressor action of high doses of AII in the NT group. While the microinjection of AII into the rostroventrolateral medulla did not produce any significant cardiovascular effect in the renal hypertensive group, it resulted in a modest pressor effect in the NT rats. These results indicate that acute activation of AII receptors in the AP or NTS does not contribute to the pressor effect of AII in renal hypertensive rats.\r"

This proteinuria was associated with lymphadenopathy and splenomegaly, as well as changes in lymph node cell phenotype and histologic changes in the glomeruli. Oral administration of SK&F 105685 starting at 12 weeks of age prevented the increased urinary protein loss, inhibited the histologic changes in the glomeruli, reduced the increase in spleen and lymph node weight and modified the phenotypic profile of the lymphoid cells. SK&F 105685 appears to act by increasing the number/activity of nonspecific suppressor cells in MRL/lpr mice. On the basis of this evidence, we conclude that SK&F 105685 can attenuate the progression of renal damage in MRL/lpr mice by exerting a unique effect on cells which may be involved in the autoimmune process.\r"

The proportion of beta-(full length) to gamma-(minus exon 4) PPT mRNA was invariant (40/60) among the tissues tested. Because these brain regions receive prominent dopaminergic innervations, the effects of repeated treatment with dopamine antagonists (antipsychotic drugs) on PPT gene expression were assessed. The prototypical dopamine antagonists haloperidol and chlorpromazine decreased striatal PPT mRNA, had no effect on PPT mRNA in the nucleus accumbens or bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, and increased septal PPT mRNA levels. In contrast, the atypical antipsychotic drugs clozapine and l-sulpiride did not alter striatal or septal PPT mRNA, but increased PPT mRNA content in the nucleus accumbens and bed nucleus. The correlation between the effects of typical and atypical antipsychotic drugs on rat striatal and limbic PPT gene expression and their clinical side effects and therapeutic efficacy is discussed.\r"

X-ray film was exposed to sections of heart labeled with (-)-[125I]-cyanopindolol in the absence or presence of ICI 118,551 (70 nM) to block beta-2 adrenoceptors, CGP 20712A (100 nM) to block beta-1 adrenoceptors or (-)-propranolol (1 microM) to define nonspecific binding. Quantitative autoradiography was performed using computer-assisted image processing and the AVID system. The proportions of beta-1 and beta-2 adrenoceptors were determined by the extent of inhibition of (-)-[125I]cyanopindolol binding by CGP 20712A (100 nM) together with equations which take into account the differing affinities of ligands for beta-1 and beta-2 adrenoceptors. In vehicle (1 mM HCl)-treated animals there was a higher density and proportion of beta-2 adrenoceptors in the atrioventricular node, bundle of His and right and left bundle branches than in myocardium. Chronic administration of (-)-isoproterenol produced marked loss of beta-2 adrenoceptor binding in all regions of the atrioventricular conducting system, surrounding myocardium, cardiac valves and the smooth muscle of the aorta accompanied by less pronounced effects on beta-1 adrenoceptors. Beta-1 adrenoceptors were significantly reduced only in the left bundle branch whereas there were trends toward a reduction in the right bundle branch, bundle of His and an increase in the atrioventricular node. There was no alteration in beta-1 adrenoceptor density in myocardium. Loss of beta adrenoceptor binding produced by (-)-isoproterenol was mainly confined to beta-2 adrenoceptors.\r"

DA release was measured in the presence of domperidone and nomifensine to avoid complications associated with autoreceptor alteration of and reuptake of released DA. This release is inhibited by magnesium. Therefore, all experiments were performed in the absence of this ion. The competitive NMDA antagonists D-(-)2-amino-5-phosphonopentanoic acid and 3-[(+-)-2-carboxypiperazin-4-yl]-propyl-1-phosphonic acid and the noncompetitive antagonists (+)-5-methyl-10,11-dihydro-5H-dibenzo[a,d]cyclohepten-5,10-imine and phencyclidine also inhibit NMDA-stimulated release. Glycine enhances NMDA-stimulated release and can release [3H]DA in the absence of added NMDA. Release stimulated by glycine alone is not affected by 3-[(+-)-2-carboxypiperazine-4-yl]-propyl-1-phosphonic acid. Conversely, if the glycine antagonist 3-amino-1-hydroxy-2-pyrrolidone or 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione is included, NMDA elicits less release of [3H]DA. This inhibition can be overcome by increasing the concentration of glycine. The kappa-selective opioid agonist trans-(+-)-3,4-dichloro-N-methyl-N-[2-(1-pyrrolidinyl) cyclohexyl]-benzene-acetamide is also capable of inhibiting the NMDA-stimulated release of [3H]DA from guinea pig and rat striatum.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "In solutions containing Mg2+ and Ca2+, ATP is in equilibrium between the tetrabasic form (ATP4-) and its bidentate coordination complexes, i.e., MgATP2- and CaATP2-. We sought evidence to determine whether contractions of the smooth muscle of the guinea pig vas deferens to ATP are in response to ATP4- or its bidentate complexes. Contractions to ATP were elicited in seven modified Krebs-Henseleit solutions containing varied concentrations of free and total Mg2+ and Ca2+ to alter the concentration of ATP4- at given ATPtotal concentrations. As the concentration of Mg2+ increased the concentration of ATP required to stimulate contraction to an equivalent degree also increased. Regardless of the free or total Mg2+ and Ca2+ concentrations, response magnitude was generally correlated with [ATP4-]. This suggests that ATP4- is the agonist at the P2x purinoceptor of the guinea pig vas deferens. The potency of ATP4- is high; the threshold, occurring at approximately 1 nM ATP4-, is 1000-fold less than that for norepinephrine. The implications of ATP4- as agonist are discussed in relation to adenine nucleotide potency, metabolism and P2 purinoceptor classification.\r"

Under pH-driven conditions in BBMV, [3H]NMN transport was cis inhibited approximately 30% by the naturally occurring polyamines (cadaverine, putrescine, spermine and spermidine) and nearly 90% by methylglyoxal bis(guanylhydrazone) (MGBG), a synthetic polyamine, mepiperphenidol and cimetidine, classical organic cation transport inhibitors. In the absence of a pH gradient, the capability of these agents to block [3H]NMN transport was diminished. The capability of these compounds to translocate the membrane was assessed by examining the phenomenon of counterflow. TEA, mepiperphenidol and MGBG produced trans stimulation of TEA uptake, whereas putrescine did not. Kinetic studies revealed that both putrescine and MGBG affected the Km value for TEA transport while having a minimal effect on the Vmax value. These results are most consistent with competitive inhibition. The specificity of polyamine inactivation of organic cation transport was assessed by examining what effect they had on the transport of another brush border transporter, D-glucose. These agents did not inhibit D-glucose transport. In addition, the effect of polyamines on the transport of organic cations in BLMV was studied. Only MGBG, cimetidine and mepiperphenidol inhibited organic cation transport. The results indicate that endogenous polyamines cis inhibited the organic cation transporter in BBMV competitively, whereas the exogenous polyamine MGBG cis inhibited competitively and produced trans stimulation. In contrast in BLMV, only MGBG was an effective inhibitor.\r"

However, this agent has significant hepato- and cardiotoxicity and preclinical preliminary experiments indicate potential pneumotoxic effects. Accordingly, we sought to evaluate the acute effects of [Au(dppe)2]+ on pulmonary removal of two radioiodinated benzylguanidines [metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) and 3-iodo-4-amino-benzylguanidine (AIBG)]. Pulmonary removal of MIBG or AIBG was measured by application of indicator dilution techniques in rabbit lungs, perfused with Kreb's bicarbonate (3% albumin; 50 ml/min). A bolus containing either [125I]MIBG or--AIBG and [99mTc]sulfur colloid was injected into the pulmonary artery and effluent was diverted to an in-line nuclear detection system. In initial experiments we characterized some pharmacokinetic aspects of the disposition of these amines. Removal of MIBG [R(MIBG)] and R(AIBG) were 59 +/- 3% (n = 14) and 24 +/- 2% (n = 7), respectively. Addition of unlabeled norepinephrine, MIBG or AIBG (3-100 nmol) to the injection caused similar dose-dependent reductions in removal of either amine. Lowering the temperature (13 degrees C) or reducing the sodium concentration caused significant reductions in removal. After 15 min of perfusion with [Au(dppe)2]+ (50 micrograms/ml), perfusion pressure doubled and R(MIBG) and R(AIBG) were each decreased significantly. At 30 min, perfusion pressure returned to control values whereas there was still a 36 and 61% reduction in R(MIBG) and R(AIBG), respectively. These data confirm that removal of benzylguanidines involves a saturable, sodium- and temperature-dependent process similar to that responsible for the removal of norepinephrine.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Forskolin (25 microM) produced a rapid and marked vasodilation in segments contracted with PDB. The 4 alpha-phorbol 12,13-didecanoate, an inactive compound, induced slight vasodilation. Preincubation with nifedipine diminished the responses elicited by PDB at all concentrations used. Ca-free medium containing 3 mM ethylene glycol bis(beta-aminoethyl ether)-N,N'-tetraacetic acid (EGTA), but not 1 mM, markedly reduced the phorbol-induced responses at concentrations up to 10 nM. Nifedipine (0.1 microM) and forskolin (25 microM) produced a rapid and marked relaxation of PDB (10 nM)-evoked contractions in segments incubated in a Ca-free solution (1 mM EGTA), but PBD responses in 3 mM EGTA were not affected by nifedipine. PDB (10 and 100 nM) practically did not modify K-induced contractions, but reduced vasoconstrictions elicited by different norepinephrine concentrations; this effect was phorbol concentration and preincubation time-dependent. These results indicate that: 1) PDB induced PKC activation and contraction mainly produced by Ca entry (essentially at low PDB concentrations) through dihydropyridine-sensitive Ca channels; 2) the activated PKC has elevated sensitivity for Ca; 3) PKC may be involved in the alpha adrenoceptors desensitization, but did not play an important role in the norepinephrine-induced contraction in these arteries.\r"

Approximate concentrations required to produce an equal incidence were 0.5 mM, 1.0 mM, 0.1 mM and 0.75 mM, respectively. In contrast, 2.6-dimethylacetaminophen and N-acetyl-p-benzoquinoneimine failed to produce elevated incidences of abnormal neurulation unaccompanied by marked growth retardation. However, with intra-amniotic microinjections, 3-hydroxyacetaminophen and N-acetyl-p-benzoquinoneimine were roughly equipotent for eliciting abnormal neurulation, whereas 3-methoxyacetaminophen required greater than 30-fold higher concentrations. This suggests that N-acetyl-p-benzoquinoneimine does not readily transit the visceral yolk sac and would likely not be a major factor in APAP-elicited neural tube abnormalities unless generated in target tissues. The differential effects produced by two dimethylated (2.6 and 3.5) APAP analogs further suggest that sulfhydryl oxidation is associated more closely than sulfhydryl conjugation with the neurulation defect. Intra-amniotic microinjections of large quantities (3500 ng) of 7-hydroxy-2-acetylaminofluorene (7-OH-AAF) or APAP failed to produce the specific neurulation defect. Microinjections of 7-OH-AAF into the exocoelomic cavity effected the characteristic abnormal neurulation. Conversion by conceptal homogenates of 7-OH-AAF was roughly 7- to 8-fold more rapid than conversion of APAP to respective catechol metabolites, and specific activities in yolk sac tissues were greater than those in the embryo. Rates of conceptal conversion to the quinoneimine were approximately 2- to 3-fold lower than catechol generation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Relative potencies of nine muscarinic agonists as activators of autoreceptors regulating [3H]acetylcholine release or of postsynaptic receptors, stimulating inositol monophosphate (IP1) formation were determined in rat hippocampal slices. The agonists could be divided into three groups: 1) full agonists at both sites included oxotremorine-M, carbachol and methacholine; 2) full agonists at autoreceptors and partial agonists at receptors coupled to IP1 formation included oxotremorine, arecoline, bethanechol and RS-86; 3) McN-A-343 was a partial agonist at both sites. Arecaidine propargyl ester was a full agonist at autoreceptors but produced a biphasic stimulation of IP1 formation. Comparison of the EC50 values showed that agonists of groups 1 and 3 were more potent at autoreceptors than at IP1-coupled receptors. Group 2 agonists displayed similar potencies at the two types of receptors. N-Ethylmaleimide (NEM) was more active in antagonizing autoreceptors than IP1-coupled receptors in rat hippocampus. Concentration-response curves to carbachol at autoreceptors were shifted to the right in the presence of 10 microM NEM; 30 microM NEM reduced the maximal response. At postsynaptic receptors, higher concentrations of NEM (100 and 120 microM) were required for inhibition of maximum stimulation of IP1 by carbachol. NEM at 160 and 300 microM abolished the stimulation of IP1 induced by carbachol. These observations provide additional evidence that muscarinic autoreceptors differ from the postsynaptic muscarinic receptors that modulate IP1 formation. The similar rank order of agonist potencies between hippocampal autoreceptors and cardiac muscarinic receptors supports the hypothesis that these autoreceptors are of the M2 (cardiac) subtype.\r"

External perfusion with 8-bromo-cyclic AMP or CPT-cAMP caused a reversible, concentration-dependent decrease in the response to GABA. Adding the protein kinase inhibitor H-8 to the perfusing medium or the intracellular recording solution did not affect the response to GABA, which was decreased by CPT-cAMP as before. L858051, a water-soluble derivative of the adenylate cyclase activator forskolin, did not decrease the response to GABA even in the presence of the phosphodiesterase inhibitor 3-isobutylmethylxanthine. External cyclic AMP also caused a reversible, concentration-dependent decrease in the response to GABA with a potency similar to that of 8-Br-cAMP. When cAMP was present in the intracellular recording solution cAMP and CPT-cAMP decreased the response to GABA as before. These experiments suggest that analogs of cAMP decrease GABAA receptor-activated chloride current by acting at an extracellular site.\r"

  ".U": "91012169\r", 
  ".W": "A differential response to cholinomimetic agonists in epididymal and prostatic portions of rat vas deferens was characterized. The prostatic portion was less sensitive to acetylcholine and carbachol than the epididymal portion. The contraction induced by cholinomimetic agonists was inhibited in the epididymal portion by atropine (1.0-3.0 nM) and in the prostatic portion by hexamethonium (0.1 mM). The contractile response of the prostatic portion to exogenous acetylcholine was not inhibited by textrodotoxin (1.0 microM) but was attenuated by reserpine treatment (10 mg.kg-1 i.p. 24 h) and by prazosin or alpha, beta-methylene ATP. A combination of an alpha-1-adrenoceptor antagonist (prazosin) and P2 purinoceptor desensitization with alpha, beta-methylene ATP abolished the contractile response of the prostatic portion. The contraction induced by repetitive field stimulation of the prostatic portion was attenuated by hexamethonium whereas the response to a single stimulus was not modified. The data suggest that cholinomimetic drugs activate both nicotinic receptors located in nerve terminals of the prostatic portion and muscarinic receptors located in the smooth muscle cells of the epididymal portion, and that stimulation of nicotinic receptors induces the release of noradrenaline and ATP.\r"

  ".W": "The proximal urethra is a mobile structure, and voluntary control of its position is an integral part of the initiation of urination and continence. This paper describes the histology of the vagina's attachment to the medial portion of the levator ani muscles, which, because of the intimate attachment of the vagina and urethra, is responsible, in part, for control of the urethral position. A histologic examination of 1,500 serial microscopic slides from eight women, dissection of four bodies and study of whole pelvis cross-sections from two cadavers were performed. Smooth muscle, collagen and elastin fibers of the vaginal wall and paraurethral tissues directly interdigitate with the muscle fibers of the most medial portion of the levator ani, in the region of the proximal urethra. This strong connection lies at a level just below the entry of the urethra into the bladder and extends downward to the level of the perineal membrane (urogenital diaphragm) in an area corresponding to the mobile portion of the urethra. The inseparable nature of the vagina and urethra in this region makes it possible for the connection of the levator ani to the vagina to control the proximal urethral position. These observations suggest a specific role of the medial levator ani muscle in controlling vesical neck position and open the question of the specific part played by this arrangement in voiding and continence relative to other factors known to influence lower urinary tract function.\r"

However, it provides some information about which surgical procedure is most appropriate for the correction of genuine stress incontinence.\r"

The normal support of the pelvic organs is provided by the pelvic diaphragm (levator ani and coccygeus muscles). The levator plate is a firm, muscular plate between the coccyx and anus formed by fusion of the levator ani muscles on each side. Recent investigators have indicated that the main mechanism for weakening the pelvic muscles occurs as a result of childbearing, when stretch injury of the pudendal nerve causes denervation of the muscles. This injury is aggravated with the changes of aging and has effects on anogenital prolapse and stress incontinence. There may be iatrogenic causes of both prolapse and stress incontinence when an operation produces a change in the direction of tissue forces or removes a prior barrier to incontinence. The evaluation of patients must include the actual and potential aspects of genital prolapse and incontinence. Testing for stress incontinence must be performed before and after reduction of the genital prolapse. Surgical repair should be planned carefully to correct all the significant and potential defects in the urogenital tract. Ideally a normal vaginal axis with adequate length will be restored, and urinary function will not be compromised.\r"

An increase of the immune response to antigens of group B streptococcus was found in patients with RA. The greatest sensitization against these antigens was typical for high disease activity of short duration, and a rapidly progressive course of RA. High titers of antibodies to polysaccharide of group B streptococcus appeared in the synovial fluid in the early stages of the clinical development of RA. Values of immune response to streptococcal antigens correlated well with the titer of rheumatoid factor and the concentration of immunoglobulins and immune complexes. The presence of group B streptococcus in the urogenital tract appeared more often in patients with RA than in healthy persons. The possibility of a triggering role for immune reactions with antigens of group B streptococcus in the immunopathological process of RA is discussed, as well as the diagnostic significance of our results.\r"

The only clinical or laboratory feature associated with the presence of anti-dII antibodies was seronegativity for IgM rheumatoid factor (IgM RF): 6 (37.5%) of 16 seronegative patients had anti-dII antibodies vs 12 (10.6%) of the 113 seropositive patients (OR = 5, p less than 0.01). There were no associations of anti-dII antibodies with age, sex, race, disease activity, disease duration, functional class, or the presence of HLA-DR1, DR4, or DQw3 in these patients. Antibodies to type II collagen may have a pathophysiologic role in RA, especially in patients seronegative for RF.\r"

At the initial presentation patients with PMR had more radial segmentation formation than patients with other inflammatory conditions. Prednisone induced a rapid and marked decrease in radial segmentation formation in patients with PMR. This latter finding was much less marked in patients with other inflammatory conditions.

The median IgM RF concentration was 50-fold higher in polyarticular disease compared to systemic disease. The prevalence of IgM RF in polyarticular disease was greater in those with severe disease (functional classes and 3 and 4), with 90% (9/10) seropositive. By agglutination assay, the prevalence of IgM RF in JRA was significantly less than by ELISA, with 33% of the polyarticular group positive for IgM RF, and none of the systemic group positive, Relatively low concentration IgM RF similar to that seen in systemic JRA was also found in high prevalence in the area of children with non-JRA, systemic rheumatic disease (n = 8). In summary, our study shows by ELISA that high concentrations of IgM RF are found essentially only in the sera of children with polyarticular onset JRA and especially in those with severe disease.\r"

Clinical characteristics were similar to those in previous studies. Five year survival, calculated by life-table analysis, was 85.3%, comparable to recent studies. Treatment consisted of corticosteroids (32 patients), antimalarials (14), cyclophosphamide (9) or azathioprine (2). Eighty-four percent of patients experienced a noninfectious drug related complication. A major infection contributed in all 5 patients who died. Higher total corticosteroid dose was associated with more severe infections. Eighty-eight percent of patients were left with chronic organ dysfunction. Survival in childhood onset SLE has improved, but morbidity remains a significant problem from organ dysfunction and complications of therapy. Our study is the first to address the issue of morbidity in childhood SLE.\r"

Whereas human purified interleukin 1 (IL-1) (20 U/ml) stimulated collagenase production and inhibited proteoglycan synthesis. Furthermore addition of IL-1 (20 U/ml) to chondrocyte cultures did not stimulate the chondrocytes to produce IL-6. Under our experimental conditions, IL-6 did not stimulate chondrocytes to proliferate as measured by [3H] thymidine incorporation.

Patients with RA attending an outpatient rheumatology clinic were interviewed and asked to score their pain levels on the 3 pain scales. The scales were presented in random order, twice, before and just after a regular medical consultation. Ninety-one patients were studied (25 illiterate and 66 literate). The Pearson product moment correlation between first and second assessment was 0.937 for VAS, 0.963 for NRS and 0.901 for VRS in the literate patient group and 0.712 for VAS, 0.947 for NRS and 0.820 for VRS in the illiterate patient group.

They were hybridized with C4 complementary DNA by the Southern blotting method and the deletion of C4A gene was judged from restriction fragment length polymorphism. At the same time phenotypic C4A deficiency (C4AQ0) was measured. Our results showed that the frequency of phenotypic C4A deficiency was 44.1% in Japanese patients with SLE and this value was comparable with that (43.2%) in Caucasian patients. On the other hand the deletion of C4A gene was not found in Japanese patients with SLE (0%), or in healthy controls (0.6%). Our results indicate that C4AQ0 may contribute to the pathogenesis of SLE beyond the ethnical differences but Japanese patients with SLE have a different genetic background from Caucasian patients with the C4A gene deleted.\r"

Mitogen stimulation led to similar proportionate increases in proliferation and immunoglobulin (Ig) secretion in cultures of patient and control lymphocytes. While there was no increase in proliferation, IgG secretion was increased in the absence of mitogen. Nonmitogen activated Ig synthesis could be reduced by replacing culture medium with fresh medium after 16-20 h in culture. It was partly reconstituted by addition of recombinant cytokines, interleukin (IL), IL-2, IL-4, or IL-6. Our results suggest there may be a population of B circulating B cells in patients with JRA and other rheumatic diseases which is sufficiently mature to differentiate and secrete Ig in response to cytokines alone.\r"

The functional analysis at the clonal level in 5 patients (427 clones) showed a relevant proportion of cytotoxic T cell clones, which were not confined to typically cytolytic phenotypes, but were also present among CD3+CD4+CD8- cultures. Compared to those with pauciarticular JRA, patients with polyarticular disease had a significantly higher proportion of T cell clones with cytotoxic activity. Although derived from a limited number of patients, our data suggest a direct involvement of T cells in the pathogenetic mechanisms that originate and maintain the articular damage, and the possibility of different or more pronounced T cell reactivities in the clinically more diffuse JRA types.\r"

Analysis of reported age-specific incidence of primary malignant brain tumors over the same years demonstrates that incidence rates increased dramatically between 1973/1974 and 1985. In 1985, incidence rates for persons aged 75-79, 80-84, and 85 years of age and over were 187%, 394%, and 501%, respectively, of rates in 1973/1974. Similar increases were found in both men and women, analyzed separately and combined. Average annual percentage changes in primary brain tumor incidence were +7.0%, +20.4%, and +23.4% in these age ranges, respectively. Reported incidence in younger persons varied little over the same period of time. The most common histologic type of primary brain tumor in the elderly was of glial origin, predominantly the glioblastoma multiforme and astrocytoma. These tumors are highly malignant and invariably fatal. Two possible causes may explain the increased incidence in the elderly: the introduction and extensive use of x-ray computed tomography since 1973 and/or a true increase in incidence occurring independently of diagnostic advances.\r"

There was a strong correlation between both incidence of all stages of prostatic cancer combined and of localized disease and the increasing use of transurethral resection, a common surgical procedure usually performed to relieve urinary obstruction due to benign enlargement of the prostate. Our analyses suggest that increased detection of existing tumors via transurethral resection was the primary reason for the observed increase in incidence rates of prostatic cancer. However, analyses of mortality trends, particularly among nonwhites, and laboratory studies of the histologic nature of clinically asymptomatic tumors suggest that part of the increase may reflect changes in the real risk of prostatic cancer.\r"

  ".U": "91012628\r", 
  ".W": "When methionine (Met), an essential amino acid, was substituted for by its precursor homocysteine (Hcy) in the culture medium, normal cells such as fibroblasts proliferated normally. In contrast, many tumor cells failed to grow or grew at a lower rate. Met dependency is acquired simultaneously with cell transformation, as observed with HBL 100, a human mammary epithelial cell line that acquired increased malignancy as a function of in vitro passage number, and NIH/3T3 (J10), a mouse fibroblast line transformed by transfection with the human HRAS oncogene. A relationship was observed between Met dependency and metastatic potential of the RMS-21, RMS-S4T, and RMS-J1 sublines derived from RMS-0, a rat rhabdomyosarcoma cell line: the higher the metastatic potential of the cell line, the higher the concentration of Met required to maintain its proliferation. Met-independent cells derived from the RMS-0 line, obtained by a progressive decrease of Met in the culture medium lost their tumorigenicity when injected into rats fed with Met-deprived diets. In addition, the in vitro motility of RMS-S4T tumor cells, a marker of metastatic capability, decreased in Met-free Hcy-complemented (Met- Hcy+) medium. Similarly, RMS-0 tumor cells, preincubated in a Met- Hcy+ culture medium for 24 hours, evidenced a decreased capacity to form lung colonies when injected into syngeneic rats: the median number of lung colonies was 27 and 3 (P less than .05) for cells cultivated in Met+ Hcy- and Met- Hcy+ media, respectively. An amino acid-defined mixture reproducing casein composition was used as a protein source in the diets fed to RMS-J1 tumor-bearing rats. Dietary substitution of Hcy for Met (i.e., met deprivation) resulted in decreased tumor growth (from 44.4 +/- 1.0 to 40.6 +/- 1.4; P less than .05) and prevention of metastatic spread (from 37 to 0; P less than .05). In conclusion, exogenous Met can be substituted for Hcy to maintain the survival of normal cells but is essential for tumor cell growth in vivo as well as in vitro. Therefore, this defect of cancerous versus normal cells could be used for a therapeutic purpose.\r"

The c-erbB-2 gene was activated by mutation of the valine at position 659 within the transmembrane domain to glutamic acid. The activated c-erbB-2 expression vector was transfected into low-metastatic-potential NL-4 cells, which were established from a metastatic variant of murine colon adenocarcinoma 26. All 10 clones produced lung metastases in BALB/c mice injected via the tail vein. Eight of the 10 clones expressed messenger RNA (mRNA) of activated c-erbB-2 and showed morphological alteration; seven of the eight produced significantly enhanced experimental metastatic activity compared with that of untransfected NL-4 or NL-4neo cells, and one had metastatic ability similar to that of NL-4 cells. Two clones did not express c-erbB-2 mRNA and did not show morphological alteration or highly metastatic phenotype. Five of the 10 clones subcutaneously implanted in the flank failed to produce metastasis in the lungs or other organs of the mice. The metastatic ability of the other five clones was not determined. These results indicate that the activated c-erbB-2 gene can enhance experimental but not spontaneous metastatic potential in NL-4 cells, suggesting participation of the gene in the metastatic process after initial arrest and lodgement in the capillary bed.\r"

The total age-adjusted incidence of bladder cancer was 27.5 cases per 100,000 person-years for men and 7.0 for women, yielding a ratio of 3.9. Even in the absence of exposure to cigarettes, occupational hazards, or urinary tract infection, the gender-related risk persisted; the incidence of bladder cancer was 11.0 in men and 4.1 in women, yielding a ratio of 2.7. Possible explanations for the excessive risk in men include environmental and dietary exposures not yet identified and innate sexual characteristics such as anatomic differences, urination habits, or hormonal factors.\r"

To test this hypothesis we investigated the total protein and specific acute phase protein synthesis response of murine hepatocytes to stimulation with mu-rTNF-alpha in vivo and in vitro. Total hepatocyte secretory protein synthesis was assessed by incorporation of [35-S] methionine into TCA-precipitated protein; and acute phase protein synthesis was assessed by induction of a 23-kD acute phase protein marker and by suppression of albumin synthesis determined by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. We found that rTNF in vivo (8,000 units, IP injection) was associated with reduced total hepatocyte secretory protein synthesis (29 +/- 10%), increased synthesis of the 23-kD acute phase reactant (4.1 +/- 1.6-fold), and decreased albumin synthesis (0.68 +/- 0.2-fold) compared to saline-injected control animals. The in vitro stimulation of cultured murine hepatocytes directly with rTNF failed to demonstrate changes in total secretory protein synthesis or 23-kD protein; however, it did result in significant suppression of albumin synthesis (0.82 +/- 0.1-fold). In additional experiments, hepatocytes:nonparenchymal cell co-cultures stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) demonstrated protein synthesis changes similar to the in vivo TNF response including increased 23-kD protein and decreased albumin synthesis. These co-cultures demonstrated TNF production; however, addition of TNF antiserum during LPS stimulation had no effect on either 23-kD protein or albumin synthesis, despite the complete neutralization of TNF activity in the co-culture supernatants.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Anatomic profile (AP) components A, B, and C summarize serious injuries (greater than AIS 2) to the head/brain or spinal cord; to the thorax or front of the neck; and all remaining serious injuries. Relationships between AP components and survival rate reaffirm the seriousness of head injury. Logistic function models relating AP components and the Injury Severity Score (ISS) to survival probability were based on 20,946 Major Trauma Outcome Study (MTOS) patients (9.2% mortality rate) submitted through 1986. Model performance comparisons were based on 5,939 MTOS patients (7.8% mortality rate) submitted during 1987. The AP better discriminated survivors from nonsurvivors and provided a 31% increase in sensitivity when compared with the ISS. Neither the ISS nor the AP alone reliably predict patient outcome. The predictive power of methods for estimating patient survival probability which include physiologic indices or profiles, patient age, and an anatomic profile should be compared with current methods. The AP, which is based on the severity and location of all serious injuries, provides a more rational basis for comparing patient samples than the ISS.\r"

Both groups of drivers were 21 years of age or older, sustained moderate injuries (defined as having no injury of the brain, spinal column or cord, extremity, or pelvis with an Abbreviated Injury Score of greater than 2), and were discharged home. In the 140 crashes in which culpability was clearly defined, the impaired drivers caused a significantly greater percentage of their crashes (92.7%) compared to unimpaired (64.7%) drivers (p less than 0.001). Of the 55 unimpaired drivers who were considered culpable of causing their crashes, 12.7% received a traffic conviction compared with 39.2% of the 51 culpable impaired drivers. The mean number of total pre-crash traffic violations was higher for impaired drivers than for unimpaired drivers (p less than 0.01). While the mean number of total post-crash convictions for unimpaired and impaired was not significantly different, the mean number of pre- and post-crash alcohol convictions was significantly higher for impaired drivers compared to unimpaired drivers (p less than 0.02).

  ".W": "Trauma remains the major cause of death in children and young adults. Adult and pediatric patients differ significantly in both mechanism of and physiologic response to injury. We reviewed the records of all consecutive adult and pediatric blunt trauma patients admitted to a major metropolitan trauma center for a 10-year period. An extensive computerized database has been maintained for all patients since 1977. A comparative statistical analysis of mechanism of injury, specific organ injury, and clinical outcome was performed. Altogether, 1,722 adults and 289 children were treated during the study period. Blunt trauma accounted for 82.8% of adult and 94.3% of pediatric injury (p = 0.00005), and only these patients were considered for analysis. Diagnostic peritoneal lavage was performed in 249 children and 1,464 adults, with a respective accuracy of 99.6% and 97.2%. Mechanism of injury was comparable for both groups, although children were far more likely to be injured by falls, bicycle accidents, or struck by an automobile. Comparative analysis of specific injuries demonstrated significantly fewer pediatric chest (p = 0.001), spine (p = 0.03), and pelvic (p = 0.003) injuries. Central nervous system (CNS) injury in children was a strong determinant of outcome: serious pediatric CNS trauma was associated with a tenfold increase in mortality. Mortality for children in the absence of CNS injury was less than 3%. Spinal injury also appeared to be a predictor of poor outcome in the pediatric population, with an associated mortality of greater than 50%. Overall, survival was age independent (82.5% of adults and 85.8% of children were survivors.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The association of injury and alcoholism should be particularly obvious to Emergency Department (ED) physicians. We sought to determine the extent to which intoxicated patients in an ED were properly diagnosed, counselled, and referred for substance abuse care. We reviewed the charts of 153 consecutive patients seen in a teaching hospital ED who had blood alcohol levels above 100 mg%. Most were male (70%), white (62%), young (mean age, 34 years) and severely intoxicated (mean BAL, 245; range, 109-558 mg%). Forty-six per cent of visits were for trauma; half of the patients were victims of violent assaults. The intoxicated patients received extensive medical and surgical management: an average of five tests or X-rays were performed per patient; 75% received at least one medication; at discharge 48% were referred for followup to medical or surgical clinics. In contrast, few patients were evaluated for dangerous behaviors or referred for treatment of alcoholism: only 19 patients (12.5%) were asked about depression, suicide, or homicide; 15% were advised to stop drinking; 13% received a referral to a psychiatrist, mental health worker, or alcohol rehabilitation facility. Forty-seven per cent of patients received \"stat\" intravenous thiamine (although the Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome is rare). In contrast, only 16% received a stat on-site psychiatric consultation (although dangerous behaviors are common in alcoholics). There was a strong, statistically significant negative association between the occurrence of an injury and the decision to initiate treatment and referrals for alcoholism.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Critically ill patients often demonstrate that whole body oxygen consumption (VO2) is dependent on oxygen delivery (DO2). In this retrospective study, the relationship of VO2 to DO2 in patients with isolated head injury (HI, n = 18) was compared to that in patients with multiple trauma (MT, n = 60) without serious head injury. Mean pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, central venous pressure, arterial PCO2, cardiac index, and oxygen delivery were significantly lower in HI, but oxygen consumption was not different in the groups. In both groups, changes in DO2 (delta DO2) within each patient were significantly correlated with changes in VO2 (delta VO2) in that same patient. This relationship was not different between the HI patients, (delta VO2 = (0.20 +/- 0.02) delta DO2), and the MT patients (delta VO2 = (0.17 +/- 0.01) delta DO2). When these groups were further divided into those with high hematocrit (greater than 32%) and low hematocrit (less than 32%), HI patients with a low hematocrit demonstrated a steeper regression slope, with 26 +/- 3% of the DO2 change being reflected in the VO2 change. This was significantly greater than the slope in HI patients with high hematocrit (13 +/- 3%) and the MT patients at high (19 +/- 2%) or low (16 +/- 2%) hematocrits. These data show a correlation between changes in oxygen delivery and consumption that is similar in both head-injury patients and multiple trauma patients without serious head injury. This relationship was greatest in head-injured patients at low hematocrit. This relationship of VO2 and DO2 in both groups suggests an influence of neurohumoral factors rather than local tissue phenomena.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The incidence of BT was measured 8 days after splenectomy or sham-splenectomy in mice receiving or not receiving endotoxin (0.1 mg IP). Splenectomy does not appear to promote BT from the gut, since the incidence of bacterial translocation after splenectomy or sham-splenectomy (5%) were not different. A second experiment was performed to determine whether the resistance to endotoxin-induced BT was modified after splenectomy. The incidence of endotoxin-induced BT was 73% in the unoperated control group, 59% in the sham-splenectomy group, but 23% in the splenectomy group (p less than 0.002). Thus, splenectomy but not sham-splenectomy increased the resistance of otherwise healthy mice to endotoxin-induced BT.\r"

IR-PLA2 values were slightly increased in the serum of nine patients with multiple injuries. Of these nine patients, eight had an additional blunt abdominal trauma. On the other hand, no relationship was found between IR-PLA2 and CA-PLA2 values. This finding was confirmed by immunoadsorption experiments with an antiserum to human pancreatic PLA2, which demonstrated that the increased serum levels of IR-PLA2 were not responsible for the increased CA-PLA2 values. The results suggest the existence of at least two immunologically different phospholipase A2 enzymes in sera of patients with multiple injuries.\r"

Nine of these patients who were lavaged within 4 hours of injury had no intra-abdominal pathology. Two patients, lavaged after 4 hours, demonstrated intra-abdominal injury. Two hundred twenty-three patients (24.7%) had grossly clear dialysate which was not sent for laboratory analysis. None of these patients required laparotomy. We conclude that the WBC count in DPL fluid is of no diagnostic value in victims of blunt abdominal trauma who are lavaged within 4 hours of injury. In addition, laboratory analysis of clear dialysate is not required in these patients.\r"

  ".U": "91012676\r", 
  ".W": "Indications for arteriography in penetrating extremity trauma remain controversial. We reviewed our clinical experience in 454 patients (514 extremities) with penetrating trauma admitted during a prior 3 1/2-year period. Injuries were caused by stab wounds in 60 (11.7%) extremities and by gunshot wounds in 454 (88.3%) extremities. Thirty-three of the 60 stab wounds (55%) required urgent exploration, and 27 underwent arteriography. No arteriograms were positive for unsuspected arterial injury in this group. Forty-two of 454 gunshot wounds (9.3%) underwent mandatory exploration; arteriograms were performed on 412 extremities. Forty-four arteriograms (10.7%) demonstrated evidence of unsuspected arterial injuries. During the last year, randomly selected extremities (n = 23) have been studied with B-mode ultrasonography and segmental Doppler pressure measurements. Using the subsequent arteriography as the \"gold\" standard, sensitivity was 83% and specificity was 100%. Gunshot wounds were categorized according to location and positive arteriograms. Injuries to the lateral thigh and arm resulted in no positive arteriograms, while positive studies were observed in 11% of medial and posterior arm, 14% of antecubital fossa, 25% of forearm, 7.5% of medial and posterior thigh, 8% of popliteal fossa, and 26% of calf injuries. We recommend arteriography for gunshot injuries to identified high-risk areas, while clinical evaluation alone is accurate in all stab wounds to the extremities and gunshot wounds to the lateral thigh and outer arm. Preliminary data suggest expanded use of B-mode ultrasonography may further reduce our dependency on arteriography in these cases.\r"

  ".W": "The American College of Surgeons has stated that in considering the development of trauma systems it is important to ensure an appropriate volume of seriously injured patients be seen by each trauma center in order to achieve acceptable mortality rates. Clinical data supporting this recommendation are lacking. An analysis was performed on 1,643 seriously injured trauma patients to determine the relationship between volume and mortality rates. Three separate statistical methods were used: Pearson correlation coefficients, mortality odds ratios, and direct pairwise mortality comparisons. In addition, Tobit analysis was introduced as a method to analyze the relationship between volume and mortality. Mortality rates were adjusted for the confounding variable of serious head injury. Pearson correlation coefficients for volume vs. adjusted mortality was -0.65. Mortality odds ratios comparing the low-volume (less than 140 pts) trauma centers vs. the high-volume (greater than 200 pts) trauma centers was 1.3 for adjusted mortality rates (95% CI = 1.01-1.66; p = 0.04). Categorical analysis showed significantly different mortality rates in the centers before and after adjusting for patient mix. Tobit analysis showed the relationship between volume and mortality to be significant, accounting for 30-40% of the observed variation in mortality rates. In addition, Tobit analysis allowed construction of a model to predict mortality rates, given specific volumes of patients. Our data suggest that an inverse relationship exists between volume and mortality, and support the necessity of configuring trauma systems in a manner that will ensure designated trauma centers will see a high volume of seriously injured patients.\r"

Estimates of the numbers of hospital episodes and total expenditures are reported in this paper for subgroups of patients defined by age, sex, and body region and AIS severity of the injuries sustained. In 1985 2.1 million individuals sustained a traumatic injury which resulted in hospitalization. Hospital expenditures totaled $11.4 billion inclusive of professional fees. Adolescents and young adults aged 15-44 years accounted for nearly one half of all discharges and total hospital costs. The elderly, who represent only 12% of the population, accounted for an additional one quarter of total discharges and hospital costs. Nearly three quarters of the hospitalizations and one half of total expenditures were for minor (ICD/AIS = 1, 2) injuries. Moderate (ICD/AIS = 3) and severe (ICD/AIS = 4, 5), injuries respectively accounted for 23% and 3% of total episodes and 37% and 11% of total expenditures. Only 12% of patients and 25% of trauma care dollars involved injuries sufficiently severe to require treatment at a trauma center.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

We utilized a chronic ovine model to determine the hemodynamic disturbances in the gastrointestinal tract during endotoxemia. Sheep with indwelling arterial, venous, and pulmonary arterial catheters were used. An ultrasonic flow probe was placed on the cephalic mesenteric artery. The animals were subjected to: 1) Ringer's lactate infusion (sham n = 6); or 2) 1.5 mcg/kg E. coli endotoxin (n = 6) over over a period of one half hour and were monitored for 48 hours. They were then sacrificed and specimens of mesenteric lymph node, liver, spleen, kidney, and lung obtained for bacteriologic cultures and histologic analysis. Sheep receiving endotoxin showed more than 50% reduction in the mesenteric blood flow. Mesenteric vascular resistance increased while non-mesenteric systemic vascular resistance decreased. The increase in the total systemic vascular resistance, noted during endotoxemia, was thus likely due to the increase in the mesenteric vascular resistance. At autopsy there were positive cultures for microorganism in the mesenteric lymph nodes in six out of six sheep with endotoxemia as compared to one out of six of control. Thus the vasoconstriction in the mesenteric areas may have resulted in bacterial translocation from the GI tract.\r"

After a 1-hr basal period, hypoglycemia was induced with insulin infusion at 5 mU/kg.min for 3 hr. Group 1 received no other treatment.

  ".W": "The purpose of this study was to investigate the distribution of various mechanisms of injury and the relative severity of such injury cases throughout the different geographic zones of a large urban area using a computerized emergency medical services (EMS) dispatch/patient record database. The study city (population, 2 million residents) was divided into 156 geographic grids (each 4.5 by 3 miles) and the incidence and relative severity of various injury mechanisms were determined for each zone. Results: In one year (1988), there were more than 115,000 separate EMS incidents involving more than 150,000 patients, 26,000 of whom were transported for injuries incurred in 10,064 motor vehicle accidents, 4,587 falls, 4,015 lacerations/stabwounds, 1,796 beatings, 1,270 gunshots, and 952 auto-pedestrian accidents. Analysis of the 156 zones showed a disproportionate number of EMS responses in the city center with two centralmost grids accounting for about 25% of all responses. Call volume then progressively diminished toward the periphery of the city. However, with some very minor exceptions, the relative incidence and severity of the various injury mechanisms remained proportionally uniform within each zone, regardless of geographic location. Therefore, contrary to popular notoriety, the incidence and associated severity of any given injury type generally was not necessarily predicted by any particular neighborhood predilection for it, but rather by the overall demand for EMS in that zone of the city.\r"

Ninety-five of the crash occupants (24%) were known to be wearing safety belts. Ten children sustained a \"lap belt injury\": five with lumbar spine injury, four with combined lumbar spine and intestinal injuries, and one child with intestinal injury. All ten children presented with a characteristic transverse abdominal ecchymosis. The CT scan was unreliable in evaluation of both spinal and intestinal injury. Lateral radiographs were required for definitive diagnosis in eight of nine children with lumbar spinal injury. CT scan was clearly diagnostic in only one of five children with intestinal injury. Children wearing lap belts are at risk of a \"lap belt complex.\" Lateral spine X-rays, peritoneal lavage, and early laparotomy are recommended to establish an accurate diagnosis and to decrease morbidity.\r"

A non-electronic device designed as a patient-controlled analgesic (PCA) was evaluated as a nurse-controlled device (NCA). Twenty-five intubated patients received morphine sulfate (MS) with the nurse-controlled device (NCA) and 12 by standard IV push policy. The average nursing time for narcotic dosing with the standard policy was 5 minutes/unit dose. A total of 1,183 NCA doses were given over 77 patient days. The average doses per patient day were 15 (2-38). The average nursing time was 22 seconds/NCA dose. The NCA saved 85 nursing minutes/patient day. Annual nursing labor costs were reduced by $77,000.00 with NCA. Total costs for standard IV push narcotic use were $36.43/patient day versus $35.45/patient day for NCA. Using this protocol, the NCA system saved $8,500.00 annually. By increasing the duration of PCA use to 72 hours, the annual savings would become $49,500.00. These data indicate that a simple NCA can deliver controlled drugs rapidly and safely, save valuable nursing time, and decrease the cost of ICU care.\r"

All patients with isolated chest trauma and hemopneumothorax (estimated ISS 9 or 10) seen in our trauma center were considered eligible for this study. Patients were excluded for the following reasons: age less than 18 years, presence of shock at the time of initial resuscitation, ongoing antibiotic therapy for unrelated disease, documented pre-existing infection or documented abnormal immune status. Ninety patients were randomized to two treatment limbs: antibiotics and tube thoracostomy or tube thoracostomy alone. All patients had the procedure performed in the trauma center in a standard fashion. Wound care and tube care were identical. Antibiotic therapy consisted of a first-generation cephalosporin (cefazolin), one dose given just before the procedure and then q 6 h into the tube removal. Injury Severity Scores were established as described by Schwab after the manner of Baker. Statistical analysis was performed using Fisher's exact test of binary outcome. In this study, antibiotics were able to reduce the incidence of empyema in patients with isolated chest trauma and for such patients antibiotic treatment appears justified. Further work is required to determine the effect on patients with more severe injury and multisystem involvement.\r"

In a retrospective study, six of 18 patients sustaining severe perineal lacerations died within the first few hours of injury due to exsanguination from pelvic injuries. The remaining 12 patients underwent sigmoidoscopy, diversion of the fecal stream with irrigation of the distal rectal stump, and radical initial debridement of necrotic soft tissue. Enteral access was obtained in two patients. In the patients with mandatory daily debridement and pulsatile irrigation, no pelvic sepsis occurred. In three patients without daily debridement, pelvic sepsis complicated recovery. The ability of patients to resume oral nutrition was significantly delayed, necessitating total parenteral nutrition in three patients. We conclude that sigmoidoscopy, total diversion of the fecal stream with irrigation of the distal rectal stump, enteral access for feeding, radical initial debridement of necrotic soft tissue, and mandatory daily debridement with pulsatile irrigation optimize recovery from this devastating injury.\r"

This technique contributed most valuable information toward the diagnosis of such coexistent injuries in patients who sustained blunt trauma. CT identified associated abdominal or retroperitoneal organ injuries in 85% of the patients (277 of 324), clinical examination in only 26%. CT proved invaluable for assessment of injury to bowel and mesentery, pancreas, and retroperitoneal vascular structures, giving rise to hematomas. CT diagnosed all such injuries, clinical examination from 0% (pancreas) to 11% (retroperitoneal hematomas). In patients with penetrating injury, dynamic CTs added valuable information on the status of viability of the injured organs. A relatively high number of false positive diagnoses resulted in only four unnecessary explorations. In all other patients, the erroneous diagnosis was revealed on repeat CTs undertaken because of inconsistency of the clinical course and clinical findings with the initially suggested CT diagnosis or at time of exploration undertaken for correction of other confirmed injuries. Discovery of associated intra- or retroperitoneal organ injuries, particularly in patients who sustained blunt trauma, has resulted in modification of treatment which prevented late sequelae and complications and thereby substantially reduced hospitalization time.\r"

The resuscitations of 54 TRA patients at a Level I trauma center are reviewed. Although the survival of patients who underwent attempted repair was good (75%), 21/27 (78%) deaths occurred during phases of treatment controlled by a trauma surgeon. The techniques and sequencing of resuscitation can affect outcome. Pneumatic antishock garments were not beneficial in the prehospital setting for patients with TRA. In fact, PASG were on and inflated in all patients who presented in cardiac arrest. Awake, unanesthetized intubation caused fatal aortic rupture in three patients. Pharmacologic control of blood pressure during intubation is necessary. The amount of fluid, blood transfusion, and changes in blood pressure secondary to therapy did not statistically affect outcome. The average time from arrival in the ER to angiogram was 64.7 minutes. The average time ER to operating room was 159.7 minutes. Seven cases of TRA had delayed diagnosis usually for a misinterpreted CXR (5/7). Delay in diagnosis did not directly contribute to any deaths. Associated abdominal injuries are a common cause of preventable deaths. Fourteen patients with combined abdominal injuries and TRA were identified. Four of six deaths occurred with potentially reparable injuries. Operative and diagnostic sequences must be adjusted to allow rapid control of all potentially fatal injuries.\r"

  ".W": "To assess the utility of routine duplex surveillance, 379 infrainguinal reversed vein grafts performed at two independent teaching hospitals were prospectively entered into a surveillance protocol from March 1986 through August 1989. An average of 3.2 postoperative duplex graft flow velocity (GFV) measurements per graft was obtained during a mean follow-up interval of 21 1/2 months. Only 2.1% of 280 grafts with GFV measurements greater than 45 cm/sec failed within 6 months of a normal surveillance examination. GFV measurements less than 45 cm/sec in 99 grafts led to arteriography in 75 grafts, identifying 50 stenotic lesions in 48 bypasses (12.6% of series). Inflow lesions were present in 5%, outflow stenoses in 2%, and intrinsic graft stenoses in only 6% of bypasses. Only 29% of grafts identified as failing by duplex scan were associated with a reduction in ankle-brachial index of greater than 0.15. Secondary reconstructions were performed in 48 grafts based on detection of a reduced GFV measurement; all such reconstructions are patent after a mean follow-up of 5 months. Duplex surveillance is more reliable in identification of failing vein grafts than is determination of ankle-brachial index.\r"

Four operations were used: transaxillary first rib resection (26); supraclavicular first rib resection with neurolysis (15); scalenectomy with neurolysis (58); and brachial plexus neurolysis (35). Complications included temporary plexus injury (0.7%), temporary phrenic palsy (3.7%), and permanent phrenic palsy (1.4%). The combined primary success rate of all four operations for recurrence was 84% in the first 3 months. This fell to 59% at 1 to 2 years; 50% at 3 to 5 years; and 41% at 10 to 15 years. No significant difference was found in results between the four operations used for recurrence. When recurrence was caused by trauma the results of reoperations were better than when recurrence was spontaneous. The primary success rates of three initial operations for thoracic outlet syndrome were compared to their secondary success rates (improved after reoperation). By use of life-table methods, reoperation improved the 5- to 10-year success rate of transaxillary first rib resection from 69% to 86% and for scalenectomy from 69% to 84%. Reoperation is successful in most cases of recurrent thoracic outlet syndrome and better when recurrence is the result of a neck injury.\r"

In initial animal studies femoral arteriovenous fistulas approximately 1.5 cm in length were created bilaterally in each of 10 dogs and were studied histologically at 2, 4, 8, 16, and 24 weeks (two animals in each interval). In each animal, one anastomosis (control) was formed with continuous 6-0 polypropylene suture, and the contralateral anastomosis (experimental) was performed with an argon laser (0.5 watt, 5 to 7 minutes exposure, energy fluence 1100 to 1500 joules/cm2 per 1 cm length) with stay sutures of 5-0 polydimethylsiloxane at 0.5 to 0.65 cm intervals. At removal, all anastomoses were patent without hematomas, aneurysms, or luminal narrowing. Histologic examination at 2 to 16 weeks demonstrated resorption of the biodegradable suture material by a local inflammatory reaction. By 24 weeks, laser-fused specimens had no evidence of suture material at the anastomotic line, and healing consisted of a bond between artery and vein wall tissues. Control suture specimens at the same intervals exhibited an organized fibrous tissue response to the suture. Clinical adaptability of this technology has subsequently been evaluated in five patients at 10 to 27 months (21.6 +/- 5.8) by physical examination and duplex scanning and demonstrate no evidence of abnormal healing. This study establishes the experimental and preliminary clinical feasibility of laser-fused anastomoses aligned by biodegradable guy sutures and supports further investigation and refinement of the technique.\r"

There were 11 occlusions of the external iliac artery and one stenosis of the common femoral artery. Failures occurred mainly in the external iliac artery, which appears to be the limiting factor in the continued patency of endarterectomy. There were 18 deaths (30%). Nine deaths were attributed to the complications of arteriosclerosis.\r"

Partial distal removal showed better preservation of residual greater saphenous vein than partial proximal removal, with greater preservation of \"usable\" length and greater average diameter. Compared to contralateral unoperated legs, partial distal removal, partial proximal removal, and total removal all showed a similar degree of compensatory lesser saphenous vein enlargement. High ligation showed no lesser saphenous vein enlargement but showed the best greater saphenous vein preservation, none had less than 85% preservation of potential length. Combining residual greater saphenous vein and lesser saphenous vein segments of usable caliber, 100% of high ligation, 93% of partial distal removal, and 74% of partial proximal removal had greater than 60 cm total length, and most total removal had greater than 40 cm usable residual lesser saphenous vein. Previous saphenous vein surgery should not categorically exclude patients as having no usable residual ipsilateral vein for bypass. Partial distal removal allows better preservation of length and caliber of residual greater saphenous vein than proximal harvest, with both showing equivalent lesser saphenous vein enlargement to those with total greater saphenous vein removal. High ligation, performed for early tributary varicosities, in patients with saphenofemoral but no perforator incompetence, gives excellent preservation of residual greater saphenous vein length and caliber. Sclerotherapy to tributary varicosities did not obliterate distal greater saphenous vein segments.\r"

Upper or lower extremity ischemia was present in 12 (60%) patients and cerebrovascular insufficiency in seven (35%). Nine patients initially managed with corticosteroids had no improvement in signs or symptoms of arterial insufficiency. Eleven patients had 16 vascular procedures for the following indications: renovascular hypertension (6), extremity ischemia (5), cerebrovascular insufficiency (2), dilation ascending aorta with aortic insufficiency (1), thoracic aortic aneurysm (1), abdominal aortic aneurysm (1). Procedures included aortorenal bypass (5), carotid-subclavian, axillary, or brachial bypass (4), aorto-carotid bypass (2), aneurysm resection (2), supra-celiac aorto-femoral bypass (1), ascending aorta/aortic valve replacement (1), and nephrectomy (1). Clinical improvement occurred in all patients. There were no operative deaths. All are alive at a mean follow-up of 5.75 years (6 months to 16 years). Revision of the initial reconstruction has been required for recurrent renovascular hypertension in one patient and extremity ischemia in another. The other nine patients remain symptomatically improved. Symptomatic Takayasu's arteritis frequently requires arterial reconstruction. Symptomatic improvement and excellent long-term graft patency can be expected after arterial reconstruction.\r"

During the past 6 years some of the authors frequently gave protamine sulfate to neutralize heparin, whereas others did not unless a patch was used or wound hemostasis was not readily obtained. To determine the influence of protamine sulfate on stroke and wound hematoma the records of 697 patients having a carotid endarterectomy from January 1984 to September 1989 were reviewed. Protamine sulfate was given to 328 patients, and 369 did not receive protamine sulfate. The incidence of stroke in the two groups was 1.8% (n = 6) and 2.7% (n = 10), respectively, and the difference was not significant (p = 0.6019). Excluding three strokes that could not be related to neutralizing or not neutralizing heparin, the difference remained insignificant (1.5% vs 2.2%, p = 0.7290). The incidence of wound hematoma was 1.8% (n = 6) in patients given protamine sulfate and 6.5% (n = 24) in patients not given protamine sulfate, and this difference was significant (p = 0.0044).

In patients not given protamine sulfate draining the wound lessened the incidence of wound hematoma (4.4% vs 8.6%), but this difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.1475). In patients given protamine sulfate the dose of protamine sulfate (15 to 45 mg vs 50 to 75 mg) had no statistically significant effect on the incidence of stroke (0.8% vs 2.0%, p = 0.6530) or wound hematoma (1.6% vs 1.0%, p = 1.000).\r"

  ".W": "This study evaluated the role of duplex scanning in the management of patients with normal or minimally diseases carotid arteries. Carotid duplex scans were interpreted according to previously established criteria and considered normal when pulsed Doppler spectral waveforms showed laminar flow or only minor flow disturbances. Normal flow patterns were noted by duplex scanning in 100 carotid bifurcations of 72 patients who also underwent carotid arteriography. Neurologic symptoms (amaurosis fugax, transient ischemic attack, or stroke) were present in relation to 23 arteries and absent in relation to 77 arteries. On the 23 symptomatic sides arteriography was interpreted as normal in eight, 1% to 15% stenosis in 14, and 16% to 40% stenosis in one. For the 77 asymptomatic sides, arteriography showed normal vessels in 15, 1% to 15% stenosis in 43, and 16% to 40% stenosis in 19. One symptomatic patient was treated by carotid endarterectomy for an irregular 1% to 15% stenosis. None of the asymptomatic lesions were in the range of 80% to 99% stenosis, which would justify endarterectomy for asymptomatic disease. Clinical follow-up for a mean interval of 28 months on 20 of the 22 symptomatic patients not undergoing surgery revealed no strokes and transient recurrent symptoms in two patients. Assuming that the single operation in this study was indicated, duplex scanning correctly identified lesions not requiring carotid endarterectomy in 96% (22/23) of the symptomatic patients. A normal duplex scan also predicted a benign clinical outcome without operation. Duplex scanning can reliably exclude surgically treatable carotid bifurcation lesions in asymptomatic patients, and endarterectomy is rarely indicated in symptomatic patients with normal duplex scan results. This study supports a nonoperative therapeutic approach for most patients with neurologic symptoms and a normal carotid duplex scan on the appropriate side.\r"

  ".W": "Between 1972 and 1988, 48 patients with extremity ischemia after an intraarterial drug injection were treated with the following protocol: heparin, dextran 40, dexamethasone, elevation, and early mobilization of the extremity. A tissue ischemia score, derived by assessing the color, capillary refill, sensory function, and temperature of the extremity, was used to assess the ischemic injury. Each sign was scored either normal = 0 or abnormal = 1; then summed to provide the tissue ischemia score (range, 0 to 4). Twenty-four (50%) patients had an extremity tissue ischemia score less than or equal to 2. After treatment 22 of the 24 patients had a normal extremity, and 2 required limited digital amputations. In this group, outcome was comparable regardless of the time interval from intraarterial drug injection to treatment. Ten of 24 (50%) patients with an extremity tissue ischemia score greater than 2 had a normal extremity, 3 had a functional deficit, and 11 required digital amputations. Twelve of the 24 patients were treated within 24 hours and had a significantly superior outcome when compared to the 12 who were treated more than 24 hours after intraarterial drug injection (p less than 0.001, Fisher's exact test). The tissue ischemia score is a useful predictor of extremity outcome in patients with intraarterial drug injection. The outlined treatment protocol is effective in minimizing tissue injury caused by intraarterial drug injection. Institution of treatment within 24 hours of intraarterial drug injection is particularly important in patients who manifest severe ischemia.\r"

All patients were hospitalized with conclusive ultrasonic evidence of deep venous thrombosis identified in one of four levels: I, calf only; II, calf-popliteal; III, calf-popliteal-femoral; or IV, calf-popliteal-femoral-iliac. Duplex scans were obtained on admission and on three subsequent occasions during therapy. Progression of thrombosis was defined as advancement of thrombus to the more proximal venous level. Demographic data, symptoms, risk factors for deep venous thrombosis, physical findings, anticoagulation regimens, and hematologic variables were ascertained. Adequacy of anticoagulation was defined as elevation of baseline activated partial thromboplastin time by 150%. Nine patients (38%) had progression of thrombosis, and 15 (62%) had stable or improving duplex scans. Progression occurred as follows: I----II (2), I----III (2), II----III (1), and III----IV (4). Of the demographic and clinical variables examined, only smoking correlated with progression of thrombus (p = 0.04). Average heparin dose in the stable group was 1214 +/- 294 units/hr and 1122 +/- 248 units/hr in the group that progressed (p = 0.8): activated partial thromboplastin time was 45.6 +/- 7 seconds in the stable group and 49.8 +/- 9 seconds in the progression group (p = 0.7). Nine patients in the stable group had consistently adequate anticoagulation, whereas six did not; six in the progression group were consistently anticoagulated, and three were not. Two patients (one with stable thrombus and one with progressive thrombus) suffered nonfatal pulmonary emboli. Clot progression as determined by duplex scanning did not predict acute complications of deep venous thrombosis.\r"

  ".U": "91012836\r", 
  ".W": "This study was designed to determine if the adventitial vasa vasorum contribute to re-endothelialization of the canine carotid artery after removal of the endothelial flow surface. Casting studies demonstrated that vasa vasorum are present only in the adventitia of the canine carotid artery. Ninety autograft segments of the carotid artery from which the endothelium had been removed were implanted in both carotid arteries of 45 dogs. Glutaraldehyde-processed canine carotid allografts were positioned at each end to prevent pannus ingrowth and a Gore-Tex wrap to prevent periarterial tissue growth was placed into the outer wall. Three methods were used, with observations at 4 and 8 weeks. In method 1 the test segment was treated with superficial endarterectomy. In method 2 a balloon catheter was used to remove the endothelium. In method 3 balloon catheter denudation of the flow surface was also employed and, in addition, the adventitia was removed surgically as completely as possible, although a few vasa vasorum were shown to remain in some grafts. In method 1 all the patent endarterectomized arteries were partially re-endothelialized at both the 4- and 8-week intervals. In method 2, 72% of the balloon-denuded patent arteries with intact adventitial vasa vasorum were partially re-endothelialized at 4 weeks and 84% at 8 weeks. However, in method 3 the flow surfaces had no endothelium at 4 weeks and 83% still had none at 8 weeks. These findings suggest that, in the absence of pannus ingrowth, re-endothelialization of the canine carotid artery depends on not only the presence but also the number of adventitial vasa vasorum.\r"

  ".W": "External iliac fibromuscular dysplasia is a rare and usually asymptomatic disorder. We report eight symptomatic patients seen over a 15-year period and review pathophysiologic mechanisms accounting for the three following distinct lower extremity ischemic sequelae: (1) Emboli--episodic focal digital ischemia (blue toe) was seen in three patients. Resection and primary anastomosis of focal iliac ulcerative fibromuscular dysplasia (one patient) or resection and replacement (two patients) removed the embolic source and relieved the symptoms. (2) Chronic ischemia--gradual onset of full leg claudication in four patients was treated by operative graduated intraluminal dilation in three patients and prosthetic bypass in one. Arteriography subsequently showed a remodeled lumen in the three patients who underwent dilation. (3) Dissection--acute onset leg ischemia resulted from presumed dissection of the external iliac segment. After 4 months of conservative management of antiplatelet agents and exercise, symptoms resolved completely, and arteriogram showed spontaneous restoration of a normal lumen in the dissected segment. The clinical presentation of fibromuscular dysplasia may mimic other arterial processes such as atherosclerosis. Diagnosis is made only by arteriography with specific magnification views of the external iliac arteries and careful surveillance of the renal arteries. Appropriate treatment should be tailored to the clinical presenting symptom. For microembolic disease, resection and replacement are required. For chronic ischemia, intraluminal dilation is generally sufficient and durable and has proved to be a simpler and acceptable alternative to replacement or bypass. In acute dissection, surgical intervention may be deferred if the limb is viable to allow spontaneous healing and remodeling. Persistent symptoms may be the only indication for intervention in this ischemic manifestation of external iliac fibromuscular dysplasia.\r"

This report describes the first 10 cases that were performed in nine patients (five men and four women, mean age 70 years). Indications were asymptomatic stenosis (5), transient ischemic attacks (4), and stroke in evolution (1). There were two emergency cases and eight elective cases (including one reoperative case). Surgical exposure, systemic heparinization, vascular control, and a longitudinal arteriotomy were used. The cleavage plane between atheromas and media was developed with argon ion laser radiation (488 and 514.5 nm) directed through a 300 microns quartz fiber at power 1.0 W. Laser radiation was used to cut the atheromas out of the arteries and weld the end points. Residual atheromatous debris were vaporized with individual laser exposures. Arteriotomies were closed with sutures, and blood flow was restored. The endarterectomies were 3.9 +/- 1.1 cm long and required 330 +/- 97 joules. Mean clamp time was 22.5 +/- 7.9 minutes. Shunts were used in two cases. There were no arterial perforations or injuries as a result of laser light. Complications were hematoma (1), respiratory arrest (1), and transient neurologic deficit (1). Carotid endarterectomy is technically feasible with argon ion laser radiation. In the present series, postoperative observations, averaging 12 months and ranging from 5 to 19 months, have shown satisfactory results. No angiographic follow-up examinations were carried out.\r"

Instability at discharge (important clinical problems usually first occurring prior to discharge) predicted the likelihood of postdischarge deaths. At 90 days postdischarge, 16% of patients discharged unstable were dead vs 10% of patients discharged stable. After the PPS introduction, instability increased primarily among patients discharged home. Prior to the PPS, 10% of patients discharged home were unstable; after the PPS was implemented, 15% were discharged unstable, a 43% relative change. Efforts to monitor the effect of this increase in discharge instability on health should be implemented.\r"

In a multicenter study, 77 women with confirmed bilateral proximal tubal occlusion underwent the procedure. In 71 patients (92%), at least one proximally obstructed fallopian tube was recanalized. Concomitant distal bilateral tubal occlusions were diagnosed after successful proximal tubal balloon recanalizations in 13 patients (17%). In the remaining 64 patients, 22 clinical pregnancies (34%) have been confirmed during a median follow-up period of 12 months. Among those, 17 (77%) resulted in normal deliveries and five (23%) resulted in a first-trimester miscarriage. One patient was diagnosed with an ectopic pregnancy. Among 25 patients who had not conceived within 6 months of the procedure, 17 (68%) demonstrated continuing tubal patency on repeated hysterosalpingogram. We conclude that transcervical balloon tuboplasty is a safe outpatient technique that may represent an alternative to in vitro fertilization or microsurgical reanastomosis of fallopian tubes.\r"

Following the institution of universal precautions, use of rubber gloves at our hospital increased from 1.64 million pairs of 2.81 million pairs annually. A 5-year review of hospital purchasing and supply records in both inpatient and outpatient areas indicated that the total annual costs for isolation materials increased by $350,900. This represented an increase from $13.70 to $22.89 per admission (60%) after adjustment for inflation. The cost of isolation materials increased from $98 to $215 per 1000 outpatient visits, an adjusted increase of 92%. Two thirds of the increase (64%) was due to rubber gloves and an additional 25% was due to disposable isolation gowns. Universal precautions are estimated to have cost at least $336 million in the United States in fiscal year 1989 after adjustment for inflation. If expenditures for isolation materials at our medical center are representative, previous estimates may have significantly underestimated costs nationwide.\r"

Infants born to women who were HIV-1 seropositive were more likely to be premature, of low birth weight, and malnourished at 3 and 6 months of age than were infants born to women who were HIV-1 seronegative. Increased mortality was observed in infants born to women who were HIV-1 seropositive by 3 months of age. At 12 months of age, 23.4% of the infants born to women who were HIV-1 seropositive had died compared with 10.8% of the infants born to women who were HIV-1 seronegative; at 24 months of age, the mortality rates were 31.3% and 14.2%, respectively. Maternal HIV-1 infections resulted in an 11.7% increase in the overall infant mortality rate in this population. The estimated mother-to-infant HIV-1 transmission rate in these breast-fed infants was 25%, similar to the rates reported for non-breast-fed populations in the United States and Europe.\r"

An SNHD was present in nine (17.6%) of 51 people who had evidence of previous Lassa virus infection. Twenty-six of 32 local residents who had previously sustained a sudden deafness had antibody titers to Lassa virus of 16 or greater, compared with six of 32 matched controls. Lassa fever is associated with an incidence of SNHD, which considerably exceeds that previously reported with any other postnatally acquired infection, and accounts for a prevalence of virus-related hearing impairment in the eastern province of Sierra Leone that is greater than that reported from anywhere else in the world.\r"

Human rights violations, such as detention without charge or trial, assault and torture in police custody, and restriction orders, have had devastating effects on the health of persons experiencing them. These violations have occurred in the context of a deliberate policy of discriminatory health care favoring the white minority over the black majority. South Africa's medical societies have had mixed responses to the health problems raised by human rights violations and inequities in the health care system. The amelioration of health care for all and prevention of human rights violations depend on ending apartheid and discrimination and greater government attention to these problems.\r"

Of the 140 elderly patients, 112 went home and 28 went to a nursing home. Considering only patients whose initial rhythms were ventricular fibrillation, the percent of patients discharged alive was substantially higher: 120 (24%) of 493 for elderly patients and 194 (30%) of 639 for younger patients. Elderly patients can benefit from attempted resuscitation from out-of-hospital cardiac arrest.\r"

However, in that group of mothers, as well as for the total of all mothers studied, there were no concomitant improvements in use of early prenatal care, birth weight, or neonatal mortality. Analysis of the timing of enrollment relative to the beginning of pregnancy showed that more than two thirds of the women who enrolled did so after the first trimester.\r"

  ".W": "This prospective, multicenter, randomized, \"unblinded,\" controlled clinical trial was designed to determine if the intrapleural instillation of 1500 mg of tetracycline hydrochloride would be effective in diminishing the ipsilateral rate of recurrence for spontaneous pneumothorax. During the 4-year enrollment period, 113 patients were assigned to the tetracycline group; 116 patients were assigned to the control group. During the 5-year study period, the recurrence rate in the tetracycline group (25%) was significantly less than that in the control group (41%). Use of tetracycline seemed to reduce the recurrence rates for patients with either primary or secondary spontaneous pneumothorax and for patients with either an initial or a recurrent pneumothorax. We conclude that the intrapleural administration of tetracycline in patients with spontaneous pneumothorax significantly reduces the rate of ipsilateral recurrence but is associated with intense chest pain. Intrapleural tetracycline therapy is indicated for patients with a spontaneous pneumothorax who are hospitalized and are treated with tube thoracostomy.\r"

This prospective study evaluated the effect of coffee (275 mg of caffeine) on this substrate with programmed ventricular stimulation in 22 patients with a history of symptomatic nonsustained ventricular tachycardia, ventricular tachycardia, or ventricular fibrillation. Patients underwent electrophysiological testing before and 1 hour after coffee ingestion. Mean (+/- SEM) plasma caffeine level achieved after coffee consumption was 6.2 +/- 0.5 mg/L. Mean plasma catecholamine and potassium values were not altered significantly 1 hour following caffeine ingestion. The number of extrastimuli required to induce an arrhythmia was unchanged in 10 patients (46%), increased in six (27%), and decreased in six (27%). Rhythm severity was unchanged in 17 patients (77%), more severe in two (9%), and less severe in three (14%). In those patients with clinical ventricular arrhythmias, caffeine did not significantly alter inducibility or severity of arrhythmias, suggesting little effect on the substrate supporting ventricular arrhythmias.\r"

The most striking difference in death rates by cause is a markedly lower homicide death rate for Army black men; homicides among the civilian black male population are 12 times more frequent than in the Army. Some factors that might account for these lower mortality rates in the Army are discussed.\r"

The median age of these patients was 42 years, 83% were male, 76% became ill between May and July, and 92% reported recent exposures to ticks. Patients resided in or were exposed to ticks in 14 states, including five where ehrlichiosis had not been reported before 1988. Thirty-four patients (85%) were hospitalized, and many had serious complications, including acute respiratory failure (seven patients), encephalopathy (six patients), and acute renal failure (four patients). Pulmonary infiltrates were demonstrated in 14 patients, cerebrospinal fluid pleocytosis was seen in 10 patients, and elevated levels of serum creatinine were demonstrated in eight patients. Two patients, both of whom had preexisting medical problems, died. Nonhospitalized patients received tetracycline therapy earlier in the course of their illness than hospitalized patients. There was no significant difference in the interval from initiation of antibiotic therapy to the first day of defervescence between patients treated with tetracyclines and those treated with chloramphenicol.\r"

  ".W": "Recent studies of the effects of vitamin D on bone include characterization of the receptors for 1,25-(OH)2D3 in bone and bone derived cells. The receptors show similar affinities in the different tissues. The receptor concentration is affected by the stage of the cell cycle. Glucocorticoid treatment affects the number of receptor sites. The most extensively studied effects of 1,25-(OH)2D3 on macromolecular synthesis in bone have been on collagen, where both anabolic and antianabolic effects are found. Differences in the response may reflect the state of differentiation of the cells. Significant effects are seen on osteocalcin synthesis, although the role of this protein in vitamin D action on bone is still unclear. 1,25-(OH)2D3 influences the activity of alkaline phosphatase and 25-OH-D3 24-hydroxylase in bone. Receptors for growth factors, and production of cytokines may be influenced by 1,25-(OH)2D3 treatment. Although some of these findings would be consistent with direct anabolic effects of vitamin D or its metabolites on bone, such a process has yet to be integrated into the complete picture of vitamin D action at physiological and pharmacological levels in vivo. Recent studies are consistent with earlier results that indicate that hypercalcemic effects of 1,25-(OH)2D3 are mediated by a direct effect on bone. Studies with analogs of 1,25-(OH)2D3 suggest that the stimulation of bone resorption can be dissociated from effects on differentiation of cells of the monocyte lineage.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

New roles for vitamin D in reproduction, parathyroid function, skin proliferation, and differentiation, in myeloid cell differentiation, and as anti-cancer agents will be new areas of investigation. At the basic science level, much effort will be expended to understand how the vitamin D hormone and its receptor bring about gene expression and how these expressed genes bring about cellular functions of the vitamin D system. Similarly, future work will center on the molecular mechanism of regulation of the hydroxylases of the vitamin D endocrine system. All of this is based on the original discovery that vitamin D must be first metabolically altered before function, producing the vitamin D hormone 1 alpha,25-(OH)2D3 in the proximal convoluted tubule cells of the kidney. There is no doubt that the vitamin D area will continue to expand in the next decade as new functions of the vitamin D system are uncovered.\r"

Although the mechanism of this selective activity is not yet clear, these analogues may provide new insights into the differences in action of 1,25-(OH)2D3 in various target tissues. Most importantly, the selective action of these analogues may be exploited for the treatment of diseases such as leukemia, psoriasis and hyperparathyroidism.\r"

Under pathological conditions such as chronic renal failure, extrarenal sources have the potential to normalize serum calcitriol after adequate stimulation (such as, 25(OH)D administration). Extrarenal 1,25-(OH)2D3 synthesis is controlled by physiological levels of calcitriol. However, in sarcoidosis and other granulomatous diseases, 1,25-(OH)2D3 production by macrophages is deregulated, causing severe alterations in systemic calcium homeostasis.\r"
