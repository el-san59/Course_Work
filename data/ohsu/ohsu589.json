Whether intraarticular irradiation affects the composition or biochemistry, and therefore the biomechanical properties, of normal articular cartilage has not been established. In the present study, yttrium 90 silicate was injected into one knee of nine normal adult dogs, and three other dogs received nonradioactive yttrium silicate. When the animals were killed 4 to 13 weeks after the injection, synovium from the irradiated knees showed areas of necrosis and fibrosis. Up to 29% less hyaluronate was synthesized in vitro by the synovial intima from irradiated knees than by the intima from the contralateral knees (mean difference 18%). Morphologic abnormalities were not observed in articular cartilage from either the irradiated or control knees, nor did the water content or concentrations of uronic acid or DNA in cartilage from the irradiated knees differ from that in cartilage from the contralateral knees. However, net 35SO4-labeled glycosaminoglycan synthesis in organ cultures of cartilage from irradiated knees was increased (mean difference 21%, p = 0.03) in comparison with that in cultures of contralateral knee cartilage.\r"

  ".W": "Effects of 1-deamino-8-D-arginine vasopressin (DDAVP; 0.4 microgram/kg iv) were studied in 11 patients with uremia. Bleeding time, platelet retention on glass beads, factor VIII activities, plasma catecholamine levels, and studies on platelet interaction with the subendothelium were performed before, 1 hour after, and 6 hours after DDAVP infusion. Perfusates consisting of normal washed platelets, uremic platelet-poor plasma (u-PPP) and washed red blood cells were perfused through the Baumgartner perfusion system at a shear rate of 800 sec-1. One hour after DDAVP infusion, a shortening in the bleeding time and an increase in platelet retention on glass beads were noticed in these patients (p less than 0.01). Simultaneously, plasma levels of noradrenaline, factor VIII coagulant (FVIII:C), and von Willebrand factor (vWF) activities were statistically increased. Platelet deposition and platelet aggregate formation on subendothelium were consistently increased (p less than 0.05) in perfusions carried out with blood reconstituted with u-PPP obtained 1 hour after DDAVP. The \"in vitro\" addition of 1 U/ml vWF or 1 U/ml vWF plus 1 U/ml factor VIII to the pretreatment u-PPP had no significant influence on the parameters that quantify platelet-subendothelium interaction. However, after the addition of 10 ng/ml noradrenaline to a similar system containing basal u-PPP, a clear improvement (p less than 0.05) in platelet deposition was noticed. Our results confirm the hemostatic effectiveness of DDAVP in patients with uremia and reveal an increased platelet interaction with subendothelium mediated by a factor present in uremic plasma after DDAVP administration.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Systemic heparinization, however, causes impairment of normal coagulation properties and significantly increases the risks of major bleeding complications. It has been observed in the past that ECC may be performed in the absence of any systemic anticoagulants or material surface treatments. In this study, short-term extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) was performed on rabbits in three groups. The animals in the first group received standard clinical dosages of heparin. No form of anticoagulation was used in the second group. The ECMO circuits in the third group were treated with an albumin-heparin complex surface-coating. Thrombosis in the extracorporeal circuit was evaluated by using quantitative scanning electron microscopy. The results indicated very few statistically significant differences between the three experimental systems in the amounts of blood components adhering to the surface. Considerably more platelet activation and attachment was noted in the systemic heparin group. These experiments failed to demonstrate any benefit of systemic heparinization in short-term ECMO. The findings from these experiments suggest that the current levels of systemic heparinization may be unwarranted, and they indicate that more controlled studies must be performed to determine optimal levels of anticoagulation for different applications of ECC.\r"

These data indicate that family physicians and general practitioners see nearly 45% of all outpatients with dizziness. In primary care practices (family physicians, general practitioners, and general internists) the frequency of dizziness as a presenting complaint rises steadily with age, so that nearly 7% of patients aged 85 years and older present with that symptom. Women complain of dizziness more frequently than men, with this relationship being particularly prominent in older age categories. According to primary care physicians who gathered data for the 1981 and 1985 surveys, dizziness was the principal reason for visit (chief complaint) of 2.61% of patients aged 25 years and older (531 recorded encounters). Of these patients, 66.7% were women; 1.5% were hospitalized; 4.4% were referred to specialists; and 89.3% left with a drug prescription. Hypertension was the most frequent diagnosis recorded among these patients who complained of dizziness. Several of the most common diagnoses recorded for these visits (hypertension, diabetes, unspecified dizziness, and coronary arteriosclerosis) differ from common causes of dizziness reported by specialty clinics.\r"

In a sample of 197 medical patients interviewed with the Diagnostic Interview Schedule, only 7.1% met DSM-III criteria for somatization disorder, but nearly one third of these patients met criteria for an abridged notion of somatization. Patients with current and lifetime major depression had significantly higher mean totals of positive somatic symptoms compared with controls who had no psychiatric disorder. Nearly one half of these patients with one or more depressive episodes in the course of their lifetime met the abridged criteria for somatization. This association of major depression with somatization is quite similar to findings from the Epidemiologic Catchment Area study suggesting that major depression, not the somatoform disorders, may be associated with most of the somatization seen in medical clinics.\r"

We present a case of a deer carcass with a wound of uncertain firearm or archery origin which initiated a comparison of firearm wounds and archery wounds on fresh road-killed deer. We found the following features to be valuable in the differentiation of gunshot wounds and field-tipped archery wounds: First, the majority of the gunshot wounds (but none of the arrow wounds) had identifiable, macroscopic, wipe-off material and chemically identifiable wipe-off residue by spot test. Second, the archery wound defects had very inconspicuous abrasion rings as compared to the often prominent abrasion rings of gunshot wounds. Third, the actual central defect in the archery wounds was more likely to be oblong or slit-like compared to the gunshot wound defects, which were more likely to be round.\r"

The pattern of skeletal damage can indicate whether the body was scavenged while intact or at some time after other natural processes of disarticulation had begun. This study analyzed thirty partially to fully skeletonized human remains with respect to scavenging at the time of body discovery in order to determine if a patterned consumption sequence existed. The scavengers were primarily coyotes (Canis latrans) and domestic dogs (C. familiaris). Sixteen non-carnivore-scavenged remains were also examined and contrasted with the carnivore-scavenged sample. Observed postmortem intervals from death to recovery ranged from 4 h to 52 months. Results demonstrate that canid scavenging of human remains takes place in sequential stages: Stage 0 = no bony involvement; Stage 1 = ventral thorax damaged and one or both extremities removed; Stage 2 = lower extremity involvement; Stage 3 = only vertebral segments remain articulated; and Stage 4 = total disarticulation. Results revealed a clear correspondence between stages of disarticulation and the postmortem interval.\r"

  ".W": "The environment of southern Arizona with mild winters and hot, dry summers produces great variability in decay rates of human remains. Summer temperatures, which range well over 38 degrees C (100 degrees F), induce rapid bloating as a result of the accumulation of decompositional gases. However, in certain circumstances, the aridity can lead to extensive mummification, allowing preservation of remains for hundreds of years. A retrospective study of 189 cases, concentrating on remains found on the desert floor or in the surrounding mountains and on remains found within closed structures, outlines the time frame and sequences of the decay process. Remains can retain a fresh appearance for a considerable time in the winter, but the onset of marked decomposition is rapid in the summer months. Bloating of the body usually is present two to seven days following death. Following this, within structures, there is frequently rapid decomposition and skeletonization. With outdoor exposure, remains are more likely to pass through a long period of dehydration of outer tissues, mummification, and reduction of desiccated tissue. Exposure of large portions of the skeleton usually does not occur until four to six months after death. Bleaching and exfoliation of bone--the beginning stages of destruction of the skeletal elements--begins at about nine months' exposure. Insect activity, including that of maggot and beetle varieties, may accelerate decomposition, but this process is greatly affected by location of the body, seasonal weather, and accessibility of the soft tissues. Carnivores and other scavengers also are contributing factors, as are clothing or covering of the body, substrate, elevation, and latitude.\r"

Subsequent examinations determined this \"fiber\" to be the larva of a common freshwater midge (Diptera; Chironomidae). Chironomid larvae have been observed on other bodies recovered from freshwater environments. Entomological studies of this organism have led to the conclusion that the presence of chironomid larvae indicates submersion of the body.\r"

In cases of sexual offenses, in which a swab has been used to wipe out the vagina, the female cells and their nuclei on that swab may also contain the heads of spermatozoa. After as short a time as 30 min of proteinase K treatment, the spermatozoa that had separated from the enzymatically destroyed vaginal cells were recovered. This proteinase destruction furnishes some spermatozoa with deformed heads and a somewhat greater number of isolated tails though a sufficient number of spermatozoan heads still remain for a reliable diagnosis. For detection of spermatozoa from a vaginal swab after proteinase K pretreatment, the heads of the spermatozoa are distinctly stained by Oppitz's method. Further, on prior treatment with proteinase K, the ABO blood grouping of the spermatozoa could also be determined on the vaginal swab by using the absorption-elution technique. The resistance of the spermatozoa to proteinase K is the basis for this method.\r"

A forensic science team from the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology, comprised of 6 dental officers, 3 forensic pathologists, and 3 medical photographers, worked in concert with the Polish forensic science team. The small number of antemortem records and the extreme fragmentation of the remains presented a new scenario for computer use. Typically, the Computer-Assisted Postmortem Identification (CAPMI) software is used to compare remains against an antemortem database. Results are listed by the number of tooth-to-tooth matches based on restorative or other characteristics or both. The Polish disaster confounded this approach to some degree, however, and suggested a reconsideration of the theory on which the sort is made, that is, that the cases with maximum number of matches to preexisting dental records would be the most likely identification (ID) match. A hypothesis was constructed that, if searches were accomplished for fragments with a minimum number of mismatches, the correct matches would appear higher in the rank order. Six antemortem records (that had all dental information) were sorted against one hundred and twelve postmortem fragmented records. The resulting report was reordered so that records were listed by minimum number of mismatches. There was significant improvement in rank placement for all of the records. Thus it was accepted that in the situation of highly fragmented remains a different sorting based on the number of mismatches is indicated. Programming changes to make this option available have been implemented in the new version of CAPMI.\r"

Two species of fly larvae, Chrysomya megacephala (Fabricius) and Chrysomya rufifacies (Macquart), were present on the remains. A sample of these larvae was analyzed for malathion content. A total of 574 micrograms of malathion was detected in 0.26 g of pooled larvae, or a level corresponding to 2050 micrograms/g of larvae. Presence of organophosphates in arthropod larvae has not been documented previously and the analysis of larvae from decomposing remains may prove a useful technique for detection of these toxicants in decomposing remains.\r"

A booklet, using ICD codes, for classifying in-patients and out-patients seen by neurologists has been developed. It is simple and easy to use, affords the necessary economy of time, and should result in uniformity of coding. Reliability studies confirm that inaccuracies occur when patients' diagnoses are coded retrospectively from their medical files, even when observers are medically trained. It is recommended that doctors should accept personal responsibility for coding patients' diagnoses at the time of consultation or discharge from hospital.\r"

MRI of the brain frequently shows abnormalities in the hemispheric subcortical white matter; these are demonstrable in the majority of patients and support the clinical diagnosis of multiple sclerosis. Our studies have shown that while MRI identifies such cerebral lesions in nearly all clinically definite multiple sclerosis patients with illness of duration greater than 10 years, these areas of abnormal T2 signal are present less often in the brains of patients studied within 3 years of disease onset. However, symptoms referable to the long tracts of the spinal cord are prominent in many of these patients. Imaging of the spinal cord has presented technical problems because of the small size of the cord, patient body, heart and respiratory movements, and limitations of surface coil technology. The spinal cord of 77 patients with multiple sclerosis have been imaged, revealing three types of abnormalities: (1) approximately half the cords show regions of abnormal T2 weighted signal; (2) during acute exacerbation, spinal cord enlargement (swelling) may be observed; (3) spinal cord atrophy (narrowing) is found particularly in patients with disease of longer duration and greater disability. Unlike the presence of brain lesions, the existence of spinal cord lesions of high T2 signal is not associated with increasing duration of disease but is correlated with disability status. Of patients with such lesions about one fifth did not exhibit brain lesions discernible by MRI.\r"

An excellent therapeutic response to oxcarbazepine was seen in all patients with pain control correlating well with serum drug concentrations of oxcarbazepine and its primary active metabolite 10-OH-carbazepine. Onset of the effect was observed within 24 hours in all cases. An overall serum therapeutic concentration range, in the six patients, of 50-110 mumol/l of 10-OH-carbazepine corresponding to a daily effective dose range of 1200-2400 mg (14.6-35.6 mg/kg body weight) oxcarbazepine, was observed. There was a significant correlation between oxcarbazepine dose and serum oxcarbazepine (r = 0.695, p less than 0.05) and 10-OH-carbazepine (r = 0.957, p less than 0.001) concentrations. Oxcarbazepine was well tolerated and no significant side effects were identified, though a mild hyponatraemia was observed during high doses (greater than 28 and greater than 35 mg/kg/day) in two patients. It is concluded that oxcarbazepine has potent antineuralgic properties in the absence of significant side effects and therefore may be useful in the management of intractable trigeminal neuralgia.\r"

His eldest son developed an eye-winking tic with facial grimacing at the age of 8 years, and in another son, a self-limiting period of eye-blinking occurred at the age of 4 years. The recovery cycle of the blink reflex was abnormal in all three generations. Three other children with eye-winking tics have a parent or close relative with frequent eye-blinking or blepharospasm. Five patients with adult-onset blepharospasm or Meige's syndrome are also described who had excessive eye-blinking dating back to childhood. It is suggested that eye-winking tics, frequent blinking and blepharospasm may share common pathophysiological mechanisms; the clinical expression may be age-related.\r"

Fluctuations in plasma LNAA concentrations could therefore contribute to variability in clinical response to levodopa. The hourly plasma levodopa, plasma LNAAs and clinical response were investigated in 11 fluctuating Parkinsonian patients on a regular hospital diet. The fluctuations in plasma levodopa were 2 to 3 times greater than the fluctuations of plasma LNAAs. The correlation between clinical response and plasma levodopa was substantially improved in only one patient by considering plasma LNAAs and calculating relative levodopa flux into brain. Although plasma LNAAs significantly increased during the day, the patients' clinical status did not uniformly deteriorate and mean afternoon clinical scores correlated better with mean plasma levodopa and levodopa flux than with mean plasma LNAAs. Minimum effective concentrations of levodopa for clinical response did not correlate with 9 am LNAA concentrations. It is concluded that in most patients, the relatively small variation in plasma LNAAs in comparison with the large variations in plasma levodopa indicates that fluctuations in LNAA are not an important contributor to the fluctuating response to levodopa.\r"

NCVs were contrasted with the newer technique of measurement of alternating current perception thresholds (CPTs) in assessing the quantitative level of correlation with severity of diabetic sensory neuropathy. A very detailed, scored neurological history (symptoms) and physical examination, emphasising sensory assessment, was conducted on 71 individuals with diabetic neuropathy of varying degrees of severity. Sensory and motor NCVs and CPTs at 5, 250, and 2000 Hz of the upper and lower extremities were determined for these individuals. In addition, vibration thresholds (VTs) were measured as a third modality. Twenty eight individuals underwent repeated evaluations at 2, 6, 10 and 12 months after the initial procedures. Using the results of 169 complete evaluations, correlations were determined between physical scores (PS) and symptoms scores (SS) and NCVs. NCV correlations with the SS were weaker than with the PS. The strongest of the correlations were found between the PS and motor NCVs of the median nerve (rho = 0.29) and the tibial nerve (rho = 0.38). Normal NCVs were present in the face of very significant historical and physical abnormality. Correlations of the SS and PS with both VTs and CPTs were higher than with the NCVs. CPTs proved the more effective as predictors of both symptomatic and physical impairment. NCVs appear to lack the resolving power necessary to evaluate subtle differences in clinical state of diabetic sensory neuropathy. The supplementary use of current perception testing may improve the quantitative assessment of this condition.\r"

One hundred and thirty eight cases of intracranial haemorrhage were found, 89 of cerebral embolism, 101 of cerebral arterial thrombosis and 34 of cerebral venous thrombosis. Nearly 37% of the affected patients were below 40 years of age. Cerebral embolism and cerebrovenous thrombosis were important causes of stroke in the young. Rheumatic heart disease and infective endocarditis formed the major causes of cerebral embolism. Cerebral venous thrombosis associated with pregnancy and puerperium was relatively more common in our series than has been reported in the West.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE To compare the provision of health and social services between a social work intervention and non-intervention group. DESIGN Depressed stroke patients were randomly assigned to either an intervention or non-intervention group. Over a 4 month period both groups were visited three times by an independent assessor who rated them on service provision and functional independence. SETTING Patients' homes. PATIENTS 44 depressed stroke patients. INTERVENTION Both groups were given an information booklet and the intervention group were then visited regularly by a research social worker over a period of 4 months. The social worker adopted a pragmatic approach which included providing counselling and information on services and benefits. MAIN RESULTS The study groups did not differ in level of social independence (p greater than 0.05) or total number of financial benefits (p greater than 0.05), services (p greater than 0.05) or aids (p greater than 0.05) received either before or after intervention. When the results from the two groups were combined, home help and meals-on-wheels were the most frequently provided services (25% of patients). Walking aids (72% of patients) and bath aids (59% of patients) were the most frequently provided aids to daily living. CONCLUSION Social work assistance had little effect on service provision or level of functional independence.\r"

  ".W": "In a nested case-control design the Body Mass Index at 18 years of age was related to 32-year mortality from coronary heart disease (ICD-codes: 410-414) and cancer (ICD-codes: 140-208) among the 1932 Dutch male birth cohort. By means of a logistic regression model the risk ratios were estimated for four BMI-categories: less than or equal to 18.99, 19.00-19.99, 20.00-24.99, greater than or equal to 25.00. Information on blood pressure, resting heart rate, initial health status, education and region of origin was available and these factors were taken into account as possible confounders. The mortality rate for coronary heart disease was highest for the men in the fattest group, while the leanest group showed an excess cancer mortality. The adjusted coronary heart disease mortality risk ratio was elevated for both BMI-categories above the reference category of 19.00-19.99, with an estimate of 2.5 for the men with a BMI greater than or equal to 25.00 at the age of 18. An increased cancer mortality risk ratio of 1.4, mainly due to lung cancer, was observed during the last 20 years of the 32-year follow-up period for the men with a BMI less than or equal to 18.99. The importance of age and differentiation of causes of death in interpreting the results of prospective studies is discussed.\r"

Black females had the highest prevalence of physical disability (55.8%), followed by white females (43.2%), black males (39.0%) and white males (25.8%) and high SES black males (22.3%). Physical disability was 1.5-2.5 times as prevalent among individuals with a history of cardiovascular disease (CVD) than those without such a history. Among individuals without a current history of CVD univariate analyses showed the following as significant (lower 95% CI greater than 1.0) predictors of physical disability: elevated systolic blood pressure in white females, black males, and black females; elevated cholesterol in black females; obesity in black females; and low educational level in white females. Regression analyses indicated that obesity in 1960 accounted for 10.9 and 2.9% respectively of the variability in physical disability scores in 1985 for black females and white females.\r"

In order to address the biases which may confound simple comparisons of morbidity when treatment allocation is non-random, multiple regression was used to identify and adjust for the effect of pre-treatment variables significantly (p less than 0.01) influencing hospitalization rate. Six significant variables were identified out of 86 studied. Adverse factors were (i) diabetes and (ii) atherosclerotic disease. Beneficial parameters were (iii) a living spouse and (iv) a controlled presentation via outpatients. The relationship (v) between age and hospitalization rate was U-shaped; the rate increasing above the age of 60 years and below the age 20. (vi) Date of commencement of dialysis exhibited a complex relationship with hospitalization rate implying that whilst the rate on HD remained relatively stable over the course of the study, that on CAPD markedly diminished. As a result, the hospitalization ratio (CAPD:HD) fell consistently throughout the study period, at an estimated annual rate of 28.3% (95% confidence limits 15.6-39.1%). For a patient starting therapy on 1 January 1980 the predicted hospitalization rate on CAPD was 7.8 times greater than that on HD (4.4-13.9) but by 1 May 1985 the estimated ratio had fallen to 1.33 (0.85-2.09). Having adjusted for important confounding, it would appear that with growing experience, hospitalization rates on CAPD fall close to those on HD.\r"

This poses the problem of constructing a measure of longevity that: (1) will make subjects in the sample comparable regarding survival time, independent of their age and sex; (2) is suitable for long-term follow-up studies; (3) can be used to check the absence or presence of selectivity of the sample with regard to longevity; (4) improves the comparability of studies with different designs and sampling schemes; (5) can take the mortality development over time into account. An individual measure of survival time is presented that satisfies these requirements: the realized probability of dying (RPD). Its construction is described. The RPD is derived from population life tables based on age, year of birth, and sex. For each subject, the relative position on the survival curve within the birth cohort is determined. In an illustration, the RPD is applied to data from a 28-year follow-up study of the elderly in the Netherlands. A comparison is made with other survival measures commonly used in this type of study. It is concluded that the RPD is a powerful and valid measure of longevity in elderly subjects, and that it can be useful in the study of determinants of longevity.\r"

Cerebral stroke and cardiac disease tended to be overdiagnosed, while malignant neoplasms were underdiagnosed. The validation of certified diagnosis was less reliable in the aged population, and in type-specific diagnosis of cardiovascular diseases. Cerebral hemorrhage with false negative or false positive diagnoses was usually classified into type unspecified stroke or different categories of cerebral stroke, while those misdiagnosed as cases of cerebral infarction frequently had no significant lesions in the autopsied brain. Finally, the relationship between the validation of diagnosis on the death certificates and the secular trend in cardiovascular disease in the Japanese vital statistics was discussed.\r"

Patient acceptance was high, with only two patients (4%) refusing to complete therapy. The median actual dose delivered was 88% of the planned dose for cisplatin, 78% for 5-FU, and 70 Gy for radiation. Weight loss of 10% or more and severe mucositis were the most common side effects (53% and 48% incidence, respectively). All patients were followed at least 1 year (median, 51 months). While the complete response rate (55%) seemed no better than that reported in other series, freedom of progression of regional disease (73%), and the survival of all patients (median, 37 months) were substantially improved. Only 33% of partial responders have failed regionally, while 15% of complete responders have failed regionally (P greater than .10), which indicates that clinical assessment of response was unreliable. Stage, the presence of N3 disease, and delivery of less than the median actual dose received of 5-FU (but not cisplatin) were significantly associated with failure. This regimen is feasible and tolerable in this difficult patient population. It generally requires no special forced feeding techniques. Survival results from this limited institution study appear better than those using sequential multimodality therapies. With such favorable regional control, this approach may offer an alternative in the future to radical surgery and radiation in resectable disease. More definitive evaluation seems warranted.\r"

  ".W": "Various measures of immune response were assessed prior to induction chemotherapy (intravenous [IV] cisplatin, fluorouracil [5-FU], and bleomycin) in 43 previously untreated head and neck cancer patients to derive a clinical response prediction model. These were parameters of functional cellular immunity (natural killer [NK] cell activity, lymphocyte blastogenesis response to mitogens), total lymphocyte and lymphocyte subset numbers and percentages, and circulating humoral immunity (total immunoglobulin, immunoglobulin classes, and C1q binding activity [C1q BA]). The C1q BA may reflect levels of circulating immune complexes within peripheral blood. The objective primary tumor response rate was 65% (16 complete responses and 12 partial responses). Univariate logistic regression analysis showed that failure to respond to therapy was significantly related to higher value (vis-a-vis response) of humoral immune parameters total immunoglobulin (Ig), P less than .01; IgG, P less than .01; and C1q BA, P less than .001. No association between cellular immune response measurements and response to chemotherapy was identified. By multivariate logistic regression analysis, only C1q BA levels were predictive of drug therapy responsiveness (P less than .001). Results extend our previous investigations regarding C1q BA measurement in head and neck cancer patients, and show that C1q BA levels add accuracy of prediction of subsequent chemotherapy response to that based solely on standard staging criteria and other parameters of immune status.\r"

Twenty percent of patients with measurable tumor experienced an objective regression and 39% of those with the carcinoid syndrome experienced a reduction of more than 50% in urine 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5HIAA) excretion. Flushing was partially or completely relieved in 65% of patients and diarrhea was relieved in 33%. Regrettably, these favorable treatment effects were transient in nature, with objective regressions persisting for a median of only 7 weeks and hormonal responses for a median of only 4 weeks. Any therapeutic gain experienced by these patients seemed to be outweighed by the frequency and severity of toxic reactions, which consisted primarily of chills and fever, fatigue, anorexia, weight loss, leukopenia, and abnormalities of liver function. Whereas other interferons, administration by alternative dosages and regimens, or incorporation of interferons into drug combinations may merit future study, we cannot recommend recombinant leukocyte A interferon, administered by the methods we employed, for routine therapy of the carcinoid tumor or syndrome.\r"

All had obtained complete remission during treatment; none had relapsed at last follow-up examination. All blood samples, including serum magnesium, were normal. The arterial vasoconstrictor response to cold in the finger was measured by cuff- and strain-gauge techniques at 30, 15, and 10 degrees C. Blood pressure (BP) was measured auscultatorily, using a 12-cm broad cuff on the ipsilateral upper arm. Fourteen patients (44%) had developed anamnestic RP, and all showed an exaggerated response to cold; arterial closure was provoked in nine patients. Eighteen patients (56%) were without finger symptoms. These patients had an exaggerated response to cold in comparison with controls, and in two patients, RP was provoked. None of the patients had an increased systolic pressure gradient from arm to finger when compared with a control group. Thus, an exaggerated cold response was found to be a prolonged vasospastic side effect not only in patients with RP, but also in patients without finger symptoms.\r"

Bleomycin was also used in the patients with non-small-cell lung cancer. During the first cycle of chemotherapy, 30 patients received antiemetic therapy with intermittent metoclopramide (regimen A), and the other 30 patients received continuous infusion metoclopramide (regimen B). During the second course of chemotherapy, patients were switched to the alternate regimen. Regimen A consisted of lorazepam, 1 mg, orally; dexamethasone, 10 mg, intravenously (IV) every four hours for three doses; diphenhydramine, 0.5 mg/kg, IV every four hours for three doses; metoclopramide, 1 mg/kg, IV bolus every two hours for six doses. Regimen B was identical to A except metoclopramide was administered as 1 mg/kg, IV bolus followed by 0.5 mg/kg/h for ten hours. Fifty-eight patients completed both antiemetic regimens. Thirty-nine of the 58 patients had total control of acute nausea and vomiting (0-1 episodes) with regimen A or B. Fourteen patients had poor control of acute nausea and vomiting (more than one episode) with regimen A but total control with regimen B. Five patients had poor control with either regimen. Dystonic reactions, akathisia, or diarrhea occurred in 20 of the 58 patients on regimen A, but in only eight of the 58 patients on regimen B. Compared with intermittent bolus, continuous infusion metoclopramide is more effective in total control of acute nausea and vomiting and has less toxicity.\r"

The total doses of epirubicin ranged from 180 mg/m2 to 918 mg/m2 (mean, 491 +/- 187). No patient had prior heart disease, hypertension, mediastinal irradiation, or chemotherapy with other anthracycline agents. None of the patients developed overt heart failure, significant arrhythmias, ECG alterations, or roentgenographic changes in heart size. There was no significant change in the mean value of echocardiographic percent fractional shortening before and after epirubicin therapy. Patients receiving epirubicin doses less than 450 mg/m2 had minimal hemodynamic disturbances; however, no cut-off point separating two significantly different subpopulations could be demonstrated. Endomyocardial biopsy was performed on all patients; 20 biopsies were evaluable. Histologic and ultrastructural changes were similar to those caused by other anthracycline agents. A strong correlation was demonstrated between total dose of epirubicin and pathologic change as quantified using the Billingham scale (r = .7, P = .0006). A cut-off point beyond which there was a probability of increased pathologic damage was statistically defined at 450 mg/m2 of epirubicin. Severe pathologic alterations and moderate hemodynamic changes were observed in only one patient, who received 918 mg/m2 of epirubicin. Patients who are expected to receive epirubicin in excess of 450 mg/m2 should be monitored for cardiac toxicity, and continuation of epirubicin therapy beyond 900 mg/m2 should be based on the results of monitoring.\r"

In the present report, we describe briefly the methodological differences that led to the opposite conclusions based on this single set of data. The errors of reporting and omissions of the first article (A) are similar to those that have been extracted from recent issues of the Journal of Clinical Oncology and other leading cancer journals, although they have not all appeared within a single report.

  ".W": "Pharmacological treatments directed at increasing cortical acetylcholine activity in patients with Alzheimer's disease have largely been disappointing, perhaps because denervated areas of brain may not be exposed to adequate amounts of drug. A new method has been developed to enable localized intracerebral delivery of neurotransmitter substances using a polymeric drug delivery system. Microspheres of a polyanhydride sebacic acid copolymer were impregnated with bethanechol, an acetylcholinesterase-resistant cholinomimetic. Twenty rats received bilateral fimbria-fornix lesions, producing cholinergic denervation of the hippocampus and marked impairment in spatial memory. The animals were trained for 2 weeks to run after which they received bilateral intrahippocampal implants of saline (five rats), blank polymer (five rats), or bethanechol-impregnated polymer (10 rats). Following implantation, spatial memory was assessed by radial-maze performance testing for 40 days. Untreated lesioned rats showed persistently poor spatial memory, entering maze arms with near random frequency. Similarly, animals treated with saline and blank polymer did not improve after implantation. Rats treated with bethanechol-impregnated microspheres, however displayed significant improvement within 10 days after implantation; this improvement persisted for the duration of the experiment (p less than 0.05, Student's t-test). Histological analysis of regional acetylcholinesterase staining showed widespread loss of activity throughout the hippocampus bilaterally in all animals. The microsphere implants were visible within the hippocampus, with minimal reactive changes in surrounding brain. It is concluded that intracerebral polymeric drug delivery successfully reversed lesion-induced memory deficits, and has potential as a neurosurgical treatment method for Alzheimer's disease and other neurodegenerative disorders.\r"

Intravenous injections of 3H-PK11195 (1-(2-chlorophenyl)-N-methyl-N-(1-methylpropyl)-3-isoquinoline carboxamide) or 3H-flunitrazepam in combination with clonazepam revealed high densities of peripheral benzodiazepine binding in glial tumors, with less binding in metastatic tumors. Peripheral binding was displaced by preadministration of excess PK11195. Topographical correlation was excellent between areas of histologically verified tumor and high densities of peripheral benzodiazepine binding. The choroid plexus, ependyma, and pineal gland also showed a moderate level of binding, but there was little binding in other normal brain structures or necrotic tissue. Binding densities were three- to fivefold higher in C6 glial tumors compared to normal cortex. Injection of 3H-flunitrazepam alone, which binds to both central and peripheral receptors, had the advantage of showing normal anatomic structures in addition to a clear definition of tumor topography. The potential value of peripheral benzodiazepine ligands in selectively imaging brain tumors in man with positron emission tomography is discussed.\r"

At normal resting pressures there was no positive pressure gradient between the CSF and sinus venous blood in 2-, 10-, and 20-day-old rats, but in 31-day-old and adult rats there was a positive gradient of 16 and 12 mm H2O, respectively. A series of constant-rate infusions of artificial CSF was made into the cisterna magna, and subsequent plateaus in both CSF and venous blood were recorded. The gradient of a plot of plateau pressure against infusion rate gave the overall resistance to absorption of the CSF for each age group, which was higher in 2- and 10-day-old rats than at three older ages. The effect on dural venous pressure was age-related, with the largest increase at 2 days, the smallest at 20 days, and no effect at 31 days or in adults. The pressure difference between CSF and sinus blood has been used to calculate resistance to absorption across the sinus wall. This showed that the high overall resistance to drainage in young rats can be largely accounted for by the rise in sinus pressure. It is concluded that drainage of CSF into the sinuses is greatly restricted in young animals.\r"

Angiography could have been avoided had this pitfall been recognized, and had a gradient-echo flow-imaging protocol been utilized. This latter approach (which does not replace spin-echo imaging) is more sensitive to flowing blood and thus allows differentiation of an air space from a nonthrombosed aneurysm.\r"

In selected patients, this approach is efficacious in the treatment of extradural compressive lesions from the cervicomedullary junction to the C-4 vertebra. The authors have used the transoral surgical approach in treating 53 patients with lesions compressing the ventral extradural brain stem or the cervical cord. The evaluation, management, and long-term outcome of these patients are described (median follow-up time 24 months). The operative morbidity rate in this series was 6%, and the operative mortality rate was zero. The authors review specific features of the transoral procedure, including methods of retraction, microsurgical techniques, and adjunctive measures to avoid cerebrospinal fluid fistulae, that contributed to these good results.\r"

  ".W": "A group of 35 patients undergoing intracranial surgery who exhibited perioperative thrombocytopenia (platelet count less than 150,000/microliters) was studied retrospectively. Of the 35 patients, 14 (40%) developed postoperative intracranial hematomas requiring reoperation and seven (20%) died within 2 weeks after the operation. Analysis revealed that a perioperative platelet count below 100,000/microliters in a patient who failed to respond to platelet transfusions was associated with a higher risk of postoperative hematoma formation. All six patients with this profile developed postoperative hematomas. If the platelet count rose promptly from below 100,000/microliters to a normal level after platelet transfusions, the incidence of hematoma formation decreased dramatically. None of the three patients with this response developed postoperative hematoma. In patients in whom an acute drop in platelet count from the normal range to between 100,000 and 124,000/microliters occurred in the immediate perioperative period, there was a significantly higher change of hematoma formation; this finding has not hitherto been described. Of the 14 patients with this clinical course, eight developed postoperative hematoma after craniotomy for tumors and vascular lesions. This latter observation was substantiated by the fact that thrombocytopenic patients with postoperative hematomas had a greater reduction in platelet count than thrombocytopenic patients with no postoperative hematomas (p = 0.0004).\r"

The increased signal intensity following the intravenous infusion of contrast medium may improve the ability of MR imaging to delineate tumors. The use of this method in 15 pediatric patients with suspected brain-tumor recurrence was analyzed. All 15 patients underwent postoperative Gd-DTPA-enhanced MR imaging, and residual tumor was demonstrated in nine of them. Based on the findings of the enhanced MR studies, four patients had additional surgery, two underwent radiation therapy, and one was given immunotherapy. Continued surveillance was recommended for the remaining eight patients. In all cases the enhanced MR imaging studies were superior to the unenhanced studies in regard to the qualitative and quantitative assessment of the residual tumor. Gadolinium-DTPA-enhanced MR imaging appears to be a safe and effective means of providing an accurate postoperative assessment of residual disease in pediatric brain-tumor patients. It is as effective as contrast-enhanced computerized tomography and has the sensitivity and anatomic resolution provided by MR imaging. The most useful role of this agent was in the postoperative period, in assessing the adequacy of surgical resection. This technique is recommended as the procedure of choice in the postoperative assessment and long-term surveillance of patients with brain tumors.\r"

The patients were classified into three groups according to their actual outcome after 6 months: death (22 patients); persistent vegetative state or severe disability (eight patients); and moderate disability or good recovery (13 patients). By applying stepwise logistic discriminant analysis to the patients' data, five significant risk factors were selected: degree of neurological damage assessed by cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) extrapolated creatine kinase BB isoenzyme activity, Glasgow-Liege Coma Scale score, age, incidence of thoracic injury, and intracranial pressure (ICP). Extrapolated creatine kinase BB activity had the highest prognostic ability (67%). Uncontrollable elevated ICP proved to be systematically associated with death, whereas its absence was not necessarily indicative of a favorable outcome. The combination of the five variables yielded a total prognostic efficiency of 91%. The percentages of correctly predicted patients for the three outcome groups were, respectively, 100%, 50%, and 100%. Thus, half of the persistently vegetative and severely disabled patients were identified by the selected factors.\r"

The PVI was not related to patient's age, duration of disease, type of hydrocephalus, or ventricular size, indicating that the relationship between PVI and Rcsf was genuine and not caused by patient selection.

  ".U": "89293228\r", 
  ".W": "The literature suggests that in children with severe head injury, cerebral hyperemia is common and related to high intracranial pressure (ICP). However, there are very few data on cerebral blood flow (CBF) after severe head injury in children. This paper presents 72 measurements of cerebral blood flow (\"CBF15\"), using the 133Xe inhalation method, with multiple detectors over both hemispheres in 32 children aged 3 to 18 years (mean 13.6 years) with severe closed head injury (average Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score 5.4). In 25 of the children, these were combined with measurements of arteriojugular venous oxygen difference (AVDO2) and of cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen (CMRO2). In 30 patients, the first measurement was taken approximately 12 hours postinjury. In 18 patients, an indication of brain stiffness was obtained by withdrawal and injection of ventricular cerebrospinal fluid and calculation of the pressure-volume index (PVI) of Marmarou. The CBF and CMRO2 data were correlated with the GCS score, outcome, ICP, and PVI. Early after injury, CBF tended to be lower with lower GCS scores, but this was not statistically significant. This trend was reversed 24 hours postinjury, as significantly more hyperemic values were recorded the lower the GCS score, with the exception of the most severely injured patients (GCS score 3). In contrast, mean CMRO2 correlated positively with the GCS score and outcome throughout the course, but large standard deviations preclude making predictions based on CMRO2 measurements in individual patients. Early after injury, there was mild uncoupling between CBF and CMRO2 (CBF above metabolic demands, low AVDO2) and, after 24 hours, flow and metabolism were completely uncoupled with an extremely low AVDO2. Consistently reduced flow as found in only four patients; 28 patients (88%) showed hyperemia at some point in their course. This very high percentage of patients with hyperemia, combined with the lowest values of AVDO2 found in the literature, indicates that hyperemia or luxury perfusion is more prevalent in this group of patients. The three patients with consistently the highest CBF had consistently the lowest PVI: thus, the patients with the most severe hyperemia also had the stiffest brains. Nevertheless, and in contrast to previous reports, no correlation could be established between the course of ICP or PVI and the occurrence of hyperemia, nor was there a correlation between the levels of CBF and ICP at the time of the measurements. The authors argue that this lack of correlation is due to: 1) a definition of hyperemia that is too generous, and 2) the lack of a systematic relationship between CBF and cerebral blood volume\r"

A baseline 133Xe CBF measurement was performed and then repeated, after blood pressure was increased by 29% with intravenous phenylephrine or decreased by 26% with intravenous trimethaphan camsylate. Correlations were made between CBF and clinical condition, outcome, time after injury, intracranial pressure (ICP), and pressure-volume index (PVI) changes, and the site of injury (hemispheres, diencephalon, or brain stem). The site of injury was determined with multimodality evoked potential measurements. Autoregulation was intact in 22 (59%) of 37 measurements. There was no correlation with GCS score, outcome, time after injury, site of injury, or way of testing (decreasing or increasing blood pressure). Autoregulation was statistically significantly more often impaired when CBF was either below normal -2 standard deviations (SD) (reduced flow) or above normal +2 SD (absolute hyperemia). In cases with intact autoregulation, mean ICP decreased from 17.5 to 15.0 mm Hg with higher blood pressure and increased from 19.0 to 21.3 mm Hg with lower blood pressure. When PVI was measured during the blood pressure manipulations, it was found to change in a direction opposite to the ICP change. The consequences of these findings in the management of ICP problems with blood pressure control are discussed.\r"

Overexpression of this gene is seen in the majority of primary tumors; however, the role of the EGF-R gene in glial tumorigenesis is unknown. The authors explored the relationship between EGF-R gene expression and glioblastoma cell growth in vitro and in vivo and found that this level of EGF-R gene expression did not correlate with tumor cell growth either in soft agar or in the nude mouse. This suggests that the EGF-R gene is not involved in effecting direct growth stimulation in glial oncogenesis. Tumorigenesis involves differentiation arrest; therefore, the expression of several proto-oncogenes in neuroectodermal tumors was investigated to evaluate the potential involvement of the EGF-R gene in glial differentiation. A nonoverlapping expression of the N-myc and EGF-R genes was found in neuronal-derived and glial-derived tumors, respectively. This suggests that the EGF-R gene may be involved in differentiation or its arrest in glia.\r"

Intermediate filament markers (cytokeratin, vimentin, neurofilament, and glial fibrillary acidic protein) and epithelial markers (epithelial membrane antigen and monoclonal antibody lu-5) demonstrated that colloid cyst epithelium has a unique antigenic profile in contrast to that of choroid plexus or glial tissue. Theories raised to explain the etiology of colloid cysts have included derivation from the embryonic paraphysis, detachments of developing neuroepithelium from the tela choroidea, and remnants of respiratory epithelium; a more recent theory suggests that these cysts are products of developing choroid plexus or ependyma. The present study shows that colloid cyst epithelium is distinct from that of choroid plexus or ependyma and therefore does not represent a product of their formation, nor does it represent a form of immature glia. This finding supports the conclusion that colloid cysts in any ventricular location represent a developmental anomaly of primitive neuroectoderm in the embryo, which remains unique from other products of neuroectodermal derivation.\r"

We reasoned that because diastolic properties of the anteroseptal myocardium should be different in the three groups of patients, regional filling in the anteroseptal area of the left ventricle should also be different, if regional filling does, indeed, reflect diastolic changes in the adjacent myocardium. While anteroseptal regional filling in the normal subjects was different than regional filling in the two patient groups, the degree of filling abnormality was similar in patients with and without myocardial infarctions. Our results suggest that regional left ventricular filling is not exclusively determined by diastolic changes in contiguous areas of myocardium.\r"

This attribute suggests that [18F]fluoromisonidazole may be useful for imaging hypoxic tissue using positron emission tomography. To examine this potential, we studied the pharmacokinetics and biodistribution of [3H]fluoromisonidazole in six open chest dogs. In two normal dogs, plasma and urine samples were collected over a 4-hr period following i.v. injection of the drug. In four animals, regional myocardial ischemia was produced 2 hr prior to drug injection by occlusion of the circumflex coronary artery and maintained during the 4-hr sampling period. In all animals, postmortem samples of myocardium and other organs were obtained and tissue, plasma, and urine tritium activity were determined by liquid scintillation counting. In areas of reduced flow, [3H]fluoromisonidazole accumulated in myocardium in inverse proportion to myocardial blood flow measured by microspheres, indicating enhanced binding in hypoxic tissues. Maximum tissue concentrations in ischemic myocardium were two- to three-fold greater than in normal myocardium and plasma. Plasma clearance data indicate the drug is rapidly distributed into the total-body water, clears from the body with a half-life of 275 +/- 50 min, and undergoes minimal metabolism by 4 hr. We conclude [18F]fluoromisonidazole may be a suitable agent for radionuclide imaging of hypoxic myocardium.\r"

Thus, succinimidyl para-tri-n-butylstannylbenzoate was radiolabeled in 60-90% radiochemical yield and subsequently conjugated to the antibody in 80-90% yield. Animal biodistribution studies were carried out with two separate anti-melanoma antibodies (9.2.27 and NR-M1-05) labeled by this method, and examined in nude mice bearing human melanoma tumor xenografts. Very large differences in the localization of radioactivity were observed in the thyroids and stomachs of mice when the iodobenzoyl-labeled antibodies were compared with the same antibodies labeled using the chloramine-T method of radioiodination. Few other significant differences in the tissue distribution of the radioiodinated antibodies were seen.\r"

The recent ability to isolate class or isotype switch monoclonal antibodies that have identical binding regions but different constant regions allows for such a comparison to be undertaken. Two isotype switch variant families of murine anti-idiotypic monoclonal antibodies were studied for radioiodination efficacy and immunoreactivity following labeling. In one of the families (S3H5), the IgG2a isotype switch variant derived from an IgG2b parent had nearly 70% greater iodine incorporation and over 50% greater immunoreactivity than the IgG2b parent. In the other family (S5A8), the IgG2a isotype switch variant had virtually identical efficacy of iodine incorporation and binding to antigen after labeling as did its IgG2b parent. Differences in relative heavy and light chain iodine incorporation were seen among isotype switch variants and their parents regardless of alterations in quantitative iodine incorporation or immunoreactivity. We conclude that in certain instances, cloning of an isotype switch variant antibody can result in an antibody offspring that has superior radiolabeling characteristics to its parent antibody. This isotype switching approach may find utility in converting highly-specific, but difficult to label antibodies, to more useful agents.\r"

We sought an attenuation compensation method that would require the acquisition of images from a single projection, thus allowing for continuous dynamic acquisition. We investigated the use of the left anterior oblique (LAO) projection and the peak-to-scatter ratio (P/S) method. Phantom studies indicated that the P/S was not only a function of the amount of overlying attenuating material but also a function of the activity in the small intestine. Two models for the P/S method were developed, one that considered the activity in the small intestine and one that did not. A series of 27 patients (21 for solid gastric emptying and six for liquid gastric emptying) were studied comparing the results using the geometric mean (GM) method with the two P/S methods, the LAO and the uncorrected anterior (ANT) projection. The uncorrected ANT view for solid gastric emptying underestimated the percent emptying at 60 min by approximately 7%. The P/S method did not adequately compensate for attenuation. The use of the LAO projection yielded results that were highly correlated and unbiased when compared to the GM method. Accurate estimates of liquid gastric emptying can be obtained without attenuation compensation.\r"

A case of acute myelofibrosis and severe focal bone pain is described showing bone scan and plain radiograph findings. A biopsy of one of the abnormal bony areas revealed malignant cells, necrosis and fibrosis, and abnormal, exuberant new bone formation, which may account for what is seen on the radiographic and radionuclide studies. The etiology and optimal management of this rare and often rapidly fatal disease remain to be defined.\r"

The cooperation of such people is of vital importance to the full understanding of the normal kinetics and metabolism of many new radiopharmaceuticals. The restrictions on the choice of normal volunteers, and the radiation dose limits which must be observed are not explicitly defined in any of the current guidelines, and in this paper we propose a rationale, based upon available information, which sets acceptable limits for volunteers, and provides a framework within which scientists and physicians can work.\r"

Plantar 201TI imaging followed standard treadmill exercise and planar SQ30217 imaging followed upright bicycle exercise, performed to angina, or the same double product achieved on the treadmill test. Upright anterior, 30 degrees left anterior oblique, and 60 degrees left anterior oblique images were obtained for 3, 6, and 9 min, respectively, starting 2 min after injection of 15 mCi of 99mTc SQ30217. A second 15-mCi dose was injected at rest approximately 2 hr later, and the same imaging protocol was followed. No adverse reactions or laboratory abnormalities attributable to SQ30217 were observed. All scans on the normal volunteers were interpreted as normal. Qualitative readings of both tests were equally sensitive for detecting patients with coronary disease (SQ30217 - 16/20, TI - 17/20, p = NS) and identifying abnormal vessels (SQ30217 - 19/45, TI - 21/45, p = NS). Both agents were falsely positive in 1/15 vessels. Ten vascular regions showed persistent abnormalities on resting SQ30217 scans; eight of these were distal to stenoses of at least 90% and three were also abnormal on thallium redistribution images. Hepatic uptake of SQ30217 obscured inferoapical segments in some views in 14/20 patients but did not interfere with abnormal vessel identification.\r"

B72.3 is an IgG1 that recognizes a mucin-like colon cancer associated antigen. Eight patients were infused with 3-5 mCi and 0.36-20 mg of 111In-labeled B72.3 prepared with a bifunctional chelate, isothiocyanatobenzyl-DTPA (SCN-Bz-DTPA). The biodistribution was compared with that of 13 patients previously studied as part of a separate trial, with 1-10 mCi and 0.16-1.35 mg of [131I]B72.3. The Beta T1/2 in serum was 63 +/- 5 hr for 111In-SCN-Bz-DTPA B72.3 and 52 +/- 10 hr for [131I]B72.3. Whole-body retention of the 111In (T1/2 = 11.8 days) was significantly longer than for [131I]B72.3 (T1/2 = 3.3 days), p less than 0.000001. The 131I was excreted primarily through the urine. Urinary excretion of 111In was low and gamma camera images confirmed that some 111In was excreted in the bowel. Tumor localization was seen in one of seven evaluable patients receiving 111In-SCN-Bz-DTPA B72.3. Gamma camera images showed that the liver concentrates 111In but not 131I. We conclude that 111In-SCN-Bz-DTPA B72.3 is metabolized in a different manner from the iodinated B72.3. The high concentration and prolonged retention of 111In by the liver interferes with tumor imaging of metastases.\r"

Pathologic confirmation was obtained in all 19 patients: 13 intraadrenal and six extraadrenal with metastases in five (Table 1). All three imaging modalities were in agreement in 11 of 14 completed examinations (79%). MIBG and CT agreed in 16 of the 19 patients in whom both were performed (84%). MIBG/MR and CT/MR results were concordant in 12 of 14 (86%) and 13 of 14 (93%) jointly completed examinations, respectively. There was one false-negative (FN) MIBG scan, two FN CT scans, and one FN MR scan. MIBG, CT, and MRI are complementary procedures with MIBG providing more specific functional information and the latter two superior anatomic detail. MIBG scintigraphy is recommended as the initial localizing study of choice (especially for the detection of extraadrenal disease and postoperative recurrence), as a guide for CT and/or MR and specific functional confirmation of their findings. Although MRI is capable of imaging in multiple planes (without exposure to ionizing radiation or the need for i.v. contrast material) with superior contrast compared to CT, it is expensive and has poor patient cooperation. However, it may be capable of differentiating pheochromocytomas from other adrenal masses on the basis of signal characterization.\r"

We hypothesized that it might therefore accumulate also in ischemic, but non-necrotic myocardium potentially salvageable by interventional therapy. To evaluate the myocardial kinetics of [18F]fluoromisonidazole (FM), 20 isolated perfused rabbit hearts were used to characterize the uptake and binding of tracer under control conditions (n = 6), or with ischemia (flow 10% of control, n = 5), hypoxia without low flow (control flow rates with hypoxic medium, n = 5), or with reperfusion (n = 4). Myocardial retention of tracer detected externally with gamma scintillation probes after 20 min of constant [18F]FM infusion followed by 20 min of washout with nonradioactive buffer was 41 +/- 7% and 46 +/- 8% of peak activity in hearts subjected to ischemia or hypoxia, respectively, and significantly higher than in hearts subjected to either control perfusion or to ischemia followed by reperfusion (18 +/- 6 and 16 +/- 5% of peak activity, respectively, p less than 0.01). The biologic half-time of retained tracer was 40 hr in all hearts indicating essentially irreversible binding. Based on these findings, we measured uptake of [18F]FM using positron emission tomography in five dogs subjected to acute coronary occlusion. Five to thirteen millicuries of tracer were injected within 3 hr of occlusion. Within 30 min after administration of tracer, 18F accumulation in ischemic myocardium was greater than that observed in normal myocardium. The results indicate that [18F]FM accumulates in ischemic myocardium in relation to diminished tissue oxygen content and not simply because of diminished flow. Thus, this class of compounds may be potentially useful to help identify hypoxic myocardium.\r"

There were no significant differences (p greater than 0.1) in the biodistributions of the two labels at 1, 2, 5, and 7 days postinjection. These results are contrasted with prior studies showing elevated levels of 111In in liver, spleen, and kidneys using B72.3-DTPA conjugates prepared via the bicyclic anhydride.

As early as 3 hr postinjection, [111In]IgG showed greater accumulation at the lesion than [99mTc]HSA (p less than 0.01). Both [125I]IgG and [111In]IgG showed greater accumulation than [67Ga]citrate (p less than 0.01). At 24 hr, IgG image definition increased, while HSA image definition decreased, and the intensity of accumulation of both IgG preparations was greater than that of [67Ga]citrate or [99mTc]HSA (p less than 0.01). At all imaging times, [67Ga]citrate accumulation was surprisingly low. In inflammation produced by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Candida albicans, or turpentine, [111In]IgG accumulation was similar to the results obtained with Escherichia coli.

In vitro incubation of melanoma cells with a combination of the three 125I-labeled anti-HMW-MAA MoAbs results in a marked additive binding only when the MoAbs are used at saturating concentrations. Injection of the combination of the three 125I-labeled MoAbs (up to 300 micrograms per mouse) into human melanoma-bearing nude mice does not increase the amount of radioactivity specifically localized in melanoma lesions above the level observed upon injection of corresponding doses of individual MoAbs. These results may reflect the low concentration of MoAbs which reaches tumor lesions in vivo. Therefore, administration of combinations of MoAbs to distinct determinants of HMW-MAA may not increase the sensitivity of immunoscintigraphy to visualize lesions in patients with melanoma.\r"

In order to compare 191mIr FPNA to current methods used to define cardiac function, 20 patients referred for cardiac catheterization were studied. Count rate data, right ventricular (RV), and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), LV and diastolic volume (EDV), and end diastolic long axis (AXIS) were evaluated. Count rate data using 191mIr FPNA was consistently better than similar data obtained by 99mTc FPNA. There were acceptable correlations between 191mIr and 99mTc FPNA RVEF (r = 0.848), 191mIr FPNA and contrast angiography LVEF (r = 0.944), LVEDV (r = 0.917), and LV AXIS (r = 0.866). The data thus suggests that 191mIr FPNA has great potential in the evaluation of cardiac function.\r"

The ranges of uptake of [125I]MIBG, expressed as percent of the injected dose per gram of tissue, were as follows: for neuroblastoma 0.0013-0.071, for ganglioneuroma 0.0017-0.0028, and for non-neoplastic control tissues 0.0002-0.011. The quantitative uptake of [125I]MIBG by neuroblastoma varied between different patients and between different parts of individual tumors.

  ".W": "Iodine-131 metaiodobenzylguanidine [131I]MIBG has proven to be an effective radiopharmaceutical for the scintigraphic localization of pheochromocytomas. Uptake of MIBG is inhibited by blockade of the neuronal uptake pathway for catecholamines (\"uptake-1\") and by depletion of catecholamine storage vesicle contents, but is not significantly affected by conventional alpha- and beta-adrenoreceptor blocking drugs. Labetalol is an antihypertensive agent with combined alpha- and beta-blocking properties that has been used to manage patients with suspected pheochromocytomas. We report eight patients in whom concurrent or recent therapy with labetalol significantly reduced the uptake of [131I]MIBG into salivary glands, liver, spleen, and general body background. Tumor uptake of MIBG was also reduced in two of the three patients who were proven to have pheochromocytomas. In one case, the effect of labetalol persisted for 36 hr after the drug had been discontinued. The inhibitory effect of labetalol on MIBG uptake in sympathomedullary tissues is likely to be a result of the drug's little-known, additional properties of uptake-1 blockade and depletion of storage vesicle contents, rather than its alpha- or beta-blocking effects. Additionally, labetalol would also appear to hasten clearance of MIBG from other tissues. Labetalol therapy should be discontinued for several days (possibly up to 1 wk) before undertaking [131I]MIBG scintigraphy. A comprehensive list of drugs that should be avoided in patients undergoing MIBG scintigraphy is appended.\r"

The second is prepared by directly labeling sucralfate with [99mTc]pertechnetate in the presence of stannous ion. An in vitro study of the factors affecting the production and stability of these labeled sucralfate preparations was conducted. Both formulations were stable at the acidic pH likely encountered in the stomach. However, at pH greater than 6 the albumin-sucralfate complex began to dissociate while directly labeled sucralfate was stable to a pH of 9. Conversely it was shown that directly labeled sucralfate was more susceptible to loss of 99mTc to other chelating species. Sucralfate complexed with [99mTc]HSA was radiochemically stable up to a specific activity of 26 GBq (700 mCi) per gram while directly labeled sucralfate showed decreased 24-hr stability at specific activities greater than 837 mCi (31 GBq) per gram.\r"

The tumor-to-blood ratio increased from 2.8 to 21.4 and the percentage of the whole-body retention recovered in the tumor from 47% to 80% during the same time interval. The therapeutic efficiency of two injections of 7.4 MBq 131I-BW 495/36 was evaluated by comparing the tumor size with that in mice injected with either the same amount of the unlabeled MoAb, the same radioactivity of an 131I-labeled nonspecific MoAb, or with saline only. The high tumor accumulation of 131I-BW 495/36 led to a total tumor dose of 77 Gy resulting in a mean reduction in tumor diameter of 50%, corresponding to a reduction in tumor volume of 88% within 42 days p.i. Unlabeled MoAb had no effect on tumor growth compared with controls, whereas 131I nonspecific antibody caused a slight inhibition of tumor growth. Histologic tumor sections showed large areas of necrosis and a pronounced vacuolation of the tumor cell cytoplasm between Days 7 and 30 p.i. By Day 42 all remaining tissue in the tumor was identified as mouse connective tissue.\r"

Iridium-191m is eluted from the generator by pH 1 saline. For clinical use the eluate is buffered by succinate solution before injection. This new system is characterized by high performance (approximately 25% 191mIr recovery with 5 X 10(-4)% 191Os breakthrough) and long shelf-life (3 wk). The buffered eluate is sterile, pyrogen-free, and nontoxic, and contains no 192Ir. It is suitable for first-pass radionuclide angiocardiography with a very low radiation dose to the patient.\r"

  ".U": "89293301\r", 
  ".W": "A phantom was devised to validate scintigraphically determined left ventricular ejection fractions (LVEFs) and cardiac chamber volumes in the following simulated cardiac situations: normal contraction, moderately impaired left ventricular contraction, severely impaired left ventricular contraction, mitral regurgitation, and cardiomyopathy. The phantom, assembled from anatomically realistic cardiac chambers, simulated contraction and expansion using individual chamber pumps coordinated by a microcomputer. Scintigraphic studies were performed by sequential imaging of [99mTc]pertechnetate introduced into each chamber. The images were analyzed like conventional clinical studies, using both automatic and manual techniques. Scintigraphic techniques correlated with chamber volumes that were determined by weight to yield the following regression formulae: LVEF (by automatic method 1) = 1.08 x LVEF (by weight) -5.11; LVEF (by automatic method 2) = 1.00 x LVEF (by weight) -3.15; and LVEF (by manual method) = 1.04 x LVEF (by weight) -5.08 ml (Correlation coefficients greater than 0.98). The absolute left ventricular volumes (LVVs), determined by scintigraphy, correlated well with LVVs determined by weight. These correlations were performed with separations between the center of the left ventricle and the collimator varying from 5 cm to 9 cm. The regression formulae for 5, 7, and 9 cm distances were: LVV (by counts) = 0.99 x LVV (by weight) + 0.13, LVV (by counts) = 1.04 x LVV (by weight) + 9.08, LVV (by counts) = 0.88 x LVV (by weight) + 15.25, respectively. At 9 cm, slight volumetric underestimation occurred, as predicted from the work of Fearnow et al., possibly because of oversubtraction of background. Thus, this phantom provides a useful tool for validating scintigraphic cardiac blood-pool studies simulating a wide range of clinically relevant situations.\r"

We have recently been treating nonresectable hepatic neoplasms with transcatheter hepatic arterial chemoembolization (HAE) followed by HAI. The MAA perfusion studies in these patients show variable patterns. For this reason, we have reviewed our recent experience with 15 patients who underwent 21 HAEs and HAIs. The arteriograms and the MAA perfusion studies were reviewed and correlated. Early (within 4 hr of embolization) perfusion studies revealed flow reversal, or MAA reflux into an undesirable location in 11 cases. Two selected follow-up scans in 24 hr revealed restoration of flow to the embolized lobe, confirming the proper position of the catheter for HAI. Knowledge of both the hepatic arterial anatomy, and of the specific embolization procedure will allow accurate interpretation of the MAA perfusion study. Initial flow reversal, or MAA reflux, should not be interpretated as a malpositioned catheter, but prompt reevaluation after a period of 24 hr to document restoration of antegrade flow is suggested.\r"

Left ventricular (LV) first-pass studies were performed in 72 patients with 191mIr from a new bedside 1.3 Ci (48.1 GBq) 191Os/191mIr generator system using an activated carbon support that offers high 191mIr yields (15-18%) and consistent low 191Os breakthrough (2-4 x 10(-4)%/bolus). Using a single crystal digital gamma camera, uncorrected end-diastolic counts in the left ventricular representative cycle ranged from 10 up to 30 k counts. The reproducibility of repeated LV ejection fraction (LVEF) determination at 2-min intervals in 50 patients was r = 0.97, mean diff. = 2.08 +/- 1.55 EF units. Comparison between 191mIr (80-120 mCi; 2,960-4,400 MBq) and 99mTc (20-25 mCi; 750-925 MBq) LV count rates indicates a 3 wk useful shelf life of this new generator system for cardiac studies. Iridium-191m determined LVEF correlated closely with 99mTc determined LVEF in 32 patients (r = 0.96, mean diff. = 1.87 +/- 1.23 EF units). Parametric images for LV wall motion analysis were comparable with both isotopes. We conclude that rapid, repeat, and reproducible high count rate first-pass left ventricular studies can be obtained with 191mIr from this new 191Os/191mIr generator system using a single crystal digital gamma camera.\r"

More than 90% of the [90Y]Ca oxalate particles were in the optimal size range of 1-10 microns, and the unbound activity in serum and synovial fluid was 3.7% to 5.0%. Following injection in rabbit knees, leakage of [90Y]Ca oxalate was 5 +/- 2%, with localization primarily in the bone and virtually no uptake by the lymph nodes or liver. Yttrium-90 FHMA particles were larger (95% greater than 10 microns), and at least on a microscopic level, appeared to distribute homogeneously over the articular surface. Leakage of [90Y]FHMA was initially less but eventually slightly exceeded that of [90Y]Ca oxalate. Nevertheless, both radiopharmaceuticals can provide a satisfactory therapeutic dose to the knee with less than half the leakage and a marked reduction in absorbed dose to nontarget tissues compared to previously tested agents. Ease of preparation, physical characteristics of the 90Y beta ray, and apparent lack of substantial leakage from the joint make these agents extremely attractive for clinical evaluation in rheumatoid arthritis patients who are unresponsive to medical therapy.\r"

The (R,S)-diastereomer is only threefold lower in affinity than the (R,R)-isomer, but the kinetic properties are considerably different--the dissociation rate constant is 13-fold faster for the (R,S)-isomer and the association rate constant is two to threefold faster. The calculated affinity is therefore only fourfold lower. In vivo, the clearance of (R,S)-4IQNB from receptor-rich tissue is also more rapid than that of the (R,R)-isomer, that is a reflection of the more rapid in vitro kinetic properties since the physicochemical properties and the metabolic clearance of the diastereomers is the same.\r"

In addition, several animals received 125I-low density lipoproteins [125I-LDL], or 125I human serum albumin [125I-HSA] as positive and negative controls. Forty-eight hours after injection of the radiolabeled proteins, the aortas were removed, divided into abdominal and thoracic regions, counted, and autoradiographed. The images acquired after injection of 111In-IgG and 111In-Fc, showed clear focal accumulation of radioactivity in the healing abdominal aorta. In contrast, the images obtained after injection of 111In-Fab did not show focal radionuclide accumulation. For 111In-IgG and 111In-Fc there were three to six times as many counts in the abdominal as in the thoracic aorta, while for 111In-Fab and 125I HSA, the abdominal and thoracic counts were nearly equal. The results suggest that radiolabeled IgG and Fc can be used to image experimental atherosclerosis.\r"

In order to determine the effect of caloric content on GE, 12 normal male volunteers, ranging in age from 19-28 yr (mean = 24 yr), had GE scans (n = 32) performed with a solid meal of fixed composition (carbohydrate 40%:protein 40%:fat 20%) but varying energy content [150 kcal (n = 9), 300 kcal (n = 14), and 600 kcal (n = 9)]. Increasing the energy content of the meal of fixed composition progressively delayed gastric emptying: T1/2 = 57', 70', and 95' for 150 kcal, 300 kcal and 600 kcal, respectively (p less than 0.05; Student's t-test). Reproducibility, evaluated by performing GE scans (n = 8) on different days in the same individual (n = 4) with the same meal (300 kcal), was good (r greater than or equal to 0.89). Variability varied inversely with meal energy content (CV:150 kcal greater than or equal to 300 kcal and 600 kcal). The 300 kcal mean seems to be the best compromise since it results in less intersubject variability than 150 kcal, has minimal intrasubject variability, but is not as prohibitively large as the 600 kcal meal.\r"

BMC at all four sites was significantly related to spine fracture incidence. Women at -1 s.d. for calcaneal BMC had a sevenfold greater probability of spine fracture than women at +1 s.d.; women at -2 s.d. had a 50-fold greater probability than women at +2 s.d., even after adjustment for the effects of age. Combinations of BMC at two sites further strengthened the relationship to spine fracture; the best two-site combination is calcaneus and distal radius BMC. Thus women can be categorized and stratified according to future fracture risk, and the selection of postmenopausal women for preventive treatments can be guided by measurements of BMC.\r"

Cholangiographically, dilated caliber of the CBD more than or equal to 12 mm was found in five and equivocal caliber of 8 to 11 mm was in the remaining seven. Apparent stenosis of the CBD was found in four with dilated CBD. There were two patients who had CBD stone with equivocal caliber of the CBD. The reflux sign seems to be a sensitive finding indicating the presence of biliary dysfunction, and would be helpful for the detection of incomplete obstruction of the CBD or CBD stone, especially in a patient with equivocal caliber of the CBD.\r"

Radioactivity remaining in the heart was monitored with external scintillation probes. A compartmental model which included nonesterified tracer, catabolite, and complex lipid compartments successfully fitted tissue time-radioactivity residue curves, and gave a value for the rate of IPPA oxidation 1.8 times that obtained from steady-state release of tritiated water from labeled palmitic acid. The technique was sensitive to the impairment of LCFA oxidation in hearts of animals treated with the carnitine palmitoyltransferase I inhibitor, 2[5(4-chlorophenyl)pentyl]oxirane-2-carboxylate (POCA). IPPA or similar modified fatty acids may be better than 11C-labeled physiological fatty acids such as palmitate in this type of study, because efflux of unoxidized tracer and catabolite(s) from the heart are kinetically more distinct, and their contributions to the early data can be reliably separated.

Chromatography of human urine and studies in rats showed that the complex was excreted unaltered into the urine. Renal extraction of [99mTc]DMSA in a human volunteer was 5.8%. Continuous infusion of [99mTc]DMSA in 13 individuals with normal renal function gave the following results (mean +/- s.d.): plasma clearance of [99mTc]DMSA 34 +/- 4 ml/min, urinary clearance of [99mTc]DMSA 12 +/- 3 ml/min. The calculated filtered load of [99mTc]DMSA closely resembled the urinary clearance, whereas the plasma clearance was about three times faster.

The nude rat is larger, less sensitive, and lives longer than the nude mouse. It is, therefore, well suited for in vivo studies of tumor localization with radiolabeled monoclonal antibodies. The tumor-to-host weight ratio was closer to the human situation for the nude rat than for the mouse, and quantitative imaging could be performed with a parallel hole collimator. We followed the antibody biokinetics for as long as 8 days, with repeated blood sampling and imaging. Specific uptake of MAb was higher in tumor tissue than in all other tissues except blood. Initial high uptake was also recorded in the bone marrow. The lymph glands showed a slow uptake of specific and control antibody. A simple in vitro correction procedure is described to calculate the corrected specific tissue uptake (STUcorr) that takes the blood activity into account. Thus it was shown that 80% of the tissue uptake in the dissected liver at 30 hr was due to labeled antibodies circulating in the blood. The specific tissue uptake ratio of antibodies 96.5 and OKT3 (nonspecific control) was unity for all other organs except for tumor tissue, where the ratio was greater than two and even higher when correction for blood content of labeled antibody was made.\r"

It is the first In3+-complex with relevance to antibody attachment to be structurally characterized. Surprisingly, the complex has coordination number eight and is the first monomeric In3+-complex with such a high coordination number. The potentially octadentate ligand binds through three amino groups and five deprotonated carboxylate groups to the metal ion. The ligand atoms surround the central indium atom in a slightly distorted Archimedian antiprismatic configuration. High resolution nuclear magnetic resonance studies in solution show that this high coordination number also pertains in aqueous medium. Consequently, one may conclude that octadentate ligands are optimal for the thermodynamic and kinetic stabilization of In3+ in living systems. It is also indicated that bifunctional diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA) is superior to amide bound (= sevendentate) DTPA in antibody labeling.\r"

All complexes were characterized by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) on a C18 column using gradient elution with a tetrabutylammonium phosphate buffer (40-85% methanol). By performing HPLC of mixtures of the 99mTc complexes with structurally characterized 99Tc complexes of the ligands, it has been shown that at the no carrier added (NCA) level, 99mTcNCl4- labeling leads to the production of [99mTcN(dto)2]2- and [99mTcN(mnt)2]2-. Dithionite reduction and ligand exchange of 99mTc(Sn)-gluconate lead to the production of [99mTc(mnt)3]2- and not of [99mTcO(mnt)2]- which would be the expected product from the results of studies with 99Tc. The product formed by dithionite reduction in the presence of dto was not identified, but it was clearly not [TcO(dto)2]-, the product expected from 99Tc studies. Studies in mice showed that the biologic behavior of the 99mTc complexes is altered by the presence of the Tc-nitrido group. HPLC results indicate that caution must be taken when extrapolating results obtained using carrier quantities of Tc to the carrier free situation.\r"

Technetium-99m labeling for kits stored at -15 degrees C for up to 3 mo was greater than 95% as determined by instant thin layer chromatography while colloid particles of 1-3 microns were measured by electron microscope for these preparations. Canine leukocyte preparations labeled with [99mTc]SFC and characterized by triple density gradients of metrizamide in plasma demonstrated an 83% leukocyte association. Analysis of labeled cell preparation for up to 3 hr demonstrated label stability. Labeled leukocytes, when readministered in normal dogs, demonstrated bi-exponential blood clearance with uptake and subsequent clearance from lung. There was increasing uptake of labeled leukocytes by the liver until steady state was achieved. Furthermore, when whole blood samples were analyzed by the triple density gradient method, an increasing monocyte-to-granulocyte ratio was observed to occur with time. By 3 hr 95% of the whole blood activity was associated with the leukocyte fraction. Dogs in which a 24-hr sterile abscess was created demonstrated elevated blood-pool activity as compared to control with localization of the labeled cells at inflammatory sites within 3 hr following cell readministration.\r"

There were no significant differences between the groups in birth weight (mean +/- SD: 1010 +/- 240 vs 1030 +/- 230 gm), gestational age (29.1 +/- 2.0 vs 28.9 +/- 2.1 weeks), initial ventilatory support (mean airway pressure 7.2 +/- 1.8 vs 8.1 +/- 2.1 cm H2O; FiO2 0.62 +/- 0.24 vs 0.75 +/- 0.22), duration of mechanical ventilation (median (range): 6 (1 to 61) vs 10 (1 to 50) days) and duration of oxygen therapy (13 (1 to 109) vs 27 (4 to 227) days) for the intermittent mandatory ventilation group and the high-frequency oscillatory ventilation group, respectively. At the time of testing, weight was 1830 +/- 340 vs 1830 +/- 290 gm, and age was 68 +/- 24 vs 70 +/- 31 days. Respiratory flows were determined by pneumotachygraphy, esophageal pressure through a water-filled feeding tube, and functional residual capacity by N2 washout. Both groups had abnormal lung function with decreased lung compliance (1.65 +/- 0.51 vs 1.54 +/- 0.36 ml/cm H2O) and elevated pulmonary resistance (102 +/- 24 vs 107 +/- 36 cm H2O/L/sec). Functional residual capacity was in the normal range (30.6 +/- 6.0 vs 28.2 +/- 10.7 ml) in both groups. There were no significant differences in lung function between the two treatment groups. These results do not support the hypothesis that high-frequency oscillatory ventilation reduces the risk of lung damage in preterm infants.\r"

A total of 193 samples were studied. Mean serum penicillin levels remained greater than or equal to 0.02 micrograms/ml for 21 days, but by 28 days only 44% of the serum samples had detectable levels of penicillin and only 36% had levels greater than or equal to 0.02 micrograms/ml. Patients weighing more than 45 kg had significantly lower serum penicillin levels than did those who weighed less. There were similar correlations with body surface area and with age. These data indicate that a significant percentage of patients receiving benzathine penicillin G prophylaxis for prevention of recurrent attacks of rheumatic fever are not protected during the fourth week. More frequent administration of benzathine penicillin G should be considered in instances of high risk of recurrence of rheumatic fever.\r"

Six to twelve grams of deferoxamine was infused daily for 12 hours over 12 to 25 months through externalized central venous catheters or implanted reservoirs. Serum ferritin levels decreased by 56% to 99%. Liver iron concentrations, measured by magnetic susceptibility in two patients, were 1234 and 2438 micrograms/gm wet weight (22.1 and 43.6 mumol/gm wet weight) after treatment for 17 and 25 months, respectively. A patient with congestive heart failure and a patient with severe ventricular dysrhythmias no longer required cardiac medication after 12 to 24 months of chelation therapy. Three episodes of bacteremia and three episodes of cellulitis accounted for a catheter-related infection rate of 0.14 per 100 patient-days. The catheter removal rate was 0.20 per 100 patient-days. No patient experienced serious visual, auditory, or other toxicities. We conclude that in some patients receiving regular erythrocyte transfusions, high-dose intravenous chelation therapy with deferoxamine is superior to conventional subcutaneous treatment.\r"

In 20 patients undergoing a third rechallenge, no food hypersensitivity was lost. Loss rate of food hypersensitivity varied among foods; after 1 year, there was a 26% loss of symptomatic food allergy to five major allergens (egg, milk, soy, wheat, and peanut) compared with a 66% loss rate to other food allergens. Loss of symptomatic allergy was not affected by the patient's age at diagnosis, except with milk allergy, for which older patients were more likely to lose clinical food hypersensitivity (p less than 0.05). Total serum IgE and prick skin tests were not useful for predicting loss of symptomatic food hypersensitivity. There was no significant decrease in skin test wheal size corresponding to loss of clinical food hypersensitivity. Patients developing only skin symptoms during the initial challenge were most likely to lose symptomatic food hypersensitivity.\r"

The incidence of influenza infection was higher in children with cancer (23/73, 32%) than in control subjects (10/70, 14%, p = 0.02). A preseason hemagglutination inhibition titer greater than or equal to 1:32, generally used as a marker of successful immunization in vaccine trials, was protective for all children in the control groups, but did not prevent influenza infection in 24% of the patients with cancer. Infection rates of patients and community controls with titers greater than or equal to 1:32 differed significantly (p = 0.006). No significant differences were noted in duration of reported symptoms between groups, and clinical complications occurred too infrequently to analyze. However, 2 (11%) of 18 of the cancer patients with positive culture results were hospitalized during the illness and one patient developed a nosocomial infection. None of the control children was hospitalized. These findings suggest the need for further study of the immunologic response of immunosuppressed children to influenza infection and a clinical efficacy trial of the influenza vaccine in these patients.\r"

Some previously identified risk factors present in our patients included high-dose corticosteroid therapy (five patients), other immunosuppressive therapy (four), and chronic lung (five) or kidney (three) disease. Symptoms and signs included rapid onset, fever, cough, pleuritic chest pain, dyspnea, abdominal pain, diarrhea, and headache. Rhinitis, myalgia, and neurologic abnormalities were not noted. Chest roentgenograms revealed single-lobe consolidation in three patients, diffuse bilateral alveolar infiltrates in three, and pleural effusion in three. All patients were treated with erythromycin; three patients also received rifampin. Tracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation were required by four patients. Six patients improved after therapy. One child died of persistent lung disease 1 month after the onset of legionnaires disease. L. pneumophila was isolated from potable water in the hospital. Aerosol equipment cleansed with tap water and the showers were implicated as means of exposure by patients to contaminated potable water. No new nosocomial cases were seen after immunocompromised children were prohibited from taking showers, and sterile water was used to cleanse equipment for administering aerosol medications.\r"

  ".W": "To evaluate the reproducibility of overnight growth hormone (GH) testing and the effect of daytime administration of levodopa and clonidine on overnight GH secretion, we examined consecutive 12-hour overnight GH profiles of 48 short subjects, ages 5 to 16 years, who had GH stimulation testing with levodopa and clonidine. In six subjects (12%) the overnight pool GH concentration on the second night increased by greater than 100% from the first-night result (night-to-night changes of +1.2 to +5.2 ng/ml). In the remaining subjects, night-to-night changes in pool GH concentrations ranged from -1.2 to +1.8 ng/ml (-60% to +88% changes from the first night value). Night-to-night changes were less than 25% of the first-night value in 17 subjects (35%), 25% to 50% in 18 subjects (38%), and 50% to 100% in 7 subjects (15%). Night-to-night changes in pool GH concentrations correlated with differences in peak nighttime GH concentrations but not with differences in duration of observed sleep. There was no discernible effect of daytime levodopa-clonidine administration on overnight pool GH concentrations. These results demonstrate the potential for night-to-night variation in overnight GH profiles and suggest the need for some means of confirming that overnight GH testing reflects normal physiologic GH secretion. Without such confirmation, the results from a single overnight GH profile should be interpreted with caution.\r"

  ".W": "Because current concepts of growth hormone (GH) testing and GH treatment have become controversial, we investigated the GH secretory patterns in children with normal and short stature. Twenty-four-hour serum GH levels were evaluated in three groups of children. Group 1 was composed of children with normal height (mean height = 0.02 SD, n = 33); group 2 was composed of short children (less than 5th percentile, n = 63) with normal results on provocative GH testing; and group 3 was composed of short children (less than 5th percentile, n = 7) with subnormal results on provocative GH testing. Mean +/- SD (range) GH levels during 24-hour studies of GH secretion were 1.6 +/- 1.1 (0.5 to 5.6), 1.8 +/- 1.2 (0.6 to 6.3), and 0.9 +/- 0.4 (0.5 to 1.7) ng/ml in groups 1, 2, and 3, respectively. No statistical difference existed in mean GH levels between groups 1 and 2 or between groups 1 and 3. The mean GH concentration from 24-hour studies in group 2 children did not correlate with chronologic age, height standard deviation, growth rates, or insulin-like growth factor 1 levels. The linear growth rate of 26 of 28 children in group 2 who received GH therapy for 6 months improved by 2 cm/yr or more; the mean +/- SD growth rate was 4.0 +/- 1.3 and 8.8 +/- 2.0 cm/yr during control and treatment periods, respectively, for these 28 children. Mean GH levels from testing did not predict response to GH during 6 months of therapy. Children with slower growth rates responded better to GH therapy (p less than 0.05). We conclude that (1) in 24-hour studies, GH levels in normal children overlapped with those of short children, including those with classic GH deficiency, (2) in 24-hour studies, GH levels did not predict responses of linear growth to short-term GH treatment, nor did they correlate with children's heights or growth velocities, and (3) the majority of short children in group 2 treated with GH for 6 months had an increase in linear growth velocity, the mean +/- SD change being 4.8 +/- 2.0 cm/yr.\r"

  ".W": "We tested the hypothesis that growth hormone (GH) mediates the rise in insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) concentrations in children with precocious puberty. We studied three groups of patients. Group 1 included six children with GH deficiency and precocious puberty (precocious GH-deficient); group 2 included 10 GH-sufficient patients with idiopathic true precocious puberty (precocious GH-sufficient); and group 3 included 9 prepubertal children with GH deficiency (prepubertal GH-deficient). Growth rates, pubertal status, and plasma IGF-I concentrations were determined at regular intervals. The precocious children with GH deficiency had a mean (+/- SD) growth rate of 7.2 +/- 2.1 significantly below that of the precocious GH-sufficient patients (10.5 +/- 2.5 cm/yr, p less than 0.05) but above that of the prepubertal GH-deficient children (3.9 +/- 1.4 cm/yr, p less than 0.05). The mean IGF-I concentration in the precocious GH-deficient children was 0.77 +/- 0.39 U/ml, significantly lower than the mean level of 2.2 +/- 0.67 U/ml in the precocious GH-sufficient patients (p less than 0.01). However, precocious GH-deficient patients had significantly higher IGF-I values than the prepubertal GH-deficient children (0.24 +/- 0.10 U/ml, p less than 0.05). IGF-I values did not rise with the onset of precocious puberty in four of the precocious GH-deficient children evaluated before and after the development of precocious puberty. However, three patients who began GH treatment did have a rise in plasma IGF-I concentrations to levels of 1.2, 3.4, and 3.7 U/ml, respectively. These findings are compatible with the concept that sex steroids increase IGF-I levels in precocious puberty primarily by increasing GH production. A small but direct effect of sex steroids on IGF-I production may also exist. The onset of precocious puberty in children with organic GH deficiency may mask the abnormal growth pattern of these children and delay diagnosis; determinations of plasma IGF-I concentrations may be helpful in assessing the GH status of these patients.\r"

A muscle biopsy specimen taken from the younger, more severely affected brother showed abnormal mitochondrial morphology. Activities of the following enzymes in cultured fibroblasts from both boys were normal: pyruvate dehydrogenase, pyruvate carboxylase, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, cytochrome oxidase, reduced nicotinamide-adenine dinucleotide-cytochrome c reductase, and succinate cytochrome c reductase. Fibroblast mitochondria from the younger boy showed undetectable (less than 1% of control values) adenosine triphosphate synthesis with pyruvate and malate, whereas adenosine triphosphate synthesis with succinate was 70% of control values. These data indicate probably deficient activity of complex I of the electron transport chain. The boys' mother has progressive neurosensory hearing loss; their sister is clinically normal. Both mother and sister have many of the biochemical abnormalities found in the boys. It is possible, but not proved, that this disorder is inherited through maternal mitochondria.\r"

The 32 independent variables included measures of medical risk, technologic sophistication, demographic characteristics and economic incentives. The incidences of medical risk factors, nonwhite race and ratio of obstetricians to fertile women were associated positively with hospital-specific cesarean delivery rates. Participation in health maintenance organizations and numbers of deliveries were correlated negatively with those rates. Hospital-specific cesarean delivery rates were not associated with technologic sophistication, malpractice premiums or reimbursement differences between routes of delivery. Pay source stratified models explained 45-63% of the variation in the hospital-specific cesarean rates. Sensitivity analysis revealed that even a 50% change in the incidence of any independent variable would change the cesarean delivery rate by less than 2%.\r"

Cells were cultured for 4 days, with 32 microM of DCHA added on days 1 and 3. Incorporation of DCHA into the cellular phospholipids was demonstrated by fatty acid analysis. Supplementation with DCHA led to almost a threefold decrease of resistance in GLC4-CP and had no influence on CP cytotoxicity in GLC4. After culturing with DCHA, cellular platinum (Pt); total Pt bound to DNA; and Pt-GG, Pt-AG, G-Pt-G, and Pt-GMP adduct contents increased in both lines, whereas interstrand cross-link formation was elevated only in GLC4-CP. These experiments demonstrate that DCHA reduces CP resistance. Although an effect on cellular membranes resulting in an increased CP uptake apparently was present, this mechanism does not seem to be responsible for resistance modulation. Rather, an effect on nuclear, probably DNA-related, structures is likely and leads to an increased formation of interstrand cross-links in GLC4-CP.\r"

The ER from MTW9-MtT tumor, which is resistant to ovariectomy, presented only one peak, focusing at pH 6.0 (peak B). The peaks presented similar sedimentation coefficients (3.5s) with peak B being slightly larger than peak A. Regardless of the tumor sensitivity to hormonal manipulation, the two peaks presented similar molecular weights as shown by immunostaining of Western blots: a major duplex component of 70 kilodaltons (kd), and single bands at 48, 36, and 35 kd. The bands under 70 kd could be proteolytic products; however, the pattern could not be changed by addition of molybdate, leupeptin, or phenylmethylsulfonylfluoride. The pattern was reproducible in experiments done at different intervals of time or when rechromatofocusing. The peaks presented different isoelectric points: peak A, pH 6.8; peak B, pH 6.0. Also, they had different DNA binding abilities: peak A bound quantitatively to DNA, while peak B bound only 20%. Peak A was always present in tumors responsive to ovariectomy, a fact that suggests this ER component could be a marker for the responsiveness to hormonal therapy.\r"

To evaluate the significance of this genetic change, we looked for the loss of 3p alleles in hereditary renal cell carcinomas and other tumors from patients with von Hippel-Lindau disease. Specific loss of alleles from chromosome 3p was detected with polymorphic DNA markers in 11 renal cell carcinomas, one pheochromocytoma, two spinal hemangioblastomas and one cerebellar hemangioblastoma from von Hippel-Lindau patients. Multiple renal cell carcinomas in individuals with von Hippel-Lindau disease showed loss of the same chromosome 3p alleles, which demonstrated that the same chromosome was deleted in each tumor. Analysis of haplotypes indicated that the loss of chromosome 3p alleles was from the chromosome bearing the balancing, wild-type allele of the VHL gene. These results are consistent with the concept that the VHL gene is a recessive oncogene. Renal cell carcinoma, pheochromocytoma, and spinal and cerebellar hemangioblastomas develop in predisposed family members when somatic mutational events lead to loss of chromosome 3p sequences bearing the wild-type allele of the VHL gene.\r"

Rural preventable deaths occurred mainly before arrival at hospital, but 55% of urban preventable deaths occurred in hospitals. The causes of death in children with survivable injury suggest that the institution of prehospital resuscitation and improvement in trauma care education for physicians might reduce mortality. The high incidence of unsurvivable injury suggests that injury prevention will be more cost effective in the long term.\r"

It consists of two pages and the clinician need only circle listed choices, write focused comments, or draw on provided diagrams. It obviates the narrative record of the history and physical examination. We reviewed the written records of 100 consecutive polytraumatized patients seen in the Trauma Room before institution of the form, transcribing their information onto the form. These were compared to a second series of 100 consecutive patients who were evaluated following the introduction of the neurotrauma form as the initial assessment record. Seventy-seven of these patients were evaluated by the Neurosurgical service. Overall, the quality and completeness of recording improved dramatically. The neurotrauma assessment record ensures more complete recording of information during initial patient assessment, allows easy transfer to computerized databases, and may assist academic centres in performing clinical research.\r"

Twelve lesions (Group I) were penetrating and seven (Group II) blunt. Group I: Nine patients were in shock upon admission, including six with cardiac tamponade. Six pts were stabbed, three sustained a gunshot wound, and two were accidental victims of a pneumatic gun. In the last pt, with previous lung surgery and mediastinal shift, a chest tube lacerated the right ventricle; this pt died in the operating room (OR), for a mortality rate of 8.3% (1/12). Associated intrathoracic and intra-abdominal lesions were present, but did not influence the outcome. Group II: All pts were involved in motor vehicle accidents. Five pts were in shock, including two with cardiac tamponade. Three pts required extracorporeal circulation (ECC) for aortic valve replacement, tricuspid valve reconstruction, and replacement of the ascending aorta. In one case, a lacerated right ventricle could be repaired without ECC, but the pt died from low cardiac output. Three pts with a ruptured left ventricle were managed in the OR, and two pts exsanguinated for a mortality rate of 43% (3/7). Associated lesions were present and death was related to ventricular rupture. Intrapericardial lesions are relatively rare in our Canadian experience. High survival can be obtained in penetrating injuries, while blunt injuries are more complex and remain highly lethal. ECC should be available for definitive treatment.\r"

The per cent increase in mean LOS and the relative odds of an extended LOS (i.e., greater than or equal to 3 weeks) were estimated for surviving trauma patients with and without one or more of 11 pre-existing medical conditions, taking into account both the ISS severity of injuries and patient age. Nineteen per cent (n = 5,224) of the trauma cases had one or more of the 11 PECs; 5% (n = 1,384) had two or more PECs. Those with one or more PECs stayed significantly longer (p less than 0.001) than those who had none. Mean LOS was shown to be 69% higher for those with versus those without PECs. Furthermore, patients with PECs were more than twice as likely as those without PECs to have stayed in the hospital 3 weeks or longer. The size of the effect, however, varied by patient age and injury severity; the effect of PECs on length of stay was larger among younger patients and patients with less severe injuries. With regionalization, trauma centers treat the majority of these patients and potentially suffer disproportionate financial losses when reimbursement is based on DRGs.\r"

A canine model tested the efficacy of low-flow oxygen delivery, coupled with commonly available intravenous catheters, for PTCV in a large animal model. Previous studies at this institution demonstrated the feasibility of this technique in a small animal model (feline). Eighteen mongrel dogs were anesthetized, intubated, and ventilated for 30 min with a volume ventilator. The endotracheal tube was then removed, the trachea cross-clamped, and PTCV was instituted and continued for 60 minutes. Arterial blood gas analysis was performed every 5-15 min during the experimental period. Oxygen flow rates of 3, 5, and 7 L/min were paired with catheter sizes of 10 and 12 gauge (g) creating six experimental groups (three animals in each group). Data demonstrate that PTCV provided adequate oxygenation (pO2 greater than 450 mm Hg) and ventilation (pCO2 less than 85 mm Hg) with flow rates of 5 and 7 L/min with both catheter sizes. Satisfactory oxygenation (pO2 greater than 250 mm Hg) could be obtained with the 3 L/min flow rate with both catheter sizes, but ventilation was inadequate (PCO2 greater than 200 mm Hg). Using readily available materials and low-flow oxygen rates this PTCV technique was shown to be safe and effective in oxygenating and ventilating this canine model with complete airway obstruction.\r"

The null hypothesis evaluated was that there was no difference in outcome for patients transported by helicopter EMS (HEMS) when compared to patients transported by conventional ground EMS. The dependent variable of outcome was studied using the TRISS method in a group of 872 consecutive trauma patients admitted after long-distance transfer. Of this group, 110 patients transported by ground and 103 patients transported by air met the inclusion criteria. The ground EMS group had a mean TS of 14.4, a mean ISS of 25.2, and a mean Ps of 0.867. TRISS predicted 15 deaths and there were 15 actual deaths. The HEMS group had a mean TS of 11.4, a mean ISS of 34.9, and a mean Ps of 0.587. There were 46 predicted deaths and 33 actual deaths. This 25.4% reduction in predicted mortality was significant (Z = 3.95; p less than 0.001). Stratification of patients into Probability of Survival (Ps) bins allowed for outcome evaluation of groups with similar levels of injury severity. The benefit of HEMS transport was seen only in the patients with a probability of survival of less than 90%. We conclude that the major trauma patients transported by HEMS had a better outcome than those transported by ground EMS. The benefit seen with HEMS was directly related to injury severity and was demonstrated only in the patients with a Ps of less than 0.90.\r"

Groups I and II differed in age and mechanism of injury. Two other descriptive variables (sex and year of admission) showed statistically significant associations with outcome. To adjust for the joint effect of these four variables, a log-linear model (binary outcomes) or a linear regression model (continuous outcomes) was used. We defined need for interhospital transfer (NIT) based on the following: death, an Injury Severity Score of greater than or equal to 16, or direct admission to the operating room or intensive care unit. We conclude that the presence of three or more rib fractures identified a group of patients requiring transfer to a trauma center (positive predictive value = 92.8%). A population-based study is needed to verify this finding.\r"

During a 6-month period beginning February 1, 1987, 613 motor vehicle crash victims presented alive to the Trauma Center at the University of Tennessee Medical Center at Knoxville and were entered into this study. There were 254 restrained victims (R), 290 unrestrained (UR), and 69 who were excluded for lack of sufficient data regarding restraint usage. Unrestrained victims tended to be younger (mean age: UR = 27.9, R = 31.7; p less than 0.03), and more often male (UR = 65% vs. R = 51%; p less than 0.03). Irrespective of position within the vehicle, the mean number of facial lacerations per person was less in the restrained group (R = 0.31, UR = 0.76; p less than 0.03). This injury reduction was more pronounced in front seat occupants (R = 0.27, UR = 0.82; p less than 0.03). Furthermore, a smaller proportion of the lacerations in the restrained group were categorized as complex, i.e., involving more than skin and subcutaneous tissue (R = 5.0%, UR = 15.9%; p less than 0.03). The pattern of skeletal injuries was also significantly different.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Hubs were cultured (by swab culture) at times of tubing change and at the time of catheter removal. Skin cultures of the area surrounding the catheter were done at the time of insertion and removal. Catheter tip infection was defined as 15 or more colony forming units. Positive cultures were found in 25.7% of the cases, and were most often due to Pseudomonas species (33%) and coagulase-negative Staphylococcus (29%). Infections occurred in 35% of arterial catheters, 27% of central, and 12% of peripheral venous catheters. No benefit was observed from changing the administration tubing at 24 hours vs. 48 hours. Hub cultures were positive 30% of the time at 24 hours, 39% at 48 hours and 41% at 72 hours. Although the isolated organisms correlated with tip cultures, false positive rates varied from 8 to 62%.

This raises the possibility that these compounds may also be able to inhibit glucagon-stimulated hepatic gluconeogenesis. The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of varying concentrations of somatomedin-A on glucagon-stimulated gluconeogenesis in isolated perfused rat liver. The infusion of glucagon increased the rate of gluconeogenesis from 0.0038 +/- 0.001 to 0.042 +/- 0.007 microM 14C-glucose made from 14C-alanine per min. This action of glucagon was reduced to 22% of its maximum by the coinfusion of 1 microU/ml of SM-A and completely eliminated by the coinfusion of 100 microU/ml of SM-A. Somatomedin alone did not alter the basal rate of gluconeogenesis. The decrease in the release of 14C glucose from livers that had been stimulated by glucagon could not be attributed to increased glycogenolysis. Thus, it appears that the reduction in 14C release represents SM-A mediated reduction in glucagon-stimulated gluconeogenesis.\r"

  ".W": "Rapid fluid administration is the cornerstone of successful trauma resuscitation. Percutaneous insertion of catheter introducers has gained wide acceptance as a quick and reliable means of rapid intravascular volume expansion. Factors that affect rapid fluid resuscitation with these devices include catheter introducer kinking, the type and temperature of infusate, and diameter of co-apted administration tubing. Rates of flow through 8.5 French catheters from 0 to 80 degrees of catheter angulation were determined in vitro for various fluids (crystalloid, whole blood, diluted packed cells) and administration tubing of different sizes (regular IV tubing, blood tubing, and large-bore trauma tubing). The flow rate of crystalloid infusion through blood tubing was found to be approximately double that of regular IV tubing (316 cc/min vs. 160 cc/min), and trauma tubing had approximately three times the flow rate of blood tubing (805 cc/min). Warmed diluted packed cells could be infused almost twice as fast as cold whole blood (642 cc/min vs. 340 cc/min). Kinking of the catheter introducer, a heretofore poorly described phenomenon, halved the flow rate of fluids through large-bore trauma tubing (805 cc/min vs 350 cc/min) but had no effect when standard IV tubing was utilized. Piggybacking blood into an existing IV line instead of infusing it directly into the catheter can decrease blood flow 94% (340 cc/min vs. 20 cc/min). It is concluded that a large-bore catheter, by itself, does not guarantee high flow rates. Physician recognition of these concepts can result in improved resuscitation of hypovolemic patients.\r"

Three of them were younger than 15 years and another one was only 3 years old at the time of the trauma. All the elements involved in the treatment of the lesions are described. When it was possible, an end-to-end anastomosis was used for the repair of arteries and veins. Otherwise, when the loss of tissue was marked, a saphenous vein graft was used. The fracture was treated, when possible, with an intramedullary fixation, surely less traumatizing for soft tissues than a plate. The repair of the nerve was at times simultaneous at other times delayed. The followup has shown a good functional restoration of the limb and of the joints affected by the trauma and a normal development of the patients in terms of age.\r"

During the recovery period, the subjects breathed either room air or 100% oxygen, assigned by randomized, double-blind design. The entire procedure was repeated on each subject using the opposite gas. The administration of enriched oxygen during the recovery period had no effect on plasma lactate levels or on performance during the second period of exercise. The subjects were unable to identify which gas they received. In conclusion, data from this study indicate that using 100% oxygen applied for short periods offers no advantage on recovery from exhaustive exercise or on subsequent exercise performance.\r"

We report the results of intake evaluation of a stratified random sample of a large adult population previously studied for the determinants of atopic disease. In 269 subjects, the prevalence of systemic allergic sting reactions was 3.3% and 26.5% had IgE antibodies to venom demonstrated by skin test or radioallergosorbent test. Asymptomatic sensitization (positive venom skin test) was observed in 15% of subjects with no history of an allergic sting reaction. Positive venom skin tests were more frequent in men, in those with positive skin tests to inhalant allergens, and in subjects aged 20 through 29 years. A positive venom skin test or radioallergosorbent test was more frequent in subjects who had been stung within the previous 3 years (35%) than in those stung more than 3 years before (20%). We conclude that both systemic allergic reactions to insect stings and asymptomatic sensitivity to venom are common and that most affected persons never seek medical advice. The significance of asymptomatic venom sensitization is unknown.\r"

Sixteen of the 38 patients had positive blood cultures: 14 with gram-negative rods and 2 with Streptococcus pneumoniae. Initial serum samples for TNF determinations were obtained within 2 to 72 hours (mean, 18.8 hours) after the onset of clinical signs of sepsis. Six (16%) of 38 patients had detectable TNF levels: 4 of 14 with positive blood cultures for gram-negative rods but only 2 of 22 with negative blood cultures (odds ratio, 4; 95% confidence limits, 0.5 and 24.3). Of the 6 patients, 4 had received the placebo and 2 had received the antibody. Tumor necrosis factor levels did not predict adult respiratory distress syndrome, shock, disseminated intravascular coagulation, renal failure, or mortality. The highest TNF levels (500 and 250 pg/mL) were observed in 2 patients with Enterobacter cloacae bacteremia who had received the placebo and antilipid A antibody, respectively. The other 2 patients with bacteremia and detectable TNF levels had positive blood cultures for Haemophilus influenzae (50 pg/mL) and Bacteroides fragilis (120 pg/mL), respectively. Despite negative blood cultures, the remaining 2 patients repeatedly had detectable TNF levels and a clinical picture consistent with gram-negative sepsis.\r"

Moreover, hyperlipidemia is also common among these patients. Despite this, there are virtually no data regarding the level of awareness and treatment of hyperlipidemia among diabetic subjects at the community level. We therefore examined 374 Mexican-Americans and 86 non-Hispanic whites with type II diabetes identified in an epidemiologic survey that involved 3279 Mexican-Americans and 1847 non-Hispanic whites who resided in San Antonio, Tex. More than 40% of the diabetic subjects were hyperlipidemic according to the criteria of the National Cholesterol Education Program, and an additional 23% had hypertriglyceridemia and/or low levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. By contrast, less than one fourth of the nondiabetic subjects were hyperlipidemic. Only approximately 25% of non-Hispanic whites with diabetes were aware of their hyperlipidemia, and less than 10% were receiving treatment. Awareness and treatment were even less frequent among Mexican-Americans with diabetes. Community physicians should be encouraged to give early attention to the management of lipid disorders in their diabetic patients.\r"

There were 37 male inmate suicide deaths between 1979 and 1987 (39.6 suicides per 100,000 male inmates), which is significantly higher than the age- and race-adjusted male suicide rate in the general population of Maryland (22.0 per 100,000). Risk of male inmate suicide was increased for the following characteristics: white race (relative risk [RR], 2.0; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.1 to 3.9), age 25 to 34 years (RR, 1.8; 95% CI, 1.0 to 3.4), major crime committed against person (RR, 3.4; 95% CI, 1.7 to 6.7), life sentence (RR, 4.7; 95% CI, 2.2 to 10.0), and classification to the major maximum security institution in the prison system (RR, 5.1; 95% CI, 2.7 to 9.8). The methods of suicide chosen by inmates were hanging (86%), cutting wound (5%), antidepressant overdose (5%), and fall from height (3%). We conclude that inmate suicide represents a significant correctional health and public health problem. Specific implications for prevention of inmate suicide are examined.\r"

This study describes the medical care provided during a 1-year period to 6304 patients registered with a family practice clinic located in an academic medical center. The relative distribution of primary care, secondary referrals, inpatient admissions, and their associated costs are presented. The multiplier effect of the primary care clinic on the academic medical center was substantial. For every $1 billed for ambulatory primary care, there was $6.40 billed elsewhere in the system. Each full-time equivalent family physician generated a calculated sum of $784,752 in direct, billed charges for the hospital and $241,276 in professional fees for the other specialty consultants. The cost of supporting a primary care clinic is likely to be more than offset by the revenues generated from the use of hospital and referral services by patients who received care in the primary care setting.\r"

Of the 57 patients with a known history of infection, 49.1% had no insurance vs 36.0% of seronegative patients. Infected patients were three times more likely to be admitted as seronegative patients. Overall, health providers followed universal precautions during 44.0% of interventions. In patients with profuse bleeding, adherence fell to 19.5%. The most common reasons given by providers for not following precautions were insufficient time to put on protective attire and interference with procedural skills. We conclude that the human immunodeficiency virus epidemic has a major impact on emergency services and that strategies need to be developed for appropriate use of emergency resources and also for maximizing provider protection.\r"

As a group, these patients share many manifestations of the Marfan syndrome including long limbs, deformity of the thoracic cage, striae atrophicae, mitral valve prolapse, and mild dilatation of the aortic root. Clinical clustering did not emerge when patients were stratified by mitral valve prolapse or aortic dilatation. The clinical phenotype of patients with mitral valve prolapse constitutes a continuum, from Marfan syndrome at one extreme to isolated mitral valve prolapse due to myxomatous proliferation of the valve leaflets. In the absence of biochemical or DNA markers, discerning whether a patient with mitral valve prolapse and mild aortic root dilatation (in the absence of ectopia lentis or a family history) has Marfan syndrome, or another heritable disorder of connective tissue, will continue to be a clinical challenge. Until subclassification based on refined clinical, genetic, and laboratory investigations is possible, the patients we describe are best seen as having an \"overlap\" heritable connective-tissue disorder. We suggest the acronym \"MASS phenotype\" to emphasize involvement of the mitral valve, aorta, skeleton, and skin.\r"

Despite the potential problems, moonlighting, or outside employment, represents additional income to residents that enables repayment of massive student loans and/or improves their standard of living. It means additional clinical experience and responsibility, which many feel enhances their educational experience, and it permits essential night and weekend coverage for community hospital emergency departments and walk-in centers. Because of these important considerations for residents, community hospitals, and risk management, the University of Massachusetts Medical Center has developed a unique approach to the problems of moonlighting that addresses the concerns of all involved parties. The development of extended employment guidelines has also enabled the medical center to maintain a detailed database on the volume of such activity.\r"

  ".W": "Severe tricuspid regurgitation may produce significant morbidity and mortality if not corrected, but commonly used methods of intraoperative assessment may be unreliable. Tricuspid regurgitation was evaluated by a new intraoperative technique, Doppler color flow mapping, in 85 patients before and after cardiopulmonary bypass. Regurgitation grade by intraoperative color Doppler mapping correlated well with right ventricular angiography (kappa value = 0.92, p less than 0.01; n = 8) and with preoperative color Doppler studies (kappa = 0.71, p less than 0.05; n = 51). The right atrial V wave correlated poorly with the severity of tricuspid regurgitation intraoperatively, both before (r = 0.30) and after (r = -0.05, p = no significant difference) cardiopulmonary bypass. Advanced (3+ or 4+) tricuspid regurgitation was found in 40% (21) of 52 patients requiring mitral valve repair or replacement. Tricuspid annuloplasty with a prosthetic ring provided a significant (greater than or equal to 2 grade) reduction in regurgitation severity in 94% (17/18; p less than 0.05). Without repair, tricuspid regurgitation decreased to a similar degree after mitral valve operations in 14% (5/36); only one of the five patients had advanced tricuspid regurgitation prepump. Fluid filling of the arrested right ventricle after the surgical procedure did not predict regurgitation severity (false negative rate 50%, 2/4; false positive rate 22%, 2/9). Regurgitation grade remained unchanged after the initial postpump study, up to 60 weeks postoperatively. In conclusion, color Doppler flow mapping provides more accurate intraoperative assessment of tricuspid regurgitation than the right atrial V wave or fluid filling of the right ventricle. This semiquantitative technique aids in the selection of patients appropriate for surgical repair of the tricuspid valve and is useful in judging the adequacy of tricuspid valve repair before chest closure. Advanced (3+ or 4+) tricuspid regurgitation is a common occurrence in patients undergoing mitral valve repair or replacement and rarely responds to conservative (nonoperative) management. Ring annuloplasty provides a highly effective and durable reduction in tricuspid regurgitation.\r"

The neodymium:yttrium-aluminum-garnet laser was used for vaporization of obstructing esophageal carcinoma in 18 patients requiring 24 treatments. Three women and 15 men (age range 42 to 87 years) had esophageal carcinoma (seven squamous cell and nine adenocarcinoma). Twelve tumors were at the esophagogastric junction, four at the midesophagus, and two in the cervical esophagus. Lengths varied from 3 to 7 cm. Inoperability was due to diffuse metastases in eight patients, local invasion in five, poor operative risk in one patient, and patient refusal for operative treatment in four patients. Energy use was 1000 to 22,600 J per session (mean 6120 J). Good results were achieved in 16 patients (88.9%): Seven returned to full diet, five to soft diet, and four to full fluids without dysphagia. Four patients required retreatment 1 to 3 months later because of recurrent dysphagia. One patient was not benefited by the treatment and died of carcinomatosis 1 week later. No intraoperative complications occurred. Postoperatively, one patient had laryngeal edema and another had a bronchoesophageal fistula 3 weeks later. The mean survival time is 3 1/2 months. Neodymium:yttrium-aluminum-garnet laser vaporization for obstructing esophageal carcinoma is effective palliation regardless of histologic tumor type. It can be performed under direct vision with a low frequency of postoperative complications.\r"

  ".U": "89294620\r", 
  ".W": "Six hours of coronary occlusion has been thought to produce extensive and irreversible transmural damage and no possibility of salvage by reperfusion. This has been based on findings of adenosine triphosphate depletion and histochemical (triphenyltetrazolium chloride nonstaining) and ultrastructural changes (conventional preparatory techniques). This study tests the hypothesis that, in contrast to conventional wisdom, considerable structural and mitochondrial functional integrity remains in cardiac muscle subjected to 6 hours of regional ischemia. Twenty open-chest anesthetized dogs underwent isolation of the left anterior descending coronary artery and were observed for 6 hours. Eight of the 20 did not undergo ischemia and served as controls. Twelve underwent 6 hours of proximal ligation of the left anterior descending coronary artery (30% +/- 2% area at risk). Transmural biopsy specimens were analyzed. Coronary occlusion reduced regional blood flow (radioactive microspheres) to less than 10 ml/100 gm/min (p less than 0.05) and dyskinesia persisted in the area at risk for 6 hours. High-energy phosphates (adenosine triphosphate and creatine phosphate) declined to negligible levels and histochemical damage occurred (49% +/- 12% triphenyltetrazolium chloride non-staining). Mitochondrial ultrastructural changes (low protein denaturation embedding technique) were mild (the integrity of the inner and outer mitochondrial surface membranes and crystal membranes was maintained and myofibrillar degeneration did not occur). Mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation rate remained at 63% of control levels, respiratory control index remained at 77%, and adenosine diphosphate/oxygen ratio was maintained at 96%. Mitochondrial Ca++ increased with lanthanum (from 26 to 46 nmol/mg protein, p less than 0.05), but irreversible calcium precipitation did not occur; calcium could be mobilized to normal levels (i.e., 13 nmol/mg protein) by ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid chelation. These data support our inference that necrosis does not occur after 6 hours of coronary occlusion and suggest that muscle salvage by reperfusion is possible after at least 6 hours of regional myocardial ischemia.\r"
