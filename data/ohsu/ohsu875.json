  ".W": "The overall incidence of colloid (mucinous) carcinoma in patients with colorectal cancer is 17 percent, and its influence on patterns of failure and survival in patients with colorectal cancer varies throughout the literature. The presence of colloid carcinoma may have a real but small impact on the patterns of failure or survival in colorectal cancer. The data are conflicting and, furthermore, by proportional hazards analysis, colloid carcinoma is not an independent prognostic factor for survival. Therefore, despite it being common clinical practice, a change in treatment recommendations based solely on the presence or absence of colloid cancer is not recommended. Treatment recommendations should be based primarily on the tumor stage and site. However, given the trend toward increased failure and decreased survival compared with adenocarcinoma, colloid carcinoma should be reported separate from other histological patterns to better understand its natural history.\r"

  ".W": "Proteolytic conversion of fibrinogen to fibrin results in self-assembly to form a three-dimensional clot matrix that subsequently becomes cross-linked by fXIIIa to form the central structural element of the in vivo thrombus. The process of fibrin formation and assembly leads to new properties that serve to regulate the rate and extent of clotting, cross-linking, and fibrinolysis. These are brought about by the ability of fibrin (1) to bind thrombin at a noncatalytic site, thus limiting its diffusability but at the same time preserving its catalytic potential; (2) to bind fXIII, regulate its activation to fXIIIa, and limit further activation of fXIII once fibrin cross-linking has occurred; and (3) to bind alpha 2-PI, tPA, and plasminogen and regulate the initiation and propagation of fibrinolysis. Additional interactions not covered in this review between fibrin(ogen), and other plasma proteins, cells or matrix components suggest other functions for fibrin that, along with those discussed above, define a critical role in modulating hemostasis, inflammation, and the wound healing process.\r"

We found that from 13 weeks' gestation the AFI rose progressively until 26 weeks. From then to 38 weeks the AFI measurements demonstrated little variation. After 38 weeks the AFI appeared to decline gradually. In the third trimester the mean AFI was 16.0 +/- 4.8 cm; 5% of cases had an AFI less than or equal to 8 cm, and 5% had an AFI greater than or equal to 24 cm. These results confirm the reproducibility of the semiquantitative technique and suggest that in estimating amniotic fluid volume, AFI measurement may be a more appropriate means than measurement of the single largest pocket or subjective assessment. Serial AFI measurement would be an effective way of assessing fetal status throughout pregnancy.\r"

Each woman took 600 mg of phenazopyridine hydrochloride (Pyridium, Parke-Davis) in three equally divided doses over 18-24 hours and then underwent a standardized, one-hour pad test as described by the International Continence Society. The Pyridium pad test was regarded as positive if there was any orange staining on the pad. The quantitative pad-weighing test was considered positive if there was a weight gain of 1.0 g or more at the end of the one-hour test period. All 18 patients with genuine stress incontinence had positive Pyridium pad tests, and all had pad weight gains of greater than or equal to 1.0 g (mean, 16.5). The maximum pad weight gain in the asymptomatic, continent volunteers was 0.7 g (mean, 0.1), and none was aware of any urinary leakage during the test; however, 12 (52%) had positive Pyridium pad tests. The Pyridium pad test appears 100% sensitive in detecting urine loss in symptomatic women with genuine stress incontinence, but it has a high false-positive rate in healthy, asymptomatic, continent women. If pad-weighing tests are done, the addition of Pyridium generally will not be useful, and if Pyridium is used by itself, the results may be misleading.\r"

Our goal was to compare some of these tests and to evaluate their comparative strengths and weaknesses as clinically useful tools in confirming the diagnosis, especially in borderline cases. Twenty-one consecutive patients from our colposcopy clinic were screened with cytology and colposcopy. Biopsies were taken from representative areas on the cervix and vulva and divided. One-half was evaluated with Southern blot hybridization and the other half with histology and with RNA and DNA in situ hybridization. Cytology and histology were interpreted as either \"positive\" (showing definite evidence of human papillomavirus infection or cervical intraepithelial neoplasia [CIN]), \"negative\" (showing no evidence of human papillomavirus infection or CIN) or \"equivocal\" (atypical [class II] Papanicolaou smears or histology suggestive but not diagnostic of condyloma). In order to determine the clinical significance of equivocal results the sensitivity and specificity of these tests were calculated, with the equivocal results reclassified as either positive or negative. Colposcopy was the most sensitive technique but was not very specific. Cytology was a very sensitive screening tool when the atypical (class II) smears were considered positive but not when they were considered negative. The specificity of the histologic diagnosis was doubled with the equivocal results considered negative when compared to the specificity of the histologic diagnosis with the equivocal results considered positive, with no loss of sensitivity. Each technique has drawbacks, and therefore no one should be used to diagnose and treat these lesions to the exclusion of all others.\r"

Fifty percent of the patients failed to respond to nipple stimulation after 30 minutes and were switched to oxytocin. These patients experienced a more rapid rate of cervical dilation in the active phase and reached higher maximal uterine activity with oxytocin stimulation; however, the cesarean section rate was highest in this group. Nipple stimulation with a breast pump appears to be a safe and effective alternative to oxytocin for the augmentation of labor.\r"

We evaluated the usefulness of the AFI in the early intrapartum period as it relates to subsequent fetal morbidity and fetal heart rate patterns. Two hundred term gravidas presenting in the latent phase of labor with vertex-presenting fetuses were studied. An intrapartum AFI less than or equal to 5.0 cm was associated with a significant increase in the risk of cesarean section for fetal distress and of an Apgar score of less than 7 at one minute as well as abnormal fetal heart rate patterns in late labor. The majority (71.4%) of the patients with an intrapartum AFI less than or equal to 5.0 cm had ruptured membranes on entry; however, there was no significant difference in outcome when they were compared to patients with intact membranes and oligohydramnios. Variable decelerations on entry were associated with oligohydramnios in 43.8% of the patients. An AFI less than or equal to 5.0 cm in the early intrapartum period is a risk factor for perinatal morbidity and abnormal fetal heart rate patterns in subsequent labor, and ruptured membranes in early labor are a risk factor for oligohydramnios.\r"

Each patient's diagnosis was established independently of synovial fluid laboratory test results; in 69 patients a definite inflammatory or noninflammatory categorization could be made. Sensitivity and specificity were estimated for synovial fluid white blood cell count (sensitivity, 0.84; specificity, 0.84), percentage of polymorphonuclear cells (sensitivity, 0.75; specificity, 0.92), glucose (sensitivity, 0.20; specificity, 0.84), protein (sensitivity, 0.52; specificity, 0.56), and lactate dehydrogenase (sensitivity, 0.83; specificity 0.71). Receiver operating characteristic regression analysis indicated that both white blood cell count and percentage of polymorphonuclear cells were found to contribute independent diagnostic information but lactate dehydrogenase did not. In a separate, retrospective analysis of 19 patients with definite septic arthritis, similar results were observed. We conclude that synovial fluid white blood cell count and percentage of polymorphonuclear cells perform well as discriminators between inflammatory and noninflammatory disease. Ordering chemistry studies of synovial fluid should be discouraged because they are likely to provide misleading or redundant information.\r"

Elderly hypertensive patients pose a number of diagnostic dilemmas, including pseudohypertension, postural and postprandial decreases in blood pressure, and the potential for renovascular hypertension. Data from large clinical trials have documented protection from cardiovascular complications by antihypertensive therapy for elderly people with combined systolic and diastolic hypertension. However, no data are available concerning the value of therapy for those with isolated systolic hypertension. Until such data become available from the Systolic Hypertension in the Elderly Program in 1991, cautious reduction of elevated systolic blood pressure levels is recommended. The fragile physiologic characteristics of the elderly demand caution and gentleness in the use of any therapy to lower blood pressure. Nondrug therapies are safe and may be effective. A variety of drugs are available and can be used to gradually reduce blood pressure to presumably safer levels.\r"

Normal values for diastolic filling measurement vary depending on the individual radionuclide methods used and the age of the patient. Comparative studies of the radionuclide method with contrast angiographic and Doppler echocardiographic techniques for measuring diastole are discussed, and the advantages and disadvantages of the radionuclide techniques are explored. The role of radionuclide assessment of diastolic function in specific clinical examples of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, hypertension, anthracycline-induced cardiomyopathy, and coronary artery disease is reviewed. Radionuclide ventriculography is an accurate and easily applicable procedure for studying left ventricular volume changes in diastole.\r"

With advances in medical care, such as improvement in the management of end-stage renal disease, hemodialysis, and renal transplantation, patients with ADPKD will experience an increased life expectancy. As a result, complications associated with hepatic cysts may become more common, and physicians may encounter an increasing number of patients with ADPKD who have infected hepatic cysts. Several issues in the management of this complication remain unresolved, but the article by Telenti and associates in this issue of the Proceedings addresses some of the critical issues that physicians who are responsible for the care of these patients will certainly confront in future years.\r"

The clinical manifestations were an acute (58%) or subacute (42%) febrile illness, typically associated with tenderness in the right upper quadrant, leukocytosis, a very high erythrocyte sedimentation rate, but minor abnormalities of liver function tests. Bacteremia was present in 7 of 11 patients. Enterobacteriaceae grew in pure culture from the cyst fluid in 9 of 12 patients. Complex cysts were observed by ultrasonography (in four of eight patients), computed tomography (in six of nine), and magnetic resonance imaging (in two of two). 111In leukocyte scans were positive in all four patients in whom they were done, and 67Ga scans were positive in only one of three patients. An unfavorable outcome was observed in six of seven patients treated with only antibiotics, in contrast with one of seven patients who received antibiotics and early drainage. In two patients, ciprofloxacin cyst levels were 2.3 and 4.8 times higher than the level in serum; in a third patient, cyst levels remained in therapeutic range 30 hours after the last dose of ciprofloxacin, at which time serum levels were undetectable. Clinical and laboratory features and the use of modern scanning techniques facilitate a prompt diagnosis of infection in hepatic cysts in ADPKD. The treatment of choice is a combination of percutaneous drainage and antimicrobial therapy.\r"

Although line-related bacteremias and sepsis are relatively uncommon, the frequent use of central lines in the intensive-care unit makes these infections a common consideration. Semiquantitative culture techniques for analysis of the catheter tip provide evidence for the diagnosis of catheter-related infections. Bacterial growth of more than 15 colony-forming units/plate is typically considered significant. Preventive measures include using sterile insertion techniques, providing meticulous care for the local site, and minimizing the duration of catheter use. The practice of changing lines over a guidewire is controversial. For treatment of most catheter-related infections, the catheter should be removed and antibiotics should be administered if associated systemic infection occurs.\r"

  ".W": "Narcolepsy, a disorder of excessive daytime sleepiness that affects more than 125,000 people in the United States, is technically defined as a daytime mean sleep latency (time elapsed before falling asleep) of less than 5 minutes in conjunction with verification of rapid eye movement sleep in at least two of five daytime nap periods. Cataplexy, hypnagogic hallucinations, and sleep paralysis are frequently associated with narcolepsy. Currently, overnight polysomnography and multiple sleep latency testing in a sleep disorders laboratory are used to diagnose narcolepsy. Standard pharmacologic therapy consists of the judicious use of stimulants to improve alertness and the administration of tricyclic and other antidepressant drugs to suppress cataplexy. In addition, good sleep hygiene (a regular sleep-wake schedule, an adequate amount of sleep at night, and scheduled daytime naps) is essential for optimal management of this disorder. Patient and family education about narcolepsy and its treatment is also important. Even with use of the best available treatment regimens, many patients with narcolepsy have substantial vocational and social impairments.\r"

  ".W": "Two entities of special interest in sleep disorders medicine are restless legs syndrome and periodic movements of sleep. Most patients with restless legs syndrome have periodic movements of sleep, but most patients with the nocturnal disorder do not have restless legs when awake. In both conditions, the underlying cause is obscure, and the frequency of occurrence increases with advancing age. In most patients with restless legs syndrome, the results of complete blood cell counts and iron, ferritin, folate, and vitamin B12 levels are normal. No hematologic or chemical abnormalities have been reported in patients with periodic movements of sleep who do not also have restless legs syndrome. Various pharmacologic agents, including benzodiazepines, opiates, and levodopa, have been proposed for the treatment of both disorders. Although some patients respond to a single drug for long periods, in many patients tolerance develops and the efficacy diminishes. In such circumstances, a reasonable approach is to alternate chemically unrelated agents on a weekly or biweekly schedule. Transcutaneous electric nerve stimulation may be beneficial.\r"

  ".U": "90332004\r", 
  ".W": "Present thinking about the way that the NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) class of glutamate receptor operates at central synapses relies mainly on information obtained from single-channel and whole-cell recordings from cultured neurons stimulated by exogenous NMDA receptor agonists. The mechanisms that operate in the postsynaptic membrane of a normal neuron following release of the natural transmitter are far less clear. An important problem is that most normal neurons receive many excitatory synapses (10(3)-10(5) per cell) and these synapses are located on slender dendritic elements far away from the somatic recording site, making the study of discrete synaptic events difficult. Typically, when populations of synapses are activated, NMDA receptor-mediated synaptic potentials appear as slowly rising, long-lasting waves superimposed on faster, non-NMDA-receptor potentials. Although believed to be critical for NMDA receptor function, this slow time-course would not be predicted from single-channel kinetics and its origin remains puzzling. We have now analysed the events occurring at the level of a single excitatory synapse using a simple, small, neuron--the cerebellar granule cell--which has an unusually simple glutamatergic input. By applying high-resolution whole-cell recording techniques to these cells in situ, we were able to study the nature of elementary NMDA receptor-mediated synaptic currents. Contrary to expectations, the prominent currents are fast but are followed by slow ones. Both types of current are strongly voltage-dependent but differ subtly in this respect. Furthermore, the currents are absent unless glycine is provided.\r"

Recent work suggests that peptide binding may be required for efficient assembly and intracellular transport of MHC class I molecules, but it is not clear whether class I molecules can ever assemble in the absence of peptide. We report here that culture of the murine lymphoma mutant cell line RMA-S at reduced temperature (19-33 degrees C) promotes assembly, and results in a high level of cell surface expression of H-2/beta 2-microglobulin complexes that do not present endogenous antigens, and are labile at 37 degrees C. They can be stabilized at 37 degrees C by exposure to specific peptides known to interact with H-2Kb or Db. Our findings suggest that, in the absence of peptides, class I molecules can assemble but are unstable at body temperature. The induction of such molecules at reduced temperature opens new ways to analyse the nature of MHC class I peptide interactions at the cell surface.\r"

Non-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors mediate a component that has a rapid onset and decay while the component mediated by N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors has a slow rise-time and a decay of several hundred milliseconds, 100 times longer than the mean open time of NMDA channels. The slow decay of the NMDA-mediated e.p.s.c. could be due to residual glutamate in the synaptic cleft resulting in repeated binding and activation of NMDA receptors. However, in cultured hippocampal neurons, we find that the NMDA receptor antagonist D-2-amino-5-phosphonopentanoate has no effect on the slow e.p.s.c. when rapidly applied after activation of the synapse, suggesting that rebinding of glutamate does not occur. In addition, a brief pulse of glutamate to an outside-out membrane patch results in openings of NMDA channels that persist for hundreds of milliseconds, indicating that glutamate can remain bound for this period. These results imply that a brief pulse of glutamate in the synaptic cleft is sufficient to account for the slow e.p.s.c.\r"

Here we report that the pathway by which InsP6 is synthesized in the cellular slime mould Dictyostelium, and in cell-free preparations derived from them, is catalysed by a series of soluble ATP-dependent kinases independently of the metabolism of both phosphatidylinositol and Ins(1,4,5)P3. The intermediates between myo-inositol and InsP6 are Ins3P, Ins(3,6)P2, Ins(3,4,6)P3, Ins(1,3,4,6)P4 and Ins(1,3,4,5,6)P5. The 3- and 5-phosphates of InsP6 take part in futile cycles in which Ins(1,2,4,5,6)P5 and Ins(1,2,3,4,6)P5 are rapidly formed by dephosphorylation of InsP6, only to be rephosphorylated to yield their precursor.\r"

Blood flow velocities of the middle cerebral artery (MCA) and the ipsilateral internal carotid artery (ICA), high in the neck, were recorded noninvasively by Doppler ultrasonography. Serial examinations were begun within 48 hours of trauma and continued until the patient either died or was discharged. Spasm of the MCA was assumed if the ratio of the velocity of blood flow in the MCA (VMCA) to the velocity of blood flow in the ICA (VICA) exceeded 3 (normal value, 1.7 +/- 0.4). In cases of severe MCA spasm, this ratio is higher because of increased flow velocity in the MCA and reduced flow in the ICA due to increased cerebrovascular resistance. Higher MCA velocities with VMCA/VICA above 3, consistent with MCA spasm, were found in 14 of the 35 patients (40%). The increase began as early as 48 hours after injury, reached a maximum between Days 5 and 7, and lasted until 2 weeks after injury. There was a significant correlation between the occurrence of vasospasm and the quantity of cisternal or intracerebral blood seen on a computed tomographic scan. No correlation was found with the age of the patients, the Glasgow coma scale score at admission, the intracranial pressure, or the functional outcome 6 months after injury. The occurrence of a secondary infarction in a patient with severe MCA spasm suggests that, at least in some cases, spasm may influence the prognosis.\r"

  ".W": "A 40-year-old man had an acute ischemic event affecting the pons. He had no cardiac illness or vasculities and was not diabetic or hypertensive. The contrast-enhanced computed tomographic scan disclosed nothing abnormal, and a vertebral angiogram showed an avascular mass markedly displacing the basilar artery and pons posteriorly and toward the right. A magnetic resonance image clearly delineated a homogeneous arachnoid cyst containing cerebrospinal fluid. To avoid manipulating posterior fossa arteries, after the recent pontine stroke, this arachnoid cyst with unusually favorable anatomical landmarks was approached stereotactically through the vertex. Fenestration and drainage of the cyst was accomplished under local anesthesia and benzodiazepine sedation with low morbidity. The procedure was well tolerated, and the patient returned to gainful employment shortly afterward. He remains asymptomatic at 3 years' follow-up. The successful outcome of this case suggests that in carefully selected symptomatic arachnoid cysts, stereotactic interventions could become a useful surgical alternative. Stereotaxis may also be helpful in other cumbersome surgical cases in which a second port for contrast injection or simple manipulation would be advantageous.\r"

  ".W": "Nearly all cells respond to an increase in temperature by inducing a set of proteins, called heat shock proteins (HSPs). Because a large number of other stress conditions induce the HSPs (or at least the most abundant ones), this response is often termed the universal stress response. However, a careful study of conditions that truly mimic a temperature shift suggested that these proteins are induced in response to a change in the translational capacity of the cell. To test this directly, Escherichia coli cells were treated with antibiotics that target the prokaryotic ribosome. Two-dimensional gels were used to evaluate the ability of these drugs to alter the rate of synthesis of the HSPs. One group of antibiotics induced the HSPs, whereas a second group repressed the HSPs and induced another set of proteins normally induced in response to a cold shock. Depending on the concentration used, the induction of the heat or cold shock proteins mimicked a mild or severe temperature shift. In addition, antibiotics of the cold shock-inducing group were found to block high temperature induction of the HSPs. The results implicate the ribosome as a prokaryotic sensor for the heat and cold shock response networks, a role it may serve in eukaryotes as well.\r"

Expression vectors containing either normal or oncogenic point-mutated human c-fms genes were transfected into interleukin 3 (IL-3)-dependent 32D cells in order to determine the effects of CSF-1 signaling in this murine clonal myeloid progenitor cell line. CSF-1 was shown to trigger proliferation in association with monocytic differentiation of the 32D-c-fms cells. Monocytic differentiation was reversible upon removal of CSF-1, implying that CSF-1 was required for maintenance of the monocyte phenotype but was not sufficient to induce an irrevocable commitment to differentiation. Human CSF-1 was also shown to be a potent chemoattractant for 32D-c-fms cells, suggesting that CSF-1 may serve to recruit monocytes from the circulation to tissue sites of inflammation or injury. Although c-fms did not release 32D cells from factor dependence, point-mutated c-fms[S301,F969] (Leu-301----Ser, Tyr-969----Phe) was able to abrogate their IL-3 requirement and induce tumorigenicity. IL-3-independent 32D-c-fms[S301,F969] cells also displayed a mature monocyte phenotype, implying that differentiation did not interfere with progression of these cells to the malignant state. All of these findings demonstrate that a single growth factor receptor can specifically couple with multiple intracellular signaling pathways and play a critical role in modulating cell proliferation, differentiation, and migration.\r"

Erythrocyte extract prepared by sonication was found superior to extract prepared by freezing and thawing. Under the best conditions, up to 30% of the merozoites showed some development after 16 hr of incubation and approximately 5% developed into larger forms, often ring-shaped and occasionally showing pigment. The small as well as the larger forms took up the fluorescent dye rhodamine 123. Under similar conditions, partial further development was also obtained of young rings freed from their host cells. Again, the sonicated erythrocyte extract gave better development than the frozen-thawed extract, and ATP with pyruvate had a marked favorable effect. These parasites had both a plasma membrane and a surrounding closely apposed parasitophorous membrane, whereas the forms derived by extracellular development of merozoites had only their plasma membrane. We conclude that initial development requires neither an intact erythrocyte nor a parasitophorous membrane.\r"

The electronic absorption spectrum of the heterodimer mutant from 820-950 nm is relatively featureless in a poly(vinyl alcohol) film, but it exhibits some structure in a glycerol/water glass at 77 K. A feature is seen in the Stark effect spectrum of the heterodimer at 77 K centered at 927 and 936 nm in poly(vinyl alcohol) and a glycerol/water glass, respectively. This feature has approximately the same shape and width as the Stark effect for the primary electron donor of the wild type, which consists of a pair of bacteriochlorophyll alpha molecules. The angle zeta A between the transition moment at the frequency of absorption and the difference dipole delta muA is 36 +/- 2 degrees in the wild type and 32 +/- 2 degrees for that feature in the heterodimer. A range of values for [delta muA] = (13-17)/f Debye units (where f is the local field correction) is obtained for the 936-nm feature in glycerol/water, depending on analysis method. This feature is interpreted as arising from a transition to the lower exciton state of the heterodimer, which is more strongly mixed with a low-lying charge transfer transition than in the wild type.\r"

We present evidence that the Cdc28 protein kinase is also required for mitosis and that this function is executed in the G2 interval of the cell cycle. We show, in addition, that the protein kinase is highly active during this phase of the cell cycle. The dual role of the Cdc28 protein kinase in the S. cerevisiae cell cycle thus parallels that demonstrated for the cdc2 protein kinase of the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe.\r"

We engineered a chimeric human/mouse antibody to the tumor-associated antigen ganglioside GD2, with the aim of decreasing its serum half-life, maintaining its full antigen-binding capacity, and deleting its effector functions, thus making it a potentially useful reagent for the radioimaging of tumors. To this end, the constant region of the human gamma 1 chain was mutated by deleting the second domain (CH2). Here we show that the CH2-deleted antibody (ch14.18-delta CH2) was cleared from the blood of athymic (nu/nu) mice bearing human melanoma tumors with the same kinetics as human IgG F(ab')2. At a beta t1/2 of 12 hr, 0.9% of the injected dose of 125I-labeled ch14.18-delta CH2 was found per milliliter of blood 24 hr after i.v. injection. In biodistribution experiments, 125I-labeled ch14.18-delta CH2 targeted specifically to melanoma xenografts, achieving optimal tumor-to-tissue ratios 12-16 hr after i.v. injection. ch14.18-delta CH2 was localized to the melanoma tumors more rapidly and with better localization ratios than the intact chimeric antibody ch14.18. Sixteen hours after i.v. injection, the tumor-to-blood and tumor-to-liver ratios of ch14.18-delta CH2 were 5 and 12, respectively, while optimal localization ratios obtained for ch14.18 were 1 and 5, respectively, but 96 hr after injection. A reagent such as ch14.18-delta CH2 should be useful for radioimmunodetection of human tumors because of reduced immunogenicity, increased targeting specificity, and rapid clearance from circulation.\r"

Analysis of the predicted amino acid sequence of arg revealed that it is indeed closely related to that of c-abl. The two proteins are strikingly similar with regard to overall structural architecture as well as the amino acid sequences of their tyrosine kinase and src homologous 2 and 3 domains. In addition, arg, like c-abl, is expressed as two transcripts that result from a process of alternative splicing and encode alternative protein forms that differ only in their amino termini. The two genes define the Abelson subfamily of cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases and share a common homolog in Drosophila.\r"

Transfection with the B-chain construct induced synthesis of the PDGF B-chain homodimer (PDGF-BB) as assessed by the presence of 125I-labeled PDGF-BB competing activity in the conditioned medium of the transfected islet cells. Moreover, islet cells transfected with the PDGF beta-receptor construct exhibited increased immunofluorescence staining with a PDGF beta-receptor antibody. These cells also displayed increased 125I-labeled PDGF-BB binding compared with control transfected cells. Cotransfection with the B-chain construct or the addition of 10% fetal bovine serum or purified PDGF all induced DNA synthesis in islet cells transfected with the PDGF beta-receptor construct. Islet cells transfected with the PDGF alpha-receptor construct did not respond with stimulation of [3H]thymidine incorporation to any of the PDGF isoforms (PDGF-AA, -AB, or -BB). Cotransfection of the PDGF alpha- and beta-receptor constructs resulted in a loss of the DNA synthesis response to PDGF. The beta cells exhibited elevated levels of [3H]inositol trisphosphate after transfection with the B-chain and beta-receptor constructs, indicating activation of phospholipase C. Islet cells transfected with the different receptor constructs exhibited different patterns of tyrosine phosphorylation upon ligand activation. The results demonstrate that pancreatic islet cells can be stimulated to increase DNA synthesis by transfection with the PDGF beta-receptor gene, whereas cotransfection with the alpha-receptor gene may attenuate the growth response.\r"

This plasmid exploits the rotational nonequivalence of Ava I restriction sites to generate multiple copies of an inserted sequence. Twelve tandem repeats of the TAR were then placed in sense and antisense orientations behind a strong human beta-actin gene promoter. The TAR constructs were transfected with an appropriate HIV-1-driven reporter and tat gene expression plasmids into NT2/D1 cells, a pluripotential human embryonic teratocarcinoma cell line. Twelve tandem TAR repeats in the sense orientation suppressed 85-90% of the transactivating function of the virus-encoded tat protein, whereas the antisense construct or constructs containing single copies of TAR in either sense or antisense orientations were relatively ineffective. The suppression was specific for reporter gene constructs containing an intact HIV-1 long terminal repeat: Reporter genes driven by other promoters or by an HIV-1 long terminal repeat lacking the TAR were not suppressed. Suppression of activation by tat required transcription into RNA: Similar constructs containing the TAR repeats but lacking a eukaryotic promoter failed to suppress tat activation. In the absence of tat, the TAR DNA stimulated 2- to 5-fold the expression of gene constructs driven not only by the HIV-1 long terminal repeat but also by the human beta-actin gene and the simian virus 40 promoters.\r"

To study the generality and mechanisms of p53 alteration in human cancer, we examined 241 tumors of several types for structural aberrations of the locus. Alterations of the gene or its RNA or protein products consistent with loss of function by either recessive or dominant mechanisms were identified among this set uniquely in rhabdomyosarcomas and osteosarcomas. The alterations of p53 in rhabdomyosarcoma tumors included cases with complete deletion of both p53 alleles, complete deletions of one allele with or without point mutation of the remaining allele, and absence of detectable RNA. Similarly, we detected homozygous deletion and lack of expression of p53 RNA or aberrant expression of p53 protein in osteosarcomas. These observations provide strong support for the inclusion of the p53 locus in the group of loci whose functional inactivation by either dominant or recessive modes plays a significant role in human cancer.\r"

By using viral mutants, we now show that the induction of cellular DNA synthesis in quiescent cells by E1A differs from transformation in that E1A products induce synthesis if they are able to bind to either p105-Rb or p300, and only mutant products that bind to neither are extremely defective. These results suggest that p105-Rb and p300 (or cellular proteins with similar E1A-binding properties) provide parallel means by which DNA synthesis can be regulated.\r"

  ".W": "Arachidonic acid is metabolized by means of P450 isoenzyme(s) to form epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs) and their corresponding dihydroxy derivatives (DHETs). In the present study, we established the presence in human urine of 8,9-, 11,12-, and 14,15-EETs and their corresponding DHETs by developing quantitative assays and using negative ion, chemical ionization GC/MS and octadeuterated internal standards. Urinary excretion of 8,9- and 11,12-DHET increased in healthy pregnant women compared with nonpregnant female volunteers. By contrast, excretion of 11,12-DHET and 14,15-DHET, but not the 8,9-DHET regioisomer, increased even further in patients with pregnancy-induced hypertension. Intravenous administration of [3H]14,15-EET to three dogs markedly increased its DHET in plasma. The terminal half-life ranged from 7.9-12.3 min and the volume of distribution (3.5-5.3 liters) suggested limited distribution outside the plasma compartment. Negligible radioactivity was detected in urine; this fact infers that under physiological circumstances, urinary DHETs largely derive from the kidney. That P450 metabolites of arachidonic acid are formed in humans supports the hypothesis that these metabolites contribute to the physiological response to normal pregnancy and the pathophysiology of pregnancy-induced hypertension.\r"

  ".W": "The carrier of photosynthetically generated reducing power is the iron-sulfur protein ferredoxin, which provides directly, or via NADP+, reducing equivalents needed for CO2 assimilation and other metabolic reactions in the cell. It is now widely held that, in oxygenic photosynthesis, the generation of reduced ferredoxin-NADP+ requires the collaboration in series of two photosystems: photosystem II (PSII), which energizes electrons to an intermediate reducing potential and transfers them to photosystem I (PSI), which in turn is solely competent to energize electrons to the strong reducing potential required for the reduction of ferredoxin-NADP+ (the Z scheme). This investigation tested the premise of an alternative scheme, which envisions that PSII, without the involvement of PSI, is also capable of photoreducing ferredoxin-NADP+. We report here unexpected findings consistent with the alternative scheme. Isolated PSII reaction centers (completely free of PSI components), when supplemented with ferredoxin, ferredoxin-NADP+ oxidoreductase, and a PSII electron donor,1,5-diphenylcarbazide, gave a significant photoreduction of NADP+. A striking feature of this electron transfer from a PSII donor to the perceived terminal acceptor of PSI was its total dependence on catalytic quantities of plastocyanin, a copper-containing electron-transport protein hitherto known only as an electron donor to PSI.\r"

Previous studies show that activation of endogenous opioids by a cold water swim in rats with hind paw inflammation results in a similar local antinociceptive effect but suggest that pituitary-adrenal opioid pools are not directly involved in producing this effect. Here we show increased amounts of opioid peptides in immune cells infiltrating the inflamed tissue. Furthermore, we demonstrate immunoreactive opioid receptors on peripheral terminals of sensory neurons. The local administration of antibodies against opioid peptides or receptors or systemic pretreatment with the immunosuppressant cyclosporine blocks cold water swim-induced antinociception. These findings suggest that antinociception in inflammation can be brought about by endogenous opioids from immune cells interacting with opioid receptors on peripheral sensory nerves.\r"

Transcription from a number of weak promoters, regardless of their sequences, was dramatically activated in the presence of OmpR, a transcriptional activator. In vivo DNA footprinting revealed that OmpR enhanced the binding of RNA polymerase to the promoters. This enhancement was essential for transcription of weak promoters, while OmpR binding to the OBS fused to a strong promoter was inhibitory for transcription. These results indicate that OmpR stabilizes the formation of an RNA polymerase-promoter complex, possibly a closed promoter complex, and that a transcription activator can serve not only as a positive but also as a negative regulator for gene expression.\r"

Recent evidence has suggested that P. carinii is related to fungi and that the wall of the cyst form contains 1,3-beta-glucan as a major constituent. Based on this, several proposed 1,3-beta-glucan synthesis inhibitors were evaluated for their ability to control P. carinii pneumonia in vivo. Compounds from two classes of 1,3-beta-glucan synthesis inhibitors, the echinocandins and papulacandins, were found to be effective against P. carinii.\r"

  ".W": "To investigate early cellular alterations in liver DNA during hepatocarcinogenesis, we have visualized replicating cells and analyzed their DNA adduct content in livers of rats continuously fed a carcinogenic level (0.02%) of 2-acetylaminofluorene for periods up to 4 weeks. One hour prior to sacrifice, cells undergoing DNA synthesis were pulse-labeled with the thymidine analogue 5-bromodeoxyuridine. Replicating cells were visualized immunohistochemically with anti-(5-bromodeoxyuridine), and identification of aminofluorene-DNA adducts in replicating nuclei was achieved by staining with an antiserum specific for N-(deoxyguanosin-8-yl)-2-aminofluorene; both stains were observed simultaneously by two-color immunofluorescence. Data were obtained for all cells, including large hepatocytes (nuclei greater than 6 microns) and small cells (nuclei less than 6 microns), such as hepatocytes sliced asymmetrically, oval cells, Kuppfer cells, and sinusoidal lining cells. Based on the size of their nuclei, the hepatocytes were the only cells that could be identified separately from the total. A distinct increase in the number of cells synthesizing DNA was observed after 25 days of 2-acetylaminofluorene feeding; replicating cells were either scattered randomly throughout the liver or clustered in discrete foci. At times up to 28 days, cells with both large and small nuclei that were synthesizing DNA showed reduced aminofluorene-DNA adduct immunofluorescence compared to nonreplicating cells. The results suggest that liver cells replicating during carcinogen exposure have altered metabolic capacities resulting in reduced aminofluorene-DNA adduct formation. It is possible that such cells constitute the progenitors of preneoplastic foci, which have a replicative advantage as compared to normal liver.\r"

  ".U": "90332702\r", 
  ".W": "We recently found that inhibition of MYB protein synthesis in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) exposed to human c-myb (designated MYB) antisense oligodeoxynucleotides prevents entry into S phase and cell proliferation. To determine the mechanism(s) by which down-regulation of human c-myb protein (MYB) synthesis interferes with DNA synthesis, we analyzed mRNA levels of DNA polymerase alpha and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), transcripts of two genes required for DNA synthesis, in normal and leukemic T lymphocytes exposed to MYB antisense oligodeoxynucleotides. Expression of DNA polymerase alpha was inhibited both in normal T lymphocytes progressing from G0 to S phase and in exponentially growing CCRF-CEM leukemic cells, whereas expression of PCNA was inhibited only in mitogen-stimulated PBMC and remained essentially unaffected in the leukemia T-cell line. The functional link between expression of MYB and DNA polymerase alpha mRNAs was further demonstrated by analyzing DNA polymerase alpha mRNA levels in a temperature-sensitive (ts) fibroblast cell line (TK-ts13; TK is thymidine kinase) constitutively expressing human MYB mRNA driven by the simian virus 40 (SV40) promoter. In the MYB-expressing TK-ts13 cells, DNA polymerase alpha mRNA levels were unaffected following shift to the nonpermissive temperature of 39.6 degrees C, whereas in the parental line, DNA polymerase alpha mRNA levels were readily down-regulated. These findings indicate that the expression of MYB is related to that of DNA polymerase alpha in cells expressing MYB at high levels and suggest that there is a functional link between c-myb and DNA polymerase alpha mRNA expression during cell cycle progression of normal T lymphocytes.\r"

  ".W": "The ras gene product (p21) is a GTP-binding protein and is thought to play an important role in signal transduction of growth and differentiation in many types of mammalian cells. The p21.GTP complex is an active conformation, as described previously for polypeptide chain elongation factors (EF-Tu and EF-G) and heterotrimeric GTP-binding proteins (G proteins). In the study reported here, we measured the amounts of p21-bound guanine nucleotides under various conditions in the G54 cell line, a derivative of Swiss 3T3 cells that overexpresses normal c-Ha-ras. More p21.GTP complexes were present in growing cells than in quiescent cells. When quiescent cells were stimulated with fetal bovine serum to promote DNA synthesis, p21.GTP increased approximately 2-fold. Among a number of purified growth factors, platelet-derived growth factor enhanced the formation of p21.GTP, whereas the combination of bombesin and insulin, which also induces DNA synthesis, did not. These results strongly suggest that p21 is a transducer of the growth signal from the platelet-derived growth factor receptor in Swiss 3T3 cells and that the signal is transmitted through a p21.GTP complex.\r"

Although the immunogenicity of these epitopes can be enhanced by linking them to highly immunogenic carriers, such carriers derived from current vaccines have not proven to be generally effective. One reason may be related to epitope-specific suppression, in which prior vaccination with a protein can inhibit the antibody response to new epitopes linked to the protein. To circumvent such inhibition, a peptide from tetanus toxoid was identified that, when linked to a B cell epitope and injected into tetanus toxoid-primed recipients, retained sequences for carrier but not suppressor function. The antibody response to the B cell epitope was enhanced. This may be a general method for taking advantage of previous vaccinations in the development of new vaccines.\r"

The objective of this investigation was to study the possibility of using a different enzyme, adenylate kinase (AK), as a substitute for LDH. A bioluminescent assay was used, and three different platelet storage containers were studied. In a comparative study of AK and LDH activities during platelet storage, similar results were obtained, but some differences were also observed. Because more AK (in percentages) than LDH is contained in platelets, the initial levels of AK are lower than those of LDH. The release of AK activity from damaged platelets is delayed or is somewhat lower than that of LDH. The amount of AK activity released per platelet is correlated with the volume of the platelet units. A smaller volume entails increased AK activity. This observation applies to all storage conditions investigated, and the results in one of the containers indicate that this is also true for LDH. The results of the investigation demonstrate that similar information is obtained with LDH and AK. AK can be used as an alternative to LDH for studies of lytic processes during platelet storage.\r"

  ".W": "Right hemispheric brain injury has been noted in surviving infants treated with venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). This phenomenon may be secondary to permanent ligation of the right carotid artery. At our institution, conventional ventilatory therapy failed in five neonates with respiratory insufficiency, and they were treated successfully with ECMO. In four of the five neonates, the right carotid artery was reconstructed at the time of decannulation. At discharge, all newborns with carotid artery repair showed no signs of unilateral brain injury and had excellent antegrade flow in the right carotid artery as assessed by both duplex and transcranial Doppler ultrasound scanning. Carotid artery reconstruction after ECMO is a technically simple procedure that may reduce the incidence of right hemispheric brain injury and long-term consequences of marginal cerebral perfusion.\r"

Infection did not resolve in any patient prior to catheter removal, and five patients had positive blood cultures for 5 or more days after removal of the catheter. Six patients, including all who survived, were treated parenterally with antibiotics for more than 28 days. Two patients died; neither death was directly attributable to infection. Central venous thrombosis should be suspected in patients with persistent catheter-related bacteremia. Optimal treatment of this problem is not yet known.\r"

Inoculation induced sufficient serological responses: 99.7% for measles and rubella viruses and 96.3% for mumps virus. The incidence of febrile reaction (greater than or equal to 37.5 degrees C axillary temperature) was low, 15.9%, and a temperature of 39.0 degrees C or higher occurred in only 1.3% of the subjects.

  ".U": "90334149\r", 
  ".W": "Spontaneous mutation provides the substrate for evolution on one hand and for genetic susceptibility to disease on the other hand. X-linked diseases such as hemophilia B offer an opportunity to examine recent germ-line mutations in humans. By utilizing the direct sequencing method of genomic amplification with transcript sequencing, eight regions (2.46 kb) of likely functional significance in the factor IX gene have been sequenced in a total of 60 consecutive, unrelated hemophiliacs. The high frequency of patient ascertainment from three regions in the midwestern United States and Canada suggests that the sample is representative of hemophiliacs of northern European descent. Twenty-six of the delineated mutations are reported herein, and the group of 60 is analyzed as a whole. From the pattern of mutations causing disease and from a knowledge of evolutionarily conserved amino acids, it is possible to reconstruct the underlying pattern of mutation and to calculate the mutation rates per base pair per generation for transitions (27 x 10(-10)), transversions (4.1 x 10(-10), and deletions (0.9 x 10(-10)) for a total mutation rate of 32 x 10(-10). The proportion of transitions at non-CpG nucleotides is elevated sevenfold over that expected if one base substitution were as likely as another. At the dinucleotide CpG, transitions are elevated 24-fold relative to transitions at other sites. The pattern of spontaneous mutations in factor IX resembles that observed in Escherichia coli when the data are corrected for ascertainment bias. The aggregate data hint that most mutations may be due to endogenous processes. The following additional conclusions emerge from the data: (1) Although in recent decades reproductive fitness in individuals with mild and moderate hemophilia has been approximately normal, the large number of different mutations found strongly suggest that these levels of disease substantially compromised reproduction in previous centuries. (2) Mutations which putatively affect splicing account for at least 13% of independent mutations, indicating that the division of the gene into eight exons presents a significant genetic cost for the organism. In one individual a \"silent\" mutation at lysine 5 is likely to cause hemophilia by generating a perfect splice donor consensus sequence in exon b. (3) All the missense mutations occurred at evolutionarily conserved amino acids. As additional data are generated on the pattern of mutations caused by specific mutagens, it will be possible to utilize the pattern of spontaneous mutation to estimate the maximal contribution of that mutagen during the past century.\r"

The study explored the relationship between the mood-altering effects of ethanol and its effects on regional cerebral glucose utilization (CMRglu) in eight healthy male volunteers. In the first phase of the study, the subjects participated in a behavioral preference procedure conducted in a recreational environment to determine their responses to ethanol (0.5 g/kg) in a naturalistic setting. They then participated in three PET sessions, receiving at three to seven day intervals, in counterbalanced order, placebo, 0.5 g/kg or 0.8 g/kg ethanol. PET scans were conducted using a PETT-VI scanner with F-18-2-fluoro-2-deoxyglucose (FDG) as the tracer. The mood-altering effects of ethanol were measured in both the naturalistic and the PET phases of the study. Ethanol produced comparable effects on mood in the naturalistic and the PET settings (i.e., increases in positive mood). The lower dose of ethanol produced variable effects on whole brain and regional CMRglu across subjects. There was some suggestion that certain regional metabolic changes after ethanol were correlated with subjective responses to the drug. The higher dose of ethanol decreased whole brain CMRglu in most subjects. All regions were affected about equally. It was concluded that the mood-altering effects of ethanol are not related in a simple manner to regional changes in CMRglu.\r"

We studied recombinant human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (rhG-CSF), cloned from bladder cell carcinoma line 5637, in a nonneutropenic infection model of Streptococcus pneumoniae pulmonary infection in splenectomized and sham-operated control mice. The rhG-CSF improved survival in the splenectomized mice but not in the sham-operated mice. Circulating leukocyte counts were greatest for the rhG-CSF-treated splenectomized mice compared with all other groups, presumably due to a loss of splenic sequestration. Clearance of live pneumococci from mouse lung pairs was impaired after splenectomy. The rhG-CSF improved lung clearance in both splenectomized and sham-operated mice compared with saline solution-treated controls. The number of live pneumococci recovered from tracheobronchial lymph nodes at 24 hours after aerosol challenge was greatest in the splenectomized mice vs sham-operated mice. Decreased numbers of viable pneumococci were recovered from tracheobronchial lymph nodes from the rhG-CSF-treated splenectomized mice and the sham-operated mice vs saline solution-treated controls. The rhG-CSF may be a useful adjuvant for treating infections in individuals with immunologic dysfunctions other than neutropenia.\r"

We evaluated our experience with 75 patients presenting with primary hyperparathyroidism between January 1979 and September 1988. Prior to 1985 all patients underwent bilateral exploration. During this period, ultrasonographic localization in 6 patients proved highly accurate. Subsequently, routine preoperative ultrasonographic localization was used and patients were prospectively evaluated for the following: (1) incidence of unilateral exploration, (2) accuracy of ultrasonographic localization, (3) incidence of complications, and (4) operative time. Localization permitted unilateral exploration in 19 of 36 patients, although its accuracy depended on the interest of the radiologist involved. Institution A had an accuracy of 92%, while institution B had an accuracy of only 43%. There were fewer complications with unilateral exploration, and operative time was significantly less. Unilateral exploration based on preoperative ultrasonographic localization is recommended as the initial approach to primary hyperparathyroidism due to a single adenoma.\r"

Patients subsequently may have to undergo a major surgical procedure with exploration of the neck and open biopsy. We describe our experience with computed tomography and ultrasound-guided fine-needle and core-needle biopsy for 11 patients with inaccessible lesions in the head and neck. Carcinoma was diagnosed in three patients and nonmalignant pathologic findings in eight patients. Three of the needle biopsy findings were confirmed by surgical excision. The initial diagnoses made from the cytopathologic findings have remained unchanged in all patients. Compared with the alternative of open biopsy, we have found this method to be technically easy, diagnostically expeditious, and safe. Head and neck surgical oncologists should be familiar with image-guided biopsy techniques, since many of their patients may benefit from these diagnostic procedures.\r"

The patients were allocated randomly to three groups. Each group received the same treatment twice at two different doses. The night before operation, patients received zolpidem 10 mg, midazolam 7.5 mg or placebo and, 1 h before operation, zolpidem 20 mg, midazolam 15 mg or placebo. The sleep inducing effects of the drugs were comparable. Zolpidem and midazolam were significantly more effective sedatives than placebo 45 min after administration, but no difference was noted between the drugs. There was a comparable incidence of anterograde amnesia with zolpidem and midazolam, but the onset was shorter after zolpidem. Side effects were comparable in the three groups. Zolpidem is an effective hypnotic with a rapid onset and short duration of action which may be an alternative to midazolam for premedication.\r"

Patients who received somatostatin and trimetaphan in addition to sufentanil had significantly smaller serum growth hormone and plasma glucagon concentrations compared with those who received sufentanil and sodium nitroprusside. The cortisol response to surgery was inhibited in both groups. There were no significant differences in catecholamine concentrations between the two groups. There was no effect of the additional inhibition of glucagon and growth hormone on circulating concentrations of glucose and lactate, but plasma concentrations of non-esterified fatty acids increased significantly. Thus the addition of somatostatin increased the suppression of the hormonal response to cardiac surgery by sufentanil.\r"

Ten women received 600 mg of oral mifepristone and 10 women a placebo 24 h before abortion was induced in both groups, with extra-amniotic PGE2 instillation. Intrauterine pressure recordings demonstrated increased spontaneous uterine activity and increased sensitivity to PGE2 and ergometrine, but no change in oxytocin sensitivity after mifepristone treatment. There were no significant differences in PGE or PGF metabolite concentrations in peripheral maternal plasma over the 24-h study period after treatment between the mifepristone and placebo groups. The mean induction abortion interval in the mifepristone group was 512 (SD 321) min compared with 1128 (SD 606) min in the placebo group (P less than or equal to 0.02). The mechanism whereby mifepristone provokes enhanced uterine contractility and sensitivity to prostaglandins, with a reduction in abortion times, does not appear to be through endogenous production of PGE or PGF.\r"

Eight women at term after a normal pregnancy were studied before the onset of labour and within 60 min and 24 h after delivery. A comparison group of 16 healthy, non-pregnant women was investigated. The mean TAT concentration in normal pregnancies increased significantly in the second and third trimester compared with values in the first trimester and in non-pregnant women. In the group with hypertensive disorders during pregnancy TAT levels were significantly higher than in uncomplicated pregnancies. Within 60 min after delivery a distinct increase of TAT concentrations occurred compared to levels before the onset of labour but the levels had returned to normal by 24 h after delivery. Our findings suggest that an activation of the coagulation system occurs in normal pregnancy. A further activation takes place immediately after delivery. The significantly increased TAT levels in pregnancies with hypertensive disorders suggest a state of chronic disseminated intravascular coagulation leading to an enhanced consumption of and a decreased plasma concentration of antithrombin III.\r"

None of the women developed severe disseminated intravascular coagulation. The fetal outcome indicates that the prognosis for a surviving dichorionic twin is relatively good, with immaturity the main hazard. By contrast the surviving monochorionic twin has a poor prognosis with a high frequency of neurological damage. This damage is not related to intrapartum or neonatal problems and at present cannot be diagnosed before birth. There is no evidence that birth of the surviving twin by caesarean section will improve the prognosis. Early diagnosis of monochorionic twins and subsequent ultrasound follow up should identify fetal growth discrepancy and possible twin to twin transfusion requiring early delivery.\r"

The dosages were tapered off in accordance with a protocol, and we compared the number of months of successful therapy before the uveitis relapsed. The efficacy results, as expressed in a Kaplan-Meier curve, were in favour of cyclosporin. Owing to the small sample size, however, this difference did not reach statistical significance. The immunosuppressive effect of cyclosporin was not permanent, and in all but one patient the intraocular inflammation relapsed on reduction of dosage. Rather small cumulative doses of cyclosporin proved to be nephrotoxic, but subjective tolerability for cyclosporin was good.\r"

A single dose of 2% MK-927 induced a peak mean IOP decrease of 10.5 mmHg at 4.5 hours postdose. With compensation for diurnal variation, as determined by the prestudy diurnal pressure curve, the net peak mean reduction of IOP caused by MK-927 was 7.5 mmHg versus a corresponding net change of 1.4 mmHg in the contralateral placebo treated eye.

The intraocular infection was controlled by antibacterial drugs, though the visual acuity of the right eye was reduced to only light perception owing to heavy vitreous opacity and secondary cataract.

The sooner and more frequently the mice were injected with rhG-CSF after irradiation, the more enhanced the recovery of CFU-S in bone marrow was obtained on day 7. Twice-daily injections of rhG-CSF from day 0 to day 2 significantly enhanced the recovery of platelets and hematocrit, but two injections of rhG-CSF on only day 0 did not. Twice-daily injections of rhG-CSF from day 0 to day 6 enhanced the recovery of platelets more effectively than twice-daily injections of rhG-CSF from day 1 to day 7, and increased the survival of irradiated mice more effectively than any other examined administration schedules. Twice-daily injections of rhG-CSF from day 0 to day 6 were significantly effective in enhancing the survival of mice irradiated with 8.5-, 9.0-, and 9.5-Gy x-rays, although not effective after irradiation of 10.5-Gy x-rays.\r"

  ".W": "We investigated the effects of recombinant human granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (rGM-CSF) administered by the subcutaneous route, first alone and then alternating with azidothymidine (AZT), in leukopenic patients with severe human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Ten patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) or related disorders, five of whom could not tolerate conventional doses of AZT, were administered rGM-CSF subcutaneously for 12 days. They then were administered an alternating regimen using AZT for 1 week, followed by 5 days of subcutaneous rGM-CSF and 2 days without any medication. During the initial 12 days of GM-CSF administration, there was an increase in the mean white blood cell (WBC) value. In addition, rGM-CSF stimulated circulating monocytes as evidenced by an increase in superoxide anion production and expression of surface HLA-DR antigen. However, at the same time rGM-CSF increased the serum HIV p24 antigen in each of the six evaluable patients from 189 x/divided by 2.02 pg/mL (geometric mean x/divided by SEM) at entry to 375 x/divided by 2.11 pg/mL (P less than .05). During the subsequent period of alternating AZT and rGM-CSF treatment, serum HIV p24 antigen fell below the day 14 value in most patients, particularly after the weeks of AZT administration. The mean T4 cell value increased in patients who had not previously received AZT, but generally did not change in those who had prior AZT exposure. Hematologic toxicity appeared to be somewhat reduced compared with continuous full-dose AZT therapy, and two patients with previous AZT hematologic toxicity tolerated this alternating regimen for 25 weeks. Additional regimens simultaneously combining these two agents are worth exploring.\r"

  ".W": "Macrophage-derived granulomonopoietic enhancing activity (GM-EA) is a novel mediator that amplifies colony formation of myeloid progenitor cells (CFU-GM) in conjunction with colony-stimulating factors (CSFs), and is distinct from other hematopoietic synergizing factors such as interleukin (IL)-1, IL-4, and IL-6. In the present study, we try to ascertain whether or not there is a GM-EA-specific responsive myeloid progenitor cell population. Human bone marrow cells deleted of adherent cells and T lymphocytes were separated by velocity sedimentation into three subpopulations with respective sedimentation rates (millimeters per hour) of 7.4 +/- 0.4, 6.0 +/- 0.6, and 4.7 +/- 0.3. These subpopulations corresponded to the day 7 CFU-GM, day 14 CFU-GM, and the earlier myeloid progenitor cells, pre-CFU-GM, respectively. Pre-CFU-GM failed to respond to the colony-inducing effect of GM-CSF but could be stimulated by GM-EA alone to generate small clusters (5 to 25 cells) in soft agar after 14 days of incubation. Correspondingly, suspension preculture of the fractionated bone marrow cells also showed that only the progenitor cells with low sedimentation rate (4.7 mm/h) could be activated by GM-EA to generate CFU-GM. Taken together, our results suggest that the specific target cell of GM-EA is the pre-CFU-GM, and that GM-EA acts on these cells as a growth/maturation factor, but on the day 7 and day 14 CFU-GM as a synergistic growth factor.\r"

  ".W": "A novel human cell line, KMT-2, from umbilical cord blood cells was established based on the selection of cultures in the presence of recombinant human interleukin-3 (IL-3) and the sorting of cells with anti-My 10 antibody. Morphologic and cytochemical studies (peroxidase negative, Sudan-black negative, chloroacetate esterase negative, PAS positive, nonspecific esterase positive) and phenotyping (HLA-DR, My7 = CD13, My9 = CD33, My10 = CD34, MCS-2, LeuM1 positive, glycophorin A negative, and P2 negative) suggest that the KMT-2 cells are myelomonocytic cells, probably of immature progenitor origin. Besides IL-3, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor supported the growth of the KMT-2 cells, but IL-1 alpha, IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, and erythropoietin did not. IL-6 showed only slight activity. Binding studies with 125I-labeled recombinant human (rh) IL-3 indicated that IL-3 bound to a single class of high affinity receptors (approximately 4,000 receptors/cell) on KMT-2 cells with a kd of approximately 200 pmol/L. The chemical cross-linking assay demonstrated that radiolabeled hIL-3 bound three molecules with molecular masses of 170, 130, and 70 Kd. Present data suggest that the newly established human cell line will be a valuable tool for the biologic assay of hIL-3, and a model for biochemical studies of IL-3 receptors.\r"

A marrow cell population enriched for BFU-MK (CD34+ DR-) was obtained by monoclonal antibody labeling and fluorescence-activated cell sorting. CD34+DR- cells were assayed in a serum-depleted, fibrin clot culture system. Recombinant granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (rGM-CSF), recombinant interleukin-3 (rIL-3), and megakaryocyte colony-stimulating factor (MK-CSF), partially purified from human plasma, were each individually capable of promoting BFU-MK-derived colony formation. Recombinant erythropoietin, rG-CSF, rIL-4, rIL-6, and thrombocytopiesis stimulating factor, partially purified from human embryonic kidney cell conditioned media, had no stimulatory effect on BFU-MK-derived colony formation when added alone or in various combinations with either GM-CSF, IL-3, or MK-CSF, GM-CSF and IL-3, GM-CSF and MK-CSF, but not IL-3 and MK-CSF had additive actions in promoting BFU-MK-derived colony formation, rIL-1 alpha had no influence alone on BFU-MK cloning efficiency, but had a dose-dependent, synergistic effect with IL-3, but not with GM-CSF or MK-CSF. The synergistic relationship between IL-1 alpha and IL-3 was abrogated by addition of an IL-1 alpha neutralizing antibody but not by a GM-CSF neutralizing antiserum, suggesting that IL-1 alpha acts directly on the BFU-MK and not by stimulating marrow auxiliary cells to secondarily release additional cytokines. Information presented here indicates that the regulatory influence, acting on the different stages of megakaryocyte development, are stage-specific and accomplished by multiple cytokines.\r"

  ".W": "Cyclic hematopoiesis in gray collie dogs is a stem cell disease in which abnormal regulation of cell production in the bone marrow causes cyclic fluctuations of blood cell counts. In vitro studies demonstrated that recombinant human granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), interleukin-3 (IL-3), and granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) all stimulated increases in colony formation by canine bone marrow progenitor cells. Based on these results, gray collie dogs were then treated with recombinant human (rh) GM-CSF, IL-3, or G-CSF subcutaneously to test the hypothesis that pharmacologic doses of one of these hematopoietic growth factors could alter cyclic production of cells. When recombinant canine G-CSF became available, it was tested over a range of doses. In vivo rhIL-3 had no effect on the recurrent neutropenia but was associated with eosinophilia, rhGM-CSF caused neutrophilia and eosinophilia but cycling of hematopoiesis persisted. However, rhG-CSF caused neutrophilia, prevented the recurrent neutropenia and, in the two animals not developing antibodies to rhG-CSF, obliterated periodic fluctuation of monocyte, eosinophil, reticulocyte, and platelet counts. Recombinant canine G-CSF increased the nadir neutrophil counts and amplitude of fluctuations at low doses (1 micrograms/kg/d) and eliminated all cycling of cell counts at high doses (5 and 10 micrograms/kg/d). These data suggest significant differences in the actions of these growth factors and imply a critical role for G-CSF in the homeostatic regulation of hematopoiesis.\r"

  ".W": "The localization of five integrin subunit proteins was studied in human erythroleukemia (HEL) cells spreading on various culture substrata in the presence of 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) and the absence of serum. The cells readily adhered on fibronectin, but TPA was needed for adherence on vitronectin and for the spreading of the cells on both substrata. Indirect immunofluorescence microscopy showed that in the spread cells cultured on vitronectin or fibronectin for 2 hours, beta 1, beta 3, alpha 5, and alpha IIb integrin subunits were localized at focal adhesions as identified by talin-immunoreactivity. The alpha v integrin immunoreactivity was initially found at the focal adhesions when the cells were cultured on vitronectin, but was also found later in cells cultured on fibronectin. The alpha IIb integrin immunoreactivity disappeared from focal adhesions within 24 hours. The alpha 5 and beta 1 integrin immunoreactivities disappeared from the focal adhesions in cells cultured on vitronectin, but not in cells cultured on fibronectin. When the cells were plated on glass substratum in the presence of TPA, they spread much slower than on vitronectin or fibronectin, but some cells showed focal adhesions after only 8 hours in culture. In this case, the alpha v and beta 3 integrin subunits were found at focal adhesions. After TPA treatment, HEL cells deposited thrombospondin-immunoreactive material onto their culture substratum, but synthesis of fibronectin, vitronectin, fibrinogen, or von Willebrand factor was not detected. Thus, the results suggest that TPA would activate several integrin receptors in HEL cells and also stimulate the secretion of thrombospondin, which might be used as an adhesion ligand for the integrin vitronectin receptor alpha v/beta 3 complex.\r"

Fc receptor expression was measured by FACS analysis of cells stained with monoclonal antibody Leu11b for FcRIII and IV-3 for FcRII. \"Well\" preterm neonates displayed reduced FcRIII, 51.05 +/- 2.0 (mean fluorescence channel +/- SE) when compared with term neonates, 69.24 +/- 5.5 and adult controls, 71.83 +/- 3.0. \"Stressed\" preterm neonates with severe respiratory distress syndrome or septicemia had a further downregulation of FcRIII, 32.67 +/- 3.0 and 35.75 +/- 1.8, respectively, associated with grossly abnormal cellular fluorescence distribution. In well preterm neonates, expression of FcRIII improved to adult levels during the first two postnatal weeks, suggesting a postnatal maturation of function. Stressed neonates had signs of partial neutrophil activation (increased Mac-1 expression and chemotactic ability), leading us to propose that the further downregulation of FcRIII may be due to receptor shedding in vivo by partially activated cells. FcRII expression was found to be equivalent to adult levels in both well preterm and stressed neonates. Reduced neutrophil FcRIII expression may provide some explanation for the reported abnormalities of phagocytosis and bacterial killing in preterm neonates.\r"

Small quantities of G-kinase were found in the cytoskeletal-enriched fraction of neutrophil lysates as detected by Western blots using a polyclonal antibody raised against bovine aorta G-kinase. Immunofluorescence microscopy demonstrated in adherent neutrophils that G-kinase was localized diffusely within the cytoplasm, at the microtubule organizing center, and in the euchromatin of the nucleus. Because cyclic GMP is implicated as a modulator of neutrophil chemotaxis, G-kinase localization was investigated in neutrophils activated with N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (fMLP). fMLP stimulated transient focal changes in G-kinase localization that coincided with transient changes in cell shape. G-kinase translocated over a period of 5 minutes from diffuse staining of the cytosol to filaments within the uropod of polarized cells (1 minute), to bundles of filaments associated with loss of cell polarity (2.5 minutes), and finally to more intense staining of the nuclear euchromatin (5 minutes). Optical sectioning of neutrophils by confocal laser scanning microscopy confirmed that G-kinase was restricted to specific sub-cellular compartments during cell activation. This transient localization of G-kinase was disrupted by cytoskeletal inhibitors and was augmented by 8-Br-cyclic GMP. These data provide evidence for the first time that G-kinase plays a physiologic role in human neutrophils, and support the concept of compartmentalization of cyclic nucleotides during neutrophil activation.\r"

In the direct comparisons reported here, the S5 glycoprotein (gp) was found to have structural homology to CD44 that in humans has been implicated in adhesive interactions of one type of effector cell, the lymphocyte. The S5 antigen and gp90Hermes-1 exhibited codistribution on canine peripheral blood cells. Both S5 and Hermes-1 (anti-CD44) MoAbs recognized 90-Kd species in radioimmune precipitations of 125I surface-labeled canine peripheral blood lymphocytes and bone marrow cells. Competitive antibody binding experiments showed that the epitope detected by S5 was distinct from that bound by Hermes-1 but overlapped with those defined by two other known anti-CD44 reagents, IM7 and Hutch-1. Sequential immunoprecipitation with S5 and Hermes-1 indicated that the two antibodies recognize the same or overlapping subsets of membrane gps. Tryptic digestion of S5 and anti-CD44 immunoprecipitates generated two major iodinated peptides of 27 and 35 Kd in both cases, a further indication of structural homology. Similarly, after N-glycanase digestion, S5 and CD44 immunoprecipitates were resolved to a single 68-Kd species. These findings suggest that CD44-mediated adhesive events may affect the fate of transplanted hematopoietic cells. The previous implications of this gp in T-lymphocyte activation and lymphocyte adhesion to endothelium thus provide useful paradigms to analyze its function in the bone marrow transplant setting.\r"

Ten animals were treated with 100 micrograms rhG-CSF/kg/d from days 1 through 10 after TBI. Results were compared with those of historical control of 14 dogs not administered rhG-CSF. Neither group of dogs received GVHD prophylaxis. The median time to recovery of 1,000 neutrophils/mm3 was 8 days for dogs administered rhG-CSF compared with 14 days in controls (logrank test: P less than .03). The median time to reach 100 monocytes/mm3 was 17 days in G-CSF-treated dogs compared with 49 days in controls (P less than .002). The median time to attain 500 lymphocytes/mm3 was 15 days versus 31 days, respectively (P less than .01). The median time to reach 20,000 platelets/mm3 was 26 versus 20 days (P = .68). Graft failure occurred in 1 of 10 G-CSF-treated dogs versus 2 of 14 controls (two-tailed Fisher's exact test: P = 1.00). GVHD was seen in 4 of 9 rhG-CSF-treated dogs compared with 1 of 12 controls (P = .12). Two G-CSF-treated dogs died of GVHD versus none of the controls (P = .17). No unusual toxicities were seen in dogs receiving rhG-CSF. In summary, rhG-CSF significantly accelerated recovery of neutrophils, monocytes, and lymphocytes after DLA-identical littermate marrow transplantation without altering platelet recovery. Graft failure was not seen more often than in controls, but there was a trend toward an increased incidence of GVHD.\r"

  ".W": "The significance of indeterminate screening antibody test for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) serology is still difficult to evaluate, especially in low-risk populations. One hundred twenty-seven blood donors with an initially reactive screening test for HIV antibodies were enrolled in this study. The sera of 95 of these blood donors were reactive on repetition of the test, and none had detectable circulating p24 antigen. Western blot (WB) analysis of the repeatedly reactive sera was as follows: 9 positive, 31 indeterminate, and 55 negative. One of the blood donors with indeterminate WB later presented a seroconversion. On subsequent control 3 to 12 months later, the sera from donors with indeterminate or negative WB did not present any parameters that may indicate a seroconversion. DNA was purified from citrated blood collected from the 127 blood donors at the time of the initial antibody screening. Five micrograms of each DNA sample corresponding to 7 x 10(5) nucleated white blood cells was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in the presence of oligonucleotides (primers) corresponding to a highly conserved segment of the pol gene. The detection of amplified DNA was achieved by dot blot and Southern blot using appropriate 32P-labeled oligonucleotides. Ten DNA samples were positive, 9 corresponded to blood donors with a positive HIV serology, and 1 to the blood donor who later presented a seroconversion. These results confirm the sensitivity of the PCR for the diagnosis of HIV infection; they also suggest that repetition of the serology at 3- to 12-month intervals is a valuable procedure for the control of HIV infection status in blood donors.\r"

Allocation to chiropractic or hospital management by minimisation to establish groups for analysis of results according to initial referral clinic, length of current episode, history, and severity of back pain. Patients were followed up for up two years. SETTING--Chiropractic and hospital outpatient clinics in 11 centres. PATIENTS--741 Patients aged 18-65 who had no contraindications to manipulation and who had not been treated within the past month. INTERVENTIONS--Treatment at the discretion of the chiropractors, who used chiropractic manipulation in most patients, or of the hospital staff, who most commonly used Maitland mobilisation or manipulation, or both. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Changes in the score on the Oswestry pain disability questionnaire and in the results of tests of straight leg raising and lumbar flexion. RESULTS--Chiropractic treatment was more effective than hospital outpatient management, mainly for patients with chronic or severe back pain. A benefit of about 7% points on the Oswestry scale was seen at two years. The benefit of chiropractic treatment became more evident throughout the follow up period. Secondary outcome measures also showed that chiropractic was more beneficial. CONCLUSIONS--For patients with low back pain in whom manipulation is not contraindicated chiropractic almost certainly confers worthwhile, long term benefit in comparison with hospital outpatient management. The benefit is seen mainly in those with chronic or severe pain. Introducing chiropractic into NHS practice should be considered.\r"

  ".W": "Accessory cell populations in normal and diseased synovial tissue have been reanalyzed following the development of the monoclonal antibody, EBM11, directed against the CD68 epitope which is expressed by macrophages in all locations so far examined. Previous studies used as a macrophage marker the monoclonal antibody RFD7 which binds only a proportion of (mature) macrophages. Using double indirect immunofluorescence, normal and rheumatoid synovial samples were examined for the presence of cells which bind the putative dendritic cell marker, RFD1, in conjunction with either RFD7 or EBM11. RFD1 positive cells were found in five of 40 normal synovia. Of these cells, 30-35% were negative for RFD7 or EBM11 and, when closely apposed to T-lymphocytes, showed a typical interdigitating morphology. In contrast, all of ten rheumatoid synovia contained RFD1 positive cells; the extent of double labelling with macrophage markers varied with the position of the cells in the tissue. As expected, EBM11 stained a larger number of cells with macrophage morphology than RFD7. The combination of RFD1 and EBM11 appears to be a useful method for identifying interdigitating dendritic cells in connective tissue, these cells being characterized by positive RFD1 and negative EBM11 binding. On this criterion, interdigitating dendritic cells were plentiful in rheumatoid synovium and present, albeit infrequently, in normal synovium.\r"

The group receiving methylprednisolone had more rapid disease improvement. This advantage persisted for up to 12 weeks, although by 24 weeks both groups exhibited similar benefits due to continued improvement in the group treated with gold alone. Withdrawals secondary to gold-induced side-effects occurred later in the steroid group (median time to withdrawal: 15 weeks steroid; 4.5 weeks placebo, P less than 0.05), and there were fewer withdrawals due to a lack of effect in the steroid group (one steroid versus three placebo, P NS). We conclude that glucocorticoids given as intermittent, intramuscular depot injections have a significant short term benefit which can be maintained by concomitant administration of intramuscular gold.\r"

  ".W": "Forty-six comparative studies were performed on 41 patients with hyperthyroidism. Clinically these comprised two groups: those with Graves' disease, and those with multinodular goitre. All patients underwent an ultrasound examination and positron emission tomography (PET) using 124I, then gamma camera pinhole imaging following their 131I therapy administration. Although the 131I pinhole imaging was not performed for diagnostic purposes, there was good correlation (78% agreement) between it and 124I PET in determining relative lobe size. Hence either imaging modality could be used as an indicator of the relative radiation dose delivered to each thyroid lobe at a macroscopic level. In terms of gland morphology the PET images corresponded well to the high resolution ultrasound images (78% agreement), unlike the pinhole images which correlated poorly (only 28% agreement). The results showed that PET imaging gives better anatomical and physiological detail than 131I pinhole imaging. In 77% of cases where the pinhole image showed a uniform distribution of radioisotope, the improved spatial resolution of the PET images revealed non-homogeneous distribution indicating a non-uniform distribution of radiation dose. Since all dosimetry calculations are based on the assumption of uniform distribution of radioiodine, this non-uniformity could possibly have important consequences in the outcome of radioiodine therapy in thyrotoxicosis.\r"

However, VCMG requires bladder catheterization and voiding in public which often leads to inhibition of sphincter relaxation. For this reason the urinary flow rate measurement performed in private is more representative of the true voiding pattern. The ultrasound cystodynamogram (USCD) evaluates the bladder capacity, mean and maximum flow rates, flow pattern and post-micturition residual. The diagnostic capability of USCD was studied in 116 consecutive cases 46 of whom had also had VCMG. Comparison of the data obtained using both techniques revealed no significant difference. USCD has proved to be accurate, safe and reproducible and is of particular value in patient follow-up.\r"

Classically choledochal cysts have been divided into types and subtypes based on the configuration of common bile duct dilatation; however, this simplified information is misleading since surgical management is dependent on the exact extent of intrahepatic and extrahepatic biliary abnormalities. The pre-operative ultrasound examination must be meticulous to provide enough pertinent anatomic details. Much of the intrahepatic anatomy is not visualized at surgery nor on the operative cholangiograms where reflux of contrast into the intrahepatic ducts may not be consistently achieved.\r"

  ".W": "The effect of the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor Captopril on the severity of radiation-induced epilation and moist desquamation and the incidence of skin tumours was determined for up to 52 weeks in male rats. The irradiation consisted of a range of single doses (0, 10, 20, 30 Gy) of 60Co gamma rays to a 3.5 cm2 right hemithorax port. Half of each radiation dose group consumed control powdered chow, and half consumed chow containing Captopril (50 mg/kg/day) continuously after irradiation. There were time- and radiation-dose-dependent increases in all three skin reactions. Rats exposed to 10 Gy exhibited a mild and transient epilation, but no moist desquamation or neoplasia in the radiation port. In animals exposed to 30 Gy, however, epilation began at 2 weeks after irradiation, reached a peak at approximately 7 weeks, then persisted essentially unchanged through 52 weeks. Captopril had no significant effect on the epilation reaction. Two waves of moist desquamation were observed after 30 Gy. The first appeared at 3 weeks after irradiation, reached a peak from 6-10 weeks, then subsided partially but significantly from 12-26 weeks. The second wave of moist desquamation began at 26-28 weeks, often was ulcerative, and occasionally was accompanied by the appearance of tumours in the irradiated volume. Captopril significantly (p less than 0.05) reduced the severity of both phases of the moist desquamation reaction after 30 Gy, and reduced the percentage of animals exhibiting the most severe desquamation score (involving 50% of the radiation port). Of particular interest was the observation that Captopril also reduced the incidence of tumours. Of the 14 tumours detected, all were malignant (fibrosarcomas, squamous cell carcinomas), and only three (p less than 0.05) occurred in rats receiving Captopril. Multiple tumours (three cases), tumours induced by 20 Gy (three cases), and tumours appearing before 6 months (one case) were observed only in rats consuming control diet, never in Captopril-treated animals. Animals which developed tumours in the second 6 months post-irradiation exhibited significantly more severe moist desquamation during the first 6 months than did the tumour-free members of their treatment group. Thus Captopril, known to ameliorate acute lung damage in irradiated rats, also reduces chronic benign and malignant skin reactions in the radiation treatment field.\r"

  ".W": "The use of intensive therapy together with transplantation of marrow from a suitable donor is the only established curative treatment for patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). However, marrow transplantation is hazardous, costly and applicable to relatively few patients. Therefore, we evaluated the results and limitations of marrow transplantation for CML and discussed new treatment strategies. We decided to select a limited number of papers that focused on the relevant issues rather than to undertake an exhaustive comparison of treatment results from different centres. Patients with CML in the chronic phase who receive marrow from a sibling with the same human leukocyte antigen type can expect to have a long-term disease-free survival rate of 50%. However, the procedure is associated with a mortality rate of 30%, mainly because of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and interstitial pneumonitis. Moreover, because of the requirements for age and histocompatibility only 10% of patients with chronic-phase CML are currently eligible. Transplantation earlier in the chronic phase (within 1 year after diagnosis), the use of marrow from matched, unrelated donors and the development of improved methods for reducing the incidence of GVHD all hold promise. In addition, the preliminary results of intensive therapy followed by transplantation with cultured autologous marrow have been encouraging. If further progress is to be made, continued optimism coupled with carefully developed and executed studies will be necessary.\r"

  ".W": "Over the years, PTCA has been proved a safe and effective therapy for single-vessel CAD. Given the record of favorable results for single-vessel angioplasty, the extension of angioplasty to multivessel CAD soon followed. The successful application of PTCA to multivessel disease has been facilitated by developments in balloon, guidewire, and guide catheter technology. Success rates have been satisfactory, and complications have remained acceptable. Furthermore, as an outgrowth of an understanding of the mechanism and effect of PTCA, guidelines have been developed to aid case selection. As emphasized earlier, these guidelines should weigh heavily in deciding whether to select PTCA as a treatment modality. Presently, in our opinion, PTCA has not yet completely displaced surgery for multivessel CAD. Surgical standby is required for safe PTCA, because emergency surgery can be lifesaving and limit myocardial infarction after failed angioplasty. It is doubtful that surgery will ever relinquish its position as the treatment of choice for left main coronary artery disease. Nor will elective surgery find wide application in single-vessel disease. Whether one mode of revascularization will emerge as the most efficacious for multivessel disease related to long-term survival, limitation of cardiac events, and cost will be addressed in the analysis of the ongoing randomized trials of surgery versus angioplasty. Andreas Gruentzig established that it was possible to work within the coronary artery in an alert and comfortable patient. Interventional cardiology has experienced rapid technologic growth. Many patients formerly treated with bypass surgery can be managed effectively with angioplasty. If effective bail-out methods for acute closure are proven effective and restenosis is limited to a small percentage of patients, angioplasty in some form will further displace CABG. Until those ultimate goals are achieved, the value of angioplasty compared with bypass surgery must rest with current local experience and the eagerly awaited results of randomized trials.\r"

  ".U": "90335908\r", 
  ".W": "There is a natural reluctance among clinicians to recommend surgery in asymptomatic patients with cardiac disease and in patients with stenotic disease of the mitral and aortic valves; this instinct will mislead us very rarely. However, among patients with chronic volume overload of the LV, this rule-of-thumb does not always apply. For truly asymptomatic patients with severe MR who clearly have normal LV function, continued medical therapy with serial monitoring of LV dynamics is a prudent alternative to the small risk of corrective surgery. However, the major challenge in addressing this problem is the definition and detection of LV dysfunction in chronic MR. Thus, for MR patients with questionable impairment of myocardial function (generally those with an SEF between 0.55 and 0.70), an examination of chamber dimensions and particularly stress-shortening relations may be necessary to detect early LV dysfunction. Should LV dysfunction be identified or should serial studies indicate an adverse trend in LV performance, a strong case can be made for proceeding with surgery. Patients with an SEF of less than 0.55 must be assumed to have LV dysfunction and analogous data from patients with chronic AR suggest that a satisfactory surgical result may be achieved if the duration of LV dysfunction is brief. Those patients with chronic MR whose disease is likely to be amenable to mitral valve repair rather than valve replacement deserve a lower threshold for corrective surgery.\r"

The mechanism of dilatation and hemodynamic results of transventricular mitral commissurotomy and of mitral balloon valvuloplasty are similar. Both techniques should be considered palliative. Because the balloon catheter technique can achieve hemodynamic results similar to surgery and may delay the trauma and expense of surgery, it can be offered to patients as a primary treatment for relief of symptomatic mitral stenosis.\r"

Patients with asymptomatic left ventricular systolic dysfunction are at jeopardy for progressive deterioration. Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and, possibly, direct vasodilators may prevent progression. In initiating vasodilator therapy, ACE inhibitors usually should be the agent of choice. Exceptions may be patients with ongoing ischemia in whom nitrates are an appropriate alternative and those who are poor candidates because of hypotension, renal insufficiency, or hyperkalemia.\r"

  ".U": "90335917\r", 
  ".W": "From the foregoing discussion, it becomes apparent that although noninvasive risk stratification is a reasonable approach to assessment of patients following an uncomplicated myocardial infarction, the performance of early cardiac catheterization and angiography on nearly all such patients is not unreasonable and may in fact be the most practical approach. The basis for this rationalization may be summarized as follows: 1. Many subgroups will need early catheterization anyway a. Myocardial infarction complicated by recurrent ischemia, heart failure, or complex ventricular arrhythmias b. Patients receiving thrombolytic treatment c. \"Young\" patients (less than 50 years old?) d. \"Older\" patients (over ages 65 to 70?) in otherwise good medical condition e. Patients unable to exercise f. Patients with abnormal or inconclusive noninvasive test results (approximately 70 percent of patients) 2. Cardiac catheterization and angiography as a single test provides the two most powerful prognostic variables following myocardial infarction, namely, the extent of coronary artery disease and residual left ventricular function. This knowledge is reassuring to both physician and patient and allows for planning of optimal long-term management. 3. Certain limitations exist in noninvasive risk assessment strategies. 4. This approach need not be significantly more costly, if all tests are used wisely. The major risk inherent in the definition of the extent of coronary artery disease in all survivors of acute myocardial infarction might be the performance of unnecessary revascularization procedures (percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty or coronary bypass surgery). The burden rests with the individual clinician to (1) collect all useful and necessary data; (2) assess reliability and accuracy of various tests available at one's own institution; (3) avoid performing unnecessary and repetitive tests; (4) interpret the data in the proper context; and (5) counsel patients appropriately, correctly, and judiciously about their prognosis and therapeutic options. In this manner, all patients who might benefit appropriately from revascularization can be discovered early and offered this therapeutic option. Other patients can also be managed more appropriately; for example, those who are truly at very low risk (normal left ventricular function and either normal coronary arteries or \"mild\" coronary artery disease). However, it is most important to avoid unnecessary revascularization procedures. Although this discussion has focused on noninvasive and invasive testing following myocardial infarction, it is necessary to emphasize that comprehensive management of coronary artery disease and its complications should not be neglected in these patients; for example, control or amelioration of risk factors for coronary artery disease is mandatory in all these patients, and in their families as well.\r"

Single longitudinal tears typically in chronic knees with peripheral white rims of 5 mm and greater may have better reliability with use of the fascia sheath. The sheath is indicated in complex tears including flaps and radial splits. A structured rehabilitation program is necessary for improved reliability of meniscus healing. Tears out in the white substance are significantly more sensitive to rapid return to weight bearing than the peripheral tears or the ligament-reconstruction portions of the procedure. Contraindications to meniscus repair would include short tears (less than 10 mm), stable partial thickness tears with less than 50% of the vertical height of the meniscus torn, and shallow radial tears of 3 mm depth or less.

They believed that there was a direct relationship between the degree of degenerative change and the amount of meniscus removed. McGinty et al reported early return to function with decreased morbidity and decreased complication rates after partial meniscectomy; this was compared to both open and arthroscopic techniques for total meniscectomy. Jackson and Dandy have documented improved results of partial meniscectomy when compared with total meniscectomy in an intermediate range (average 5 to 10 years) follow-up study. Earlier studies by the senior author, Hamberg et al, and Cassidy and Shaffer have documented that meniscal repairs can heal. The more recent follow-up study of DeHaven et al has documented that repaired menisci not only heal satisfactorily but that durability and biomechanical function can also be maintained. Of course, long-term review of these same patients will be necessary to prove that successful repair will prevent the degenerative changes noted in knees following meniscectomy.\r"

Although there are multiple techniques to gain better access to the various compartments in a truly tight knee, most of the problems in obtaining maximum visualization and instrumentation to the posterior aspects of the medial or lateral meniscus can usually be solved by adhering to a strict surgical technique that attempts to control the multiple variables encountered during arthroscopic surgery. These include the use of a tourniquet, leg holder, maximum distention of the knee provided by a large inflow cannula with large-bore tubing connected to 3-L bags, and an 18-gauge needle as a predecessor to the larger arthroscopic instruments. Of utmost importance is establishing the correct portal for the arthroscope, and it is time well spent at the beginning of the surgical procedure to verify the proper location of the arthroscope and not simply insert the arthroscope \"a thumb-breadth above the joint line.\" Once these variables have been controlled, one can usually visualize and perform arthroscopic surgery on most meniscal lesions with minimal scuffing to the articular surfaces.\r"

  ".W": "The appropriate treatment of meniscal pathology, in the knee with an associated cruciate insufficiency, is dependent on a thorough understanding of the patient's clinical symptom complex, activity level, and the demands that that individual places on his or her knee. In the individual whose lifestyle places high demands on the knee, there is a high failure rate of meniscal repair in the presence of cruciate insufficiency. This failure rate can be obviated by either concomitant stabilization of the anterior cruciate or by significant activity modification or bracing of the knee. In those individuals in whom stabilization is not indicated because of a low demand on the knee, meniscal surgery may be performed as an isolated procedure with anticipated good results. That includes both resection of nonrepairable tears for the knee that presents primarily as locking as well as meniscal repair of appropriate lesions. In the knee with posterior cruciate insufficiency, there is greater concern about the development of degenerative changes, especially in the medial compartment. The surgeon should be aggressive in attempts at preservation of the meniscus in this setting. Posterior cruciate stabilization is less predictable given the present state of the art. However, it is recommended in the face of progressive degenerative changes. Additional considerations include appropriately timed osteotomy, especially in the face of combination injuries to the posterior cruciate and posterolateral corner as well as in future the possibility of meniscal allograft transplantation.\r"

They usually present as joint-line pain, swelling, or both in young adult men, and are often associated with meniscal tears. The exact etiology of meniscal cysts is unknown. A myxoid degenerative process is identified histologically. There is often a history of precedent trauma. Diagnosis is often suspected clinically and can be confirmed by arthrogram, CT, or MRI when necessary. Conservative treatment in the patient with few symptoms is recommended. Should the cyst become significantly symptomatic, it is necessary to treat the meniscal pathology to prevent a cyst recurrence. At the present time it is our recommendation that this be done by arthroscopically resecting the meniscus back to normal meniscus and either aspirating and injecting the cyst with steroid or local cyst excision if the aspiration and injection fails. If no meniscal tear is documented at arthroscopy, exploration and excision of the cyst are recommended.\r"

Other signs have value in predicting the gross stability of a cementless femoral component. The authors have determined the specificity and sensitivity of the signs for osseointegration in cases in which the histologic fixation has been confirmed after implant removal. The authors have also determined the specificity and sensitivity of the signs for gross implant stability in cases in which the stability has been confirmed at reoperation. Statistical methods were used to determine a numeric value for each of these roentgenographic signs, and these values were combined into a score. The score was divided into fixation by osseointegration and mechanical implant stability. The two scores were then combined into an overall score. When signs of osseointegration were present, the implant was always stable, and the overall scores were the highest. When signs of osseointegration were absent, the mechanical stability varied, and the scores were lower. A neutral or slightly negative score correlated with failed osseointegration but secondary successful implant stabilization. A very low negative score correlated with gross implant instability. To confirm the validity of the scoring system, the two-year postoperative score was determined for 1005 cases in which the clinical outcome was known. A strong correlation between the presence of symptoms and a low score confirmed the value of the scoring system for diagnosing implant loosening as the cause of symptoms. As a second test, the two-year and five-year postoperative results were compared in the same patients. A high two-year score correlated with durable implant stability through five years. A low two-year score correlated with a higher incidence of late symptomatic loosening.\r"

  ".W": "The development of medical education standards and state licensure requirements occurred simultaneously in the 1900s. The result was that annual state licensure became the physician's certification. Eventually, the explosion of scientific knowledge due to hospital-based clinical practices and stimulation from national societies led to specialization within medicine. Primary specialty boards were organized in the 1930s to issue credentials and define qualifications for specialists. Just as licensure became the certification of a physician, primary boards became the certification of a physician specialist. Certification has become progressively more important in relationship to individual patients, national societies, hospitals, and third-party carriers. Recertification is the recognition by a primary board of a diplomate's continuing qualifications. The majority of primary boards have plans to institute recertification in order to evaluate pertinent cognitive knowledge of a diplomate and to respond to inadequate ongoing peer review. The expansion of scientific and technical knowledge, which led to specialization in the 1930s, inevitably has led to subspecialization. Orthopedic surgeons are using a wide range of fellowships, especially those just completing their residency education. The first certificate of added qualifications for orthopedics was in surgery of the hand.\r"

Over the past 72 years, 23 such boards have been approved and now issue 31 different types of general specialty certificates and 57 types of subspecialty credentials. For 50 years, the American Board of Medical Specialties has encouraged a system of recertification to demonstrate that the certified specialist has maintained skill and has incorporated the new knowledge associated with advancing medical science. Presently, 17 of the 23 boards are committed to time-limited certificates requiring recertification every seven to ten years, and others are currently planning such a process. New methods of performance assessment are being used for recertification processes. In addition to recertification, the other major change in specialty credentialing is the number of subspecialty certificates sought and authorized. The numbers have increased dramatically during the past 20 years and reflect the advances in science as well as new styles of practice. As a consequence, some specialties are moving toward accreditation without certification to improve training, even if there is no authorized type of certification. Another consequence of subspecialty proliferation is concern about fragmentation of medical care and its effect on the costs of health care.\r"

Both basic and acidic FGF exert similar biologic effects on a wide range of mesoderm- and neuroectoderm-derived cells, acting both as morphogens and mitogens. In addition, basic FGF has been shown to act as a ventrovegetalizing factor, inducing, at the midblastulae stage, mesoderm formation from animal pole cells destined to form ectodermal structures. This primordial role explains the wide variety of tissues, ranging from the central and peripheral nervous system to the vascular system, that are affected by FGF during the late embryonic, neonatal, and adult phases of development.\r"

The program is based on kinematic, biomechanical, and kinesiologic factors as they pertain to ACL function. The program is divided into five phases. The early phases, zero to 12 weeks, are intended to control translational forces across the ACL and to allow necessary time for ligament revascularization and soft-tissue healing. During this period, isometric and isotonic training of the hamstrings and quadriceps muscle groups in a restricted active arc of motion is permitted. Passive motion is encouraged, and progressive weight bearing is allowed. Conditioning of the upper body as well as the nonsurgical lower limb is stressed. During the advanced phases, 12-31 weeks, isotonic muscle training continues throughout a full range of motion. Greater strength, coordination, and endurance to achieve dynamic stability of the knee, preparing the patient for unrestricted activity, are stressed. Approximately 52 weeks of active rehabilitation after ACL reconstruction surgery are usually required to return to a preinjury level of function.\r"

The operated but nonimplanted left tibiae served as controls. The animals were killed after four months. The membrane surrounding the implant area was harvested aseptically and grown in tissue culture. The supernatants were assayed for prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) via radioimmunoassay. Bulk cement specimens produced on average 12.39 +/- 4.11 ng PGE2 on the right experimental side and 12.29 +/- 3.56 ng PGE2 on the left control side (not statistically different). Cement powder specimens produced 8.82 +/- 1.64 ng PGE2 on the right experimental side, which was statistically different from 4.21 +/- 0.88 ng PGE2 produced on the left control side. The ratio of PGE2 values for the right divided by the left side and the arithmetic difference between right and left sides were significantly higher in the particle group compared with the bulk group. Small, undigestable cement particles may be phagocytosed by foreign-body giant cells and histiocytes and then extruded into the extracellular compartment, along with substances such as PGE2. PGE2 has been implicated as the biologic mechanism for stimulating the bone lysis associated with prosthetic loosening.\r"

We have used the population pharmacokinetics model as implemented by the computer program NONMEM to study the distribution of zidovudine in a large number of patients who have AIDS-related complex and who are therefore at an earlier stage of immunosuppression than subjects in other studies. We confirm a clearance of drug identical to that seen by traditional methods but a larger volume of distribution than estimated previously in patients with AIDS.

In this study, we examined the effects of CL 277,082, N-(2,4-difluorophenyl)-N-(4-neopentylbenzyl)-N-(n-heptyl)urea, an ACAT inhibitor, on cholesterol metabolism in humans. Eight healthy male volunteers were given a placebo for 14 days, followed by 750 mg/day CL 277,082 for 20 days in a single-blind, crossover design. Subjects were studied in a hospital research unit and were fed strictly controlled diets. Cholesterol absorption was measured by the dual isotope method during the final week of both the placebo and the drug phases. Sterol balance was also assessed during these two periods by measuring cholesterol intake, and fecal neutral and acidic sterol excretion rates. Plasma lipids and lipoproteins were measured at the end of each period. The drug was well tolerated and produced no detectable clinical or laboratory side effects. Cholesterol absorption, sterol excretion rates, and plasma lipoprotein levels were all unaffected by treatment. We conclude that CL 277,082 may not interfere with ACAT activity or cholesterol absorption in humans at the doses given under the conditions tested in this study.\r"

After recovery from anesthesia, ALI was induced with oleic acid (0.08 ml/kg). Twenty-four hours later, the animals were sedated and placed in a sling. The pHa and blood gas tensions were measured. The animals were placed supine and were given inhalation anesthesia to facilitate tracheal intubation. A polyethylene catheter was placed slightly distal to the tracheal tube outlet to measure tracheal pressure (PT). Intubated rabbits were repositioned in the sling and were given either zero end-expiratory pressure (ZEEP) or 5 cm H2O CPAP, alternately. After the animals had breathed room air for 60 min, pHa and blood gas tensions were again measured, and PT was recorded. Animals were extubated, but the PT catheter was left in place. Data were collected again 60 min later, the catheter was removed, and the animals were returned to their cages. Forty-eight hours after onset of ALI, the protocol was repeated.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".U": "90336470\r", 
  ".W": "After failure of external defibrillation, return of cardiac activity with spontaneous circulation is contingent on rapid and effective reversal of myocardial ischemia. Closed-chest cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) evolved about 30 years ago and was almost universally implemented by both professional providers and lay bystanders because of its technical simplicity and noninvasiveness. However, there is growing concern since the limited hemodynamic efficacy of precordial compression accounts for a disappointingly low success rate; especially so if there is a delay of more than 3 minutes before resuscitation is started. There is also increasing concern with the lack of objective hemodynamic measurements currently available for the assessment and quantitation of the effectiveness of resuscitation efforts. Accordingly, the resuscitation procedure proceeds without confirmation that it increases systemic and myocardial blood flows to levels that would be likely to restore spontaneous circulation. Continuous monitoring of end-tidal carbon dioxide (PETCO2) now appears to be a practical measurement which provides a noninvasive quantitative indication of both systemic blood flow and coronary perfusion pressure. Consequently, PETCO2 predicts the likelihood of successful resuscitation and guides the operator who may modify the technique of precordial compression to improve systemic and myocardial perfusion. Among the large polypharmacy for cardiac resuscitation, only alpha-adrenergic agents (which increase coronary perfusion pressure) and especially epinephrine are of proven benefit. Neither buffer agents nor calcium salts appear to improve outcome except under unique conditions. To the contrary, there is increasing awareness of adverse effects of pharmacologic interventions such that they may hinder the return of viable myocardial and cerebral function. This has constrained the routine use of all drugs except for the use of alpha-adrenergic agonists. More invasive interventions by which blood flow is restored such as open-chest cardiac massage or extra-corporeal pump oxygenation (ECPO) are consistently more effective than conventional CPR. Experimentally, both methods promptly restore systemic and myocardial perfusion to viable levels and thereby increase the likelihood that spontaneous circulation is restored even after prolonged cardiac arrest or failure of conventional CPR.\r"

Tamoxifen was administered during the 1st month of therapy to prevent flare-up of the disease during the estrogen surge. Fifteen women had a decrease of their laparoscopy scores translated into an improvement in the stage of disease, whereas in 12 others, the decrease in their scores was not enough to allow a change of disease stage. The 2nd laparoscopy was not performed in 7 women. Medical oophorectomy, after daily injection of the LH-RH agonist (LH-RH-a), was accompanied by low levels of circulating estradiol. The serum concentration of all delta 4-3-ketosteroids was significantly decreased during medical oophorectomy, whereas the level of circulating delta 5-3 beta-hydroxysteroids was not altered except for pregnenolone. The present data indicate that medical oophorectomy induced by an LH-RH-a in association with tamoxifen is a very efficient and well tolerated therapy in endometriosis.\r"

The purpose of this study was to determine how well the first observation of cardiac motion, using weekly transvaginal US examinations, predicted pregnancy outcome. Three hundred sixteen pregnancies wherein the date of ovulation was known and a single gestational sac was visualized at 3 weeks after ovulation were studied. Cardiac motion was first detected at 4 weeks after ovulation in 226 (71.5%), and at 5 weeks in 67 (21.2%). In 23 patients, cardiac motion was never observed. In those patients with cardiac motion visible at 4 weeks after ovulation, 94.2% have subsequently delivered viable infants. This contrasts with only 70.1% for those patients who first had observable cardiac motion 1 week later (P = 6.7 X 10(-6]. This study demonstrates that the solo finding of a gestational sac is a poor predictor of pregnancy outcome (82.3% accurate) and that the earlier that cardiac motion is initially observed, the better the pregnancy prognosis.\r"

A multivariate logistical regression analysis showed cervical mucus to be the most predictive variable followed by serum E2 level. No absolute E2 level was found to discriminate between those who did and those who did not have withdrawal bleeding after progestin challenge. These data suggest that office examination of cervical mucus may be a useful indicator and guideline in planning therapy.\r"

Basal serum gastrin, serum pepsinogen A, and serum pepsinogen C concentrations were monitored at regular intervals. Serum gastrin levels significantly (P less than 0.01) increased threefold to fourfold during the first 1-2 months of the study when all patients ingested 40 mg of omeprazole daily. Dose reduction to 20 mg did not significantly decrease gastrin levels. Serum gastrin levels showed a trend to further increase after the first 3 months of treatment, reaching statistically significant differences for values from the 3-12-month period (P less than 0.05) and from the 3-24-month period (P less than 0.005). Women and patients with high basal serum gastrin levels before omeprazole treatment were more likely to achieve higher serum gastrin levels during omeprazole treatment. Serum pepsinogen A and C levels were significantly (P less than 0.01) increased at all time intervals during long-term treatment with omeprazole. No significant tendency toward higher serum pepsinogen C levels in time was observed. However, serum pepsinogen A levels and the ratio of pepsinogen A to pepsinogen C further increased significantly (P less than or equal to 0.05) during the initial 3-12-month period. However, this trend was not observed anymore afterward. Antrectomized patients did not show increases in serum gastrin and serum pepsinogen A and C levels, suggesting that hypergastrinemia may be involved in the observed hyperpepsinogenemia.\r"

Analysis of the data shows that the percentage of endoscopic healing after 6 and 12 weeks of treatment was fairly constant in patients with the same endoscopic grade of severity of reflux esophagitis at the start of treatment, whether they were treated with 800 mg u.i.d. (HS or dinnertime), 800 mg b.i.d., or 400 mg q.i.d. Healing percentages after 12 weeks of therapy ranged from 79%-92% for grade I, from 65%-70% for grade II, and from 41%-54% for grade III. Differences within the three grades for the various treatment regimens did not reach statistical significance. Symptomatic improvement was evaluated with the Standardized Total Heartburn Index, which is based on frequency and severity of heartburn as well as on the number of patients in the study population experiencing heartburn at a given time in relation to the total heartburn load at the start of the study. All three treatment schedules resulted in a substantial reduction of the Standardized Total Heartburn Index. Treatment with cimetidine, 800 mg u.i.d., for 6-12 weeks was efficacious in the majority of patients with reflux esophagitis grade I-III. Symptom relief was superior with dosing after dinner time compared with dosing HS. A single dose of 800 mg administered after the evening meal approached the efficacy achieved with 400 mg q.i.d. Based on these objectives and symptomatic results, a u.i.d. cimetidine regimen appears to be the treatment of choice for the initial approach of a patient with reflux esophagitis. A u.i.d. regimen may enhance patient compliance, comfort, and safety as well as ease of prescription while also being less expensive.\r"

Thirty-six patients (24 men, 12 women) received colchicine (1 mg orally every morning) and 36 (25 men, 11 women) received an identical placebo. Seven (19%) colchicine-treated and six (17%) control patients died during the index hospitalization after a mean of 17.4 +/- 10.8 and 17.8 +/- 5.3 days, respectively (NS).

The proposed mechanism is decreased release of cholecystokinin through negative feedback control by an increased amount of intraduodenal bile acids. In the present study we examined cholecystokinin release and gallbladder contraction after oral administration of a commercial fatty meal (Sorbitract; Dagra, Diemen, The Netherlands) using ultrasonography in eight normal subjects and eight gallstone patients before and after 1 and 4 weeks of treatment with ursodeoxycholic acid (10 mg kg-1.day-1). Fasting gallbladder volume increased in 15 of 16 subjects during treatment (P less than 0.01). Minimal volume did not change. Therefore, both absolute and relative gallbladder emptying increased during therapy. Maximal decrement of gallbladder volume in milliliters and percentage as well as integrated gallbladder contraction during 90 minutes in milliliters and percentage were significantly increased after 1 and 4 weeks of treatment with ursodeoxycholic acid when compared with data before therapy. Gallstone patients tended to have larger fasting and residual gallbladder volumes than normal subjects, whereas parameters for the amount of bile expelled (maximal decrement of gallbladder volume and integrated gallbladder contraction in milliliters and percentage) did not differ. Release of cholecystokinin did not change during treatment and did not differ significantly between patients and normal subjects. Mean relative percentage of ursodeoxycholic acid in bile during treatment in 13 subjects consenting to have duodenal intubation was 47% (range 31%-60%). Changes of fasting gallbladder volume after institution of bile acid treatment correlated significantly (r = 0.74, P less than 0.01) with changes of cholesterol saturation index but not with relative percentage of ursodeoxycholic acid in bile. This study indicates that gallbladder emptying does not decrease during treatment with ursodeoxycholic acid. Moreover, there is no evidence of decreased cholecystokinin release.\r"

In peptic ulcer disease it is as effective as the H2-receptor antagonists, costs considerably less, and offers a lower rate of relapse. When Helicobacter pylori is implicated, bismuth acts as an antimicrobial agent, suppressing the organism but not eliminating it. In recent studies, bismuth compounds have been used with conventional antibiotics, producing elimination of the organism, histological improvement, and amelioration of symptoms for periods longer than one year. Bismuth subsalicylate has shown modest efficacy in treating traveler's diarrhea and acute and chronic diarrhea in children, and it is effective prophylactically for traveler's diarrhea. An epidemic of neurological toxicity was reported in France in the 1970's with prolonged bismuth treatment, usually bismuth subgallate and subnitrate. Such toxicity has been rare with bismuth subsalicylate and colloidal bismuth subcitrate. However, recent studies have demonstrated intestinal absorption of bismuth (about 0.2% of the ingested dose) and sequestration of this heavy metal in multiple tissue sites, even occurring with conventional dosing over a 6-week period. These findings have inspired recommendations that treatment periods with any bismuth-containing compound should last no longer than 6-8 weeks, followed by 8-week bismuth-free intervals.\r"

The latest report up to 1988 was used for each cohort. The end point was the standardized morbidity or mortality ratio as the measure of relative risk. Two additional cohorts using mortality as the end point were excluded because the authors failed to use comparable diagnostic methods for the asbestos-exposed populations and controls. The summary standardized morbidity or mortality ratio for all 21 cohorts was 0.97 (P greater than 0.05), and there was no dose-response relationship in the two studies with such data. The evidence does not meet the established criteria for making a judgment that there is a causal relationship between asbestos and colorectal cancer.\r"

  ".W": "Epithelial expression of HLA class II determinants and the number of lamina propria and intraepithelial T cells were quantified in gastric body mucosa by means of paired immunofluorescence staining which was subjected to computerised image analysis. In normal mucosa, epithelial HLA-DR expression was virtually absent. A significantly increased expression was seen in simple chronic gastritis, most extensively in the isthmus zone, where a positive reaction was seen in 34% of the epithelial area when the gastritis was of low degree and in 85% when it was of moderate severity. The most extensive HLA-DR expression was found in moderate 'stump gastritis' 28 to 32 years after Billroth II resections. In these patients the epithelial area in the foveolar and isthmus zones showed 83% and 92% positive responses, respectively. The HLA subregion products were expressed in a differential manner (DR greater than DP greater than DQ). The number of both intraepithelial and lamina propria T cells increased significantly with increasing severity of gastritis, and the fraction of putative memory T cells was also raised. Correlation analyses showed a positive relation between the epithelial expression of HLA-DR and the intraepithelial as well as the lamina propria density of T cell. These results suggest a biological link between T cells, aberrant HLA-DR expression, and gastritis, although the pathogenic importance of this relation is unknown. Enhanced epithelial presentation of autoantigens or luminal antigens, or both leading to increased activation of T cells is one possible explanation.\r"

Serum was collected from: 29 patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis, 18 patients with ulcerative colitis alone, 19 patients with extrahepatic biliary obstruction of other causes, and 42 healthy control subjects. Bile duct antibodies reacted with an antigen localised to the small and large intrahepatic bile ducts. When blood group A human liver was used they were detected in 34% of patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis. They were not detected when blood group O human liver was used. Bile duct antibodies that reacted with obstructed and normal rabbit liver were detected in 34% and 17% respectively of patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis but were also present in similar proportions of control subjects. Colon antibodies that reacted with human and rabbit colon were found in 52% and 24% respectively of patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis. Absorption studies using blood group substances A and B abolished the reactivity of bile duct antibodies with human and rabbit liver and that of colon antibodies' with rabbit colon. Colon antibodies that reacted with human colon were not absorbed. Absorption studies using isolated peripheral white blood cells did not affect reactivity of bile duct or colon antibodies. We conclude that bile duct antibodies are disease, species, and tissue non-specific and react with blood group A/B antigens present in human and rabbit bile ducts and rabbit colon. This suggests that they do not play a role in the pathogenesis of primary sclerosing cholangitis.\r"

  ".W": "Increased sympathoadrenal activity appears to play an important role in the development or maintenance of elevated blood pressure in hypertensive patients and various animal models of hypertension. Alterations of adrenergic receptor number or responsiveness might contribute to this increased activity. We therefore reviewed the data on adrenergic receptor alterations in hypertension with special emphasis on several key cardiovascular tissues (i.e., heart, vascular smooth muscle, and kidney) and on lymphocytes and platelets as human tissues available for such studies. The data suggest that the number of alpha-adrenergic receptors in hypertension is regulated by catecholamines, dietary salt intake, and genetic factors. Increases in renal alpha-adrenergic receptor number may be etiologic in genetic forms of essential hypertension. beta-Adrenergic receptor alterations in states of elevated blood pressure do not appear to be specific for genetic hypertension. Desensitization of beta-adrenergic receptor function in hypertensive animals and patients contrasts with reports of decreased, unchanged, and increased beta-adrenergic receptor number, suggesting that signal transduction of beta-adrenergic (and possibly other) receptors that stimulate adenylyl cyclase is disturbed in hypertension. The mechanisms of such heterologous desensitization in states of elevated blood pressure remain to be elucidated.\r"

The most pronounced effect was observed with PS, cuprophane, modified cellulose and PMMA. The results are not related to differences in the viability of PMN during the test procedure; dead PMN amounted to about 4-6.5%. A significant increase in beta-NAG and beta-Gluc activities was released in the supernatants of the phagocytosis suspensions. This increase activity can be explained by the phagocytosis of PMN but it was not influenced by membrane contact. There was no influence of membrane contact or phagocytosis activity of PMN on the beta 2 M concentration in the supernatant demonstrating that no in vitro generation during incubation with either membrane exists.\r"

Two patients found to have Perthes' disease had longer-lasting effusion and symptoms. Patients without an effusion had no obvious cause for their pain, so the pressure of an effusion from a transient synovitis does not account for all patients with irritable hips. Patients with an effusion persisting for over 24 days (the mean + 2 s.d. of our series) had more symptoms, a significantly larger effusion and greater limitation of movement. They may be more at risk for avascular necrosis. We found that radiographic examination influenced the immediate management of only two patients, those with Perthes' disease. We therefore propose a protocol of management for irritable hip, using ultrasonography at the first presentation of certain categories of patients. This would reduce the number of early radiographs by 75%.\r"

Spontaneous sinus formation or surgical drainage yielded a sterile exudate containing liquid remnants of the degrading implants. After prompt drainage this discharge subsided within three weeks. Histological examination showed a typical nonspecific foreign-body reaction with abundant giant cells both in patients with the reaction and in some patients with an uneventful clinical course. The factors determining the nature of the reaction were probably related to the local capacity of the tissues to clear the polymeric debris. The reactions did not influence the clinical or radiographic results, but recognition of the incidence and the features of the reaction is necessary in view of the increasing use of such implants.\r"

Rotatory movements of up to 5.7 degrees were found in nine of the 13 hips where this analysis could be performed. Movements of cobalt-chrome (12) and titanium alloy (8) cups did not differ significantly. Seventeen of the 20 patients had some pain two years after the operation. The migration of the prostheses indicates that 'osseointegration' had not occurred. The combination of this with persistent pain suggests that the long-term results will be unfavourable.\r"

  ".W": "The purpose of this study was to characterize the levels of progesterone and hCG and the variability of those levels over 24 h in early pregnancy. Venous blood sampling was performed every 30 min during the first trimester of a subsequently normal pregnancy in 19 women. The variability in each progesterone and hCG data series was evaluated by three methods: 1) comparing the coefficient of variation (CV) of each individual hormone data set to the respective assay CV, 2) examining each data set for pulses, and 3) relating changes in hormone levels to the ingestion of a meal. The CV for each individual progesterone data set was greater than the assay CV (CV progesterone, 3.7%) in all subjects (range, 5.58-21.90%). The CV for each individual hCG data set was greater than the assay CV for hCG (CV hCG, 4.3%) in 17 of 19 subjects (range, 3.27-10.95%). Mean (+/- SE) progesterone and hCG peak frequencies were 2.4 +/- 0.3 and 1.7 +/- 0.3/24 h, respectively. When postprandial levels of progesterone were normalized to a percentage of preprandial levels, there were maximum decreases in mean progesterone levels of 15.4 +/- 2.6% and 13.1 +/- 1.9% 1 h after initiation of the lunch and dinner meals, respectively (P less than 0.05). Postprandial hCG levels decreased by 2.3 +/- 1.9% and 0.4 +/- 1.6% during this same time period (P greater than 0.05). These findings suggest that 1) both progesterone and hCG levels fluctuate during a 24-h period in early pregnancy; 2) this variability of both hormones is greater than inherent assay variability and can be resolved into a short term pattern of pulses, suggesting alterations in episodic secretion, metabolic clearance, or volume of distribution of the hormone; and 3) a portion of the variability in the progesterone time set may be due to the ingestion of meals.\r"

Subsequently, 34 of the patients were maintained for 12-26 months on the minimal efficacious dose, determined from the previous dose-response study. Some adverse effects were frequently encountered, mostly at the initiation of treatment, and disappeared with time. Asymptomatic gallstones occurred in 5 patients. Minimal changes in carbohydrate tolerance, consisting of a rise in blood glucose and a transient decrease in plasma insulin level after meals, were noted. GH normalized in 22% of the patients, improved in 56%, and remained unchanged in 22% regardless of the dose. The optimal daily dose was 300 micrograms in 50% of the patients and 1500 micrograms in 20%. Pituitary tumor size reduction occurred in 47% of the patients harboring large tumors or tumor remnants. No additional improvement or escape from being controlled occurred with time. These data indicate that SMS 201-995 is an effective treatment for refractory acromegaly and for some de novo patients for whom surgical therapy is not advisable.\r"

  ".U": "90338318\r", 
  ".W": "The ACTH-adrenal axis is a critical stress-responsive system with prominent circadian rhythmicity. To test the basis for the circadian ACTH physiology, we have used 1) a sensitive and specific two-site immunoradiometric assay to estimate plasma ACTH-(1-39) concentrations during intensive (every 10 min) and extended (24-h) blood sampling to capture complete diurnal ACTH profiles in eight normal men, and 2) a novel deconvolution model designed to resolve the number, amplitude, and duration of ACTH secretory bursts and simultaneously estimate subject-specific ACTH half-lives under physiological conditions in vivo. Deconvolution revealed 40 +/- 1.5 significant ACTH secretory bursts/24 h, with a mean interburst interval of 39 +/- 2.3 min. ACTH secretory bursts were discrete punctuated events arising without tonic interpulse secretion and had a half-duration (duration at half-maximal amplitude) of 19 +/- 2 min. The estimated half-life of endogenous ACTH was 15 +/- 1.2 min, and its daily production rate was 0.96 +/- 0.16 ng/mL (0.21 +/- 0.035 nmol/L) distribution volume. Cosinor analysis revealed a significant (3.8-fold) 24-h rhythm in the mass (or rate) of ACTH secreted per burst (maximal at 0818 h), but no nyctohemeral variation in ACTH secretory pulse frequency. The validity of ACTH pulse analysis was supported by the significantly nonrandom associations among ACTH, beta-endorphin, and cortisol peaks in the same subjects. Specifically, we found that ACTH and beta-endorphin bursts occurred simultaneously (P less than 10(-4)) and were both followed in 10 min by a cortisol pulse (P less than 10(-4)). We conclude that 1) selective amplitude control of a punctuated burst-like mode of ACTH secretion can give rise to the nyctohemeral corticotropic rhythm without the need to postulate any tonic (or interpulse basal) component of ACTH release; and 2) there is exquisite 3-fold temporal synchrony among bursts of ACTH, beta-endorphin, and cortisol release in normal men.\r"

  ".W": "A growing number of studies provided the evidence that human decidua is a pregnancy-related tissue capable of hormone production and metabolism. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the possible presence of inhibin subunits in human decidua. Tissue samples were collected in pregnant women during the first (8 weeks) and second trimester (18 weeks) of gestation and at term (40 weeks). Immunohistochemical data were obtained using affinity purified polyclonal antisera raised in rabbit against porcine alpha, beta A, or beta B subunits. Levels of the respective inhibin subunits were evaluated by Northern blot analysis using cDNA probes encoding sequences corresponding to each subunit. The present results indicated that human decidua contains and synthesizes inhibin alpha, beta A, and beta B subunits. The immunohistochemical data showed that decidual cells were stained with both inhibin alpha and beta B antisera, showing a similar localization. On the other hand, cells stained with inhibin beta A antisera were sparse and followed a distribution pattern different from that of cells stained with alpha or beta B antisera. The first inhibin alpha and beta B subunit mRNAs were both expressed in first trimester of pregnancy, and those mRNA levels showed a gestational related increase. The beta A subunit mRNA was expressed at very low levels at term and could not be detected earlier during pregnancy. The present data showed that human decidua actively produces inhibin subunits with a gestational-related profile. The results suggest that decidua may be a further source of inhibin-related proteins during pregnancy and emphasize the endocrine competence of human decidua.\r"

  ".U": "90338469\r", 
  ".W": "Paraffin wax embedded, formalin fixed sections of 22 adenocarcinomas of the exocrine pancreas were stained with four mouse monoclonal antibodies: DD9-E7, an antibody raised against a human pancreatic tumour xenograft; carcino-embryonic antigen (CEA); epithelial membrane antigen (EMA); and cytokeratin (CAM 5.2). An indirect immunoperoxidase technique without enzyme pre-digestion and an affinity-purified sheep anti-mouse peroxidase conjugate were used. All of the tumours were positive for DD9-E7, EMA, and CAM 5.2. Twenty out of 22 were focally positive for CEA and the staining was often weak. As all of these adenocarcinomas were DD9-E7 positive, absence of staining for DD9-E7 in a tumour makes the diagnosis of adenocarcinoma of the exocrine pancreas very unlikely, and this is of value in distinction from endocrine carcinomas with a marked acinar pattern. The weak CEA staining distinguished pancreatic carcinomas from colorectal tumours. Because the distribution of staining for EMA and CAM 5.2 was no different from that previously seen in adenocarcinomas from other sites, these markers are likely to be of limited value in the differential diagnosis of abdominal adenocarcinomas of uncertain origin.\r"

  ".W": "The feasibility of using an image analyser, the CAS 100, to assess the ploidy of smooth muscle tumours on formalin fixed paraffin wax embedded tissue was assessed. Various different methods of assessment were compared. A paraffin wax block of 15 leiomyomata and 13 leiomyosarcomata yielded serial sections of 3 microns, 5 microns, and 7 microns and a cytospin preparation (from a 50 micron section). Sections and cytospin preparations were stained with Feulgen and quantified using the CAS 100. The suitability of lymphocytes, previously suggested to be unsuitable as control cells in tissue sections due to the compact nature of their DNA, was assessed in sections and cytospin preparations and compared with endothelial cells, the standard alternative, on the same slide. Despite having a mean nuclear area of only 18.5 microns 2 in sections lymphocytes had a similar diploid peak--that is, 4.1 pg--to endothelial cells (mean nuclear area 39 microns 2). A comparison of 3 microns, 5 microns, and 7 microns sections showed 5 microns to be the optimal thickness. Cytospin preparations yielded histograms of superior quality than those from tissue sections. All 15 leiomyomata had a 5C exceeding rate of less than 0.3%. Ten of 11 histologically malignant tumours had a 5C exceeding rate of more than 5% (mean 14%) in sections and cytospins. Two leiomyosarcomata that had arisen in the lower gastrointestinal tract had a mitotic rate of less than or equal to 1/10 per high power fields and yielded histograms similar to those of the leiomyomata. It is concluded that formalin fixed, paraffin wax embedded tissue can be used for DNA quantification by image analysis; that tissue sections yield poorer results than cytospin preparations; that lymphocytes are reliable control cells in cytospin preparations; and that a population of cell greater than 5C is seen in 90% of leiomyosarcomata.\r"

Both bone marrow biopsy and aspiration (performed at different anatomical sites) were required at presentation. Bone marrow biopsy data indicated that changes in bone marrow composition from MGUS to early multiple myeloma and to advanced multiple myeloma followed a precise pattern, including an increased percentage of bone marrow plasma cells (BMPC%), a shift from plasmocytic to plasmoblastic cytology, an increase in bone marrow cellularity and fibrosis, a change in bone marrow infiltration (becoming diffuse rather than interstitial), a decrease in residual haemopoiesis and an increase in osteoclasts. In multiple myeloma the BMPC% of biopsy specimens and aspirate were closely related, although in 5% of cases the difference between the two values was greater than 20%. Some histological features were remarkably associated with each other. For example, BMPC% was higher in cases with plasmoblastic cytology, heavy fibrosis, or reduced residual haemopoiesis. Anaemia was the clinical characteristic most influenced by bone marrow histology. The BMPC% was the only histological variable which affected the greatest number of clinical and laboratory characteristics, including, besides haemoglobin concentration, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, radiographic skeletal bone disease, and serum concentrations of monoclonal component, calcium, beta 2-microglobulin and thymidine kinase activity. These data indicate that comparative bone marrow histology in monoclonal gammopathies has clinical importance.\r"

The results showed a progressive decrease in fibrinogen and plasminogen concentrations; fibrin degradation products showed a progressive increase as the disease progressed. Together with a falling platelet count, these data indicate the possible occurrence of disseminated intravascular coagulation with enhanced fibrinolysis which was most pronounced in those who vomited blood. Antithrombin III concentration showed a progressive decrease in parallel with the progress of the disease, possibly due to decreased synthesis or increased consumption, or both. Cl-activator concentration showed no significant change from that in normal controls at any stage of the disease. These findings provide further evidence that disseminated intravascular coagulation and enhanced fibrinolysis in the late stages of schistosomiasis may contribute to the haemorrhagic diathesis seen in the liver and spleen.\r"

This antibody, designated CAMVIR-1, reacted with a 56 kilodalton protein in cells infected with L1-vaccinia virus, and the protein was present in a predominantly nuclear location. The antibody also detects the HPV-16 L1 antigen in formalin fixed, paraffin wax embedded biopsy specimens and on routine cervical smears. The antibody reacts strongly and consistently with biopsy specimens containing HPV-16 or HPV-33, but very weak reactions were occasionally observed with biopsy specimens or smears containing HPV-6 or HPV-11. The potential advantages of using a vaccinia recombinant are (i) the target protein is synthesised in a eukoryotic cell so that its \"processing\" and location are normal; (ii) cells infected with vaccinia recombinants can be subjected to various fixing procedures similar to those used for routine clinical material. This greatly increases the probability that an identified antibody will be useful in a clinical setting.\r"

In 1981 these three serotypes accounted for 45%, 12%, and 7% of isolations. The remaining 35% comprised strains belonging to a further 188 different serotypes, none of which accounted for more than 1% of the total. In 1988 S typhimurium accounted for 24% of isolations, S enteritidis 57%, and S virchow 4%. The remaining 15% comprised strains of a further 184 serotypes. The resistances to the common antimicrobial drugs in non-typhoidal salmonellas isolated in England and Wales in 1981 and 1988 were reported with particular reference to resistance to four or more antimicrobial drugs (multiple resistance). For S typhimurium the overall percentage of resistant strains varied little, but multiple resistance more than doubled from 5% to 12%; in S enteritidis the incidence remained the same. In S virchow the percentages of strains resistant to all the antimicrobial drugs and in particular, to chloramphenicol, streptomycin, trimethoprim and furazolidone, rose from 0.2% to 10.4%. Salmonella enteritis in man is usually a self limiting disease and antimicrobial treatment is seldom required; but should spread beyond the intestine occur, effective antimicrobial treatment is essential. Under these circumstances a knowledge of the likelihood of resistances to commonly available drugs could be of considerable value to the clinician.\r"

The numbers of mitotic figures in the normal mucosa of six colectomy specimens were counted with delays in fixation of 30 minutes, one hour, two hours, three hours and six hours for samples from each specimen. The numbers of mitotic figures were counted in 50 whole crypts in each specimen by two observers. All phases of mitosis were counted. The number of observable mitotic figures declined by about 30% with a delay in fixation of two hours and by 50% with a delay of six hours. This observation has important implications for the handling of surgical specimens.\r"

Leuco patent blue staining, for the presence of peroxidase, Amido black B, a tinctorial staining method for haemoglobin, Perls's reaction for ferric iron (haemosiderin), Masson-Fontana for melanin, Masson's trichrome, a connective tissue strain, and the benzidine reaction for haemoglobin peroxidase were carried out in three forensic cases and one experimental case. A modified benzidine method was the most reliable indicator of haemoglobin activity, especially where dispersion into extra-cellular tissues had occurred. The resilience of the erythrocyte peroxidase enzyme to temperature changes and fixation supports the concept of a \"pseudo-peroxidase\" in those cells. It is concluded that free haemoglobin from bite marks, or indeed other forms of blunt trauma, may best be shown by the benzidine reaction and that exemption certificates for use of this prohibited substance may be worth pursuing.\r"

The NK1.1+ DN thymocytes were demonstrated, by two-color fluorescence, to be CD3lo, CD5hi, CD44hi, J11d-, B220-, MEL 14-, IL2R- with 60% expressing TCR-V beta 8 as determined by the mAb F23.1. In contrast, splenic and peripheral blood NK cells were NK1.1+, CD3-, CD5-, TCR-V beta 8- with 40 to 60% being MEL 14+. Unlike peripheral NK cells, fresh DN thymocytes enriched for NK1.1+ cells were unable to kill YAC-1, the classical murine NK cell target. However, these cells were able to mediate anti-CD3 redirected lysis even when they were assayed immediately after purification, i.e., with no culture or stimulation. These data demonstrate that adult murine thymocytes contain NK1.1+ cells which are distinct, both by function and phenotype, from peripheral NK cells. These data also raise the issue of a possible NK/T bipotential progenitor cell.\r"

  ".W": "Eight different Ts cell hybridomas (including inducer (Ts1) and effector (Ts3) suppressor cells) specific for the 4-hydroxy-3-nitrophenyl acetyl (NP) hapten were tested for their ability to respond to Ag or anti-CD3 antibody in a growth-inhibition assay. Results suggest that the expression of the TCR-CD3 complex on Ts hybridomas is required for the Ag or anti-CD3-mediated growth inhibition. One of the CD3+, Ts hybridomas (CKB-Ts3-9.H3) was tested in detail; this CD4- effector suppressor cell hybridoma showed specific inhibition of growth in the presence of NP or NIP-coupled protein conjugates but not in the presence of other irrelevant hapten-protein conjugates. In addition, growth of this hybridoma was specifically inhibited by anti-CD3 and anti-TCR-alpha/beta antibodies but not by control hamster antibodies. In order to study the role of MHC molecules in Ag-mediated growth inhibition, Ts cell hybridomas were incubated with Ag (NP-keyhole limpet hemocyanin) in the presence of spleen cells from various H-2 congenic strains. The results suggest that the Ts hybridomas that express donor Ts-derived TCR beta-chain recognize Ag in an MHC-restricted manner, whereas the two Ts3 hybridomas that utilize BW5147-derived TCR-beta recognize Ag in H-2 unrestricted way. Co-incubation of anti-CD3 and anti-TCR-alpha/beta antibodies with specific Ag enhanced the Ag-mediated growth inhibition, whereas anti-LFA-1 antibody completely blocked the Ag-mediated effect. The combined data suggest that, like Th hybridomas, expression of CD3-associated-TCR complex is essential for the Ag responsiveness of Ts cell hybridomas.\r"

  ".W": "HIV infection is associated with a long period of clinical latency before the development of symptoms and HIV-related disease. Two chronically HIV-infected cell lines, U1 (promonocytic) and ACH-2 (T-lymphocytic) have been developed as models for studying the mechanisms governing viral latency and the reactivation of virus expression. We have previously shown that a variety of physiologic stimuli, including cytokines and cell stress, can up-regulate HIV expression from these cell lines. In this study we demonstrate that heat shock can also up-regulate the production of virus from both ACH-2 and U1 cells. Heat induction of virus appears to be mediated at the transcriptional level as established in long terminal repeat-chloramphenicol acetyl transferase transient transfection experiments with the use of U937 cells. This inductive effect in part requires the NF-kappa B-binding region of the HIV-long terminal repeat. Furthermore, although physiologic levels of heat are not sufficient to directly induce virus production from these cells, these temperatures are able to synergistically enhance virus production in U1 cells stimulated with IL-6 and granulocyte macrophage-CSF. In contrast, the inductive effect of other cytokines (i.e., TNF-alpha) was not affected by heat stimulation. These in vitro observations suggest that the hyperthermia associated with opportunistic infections, particularly in conjunction with certain cytokines that are released during immune reactions, may play a role in the in vivo induction of HIV expression in infected cells.\r"

To determine the possible contribution of adhesion receptors to these restrictions, we have studied binding between the murine and human homologues of LFA-1 (CD11a/CD18) and ICAM employing purified human LFA-1 and ICAM-1 (CD54) bound to solid substrates. Murine cell lines bind to purified human LFA-1 through ICAM-1 and at least one other counter-receptor. This provides evidence for multiple counter-receptors for LFA-1 in the mouse as well as in the human. In contrast to binding of murine ICAM-1 to human LFA-1, murine LFA-1 does not bind to human ICAM-1. The species specificity maps to the LFA-1 alpha subunit, because mouse x human hybrid cells expressing the human alpha subunit associated with a mouse beta subunit bind to human ICAM-1, whereas those with a human beta subunit associated with a murine alpha subunit do not. Increased adhesiveness for ICAM-1 stimulated by phorbol esters could be demonstrated for hybrid LFA-1 molecules with human alpha and murine beta subunits.\r"

  ".W": "M protein is an antigenically variable virulence determinant present on the surface of group A streptococci, and it provides the basis for the serologic typing scheme. Type-specific serum antibodies afford strong protection against infection by the homologous serotype. Non-type-specific antigenic epitopes also exist within the surface-exposed portion of M protein. Previous studies demonstrated that intranasal immunization with Ag corresponding to sequences within the non-type-specific pepsin-susceptible site and adjacent C repeat regions of M6 protein, evoke protective immunity against pharyngeal colonization by type 6 streptococci in a mouse model. Although the protective immunogens are not type-specific, the pepsin site region of M6 is shared among less than 20% of serotypes examined. Therefore it was necessary to determine whether more highly conserved M protein epitopes elicit mucosal protection against group A streptococci, and if protective immunity extends to heterologous serotypes. In this report, peptides were synthesized that correspond to sequences completely contained within the highly conserved C repeat region of M6 protein. Peptide Ag were covalently coupled to the mucosal adjuvant, cholera toxin B subunit (CTB), and mice immunized intranasally and orally with peptide-CTB conjugates were compared to control groups that received CTB only. Immunization with the peptide-CTB conjugates led to significant protection against pharyngeal colonization by group A streptococci. Furthermore, protection was observed against the heterologous M serotype, type 14. These findings suggest that protection against multiple serotypes of group A streptococci can be achieved with a vaccine consisting of the widely shared C repeat region of M6 protein.\r"

The ability to clear a temperature-sensitive mutant of S. typhimurium from the spleen (assessed at day 21) was abrogated by in vivo treatment with anti-CD4 mAb. Accelerated bacterial clearance could be adoptively transferred into naive mice. In vitro depletion experiments also showed the role of CD4+ T cells in this phenomenon. Depletion of CD8+ T cells had only a marginal effect. Resistance to reinfection in the late phase of the primary infection (day 50) was markedly depressed by in vivo treatment with anti-CD4 mAb, whereas this was not the case during the early phase (day 14). Furthermore, during the early phase of infection athymic nude mice showed increased nonspecific resistance to reinfection. Taken together these results suggest that T-independent mechanisms play a major role in acquired resistance during the early phase of infection.\r"

  ".W": "Intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) functions as a ligand of leukocyte function-associated antigen-1 (LFA-1), as well as a receptor for human picorna virus, and its regulation thus affects various immunologic and inflammatory reactions. The weak, constitutive ICAM-1 expression on human keratinocytes (KC) can be up-regulated by cytokines such as interferon-gamma (IFN gamma) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha). In order to further examine the regulation of KC ICAM-1 expression, normal human KC or epidermoid carcinoma cells (KB) were incubated with different cytokines and/or exposed to ultraviolet (UV) radiation. Subsequently, ICAM-1 expression was monitored cytofluorometrically using a monoclonal anti-ICAM-1 antibody. Stimulation of cells with recombinant human (rh) interleukin (IL) 1 alpha, rhIL-4, rhIL-5, rhIL-6, rh granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), rh interferon alpha (rhIFN alpha), and rh transforming growth factor beta (TGF beta) did not increase ICAM-1 surface expression. In contrast, rhTNF beta significantly up-regulated ICAM-1 expression in a time- and dose-dependent manner. Moreover, the combination of rhTNF beta with rhIFN gamma increased the percentage of ICAM-1-positive KC synergistically. This stimulatory effect of rhTNF beta was further confirmed by the demonstration that rhTNF beta was capable of markedly enhancing ICAM-1 mRNA expression in KC. Finally, exposure of KC in vitro to sublethal doses of UV radiation (0-100 J/m2) prior to cytokine (rhIFN tau, rhTNF alpha, rhTNF beta) stimulation inhibited ICAM-1 up-regulation in a dose-dependent fashion. These studies identify TNF beta and UV light as potent regulators of KC ICAM-1 expression, which may influence both attachment and detachment of leukocytes and possibly viruses to KC.\r"

Induction of the intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) on the surface of epidermal keratinocytes has been proposed as an important regulator of contact-dependent aspects of cutaneous inflammation. Ultraviolet radiation (UVR) also modifies cutaneous inflammation, producing both up- and down-regulation of contact hypersensitivity. We have found that UVR has a biphasic effect on the induction of keratinocyte CD54. Using immunofluorescence and FACS techniques to quantitate cell-surface CD54 staining, we have shown that UVR (100 mJ/cm2 of UVB) significantly (p less than 0.01) inhibits keratinocyte CD54 induction by gamma interferon 24 h after irradiation. However, at 48, 72, and 96 h after UVR (10 to 100 mJ/cm2), CD54 expression is significantly induced (p less than 0.01 to p less than 0.001) to levels even greater than are induced by gamma interferon (20 U/ml). In addition, at 48, 72, or 96 h following UVR (30-100 mJ/cm2), the gamma-interferon-induced CD54 expression on human keratinocytes is also strongly (p less than 0.05 to p less than 0.001) enhanced. In this cell-culture system, gamma interferon and TNF-alpha are both strong CD54 inducers and are synergistic, but GM-CSF, TFG-beta, and IL-1 have no direct CD54-inducing effects. Thus the effects of UVR on CD54 induction are biphasic, producing inhibition at 24 h and induction at 48, 72, and 96 h. This effect on CD54 may contribute to the biphasic effects of UVR on delayed hypersensitivity in vivo. The early inhibition of ICAM-1 by UVR may also contribute to the therapeutic effects of UVR. We also speculate that the late induction of ICAM-1 by UVR might be an important step in the induction of photosensitive diseases such as lupus erythematosus.\r"

Stimulation was cytokine-specific and not due to endotoxin since it was significantly inhibited by cytokine-specific antibodies but not by polymyxin B (PB). rTNF and rGM-CSF were the most potent stimulators, were effective at concentrations less than 0.067 ng/ml, and stimulated NA greater than 600%. Relative potency was: rTNF = rGM-CSF greater than rTNF-beta greater than rIL-1. Stimulation by rTNF was due to a rapid, time-dependent effect on the neutrophil, and NA appeared to be dependent, in part, on the low-affinity neutrophil receptor for IgG, Fc(gamma)RIII, because it could be specifically inhibited by monoclonal antibody (3G8) to Fc(gamma)RIII. These results suggest that rTNF, rGM-CSF, rIL-1, and rTNF-beta may contribute individually or in combination to immune-mediated inflammation and tissue injury by stimulating immune adherence of neutrophils to tissue-bound autoantibodies and immune complexes.\r"

It was found that bFGF was strongly expressed in basal and suprabasal keratinocytes, which were also intensively stained in normal skin biopsies. The growth factor was generally absent from the endothelial cells and spindle cells of the neoplasms. These cell types exhibited a very faint staining in a small number of lesions. The studies provide strong evidence that proliferation of KS tumor cells may not be explained by autocrine secretion mechanism of the growth factor, which has been suggested in previous reports with in vitro cultured KS cell lines.\r"

No pregnancy occurred when the endometrial thickness was less than 6 mm. When type C endometrium greater than or equal to 6 mm thick was seen, the pregnancy rate per embryo transfer was 39%. When type A or B endometrial pattern was seen, the negative predictive value for the occurrence of pregnancy was 90.5%. Our results suggest that transvaginal sonographic evaluation of endometrial texture and thickness may be an indicator of the likelihood of achieving pregnancy.\r"

  ".W": "In a double-blind controlled clinical trial, 29 practitioners randomized 55 women with culture-proven Candida vaginitis to treatment with single-dose 500-mg clotrimazole vaginal tablets, and 40 to placebo. At a follow-up visit 7 to 10 days after treatment, Candida was present in 21 (38%) of those treated with clotrimazole and in 30 (75%) in the placebo group (P less than .05). Symptoms had improved or disappeared in 38 (69%) treated with clotrimazole, compared with 22 (55%) in the placebo group (P greater than .05). In 10 (23%) of the mycologically cured women, symptoms were unchanged or worse, whereas symptoms had improved or disappeared in 26 (51%) in whom Candida was isolated at the follow-up visit (P = .015). Questionnaires sent to the 95 women 4 weeks after the follow-up visit were returned by 62. Vaginal symptoms were reported by 50% in both groups. Further clinical trials including placebo are needed in general practice in the evaluation of the treatment of Candida vaginitis.\r"

  ".W": "Microscopy of wet-stained urinary sediment as an indicator of bacteriuria was evaluated in 418 consecutive primary care visits in a small community. Delivery of morning urine was encouraged and contributed to bladder incubation times of 4 or more hours in 79% of the visits; the overall culture positivity was about 80%. Bacteria or leukocytes alone or together as minimal requirements were suboptimal microscopy criteria for bacteriuria, whereas a minimum of moderate amounts of bacteria or 5 leukocytes per high-power field (x400) as a cutoff point yielded the best diagnostic accuracy. Optimization of urinary sediment microscopy in this way resulted in a desirable high sensitivity (97%) and efficacy (86%) in acutely symptomatic patients, as well as reasonably high efficacy (79%) in other patients, independent of sex or bladder incubation time. The method's simplicity and speed recommend it for use in primary care, particularly in patients with acute symptoms of urinary tract infection.\r"

  ".W": "Hypnosis has been used as a therapeutic tool for centuries, but only in the past 50 years have the clinical applications been delineated. As evident in the medical literature, the use of hypnosis by the medical community has increased, partly as a result of a growing awareness of hypnotherapy as an available treatment modality, and also as a result of major improvements in research methodology through strict standardization. Hypnotherapy, once considered to be limited to entertainment, has now proven useful in the treatment of a wide variety of medical illness. Two cases of the use of hypnosis are presented. In the first case, hypnosis is used to alleviate pain in a gravid patient in sickle cell crisis. In the second case, hypnosis is used for desensitization of dental phobia in a 27-year-old women. The historical, theoretical, and clinical applications of hypnosis are reviewed.\r"

  ".W": "Compared with late 19th century publications in Great Britain and France, medical writers in the United States of the same era apparently had less interest in anorexia nervosa as a distinct clinical syndrome. A review of the literature of that period shows that American physicians very rarely referred to the \"new\" syndrome described in 1873 by Gull and Lasegue. Except for some short or oblique references, the first explicit clinical description of a case of anorexia nervosa by an American author (James Hendrie Lloyd) did not appear until 1893. The controversy about \"fasting girls\" and the all-dominating diagnosis of neurasthenia may explain the delay in the American interest in the new disorder. The present article documents and discusses this hitherto little known fragment in the history of medicine and psychiatry.\r"
