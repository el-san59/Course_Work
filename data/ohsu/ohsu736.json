With the frequency of 'day case' cataract surgery increasing, an efficient preoperative mydriatic regimen is important. In this study we considered the use of topical indomethacin as an addition to a regimen already implemented. One hundred and fourteen eyes underwent intercapsular cataract surgery, of which 64 were randomised to receive topical aqueous indomethacin one hour beforehand, and 50 eyes, which did not receive indomethacin formed the comparison group. Topical indomethacin reduced the miosis which occurs during cataract surgery whether performed under local or general anaesthesia. The operating time was shorter for eyes with less surgically induced miosis.\r"

A highly significant negative relationship was found between the presenting visual field coefficient (FC) and the untreated IOP (r = -0.26, p = 0.0001) - that is, the higher the IOP on detection, the worse is the visual field. A weak negative correlation was present between the change of FC per year and the treated IOP (r = -0.06), p = less than 0.05). At treated IOPs less than or equal to 18 mmHg visual field loss averaged 0.6 unit per year and for IOPs greater than 18 mmHg the average loss was 1.2 units per year. The data confirm both the importance of a raised IOP in the causation of chronic glaucomatous visual field loss and the importance of reducing the IOP in patients with chronic simple glaucoma.\r"

Forty-eight hours after inoculation the animals were divided into three groups: (1) 14 eyes, received fluconazole (2 mg/ml) and the epithelium subsequently removed; (2) 14 eyes, received only fluconazole drops; (3) 14 eyes, received 0.9% NaCl: half of this group was also debrided. We applied one drop of either substance 10 times a day for 24 days. A further six rabbits were used to judge if the drug penetrated into the cornea and aqueous humour. There was a highly significant difference between the fluconazole groups (1,2) and the control group (3) as to hypopyon and complications (descemetocele, corneal perforation) as well as recultivation of C. albicans from corneal tissue. The difference between the fluconazole groups with and without debridement was not significant. The drug penetrated into the cornea and aqueous humour of both uninflamed and inflamed eyes.\r"

Although it is possible to place a plaque in close association with the optic nerve sheath, a tissue barrier exists which may prevent actual contact between the plaque and nerve. Posterior tilting of the plaque may also occur. Because of these uncertainties regarding plaque placement, juxtapapillary melanomas should be considered a distinct subgroup when evaluating the efficacy of radioactive plaque brachytherapy in the treatment of choroidal melanoma.\r"

They comprised most early T-cell precursors (CFU-TL) as they displayed high capacity to generate T-cell clones when cultured in limiting dilutions. CFU-TL nature of these cells was also confirmed by the sequential expression of mature T-cell specific markers on their surface after in vitro induction. This BM subset also contained 2% to 3% CFU-GM precursors. Together, these results pointed to the existence of BM CD7+CD2- precursors with high differentiation potential and showed the commitment of most of them to T-cell lineage.\r"

  ".U": "90167268\r", 
  ".W": "Infusing factor VIIa (FVIIa) has been reported to control bleeding in hemophilic patients with factor VIII (FVIII) inhibitors. This is difficult to attribute to an enhanced FVIIa/tissue factor (TF) activation of factor X, since in vitro studies suggest that infusion of FVIIa should neither increase substantially the rate of formation of FVIIa/TF complexes during hemostasis (Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 85:6687, 1988) nor bypass the dampening of TF-dependent coagulation by the extrinsic pathway inhibitor (EPI) (Blood 73:359, 1989). Partial thromboplastin times have also been reported to shorten after infusion of FVIIa. The experiments reported herein establish that shortening of partial thromboplastin times after adding FVIIa to hemophilic plasma in vitro stems from an FVIIa-catalyzed activation of factor X independent of possible trace contamination of reagents with TF. Experiments in purified systems confirmed that FVIIa can slowly activate factor X in a reaction mixture containing Ca2+ and phospholipid but no source of TF. The rate of activation was sufficient to account for the shortening of partial thromboplastin times observed. EPI, which turned off continuing FVIIa/TF activation of factor X, was unable to prevent continuing FVIIa/phospholipid activation of factor X. Because circulating plasma contains only a trace, if any, free FVIIa, such a reaction could never occur physiologically. However, infusing FVIIa creates a nonphysiologic circumstance in which a continuing slow FVIIa/phospholipid catalyzed activation of factor X could conceivably proceed in vivo unimpeded by EPI. Such a mechanism of factor X activation might compensate for an impaired factor IXa/FVIIIa/phospholipid activation of factor X during hemostatis, and therefore control bleeding in a hemophilic patient.\r"

  ".W": "Normal human platelets aggregated by thrombin undergo the release reaction and are not readily deaggregated by the combination of inhibitors hirudin, chymotrypsin, and prostaglandin E1 (PGE1). In contrast, thrombin-induced aggregates of platelets from patients with delta-storage pool deficiency (delta-SPD), which lack releasable nucleotides, are readily deaggregated by the same combination of inhibitors. The ease with which delta-SPD platelets are deaggregated is caused by the lack of stabilizing effects of released ADP, since: (1) exogenous adenosine diphosphate (ADP) (10 mumol/L), but not serotonin (2 mumol/L), abolishes the ability of these inhibitors to deaggregate delta-SPD platelets; (2) thrombin-induced aggregates of platelets from a patient (V.R.) (whose platelets have a severe, selective impairment of sensitivity to ADP, but normal amounts of releasable nucleotides) can be readily deaggregated, and addition of ADP does not stabilize the platelet aggregates; (3) apyrase or creatine phosphate (CP)/creatine phosphokinase (CPK), added before thrombin, make control platelets more easily deaggregated by hirudin, chymotrypsin, and PGE1, and do not change the deaggregation response of delta-SPD platelets and of V.R.'s platelets. Thrombin-induced aggregation and release of beta-thromboglobulin in control, delta-SPD, and in V.R.'s platelets was similar and not inhibited by apyrase or CP/CPK. The stabilizing effect of ADP on platelet aggregates is specific, since epinephrine in the presence of apyrase to remove traces of released ADP does not stabilize the aggregates of control, delta-SPD, or of V.R.'s platelets. Because epinephrine increases fibrinogen binding to thrombin-stimulated platelets to a greater extent than ADP, but does not stabilize the aggregates, it is unlikely that the additional fibrinogen binding sites induced by ADP have a major role in inhibiting deaggregation by the combination of inhibitors.\r"

  ".W": "We found that a monoclonal antibody (MoAb) to CD9 antigen, PMA2, induced a rise in cytosolic free calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i) in fura-2-loaded platelets, and we examined whether this response was due to direct action of PMA2 on CD9 antigen. The rise in [Ca2+]i was dependent on the PMA2 concentration, irrespective of the presence or absence of extracellular Ca2+. The role of secreted adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and thromboxane in the [Ca2+]i response to PMA2 was studied using creatine phosphate/creatine phosphokinase (CP/CPK) and aspirin. Combined treatment with CP/CPK and aspirin abolished the rise in [Ca2+]i, although either CP/CPK or aspirin alone produced only partial inhibition. Inhibition of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) secretion and thromboxane B2 synthesis by an MoAb to the glycoprotein IIb-IIIa complex, PMA1, resulted in little [Ca2+]i response to PMA2. In contrast, thrombasthenic platelets, in which ATP secretion and thromboxane B2 synthesis were normal, showed a normal [Ca2+]i response. When PMA2 was added to CD9+ mononuclear cells, no rise in [Ca2+]i was observed. Thus, we conclude that binding of monoclonal immunoglobulin G molecules to the CD9 antigen raises [Ca2+]i through the effect of secreted ADP and thromboxane on platelets, and that CD9 antigen is not directly involved in induction of Ca2+ influx and mobilization.\r"

Sequence analysis of all eight exons, all exon-intron junctions, 160 base pairs (bp) of DNA 5' to the proposed translation start site, and 60 bp 3' to the translation termination site shows no other difference from the normal factor IX gene, with the exception of a previously described benign polymorphism at position 148 in the protein (Ala----Thr). The affected subject has severe hemophilia B with no detectable factor IX activity despite normal factor IX antigen levels. We purified the abnormal factor IX by immunoaffinity chromatography and demonstrated that its activation by factor Xla is markedly delayed compared with normal factor lX. Once activated, the abnormal factor lX binds antithrombin III in a 1:1 molar ratio, and the activated protein demonstrates catalytic activity, suggesting an intact active site. The mutation creates a new Bst Yl restriction endonuclease cleavage site. Restriction with Bst Yl shows the mutation in maternal DNA and offers the possibility of direct carrier status analysis and prenatal diagnosis in kindreds with this mutation. We designate this new mutation factor lXNew London. This is the only reported mutation in the first EGF-like domain that causes severe hemophilia B.\r"

  ".W": "Our laboratory has previously shown that osteonectin, an abundant noncollagenous bone protein, is contained in and secreted from human platelets. In this study, the distribution of osteonectin both in the supernatant and on the platelet surface after activation was measured by fluid-phase and solid-phase radioimmunoassay, respectively. Total cellular osteonectin was determined by RIA of guanidinium chloride extracted platelets and ranged from 0.65 to 2.2 micrograms/10(8) platelets or 135,000 to 457,000 molecules/platelet. Platelets treated with varying concentrations of collagen and thrombin released osteonectin in a dose-dependent fashion. Approximately 61% of the total platelet osteonectin was secreted at saturating concentrations of collagen and thrombin. A small fraction of platelet osteonectin is expressed on the surface of platelets in an activation-specific manner as evidenced by the specific and saturable binding of [125I]-anti-osteonectin monoclonal antibody, IIIA3A8, to thrombin-activated platelets. Based on a non-linear least squares regression analysis of the antibody binding, 2,200 IIIA3A8 molecules, or 0.8% of the total platelet osteonectin, is expressed on the platelet surface on activation. Platelet osteonectin was purified from the supernatant of thrombin-activated platelets by immunoaffinity chromatography. Western blotting of proteins secreted by washed, thrombin-stimulated platelets with IIIA3A8 indicated that the osteonectin molecule released from the platelet is a single chain polypeptide. Comparison of immunopurified platelet osteonectin with isolated bovine bone osteonectin and isolated human bone osteonectin by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis indicated that platelet osteonectin has a greater apparent molecular weight than bone osteonectin. The NH2-terminal sequence of immunopurified platelet osteonectin was obtained by automated Edman degradation and is identical to the sequence of human bone osteonectin derived from the cDNA of SaOS-2 cells. Collectively, these data suggest that platelet osteonectin is structurally distinct from bone osteonectin in a region of the molecule at a distance from the NH2-terminus.\r"

In this study we characterize NS activity in bone marrow cells of the rhesus monkey. Greatest NS activity was found in low-density cells (1.0600 to 1.0655 g/mL) obtained by density centrifugation on a discontinuous Percoll gradient. NS activity was further enriched when cells were separated by affinity for wheat germ agglutinin (WGA). Cells with high affinity to WGA demonstrated potent NS activity, whereas cells with low affinity to WGA had no NS activity. A significant relationship between NS activity and hematopoietic activity was demonstrated using in vitro assays of colony formation (CFU-GM and CFU-MIX). NS activity was not affected by treatment with monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs) to human Fc gamma receptors (Leu, 11a,b,c) or treatment with MoAbs to monkey natural killer cells. These findings extend our prior observations by showing that cells with NS activity, which apparently have WGA receptors, are present not only in murine BM but also in monkey bone marrow, and suggest that such cells may be involved in immunoregulation by primitive cells of BM.\r"

  ".W": "Analysis of immunoglobulin (Ig) and T-cell receptor gene rearrangements, using Southern blot hybridization, has been applied to peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) in 335 samples from patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. The incidence of circulating lymphoma cells detected by gene rearrangement analyses is related to the histologic subtype, clinical stage of disease, and clinical status. Among 104 patients studied at diagnosis, the incidence of positive analyses was 34% in low-grade lymphoma and only 8% in intermediate-grade lymphoma. Clonal Ig gene rearrangements were detected nearly universally in the small lymphocytic histologic subtype. PBL studies were related to the initial stage of disease: positive studies were seen in 35% of patients with stage IV disease, 29% of patients with stage III disease, and 12% of patients with stages I-II disease. The incidence of PBL rearrangements at the time of disease recurrence in 32 patients requiring cytoreductive therapy was 48%, somewhat greater than at initial diagnosis. A group of patients with low-grade lymphoma, who had treatment deferred after diagnosis or recurrence, was also studied; the incidence of PBL rearrangements was 38% in this population. Among 157 patients clinically free of disease, DNA analyses of the PBL were positive in only 10%. Subsequent relapse of disease in 26 patients was antedated by PBL rearrangement in only one patient. Clonal rearrangements detected in 15 patients have been followed by recurrence of clinical disease in only one patient over a median of 24 months from the time of analysis. The lack of detectable rearrangements in the peripheral blood in the majority of patients may be due to methodology or the biology of the disease. These issues may be further addressed with alternative methods for assessment of minimal disease. However, rigorous testing of any new molecular tool requires an adequate patient population in which disease status is closely monitored over a sufficient period of time.\r"

In this investigation, we explored the possibility that collaboration might exist between these cells. TIL-T were isolated from 39 lymph nodes of patients with NHL. In most of the cases, few of them (less than 10%) possessed surface activation receptors CD25 or OKT9. In 80% of the cases, they proliferated in response to recombinant interleukin-2 (rIL-2), but the degree of proliferation was often low as compared with control populations. The influence of irradiated autologous malignant cells on the TIL-T proliferation in response to rIL-2 (40 U/mL) was also investigated: in 38% of the cases, this proliferation was not modified (group O), and in 41% it was higher (group +) and in 21% it was lower (group -). The mechanism of this immune response (specific or not) is not elucidated at present. The definition of these groups was statistically correlated with different parameters of the disease: (1) percentage of TIL-T was higher in group + (44% +/- 17%) than in group O (31% +/- 18%) and group - (24% +/- 15%); (2) B-cell proliferation in centrofollicular lymphomas was more frequently nodular or nodular and diffuse in group + (83%) and O (55%) than in group - (0%); (3) low-grade malignancies in the Working Formulation were more frequent in group + (75%) than in group O (60%) or group - (12%); (4) favorable prognosis evaluated with the Grenoble cytologic classification was more frequent in group + and O (87%) than in group - (12%); (5) actuarial survival curves showed a significantly better prognosis for patients in group +.\r"

  ".W": "Cytogenetic and DNA flow cytometric analyses of leukemic cells from 2,184 children with newly diagnosed acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) identified 27 cases (1.2%) that had a hypodiploid line with fewer than 45 chromosomes per cell. Had cytogenetic techniques been used alone, seven cases would have been missed, compared with five if only flow cytometry had been used. For comparative purposes, the 27 cases were divided into three groups: near-haploid (n = 10), hypodiploid 30-40 (n = 9), and hypodiploid 41-44 (n = 8). Blast cells from patients with near-haploid ALL lacked structural chromosomal abnormalities; showed nonrandom retention of two copies of chromosomes 8, 10, 14, 18, 21, and the sex chromosomes; and had a second leukemic line with exactly twice the number of chromosomes or DNA content. Karyotypic analysis of the hypodiploid 30-40 and hypodiploid 41-44 groups disclosed structural abnormalities in the stemline or sideline of most of the well-banded cases; those in the latter group were similar to findings in cases with 45 chromosomes. As in the near-haploid group, chromosome 21 and the sex chromosomes were preferentially retained in the hypodiploid 30-40 and 41-44 cases. Except for a slight excess of female patients in the near-haploid group and an older age at diagnosis in the hypodiploid 30-40 cases, there were no initial clinical features that distinguished these patients from the general ALL population. Despite intensive treatment and short follow-up, 17 of the 27 patients have relapsed. This study suggests that the poor treatment responsiveness of hypodiploid ALL is not limited to the more than 80% of the patients who have 45 chromosomes per leukemic cell and demonstrates that cytogenetic and flow cytometric analyses are complementary in the evaluation of children with ALL.\r"

We studied the relationship between the amount of DAF on the membrane and cell maturity in total nucleated bone marrow (BM) cells, mature BM and peripheral blood (PB) neutrophils from normal subjects, and patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) using a fluorescence-activated cell sorter with anti-DAF monoclonal antibodies. Percentage distributions of differentiating neutrophils from normal total nucleated BM cells showed that the proportion of immature cells (myeloblasts plus promyelocytes) decreased, while that of mature ones (bands plus segmented forms) increased as the fluorescence intensity increased. For PB neutrophils, no apparent correlation was found between DAF expression and cell maturity. This may have resulted from margination of the fully matured neutrophils with a high amount of DAF. In PNH patients who have low levels of DAF, this study showed that DAF expression in their neutrophils differs from that in normal subjects, and abnormalities occur in PNH cells from a very early stem-cell stage.\r"

  ".W": "We report our experience from a clinical trial of autologous bone marrow transplantation (ABMT) in the treatment of 30 patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) using monoclonal antibody (MoAb) and complement-treated bone marrow. All patients were in complete remission (CR) at the time of transplant: 6 patients were in first CR, 18 in second CR, and 6 in third CR. The median age of all patients was 42 years (range 11 to 57 years). For marrow ablation, 28 patients were treated with cyclophosphamide and total body irradiation. One patient was treated with busulfan and cyclophosphamide and one was treated with busulfan and VP-16. Each patient was then transfused with autologous bone marrow that had been harvested previously and treated with two MoAbs, PM-81 and AML-2-23, and rabbit complement. Median time to recovery of neutrophils (500/microL) was 30 days, and platelets (20,000/microL) was 45 days. Median time for initial erythrocyte engraftment, assessed by a flow cytometric reticulocyte assay, was 13 days. Median overall and relapse-free survival of first CR patients was at least 17.4 months post-ABMT and the 2- and 3-year actuarial overall and relapse-free survival was 67% (+/- 19%). Median survival for the 24 patients in second or third CR was 6.8 months post-ABMT and 9.3 months since CR; however, six patients survived disease-free from 16 to 61 months post-ABMT. For the second and third CR group it was observed that six patients (5 of the 6 survivors) showed \"inversions,\" when their post-ABMT remission lasted longer than any previous one. Actuarial 2- and 3-year disease-free and overall survival of patients in second and third CR was 25% (+/- 9%) and 18% (+/- 9%), and 29% (+/- 9%) and 23% (+/- 9%), respectively. ABMT avoids the problems of graft-versus-host disease and of finding suitable donors for allogeneic marrow transplantation.\r"

Median plasma elastase-proteinase inhibitor complex (EPIC) and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels were also significantly higher in patients with RA than in normal individuals (P less than 0.00001) and active SLE (P less than 0.00001 for both EPIC and CRP). Elevations of LF, EPIC and CRP in RA were independent of rheumatoid factor titres. Plasma lactoferrin in RA correlated significantly with EPIC (Rs = 0.7, P less than 0.0001), CRP (Rx = 0.72, P less than 0.0001) and absolute neutrophil counts (Rs = 0.483, P less than 0.02), but surprisingly not with the Ritchie index, with which CRP showed a weak but significant correlation (Rs = 0.27, P less than 0.05 greater than 0.025). Thus plasma LF and EPIC are markers of inflammation in RA and their levels may reflect release of mediators of inflammation into the joint space and periarticular tissue.\r"

Normal epithelial tissues, including tonsillar epithelium, skin, small intestinal epithelium and salivary epithelium showed cellular staining. Synovium from patients with definite rheumatoid arthritis showed dense granular staining of macrophages. In addition, synovium from 9 of 12 patients with definite rheumatoid arthritis showed reticular extracellular staining indicating deposition of material bearing terminal GlcNAc in the connective tissue stroma. The extracellular staining was not seen in synovium from patients with osteoarthritis. Extracellular material bearing terminal GlcNAc may act as an inflammatory stimulus in rheumatoid arthritis, either by acting as antigen or by interaction with receptors on macrophage membranes which also recognize GlcNAc on bacterial material, thus triggering biochemical pathways normally occurring in response to the presence of micro-organisms.\r"

The tissue has histological characteristics of a foreign body reaction presumably initiated by repetitive microtrauma-associated release of methacrylate cement and polyethylene wear debris. Explant cultures of pseudomembrane and synovial tissue derived from osteoarthritic patients undergoing revision for cemented hip implant failure have been shown to produce interleukin-1, tumour necrosis factor and prostaglandin E2, recognized mediators of bone resorption. Further, the conditioned media obtained from pseudomembrane cultures could directly effect bone resorption by inducing 45Ca release from prelabelled limb bone rudiments. Results implicate the prosthesis-associated pseudomembrane in the pathogenesis of the bone resorptive process responsible for prosthesis failure.\r"

Following an initial assessment period, patients were treated with sulphasalazine for 24 weeks and the drug was then withdrawn and the patients monitored for a further 12 weeks. Significant improvements were observed in chest expansion, number of active joints, ESR and CRP which deteriorated after withdrawal of sulphasalazine. No change in spinal mobility was demonstrated. The 'interventional' design may be a useful screening procedure for identifying potential second line drugs in ankylosing spondylitis.\r"

This study investigates the outcome of 179 general practitioner referrals to two rheumatology clinics during 1987. Forty-one (34%) of the rheumatoid arthritis patients and six (10%) of the osteoarthritis patients made four or more visits. Junior staff discharged far fewer (11-18%) of patients than did consultants (34%). Multiple linear and multiple logistic regression analyses were performed for the demographic and clinical variables which seemed (on univariate analyses) to predict continuing attendance. The maximum disease severity, diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis, male sex, patient's perceived reason for referral and the hospital clinic only explained 21% of the variation in the number of visits made. Most of the factors influencing hospital clinic doctors are not easily apparent. The data suggested only one method of reducing unnecessary out-patient attendances, namely to increase the number of patients seen by a consultant. Differences in 'clinic policies' and individual doctor's decision-making strategies will require further study.\r"

Elevated levels of FVIII Rag were found in 62% of patients with systemic sclerosis (SS), 38% with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), 67% with mixed connective tissue disease (MCTD) and in 17% with primary Raynaud's phenomenon. Twenty per cent of first degree relatives of patients with SS also demonstrated high levels of FVIII Rag and certain antibodies, namely those reacting with U1RNP and the centromere. The association between elevated FVIII Rag and antibodies linked to Raynaud's and vasculitis lends support to antibody involvement in pathogenesis. High levels of FVIII Rag in family members may reflect an increased susceptibility of endothelium to injury particularly since relatives also have a higher frequency of clinical features such as Raynaud's phenomenon.\r"

In 1983, representatives of the Royal College of Radiologists met neurosurgeons at a seminar in Harrogate organized by the DHSS and laid down clear, but little publicized, joint recommendations: \"The Harrogate Criteria\". The survey described here evaluated an existing liberal policy for skull radiography (and a loose policy for admissions) against these recommendations, and it was concluded that the number of patients having skull radiography (74% of head injury attenders) was excessive. Measured against the \"Harrogate Criteria\", requests for 36% of the adult and 47% of children's skull radiographs did not fulfil these criteria. As a corollary, it was also concluded that loose admissions policies could usefully be altered to comply more closely with the Harrogate recommendations. This would not necessarily reduce the numbers admitted, but would provide casualty officers with a framework on which to base this crucial aspect of clinical decision making, where presently there is often very little structure at all. The authors suggest that all the options have not been fully explored, and that a simple but important alteration to the Harrogate guidelines would provide an even closer link between policy on skull radiography and patient admission. Specifically, most patients who are to be admitted do not need skull radiographs.\r"

The NEXT protocol for the postero-anterior chest projection was modified and expanded to make it both \"statistical\" and \"investigational\" (in the US, NEXT gives mainly \"statistical\" information). All chest X-ray units in Sweden were surveyed in 1986-87. The project showed that the NEXT programme is applicable to countries other than the United States and provides a standardized protocol that enables intercomparison of the radiological techniques. This paper presents the comparison of the radiological techniques used in Sweden and the United States. The results of the investigational modifications made to the protocol used in Sweden are discussed. Recommendations concerning expansion of the NEXT protocol to include these valuable tools for investigational surveys are presented.\r"

Changes in the gas-exchange capacity of an irradiated volume of lung were compared with a similar volume of unirradiated lung in each animal. The results from the lung function tests were converted into quantal data on the basis of the percentage of lung function tests in animals showing a greater than or equal to 15% impairment of function in the irradiated lung compared with contralateral unirradiated lung in the same animal. From those quantal data, ED50 values (+/- SE) were obtained for each fractionation schedule. These ED50 values were used to determine time-dose-fractionation relationships for both early and late radiation-induced damage to the lung. There was apparently no recovery phase between the early and late phases of damage to the lung. In general, ED50 values for the late effect were slightly lower than those for the early effect, but this only proved significant when measurements obtained at 4 weeks after treatment were included. Varying the period for the assessment of early and late damage did not have a major effect on the results but did suggest that late damage was established in pigs by 39 weeks after irradiation. The linear-quadratic model did not provide a satisfactory fit to the fractionation results for pig lung. However, a modified nominal standard dose equation did provide a better description of the findings. A value of 0.44 +/- 0.06 was obtained for N exponent in the equation for both early and late lung damage when the single-dose data points were included in the analysis. The value of the N exponent was increased to 0.52 +/- 0.08 when the single-dose data were excluded. This increase was not significant.\r"

The significant factors affecting survival were found using Cox multivariate analysis, N and T stages, the size and degree of fixation of neck nodes, sex, age, the presence of cranial nerve palsy and ear symptoms at presentation. Bilateral neck node involvement, histology subtypes of tumour, headache and nasal symptoms at presentation, the difference in radiation dose to the primary tumour and the neck, the initial haemoglobin and white blood count were not significant factors in the present study. The N stage was found to be prognostically significant even among patient groups stratified for the size and degree of fixation of the neck nodes involved. Women had a better survival rate than men, and the survival of patients less than 40 years old was better than those who were older at 5 years, although by 10 years the survival for the two groups was comparable.\r"

The mean amount of recession was 10.8 mm. The procedure was successful (10 delta or less of horizontal deviation at 6 months) in 23 patients (68%). In all but one case failure was due to undercorrection. The success rate was 81% in the small-angle deviation group, compared with 29% in the large-angle deviation group (p less than 0.01). The average amount of deviation before surgery was 54.4 delta in the surgical success group and 65.0 delta in the undercorrection group (p less than 0.02). More surgery should be done in patients with larger deviations. Prospective randomized studies are needed to evaluate the efficacy of recession from the limbus versus recession from the insertion site.\r"

The results were analysed with an F-test analysis of variance. The Keta tonometer significantly underread the IOP and was totally unreliable in patients with glaucoma. Our results indicate that Keta tonometry should not be used for the screening and management of glaucoma.\r"

Defined stages in the keratopathy included punctate epithelial keratopathy, pseudodendrite, central epithelial ulcer and central stromal ulcer. Periods of up to 13 months were required for resolution of the defects. Axial scarring and nonhealing epithelial defects resulted in a final visual acuity of counting fingers and hand movement in two patients. We believe that exposure during the postoperative period to benzalkonium chloride contained in ophthalmic medications represents the most likely cause of the toxic changes and that no single ophthalmic medication can be held responsible. The past ocular histories of the patients included chronic open-angle glaucoma, dry eye syndrome and anterior membrane dystrophy. Prior exposure to benzalkonium-containing antiglaucoma medications, tear film deficiencies or abnormalities of epithelial adhesion may have predisposed the corneas in these patients to the development of benzalkonium-related toxic changes.\r"

The absorbance of each well was measured at a scanning microplate photometer. When we made the table of the cytotoxicity index (CI) that was classified into anti-cancer drugs and concentrations for each leukemic sample, it was possible to compare efficacy with different drugs and to select the effective ones. Retrospectively, the in vitro results were compared with the clinical responses of the 34 patients (26 of acute lymphocytic leukemia [ALL] and eight of acute nonlymphoblastic leukemia [ANLL]) who were treated by combination chemotherapy. The following results were obtained: true-positive rate, 78.1%; true-negative rate, 57.1%; and predictive accuracy, 74.4%. Therefore, the MTT assay-CI table might serve as a reliable tool for the selection of effective chemotherapy in patients with acute leukemia.\r"

No hematologic, biochemical, or significant clinical toxicity was encountered. Endocrinologic and pharmacologic data were available from 12 of these patients. Maximum inhibition of estrogen biosynthesis was observed at a dose of 2 mg CGS 16949A daily. At this dose, the inhibition of estrogen biosynthesis was equivalent to 1000 mg aminoglutethimide (AG). The fall in plasma and urinary estrogens without a concomitant drop in androgens confirmed the specific blockade of aromatase activity. At doses of 4 to 16 mg daily, CGS 16949A appeared to inhibit the C21-hydroxylase enzyme as well. The t1/2 of CGS 16949A in the circulation was 10.5 hours.

  ".U": "90167587\r", 
  ".W": "Bleomycin is well recognized as an active antineoplastic agent in the treatment of germ cell tumors. Pulmonary toxicity is the most significant complication of bleomycin administration. In this report, an attempt is made to modify both the incidence and severity of this side effect. One hundred eleven patients with advanced germ cell tumors were treated with a combination chemotherapy program that included the administration of 30 units (U) of bleomycin as a continuous infusion daily for 3 days every 3 weeks rather than a weekly bolus injection of a total of 360 U (mean dose received, 307 U). Also, 31 patients received high-dose steroids, which have been shown to modify bleomycin-induced pulmonary toxicity, for the treatment of chemotherapy-induced emesis. Changes in carbon monoxide diffusion capacity (DLCO) prompting cessation of bleomycin therapy occurred in 15 cases (bleomycin was stopped in one case due to dyspnea and lung infiltrates, and one patient suffered fatal respiratory failure probably due to bleomycin lung toxicity). Thus, probable bleomycin pulmonary toxicity changed the clinical treatment in 15.3% of the cases. On long-term follow-up, only two patients have demonstrated a residual decrease in DLCO. The incidence of a greater than 25% decrease in DLCO was 34% and was not significantly altered by the administration of steroids (P = 0.96). It is possible, however, that the low incidence of clinically significant and fatal pulmonary toxicity, as experienced in this group of patients, may be related to the infusion of bleomycin. It also is possible that the reversibility of the decrease in DLCO in 95% of the patients may be related to the duration and schedule of bleomycin administration. As bleomycin continues to be an important drug in the treatment of advanced germ cell tumors, further studies are warranted to evaluate the role of the continuous infusion of bleomycin as opposed to bolus therapy.\r"

The median patient age was 56 years. In 15 cases lung cancer was the primary site (7 adenocarcinomas, 3 squamous cell carcinomas, 3 large cell carcinomas, and 2 small cell carcinomas) and in 1 case there was an unknown primary (squamous cell carcinoma). Ten of 16 patients were treated with 3000 cGy to opposed anterior and posterior fields (300-cGy fractions [four patients] and 250-cGy fractions [six patients]). The remaining six patients were treated with a variety of techniques, with total doses ranging from 2925 cGy to 4500 cGy. The patients were analyzed for response at their first follow-up visit (2 to 4 weeks after treatment). The overall response rate was 75% (12 of 16 patients). Six patients (38%) had complete pain relief without medication that lasted until death. Two patients had marked pain relief, but still required analgesics. Four patients had marked or moderate pain relief that did not continue through follow-up. Four patients had minimal to no response. All patients were observed until death, with a median survival time after irradiation of 3 months (range, 0.5 to 11 months). Although the prognosis for patients with adrenal metastases is poor, radiotherapy to symptomatic adrenal metastases can be administered with a high probability of achieving effective palliation.\r"

Using a arbitrary limit of 2.2 ng/ml, pathologic serum levels of SCC were observed in 15 (38%) of 40 untreated patients, whereas only four (7.7%) of 52 tumor-free patients revealed an elevated serum SCC. Serial measurements of SCC were pretherapeutically available in 28 patients as well as during individual therapy and further follow-up. All but one of these patients had a normal serum SCC postoperatively. The authors' results demonstrate that the clinical value of SCC lies mainly in monitoring the course of the disease. Careful follow-up studies should be undertaken to determine whether serial determination of SCC is promising in early prediction of tumor reoccurrence.\r"

Of 20 patients with 90-K levels below the normal limit, 12 went over the normal cutoff value after two rIFN alpha-2b injections. No significant modifications of 90-K levels were detected in nine women receiving rIFN alpha-2b for the treatment of genital condylomata. The serum levels of two other tumor-associated antigens, CA 125 and CA 15-3, were not modified by rIFN alpha-2b administration. The ability of rIFN alpha-2b to increase the circulating levels of 90-K might have important clinical implications for the serodetection of cancer.\r"

Human colon cancer cells were grown in a capillary culture system to provide unaltered antigens for the development of a specific antibody. The antibody was labeled with iodine 125 (125I) and used to analyze the antigen component of IC removed from whole serum. The assay was positive in 50% and 88% of known Dukes' A and Dukes' B colon cancer patients, respectively. It was also positive for only 25% of Dukes' C and 14% of Dukes' D patients, possibly because of the decreased quantity of specific IC found in the late stages of colon cancer. A blind study of patients referred for colonoscopy compared pathology diagnosis with the test results. The assay was positive for one patient with a polypoid adenocarcinoma (Dukes' B) and one with a villous adenoma and negative for 38 patients with benign polyps and 43 with no polyps. The assay was negative for all patients with stomach cancer and inflammatory bowel diseases and positive for about 10% of the patients with pancreas or breast cancer. The results of this preliminary investigation suggest that this radioimmunoassay may be useful for the detection of the early stages of colon cancer.\r"

All of them had morphologic myelodysplasia in trilineage of bone marrow cells, and cytopenia was the major finding in the peripheral blood. All six patients had symptoms of infection at the time of diagnosis, and five showed immunologic abnormalities (polyclonal hypergammaglobulinemia in four and increased marrow plasma cells in three). None of the patients survived more than 11 months after the diagnosis; the median survival time was 4 months. Both of the two patients whose karyotypes were reexamined in the course of their disease showed karyotypic evolution accompanying the coincidental leukemic transformation. Six patients with MDS who had the same chromosome abnormality [t(1;7)] are described and their characteristic clinical features are presented.\r"

To investigate the interrelationships between these two parameters, tumor samples from 18 patients with neuroblastoma were analyzed for both total DNA and N-myc gene content. Quantitative DNA analysis was performed by image analysis. Quantitative Southern blot hybridization was used to determine N-myc gene copy number and to distinguish between low level gene amplification or excess gene copies secondary to aneuploidy. Six of the 18 patients have died. Five of the six had nonaneuploid tumors, but only two of the six exhibited major N-myc amplification. Low-level amplification was detected in one Stage II patient. The authors' results suggest that neuroblastomas with N-myc amplification are a subset of nonaneuploid tumors.\r"

The results were compared according to histologic type or clinical stage of the tumor. In addition, electron microscopic observation was done to clarify the extracellular structure of thymoma. Two staining patterns were seen. First, a diffusely or partially intricate network of fibers that contained fibronectin and laminin surrounded tumor cells in 21 out of 55 cases. Most of these cases were spindle cell thymomas and showed low invasive tumors. Second, fibers that contained fibronectin and laminin were restricted only to the septa, blood vessels, and perivascular spaces that did not show a network in the remaining 34 cases. Polygonal cell thymomas showed the latter staining pattern and these were more invasive tumors. We conclude that this network is a characteristic structure of spindle cell thymomas and is related to the invasiveness of the tumor.\r"

Each patient underwent drill biopsy and subsequently mastectomy. The drill biopsy and surgical specimens were assayed for the total ER and PR levels (cytosolic plus nuclear fraction) by enzyme immunoassay. Between the drill biopsy and mastectomy, ten patients received no treatment (control group) and the other ten patients were given MPA (1200 mg/day) for 7 days. In the control group, the total ER and PR levels of the surgical specimens decreased by 68.2 +/- 7.3% and 60.7 +/- 8.4%, respectively, taking the receptor values of the drill biopsy specimens as 100%, although no treatment was given preoperatively. This decrease seems to be attributable to the receptor degradation due to damages occurring during mastectomy. In the MPA group, the total ER and PR levels of the surgical specimens decreased by 64.2 +/- 8.0% and 23.3 +/- 7.6%, respectively. The decrease in PR, but not ER, was statistically significant between the control and MPA groups (P less than 0.01). These results demonstrate that MPA down regulates PR but not ER in human breast cancer and challenge the conventional idea, extrapolated from the results on the endometrium and endometrial cancer, that MPA antagonizes endogenous estrogens by down regulating ER.\r"

All differences were statistically clearly significant. However, the sensitivity of NSE in serum at response was 66% and at recurrence, 38%. The predictive value of an NSE decrease at response was 88%, and at recurrence, 72%. It is concluded that NSE changes during follow-up support the evaluation of the outcome but cannot be used as a monitoring agent in an individual patient.\r"

  ".W": "Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) may be potentially curable. A correct diagnosis of cancer cell type is important and serum markers are of great value. Although several markers have been suggested, they have been of limited value because of insufficient specificity. To assess the value of serum neuron-specific enolase (S-NSE) as a possible marker of SCLC, the serum levels of 81 patients with SCLC (59 patients with extensive disease and 22 patients with limited disease) were compared with the serum levels of patients with non-small cell lung cancer (N-SCLC) and 93 patients with nonmalignant lung diseases. The S-NSE level also was measured in 104 patients with extensive disease of various other malignancies, including 71 solid tumors and 33 malignant hematologic disorders. From 105 healthy control subjects, the upper limit of the normal range (x + 2 standard deviations [SD]) was determined as 12.3 ng/ml. The S-NSE level was elevated in 78% of patients with SCLC, including 11 of 22 (50%) with limited disease and 52 of 59 (88%) with extensive disease. In contrast, the S-NSE level was raised only in 18% of patients with advanced N-SCLC (nine of 50) and 6% of patients with nonmalignant lung diseases (six of 93). Twelve patients (17%) with other solid malignant tumors and two patients (6%) with malignant hematologic disorders had raised S-NSE levels. Serial N-NSE levels were obtained in 13 patients with SCLC. S-NSE levels fell in all patients responding to chemotherapy and increased again with progression of disease. Our results indicate that S-NSE seems to be specific for SCLC (85%), whereas sensitivity seems to be dependent on the stage of disease. Further, S-NSE may be a useful marker for monitoring treatment and predicting relapse in patients with SCLC.\r"

A better 5-year survival rate was observed in Group A (DNA diploidy, 69.6%) than in Group B (DNA aneuploidy and DNA peridiploidy, 33.2%; P less than 0.001). The survival curves of the patients in Group B continued to decrease during the next 2.5 years. Cox's model analysis showed that both the pathologic stage and the DNA content were the significant prognostic factors for survival. However, the DNA content was an independent prognostic factor in squamous cell carcinoma, but not in adenocarcinoma. These results indicate that DNA content analysis is useful for the evaluation of clinical behavior and prognosis, and that the clinical value of the DNA content must be differentiated between squamous cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma.\r"

The level of progesterone receptors (PgR), estrogen receptors (ER), and androgen receptors (AdR) in the superficial part of gastric cancer tissues (CAs) from 16 patients was determined and compared with that of the corresponding normal gastric mucosal tissues (NLm). There were PgR in all CAs (100%) with values that ranged from 20.5 to 548.4 fmol/mg protein. Eight CAs (50%) had ER values that ranged from 6.8 to 325.1 fmol/mg protein. AdR was found in two CAs with values of 14.7 and 16.4 fmol/mg protein. In NLm, 15 (93.8%) had PgR values that ranged from 7.3 to 473.2 fmol/mg protein and ten (62.5%) had ER values that ranged from 0.9 to 87.9 fmol/mg protein. AdR were present in two NLm with values of 1.5 and 73.5 fmol/mg protein. There was no statistical difference in levels of PgR and ER between CAs and NLm. There were PgR in all gastric cancers and in 93.8% of NLm. The results suggest that gastric mucosa may be the target tissues for progesterone action. Furthermore, the lack of correlation between the levels of ER and PgR in gastric cancer tissue suggests that the PgR in gastric cancers are probably estrogen independent.\r"

The former type was prone to develop in a rather advanced stage of the disease, as indicated by short survival time, large tumor size, aggressive modes of intrahepatic spreading, and frequent metastasis. Histologically, the area of squamous cell carcinoma ranged from focal to overwhelming. The occurrence of the squamous element could be interpreted as the result of the metaplastic transformation of adenocarcinoma cells because of the intimate coexistence of the two types in the primary and metastatic lesions. It also was suggested that anaplastic carcinoma cells could sometimes differentiate into squamous cell carcinoma. In no instances was there any squamous metaplasia of the bile ducts demonstrated; therefore, there was no supporting evidence for the possibility of squamous metaplasia of the bile duct epithelium and subsequent malignant transformation.\r"

Radiographs generally showed poor margination, suggestive of malignancy. Histologically, the tumors were composed of spindle cells with only minimal atypia. Some tumors had bone spicules similar to those seen in fibrous dysplasia. An invasive growth pattern was the most helpful feature in differentiating low-grade osteosarcoma from fibrous dysplasia. Initial treatment was highly variable. Local excision was almost always associated with recurrence. Wide excision was almost never followed by recurrence. The recurrent tumor was a high-grade, conventional osteosarcoma in 15% of the patients, and this was associated with a poor prognosis. Wide excision seems to be the treatment of choice for this very rare variant of osteosarcoma.\r"

Of a total of 208 pediatric patients with NHL studied, 20 (9.6%) had primary NPOP. Sixty percent of the patients had Stage I and II disease. Primary sites were maxillary sinus in eight patients; tonsils in eight; posterior pharynx in two; mandible in one; and orbit in one patient. Histologically, the disease is different than that of the adults since most patients had B-cell lymphomas of the diffuse undifferentiated type (Rappaport) or small cell non-cleaved types (Lukes-Collins, Kiel, and Working Formulation). None of these patients had gastrointestinal involvement. All patients were treated with the LSA2-L2 regimen and radiation therapy was given to primary unresectable tumors and regional metastases. The lymphoma event-free survival was 75%, with a median observation period of 99+ months. In staging systems that refer mostly to amount of disease outside of the primary (such as ours, Murphy's, and the Ann Arbor staging systems) stage did not correlate well with disease-free survival. In the TNM staging of 1977, a staging system that refers to size of primary tumor as well as regional and systemic disease, stage correlated better with prognosis and survival. In our staging system, eight of 12 patients (66.7%) with Stage I and II disease; four of four with Stage III; two of two with Stage IVA; and zero of two with Stage IVB survived. In the TNM staging system, three of three patients with Stage II and III disease and 12 of 18 patients (67%) with Stage IV disease survived. All recurrences occurred early suggesting that early intensification of chemotherapy may produce better results.\r"

In 100 patients (86 males, mean age 56 +/- 9 years) DSA was performed with a Siemens Digitron 2 device. A frontal projection was used in 18 patients, and a 10-20 degree right anterior oblique projection was used in 82 patients. The flow was 10 to 25 ml/sec; 20 ml was injected in 45 patients, 30 ml in 41, 40 ml in 5, 50 ml in 8, and 60 ml in 1 patient. Judged on the proximal third, visualization of the left and the right internal mammary artery was good in 80 and 72, fair in 17 and 20, and bad in 3 and 8 arteries, respectively. The diameter (mm) was 2.7 +/- 0.4 (range 1.8-3.4) and 2.7 +/- 0.3 (range 2.0-3.5), and visible length (cm) was 8 +/- 5 (range 1-24) and 9 +/- 4 (range 2-22) for the two arteries, respectively. The 10-20 degree right anterior oblique view separated the left internal mammary artery better from the descending aorta than the frontal view. In more pronounced right anterior oblique views the ascending aorta interfered with the right internal mammary artery. The quality was not different with 20 ml or 30 ml injections. The feeding arteries could not be assessed in 4 patients. One left subclavian artery was found occluded at the orifice. Incidentally, 2 distal right subclavian stenoses and 2 carotid stenoses were detected.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Cholesterol levels were higher in younger and female subjects (less than 0.0001). Initial cholesterol did not predict restenosis, and follow-up cholesterol levels showed an inverse relationship with restenosis (P less than .02). There was a trend (P less than .09) toward decreased restenosis in those who were active smokers at the time of follow-up catheterization. No differences were seen in diabetics with hyperglycemia, in both treated and untreated groups (P = NS). A stepwise multiple logistic regression was used to simultaneously test the association of the above risk factor variables to restenosis. None of the interactions were found to be significant, except cholesterol at follow-up (P = .001). Therefore, the status of serum cholesterol, blood sugar, smoking, and weight during the time of PTCA and at follow-up catheterization may be unimportant in predicting restenosis. Thus, we conclude 1) that to better determine the effect of these variables on restenosis, they should be estimated at times other than follow-up and 2) that the pathophysiological mechanism of restenosis may have different risk factors than progression of atherosclerotic coronary artery disease.\r"

Isovue-370 is a new low osmolar nonionic contrast medium lacking calcium binding additives. The present investigation compared the incidence of contrast media-induced ventricular fibrillation in patients undergoing coronary angiography with Renografin-76 to that with Isovue-370. Group I consisted of 2,000 consecutive patients undergoing coronary angiography with Renografin-76, and group II consisted of 2,000 subsequent consecutive patients in whom Isovue-370 was employed as the contrast medium. There was no significant difference between groups I and II with respect to volume of contrast media used per patient (125 +/- 35 vs. 140 +/- 45 ml), age (63.5 +/- 15 vs. 60 +/- 17 years), sex (74% male vs. 76% male), ejection fraction (55% vs. 55%), valvular heart disease (8% vs. 9%), prior coronary artery bypass graft surgery (5.8% vs. 5%), or extent of coronary artery disease. Contrast media-induced ventricular fibrillation occurred in 20 patients in group I (incidence 1%), whereas eight episodes occurred in group II (incidence 0.4%) (P less than 0.03). Thus the present investigation suggests that the incidence of ventricular fibrillation during coronary angiography can be significantly decreased by using low osmolar nonionic contrast media lacking calcium binding additives.\r"

Accurate localization of the tip of central venous catheters at the time of placement should minimize catheter-related complications, including the rare complication of venobronchial fistula. After placement of chronic central venous catheters, biplanar chest X-rays should be obtained to determine catheter tip location prior to the instillation of chemotherapeutic agents. Any residual questions concerning the catheter tip location after biplanar X-rays should be addressed by prompt venography through the catheter.\r"

Seven patients not responding to ACLS following cardiac arrest in the catheterization laboratory underwent percutaneously instituted cardiopulmonary bypass support. Cardiac arrest occurred following abrupt closure postcoronary angioplasty in three patients, during cardiogenic shock in three patients, and during diagnostic angiography in one patient. Cardiopulmonary bypass was instituted 10-45 min (mean, 21 min) following the onset of cardiac arrest. Flows on bypass ranged from 4.0 to 5.2 liter/min. Mean blood pressure ranged from 70 to 110 mm Hg on bypass. Six of the seven patients regained consciousness after the institution of bypass. Acid-base balance was normalized in all patients. Coronary bypass surgery was subsequently performed in three patients and coronary angioplasty in two. Four patients survived. One patient died following coronary bypass surgery. Two patients, who were not suitable candidates for revascularization, expired. Total bypass time was 1.5-8.5 hr (mean, 2.7 hr). At a mean follow-up of 6 months, all four survivors are alive and asymptomatic or NYHA class 1. We conclude that cardiopulmonary bypass support 1) can stabilize patients following cardiac arrest in the catheterization laboratory, 2) can facilitate emergency coronary angioplasty or transfer to the operating room for coronary bypass surgery, and (3) can improve survival in patients unresponsive to ACLS when instituted early following cardiac arrest in the catheterization laboratory.\r"

Observed improvements in peak systolic gradient (81.6 +/- 29.9 mm Hg vs. 35.5 +/- 16.0 mm Hg, P less than 0.000001) and aortic valve area (0.6 +/- 0.4 cm2 vs. 1.0 +/- 0.6 cm2, P less than 0.00001) were similar to those achieved in a control group (C) of 17 patients in which no femoral sheath was used. However, a shorter procedure duration (211 +/- 81 min vs. 117 +/- 30 min, P less than 0.001) and a reduced rate of vascular complications at the femoral puncture site (41% vs. 6.5%) were observed in patients in whom the long sheath (LS) technique was used. The frequency of other PTAV-related complications was comparable (C = 35%, LS = 29%, P = n.s.). Other technical advantages of this device are: 1) prevention of looping and bending of the balloon catheter in tortuous vessels and easy positioning of the balloon across the aortic orifice provided by the LS trackability, 2) stabilisation of the balloon during inflation, 3) monitoring of supravalvular aortic pressure provided by the side-arm of the LS and reliable measurement of systolic gradient, and 4) the ability to perform aortograms without the need of another catheter in the ascending aorta. Thus, in our experience, the long sheath technique is a valuable adjunct for PTAV.\r"

A catheter with a 90 degrees primary curve was usually the best choice for angioplasty of the VG to the right coronary artery (RCA). For angioplasty of the VG to the left coronary artery branches (LCA), a 90 degrees primary curve was used when the proximal segment of the VG was oriented horizontally and a 75 degrees (USCI, C.R. Bard, Inc., Billerica, MA) was used when the proximal segment was directed superiorly. Angioplasty of 32 lesions was attempted in 31 patients. These catheters provided good \"back-up\" in angioplasty of 30 lesions (94%). The lesions were crossed with balloon catheters in 29 cases (91%). There was one acute VG occlusion requiring coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery, a complication not attributed to the guiding catheter. We conclude that Arani guiding catheters provide strong back-up, are helpful in angioplasty of the vein grafts, and could be used as the primary choice for VG angioplasties.\r"

The treatment of choice for this complication is a new dilation, but unfortunately many of these cases require immediate surgery to avoid an acute myocardial infarction. Prolonged balloon inflations have been suggested to control this kind of complication. In order to discover the effect of prolonged inflations on the incidence of unstable lesions we studied 439 patients enrolled in two groups: Group I (195 patients and 207 arteries) treated with balloon inflation time less than 40 sec per session and Group II (244 patients and 265 arteries) treated with inflation time over 60 sec since the first series of inflations. As a result there was a significantly lower incidence of unstable lesions and immediate surgery in Group II without an increase in the incidence of diffuse ischemia.\r"

Nine patients in the 5F group required a change to 7/8F catheters for completion of the procedure. There was no difference in procedure time or fluoroscopy time between the groups. Time to haemostasis was significantly shorter in the 5F group (P less than .01), but there was no difference between groups with respect to haematoma formation or rebleed after haemostasis. We conclude the slight advantage of 5F catheters in terms of haemostasis is outweighed by many disadvantages. Their routine use in cardiac catheterization, at least at this time, cannot be recommended.\r"

  ".W": "Alternans in heart is important as pulsus alternans in cardiac failure and electrophysiological alternans in myocardial ischemia. The explanation of this phenomenon is still unclear. We attempted to investigate the cellular mechanisms of alternans by measuring intracellular free calcium concentration [( Ca2+]i) with the photoprotein aequorin in isolated ferret papillary muscles. Tension and length were also recorded simultaneously. Transient mechanical alternans lasting five to 20 contractions could be reliably induced in this preparation by following a 30-second rest period with stimulation at a fast rate (2-4 Hz). Production of sustained mechanical alternans, which lasted longer than 20 contractions and could persist for several hundred contractions, required additional interventions, consisting of a lower temperature (25 degrees C), a lower external calcium concentration (1 mM), and a lower pH (6.91) than control conditions (0.33-0.5 Hz, 30 degrees C, 2 mM Ca2+, pH 7.36). Transient mechanical alternans was associated with transient in-phase alternation of aequorin light and, hence, [Ca2+]i. Sustained mechanical alternans was associated with sustained in-phase alternation of aequorin light as well as incomplete relaxation of tension. However, when muscles were switched from isometric to unloaded isotonic contraction, relaxation between stimuli was complete but contraction and the aequorin light signal continued to alternate. The addition of 10 mM caffeine or 10 microns ryanodine abolished transient and sustained mechanical alternans and also abolished the associated alternation of aequorin light. Commensurate with the action of ryanodine, which allows the sarcoplasmic reticulum to reaccumulate calcium to a limited extent after a period of rapid stimulation, sustained mechanical alternans sometimes reappeared in an attenuated form 30 to 50 contractions after the addition of ryanodine. These results demonstrate that incomplete muscle relaxation between beats need not be present for alternans to occur, and support the hypothesis that alternans is caused by intracellular calcium cycling involving the sarcoplasmic reticulum.\r"

  ".W": "Intracoronary infusions of activated complement C5a result in myocardial ischemia, contractile dysfunction, and leukocyte accumulation. The hypothesis was tested that the generation of the coronary vasoconstrictors, thromboxane A2 and the 5-lipoxygenase leukotrienes (LTC4 and LTD4), contributes to the C5a-induced decrease in coronary blood flow and contractile function. The left anterior descending coronary artery in anesthetized swine was cannulated and servo pump-perfused with arterial blood at constant pressure and measured flow. Regional subendocardial contractile function was assessed with sonomicrometry. The interventricular vein was cannulated for sampling of coronary venous blood for leukocyte count. The responses in left anterior descending coronary artery blood flow and percent segment shortening to intracoronary infusions of LTC4 (1 microgram), LTD4 (1 microgram), thromboxane agonist U46619 (7.5 micrograms), and C5a (500 ng) were assessed before and after 1) LTD4/LTE4 receptor blockade with leukotriene receptor blocker LY171883 (10 mg/kg i.v.) (n = 5), 2) thromboxane A2/prostaglandin H2 receptor blockade with thromboxane receptor blocker BM13505 (2 mg/kg i.v.) (n = 5), and 3) combined thromboxane and leukotriene receptor blockade (n = 5). In the absence of receptor blockade, intracoronary C5a decreased coronary flow (50-60%) and regional segment function (60-70%) compared with the preinfusion levels. This was accompanied by a fall in coronary venous blood leukocyte levels by 5-6 x 10(6) cells/ml in the absence of alterations in arterial blood leukocyte count. Intracoronary injections of LTD4, LTC4, or U46619 also resulted in prompt decreases in coronary blood flow (50-60%) and segment function (70-80%) from preinfusion levels. Leukotriene receptor blockade with LY171883 abolished these responses to LTD4 and LTC4. Administration of LY171883 also attenuated (p less than 0.05) the myocardial response to C5a; coronary flow and segment function decreased by approximately 28% from preinfusion levels. Thromboxane receptor blockade with BM13505 eliminated the response in coronary flow and segment function to intracoronary U46619. Similar to LY171883, administration of BM13505 blunted (p less than 0.05) the C5a-induced decreases in coronary flow and contractile function, which fell by approximately 20-25% from the preinfusion level. After the combined LTD4/LTE4 receptor and thromboxane A2/prostaglandin H2 receptor blockade, intracoronary C5a resulted in little change in both coronary blood flow and segment shortening. In contrast to the flow and function effects, the C5a-induced myocardial leukocyte extraction was not decreased by leukotriene and/or thromboxane receptor blockade.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "We examined the effects of intracellular acidosis produced by washout of NH4Cl on [Ca2+]i transients (indo-1 fluorescence), cell contraction (video motion detector), and 45Ca and 24Na fluxes in cultured chick embryo ventricular myocytes. Exposure of cells to 10 mM NH4Cl produced intracellular alkalosis (pH 7.6), and subsequent washout resulted in a transient acidosis (pH 6.5). Exposure to 10 mM NH4Cl slightly decreased [Ca2+]i transients but increased the amplitude of cell contraction. Subsequent washout of NH4Cl initially increased diastolic [Ca2+]i and decreased the peak positive and negative d[Ca2+]i/dt, while the amplitude of cell contraction was markedly decreased. Subsequently, peak systolic [Ca2+]i increased with partial recovery of contraction. A similar increase in [Ca2+]i and decrease in contraction after washout of NH4Cl was observed in single paced adult guinea pig ventricular cells. Acidosis decreased 45Ca uptake by sarcoplasmic reticulum vesicles isolated from chick embryo ventricle. However, the [Ca2+]i increase caused by intracellular acidosis was also observed in the presence of 10 mM caffeine, suggesting that altered sarcoplasmic reticulum handling of calcium is not the only mechanism involved. Intracellular acidosis only slightly increased total 24Na uptake under these conditions, an effect resulting from the combination of a stimulation of amiloride-sensitive sodium influx (Na(+)-H+ exchange) and inhibition of sodium influx via Na(+)-Ca2+ exchange, manifested by a significant decrease in 45Ca efflux. Further support for a lack of involvement of an increased [Na+]i in the observed increase in [Ca2+]i during acidosis was low-sodium, nominal 0-calcium extracellular solution, an experimental condition that minimizes the possible effects of Na(+)-H+ exchange and Na(+)-Ca2+ exchange. We conclude that the [Ca2+]i increase caused by intracellular acidosis in cultured ventricular cells is primarily due to changes in [Ca2+]i buffering and [Ca2+]i extrusion, rather than to an increase in transsarcolemmal calcium influx. Intracellular acidosis also markedly decreases the sensitivity of the contractile elements to [Ca2+]i in cultured chick embryonic and adult guinea pig ventricular myocytes.\r"

We find that acetylcholine has no effect on If in the absence of isoproterenol. However, if If is first increased by beta-agonist stimulation, acetylcholine can then return If to control levels. This effect on If is exerted through muscarinic receptors since atropine prevents this action of acetylcholine. Functionally, this action of acetylcholine can guarantee the maintenance of ventricular pacemakers when there is high parasympathetic tone but can also prevent extra ventricular beats when sympathetic and parasympathetic tone are both high.\r"

  ".U": "90167941\r", 
  ".W": "The mechanisms underlying the development of ventricular fibrillation (VF) during early myocardial ischemia were assessed by use of a computerized three-dimensional mapping system capable of recording simultaneously from 232 intramural recording sites throughout the entire feline heart in vivo. Occlusion of the proximal left anterior descending coronary artery led to ventricular tachycardia (VT), which degenerated to VF in 1-5 minutes in four of 15 animals. Normal sinus beats immediately preceding the initiation of VT leading to VF demonstrated delayed activation (total activation time 133 +/- 14 msec), which was not significantly different from the activation time for normal sinus beats immediately preceding nonsustained VT (149 +/- 7 msec). Most of the conduction delay occurred in the subendocardial and midmyocardial regions in both groups. Initiation of VT leading to VF occurred by intramural reentry in three of the four cases. In one case, a mechanism responsible for the initiation of VT could not be assigned. The coupling interval of the initiating beats of VT ultimately leading to VF (210 +/- 15 msec) did not differ from that of nonsustained VT. Maintenance of the VT that led to VF was due primarily to intramural reentry (84% of cases) involving multiple activation sites in and around the border region of the ischemic zone. Nonreentrant mechanisms, arising in the subendocardium and subepicardium, also contributed to the maintenance of VT before development of VT. The transition from VT to VF was due exclusively to intramural reentry with initiation of the reentrant beats in the subendocardium and, occasionally, the subepicardium. Acceleration of the tachycardia by intramural reentry, along with very rapid and inhomogeneous recovery of excitability (as low as 50-60 msec), led to increased functional block and conduction delay. As a result, the total activation time for a given beat exceeded the coupling interval for that beat and led to the multiple reentrant circuits and multiple simultaneous activations characteristic of VF. Thus, the initiation and maintenance of VT leading to VF during early ischemia is due to intramural reentry, although nonreentrant mechanisms also contribute. However, the development of VF is due to continued intramural reentry and rapid recovery of excitability.\r"

Right ventricular ferret papillary muscles were subjected to two 20-minute periods of hypoxia, each followed by 1 hour of reoxygenation. The first sequence of hypoxia/reoxygenation was done without intervention. Before the second sequence, the pharmacological agent under study was added to the superfusate or the superfusate calcium concentration was increased from 2.5 to 8 mM. Time from peak to 80% decline in twitch tension was measured in the presence and absence of each intervention immediately before each period of hypoxia and after reoxygenation at maximal twitch prolongation. Interventions that affect Ca2+ flux across the sarcolemma (verapamil and 8 mM [Ca2+]o) or agents that affect oxygen free radical production/survival (dimethyl sulfoxide and allopurinol) did not affect twitch prolongation. Pharmacological agents that increase cyclic AMP levels (forskolin and milrinone) or those that inhibit mitochondrial activity (oligomycin B and ruthenium red) attenuated twitch prolongation. Pharmacological agents that decrease cyclic AMP levels (carbachol) or inhibit function of the sarcoplasmic reticulum (ryanodine) augmented twitch prolongation. The effect of mitochondrial inhibitors on intracellular calcium handling during hypoxia and reoxygenation was examined using muscles loaded with the bioluminescent calcium indicator aequorin. Mitochondrial inhibitors abbreviated the calcium transient and maximal twitch prolongation after hypoxia. We conclude that alterations in sarcoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria calcium handling contribute to the prolonged relaxation seen upon reoxygenation of hypoxic myocardium.\r"

  ".W": "To investigate the ability of arginine vasopressin (AVP) to compete with metabolic vasodilatory factors in the coronary circulation, we examined the coronary vascular and myocardial effects of AVP in isolated working rat hearts during normoxic and hypoxic perfusion. In normoxic hearts, AVP treatment (777 +/- 67 pg/ml) reduced coronary flow by 38.4 +/- 2.6%. Myocardial function was also significantly decreased by AVP whereas efficiency significantly increased. In contrast, the same dose of AVP administered to hypoxic hearts resulted in substantially smaller effects on coronary flow (-11.5 +/- 2.8%), myocardial function, and efficiency. In hearts treated first with AVP and then with hypoxia, the greater degree of coronary vasodilation compared with that observed in hearts treated with hypoxia alone also indicated an antagonizing effect of hypoxia on AVP-mediated coronary constriction. It was also noted that the hypoxia treatment alone resulted in reductions of O2 supply and consumption identical to those produced by AVP treatment during normoxia. However, hypoxia was associated with a significantly greater effect on myocardial function and, in contrast to the effect of AVP, a marked reduction in efficiency. The rate of lactate release was greater during hypoxia alone (2.07 +/- 0.08 mumol/min) than with AVP treatment during normoxia (0.76 +/- 0.05 mumol/min). These results indicate that the effect of AVP on the coronary vessels, as well as its effect on the myocardium, is significantly attenuated during hypoxia. In addition, AVP-constricted vessels appear to retain considerable vasodilatory reserve despite evidence of ischemic conditions. Thus, although the effects of AVP resemble ischemia, the increased efficiency and the relatively small effect of AVP on contractile function, as well as the preserved vasodilatory reserve, suggest otherwise. A physiological explanation for these observations is proposed wherein the constricting effects of AVP modulate the effects of autoregulatory factors such that blood flow requirements are minimized while allowing preservation of adequate blood flow for vital tissue function.\r"

Oxygen-derived free radical production is also associated with increased vascular permeability and cellular injury in a variety of conditions, including ischemia-reperfusion and inflammation. To determine if free radicals play a role in the pathogenesis of hypertensive vascular disease, the free radical scavengers superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase, SOD and catalase, and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) were given to rats made acutely hypertensive with angiotensin II infusions. Untreated hypertensive and normotensive control animals were used for comparison. The effects of scavenger treatment were assessed by in vivo observations of intestinal small arteries by use of stereomicroscopy and videotape and light and transmission electron microscopy to identify and quantitate vascular lesions, and tracer particle injections to determine permeability changes. In vivo observations revealed that scavenger treatment did not alter vascular constriction patterns, vessel caliber, or blood pressures. Electron microscopy of arteries from untreated hypertensive rats showed more severe and more extensive endothelial and smooth muscle lesions, increased tracer particle penetration, and greater fibrin deposition than that found in scavenger-treated hypertensive groups. Quantitation of vascular lesions showed approximately equal reductions in smooth muscle necrosis (p less than 0.01) and fibrin deposition (p less than 0.05) in arteries from each of the scavenger-treated hypertensive groups. The results indicate that the free radical scavengers SOD, catalase, SOD-catalase, and DMSO inhibit (but do not prevent) vascular hyperpermeability and cellular damage during acute, angiotensin II--induced hypertension. These findings suggest that free radicals play a role in the pathogenesis of hypertensive vascular disease, probably by exacerbating the vascular changes initially triggered by an acute elevation in blood pressure.\r"

Hemodynamics and 31P-magnetic resonance spectra were monitored simultaneously in the isolated Langendorff-perfused rat heart during 30 minutes of ischemia and 30 minutes of reperfusion. Left ventricular hypertrophy was produced by either suprarenal aortic constriction or chronic thyroxine administration. In chronic pressure overload hypertrophy, minimal coronary resistance was significantly higher (p less than 0.001) and the loss of purine nucleosides in the coronary effluent during early reperfusion significantly larger (p less than 0.001) compared with both normal hearts and thyroxine-induced hypertrophied hearts. Postischemic recovery of the baseline values for left ventricular developed pressure and phosphorylation potential was 43 +/- 4% and 82 +/- 4%, respectively, in chronic pressure overload hypertrophied hearts; 86 +/- 4% and 91 +/- 3%, respectively, in normal hearts (chronic pressure overload hypertrophy versus normal hearts, p less than 0.001 and p less than 0.05); and 100 +/- 4% and 98 +/- 2%, respectively, in thyroxine-induced hypertrophied hearts (normal hearts versus thyroxine-induced hypertrophied hearts, p less than 0.05 and p less than 0.05). Recovery after reperfusion was not related to intracellular pH, ATP, phosphocreatine, or inorganic phosphate levels during ischemia. Also, recovery was not related to developed pressure or oxygen consumption before ischemia. However, recovery was inversely related to coronary resistance and directly related to coronary flow before ischemia. Thus, functional and/or anatomic alterations of the coronary vascular bed and a greater loss of purine nucleosides during reperfusion are likely responsible for the attenuated compensatory response to ischemia and reperfusion in left ventricular hypertrophy induced by chronic pressure overload. On the other hand, the excess muscle mass per se does not seem to alter recovery, since thyroxine-induced myocardial hypertrophied hearts responded at least as well as normal hearts.\r"

Accordingly, we studied the effects of amrinone, amrinone plus dobutamine, and dobutamine alone on mechanical performance, myocardial oxygen consumption, and high energy phosphate metabolism in different stages of congestive heart failure in the cardiomyopathic Syrian hamster. In hearts with moderate heart failure, administration of amrinone, amrinone plus dobutamine, and dobutamine alone increased developed pressure significantly, whereas the phosphorylation potential increased significantly only with amrinone and amrinone plus dobutamine. In hearts with advanced heart failure, administration of amrinone and amrinone plus dobutamine increased developed pressure significantly, whereas dobutamine alone had no effect. The phosphorylation potential improved significantly only with amrinone. Thus, amrinone improved mechanical performance and mitochondrial activity in both heart failure states. Dobutamine potentiated amrinone's beneficial effects in moderate heart failure, but negated the positive inotropic effect of amrinone in advanced heart failure. Therefore, hearts responded differently to potent inotropic agents depending on the severity of heart failure.\r"

Sections (4-5 microns) of tissue fixed in Clarke's solution or paraformaldehyde and embedded in paraffin were stained by the peroxidase anti-peroxidase method for adenosine deaminase or complexing protein, using affinity purified antibodies. Staining for adenosine deaminase and complexing protein was observed in the central myocardium of all heart chambers. Adenosine deaminase was detected in endothelial cells of blood vessels and adjacent pericytes. The nuclei of arteries stained heavily for adenosine deaminase, whereas those of venules and small veins, although positive, stained much more lightly. The cytoplasm of blood vessel endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells of the tunica media were also weakly positive for adenosine deaminase. Endothelial cells of the endocardium and epicardium did not stain. Randomly distributed mononuclear inflammatory cells and interstitial connective tissue fibroblasts were also negative for adenosine deaminase. These results raise the possibility that endothelial cells containing adenosine deaminase could serve as a metabolic barrier preventing the free exchange of plasma and interstitial adenosine. Positive staining for complexing protein was restricted to blood vessel endothelial cells, especially cytoplasmic processes. Colocalization experiments carried out with biotinylated primary antibodies indicate that some vessels are positive for both adenosine deaminase and complexing protein. This is the first experimental evidence of possible in situ association of adenosine deaminase and complexing protein.\r"

The hearts were extracted from 21 piglets (1-12 days old) and set up as modified Langendorff preparations beating isometrically. They were perfused with red blood cell-enhanced buffer at controlled rates of coronary flow. Mechanical measurements, O2 usage, and substrate oxidation were determined simultaneously at 30-minute intervals for 2 hours. In control hearts, coronary flow was maintained at 1.8 ml/min/g. There was no significant change in mechanical function, diastolic compliance, or O2 or substrate metabolism after 2 hours. In the ischemia group, coronary flow was reduced to 0.2 ml/min/g and sustained for 2 hours. With the onset of ischemia, mechanical function promptly fell to 20% of control. Although O2 delivery was reduced to 11%, O2 extraction doubled so that myocardial O2 consumption was 22% of control, matching mechanical function. Glucose oxidation fell from 37 to 12 nmol/min/g, and lactate release appeared. These measures and ventricular compliance remained constant for the full 2 hours. Concentrations of glycogen and creatine phosphate did not differ from the control group; ATP was 76% of controls. These studies indicate that when myocardial O2 supply is limited, mechanical function rapidly diminishes, largely preserving critical energy stores and preventing irreversible myocellular injury. Although the signal remains to be determined, the strategy is similar to that employed by hibernating species to survive extended periods of O2 deprivation.\r"

Myocytes were field-stimulated from slack length, and contraction was measured with an inverted microscope-photodiode array-computer apparatus. The effect of pacing rate and ouabain administration on systolic and diastolic function was examined. Single myocytes isolated from hyperthyroid hearts maintain the properties of bulk muscle, because maximal twitch velocity is augmented 98% and the time course of contraction as measured by the time to peak shortening, relaxation time, or contraction duration is abbreviated 39%. Spontaneous sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium release, as measured by the occurrence of contractile waves, is increased in the hyperthyroid myocytes. This increased frequency of spontaneous sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium release is most marked under conditions known to be associated with high intracellular calcium, such as low pacing rates or digitalis glycoside administration. It can account for the hypoperformance of the hyperthyroid myocytes noted under these conditions because it is associated with depletion of sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium stores and diminution of subsequent twitch amplitude. These observations may help explain, in part, the cellular basis of the altered cardiac performance in the hyperthyroid state.\r"

  ".W": "Depressed cardiac pump function is the hallmark of congestive heart failure, and it is suspected that decreased influx of Ca2+ into the cardiac cell is responsible for depressed contractile function. Since Ca2+ channels in the sarcolemmal membrane are considered to be an important route for the entry of Ca2+, we examined the status of Ca2+ receptors/channels in failing rat hearts after myocardial infarction of the left ventricular free wall. For this purpose, the left coronary artery was ligated and hearts were examined 4, 8, and 16 weeks later; sham-operated animals served as controls. Hemodynamic assessment revealed decreased total mechanical energy (left ventricular systolic pressure x heart rate), increased left ventricular diastolic pressure, and decreased positive and negative dP/dt in experimental animals at 4, 8, and 16 weeks. Although accumulation of ascites in the abdominal cavity was evident at 4 weeks, other clinical signs of congestive heart failure in experimental rats were evident from the presence of lung congestion and cardiac dilatation at 8 and 16 weeks after induction of myocardial infarction. The density of Ca2+ receptors/channels in crude membranes, as assessed by [3H]nitrendipine binding assay, was found to be decreased in the uninfarcted experimental left ventricle at 8 and 16 weeks; however, no change in the affinity of nitrendipine was evident. A similar depression in the specific binding of another dihydropyridine compound, [3H]PN200-110, was also evident in failing hearts. Brain and skeletal muscle crude membrane preparations, unlike those of the right ventricle and liver, revealed a decrease in Ca2+ receptors/channels density in experimental animals at 16 weeks.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".U": "90167953\r", 
  ".W": "We investigated left ventricular (LV) early diastolic filling in 10 normal conscious dogs that had been previously instrumented to measure LV and left atrial (LA) pressures and three orthogonal LV internal dimensions. LV volume was calculated as a general ellipsoid. The pressure within a passive structure increases as it is filled. If myocardial relaxation is rapid enough to substantially aid LV diastolic filling, it may overcome this effect and cause LV pressure to fall despite an increase in volume. Thus, we defined the amount of LV filling that occurred while LV pressure was falling as relaxation filling, which is a measure of the importance of LV relaxation during early diastolic filling. The time constant of relaxation (T) was derived from the exponential fall of LV pressure during isovolumic relaxation. While LV pressure was falling early in diastole (the relaxation filling period), all three LV diameters increased. Autonomic blockade with hexamethonium (5 mg/kg) and atropine (0.1 mg/kg) reduced relaxation filling from 21 +/- 6% (mean +/- SD) to 12 +/- 3% of the stroke volume (p less than 0.01). The mean LA pressure also was significantly decreased (from 12 +/- 2 to 10 +/- 5 mm Hg, p less than 0.05), while the duration of the relaxation filling period and T were unchanged. Positive inotropic stimulation with dobutamine (10 micrograms/kg/min) shortened T without changing LA pressure. The maximum LA-LV pressure gradient, dV/dtmax, and relaxation filling all increased. Augmented preload produced by dextran infusion (500 ml/10 min) caused an increase in LA pressure (from 11 +/- 3 to 21 +/- 8 mm Hg, p less than 0.05) without altering T. This also increased the maximum LA-LV pressure gradient, dV/dtmax, and relaxation filling. Augmented afterload produced by methoxamine (10 mg/3 min i.v.) significantly increased LA pressure (from 9 +/- 4 to 15 +/- 10 mm Hg, p less than 0.05) and lengthened T (from 35 +/- 4 to 50 +/- 7 msec, p less than 0.05) and the duration of relaxation filling (from 36 +/- 5 to 44 +/- 9 msec, p less than 0.01) without altering the maximum LA-LV pressure gradient, dV/dtmax, or LV relaxation filling. Incremental changes in heart rate induced by atrial pacing (from 100-180 beats/min) resulted in progressive decreases in the time constant of LV relaxation and the duration of relaxation filling. The LA pressure was also decreased. There was no corresponding increase in the amount of active LV filling until the heart rate reached 180 beats/min. During all these interventions, T correlated with the duration of LV relaxation filling (r = 0.99. p less than 0.05). The amount of relaxation filling and dV/dtmax both correlated with the maximum LA-LV pressure gradient.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

The present study specifically investigated the contribution of thromboxane A2 (TXA2)/prostaglandin endoperoxide and prostaglandin F2 alpha (PGF2 alpha) to the cerebral vascular response to exogenous acetylcholine (ACh). Effects of TXA2/prostaglandin endoperoxide-receptor antagonist SQ29548 on responsiveness of pial arterioles to ACh (10(-7) and 10(-4) M), PGF2 alpha (10(-7)-10(-5) M), TXA2 mimetic 9,11-methanoepoxy prostaglandin H2 (U46619, 5 and 10 ng/ml), and norepinephrine (10(-6)-10(-4) M) were studied by use of a closed cranial window in 37 anesthetized mechanically ventilated newborn piglets. Pial arteriolar diameter was measured by intravital microscopy. Topical application of exogenous PGF2 alpha and U46619 resulted in dose-dependent cerebral vasoconstriction, and the dose-response curve for each agonist was shifted to the right by the increasing concentrations of SQ29548 (10(-6)-10(-8) M). Topical application of high concentration of ACh (10(-4) M) caused a transient 34 +/- 4% decrease in pial arteriolar diameter from 98 +/- 6 to 65 +/- 5 microns (p less than 0.05). This constriction was attenuated (16 +/- 3%) in the presence of 10(-8) M SQ29548 and abolished with 10(-6) or 10(-4) M SQ29548. SQ29548 (10(-6) M) was without effect on the vasoconstrictor response to exogenous norepinephrine. Low concentration of ACh (10(-7) M) had no consistent effect on pial arterioles in the absence or presence of TXA2/prostaglandin endoperoxide-receptor blockade. The data suggest that vascular prostaglandin/endoperoxide receptors mediate cerebral vasoconstriction upon muscarinic-receptor stimulation.\r"

  ".W": "Growth of the smooth muscle in the rat portal vein was initiated by an increased transmural pressure. After 7 days, the cross-sectional area of the vessel wall and the maximal active force of the longitudinal muscle layer had increased twofold. Electron microscopy showed that the cell cross-sectional area was increased, suggesting cellular hypertrophy. Increased amounts of intermediate (10 nm) filaments were observed in the hypertrophied cells. The hypertrophied vessels had decreased DNA content per unit wet weight compared with the control vessels (hypertrophied, 1.5 +/- 0.1; control, 1.9 +/- 0.1 micrograms/mg; p less than 0.01). Protein composition was studied with electrophoretic methods. Compared with control preparations the hypertrophied veins had similar myosin and actin contents per unit wet weight (myosin: hypertrophied, 4.4 +/- 0.8; control, 5.9 +/- 0.9; actin: hypertrophied 12.2 +/- 0.6; control, 11.8 +/- 1.0 mg/g). Two different forms of the myosin heavy chain were detected with 5% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels. The proportion of the lower molecular weight heavy chain relative to total heavy chain content was about 30% and similar in both preparations. The relation filamin/myosin was increased in the hypertrophied vessels. Pyrophosphate gel electrophoresis revealed two protein bands, with an increase in the slower migrating band in the hypertrophied vessels possibly reflecting an increase in filamin content in the extracts. In the control portal vein alpha-actin is the dominating isoform constituting about 55% of total actin. In hypertrophied vessels, alpha-actin decreased (by 15%) and gamma-actin increased (by 20%). The portal vein contained desmin and vimentin in a ratio of about 6:1. The hypertrophied vessels showed a marked increase in the amount of these proteins (desmin/actin: hypertrophied, 0.32; control, 0.14). In conclusion, during pressure-induced growth of the portal vein, contractile protein contents increase in proportion to the increase in weight. A change in isoforms of actin occurs but no evidence for a change in myosin isoforms was found. The structural proteins increase relative to tissue weight, possibly associated with the increased number of intermediate filaments demonstrated with electron microscopy.\r"

  ".W": "The relation between cardiac hypertrophy, shunt size, myocardial contractility, capillary density, adrenergic responsiveness, and neurohumoral stimulation was evaluated in dogs with compensated and decompensated cardiac hypertrophy caused by an infrarenal aorto-caval shunt. Shunt size varied from 5 to 35 mm2 due to an inability to create a uniform size. Dogs that developed heart failure within 4 months had 25 +/- 2 mm2 shunts, whereas those that developed it after 4 months had 19 +/- 3 mm2 shunts; those that did not develop heart failure had 10 +/- 1 mm2 shunts. Hypertrophy developed at the same rate in all the dogs that developed heart failure, which occurred at a critical heart weight (hypertrophy) for a given load (shunt size). In the dogs with heart failure there was a decrease in myocardial contractility (tension = 5.7 +/- 0.6 vs. 7.3 +/- 0.3 g/mm2, p less than 0.05), a decrease in adrenergic responsiveness (maximal heart rate with isoproterenol = 203 +/- 7 vs. 249 +/- 5 beats/min, p less than 0.01), an increase in circulating neurohormones, and a decrease in urinary sodium excretion (0.4 +/- 0.1 vs. 5.0 +/- 1.3 meq/3 hr, p less than 0.01). None of these abnormalities occurred in dogs with compensated hypertrophy. There were no differences in cardiac capillary density between the control dogs and the dogs with compensated cardiac hypertrophy or heart failure. Thus, it would appear that if heart failure is to develop after an initial toleration of a sudden volume overload, it will develop at a given combination of cardiac hypertrophy and volume overload, with cardiac hypertrophy developing at the same rate in all cases. In this model, once heart failure develops, myocardial contractility and cardiac adrenergic responsiveness are decreased and there is pronounced neurohumoral activation. All these changes are absent in hearts with compensated hypertrophy.\r"

Arterioles were located in situ by intracoronary perfusion with india ink-gelatin solution and then dissected and cannulated at both ends with glass micropipettes. Intraluminal pressure was initially set at 60 cm H2O; then the pressure was altered in steps of 20 cm H2O over a range of 20-140 cm H2O. Arterioles developed spontaneous tone and exhibited a significant myogenic response in physiological saline solution (36 degrees -37 degrees C). Arteriolar dilation and constriction were observed at lower (20-60 cm H2O) and higher (60-140 cm H2O) pressures, respectively. The presence of a functional and automatically intact endothelium was confirmed by relaxation to the endothelium-dependent vasodilator bradykinin and by transmission electron microscopy, respectively. After mechanical denudation of the endothelium with a specially designed abrasive micropipette, spontaneous tone and myogenic responses were preserved. Denudation of the endothelium was verified functionally (no response to bradykinin) and with transmission electron microscopy. Moreover, the mechanical denudation technique did not deleteriously affect smooth muscle because vasoconstrictor and vasodilator responses to nonendothelial-dependent drugs were the same before and after denudation. In summary, the present study demonstrates that pressure-dependent responses occur in isolated coronary arterioles and that this response is not dependent on the endothelium. Therefore, pressure-induced changes in coronary arteriolar tone are a true myogenic response in that they originate from smooth muscle.\r"

During this period, the majority of myocytes retained their rod-shaped morphology, but the cell number decreased progressively (50% of the initial density after 2 days in culture). Between day 1 and day 3 in culture, the specific synthetic activities of total proteins and of electrophoretically purified myosin heavy chain and actin ([14C] phenylalanine incorporation into protein, in disintegrations per minute per microgram protein) decreased (-19%,-32%, and -73%, respectively). Addition of isoproterenol or norepinephrine (10 nM) from the onset of the culture for 3 days increased the specific activity of both total and noncontractile proteins (greater than 20%) but had no effect on the specific activity of myosin heavy chain and actin when compared with 3-day cultured control cells. beta-Adrenergic receptors are specifically required to mediate this increase in total protein synthesis. This finding was demonstrated by the inhibitory effects of propranolol; neither prazosin nor yohimbine showed any effect. The pattern of synthesized protein during adrenergic stimulation was qualitatively evaluated by use of [35S]methionine incorporation and gel electrophoresis. The general pattern of labeled proteins did not differ significantly from that of control cells; this occurrence suggests that isoproterenol harmoniously stimulates the synthesis of noncontractile proteins. These findings demonstrate that low doses of beta-adrenergic agonists have an anabolic effect on adult cardiac quiescent myocytes that do not affect the major contractile proteins. Regulation of myofibrillar protein synthesis may be more dependent on myocyte contractile activity.\r"

The time required to restore vessel patency has been reduced more than 50% when compared with findings for free streptokinase.

Special interest was focused on the morphological features of the valves treated. Mitral valves that appeared unsuitable for commissurotomy were excised in toto at the time of mitral valve replacement in 15 patients. The excised valves were mounted in a fluid-filled chamber with a window for photographic evaluation. The chamber was perfused continuously to ensure maximal valvular opening. The valve was photographed, and the orifice area was measured before and after balloon expansion. In addition, the specimens were examined macroscopically and radiographically with regard to calcium content and degree and localization of fibrosis. These data were correlated with splitting of commissures and with rupture of leaflets. Nine valves were fibrotic, and six were calcific. Dilatation was performed first with a single-balloon catheter (diameter, 2 cm) and then with a double-balloon catheter (diameter, 2 and 1.5 cm). After dilatation with one balloon, the average mitral valve area increased from 0.79 to 1.09 cm2, and with two balloons, average area increased to 1.59 cm2. The single-balloon technique caused commissural splitting in nine valves, stretching in three, partial leaflet rupture in one, and no change in two. After the double-balloon technique, commissural splitting occurred in 12 valves and three leaflets were ruptured where severe fibrosis and calcification were mainly located within the commissures. As a rule, after dilatation with the single-balloon technique, the remaining stenosis was still severe, and after dilatation with the double-balloon technique, the remaining stenosis was moderate.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

To examine this effect, 14 mongrel dogs were anesthetized with pentobarbital sodium (32 mg/kg) and instrumented with arterial and venous catheters and a Doppler blood flow transducer on the left circumflex coronary artery. Two weeks later, heart rate, blood pressure, coronary blood flow, and regional left ventricular ejection fraction (by two-dimensional echocardiography) were measured before and 1, 2, 5, and 10 minutes after cocaine (4 mg/kg i.v.), while the animals were fully conscious. Heart rate, blood pressure, and coronary blood flow were increased significantly at each time after cocaine. Regional ejection fraction, however, was depressed by 50 +/- 7%, 35 +/- 4%, and 21 +/- 4% at 1, 2, and 5 minutes after cocaine treatment, respectively. Ten minutes after cocaine treatment, regional ejection fraction had recovered to a level not significantly different from baseline. Because the observed myocardial depression after cocaine was accompanied by a large increase in the rate-pressure product, and presumably, myocardial oxygen consumption, this depression could have been secondary to increased myocardial oxygen demand not appropriately matched by an increase in coronary blood flow. To minimize the effects of cocaine on myocardial oxygen demand, a subset of six dogs received cocaine (4 mg/kg i.v.) while sedated with pentobarbital (25 mg/kg). In these dogs, cocaine did not significantly alter heart rate or blood pressure; however, regional ejection fraction was significantly depressed by 44 +/- 5% and 36 +/- 6% at 1 and 2 minutes after cocaine treatment, respectively.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Acute, experimental left ventricular thrombi in seven dogs were evaluated with a quantitative backscatter imaging system that allowed the measurement of relative integrated backscatter and cyclic (i.e., diastolic minus systolic) variation in integrated backscatter. Coronary ligation abolished the cyclic variation in relative backscatter that occurred in normal myocardium. The end-diastolic relative backscatter in the thrombus (16.9 +/- 1.3 dB) was significantly higher than in apical myocardium (13.2 +/- 0.6 dB, p less than 0.05). There was no significant difference in the cyclic variation in relative backscatter among thrombus, ischemic myocardium, or intracavitary blood. Thus, the quantitative assessment of the acoustic properties of left ventricular thrombi can be useful in their detection and in the differentiation from myocardium and intracavitary signals.\r"

  ".W": "Depression of myocardial conduction velocity can be an important mechanism of action of antiarrhythmic drugs but it can also facilitate arrhythmogenesis. We used lidocaine in an anesthetized canine preparation to address the hypothesis that drug-induced rate-dependent conduction velocity depression causes ventricular tachyarrhythmias. A closely spaced square array of 64 electrodes was used to determine conduction velocity longitudinal and transverse to epicardial ventricular fiber direction. Lidocaine caused rate-dependent decreases in conduction velocity that were proportionately greater in the longitudinal direction at the shortest pacing cycle lengths. Conduction velocity depression developed rapidly in the presence of lidocaine with a new steady state present by the second beat of the rapid train. Recovery from rate-dependent depression of conduction velocity was exponential with a time constant of 122 +/- 20 msec (mean +/- SD) in the longitudinal direction and 114 +/- 30 msec in the transverse direction; this difference was not significant. The relation between conduction velocity depression and ventricular arrhythmias was assessed by pacing for 3 minutes at cycle lengths of 1,000, 500, 300, and 250 msec, and for 1 minute at a cycle length of 200 msec. Arrhythmias did not occur in the baseline period in the dogs that received lidocaine, nor in 12 control dogs that were subjected to the same stimulation protocol except that saline was administered in place of lidocaine. Sustained polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (VT) occurred in six of 16 dogs given lidocaine. VT occurred in the presence of relatively high plasma lidocaine concentrations (8.4 +/- 2.3 micrograms/ml) and only at pacing cycle lengths of 300 msec or shorter. The dogs that developed VT demonstrated greater rate-dependent depression of conduction velocity than the other dogs, and activation patterns obtained just before the onset of VT showed marked conduction disturbances. Furthermore, QRS prolongation, loss of one-to-one capture, and increasingly distorted activation patterns preceded the onset of VT during fixed-rate pacing, suggesting progressive sodium channel block. In summary, rate-dependent conduction velocity depression and nonuniform activation were associated with VT in this model and can be responsible for some arrhythmias induced by antiarrhythmic drugs.\r"

  ".W": "Microcinephotography was used to study heart development in a neural crest model of heart defects, that is, persistent truncus arteriosus, interrupted aortic arch, double outlet right ventricle, or single ventricle and tricuspid valve anomalies. These defects were created in chick embryos by ablation of premigratory neural crest destined for the aorticopulmonary and truncal septa, as well as the third and fourth aortic arch arteries. When embryogenesis reached the looped cardiac tube stage of development (Hamburger-Hamilton stage 18), 19 experimental and 15 control embryos were filmed at 100 frames per second under controlled environmental conditions. Analysis of the microcinephotography films showed the following significant distinguishing characteristics of the developing heart in the experimental embryos: altered conotruncal shape in 100%, depressed contractility and dilation of the primitive ventricle in 84%, decreased emptying of the bulbus cordis in 79%, incompetent truncal cushions in 68%, incomplete looping of the cardiac tube in 58%, and fourth right aortic arch artery without blood flow and third right aortic arch artery with increased flow in 53%. These abnormal characteristics suggested that there were functional and morphological changes in the developing heart of experimental embryos before the time when the predicted structural heart defects would be apparent. It is proposed that the primitive ventricle might attempt to compensate for depressed contractility by ventricular dilation. The incompetent truncal cushions could be secondary to the depressed contractility or secondary to the neural crest ablation that is known to cause persistent truncus arteriosus, an interrupted aortic arch, or both. The absence of blood flow in the right fourth aortic arch artery that will become the definitive aorta correlates with the expected incidence of interrupted aortic arches in this neural crest-ablation model of heart defects. It is speculated that the incomplete looping of the cardiac tube might hinder normal developmental alignment of the outflow and inflow tracts, producing a spectrum of lesions of maldevelopment of the tricuspid valve and dextroposition of the aorta.\r"

All of the more recent methods involve an additional parameter--the pressure to which the exponential relaxation finally declines (PB, the pressure intercept in the method of Craig and Murgo and the asymptote in the exponential fits). An additional purpose of the study was to determine the relation of these parameters to pericardial pressure. In eight closed-chest anesthetized dogs, tau was calculated from intracavitary (Plv) and transmural LV pressure (Plv = Plv-Pper) by each method as pericardial (Pper) and LV end-diastolic pressure were changed by pericardial infusion and intravenous volume loading. The time constant determined by the method of Weiss et al was dependent on pericardial pressure; the time constants determined by the other methods were not. PB and the asymptotes were found to be similar and to increase almost equally with pericardial pressure. When pericardial pressure was zero, these values were approximately -20 mm Hg. Thus, both these parameters seem to indicate the same baseline pressure, a pressure that increases pari passu with pericardial pressure. Reported changes in the value of tau calculated from intracavitary LV pressure by the method of Weiss et al may reflect factors other than changes in LV diastolic function.\r"

We investigated the effect of eosinophils and eosinophil supernatants obtained from eight hypereosinophilic patients on the contractile performance and endocardial morphology of isolated, electrically stimulated cat papillary muscle preparations (n = 16). All these eosinophil suspensions contained high proportions of \"hypodense\" or \"activated\" cells. Eosinophils (5-15 x 10(6) ml organ bath) or eosinophil culture supernatants (prepared by overnight incubation at 37 degrees C) when added to papillary muscles produced acute changes in contractile behavior of these muscles identical to the previously reported effects of selective endocardial damage: a reduction in time to peak isometric twitch tension causing a reduction in peak isometric tension but with no significant reduction in rate of tension development or in maximum unloaded shortening velocity. All of these muscle preparations showed severely damaged endocardium at scanning electron microscopy. Addition of eosinophils from hypereosinophilic patients to muscles with selectively damaged endocardium (by previous transient [1-second] exposure to 1% Triton X-100) produced no further change in contractile performance. No significant change in contractile performance or endocardial morphology of papillary muscles (n = 16) was observed after addition of eosinophils (7.5-10 x 10(6] or neutrophils (8-15 x 10(6] from normal subjects or of cell-free culture medium. Thus, activated human eosinophils produce specific morphological and functional changes suggestive of specific damage to endocardium of isolated feline cardiac muscle.\r"

The objective of this study was to determine if trapidil could prevent restenosis in experimentally induced atherosclerotic rabbits. New Zealand White rabbits with preexisting iliac arterial lesions induced by balloon deendothelialization underwent balloon angioplasty. Arteriography was performed before, immediately after, and 4 weeks after the balloon dilatation. Tissue sections of the dilated arterial segment were also analyzed morphometrically. Seventeen rabbits were randomized to two groups: a control group (n = 8) and a trapidil-treated group (n = 9). The treatment group received 30 mg/kg s.c. trapidil twice daily. The angiographic luminal diameters before and after dilatation were similar. At the 4-week restudy, there was a significant preservation of luminal diameter in the trapidil group compared with the control group (1.27 +/- 0.20 vs. 0.94 +/- 0.48 mm, respectively; p less than 0.005). When luminal diameters immediately after dilatation were compared with diameters at the 4-week restudy (i.e., when the degree of restenosis was assessed), there was a greater luminal diameter reduction in the control group than in the trapidil group (0.70 +/- 0.44 vs. 0.30 +/- 0.25 mm, respectively; p = 0.005). By morphometric analyses, the luminal areas were also greater in the trapidil group than the control group (0.80 +/- 0.25 vs. 0.57 +/- 0.33 mm2, respectively; p = 0.03). Intimal thickness was significantly less for the trapidil group than for the control group (0.33 +/- 0.15 vs. 0.44 +/- 0.15 mm, respectively; p = 0.01), as well as medial thickness (0.09 +/- 0.03 vs. 0.11 +/- 0.03 mm, respectively; p = 0.01). In this study, trapidil significantly increased the luminal area and reduced the intimal thickness in the atherosclerotic rabbit iliac artery after balloon angioplasty.\r"

  ".W": "Alterations in loading conditions and muscle length influence the electrophysiology of ventricular myocardium and may play a role in arrhythmogenesis in globally dilated or dyskinetic ventricles. To test the hypothesis that stretch can initiate arrhythmias in normal myocardium, the response to graded mechanical stretch was studied in seven isolated blood-perfused canine ventricles. After eight conditioning contractions produced by His bundle pacing (2 Hz), global stretch of the ventricle was produced by a servocontrolled pump that abruptly increased ventricular volume by a precise amount (delta V) during early diastole and then returned ventricular volume to the initial holding volume (Vi). Ventricular premature contractions were readily produced; ventricular couplets and short runs of ventricular tachycardia were occasionally elicited. The probability of a stretch-induced arrhythmia was determined from multiple alternating sequences in which a stretch of known amplitude (delta V) or no stretch was delivered. As delta V was increased, the probability of a stretch-induced arrhythmia was low initially, increased sharply after a threshold was exceeded, and approaching 100% with physiological volumes. With Vi set to a standard value of 20 ml, corresponding to end-diastolic pressure of 5.3 +/- 5.2 mm Hg (mean +/- SD), the delta V resulting in a 50% chance of a stretch-induced arrhythmia (delta V50) was 15.0 +/- 1.6 ml. A decline in delta V50 was consistently observed when Vi was increased. While delta V50 values were remarkably similar (10.7% coefficient of variation), the pressure at the time the ventricular premature depolarization was triggered was highly variable for different ventricles; this finding suggests that myocardial strain is more important than absolute level of wall stress in the initiation of these arrhythmias. These results demonstrate that myocardial stretch predictably initiates arrhythmias and that the susceptibility to stretch-induced arrhythmias is enhanced by ventricular dilatation. Thus, ventricular ectopy in patients with regionally or globally dilated hearts may arise, in part, by a mechanism of myocardial stretch.\r"

  ".W": "Platelet thrombus formation occurs at sites of severe arterial narrowing where shear stress is elevated. Shear stress appears to induce platelet aggregation in vitro by means of initiation of von Willebrand factor binding to platelet glycoprotein Ib. Recent in vitro studies have demonstrated that aurintricarboxylic acid can inhibit shear stress-induced platelet aggregation. This effect is mediated by aurintricarboxylic acid binding to von Willebrand factor; this binding results in inhibition of von Willebrand factor interaction with glycoprotein Ib. In this study, we examined the effect of aurintricarboxylic acid on platelet-dependent cyclic flow reductions (CFRs) in a canine coronary stenosis model. In dose-response experiments, six animals received 4 mg/kg aurintricarboxylic acid by bolus infusion, followed by 1 mg/kg every 10 minutes. Total inhibition of CFRs was observed in all animals after 6.7 mg/kg aurintricarboxylic acid; CFRs could not be reinitiated by the thromboxane A2 analogue U46619. Continuous infusion of epinephrine (0.4 micrograms/kg/min) caused CFRs to return; however, 3.7 mg/kg additional aurintricarboxylic acid again induced total inhibition of CFRs. In addition, five animals received a bolus infusion of 10 mg/kg aurintricarboxylic acid, which caused total inhibition of CFRs. The average area of stenosis in the constricted vessels was 83%, and shear stress at the site of constriction averaged 350 dynes/cm2. Aurintricarboxylic acid did not alter hemodynamics, thrombin time, platelet count, or ADP/epinephrine-induced platelet aggregation. These data indicate that platelet glycoprotein Ib-von Willebrand factor interactions are important during coronary occlusion and that aurintricarboxylic acid can inhibit coronary thrombosis associated with coronary constriction.\r"

During the mean follow-up period of 23 +/- 8 months, 11 cardiac deaths (five sudden and six nonsudden) occurred in group 1, and five cardiac deaths (all nonsudden) occurred in group 2. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis between the groups confirmed that patients with silent ischemia (group 1) had worse prognoses during the follow-up period (p = 0.023). Although the higher incidence of hypertension, smoking, hypercholesterolemia, and diabetes in our patients might reflect a more sickly population of stable angina patients, the multivariate Cox's hazard function analysis of these and other variables including Q waves on ECG, exercise parameters, and ambulatory ECG findings revealed presence of silent ischemia during daily life as the most powerful and independent predictor of cardiac mortality (p = 0.01). These data indicate that, in such patients with stable angina, silent myocardial ischemia occurs frequently during treatment with conventional antianginal drugs and identifies a subset of patients who are at high risk of cardiac death.\r"

A severe complication in the remaining patient occurred when, after 2 ml ethanol in the AV nodal artery, occlusion developed in the midright coronary artery that led to an inferior wall myocardial infarction.

  ".W": "To avoid atrioventricular node-His bundle ablation, catheter ablation of the atrial myocardium was attempted in eight patients with drug refractory type I atrial flutter. In seven of eight patients, a zone of prolongation and fragmentation of the endocardial electrogram was found in the low posterior part of the right atrium. Entrainment of the atrial flutter by high right atrial pacing was accompanied by local recording of second-degree regional block in several atrial sectors but never in the low septal area. We, therefore, hypothesized that the latter represented the critical slow conduction zone of the reentrant flutter circuit. One or two cathodal DC shocks were locally delivered without immediate or late complications. One single ablation attempt was performed in five patients, whereas three patients underwent a second attempt because of early flutter recurrence. Patients were initially discharged without (and after a second session with) antiarrhythmic drugs. After a mean follow-up of 15.5 months (range, 10-23 months), five patients are free of arrhythmias without antiarrhythmic drug therapy. Two patients did not experience atrial arrhythmias while on a drug regimen that was previously found to be ineffective, and a third patient had flutter recurrences. This study suggests that patients with type I atrial flutter referred for atrioventricular node-His bundle ablation may be successfully managed by delivering the ablative shock directly on the atrial arrhythmia substrate.\r"

  ".W": "Dilator reserve of the coronary microvasculature is diminished in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy. Although increased extravascular compressive forces, tachycardia, and increased myocardial mass can explain some impairment, recent evidence suggests the possibility of intrinsic microvascular disease. We tested the hypothesis that impairment of endothelium-dependent dilation of the microvasculature could be a contributing mechanism. We infused the endothelium-dependent dilator acetylcholine (Ach) (10(-8) to 10(-6) M) and the smooth muscle vasodilator adenosine (AD) (10(-6) to 10(-4) M) into the left anterior descending coronary artery in eight patients with dilated cardiomyopathy (mean ejection fraction, 28%) and seven controls (atypical chest pain). Small vessel resistance was assessed by measuring coronary blood flow (CBF) at constant arterial pressure with a Doppler velocity catheter (corrected for cross-sectional area by angiography). With Ach, control patients increased CBF 232 +/- 40% (mean +/- SEM), whereas CBF did not significantly change in cardiomyopathy patients (41 +/- 24%) (p less than 0.0001, control vs. cardiomyopathy). With AD, control patients increased CBF 422 +/- 56% and cardiomyopathy patients increased CBF 268 +/- 43% (p = 0.13). An index of the proportion of coronary flow reserve attributable to endothelium-dependent vasodilation was obtained by standardizing each patient's Ach dose response to his maximal AD flow response. In seven control patients receiving both Ach and AD, 56 +/- 9% of the maximal AD flow response was attained with the endothelium-dependent vasodilator Ach, whereas in seven cardiomyopathy patients receiving both Ach and AD, only 23 +/- 14% of the maximal AD response was attained (p less than 0.01).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The prognostic value of abnormalities on the electrocardiogram (ECG) present 1 year after initial myocardial infarction (MI) is examined in relation to reinfarction and coronary death throughout 32 years (mean, 10.1 years) of follow-up in the Framingham Heart Study. Resting 12-lead ECGs were available in 251 survivors (190 men and 61 women) of clinically recognized Q wave MI. The ECG reverted to normal in 31 (12.4%) cases and was abnormal but without Q waves in 37 (14.7%). Q waves persisted without other significant abnormalities in 108 (43.0%) and with other abnormalities in 75 (29.9%) cases. Electrocardiographic abnormalities at follow-up were more common in women and in those persons whose initial MI was anterior as compared with inferior. Nonspecific T wave, ST segment changes, and electrocardiographic left ventricular hypertrophy on the ECG before or after MI were powerful predictors (p less than 0.01) of coronary death. The relation of these residual post-MI electrocardiographic findings to reinfarction and coronary death was assessed by Cox regression analysis. The follow-up electrocardiographic status was unrelated to the risk of subsequent reinfarction. Subjects who lost Q wave evidence of MI but whose ECG continued to show evidence of repolarization abnormalities, left ventricular hypertrophy, or blocked intraventricular conduction were at a 3.5-fold increased risk (p less than 0.01) of coronary death as compared with those reverting to a normal ECG. Persons with a persistent Q wave MI accompanied by these abnormalities were at a 2.7-fold excess risk (p = 0.01) of coronary death as compared with those with a normalized ECG. These findings remained significant when considering age and standard coronary risk factors. The presence of other electrocardiographic abnormalities without persistent Q waves yields a worse prognosis than a Q wave persisting alone. The prognostic value of a follow-up ECG with abnormalities other than a persistent Q wave MI also remained after considering the effects of left ventricular hypertrophy and cardiac enlargement on x-ray, functional classification, and diuretic usage. Specific electrocardiographic abnormalities present before infarction, however, were potent indicators of long-term prognosis prognosis and diminished the importance of the follow-up ECG. Although survival after initial MI is improved only if the ECG reverts to normal, information on electrocardiographic abnormalities before MI can be especially useful in evaluating long-term risk.\r"

The right ventricular monophasic action potential, electrocardiographic, and conventional intracardiac electrical signals from various sites were recorded at different pacing cycle lengths from 30 seconds to 1 minute before and after a 10-mg/kg i.v. quinidine infusion. We used the extrastimulus technique to determine the effects of quinidine on ventricular refractory periods at different pacing cycle lengths and on the abrupt changes of the action potential duration. The action potential duration progressively decreased as the ventricular pacing rate increased at baseline and after quinidine infusion. Quinidine significantly increased the action potential duration from that of control by 25 msec (p less than 0.02) at the relatively slow pacing cycle lengths of 600, 500, and 400 msec. Quinidine's effect on the action potential duration was attenuated at the pacing cycle length of 350 msec and became negligible at 300 msec. In contrast, quinidine progressively lengthened the QRS duration as the pacing rate increased (20, 18, 37, 46, and 34 msec at pacing cycle lengths of 600, 500, 400, 350, and 300 msec, respectively; p less than 0.05). There were no rate-dependent changes in the QRS duration during the control period. The relation between the ventricular refractory periods and the action potential duration at different pacing cycle lengths was also determined before and after quinidine infusion.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

This signal-averaged electrocardiographic model was created from data obtained from 214 patients undergoing electrophysiologic testing (70 had ventricular tachycardia during electrophysiologic testing) by using stepwise logistic regression to rank eight clinical and nine signal-averaged electrocardiographic variables. The best predictors were ejection fraction, history of infarction, ventricular ectopic pairs or nonsustained ventricular tachycardia on Holter monitoring, QRS duration after 25-Hz filtering, and root mean square voltage of the terminal 40 msec of the QRS complex after 40- and 80-Hz filtering. Cross validation (a statistical technique that can be used to accurately evaluate how a predictive model will perform on a prospective patient population) was used to validate the model. After cross validation, the model's sensitivity was 91% and specificity was 59% for predicting ventricular tachycardia during electrophysiologic testing. This model compared favorably with established 25-Hz late-potential criteria (QRS duration of more than 110 msec and root mean square voltage of less than 25 microV of the terminal 40 msec of the QRS complex; sensitivity, 64%; specificity, 85%) and with established 40-Hz late-potential criteria (QRS duration of more than 114 msec or root mean square voltage of less than 20 microV of the terminal 40 msec of the QRS complex or duration of the low-amplitude signal less than 40 microV at the terminal QRS complex that is greater than 38 msec; sensitivity, 84%; specificity, 54%).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

BCA was successful in seven of eight patients, resulting in a decrease in the gradient (64 +/- 19 to 16 +/- 13 mm Hg, p less than 0.01), an increase in the diameter at the coarctation site (0.9 +/- 0.4 to 1.6 +/- 0.4 mm, p less than 0.01). Follow-up (6 months) has demonstrated continued gradient relief (6 +/- 9 mm Hg) and diameter increase (1.6 +/- 0.2 cm). Monitoring was performed by transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) during BCA, and before and after BCA angiography and after BCA computed tomography. In three of seven patients, immediately distal to the BCA site, intimal flaps (1-2 cm) could be detected by TEE but not by angiography or computed tomography. Follow-up TEE showed spontaneous healing in two and persistence in one patient. By TEE and computed tomography in one of eight patients during follow-up, intima and media dissection was found with pleural effusion and spontaneous healing. In one female patient, aortic dissection occurred after successful uneventful BCA, detected by TEE at the 6-month follow-up study and subsequently confirmed by biplane angiography, not detected by computed tomography and previous monoplane angiography. Because of the significant morbidity of BCA in this group of patients, its role in the management of adults with coarctation has yet to be determined. Further long-term follow-up studies will demonstrate whether the observed intima and media dissection by TEE after BCA are related to aneurysm formation.\r"

Recently, supersensitivity of the canine sinus and atrioventricular (AV) nodes to acetylcholine has also been demonstrated after parasympathetic denervation. Acetylcholine and the endogenous nucleoside adenosine exert similar electrophysiological effects in both the sinus and AV nodes, and share a common transduction process. We, therefore, hypothesized that after orthotopic cardiac transplantation, the donor (denervated) sinus node would demonstrate greater sensitivity to exogenous adenosine than the recipient (innervated) sinus node. The effects of incremental doses of intravenous adenosine (37-112 micrograms/kg) on changes in sinus cycle length (SCL) (delta SCLmax%), changes in PR interval (delta PRmax%), time to peak effect (sec), and duration of electrophysiological effects (sec) were prospectively measured in 28 orthotopic cardiac transplant patients and nine control subjects. The baseline SCL was 795 +/- 71 msec for the control subjects, 891 +/- 43 msec for the recipient atria, and 700 +/- 18 msec for the donor atria (p less than 0.05, donor vs. recipient). The delta SCLmax% for each dose of adenosine was similar in the innervated control and recipient atria. In contrast, the donor sinus node demonstrated a threefold to fourfold increased response to adenosine as compared with the recipient sinus node and a threefold to sixfold increased response as compared with control subjects. Similarly, the donor AV node demonstrated a threefold to fivefold increase in PR interval as compared with control subjects. The duration of sinus node slowing in the denervated atria was threefold to fivefold longer than in the recipient and control atria (p less than 0.001).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The study population consisted of 23 cardiac allograft recipients and 18 normal subjects. In each cardiac allograft recipient, one to eight (mean, four) IB studies were performed, each within 24 hours of right ventricular endomyocardial biopsy performed for rejection surveillance. The magnitude of the cyclic variation of IB in the posterior wall was 5.9 +/- 0.9 dB in normal subjects and 6.2 +/- 1.3 dB in the cardiac allograft recipients without previous or current histological evidence of acute rejection (n = 17, p = NS vs. normal subjects). The magnitude of cyclic variation of IB in the septum was 4.8 +/- 1.1 dB in normal subjects and 3.8 +/- 2.0 dB in the cardiac allograft recipients (n = 15, p = NS vs. normal subjects). A significant decrease in the septal IB measure was observed in cardiac allograft recipients with left ventricular hypertrophy (wall thickness of at least 13 mm) (2.6 +/- 1.7 dB, n = 8, p less than 0.05 vs. normal subjects). IB studies were done before and during moderate acute rejection in 11 recipients (14 episodes). During moderate acute cardiac rejection, the magnitude of the cyclic variation in IB decreased from 6.7 +/- 1.3 to 5.1 +/- 1.4 dB in the posterior wall (n = 14, p less than 0.05) and from 4.2 +/- 2.1 dB to 2.9 +/- 1.8 dB in the septum (n = 12, p less than 0.05). These data suggest 1) the magnitude of the cyclic variation in IB of the septum is different in cardiac allografts with cardiac hypertrophy and normal subjects, possibly reflecting regionally depressed myocardial contractile performance and 2) acute cardiac rejection in humans is accompanied by an alteration in the acoustic properties of the myocardium. This change is detectable by serial measurement of the magnitude of the cyclic variation in IB, both in the septum and in the posterior wall.\r"

Twenty-five patients were studied, and 30 angioplasties were performed; 20 patients had one-vessel disease, and five patients had two-vessel disease. In total, 15 dilations in the left anterior descending artery (LAD), seven in the right coronary artery (RCA), and eight in the left circumflex artery (LCx) were studied. For each patient, the BSM and the QRS integral map before, during, and after the inflation was compared by subtraction of recordings \"during-minus-before\" inflation and \"before-minus-after\" inflation. The subtraction was performed on the results of the QRS integral maps. The conclusions derived from the inspection of the BSMs and the difference maps show specific changes in the QRS complex during ischemia related to the corresponding ischemic segment in 21 of 25 patients in the three groups. An area of positive potentials remained present on the BSM during dilation, indicating a depolarization wave front. For the LAD group, positive potentials were seen on the anterior thorax and, for the RCA group, on the lower part of the thorax. By subtraction analysis, these changes were extracted and presented as difference maps. For the LCx group, the BSM revealed no changes in pattern but the difference map showed a difference vector pointing in a anteroposterior direction. A regional myocardial conduction delay was hypothesized as the most likely cause for the results.\r"

To study a single parameter that changes during these activities, and to better understand the pathophysiology of ischemia associated with increases in heart rate, we studied coronary vasomotion and blood flow response to increasing heart rate alone, produced by atrial pacing, with quantitative angiographic and Doppler flow-velocity measurements in 15 patients. In five patients with angiographically smooth coronary arteries (group 1), tachycardia produced progressive dilation of the epicardial artery with increases in cross-sectional area (CSA) of +15.5 +/- 3.4%, +22.4 +/- 2.1%, +28.5 +/- 3.3%, and +30.6 +/- 2.2% at 90, 110, 130, and 150 beats/min, respectively. In contrast, in five patients with mild angiographic narrowings (group 2), coronary segments failed to dilate with progressive tachycardia (-6.3 +/- 2.0%, -8.3 +/- 2.0%, -12.5 +/- 2.0%, and -11.4% at 90, 110, 130, and 150 beats/min, respectively), and progressive loss of luminal area was observed in five patients with severe angiographic narrowings (group 3) (-34.4 +/- 3.4%, -49.6 +/- 2.2%, -59.2%, and -72.8% at 90, 110, 130, and 150 beats/min, respectively). Coronary blood flow increased significantly with tachycardia in group 1 (+44.5 +/- 10.2%, +86.0 +/- 24.6%, +105.8 +/- 29.3%, and +137.5 +/- 46.0%), increased slightly in group 2 (+7.8 +/- 3.2%, +9.4 +/- 4.4%, +8.4 +/- 3.9%, and +10.0%), and decreased significantly in group 3 (-31.8 +/- 6%, -42.6 +/- 10.7%, -61.0%, and -70.0%). We conclude that an isolated increase in heart rate in patients with normal coronary arteries results in a modest increase in flow and vasodilation. In early atherosclerosis, the flow increase is blunted and dilation is replaced with paradoxical loss in luminal size. In patients with stenoses, further loss in luminal size occurs accompanied by a decrease in coronary blood flow. Thus, increasing heart rate alone in the setting of coronary stenoses could produce myocardial ischemia by a reduction in coronary supply, as well as by an increase in oxygen demand.\r"

Measurements were made five times in each patient, before and after induction of anesthesia. Myocardial ischemia was identified by TEE in 14 patients; in 10 of these, it was associated with concomitant ST segment depression of at least 1 mm. The onset of ischemia, as defined by TEE, was accompanied by a mean increase in PCWP of 3.5 +/- 4.8 mm Hg, as compared with a mean change of 0 +/- 2.2 mm Hg between observations not associated with the onset of ischemia (p less than 0.01). An increase in PCWP of at least 3 mm Hg, tested as an indicator of ischemia, had a sensitivity of 25% and a positive predictive value of 15%; after correction for background changes associated with anesthetic induction, the sensitivity of this indicator was 33%, and its positive predictive value was 16%. These figures were not improved by selecting cutoff points higher or lower than 3 mm Hg.

Two-dimensional echocardiographic diagnosis of anterior leaflet prolapse was correct in all patients. The diagnosis of posterior leaflet prolapse by two-dimensional echocardiography, however, was mistaken as anterior leaflet prolapse in 16 (13 patients with medial scallop prolapse and three patients with lateral scallop prolapse) of the 24 patients according to current diagnostic criteria for mitral valve prolapse. Eight patients with middle scallop prolapse were diagnosed correctly by two-dimensional echocardiography. Acceleration flows in the left ventricle were observed by color Doppler echocardiography in all 49 patients. The sites of acceleration flows detected by color Doppler echocardiography coincided with those of prolapse confirmed in all at the time of operation. There was a significant correlation between the maximum area of acceleration flow signals and severity of mitral regurgitation estimated by angiography. In the 13 patients with medial scallop prolapse and the three patients with lateral scallop prolapse, a regurgitant jet originated from a bulged portion of the posterior leaflet and was directed toward the opposite left atrial cavity to the bulged portion by short-axis images of color Doppler echocardiography.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".U": "90168002\r", 
  ".W": "To assess the effects of left ventricular (LV) load on isovolumic relaxation rate of the hypertrophied LV, wide range LV load shifts were imposed by the sequential use of balloon aortic valvuloplasty (BAV) and arterial vasodilation in 14 patients with severe sclerocalcific aortic stenosis (aortic valve area, 0.45 +/- 0.16 cm2). Micromanometer tip-catheter LV pressure recordings (n = 14) and simultaneous LV angiograms (n = 9) were obtained before BAV, during nitroprusside infusion (NIT) before BAV, 48 hours after BAV, and 48 hours after BAV during NIT. LV peak systolic pressure (LVPSP) decreased from 237 +/- 33 mm Hg before BAV to 200 +/- 33 mm Hg (p less than 0.01) during NIT before BAV, to 201 +/- 27 mm Hg (p less than 0.01) after BAV and to 165 +/- 26 mm Hg (p less than 0.01) during NIT after BAV.LV end-systolic volume (LVESV) decreased from 55 +/- 34 ml before BAV to 25 +/- 23 ml (p less than 0.01) during NIT before BAV, to 30 +/- 32 ml (p less than 0.025) after BAV and to 15 +/- 12 ml (p less than 0.025) during NIT after BAV. LV end-systolic wall stress (LVESs) decreased from 90 +/- 30.10(3) dyne/cm2 before BAV to 41 +/- 13.10(3) dyne/cm2 (p less than 0.01) during NIT before BAV, to 55 +/- 16.10(3) dyne/cm2 (p less than 0.025) after BAV and to 26 +/- 6.10(3) dyne/cm2 (p less than 0.01) during NIT after BAV. Only after sequential BAV-NIT was the time of LV electromechanical systole (LVEST), which marked the onset of the LV isovolumic relaxation period, significantly reduced (from 419 +/- 26 msec before BAV to 363 +/- 28 msec after BAV-NIT [p less than 0.01]). The time constants of LV pressure decay with zero or nonzero asymptote pressure (TO and TPB) remained unchanged after BAV and during NIT before BAV. At the lowest LVPSP, LVESV, and LVESs after sequential BAV-NIT, both TO and TPB significantly prolonged from 35.7 +/- 6.3 to 46.7 +/- 12.6 msec (p less than 0.025) and from 46.6 +/- 12.5 to 73.2 +/- 23.3 msec (p less than 0.01). Phase-plane plots (LV dP/dt vs. LVP) of the LV pressure (P) signal during isovolumic relaxation were constructed for the four different loading states by matching corresponding LVP and LV dP/dt points. For a given LVP value, the corresponding LV dP/dt values on the phase plane plots were comparable before BAV, during NIT before BAV, and after BAV. The corresponding LV dP/dt value was higher during NIT after BAV, impling a slower relaxation rate at the same LVP after sequential BAV-NIT. A shift in the control of isovolumic LV relaxation kinetics from myofilamentary detachment to myoplasmic calcium removal, which proceeds slower in hypertrophied myocardium, could explain the observed slowing of LV isovolumic relaxation after drastic LV unloading of sequential BAV-NIT.\r"

Impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) and non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) were classified according to World Health Organization criteria. End points of ischemic heart disease were defined by Rose Questionnaire and resting electrocardiogram (ECG) according to the Minnesota Code. IHD by electrocardiographic changes was classified as asymptomatic (without history of chest pain or overt IHD) or symptomatic (with history). IHD by all criteria combined was significantly more common in men and women with NIDDM, and in women with IGT, than in those with normal glucose tolerance. The prevalence of myocardial infarction, defined by major Q wave, Rose Questionnaire chest pain criteria, or personal history, was higher in persons with NIDDM than in persons without; the difference was highly significant in women (odds ratio, 2.08 [1.22, 3.56]; p = 0.009). Angina pectoris was not significantly related to NIDDM or IGT in either sex. Electrocardiographic evidence of asymptomatic IHD was significantly more prevalent in both men and women with NIDDM as compared with those with normal glucose tolerance (odds ratios, 1.75 [1.10, 2.81] for men and 1.80 [1.07, 3.01] for women; p less than 0.05). This significant association persisted after excluding persons on digitlis or diuretic therapy and, in women, was also independent of the effect of major known IHD risk factors. These population-based data are consistent with clinical reports suggesting an association of diabetes with silent myocardial infarction or ischemia. The presence of ischemic resting electrocardiographic abnormalities in the asymptomatic diabetic patient is likely to have prognostic and therapeutic implications.\r"

Procaterol decreased lymphocyte beta 2-adrenoceptor density and all beta 2-adrenoceptor-mediated in vivo effects but did not affect beta 1-adrenoceptor-mediated in vivo effects. In contrast, xamoterol neither affected lymphocyte beta 2-adrenoceptors nor beta 2-adrenoceptor-mediated in vivo effects but decreased beta 1-adrenoceptor-mediated in vivo effects. It is concluded that in humans, generally long-term application of beta 1- or beta 2-adrenoceptor agonists causes desensitization of beta-adrenoceptor function but in a beta-adrenoceptor subtype-selective fashion.\r"

In addition to routine studies, patients were evaluated with echocardiography, nuclear ventriculography, right heart catheterization, and myocardial biopsy. Fourteen of the 18 patients (78%) showed evidence of myocarditis. Of these, 10 were treated with immunosuppressive therapy. Nine of the 10 treated patients with myocarditis had subjective and objective improvement. Follow-up endomyocardial biopsies in these patients showed resolution or substantial improvement in myocarditis. Four patients with myocarditis not treated with immunosuppressives also improved. All patients improving spontaneously presented with congestive heart failure within 1 month of delivery and improved dramatically within days of presentation. Four of the 18 patients showed no evidence of myocarditis. Of these, two improved, and two deteriorated (both requiring cardiac transplantation). None of these four patients were treated with immunosuppressive therapy. We conclude that in patients with peripartum cardiomyopathy, 1) the etiology remains unclear although myocarditis was present in 78% of those with this condition, 2) resolution of myocarditis is associated with significant improvement in left ventricular function, 3) myocarditis may resolve spontaneously without detectable loss of cardiac function, and 4) immunosuppressive therapy in patients with myocarditis and persistent left ventricular dysfunction may improve left ventricular function and prognosis.\r"

  ".U": "90168007\r", 
  ".W": "To test the hypothesis that cardiac norepinephrine depletion related to heart failure alters contractile responses to beta-adrenergic agonists with a component of \"indirect\" action (acting by release of neuronal norepinephrine), we examined the inotropic potential of several pharmacologically distinct beta-agonists. Contractile responses to the nonselective beta-agonist isoproterenol, the beta 2-selective agonist zinterol, and the direct- and indirect-acting agonists dopamine and dopexamine were compared in isolated right ventricular trabeculae removed from failing, nonfailing innervated, and previously transplanted and, therefore, denervated nonfailing human hearts. In failing hearts, the contractile response to isoproterenol was significantly lower (41%) than that in nonfailing innervated hearts. The responses to the mixed agonists dopamine and dopexamine were even more attenuated in failing hearts, to a level 76-90% lower than those of nonfailing innervated hearts. In denervated, previously transplanted, nonfailing hearts, the contractile responses to the mixed agonists dopamine and dopexamine were 66-72% lower than those in the nonfailing innervated group, but the response to isoproterenol was not significantly different. The response to zinterol was not significantly different among the three groups. In subjects with severe heart failure, in vivo hemodynamic responses to dopexamine were compared with those of the direct-acting beta-agonist dobutamine. Responses to dopexamine and dobutamine were measured before and after prolonged continuous infusions of each drug. The response to dopexamine, but not to dobutamine, diminished over time. We conclude that a large component of the inotropic response to dopamine and dopexamine in human hearts is due to the ability of these agonists to promote the release of neuronal norepinephrine; when neuronal norepinephrine is depleted, indirect-acting agonists are less able to produce an inotropic response.\r"

  ".W": "Long-distance procurement of cardiac allografts is commonly used to increase the supply of donor organs but has recently been associated with the development of impaired diastolic function. Therefore, the effect of the total ischemic duration on myocardial fibrosis was quantitatively evaluated in 36 cardiac transplant recipients in whom the ischemic time ranged from 70 to 363 (mean, 189 +/- 83) minutes. Interstitial collagen was quantified with polarization microscopy and digital image analysis in 115 endomyocardial biopsy specimens taken 5-10 days after surgery. The technique, developed for this study, showed excellent correlation with hydroxyproline analysis (r = 0.98, p less than 0.001). Collagen volume fraction in biopsy specimens from the transplanted hearts was significantly greater than that in biopsy samples from seven normal, age-matched autopsy hearts (4.7 +/- 1.9% vs. 2.9 +/- 0.6%, p less than 0.02). The degree of fibrosis correlated with the total ischemic time (r = 0.60, p less than 0.001). Donor age ranged from 10 to 51 years and did not correlate with the degree of fibrosis. No relation was found between the corresponding collagen content and right atrial pressure, pulmonary artery wedge pressure, or cardiac output measured at the time of biopsy. Myocyte damage was observed in eight of the 36 patients and was characterized by a striking loss of muscle birefringence. We conclude that cardiac allograft fibrosis may be identified shortly after transplantation and is dependent on the total ischemic duration.\r"

  ".U": "90168010\r", 
  ".W": "The adenosine diphosphate (ADP)-adenosine triphosphate (ATP) carrier of the inner mitochondrial membrane is identified as an autoantigen in myocarditis and dilated cardiomyopathy. Sera of patients with these diseases contain autoantibodies to the ADP-ATP carrier capable of inhibiting nucleotide transport in vitro. Recently, an antibody-related infringement of energy metabolism was shown in intact perfused hearts isolated from guinea pigs immunized with the ADP-ATP carrier. A decreased cytosolic-mitochondrial difference of the phosphorylation potential of ATP was measured that originated from a reduction in mitochondrial-cytosolic nucleotide transport. Nonimmunized animals did not show these changes in energy metabolism, despite being in a comparable metabolic state and performing equal external heart work. To establish whether antibodies to the ADP-ATP carrier can also alter cardiac function, hemodynamic parameters of isolated hearts of guinea pigs that were preimmunized with the carrier protein were measured. Cardiac metabolism was stimulated by exposing the hearts to a high calcium concentration in conjunction with a maximum elevation of the afterload. Mean aortic pressure, stroke volume, stroke work, and external heart work were found to be lowered significantly (p less than 0.005). The external heart work of the immunized hearts reached only about 20% of the level performed by control hearts. Myocardial oxygen consumption was lowered 2.5-fold, whereas the extent of lactate production was found to be more than doubled. These results show a diminished cardiac performance of hearts from animals immunized with the ADP-ATP carrier. Our findings demonstrate that autoimmunity to the ADP-ATP carrier may contribute to the pathophysiology of dilated cardiomyopathy as a subsequent stage of myocarditis by causing an autoantibody-mediated reduction in cardiac function on the basis of an imbalance between energy delivery and demand.\r"

Fenoldopam and nitroprusside lowered blood pressure safely to an average pressure of 176/105 mm Hg; highly significant dose-response relations were found for the 13 patients receiving fenoldopam and the 15 receiving nitroprusside. Volume and sodium, potassium, and creatinine concentrations were measured in freely voided urine specimens both before and during intravenous therapy. In the fenoldopam-treated patients, there were significant increases in urinary flow (92 +/- 21 to 168 +/- 37 ml/hr, p less than 0.003), sodium excretion (227 +/- 73 to 335 +/- 90 mu eq/min, p less than 0.001), and creatinine clearance (70 +/- 11 to 93 +/- 13 ml/hr, p less than 0.003). In the nitroprusside-treated group, however, all these parameters decreased, but not significantly. For direct comparison of the two agents, the increments in urinary flow rate (+76 +/- 20 vs. -16 +/- 15 ml/hr, fenoldopam vs. nitroprusside), sodium excretion (+109 +/- 28 vs. -39 +/- 28 mu eq/min), and creatinine clearance (+23 +/- 6 vs. -11 +/- 7 ml/min) were significantly greater (p less than 0.001 for each) in the fenoldopam-treated group. Significant differences were also obtained when these parameters were calculated as percentage increase over baseline. Fenoldopam and nitroprusside are effective therapies for severe, accelerated, or malignant hypertension, but fenoldopam had additional salutary renal effects in these patients.\r"

To assess the determinants of the abnormal ejection fraction response to exercise, we performed radionuclide angiography at rest and during exercise in 41 hypertensive patients without coronary artery disease. In 22 patients (group 1), the ejection fraction increased more than 5% during exercise; in the other 19 patients (group 2), the ejection fraction either increased by less than 5% or decreased with exercise. Left ventricular diastolic filling was impaired at rest in patients in group 2 compared with group 1, with reduced peak filling rate (2.5 +/- 0.4 vs. 3.1 +/- 0.7 end-diastolic volume/sec; p less than 0.01) and prolonged time to peak filling rate (175 +/- 28 vs. 153 +/- 22 msec; p less than 0.01). Impaired diastolic filling in group 2 was associated with less augmentation in end-diastolic volume during exercise compared with group 1 (p less than 0.01). These observations were not dependent on the threshold value that was arbitrarily chosen to define an abnormal ejection fraction response, as there were significant correlations for the entire group between the magnitude of change in ejection fraction with exercise and both the resting peak filling rate (r = 0.46) and the change in end-diastolic volume with exercise (r = 0.62).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Between 1975 and 1984, 394 deaths occurred among 4,828 subjects aged 5 years or older, and 199 of these occurred in the 1,093 persons with non-insulin-dependent diabetes. Only 28 deaths were attributed to CHD; all occurred among the 689 diabetic persons 45 years of age or older. No CHD deaths occurred among the 419 nondiabetic subjects 45 years of age or older. The rate of fatal CHD among the diabetic subjects was higher in men than in women and increased with advancing age and duration of diabetes. A higher incidence of fatal CHD was associated with proteinuria, renal insufficiency, medial arterial calcification, diabetic retinopathy, insulin therapy, and an abnormal electrocardiogram. In Pima Indians aged 50-79 years, the incidence of fatal CHD was less than half that found in the Framingham population after controlling for age, sex, and diabetes (incidence rate ratio, 0.4; 95% confidence interval, 0.2-0.7). Factors protecting Pima Indians from fatal CHD may include racial heritage, low serum concentrations of total and low density lipoprotein cholesterol, and rarity of heavy smoking. Among the diabetic subjects, mortality from diabetic renal disease, which shows many of the same risk factors, may selectively compete and remove those at risk for fatal CHD. This would not, however, explain the lack of fatal CHD among the nondiabetic subjects. Fatal CHD shares many of the risk factors associated with the specific microvascular complications of diabetes, and diabetes and its associated attributes are the major predictors of fatal CHD in this population.\r"

Twenty-three patients participated in this study: nine patients after SFA (median age, 8 years), 14 patients after RETE (median age, 8 years), and 10 control subjects (median age, 9.5 years). At rest, a highly significant decrease of blood flow velocities in the left brachial artery was measured in all patients of the SFA group compared with those of the RETE and control groups, as documented by various Doppler spectrum parameters: maximal frequency of advancing curve (p = 0.0001), pulsatility index (p = 0.0005), and resistance index (p = 0.039). During reactive hyperemia, a moderate capacity of physiologic augmentation of blood flow velocities was observed in five patients of the SFA group. This capacity was marginal in two patients with complaints of claudication in the left upper limb during strenuous exercise, which can be related to the number of branches of the left subclavian artery ligated during operation. This study indicates that SFA in infancy may lead to compromised hemodynamics of the upper left limb with potential for symptoms of ischemia during exercise.\r"

Laser balloon angioplasty (LBA) is a technique designed to potentially alleviate these problems by sealing arterial dissections, smoothing the luminal surfaces, dehydrating thrombi, and reducing the elastic properties that tend to recoil the stretched artery to its original state. During LBA, laser energy is delivered circumferentially by a 100-microns optical fiber that terminates in a central diffusing tip within an angioplasty balloon. LBA is performed for 20 seconds during the final inflation of the angioplasty balloon. Achieved with decremental ramped laser dosimetry, Nd:YAG laser energy has been shown to be effective in welding experimental arterial dissections over a therapeutic temperature range of 95 degrees-120 degrees C. LBA treatment of rabbit iliac arteries has been superior to balloon angioplasty in inhibiting elastic recoil and causing acute and long-term luminal increment. LBA has also been effective for sealing acute dissections in atherosclerotic rabbit iliac arteries. Additionally, in a canine model, safety in the coronary circulation has been shown, that is, even at 1 month after LBA, angiography demonstrated a cast of the LBA balloon without luminal compromise. Since March 1988, more than 250 patients with symptomatic coronary artery disease have been treated with LBA with nearly uniform clinical success, including frequent reversal of abrupt closure. LBA seems to be a safe modality that may decrease the need for emergency operative procedures and late coronary revascularization after PTCA.\r"

  ".W": "Balloon inflation during percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) transiently occludes the coronary artery, causing temporary ischemia. In patients without collaterals, regional hypokinesis of the ventricular myocardium at risk occurs within the first 20 seconds and persists throughout balloon inflation. Early PTCA procedures were performed with brief balloon inflations, but the desire to improve procedural results has led many operators to extend balloon inflation times to 45 seconds or longer. Although the ischemic indicators of pain and electrocardiographic changes are commonly noted with these longer inflations, actual hemodynamic consequences are often obscured by physiological compensation. The PTCA-induced ischemic period is often too short to measure changes in cardiac output by conventional methods, but it is increasingly evident that profound regional myocardial dysfunction, in fact, occurs. Continuous two-dimensional echocardiography with quantitative assessment of regional wall motion and ejection fraction is particularly effective in detecting the location, extent, and temporal change of ischemic regional contractile dysfunction. Echocardiographic recordings during baseline, ischemia, and post-balloon-deflation periods permit examination of PTCA-caused alterations in ejection fraction and ventricular volumes and allow the use of testing techniques aimed at mitigation of ischemia.\r"

Patients received alternate 90-second balloon inflations with and without distal perfusion of oxygenated perfluorochemical (Fluosol, Alpha Therapeutic Corp., Los Angeles, California) at 60 ml/min. Efficacy was assessed by anginal intensity, hemodynamic and electrocardiographic parameters, and left ventricular function determined by two-dimensional echocardiography during balloon inflations. There was a trend toward lower anginal intensity with Fluosol perfusion at 30, 60, and 90 seconds of occlusion. Pulmonary wedge pressure increased significantly with and without Fluosol perfusion, and the magnitude of change was not different. Cardiac output decreased significantly less with Fluosol perfusion than with routine inflation for the total group (-0.8 vs. -1.2 l/min, p less than 0.01) and in the subgroup with left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) angioplasty (-0.7 vs. -1.5 l/min, p less than 0.001). Left ventricular ejection fraction (EF) by echocardiography declined significantly less with Fluosol perfusion (-4.0 vs. -7.9 EF units, p less than 0.004) than with routine inflation for the total population and declined significantly less with Fluosol in the subgroup with LAD angioplasty (-5.5 vs. -9.7 EF units, p less than 0.008). Regional wall-motion abnormality score increased significantly with routine inflation (from 0.7 +/- 1.4 to 3.5 +/- 3.2, p less than 0.001) and did not change with Fluosol perfusion (from 0.8 +/- 1.3 to 1.3 +/- 1.1, p = NS).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Synchronized coronary venous retroperfusion was applied and studied in 16 patients undergoing percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) balloon dilatation of proximal left anterior descending (LAD) coronary artery stenosis. The rationale for using retroperfusion support during the PTCA-induced coronary artery occlusions was to ameliorate or prevent myocardial ischemia and possibly facilitate extension of the PTCA balloon-inflation period. After therapeutic PTCA treatment, which successfully dilated the culprit coronary artery in all 16 patients, and a 5-minute recovery period, a single retroperfusion-treated LAD occlusion (101 +/- 36 seconds) was compared with equivalent untreated control LAD occlusions (86 +/- 24 seconds) before and after the retroperfusion-supported balloon occlusion. Observations and measurements encompassed 1) ease and time of coronary sinus catheterization, 2) incidence of anginal pain during LAD occlusion, 3) electrocardiographic signs of myocardial ischemia, and 4) two-dimensional echocardiographic indexes of global left ventricular function. The coronary sinus was successfully catheterized within 139 +/- 140 seconds, and in 12 of the 16 patients, the tip of the special autoinflatable retroperfusion balloon catheter could be placed in the desired location of the great cardiac vein. The retroperfusion protocol interfered minimally with the PTCA procedure, and application of the support system had no deleterious effects. As compared with the pain reported 23 (72%) times during the 32 control LAD occlusions, only five (31%) of the patients indicated pain or discomfort during the retroperfused occlusions. Treated occlusions exhibited delayed or significantly lower electrocardiographic ST segment elevations (sum, 10.4 +/- 7.8 mm) as compared with the controls (sum, 16.2 +/- 7.9 mm and 18.8 +/- 10.6 mm; both p less than 0.01).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Despite significant advances in the technology of percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) and the ability to perform the procedure in more complex cases, there are still problems of acute closure and resultant acute myocardial infarction. Approximately two thirds of patients who undergo acute closure will require bypass surgery. Independent factors that can be predictive of patients who will undergo acute closure include stenosis length exceeding a two-lumen diameter, female gender, stenosis at a bend of 45 degrees or more, stenosis at a branching point, stenosis-associated thrombus or filling defect, other stenoses in the vessel undergoing dilatation, and multivessel disease. Factors that can be identified only at the time of the procedure are post-PTCA percentage of stenosis, an intimal tear or dissection, and a post-PTCA gradient of 20 mm Hg or more. The outcome of abrupt closure depends on several factors. The features that have been found to be predictive of fatal outcome are female gender, collateral channels originating from the dilated vessel, a large amount of jeopardized myocardium, left ventricular hypertrophy, hypertension before PTCA, diabetes, and multivessel disease. When abrupt closure occurs, attempts should be made to reopen the artery even if a decision has been made to proceed to bypass surgery. Techniques that can help when the artery cannot be kept open include prolonged inflation (3-5 minutes), use of a bailout or perfusion catheter, and infusion of an oxygenated perfluorochemical (Fluosol, Alpha Therapeutic Corp., Los Angeles, California). Intracoronary stenting and laser balloon angioplasty are new techniques that might prove useful in the management of the dissection that commonly leads to abrupt closure.\r"

  ".U": "90168025\r", 
  ".W": "Although thrombolytic therapy has been a major advance in the treatment of acute myocardial infarction, in at least 25% of patients the artery remains occluded after administration. In these patients, the strategy of \"rescue\" or \"salvage\" angioplasty is frequently used although follow-up data are limited. Sixty-three patients underwent percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) after thrombolytic therapy for acute myocardial infarction. The decision to proceed with PTCA was based on physician preference and not a specific research protocol. In 34 of these selected patients, PTCA was performed as a rescue procedure because the infarct-related artery remained occluded (group 1); in 29 of these patients, it was performed to treat a severe but subtotal residual stenosis (group 2). PTCA successfully restored patency in 71% of group 1 and in 90% of group 2. Group 1 patients had a significantly worse baseline ejection fraction than did those in group 2 (47 +/- 13% vs. 58 +/- 13%, p = 0.0015). Group 1 patients also had a significantly worse predismissal ejection fraction (36 +/- 13% vs. 50 +/- 14%, p = 0.0004). During initial hospitalization, 14 (22%) patients underwent coronary bypass surgery. In-hospital mortality was low in each group (3% in group 1 and 0% in group 2). During a mean follow-up of 4 years, 89% of group 1 patients remained alive as compared with 97% of group 2 patients. This excellent 4-year survival rate, despite the depressed predismissal ejection fraction in patients undergoing rescue PTCA, raises the issue of whether acute reperfusion has a beneficial effect aside from any impact on myocardial salvage and preservation of left ventricular function.\r"

The directional atherectomy catheter consists of a cup-shaped cutter within a housing unit and a small balloon. It was developed to perform transluminal atherectomy for the treatment of atherosclerotic vascular disease. This new procedure was performed on 195 lesions in peripheral arteries of lower limbs in 134 procedures, and 52 lesions in coronary arteries in 50 procedures. A successful angiographic outcome was obtained in 89% of procedures and 90% of lesions in peripheral experience, and 60% of procedures and 62% of lesions in coronary experience. A higher success rate (81%) was achieved in our more recent experience with coronary atherectomy, as compared with a 42% success rate in our earlier experience. The incidence of major complications was infrequent in both peripheral and coronary experiences. In the peripheral experience, one patient had delayed occlusion that required bypass surgery, and two patients had distal embolization. In the coronary experience, one patient had acute occlusion that required emergency bypass surgery. There were no vessel perforations. Conclusively, transluminal atherectomy is a feasible, predictable, and safe procedure for the treatment of peripheral and coronary artery disease. Further studies, however, are necessary to evaluate the long-term efficacy of this new procedure.\r"

Results of studies in canine coronary arteries have demonstrated long-term patency and stability, and studies in the atherosclerotic arteries of rabbits have suggested late results with stenting that might be superior to those obtained with balloon angioplasty alone. Initial clinical studies have focused on the use of the device as a \"bridge\" to surgery if closure occurs. The stent appears to have been successful in this application. A phase 2 study is now examining the stent as definitive therapy for acute closure in certain anatomic subsets of patients. Information on long-term patency is pending. If this is favorable, the device will be studied to see if it reduces the incidence of restenosis in the subset of patients in whom balloon dilatation alone fails to produce an optimal hemodynamic result.\r"

Some clinical reports have suggested that similar changes occur in patients. This prospective study documents the changes in these enzymes associated with acute myocardial infarction, acute bowel necrosis (MES INF), and uncomplicated abdominal aortic reconstruction. Analysis of 15 patients with AMI, 13 patients undergoing major AAS, and eight patients with MES INF has shown that these conditions may be differentiated by analysis of serum CK and LD isoenzymes. The study suggests that in the absence of electrocardiographic changes, a patient with epigastric distress with elevated levels of serum CK and either CK-MB or CK-BB bands present may well have a mesenteric rather than a myocardial infarction. Acute myocardial infarction can be ruled out further through analysis of serum LD1/LD2 ratios.\r"

The measurement of bronchial responsiveness was performed by inhaling doses of acetylcholine chloride (0.08 to 20 mg/ml) and calculating the PC20-FEV1. The median value for PC20-FEV1 was above 20 mg/ml in the subjects without history of congestive heart failure (n = 18), was 5.29 mg/ml in the subjects with clinical evidence of congestive heart failure in the past days (n = 18; p less than 0.01), and was 5.74 mg/ml in the subjects with clinical evidence of congestive heart failure at the time of study (n = 15; p less than 0.01). The hemodynamic variables by cardiac catheterization and the clinical symptoms were not correlated with the grade of bronchial responsiveness. These results suggest that the bronchial responsiveness was increased in most of the patients with chronic congestive heart failure. We concluded that continuous pulmonary congestion may contribute to the pathogenesis of bronchial hyperresponsiveness.\r"

To test this hypothesis, we studied 305 consecutive patients undergoing bronchoscopy with fluoroscopically guided TBB. No patient without symptoms and fluoroscopic findings suggesting lung collapse had a pneumothorax demonstrated on the post-biopsy chest roentgenogram. At the University of Virginia, routine chest roentgenograms failed to demonstrate a single unsuspected pneumothorax among all patients undergoing TBB during a period of nearly six years. Given this low incidence of unsuspected pneumothorax, we conclude that routine chest roentgenograms have a low diagnostic yield and may not be necessary in all patients after fluoroscopically guided TBB.\r"

  ".W": "Thirty-three patients with hemoptysis caused by nonmalignant diseases underwent arterial embolization. In seven (21.2 percent) of 33 patients, hemoptysis recurred after initial embolization in a follow-up period ranging from one day to four years. Although there was no difference in age and daily quantity of bleeding among patients with and without recurrences, those with mycetoma suffered the highest recurrence of bleeding after initial embolization (three [75 percent] of four patients). In the initial arteriograms of the seven patients were found six cases of markedly increased vascularity, three of increased vascularity in the bilateral lung, and three of nonbronchial systemic arterial supply to the diseased lung. Of six patients who received reexamination at the time of recurrent bleeding, the arteriogram demonstrated recanalization of previously embolized artery in five and revascularization by collateral circulation in five. In addition, hemoptysis recurred in three (60 percent) of five patients after second embolization and in one (50 percent) of two after third embolization. Four patients underwent surgical therapy: two after the initial embolization, one after the second, and one after the third, and these patients had no recurrence. While arterial embolization as initial treatment of hemoptysis is a highly useful procedure, this is a palliative procedure and potential for recurrence of hemoptysis exists as the lesion that has initially caused hemoptysis is not cured by the embolization. We emphasize that a combination therapy of repeated embolization and surgery will probably improve the efficacy of treatment of recurrent bleeding after initial embolization.\r"

Little is known, however, about how older adults quit and how to help them. No smoking cessation programs have been designed for this population. Here we report the findings of a random survey of American Association of Retired Persons members conducted to learn more about older smokers, their smoking and health characteristics, their quitting motivations and experiences, and the role of physicians' advice to quit. We obtained data on 339 current smokers aged 50 to 102. Current smokers were more likely to be heavy, highly addicted smokers. They also reported more smoking-related symptoms and conditions and fewer preventive tests and check-ups than never-smokers or former smokers. Although 44 percent of smokers were interested in quitting, only 39 percent reported that they had been advised to stop smoking by their physicians in the previous year. Physicians who treat older patients can have a significant impact on helping them to stop smoking by giving them a strong recommendation to quit and by providing appropriate interventions.\r"

Hemodynamic data and 12-lead ECGs were recorded at baseline and during coronary occlusion in 34 patients with left anterior descending artery angioplasty. In the precordial leads V1 through V4, the sum of R-wave amplitude increased in 17 patients, was unchanged in ten, and decreased in seven; the sum of S-wave amplitude decreased in 33 patients (including two patients with complete loss of S wave) and increased in one. Mean R-wave change was 2.7 +/- 6.2 mm, mean S-wave change was -12.9 +/- 9.0 mm, and mean precordial ST elevation was 12.5 +/- 8.7 mm. Absolute R-wave change correlated directly with ST elevations (p = .013), while S-wave change correlated inversely (p less than .007). Only ST elevations correlated with changes in pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PW) (p less than .007). In the precordial lead with maximum ST elevations, only R-wave changes correlated with ST elevations (p = .002), and both R-wave changes and ST elevations correlated with changes in PW (R:p = .027; ST:p = .007). The presence of large increases in R waves or decreases in S wave, or of high-magnitude ST elevations identified patients with the highest elevations in PW. In conclusion, decreases in S waves and, less commonly, increases in R waves are seen with diagnostic ST elevations and may have some limited clinical value. The correlation between magnitude of acute anterior ST elevations and changes in left ventricular filling pressures may have important clinical consequence.\r"

  ".W": "It was hypothesized that subjects with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) receiving long-term oxygen via nasal cannulas have an impaired sense of smell and/or taste. To objectively evaluate the sense of smell and taste, this study used the University of Pennsylvania Identification Test (UPSIT), a 40-item \"scratch-n-sniff\" test and a 20-item taste test using the four basic taste sensations of sweet, salt, sour, and bitter. Twenty subjects (15 male, 5 female) with severe COPD receiving long-term oxygen therapy (group 1), and an equal number of age- and sex-matched subjects with COPD not receiving oxygen therapy (group 2), and a healthy control group (group 3) were studied. Twelve subjects (seven male, five female) from group 1 subsequently underwent transtracheal oxygen catheter installation. Mean +/- SD for the basic smell test was significantly greater in group 3 (35.35 +/- 3.58) as compared with group 1 (27.70 +/- 6.07) or group 2 (31.10 +/- 4.95) (p less than 0.005). The difference between group 1 and 2 was not significant (p = 0.066). However, when adjusted for pack years of smoking, there were no significant differences between the three groups. Mean +/- SD correct responses for the basic taste test were significantly greater in group 3 (15.75 +/- 1.81) as compared with group 2 (12.8 +/- 2.78) (p less than 0.005) and group 1 (14.00 +/- 2.33) (p less than 0.05). There was no significant difference between group 1 and 2. The corrected data for taste, adjusted for years since quitting smoking, did not alter the basic differences between the groups. Mean smell and taste test scores were essentially unchanged in 12 subjects after six months of transtracheal oxygen therapy. Long-term oxygen use via nasal cannulas in this group of subjects with COPD did not appear to impair their sense of smell and taste. Smoking had a significant but variable effect on the sense of smell and taste.\r"

The AWL was obtained by calculating the area difference between pressure-volume tracings obtained without and with humidifiers. To examine the effect of pressure monitoring sites on AWL when a humidifier is placed, we measured AWL at three different pressure monitoring sites. The AWL was affected significantly by the pressure monitoring site for the ventilator. When a pressure monitor sensor was placed on the inspiratory limb between the inspiratory valve and humidifiers, the ventilator was not able to compensate for the pressure drop caused by impedance characteristics of the humidifier equipment. This resulted in significant inspiratory AWL on the patient. Thus, humidifying devices should be carefully selected from the viewpoint of not only humidifying capability but also AWL. Furthermore, we must recognize the importance of the pressure monitoring site for the ventilator.\r"

Seventy-three patients with pleural effusion were studied in order to assess ADA activity (pleural and serum); in 25 of them, a study of delayed cellular immunity (pleural and sanguineous) was performed through B, CD3, CD4, and CD8 lymphocytic populations. The activity of ADA was determined, and the study of lymphocytic populations was made through the use of monoclonal antibodies. The data obtained showed the following: levels of ADA were significantly (p less than 0.0005) higher in the pleural fluid and the serum of tuberculous effusions compared to neoplastic effusions; percentages of CD3 and CD4 T-cells were significantly (p less than 0.05 and p less than 0.0005, respectively) greater in tuberculous effusions. The statistical study of the levels of ADA activity and the percentage of CD4 T-cells in pleural exudates produced a significant regression curve (r = 0.612 and p less than 0.0001) which showed a positive correlation between these two parameters. The pathogenic implications of these results suggest the possibility that ADA could be a new marker of cell-mediated immune activity.\r"

We measured basal MIP and maximal expiratory pressure (MEP) (TLC) at the TLIM and 10, 20, and 30 minutes and MIP was different from the basal value (MIP basal, 85.7 cm H2O; MIP 10 minutes, 79.1 cm H2O; MIP 20 minutes, 78.6 cm H2O; MIP 30 minutes, 79.6 cm H2O. The MEP was not different from the basal value.

We tested this hypothesis in 12 patients with COPD (mean FEV1 = 40 percent predicted; mean DCO, 8.6 ml/min/mm Hg) randomly divided into a treatment and control group and six healthy volunteers. Following establishment of baseline DCO and maximum expiratory flow volume (MEFV) curve values, each subject in the treatment and healthy groups took 400 mg of pentoxifylline three times a day for 12 weeks. Weekly DCO and MEFV curves were measured before treadmill exercise in both COPD groups and before and after exercise in the healthy group. The MEFV curve parameters from the final three weeks of therapy did not differ significantly from baseline values. During this time, however, the treatment COPD group's resting DCO rose by 8.2 +/- 2.4 percent over baseline level (p less than 0.01). Treadmill walk time increased from 17.7 +/- 2.9 minutes to 23.2 +/- 2.9 minutes (p less than 0.02). This was accompanied by improved exercise oxygen saturation measured by oximetry (SoxiO2). Premedication SoxiO2 fell from 92.8 +/- 1.2 percent to 88.6 +/- 2.5 percent during exercise, and from 94.4 +/- 1.1 percent to only 91.8 +/- 1.0 percent after 12 weeks of medication (p less than 0.05). No such improvement was noted in the control COPD group. Although the healthy group's resting SoxiO2 and DCO did not change during treatment, their exercise DCO increased significantly from 36.3 +/- 3.1 ml/min/mm Hg to 41.8 +/- 3.5 ml/min/mm Hg (p less than 0.001). These data demonstrate that pentoxifylline improves gas exchange, possibly by increasing cardiac output, and/or by raising mixed venous PO2, and/or by improving blood flow to underperfused alveoli.\r"

  ".W": "We have used flow cytometric methods to detect and quantify HLA-DR, DQ, and DP antigens and transferrin receptors on alveolar macrophages in lavage samples from 36 patients with granulomatous lung diseases (extrinsic allergic alveolitis [EAA], n = 13; sarcoidosis, n = 23), and 12 patients having fibrosing alveolitis (FA) (cryptogenic fibrosing alveolitis, n = 3; FA and scleroderma, n = 8; FA and primary biliary cirrhosis, n = 1). HLA-DR, DQ, and DP antigens were expressed on the majority of alveolar macrophages in all the patients, and the percentages of positive cells were similar to those in control subjects without lung disease. However, the amounts expressed were higher in those with EAA and sarcoidosis than in the FA group or control subjects, the most significant differences being in HLA-DQ and HLA-DP expression. Transferrin receptor expression was also higher in the granulomatous lung diseases. In sarcoidosis, higher levels of HLA-DQ correlated with lower lung function measurements (Dco p less than 0.025, FVC p less than 0.025, FEV1 p less than 0.005), suggesting this may be a marker of disease activity. HLA-DP levels also showed a trend (p less than 0.1) of inverse correlation with lung function. Levels of HLA-DQ (p less than 0.005) and HLA-DP (p less than 0.001) correlated more closely than HLA-DR with numbers of lymphocytes in the lavage fluids, and HLA-DQ levels correlated with increasing proportions of lymphocytes in proliferation (p less than 0.05). We suggest that high levels of HLA-DQ and DP on alveolar macrophages may be more relevant than HLA-DR to the enhanced antigen-presenting function of these cells in sarcoidosis, and possibly also in EAA.\r"

  ".W": "We evaluated the effect of endobronchial radiation therapy in 52 patients with malignant airway occlusion. Fifty-five endobronchial applications of the radioisotope iridium 192 were carried out. Response was assessed by change in performance status, symptom resolution, duration of symptom relief, roentgenographic reaeration, pulmonary function tests, and postimplant bronchoscopy. Thirty-three patients showed at least a one-level improvement in performance status. Of a total of 166 symptoms present prior to therapy, 131 resolved or improved. Approximately 70 percent of a patient's lifetime was rendered symptom improved or symptom free. A roentgenographic reaeration response of 30/41 (73 percent) was achieved. The average FEV1 and FVC improved from 1.5 to 2.1 L and from 2.3 to 2.9 L, respectively. Posttherapy bronchoscopy was performed between one and two months following the implant in 15 patients who agreed to undergo the procedure. Eleven (73 percent) of 15 had complete tumor regression. Major long-term complications were noted in seven patients. Endobronchial radiation, therefore, appears to be a safe and effective technique to palliate malignant airway occlusion.\r"

Fourteen patients were enrolled and treated for a mean of 13 +/- 7 months. Two failed to respond. Of the 12 who responded, one reactivated while being treated, and one died of myocardial infarction after successful treatment of his fungal infection; six had relapses from nine days to 15 months after treatment was stopped. Only four patients are asymptomatic at a mean of 14 +/- 3 months after cessation of treatment. Fluconazole is well tolerated at this dose. In view of its low toxicity, the partial clinical efficacy observed, and the high recurrence rate of chronic coccidioidal infection, it would be justified to try higher doses.\r"

Seventeen patients with ARDS who did not have significant renal or hepatic dysfunction received PGE1 by continuous central venous infusion (30 ng/kg/min). Seventeen control patients with ARDS without renal or hepatic dysfunction who had similar APACHE II and ARDS scores and causes of ARDS did not receive PGE1. Prostaglandin E1 significantly decreased the SVRI and oxygen extraction ratio. Concentrations of total and polymorphonuclear leukocytes, but not platelets, increased significantly during PGE1 infusion, but did not change in control patients. There was no change in the Do2I and Vo2I during the course of the PGE1 infusion. There were no differences in Do2I and Vo2I during PGE1 infusion between survivors and nonsurvivors. Prostaglandin E1 was infused for a mean of 5.9 +/- 1.8 days (+/- SD) and was discontinued on ten occasions in seven patients because of supraventricular dysrhythmias (n = 4), hypotension (n = 3), thrombocytopenia (n = 3), and cardiac arrest (n = 2). Nonsurvivors had PGE1 discontinued prematurely more frequently than survivors (56 percent [5/9] vs 25 percent [2/8], respectively). The prevalence of multiple-system organ failure and the in-hospital mortality of both PGE1-treated and control patients were not different. Although PGE1 causes significant systemic vasodilation and possibly decreased intrapulmonary polymorphonuclear leukocyte sequestration, PGE1 does not influence multiple-system organ failure or mortality of patients with ARDS without renal or hepatic dysfunction.\r"

In a randomized fashion 21 patients received 5 mg of albuterol by bolus nebulization (BN) at time 0 and again 60 minutes later. Twenty-one others received albuterol (0.2 mg/ml) by CN using a calibrated nebulizer with a known output of 25 ml/h. Thus, each patient had received 10 mg of albuterol over two hours. FEV1, blood pressure (BP), heart rate (HR), respiratory rate (RR), and hand tremor were recorded at 30-minute intervals. The FEV1 was 1.48 +/- 0.64 L prior to BN and increased to a maximum of 2.20 +/- 0.94 L (p less than 0.05) 90 minutes later. The FEV1 prior to CN was 1.13 +/- 0.51 L and improved to 2.20 +/- 1.02 L (p less than 0.05) at 120 minutes. The FEV1 did not differ significantly between regimens over the 2-hour period. Both modes of therapy were well tolerated. There was a slight but significant increase in HR at 30 and 90 minutes in the BN group when compared with CN. There was no significant difference in BP, RR, or tremor between the groups. Thus, albuterol by CN was found to be equally effective as the same medication by BN in the early treatment of asthma in patients seen in the emergency department.\r"

There were no differences in the duration of hospitalization, fever, elevated WBC count, intravenous antibiotic therapy, or the time for roentgenographic resolution of the effusions. There was one death in each group. The infection of the pleural space resolved in 13 of 16 patients treated with antibiotics alone. No recurrence of the infection of the pleural space occurred in these patients. Antibiotics alone were not sufficient in two cases which eventually required chest tube drainage. Therefore, not all complicated parapneumonic effusions require drainage.

A bronchogram and fiberoptic bronchoscopy showed double bronchial branches to the right upper lobe, one from the trachea and the other from the right main bronchus, and a blind pouch of the left lobe. Thoracic computed tomography showed the heart just behind the sternum. Venography showed anomalous continuation of the inferior vena cava and dilated azygos vein.

  ".W": "The aim of this study was to report long-term results of endoscopic Nd-YAG laser therapy in the palliative treatment of 144 esophageal and cardial carcinomas and to define parameters that could predict the long-term outcome in order to better define the indications and limitations of Nd-YAG laser therapy for esophagocardial cancer. One hundred nineteen men and 25 women were treated. The mean age was 67 +/- 12 years. Histology showed 94 patients with squamous cell carcinoma and 50 with cardial or esophageal adenocarcinoma. Improvement of dysphagia was achieved in 119 of the 144 patients (83%) after a median of 2.9 sessions. For the 105 patients initially symptomatically improved by the first laser course, the cumulative probability of remaining symptomatically improved at three and six months was respectively 38.5 +/- 5% and 22 +/- 4%. Four perforations and nine esophagotracheal fistulas occurred. In the stepwise regression analysis (Cox model), among 11 variables, three variables had an independent prognostic value at six months. The importance of improvement after the initial laser treatment (P less than 0.005) and the presence of an adenocarcinoma (P less than 0.05) were positively correlated with the symptom improvement duration. The initial tumor length (P less than 0.01) was negatively correlated with the symptomatic improvement duration. Therefore, in inoperable patients, we think that laser therapy should be proposed first for adenocarcinoma and for squamous cell carcinoma less than 6 cm in length.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Prolonged ambulatory esophageal pH and pressure monitors are being developed to evaluate noncardiac chest pain. This new technology needs comparison with conventional esophageal tests before determining which studies are most useful in diagnosing and treating esophageal chest pain. Therefore, we studied 45 patients with esophageal manometry, acid perfusion and edrophonium tests, and 24 hr pH and pressure monitoring. Manometry was abnormal in 20 patients (44%) with nutcracker esophagus, the most common motility disorder. Fifteen (33%) had positive acid perfusion test and 24 (55%) positive edrophonium test. During ambulatory monitoring, all patients experienced chest pain with a total of 202 individual events: 32 events (15%) secondary to acid reflux, 15 (7%) secondary to motility abnormalities, 7 (3%) to both pH and pressure changes, and 149 events (74%) occurred in the absence of any abnormal pH or motility changes. Patients with normal manometry were significantly (P less than 0.01) more likely to have acid reflux chest pain events than did nutcracker patients, who had an equal frequency of pH and motility events. A positive acid perfusion test was significantly associated with abnormal pressure events (P = 0.02; odds ratio 5.95), while a positive edrophonium test more likely predicted acid reflux chest pain during 24-hr monitoring (P = 0.007; odds ratio 7.25). Therefore, abnormal manometry and positive provocative tests point to the esophagus as the likely source of chest pain. However, ambulatory pH and pressure monitoring are required to accurately define the relationship between chest pain and acid reflux or motility disorders.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "In a series of 31 duodenal ulcer patients (23 males and 8 females), who underwent a highly selective vagotomy, gastric emptying characteristics of a solid meal, labeled with [99mTc]stannous colloid, were assessed before, two weeks and six months after operation. The clinical diagnosis was confirmed by endoscopy and x-ray; failure of treatment with H2 antagonists or antacids during 1-18 (mean 5) years was the direct indication for operative treatment. A temporary delay in gastric emptying is noted two weeks after operation (T1/2: 124 vs 57 min). After six months, gastric emptying time has practically normalized. It appears that this is the result of the preservation of the antropyloric vagal nerve supply. In these patients, a 10% recurrence rate is noted, comparable to the results in the literature. Highly selective vagotomy proves to be a safe and effective procedure with few side effects. It does not impair gastric motility.\r"

  ".W": "Gastric mucosal thickening of variable degree occurs in the vicinity of gastric carcinomas and is possibly related to simultaneous tumor expression of epidermal growth factor and its receptor. Seventeen cases in which both endoscopic biopsy and subsequent resection for gastric carcinoma had been performed were studied to see if putative tumor-related mucosal thickening had an effect on endoscopic biopsy sensitivity. Biopsy fragment positivity rate was greater in cases with exophytic, protruding tumor masses (46.8 +/- 8.5%) than in all other cases (17.0 +/- 4.7%; P = 0.02). Thickness of nontumorous mucosa adjacent to carcinomas did not significantly affect the biopsy fragment positivity rate in cases with exophytic masses (\"thin\" subgroup, 51.0 +/- 16.2%; \"thick\" subgroup, 44.0 +/- 10.8%; P = 0.7) but did reduce the positivity rate significantly (P = 0.05) in ulcerative or infiltrative tumors without exophytic components (\"thin\" subgroup, 23.3 +/- 4.1%; \"thick\" subgroup, 8.4 +/- 2.1%). This reduction in biopsy sensitivity related to mucosal thickening occurring adjacent to nonprotuberant lesions may explain, at least in part, the variable rates of positive biopsies observed with gastric cancers.\r"

  ".W": "The prevalence of symptomatic duodenal ulcer (DU) assessed primarily in alcoholic males with cirrhosis is estimated to be approximately fivefold increased compared to the normal population. Little information is available, however, as to the prevalence of DU in nonbleeding, nonalcoholic subjects with cirrhosis. In order to estimate the prevalence of DU in males with various types of cirrhosis and its relation to the degree of portal hypertension, 216 male cirrhotic patients (165 with parenchymal liver disease and 51 with cholestatic liver disease) being evaluated for liver transplantation at the University of Pittsburgh between January 1985 and June 1987 underwent pan-upper gastrointestinal endoscopy. The prevalence of DU in each group was 7.8%. However, among the various subgroups it was as follows: chronic active hepatitis due to HBV: 9.4%, alcoholic: 12.2%, cryptogenic: 3.5%, autoimmune chronic active hepatitis: 6.6%, primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC): 9.5%. The reference data for this study consist of data reported in the literature obtained in 355 healthy asymptomatic male volunteers. The prevalence of DU in this group is significantly less than in the study group (2.2% vs 7.8%; P less than 0.005). While the estimated risk for a DU is increased 3.71-fold (95% CI: 8.74, 1.57; P less than 0.005) in cirrhotic males in general as compared to normal males, only the subgroups with CAH due to HBV, alcoholism, and PSC were found to have an increased estimated risk of DU (all at least P less than 0.01). No association between the prevalence of DU and degree of portal hypertension could be demonstrated in either group.\r"

  ".U": "90168559\r", 
  ".W": "The aim of this study was to investigate the hypothesis that during the postprandial period in humans, dopamine interrupts the gastrointestinal motility pattern through a mechanism that is peptide-mediated. Fourteen normal human subjects were studied by means of intestinal manometry. After recording two consecutive migrating motor complexes a 900-kcal solid-liquid meal was given. In eight subjects 30 min after the meal, placebo or dopamine (5 micrograms/kg/min) was infused for 15 min and then the recording continued for 120 min. In the remaining six subjects dopamine was administered twice with a 90-min interval in between. In three subjects the first dopamine infusion after the meal was preceded by treatment with placebo, the second by domperidone (20 mg intravenous as bolus), in the other three subjects domperidone was given before the first dopamine infusion. Blood samples for the determination of somatostatin and motilin were drawn basally, during, and immediately after dopamine in seven subjects. The results show that dopamine interrupts the fed motility pattern, inhibiting the high antral waves, and activates a duodenal phase III of migrating motor complexes. The pretreatment with domperidone completely prevented the dopamine effect. Plasma levels of motilin increased significantly during dopamine, while somatostatin blood levels did not change. These findings support the hypothesis that a dopaminergic mechanism may modulate the cycling of duodenal motor complex in humans.\r"

In the work described here, we sought to define the interaction between carnitine and the brush border membrane, which we presumed contained the transport mechanism. Using isolated rat jejunal brush border microvillous membrane vesicles, we found evidence of passive diffusion alone. We found no evidence of carrier-mediated transport--in particular no saturation over a concentration range, inhibition by structural analogs, transstimulation phenomenon, and no influence of sodium ions, potential difference or proton gradients. We conclude that a carnitine transporter does not exist in the brush border membrane of enterocytes and that other cellular mechanisms are responsible for the apparent active transport observed.\r"

  ".U": "90168562\r", 
  ".W": "Previous studies have found a widely variable prevalence of dysplasia and cancer in colonic strictures in patients with ulcerative colitis. Consequently, therapeutic recommendations are conflicting. To better assess the prevalence, we reviewed the clinical and pathological findings in all 27 patients with ulcerative colitis complicated by stricture who were entered into our Inflammatory Bowel Disease Registry. A true stricture was defined as a persistent localized narrowing of the colon found on air-contrast barium enema or on colonoscopy. Upon careful review, 12 of 27 patients were found to have transient colonic spasm, not a stricture, and were excluded. The remaining 15 patients with true strictures represented 3.2% of all ulcerative colitis patients in the registry. Strictures were identified at 13.3 +/- 9.9 years following the diagnosis of ulcerative colitis. Eleven patients had multiple strictures that were principally located in the left colon. Of the 15 patients, 11 had dysplasia and two had cancer found on colonoscopic biopsy. Ultimately, six patients had carcinoma found at colonoscopy or colectomy (three modified Dukes' stage A, one stage B, and two stage D). All cancers were at the site of a stricture. These findings indicate that a true colonic stricture in ulcerative colitis is frequently associated with dysplasia and cancer, which can be diagnosed with colonoscopic biopsy. A stricture should be considered a strong risk factor for cancer, requiring intensive colonoscopic surveillance. If dysplasia is discovered, or if the stricture cannot be adequately biopsied, consideration should be given to total colectomy.\r"

Mean transit time increased after cholera toxin, but there was no change in mean amplitude, duration, and area of contractions. In contrast, there was a reduction in the total amplitude, duration, and area of contractions, and this was due to a decrease in frequency of contractions. The reduction in the total parameters of all contractions could be accounted for by a reduction in the same parameters for propagating contractions. The parameters of nonpropagating contraction were not different after cholera toxin. Also, there was a decrease in the distance of propagation of contractions. Our findings demonstrate that during the secretory state due to cholera toxin the small intestinal motor activity works in a compensatory mode to decrease transit and allow more time for absorption.\r"

  ".W": "We examined the biological and histologic characteristics of a new experimental model of acute necrotizing pancreatitis induced by excessive doses of arginine in rats. Rats were given a single intraperitoneal injection of 500 mg/100 g body weight of L-arginine. At 12-24 hr after the arginine injection, serum levels of amylase, lipase, and anionic trypsin(ogen) reached respective peak values 2, 5, and 20 times those of control rats without arginine and returned to control levels after 24-48 hr. The contents of pancreatic protein, DNA, and digestive enzymes were markedly reduced after the arginine injection and reached their nadirs at 72 hr. After 14 days these levels were almost normal. Histologic examination revealed a number of small vesicles within acinar cells at 6 hr, which were identified as markedly swollen mitochondria by the electron microscope. Other intracellular organelles and nuclei also showed degenerative changes. At 12 hr interstitial edema appeared, and acinar cell necrosis was seen after 24 hr. The extent and severity of necrotic changes of pancreatic exocrine tissue with inflammatory cell infiltration were maximal at 72 hr. At seven days, pancreatic acinar cells began to regenerate, and pancreatic architecture appeared almost normal after 14 days. The present study has demonstrated that the administration of excessive doses of arginine induces a new, noninvasive experimental model of acute necrotizing pancreatitis.\r"

Because these statistics cover the total population of each country, they may give a more representative picture of the true trends than previous analyses concerning only one region or health center. The Hospital In-patient Enquiry was used to evaluate time trends in England-Wales from 1962 to 1985, data from the National Hospital Discharge Survey and the Commission on Professional Activities were used for trends in the United States from 1970 to 1987. A rise of Crohn's disease persisted unabated in the old age groups throughout the observation period. It was less marked in those aged under 35 and reached a plateau during the most recent decade. In ulcerative colitis, discharge rates increased in the older age groups, but remained constant or declined in the middle or younger age groups, respectively. Similar trends were observed in all three surveys. The hospitalization data confirm similar age-specific trends of mortality. The difference between younger and older age groups suggests that generations born 60-80 years ago have become more likely to be affected by IBD leading to hospitalization and mortality. As these high-risk generations grow older, there is a relative rise of hospitalization and mortality from IBD in these subjects.\r"

Seventy-two dogs received three subcutaneous injections of acetaminophen (750, 200, 200 mg/kg body wt) in DMSO (600 mg/ml) at time zero, 9 hr later, and 24 hr after the first dose. Ten control animals (group I) were not given ranitidine, the remaining 62 dogs received an intramuscular injection of ranitidine 30 min before each acetaminophen dose. Three different doses of ranitidine were used (mg/kg body wt): 50 mg, group II (33 dogs); 75 mg, group III (14 dogs); 120 mg, group IV (15 dogs). Ranitidine reduced the expected acetaminophen-induced hepatoxicity in a dose-response manner. Moreover, a significant correlation was found between the ranitidine dose and the survival rate, as evidenced by transaminase levels in the serum and histology of the liver. This model of fulminant hepatic failure induced by acetaminophen and its modulation with ranitidine provides clinical investigators with a research tool that will be useful in the future investigation of putative medical and surgical therapies being investigated for use in the clinical management of fulminant hepatic failure. Because of the size of the animal used in this model, frequent and serial analyses of blood and liver were available for study to determine the effect of therapy within a given animal as opposed to within groups of animals.\r"
