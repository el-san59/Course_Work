Among the first 228 patients treated with Palmaz balloon-expandable intraluminal stents (BEISs) for iliac artery stenosis, stents were used to treat PTA-induced dissection in at least 12 iliac arteries in 11 patients. All 12 vessels were shown by angiography to be severely dissected. Stents were placed at the time of PTA in six vessels and as a separate procedure in the other six. An average of three stents per vessel were employed. All arteries showed marked improvement at angiography. Angiographic follow-up was obtained for eight vessels in seven patients at a mean follow-up time of 12.9 months. All had patent stent lumens with neointima formation, although one stented lumen had narrowed, and another clinical failure occurred despite a patent stented vessel and an ankle-arm index (AAI) of 1.35. With a mean clinical follow-up of 9.5 months, the mean AAI for the stented extremities in the nine remaining patients is 0.91 +/- 0.15. Palmaz BEISs are effective in the management of PTA-induced human iliac artery dissection.\r"

A 2.5 X 2.5-cm2 subcutaneous pocket was dissected for the port. The port was then connected to the catheter, and the incision was closed. Ports have been implanted for a total of 5,290 patient days (5-307 days for an individual patient). Blood transfusion, bolus drug administrations, and 5-day outpatient chemotherapy infusions were successful in all attempts. Blood sampling was successful in 98.9% of attempts. No infectious or thrombotic complications were encountered. Acceptance of this device by patients and nursing staff has been excellent. The initial results indicate that this peripherally placed port is a viable alternative for patients requiring long-term central venous access.\r"

Twenty healthy volunteers were prospectively evaluated with gradient-echo cine MR imaging to determine the frequency, distribution, and timing of appearance of regions of signal void in the healthy population. The most frequent sites included the regions adjacent to the atrioventricular valves, the left ventricular outflow tract, atrial appendages, and areas of venous inflow, including the coronary sinus, superior vena cava, and pulmonary veins. Awareness of normal signal-void areas and their characteristics is critical in the assessment of cardiac cine MR examinations.\r"

CT showed that the center of the femoral head was always located caudal to the level of the inguinal ligament but cranial to the bifurcation of the common femoral artery.

T1-weighted spin-echo images obtained before and after administration of each contrast agent at doses of 0.25, 0.5, and 1.0 mmol/kg showed greater enhancement of the liver with Gd-BOPTA than with Gd-DTPA, with the advantage more evident at lower doses. Images obtained with an inversion recovery sequence at the null value of rat liver parenchyma after injection of 0.1- and 0.5-mmol/kg doses of the contrast agent provided better evidence of the greater and longer-lasting hepatic enhancement due to Gd-BOPTA when compared with that of Gd-DTPA. Gd-BOPTA is a potentially good contrast agent for obtaining prolonged enhancement of the liver, permitting studies during the long time needed to acquire conventional T1-weighted images.\r"

Large extravascular collections of nonionic contrast media can be well tolerated and are often resorbed without adverse sequelae.\r"

The authors used the right main and left main portal veins as landmarks for the transverse scissura, along with the hepatic veins, the gallbladder fossa, and the umbilical fissure to blindly predict the segmental location of each tumor confirmed at surgery. The right main and left main portal veins were found to be consistently near the middle sections through the liver. CTAP findings and surgical descriptions agreed on the primary segmental location of 33 of 36 focal lesions (92%) but disagreed on the extent of 11 of 36 lesions (31%). Further review of the CTAP scans of the 11 lesions revealed that the extent of the lesion was more correctly described at surgery in six masses and at CTAP in four masses; in one lesion, opposite margins of the same mass were correctly described at both surgery and CTAP. Since it may be difficult or impossible to localize deep hepatic lesions intraoperatively by means of palpation or inspection, CTAP is a helpful preoperative tool for determining the segmental location of lesions and for planning the surgical approach.\r"

There were seven perioperative deaths, mainly due to myocardial infarction. Significant perioperative complications arose in 36 cases, including intraoperative lesion of a previous left internal mammary graft (16.2%) or of the right ventricle or anterior descending branch of the left coronary artery (2.8%). Postoperative low output syndrome appeared in 13 patients (18.3%), in seven of whom myocardial infarction was verified. Postoperative bleeding required resternotomy in six cases (9.1%). Because of the heightened operative mortality and morbidity risks, indications for redo CABG should be individualized. A well functioning internal mammary artery graft may be a relative contraindication. Accurate knowledge of the previous operation is essential and, especially in young patients, the possibility of reoperation should be taken into consideration at initial CABG.\r"

Changes in the arterial flow surface were evaluated by scanning electron microscopy immediately after dissection and 2 and 5 days postoperatively. Laser dissection was easier, more accurate and as fast as electrocautery. Moderate to severe degenerative changes and endothelial desquamation were seen in the electrocautery group after dissection, but lesser changes in the laser group. The changes decreased within the next 5 days, but two electrocauterized vessels showed thrombosis at 5 days. Stripping of the internal mammary artery with either method requires great care, and Nd:YAG laser offers a promising alternative to electrocautery in harvesting of that artery as a pedicled graft.\r"

Soft-tissue coverage and primary closure were accomplished with current plastic surgical procedures and good stability of the chest wall was achieved. Protracted respiratory support was required in only one case. Postoperative pain was managed with epidural anesthesia and routine analgesics. Functionally and cosmetically satisfactory long-term results were obtained, with no infection and no need for removal of prosthetic material. The overall 5-year and 10-year actuarial survival rates were 60% and 37.5%.

All histologic specimens and smears from fine-needle aspiration biopsy were reviewed. Intrathoracic goitre, neurogenic lesions and thymomas comprised 62% of all the tumours. Fifty lesions (39%) were found at routine radiographic examination and were asymptomatic. Eight of these 50 lesions were malignant. Chest pain, fatigue, weight loss and fever were significantly more common in malignant than in benign disease. Despite extensive investigations, the diagnosis was not established preoperatively in 32% of the cases. Chest radiography, CT-scanning and fine-needle aspiration biopsy usually provide satisfactory diagnostic information, thereby substantially reducing the need for other preoperative procedures. Early operative intervention is mandatory in these cases.\r"

Radical removal was achieved by thoracotomy and enlargement of the intervertebral foramen in two cases. Thoracotomy and laminectomy were performed on separate occasions in three cases. One patient, in whom the extent of the pathologic process was known preoperatively, underwent concomitant 'minithoracotomy' and laminectomy. Postoperative bleeding required reoperation in one case. The patient with chrondrosarcoma died of local recurrence 16 months postoperatively, and the patient with neuroblastoma died of metastatic spread after 6 years. The five survivors are well. Preoperative recognition of intraspinal extension should be obtainable if a high index of suspicion is maintained in cases of paravertebral tumour. Computed tomography is the diagnostic method of choice. Single-stage removal of the intrathoracic and intraspinal portions of the tumour is desirable. The recommended procedure is posterior minithoracotomy with rib resections for exposure and possibly also laminectomy, with the patient in prone position.\r"

Activation of complement and neutrophil granulocytes during CPB was studied in 96 patients undergoing coronary bypass, with randomized comparisons between four different oxygenators, two of bubble and two of membrane type. Seven patients undergoing thoracotomy without CPB served as controls. During CPB there was significant complement activation, measured as changes in the ratio C3d/C3, with no demonstrable difference between the bubble and membrane oxygenator groups. Such change was not seen in the controls. Neutrophil granulocytes released significant amounts of the granule proteins lactoferrin and myeloperoxidase during CPB, but not during thoracotomy without CPB. The plasma concentrations of lactoferrin and myeloperoxidase were significantly lower in the membrane oxygenator groups, possibly indicating better biocompatibility. The strong inflammatory response with both oxygenator types, however, indicates that presently used CPB devices have unsatisfactory biocompatibility.\r"

In investigations concerning changes in inflammatory activity during bypass, complement activation could not be related to the mentioned clinical parameters.

Moderate hypothermia with topical cardiac cooling and cold cardioplegia were used. Myocardial infarction occurred perioperatively in two patients. Myocardial lactate production was not found before CPB in any patient, but it was common during CPB. Adenosine, inosine and hypoxanthine were released into the coronary sinus blood, but their release did not correlate significantly with lactate production. Myocardial noradrenaline production showed positive correlation with lactate levels (p less than 0.05). Release of adrenaline from the myocardium during CABG was also demonstrated. Myocardial catecholamine production was especially seen in the patients with myocardial infarction. Myocardial catecholamine release seemed to be the most sensitive of the studied biochemical indicators of myocardial ischaemia during CABG.\r"

The tumours are often polypoid, located mainly in the lower two-thirds of the esophagus, and their histologic features resemble those of lentigo maligna melanoma, but with more aggressive biologic behavior. Because of the potential for extensive intramucosal involvement, multicentricity and high local recurrence rate, surgical treatment requires radical excision with a much greater margin than for the common squamous cell carcinomas. Though the outlook is poor, surgery is the favoured treatment with palliative or curative intent, with a 5-year survival rate of 4.2%. Radiotherapy, chemotherapy and immunostimulation currently serve mainly as palliative or adjunctive measures.\r"

Conduction times higher than mean latency + 2 standard deviation may indicate a pathologic conduction slowing. Magnetic stimulation of the motor system is a new painless neurophysiologic technique enabling examination of the central motor pathways in awake subjects.

Three different types of MRI signal patterns were detected in association with these spinal cord injuries. A classification was developed using these three patterns. Type I, seen in ten (27.0%) of the patients, demonstrated a decreased signal intensity consistent with acute intraspinal hemorrhage. Type II, seen in 16 (43.2%) of the patients, demonstrated a bright signal intensity consistent with acute cord edema. Type III, seen in three (8.1%) of the patients, demonstrated a mixed signal of hypointensity centrally and hyperintensity peripherally consistent with contusion. The remaining eight patients had normal cords by MRI. All 37 patients had an admitting neurologic assessment and classification of their spinal injury according to the Frankel classification and the Trauma Motor Index (TMI). At an average of 12.1 months postinjury, their neurologic function was reassessed. Patients with Type I patterns showed no improvement in their Frankel classification and minimal improvement in their TMI, 32.1 to 42.4. In comparison, all of the Type II and III patterns improved at least one Frankel classification. The Type II TMI increased from 70.8 to 91.9 and Type III from 37.3 to 75.7. This preliminary report indicates a distinct correlation between the pattern of spinal cord injury as identified by MRI and neurologic recovery. It appears that the ability of MRI to aid in examination of the condition of the spinal cord will offer a means of predicting neurologic recovery following acute spinal cord injury.\r"

A total of 279 cases have been treated with anterior instrumentation. Complications include breakage of 35 screws and four rods. There have been no early or late vascular or neurologic sequelae related to instrumentation. The biomechanical basis for the treatment of kyphotic deformities includes an anterior distractive force to resist compressive loads and, where possible, segmental fixation to decrease sagittal bending moments combined with bone grafts far from the neutral axis. This system provides these benefits with minimal risk and morbidity.\r"

Although false-positive elevations of serum CK-MB occurred, no patient had a CK-MB value exceeding 50 IU/liter combined with an LD-1/LD-2 ratio exceeding 1.0 (so-called \"flipped LD\" pattern). In evaluating suspected postoperative myocardial infarction, the authors recommend determining the isoenzymes of both serum creatine kinase and lactate dehydrogenase.

All screws were tested under similar conditions. The results obtained have permitted the authors to rank the various screws tested in terms of performance as follows: 1) the Steffee screw, 2) the AO screw, 3) the Howmedica screw, and 4) the Roy-Camille screw. While the considerable variability of the bone material is recognized, the screw performance is also influenced by the geometric variables of screw design; improvements in the pullout strength can be achieved by an increase in the major diameter of the screw; screw displacement before failure appears related to the screw pitch, where an increase in the pitch of the screw will increase the amount of displacement before failure; screw angulation was found to have little effect on the pullout strength, but may have an effect on the screw displacement and energy absorption before failure.\r"

Lack of previously available data is addressed here by body height measurements closely spaced in time of ten normal subjects during 8 hours upright and 4 hours recumbent, with particular attention paid to the initial changes. Experimental errors are carefully defined and determined. A Kelvin-unit model is fitted to the mean data for each phase and confidence limits provided for the model equation parameters. Rapid height changes are shown to occur: 26% of the 8-hour loss occurred in the first hour upright, and 41% of the 4-hour recovery occurred in the first hour recumbent.\r"

Relocation of the most distal pain in a proximal or central direction characterizes the pain behavior when patients are assessed in this fashion. Centralization typically occurs rapidly and can be maintained. In a review of 87 such patients, centralization occurred in 76 (87%). Its occurrence during initial mechanical evaluation is a very accurate predictor of successful treatment outcome and reliably determines the appropriate direction of treatment exercise. Nonoccurrence of centralization accurately predicts poor treatment outcome and was a helpful early predictor of the need for surgical treatment.\r"

Various staining techniques were supplemented by polarized light microscopy. Both the transverse and the alar ligaments consist of collagen fibers, with very few elastic fibers in the peripheral layer. In the central portion of the transverse ligament, the collagen fibers cross each other at an angle of approximately 30 degrees. Close to the dens, the transverse ligaments show on their ventral side a transition into fibrocartilage. Except for the immediate site of failure, no differences became evident between tested specimens and controls. The collagen, as the almost exclusive constituent, together with the fiber orientation determine the mechanical properties of these ligaments. This supports the hypothesis that the ligaments could be irreversibly overstretched or even ruptured when the head is rotated and, in addition, flexed by impact trauma, especially in unexpected rear-end collisions.\r"

The fine structure of LF was composed of elastic and elaunin fibers. Small diameter collagen fibrils were found between the elastic system fibers. The ISL was constituted predominantly of collagen fibrils. Elastic fibers were seen in the most ventral part of the ligament. In ISL and LF of the control group, the cells were fibroblastic-like cells. Chondrocytes were present only near their attachment sites. The proteoglycans were demonstrated between the collagen fibrils, and they appeared to form a regular interfibrillar linking. In ligaments obtained from patients with disc herniation, several modifications were found. The fibroblasts transformed into chondrocytic cells, which were surrounded by a pericellular matrix rich in proteoglycan filaments. A few cells that had suffered necrosis were found. Alterations in the collagen-proteoglycans arrangement also were evidenced. The proteoglycan filaments were randomly oriented to the collagen fibrils.\r"

  ".W": "The purpose of this study was to evaluate the reliability and variability of repeated measurements of isometric (IM) lumbar extension (LB EXT) strength made at different joint angles. Fifty-six men (age, 29.4 +/- 10.7 years) and 80 women (age, 24.3 +/- 9.1 years) completed IM LB EXT strength tests on 3 separate days (D1, D2, and D3). On D1 and D2, subjects completed two tests (T1 and T2) separated by a 20- to 30-minute rest interval. For each test, IM LB EXT strength was measured at 72, 60, 48, 36, 24, 12, and 0 degrees of lumbar extension. Mean IM strength values, within-day reliability coefficients, and test variability over the seven angles improved from D1 to D2 (D1: mean, 160.0 to 304.1 N.m, r = 0.78 to 0.96, SEE = 37.6 to 46.9 N.m; D2: mean, 176.3 to 329.1 N.m, r = 0.94 to 0.98, SEE = 29.0 to 34.4 N.m). Mean strength values leveled off by D3 (174.5 to 317.0 N.m). The most reliable test results showed that the IM LB EXT strength curves were linear and descending from flexion to extension and ranged from 235.8 +/- 85.2 to 464.9 +/- 150.7 N.m for men (extension to flexion) and from 134.6 +/- 53.2 to 237.3 +/- 71.9 N.m for women. Lumbar extension strength was clearly greatest in full flexion, which is in contrast to previously reported results. One practice test was required to attain the most accurate and reliable results. These data indicate that repeated measures of IM LB EXT strength are highly reliable and can be used for the quantification of IM LB EXT strength through a range of motion.\r"

Using weight and pulley tests and manipulative testing in a torque apparatus, the movement produced by twisting the spine was found not to be pure axial rotation, but rather movement coupled with various combinations of lateral bending and flexion or extension. This motion may not be possible in testing an individual mobile segment. The twisting movements of the spine do not normally produce gaping of the zygapophyseal joints. These joints adapt to the axial rotation by the compliance of their articular cartilages and the movement of fat pads in and out of the joint capsule. Hypermobility appears to be associated with evidence of damage to part of the mobile segment, suggesting that the hypermobility (gaping) at a joint could be due to instability caused by injury.\r"

Adhesions judged sufficient to possibly cause additional nerve disruption on separation were found in 16% of the specimens at the L3-4 level; 40% at the L4-5 level; and 36% at the L5-S1 level. Dural tissue segments, taken from the forcefully separated more firmly fixed adhesions found only at the L4-5 level, microscopically showed disruption of neurovascular bundles containing branches of the sinuvertebral nerve where they coursed between the adherent dura and the posterior longitudinal ligament. It was assumed that forced separation of adhesions during disc protrusion could add to perceived discomfort.\r"

Three anatomic groups were identified. Group 1 showed conglomerations of adherent nerve roots residing centrally within the thecal sac. Group 2 demonstrated nerve roots adherent peripherally to the meninges, giving rise to an \"empty sac\" appearance. Group 3 showed a soft tissue mass replacing the subarachnoid space.

Nitrogen-ion implantation parameters were varied in the first part of the study to obtain the best implantation characteristics. Using this optimal parameter for N(+)-implantation, the performance of two matched groups were compared at two bending moments near the \"knee\" of the S-N curves. At 3.96 N-m and 5.09 N-m of applied bending moments, the increase in the mean fatigue life for the former was 98% and for the latter 20%. The 98% prolongation was statistically significant at P less than 0.005; however, the 20% increase was statistically insignificant (P less than 0.1). The implantation depth is about 0.1 mu in the near surface of the screw. This appears to be thick enough to inhibit crack initiation at 3.96 N-m, but only marginally at 5.09 N-m. Increasing the implantation depth has the potential of increasing the fatigue life at the higher bending moments.\r"

Fusion rates in excess of 90% were noted in patients who had undergone one- and two-level fusions, whereas the fusion rate for three-level procedures dropped to 77.8%. Acceptable clinical results were seen in approximately 80% of the primary low-back pain and the postlaminectomy patients. Results within the group of patients who had undergone previous fusion procedures were less favorable: two thirds good or fair. The available evidence suggests that this procedure is a valid surgical technique, especially applicable to multilevel lumbar fusions and the postlaminectomy patient. Despite its seemingly radical nature, it can be performed quickly and safely with adequate surgical training.\r"

The total amount of postoperative pain medication consumed and postoperative temperature curves in each group were compared to determine how postsurgical morbidity was affected by the MICRO and STND procedures. At a mean follow-up interval of 12.3 and 41 months, 97% of the MICRO respondents reported a good or excellent outcome. Patients with preoperative symptoms exceeding 6 months returned to work in 9.9 +/- 1.7 weeks; this interval decreased to 5.58 +/- 0.75 weeks, and overall outcome score improved significantly at 41 months' follow-up if symptoms were less than or equal to 6 months in duration before surgery. At 44 months' mean follow-up, 88% of the STND respondents reported a good or excellent outcome with no decrease in the return-to-work interval in patients who described symptoms of 6 months or less. Mean postoperative pain medication consumed by MICRO patients was one tenth that of STND patients, and temperature curves showed significant temperature elevations in the STND group when compared with the MICRO group, in which patients remained afebrile throughout the postoperative period. Within the limitations of a retrospective study, these data support the conclusion that a microsurgical approach to the lumbar herniated disc provides a more frequent and rapid convalescence than the STND approach.\r"

We cannot determine whether the MI/dysrhythmia was itself a lethal event. The damage to her lower medulla and upper cervical cord, which most likely occurred at the time of her intubation, was a lethal injury. The presence of spinal cord ischemic changes and acute inflammatory cells within the cord indicate that the cervical spine injury occurred premortem. This patient had no neck pain, no neurologic symptoms or signs, and had AAS of 8 mm. Weissman suggests that 9 mm of AAS is the critical amount. The 1-mm subluxation difference here is probably not significant, because there is inherent error when measuring radiographs. We took into account her clinical and radiographic data, and decided to manage her C1-C2 articulation nonoperatively. Nevertheless, her atlanto-axial joint consisted of abnormal soft and hard tissue. This joint was satisfactory for her usual activities of daily living. The anteroposterior forces generated during ACLS intubation, which are unlikely to disrupt a normal atlanto-axial joint, were sufficient to subluxate her joint. This case demonstrates that it behooves us to maintain a high level of awareness for potential cervical spine problems in all rheumatoid arthritis patients.\r"

Eleven patients underwent local excision and 16 underwent partial liver resection (extended right hepatic lobectomy in 12, left hepatic lobectomy in 3, and extended left hepatic lobectomy in 1). The 60-day hospital mortality rate was 7.4% (2 patients). None of 11 patients who underwent local excision and only 1 (5.5%) of 18 patients who had not undergone previous surgery, or preoperative biliary drainage, died in the hospital. The overall median and mean survival times for the 24 patients who left the hospital were 25 and 29 months, respectively (range, 5 to 80 months). Twenty patients died after a median survival of 22 months (mean, 25 months; range, 5 to 80 months). Four patients are alive and well at 45, 48, 51, and 54 months. Estimated (Kaplan-Meier) survival rates for all 27 patients at 1, 3, and 5 years were 70%, 26%, and 22%, respectively, with almost all patients dying of persistent or recurrent local disease. Survival time after hepatic resection was not statistically different from that after local excision of the lesion (p greater than 0.1). The difference in survival times between patients with histologic clearance and those with microscopically positive or close (less than 1 mm) resection margins was marginally significant statistically (p = 0.037). The quality of life was good. These results are in agreement with those of other studies employing treatment by excision and emphasize the need to assess all patients with hilar cholangiocarcinoma with a view to resection before the adoption of surgical bypass or palliative intubational procedures. However, further progress is unlikely to be made without significant advances in adjuvant therapy.\r"

The segmental graft allows transplantation of segments of livers from adult donors into infants and small children of up to a weight ratio of 8 to 9. The technique of the split liver, whereby one single donor liver is divided in such a way as to obtain two viable grafts for transplantation into two different recipients, is the most recent technical variant used to increase the flexibility of liver replacement and maximize the use of the donor liver pool. We report herein our two first cases of split liver with transplantation in four different recipients, with two long-term survivors. The described technique can also be useful in urgent adult transplantation.\r"

Albumin-coated Dacron (ACD) is a new development in vascular graft fabrication. However, albumin acts as a receptor for certain gram-positive bacterial adhesions. Five pathogenic, coagulase-negative Staphylococcus epidermidis strains were used to measure the differential microbial adherence to ACD versus untreated velour-knitted Dacron (VKD) vascular prostheses. Specimens of VKD, preclotted VKD, and ACD were inoculated with each of the five strains (10(7) colony-forming units/ml) for 2, 4, 8, 12, and 24 hours. After incubation, graft specimens were washed to remove nonadherent organisms and oscillated ultrasonically to remove adherent organisms. The sonication effluent was plated to trypticase soy agar to quantitate the adherent organisms. Adherence was significantly greater (p less than 0.01) to VKD compared with preclotted VKD and ACD at 2, 4, 8, and 24 hours. Four of the five study strains demonstrated significantly greater adherence to VKD than to either ACD or preclotted VKD. Adherence of S. epidermidis increased with exposure time. Albumin bonded to velour-knitted Dacron does not increase coagulase-negative staphylococcal adherence compared with the noncoated vascular prostheses. Binding albumin to vascular prostheses does not increase the risk of staphylococcal colonization.\r"

To investigate the effect of these changes on graft platelet reactivity, indium 111-labeled platelet accumulation on two grafts of differing porosity and thrombogenicity (polytetrafluoroethylene [PTFE] and Dacron) was measured 1, 7, and 21 days after graft implantation in canine carotid arteries. Pseudointima structure, weight, and collagen content were also determined at each measurement interval. In addition, platelet accumulation on carotid autografts and dissected carotid arteries was determined for comparison. Platelet accumulation on all grafts and arteries diminished significantly (p less than 0.05) between 1 and 7 days. Platelet accumulation on autografts and dissected arteries decreased further between 7 and 21 days and approached baseline. In contrast, platelet accumulation on Dacron grafts increased significantly (p less than 0.05) between 7 and 21 days to levels above those measured at 1 day, whereas platelet accumulation in PTFE grafts increased minimally and remained significantly below 1-day levels. A thick pseudointima that contained significant amounts of collagen developed in Dacron grafts during this time period, and a thin, incomplete pseudointima containing minimal collagen covered PTFE grafts. These differences in pseudointimal platelet reactivity and composition were associated with decreased patency of Dacron grafts (78%) compared to PTFE grafts (89%).\r"

However, toxicity of this therapy remains a major problem with its use in some patients. In this study we examined whether steroids could reduce the adverse cardiopulmonary effects of rIL-2. Seven sheep were surgically prepared with vascular catheters and lung lymph fistulas. Each sheep received either a single dose of rIL-2 (100 micrograms/kg) or rIL-2 plus methylprednisolone (30 mg/kg) followed by the reverse treatment 1 week later. Lung lymph flow increased markedly after rIL-2 with a peak QL of 140% +/- 30% (above baseline). Steroid pretreatment significantly reduced this lymph flow increase with peak lung lymph flow being only 40% +/- 16% (p less than 0.004). The lymph/plasma protein ratio tended to increase after rIL-2, but these changes were not statistically significant. After rIL-2, cardiac output, heart rate, core temperature, and mean pulmonary artery pressure increased (p less than 0.05), whereas systemic vascular resistance and arterial PO2 decreased (p less than 0.05). These changes did not occur with steroid pretreatment. The results of this study demonstrate that steroids reduced the adverse cardiopulmonary effects of rIL-2. We believe that rIL-2 induces activation of arachidonic acid metabolism, which leads to the production of multiple inflammatory mediators that cause increased microvascular permeability and the adverse cardiopulmonary effects of rIL-2.\r"

The purpose of this study was to delineate the effects of the opiate agonist methionine-enkephalin on intestinal water and electrolyte transport, with the stable analog D-ala2-metenkephalinamide (m-ENK). Ileal segments from New Zealand white rabbits (n = 39) were harvested and vascularly and luminally perfused ex vivo. Net fluxes of H2O, Na+, and Cl- were calculated for three 20-minute periods: basal, drug infusion, and recovery. Six groups were studied: (1) control, (2-4) m-ENK at three doses, (5) naloxone, and (6) naloxone plus m-ENK. Oxygen consumption and arterial perfusion pressure were assessed as measures of metabolic activity and viability. The control and naloxone groups had no changes in the fluxes of water and electrolytes. Significant proabsorptive effects were demonstrated for the fluxes of H2O, Na+, and Cl- at increasing doses of m-ENK (p less than 0.05). Naloxone completely prevented m-ENK-induced absorption. These results with exogenous m-ENK suggest that endogenous methionine-enkephalin, serving as an enteric neurotransmitter and acting through naloxone-sensitive opiate receptors, may function as a physiologic modulator of intestinal water and electrolyte absorption.\r"

After instrumentation and baseline measurements, citrated autologous plasma (1.5 ml/kg) was lavaged into each lung (n = 6). A control group was administered the same dose of buffered saline solution (n = 4). Hemodynamic parameters, blood gases, and lung compliance were monitored for 2 hours after lavage. Surfactant function, assessed with a Wilhelmy balance, and extravascular lung water measured gravimetrically were determined at the end of the experiment. Immediately after plasma lavage, a nonsegmental atelectasis was observed on the lung surface. Little change was seen in vascular pressures or cardiac output in either group, whereas partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood and static compliance fell significantly after plasma lavage. Two hours after lavage, a large amount of white foam was observed in both large and small airways in the plasma group. Plasma but not saline lavage elevated surface tension minimum in pulmonary tissue. Airway foam contained functional surfactant; addition of plasma to normal surfactant on the Wilhelmy balance did not inhibit surfactant function. Extravascular lung water was increased in the plasma compared with the saline lavage group. These data suggest that plasma usurps surfactant from the alveolar hypophase rather than inhibiting its ability to lower surface tension. Because little change was measured in vascular pressures and it is unlikely that autologous plasma increases vascular permeability, we conclude that the edema was the result of high alveolar surface tension.\r"

Metastatic disease was identified in the lymph nodes of 127 patients (58.6%). The hypogastric nodes were involved in two thirds of the patients with lymph node metastases, and in 29 percent the hypogastric nodes were the only site of metastasis. No increased operative morbidity was documented as a result of extending the level of the pelvic lymphadenectomy to include the lower hypogastric nodes. We conclude that although the lower hypogastric lymph nodes have not been routinely included in most pelvic lymphadenectomies, their removal is important in detecting metastases.\r"

A significant correlation was identified between the weight of resected BPH tissue and the serum PSA (p less than or equal to 0.001; r = 0.54). No such correlation was seen in the CaP patients. By arbitrarily dividing the serum PSA by the prostate weight, it was possible to devise an index. This index corrected PSA in relation to prostatic size and unlike PSA in isolation did not differ significantly between normal controls and those with BPH. The index in CaP was significantly greater than that of either controls or BPH (p less than or equal to 0.001). Furthermore the index of metastatic CaP (M1) was significantly higher than that of nonmetastatic disease (MO) (p = 0.05). The higher index found in CaP would seem to be related to the bulk metastatic tumor, either manifest or occult. Comparing the index of CaPs to that found in normal and benign disease (a constant) offers a possible means of estimating the extent of local and metastatic tumor mass.\r"

Several studies, including the recent identification of the product of an oncogene, c-erb-A, as a thyroid-hormone receptor, have shown possible involvement of thyroid hormone in the process of carcinogenesis. A recent anecdotal observation of an unusually high incidence of thyroid dysfunction in women with renal cell carcinoma led to a retrospective review of the incidence and distribution of thyroid disorders in women with renal cell carcinoma compared with a control group of women with transitional cell carcinoma of the renal pelvis, ureter, bladder, or urethra. Women with renal cell carcinoma had a statistically significantly higher percentage of hypothyroidism, thyroid disease in general, and the use of thyroid-hormone supplements as compared with the control group (P = 0.033, P = 0.005, P = 0.041, respectively). The nature of the relationship, however, could not be determined. These findings add a new dimension to renal cell carcinoma, and prospective studies are encouraged to define the contribution of thyroid hormone to renal cell carcinogenesis.\r"

In the acute study, arteriogenic impotence was induced in 6 dogs by bilateral ligation of the penile arteries just proximal to the crus of the penis. The cavernous vein and penile artery were anastomosed proximal to the site of ligation, and the pudendal vein was ligated proximally to prevent the diversion of arterial blood away from the penis. Erection was induced either by electrostimulation of the cavernous nerves or by intracavernous injection of papaverine, and the erectile response was studied before and after cavernous vein arterialization. Four dogs were followed up for two months to evaluate the long-term effects of the procedure. Shortly after arterialization of the cavernous vein, the basal flow rate in the internal pudendal artery increased dramatically to almost six times the control rate, and the erectile response to neurostimulation was approximately 85 percent of control. Selective pudendal arteriography at two months confirmed the patency of all arteriovenous anastomoses. However, scanning electron microscopy and histologic examination revealed sinusoidal damage most probably consequent to the chronically elevated arterial flow.\r"

The density, character, and change in volume of the retroperitoneal mass on computerized tomography before and after chemotherapy were compared with the histology in the primary tumor and in the residual mass. One of 6 patients without teratoma in the primary tumor had a 97 percent reduction in the mass which contained residual teratoma. Two patients with residual seminoma had a 50 percent decrease in tumor volume, and both patients died of tumor progression despite salvage chemotherapy. Two patients with pure seminomas had only residual fibrosis in masses that decreased in volume by 77 and 75 percent, respectively. One of these masses was discrete and the other was diffuse. Seven of 9 patients (78%) with teratoma in the primary tumor had either teratoma (4 of 9, 44%) or carcinoma (3 of 9, 33%) in the residual mass, and the change in mass volume ranged from a 93 percent decrease to a 540 percent increase in size. All 7 patients with residual teratoma and/or carcinoma remain free of disease after observation or further chemotherapy. For the entire series, the mass density and character did not correlate consistently with the primary tumor or residual mass histology. Residual fibrosis alone or teratoma and/or carcinoma were seen with least (0 to 50%) and greatest (more than 90%) decreases in mass volume.\r"

Five of these patients have been studied urodynamically and radiographically in the postoperative period. Incontinence was found to be minimal and related only to a prolonged catheterization interval. Passive filling pressure and peristaltic pressure remained low in all patients and was lower than the nipple valve pressure in 4 of 5 patients. A transient increase in reservoir pressure at capacity with peristalsis exceeded the nipple peristaltic pressure in 1 patient and was associated with a small volume of incontinence. This resolved with a shortened catheterization interval. Reflux was not found in any subject studied. These studies indicate that the cecal segment can be used to construct a continent urinary reservoir that provides satisfactory function for the patient while maintaining an acceptable pressure volume relationship.\r"

  ".W": "Low birth weight is the major determinant of infant mortality. Continuing declines in infant mortality in the United States are due to the use of neonatal intensive care services; less progress has been made toward preventing low birth weight. I examined how the demographic, socioeconomic, and health services use variables affected rates of low birth weights in Pima County, Arizona, in 1985. Women at greatest risk of having the smallest infants were those younger than 21 years and those with fewer than 6 prenatal visits. Nulliparous women with fewer than 6 prenatal visits showed a still greater risk of having an infant of low birth weight. Women without medical insurance coverage had babies with the lowest mean birth weights, as well as significantly fewer prenatal visits. As the number of uninsured in the United States increases, the effect of lack of insurance among pregnant women becomes increasingly important. To prevent low-weight births, comprehensive maternity care services must be available to all pregnant women regardless of ability to pay.\r"

  ".W": "Results of recent clinical trials have unequivocally established the value of intravenous thrombolytic therapy in enhancing survival after acute myocardial infarction. However, the optimum long-term antithrombolytic strategy for prevention of recurrent cardiac complications after thrombolysis is unknown at the current time. To determine whether aspirin or warfarin best prevents postdischarge recurrent cardiac events (unstable angina, reinfarction, pulmonary edema, or/and death), we analyzed the long-term course of 203 patients at our institution who received intravenous thrombolytic therapy (streptokinase, tissue plasminogen activator, or urokinase) for acute myocardial infarction. Of these, 129 (64%) survived to hospital discharge without revascularization--92 patients (71%) received aspirin (325 mg/day). whereas 37 (29%) received warfarin. The choice of drug was made by the treating physician. By a mean of 2.5 years of follow-up, 34 of 92 patients receiving aspirin (37%) versus 6 or 37 receiving warfarin (16%) (p less than or equal to 0.02) had unstable angina, reinfarction, pulmonary edema, and/or death. No life-threatening hemorrhage occurred in either group. Warfarin appears to be superior to aspirin long term in patients with postlysis myocardial infarction for the prevention of recurrent cardiac complications.\r"

  ".W": "To determine whether or not angiographic coronary morphology can predict future development/progression of narrowing, we reviewed coronary angiograms (CAGs) from 29 patients who underwent CAG studies twice but who had no myocardial revascularization during the period of the studies. The mean age of the patients was 52.9 +/- 8.5 years, and the mean interval between the studies was 25.4 +/- 22.6 months. Mean luminal diameter stenosis of 77 lesions that reduced the diameter by 50% or more on either CAG, but were not totally occluded on the initial CAG, increased from 62% to 79% (p less than 0.01). Progression of stenosis developed in 35 lesions (45%); the progression in 13 lesions of the 35 (37%) was on sites associated with no stenosis or mild stenosis on the initial CAG. No relation was found between the development/progression of stenosis and either its initial severity or elapsed time; however, the prevalence of the development/progression of stenosis was more frequent on sites with possible or probable ruptured atheromatous plaque on the initial CAG than on sites without such plaque (p less than 0.05). The evidence suggests that there is no apparent relation between the future development/progression of coronary narrowing and either the severity of stenosis on the initial CAG or elapsed time but that some of the development/progression can be predicted on the basis of certain specific coronary morphology.\r"

Risk factors were more closely related to the extent score than to either the stenosis or vessel scores (Total R2 = 0.35 versus 0.28 (p less than 0.001) and 0.25 (p less than 0.001), respectively). The extent score was more closely related to age (r = 0.30, p less than 0.05), than was either stenosis (r = 0.21 ns) or vessel score (r = 0.26, p less than 0.05). Apolipoprotein B was the strongest predictor of both extent and stenosis scores but was more closely related to the extent score (r = 0.36, p less than 0.05), even after correction for age and gender. This new angiographic score that assesses the extent of coronary disease is simple to perform and correlates better with age and lipoprotein risk factors than conventional scores do.\r"

The plasma nifedipine-L concentration in smokers (46.0 +/- 7.4 ng/ml) was significantly lower than that in nonsmokers (88.2 +/- 1.2 ng/ml). Nifedipine-L did not affect platelet aggregation induced by adenosine diphosphate, collagen, or epinephrine in either smokers or nonsmokers. The plasma beta-thromboglobulin level on the tenth day of nifedipine-L administration in nonsmokers was lower than that in smokers, but there were no significant differences either with or without nifedipine-L or between nonsmokers and smokers. Nifedipine-L had no effect on the concentration of platelet factor 4 in either smokers or nonsmokers. On the other hand, nifedipine-L significantly decreased the plasma TxB2 and 6-keto-PGF1 alpha concentrations in both smokers and nonsmokers. Thus we concluded that nifedipine-L suppressed the production of plasma TxB2 from platelets and also subsequently suppressed the production of 6-keto-PGF1 alpha and that this action was not affected by cigarette smoking.\r"

A 1.3 cm. diameter nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) surface coil was placed adjacent to the myocardium perfused by this vessel. The animals were divided into two groups of eight animals each, treatment and control. The rabbits were studied using a 2.0 T magnetic resonance (MR) spectrometer, and baseline spectra were acquired. The treatment animals then received intravenous propranolol (1.5 mg/kg) and the control animals received an equal volume of saline. Spectra were then acquired during a 20-minute occlusion period and during subsequent reperfusion. Animals in both groups showed expected decreases in phosphocreatine and adenosine triphosphate and an increase in inorganic phosphate during occlusion; these changes reverted toward baseline values with reperfusion. There were no significant differences between the two groups. The myocardium became acidotic during occlusion in both groups, but significantly more so in the control animals: during the first 10 minutes of occlusion pH was 7.30 +/- 0.41 in the treatment group versus 6.55 +/- 0.24 for controls (p = 0.0005). During the second 10 minutes of occlusion pH was 7.05 +/- 0.65 in the treatment group versus 6.24 +/- 0.25 in controls (p = 0.0053). We conclude that attenuation of intracellular acidosis by propranolol during myocardial ischemia was evident by MR spectroscopy in this animal model.\r"

We screened 131 patients with peripheral vascular disease who underwent intravenous dipyridamole thallium testing to determine cardiac event rates over an average follow-up of 18 +/- 10 months. Of the 131 patients, 111 subsequently had peripheral vascular surgery. The patients with abnormal thallium scans after dipyridamole had a significantly higher risk of death or myocardial infarction, both in the perioperative phase (7% versus 0%; p less than 0.001) and at late follow-up (17% versus 6%; p less than 0.01). The risk of a cardiac event was two-fold greater when a reversible as compared to a fixed thallium defect was present. Multivariate analysis selected the number of thallium segments with perfusion defects, prior history of angina pectoris, and chest pain during dipyridamole testing as perioperative predictors of a cardiac event. A reversible thallium defect was the only predictor of death or nonfatal myocardial infarction during late follow-up. Thus intravenous dipyridamole thallium scintigraphy is a useful noninvasive test for risk stratification of patients before peripheral vascular surgery and provides prognostic information as to the risk of a cardiac event in the 2-year period after the test. A reversible thallium defect is associated with a significant increased risk and would indicate that coronary angiography should be considered and preoperative coronary revascularization.\r"

In six patients (group A), the interval after myocardial infarction was from 7 days to 7 months, and in five patients (group B), it was from 1 to 4 years. Imaging was performed with a superconducting magnet operating at 0.5 T with spin-echo sequence and ECG-gated multiple slices of 5 mm thickness. Myocardial signals were increased in group A, and the region of high signal intensity corresponded to the site of myocardial infarction. The signal intensity within the myocardium was homogeneous in five patients in group B. Coronary arteries were visualized in 20 of 22 instances. Signals within the coronary artery were observed in all 14 instances with poor contrast runoff from the coronary aneurysm, and 11 of these vessels showed high signal intensity. In all six instances in which large aneurysms with severe stenosis were present, signals in the coronary artery were increased. In contrast, high signal intensity in the coronary artery was not observed in five of six instances with good contrast runoff. Signals in the coronary arterial cavity and high signal intensity in the coronary artery persisted in five of six instances with turbulent coronary flow. The findings of increased coronary arterial signals suggested stagnant blood flow in the coronary aneurysm. In conclusion, magnetic resonance imaging was a useful modality for assessment of myocardial infarction and coronary artery lesions in Kawasaki disease.\r"

Continuous six-lead ECGs of PVCs and sustained VT induced with programmed stimulation were recorded. A computer program divided the PVCs and VT beats of each patient into distinct morphologic groups and a representative waveform was obtained by averaging the PVC and VT beats of the group members. A correlation coefficient was then derived between the QRS complexes of each PVC and VT morphology. The mean number of PVC morphologies was 12 +/- 8 per patient (range 1 to 26), the mean number of VT morphologies was 2 +/- 1 per patient (range 1 to 5). The correlation coefficient between the dominant PVC morphology and a VT morphology was greater than 0.7 in only three patients. The combined percent contribution of all PVCs with morphologies that were at least possibly identical to those of VT averaged only 13%. Thus PVCs with morphologies identical to those of VT are present in some patients with sustained VT, but these constitute a small proportion of all PVCs.\r"

Patients with paroxysmal ventricular tachycardia were classified by their response to exercise or catecholamines. Atenolol was effective in each patient (n = 5) whose tachycardia was precipitated or exacerbated by exercise or catecholamines when the patient was receiving a dosage of approximately 1.7 mg/kg/day. In those patients (n = 4) in whom exercise or catecholamines either suppressed or had no effect on the tachycardia, none were effectively treated in spite of receiving comparable dosages. Three of these four patients also had structural abnormalities or myocardial dysfunction. Atenolol was effective in treating 4 of 10 patients with long QT syndrome with a dosage of approximately 1.5 mg/kg/day. Six ineffectively treated patients received similar dosages, and four required either additional medication or surgical sympathectomy for persistent syncope. The other two patients died suddenly. Cardiovascular side effects included bradycardia in three patients and hypotension in one. Noncardiovascular effects included mild fatigue (four patients) headache (two), sleep disturbance (two), and difficulty concentrating (one). The medication was discontinued because of side effects in two patients. Atenolol is more likely to be effective in the suppression of paroxysmal ventricular tachycardia in children if the tachycardia is exacerbated by exercise or catecholamines and if the heart is otherwise normal.\r"

Six children, aged 4 to 10 years, who had closure of VSD and who on lung biopsy showed PVOD, received intravenous diazoxide (1, 2, 4, 5, and 6 mg/kg) after measurements of pulmonary artery pressure (PAP), pulmonary flow index (PFI) by thermodilution technique, and PVR were made. The PAP (51 +/- 19 mm Hg versus 45 +/- 16 mm Hg) and PVR (11.5 +/- 2.7 units versus 8.9 +/- 3.8 units) though decreased, did not attain statistical significance (p greater than 0.1). The PFI (3.2 +/- 1.1 versus 3.4 +/- 0.6 L/min/m) did not change (p greater than 0.1). After oral diazoxide (5 to 10 mg/kg per day) for 20 +/- 3.4 months, the PAP (50.8 +/- 19 mm Hg) and PVR (10.6 +/- 5.8 units) did not decrease (p greater than 0.1), but PFI (4.4 +/- 0.9 L/min/m2), though increased, did not attain significance (p greater than 0.05). However, one of these children who had a fall in PVR from 8.5 to 4.5 units following intravenous diazoxide also had a lower resistance (3.9 units) after 20-months of oral diazoxide therapy and improved symptomatically. No complications other than hypertrichosis were encountered on long-term therapy. Based on this experience, it is suggested that oral diazoxide therapy may be used to improve PVOD if there is favorable response to intravenous diazoxide.\r"

The regulation of cardiac adenylate cyclase activity by autoantibodies was examined in 50 patients with dilated cardiomyopathy. Inhibition of isoproterenol-sensitive adenylate cyclase activity could be demonstrated by serum dilutions or IgG in 52% (26 of 50) of the patients; basal and NaF-stimulated activities, in contrast, were unaffected. In 14 patients, both ligand binding to beta-receptor and isoproterenol-sensitive adenylate cyclase activity were inhibited by 100-fold serum dilutions. Pretreatment of cardiac membranes with pertussis toxin did not affect inhibition of adenylate cyclase indicating that the effect of sera does not depend on Gi. The immunogenetic control of antireceptor antibodies was examined by comparing the distribution of HLA antigens in antibody-positive and antibody-negative patients. HLA-DR4 and HLA-DR1 were strongly associated with antibodies inhibiting ligand binding and adenylate cyclase activity (71% of patients with such antibodies typed as either DR4 or DR1). Conversely 58% of patients with HLA-DR4 and 71% of patients with HLA-DR1 antibodies showed inhibition of adenylate cyclase activity compared to 46% of those who lacked both HLA-DR4 and HLA-DR1 antibodies. These results strongly suggest that cardiac beta-adrenergic receptors and adenylate cyclase activity in dilated cardiomyopathy can be modulated by circulating autoantibodies, the presence of which is under the control of the major histocompatibility complex.\r"

Nonhypertensive patients were classified into three groups according to the septal thickness determined by ultrasonography; group 1 (wall thickness less than 16 mm, n = 5), group 2 (from 16 to 20 mm, n = 12) and group 3 (greater than 20 mm, n = 4). The regional myocardial uptakes of both 201Tl and 123I-MIBG (percent of injected dose/cm3 myocardium) were higher in the more hypertrophic septa. However, when regional MIBG uptake at 3 hours was divided by the 201Tl uptake to calculate the MIBG uptake per unit of blood flow, the hypertrophic septa showed lower mean values--0.39 +/- 0.23 and 0.50 +/- 0.10 in groups 3 and 2, respectively (p less than 0.1 compared with 0.69 +/- 0.20 in group 1). The regional MIBG clearance rate in the septum was significantly higher in group 3 compared with group 1 (13.4 +/- 8.0%/hr versus 1.5 +/- 6.2%/hr, p less than 0.05). The uptake and 123I-MIBG clearance rate in the lateral wall showed a similar tendency. Myocardial uptake determined by whole-body scintigraphy was slightly increased in group 2 (3.5 +/- 0.6%, p less than 0.05) compared with group 1 (2.7 +/- 0.8%); however, it was lower in group 3 (2.7 +/- 0.4%). Myocardial 123I-MIBG distribution demonstrated various patterns in comparison with 201Tl distribution, suggesting that flow-independent changes in sympathetic innervation or activity may exist in patients with HCM.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Although IPPA clearance was similar in both patients with LVH and normal subjects, postexercise washout in segments showing decreased initial IPPA uptake was reduced compared to washout at rest in patients with LVH (11.7 +/- 7.5% versus 21.5 +/- 8.4% at 20 minutes after injection, n = 15; p = 0.005). Exercise thallium-201 (TI-201) scintigraphy was normal in all seven patients with LVH tested. Patients with LVH showed significantly greater heterogeneity in IPPA uptake compared to TI-201 uptake immediately after exercise (25 +/- 5% versus 16 +/- 6%; p = 0.013). We conclude that (1) compared to normal subjects, patients with LVH show heterogeneous myocardial IPPA activity after exercise but not at rest; (2) postexercise washout of IPPA was decreased in segments with reduced uptake after exercise in patients with LVH; and (3) the distribution of IPPA is more heterogeneous than that of TI-201 immediately after exercise in patients with concentric LVH. The postexercise heterogeneity in IPPA uptake and delayed washout in segments with reduced initial uptake is consistent with exercise-induced myocardial ischemia in patients with LVH.\r"

  ".W": "Selective inhibition of sinus node function offers the possibility to decrease heart rate and reduce myocardial oxygen consumption in patients with impaired cardiac function, if myocardial contractility is not further attenuated. To study the influence of a specific sinus node inhibitor on myocardial function, alinidine was given to 10 patients with chronic congestive heart failure and stable sinus rhythm. Radionuclide ventriculography was used to monitor left ventricular function at rest and during a standardized exercise protocol. After a bolus injection of 45 mg of alinidine followed by infusion of 10 mg/hr, radionuclide studies were repeated 1.5 and 3 hours later. The results show that left ventricular ejection fraction, stroke volume, and end-diastolic volume index were essentially unchanged, whereas cardiac index decreased by 10% at rest and during exercise. Heart rate decreased markedly by 14% at rest and by 13% during exercise. Systolic blood pressure was reduced by 6% at rest and by 14% during exercise. As a result of the marked decrease of these two parameters, a pronounced effect was seen on rate-pressure product with a 19% decrease at rest and a 24% decrease during exercise. No significant side effects were observed. Alinidine might be given to patients with chronic congestive heart failure and sinus rhythm in doses up to 45 mg without exerting a clinically relevant negative inotropic effect. Therefore it may represent an alternative to other drugs when a decrease in heart rate is desired to reduce myocardial oxygen consumption.\r"

  ".U": "90282106\r", 
  ".W": "BTS 49465 (flosequinan), a putative selective, balanced arterial and venous vasodilator, displays positive inotropic effects in doses lower than those producing vasodilation. Thus rather than unloading the myocardium, flosequinan may increase myocardial work and oxygen consumption (MVO2), and may adversely affect the patient with myocardial ischemia or compromised coronary blood flow. This study compared the effects of flosequinan with milrinone, a mixed positive inotropic agent and vasodilator, and with nitroprusside (SNP), a standard direct-acting vasodilator, on myocardial dP/dT, MVO2, and myocardial energetics in the normal pentobartital-anesthetized dog. The effect of flosequinan on myocardial work was also evaluated in the dog with propranolol-induced heart failure (PIHF). Fifteen minutes after intraduodenal (id) administration of flosequinan (0.3, 1.0, and 3.0 mg/kg) to seven dogs, mean myocardial dP/dT was increased by 11%, 27%, and 54%, respectively, whereas stroke MVO2 was increased by 10%, 24%, and 47%, respectively. Doses of flosequinan greater than 0.3 mg/kg decreased left ventricular (LV) work but LV efficiency decreased in a dose-related manner. Milrinone (0.1, 0.3, and 1.0 mg/kg, id) increased LV dp/dt by 34%, 68%, and 104% above basal values, while increasing stroke MVO2 by 24%, 106%, and 249%, respectively (n = 7). LV work and LV efficiency decreased after each dose of milrinone. SNP (0.001, 0.003, and 0.01 mg/kg/min, intravenously) did not increase dP/dT but decreased LV work by 28%, 42%, and 46% (n = 5). In animals with PIHF, flosequinan (1 and 3 mg/kg, id) increased LV dP/dT 58% and 87% and increased LV work by 58% and 76% above control values. It was concluded that (1) flosequinan is a positive inotropic agent as well as a vasodilator; (2) in the normal animal the energy cost of positive inotropic activity is less with flosequinan than with milrinone, despite the lesser vasodilating action of the former; and (3) in the animal with a depressed myocardium, flosequinan may adversely affect myocardial work and wall tension.\r"

Imaging techniques that are tomographic and therefore inherently three-dimensional should be more reliable and reproducible between studies in such ventricles. Determination of reproducibility between studies is essential to define the limits of an imaging technique for evaluating the response to therapy. Sequential cine magnetic resonance (MR) studies were performed on patients with dilated cardiomyopathy (n = 11) and left ventricular hypertrophy (n = 8) within a short interval in order to assess interstudy reproducibility. Left ventricular mass, volumes, ejection fraction, and end-systolic wall stress were determined by two independent observers. Between studies, left ventricular mass was highly reproducible for hypertrophied and dilated ventricles, with percent variability less than 6%. Ejection fraction and end-diastolic volume showed close reproducibility between studies, with percent variability less than 5% End-systolic volume varied by 4.3% and 4.5% in dilated cardiomyopathy and 8.4% and 7.2% in left ventricular hypertrophy for the two observers. End-systolic wall stress, which is derived from multiple measurements, varied the greatest, with percent variability of 17.2% and 15.7% in dilated cardiomyopathy and 14.8% and 13% in left ventricular hypertrophy, respectively. The results of this study demonstrate that mass, volume, and functional measurements are reproducible in morphologically abnormal ventricles.\r"

Although complications of this procedure have been characterized, air emboli to the coronary vasculature have rarely been reported and their appropriate management is uncertain. We report six cases of symptomatic coronary air emboli occurring during PTCA. The possible mechanisms of the introduction of air during PTCA include incomplete aspiration of guiding catheters, balloon rupture, insinuation of air with balloon catheter introduction or withdrawal; structural failures of the equipment, and constant negative suction of selfventing catheters left outside the body. Symptomatic responses range from mild angina to full cardiac arrest and tend to resolve spontaneously in 5 to 10 minutes. Treatment is aimed at supporting the patient for this brief period, and consists of 100% inspired oxygen, analgesics, arrhythmic therapy if needed, and pressor and balloon pump support as required. Greater awareness of the causes, prevention, and therapy of coronary air emboli will lead to the safer practice of PTCA.\r"

We reviewed results of 119 transesophageal studies (1) to study the detailed anatomy of the IAS, and (2) to determine the thickness of the IAS at different times during the cardiac cycle, (3) the effect of age, and (4) the thickness of the IAS in relation to various disease states. From the transesophageal view the IAS extends from the right posteriorly toward the left and anteriorly. The more inferior aspect of the septum courses in a more direct posteroanterior direction and is more difficult to accurately visualize. The IAS is thickest peripherally and gradually narrows toward the more centrally located fossa ovalis. A region of constant thickness is frequently present between the most peripheral aspect of the IAS and the fossa ovalis. We standardized the measurement of the thickness of the septum by measuring it only at this region of constant thickness in the plane that visualized the fossa ovalis. The mean thickness at this point was 6 +/- 2 mm. The thickness correlated weakly with the age of the patient. These results agree with previously published autopsy findings. Thickness was not affected by the presence of significant disease of the atrioventricular valves, atrial fibrillation, or an atrial septal defect. However, the thickness increased to 7 +/- 2 mm with atrial contraction during sinus rhythm (p less than 0.0001). The mean thickness of the septum primum covering the fossa ovalis was 1.8 +/- 0.7 mm.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In these 126 patients (94 men, 32 women) the mean prehospital time was 5.9 +/- 11.0 hours (median 2.0, range 0.4 to 69.0). The time between symptom onset and reaching a decision that medical care should be sought was 62% of the mean prehospital time. In 100 (79%) patients, the prehospital time was less than or equal to 6 hours; of these, 61 (61%) were retrospectively judged to have been optimal candidates for lytic therapy. Stepwise multiple regression selected the following 4 variables as independent predictors of prehospital time: slow symptom progression; low income; female gender; and advanced age. All of these variables are predictive (p less than 0.03) of increased prehospital time; absence of prior AMI was of borderline additional significance (p = 0.053). Similarly, logistic regression analysis selected slow symptom progression, female gender and low income as significant (p less than or equal to 0.02) independent predictors of prehospital time greater than 6 hours. The logistic regression model incorporating these 3 variables had a sensitivity of 54%, a specificity of 95% and a positive predictive value of 72% in identifying patients with prehospital time greater than 6 hours. Thus, these data indicate it is possible to characterize patients likely to experience undue prehospital delay during AMI, which may be of importance to future public education efforts.\r"

From the admission electrocardiogram, the sum of ST-segment elevation (sigma ST), the sum of R-wave amplitude (sigma R) in leads V1 through V6 and the ratio of these (sigma R/sigma ST) were measured. There was no significant difference in sigma R among the 3 groups. The no-flow group had significantly lower sigma R/sigma ST and higher sigma ST than the intact collateral group or subtotal obstruction group. All patients (6 of 6) with subtotal obstruction and all except 1 patient (5 of 6) with intact collateral showed sigma R/sigma ST greater than 2.5 or sigma ST less than 2.0 mV. All patients (8 of 8) with no flow showed sigma R/sigma ST less than or equal to 2.5 and all except 1 patient with no flow (7 of 8) showed sigma ST greater than or equal to 2.0 mV. The regional wall motion was assessed by the radial method at 4 weeks. The mean percentage systolic shortening in the anterior and apical regions was significantly correlated with sigma R/sigma ST (r = 0.75, p less than 0.001) and sigma ST (r = -0.65, p less than 0.005).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Clinical and angiographic success in 135 patients receiving heparin therapy for greater than or equal to 24 hours was 91% while such success was noted in 81% of patients not treated with heparin (p = 0.02). The incidence of immediate postprocedural thrombotic vessel occlusion was higher in the nonheparin group than in the heparin-treated group (8.3 vs 1.5%, respectively, p less than 0.01). In addition, the overall rate of thromboembolic target and branch or distal vessel occlusion was 12.4% in the nonheparin group and 1.5% in the heparin-treated group (p less than 0.001). Thus, prolonged preprocedural intravenous heparin administration in this well-defined group of patients with unstable angina resulted in an improved procedural success rate and a significant decrease in the risk of abrupt vessel closure. These observations are concordant with current understanding of the pathophysiology of unstable angina.\r"

During an initial evaluation of transluminal coronary atherectomy, 14 patients had atherectomy of saphenous vein graft lesions (15 grafts). Atherectomy was successful in 13 of 14 patients, decreasing the mean diameter of stenosis from 85 to 15%. In 1 patient, the lesion could not be crossed by the atherectomy device. The following 3 minor complications occurred: 1 embolus of atheromatous material; 1 air embolism; and 1 transient thrombosis leading to subendocardial myocardial infarction. Of the 14 patients, 8 underwent angiography 4 to 6 months after atherectomy; 5 patients had restenosis and 3 had widely patent grafts. Four other patients were clinically evaluated at 3 months after atherectomy. Two were asymptomatic, 1 had class II angina and 1 had class III angina. Transluminal atherectomy achieved excellent immediate results with a low incidence of major complications in the treatment of stenosed saphenous vein bypass grafts. However, preliminary follow-up results suggest a high incidence of restenosis.\r"

The anterograde effective refractory period of the accessory pathway could be compared in 5 patients before and after isoproterenol; it decreased from 460 +/- 131 to 310 +/- 48 ms after isoproterenol (p less than 0.01). None of the 60 patients with concealed preexcitation showed ventricular preexcitation with isoproterenol infusion. Eighty-one of the 84 patients had clinically documented supraventricular tachycardia, suggesting the accessory pathway was capable of retrograde conduction. Retrograde study was performed in all 84 patients; 83 had retrograde conduction and the other had no retrograde conduction before and after isoproterenol. The ventricular paced cycle length that induced block in the accessory pathway could be compared in 38 patients before and after isoproterenol; it decreased from 342 +/- 71 to 296 +/- 39 ms after isoproterenol (p less than 0.001). The retrograde effective refractory period of the accessory pathway could be compared in 56 patients; it decreased from 293 +/- 76 to 238 +/- 36 ms after isoproterenol (p less than 0.001). In conclusion, isoproterenol facilitates anterograde and retrograde accessory pathway conduction, but the facilitation of anterograde conduction occurs only in those capable of spontaneous conduction.\r"

Areas calculated by the continuity equation correlate well with in vitro areas (r = 0.82, standard error of the y estimate = 0.1 cm2, p less than 0.001), and are within the range of predicted in vitro values in 92% of cases. Areas derived by the pressure half-time method do not correlate with in vitro areas (r = 0.15, p greater than 0.3) or continuity equation areas (r = 0.23, p greater than 0.2), and are above the range of predicted values in 69% of cases.

In 6 families proband and relatives were affected by DC (total 14 cases); in 1 of these families the disease began with an atrioventricular block. In 4 families the relatives showed the presence of myocarditis at the endomyocardial biopsy. In 2 families the relatives presented a right ventricular cardiomyopathy. The mode of inheritance was autosomal dominant in 7 families, recessive in 4; X-linked pattern may be hypothesized in 1. Nine patients died under the age of 45 years: 2 of sudden death, 6 of chronic heart failure and 1 of cerebral embolism. Familial transmission is not rare. Different modes of genetic transmission (autosomal dominant, recessive and X-linked) and different forms of myocardial disease suggest that familial DC may be a multifactorial disease.\r"

To better determine the influence of aging on PA hemodynamics in the absence of disease, we identified 47 normal subjects angiographically free of coronary artery disease (18 men, 29 women) with normal left ventricular systolic function (ejection fraction greater than or equal to 50% and left ventricular end-diastolic pressure less than 14 mm Hg) from 5,508 consecutive patients undergoing cardiac catheterization and coronary angiography between September 10, 1982 and March 9, 1987. All subjects met a set of clinical and laboratory criteria identifying them as normal. In group I (age greater than or equal to 60 years) mean PA pressure was 16 +/- 3 mm Hg, pulmonary vascular resistance was 124 +/- 32 dynes s cm-5 and the pulmonary/systemic vascular resistance ratio was 0.099 +/- 0.046. In contrast, in group II (age less than 60 years), these values were lower at 12 +/- 2 mm Hg, 70 +/- 25 dynes s cm-5 and 0.057 +/- 0.019, respectively (all p values less than 0.01 to 0.001). All these parameters increased linearly with age (r = 0.69, p less than 0.001 for pulmonary vascular resistance). The differences were not attributable to body surface area or gender. There was no difference in cardiac output, PA wedge pressure, aortic pressure or systemic vascular resistance between the 2 groups. Thus, PA pressure and vascular resistance increase with aging, a change not attributable to coronary disease or left ventricular systolic dysfunction.\r"

The most efficient method to determine preoperative cardiac risk has not been established. To determine the effectiveness of intravenous dipyridamole thallium imaging in predicting cardiac events, 40 diabetic renal transplant candidates were studied preoperatively in a prospective trial. The study group consisted of 40 patients whose average age was 42 years (range 27 to 64); 34 (85%) were hypertensive and 21 (53%) were cigarette smokers. Cardiac history included chest pain in 6 patients and prior myocardial infarction in 3 patients. Dipyridamole thallium imaging showed reversible defects in 9 patients, fixed defects in 8 patients and normal scans in 23 patients. Dipyridamole thallium imaging was performed using 0.56 mg/kg of dipyridamole infused intravenously over 4 minutes. Cardiac events occurred only in patients with reversible thallium defects, of which there were 6. Of these 6 patients, 3 had cardiac events before transplantation and 3 had them in the early postoperative phase (within 6 weeks of surgery). Of 21 patients who underwent renal transplantation, 3 had cardiac events within 6 weeks of transplantation. The average duration of follow-up was 11 months (range 1 to 21). Thus, dipyridamole thallium imaging is an effective method of identifying renal transplant candidates likely to develop cardiac complications. Routine coronary angiography may not be necessary to screen all renal transplant candidates for coronary artery disease before surgery.\r"

Left ventricular ejection fraction was higher after the race (65 +/- 5 vs 60 +/- 7%, p less than 0.01) due to a decrease in end-systolic counts. Right ventricular ejection fraction was lower after the race (42 +/- 7 vs 54 +/- 12%, p = 0.03) due to an increase in both end-diastolic and end-systolic counts. A longer systolic period was observed after the race (53 +/- 5% of the RR interval vs 39 +/- 3%, p = 0.005). No significant differences were observed in peak filling or peak emptying rates after the race. An increase in pulmonary blood volume (116% of control) was observed after the race. Antimyosin scans were normal in 7 athletes and minimal antimyosin myocardial uptake was seen in 3. Transient alterations in biventricular performance present after the race correspond to function adaptation to strenuous exercise and are not due to irreversible myocyte damage.\r"

Changes in the resting electrocardiogram were evident at 483 torr (3,660 m) and were more marked at 282 torr (7,620 m) and 240 torr (8,848 m). They consisted of an increase in resting heart rate from 63 +/- 5 to a maximum of 89 +/- 8 beats/min; increase in P-wave amplitude in inferior leads; right-axis shift in the frontal plane; increased S/R ratio in the left precordial leads; and increased T negativity in V1 and V2. No significant arrhythmias or conduction defects were observed. Most changes reverted to normal within 12 hours of return to sea level, with the exception of the frontal-plane axis and T-wave alterations. Maximal cycle ergometer exercise at 282 torr (7,620 m) and 240 torr (8,848 m) resulted in a heart rate of 138 +/- 7 and 119 +/- 6 beats/min at the 2 altitudes, respectively. No ST depression or T-wave changes suggestive of ischemia occurred despite a mean arterial oxygen saturation of 49% and a mean pH of 8 during peak exercise.

Accordingly, cardiovascular complications, especially thrombotic events, were prospectively evaluated in 8,517 consecutive patients undergoing diagnostic cardiac catheterization with either iopamidol (n = 6,293) or iohexol (n = 2,224). Thrombotic events were defined as coronary embolus, coronary occlusion, transient ischemic attack or stroke occurring at the time of catheterization. Thrombotic events occurred in 15 patients (0.18%). Coronary thrombus or embolus occurred in 7 patients, a thromboembolus from the ventricular catheter occurred in 1 patients and transient ischemic attack or stroke occurred in 7 patients. Six of 15 patients with thrombotic events were premedicated with heparin. Thrombotic events were unusual in that they tended to occur in clusters within short time intervals. On 1 occasion, a thrombus was observed in the catheter tip before embolization. Other cardiovascular complications were similarly low with an incidence of ventricular tachycardia/fibrillation of 0.1%, profound bradycardia of 0.2% and prolonged angina of 0.3%. There were 2 deaths unrelated to thrombotic events. Although the clinical thrombotic events associated with nonionic contrast have an unusual temporal clustering and may result in major complications, the overall incidence (0.18%) of these thrombotic complications with nonionic contrast agents is quite similar to that reported with ionic contrast media.\r"

  ".W": "Two new echocardiographic methods for estimating left ventricular ejection fraction, both based on segmental wall motion scoring on a continuous scale, were developed and compared to radionuclide angiography in 50 patients. The first method used a geometric model in which the ventricle was represented by a tubular base section joined to a hemielliptical apex section, each containing 4 quadrants. Contraction was scored visually in 12 regions of the ventricle. The 12 scores were converted to dimensional shortenings, which were then used to calculate separate ejection fractions for each of the 8 quadrants. These 8 values were averaged to obtain the global ejection fraction. Assuming an elliptical end-systolic cross-section shape for each quadrant, the correlation between the echocardiographic and radionuclide ejection fractions was 0.917 with a regression slope of 0.93 and an intercept of 1.5. Results were identical assuming circular end-systolic quadrant shapes. The second approach used a linear combination of the mean wall motion score at the base, midleft ventricle and apex to predict ejection fraction. Coefficients for the 3 mean scores were optimized by least squares best fit with radionuclide ejection fraction in all 50 patients. The simplest linear model showed a correlation of 0.90 between the echocardiographic and radionuclide ejection fraction but underestimated low, and overestimated high, ejection fractions. However, these systematic errors could be removed by regression, which added a constant term of 8.1 and a slope factor of 0.87 to the linear model, improving the correlation with radionuclide ejection fraction to 0.91.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In 13 men and 12 women, aged 19 to 30 years, recordings of the left ventricular short-axis view, the 2- or 4-chamber view with the left and right atria, the long axes of the left and right ventricles, the mitral and tricuspid valve ring and the atrial septum were analyzed. Furthermore, the aortic valve plane and the ascending and descending aorta were also measured. All data are given as mean values +/- 2 times the standard deviation. End-diastolic and end-systolic left ventricular anterior-to-posterior diameter of the left ventricular short axis was 2.5 +/- 0.3 cm/m2 and 1.7 +/- 0.3 cm/m2, with the fractional shortening ranging from 27 to 42%.

  ".U": "90282168\r", 
  ".W": "The vascular effects of a diuretic combination (spironolactone/altizide) were studied in 5 anuric patients undergoing dialysis by measuring changes in cardiovascular reactivity to norepinephrine (NE) and angiotensin II (AII) after infusion of incremental doses of these 2 vasopressor agents. There was a marked dose-response relation between NE and AII administration and mean (NE) or diastolic (AII) blood pressure (BP). Diuretic treatment moderated the increase in mean or diastolic BP induced by NE or AII. In addition, the pressor doses of NE and AII, which are also parameters of vascular reactivity, were significantly increased after diuretic treatment (NE, +101%; AII, +163%). Right atrial and pulmonary capillary wedge pressures increased along with BP in response to NE. Diuretic treatment also moderated the increase in right atrial and pulmonary capillary wedge pressures induced by NE. These results suggest that the antihypertensive action of spironolactone and altizide in combination is mainly due to a direct effect on resistance and capacitance vessels. The mechanisms by which diuretics modify the cardioreactivity remain poorly understood; however, they may modify electrolyte transport (sodium and calcium) across vascular smooth muscle cell membranes or stimulate prostaglandin release.\r"

Magnesium repletion has been shown not only to increase magnesium levels, but also to increase muscle potassium and to decrease the frequency of ventricular ectopic beats. Potassium replenishment alone may have a detrimental effect in magnesium-depleted patients. The potassium-sparing diuretic spironolactone (Aldactone) has been shown to spare both potassium and magnesium, and may therefore be a more appropriate diuretic therapy in patients at cardiovascular risk.\r"

In addition to neurologic examination, evaluation of Kayser-Fleischer rings and liver function tests, copper (Cu) and Zn concentrations in liver tissue, plasma, and urine were periodically evaluated by spectrophotometry. Many of the patients had had side effects due to penicillamine (PCA). Oral Zn sulphate (220 mg tid) reduced the WD symptoms and resulted in normal urinary Cu excretion in all five patients. One patient who had a transient gastric complaint during Zn administration, and in whom a decrease in liver Cu content was not observed, did not show any improvement in liver histology. He resumed PCA therapy after 29 months of Zn therapy. We conclude that long-term Zn treatment in Wilson's disease can be a safe and effective alternative to Cu chelating agents. However, patients should be periodically monitored for their Cu/Zn status to assess patient compliance with therapy.\r"

The remaining 59 biopsies had HG, constituting an incidence figure of 14.6%. The latter 59 patients qualified for further clinicopathological analysis, which constituted the material for this study. The HG was due to schistosomiasis in 32, tuberculosis in 19, brucellosis in four, drugs in two, and to typhoid and ruptured fat cysts (lipogranuloma) in one patient each. The study was done to delineate the histological and other features that might be of value in identifying the etiology of HG.\r"

Fifteen healthy male subjects were studied twice on separate study days. Esophageal manometry was performed either at 10 AM or 10 PM after a standardized meal given 10 h prior to each study. Lower esophageal sphincter pressures, distal esophageal contractile amplitudes, distal esophageal contractile durations, and the velocity of propagation of peristaltic waves in the proximal and distal esophagus were measured. No significant differences were detected in esophageal function between day and night studies. These findings suggest either 1) nocturnal slowing of gastrointestinal motility is not a generalized characteristic of the entire GI tract, or 2) a two time-point study is not adequate to detect a true circadian rhythm in esophageal motor function.\r"

In this study, the results of upper esophageal sphincter (UES) manometry with a microtransducer assembly in 67 healthy volunteers aged 17-77 yr have been analyzed for possible effects of age, sex, and cigarette smoking. Older subjects were found to have only marginally lower UES tonic pressures, but markedly elevated pharyngeal contraction pressures. Increasing age was associated with a reduction in duration of upper esophageal contractions and, for bread swallows, an increase in pharyngoesophageal wave velocity which may represent compensatory mechanisms for airway protection. Male subjects showed greater UES axial asymmetry than females, perhaps due to sex differences in laryngeal anatomy, whereas females had greater UES wet swallow after-contraction pressures which may be relevant to the generation of globus sensation. All results were independent of cigarette smoking. We conclude that normal values obtained in small numbers of young adults form an inadequate basis for the interpretation of UES tonic and pharyngeal contraction pressures, which are reported to be abnormal in older patients with dysphagia, and that manometric investigation of dysphagic patients requires the analysis of multiple parameters of dynamic pharyngoesophageal function.\r"

Mid-respiratory LES pressures were significantly higher (p less than 0.05) in patients with normal amounts of reflux than in those with abnormal reflux. This difference did not occur with LES pressure measured by end-expiratory station pull-through (SPT) or rapid pull-through (RPT). There was no significant difference in total length or intra-abdominal portion of LES between the two groups. However, the product of LES pressure and total LES length was greater (p less than 0.05) for patients with normal reflux than for these with abnormal reflux. No difference was noted in the percentage of abnormal contractions in the distal esophagus between groups. These studies support the following conclusions: 1) LES pressure may be a more important protective mechanism against reflux than LES length. 2) Mid-respiratory SPT technique appears to identify the LES antireflux barrier better than either end-expiratory SPT or RPT techniques. 3) Acid exposure time seems to be a better measure of gastroesophageal reflux than the number of reflux episodes.\r"

To assess this, we studied the sensitivity and specificity of endoscopic examination compared with histology, microscopic evidence of Helicobacter pylori, CP-TEST, culture, and serum IgG and IgA antibody titers to H. pylori to determine whether endoscopy and antral biopsies really are useful. One hundred seven consecutive dyspeptic patients (mean age 43 yr) were entered. Four antral biopsies were taken routinely for evaluation by histology, microscopy, CP-TEST, and culture. Serum IgG and IgA antibody levels were measured in all patients. Of symptoms, postprandial bloating was statistically more common in H. pylori-positive than in negative patients. Endoscopy had the poorest sensitivity (37.1%) and specificity (53.3%). Patients with normal endoscopic appearances but histologically confirmed gastritis had significantly higher IgG and IgA titers than the patients normal by both endoscopy and histology and without evidence of H. pylori.

The etiologies of the fistulous tracts varied, as did the type and number of stents used. The duration of time between stent placement and observed closure of the fistulous tracts ranged from 3 days to 5 months. Of note, all patients had a dramatic reduction of drainage within the first week. From our study we conclude that surgical correction of biliary fistulas is not required, that sphincterotomy is not mandatory for stent placement or fistula management in patients without distal obstruction, and that a single, small caliber stent alone may be effective.\r"

Three hundred sixty-four diagnoses were distributed in 271 UC patients. It is concluded that extracolonic diagnoses are less frequent in an unselected patient group.

These represent 172 patient years of 6-MP therapy and 308 years of observation after initiating 6-MP. In all patients, treatment with sulfasalazine and steroids had failed; most (96%) were dependent on systemic steroids and still symptomatic. The mean treatment period with 6-MP was 1.8 yr. In 42 out of 87 courses (48%) of 6-MP steroids could be eliminated, and in another 11 (13%) could be significantly reduced, for a total response rate of 61%. When four patients not on steroids were included, the response rate was 63%. The steroids were discontinued after a mean treatment time of 10 wk, and the 42 patients remained steroid free for the remainder of 6-MP treatment. Follow-up data after discontinuing 6-MP in 29 patients from this group show the mean time to relapse was 21 months with a median time of 12.5 months. We conclude that 6-MP is effective in inducing remission, eliminating steroids, and maintaining remission in many patients with refractory ulcerative colitis. Patients should be made aware of this option before colectomy is recommended.\r"

  ".W": "Ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) is the first and rate-limiting enzyme in the polyamine biosynthetic pathway. Polyamines have been studied as potential markers of neoplastic diseases, including colonic cancer. Previous studies have pointed out the possible value of this enzyme as a biochemical marker of colonic neoplasia, we studied 100 patients undergoing diagnostic total colonoscopy. There were 40 normal controls and 20 patients in each of the following groups: 1) family members of patients diagnosed as having colonic tumors, 2) patients with adenomas, and 3) patients with colonic adenocarcinoma. Six forceps biopsies were obtained from the normal-appearing sigmoid mucosa for the analysis of ODC. No difference was found among the four groups studied. We therefore conclude that ODC is unreliable for clinical use as a biochemical marker for the identification of population groups at risk for colonic neoplasia.\r"

When found at surgery, the aneurysm had ruptured and was sealed by overlying colonic mesentery, along with retroperitoneal fascia. Elderly male patients who are smokers are believed to be at higher risk for atypical presentations from ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysms. This is thought to result from a generalized defect in collagen combined with diffuse atherosclerotic vascular disease. The diagnosis requires maintenance of a high clinical suspicion, in particular for those patients with higher risk factors.\r"

Cholestyramine did not prevent a third episode of colitis which followed the use of amikacin. This patient was HLA-B27 positive; she developed sacroiliitis, tenosynovitis, oligoarthritis, culture negative urethritis, and cervicitis. With the successful treatment of each episode of diarrhea, these additional symptoms resolved. The close temporal correlation between recurrences of C. difficile-associated colitis and these other symptoms strengthens evidence from other reports which suggests that colonic infections with C. difficile may precipitate the Reiter's syndrome. Evidence from this case does not support the contention that antibodies to C. difficile toxins are implicated in producing joint inflammation.\r"

Vascular endothelium, visualized with the lectin Ulex europaeus agglutinin I, and complement membrane attack complex were demonstrated in the same cryostat sections by paired immunofluorescence. Large randomly selected fields were analyzed to determine the number of capillaries per square millimeter of fiber area (capillary density), per 1,000-microns 2 area of each muscle fiber (capillary index), and in 100 x 100-microns grid squares. In dermatomyositis specimens with minimal structural alterations there was focal capillary depletion, the capillary density was significantly reduced, and the frequency distributions of the capillary index and grid count were shifted to the left. In advanced dermatomyositis specimens, the findings were similar but more severe. In both kinds of specimens, clusters of capillaries reacted for complement membrane attack complex. The 2 patients with the highest proportion of vessels positive for membrane attack complex had a fulminant and fatal course. In polymyositis and inclusion body myositis specimens, the capillaries had a normal overall density and none reacted for membrane attack complex. The findings imply that the capillaries are an early and specific target of the disease process in dermatomyositis.\r"

  ".W": "Neuropeptide immunohistochemistry was used to test several hypotheses of the anatomical bases of chorea and rigidity-akinesia. To test the hypothesis that elevated concentration of striatal somatostatin causes chorea, we visually compared the density of striatal neurons containing somatostatin and neuropeptide Y in brains affected by choreic or rigid-akinetic Huntington's disease (HD). The density of these neurons was elevated in both rigid-akinetic and choreic HD specimens with an apparently normal total number of these neurons, indicating that elevated somatostatin concentration, by itself, does not lead to chorea. We tested the hypothesis that rigid-akinetic HD results from deficient dopaminergic nigrostriatal neurotransmission by examining tyrosine hydroxylase-immunoreactive (TH-IR) neurons in the substantia nigra. In rigid-akinetic HD brains, there was no obvious reduction of nigral TH-IR neurons, indicating that rigid-akinetic HD is probably not due to loss of nigral dopaminergic neurons. Finally, we also examined the status of striatal projection neurons and found near total loss of all striatal neurons projecting to the lateral globus pallidus, medial globus pallidus, and substantia nigra in brains affected by rigid-akinetic HD in contrast to the preservation of neurons projecting to the medial globus pallidus in choreic HD. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that chorea results from preferential loss of striatal neurons projecting to the lateral globus pallidus and that rigid-akinetic HD is a consequence of the additional loss of striatal neurons projecting to the medial segment of the pallidum.\r"

  ".W": "Immune abnormalities, including deficient CD8 lymphocyte-mediated suppression, have been implicated in the progression of multiple sclerosis (MS). The peripheral sympathetic branch of the autonomic nervous system innervates the lymphoid organs and affects immune function. Animals with an ablated sympathetic nervous system develop more severe experimental allergic encephalomyelitis than control animals and exhibit an increased density of beta-adrenergic receptors on their lymphocytes. Experimental allergic encephalomyelitis shares many features with MS. Accordingly, we investigated the psychogalvanic skin reflex in patients with rapidly progressive MS and found that 13 patients (57%) lacked this sympathetic-mediated response. The density of beta-adrenergic receptors on lymphocyte subsets was increased in progressive MS, most notably on the CD8 suppressor/cytotoxic subset. B lymphocytes had the greatest number of receptors with 12.1 +/- 1.8 fmol/10(6) cells in control subjects and 18.7 +/- 2.6 fmol/10(6) cells in patients with MS. CD8 lymphocytes possessed an intermediate number of receptors with 3.4 +/- 0.4 fmol/10(6) cells in control subjects and 9.1 +/- 1.6 fmol/10(6) cells in patients with MS. CD4 lymphocytes demonstrated the fewest receptors with 1.2 +/- 0.1 fmol/10(6) cells in control subjects and 1.8 +/- 0.4 fmol/10(6) cells in patients with MS. No differences in the affinity or function (cyclic adenosine monophosphate levels in response to 10(-5) M (-)isoproterenol) of the adrenergic receptor were found when patients with progressive MS and control subjects were compared. Autonomic abnormalities in progressive MS and the increased beta-adrenergic receptor density found on CD8 lymphocytes may be related.\r"

In the Parkinson brains, the catecholamine cell groups of the midbrain, pons, and medulla showed variable neuropathological changes. All dopaminergic nuclei were variably affected, but were most severely affected in the caudal, central substantia nigra. The pontine noradrenergic locus ceruleus showed variable degrees of degeneration. There was also a substantial loss of substance P-containing neurons in the pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus. However, the most severely affected cell group in the pons was the serotonin-synthesizing neurons in the median raphe. In the medulla, substantial neuronal loss was found in several diverse cell groups including the adrenaline-synthesizing and neuropeptide Y-containing neurons in the rostral ventrolateral medulla, the serotonin-synthesizing neurons in the raphe obscurus nucleus, the substance P-containing neurons in the lateral reticular formation, as well as the substance P-containing neurons in the dorsal motor vagal nucleus. Lewy bodies were present in immunohistochemically identified neurons in many of these regions, indicating that they were affected directly by the disease process. These widespread but region- and transmitter-specific changes help account for the diversity of motor, cognitive, and autonomic manifestations of Parkinson's disease.\r"

  ".W": "Eighty-six patients with monosymptomatic optic neuritis of unknown cause were followed prospectively for a median period of 12.9 years. At onset, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pleocytosis was present in 46 patients (53%) but oligoclonal immunoglobulin in only 40 (47%) of the patients. The human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DR2 was present in 45 (52%). Clinically definite multiple sclerosis (MS) was established in 33 patients. Actuarial analysis showed that the cumulative probability of developing MS within 15 years was 45%. Three risk factors were identified: low age and abnormal CSF at onset, and early recurrence of optic neuritis. Female gender, onset in the winter season, and the presence of HLA-DR2 antigen increased the risk for MS, but not significantly. Magnetic resonance imaging detected bilateral discrete white matter lesions, similar to those in MS, in 11 of 25 patients, 7 to 18 years after the isolated attack of optic neuritis. Nine were among the 13 with abnormal CSF and only 2 belonged to the group of 12 with normal CSF (p = 0.01). Normal CSF at the onset of optic neuritis conferred better prognosis but did not preclude the development of MS.\r"

The antibodies against phosphorylated tau proteins that intensely stained all Pick bodies recognized numerous neuronal processes around Pick body-bearing cells and focal portions in the perikarya of ballooned neurons. Monoclonal and polyclonal anti-ubiquitin antibodies stained not only some Pick bodies with variable intensity, but also the perikarya of all ballooned neurons. Ultrastructurally, Pick bodies consisted of accumulation of randomly oriented, approximately 15-nm straight filaments and paired twisted profiles with a minimal diameter of 13 nm, maximal diameter of 26 nm, and twist periodicity of 120 nm. These Pick body-type filaments were also observed in the perikarya of ballooned neurons and neuronal processes around Pick body-bearing cells. Our studies demonstrate, for the first time, the characteristic pathological feature of neuropil in Pick's disease. Pick body-bearing cells and ballooned neurons show unique immunocytochemical and ultrastructural properties that may be a clue to the pathogenesis of Pick's disease.\r"

  ".W": "Positron emission tomography (PET) of local cerebral glucose metabolism in 13 children with infantile spasms of undetermined cause (cryptogenic spasms) revealed unilateral hypometabolism involving the parieto-occipito-temporal region in 5 female infants. Cranial computed tomography showed normal findings in all infants. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) demonstrated a normal appearance in 4 of the 5 infants; in 1 infant, MRI revealed a subtle abnormality consisting of poor demarcation between occipital gray and white matter. Surface electroencephalography (EEG) in 4 showed hypsarrythmia at some time in the patients' courses, but at other times showed localized or lateralized abnormalities corresponding to areas of PET-detected hypometabolism. Because of poor seizure control, 4 infants underwent surgical removal of the cortical focus guided by intraoperative electrocorticography and were seizure free postoperatively. Neuropathological examination of resected tissue in each showed microscopic cortical dysplasia. Our findings indicate that in infants with cryptogenic spasms, PET can effectively identify those due to unsuspected focal cortical dysplasia, for which resective surgery offers improved prognosis.\r"

  ".W": "Long latency auditory evoked potentials were recorded in 55 homosexual men infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Forty-one of these patients were asymptomatic from the infection and 14 had clinical signs of illness. Nine of the symptomatic patients were demented and 8 (6 of whom were demented) met other diagnostic criteria for acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). Cerebral responses were recorded from Fz, Cz, and Pz electrode placements referred to linked mastoids and averaged separately to rare (2,000 Hz) and frequent (1,000 Hz) tones presented in a pseudorandom sequence. Electroencephalography (EEG) was performed in 54 of the patients and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography (CT) was done in 14 (13 of whom were symptomatic from the infection). The latency of N1, P2, N2, and P3 components was delayed in HIV-positive patients compared to normal and this was particularly so for the N1, N2, and P3 components. These changes were more marked in those patients who were symptomatic from their infection, especially in those who were demented. They were, however, present to a lesser degree even in asymptomatic (Class II) patients. Thus, 78% of the demented patients and 28% of nondemented patients had a delay in latency of at least one of the evoked potential components beyond the upper limit of our normal population. By contrast, the EEG was normal in all patients with asymptomatic HIV infection and most symptomatic patients, although 5 patients in this latter group had mild generalized slowing. MRI and CT findings were similarly nonspecific, particularly in the nondemented group.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The patients were treated with oral 3,4-diaminopyridine, first with increasing single doses up to 100 mg and then with divided dosage for up to 3 weeks. Paresthesias were reported by all patients and abdominal pain was dose limiting in 6 patients. 3,4-Diaminopyridine levels and half-life varied widely from patient to patient. Cerebrospinal fluid levels of 3,4-diaminopyridine were about 10% of those in serum. Neither seizures nor epileptiform changes on electroencephalographic examination occurred. Small reversible improvements in specific neurological deficits were seen on examination in all patients and reversible improvement in visual evoked response latencies were found in 2 patients. These results suggest that further study of 3,4-diaminopyridine in patients with MS is warranted.\r"

  ".W": "We report the prevalence rates for dementia and Alzheimer's disease (AD) obtained from a probability sample survey of 5,055 noninstitutionalized older persons in Shanghai, China. A two-stage procedure was used for case finding and case identification. A Chinese version of the Mini-Mental State Examination was used to determine cases of possible dementia. Three different cutoff points on this mental status test were used depending on the respondent's level of education. Clinical evaluations, based on functional assessments and psychiatric interview, medical and neurological examinations, three standardized mental status tests, and a selected group of psychometric tests, were made in the second stage of the study to ascertain the clinical diagnosis of dementia and AD utilizing the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders, edition 3 and National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke-Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Association criteria, respectively. The prevalence rate of dementia in persons 65 years and older was 4.6%. Clinically diagnosed AD accounted for 65% of the subjects with dementia. These findings indicate that the prevalence of dementia in Shanghai is very much higher than figures published earlier for China and Japan, and at the lower part of the range of values reported for community residents in the United States and other Western countries, but less than half of that reported in the recently published survey of the elderly in East Boston. Increasing age, gender (female), and low education are each highly significant and independent risk factors for dementia. One hypothesis to explain the increased prevalence in elderly women who had received no formal education invokes the possibility of an effect of early deprivation, perhaps lowering brain \"reserve,\" allowing the symptoms of dementia to appear at an earlier date during disease progression.\r"

In 3 of 4 TS-affected brains, the concentration of adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cyclic AMP) was reduced in all brain regions evaluated. This diminution in cyclic AMP was not associated with a significant change in the activity of the synthesizing enzyme, adenylate cyclase. No significant differences were identified for the neurotransmitter-synthesizing enzymes choline acetyltransferase and glutamate decarboxylase. Concentrations of dopamine, norepinephrine, and the serotonin metabolite 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid were not altered. Postsynaptic receptor-binding activity for muscarinic cholinergic ([3H]quinuclidinyl benzilate) and beta receptors ([125I]iodocyanopindolol) showed no generalized impairment. It is suggested that symptoms of Tourette's syndrome might be related to an abnormality within a second messenger system.\r"

A diagnosis of neoplasia or pleural tuberculosis was obtained in 241 subjects (149 with neoplasias and 92 with pleural tuberculosis). In an additional 55 patients, a diagnosis of tuberculosis or neoplasia was obtained using other procedures (15 with tuberculosis and 40 with neoplasias). In 105 subjects, the effusion was neither tuberculosis nor neoplasia. Thirteen patients were excluded from this study due to the impossibility of follow-up. The diagnostic process was repeated in 64 patients. Complications occurred in 46 patients (11%), of which 42 were pneumothorax. The dual diagnostic sensitivity in our series of thoracenteses and pleural biopsies made with a Cope's needle was 86% in tuberculosis and 79% in neoplasia with 100% specificity. The probability of a case being neither tuberculosis nor pleural neoplasia (negative predictive value) when the liquid and the pleural biopsy specimen are nonspecific (each procedure having been applied only once on each patient) is 56%, although a negative result does not exclude these diagnoses. In our opinion, the repetition of the dual procedure is indicated considering the scant morbidity and zero mortality.\r"

To explore this possibility, we obtained by telemetry electrocardiograms on 149 men during recreational skiing at altitudes above 3100 m (10 150 ft). Tachycardia was impressive; heart rate exceeded 80% of predicted maximum in two thirds of the subjects. Five men developed abnormal ST-segment depression during or immediately after exercise. All five were older than 40 years, so in this age group the incidence of ST abnormalities was 5.6%. This is not greater than the incidence among asymptomatic men during submaximal exercise at low altitude. The high level of physical fitness of men who ski may have offset the added stress of cold and hypoxia. Hence, for physically fit older men, mountain skiing does not appear to pose a greater coronary stress than does comparable exercise at low altitude among men of only average physical fitness without known heart disease.\r"

The association between DAN and cardiovascular risk factors was examined in a well-defined cohort of 25- to 34-year-old insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus subjects (n = 168) with and without DAN as evaluated by heart rate response to deep breathing, standing, and the Valsalva maneuver. The autonomic tests were performed using both an office-based procedure and a method employed by the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial with analyses performed by the Diabetes Research and Analysis Association, Lexington, Ky. Good agreement was found between the procedures for the assessment modalities of heart rate response to deep breathing. Modeling potential correlates in logistic analyses, where heart rate response to deep breathing was the dependent variable, revealed hypertension status, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and gender (female) to be independent determinants of DAN. These results suggest that traditional cardiovascular risk factors are important correlates of DAN and may relate to both its cause and poor prognosis. Since these results are from a cross-sectional study, prospective follow-up of this cohort will be needed for confirmation.\r"

Contrast nephropathy (a rise in creatinine level of greater than or equal to 44 mumol/L above baseline) occurred in 21 cases (11%). In 16 (76%) of these 21 cases, renal function returned toward baseline within several days. One patient developed transient oliguria, but no deaths were attributable to renal failure. Independent risk factors for renal dysfunction included contrast volume greater than 200 mL, serum albumin level less than 35 g/L, diabetes mellitus, serum sodium level less than 135 mmol/L, and baseline creatinine level greater than 133 mumol/L. Renal insufficiency occurred in 1.2% of patients with no risk factors, 11.2% of those with one risk factor, and more than 20% of those with two or more risk factors. Thus, the incidence and clinical course of radiocontrast nephropathy in the elderly are similar to those in younger patients. High-risk elderly patients who may benefit from more aggressive prophylaxis can be prospectively identified, but the threat of contrast nephrotoxic effects should not be considered a major contraindication to angiography in appropriately selected patients.\r"

Regression analysis showed that severity of illness was a stronger predictor of the T3 level than was age. Our results confirm previous observations that clinical thyroid disease in the hospitalized elderly is not uncommon and often goes unrecognized. Our results also demonstrate for the first time that low concentrations of T3 correlate with a quantitative measure of the severity of illness but only marginally with aging.\r"

  ".W": "Seventy patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) have been included in this study to evaluate the impact of oral examination on the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), Atlanta, Ga, classification of HIV disease. Based on clinical data prior to oral examination, 22 patients were classified in the CDC group 2, 11 in CDC group 3, and 37 in CDC group 4. Twelve patients (55%) initially classified as CDC 2, and 4 patients (36%) initially classified as CDC 3 had to be reallocated to CDC group 4 due to the presence of oral candidiasis, hairy leukoplakia, or oral Kaposi's sarcoma. We conclude that oral examination has a large impact on the CDC classification of HIV-infected subjects. Since this classification system is used to select asymptomatic HIV-infected subjects (CDC groups 2 and 3) for clinical trials receiving antiretroviral therapy in early HIV disease, it is suggested that accurate oral examination is mandatory before inclusion of patients in such studies.\r"

Eighteen percent of patients with sleep apnea had frequent morning headaches compared with 21% to 38% in the other groups of patients and 6% of control subjects. In patients with sleep apnea, morning headaches were most common in those with mild predominantly nonobstructive apnea. Polysomnographic characteristics of patients with moderate to severe sleep apnea did not significantly differ between patients with frequent headaches and those without such headaches. Frequent morning headaches are a nonspecific symptom in patients with sleep disorders and are not a consistent or reliable symptom of sleep apnea syndrome.\r"

A total of 113 patients consecutively hospitalized because of an acute febrile disease, without a recognizable source of fever, were divided into four groups, with increasing probability of bacterial infection and bacteremia. None of the patients in the first group had bacterial infection or bacteremia. The incidence of bacterial infection and bacteremia was 27% and 11% in the second group, 32% and 17% in the third group, and 53% and 35% in the fourth group. No patient in the first group died, as opposed to 29% of patients in the fourth group. The use of the index at admission would have probably changed the treatment of 11% of patients. Thus, the index could be used to identify patients to be discharged from the emergency department (first group) or hospitalized and treated empirically (fourth group).\r"

The C5a inhibitor activity was studied with the use of a C5a binding assay where peritoneal fluids were tested for their ability to inhibit recombinant C5a binding to dibutyryl cyclic adenosine monophosphate-induced U937 cells. In contrast to normal peritoneal fluids, those from patients with familial Mediterranean fever contained less than 1% C5a inhibitor activity. Gel filtration and ion exchange chromatography of peritoneal fluids from those patients did not yield any fraction that inhibited C5a binding. We suggest that the serosal tissue of patients with familial Mediterranean fever is devoid of C5a inhibitor activity and that this deficiency may explain in part the local inflammatory episodes characteristic of this disease.\r"

  ".W": "A serologic survey of 4863 patients attending two inner-city sexually transmitted disease clinics was conducted in 1988 1 year after an initial survey to reassess the prevalence and associated risk factors for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. The HIV seroprevalence rates had not changed significantly (5.2% in 1987, 4.9% in 1988), and remained higher among men (5.6%) than among women (3.6%). The HIV seroprevalence increased steadily with age, to 34 years in women and to 39 years in men. Of patients with a reactive syphilis serologic test result, 24.3% were HIV infected compared with 3.5% of patients with a nonreactive test for syphilis. In multivariate analysis, a reactive serologic test for syphilis was significantly associated with HIV infection in all major risk behavior categories. Among heterosexuals who denied parenteral drug abuse, HIV infection rates were 6.8 and 8.7 times greater for women and men, respectively, who had a reactive serologic test for syphilis. Evidence of heterosexual transmission of HIV was further suggested by a change in HIV seroprevalence in women from 3.0% in 1987 to 3.6% in 1988, a male to female HIV infection ratio of 1.6, and 3.0% prevalence of infection among patients who denied established risk factors. This was most evident among those younger than 25 years, in whom 72% of infected women and 46.2% of infected men denied high-risk behaviors. These data demonstrate the strong association between syphilis and HIV infection and the importance of heterosexual HIV transmission in patients attending sexually transmitted disease clinics. This study underscores the need for a more comprehensive control program for sexually transmitted diseases, including syphilis and HIV infection.\r"

Forty-five (80%) of the 56 cases of staphylococcal endocarditis involved Staphylococcus aureus with a mortality of 28% vs 9% in the non-S aureus group. Mortality was higher in patients with congestive heart failure (35%), atrioventricular block (45%), atrial fibrillation (42%), and prosthetic valve endocarditis (50%). Seventy-six percent of the patients with congestive heart failure required surgery. Patients with congestive heart failure and S aureus infection had a mortality of 45%. Thirty-six patients (64%) were alive at late follow-up (mean, 28.6 months). Mortality was highest (23%) during the first 3 months following diagnosis of staphylococcal endocarditis. Staphylococcal endocarditis represents an increasingly large proportion of patients with infectious endocarditis. Mortality rates remain high despite aggressive management of the patient's condition.\r"

In this study, 13 patients with mixed hyperlipidemia were treated with the cholesterol-lowering drug lovastatin to determine its effectiveness. In 9 of these patients, lovastatin therapy used alone was compared with the drug combination of lovastatin and gemfibrozil. In the 13 patients, lovastatin therapy produced a 31% reduction in total cholesterol level and a 32% decrease in triglyceride levels compared with placebo. It lowered very-low-density plus intermediate-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels by 40%, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels by 36%, and total apolipoprotein B levels by 28%. Concentrations of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and apolipoprotein A-I were unchanged, but total cholesterol (and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol)/high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ratios were markedly reduced. Compared with lovastatin alone, lovastatin plus gemfibrozil produced greater decreases in very-low-density plus intermediate-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels and an increase in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, but, in view of the higher risk for severe myopathy with this combination, lovastatin used alone may be adequate therapy for many patients with mixed hyperlipidemia.\r"

Before our care of these patients, there were a total of 76 hospital admissions, including 21 intensive care unit admissions and 291 emergency department visits. Prophylactic treatment with maintenance antihistamines and prednisone was appropriate for frequent episodes, and short-term treatment was given for infrequent episodes. No fatalities were reported from idiopathic anaphylaxis in the 124 patients who were available for follow-up. With the appropriate treatment, remissions can be induced in a substantial number of patients. Significant reductions in the frequency of emergency department visits and hospitalizations have been shown, which, in turn, are accompanied by decreases in overall medical costs. In this disease, the period before treatment serves as a control period for comparison after therapy.\r"

This suggests that postmenopausal women with mild, asymptomatic hypercalcemia of primary hyperparathyroidism are likely to be relatively more predisposed to peripheral than vertebral fractures, which is clear evidence of the need for treatment to prevent bone loss in these patients.\r"

Increase in urethral resistance (p less than 0.005) was more marked following the Pereyra procedure (0.042 +/- 0.039 to 0.07 +/- 0.061) and 30 percent experienced postoperative voiding difficulties, compared with the Burch procedure (0.035 +/- 0.029 to 0.055 +/- 0.03) where 20 percent experienced postoperative voiding difficulties. Of those patients who voided without a detrusor contraction prior to surgery (35/70), in 50 percent a detrusor contraction component developed to their voiding mechanism postoperatively (p less than 0.05) and overcame the increased urethral resistance with no postoperative voiding difficulties. In the remaining 50 percent a detrusor contraction failed to develop during postoperative voiding and 90 percent of them demonstrated reduced flow rates and increased use of Valsalva maneuver, and needed prolonged postoperative bladder drainage prior to resumption of spontaneous voiding (p less than 0.005). Inability to develop a detrusor contraction during voiding in face of increased urethral resistance promoted by the incontinence surgery provided a suitable explanation for post surgery voiding difficulties in 20 to 30 percent of patients.\r"

Two hundred and three obstetric units in the United Kingdom (responsible for 2,580,000 deliveries from 1982 to 1986 inclusive) responded. A total of 505,000 extradural blocks were performed, 84% for relief of pain in labour and 16% for Caesarean section. Of 108 events reported, five were associated with permanent disability. Neuropathy involving a single spinal nerve, acute toxicity from the local anaesthetic, and problems associated with accidental dural puncture were the commonest complications. This investigation indicates the need for a prospective study. Although rare, serious complications could be reduced further by meticulous technique, while early diagnosis and treatment of untoward events would reduce the incidence of permanent disability.\r"

More extensive cephalad spread of sensory block was achieved in patients with increased BMI compared with patients with normal BMI after injection at both L3-4 and L4-5 (P less than 0.05). The use of the L3-4 interspace instead of L4-5 resulted in a higher mean spread of block in patients with both increased (T4 vs T8) or normal (T9 vs T11) BMI (P less than 0.05). The interindividual variability of the blocks was relatively small in patients with normal BMI injected at L4-5, compared with the three other groups (normal BMI injected at L3-4, increased BMI injected at L3-4 and L4-5). Good anaesthesia was produced in all patients for orthopaedic surgery of the lower extremity. In an obese patient it is recommended that plain bupivacaine be administered at L4-5 instead of L3-4 when extensive spread of the block is to be avoided.\r"

Pain was assessed using a visual analogue scale and taste assessed using evaluation forms. Postoperative analgesic requirements were compared using a patient-controlled analgesia system which was set to deliver bolus doses of pethidine without a background infusion.

There were no significant differences in terminal half-life. No unconjugated 4'-hydroxy-bupivacaine was detected in the serum and urine of pregnant patients, in contrast with the other groups. The pregnant patients had significantly greater serum concentrations of the N-dealkylated metabolite, N-desbutyl-bupivacaine (DBB), than the non-pregnant groups. In contrast with 4'-hydroxy-bupivacaine, no conjugated forms of bupivacaine and desbutyl-bupivacaine were detected in urine. The mean total urinary excretion of bupivacaine and its metabolites and their conjugates varied between 2.46 and 3.22% of the total dose administered in the three patient groups, indicating that both 4'-hydroxylation and N-dealkylation are minor metabolic pathways in man.\r"

Total clearance of the drug was 2390 (SD 340) ml min-1, hepatic extraction 82% and hepatic clearance 1060 (260) ml min-1. During the 60-min period of observation, hepatic extraction of propofol increased from 79% to 92%. It is concluded that, within 1 h, only 44% of the administered dose is removed by the liver. Consequently, drug accumulation may occur with repeated dosing or infusion of propofol. The increase in extraction results presumably from slow release of propofol from the soy-bean emulsion.\r"

Resting tension and isometric force of contraction were measured in the adductor pollicis and masseter muscles. A sub-paralysing dose of tubocurarine 0.05 mg kg-1, a paralysing dose of atracurium 0.5 mg kg-1 or saline was given, followed 3 min later by suxamethonium 1 mg kg-1. Onset times of suxamethonium and atracurium block were shorter in the masseter than in the adductor pollicis muscle. When preceded by a sub-paralysing dose of tubocurarine, suxamethonium produced an increase in masseter tension (47 (SEM 15) g) similar to that produced by suxamethonium alone (59 (13) g). Prior administration of a paralysing dose of atracurium almost abolished this increase in tension (2.5 (2.5) g) (P less than 0.05 vs saline). The tension increase in adductor pollicis was 0, 3.2 (2.2) and 5.9 (1.1) g in the atracurium, tubocurarine and saline groups, respectively. Tubocurarine and atracurium prevented muscle fasciculations in all patients. It was concluded that increased muscle tone is a normal response to suxamethonium and is greater in the masseter than adductor pollicis. Sub-paralysing doses of non-depolarizing neuromuscular blockers have little effect, in contrast with paralysing doses. This suggests that the effect is mediated via postsynaptic receptors.\r"

The activities of the anaesthetists were videotaped and analysed independently by three reviewers. Unlike our previous study, the present study was performed at a time when automatic noninvasive arterial pressure monitors, automatic ventilators and patient breathing circuit disconnect alarms were in use. The greatest amount of intraoperative time of the anaesthetist (59.1%) was spent monitoring the patient directly (44.8%) or indirectly (14.3%) via patient monitors. This represented an increase from our previous study attributable to the increased use of technology in the operating room. The anaesthetist still spent about 10-12% of his/her time completing patient records.\r"

Small but statistically significant increases in latency of the cortical N20 (P less than 0.005) and P25 (P less than 0.001) waves and interwave conduction times of SC2 to P25 (P less than 0.005) and N20 to P25 (P less than 0.021) were observed. Cortical amplitude (N20-P25) decreased significantly (P less than 0.012), to approximately 60% of baseline. These results demonstrated that midazolam produced a depression of cortical SSEP amplitude without clinically significant alterations in latency.\r"

Alterations in their gross behaviour patterns were assessed also. The specific alpha 2-adrenoceptor agonists (yohimbine, WY 26393, RX 781094 and RS 21361) decreased sleeping time, as did the beta-adrenoceptor agonist clenbuterol. The specific alpha 2-adrenoceptor agonist clonidine gave a large increase in sleeping time at doses in excess of 25 micrograms kg-1. The same effect was seen with the beta-antagonist propranolol and the specific beta 2-antagonist ICI 118551.\r"

  ".W": "We have studied the effects of the calcium channel blockers verapamil, diltiazem and nifedipine and the volatile anaesthetics halothane, enflurane and isoflurane on myocardial metabolism after postischaemic reperfusion in the rat isolated heart-lung preparation. In the presence of the volatile anaesthetics, the preparations were perfused for 10 min, made globally ischaemic for 8 min, and then reperfused for 10 min. Each of the calcium blockers was administered 5 min before ischaemia. Three hearts in the halothane-verapamil group (n = 10) failed to recover from the ischaemia and the recovery time in the same group was significantly longer than in the enflurane-verapamil or isoflurane-verapamil groups. Although there was no significant difference in myocardial lactate concentrations among the groups, ATP and glycogen contents in the halothane-verapamil group were significantly less than those in the other groups. The results suggest that the combination of halothane and verapamil causes significant myocardial depression during recovery from ischaemia and subsequent metabolic deterioration.\r"
