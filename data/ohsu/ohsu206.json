Because of similarities between these forms of essential hypertension and pregnancy-induced hypertension, the presence of digitalislike factors in pregnancy-related fluids has been investigated. The factors are found in maternal sera with significantly higher levels of digitalislike activity, as monitored by digoxin radioimmunoassay, in the sera of third-trimester women with pregnancy-induced hypertension as compared to normotensive third-trimester controls (315 vs 195 pg digoxin equivalents/ml; p less than 0.001). Similarly, they are found in amniotic fluid, and significantly higher levels, as measured by radioimmunoassay (760 vs 540 pg digoxin equivalents/ml; p less than 0.0008) and by inhibition of ouabain-sensitive Na+,K+-adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase) (12.8 vs 2.7% inhibition; p less than 0.002), are found in those women whose pregnancies are complicated with hypertension. With purification, several digoxinlike immunoactive compounds are detected. Of these, some have a marked ability to inhibit ouabain-sensitive Na+,K+-ATPase. While as yet unidentified, these compounds have properties suggesting that they are not peptides, steroids, or fatty acids and lipids.\r"

This mechanism contributes to the good tolerance of sequential ultrafiltration-hemodialysis (SUH). This study compared PV changes induced by SUH and sequential hemodialysis-ultrafiltration (SHU). Seven dialysis patients underwent two sets of SUH and SHU, in which 2 h of UF (approximately equal to 3L) respectively preceded or followed 2 h of no-weight-change hemodialysis (ISO HD). VEM (volume of extravascular mobilization), VEM/VUF (percent of plasma refilling rate) and delta PV were calculated by mathematical formulas. Results showed: 1) a high VEM/VUF during the UF period, either before or after ISO HD: 80 and 77% respectively; 2) a significant increase in PV during ISO HD after UF, compared to ISO HD before UF: + 229 ml and + 43 ml, P less than 0.05; 3) VEM/VUF significantly higher during SUH than during SHU: 87 and 80%, P less than 0.01. In conclusion, the decrease in PV was lower in SUH than in SHU (11 vs. 19%, P less than 0.001) because the plasma refilling persisted through the ISO HD period.\r"

The apparatus comprises an RBC aggregometer head, described previously, for measuring the rate of RBC aggregation in whole blood. Its construction was modified for easy attachability and detachability without causing tube damage. In practice, the apparatus was applied by hooking it to the tube of the extracorporeal system in animals and in a clinical case of blood dialysis in a patient with renal failure, in which stoppage of blood flow elicited a dramatic change in the baseline record of light transmission of the mobile blood. The signal of the apparatus was fed to an alarm system via a voltage comparator switch. The apparatus is inexpensive, solid and durable, easy to operate by untrained personnel, and has excellent stability and reproducibility.\r"

Purified PMN were tested for chemiluminescence activity in response to a variety of triggers of the respiratory burst. Monocytes were assessed for their capacity to ingest erythrocytes sensitized with varying amounts of IgG antibodies. Both assays were demonstrated to be sensitive hallmarks of functional modulation. However, no functional differences were noted between phagocytes from blood collected prior to pheresis and those exposed to flat sheet plasmapheresis cylinders. These data suggest that plasmapheresis with the Autopheresis C system does not influence the respiratory and phagocytic function of phagocytes returned back to the donor and implies that contact of phagocytes with artificial surfaces and/or their exposure to surface-activated plasma factors generated in the collection cylinder are minimal when using this plasmapheresis method.\r"

Blood volume was measured with 51Cr tagged erythrocytes and plasma volume (PV) calculated from hematocrit. Substitution fluids were either albumin (A; n = 9) or A + gelatin (A + G; n = 9). In both groups, PE induces significant (p less than 0.01) decreases of mean arterial pressure: group A: - 21 +/- 14%; group A + G: - 23 +/- 15%; of pulmonary wedge pressure: group A: - 41 +/- 33%; group A + G: - 36 +/- 22%; of cardiac index: group A: - 38 +/- 18%; group A + G: - 25 +/- 15%. Plasma volume also decreases after PE: group A: - 13.5 +/- 4%; group A + G: - 18.5 +/- 4%. None of the variations are significantly different between the two groups. So we think that substitution with albumin alone has no advantage for hemodynamic tolerance.\r"

The physiologic changes and stresses of pregnancy and labor provide a unique and often devastating setting for coronary diseases. The mortality rate is extremely high, approaching 40% if delivery ensues within 2 weeks of infarction. A planned, induced labor with regional anesthesia and continuous invasive monitoring in a well-equipped medical center provides the safest setting for delivery. Assisted vaginal delivery may offer a lower risk of death than cesarean section. The nurse, as well as the other members of the multidisciplinary team, should be well versed in the normal physiologic stresses of pregnancy. The fetal and cardiac effects of all medications and interventions must be explored. The almost simultaneous appearance of a new child in one's life with a heightened and immediate awareness of one's own mortality can lead to overwhelming feelings of despair and anxiety. Transition to home life may be difficult. All aspects of the patient's needs from heart to hope, should be addressed.\r"

A reduced vascular volume is accompanied by a lower preload and afterload and thus a decrease in heart size. As a result cardiac efficiency and contractility improve, and oxygen demands are reduced. The temporal progression of CHF from a mild to a severe state need not be a sign of progressive pathology of heart muscle, but rather a result of feedback circuits where failure begets failure and leads to progressive cardiac enlargement, progressive hypervolemia, and peripheral edema. An appreciation of this concept permits a more optimistic approach to the management of CHF. Thus, the effective use of CAVH in reducing vascular volume and peripheral edema may in some patients reverse \"refractory\" CHF and prolong life.\r"

In addition, patients who receive treatment in the first few hours may also benefit through improved residual left ventricular function, resulting from the preservation of ischemic myocardium. Newer agents that are more effective in lysing intracoronary thrombi are currently under development. The most promising is tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA), which is being evaluated in a number of large multicenter trials, including the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute's Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) trial. In this study researchers are also comparing the additional value of early versus delayed coronary artery angioplasty and are evaluating a subset of patients randomly assigned to early beta-blocker therapy to assess the value of adjunctive pharmacologic therapy. In the future, it is likely that studies will be carried out to determine the usefulness of thrombolytic therapy given to patients by paramedics before hospitalization. Such a study is being planned in several communities. It is hoped that by means of prehospital therapy, it may be possible to treat a substantial group of patients with symptoms and electrocardiographic findings of acute MI before extensive left ventricular myocardial necrosis has occurred. If this goal can be realized, it may be possible to achieve a very substantial reduction in mortality resulting from acute MI. Initial experience with prehospital intravenous streptokinase therapy has already been reported from Jerusalem, Israel.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In 79 of these patients, an anterolateral decompression was undertaken later because of persistent neurological deficit and radiographic demonstration of encroachment on the spinal canal. One patient died of pulmonary embolism; 78 were reviewed after a mean period of four years. Of these 78 patients 18 made a complete neurological recovery while 53 appeared to have benefited from the procedure; 25 remained unchanged. The best results were obtained in burst fractures at thoracolumbar and lumbar levels when a solitary detached fragment of a vertebral body had been displaced into the spinal canal. These results indicate that anterolateral decompression of the spinal canal should be considered, after careful evaluation, for certain injuries of the spine in which there is severe neural involvement.\r"

Twenty-three patients (23 hips) underwent a Dunn's open reduction and 25 patients (30 hips) were treated by epiphysiodesis and surgical osteoplasty as advocated by Heyman and Herndon. The results of the two methods of treatment are compared. Analysis revealed that 11 hips with moderate slip (30 degrees to 50 degrees) treated by the Heyman-Herndon procedure did significantly better than the 18 hips with severe slip (greater than 50 degrees) treated by the same method. Furthermore, when these hips with severe slip were compared to the hips treated by Dunn's open reduction, all of which were displaced greater than 50 degrees, the latter fared significantly better. The authors conclude that the Heyman-Herndon procedure gave consistently good results for moderate slips, but Dunn's open reduction gave better results for hips with severe slips.\r"

Children without other injuries spent only a few days in hospital for the application and later removal of the spica. At all ages, anterior angulation of less than 20 degrees and valgus angulation of less than 15 degrees were accepted at the one-week review. Acceptance of shortening varied with the age of the child and the stage of treatment, but was 10% or less of the femoral length at the time of spica removal. At late review leg-length discrepancy was rare and clinically insignificant. This method of treatment was simple and effective. It dramatically reduced the cost of care and freed a number of children's hospital beds.\r"

Of 63 hips in 55 patients followed up for five to 13 years, 17 were hypertrophic, 24 normotrophic and 22 atrophic in type. The atrophic-type hips showed a high incidence of acetabular loosening, leading to unsatisfactory clinical results in 32%. By contrast, the hypertrophic-type hips had a low incidence of acetabular loosening, while the normotrophic type showed intermediate results. It was concluded that the osteoblastic response to osteoarthritis is closely related to acetabular loosening and to late clinical failure.\r"

For the dysplastic acetabulum the main difficulty is the lack of lateral support for the cup. In order to test the hypothesis that this support improves with an uncemented prosthesis, 38 hips with an average follow-up of 31 months were studied. Lateral support, measured radiographically, showed an average increase of 21%. The remodelling effect may be attributed to the biomechanical design of the prosthesis.\r"

One hundred hips were examined at one year follow-up; 78 were examined again at two to four years. The replacement was performed for arthritis in 76 hips and for femoral neck fracture in 24. Movement was assessed both with and without weight-bearing. In 80% of the arthritis group the prosthesis functioned as a bipolar hip replacement with movement occurring primarily at the inner metal-on-polyethylene surface. By contrast, in 75% of the fracture group the prosthesis functioned largely as a unipolar device with movement occurring primarily at the outer metal-on-cartilage surface. In all cases examined serially the movement pattern was the same at two to four years as it has been at one year. Clearly, the action of the prosthesis depends on the condition of the acetabular cartilage.\r"

The impact load was applied using a weight falling onto the transected proximal femur and the force transmitted through the knee was measured at the transected distal tibia using a load transducer. The peak force transmitted increased as, sequentially, meniscus, articular cartilage and subchondral bone were damaged or removed. The most striking result was found in an implanted knee replacement where the transmitted force reached 180% of that in the intact knee. The results show that the joint has an impact-absorbing property in each segment and that in the osteoarthritic knee there is less absorption of shock than in the normal knee. The high impact force in an implanted knee suggests that microfractures of the cancellous bone might be expected and may produce loosening.\r"

There was no residual adduction in 23 feet (52%) but only 12 had normal radiographic measurements. In the remaining feet, various forms of spurious correction of metatarsus varus and talonavicular subluxation or both were seen, resulting in normal-looking feet. Recession of the origin of abductor hallucis and release of the short plantar muscles and fascia at the time of posteromedial release is recommended. The forefoot adduction was satisfactorily corrected in 91% of the feet subsequently operated on using this modified procedure.\r"

Twenty-three consecutive patients and 23 age-matched controls were assessed by caliper measurement and standard photographs, before a first operation for ingrowing toenail. We found no differences in shape between the toenails of the patients and those of the controls, both groups showing great variation. Our results suggest that the ingrowth is not commonly associated with an abnormal shape of the nail.\r"

The recurrent laryngeal nerve chain and the jugulo-carotid chain were involved with the same frequency (greater than 80%). The anterior superior mediastinum was involved only in patients with involvement of the recurrent laryngeal nerve chain. Forty-three patients had a complete remission after initial treatment. In patients without distant metastases for whom surgery was macroscopically incomplete, relapses occurred 5 times more frequently than in patients whose surgery was complete. Six patients died from thyroid carcinoma at ages ranging from 19-44 yr, 12-33 yr after initial treatment, and 1 died from intercurrent disease. Despite favorable long term survival (90.3% at 20 yr), the standardized mortality ratio was equal to 8.1. This study underlines the need for complete surgical treatment and compulsive follow-up, which should be continued throughout the patient's life, in order to detect and effectively treat relapses of thyroid cancer.\r"

The PRL was immunoprecipitated from 100-microL aliquots of serum, and the precipitates were subjected to gel electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate, electrotransferred to nitrocellulose paper, immunoblotted with anti-hPRL serum and [125I]protein-A, and autoradiographed. The autoradiographs showed an intensely stained G-hPRL band, with a mol wt of 25K, in almost all samples studied. The nonglycosylated PRL (hPRL) band, with a mol wt of 23K, was much more variable in staining intensity from individual to individual. Some samples also had a 27K glycosylated immunoreactive PRL band. Serum samples were also obtained every other day from two women throughout a 28-day period; again, each sample had an intensely stained G-hPRL band and a hPRL band that varied in staining intensity from day to day. In contrast, however, to the G-hPRL/hPRL pattern in serum samples obtained from normal women and men, samples from pregnant women at the onset of spontaneous labor showed opposite results, that is an intensely stained hPRL band but only a faintly stained G-hPRL band. These results indicate that G-hPRL is an important component of circulating PRL in normal men and women and that it may vary in amount in certain physiologic states.\r"

  ".W": "We measured serum sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), total testosterone (T), non-SHBG-bound T, albumin-bound T, free T, and SHBG-bound T in 19 prepubertal boys with hypopituitarism. Serum SHBG decreased with age with a slope similar to that in 91 normal prepubertal boys at higher level, and therefore, it reached similar values at a later age. Serum SHBG was significantly higher in hypopituitary prepubertal boys [mean, 123 +/- 12 (+/- SE) nmol/L] than in normal prepubertal boys (76 +/- 4; P less than 0.001) despite the fact that their mean age was also higher (10.0 +/- 4 vs. 7.1 +/- 4.1 yr; P less than 0.001). In 4 boys with isolated hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (Kallman's syndrome), aged 15.6 +/- 1.5 yr, serum SHBG was 21 +/- 14 nmol/L, a value below the 95% confidence limit of the regression line in GH-deficient boys. The affinity constants of association of the SHBG-DHT complex were similar in hypopituitary and normal boys. Eleven of the 19 hypopituitary boys (mean chronological age, 8.3 +/- 2.5 yr; mean bone age, 4.1 +/- 2.1 yr) were treated with recombinant hGH (0.5 U/kg BW.week) for 1 yr. Their mean serum SHBG level before treatment was 154 +/- 14 nmol/L, and it decreased gradually to 106 +/- 5 nmol/L (P less than 0.01) after 12 months of treatment. The tendency toward normalization of serum SHBG during treatment suggested that GH deficiency was responsible for the high serum SHBG levels. Serum SHBG correlated negatively with age in both treated hypopituitary and normal boys, but the slope of the regression line was significantly steeper in treated hypopituitary boys (P less than 0.01). On the other hand, the mean serum non-SHBG-bound T level was 0.10 +/- 0.02 (+/- SE) nmol/L in hypopituitary boys, significantly lower than that in normal boys (0.21 +/- 0.02 nmol/L; P less than 0.02). Since serum total T concentrations were similar in the two groups, the higher serum SHBG concentration resulted in lower serum bioavailable T levels in the hypopituitary boys. These changes might explain the poor response to T treatment reported in GH-deficient patients. The lower serum non-SHBG-bound T concentrations in the GH-deficient boys suggest there may be delayed exposure of central nervous system structures to increased levels of sex hormones, which, in turn, may slow body maturation. This mechanism might play a role in the delay of puberty that occurs in patients with isolated GH deficiency.\r"

  ".W": "This study was undertaken to investigate the role of GH secretion in the pubertal increase in plasma somatomedin-C (Sm-C) concentrations and its relation to growth in children with true precocious puberty (PP) and normal or deficient GH secretion. We studied 37 children (9 boys and 28 girls), divided into 3 groups according to their pubertal stages and their peak stimulated plasma GH concentration. Group I (n = 20) contained patients with PP and normal GH secretion. In group II (n = 8), PP was accompanied by GH deficiency. Group III (n = 9) patients were GH deficient and prepubertal. The mean plasma Sm-C (RIA) levels in groups I and II were 2.01 +/- 0.17 (+/- SEM) and 0.59 +/- 0.21 U/mL, respectively (P less than 0.001), and it was 0.09 +/- 0.01 U/mL in group III (P less than 0.001 compared to group II). The higher mean plasma Sm-C level in group II compared to that in group III could be related to a significantly higher GH response to arginine-insulin stimulation (P less than 0.02), although this value was in the hypopituitary range. The mean growth rate in group II (6.8 +/- 0.9 cm/yr) was also much higher than the rate in group III (1.9 +/- 0.5 cm/yr; P less than 0.001) and only slightly lower than that in group I (90 +/- 0.8 cm/yr; P less than 0.05). These data indicate that plasma Sm-C values are closely correlated with even small changes in GH secretion. The observed growth rates could, in general, be linked to plasma GH and Sm-C levels, as modulated by sex steroids, in these patients with precocious puberty.\r"

All four gastrinomas tested had high levels of SRIH receptors, as did two of five insulinomas and four of five vasoactive intestinal peptide-producing tumors. Receptor visualization was obtained with two different radioligands, either a SRIH-28 analog, [125I]-[Leu8,D-Trp22,Tyr25]SRIH-28, or a SRIH octapeptide, the [125I]Tyr3 derivative of SMS 201-995 [H-DPhe-Cys-Phe-DTrp-Lys-Thr-Cys-Thr(ol)], [125I]204-090. In both cases receptors were localized over the tumor cell area only. Biochemical and pharmacological analyses of one insulinoma and two vipomas revealed saturable, high affinity binding sites with pharmacological specificity for SRIH. However, differences in receptor affinity of selected SRIH analogs, in particular SRIH-28 and SRIH octapeptides, were found between the insulinomas and the two other tumor types, vipoma and gastrinoma. The presence of SRIH receptors on various hormone-producing gastrointestinal tumors suggests that at least part of the beneficial effects of chronic therapy with SRIH analogs may be mediated through such membrane-bound receptors located on the tumor itself. SRIH receptor measurement may be of prognostic value in assessment of the therapeutic efficacy of SRIH analogs. They may also be of diagnostic value, if used as in vivo markers for the localization of small hormone-producing gastrointestinal tumors or their metastases.\r"

The participants included 34 healthy children (group 1), 29 children with idiopathic growth failure and normal GH stimulation tests (group 2), and 25 GH-deficient subjects (group 3). The mean (+/- SEM) urinary Sm-C/IGF-I excretion in group 1 (28.4 +/- 2.1 mU/kg) was significantly greater than that in group 2 (8.1 +/- 1.6 mU/kg) or group 3 (8.6 +/- 1.3 mU/kg). Twenty-two of the 29 subjects in group 2 had urinary Sm-C/IGF-I values less than 8 mU/kg. After the administration of biosynthetic GH to 12 GH-deficient subjects, urinary Sm-C/IGF-I excretion rose from 10.3 +/- 2.3 to 21.4 +/- 4.2 mU/kg within 12 h (P less than 0.05), indicating that renal excretion of Sm-C/IGF-I is GH dependent. One woman with acromegaly had markedly elevated urinary Sm-C/IGF-I excretion (420 mU/kg). The authenticity of urinary Sm-C/IGF-I was confirmed by high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC). Assay of serial dilutions of urinary Sm-C/IGF-I demonstrated a direct proportionality between concentration and dilution. Although it is not possible to identify whether urinary Sm-C/IGF-I reflects local or generalized synthesis of the peptide, we hypothesize that quantitation of Sm-C/IGF-I in timed urine collections will yield additional information about GH production and action in children with normal and abnormal growth.\r"

Pulsatile LH release and maximum LH responsiveness to exogenous GnRH were determined on 3 consecutive days: basally (day 1), during DHT infusion (day 2), and during DHT plus naloxone (Nal) infusion (day 3). Steady state plasma DHT levels of 6.5 +/- 1.1 (+/- SEM) ng/mL (22.5 +/- 3.8 nmol/L) were achieved by infusion. DHT infusion significantly decreased the maximum LH response to GnRH from 35.5 +/- 8.2 to 11.6 +/- 2.8 IU/L (P less than 0.05). This inhibitory effect was not altered by Nal. In addition, DHT significantly decreased LH pulse frequency (basal, 4.3 +/- 0.3; DHT, 2.8 +/- 0.3 pulses/6 h; P less than 0.05), but not the amplitude of the LH pulses. However, after the addition of Nal to DHT, the pulse frequency increased significantly from 2.8 +/- 0.3 to 4.7 +/- 0.3 pulses/6 h (P less than 0.05). The mean plasma LH level did not change during the infusion of DHT alone, but it did increase significantly when Nal was added (DHT, 4.8 +/- 1.0; DHT + Nal, 7.9 +/- 1.0 IU/L; P less than 0.01). The results of this acute pharmacological study suggest that androgens may have two separate effects on the hypothalamic-pituitary axis: 1) inhibition of GnRH release, which appears to be mediated via opioid peptides, and 2) inhibition of pituitary LH secretion, which is not dependent on opioids.\r"

Besides confirming previous findings of increased AVP responsiveness to osmolar challenge and reduced AVP responsiveness to upright posture in the elderly, we found that metoclopramide stimulated AVP release in both young [from 1.09 +/- 0.05 (mean +/- SD) to 1.77 +/- 0.05 pmol/L; P less than 0.05] and elderly subjects (from 1.54 +/- 0.18 to 4.73 +/- 1.82 pmol/L; P less than 0.01). The response was much greater in the elderly (P less than 0.01). The AVP responses to upright posture and metoclopramide were inversely correlated (r = -0.77; P less than 0.01), suggesting that the elderly have increased sensitivity to stimuli, such as metoclopramide, to counteract their reduced sensitivity to baroreceptor stimulation of AVP release.\r"

The mechanism and physiological consequences of this action of heparin are unknown. To explore the possibility that the heparin-induced increase in plasma free T4 is an in vitro artifact due to generation of FFA during equilibrium dialysis, we studied plasma samples from 10 subjects treated with iv heparin. In plasma from 4 of these subjects, free T4 concentrations measured by equilibrium dialysis did not increase above baseline values after heparin administration. In incubations performed in parallel with the equilibrium dialysis measurements, FFA concentrations in these plasma samples were found to increase, but in no subject did they exceed 2.5 meq/L after incubation. In contrast, in plasma from the other 6 subjects treated with heparin, free T4 concentrations rose markedly (by 130-520%) above baseline values after heparin administration. In all of these postheparin plasma samples, FFA concentrations were less than 2.8 meq/L before incubation, but rose during incubation by 80-270% to more than 3.8 meq/L. Treatment of these plasma samples with protamine to inhibit lipoprotein lipase and with specific antiserum to inhibit hepatic triglyceride lipase before equilibrium dialysis or incubation prevented, in parallel, the heparin-induced increases in FFA and free T4 concentrations. From these findings we conclude that the heparin-induced increase in free T4 is usually an in vitro artifact, and that most subjects receiving heparin have a normal plasma free T4 concentration in vivo. We also conclude that this in vitro artifact may account for many of the findings that led to the postulate of an inhibitor of T4 binding to plasma and intracellular proteins in heparin-treated patients and perhaps in patients with nonthyroid illness as well.\r"

  ".W": "Circadian variations of serum TSH concentrations have been reported, with higher values occurring in the late evening or early morning. In patients receiving long term L-T4 suppression therapy, it may be important to achieve suppression of TSH secretion throughout the day. To investigate whether undetectable serum TSH values in the morning are associated with undetectable serum TSH levels at night, serum TSH concentrations were measured by an ultrasensitive immunoradiometric assay in 16 normal subjects, 20 hyperthyroid patients, 10 patients with primary hypothyroidism (either untreated or inadequately treated with L-T4), 1 patient with central hypothyroidism, 10 patients with nontoxic nodular goiter, 5 patients with functioning thyroid adenoma, 20 patients receiving L-T4 replacement therapy, and 30 patients receiving L-T4 suppression. In 6 subjects blood was drawn at hourly intervals for 24 h; in 2 normal subjects a major TSH surge occurred between 2300-0100 h, with other minor peaks, and the same pattern was found in two patients receiving L-T4 replacement, whereas in 2 patients receiving L-T4 suppression, serum TSH was constantly below the limit of detection of the assay (i.e. less than 0.07 mU/L). In the remaining patients blood was drawn at hourly intervals between 2300-0200 h and on the next morning before (0830-0900 h) and 30 min after iv TRH administration. In normal subjects, in patients receiving L-T4 replacement therapy, and in hypothyroid patients, serum TSH values at night were higher than in the morning, with normal responses to TRH in the first 2 groups and exaggerated responses in the latter. The patient with central hypothyroidism had no nocturnal TSH surge and no TSH response to TRH. In all hyperthyroid patients, serum TSH was undetectable both at night and during the day, and none had a serum TSH response to TRH. Among patients with nontoxic goiter, 7 had detectable serum TSH in the morning, with higher values at night, and a normal response to TRH; the remainder had undetectable serum TSH both at night and in the morning, and subnormal or absent TSH responses to TRH. All 5 patients with a functioning thyroid adenoma had undetectable serum TSH levels in the morning and during the night, and subnormal or absent TSH responses to TRH. Of the 30 patients receiving long term (greater than 6 months) L-T4 suppression therapy, 28 had undetectable serum TSH both during the night and in the morning and unresponsiveness to TRH.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

Basal plasma ACTH levels were clearly elevated (26-121 pmol/L), whereas basal and stimulated serum cortisol levels were in the normal range. The pituitary source of the ACTH hypersecretion was confirmed by selective venous catheterization. Gel chromatography of the patient's plasma showed two peaks of ACTH immunoreactivity, one major peak eluting near the void volume (high mol wt form of ACTH), accounting for more than 95% of the ACTH detected, and a very small peak at the expected position of ACTH-(1-39). Plasma ACTH levels were not altered by metyrapone or bromocriptine. During high dose dexamethasone administration plasma ACTH decreased, but was not fully suppressed. Immunohistochemical evaluation of tumor tissue demonstrated ACTH immunoreactivity in 40% of the tumor cells. The patient died from postoperative complications after a second operation performed after tumor recurrence. This patient's course confirms the observations of relatively rapid growth and high recurrence rate in clinically silent corticotropic pituitary adenomas.\r"

She had an undetectable serum 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D [1,25-(OH)2D] level before treatment. Although Mg infusion increased her serum Mg levels and enhanced renal PTH action, as evidenced by an elevation in nephrogenous cAMP, the serum 1,25-(OH)2D level remained low. After the administration of 1 alpha-hydroxyvitamin D3, her serum 1,25-(OH)2D level increased, and fractional excretion of Mg decreased. With the elevation in serum 1,25-(OH)2D, serum Mg levels could be maintained without Mg infusion, although they were still subnormal. These results are consistent with the assumption that patients with the short bowel syndrome and Mg deficiency have reduced renal tubular Mg reabsorption which causes renal Mg loss, and that impaired tubular Mg reabsorption is due at least in part to deficient renal action of 1,25-(OH)2D. Because depressed serum 1,25-(OH)2D levels cannot be corrected rapidly by Mg infusion, administration of 1 alpha-hydroxyvitamin D3 or 1,25-(OH)2D3 appears to be the treatment of choice for Mg deficiency in patients with short bowel syndrome.\r"

We studied the biochemical mechanisms of the in vitro interaction between rat and human colonic mucins and axenic E. histolytica trophozoites. Crude mucus prevented amebic adherence to Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells by up to 70%. Purification of the colonic mucins by Sepharose 4B chromatography, nuclease digestion, and cesium chloride gradient centrifugation resulted in a 1,000-fold enrichment of the inhibitory mucins. Purified rat mucin inhibited amebic adherence to and cytolysis of homologous rat colonic epithelial cells. Oxidation and enzymatic cleavage of rat mucin Gal and GalNAc residues completely abrogated mucin inhibition of amebic adherence. The binding of rat 125I-mucin to amebae was galactose specific, saturable, reversible, and pH dependent. A monoclonal antibody specific for the 170-kD amebic Gal/GalNAc lectin completely inhibited the binding of rat 125I-mucin. Rat mucin bound to Affigel affinity purified the amebic lectin from conditioned medium. Colonic mucin glycoproteins act as an important host defense by binding to the parasite's adherence lectin, thus preventing amebic attachment to and cytolysis of host epithelial cells.\r"

To determine whether this lower activity is due to reduced concentration of an enzyme with normal catalytic properties or to reduced activity of an enzyme present at normal concentration, we measured erythrocyte reductase concentrations with a quantitative radioimmunoblotting method, using affinity-purified polyclonal antibodies against rat liver microsomal reductase as probe. In five patients with the \"mild\" form of recessive hereditary methemoglobinemia, in which the activity of erythrocyte reductase was 4-13% of controls, concentrations of the enzyme, measured as antigen, were also reduced to 7-20% of the control values. The concentration of membrane-bound reductase antigen, measured in the ghost fraction, was similarly reduced. Thus, in these patients, the reductase deficit is caused mainly by a reduction in NADH-cytochrome b5 reductase concentration, although altered catalytic properties of the enzyme may also contribute to the reduced enzyme activity.\r"

We therefore applied a new isotopic approach that theoretically overcomes these limitations and permits quantification of Krebs cycle carbon exchange and the individual contributions of gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis to overall glucose output. [6-3H]Glucose was infused to measure overall glucose output; [2-14C]acetate was infused to trace phosphoenolpyruvate gluconeogenesis and to calculate Krebs cycle carbon exchange as proposed by Katz. Plasma [14C]3-OH-butyrate specific activity was used to estimate intramitochondrial acetyl coenzyme A (CoA) specific activity, and finally the ratio between plasma glucose 14C-specific activity and the calculated intracellular phosphoenolpyruvate 14C-specific activity was used to determine the relative contributions of gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis to overall glucose output. Using this approach, acetyl CoA was found to enter the Krebs cycle at twice (postabsorptive subjects) and three times (2 1/2-d fasted subjects) the rate of pyruvate, respectively. Gluconeogenesis in postabsorptive subjects (3.36 +/- 0.20 mumol/kg per min) accounted for 28 +/- 2% of overall glucose output and increased twofold in subjects fasted for 2 1/2-d (P less than 0.01), accounting for greater than 97% of overall glucose output. Glycogenolysis in postabsorptive subjects averaged 8.96 +/- 0.40 mumol/kg per min and decreased to 0.34 +/- 0.08 mumol/kg per min (P less than 0.01) after a 2 1/2-d fast. Since these results agree well with previously reported values for gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis based on determinations of splanchnic substrate balance and glycogen content of serial liver biopsies, we conclude that the isotopic approach applied herein provides an accurate, noninvasive measurement of gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis in vivo.\r"

Cumulative lymphatic drainage in all continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) patients averaged 358 +/- 47 ml per 4-h exchange and reduced cumulative net transcapillary ultrafiltration at the end of the exchange by 58 +/- 7.2%. The peak ultrafiltration volume was observed before osmotic equilibrium between serum and dialysate was reached and occurred when the net transcapillary ultrafiltration rate had decreased to equal the lymphatic absorption rate. Thereafter the lymphatic absorption rate exceeded the net transcapillary ultrafiltration rate, and intraperitoneal volume decreased. Extrapolated to 4 X 2 liters, 2.5% dextrose, 6-h exchanges per d, lymphatic drainage reduced potential daily net ultrafiltration by 83.2 +/- 10.2%, daily urea clearance by 16.9 +/- 1.9%, and daily creatinine clearance by 16.5 +/- 1.9%. Although lymphatic absorption did not differ between the two groups, lymphatic drainage caused a proportionately greater reduction in net ultrafiltration in group 2 (P less than 0.025), because these patients had more rapid dialysate glucose absorption (P less than 0.05) and less cumulative transcapillary ultrafiltration (P less than 0.01). These findings indicate that cumulative lymphatic drainage significantly reduces net ultrafiltration and solute clearances in CAPD and that ultrafiltration failure in CAPD occurs when daily lymphatic absorption equals or exceeds daily transcapillary ultrafiltration. Reduction of lymphatic absorption may provide a means for future improvement in the efficiency of CAPD.\r"

Inflammatory synovial fluid Fn, while indistinguishable from plasma Fn on the basis of reactivity to polyclonal antibodies, displays alterations in molecular size and charge. Since biochemical differences between plasma and synovial fluid fibronectins might be in part due to differences in glycosylation we have compared the carbohydrate composition of plasma Fn, synovial fluid Fn, and Fn from synoviocyte conditioned medium by biochemical assay, glycopeptide analysis, and binding to a series of lectins. Synovial fluid Fn has a greater carbohydrate content but contains less sialic acid when compared with plasma Fn. Glycopeptides formed from synovial fluid Fn are smaller than plasma Fn glycopeptides. These data suggest the presence of an additional N-linked oligosaccharide chain on synovial fluid Fn. In addition, synovial fluid Fn contains N-acetyl galactosamine indicating the presence of O-linked oligosaccharides. Synovial fluid Fn and Fn isolated from rheumatoid synoviocyte-conditioned medium display strong reactivity with the lectins wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) and peanut agglutinin (PNA), whereas normal and rheumatoid plasma Fn react weakly. The PNA reactivity of synovial fluid Fn is mediated by terminal beta-galactose residues on the gelatin-binding domain, whereas the enhanced WGA reactivity of synovial Fn is mediated by a sialic acid containing oligosaccharide located on a 27-kD C-terminal fragment. These data demonstrate domain-specific biochemical differences between plasma and synovial fluid fibronectins. These differences suggest a local origin for synovial fluid Fn and may contribute to functional differences between these forms of the protein.\r"

  ".W": "Renal ammonium excretion is increased by potassium depletion and reduced by potassium loading. To determine whether changes in potassium concentration would alter ammonia transport in the medullary thick ascending limb (MAL), tubules from rats were perfused in vitro and effects of changes in K concentration within the physiological range (4-24 mM) were evaluated. Increasing K concentration from 4 to 24 mM in perfusate and bath inhibited total ammonia absorption by 50% and reduced the steady-state transepithelial NH+4 concentration gradient. The inhibition of total ammonia absorption was reversible and occurred when K replaced either Na or N-methyl-D-glucamine. Increasing K concentration in the luminal perfusate alone gave similar inhibition of total ammonia absorption. At 1-2 nl/min per mm perfusion rate, increasing K concentration in perfusion and bathing solutions had no significant effect on transepithelial voltage. With either 4 or 24 mM K in perfusate and bath, an increase in luminal perfusion rate markedly increased total ammonia absorption. Thus, both potassium concentration and luminal flow rate are important factors capable of regulating total ammonia transport by the MAL. Changes in systemic potassium balance may influence renal ammonium excretion by affecting NH+4 absorption in the MAL and altering the transfer of ammonia from loops of Henle to medullary collecting ducts.\r"

Patients with malignant disease without weight loss had a threefold higher rate of total HPS (4,980 +/- 814 pmol/h per 10(5) viable cells) than patients with benign disease without weight loss (1,278 +/- 318 pmol/h per 10(5) viable cells, P less than 0.001). Among the patients with gastric cancer, eight with preoperative weight loss had lower rates of HPS (380 +/- 90 pmol/h per 10(5) viable cells) than those without weight loss (4,061 +/- 401 pmol/h per 10(5) viable cells, P less than 0.002). The highest rates of HPS were seen in patients with colorectal cancer with liver metastases (8,005 +/- 1,975 pmol/h per 10(5) viable cells) vs. colorectal cancer patients without liver metastases (3,060 +/- 575 pmol/h per 10(5) viable cells, P less than 0.03). These data indicate that modulation of hepatic protein synthesis occurs in malignancy in man. However, the stimulatory influence of the tumor-bearing state may be overridden by the inhibitory effects of cachexia.\r"

We measured HMG CoA reductase protein concentration and microsomal enzyme activity in freshly isolated mononuclear leukocytes from normal individuals and patients with heterozygous or homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (FH). Reductase protein concentration was similar in normal and heterozygous subjects, but was over twofold elevated in patients with homozygous FH. Reductase protein concentration was inversely related to LDL receptor status. Total activity and catalytic efficiency of reductase, however, were decreased in heterozygous and homozygous FH patients. The decrease in catalytic efficiency was not due to enzyme phosphorylation or thiol-disulfide formation. Reduction of plasma cholesterol concentration over 2 h by plasmapheresis increased reductase activity, the degree of which was directly proportional to the LDL-receptor status of the subjects. Decreased HMG CoA reductase activity and catalytic efficiency in mononuclear leukocytes and perhaps other cells in FH may represent a fundamental abnormality in the regulation of this enzyme independent of that induced by the LDL-receptor defect and may provide new insight into the control of cholesterol metabolism in FH.\r"

Recent evidence suggests that these genes are not equally expressed and that the alpha 2-globin gene encodes the majority of alpha-globin. This finding would predict that a thalassemic mutation of the alpha 2-globin gene would result in a more severe loss of alpha-chain synthesis than a similar mutation in the alpha 1-globin gene. In a previous study we described a nondeletion alpha-thalassemia defect in the alpha 2-globin gene resulting from an AUG----ACG initiation codon mutation. In the present study we describe a different initiation codon mutation, AUG----GUG, present in the alpha 1-globin gene. The alpha 1- and alpha 2-globin gene initiation codon mutations result in similarly lowered levels of encoded mRNA. Despite the similarity of these two mutations, the alpha 2 mutant results in a more severe loss of alpha-globin synthesis and a more severe clinical alpha-thalassemia phenotype than the corresponding alpha 1-globin gene mutation. This difference reflects the dominant role of alpha 2-globin gene in overall alpha-globin synthesis.\r"

At a maternal concentration of 1 microgram/ml, cimetidine clearance from the maternal circulation was 0.58 +/- 0.16 ml/min per g placenta, a rate about one third that of antipyrine. There was no evidence of cimetidine metabolism by the placenta. Transfer of cimetidine from maternal to fetal compartments showed no saturation kinetics and was not inhibited by putative carrier competitors. Cimetidine did not accumulate against a drug concentration gradient. Fetal clearance of cimetidine was similar to maternal clearance. Studies with placental apical vesicles confirmed lack of saturability of cimetidine transport and of its concentration within vesicles. Thus, (a) cimetidine is transported across the human placenta bidirectionally at a rate about one third that of antipyrine, (b) the drug is not metabolized by the placenta, and (c) the transport is a passive one.\r"

  ".W": "Roles for both the tripeptide, GSH, and individual amino acids in modifying the cellular response to oxygen deprivation-induced injury have been suggested by prior work in kidney and other tissues, but the precise interrelationships have not been clearly defined. We have studied the effects of GSH, its component amino acids, and related compounds on the behavior of isolated renal proximal tubules in a well characterized model of hypoxic injury in vitro. GSH, the combination of cysteine, glutamate, and glycine and glycine alone, when present in the medium during 30 min hypoxia, a duration sufficient to produce extensive irreversible injury in untreated tubules, were protective. Significant effects were detected at 0.25 mM concentrations of the reagents, and protection was nearly complete at concentrations of 1 mM and above. Glutamate and cysteine alone were not protective. The exogenous GSH added to the tubule suspensions was rapidly degraded to its component amino acids. Treatment of tubules with GSH or cysteine, but not glycine, increased intracellular GSH levels. Oxidized GSH was protective. Serine, N-(2-mercaptopropionyl)-glycine, and a panel of agents known to modify injury produced by reactive oxygen metabolites were without benefit. These observations identify a novel and potent action of glycine to modify the course of hypoxic renal tubular cell injury. This effect is independent of changes in cellular GSH metabolism and appears to be unrelated to alterations of cell thiols or reactive oxygen metabolites. Further elucidation of its mechanism may provide insight into both the basic pathophysiology of oxygen deprivation-induced cell injury and a practical way to ameliorate it.\r"

  ".W": "After fibrin polymerization, activated Factor XIII catalyzes the formation of intermolecular cross-links between gamma-chain pairs and also among two or more alpha-chains to form polymers. In this report we characterize the size and heterogeneity of alpha-chain polymers, establish the role of high concentrations of Factor XIII in determining the extent and rate of alpha-polymer formation, and also provide evidence that the Factor XIII required can be provided by platelets. Fibrin prepared from purified fibrinogen or platelet-deficient plasma contained a series of cross-linked alpha-chain polymers with Mr from 140,000 to 770,000 with a mean Mr difference of 32,000 consistent with a staggered, overlapping addition of monomers to the growing alpha-polymer chain. In plasma containing no platelets, alpha-polymer formation was incomplete with residual alpha-monomer remaining, but higher platelet counts facilitated more rapid cross-linking into larger polymers. Purified Factor XIII was equally effective as platelets in facilitating cross-linking. We conclude that cross-linked alpha-polymer chains are heterogeneous in size reaching a molecular weight of several million and that high concentrations of Factor XIII as provided by platelets are required for maximum cross-linking.\r"

  ".W": "Persons exposed to nicotine develop tolerance to many of its effects. When heart rate and forearm venous blood concentration are plotted against time after intravenous administration of nicotine, a greater increase in heart rate is seen for a given nicotine concentration during the rising phase of nicotine concentrations than during the decreasing phase. This could be due to acute tolerance or to more rapid distribution of drug to effect site (brain) than to venous blood. To distinguish between these possibilities, six rabbits were given nicotine intravenously. Blood samples were taken from the internal jugular vein (reflecting brain concentration), and the femoral vein and artery. Brain concentrations peaked before femoral venous concentrations. Seven men received intravenous infusions of nicotine. Peripheral venous blood concentrations and cardiovascular responses were measured. Heart rate peaked before venous concentrations. A physiological kinetic model, fit to the rabbit data, was scaled to humans and used to predict \"brain\" concentrations in them. Heart rate and predicted brain concentrations peaked simultaneously. We conclude that the rapid development of tolerance to the cardioaccelerating effect of nicotine can be attributed, at least in part, to its distribution kinetics.\r"

Red cells inhibited oxidation of ferrocytochrome c by H2O2. Cells treated with aminotriazole no longer inhibited, indicating that protection was almost entirely due to intracellular catalase. Contribution by the GSH system was slight, and apparent only with low H2O2 concentrations when catalase was inhibited by aminotriazole. The cells were about a quarter as efficient at inhibiting cytochrome c oxidation as an equivalent concentration of purified catalase. No inhibition of O2(-)-dependent reduction of ferricytochrome c or nitroblue tetrazolium was observed, although extracted red cell superoxide dismutase inhibited nitroblue tetrazolium reduction at one fortieth the concentration of that in the cells. Red cells efficiently inhibited deoxyribose oxidation by hydroxyl radicals generated from H2O2, O2- and Fe(EDTA), and myeloperoxidase-dependent oxidation of methionine to methionine sulfoxide by stimulated neutrophils. Most of the red cell inhibition of hydroxyl radical production, and all the inhibition of methionine oxidation, was prevented by blocking intracellular catalase with aminotriazole. Thus red cells are able to efficiently scavenge H2O2, but not O2-, produced in their environment, and to inhibit formation of hydroxyl radicals and hypochlorous acid. They may therefore have an important role in extracellular antioxidant defense.\r"

The presence in serum of SC5b-9, an inactive C5b-9 containing S protein, was assessed quantitatively by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using an antibody (Ab) to neoantigens expressed on C9 when complexed with C5b-8 or after tubular polymerization. SC5b-9 was detected in all 19 GBS, four patients with paraprotein-associated neuropathy and five of six patients with chronic recurrent polyneuritis. No SC5b-9 was detected in 10 normal controls. Kinetic studies from six GBS patients showed the highest values of SC5b-9 on the 3rd to 5th d of admission; in contrast, the anti-PNM Ab were highest on the day of admission. Anti-PNM Ab fell rapidly to very low levels by the 15th to 20th d. SC5b-9 declined with similar kinetics to undetectable levels by the 30th d. Levels of Ab and SC5b-9 did not quantitatively correlate with soluble immune complexes in these patients' serum. Membrane-bound C5b-9 was also detected by immunohistochemistry in the peripheral nerves from a GBS patient. These results, which show a relationship between levels of complement-fixing anti-PNM Ab and the tissue-damaging C5b-9 complex, suggest that peripheral nerve myelin may serve as the target for Ab-mediated complement attack.\r"

The two diets, both taken for 4 wk in a crossover design were of otherwise identical composition. During the soybean protein diet period, total cholesterol was reduced by 15.9% and LDL-cholesterol by 16.4%. The diet containing animal proteins exerted no significant change in plasma lipid levels vs. the baseline findings. The soybean diet regimen dramatically affected the degradation of LDL by mononuclear cells. Degradation was increased 16-fold vs. the basal activity and 8-fold compared with the standard low lipid diet with animal proteins. There was, however, no clear relationship between the reduction of total and LDL-cholesterolemia and the increased LDL degradation. These findings confirm similar data previously obtained in cholesterol-fed rats and suggest that some factor/s, most likely of a protein nature, may regulate the expression of lipoprotein receptors in peripheral cells, particularly when receptor activity is suppressed by experimental diets and/or spontaneous hypercholesterolemia.\r"

In the present studies, human umbilical vein endothelial cells were infected with Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV) to model systemic viral disease. The already abnormal adherence of sickle erythrocytes to control endothelium is enhanced 1.8 +/- 0.4-fold to HSV-infected endothelium (P less than 0.001). This component of potentiated adherence is eliminated by maneuvers that block Fc receptors, it is prevented by tunicamycin, and it is not seen using a mutant HSV that is unable to express the Fc receptor glycoprotein. Thus, the incremental adherence seen here occurs due to expression of Fc receptor activity on HSV-infected endothelium and the consequent recognition of abnormal amounts of IgG on sickle erythrocytes. We conclude that systemic viral infection potentially can induce a novel mechanism for enhancement of erythrocyte adherence to endothelium and that this may increase the likelihood of vasocclusion during viral infection.\r"

Immediately after instillation of antigen through a bronchoscope wedged into a subsegmental airway, all 17 allergic asthmatics but none of the nine normal subjects had visible airway constriction. The asthmatics had a concomitant mean increase in BAL histamine of 23% (P = 0.005), whereas the normals had no change in BAL histamine. Among the allergic asthmatics, the change in BAL histamine content in response to antigen directly correlated with the control (baseline) BAL histamine content (r = 0.66, P = 0.003). Moreover, asthmatics with large antigen-induced changes in BAL histamine had greater airway methacholine sensitivity than did asthmatics without measurable increases in BAL histamine (8 +/- 2 vs. 41 +/- 31 breath units). Neither asthmatics nor normal subjects had airway constriction or changes in BAL histamine levels in response to nonspecific challenge with cold saline. Our data suggest that when allergic asthmatics are exposed to relevant antigens they have in vivo lung mast cell degranulation which results in airway constriction and contributes to nonspecific airway hyperresponsiveness.\r"

We have utilized an immunochemical assay for prothrombin fragment F1 + 2 to quantify Factor Xa activity upon prothrombin in the plasma of 199 healthy males between the ages of 42 and 80. The levels of F1 + 2 in this population generally increased as a function of age (P less than 0.0001). The metabolic behavior of this marker was determined in 10 individuals greater than 65 yr of age with varying levels of F1 + 2, which ranged from 1.28 to 5.85 nM. The elevations in the concentration of this component were not due to diminished clearance of the fragment. Radio-immunoassays for fibrinopeptide A (FPA) and the protein C activation peptide (PCP) were subsequently employed to measure thrombin activity upon fibrinogen and thrombin-thrombomodulin activity upon protein C, respectively, in 82 members of this population ranging in age from 42 to 80. Significant positive correlations were again observed between increasing age and the level of F1 + 2 (P less than 0.0001) as well as FPA (P less than 0.01) and PCP (P less than 0.002). The results of this cross-sectional study indicate that many apparently normal males of increasing age with normal immunologic levels of antithrombin III and protein C exhibit a biochemical defect that denotes the presence of an acquired prethrombotic state.\r"

The mean prothrombin fragment F1 + 2 concentration in stably anticoagulated individuals without an inherited thrombotic diathesis (mean prothrombin time [PT] ratio [PT of patient/PT of normal plasma pool] = 1.74) was 0.231 nM as compared with a mean plasma F1 + 2 level of 1.68 nM for a nonanticoagulated control group (P less than 0.0001). The initiation of oral anticoagulants in two subjects who did not exhibit protein C deficiency led to a paradoxical increase in F1 + 2 levels during the first day of therapy. We have also shown that a relatively low intensity regimen of warfarin (PT ratio less than 1.2) may reduce elevated concentrations of F1 + 2 into the normal range in patients with a history of recurrent thromboembolism. The mean F1 + 2 level in antithrombin-deficient individuals on warfarin was significantly elevated (mean = 0.714 nM) as compared with that in anticoagulated subjects with protein C deficiency (mean = 0.205 nM) or in those without an inherited thrombotic disorder (P less than 0.01) at equivalent levels of intensity of oral anticoagulation. We therefore conclude that the effect of warfarin on hemostatic system activation is modulated by the endogenous heparan sulfate-antithrombin mechanism.\r"

Similar analyses of primary human lung carcinomas of different histopathological types revealed a highly selective and strong elevation of fur expression in nonsmall cell lung carcinomas, but not in small cell lung carcinomas. These results indicate that fur expression can be used to discriminate between these two types of human lung cancer.\r"

However, when PMN were plated on polystyrene surfaces coated with serum, fibronectin, vitronectin, laminin, or human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC), rTNFs induced a massive, prolonged secretory response, similar to that elicited by phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) or bacteria. On serum-coated plates, the maximum sustained rate of H2O2 release in response to rTNF alpha was 2.6 +/- 0.2 nmol/min per 10(6) PMN, the same as that with PMA; release continued for 73 +/- 4 min. On laminin-coated surfaces or HUVEC, release of H2O2 in response to rTNFs was slower, but lasted approximately 3.5 h, reaching the same total (greater than 100 nmol/10(6) PMN). Not only was this response far longer and larger than for other soluble stimuli of the respiratory burst studied with PMN in suspension, but the concentration necessary to elicit a half-maximal response (EC50) for rTNF alpha was orders of magnitude lower (55 pM). Responses were similar with FMLP, but ranged from zero to small with recombinant IFN alpha, recombinant IFN beta, recombinant IFN gamma, platelet-derived growth factor, recombinant IL-1 beta, or bacterial lipopolysaccharide. Adherent monocytes did not secrete H2O2 in response to rTNFs. H2O2 secretion by adherent PMN was first detectable 15-90 min after addition of rTNFs or FMLP. This lag period was unaffected by prior exposure of PMN to rTNF alpha in suspension, by allowing PMN to adhere before adding rTNF alpha, or by incubating adherent PMN in medium conditioned by rTNF alpha-treated PMN. Cytochalasins abolished H2O2 secretion in response to rTNFs, but not FMLP, if added during, but not after, the lag period. Thus, H2O2 secretion from rTNF alpha-treated PMN appears to be a direct but delayed response that requires assembly of microfilaments during exposure to the cytokine. These results suggest that PMN adherent to intra- or extravascular surfaces may undergo a massive, prolonged respiratory burst at the command of macrophages and lymphocytes reacting to microbial products and antigens.\r"

Utilizing in vitro microperfusion techniques, we found that activation of protein kinase C with either PMA or L-alpha-1,2-DOG significantly inhibited net sodium absorption, net potassium secretion and transepithelial voltage in a dose-dependent manner. There was no effect on net chloride or total CO2 transport. In contrast, the inactive phorbol analogues did not alter either sodium or potassium transport. These studies demonstrate that in the rabbit cortical collecting tubule sodium and potassium transport can be inhibited by compounds known to activate proteins kinase C. Thus, hormones that induce phosphatidylinositol turnover in the rabbit cortical collecting tubule may lead to inhibition of sodium transport by activation of protein kinase C.\r"

A mutant form, designated apoCIISt. Michael (apoCIIs), was identified by two-dimensional electrophoresis and Western blot using anti-apoCII antiserum. The isoelectric point of apoCIIs was similar to that of normal apoCII, but its apparent molecular weight was 3,000 greater. Tryptic peptides of apoCIIs were identified that had retention times in reverse-phase high pressure liquid chromatography and amino acid compositions indistinguishable from that of residues 1 to 48 and 51 to 55 of normal apoCII. The complete sequence of apoCIIs was deduced from a combination of the sequence analysis of tryptic peptides corresponding to residues 56 through 96 and the known sequence of the apoCII gene. ApoCIIs differed from apoCII at residue 70 where Gln70 was replaced by Pro70 and the sequence terminated with Pro96. This is consistent with a base insertion in the codon for Asp69 or Gln70 in the apoCII gene and a subsequent translation reading frame shift. Both patients were homozygous for apoE-4. This and the absence of normal apoCII is consistent with homozygozity at the apoE-CII gene locus on chromosome 19. Both siblings and several relatives had premature ischemic vascular disease, in contrast with its apparent absence in other apoCII-deficient families.\r"

  ".W": "A shuttle vector plasmid, pZ189, was utilized to assess the types of mutations that cells from a patient with xeroderma pigmentosum, complementation group D, introduce into ultraviolet (UV) damaged, replicating DNA. Patients with xeroderma pigmentosum have clinical and cellular UV hypersensitivity, increased frequency of sun-induced skin cancer, and deficient DNA repair. In comparison to UV-treated pZ189 replicated in DNA repair-proficient cells, there were fewer surviving plasmids, a higher frequency of plasmids with mutations, fewer plasmids with two or more mutations in the marker gene, and a new mutagenic hotspot. The major type of base substitution mutation was the G:C to A:T transition with both cell lines. These results, together with similar findings published earlier with cells from a xeroderma pigmentosum patient in complementation group A, suggest that isolated G:C to A:T somatic mutations may be particularly important in generation of human skin cancer by UV radiation.\r"

  ".W": "Although antisera to specific placental folate receptors inhibits the uptake of 5-methyltetrahydrofolate into cultured malignant human cells, little is known of the functional significance of folate receptors in normal human cells. Human bone marrow cells were therefore assayed for erythropoietic burst-forming units in the presence of an antihuman placental folate receptor serum and preimmune serum to determine the role of such a receptor in erythroid differentiation. When marrow cells were assayed in the presence of anti-receptor antiserum, there was (i) a threefold increase in erythropoietic burst formation and a twofold increase in the number of cells per erythroid burst; (ii) morphological evidence for nuclear/cytoplasmic dissociation of orthochromatic normoblasts composing erythroid bursts (megaloblastic erythropoiesis); (iii) intracellular folate deficiency with a 70% reduction of intracellular folate in antiserum treated cells as compared with control cells; and (iv) complete reversal of antiserum-induced changes on preincubation of antiserum with purified human placental folate receptor. These data support the conclusion that folate receptors on marrow cells provide an important function in the cellular uptake of folates during in vitro erythropoiesis. This process of folate uptake also appears to play a pivotal role in the differentiation and proliferation of erythroid progenitor cells.\r"

We now provide direct evidence that the Pena determinant is associated with glycoprotein (GP) IIIa, but that it is distinct from epitopes that define the PlA system. By ELISA wherein monoclonal antibodies specific for GPIIb (Tab) and specific for GPIIIa (AP3) were used to capture and hold antigens from a platelet lysate prepared under conditions that generate free GPIIb and GPIIIa, anti-Pena reacted with GPIIIa held by AP3 but not with GPIIb held by Tab. In an alternative ELISA where purified GPIIIa from both PlA1-positive and PlA1-negative platelets were used individually as antigen, anti-Pena reacted with both allelic forms of GPIIIa. By radioimmuno-precipitation, anti-Pena precipitated a single surface-labeled membrane protein with electrophoretic characteristics in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels, under nonreduced or reduced conditions, identical to those of GPIIIa. By fluorocytometry, platelets from several donors, regardless of PlA phenotype, bound an amount of anti-Pena roughly equivalent to one-half that amount of anti-PlA1 bound by PlA1 homozygous (A1/A1) platelets and roughly equal to that amount of anti-PlA1 bound by PlA1 heterozygous (A1/A2) platelets. Using platelets from donors typed homozygous for PlA1 and Pena in a quantitative indirect binding assay, 14-24,000 molecules of anti-Pena and 41-51,000 molecules of anti-PlA1 were bound per platelet at saturation. Anti-Pena completely inhibited ADP-induced aggregation of Pena-positive platelets, regardless of PlA phenotype. These results indicate that the Pena determinant is associated with GPIIIa but distinct from PlA.\r"

The mismatched double-stranded RNA blocked HIV-associated particulate reverse transcriptase activity and viral-mediated cytopathic effects. Also, polyI.polyC12U preserved the alloreactivity of T cell clones after exposure to HIV.PolyI.polyC12U appeared to act at a level subsequent to host cell infection and reverse transcription. It had no effect on the enhancement of gene expression by the HIV transcription unit tatIII. These findings indicate that early in the course of infection of CD4+ T lymphocytes, HIV can directly abrogate proliferation to specific allodeterminants, and that this function is preserved in the presence of polyI.polyC12U. They also provide insight into the mechanism of antiviral action of a class of agent with potential clinical utility in AIDS.\r"

Heterogeneity of this defect has been shown at the protein and mRNA level. Southern blot analysis of genomic DNA was performed after digestion with six different restriction endonucleases in 24 families affected with type 1 HANE (low antigenic and functional C1-INH levels) and five with type 2 (low functional C1-INH levels and normal or elevated levels of dysmorphic C1-INH). Blots were hybridized with a C1-INH cDNA probe of 1,227 bp. With one enzyme (Pst I), two different patterns of restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) were detected. One was present in one kindred with type 1 HANE and the other appeared the same in one type 1 and in one type 2 family, thus indicating that each RFLP resulted from a different mutation. Analysis of a total of 34 members of these three families suggested that the polymorphisms are tightly linked to the mutation responsible for the disease. Using a 170-bp probe we showed that the three different mutations leading to these polymorphisms are located in the same region of the C1-INH gene. These data suggest that different mutations in the same region of the C1-INH gene are responsible for C1-INH deficiency in these families. Most of these mutations are probably point mutations or other \"minor\" defects and do not appear to be due to major deletions or rearrangements.\r"

The gelatinase had an Mr of 90,000 and was immunologically cross-reactive with human neutrophil gelatinase. When newly synthesized 35S-methionine-labeled proteins were analyzed, the proteinase appeared to be a major secretion product of alveolar macrophages. Chromatography on gelatin-Sepharose gave a single peak of activity that was predominantly composed of the 90,000-mol-wt proteinase. The proteolytic activity in the gelatin-Sepharose-purified material was inhibited by EDTA and 1,10-phenanthroline, but not by N-ethylmaleimide or phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, indicating that the proteinase was a metalloproteinase. The partially purified material was also capable of degrading native type V collagen and this degradation was inhibited in the presence of an antibody to neutrophil gelatinase. The data suggest that human alveolar macrophages in culture elaborate a metalloproteinase that degrades both native type V collagen and denatured collagens.\r"

Morphologically, cultured cells were epithelial in type, and similar to collecting duct principal cells. Cell pH measured fluorometrically in monolayers grown on glass slides showed recovery from acid loads in Na+-free media. Recovery was inhibited by cyanide, oligomycin A, and N-ethylmaleimide. Cyanide and oligomycin inhibited recovery less in the presence than in the absence of glucose. When cells were first acid loaded in a Na+-free medium and then exposed to external Na+, pH recovery also took place. This recovery exhibited first-order dependence on Na+ concentration and was inhibited by 5-(N-ethyl-N-isopropyl)amiloride. These studies demonstrate that in culture, collecting duct principal cells possess at least two mechanisms for acid extrusion: a proton ATP-ase and an Na+-H+ exchanger. The former may be responsible for some component of the urinary acidification observed in the papillary collecting duct in vivo; the role of the latter in acid-base transport remains uncertain.\r"

Specimens of normal esophagus, stomach, and duodenum were examined and compared with specimens of columnar metaplasia in the esophagus (Barrett's esophagus) and specimens of adenocarcinoma of the esophagus and stomach. Specific terminal glycoconjugate structures were found for the esophagus, stomach, and duodenum. Minor differences were found between the antral and fundic gland mucosae, reflecting their respective cell populations. In biopsies of Barrett's esophagus, gastric-type columnar metaplasia expressed glycoconjugates indistinguishable from those in the normal stomach. In specialized-type columnar metaplasia, a more restricted expression of glycoconjugates was seen resembling the normal duodenum. The presence of low grade dysplasia in Barrett's esophagus associated with adenocarcinoma had no impact on glycoconjugate expression. However, a distinctive difference in glycosylation was seen in high grade dysplasia of the columnar-lined esophagus and in adenocarcinoma of the esophagus and stomach. Barrett's esophagus is a morphological mosaic in which the glycoconjugate expression resembles that seen in the normal stomach and duodenum. However, in high grade dysplasia and carcinoma, variable deletion of glycoconjugate expression can be found.\r"

The resulting increase in plasma Ca could be used as an easily measured index of bone resorption. Three bisphosphonates produced a dose-related prevention and reversal of retinoid-induced hypercalcemia. Their potencies were similar to those previously obtained by histomorphometry. Irradiation (600 rad) of the rats prevented hypercalcemia but failed to reverse it, showing that proliferation of osteoclast precursor cells was important in inducing, but not in maintaining, bone resorption. Calcitonin produced similar effects on calcemia and prevented the increase in osteoclast number but failed to reverse the increase, suggesting that it inhibited precursor proliferation. This model represents a new tool to study mechanisms of bone resorption and the action of inhibitors in vivo.\r"

We studied the kinetics of VLDL and LDL apolipoprotein B (apoB), using 125I-VLDL and 131I-LDL, in a 9-yr-old female with CESD and elevated total cholesterol (TC) (271.0 +/- 4.4 mg/dl), triglyceride (TG) (150.0 +/- 7.8 mg/dl), and LDL cholesterol (184.7 +/- 3.4 mg/dl). These studies demonstrated a markedly elevated production rate (PR) of apoB, primarily in LDL, with normal fractional catabolism of apoB in VLDL and LDL. Urine mevalonate levels were elevated, indicative of increased synthesis of endogenous cholesterol. Treatment with lovastatin, a competitive inhibitor of hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase, resulted in significant reductions in TC (196.8 +/- 7.9 mg/dl), TG (100.8 +/- 20.6 mg/dl), and LDL cholesterol (102.0 +/- 10.9 mg/dl). Therapy reduced VLDL apoB PR (5.2 vs. 12.2 mg/kg per d pretreatment) and LDL apoB PR (12.7 vs. 24.2 mg/kg per d pretreatment). Urine mevalonate levels also decreased during therapy. These results indicate that, in CESD, the inability to release free cholesterol from lysosomal CE resulted in elevated synthesis of endogenous cholesterol and increased production of apoB-containing lipoproteins. Lovastatin reduced both the rate of cholesterol synthesis and the secretion of apoB-containing lipoproteins.\r"

Fucosyl probe and diffusible sugars had no effect on these parameters. These studies suggested membrane lectins with specificity for galactosyl and mannosyl residues may be responsible for the binding of CFU-C to supporting stroma. To determine if CFU-C possesses homing receptors with these specificities, we induced agglutination in marrow cell suspensions with these neoglycoprotein probes. Selective agglutination was observed only by galactosyl and mannosyl probes. The results suggest that CFU-C homing receptors are membrane lectins with specificity for galactosyl and mannosyl residues.\r"

To gain insight into the processes that modulate the level of fibronectin secretion by these cells, we used monocytes, in vitro matured monocytes and alveolar macrophages as models to compare fibronectin mRNA levels and fibronectin secretion in a variety of circumstances. Using Northern analysis and dot-blot analysis with a 32P-labeled human fibronectin cDNA probe, we evaluated steady-state mRNA levels and a human fibronectin-specific ELISA was used to evaluate fibronectin secretion. In all cases the amounts of fibronectin secreted paralleled fibronectin mRNA levels. Specifically (a) when fibronectin mRNA was undetectable, as in the case of normal blood monocytes, no fibronectin was secreted, but whenever fibronectin mRNA was present, as in normal alveolar macrophages, fibronectin was secreted by the cells; (b) as monocytes matured into macrophages in vitro, the cells began to express fibronectin mRNA and the cells secreted fibronectin; (c) when alveolar macrophages were activated with surface stimuli such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or immune complexes, fibronectin mRNA levels decreased and in parallel, the cells secreted less fibronectin; (d) in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), alveolar macrophages contained severalfold more fibronectin mRNA transcripts that normal and the cells spontaneously secreted severalfold more fibronectin than normal; and (e) when IPF alveolar macrophages were placed in culture the fibronectin mRNA levels in the cells decreased with time, and concurrently the amounts of fibronectin produced per unit time continually decreased. The observation of a strict concordance of fibronectin mRNA levels and fibronectin release by mononuclear phagocytes suggests that, at least in many circumstances, fibronectin secretion by mononuclear phagocytes is controlled by steady-state levels of fibronectin mRNA.\r"

  ".W": "It has been proposed that oxygen free radicals mediate damage that occurs during postischemic reperfusion. Recombinant human superoxide dismutase (r-h-SOD) has been shown to be effective at reducing reperfusion injury, but it is not known if this infused enzyme actually reduces oxygen free radical concentrations in the myocardial tissue. Electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy was used to directly measure the effect of r-h-SOD on free radical concentrations in the postischemic heart. Hearts were freeze clamped at 77 degrees K after 10 min of normothermic global ischemia followed by 10 s of reflow with control perfusate (n = 7) or perfusate containing 60,000 U r-h-SOD (n = 7). The spectra of these hearts exhibited three different signals: signal A isotropic, g = 2.004, identical to the carbon-centered ubiquinone free radical; signal B anisotropic with axial symmetry, g parallel = 2.033, g perpendicular = 2.005, identical to the oxygen-centered alkyl peroxyl free radical; and the signal C an isotropic triplet, g parallel = 2.000, an = 24 G, similar to a nitrogen-centered free radical such as a peroxyl amine. With r-h-SOD administration the concentration of the oxygen free radical, signal B, was reduced 49% from 6.8 +/- 0.3 microM to 3.5 +/- 0.3 microM (P less than 0.01) and the concentration of the nitrogen free radical, signal C, was reduced 38% from 3.4 +/- 0.3 to 2.1 +/- 0.3 microM (P less than 0.01). The concentration of the carbon-centered free radical, signal A, however, was increased 51% from 3.3 +/- 0.2 to 5.0 +/- 0.2 microM (P less than 0.01). Identical reperfusion with peroxide-inactivated r-h-SOD did not alter the concentrations of free radicals indicating that the specific enzymatic activity of r-h-SOD is required to decrease the concentrations of reactive oxygen free radicals. Additional measurements performed varying the duration of reflow demonstrate a burst of oxygen free radical generation peaking at 10 s of reperfusion. r-h-SOD entirely abolished this burst. These studies demonstrate that superoxide-derived free radicals are generated during postischemic reperfusion and suggest that the beneficial effect of r-h-SOD is due to its specific enzymatic scavenging of superoxide free radicals.\r"

In this study, the effects of doxorubicin were examined in human skin fibroblast cultures with respect to collagen production and fibroblast proliferation. The results indicated that the synthesis of hydroxyproline as a marker of collagen production was markedly reduced, with an approximate concentration of inhibitor yielding 50% inhibition of 1 microM. This inhibition could be explained, in part, by generalized inhibition of total protein synthesis, but in addition, there was a significant inhibition of prolyl hydroxylation during collagen biosynthesis, as indicated by a reduction in the ratio of [3H]hydroxyproline/([3H]hydroxyproline + [3H]proline). The latter effect was shown to result from inhibition of prolyl hydroxylase by doxorubicin. As a consequence of reduced prolyl hydroxylation, the stability of newly synthesized procollagen triple helix was shown to be compromised. At the same time, doxorubicin significantly reduced fibroblast proliferation in vitro, as determined by [3H]thymidine incorporation. Thus, reduced collagen production and inhibition of fibroblast proliferation may explain the reduced wound healing in patients undergoing treatment with doxorubicin.\r"

  ".W": "Diflunisal, 5-(2',4'-difluorophenyl)salicylic acid, excreted in urine as its glucuronide, was given to normal humans (n = 6) along with a glucose load specifically labeled with 14C. Glucuronide excreted by each subject was reduced to its glucoside and glucose from it degraded to yield the distribution of 14 C in its six carbons. Randomization of the 14C from the specifically labeled glucose was taken as a measure of the extent to which glucose was deposited indirectly (i.e., glucose----lactate----glucose----6-P----glycogen), rather than directly (i.e., glucose----glucose-6-P----glycogen). The maximum contribution to glycogen formation by the direct pathway was estimated to be 65 +/- 1%, on the assumption that glucuronide and glycogen are derived from the same hepatic pool of glucose-6-P in liver. Evidence that supports that assumption was obtained by comparing the randomization of 14C in the urinary glucuronide with that in glucose in blood from the hepatic vein of four of the subjects before and after they were given glucagon. Other evidence supporting the assumption was obtained by comparing in two subjects 3H/14C ratios in glucose from hepatic vein blood before and after glucagon administration with that in urinary glucuronide, having labeled the uridine diphosphate (UDP)-glucose in their livers with 14C by giving them 1-[14C]galactose and their circulating glucose with 3H by giving a 5-[3H]glucose-labeled load. It is concluded that glucuronide formation in humans can be used to trace glucose metabolism in the liver, and that in humans the indirect pathway of glucose metabolism is active.\r"

  ".U": "88059630\r", 
  ".W": "The role of adrenergic agents in augmenting proximal tubular salt and water flux, was studied in a preparation of freshly isolated rabbit renal proximal tubular cells in suspension. Norepinephrine (NE, 10(-5) M) increased sodium influx (JNa) 60 +/- 5% above control value. The alpha adrenergic antagonist, phentolamine (10(-5) M), inhibited the NE-induced enhanced JNa by 90 +/- 2%, while the beta adrenergic antagonist, propranolol, had a minimal inhibitory effect (10 +/- 2%). The alpha adrenergic subtype was further defined. Yohimbine (10(-5) M), an alpha2 adrenergic antagonist but not prazosin (10(-5) M), an alpha1 adrenergic antagonist completely blocked the NE induced increase in JNa. Clonidine, a partial alpha2 adrenergic agonist, increased JNa by 58 +/- 2% comparable to that observed with NE (10(-5) M). Yohimbine, but not prazosin, inhibited the clonidine-induced increase in JNa, confirming that alpha2 adrenergic receptors were involved. Additional alpha2 adrenergic agents, notably p-amino clonidine and alpha-methyl-norepinephrine, imparted a similar increase in JNa. The clonidine-induced increase in JNa could be completely blocked by the amiloride analogue, ethylisopropyl amiloride (EIPA, 10(-5) M). The transport pathway blocked by EIPA was partially inhibited by Li and cis H+, but stimulated by trans H+, consistent with Na+-H+ antiport. Radioligand binding studies using [3H]prazosin (alpha1 adrenergic antagonist) and [3H]rauwolscine (alpha2 adrenergic antagonist) were performed to complement the flux studies. Binding of [3H]prazosin to the cells was negligible. In contrast, [3H]rauwolscine showed saturable binding to a single class of sites, with Bmax 1678 +/- 143 binding sites/cell and KD 5.4 +/- 1.4 nM. In summary, in the isolated rabbit renal proximal tubular cell preparation, alpha2 adrenergic receptors are the predominant expression of alpha adreno-receptors, and in the absence of organic Na+-cotransported solutes, alpha2 adrenergic agonists enhance 22Na influx into the cell by stimulating the brush border membrane Na+-H+ exchange pathway.\r"

  ".U": "88059633\r", 
  ".W": "The peroxisomal oxidation of the long chain fatty acid palmitate (C16:0) and the very long chain fatty acids lignocerate (C24:0) and cerotate (C26:0) was studied in freshly prepared homogenates of cultured skin fibroblasts from control individuals and patients with peroxisomal disorders. The peroxisomal oxidation of the fatty acids is almost completely dependent on the addition of ATP, coenzyme A (CoA), Mg2+ and NAD+. However, the dependency of the oxidation of palmitate on the concentration of the cofactors differs markedly from that of the oxidation of lignocerate and cerotate. The peroxisomal oxidation of all three fatty acid substrates is markedly deficient in fibroblasts from patients with the Zellweger syndrome, the neonatal form of adrenoleukodystrophy and the infantile form of Refsum disease, in accordance with the deficiency of peroxisomes in these patients. In fibroblasts from patients with X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy the peroxisomal oxidation of lignocerate and cerotate is impaired, but not that of palmitate. Competition experiments indicate that in fibroblasts, as in rat liver, distinct enzyme systems are responsible for the oxidation of palmitate on the one hand and lignocerate and cerotate on the other hand. Fractionation studies indicate that in rat liver activation of cerotate and lignocerate to cerotoyl-CoA and lignoceroyl-CoA, respectively, occurs in two subcellular fractions, the endoplasmic reticulum and the peroxisomes but not in the mitochondria. In homogenates of fibroblasts from patients lacking peroxisomes there is a small (25%) but significant deficiency of the ability to activate very long chain fatty acids. This deficient activity of very long chain fatty acyl-CoA synthetase is also observed in fibroblast homogenates from patients with X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy. We conclude that X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy is caused by a deficiency of peroxisomal very long chain fatty acyl-CoA synthetase.\r"

The objective of our study was to define the structure of apo B48 and its relationship to apo B100. Antibodies were produced against 22 synthetic peptides corresponding to sequences in human apo B100. The levels of immunoreactivity of the antipeptides to apo B100 and apo B48 were used to define the structural relationship between these two species of apo B. Six antibodies from sequences in the amino-terminal half of apo B100, including antipeptide 2110-2129, bound to both apo B100 and apo B48. 15 other apo B-specific antipeptides from sequences carboxyl-terminal to residue 2152 bound to apo B100, but not to apo B48. Immunoblots of cyanogen bromide digests of apo B100 and apo B48 with antipeptides 2068-2091 and 2110-2129 detected a 16-KD fragment (residues 2016-2151) in the apo B100 digest and a fragment of identical size in the apo B48 digest. Because apo B48 appears to contain the apo B100 cyanogen bromide fragment 2016-2151 and because an antiserum specific for the peptide 2152-2168 does not bind to apo B48, we conclude that apo B48 represents the amino-terminal 47% of apo B100 and that the carboxyl terminus of apo B48 is in the vicinity of residue 2151 of apo B100.\r"

Varying levels of cAMP were used in these assays to derive both a Vmax and apparent dissociation constant (Kd) for the enzymes in soluble extracts. The cAMP-dependent protein kinase from CF human tracheal epithelial cells has essentially the same Vmax and apparent Kd as non-CF human, bovine, and dog tracheal epithelial cells. Thus, the total activity of the cAMP-dependent kinases and their overall responsiveness to cAMP are unchanged in CF.\r"

Such PTH-like proteins have been proposed as mediators of the hypercalcemia and hypophosphatemia frequently associated with malignancies. We purified to apparent homogeneity a PTH-like protein with a molecular weight of 6,000, that is produced by human renal carcinoma cells. The amino-terminal sequence of the PTH-like protein and that of human PTH were found to display at least five identities in the first 13 positions. The purified protein bound to PTH receptors, activated adenylate cyclase in renal plasma membranes, and stimulated cAMP formation in rat osteosarcoma cells. The PTH-like protein reproduced two additional effects of PTH, stimulation of bone resorption in fetal rat limb bone cultures and inhibition of phosphate uptake in cultured opossum kidney cells. These properties are consistent with a role for PTH-like proteins as mediators of the syndrome of malignancy-associated hypercalcemia.\r"

To test the hypothesis that the duration of the mechanical load more than the magnitude of ventricular hypertrophy may be the inciting stimulus for myocyte nuclei hyperplasia, constriction of the pulmonary artery was produced in rats and the hearts were examined 6 mo later. A 76% increase in right ventricular weight was measured. This hypertrophic response was accompanied by a 41% increase in the total number of myocyte nuclei in the ventricle. Furthermore, average myocyte cell volume per nucleus increased by 28%. No changes in weight, myocyte size, and nuclear number were observed in the left ventricle. In conclusion, myocyte nuclear hyperplasia and cellular hypertrophy both participate to the adaptive response of the right ventricular myocardium in long-standing pressure overload cardiac hypertrophy.\r"

Of the 39 patients with suspected immune deficiency, 13 had confirmed invasive candidiasis and 26 were colonised; of those without signs of immune deficiency, 10 patients also had invasive candidiasis and seven were colonised. Twenty three patients with invasive candidiasis were analysed in total. For suspected immune deficient patients the best discrimination between visceral candidiasis and colonisation was obtained by combining the results of haemagglutination inhibition and arabinitol:creatinine ratio. For patients without signs of immune deficiency the best discrimination between invasive candidiasis and colonisation was achieved with counterimmunoelectrophoresis. The results of the serological tests confirmed the classification on clinical grounds of those with and without immune deficiency.\r"

Only slight chemiluminescence was produced by cells exposed to wollastonites and titanium dioxide. A positive correlation was seen between production of chemiluminescence and red cell haemolysis.

The total number of IgA positive cells was increased in bronchitic and bronchiectatic lungs compared with those from control subjects. The number of IgA2 positive cells was similar in those with bronchitis and bronchiectasis and significantly higher than in controls. Similarly, cells containing IgA1 were increased in the lungs of subjects with chest disease but were higher in those with bronchitis than in those with bronchiectasis. The proportion of IgA2:total IgA containing cells was similar in sections from controls (mean (SD) 25 (5.0)%) and those with bronchiectasis (mean (SD) 24 (4)%), but lower in those with bronchitis (mean (SD) 19 (5.0)%). The results show that cells containing IgA1 predominate in the major bronchi but that the proportion of cells containing IgA2 is higher than in non-mucosal lymphoid tissues. Bronchitis and bronchiectasis are associated with greater numbers of cells producing IgA in the bronchi, and this is consistent with increased local production of IgA in the lung secretions of bronchitic subjects.\r"

The main findings were loss of epidermis associated with extensive dermal oedema, infiltration by polymorphonuclear leucocytes, and disruption of collagen bundles. The presence of micro-organisms at the site of tissue damage was shown and compared with the morphology of the organisms grown in culture. The most commonly identified bacteria were pleomorphic rods whose electron microscopic appearances accorded most closely with Fusobacteria grown in vitro. Spirochaetes, identified ultrastructurally as Treponema sp, were also present. There was no evidence of vasculitis to explain the rapid onset of ulceration, but necrotic changes seen in the dermis and the inflammatory cell infiltrate suggest that, associated with cell necrosis, bacteria previously shown in vitro have an important role in the pathogenesis of tropical ulcers.\r"

Patients with Gram negative bacteraemia had significantly higher values of Ba (median 14.8%) than controls (9.3%) (p less than 0.01), while patients with Gram positive bacteraemia and rheumatoid arthritis had values similar to those of controls (10.1% and 9.5%). The technique proved sensitive and precise, and is suitable for the routine laboratory evaluation of complement activation through the alternative pathway.\r"

ADH was shown to be a sensitive index of liver anoxia due to cardiorespiratory disturbance (clinical sensitivity 90%) and generalised anoxia. GDH exhibited sensitivity equal to that of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) but was inferior to gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT) in the detection of specific liver disease. Both ADH and GDH were sensitive indicators of alcoholic liver disease.\r"

After telephone interviews with an 80% sample of these allegedly photosensitive patients, half of them were considered nonphotosensitive. Thus an estimated prevalence of 5.5% photosensitivity was obtained. Forty-three percent of the light-sensitive patients had a history of polymorphous light eruption with secondary exacerbation of psoriasis lesions. Comparison between the photosensitive and the nonphotosensitive patients concerning background factors and symptoms showed a statistically significant increase (p less than or equal to 0.001) in the photosensitive group concerning skin type I, psoriasis affecting hands, heredity for photosensitivity, and advanced age.\r"

The defined patterns currently encountered in the region emphasize the rarity of local extension of the infection from the bite site. Between 1970 and 1980 we have seen 24 patients with cutaneous leishmaniasis who acquired the infection in Saudi Arabia. In these patients there were several interesting variations from the hitherto described patterns of Oriental sore. The variations include, clinically, the appearance of satellite lesions and the presence of sporotrichoid spread of infection; and histologically, the presence of stellate intradermal abscesses. Such variations in the clinical and pathologic presentations may be due to differences either in the host's immunologic reactivity or in the Leishmania organisms found in Saudi Arabia. Speculative evidence supports the possibility of a different strain and/or species of Leishmania tropica in Saudi Arabia, which in turn may be responsible for this unique clinicopathologic presentation.\r"

This method does not require the use of a fluorescence microscope and gives a very intense stain of the tumor cells. Tumor-containing tissue from 12 patients was stained and included 2 cases of morphealike basal cell carcinoma. All the tumors stained with VM-2 gold. Thus, staining with this technique may be helpful in diagnosing tumors of epithelial origin and may also find application in delineating residual tumor cells in microscopically controlled excision.\r"

Anagen-phase human hairs were plucked from the scalp of healthy individuals; the follicles were separated, plated on coverslips coated with collagen G, and cultivated in McCoy 5A Medium in a CO2-incubator at 37 degrees C. Light and electron microscopy after 1, 2, 3, and 6 weeks showed selective and progressive cell growth with keratinocyte differentiation, producing multilayered cultures of cells joined with fully developed desmosomes. Three distinct patterns of differentiation, leading to the formation of an incomplete horny layer, were seen. The particular arrangement of tonofilaments, the considerable amounts of cytoplasmic glycogen, and the absence of malpighian differentiation were ultrastructural indicators of the follicular origin of the cultured cell population, which most likely grew from the outer root sheath of the hair. This technique may provide a promising model on which to base further studies of hair biologic processes and hair growth.\r"

These deposits were shown to correspond to birefringent red clofazimine crystals on fresh frozen sections.

A pustular lesion developed at first on the anterior aspect of lower part of the left leg. This lesion gradually increased in size and evolved into giant indurated, irregular adjoining plaques. On biopsy, the histologic findings were similar to necrobiosis lipoidica. No human lymphocyte antigen (HLA) class I antigens were detected on peripheral mononuclear cells; however, HLA-DR antigens were present on B lymphocytes. Immunohistochemical studies disclosed defective expression of class I antigens in the non-lesional skin, but positive expression was demonstrated in the lesional area. HLA-DR antigens were expressed on keratinocytes and on most infiltrating inflammatory cells in the affected skin. It is therefore speculated that class I antigen appearance and mononuclear cell infiltrate each induces the other and that together they play an important role in the formation and enlargement of the skin lesion.\r"

Secondary syphilis should thus be considered in the differential diagnosis of nodular lesions resembling lymphoreticular disease.

  ".U": "88060135\r", 
  ".W": "To explore the role of right ventricular hypertrophy and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in the pathogenesis of right ventricular infarction, 27 consecutive patients with a first inferior left ventricular infarction were prospectively studied. Right ventricular infarction was diagnosed using established hemodynamic criteria. Right ventricular hypertrophy was defined as right ventricular free wall thickness greater than or equal to 5 mm. Patients were classified into two groups: Group I patients with right ventricular infarction (n = 15), and Group II patients without right ventricular infarction (n = 12). The ratio of forced expiratory volume over forced vital capacity (FEV1/FVC) and forced expiratory flow between 25 and 75% expired volume (FEF) as a percent of predicted values were significantly reduced in Group I versus Group II (90 +/- 5 versus 105 +/- 6% and 63 +/- 13 versus 103 +/- 15%, respectively; p less than 0.05). This was associated with increased right ventricular wall thickness (Group I 5.5 +/- 0.3 mm versus Group II 3.9 +/- 0.2 mm, p less than 0.001). Multiple logistic regression analysis demonstrated that right ventricular wall thickness was the strongest predictor of right ventricular infarction (p less than 0.0005). No significant difference was found in the site of right coronary occlusion, collateral blood supply or extent of coronary artery disease between the two groups. These findings suggest that right ventricular hypertrophy predisposes patients with acute inferior myocardial infarction to right ventricular infarction independent of the site or extent of coronary artery disease.\r"

  ".W": "Twenty-six patients with dilated cardiomyopathy and angiographically normal coronary arteries, 12 of whom gave a history of anginal chest pain, underwent noninvasive and invasive hemodynamic study. During treadmill exercise testing, patients with a history of angina demonstrated worse effort tolerance (7.4 +/- 4.9 versus 13.6 +/- 5.1 minutes, p less than 0.005) and a lower end-exercise systolic blood pressure-heart rate product (17.9 +/- 3.4 versus 23.6 +/- 4.9 mm Hg.beats/min x 10(3), p less than 0.005) compared with patients without a history of angina. During rapid atrial pacing after ergonovine, 0.15 mg intravenously, 11 of the 12 patients with a history of angina experienced their typical chest pain, in contrast to only 1 of 12 patients without a history of angina. The angina group, compared with the nonangina group, had significantly lower great cardiac vein flow (118 +/- 24 versus 160 +/- 43 ml/min, p less than 0.01), and higher coronary resistance (0.87 +/- 0.21 versus 0.66 +/- 0.25 mm Hg.min/ml, p less than 0.05), significant widening of the arterial--great cardiac vein oxygen difference and a significant fall in cardiac index during pacing. Further, ergonovine resulted in higher coronary resistance during pacing in the angina group compared with pacing alone (+0.16 +/- 0.16 mm Hg min/ml, p less than 0.01), in the absence of significant reduction in epicardial coronary artery luminal diameter. After dipyridamole, 0.5 to 0.75 mg/kg intravenously, to 21 patients, the 7 patients with a history of angina had significantly lower flow (149 +/- 37 versus 218 +/- 73 ml/min, p less than 0.05) and higher coronary resistance (0.59 +/- 0.09 versus 0.43 +/- 0.17 mm Hg.min/ml, p less than 0.05) than did the nonangina group. It is concluded that patients with dilated cardiomyopathy and chest pain unrelated to epicardial coronary artery disease exhibit impaired vasodilator responses to both metabolic and pharmacologic stimuli, and an increased sensitivity to the vasoconstrictor effects of ergonovine. Whether these findings are of etiologic or long-term prognostic significance is unknown.\r"

  ".W": "In 14 patients requiring aggressive therapy for circulatory failure resulting from massive pulmonary embolism, hemodynamic and two-dimensional echocardiographic data were obtained at bedside (acute phase) and again after circulatory improvement (intermediate phase) and during recovery. The acute stage was characterized by a low cardiac output state despite inotropic support (cardiac index 1.9 +/- 0.6 liters/min per m2) associated with increased right atrial pressure (12.4 +/- 4.2 mm Hg), increased right ventricular end-systolic and end-diastolic area (12.4 +/- 3.4 and 15.4 +/- 4.1 cm2/m2, respectively) and reduced right ventricular fractional area contraction (20.1 +/- 8.6%). Two-dimensional echocardiography also revealed interventricular septal flattening at both end-systole and end-diastole and markedly decreased left ventricular end-diastolic dimensions. Left ventricular fractional area contraction remained normal. Hemodynamic improvement occurred during the intermediate phase as shown by restoration of cardiac index (3.3 +/- 0.6 liters/min per m2), decrease in right atrial pressure (8.3 +/- 4.8 mm Hg), reduction in right ventricular end-systolic area (9.0 +/- 3.6 cm2/m2 at the intermediate stage and 6.1 +/- 1.8 cm2/m2 at recovery) and end-diastolic area (10.5 +/- 3.6 cm2/m2 at the intermediate stage and 8.9 +/- 2.9 cm2/m2 at recovery) and improvement in right ventricular fractional area contraction (31.5 +/- 16.4%). The interventricular septum progressively returned to a more normal configuration at both end-systole and end-diastole, and left ventricular diastolic dimension steadily increased. It is concluded that circulatory failure secondary to massive pulmonary embolism was mediated through a profound decrease in left ventricular preload, resulting from both pulmonary outflow obstruction and reduced left ventricular diastolic compliance.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "To evaluate whether histamine exerts a direct effect on coronary hemodynamics in humans, and to investigate the role played by H1 and H2 receptors in this response, intracoronary saline solution or histamine (4 micrograms) was administered in 10 patients with normal coronary arteries during diagnostic cardiac catheterization. Histamine injection was repeated after intravenous cimetidine (400 mg) and diphenhydramine (10 mg). The electrocardiogram, arterial pressure and thermodilution coronary blood flow were continuously monitored during and for 40 seconds after each injection. Immediately after histamine injection there was a significant increase in coronary blood flow (65 +/- 6%) and a decrease in coronary vascular resistance (-40 +/- 3%) (both p less than 0.001), with minor changes in the RR interval and the mean arterial pressure. H2 receptor blockade with cimetidine did not affect these changes, while H1 receptor blockade with diphenhydramine significantly reduced the histamine-induced increase in coronary blood flow and the decrease in coronary vascular resistance (26 +/- 6%, p less than 0.005 and -18 +/- 5%, p less than 0.001, respectively). Twenty to 30 seconds after histamine injection, a significant decrease in mean arterial pressure (-17 +/- 2%, p less than 0.001) and in the RR interval (-4 +/- 1%, p less than 0.01) was observed. These changes persisted after H2 receptor blockade with cimetidine, but were completely abolished after H1 receptor blockade with diphenhydramine. In each case coronary and systemic hemodynamics returned to normal within 40 seconds of the injection.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "To determine the feasibility of detecting cardiovascular disease in a large group of young competitive athletes, a prospective screening evaluation of intercollegiate student athletes was undertaken at the University of Maryland. Initial clinical screening (including personal and family history, physical examination and 12 lead electrocardiogram) was performed in 501 athletes. Ninety of these subjects had positive findings on one or more of the three studies and agreed to further cardiologic evaluation. The vast majority (75 [84%] of 90) had no definitive evidence of cardiovascular disease, although 1 athlete had mild systemic hypertension and 14 (15%) had echocardiographic evidence of relatively mild mitral valve prolapse that had not been previously suspected. In three athletes with relatively mild ventricular septal hypertrophy (14 to 15 mm), it was not possible to discern with absolute certainty whether the wall thickening was a manifestation of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy or secondary to athletic conditioning (\"athlete heart\"). Therefore, this screening protocol identified no athletes with definite evidence of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, Marfan's syndrome or other cardiovascular diseases that convey a significant potential risk for sudden death or disease progression during athletic activity. This failure to identify such diseases could have been due to a lack of sensitivity of the screening tests or to the low frequency with which these diseases occur in youthful healthy athletes. A systematic preparticipation screening program (such as the present one) does not appear to be an efficient means of detecting clinically important cardiovascular disease in young athletes.\r"

  ".W": "During a 14 month period autopsies were performed on 107 patients with coronary heart disease and the results were evaluated prospectively with special reference to right ventricular infarction. A total of 214 regional infarcts were found, 107 (50%) of which involved the right ventricle. Right ventricular infarction was found in 90 hearts (84%), but only three isolated right ventricular infarcts were seen. Right ventricular involvement was found with equal frequency in anterior and posterior infarction (64 versus 66%), but posterior right ventricular infarcts were much larger (15% of the right ventricle was infarcted versus 1%). Proximal right coronary artery occlusion caused larger right ventricular infarction than did distal occlusion (15 versus 5 g). Right ventricular infarct size was not influenced by coronary artery disease (evaluated angiographically) in noninfarct-related vessels. Anterior right ventricular infarcts were predominantly located near the apex of the heart (to the left of the sternum), whereas posterior right ventricular infarcts were located near the atrioventricular groove (along the right sternal border). Infarct size was equal in patients who died from a first acute anterior or posterior infarct. However, posterior infarcts had more right ventricular involvement (28% of total infarct size versus 7% in anterior infarcts) leaving more of the left ventricular myocardium intact (79 versus 64%). These differences in infarct topography may explain why right ventricular involvement seldom is diagnosed clinically in patients with anterior infarction, and why left ventricular function and prognosis usually are better after posterior compared with anterior infarcts of enzymatically equal size.\r"

Plexogenic pulmonary arteriopathy was present in 10 patients, 7 of whom had coexistent thromboembolic lesions. One patient had isolated medial hypertrophy, which may be an early stage in the plexogenic category, whereas isolated thromboembolic pulmonary vascular disease was observed in one subject. Hepatic disease was consistent with alcoholic cirrhosis in seven patients, cryptogenic cirrhosis in four and extrahepatic portal hypertension without cirrhosis in one. Thrombocytopenia was present in all 10 patients whose platelet count was determined. This study suggests that pulmonary hypertension associated with portal hypertension commonly has a plexogenic appearance on histologic examination. However, thrombosis (whether embolic or in situ) may also contribute to vascular obstruction.\r"

  ".W": "In each heart taken from autopsies of 14 men with idiopathic hemochromatosis, the conduction system, atria and 10 sites in the ventricles were histologically graded for stainable iron. Stainable iron was exclusively sarcoplasmic; none was observed in the interstitium. The histologic grade for the same anatomic site varied among hearts and among different anatomic sites in the same heart. Ten hearts had stainable iron in all ventricular sites; one of the three hearts from patients who had undergone therapeutic phlebotomy had no iron at any site. Seven hearts had iron in the atria but at a lesser grade than that found in the ventricles; six hearts had mild focal iron deposition in the atrioventricular conduction system. None of the 14 hearts had stainable iron in the sinus node. Elemental iron was quantitated by atomic absorption spectroscopy in ventricular specimens contiguous to those studied histologically and also in age-matched control hearts. Elemental iron content was markedly increased in hearts with idiopathic hemochromatosis compared with control hearts (p less than 0.01). The quantity of elemental iron varied greatly, similar to stainable iron, but was highest subepicardially. Among the hearts from the 11 patients without prior phlebotomy, three had no stainable iron in the right ventricular septal subendocardium, suggesting that sampling error may be a problem in the evaluation of hemochromatosis by endomyocardial biopsy. The sarcoplasmic location of the iron indicates that cardiac involvement in idiopathic hemochromatosis represents a storage disease and not an infiltrative process; this finding is consistent with the normal ventricular wall thicknesses observed.\r"

  ".U": "88060144\r", 
  ".W": "Although ventricular fibrillation is a well known sequel to atrial fibrillation in the Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome, ventricular fibrillation is not generally associated with supraventricular tachycardia in the presence of enhanced atrioventricular (AV) node conduction without pre-excitation. It was hypothesized that the ventricular response during atrial fibrillation may be less in patients with enhanced AV node conduction than in their counterparts with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome matched for anterograde effective refractory period. Slower ventricular rates during atrial fibrillation would suggest an increased propensity for concealed conduction in the enhanced AV node conduction group than in the group with an accessory pathway. Three groups of patients aged 16 to 65 years underwent electrophysiologic testing for supraventricular tachycardia or after surgical correction of Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome. Sixteen patients had enhanced AV node conduction, 16 had Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome and 16 had normal AV node conduction. Patients with enhanced AV node conduction and Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome were well matched for anterograde effective refractory period (245 +/- 22 versus 258 +/- 25 ms) and minimal cycle length, maintaining 1:1 anterograde conduction (261 +/- 21 versus 260 +/- 40). There was no difference in intervals during atrial fibrillation (average RR interval = 372 +/- 37 versus 346 +/- 66) or shortest RR interval (266 +/- 27 versus 243 +/- 51). Thus, patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome and those with enhanced AV node conduction matched for anterograde refractory period exhibit similar ventricular rates during atrial fibrillation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".U": "88060146\r", 
  ".W": "Head-out water immersion is known to produce several cardiopulmonary adjustments at rest due to a cephalad shift in blood volume. The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of head-out water immersion on the cardiorespiratory response to graded dynamic exercise. Nineteen healthy middle-aged men performed upright cycling exercise at 40, 60 and 80% of maximal oxygen consumption on land and in water (31.0 +/- 1.0 degrees C) to the shoulders. Cardiac output (measured by the carbon dioxide rebreathing technique) was significantly greater in water at 40 and 80% maximal oxygen consumption. Stroke volume was significantly elevated at all stages of exercise. Heart rate did not differ significantly at 40 and 60% maximal oxygen consumption but was significantly lower in water at 80% maximal oxygen consumption. Total ventilation did not differ significantly in water and on land at any stage of exercise. The results suggest that the central redistribution of blood volume with head-out water immersion leads to an increase in stroke volume. Because there is not a proportional decrease in heart rate with the elevated stroke volume, cardiac output is regulated at a higher level during upright exercise in water compared with that on land. In conclusion, there are serious limitations of available, prerecorded rhythm data bases for designing and testing of automatic external defibrillators. Performance can be adequately assessed only by extensive clinical tests, which seem mandatory for this new and important type of defibrillator.\r"

The sensitivity for correctly classifying ventricular fibrillation and ventricular tachycardia was substantially less during clinical testing in 298 patients than would have been predicted from preclinical results: 52% of ventricular fibrillation analyses in patients were correctly classified versus 88% of episodes in the data base, and 22 versus 86%, respectively, for ventricular tachycardia (p less than 0.001). The detection algorithm was modified and evaluated further in another 322 patients. The modified detector performed substantially better than did the one that had been designed from prerecorded rhythms: with its use, 118 (94%) of 125 patients in ventricular fibrillation were counter-shocked compared with 91 (77%) of 118 similar patients with use of the initial algorithm (p less than 0.001). No inappropriate shocks were delivered. This improvement resulted in a shorter time to first shock (p less than 0.01) and more shocks being delivered for persistent or recurrent episodes of ventricular fibrillation (p less than 0.05). Of 620 patients treated with the automatic defibrillator, 243 (39%) had ventricular fibrillation; 57 (23%) of the 243 regained pulse and blood pressure before paramedics arrived, 141 (58%) were admitted to hospital and 71 (29%) were discharged.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "This study describes the electrophysiologic effects of the Mustard repair of d-transposition of the great arteries on the sinus node and on conduction and refractoriness in the atrium, atrioventricular (AV) node and ventricle. Seventy-two electrophysiologic studies were performed on 64 patients after the Mustard operation. Standard rest and 24 hour ambulatory electrocardiograms were evaluated. Catheter endocardial atrial mapping, available in 67 of the 72 studies, revealed that sinus rhythm was present in the atria in 33 patients, ectopic atrial rhythm in 26 and junctional rhythm in 8. Intraatrial conduction delays with very late activation of the low medial, low lateral or low right atrium at the AV junction were present in 53 of 59 patients with atrial or sinus rhythm. Sinus node function was normal in only nine patients. Prolonged refractory periods were found in the right atrial portion of the new right atrium when compared with the left atrial portion of the new right atrium. Forty-one percent of the patients had prolongation of atrial refractoriness with shortening of the paced cycle lengths. Fifty-one percent developed sustained intraatrial reentry with programmed atrial stimulation. Forty-eight percent of these patients with inducible atrial tachycardia have since developed clinical episodes of atrial flutter. In summary, electrophysiologic studies revealed significant abnormalities of sinus node function and atrial conduction and refractoriness. Alone or in combination, these abnormalities, which result in severe bradycardia or rapid atrial arrhythmias, may lead to sudden death. The Jatene or arterial switch procedure may provide an appropriate alternative operation in this group of patients.\r"

The morphologically right ventricle, however, was left-sided and the ventricular mass was of left-hand topology (l loop) rather than the expected right-hand pattern (d loop).

Rather than the anticipated left-hand topology (l loop), the ventricular mass was arranged in right-hand fashion (d loop) and the morphologically right ventricle was right-sided.

This study examines the effects of blood pressure on left ventricular diastolic filling indexes measured by Doppler ultrasound technique in 47 young normotensive adolescents (mean age 13 years). Left ventricular filling was assessed by Doppler peak early and late diastolic transmitral flow velocities, early and late diastolic flow velocity integrals and early diastolic deceleration. Systolic blood pressure did not correlate with any of the Doppler filling indexes, although it was related to echocardiographic left ventricular mass (r = 0.44, p less than 0.005). Diastolic blood pressure did not correlate with left ventricular mass; however, it was inversely related to peak early diastolic flow velocity (r = -0.44, p less than 0.005), early diastolic flow velocity integral (r = -0.40, p less than 0.01) and early diastolic deceleration (r = -0.32, p less than 0.05). The ratio of late to early peak filling (A/E) was directly related to diastolic blood pressure (r = 0.48, p less than 0.001). Examination of electrocardiograms showed that there was a stronger correlation between A/E ratio and diastolic blood pressure (r = 0.63) in 22 subjects with bimodal P waves in lead V1 than in subjects with unimodal P waves (r = 0.45).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Long-term therapy with oral sympathomimetic amines in patients with heart failure has been limited by the eventual development of diminished pharmacologic efficacy. However, a previous investigation in five subjects with heart failure suggested that long-term ingestion of levodopa, which is decarboxylated endogenously to dopamine, produces a sustained improvement in cardiac function. In the present study, levodopa was administered orally (1.5 to 2.0 g) to 14 patients with heart failure while hemodynamic responses and plasma catecholamines were monitored. Initially, an increase in cardiac index and stroke volume index was accompanied by a decline in systemic vascular resistance, mean pulmonary capillary wedge pressure and mean right atrial pressure. Heart rate and mean arterial pressure were unchanged. Plasma concentrations of dopamine rose substantially after drug ingestion and correlated significantly with changes in cardiac index (r = 0.73, p less than 0.05). After 12 weeks of treatment with levodopa, the changes in cardiac index, stroke volume index, systemic vascular resistance and plasma dopamine levels persisted (n = 12 patients). Moreover, a significant decrease occurred in the heart rate at rest. Although there was an initial tendency for plasma norepinephrine concentrations to increase, a return to control levels was documented after long-term treatment. Thus, tolerance to the hemodynamic actions of levodopa did not develop during long-term administration of the drug. The hemodynamic responses observed can be ascribed to the activation of beta 1-adrenoceptors and dopamine1 receptors by dopamine generated from levodopa. The dopamine2 activity of dopamine does not appear to be responsible for the improvement in cardiac performance produced by levodopa.\r"

Arterial and coronary sinus catecholamines were measured only before and 50 minutes after milrinone. Left ventricular pressure, volume (as determined by angiography) and derived indexes were simultaneously assessed at matched atrial paced heart rate before and 60 minutes after milrinone. Three patients who did not achieve a therapeutic plasma level (less than 150 ng/ml) were excluded. Peak negative first derivative of left ventricular pressure (-dP/dt) progressively and significantly increased (10%) together with a decrease in the two exponential time constants of relaxation, namely, Tau 1 (19%) and Tau 2 (22%), which represent the fit for and after the first 40 ms, respectively. Coronary flow significantly increased by 43% within 30 minutes, whereas the decrease (-13%) in coronary vascular resistance failed to be statistically significant. No change occurred in catecholamine concentrations after milrinone. Peak filling rate significantly increased by 15%. Pressure-volume curves showed a leftward and, in four patients, a downward shift; a significant decrease in minimal left ventricular diastolic and end-diastolic pressures (by 55 and 38%, respectively) and in end-diastolic volume (18%) occurred. The constant of elastic chamber stiffness measured by the simple elastic model tended to decrease, but failed to achieve a statistically significant level. Thus, oral milrinone improved left ventricular early relaxation and filling as well as chamber distensibility. This global improvement of diastolic function makes milrinone a potentially useful drug in the oral treatment of heart failure.\r"

  ".W": "In an effort to standardize and evaluate the performance of electrocardiographic computer measurement programs, a 15 lead reference library has been developed based on simultaneously recorded standard 12 lead and orthogonal XYZ lead data. A set of 250 electrocardiograms (ECGs) with selected abnormalities was analyzed by a group of five referee cardiologists and 11 different 12 lead and 6 XYZ computer programs. Attention was focused on the exact determination of the onsets and offsets of P, QRS and T waves. The referees performed their task on highly amplified, selected complexes from the library in a two round process. Median results of the referees coincided best with the median derived from all programs. An analysis of stability proved that the combined program median was a robust reference. However, some individual program results were widely divergent. Paired t tests demonstrated earlier onset for P and QRS (p less than 0.001), as well as later offset for P and T waves in the median 12 lead than in the XYZ results. Significant differences also existed among results obtained by programs analyzing all standard ECG leads at one time, the so-called multilead programs, and those obtained by the conventional standard three lead analysis programs. As a consequence, the derived P, PR, QRS and QT interval measurements varied quite widely among the various programs. Significant differences were also observed among measurements of Q, R and S duration. Some programs showed Q waves that were on the average 6 ms (p less than 0.001) longer than those of others. This may significantly influence diagnostic performance.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".U": "88060156\r", 
  ".W": "Ultrastructural studies of the extracellular collagen matrix were made on the \"stunned\" myocardium using scanning, conventional and high voltage transmission electron microscopy and light microscopy. Regional myocardial dysfunction was produced by 12 sequential 5 minute occlusions of the left anterior descending coronary artery, separated by 10 minute intervals of reperfusion. A final 90 minute reperfusion period documented persistent myocardial dysfunction. At the end of the final reperfusion period, the percent systolic shortening, measured by sonomicrometers, was depressed significantly to 35 +/- 9% of baseline. The heart was then perfusion fixed, and samples were taken from both control and stunned areas. No changes associated with irreversible cellular damage were noted in the stunned region. However, scanning electron microscopy of the stunned area showed that the extracellular collagen matrix underwent profound structural changes. Collagen cables were roughened, uncoiled and discontinuous. Linear grooves on the surface of the myocytes were frequently seen, indicating complete loss of collagen cables. The usual dense collagen weave surrounding myocytes became patchy or absent. Myocyte to myocyte struts were sparse and frequently absent, with remnant nodular or nublike structures indicative of breakage. High voltage electron microscopy of the stunned area showed that the collagen struts were discontinuous and vacuolated with rounded tips. Light microscopy of silver-stained sections of the stunned tissue demonstrated large patchy areas that were devoid of silver, indicating absence of the collagen matrix. There was a progressive increase in percent systolic bulging during each sequential coronary occlusion, suggesting increasing myocardial compliance. These results indicate that the myocardial collagen matrix is severely damaged from reversible ischemic cell injury. The greater myocardial compliance and less effective contractile effort in the stunned myocardium might be explained on a structural basis: disruption of the mechanical coupling function provided by the extracellular collagen matrix.\r"

  ".W": "The hypothesis whether localized ventricular tachycardia could be ablated by myocardial necrosis induced with chemical agents injected into a coronary artery was tested. In 59 anesthetized dogs, a diagonal branch of the left anterior descending coronary artery was cannulated either occlusively or nonocclusively. Localized ventricular tachycardia was induced by injecting approximately 0.01 ml of 30 micrograms/ml of aconitine solution into the left ventricular wall perfused by the cannulated diagonal branch in 54 dogs. In eight untreated control dogs, aconitine-induced ventricular tachycardia lasted 10.2 +/- 2.3 minutes or degenerated into ventricular fibrillation after 7.0 +/- 4.0 minutes. In the remaining 46 dogs, 1 ml of saline solution, 25, 50 or 100% ethyl alcohol or 0.94 ml (mean [range 0.4 to 2.0]) of 25% phenol at room temperature was injected into the occluded coronary artery and 1 ml of 100% ethyl alcohol at body temperature was injected into the nonoccluded coronary artery. Ventricular tachycardia was eliminated in 9 (82%) of 11 dogs receiving phenol, 7 (88%) of 8 dogs receiving 100% ethyl alcohol occlusively, 6 (75%) of 8 dogs receiving 100% ethyl alcohol nonocclusively and 6 (67%) of 9 dogs receiving 50% ethyl alcohol for an entire follow-up period of 10 to 60 minutes. However, saline solution and 25% ethyl alcohol suppressed ventricular tachycardia only transiently in 8 (53%) of 15 and 3 (60%) of 5 dogs, respectively. Left ventricular end-diastolic pressure rose from 8.0 to 11.2 mm Hg (p less than 0.05) immediately after injection of 100% ethyl alcohol in seven dogs.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Electrical catheter ablation of arrhythmogenic sites is a new therapy for ventricular tachycardia that is still being investigated. Recent studies have shown, however, that the procedure itself can provoke serious ventricular arrhythmias. The incidence, course and mechanism of these arrhythmias were studied in 10 beagles treated with a single R wave-synchronized cathodal shock delivered to the endocardial ventricular wall (5 dogs left ventricular, 5 dogs right ventricular). Shocks were delivered at 30 (four dogs), 80 (two dogs) or 250 J (four dogs). Each dog underwent programmed electrical stimulation at or near the ablation site before, within 1 hour after and 1 week after the shock. Holter electrocardiographic monitoring (24 hours) was performed during day 1 and 7 after the shock in all the dogs, and extended Holter monitoring was done during the first 5 days in four dogs. All dogs survived for 1 week. Within 10 minutes after the shock, a sustained ventricular tachycardia was recorded in nine dogs; deterioration into ventricular fibrillation occurred in two dogs. In nine dogs, 60 to 169 monomorphic ventricular tachycardia episodes (mean 101) occurred on day 1 and 0 to 11 (mean 3) occurred on day 7; Holter monitoring failed for technical reasons in one dog. Extended Holter monitoring showed a marked decline in the incidence of tachycardia during the first 3 days. Early activation during ventricular tachycardia was always derived at or near the ablation site, and the QRS configuration during pre- and postablation pacing at this site was identical to the tachycardia configuration. Ventricular tachycardia was never inducible with programmed stimulation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Ab levels declined toward a basal level just before, and increased just after, the grass-pollination season, returning to the same basal level just before the next grass-pollination season. The least complex allergen, Lol II, demonstrated the most uniform pattern of variation in both IgE and IgG Ab levels. Total serum IgE levels demonstrated the least regular pattern of variation. Grass-pollen counts were strongly correlated with symptom-medication scores for these subjects (rs = 0.87). Initial values were correlated with the rise in total IgE and IgE Ab to Lol II across the grass-pollen season. Skin test results were correlated with initial IgE Ab levels for L. perenne pollen extract and Lol II. Finally, a procedure for correcting IgE Ab levels to basal values was proposed and tested. The correction procedure, for each IgE Ab, was based on the average rise during the grass-pollination season (or average decline after the grass-pollination season) observed for all subjects with that IgE Ab.\r"

The eight allergens were house dust, cat, dog, Alternaria, mixed giant/short ragweed, oak, perennial ryegrass, and Bermuda grass. Skin test reactivity was defined as a mean erythema diameter greater than or equal to 10.5 mm at the 20-minute reading. Overall, 20.2% of the participants reacted to at least one allergen. Peak reactivity occurred in the 12 to 24-year-old age group. Reactivity was higher in blacks versus whites, but the difference did not reach statistical significance (23.2% versus 19.8%; p greater than 0.05). Male participants had an increased prevalence of reactivity versus female participants in whites (22.0% versus 17.6%), but not in blacks (23.2% versus 23.3%). Skin test reactivity increased in both whites and blacks with increasing income and education. The prevalence of skin test reactivity was higher in urban versus rural areas, but the difference was statistically significant only for whites (whites, 21.6% versus 16.4%; blacks, 23.8% versus 18.4%; p greater than 0.05). With logistic regression, the most important predictors of skin test reactivity in whites were age, sex, urban residence, and poverty status. In blacks, the most important predictors were age, urban residence, and poverty status.\r"

  ".W": "We have examined the in vivo airway responsiveness to leukotriene (LT) D4 in 11 patients without asthma who were to undergo thoracotomy and compared this responsiveness with in vitro sensitivity and in vitro contractility of bronchial smooth muscle to LTD4. In vivo responses were measured by the provocation concentration producing a 10% fall in FEV1, a 30% fall in partial flow rate at 30% of total lung capacity from a partial forced expiratory maneuver, and a 35% fall in specific airway conductance. In vitro sensitivity was measured as the concentration of LTD4 producing a 50% of maximum contraction and maximum-induced tension. The smooth muscle content of the bronchial strip was estimated microscopically, and the absolute quantity of muscle strip was compared with the maximum tension generated by that bronchial smooth muscle sample. In vivo results varied over 2 log units, and in vitro sensitivity, over 1 log unit. The absolute amount of smooth muscle present in bronchial strips correlated with maximal LTD4-induced tension. There was no relationship between in vivo responsiveness and in vitro sensitivity nor between in vivo responsiveness and maximum tension generated, even when this was corrected for the proportion of smooth muscle present in each bronchial strip. These results suggest that in vivo airway responsiveness to LTD4 is not determined by airway smooth muscle sensitivity or its ability to generate tension alone. Other factors must be influencing the response of the airway to LTD4. Nevertheless, the finding of a positive correlation between the absolute amount of smooth muscle present in bronchial strips and maximal LTD4-induced tension suggests that hypertrophy and/or hyperplasia of airway smooth muscle may contribute to in vivo airway hyperresponsiveness.\r"

Although the mechanism of ARs to iodinated radiographic contrast media is not IgE mediated, because of widespread use of beta-adrenergic blocking agents, we undertook a prospective study to determine the incidence of AR to radiographic contrast media during cardiac angiography. Nine hundred fifty-two consecutive patients were divided into four groups according to concomitant chronic medications. Group I (447 patients) were receiving no beta-adrenergic blocking agents or calcium antagonists. Group II (216 patients) were receiving a beta-adrenergic blocking agent. Group III (147 patients) were receiving a calcium antagonist but not a beta-adrenergic blocking agent. Group IV (142 patients) were receiving both a calcium antagonist and a beta-adrenergic blocking agent. The reaction rates, respectively, in the four groups were 4.47%, 7.41%, 5.44%, and 4.93%. The rates of ARs were not associated with the use of concomitant medications in any of the groups (chi 2 = 2.531; p = 0.47). The probability of a type II error in comparison of groups I and II was 0.75 should the true incidence of reactions in patients receiving beta-adrenergic antagonists be 7.41%. No difference in the incidence of AR was observed between patients taking selective and nonselective beta-adrenergic blocking agents in group II. Specific ARs occurring in patients receiving beta-adrenergic blocking agents were usually mild and often without need for specific pharmacotherapy.\r"

Individuals were categorized as either atopic or nonatopic on the basis of history and skin test reactivity to common inhalant allergens. Most (28/33) shrimp-sensitive subjects had positive skin prick tests to shrimp extract, whereas skin tests were negative in 27/29 control subjects. Eighty-one percent of atopic and 41% of nonatopic shrimp-sensitive subjects had elevated shrimp-RAST ratios. The RAST ratios of atopic individuals were significantly higher than ratios of nonatopic individuals, and there was a significant correlation between shrimp-RAST ratios and historical clinical symptom scores. RAST determinations of all control subjects were negative. Shrimp-sensitive subjects also had significantly elevated serum levels of shrimp-specific IgG and IgA as compared to control individuals. Both IgG and IgA shrimp-specific reactivity demonstrated a significant positive correlation with shrimp-RAST ratios. These studies indicate that IgE-mediated, type I mechanisms, detected by positive shrimp skin tests and RASTs, appear to be operative in crustacea-sensitive individuals, particularly those with concurrent respiratory allergy. Although the role of shrimp-specific IgG and IgA antibodies in the immunopathogenesis of crustacea allergy remains unclear, such antibodies appear to represent increased immunologic recognition of shrimp allergens/antigens in shrimp-sensitive subjects.\r"

Each subject received single doses of a reference theophylline solution in addition to single and multiple doses of Uniphyl, a \"once-a-day\" theophylline formulation, administered after an overnight fast and after a large breakfast. Extent of absorption was similar during single and multiple dosing but was significantly greater when dose was taken after breakfast; 68 +/- 7% (mean +/- SEM) and 61 +/- 4% of administered doses were absorbed during single and multiple dosing, respectively, when breakfast was withheld, whereas 83 +/- 4% and 86 +/- 4% of administered doses were absorbed when single and multiple doses, respectively, followed breakfast. Observed mean serum concentrations during multiple dosing approximated values predicted from the single-dose study; mean peak serum concentrations averaged more than twice the tough for both predicted and observed values after both fasting and postprandial administration. These data demonstrate incomplete absorption of theophylline from Uniphyl with greater extent of absorption when Uniphyl is taken after food. The study also provides further documentation that characterization of rate and extent of absorption from single doses permit prediction of the mean serum concentration-time profile during multiple dosing at defined rates of theophylline elimination. This provides the potential to anticipate fluctuations in serum concentrations at clinically relevant elimination rates that deviate from the mean of samples typically used for study.\r"

  ".W": "We evaluated allergen bronchial challenge tests (ABCTs) variability and reproducibility during 2-week intervals, respectively, in 28 and 14 Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus-sensitized patients. Increasing doses of Dpt (1.25 to 160 X 10(-3) mg) of lyophilized Dpt extract were administered at 20-minute intervals by doubling the previous dose. Dose-response curves (D-RC) were constructed for each test with the logarithm (base 2) of the allergen dose and the FEV1 in milliliters as ordinate. We analyzed different indices: the allergen doses causing a 15% decrease in FEV1 (PD15) and a 20% decrease in FEV1 (PD20), the slope of the curve beyond PD15, the overall slope, and the area under the parabolic curve. We found considerable intersubject variability in early asthmatic responses to Dpt ABCTs. Bronchoconstriction induced by allergen produced a specific D-RC for each individual. PD20 was significantly correlated with all the indices representing the whole D-RC (i.e., overall slope and area); moreover, PD20 was found on the steepest portion of the curve in 24 of 28 D-RCs. With the methodology used, we obtained a satisfactory reproducibility in a 2-week interval: the linear slope obtained by log base 2 transformation of doses was highly reproducible (p less than 0.001), as was area p under the parabolic curve. PD20 is significantly reproducible in a range of one doubling dose (twofold variation). The reproducibility of ABCTs over a short period permits solid arguments for their use in the evaluation of prophylactic treatment and in clinical research.\r"

  ".W": "This study reports the clinical and immunologic responses of 29 patients who were observed during a prolonged period after insect-sting anaphylaxis without venom immunotherapy. At the time of their initial evaluation, all patients had venom-specific IgE, detected by skin test or RAST. Their mean age was 21 years; 16 patients were 16 years of age or less. There were 18 male and 11 female patients. Eleven patients had urticaria and angioedema as their only symptoms of anaphylaxis, and 18 patients had respiratory and/or cardiovascular symptoms. Reassessment was done 5 or more years after the initial evaluation. The average time at reevaluation was 10.1 years after the initial sting reaction. There had been 25 re-stings in 17 patients, with three systemic reactions occurring in two patients, an overall reaction rate of 12%. The time interval between the initial sting reaction and the follow-up sting was 2 to 14 years, mean 7.3 years. In patients with initial urticaria/angioedema symptoms only, there were 11 re-stings with no reactions. In patients with initial cardiovascular/respiratory symptoms, there were 14 re-stings with three reactions. At the time of follow-up evaluation, venom-specific IgE had generally decreased. In six of 25 patients, venom skin tests became negative, and in eight of 24 patients, the RAST became negative. These observations suggest that in many patients, stinging insect allergy is a self-limited process, with loss of clinical sensitivity and immunologic reactivity.\r"

The patient, the child of a woman with HIE, had elevated cord blood IgE. In early infancy, she had cutaneous colonization with S. aureus followed by frank impetiginous lesions. Anti-S. aureus IgE was easily detected with a highly specific ELISA assay at 2 years of age (2 years before her presentation with a S. aureus subcutaneous abscess). Thus, the measurement of anti-S. aureus IgE by this technique may be a useful laboratory test for the diagnosis of HIE before the appearance of a severe infection.\r"

Validated questionnaires were mailed to a random sample of 376 health care administrators and 154 dietetic educators from various types of educational programs. Each questionnaire included 57 competencies representing the following areas: financial, technical, personnel management, nutrition services, production, and marketing. Health care administrators were asked to rate the degree of importance for each competency. Dietetic educators assessed the degree to which each competency was addressed in their curriculums. Of the 288 returned questionnaires, 243 contained usable data. Health care administrators' mean ratings were compared with dietetic educators' mean ratings. Significant differences were noted in 44 of the 57 competencies. Dietetic educators placed significantly greater emphasis on competencies related to nutrition services and significantly less on financial competencies than did health care administrators. Significant differences also were observed for selected competencies classified as technical and production. Results indicated that dietetic educators must continually evaluate curriculums and respond to the changing needs of the health care industry.\r"

The next most important source of sodium (24%) was a category made up of food adjuncts, snack-type foods, soups, and beverages. The largest proportion of sodium in most foods had been added during food manufacture or preparation. Salt added at the table contributed less than 1% of the sodium in the diets of the teenagers. All students did not eat foods from all categories on their day of recording; 70% or more ate bakery products, dairy foods, food adjuncts, and meat, fish, poultry, and eggs. Changes in recipe formulations can decrease sodium content for a variety of bakery products, cereals, mixed dishes, snack-type foods, soups, and processed meats. It is therefore possible to make large reductions in dietary sodium without disturbing other nutrient values.\r"

Dietary intake data were collected using the recall method for 1 weekday during the summer when athletes participated in unsupervised, informal conditioning. Subjects were grouped by age as junior high (JR-HI: 12 to 14 years) or senior high (SR-HI: 15 to 18 years) students. Absolute mean energy and nutrient intakes, except for vitamin A, were statistically greater for SR-HI relative to JR-HI (p less than .02). These findings are consistent with age-related growth on nutritional intake. Mean nutritional intakes from food sources for SR-HI met or exceeded the RDAs. For JR-HI, mean intakes met or exceeded the RDAs except for energy (94% RDA) and zinc (87% RDA). Mean intakes exceeded those of a representative sample of same-age boys in the larger American population.\r"

Instruments developed for the study were completed by varsity athletes (no. = 70) and students not on teams (no. = 129). The two groups were similar in education, but the athletes were younger, taller, and heavier than the students and were considerably more active. The athletes used more nutritional supplements (especially iron) and were less likely to exclude red meat from their diet than were students. Scores on the knowledge test (which had a possible range of - 100% to 100%) averaged 34% for both team members and students. Both groups scored higher on general nutrition questions than on questions about nutrition in relation to activity. Among students, age, education, dietary pattern, total number of nutrition information sources, and length of time an activity program had been maintained were positively associated with nutrition knowledge. Those relationships were not detected among varsity athletes. It was concluded that female varsity athletes had levels of both general and sports-related nutrition knowledge that were similar to those of female students not participating on varsity teams.\r"

Data compiled from national food balance sheets indicate that per capita energy supplies increased by 14% during the past two decades. The number of undernourished is estimated for the periods 1969 to 1971 and 1979 to 1981 on the basis of a distribution of population food intakes and two alternative estimates of minimal energy requirements. The survey findings indicate that the proportion of undernourished in the developing market economies decreased, although an estimated 335 million to 494 million people fall in this category. In the least developed countries, the proportion of undernourished increased during this period. Elimination of poverty, the fundamental cause of malnutrition, through increased economic and agricultural development, is regarded as the only long-term solution to malnutrition. Short-term solutions are also needed to address interim needs and the diverse environmental, social, and cultural factors implicated in the causation of malnutrition. Short-term solutions include nutrition programs, complementary health measures, food subsidies, population programs, and programs aimed at improving the status of women. Projected future food needs in developing countries also indicate the need for increased international food trade and expanded foreign aid.\r"

Although this recommendation is appropriate for the majority of clients, some persons are prone to form phytobezoars and should not add certain kinds of fiber to the diet. The phytobezoar is a compact mass of fibers, skins, seeds, leaves, roots, or stems of plants that collects in the stomach or small intestine. Other food particles, such as fats, crystals, granules, fibers, and residues of salts, are incorporated into the mass and contribute to the growth of the bezoar. Clients who have undergone surgical procedures for peptic ulcer disease or stomach cancer or who for other reasons, such as diabetic gastroparesis, have a loss of normal pyloric function and decreased gastric acidity are prone to form phytobezoars. Once formed, the bezoar can be disintegrated through surgery, by the use of the Water Pik and enzymes during endoscopy, or by treatment with metoclopramide. The dietitian should advise such clients to avoid identified foods that lead to phytobezoar formation--oranges, persimmons, coconuts, berries, green beans, figs, apples, sauerkraut, brussels sprouts, and potato peel.\r"

It was hypothesized that there would be a wide variation in physicians' knowledge of dementing disorders and the procedures used to diagnose these disorders. To quantitate the present status of primary care physicians' knowledge of dementing disorders and to investigate possible relationships between this knowledge and different physician and practice characteristics, 50 general internists and family practitioners from Winnebago County, Illinois, were interviewed regarding their recall of causes of dementia, procedures used in diagnosing these diseases, treatment recommendations, and comfort in making a differential diagnosis. Results revealed a wide variation in both physicians' familiarity with the causes of dementia as well as the procedures used in making the diagnosis. Although a majority (80%) of the physicians reported some degree of confidence in making a differential diagnosis of dementing disorders, a significant trend was found between physician age and comfort in making the diagnosis, with age being directly correlated with comfort. This was in spite of a significant negative association between physician age and immediate recall of causes of dementia. These data imply that younger physicians are entering the work force with at least better immediate recall of information on dementing disorders, but they have had little opportunity to become comfortable with that knowledge due to a generally smaller geriatric population in their practice.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "In order to examine the relative frequency of urinary tract infection (UTI) and bacteriuria among male nursing home patients managed with and without external catheters (EC), we prospectively followed four cohorts of patients (EC worn continuously, N = 30; EC worn at night only, N = 19; incontinent without catheter, N = 13; and continent, N = 30) for a total of 497 patient months at risk. The proportion of patients with EC worn continuously who had at least one episode of bacteriuria (87%) and at least one UTI (40%), and the incidence of UTI (0.08 episodes per patient-month at risk) was significantly higher than among continent or incontinent patients without EC. Patients with EC at night only had an intermediate frequency of these findings. Differences in clinical and functional status characteristics among the four cohorts, in addition to the use of EC, could have contributed to the higher frequencies of bacteriuria and UTI. None of the clinical characteristics we examined were associated with the development of UTI among patients with EC. Further studies are necessary to identify factors associated with UTI among patients who are managed by EC so that effective preventive strategies can be developed and targeted to patients at high risk.\r"

  ".W": "Seventy-five patients, 75 years of age and over, experienced recurrent syncope, with the etiology remaining unclear but presumably cardiogenic, after cardiac and neurologic examinations and noninvasive laboratory testing (including an electrocardiogram and ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring). The mean number of previous syncopal spells was 14 (range, 1 to 64) over a mean of 36 months (range, 1 to 480 months). These patients underwent invasive electrophysiologic testing and a potential cause for syncope was identified in 68%. Abnormal findings at electrophysiologic testing included: sinus node dysfunction (55%); abnormal His-bundle conduction (39%); and ventricular tachycardia (14%), with some patients having more than one abnormality. No major complications were associated with the electrophysiologic testing. Patients were subsequently treated with permanent cardiac pacing or antiarrhythmic drugs or both, depending upon results of the electrophysiologic study. Follow-up examinations (mean of 26 months; range, 1 to 70) were possible in 90% of patients. No further syncope occurred in 84% of patients with an abnormal electrophysiologic study who received subsequent therapy to prevent the identified abnormality. Thus, in this difficult group of patients with recurrent syncope of uncertain etiology, electrophysiologic testing was safe and indicated abnormalities of conduction or rhythm in 68% of patients; treatment to correct these abnormalities prevented recurrent syncope in 84%.\r"

Both geometric and algebraic approaches are used to demonstrate that although step-wise procedures pose little difficulty if predictors are orthogonal, these same procedures, when used with correlated predictors, can lead to poor tests of the predictor regression weights. Techniques that are useful in the detection of multicollinearity are discussed. Principal components regression, ridge regression, and hierarchical regression are evaluated as potential techniques for assessing the relative importance of predictors when these variables are correlated, as is common in aging research. Hierarchical regression is the most recommended technique in that it is theory-driven rather than dependent on empirical relations that may be sample-specific and unstable.\r"

The purpose of this study was to demonstrate that social support operates by bolstering internal locus of control beliefs. Data from a longitudinal study of older adults suggest that the relationship between support and perceived control is nonlinear. Increases in social support tend to increase feelings of control, but only up to a certain threshold. Beyond this point, additional support tends to decrease feelings of personal control. This nonlinear relationship was observed with emotional support and integration (i.e., support provided to others) but not with informational or tangible support.\r"

Relationships among variables also did not differ between respondents and persistent nonrespondents, between respondents and four specific attrition types, or between the original sample and various multiwave samples. In discussing the findings, the limited effects that attrition has on relationships between variables are contrasted to the stronger effects that attrition appears to have on mean levels of those variables, showing that the former does not necessarily follow from the latter. The findings support recent conclusions in the literature that the threat posed by panel loss is not as great as typically assumed.\r"

The social support literature suggests that living with others may reduce the need for use of formal and informal health care services independently of marital status because of (a) the substitution of home care, and/or (b) enhancement of physical and mental health. This study of elderly persons, based on data from the National Medical Care Expenditure Survey (NMCES), examined the substitution hypothesis. The impact of marital status and living arrangements on the use of formal health services among persons 65 years of age and older was examined using path analysis. These data confirm a substitution effect whereby persons living with others are more likely to stay in bed, but less likely to see a doctor, than are persons who live alone.\r"

We conclude that SDB occurring in healthy aged persons is probably not of immediate concern and that the use of a cutting score of AHI greater than or equal to 5 for diagnosis of sleep apnea syndrome is not indicative in healthy aged persons. However, these results may not be applicable to older persons who are not in the excellent state of health that was required for participants in our study.\r"

In spite of a selection bias due to the informed consent process that resulted in the exclusion of many of the most functionally impaired incontinent residents, the incontinent study participants had significantly greater impairments in functional abilities related to toileting and, on average, took longer to perform a timed series of toileting-related tasks than did the continent comparison group. With the exception of bacteriuria, we did not find incontinence to be associated with most of the major clinical conditions and medications we examined, nor did we find differences in morale and most measures of social activities between the incontinent and continent residents. The data highlight the strong association between functional disability and incontinence in the nursing home setting and suggest that a standard functional assessment of toileting skills could make an important contribution to the care of incontinent residents.\r"

The proportion of visits by the elderly group to the ED was similar to the proportion of elderly residents in the area surrounding the hospital. Elderly patients were more likely than nonelderly patients to have an emergent diagnosis (34.4 vs. 8.3%), to arrive by ambulance (54.6 vs. 23.5%), to be admitted to the hospital (51.1 vs. 14.4%), and to have a medical (as opposed to a surgical) illness (75.0 vs. 53.2%). The spectrum of diseases was different between the two groups. Elderly patients had a higher proportion of cardiac (28.4 vs. 7.2%) and pulmonary disease (5.3 vs. 2.8%). Nonelderly patients had more injuries (30.5 vs. 10.7%) and self-limited infectious disease (11.5 vs. 5.0%). The proportion of psychiatric disease and social problems was low in both groups, about 5%. Elderly patients had a significantly lower proportion of nonurgent diagnoses (19.4 vs. 32.0%) than the nonelderly patients. Use of the ED by elderly patients is different from nonelderly patients in that they are more likely to have a serious medical illness. There is little evidence that elderly persons use the ED for primary self-care or social problems.\r"

The times of food restriction were: (a) from 6 weeks of age, (b) limited to early life, and (c) beginning in young adult life. Hormone-sensitive lipolysis is lost with age. Food restriction from 6 weeks of age prevents this loss, and food restriction started in adult life causes the recovery of this lipolysis. Hormone binding studies reveal that: (a) changes in glucagon-stimulated lipolysis parallel changes in glucagon binding; (b) glucagon binding and glucagon-stimulated lipolysis correlate inversely with cell size; (c) changes in epinephrine-stimulated lipolysis are not due to changes in beta-adrenergic binding; and (d) neither beta-adrenergic binding nor epinephrine-promoted lipolysis correlate with fat cell size. Phosphodiesterase activity is not influenced by diet, making it unlikely to be a postreceptor component lost with age.\r"
