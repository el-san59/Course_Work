  ".W": "Body mass index (weight (kg) divided by height squared (m2] and its association with the risk of myocardial infarction and death from all causes were studied prospectively in a randomly selected population sample in eastern Finland aged 30-59 at outset in 1972. The study population consisted of 3786 men and 4120 women. The participation rate in the survey in 1972 was over 90%. All deaths and admissions to hospital in the sample were obtained from the National Death Certificate and Hospital Discharge Registers. During the seven years of follow up until 1978, 170 men and 52 women had acute myocardial infarction, and during the nine years up to 1980, 223 men and 92 women died. Independent of age, men with a body mass index of 28.5 or more had a significantly higher incidence of acute myocardial infarction. This effect was also independent of smoking but not independent of biological coronary risk factors--that is, serum cholesterol concentration and blood pressure. In the analysis stratified for smoking in men the body mass index total mortality curve was J shaped among non-smokers, whereas smoking entirely outweighed body mass index as a predictor of death. Body mass index did not contribute significantly to the risk of either acute myocardial infarction or death in women. It is concluded that a body mass index of around 29.0-31.0 or more is not only a marker for coronary risk factors but is also a predictor of acute myocardial infarction in men.\r"

The mean number correctly identified was 9.1, which was significant compared with the number expected by random selection (7.5). No specific features were identified that distinguished the two groups of infants; selection was intuitive. Nevertheless, the fact that differences can be detected in some way may be useful for antismoking health education.\r"

  ".W": "A detailed investigation of trends in suicide rates in Scotland from 1974 to 1984 showed a complex pattern. Overall rates for men increased by 40% with the greatest increases in those aged 45-64. In contrast, rates for women showed a small decline, which was most noticeable in those aged 15-24. The well recognised decline in poisoning by domestic gas was seen over this period, and suicide by this method virtually stopped. Both sexes showed a decline in suicide by poisoning with drugs, although the decrease was larger among women. The fall in suicide rates among young women was almost all due to the decrease in this method. The rise in rates for men was largely due to increases in hanging and poisoning with vehicle exhaust gases, although all methods except drugs and domestic gas showed some increase. These findings indicate that suicide is an increasing problem with causes that are far from understood, so that prevention may be difficult.\r"

A quarter (71) of the deaths reported were unnatural, verdicts of suicide or accidental death or open verdicts having been recorded. For men in most age groups the proportion of deaths by suicide was two to three times greater than in the general population in 1982; the rate among those aged 25-29 was five times that in the general population. Differences in the rate of unnatural death among diagnostic categories of mental illness were not significant, but the proportion of unnatural deaths among the mentally handicapped will probably eventually be lower than that among psychotic offenders or those with personality disorders. Violent death occurs at an older age in those with affective disorders. Social isolation and alienation add to the handicap of mental disorder in this group of people, and these sometimes difficult but always vulnerable patients must continue to be offered asylum other than prison.\r"

Most practitioners felt the need for more tuition and practice in advanced life support, but 15 did not have the practice defibrillator with them when on call. Only nine doctors normally had an electrocardiograph with them when on call, most relying on clinical acumen to make an operational diagnosis; there appeared to be reluctance to use any drugs other than opiates and atropine in the management of acute myocardial infarction. This study highlights the difficulty of maintaining readiness to deal effectively with myocardial infarction in the community and the problems of relying on the electrocardiogram in deciding who should be given thrombolytic treatment.\r"

In four patients superficial thrombophlebitis preceded deep vein thrombosis by one to 11 years. Post-thrombotic varicose veins and venous insufficiency had developed in four patients. In three of those and in a fourth patient symptomatic superficial thrombophlebitis, deep vein thrombosis, and pulmonary embolism did not recur while they were taking oral anticoagulant treatment for six to 12 years. The anticoagulation intensity corresponded to international normalised ratio values of over 2.5. It is concluded that the benefits of anticoagulant treatment for patients with congenital thrombotic disease are great, and thus it is necessary to make an early diagnosis and treat patients at risk of developing thrombosis.\r"

Althogether 244 articles meeting the criteria were found through a Medline search and through examining the reference lists of the articles retrieved. The drugs compared in the studies were classified as new or as control drugs and the outcome of the trial as positive or not positive. The reference lists of all papers with references to other trials on the new drug were then examined for reference bias. Positive bias was judged to have occurred if the reference list contained a higher proportion of references with a positive outcome for that drug than among all the articles assumed to have been available to the authors (those published more than two years earlier than the index article). Altogether 133 of the 244 articles were excluded for various reasons--for example, 44 because of multiple publication and 19 because they had no references. Among the 111 articles analysed bias was not possible in the references of 35 (because all the references gave the same outcome); 10 had a neutral selection of references, 22 a negative selection, and 44 a positive selection--a significant positive bias. This bias was not caused by better scientific standing of the cited articles over the uncited ones. Thus retrieving literature by scanning reference lists may produce a biased sample of articles, and reference bias may also render the conclusions of an article less reliable.\r"

Small studies continue to be carried out with little more than a blind hope of showing the desired effect. Nevertheless, papers based on such work are submitted for publication, especially if the results turn out to be statistically significant. There is confusion about what makes a result suitable for publication. Often there is a preference for statistically significant results at the peer review stage. Consequently published reports of small studies tend to contain too many false positive results and to exaggerate the true effects. The use of a criterion of a posteriori power does not eliminate the bias; a priori power is the criterion of choice. This could be implemented by peer review of study protocols at the planning stage by funding bodies and journals.\r"

A study was carried out to determine whether the increased survival rate was attributable to better care or differences in the babies treated at the unit, or both. Four subpopulations were defined by district of maternal residence to obtain fairly comparable samples. Survival to 2 years increased as proportions treated at the regional unit increased, this \"dose-response\" effect being most pronounced among the smallest infants. Despite less favourable social state infants from the district housing the regional unit were apparently in the best condition at birth; had been managed most actively before, at, and after birth; and were the most likely to survive. This increased survival, however, was associated with a marginally significant increase in prevalence of major impairments. These data underline the need for routine surveillance of large representative samples of low birthweight survivors.\r"

Four patients with impaired renal function (creatinine clearance less than 50 ml/min) retained between 60% and 74% of the aluminium infused during a single plasma exchange. Transiliac bone biopsy specimens from three patients in this group had a high content of aluminium and showed histological evidence of current or previous bone disease related to aluminium. Two of these patients suffered intermittent bone pain. The main route of excretion of injected aluminium was in urine, only a small proportion of the total input being removed in the \"plasma bag\" during plasma exchange. The extent of aluminium retention and bone deposition was not reflected by the plasma aluminium concentration before or after plasma exchange. Treatment of five patients with intravenous desferrioxamine increased the plasma aluminium concentration and urinary output of aluminium in those with evidence of aluminium retention. These studies show that patients with poor renal function receiving treatment with albumin contaminated with aluminium retain the metal and deposit it in bone, where it may eventually cause aluminium bone disease. Plasma exchange should be used with caution in patients with renal impairment.\r"

There was extensive use of proprietary medicines, yet mothers also used some home remedies or took no action at all. They were found to treat their children's symptoms themselves, contacting their general practitioner only if symptoms did not clear up or became more serious. Generally mothers should be treated as competent in caring for a child whose health and behaviour are causing concern, and in these cases the skills of the general practitioner should be viewed as complementing those of the mother. Mothers do not invariably expect a prescription from the doctor.\r"

The adequacy of SMRs as a proxy for morbidity has aroused controversy, particularly from RAWP losers in London, and is one of the main themes of the National Health Service Management Board's current review of RAWP. Critics have argued, firstly, that the nature of the relation between morbidity and mortality is unknown; and, secondly, that SMRs are incomplete because they fail to take account of the effect of social deprivation on the need for health care. As a result several alternative proxies for morbidity based on social indicators have been proposed. One of their principal drawbacks is that their use is justified by their relation to measures of use of services known to be affected by the prevailing level of supply. Furthermore, the evidence suggests that mortality data actually correlate quite well with the available measures of both morbidity and social deprivation. But without access to comprehensive morbidity data the SMR debate is bound to remain inconclusive. As measures of health need, however, SMRs have the twin merits of being (a) independent of supply, and (b) more direct measures of health state than social indicators.\r"

It has also been implied that Scotland's allocation should be cut substantially to improve services in England. On the assumption that the purpose of examining the distribution of the health and community health service budget is to ensure \"equal opportunity of access to health care for people at equal risk\" it is concluded that simple RAWPing of the United Kingdom budget is flawed and a conclusion based on this is therefore untenable.\r"

The patients (nine children and 19 adults) were moderately undernourished; none was pregnant or had renal insufficiency. Plasma insulin concentrations rose during the infusion and then declined. Plasma glucose concentrations were decreased at two, three, and four hours after the start of the infusion. Insulin: glucose ratios were raised between half an hour and two hours after the start of the infusion. The three infusions of quinine increased plasma insulin concentrations in a similar way. In nine patients, including four children, plasma glucose concentrations fell below 2.8 mmol/l on one or two occasions. At the time of the hypoglycaemia plasma insulin concentrations were inappropriately high as shown by a consistent and often considerable increase in the insulin:glucose ratio. Hypoglycaemia that may pass unnoticed in comatose patients is thus a common complication of treating severe malaria with quinine, in particular in children. Its high incidence calls for attentive monitoring and preventive measures.\r"

Thoracic radiotherapy was delivered to the limited stage (LS) patients. The complete response rate (CR, determined clinically and radiologically) was 76% for the 78 LS patients with a further 14% partial response (PR). The majority of the CRs were confirmed on a follow-up bronchoscopy. The CR rate was 27% for extensive stage (ES) patients with another 38% undergoing a partial response. The median survival for LS patients was 11 months, (16 months for CR confirmed by rebronchoscopy) and 8 months for ES patients. The 2-year actuarial survival for LS patients is 27%, follow-up ranges from 12 months to 30 months with a median of 22 months. Toxicity was not severe for the patient population, of whom only 20% had a good performance status before chemotherapy. Parental antibiotics were required on 4% of all 844 chemotherapy courses and 12% of courses were delayed due to side effects. The majority of responses occurred within the first two courses of chemotherapy and there was a corresponding improvement in the patients' symptoms and performance status. The regimen produced rapid tumor response with corresponding improvement in symptoms without marked toxicity and allowed further treatment development.\r"

Histologic examination revealed the so-called intravascular bronchioloalveolar tumor (IVBAT) in all instances. The patient died from pneumonia superimposed on decreased respiratory function 24 years after the onset of disease. This is the longest survival so far reported in IVBAT. The treatment was surgical in all phases of the disease, and the patient did not receive radiotherapy or cytostatic drug therapy. Mediastinal and pleural tumor nodules were removed 17 years from the first pulmonary operation, and 24 years after the first operation a fibrous tumor was removed from the retroperitoneal space. Immunohistologically, the tumor cells were positive for vimentin-type of intermediate filaments, in line with their mesenchymal nature. Endothelial markers, Factor VIII-related antigen and Ulex europaeus I lectin binding, were not found in convincingly neoplastic cells, and Schwann cell, epithelial cell, muscle cell, and histiocytic markers were absent. Thus, IVBAT appears to be a low-grade malignant mesenchymal neoplasm, composed of poorly differentiated mesenchymal cells, whose exact nature remains undefined with the currently used cell-type markers.\r"

  ".W": "Radioimmunoassay (RIA) for fraction beta of the chorionic gonadotropin hormone (HCG-beta subunit) has a clinical value in the management of patients with gonadal germ cell tumors (GCT). Treatment of disease causes temporary or permanent iatrogenic hypogonadism and secondary plasmatic elevations of luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH). Small but significant cross-reactions with LH have been observed, resulting in spurious elevations of HCG, as result, also in part, of the lack of specificity of the RIA. Twelve patients with complete response showed high HCG follow-up levels between 1.7 and 7.8 mIU/ml; simultaneous determination of LH and FSH resulted, also, in high levels: 79.9 to 24.9 mIU/ml and 80 to 19.2 mIU/ml, respectively, in females, and 78 to 18 mIU/ml and 65.1 to 5 mIU/ml, respectively, in males. Administration of exogenous hormones resulted in all cases in reduction of LH and FSH values and normalization of HCG. Therefore, relationship between spurious elevations of HCG and the iatrogenic hypogonadism is clarified through this simple technique that is of most importance as regards the adoption of the appropriate therapy.\r"

There was a significant decrease in serum sodium and bicarbonate, and a significant increase in serum osmolality in both groups after mannitol administration. The decrease in serum sodium and the increase in serum osmolality were significantly greater in patients receiving the larger dose of mannitol. The infusion of low-dose mannitol resulted in a slight decrease in serum potassium. In contrast, after high-dose mannitol there was a significant rise in serum potassium reaching a maximum mean increase of 1.5 mmol . l-1. Urine electrolyte concentration and osmolality showed a similar decrease in both groups. The significant changes that occurred with the administration of mannitol were of short duration in these patients with normal cardiac and renal function. The clinically most important change is the increase in serum potassium with high-dose mannitol. The exact mechanism of this increase remains unclear.\r"

  ".W": "This study was undertaken to determine what changes occur in the intestinal microvasculature during the rapid growth associated with juvenile maturation. A technique was developed that permitted the comparison of the same microvessels in exactly the same intestinal region at two time periods of an animal's life. A region of the terminal ileum of 5-week-old rats was exposed and marked, and photographs and video recordings were made of the microvessels. Four weeks later, the marked intestinal region was located, and photography and videography of the microvessels were repeated. Comparison of indexes for body, intestinal, and microvascular growth for the treated rats and age- and colony-matched controls revealed no significant differences. The number and branching pattern of arterioles observed in the marked region remained remarkably constant during the 4 weeks between observation periods, even though body and bowel mass of the treated animals increased approximately 2.5 times. The lengths of the arterioles were increased (18%) by almost the same proportion as the axis of bowel (22%) in which they were oriented. The average distance between capillaries in the radial intestinal muscle layer was also increased by about the same percentage (24%) as that of tissue elongation (22%). The overall data are consistent with the hypothesis that during the growth spurt of juvenile life, the arterioles present at the weanling stage are elongated and new branches do not develop. The net effect of tissue growth with a minimal change in numbers of arterioles is a decreased ratio of number of arterioles to tissue mass as a normal consequence of maturation.\r"

Prior to hypertension, bilateral carotid occlusion (BCO) increased mean arterial pressure by 38 +/- 2 from 101 +/- 2 mm Hg and total peripheral resistance by 19 +/- 2 from 46 +/- 3 mm Hg/l/min, while cardiac output and heart rate did not change from 2,299 +/- 128 ml/min and 84 +/- 4 beats/min, respectively. At 2 weeks after renal wrapping, there were significant increases in baseline mean arterial pressure, cardiac output, and total peripheral resistance and decreases in heart rate; BCO increased mean arterial pressure by 59 +/- 5 from 130 +/- 4 mm Hg, heart rate by 36 +/- 5 beats/min from 69 +/- 3 beats/min, and cardiac output by 458 +/- 103 from 2,711 +/- 239 ml/min. By 4 weeks after renal wrapping, heart rate and mean arterial pressure responses to BCO were approaching baseline levels. After beta-adrenergic receptor blockade, responses to BCO of mean arterial pressure, cardiac output, and heart rate were no longer significantly enhanced during the development of hypertension. Thus, in conscious dogs, reflex pressor responses to baroreceptor unloading via BCO were enhanced during the development of hypertension but no longer present 3 weeks later. The augmented mean arterial pressor responses to BCO were mediated by increases in cardiac output and heart rate, which in turn, appeared to be controlled by beta-adrenergic receptor mechanisms.\r"

The present study demonstrates that the addition of ethylisopropylamiloride, an inhibitor of Na+-H+ exchange, leads to an inhibition of platelet activating factor-induced serotonin release and thromboxane B2 production in human platelets in citrated plasma. In addition, platelet activating factor-induced platelet secretion is blocked by the cyclooxygenase inhibitor indomethacin or the thromboxane antagonist SQ 29548, indicating that arachidonic acid mobilization and metabolism is required for platelet activating factor to elicit platelet activation. Our interpretation of the present findings is that platelet activating factor-induced secretion of dense granules from the human platelet requires the production of cyclooxygenase metabolites from arachidonic acid and that Na+-H+ exchange plays an important, albeit not exclusive, role in mobilization of arachidonic acid in response to platelet activating factor.\r"

  ".W": "The role of arachidonic acid in forming endothelium-derived relaxing factor remains controversial. This controversy may be explained if more than one factor exists. To test this hypothesis, the effects of various inhibitors of arachidonic acid metabolism were studied. The perfusate from canine femoral arteries with endothelium was bioassayed with coronary artery rings without endothelium. Treatment of the perfused segment (but not the bioassay ring) with inhibitors of phospholipase A2 (quinacrine) or cytochrome P450 (metyrapone) had no effect on the basal relaxing activity of the effluent; treatment with the inhibitor of lipoxygenase, nordihydroguaiaretic acid, significantly depressed it. With increasing concentrations of acetylcholine, a biphasic concentration-relaxation curve was obtained; the enzyme inhibitors depressed or prevented the first phase but did not affect the second phase. Infusion of arachidonic acid or soybean lipoxidase directly on the bioassay ring did not cause relaxation; together, they evoked concentration-dependent relaxations. These data suggest that acetylcholine can trigger the release of two chemically different relaxing mediators from the endothelium of the canine femoral artery. One factor may be a product of lipoxygenase (or epoxigenase). The second factor is not a metabolite of arachidonic acid and may be released under basal conditions. The existence of two (or more) chemically different endothelium-derived mediators may help to explain the controversial data regarding the nature of the factor(s).\r"

  ".W": "A marked functional polarity of endothelial cells as well as an asymmetry of the vascular wall in response to vasoactive compounds is well established. Therefore, we investigated the polarity of endothelium-derived relaxant factor (EDRF) release from native endothelial cells, its diffusion characteristics, and its dilator effects on inner and outer muscle layers of the vascular wall in isolated rabbit arteries. Following exposure of rabbit aortae (with intact endothelium) to the EDRF stimulators acetylcholine, A23187, or thimerosal, a humoral dilator compound could be assayed in the adventitial superfusate of the vessels. The vasodilator effects were blocked by the EDRF inhibitors hemoglobin, dithiothreitol, and gossypol. Penetration of the dilator through the arterial wall following stimulation by acetylcholine, A23187, or thimerosal was observed only when dilator EDRF activity in the luminal perfusate was maximal. Luminally administered EDRF, released from cultured endothelial cells, did not cross the aortic wall in detectable amounts. EDRF (from cultured cells) elicited significantly smaller dilations (9 +/- 4%) when applied to the adventitial side of endothelium-denuded rabbit aortae or femoral arteries as compared with luminal application (92 +/- 7%). In contrast, sodium nitroprusside was equieffective by both routes of administration. We conclude that EDRF in native endothelial cells is released in both luminal and abluminal directions and can penetrate the entire vascular wall. However, the lengthy diffusion time and the decreasing sensitivity of outer smooth muscle layers suggest that mechanisms other than EDRF diffusion contribute significantly to the propagation of endothelium-mediated relaxation through the arterial wall.\r"

  ".W": "We have previously found that vascular relaxation to acetylcholine and thrombin is markedly impaired in vessels from monkeys with diet-induced atherosclerosis. In the present study, we found that both normal and atherosclerotic vessels relaxed completely to the calcium ionophore A23187, which stimulates release of the endothelium-derived relaxing factor by nonreceptor-mediated mechanisms. Atherosclerotic vessels, however, were less sensitive to this agent. The finding that responses to the calcium ionophore were impaired in atherosclerosis suggests that abnormal endothelium-dependent relaxation in atherosclerotic vessels is not related entirely to alterations of thrombin and muscarinic receptors but may also be due to abnormal endothelium-derived relaxing factor production or transfer from the endothelium to the underlying vascular smooth muscle. Neither normal nor atherosclerotic iliac arteries constricted in response to acetylcholine when studied in the nonpreconstricted state. Constriction to acetylcholine in these vessels was not unmasked by removal of the endothelium. Thus, the smooth muscle of iliac vessels from monkeys contains few functioning muscarinic receptors. Impaired relaxation of atherosclerotic vessels to acetylcholine is not due to enhanced muscarinic-mediated constriction or to production of an endothelium-derived constricting factor. In vivo studies were performed to determine if alpha-adrenergic coronary vascular constriction is enhanced in the presence of atherosclerosis. In anesthetized monkeys, myocardial oxygen consumption was increased by two mechanisms, aortic occlusion and phenylephrine infusion. During both aortic occlusion and phenylephrine infusion, decreases in coronary vascular resistance were similar in control and atherosclerotic monkeys.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Infusion of agonists did not change mean arterial pressure or heart rate. In vessels with intact endothelium, iliac diameter increased with nitroglycerin (5.1 +/- 0.5%), acetylcholine (4.5 +/- 0.5%), and epinephrine (3.5 +/- 0.9%) and decreased with norepinephrine (-6.7 +/- 1.7%). Preventing increases in blood flow during infusions of agonists abolished the dilation with epinephrine but not with nitroglycerin or acetylcholine. When blood flow was completely stopped by occlusion of the iliac artery, local injection of nitroglycerin (5.7 +/- 0.7%) and acetylcholine (3.0 +/- 0.6%) dilated, but epinephrine constricted (-9.1 +/- 1.7%), the iliac artery. Removal of the iliac artery endothelium did not change the dilation with nitroglycerin (4.6 +/- 0.5%), abolished the dilation with acetylcholine (0.0 +/- 0.3%), reversed the dilation with epinephrine to constriction (-3.3 +/- 0.7%), and enhanced the constriction with norepinephrine (-13.6 +/- 1.6%). These results indicate that epinephrine and acetylcholine dilate the iliac artery via a mechanism mediated by the endothelium. The endothelium-dependent dilation observed with epinephrine is mediated by an increase in iliac blood flow, while that observed with acetylcholine is due partially to a direct effect on the endothelium as well as an effect of blood flow superimposed on the direct effect. The results further indicate that the endothelium attenuates vasoconstriction produced by the alpha-adrenergic agonists, norepinephrine and epinephrine.\r"

  ".W": "In patients with pulmonary hypertension associated with congenital heart defects, ultrastructural abnormalities are observed in endothelial cells, which suggest heightened metabolic function. If endothelial production of the von Willebrand factor (vWF) is increased, this may be associated with abnormal interactions with platelets leading to worsening of the pulmonary hypertension. We therefore evaluated vWF in 30 patients with pulmonary hypertension (25 with congenital heart defects) and in 30 individuals with normal pulmonary arterial pressure (12 with congenital heart defects). We measured the antigenic (vWF: Ag) and biologic (VWF: rist) activity of vWF in plasma and assessed endothelial vWF: Ag directly by an immunoperoxidase stain applied to lung biopsy tissue. Because of considerable variance and small size, the group of five patients with pulmonary hypertension and without congenital heart defects were excluded from statistical analyses. Patients with pulmonary hypertension and congenital heart defects had significant higher vWF: Ag levels than individuals with normal pulmonary arterial pressure without congenital heart defects (p less than .05), whereas values in those with normal pressure and congenital heart defects were intermediate. In lung biopsy tissue available from 29 patients in this study and from 11 others we previously reported, immunostain of pulmonary arterial endothelium for vWF was intense (suggesting increased production) in 29 of 32 with pulmonary hypertension and congenital heart defects and in only one of eight with normal pulmonary arterial pressure and congenital heart defects (p less than .01). Only three patients with congenital heart defects and pulmonary hypertension and increased vWF: Ag, however, had increased vWF: rist. Compatible with this discrepancy was a loss of vWF high-molecular weight forms as determined by both crossed immunoelectrophoresis and multimeric analysis. Our results suggest that increased vWF in most patients with congenital heart defects and pulmonary hypertension is associated with increased production of a biologically deficient molecule lacking high-molecular weight forms.\r"

Right ventricular biopsy specimens, obtained on bypass just before aortic cross-clamping, at the end of 40 +/- 8 min (mean +/- SD) cold arrest with blood cardioplegia, and during reperfusion, were analyzed for hydroxy conjugated dienes, a chemical signature of free radical injury. Structural confirmation of the dienes was done by mass spectroscopy. Conjugated dienes were detected before ischemia on bypass, at end-ischemia, and during reperfusion. The products identified are 9 and 13 OH isomers of linoleic acid and 5, 8, 9, 11, and 15 OH isomers of arachidonic acid. Microscopic examination of right ventricular biopsy specimens obtained on bypass just after cross-clamping showed focal myocyte necrosis. The hydroxy conjugated diene levels in control canine hearts subjected to 105 min of cardiopulmonary bypass without aortic cross-clamping were not detectable. Our results support the occurrence of oxygen-mediated free radical injury during elective repair of tetralogy of Fallot. The presence of conjugated dienes before aortic cross-clamping suggests oxygen toxicity with reoxygenation from cardiopulmonary bypass.\r"

Both kinds of hemodialysis were carried out with a recirculating dialysate delivery system and a relatively low blood flow (180 ml/min). Each patient underwent two hemodialysis procedures, one with bicarbonate and one with acetate, lasting for four hours. Ultrafiltration rates were kept below 250 ml/h and only biocompatible membranes with a relatively small surface area (Biospal 2400, Hospal, France) were used. Despite the mild hemodialysis conditions, hypotensive episodes with a mean blood pressure below 70 mmHg were observed in 3 out of 7 bicarbonate sessions and 4 out of 7 acetate sessions. Thus, we could not demonstrate a hemodynamic advantage of bicarbonate hemodialysis in this group of ventilated patients. This contrasts with other studies conducted in non-ventilated patients. Prevention of hypoxemia by mechanical ventilation and control of vascular tone by the use of vasoactive drugs may be of more clinical relevance than the kind of hemodialysis procedure that is used.\r"

These concentrations were achieved with 1200 or 2400 mg/day for 2 weeks or a loading dose of 2400 mg/day for 3 days followed by 600 mg/day for 4 weeks. Drug accumulation occurred at all doses. The elimination half-life appeared to be approximately 2 weeks. Reversible adverse reactions, principally resulting in central nervous system symptoms and anemia, correlated with dose and duration of therapy. Immunologic enhancement of T-lymphocyte-mediated mitogen-induced responses was observed in the majority of patients who had reduction in reverse transcriptase activity. However, specific T4+ lymphocyte-mediated antigen-induced responses increased to within the normal range in only three patients. Significant enhancement appeared to correlate with the severity of baseline antigen-induced functional impairment.

  ".W": "The efficacy and safety of isradipine (PN 200-110), a new dihydropyridine calcium antagonist, was evaluated in 87 hypertensive patients in a placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized multicenter trial. After a 3-week single-blind washout phase, isradipine (or matching placebo) was administered for 4 weeks, beginning at 2.5 mg b.i.d. with increments of 2.5 mg b.i.d. at weekly intervals if supine diastolic blood pressure remained greater than or equal to 90 mm Hg. At the end of 1 week average supine blood pressure in the isradipine group (n = 45) fell from a baseline of 156 +/- 13/104 +/- 4 mm Hg to 146 +/- 14/97 +/- 7 mm Hg. By week 4 blood pressure was reduced by 19/14 mm Hg compared with 4/5 mm Hg in the placebo group (P less than 0.001 between groups). Supine and standing pulse rates were slightly increased initially with isradipine therapy but returned to baseline with increasing isradipine doses. Blood pressure responses at week 4 were good or excellent (supine diastolic less than or equal to 90 mm Hg or greater than or equal to 10 mm Hg decrease from baseline) in 87% of isradipine-treated patients and in 26% of placebo-treated patients. Headache, edema, abdominal discomfort, and constipation occurred slightly more frequently in isradipine-treated patients than in placebo-treated control subjects. The results indicate that isradipine, administered as monotherapy in doses of 2.5 to 10 mg b.i.d., is safe and effective in patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension.\r"

Bilirubin pretreatment led to a 25% increase in hepatic UDP-glucuronosyltransferase activity. Bilirubin Tm was increased by 22% and correlated positively with glucuronosyltransferase activity. 4. The output of conjugated bilirubin in bile was enhanced but no changes in the proportion of monoconjugates to disconjugates were observed. 5. Our data suggest that prolonged treatment with bilirubin can increase biliary bilirubin excretion by inducing glucuronosyltransferase activity.\r"

Measurements were made of oxygen consumption (VO2), carbon dioxide production (VCO2), minute ventilation (VE), tidal volume (VT), respiratory frequency (fR), inspiratory and expiratory time (TI, TE) and mean inspiratory flow (VT/TI) using a non-invasive canopy-computer-spirometer system. 2. At rest, males had greater values of VE, VT, TI, inspiratory duty cycle (TI/TTOT), VCO2 and VO2, and a lower fR, than females. 3. At the lower workload, VO2, VCO2, VE, VT and VT/TI increased linearly with increasing pedalling rate, whereas at the higher workload there was a decrease in VO2 and little or no change in ventilatory parameters from 30 to 50 cycles/min except for an increase in fR in females. 4. While performing supine exercise, there was an effect of pedalling rate on ventilatory and metabolic parameters at the low workload (12 W) which diminished at the higher workload (37 W). An increase in pedalling rate appears to enhance efficiency at these low workloads. 5. Differences between the sexes during exercise generally include: (a) a higher breathing frequency, (b) a greater mechanical efficiency, and (c) lower ventilatory equivalents of O2 and CO2 (VE/VO2 and VE/VCO2) during the higher workload in females than males.\r"

The mean plasma h-alpha ANP level was 30.9 +/- SEM 8.8 pmol/l on the control day; it increased exponentially in response to 9 alpha-fludrocortisone acetate administration, reached a significant level (114.0 +/- 22.4 pmol/l, P less than 0.05) on the day before escape and remained elevated during escape. 4. The 24 h creatinine clearance and blood pressure did not change significantly before the escape. Plasma h-alpha ANP increased markedly when the cumulative sodium balance exceeded 220 mmol. 5. These results suggest that h-alpha ANP may play a contributory role in natriuresis and diuresis after mineralocorticoid excess.\r"

Seven healthy subjects performed two maximal incremental cycle ergometer exercise tests (100 kpm/min increments every minute), and also steady state exercise (SS) at 25, 50, and 75 percent of their maximum power output. The Q was determined by the indirect CO2 Fick method; mixed venous PCO2 was calculated using the exponential CO2 rebreathing method. No significant differences were observed for the cardiac output/oxygen uptake relationship (Q/VO2) obtained between the two incremental exercise tests. During NSS, the Q/VO2 was linear (r = .89; intercept = 5.69 L/min; slope = 5.39). During the SS, Q/VO2 was linear (r = .90; intercept = 5.47 L/min; slope = 4.87). No significant difference was observed between the SS and NSS Q/VO2 relationships (p greater than 0.05), and the NSS relationship was similar to Q/VO2 values previously reported in the literature. Accurate and reproducible measurements of Q can be obtained noninvasively in healthy subjects using the exponential CO2 rebreathing method during incremental progressive exercise tests, with similar values at comparable VO2 to those obtained in the steady state.\r"

The significant variables in a logistic regression model predicting the presence of hypercapnia were daytime arterial oxygen pressure (PaO2; p less than 0.0001) and gender (p less than 0.04), the latter reflecting the higher number of hypercapnic women in our patient population. Multiple regression analysis performed in the hypercapnic group to study the determinants of the severity of elevation of arterial carbon dioxide tension (PaCO2) revealed significant contribution from the PaO2, the apnea-plus-hypopnea index (AHI), and the percent predicted forced vital capacity (r2 = 0.56; p less than 0.0001), whereas in the normocapnic patients, PaCO2 related to PaO2 only. These results suggest that daytime hypoxemia, mechanical impairment of the respiratory system due to obesity or obstructive airway disease (or both), and the severity of sleep-induced respiratory abnormalities as assessed by AHI contribute to the severity of carbon dioxide retention in patients with occlusive sleep apnea in a multifactorial fashion.\r"

In patients with lung disease, the end-tidal CO2 pressure (PETCO2) can differ from PaCO2 because of ventilation-perfusion (VA/Q) mismatching, and changes in PETCO2 may be seen with corresponding increase, decrease, or no change in PaCO2 depending on what happens to VA/Q mismatching. We compared the difference between PETCO2 and PaCO2 in 17 patients undergoing mechanical ventilation. Large differences were found between PaCO2 and PETCO2 in individual patients; P(a-et)CO2 correlated closely with VD/VT. Our studies confirm that PetCO2 is a poor estimate of PaCO2 in patients with respiratory failure. However, the P(a-et)CO2 may be the most appropriate use for end-tidal PCO2 monitoring. In addition, we found that the end-tidal CO2 monitor may be easily adapted for expedient measurement of VD/VT.\r"

For the in vivo studies the sheep were pretreated with aerosols of placebo (buffered saline solution), 20 mg of nedocromil sodium, or 20 mg of cromolyn sodium (both dissolved in 3 ml of buffered saline solution) and then challenged with aerosol antigen. Specific pulmonary resistance (SRL) was measured before and after challenge to document the responses of the airways. In the trial with placebo, challenge with antigen resulted in significant early and late increases in SRL. Treatment with nedocromil sodium significantly reduced the early response to antigen and blocked the late response. Cromolyn sodium gave the same results; there were no statistical differences between the responses of the airways for the two dogs. In vitro nedocromil sodium at doses of 10(-6)M and 10(-5)M inhibited significantly the contractile responses of sheep tracheal smooth muscle to A suum. Cromolyn sodium only showed efficacy at 10(-5)M. These results suggest that nedocromil sodium may be potentially useful in the treatment of reversible allergic disease of the airways.\r"

Rioprostil inhibited betazole-stimulated gastric acid secretion with an ED50 of 16 (10-24) micrograms/kg, intragastrically. A near-maximal gastric antisecretory dose (100 micrograms/kg, intragastrically) had no effect on basal serum gastrin levels but significantly attenuated the rapid rise in serum gastrin which follows feeding, a result different from that reported for other prostaglandin E1 analogs. A nonantisecretory dose of rioprostil (1.0 micrograms/kg, intragastrically) also attenuated the rise in postprandial serum gastrin. An antigastrin effect using a nonantisecretory dose of an antiulcer agent has not been reported previously and may indicate that rioprostil has a direct inhibitory effect on secretion of gastrin. The ability of rioprostil to inhibit gastric acid secretion and decrease postprandial peak serum gastrin levels, coupled with previously established cytoprotective efficacy, makes it an attractive clinical candidate for the treatment and prevention of peptic ulcer disease.\r"

The isolated perfused rat liver model has been used to examine effects of vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), somatostatin, bombesin, and thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) on bile flow and bile acid transport. No changes were seen following bolus administration of bombesin (3 X 10(-8)-1.5 X 10(-6) M) or TRH (3 X 10(-7)-3 X 10(-6) M), while somatostatin (6 X 10(-6) M) produced a small decrease in bile flow without any change in bile acid output. VIP (3 X 10(-7) M) caused a highly significant increase in both volume of bile flow (0.85 +/- 0.8 to 1.11 +/- 0.09 microliter/min/g liver, P less than 0.001) and bile acid output (31.6 +/- 1.5 to 43.2 +/- 1.7 nmol/min/g liver, P less than 0.001). Elimination of Ca2+ from liver perfusate did not prevent VIP-induced increases in bile flow and bile acid output, and no synergistic effect of concomitant theophylline administration was observed. While effects of VIP on bile flow appear to be due to alterations in hepatic transport of bile acids, the exact mechanism(s) producing these changes remains to be elucidated.\r"

Parallel to the in vivo findings, an impaired GH responsiveness to GHRF is evident in somatotropes from old rats of either sex. We report here that in anterior pituitaries (APs) from aged male and female rats GHRF-induced stimulation of adenylate cyclase (AC) activity was strikingly reduced (male rats, change from baseline 700% in young and 100% in old rats) or lacking (female rats, change from baseline 430% in young and 13% in old rats) when compared to that evoked by GHRF in the APs from young counterparts. Pretreatment with GHRH (5 micrograms/rat iv for 3 days) decreased the high basal AC activity of old male rats [from 33.38 +/- 3.60 to 15.99 +/- 5.75 (SEM) pmol cAMP/min.mg protein], did not alter the GHRF-stimulated rise in AC activity in old male rats, and induced a small but unequivocal rise in AC activity in old female rats (change from baseline 35% vs. 13%, respectively). Pretreatment with GHRF markedly reduced the acute effect of GHRF in the APs from young rats of both sexes (male rats, change from baseline 360% and 700%; female rats, change from baseline 230% and 430% in GHRF-pretreated and control rats, respectively). In parallel studies performed in female rats, it was shown that in vivo pretreatment with GHRF at the same schedule markedly reduced the effect of acute GHRF stimulation on GH secretion from cultured pituitary cells of young rats but left unchanged GHRF-induced stimulation of GH secretion from pituitary cells of old rats. In all, these data suggest that deficiency of endogenous GHRF synthesis and/or release may underlie defective GH secretion in old rats and that a GHRF replacement regimen that reduces the sensitivity of the young somatotrope cells does not alter the sensitivity of (male rats) or exerts a priming effect (female rats) on the old somatotrope cell.\r"

  ".W": "The natriuretic, hypotensive, and immunological properties of atrial extracts (AE) prepared from male and female, prepubertal, adult, and old rats were evaluated. Groups of animals were killed at ages 15, 25, 32, 39, 46, 56, and 290 days of age, and the atria were homogenized and extracted in 1.0 M acetic acid. Boiled, lyophilized extracts were stored and subsequently evaluated by bioassay and RIA. No sex differences (P greater than 0.05) were observed in the natriuretic, hypotensive, or immunoreactive properties of AE from rats of identical age. On the basis of bioassay determinations, no significant differences (P greater than 0.05) were observed in the natriuretic activity of AE prepared from rats of different ages. In contrast, AE-induced hypotension was significantly lower in bioassay rats receiving AE from 290-day-old rats than in rats infused with AE from 15-, 39-, or 56-day-old animals. Despite this reduced hypotensive effect, significant differences in RIA or bioassay parallelism were not observed between the tissue extracts and a synthetic atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) standard. Estimation of ANF content revealed that the quantity of ANF per heart as well as per microgram of DNA rose steadily with age. Two independent methods of ANF quantification (i.e. rat bioassay and RIA) yielded different estimates of atrial ANF content except at 15 days of age where the bioassay/RIA ratio was approximately 0.95. At 39, 56, and 290 days of age the ratios were 0.51, 0.44, and 0.53, respectively. A significant age-dependent decline in biological activity was noted when the hypotensive and natriuretic responses were normalized to an equivalent quantity of immunoreactive ANF. On the basis of these findings, we conclude that significant age-dependent differences exist in atrial ANF content and, more importantly, in the biological and immunological activity of rat AE. Since the composition of AE is not well defined, analysis of biological activity solely on the basis of RIA determinations may be insufficient to adequately evaluate the physiological properties associated with these extracts.\r"

  ".U": "88029239\r", 
  ".W": "The present study was undertaken to test the effects of TRH on thyroid hormone receptors and responses in GH4C1 rat pituitary tumor cells. TRH caused a loss of up to 32% of specific nuclear thyroid hormone binding sites with an ED50 of approximately 1 nM, and this loss was additive to the receptor down-regulation caused by T3 itself. Scatchard analysis of nuclear T3 binding revealed that 10 nM TRH decreased the concentration of T3 receptors from Bmax (femtomoles per mg protein) of 110 to 50 while receptor affinity in serum-free medium changed from dissociation constant (Kd) 110 to 50 pM with TRH. TRH lowered the GH response to 0.5 nM T3 from 215% to 127% of control. The concentrations of TRH required to decrease T3 receptors and T3 responses were similar and indicated that these TRH effects are mediated by the TRH receptor. In the absence of added thyroid hormone TRH had little effect on the rate of GH synthesis. TRH did not affect the binding of 0.5 nM [125I]T3 to receptors during the first 8 h but reduced T3 receptor occupancy up to 25-50% in different experiments after 24 h. TRH blocked the induction of GH by T3 only after 48 h or longer. When cells were incubated for 2 weeks with or without 2 nM T3 and 10 nM TRH, the stimulation of cell growth by T3 was decreased by TRH (2- vs. 5-fold increase in cell number) as was stimulation of GH by T3 (5- vs. 13-fold). As expected, T3 blunted the PRL response to TRH from 19- to 3-fold. The effects of TRH on the density of thyroid hormone receptors could be mimicked by the calcium channel agonist BAY K8644 plus a protein kinase C-activating phorbol ester which together caused a 53% reduction in thyroid hormone binding. The dose-response and temporal relationships suggest a causal relationship between the TRH-mediated decrease in thyroid hormone receptors and the decrease in thyroid hormone responses in GH4C1 cells. It has previously been shown that thyroid hormones decrease the concentration of TRH receptors and TRH responsivity in pituitary cells. The results shown here for GH4C1 cells suggest that TRH regulation of T3 responses may also be important in feedback control at the pituitary level.\r"

The relative Mr of the GEJ cell TSH receptor (TSH-R) was found to be approximately 48,000. This was confirmed by cross-linking [125I]TSH to GEJ binding sites with two homobifunctional agents: dimethyl suberimidate and disuccinimidyl suberate. We found that the cross-linked complexes had a Mr of 78,000 thus yielding a TSH-R size of 48 kilodaltons, after subtraction of the 30 kilodalton TSH, based upon the cross-linking of one TSH molecule per binding site. Moreover, the absence of a dithiothreitol effect demonstrated that the TSH binding site on GEJ cells was formed by a single chain lacking disulfide bonds. Finally trypsinization of TSH/TSH-R complexes detected two tryptic sites yielding two fragments with respective Mr of approximately 2,000 and 15,000.\r"

  ".W": "Gonadotropes from cycling female rats were studied to investigate possible mechanisms for the nonparallel release of LH and FSH. The percentages of total gonadotropes increased from 14% during estrus (E) to 18% by diestrous day 2. More of these cells became multihormonal on the morning of proestrus (P; from 46% during diestrus to 69%). Since LH-containing cells increased from 7% at E to 13.3% during early proestrus, this suggests that monohormonal FSH cells may have contributed by synthesizing LH. Gonadotrope cell areas were greatest just before the LH surge (P 1600 h). Microdensitometric measurements demonstrated that the amount and density of immunoperoxidase stain for either gonadotropin subunit were highest during the midafternoon of P. Interestingly, the amount of stain for LH continued to increase during the LH surge, suggesting that the stain had detected newly synthesized LH beta. At the same time, the average density of the LH beta stain decreased. In contrast, the amount, concentration, and density of stain for FSH beta increased during the afternoon of P and decreased during late P and early E. The percentages of granules that contained immunogold stains for only LH or FSH (monohormonal granules) at P 1600-P 1700 h were 3-4 times higher than those in diestrous rats. The percentages of monohormonal LH granules declined during the proestrous surge, whereas percentages of monohormonal FSH granules declined during the first rise (P 1900 h) and after the second rise in serum FSH (E 0800 h). Finally, the average number of gold particles per micron 2 granule area rose over the value in diestrous rats during P 1600-P 1700 h. These studies suggest that multihormonal gonadotropes support nonparallel gonadotropin release by changing the rate of subunit packaging and transit in the Golgi complex.\r"

  ".W": "This study was designed to characterize the time course of the effects of dexamethasone (2.5 mg kg-1 week-1, sc) on the renal arachidonate-prostaglandin (PG) system and to define the effect of the steroid on the interstitial cells of the renal inner medulla (RIC). The RIC are rich in triglycerides, which, due to their high content of arachidonic acid, may be a source of arachidonate for PG synthesis during conditions of phospholipase inhibition. After 1 day of dexamethasone treatment, the urinary excretion of PGE2 and PGF2 alpha was reduced to about 50% of the control value (P less than 0.05), and angiotensin II-induced release of arachidonic acid and PGs from renal medulla slices was blunted (P less than 0.05). In contrast, dexamethasone treatment did not affect ionophore A23187-induced release of PGs and arachidonic acid from renal medulla slices. By day 3 of dexamethasone treatment, urinary excretion of PGE2 and PGF2 alpha had returned to control levels, and by days 5 and 14 the excretion rates of both were clearly increased (P less than 0.05). The rise in urinary PG excretion was accompanied by a reduction of renal 15-hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase activity, augmentation of renal medulla microsomal PG synthetase activity, and diminution of renal medulla triglycerides, the latter associated with a reduction in the number of RIC and of RIC osmiophilic granules. This study demonstrates that the effects of dexamethasone on urinary PG are biphasic; this may reflect the changing balance between the opposing actions of the steroid on renal PG-synthesizing and catabolizing enzymes and the inhibitory effect on the synthesis of renal PG that is linked to activation of specific renal lipases by endogenous factors such as angiotensin II.\r"

Feeding AIMAX [N-methyl-N'-(1-methyl-2-propenyl)1,2-hydrazinedicarbothioamide; 125 mg/day] for 7 days reduced serum LH concentrations from 1.25 +/- 0.13 (mean +/- SE) to less than 0.18 ng/ml, abolished LH pulses, but did not compromise LH release in response to exogenous GnRH. Serum FSH concentrations were reduced by 27%, whereas serum concentrations of PRL, GH, thyroid hormones and cortisol were not affected after 7 days of AIMAX treatment. Behavior was not altered, aside from a slightly reduced appetite. The LH surge that peaked 48-80 h after injecting E2 benzoate (E2B) into control gilts was blocked in five of eight gilts given AIMAX. Giving GnRH pulses (1 microgram every 45 min) to AIMAX-treated gilts restored mean serum LH concentrations as well as the frequency and amplitude of LH pulses to those of untreated ovariectomized gilts. E2B suppressed the LH response to these GnRH pulses by 88% at 12 h, whereas from 24-96 h after E2B treatment, the LH response to GnRH and mean serum concentrations of LH were again similar to those of controls not given estradiol. These data indicate that induction of the gonadotropin surge by E2 in the gilt requires CNS input. The action of E2 on the pituitary in the presence of unvarying GnRH pulsation may, however, be limited to an early transient inhibition of responsiveness to GnRH, with no subsequent direct stimulation during the period of the surge.\r"

  ".W": "Processing of the TRH prohormone (Pro-TRH), a protein of approximately 26,000 mol wt, could yield 5 copies of TRH, as well as extended forms of TRH and several other non-TRH peptides. To determine whether some of these peptides are formed and transported by axons in the rat brain, we used antiserum to synthetic peptides corresponding to portions of pro-TRH. These included the N-tyrosyl analogs [Tyr0]prepro-TRH-(25-50) (pYE27) and [Tyr1]prepro-TRH-(53-74) (pYT22) contained within the N-terminal flanking region of the prohormone, the N-tyrosyl analog [Tyr0]prepro-TRH-(165-186) (pYS23), expanding the fourth progenitor sequence of TRH in the midportion of the prohormone, and the synthetic peptide pAC12 corresponding to the first 12 amino acids of the C-terminal flanking region or prepro-TRH-(208-219). All antisera showed staining in neuronal perikarya and processes in all regions of the brain previously demonstrated to immunostain for TRH, including dense innervation of the external zone of the median eminence. In addition, these antisera immunostained regions of the brain not previously immunopositive for TRH. Not all regions reactive with antiserum to [Tyr0]prepro-TRH-(25-50) were also recognized by anti-pYT, -pYS, and -pAC. These studies confirm the presence of the deduced non-TRH sequences within the TRH precursor and their formation and transport in vivo in the central nervous system. The presence of immunoreactivity in regions of the brain that do not contain TRH and the variability of immunostaining of the different antisera in some of these regions suggest regional preferential processing of pro-TRH to other peptides that may be biologically active.\r"

Since the mechanism of so-called \"runner's amenorrhea\" has not been conclusively established, the authors examined the occurrence of amenorrhea in one of the most intensively exercising groups of female runners in the United States (average, 70 miles/week): those women participating in the marathon trials for the 1984 Olympics. Nineteen percent of these Olympic runners were amenorrheic. When compared with eumenorrheic marathon runners, these amenorrheic runners were significantly (P less than 0.05) younger (24.8 +/- 1.2 [standard error of the mean] versus 30.8 +/- 0.8 years), lighter (108.4 +/- 2.5 versus 114.6 +/- 1.7 lb), and leaner (11.2 +/- 0.5 versus 12.5 +/- 0.3% body fat). There were no differences between the two groups in weekly training mileage, proportion completing the marathon trial, finishing time, basal serum prolactin, or postmarathon serum prolactin. Although basal serum cortisol was slightly higher in the amenorrheic group (26.6 +/- 0.8 versus 22.3 +/- 0.7 micrograms/dl; P less than 0.05), postmarathon serum cortisol was similar in the two groups. This study supports the concept that training intensity above a certain threshold seems to have little effect on the development of runner's amenorrhea, and vigorously training national caliber marathon runners have a lower incidence of amenorrhea than previously predicted.\r"

The 15 women without rise in any hormonal parameter were investigated further because their response was similar to the organic suprasellar disease group. Serious organic sellar/suprasellar disease was initially found in 4 women, while 2 of the remaining 11 subsequently developed previously unrecognized organic disease over the ensuing year. The authors conclude that the biochemical response to CC is useful to indicate which women with hypothalamic amenorrhea--without any other obvious clinical stigmata--should be further investigated for underlying organic disease.\r"

For some individuals, however, this stimulation may be difficult using standard superovulation protocols because of dominant follicle formation, suboptimal estradiol response, or premature luteinizing hormone surge. A group of such individuals with several previous failed attempts at superovulation were studied. Follicular stimulation was accomplished using a long-acting agonist of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) for pituitary suppression followed by human menopausal gonadotropin (hMG) for follicular stimulation. Fourteen cycles (12 IVF, 2 GIFT) were completed in 12 individuals. There were no cycle cancellations. Mean number of prior cycle cancellations per patient was 3.1 +/- 0.4. Mean number of mature oocytes recovered was 3.9 +/- 0.5. Two pregnancies resulted. Pituitary suppression with a long-acting agonist of GnRH followed by hMG appears to be an effective adjunct to current superovulation regimens.\r"

Islets obtained from cultured neonatal rat (F344) pancreas explants were transplanted bilaterally underneath the kidney capsule of Wistar-Furth rats. After 21 days these allografts did not exhibit signs of rejection. Thyroid (half lobe) from either F344 or Brown Norway rats was transplanted underneath the capsule of the remaining kidney. Transplant of the thyroid from F344 rats resulted in immediate rejection of the islet transplant, whereas transplant of the thyroid from Brown Norway rats was without effect on the islet allograft. This indicates that the thyroid contains immunocompetent cells (cells that present antigen or induce recognition of antigen) that are capable of initiating rejection of established islet allografts. The cytotoxic T-lymphocytes that result are specific for the organ bearing the immunocompetent cells at time of transplantation.\r"

The mean PA +/- SE for controls was 0.656 x 10(-5) +/- 0.13 ml.g-1.s-1 and increased by approximately 500% in galactose-fed animals to 3.13 x 10(-5) +/- 0.32 ml.g-1.s-1. Animals fed both galactose and sorbinil showed no significant difference from control animals (P greater than .05), with a PA of 0.91 x 10(-5) +/- 0.22 ml.g-1.s-1. No breach in the BRB to horseradish peroxidase was detected in any of the groups. These results demonstrate an increased permeability at the BRB to small molecules in galactosemic rats that is prevented by an aldose reductase inhibitor. This suggests that the retinal capillary basement membrane thickening seen in galactosemic rats is associated with an increased permeability of the BRB and that aldose reductase is implicated in its pathogenesis.\r"

  ".W": "The actions of sulfonylurea agents to increase peripheral glucose disposal have been classically ascribed to an ability to potentiate insulin action. However, in the BC3H-1 cultured muscle cell, tolbutamide, glipizide, and glyburide directly provoked more than a twofold increase in 2-deoxyglucose (2-DG) uptake in a dose-dependent manner in the absence of insulin. Tolbutamide (3 mM) enhanced 2-DG uptake by 130% in the presence or absence of insulin and did not significantly change insulin binding or the sensitivity of the insulin response. The onset of tolbutamide-stimulated hexose transport was seen after 30 min and reached a plateau after 12 h. Tolbutamide-stimulated glucose transport was associated with a twofold increase in the Vmax of 2-DG uptake and was completely blocked by 50 microM cytochalasin B, indicating that this action is mediated by increase in cell membrane glucose transporters. We show that sulfonylureas at therapeutic concentrations directly increase glucose transport into muscle cells. Because muscle is the major peripheral target tissue for glucose disposal, these results provide the basis for the therapeutic effect of these agents in improving peripheral glucose disposal in insulin-resistant type II (non-insulin-dependent) diabetes mellitus.\r"

  ".W": "In experimental animal models, gonadal axis lesions are probably responsible for reproductive disorders associated with diabetes mellitus. The pathogenesis of these disorders is not yet known, but it is assumed that insulin deficiency plays an important role. To check this hypothesis, we have investigated the hypothalamopituitary-gonadal axis of insulin-treated streptozocin-induced diabetic (STZ-D) rats and compared it with that of untreated diabetic and control animals. Insulin was delivered by subcutaneously implanted osmotic minipumps. Furthermore, to determine whether possible beneficial insulin effects are selectively limited to the gonadal axis or act generally, we also studied retinal microangiopathy. The hypothalamopituitary-gonadal axis of insulin-treated diabetic animals was almost unchanged. On the contrary, retinal microangiopathy was only slightly influenced by subtherapeutic insulin doses. In conclusion, continuous administration of insulin at subtherapeutic doses can successfully counteract most of the effects of diabetes on the gonadal axis. Thus, the gonadal-axis impairment in STZ-D animals appears to be related to the fall of plasma insulin below a critical level. Furthermore, the various organ systems may respond to different plasma insulin threshold levels.\r"

To examine this question, 10 young healthy subjects and 6 non-insulin-dependent diabetic (NIDDM) patients participated in each of three studies: 1) infusion of saline for 120 min followed by a 100-min hyperglycemic (125 mg/dl) clamp; 2) 120-min primed continuous infusion of GZ followed by a 100-min hyperglycemic clamp; and 3) 120-min primed continuous infusion of GB followed by a 100-min hyperglycemic clamp. The GB and GZ infusions were continued throughout the hyperglycemic clamp. Similar plasma concentrations of GB and GZ were obtained in both groups. All studies were performed with [3-3H]glucose to allow quantification of hepatic glucose production. When administered under basal conditions of glycemia, the acute phase (0-10 min) of plasma insulin and C-peptide increase in both control and NIDDM subjects was twice as great with GZ compared with GB (P less than .01). During the hyperglycemic-clamp studies performed in normal subjects, both GB and GZ increased the first- (1.6-fold) and second- (2.2-fold) phase plasma insulin responses more than hyperglycemia alone. During the hyperglycemic clamp in NIDDM subjects, the first-phase plasma insulin response was absent, and the second-phase insulin response was markedly impaired. Neither GB nor GZ improved first-phase insulin secretion in the NIDDM patients. In both NIDDM and control subjects, the effects of hyperglycemia and sulfonylurea drugs (both GB and GZ) on the first- and second-phase plasma insulin responses were simply additive.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In the inflamed colonic mucosa, oleic acid and palmitoleic acid were concomitantly decreased (p less than 0.001 and p less than 0.02, respectively), while docosahexaenoic acid was increased (p less than 0.05). Histopathological examination showed that there was a three fold increase in the cell density of inflammatory infiltrate in the lamina propria of the inflamed colonic mucosa (p less than 0.001). The cell density of inflammatory infiltrate correlated with the arachidonic acid composition of phospholipids in colonic mucosa (r = 0.89, p less than 0.005). These findings indicate that inflammation alters the long chain fatty acid composition of phospholipids in colonic mucosa. The observed increase in the arachidonic acid composition of phospholipids in inflamed colonic mucosa may contribute to the enhanced arachidonic acid metabolism in patients with active ulcerative colitis.\r"

The initial signs were localized joint pain and rapid decrease in range of motion, and the average time of onset was 12 weeks after thermal injury. Prior to the diagnosis of heterotopic ossification, all patients were managed with an exercise program of active and active-assisted movements. In patients who persisted with passive and active-assisted range of motion, especially beyond the range of pain-free movements, the ossification progressed to complete ankylosis and required surgical intervention to remove the heterotopic bone. On the other hand, postoperative patients and patients who followed a program of active exercise within the pain-free range gained excellent range of motion. It was concluded that passive stretching of the periarticular structures during the acute phase of heterotopic bone formation is detrimental to the final outcome.\r"

Using superfusion of intact amnion and chorion, we found a slight decrease in PGE and a more significant decrease in PGF release by the amniotic side of the fetal membrane obtained from women with dysfunctional labor compared to that in women with normal labor (PGE: normal labor, 2992 pg/cm2.h; dysfunctional labor, 1846 pg/cm2.h; P less than 0.05; PGF: normal labor, 662 pg/cm2.h; dysfunctional labor, 204 pg/cm2.h; P less than 0.02). Release of both prostanoids was significantly greater from the amniotic side in tissues obtained after labor compared to that in prelabor tissue. Analysis of arachidonic acid (by gas liquid chromatography) and phospholipid content (by two-dimensional thin layer chromatography) confirmed metabolic disposal of arachidonic acid from the amnion after the onset of labor. However, no difference in either phospholipid or phospholipase A2-releasable arachidonic acid of individual phospholipid classes was found in amnion tissue from women with normal and dysfunctional labor, suggesting similar activities of phospholipase A2 in these two groups. The finding of decreased free and phospholipase A2-releasable arachidonic acid of the total lipid extract of the amnion of women with dysfunctional labor could suggest further metabolic exhaustion of the substrate or failure of liberation of this fatty acid from glycerophospholipids by enzymes other than phospholipase A2, such as phospholipase C or diacyl and monoacylglycerolipases.\r"

Heat exposure (15 min) in a Finnish sauna bath at an ambient temperature of 72 C, led to an increase in plasma GH levels from 2 to 5 micrograms/L (P less than 0.01) at 30 min in the younger men. Their rectal temperature had risen by 0.2 C at 15 min. Plasma immunoreactive GHRH increased from 9 to 36 ng/L (P less than 0.05) 5 min after heat exposure, and it gradually fell to the initial levels by 45 min. The older men did not have a significant increase in plasma GH or GHRH levels in response to the heat exposure. Reverse phase high pressure liquid chromatography studies of plasma immunoreactive GHRH suggested that the major circulating GHRH immunoreactivity was GHRH-(1-40).

Mean and integrated serum LH concentrations as well as LH pulse frequency were not significantly altered (P = NS) during the thymoxamine infusion. However, we found an increase in LH pulse amplitude as both net (P less than 0.002) and percent (P less than 0.002) increment, as well as mean LH peak values (P less than 0.05) during alpha 1-adrenergic blockade. There were no significant changes in pulsatile FSH and PRL secretion or gonadal sex steroids during these experimental conditions. These data suggest that in PCO patients, 1) brain noradrenergic mechanisms do not play a stimulatory role in regulating the frequency of pulsatile LH secretion, 2) central noradrenergic activity inhibits LH pulse amplitude, and 3) PRL and FSH pulsatility are not altered by central noradrenergic blockade.\r"

  ".W": "Previous studies suggested that a relative dopamine (DA) deficiency may explain the altered LH secretory dynamics that occur in patients with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCO). These studies included findings of decreased urinary excretion of homovanillic acid (HVA), a metabolite of DA, and increased urinary excretion of 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol (MHPG), the major brain metabolite of norepinephrine. To further explore the role of DA in these patients, disulfiram (250 mg) was administered daily for 2 weeks to alter the conversion of DA to norepinephrine and to increase both peripheral and central DA in patients with PCO and in normal women. LH pulse frequency and amplitude and the serum LH response to GnRH were assessed before and during disulfiram administration. A dopaminergic effect during disulfiram administration was evidenced by a decrease in serum PRL in the PCO patients and an increase in urinary HVA excretion and a decrease in the ratio of 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol to HVA in urine in both groups (all P less than 0.05). This increase in DA did not significantly alter the serum estrogen level, the mean serum LH level, LH pulse amplitude, or serum LH responses to GnRH in either the PCO patients or the normal women. These data suggest that increasing endogenous DA does not correct the inappropriate gonadotropin secretion characteristic of PCO and places further doubt on the importance of DA in explaining the altered LH secretory dynamics in these patients.\r"

Each patient was studied on two separate occasions with continuous iv infusions of either glyburide (0.3 mg/h after a 1-mg iv bolus dose) or NaCl. During the studies blood glucose concentrations were controlled by a glucose-controlled infusion system (Biostator). The study included the 12-h period after the evening meal, followed by a 4-h period during which euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp studies were performed at two rates of insulin infusion: 1 and 10 mU/kg.min. During the glyburide infusion, the Biostator-determined insulin delivery rate was similar to that during the NaCl infusion for the first 6 h after the meal, but it decreased by 32% between the 6th and 12th hours after the meal. During the hyperinsulinemic clamp studies, glucose was delivered at a significantly higher rate when glyburide was infused; this was true for both rates of insulin infusion [5.6 +/- 1.9 (+/- SD) vs. 3.6 +/- 1.4 mg/kg.min and 12.1 +/- 2.4 vs. 9.1 +/- 2.1 mg/kg.min; P less than 0.05, glyburide vs. NaCl, respectively]. Plasma C-peptide was undetectable in all patients during both studies. These results indicate that 1) glyburide has an acute effect on insulin action in insulin-dependent diabetic patients; and 2) this effect occurs at physiological as well as pharmacological insulin concentrations.\r"

  ".W": "To appraise the physiological pattern(s) of episodic testosterone and FSH release in man, we withdrew blood samples at 10-min intervals for 24-36 h in a total of 15 normal men. We subjected the resulting FSH (15 men) and testosterone (5 men) time series to 3 statistically based and mathematically independent procedures for detecting hormone pulsatility, viz. Cluster analysis, the Detect program, and Fourier transformation. The Cluster technique disclosed discrete testosterone and FSH peaks occurring at mean (+/- SEM) interpulse intervals of 112 +/- 14 and 85 +/- 3.4 min, respectively. These values were not significantly different from the mean LH interpulse interval of 95 +/- 11 min. The average durations of the testosterone and FSH pulsations were 90 +/- 11 and 59 +/- 3 min, respectively. The mean testosterone pulse amplitude reached a maximal value of 910 +/- 92 ng/dL (31.5 +/- 3.2 nmol/L), which represented a mean increase of 242 +/- 26 ng/dL (8.4 +/- 0.9 nmol/L) above the preceding nadir. FSH pulses had a maximum of 7.2 +/- 0.3 IU/L, and an incremental amplitude of 1.3 +/- 0.1 IU/L. An independent pulse detection procedure. Detect, yielded a testosterone pulse frequency of 12.3 +/- 0.8 pulses/day [P = NS vs. Cluster program (13 +/- 1.9 pulses/day)]. The Cluster and Detect estimates of FSH pulse frequency were also similar, viz. 16 +/- 1.9 and 16 +/- 0.6 pulses/day. Further analysis by Fourier transformation revealed significant circadian periodicities for serum testosterone, FSH, and LH, which had mean nyctohemeral amplitudes of 185 ng/dL (6.4 nmol/L), 0.38 IU/L, and 1.3 IU/L, respectively. Cross-correlation analyses disclosed significantly positive uncorrected cross-correlations between LH and testosterone that were maximal at a testosterone lag of 60 min (range, 50-70 min). To eliminate high intrinsic autocorrelations within the testosterone and LH time series, stepwise autoregressive fitting was employed. The resulting partial cross-correlation matrices indicated that LH concentrations at any given instant were significantly positively correlated to testosterone concentrations lagged by 10 and 20 min. Similarly, contemporaneous LH and FSH concentrations were significantly positively correlated (r = 0.40-0.89; P less than 0.001). Moreover, autoregressive modeling disclosed significantly positive partial cross-correlations between LH and FSH at a FSH lag of 10 min. In summary, we have identified significant pulsatile as well as circadian (24-h) patterns of testosterone and FSH release in normal men.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

A better understanding of gonococcal pathogenicity is necessary for the development of an effective vaccine. Despite work on pili and outer membrane proteins no vaccine yet exists.

None of the five men and two women had known prior pulmonary hypertension. Substantial clot lysis and improvement in pulmonary blood flow, as determined by serial pulmonary angiography and perfusion lung scanning, were achieved in all. Coincident with clot lysis, pulmonary artery systolic pressure decreased (from 42 +/- 11 to 26 +/- 7 mm Hg, p less than 0.005), right ventricular diameter decreased (from 3.9 +/- 1.0 to 2.0 +/- 0.5 cm, p less than 0.005) and left ventricular diameter increased (from 3.7 +/- 0.9 to 4.4 +/- 0.6 cm, p less than 0.01). Right ventricular wall movement, initially mildly, moderately or severely hypokinetic in one, two and four patients, respectively, normalized in five and improved to mild hypokinesia in two. Tricuspid regurgitation was present before lytic therapy in six patients. In five, flow velocity in the tricuspid regurgitant jets indicated a peak systolic right ventricular minus right atrial pressure gradient of 25 to 52 mm Hg. Tricuspid regurgitation was detected early after lytic therapy in only two patients. Systolic septal flattening was noted before but not after lysis. These findings confirm that pulmonary emboli may result in appreciable right ventricular dysfunction and dilation, resultant tricuspid regurgitation, abnormal septal position and decreased left ventricular size.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Both activators are still under clinical investigation but it has become apparent that their therapeutic dose in humans is high and associated with a variable degree of systemic activation of the fibrinolytic system and fibrinogen breakdown. Therefore, the quest for further improvement of agents and therapeutic schemes continues. Research is being pursued in this area along the following lines: 1) tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA) and single chain urokinase-type plasminogen activator in molar ratios of 4:1 to 1:4 do not act synergistically on thrombolysis in a plasma environment in vitro, but display significant synergism in animal models of thrombosis. In pilot studies in patients with coronary artery occlusion, rt-PA and scu-PA are markedly synergistic and efficient thrombolysis can be obtained with a fivefold lower combined dose than that of the separate agents. The combined dose does not seem to induce systemic fibrinogen breakdown. 2) Deletion mutants of rt-PA can be constructed with a significantly prolonged half-life in vivo, and a better thrombolytic potential after bolus intravenous injection. 3) Cleavage site-specific mutants of scu-PA that abolish the conversion to urokinase may have a higher fibrin specificity. The mutants constructed thus far, however, seem to have a lower specific thrombolytic activity.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".U": "88034112\r", 
  ".W": "Pro-urokinase is a single chain, precursor form of two chain, 54,000 Mr urokinase. Although originally isolated from urine, pro-urokinase is also found in blood, where it is believed to participate in natural fibrinolysis alongside tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA). These two plasminogen activators share the property of inducing fibrin-selective plasminogen activation, but many of their other properties, including their modes of action, are dissimilar. A comparison of some of the clinically relevant properties of pro-urokinase and t-PA is provided. A multicenter, dose-finding clinical trial of native pro-urokinase is underway in the United States and in West Germany. At the time of this writing, 110 patients with angiographically proved acute coronary thrombosis have been treated. The findings from one center are summarized in some detail and the overall experience is reviewed. Preliminary evidence for a potentiating effect on pro-urokinase-induced thrombolysis by urokinase is presented. The findings suggest that a bolus of urokinase (200,000 IU) at the outset increases the reperfusion rate from 60 to greater than 80% and shortens the lysis time from about 50 to 30 minutes. A modest (19%) but significant (p less than 0.05) decrease in fibrinogen accompanied thrombolysis by urokinase/pro-urokinase. Nonetheless, significant bleeding complications in the multicenter study have, to date, not been encountered and it is suggested that this may be related to pro-urokinase's sensitivity to inactivation by thrombin and lack of potentiation by heparin.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

To decrease its antigenicity, streptokinase has been fragmented or coupled to human plasminogen or polyethylene glycols. With a plasmin B chain-streptokinase complex a more potent agent was obtained. To prolong their half-life, streptokinase and urokinase were immobilized with water-soluble carriers. Coupling urokinase with fibrin-specific antibodies increases its thrombolytic efficacy, at least in vitro. The only thrombolytic agents with a relative fibrin specificity available for clinical purposes are tissue-type plasminogen activator and single chain urokinase-type plasminogen activator. Mutants and hybrids of these molecules are being constructed and may further improve their fibrin specificity and therapeutic potential.\r"

Large scale clinical trials soon followed. Their results indicate that intravenous administration of t-PA produced by recombinant DNA technology (rt-PA) elicits coronary thrombolysis in two-thirds or more of treated patients with angiographically documented thrombotic occlusions generally without perturbing hemostatic mechanisms or inducing marked fibrinogenolysis. Bleeding is usually confined to vascular access sites and episodes of major bleeding are rare. Overall 6 week survival for treated patients with documented acute myocardial infarction may be as high as 95%.\r"

Reperfusion of the infarct-related artery was observed in 132 patients who were assessed for potential coronary angioplasty at 18 to 48 hours after treatment. Coronary angioplasty was performed in 52 patients (39%). Reasons for not performing angioplasty included unsuitable coronary anatomy, presence of residual stenosis of less than 60% and the need to perform an earlier procedure. When attempted, coronary angioplasty was successful in 96% of patients and was associated with a decrease in coronary stenosis from 85 to 30%. No patient experienced a major complication associated with coronary angioplasty. Of 36 patients undergoing predischarge coronary angiography after successful angioplasty, the infarct-related artery remained patent in 97.2%. Thus, coronary angioplasty is feasible and safe in patients who achieve coronary reperfusion after intravenous rt-PA for acute myocardial infarction. Not all patients who achieve reperfusion, however, are suitable for coronary angioplasty. When attempted, angioplasty is usually successful and associated with sustained patency of the infarct-related artery.\r"

Three strategies for the management of reocclusion are also compared. It was found that each of the following four variables can be responsible for a 2- to 15-fold variation in the costs per additional survivor: 1) the quantity of jeopardized myocardium, 2) the duration of coronary occlusion before the onset of therapy, 3) the time required from the onset of therapy until reperfusion is achieved, and 4) the reocclusion management strategy. Therapeutic strategies involving intravenous administration of thrombolytic agents were found to be consistently more cost effective than were strategies involving intracoronary administration of thrombolytic agents and primary angioplasty. In patients with a large or moderate-sized infarct, proper selection of intravenous protocols and reocclusion management strategies leads to costs of $7,000 to $100,000/additional survivor, costs that are similar to those of many generally accepted medical practices. Substantially higher costs per additional survivor are incurred with the routine use of thrombolytic therapy in patients with a small infarct or the routine use of coronary artery bypass surgery to reduce the risk of reocclusion after successful thrombolytic therapy. Decisions regarding which patients should receive thrombolysis/reperfusion therapy depend on society's willingness to pay for its incremental benefits.\r"

Therefore, the efficacy and safety of peripheral intravenous rt-PA therapy were assessed in 47 patients with angiographically documented pulmonary embolism. The drug regimen was 50 mg over 2 hours followed by repeat angiography and, if necessary, an additional 40 mg over 4 hours. By 6 hours, 44 of the 47 patients had angiographic evidence of clot lysis that was slight (n = 5), moderate (n = 12) or marked (n = 27). Among the 34 patients with pulmonary hypertension before treatment (mean pulmonary artery pressure exceeding 17 mm Hg), the pressure decreased from 43/17 (mean 27) to 31/13 (mean 19) mm Hg (p less than 0.0001). Fibrinogen decreased 33% from baseline at 2 hours and 42% from baseline at 6 hours. There were two major complications that required surgical control of bleeding: hemorrhage from a pelvic tumor and mediastinal tamponade in a patient 8 days after coronary artery bypass surgery. The initial results demonstrate that, among selected patients, peripheral intravenous rt-PA can rapidly and, for the most part, safely lyse pulmonary embolism within 6 hours.\r"

  ".W": "Disodium cromoglycate (DSCG) is a widely used drug in the treatment of allergy and asthma. Although its mode of action is not completely understood, it appears to prevent activation and release of mediators from mast cells. Neutrophils may also play a prominent role in clinical asthma and in other diseases of the airways. We have therefore studied the effect of DSCG on the activation of neutrophils from healthy adults. DSCG in concentrations of 1, 10, and 50 micrograms/ml significantly inhibited chemotaxis to zymosan-activated serum or formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine. When leukotriene B4 was used as the chemoattractant, no inhibition was found. Incubation of the cells with the drug for 30 minutes elicited the most pronounced inhibition. Since calcium is a key factor in the activation of cells, we used the calcium-specific probe Quin-2 to examine free levels of this cation after chemotactic-factor stimulation. Treatment of neutrophils with DSCG significantly reduced intracellular free calcium levels induced by zymosan-activated serum but not leukotriene B4. Thus, it appears that DSCG may function not only to stabilize mast cells in allergy and clinical asthma but also may interfere with neutrophil activation and movement into the airways.\r"

A 2-month baseline preceded 10 to 12 months of treatment. After 4 to 8 weeks of treatment, patients were encouraged to reduce bronchodilator usage. Patients used diary cards to record asthma severity, sleep difficulty, morning and evening peak expiratory flow rates, days of disruption of normal activity, use of test treatments, and concomitant medication. Significant differences favoring cromolyn sodium (p less than 0.05 and better) were observed for most of the treatment period in respect to (1) asthma severity, (2) morning and evening peak expiratory flow rates, and (3) days of disruption of normal activity. Patients receiving cromolyn sodium experienced fewer exacerbations and tended to use less concomitant medication than patients receiving placebo. Patients' opinions of treatment significantly favored cromolyn sodium. These results demonstrate the value of the addition of cromolyn sodium to existing therapy in the long-term management of asthma and endorse its use as a first-line treatment.\r"

The provision of enteral formulas with fixed percentages of nutrients that need to be restricted often results in the patient's receiving inadequate amounts of many that do not need to be restricted. One means of avoiding this problem is to use a micronutrient-free commercial solution, thus allowing the controlled addition of specific micronutrient \"modules\" needed to meet nutritional goals. There are only two formulas of this type available; however, they are more costly than any other product in our formulary and contain specific amino acid patterns developed for a specific disorder. We have designed, from macronutrient and micronutrient modules, modular tube feeding diets that can vary according to patient needs. We report on five patients treated. The protein quality (chemical score) provided by the modular diet is better than that provided by the nonmodular diet. The average daily cost to the hospital for a modular diet, including labor, is approximately one-third the cost of the nonmodular commercial diet, including labor ($7.72 vs $28.93). One anticipated difficulty is the high level of nutrition knowledge required by the prescribing individual.\r"

Because several local hospitals service regions in which 90% of the population is 65 years old or older, the annual revenues from Medicare have been reduced. The hospitals still have to meet basic overhead costs and profit margins. This has resulted in the elimination of several dietetic positions. Therefore, dietitians need to establish a cost-benefit justification for the nutrition care and support of patients. This study is the initial phase of a plan to define the nutrition care services the dietitian provides and to identify the most frequently occurring diagnosis related grouping (DRG) categories. For 3 weeks, 31 dietitians maintained logs that detailed dietetic intervention and treatment for each of the 3,827 patients seen. The nutrition care activities reported most frequently by dietitians were basic services, hospital visit and reassessment, initial consultation, and screening to rule out malnutrition. The mean time spent in all nutrition care activities ranged from 13 to 33 minutes. The most frequently occurring DRGs were those for diabetes, heart failure, circulatory disorders, specific cerebrovascular accident, and transient ischemic attacks. Overall, the type of nutrition care activities and the time spent in those activities were significantly different among the hospitals studied. The differences reflect the philosophies of each facility. The types of DRG categories observed reflect the age of the population served.\r"

Both groups of subjects consumed significantly more lysine than arginine on a daily basis. Those results are not surprising given the American population's preference for high lysine foods, such as meat and dairy products, as opposed to foods high in arginine, such as legumes, whole grains, and nuts. The mean daily intakes of lysine and arginine for the 16 subjects studied were 8.11 gm +/- 2.28 and 6.32 gm +/- 1.74, respectively. The standard deviations of the mean intakes indicate that there is a large variability in the intake of both amino acids and the ratios of the two amino acids in individual diets. This information is important, considering the conflicting results obtained previously by researchers investigating the efficacy of lysine therapy for herpes infections. The extent of the variability in total amino acid intake or ratio of lysine to arginine in the diet cannot be determined from previous studies. More important, the possible effects of these ranges on the interpretation of study results remain unknown. In order for future studies to accurately determine the effects of supplemental lysine in the treatment of herpes infections, close monitoring of dietary intake is essential.\r"

The committees are multidisciplinary with a median of nine members including two to three nurses, a physician, a social worker, a minister, an administrator, and three other members. Nearly all committees were involved in policy development and staff education. Additional functions included resident care consultation and retrospective case review. More than half of the committees are accountable to administration. Nearly all committees kept minutes. Though all committees incurred costs, only one had a formal budget. Informal evaluation is done in only six committees. No committee had referred cases to the courts.\r"

HY837, which reacts with a series of mAb directed at different epitopes on the TcR, could be induced to proliferation and interleukin 2 (IL-2) production by soluble mAb directed at the CD3/TcR complex in the absence of accessory cells. mAb directed at the CD2 epitope T11-1 were shown to block the IL-2 production by HY837, as well as the expression of the IL-2 receptor, induced by anti-CD3 mAb, resulting in the inhibition of the proliferative response. The effect of anti-CD2 mAb on the proliferative response of HY837, induced by anti-CD3 mAb, was not due to a competition for Fc binding sites. In contrast, the proliferative responses and IL-2 production of HY837, induced by mAb directed at the TcR, were shown to be enhanced by the action of the anti-CD2 mAb. These results indicate that effects mediated by anti-CD3/TcR mAb cannot always be extrapolated to antigen-mediated effects and show that anti-CD2 mAb may regulate the T cell response, induced by mAb directed at the CD3/TcR complex, depending on which part of this complex is triggered during activation.\r"

  ".W": "In previous studies we demonstrated that BALB/c mice bearing ascitic tumors of the IgE-secreting hybridoma B53 (epsilon, kappa, anti-dinitrophenyl) developed large numbers of Lyt-1-2+ Fc epsilon R(+) T lymphocytes (T cells with membrane Fc receptors) in response to the elevated serum IgE concentration. The development of Fc epsilon R(+) T lymphocytes was followed by a progressive decrease in the levels of serum IgE in spite of continued proliferation of the hybridoma cells. This sequence of events suggested that the IgE-secreting hybridoma triggered a suppressive immunoregulatory circuit of the host that inhibited IgE expression by the hybridoma cells. The present studies were undertaken to investigate the basis for the subsequent decline in serum IgE levels in mice with B53 tumors and to identify host factors that might be involved in this process. We observed that ascitic B53 cells recovered at increasing time points from BALB/c mice exhibited a selective decline in steady state levels and rates of synthesis of epsilon-heavy chain protein and mRNA. The expression of kappa-light chain protein and mRNA appeared relatively unchanged. The decrease in epsilon-heavy chain gene expression did not occur when B53 tumors were passaged in nu+/nu+ mice or in BALB/c mice depleted of Lyt-2+ cells (suppressor/cytotoxic cell lineage), but did occur in nu+/nu+ mice reconstituted with neonatal BALB/c thymus and in BALB/c mice depleted of L3T4+ cells (helper/inducer cell lineage). That Fc epsilon R(+) T lymphocytes were directly involved in the inhibition of IgE expression was supported by the earlier and more pronounced inhibition of B53 IgE in mice infused with Fc epsilon R(+) T lymphocytes. We conclude from these findings that: 1) the decline in serum IgE levels that occurs toward the end of each generation of in vivo passage of the B53 hybridoma is due to decreased production of IgE by the hybridoma cells, 2) the decreased production of IgE is due to a selective loss of epsilon mRNA expression, 3) the decrease production of IgE by B53 cells is dependent on the presence of Lyt-2+ cells, and 4) Fc epsilon R(+) T lymphocytes participate in the mechanism by which IgE production is suppressed.\r"

  ".W": "A series of heavy chain isotype switch-variant anti-CD3 monoclonal antibodies (mAb) was used to study the proliferation requirements of purified T cells. None of the variant antibodies was able by itself to induce proliferation. In the presence of exogenous interleukin 2 (IL-2) strong mitogenesis was observed upon stimulation with epsilon-anti-CD3, whereas gamma 1, gamma 2b, gamma 2a, and alpha-anti-CD3 failed to induce T cell proliferation. All variant antibodies induced vigorous proliferation in combination with phorbol myristate acetate. Purified T cells, cultured in the presence of epsilon-anti-CD3, in the absence of IL-2, did not express detectable amounts of TAC-antigen (CD25). The binding of the variant antibodies to the CD3 antigen was evaluated in cross-blocking experiments. It was demonstrated that the epsilon-anti-CD3 antibody, in comparison with the other variant mAb, has a relatively low avidity for the CD3 antigen. In modulation experiments, the IgE variant antibody was unable to induce a substantial loss of CD3 antigen. T cell triggering was investigated at the level of Ca2+ mobilization by means of the dye Indo-1. In contrast to the gamma 1, gamma 2b, gamma 2a, and alpha mAb, which induced a rapid and high rise in the free intracellular calcium level, epsilon-anti-CD3 caused a slow and low rise. These studies indicate that the epsilon-anti-CD3 antibody has a low avidity for the CD3 antigen, compared with the other variant mAb, possibly as a result of monovalent binding. Apparently, the avidity and/or valency of CD3 antigen binding not only has a major influence on CD3 modulation and anti-CD3-induced Ca2+ mobilization, but also sets T cell requirements for IL-2 responsiveness.\r"

Both T cell proliferative and antibody responses have been shown to be under major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-linked Ir gene control in inbred and MHC congenic mice. However, unlike previous examples studied, this response shows a separation of these two types of immunologic responsiveness. Only mice having I-As give potent in vitro T cell proliferative responses to type IV collagen whereas all mice except those having I-As give high antibody responses to this antigen. In (I-As X I-Anon-s) F1 mice, the T cell proliferative response was dominant, whereas antibody responses were markedly reduced compared with the responder parent. Given the recent demonstration that class II MHC-restricted, L3T4+ T cells can be divided into two sets, one of which helps for antibody responses and the other of which produces interleukin 2 and can also suppress such responses, it seems likely that these data can be accounted for on the basis of differential activation by this antigen of these two cell sets in mice of different MHC genotypes.\r"

Recent reports suggest that these cells may also influence developmental events in the course of normal erythropoiesis and granulopoiesis. The role of NK cells in the regulation of normal human megakaryocytopoiesis has not been reported, but clinical observations suggest that NK cell effects on megakaryocyte progenitors might differ from those of other cell lineages. We therefore carried out in vitro studies designed to assess the influence of NK cells on the growth of autologous megakaryocyte colony-forming units (CFU-Meg). To provide a frame of reference for these experiments, the effect of T lymphocytes, and monocyte-macrophages (M luminal diameter) on autologous CFU-Meg cloning efficiency was also studied. Purified immune effector cells were co-cultured in plasma clots with both unseparated, and progenitor cell-enriched marrow mononuclear cells (MNC) at target to effector cell ratios varying from 100:1 to 1:1. Resulting megakaryocyte colonies were enumerated by indirect fluorescence microscopy by using a rabbit anti-human platelet glycoprotein antiserum as probe for cells of the megakaryocyte lineage. The addition of NK cells to both unseparated (n = 12), and progenitor-enriched (n = 3) MNC at target to effector cell ratios of 2:1 and 1:1 resulted in a significant (p less than 0.05) augmentation in CFU-Meg-derived colony formation. Augmentation of colony formation was blocked by incubating the NK cells in Leu-11b monoclonal antibody. Stimulation appeared to be carried out by the production of a soluble growth factor which was detectable in NK cell-conditioned medium. Exposure of NK cells for 18 hr to highly purified or recombinant gamma-interferon (500 U/10(6) cells), a putative NK cell stimulator, neither increased nor abrogated the stimulatory effect. The latter could be accomplished, however, by centrifuging (200 X G for 5 min), and then preincubating the target and effector cells together for 3 hr before plating. At no time was significant inhibition of CFU-Meg demonstrated. In contrast to these results, when tested at the same ratios, and under the same conditions, no consistent effect on CFU-Meg cloning efficiency could be demonstrated by the addition of whole T cells, T cell subsets, or M luminal diameter. These results suggest that NK cells could play a role in the basal regulation of megakaryocytopoiesis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "We studied two example where indefinite graft survival could be obtained in rats. In the first, strain DA hearts were permanently accepted in allogeneic PVG rats if the recipients were treated for at least 7 consecutive days with cyclosporine A (CsA) after transplantation. In the second, DA pancreatic islets were permanently accepted in PVG rats if the islets were cultured in vitro for 14 days in high oxygen. When cultured islet-grafted PVG rats were injected with lymphocytes from other PVG rats previously sensitized to DA alloantigens, the islet grafts were destroyed within 14 days. By contrast, it was difficult to cause the DA heart allografts to cease beating with the same adoptive transfer protocol; approximately two-thirds of the heart-grafted animals maintained their grafts. This difference was not due to the CsA as cultured islets transplanted in the presence of CsA were still susceptible to rejection by sensitized lymphocytes. However, islets that had not been cultured in high oxygen prior to transplantation and that were maintained with CsA were not rejected after the injection of sensitized lymphocytes. These results suggest that CsA can most readily induce a state of tolerance when the graft is capable of initiating an immune response.\r"

Although the production of the active material was induced by stimulation with A23187 alone in A20.2J cells, both A23187 and PMA were essential for the stimulation of splenic B cells. Neither A20.2J cells nor splenic B cells produced the active material by stimulation with PMA alone. The production was inversely proportional to the concentration of fetal calf serum in culture medium. The active material produced by B cells was indicated to be IL-2 and not B cell-stimulating factor 1 (BSF-1) for the following reasons: 1) the proliferation of CTLL-2 cells in the presence of active material was inhibited by the inclusion of anti-IL-2 receptor or anti-IL-2 in culture medium but not by anti-BSF-1; 2) the material showed no co-mitogenic activity to purified splenic B cells with anti-immunoglobulins and did not support the proliferation of FDC-P2 which are known to grow in the presence of BSF-1; and 3) IL-2 mRNA could be detected in A20.2J and splenic B cells stimulated with A23187 and PMA in Northern blot analysis. Some B cell hybridomas were also shown to produce IL-2 by similar stimulation to A20.2J. Splenic B cells as well as A20.2J cells were able to produce IL-2 by stimulation with anti-immunoglobulins. These results suggest that under certain conditions IL-2 can be produced by splenic B cells, at least some subsets of B cells, and B cell lines.\r"

  ".W": "The role of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) in human B cell responses was examined and compared with that of interleukin (IL) 1 by assessing the ability of each cytokine to support proliferation and differentiation. Recombinant TNF-alpha (rTNF-alpha) and recombinant IL-1 (rIL-1) each enhanced the generation of immunoglobulin-secreting cells (ISC) in cultures of pokeweed mitogen-stimulated B cells incubated with T cells. To examine the direct effect of rTNF-alpha and rIL-1 on the responding B cell, highly purified peripheral blood B cells were stimulated with Cowan I Staphylococcus aureus (SA). In the absence of T cell factors, proliferation was minimal and there was no generation of ISC. Recombinant IL-2 (rIL-2) supported both responses. Although rTNF-alpha alone did not support SA-stimulated generation of ISC, it did increase SA-stimulated B cell DNA synthesis by two- to eightfold. In addition, rTNF-alpha augmented B cell proliferation in rIL-2 supported SA-stimulated cultures. Moreover, rTNF-alpha enhanced the generation of ISC stimulated by rIL-2 alone or rIL-2 and SA. rIL-1 also augmented DNA synthesis and generation of ISC by B cells stimulated with SA and rIL-2. However, rTNF-alpha enhanced proliferation and ISC generation in SA + rIL-2-stimulated cultures even when they were supplemented with saturating concentrations of rIL-1. Utilizing a two-stage culture system, it was found that the major effect of rTNF-alpha was to enhance responsiveness of SA-activated B cells to rIL-2, whereas it exerted only a minimal effect during initial stimulation. These results indicate that TNF-alpha as well as IL-1 augment B cell responsiveness. Moreover, the ability of rTNF-alpha to enhance B cell responsiveness was not an indirect effect resulting from the induction of Il-1 production by contaminating monocytes, but rather resulted from the delivery of a signal by rTNF-alpha directly to the responding B cell that promoted both proliferation and differentiation after initial activation. The data therefore indicate that human B cell responsiveness can be independently regulated by the action of two separate monocyte-derived cytokines.\r"

  ".W": "Supernatants from activated human T lymphocytes were highly growth inhibitory for A375 human melanoma cells. Three growth inhibiting polypeptides, transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-beta 1), interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), and oncostatin M, were isolated from the acid-soluble fraction of serum-free T cell-conditioned medium and purified by gel permeation chromatography and reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography in volatile solvents at acid pH. The purification was monitored in a growth inhibition assay. The release of TGF-beta 1 biologic activity by and the purification of IFN-gamma from the medium of activated human peripheral blood T lymphocytes have been reported. We now describe the isolation of oncostatin M from the conditioned medium of activated human T cells. The concentration of oncostatin M required for half-maximal inhibition of A375 melanoma cells was approximately 4 pM when assayed in the presence of 10% fetal bovine serum. The purified oncostatin M had an apparent m.w. 28,000 and an amino-terminal sequence that was identical with the sequence of oncostatin M isolated from supernatants of macrophage-like cells. Suboptimal concentrations of TGF-beta 1 in combination with suboptimal concentrations of IFN-gamma or oncostatin M resulted in synergistic antiproliferative responses for A375 cells (1.9 and 3.1 times the expected additive responses, respectively). Combinations of oncostatin M and IFN-gamma added simultaneously to A375 cells caused an additive growth inhibitory response. These results demonstrate that oncostatin M is a novel lymphokine, and its interaction with other cytostatic polypeptide growth inhibitors may play a role in the immune regulation of tumor cell growth.\r"

These studies reveal that although the DQ alpha and DR beta I genes of both haplotypes are identical, the DQ beta genes are very different. These data suggest that the serologic differences of these two DR7 haplotypes are the result of a recombinational event that occurred between the DQ alpha and DQ beta genes.

Using competitive chain reassociation assays in which two different L chains were allowed to compete for a limiting amount of an H chain, it was observed that different pairs of L chains tended to compete to the same degree regardless of which H chain was used as the limiting reagent and regardless of whether they were the autologous or heterologous L chain. In agreement with our previous results, it was also observed that when there was limited diversity between the Vk segments of the competing L chains, the relative competitive ability of an L chain was dictated by the nature of the first residue of the Jk segment, residue 96. However, when a high degree of diversity existed between the Vk segments of the competing L chains, the relative affinity was dictated by the V segment. It was further demonstrated that junctional diversity in the L chain may not necessarily be essential for antibody activity, determined using autologous and heterologous, noncovalently reassociated immunoglobulin molecules in antigen-binding assays. Combined with the results of the competitive reassociation assays, it was evident that no correlation between the competitive ability of these L chains existed or, by inference, the relative mutual affinity between different H-L pairs and their ability to form an antigen-binding site. These results were in agreement with the random rearrangement of VH and VL domain gene segments and argue against any restrictions in the expression of the full repertoire of immunoglobulin molecules due to combinatorial (H-L pairing) mechanisms.\r"

The VH and JH genes expressed by this antoantibody were found to be identical to germ line genes from the nonautoimmune mouse strain, BALB/c. The D gene of this autoantibody differed by one nucleotide from several members of the germ line SP2 family, but has been found in expressed D genes from several strains of mice. These results show that a normal mouse strain contains all of the structural information necessary for the expression of the heavy chain variable region of a lupus autoantibody. A fragment that is present in both BALB/c and MRL mice is highly homologous in both coding and flanking sequences to the autoantibody VH gene (VH130) and is the same size as the BALB/c germ line gene. This suggests that these two strains may share the same allele of this VH gene, despite the fact that they are polymorphic for this VH gene family. Other mouse strains that are polymorphic for this locus contained one to three VH genes that were highly related to VH130 in both coding and flanking regions. Thus, VH genes that may be allelic to the antibody VH gene or that may have arisen by gene conversion, unequal crossing over or gene duplication, are conserved in many mouse strains.\r"

  ".W": "L5178Y lymphoma cells are restrained from progressive growth in peritoneal cell (\"in vitro tumor-regressor\" PC) cultures prepared from many DBA/2 mice which harbor the tumor cells in the peritoneal cavity in a tumor-dormant state. Treatment of these PC cultures with 'antibodies to murine interferon-gamma (MuIFN-gamma) and murine tumor necrosis factor (MuTNF) but not with antibody to interleukin 2 (IL-2) receptors eliminated the restraint on tumor cell growth and permitted their progressive proliferation. L5178Y cells were found to be resistant to the direct toxic effects of large concentrations (3,000 U/ml) of MuIFN-gamma and of MuTNF, either alone or in combination. Treatment of PC cultures from tumor-dormant mice, in which tumor cells grew progressively (\"in vitro tumor-progressor\"), but not PC cultures from normal mice, with exogenous MuIFN-gamma resulted in a marked inhibition of tumor cell growth. The MuIFN-gamma-induced cytotoxic activity was cell-mediated since no soluble tumor-cytotoxic factors could be detected in the cultures. MuIFN-gamma induced cytotoxic activity in plastic-adherent peritoneal cell (AD-PC) cultures, but induced no cytotoxic activity in nonadherent-PC cultures unless small numbers (2%) of AD-PC were present, and inclusion of antibody to MuTNF in these mixed PC cultures blocked the development of cytotoxic activity. Antibody to MuTNF also blocked the development of cytotoxic activity in cultures of MuIFN-gamma-treated whole PC and AD-PC from tumor-dormant mice. These results indicate that MuIFN-gamma and MuTNF are both important in restraining tumor cell growth in PC cultures from tumor-dormant mice, and that MuIFN-gamma requires the presence of MuTNF to induce cytotoxic activity in these cultures.\r"

The cytotoxic cell mediating this activity is different, as judged by depletion studies, from the CD3+, CD8+ T cell which is targeted by anti-CD3 cross-linked to anti-target cell antibody. Targeted K cell activity from some donors is enhanced by exposure to interleukin 2 but not interferon-gamma; other donors exhibit high amounts of this activity without stimulation. Specificity of lysis mediated by targeted K cells is dictated by the specificity of the anti-target cell antibody within the heteroconjugate, and bystander cells are not lysed by targeted K cells. Hetero-cross-linked antibodies containing anti-histocompatibility leukocyte antigen class I instead of anti-Fc gamma R (CD16) do not promote lysis, suggesting that the bridging of the target cell to Fc gamma R on the K cell is required to activate the lytic process. Lysis mediated by targeted K cells is much less inhibitable by polymerized IgG than is classical antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity. Fresh human melanoma cells are lysed specifically by K cells coated with anti-Fc gamma R (CD16) cross-linked to the 96.5 anti-melanoma antibody. In vivo, targeted K cells prevent tumor growth at low effector to target ratios in Winn-type tumor neutralization assays. Targeted K cells may therefore provide a new immunotherapeutic approach for the destruction of detrimental cells, such as tumor and virally infected cells.\r"

Follicles were isolated by collagenase digestion of dermis from 5-day-old mice and purified by differential centrifugation and filtration. Purified follicles were cultured in a Type 1 collagen matrix using Medium 199 and 8% fetal calf serum as the basic nutrient. Viability of follicles was maintained in culture since the cultures incorporated thymidine into DNA and methionine into proteins for at least 7 days. Furthermore, follicles isolated from the collagen matrix after 7 days could reattach to a plastic culture substrate or be further cultivated in a fresh collagen matrix. Functional integrity of cultured follicles was maintained since some follicle-specific cytoskeletal proteins were synthesized in vitro, and follicles isolated from the collagen matrix after 7 days formed a haired skin when recombined with dermal fibroblasts and grafted to a skin site on nude mice. Only a minority of follicles appeared to produce a mature hair shaft in vitro by morphologic criteria, however, and synthesis of the total complement of hair proteins was not observed. Cholera toxin was a strong mitogen for cultured follicles, whereas epidermal growth factor was slightly mitogenic. Epidermal growth factor stimulated the release of a Type 1 collagenase by follicle cells, however. This model system provides an opportunity for the systematic analysis of factors required for the induction of hair growth and the underlying physiology of hair follicle development. This model should also be useful for studying the role of the hair follicle in skin carcinogenesis.\r"

  ".W": "In order to investigate the biologic significance of HLA-DR expression by human keratinocytes, we have examined the possibility that DR-positive keratinocytes become alloantigen presenting cells for resting T cells in the presence of interleukin-2. Using this system, gamma interferon-treated, DR-positive keratinocytes stimulate the proliferation of allogeneic, resting T cells approximately 3-fold whereas non-gamma interferon-treated, DR-negative keratinocytes do not. Because a monoclonal antibody against recombinant gamma interferon inhibits this proliferation, the stimulation is dependent on pre-incubation with gamma interferon. By contrast, since the stimulation is not inhibited by a monoclonal antibody against HLA-DR, it is not clear that the stimulation is due to class II antigen expression by keratinocytes. To rule out that gamma interferon increases the expression of class I antigens, leading to stimulation of resting T cells on that basis, we determined whether gamma interferon treatment enhances class I antigen expression by keratinocytes. The lymphokine treated cells did not demonstrate more class I antigen expression than untreated keratinocytes. Thus, the observed stimulation of allogeneic, resting T cells by gamma interferon-treated keratinocytes in the presence of IL-2 is not due to increased class I antigen expression but is due to other cell surface antigen(s) induced by recombinant gamma interferon treatment. These results suggest that gamma interferon-exposed keratinocytes in the presence of interleukin-2 may augment the activation of resting T lymphocytes and, in this manner, may contribute to cutaneous inflammation.\r"

Tyrosinase activity is 2-3 times higher, but melanin content significantly lower than in the parental Ma melanotic melanoma. Acid phosphatase activity is similar in both, but beta-glucuronidase and aryl-sulfatase A are 2-3 times higher in the hypomelanotic variant. Transplanted MI melanomas grow more slowly than the parental tumor, but metastasize with similar incidence and localization. Hypomelanotic variant melanoma cells, even those in grossly nonnecrotic parts of the transplants, show signs of low viability like swelling of the cytoplasm or cellular condensation, and disintegration. Autophagic vacuoles are numerous. They appear to be formed by enclosure of a portion of cytoplasm by cisternae of smooth endoplasmic reticulum or trans-Golgi network. These limiting cisternae contain tyrosinase as evidenced by deposition of electron dense reaction product on incubation with tyrosine or DOPA. Other sites of ultrastructural tyrosinase reaction are melanosomes and the smooth-surfaced cisternae and vesicles of the trans-Golgi network. We postulate the low cell viability, associated with autophagosome formation, is the cause for the growth retardation of the MI variant, and that the lower melanin content of these tyrosinase-rich cells is due to sequestration of a substantial portion of newly synthesized enzyme into autophagic vacuoles before it has the chance of being incorporated into melanosomes.\r"

Urokinase-type plasminogen activator, a proteolytic enzyme, has been implicated in the development of acantholysis. To test this hypothesis, we prepared a rabbit anti-urokinase antibody, which inhibited the plasminogen activator activity in normal human epidermis and in cultured keratinocytes. When added to skin organ cultures along with pemphigus IgG, anti-urokinase IgG completely prevented the development of acantholysis. Normal or preimmune rabbit IgG had no effect on pemphigus IgG-induced acantholysis. Plasminogen activator converts the zymogen plasminogen to its active form plasmin, a broad specificity serine proteinase. When high concentrations of plasminogen alone were added to skin organ culture, acantholysis of the pemphigus foliaceous type was induced. Anti-urokinase antibody also inhibited plasminogen-induced acantholysis. These results strongly support a pivotal role for plasminogen activator in the development of acantholysis.\r"

Detailed studies of fibrinolysis in DIC are lacking, however. We measured tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) antigen and activity levels in 74 patients with DIC, 53 hospitalized patients with similar illnesses without DIC, and 36 healthy normal subjects, using sensitive, specific assays. Mean t-PA antigen levels were significantly higher in patients with DIC than in either hospitalized control subjects or normal individuals in most disease categories studied. Highest t-PA antigen levels were seen in patients with liver disease, but patients with DIC without liver disease also had significantly elevated t-PA antigen. Detectable free t-PA activity was infrequently seen in patients with DIC, however. No correlation was found with either thrombotic or hemorrhagic complications and levels of t-PA antigen or activity in DIC, with the possible exception of increased t-PA activity in two patients with intracranial hemorrhage. Bleeding complications were seen almost exclusively in patients with underlying anatomic lesions, and thrombotic complications were usually associated with other known predisposing factors. We conclude that t-PA antigen is usually elevated in DIC, but free t-PA activity is infrequently seen, most likely because of increased levels of t-PA inhibitor. The presence or absence of free t-PA activity does not appear to predict which patients with DIC will develop hemorrhage or thrombosis.\r"

  ".W": "Obstructive lymphedema is a pathologic condition resulting in the accumulation and stagnation of serum proteins in the lymphatics and interstitial spaces. In a canine model of obstructive lymphedema, one limb was rendered lymphedematous, and various biochemical parameters were determined in this and an unaffected control limb. Both lymph and interstitial fluid had significantly decreased acid proteinase activity (comprising mostly cathepsin D-like enzymes) and neutral proteinase activity (comprising metallo, sulfhydryl, and serine proteinases, and collagenase). Possible reasons for these decreases could be: (1) saturation of macrophages and their surrounding environment with whole or partially digested proteins, or (2) elevation in the levels of circulating inhibitors like alpha 2-macroglobulin. The lymphedematous skin was significantly thicker than control skin and had elevated levels of collagen. However, unlike some fibrotic conditions, the relative proportions of types I, III, and V collagen, as determined by pepsin solubilization and neutral salt fractionation of the collagen fibrils, were similar to those found in normal skin. It is speculated that a decrease in the breakdown of collagen by collagenase and a continuing synthesis of collagen by fibroblasts led to an imbalance in favor of collagen deposition in the skin.\r"

We also examined net sodium and potassium movement in sodium-loaded, potassium-depleted, red cells. Treatment with hydrochlorothiazide resulted in a significant increase in mean ouabain-sensitive ATPase activity (+/- SEM) from 118.4 +/- 14.6 to 158.1 +/- 15.3 nmol phosphate released per milligram of protein (P = 0.0004). Ouabain-resistant ATPase did not change. Net sodium extrusion rose significantly, from 1.62 +/- 0.27 to 2.32 +/- 0.33 mmol/L/hr (P = 0.0275). We postulate that the enhanced activity of the Na,K pump results from the volume contraction induced by the diuretic. This interpretation is consistent with the concept that the Na,K pump is inhibited in volume expansion and volume-expanded hypertension. The finding of enhanced pump activity in subjects given treatment with hydrochlorothiazide suggests a possible mechanism of the antihypertensive action of diuretic therapy.\r"

Although the mechanism of death from tocainide intoxication in animal studies is related to central nervous system toxicity, the presentation of ventricular tachyarrhythmias with coma in this patient suggests that tocainide at high levels may have primary myocardiotoxicity in humans.\r"

Major seizures were more often associated with post-epileptic headaches than minor attacks. Nine patients in this series of 100 also had migraine: in eight of these nine a typical, albeit a mild, migraine attack was provoked by fits. The post-ictal headache in the 40 epileptics who did not have migraine was accompanied by vomiting in 11 cases, photophobia in 14 cases and vomiting with photophobia in 4 cases. Furthermore, post-epileptic headache was accentuated by coughing, bending and sudden head movements and relieved by sleep. It is, therefore, clear that seizures provoke a syndrome similar to the headache phase of migraine in 50% of epileptics. It is proposed that post-epileptic headache arises intracranially and is related to the vasodilatation known to follow seizures. The relationship of post-epileptic headache to migraine is discussed in the light of current ideas on migraine pathogenesis, in particular the vasodilation which accompanies Leao's spreading cortical depression.\r"

  ".W": "Fifty-one brain-injured patients with peak 24-hour admission Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) scores of 4 to 10 were prospectively randomly assigned to receive total parenteral (TPN) or enteral (EN) nutrition. Patients were studied from hospital admission to 18 days postinjury. Outcome was assessed by the Glasgow Outcome Scale at 3 months, 6 months, and 1 year postinjury. The TPN group received a significantly higher cumulative mean intake of protein than the EN group (mean +/- standard error of the mean: 1.35 +/- 0.12 vs. 0.91 +/- 0.9 gm/kg/day; p = 0.004). Mean cumulative caloric balance was also significantly higher in the TPN than in the EN group (75.6% +/- 5.13% vs. 59% +/- 4.26%; p = 0.02). Nitrogen balance was significantly more negative in the EN group during the 1st week postinjury (p = 0.002). The incidence of pneumonia, urinary tract infections, septic shock, and infections was not significantly different between groups. Classic nutritional assessment parameters such as anergy screens, total lymphocyte counts, and albumin levels were not significantly different between groups. The 11 patients in the EN group who did not tolerate tube feedings for 1 week postinjury had a significantly higher incidence of septic shock (p = 0.008). The change over time in GCS scores between groups was significantly different, with the TPN group showing a mean four-point increase in GCS score compared with a three-point increase in the EN group (p = 0.02). At 3 months the TPN group had a significantly higher percentage of favorable outcomes (43.5% vs. 17.9%, respectively; p = 0.05). At 6 months, 43.5% of the TPN group had a favorable outcome while 32.1% of the EN group had a favorable outcome (p = 0.29). By 1 year, 47.8% of the TPN group and 32.1% of the EN group had a favorable outcome (p = 0.20). In conclusion, more calories and protein usually can be administered to acute brain injury patients via the TPN route than by EN feedings via nasogastric or nasoduodenal routes. Traditional parameters for nutritional assessment are not useful in studying the efficacy of nutritional support during the first 2 weeks after head injury. Neurological recovery from head injury occurs more rapidly in patients with better early nutritional support.\r"

Two false-positive instances and one false-negative instance of uptake are described. The planning of the surgical approach and placement of graft material for spinal fusion was assisted by SPECT in two patients. One patient with disability secondary to recurring abdominal pain had detection of the causative lesion by SPECT and subsequent relief of her symptoms following excision of the tumor. SPECT imaging of soft-tissue tumors of neurofibromatosis appears to have potential use in preplanning surgery on structural or cosmetic lesions, in the detection of occult lesions, and the monitoring of patients with neurofibromatosis at regular intervals.\r"

They bring physicians into a more active role with the largest group of employees in the hospital (nurses); giving them the opportunity to acquire a better appreciation of the objectives, goals, and constraints of other providers and of the institution as a whole. When nurses and other employees begin to appreciate the constraints placed on physicians by federal regulations and competition, mutual understandings are fostered. They lay a more solid foundation for good professional relationships between hospitals and IPAs and between hospital-based physicians and independent practitioners. They encourage the focus of all providers on quality patient care (at a price the community is willing to afford). They discourage the overlap of expensive services between providers and encourage planned growth for the community. They encourage collaborative practice at the bedside, at committee and board meetings, and throughout the community that can lead to the development of a new model of \"health\" care as opposed to \"disease\" care. Finally, they promote human understanding that encourages providers to recognize the appropriate professional (considering all the variables) for each role. Without such efforts, it appears that patient care quality will be the most likely aspect of health care to suffer in the future--a result against which all health care professionals should stridently guard.\r"

Loss of radioiodine from the whole animal and thyroid gland was slower when mice were fed the toxic palmitoyl glycerol diet than when fed the same diet containing 4% safflower oil. However, mice fed the two diets did not differ in the extent of the incorporation of radioiodine, and essentially all was bound to protein in each case. Follicular thyroid cells from mice fed the potentially toxic diet that contained unsaturated fat were normal in appearance. Conversely, cells from mice fed the toxic diet were smaller and more densely stained, showing evidence of glycoprotein inside the cell. These findings show that the thyroid gland is affected by the palmitoyl glycerol diet. However, the thyroid is not the only organ affected, because giving either thyroxine or triiodothyronine had no effect on the toxicity of palmitoyl glycerol.\r"

Regardless of the presence of hyposmia, patients without testicular enlargement (less than 2 cm3), had serum luteinizing hormone (LH) responses to luteinizing hormone-releasing factor (LRF) that were the same as in prepubertal boys. By contrast, five boys with testicular enlargement (greater than 2 cm3), some of whom had hyposmia, had a greater serum LH response to LRF than did prepubertal boys. Adrenarche was moderately delayed; although all boys initially had normal serum levels of dehydroepiandrosterone-sulfate, four boys eventually developed elevated serum levels. Bone ages were delayed compared with chronologic age in boys who had the condition after 15 years of age. The rate of linear growth was normal, and final adult heights were normal with testosterone therapy, although linear growth continued longer in these boys than in boys with normal pubertal progression. Although none of the patients was obese at the time of diagnosis, three patients developed obesity after initiation of testosterone therapy.\r"

Initial mean selenium levels in serum and hair were 38 +/- 11 (SEM) ng/mL and 0.34 +/- 0.13 micrograms/g, respectively. Mean serum vitamin B12, folate, and vitamin E levels were normal. Intravenous supplementation with selenium was begun daily at 2 micrograms/kg/day. After 3 to 6 months, serum selenium levels rose almost threefold to 81 +/- 22 ng/mL. During this same time, erythrocyte mean corpuscular volume fell from 115 +/- 8 fL to 88 +/- 7 fL in the three children with macrocytosis. After 6 to 12 months of supplementation, hair selenium content had increased threefold to 1.02 +/- 0.19 micrograms/g. The two children with decreased pigmentation became darker skinned and their hair color changed from blonde to dark brown; a third child's hair, which had been blonde, also became darker. Transaminase and creatine kinase activities returned to near normal in those affected and, in the one child with severe myopathy, muscle weakness improved. Erythrocyte macrocytosis and loss of skin and hair pigmentation are previously undescribed manifestations of selenium deficiency. We recommend routine supplementation of TPN solution with selenium to avoid the clinical and biochemical syndrome of selenium deficiency in patients receiving long-term TPN.\r"

  ".W": "To examine the effect of a soybean oil emulsion on essential fatty acid, lipid, and glucose metabolism, preterm infants were randomized to receive 0.5 g/kg/d lipid for 5 days (n = 10, group 1) or 0.5 increased to 2.0 g/kg/d over 5 days (n = 11, group 2). Triene/tetraene ratios did not change in group 1, but decreased in group 2. In both groups, plasma phospholipid linoleate (percent and micrograms per milliliter) increased, the increase being greater in group 2. In both groups, percent content of arachidonate and 5,8,11-eicosatrienoate decreased, and that of oleate remained unchanged. In contrast, absolute content of arachidonate and oleate tended to increase, and that of 5,8,11-eicosatrienoate remained unchanged. At a lipid intake of 0.5 g/kg/d, no infants had hyperlipemia. When lipid intake exceeded 1.0 g/kg/d, the frequency of hypertriglyceridemia (triglycerides greater than 200 mg/dL) and free fatty acidemia, with the free fatty acid/molar albumin ratio exceeding 6:1, increased. Plasma glycerol increased slightly, but was substantially less than the rise in enzymatically determined triglycerides. Hyperglycemia was self-limiting and did not require alteration in dextrose intake. Thus, (1) infusion of a soybean oil emulsion at 0.5 to 2.0 g/kg/d maintains essential fatty acid status and phospholipid arachidonate concentrations; (2) significant hyperlipemia occurs when lipid intake exceeds 1.0 g/kg/d; (3) hyperglycemia associated with lipid infusion tends to be self-limiting and may not require alteration in lipid or dextrose intake; and (4) enzymatically determined triglycerides may be used to monitor lipid tolerance, provided that allowance is made for a small but systematic overestimation resulting from the rise in plasma glycerol.\r"

  ".W": "The biologic half-life of gold, a subject of controversy for many years, was found to be much longer in the rat than that reported for other species in the bulk of the literature. The longer observed half-life supports recent findings in man and is more consistent with the monthly maintenance dosing normally used in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Excretion studies revealed that, after administration of gold sodium thiomalate, gold was eliminated via urinary and fecal pathways by approximately a 2:1 ratio. The relative importance of these pathways was not altered after multiple dosing. Biliary and intestinal excretion studies were performed to identify the means by which gold is eliminated via the feces. Only a small percentage of the dose was recovered from the bile after 2 hr, and biliary excretion was shown to be dose dependent. Results suggest that passive diffusion may be responsible for plasma-to-bile transfer and stand in contrast to the results of similar studies on other metals. Administration of gold as gold chloride [Au(III)] instead of gold sodium thiomalate [Au(I)] did not alter the excretion into bile, nor did stimulation of metallothionein, a metal-binding protein in the liver and kidney, by Cd pretreatment. Intestinal excretion was shown to be an insignificant pathway of gold elimination. The results of these studies suggest that, at high doses, gold-binding sites on plasma proteins may be saturated, resulting in an increase in excretion into the urine and bile, as well as an increase in distribution to peripheral tissues where tissue binding results in an overall increase in half-life.\r"

Intact tracheal strips were contracted slightly by low concentrations of arachidonic acid (10(-8) to 10(-5) M), but higher concentrations relaxed them. In contrast, when tracheal strips were precontracted with histamine or carbachol, exogenous arachidonic acid had no effect on epithelium-free preparations but induced concentration-dependent (10(-8) to 10(-4) M) relaxation of intact tracheal strips. The effects of arachidonic acid both in epithelium-free and epithelium-containing trachea were blocked by either indomethacin (10(-6) M) or aspirin (10(-4) M). Studies on the effects of exogenous arachidonic acid, performed with a \"sandwich protocol,\" demonstrated that the postulated airway epithelium-dependent relaxant factor released by an intact tracheal strip relaxes an adjacent epithelium-free strip in the same organ bath. This relaxation is antagonized by indomethacin suggesting the involvement of a cyclooxygenase product in this phenomenon. Comparison of concentration-response curves for contractile agonists in epithelium-free preparations and in one containing epithelium suggests the mobilization of airway epithelium-dependent relaxant factor by histamine but not by carbachol. The effects of cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase inhibitors indicated that both relaxant and contractile arachidonic acid metabolites are generated by epithelial and nonepithelial cells alike in response to contractile agonists.\r"

CV-3988 (3 mg/kg i.v.), given 1 min after PAF was injected, was also effective, but no so effective when given 5 min later. Dexamethasone (2 mg/kg i.v. 3 hr before the PAF-injection), naloxone (1 and 10 mg/kg i.v. 5 min before), FPL-55712 (10 mg/kg i.v. 5 min before) and BW-755c (300 mg/kg p.o. 1 hr before) also improved the survival rate, but aspirin (100 mg/kg p.o. 1 hr before) did not. In anaphylactic shock, CV-3988 (0.3-3 mg/kg i.v.), given 5 min before and 5 min after rechallenge with antigen protected the sensitized mice from death (ED50, 1.2 and 0.48 mg/kg, respectively). Dexamethasone and naloxone protected mice from anaphylactic shock, but BW-755c and FPL-55712 had no protective effects. In contrast to CV-3988, dexamethasone and naloxone were ineffective when given 5 min after the rechallenge. Congestion of the lung, kidney and heart and infiltration of neutrophils in the lung were marked in mice with PAF-induced and anaphylactic shock. The related histology showed an improvement with CV-3988. These results strongly suggest that PAF may play a lethal role in anaphylactic shock and that CV-3988 may be an effective preventing agent.\r"

We provide evidence that the irreversible modification of 5-HT2 serotonin receptors by N-ethoxycarbonyl-2-ethoxy-1,2-dihydroquinoline occurs at the ligand binding site and that this treatment does not appear to affect the interaction of these receptors with their guanine nucleotide regulatory protein. Senescent rats exhibited significantly reduced (-20%) maximum receptor density levels of 5-HT2 receptors compared with their mature counterparts. The time course of recovery of [3H] ketanserin binding to 5-HT2 receptors after irreversible receptor modification by a single peripheral injection of N-ethoxycarbonyl-2-ethoxy-1,2-dihydroquinoline was significantly slower in senescent rats. The slower recovery was a function of decreases in both the receptor production rate and the degradation rate constant in senescent rats compared with mature rats. Interestingly, chronic reserpine treatment resulted in a significant decrease in control maximum receptor density values in both mature (-17%) and senescent (-18%) rats. Although the receptor production rate and receptor degradation rate constants in both mature and senescent reserpinized rats were slightly decreased, there was no significant change in the overall rates of receptor recovery when compared with their respective age-matched nonreserpinized counterparts. These data indicate that both the steady state levels and \"turnover\" of 5-HT2 receptors are decreased in senescence and that these receptors can be down-regulated by chronic reserpine treatment.\r"

Successful treatment results with each drug were 6 of 24 thiotepa, 0 of 7 mitomycin, 0 of 6 doxorubicin and 3 of 8 bacillus Calmette-Guerin. Treatment failure was associated with disease progression to muscle invasion, adjacent organ invasion or metastases in 7 patients (27 per cent).

Cost-effectiveness was highest for younger patients, for those with additional coronary risk factors (eg, smoking or hypertension), and for those whose course of therapy is of less-than-lifelong duration. Conversely, it is lowest for older patients, for those with no additional coronary risk factors, and for those who are treated for a lifetime. Our results suggest that pharmacologic therapy may not be cost-effective for all patients with elevated cholesterol levels, especially those over 65 years of age. For many younger patients, however--those with additional coronary risk factors and more severe elevations in cholesterol levels--the cost-effectiveness of therapy may be comparable with other accepted medical practices.\r"

  ".W": "Four dressing regimens for peripheral venous catheters were studied in a prospective randomized clinical trial with 2088 Teflon catheters: (1) sterile gauze, replaced every other day, and three dressings left on for the lifetime of the catheter; (2) gauze; (3) a transparent polyurethane dressing; and (4) an iodophor-transparent dressing. The four dressings provided comparable coverage, except moisture accumulated more frequently under the transparent dressings (26% to 28% vs 20% to 21%). Cutaneous colonization under the dressing was low level and comparable with all four dressings (range, 10(0.58) to 10(0.70) colony-forming units). The rate of local catheter-related infection (greater than or equal to 15 colony-forming units) was also low and did not differ significantly (range, 4.6% to 5.9%); no catheter caused bacteremia. Stepwise logistic multivariate analysis showed cutaneous colonization of the insertion site (relative risk [RR] of infection, 3.86), contamination of the catheter hub (RR, 3.78), moisture under the dressing (RR, 2.48), and prolonged catheterization (RR, 1.75) to be significant risk factors for catheter-related infection. These data indicate that it is not cost-effective to redress peripheral venous catheters at periodic intervals; for most patients, either sterile gauze or a transparent dressing can be used and left on until the catheter is removed.\r"

  ".W": "The prevalence of protein-calorie malnutrition (PCM) and micronutrient deficiency (MND) at the time of admission and discharge from hospital was evaluated in 91 patients consecutively admitted to the Surgery Clinic of the University Hospital of Rome. Anthropometric parameters and circulating levels of vitamins (A, E, C, B1, and B2) and visceral proteins [retinol-binding protein (RBP, prealbumin (PA), and transferrin] were measured. Twenty-one patients (23%) had moderate to severe PCM, and 70 patients (77%) had normal nutritional status (NNS) at admission. Two patients with PCM died in the hospital. At discharge, the prevalence of PCM was unchanged in the remaining 19 patients. Single or multiple MND was observed initially in 71% of patients with PCM and in 36% with apparently normal nutritional status. Despite vitamin supplementation, MND was present at the time of discharge in 73% of patients with PCM and 44% with NNS. Nutritional status at the time of admission was assessed in hospitals in six different Italian cities. The criterion for admission to the study was the diagnosis of chronic (greater than 1 yr duration) illness (excluding cancer and multiple organ disorders). Two hundred eighty-four patients (145 males, 139 females), ages 25-88 yr, were selected. The findings indicated a high prevalence of MND (64%). Also, in disorders that usually do not have significant alterations of digestion or absorption, such as uncomplicated cardiorespiratory disease, the prevalence of MND was high (9-38%). The prevalence of MND was not related to body mass index (BMI). PCM was more common among patients with chronic gastrointestinal disease.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The measurement of body composition by multiple isotope dilution provides an accurate and precise measure of both the nutritional state and the response to nutritional support. A multiple isotope dilution technique has been developed that permits measurement of the three major components of body composition: body fat, extracellular mass (ECM), and body cell mass (BCM). Normal body composition was defined by data obtained in 25 healthy volunteers. Malnutrition is characterized by a loss of BCM and an expansion of the ECM, and as a result the lean body mass is not significantly different from normal. The loss of body weight with malnutrition therefore often reflects the loss of body fat. The utility of body composition measurements was demonstrated by determining the effect of total parenteral nutrition on body composition to determine the relationship between caloric intake and the change in the BCM. A statistically significant relationship was developed which demonstrated that a caloric intake in the range of 30-40 cal/kg/day is required for maintenance. To restore a depleted or malnourished BCM requires a caloric intake in excess of that required for maintenance. The measurement of body composition by multiple isotope dilution is complex and time consuming, and requires specialized laboratory facilities and specially trained personnel. As a result, these measurements are not suited for routine patient management, but should rather be reserved for research purposes.\r"

Whole body potassium can be measured by whole body counting without irradiating the subject; it is an index of body cell mass. We measured whole body nitrogen, potassium, extracellular water, intracellular water, and fat-folds. The differences between 37 malnourished patients and five normal subjects suggested that the patients had 9 kg less cell mass than normal, but no difference in extracellular mass. Measurements were made on eight patients before and after 14 days of total parenteral nutrition; balance of nitrogen intake and excretion also was measured. The changes were consistent with mean increases of 3 kg of cellular mass and 3 kg of fat with no change of extracellular mass. The accuracy and sensitivity of the whole body measurements need further confirmation for use in patients with changing body composition. Where tissue wasting is largely from the cellular compartment, potassium could be a more sensitive index of wasting than nitrogen. Multielement analysis of nitrogen, potassium, chlorine, and carbon will probably be valuable in elucidating body composition in malnutrition.\r"

Re-rejection episodes and other adverse reactions, probably secondary to T cell activating potential of anti-T3, continue to be clinical problems with anti-T3 therapy. We therefore examined the relative efficacy of cyclosporin A (CSA), methylprednisolone (MP), or 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP), at concentrations that are readily accomplished in clinical practice, on the activation of T cells by anti-T3. CSA or MP mediated marked and 6-MP mediated modest inhibition of anti-T3 induced proliferation of alloimmune memory T cells. CSA- or MP-inhibited anti-T3 elicited specific secondary cytolytic activity and natural killer (NK) cell activity, and 6-MP failed to prevent the augmentation of NK cell activity mediated by anti-T3. The immunosuppressants also exhibited differential effects on anti-T3-associated lymphokine production by peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Interleukin 2 production was completely inhibited by CSA, modestly inhibited by MP and not inhibited by 6-MP. Interferon gamma production was completely inhibited by CSA or MP and not inhibited by 6-MP. Our findings, in addition to providing a plausible immunological basis for some of the complications of anti-T3 therapy, provide experimental support for therapeutic strategies that include the use of CSA and/or MP along with anti-T3.\r"

Tocainide and mexiletine are similar to lidocaine and are as effective as quinidine in patients with ventricular arrhythmias. Encainide and flecainide are superior to quinidine for the control of ventricular ectopic beats and as effective as quinidine for patients with ventricular tachycardia. Amiodarone is the most effective agent available for treating patients with ventricular tachycardia, but it is also the most toxic antiarrhythmic agent and should be used only when other antiarrhythmic drugs have not been effective or tolerated.\r"

Among newly diagnosed untreated patients, a high immunofluorescence LI distinguished those with multiple myeloma (MM) from those with stable monoclonal gammopathies (P less than 0.002). Among treated patients with MM, those in the plateau phase of the disease had low LI, whereas patients in the relapse phase or early in treatment had high LI. The immunofluorescence LI correctly classified three more patients with newly diagnosed MM than did the tritiated thymidine LI technique. LI specific for the neoplastic plasma cells resulted in excellent discrimination of patients with active disease. Because results are easily and rapidly obtained, this technique is useful clinically.\r"

The cytochemical panel consisted of peroxidase, toluidine blue, chloroacetate esterase, aminocaproate esterase, tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase, and immunoalkaline phosphatase for platelet/megakaryocyte-specific antigen. The unusual cytologic features of leukemic cells in cases similar to our 10 cases have caused considerable diagnostic difficulties. In our 10 cases, however, the effective use of cytochemical studies helped to achieve accurate identification of the various types of leukemic cells. We conclude that the intelligent application of cytochemical techniques continues to be useful for the accurate cytodiagnosis of hematopoietic neoplasms.\r"

Specific antitumour therapy was at the discretion of the clinician and variable. An interim analysis was made after a median follow-up of 13 months in the APD group and 14 months in the controls. There was a significant reduction in pathological fractures and severe bone pain in the APD group, and hypercalcaemia was prevented. Consequently the necessity for radiotherapy for skeletal complications was more than halved; the number of systemic therapy changes was also reduced. Gastrointestinal side-effects of APD led to a drop-out of 8% of patients. Oral supportive APD therapy is simple and convenient, and significantly reduced skeletal morbidity in advanced breast cancer.\r"

The inhibitory action of both bradykinin and nitric oxide was abolished by haemoglobin, but not by aspirin, and was potentiated by superoxide dismutase to a similar degree. It is suggested that the effect of bradykinin is mediated by the release of nitric oxide from the endothelial cells, and that nitric oxide release contributes to the non-adhesive properties of vascular endothelium.\r"

Our recent partial characterization of the gene at the molecular level, along with prior genetic and biochemical evidence, recently provides compelling evidence that the gene codes for the enzyme cAMP phosphodiesterase. The observation that the gene encodes at least six overlapping poly(A)+ RNA molecules ranging in size from 4.2 to 9.5 kilobases (kb) (ref. 8), suggests that the gene is extraordinarily complex. Here we provide the sequence of a dunce complementary DNA clone and the corresponding genomic coding regions which show that the organization of the gene is elaborate. The cDNA clone defines dunce exons which are separated by a large intron of 79 kb. More importantly, at least two other genes are shown to reside within the large intron, including the well-defined glue protein gene, Sgs-4. The location of dunce exons relative to the molecular breakpoints of chromosomal aberrations with defined cytological positions indicates that the dunce gene extends over more than five polytene chromosome bands.\r"

  ".W": "Friend murine leukaemia virus complex (FV) causes an immunosuppressive retrovirus-induced disease. In certain mouse strains, FV shows striking similarities to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection in man in that infected mice have severe T-cell immunosuppression but also develop virus-neutralizing antibodies incapable of eliminating infected cells. Previously we noted the influence of mouse major histocompatibility complex (H-2) genes on both FV-induced immunosuppression and on ability to protect mice against FV by immunizing with a vaccinia-Friend murine leukaemia helper virus (F-MuLV) envelope (env) recombinant virus. Here we show that different subregions of H-2 are involved in susceptibility to virus-induced immunosuppression (H-2D subregion) and protective immunization with a recombinant vaccinia virus (H-2K or I-A subregions). Thus, susceptibility to virus-induced immunosuppression does not preclude protection by vaccinia-Friend immunization. The mechanism of protection seems to involve priming of immune T cells, and not initial induction of neutralizing antibodies or cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) (ref.2). Subsequent virus challenge generates a secondary response, resulting in appearance of IgG antibodies and CTL. In human HIV infection there could also be host genetic influences on elements of disease pathogenesis, such as immunosuppression, and on the success of T-cell priming by potential protective vaccines.\r"

  ".W": "Mobile genetic elements are found in the genomes of many organisms, and because of their effects on genes and their ability to induce chromosomal rearrangements they are an important source of genetic variability. Transposition rates are usually found to be low, estimated at around 10(-3) per generation. Higher rates of transposition are observed, however, in crosses between certain strains of Drosophila melanogaster ('hybrid dysgenesis'), which can lead to a dramatic rearrangement of many mobile elements ('transposition bursts'). We have studied the chromosomal distribution of mdg-1 and copia mobile elements in 17 highly inbred lines of D. melanogaster, after 69 generations of sib-mating. Most lines show no changes, but one showed a complete reshuffling of the copia element. We conclude that the transpositions of the copia element in this line occurred rapidly in a few generations. This phenomenon, distinct from 'transposition bursts' in that only copia elements are involved, may account for the instability sometimes observed in inbred lines and may be important in creating genetic variability in highly homozygous populations.\r"

We find that under conditions where there is significant target cell killing in the absence of Ca2+, there is no detectable serine esterase release. To the extent that serine esterase and perforin-like molecules reside in the same granules, these results also suggest that target cell killing may occur in the absence of degranulation. Our results provide an example of target cell killing without serine esterase release, and the first indication that lysis and degranulation can be functionally dissociated.\r"

Both CTL and cytotoxic large granular lymphocytes have cytolytic granules, containing the cytolytic molecules 'perforin' and 'cytolysin'; perforin and cytotoxic lymphocytes can damage target cells through the membrane assembly of pores. The description of proteases which are cytotoxic cell-associated and granule-located has supported the granule exocytosis model of cytotoxicity mediated by cytotoxic lymphocytes, and has emphasized the similarities between cell-mediated and complement-mediated cytotoxicity. But recent experiments have challenged the importance of lytic granules and perforin in CTL activity. Here we report that CTL can be triggered to deliver a lethal hit to target cells even when exocytosis of lytic granules has been abolished by removal of extracellular calcium. This dissociation of exocytosis of granules and delivery of the lethal hit suggests that cytolytic granules may not be involved in target-cell lysis by CTL.\r"

Thymocytes can be divided into four major compartments on the basis of surface expression of the murine equivalents of CD8 (Lyt-2) and CD4 (L3T4) (refs 1,2). Functionally mature thymocytes express only CD4 or CD8. The CD4-8- subset contains progenitor cells capable of giving rise to all the phenotypic and functional classes of T cells on adoptive transfer. The function of the major population, the CD4+8+ cells, which carry both the CD4 and CD8 antigens, in thymic differentiation is controversial. It has been variously proposed that they represent terminally differentiated cells which die in the thymus or that they represent an intermediate stage and can differentiate into functionally and phenotypically mature single positive T cells. The CD3-antigen receptor complex is probably important in thymic differentiation. The receptor has two functions: recognition and transmembrane signalling. To help clarify the function of CD4+8+ thymocytes in thymic differentiation, the expression and function of the antigen receptor complex on these cells should be determined. We show here that most CD4+8+ thymocytes express CD3 which functions in transmembrane signalling. The consequences of this signalling differ from those in mature T cells, however, in that the CD4+8+ cells do not secrete IL-2, express IL-2 receptor, or proliferate.\r"

  ".W": "There has been interest in the potential of synthetic compounds to modify immune responses by imitation of cytokine action. Direct administration of interleukin 2 (IL-2) in conjunction with adoptive transfer of lymphokine activated killer cells has been used in the treatment of cancer, but there are toxic effects resulting from the high doses of IL-2 required. We have developed a new synthetic compound, ammonium tri-chloro(dioxoethylene-O,O'-)tellurate (AS-101), which has immunomodulating properties and minimal toxicity. The effects of AS-101 on the activation and function of immunocompetent cells have been assessed. We have found that AS-101 induces proliferation and IL-2 production by human lymphocytes in vitro, and enhances the production of IL-2 and colony-stimulating factor by mouse spleen cells. Splenocytes of BALB/c mice injected with AS-101 increased production of IL-2 and CSF in vitro in the presence of mitogen. Mononuclear cells of normal donors acquired responsiveness to recombinant IL-2 and bound monoclonal antibody to IL-2 receptor after incubation with AS-101. Splenocytes of mice treated in vivo with AS-101 expressed high levels of IL-2 receptor. The stimulation of lymphocytes by AS-101 apparently involves an increase in intracellular free calcium. AS-101 administered systemically to mice mediated antitumour effects which could be attributable to its immunomodulatory properties. In addition, AS-101 could directly enhance the ratio of OKT4 to OKT8-positive cells in cultured mononuclear cells from AIDS (acquired immune deficiency syndrome) patients. These results indicate that AS-101 is potentially useful in the treatment of clinical conditions involving immunosuppression.\r"

Recently it has been shown that inactivation of the vaccinia virus thymidine kinase gene or deletion of certain other non-essential genes is associated with a marked reduction in pathogenicity. Nevertheless, the ability of vaccinia virus to produce a progressive infection in immunodeficient individuals remains a most serious problem. Indeed, an incident of this type in a vaccinated man seropositive for human immunodeficiency virus was recently reported. We have used immunodeficient athymic nude mice to establish a model of disseminated vaccinia virus infection, and to demonstrate a novel approach to virus attenuation which involves insertion of a gene encoding human interleukin-2 into the genome of vaccinia virus vectors.\r"

Furthermore, we show that expression of F in a CD4+ cell line down-regulates the CD4(T4) antigen. These results suggest that F is important in the pathophysiology of AIDS (acquired immune deficiency syndrome).\r"

  ".W": "The most sensitive method of venous air embolism (VAE) detection in clinical use is the precordial Doppler detector. Because the Doppler detector may provide false-positive and false-negative data, many clinicians rely on end-tidal gas measurements for verification of VAE in the operating room. End-tidal nitrogen (ETN2) increases soon after experimental VAE are small enough to cause minimal changes in blood pressure; however, decreases in end-tidal CO2 (ETCO2) are more sensitive. A large VAE causes hemodynamic instability, and the effect of low cardiac output on ETN2 has not been evaluated. This study was done to compare the changes in ETN2 and ETCO2 during large bolus and infusion VAE. Five mongrel dogs were anesthetized, intubated, and ventilated (FIO2 1.0, PaCO2 38 +/- 4 (SD) mm Hg). The animals were studied in the supine position; anesthesia and paralysis were maintained with a constant infusion of thiamylal and pancuronium. Maintenance fluids were administered at 5 ml kg-1 h-1. Mean arterial and pulmonary arterial pressures (PAP) and ETN2 and ETCO2 were displayed on a strip chart recorder. The dogs underwent both bolus and infusion VAE in separate experiments 10 to 14 days apart. The air emboli were given in random order by automated syringe over 1 minute (infusion) (1 to 2.5 ml kg-1 min-1) or by hand injection over 5 seconds (bolus) (1 to 2.5 ml kg-1). Changes in precordial Doppler sounds occurred in all animals at all doses. The peak increase in PAP and decrease in ETCO2 were significant after all air doses. ETN2 changes were biphasic. The peak increase was significant after all air doses; the peak decrease was significant in 37 of 40 bolus and infusion VAE episodes, occurred within 1 to 3 minutes, and lasted 20 to 30 minutes.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "We studied the effect of a prior unilateral substantia nigra lesion on the recovery of local cerebral glucose utilization (lCMRgl) and blood flow (lCBF), measured autoradiographically, following 30 minutes of forebrain ischemia in rats. On the lesioned side, striatal dopamine (DA) and its metabolites were depleted by more than 95% and did not change after ischemia. In contrast, significant increases in striatal DA metabolites occurred on the nonlesioned side following ischemia. Despite unilateral DA depletion, no side-to-side lCBF differences were observed. However, the normally occurring postischemic restoration of lCMRgl in the dorsolateral striatum at 2 and 4 hours of recirculation was suppressed on the DA-depleted side, and the degree of lCMRgl/lCBF uncoupling diminished. These results suggest that integrity of the DA system accentuates postischemic metabolism/flow uncoupling in the striatum and may therefore contribute to selective ischemic injury of this structure.\r"

Diagnostic emphasis will be given to certain manifestations of MEGD, namely the clinical patterns of ophthalmoparesis, the results of forced duction testing, orbital ultrasonography, and CT, as well as the need to obtain, in some cases, special antibody studies and the thyrotropin releasing hormone stimulation test.\r"

CNM represents an objective method of quantitating the histopathologic readings of nuclear pheomorphism and cancer differentiation to allow these criteria to be used as prognostic indicators in squamous cancers. CNM readings of individual biopsy specimens from patients were shown to characterize each tumor. This may represent a cytopathologic method for tracking a cancer through whatever course of therapy is given.\r"

Specifically, we examined the hypothesis that a test protocol of the auditory brainstem response (ABR) in parallel with sinusoidal harmonic acceleration (SHA) is more cost-effective in identification of the risk of tumor than ABR alone. The subjects were 74 patients with acoustic tumors and 78 controls. ABR and SHA data from these subjects were submitted to decision analysis. ABR was more cost-effective than the protocol of ABR in parallel with SHA. Using these data, we outlined a \"decision tree\" for acoustic tumor diagnosis that fit the goals of high sensitivity when earlier probability of tumor was high, and high specificity when earlier probability of tumor was low.\r"

The most severe hearing loss was found at 500 Hz and 1000 Hz, where the mean threshold difference in the injured ear was 20 dB and 29 dB, respectively. The three cases for which pre-insult and post-insult data were available exhibited similar audiometric patterns, although the degree of threshold shift varied. Spectral analysis of the ring signal indicated sound-pressure levels of approximately 140 dB, with a fundamental frequency near 750 Hz.\r"
