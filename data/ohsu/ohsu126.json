  ".W": "Inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3) can stimulate skinned smooth and skeletal muscle to contract by initiating Ca2+ release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. Whether this process is an integral component of the in vivo muscle activation mechanism was tested by releasing InsP3 rapidly within skinned muscle fibers of rabbit main pulmonary artery and frog semitendinosus. InsP3 was liberated on laser pulse photolysis of a photolabile but biologically inactive precursor of InsP3 termed caged InsP3. Caged InsP3 is a mixture of compounds in which InsP3 is esterified with 1(2-nitrophenyl)diazoethane (probably at the P4- or P5-position). Photochemical release of InsP3 induced a full contraction in both muscles at physiological free Mg2+ concentrations, but only in the smooth muscle were the InsP3 concentration (0.5 microM) and the activation rate compatible with the in vivo physiological response. Endogenous InsP3-specific phosphatase activity was present in smooth muscle and had about 35-fold greater activity than that in the skeletal-muscle preparation. Caged InsP3 was not susceptible to phosphatases in either preparation.\r"

HCAs with selective norepinephrine reuptake blocking properties (noradrenergic HCAs), such as desipramine and protriptyline, produced different antinociceptive profiles from HCAs with selective serotonin reuptake blocking properties (serotonergic HCAs), such as fluoxetine and citalopram. Noradrenergic HCAs were antinociceptive in all of the three nociceptive tests employed in the present study, i.e., tail-flick (TF) test, i.t. substance P-induced behavioral (SPB) test and intradermal hypertonic saline-induced behavioral (HSB) test. Intrathecal noradrenergic HCAs potentiated systemic or i.t. morphine-induced antinociception in the TF test. Serotonergic HCAs were partially antinociceptive in the SPB and HSB test, but inactive in the TF test. Furthermore, serotonergic HCAs did not enhance the antinociception produced by systemic or intrathecal morphine. The present data suggest that the efficacy of HCAs in the control of chronic pain stems, at least partially, from their action in the spinal cord, their analgesic activities probably involve blockade of monoamine reuptake. and the spinal serotonergic system probably possesses a dual action in regard to spinal nociception, while the noradrenergic system does not.\r"

Forty-six girls (19 white and 27 black) were followed for periods of 2 to 5 years (mean 2.67 years). In each, the nipple diameter was measured and the Tanner stage assessed. Minimal nipple development occurred from stages PH1 to PH3 (3.24 to 4.44 mm) and B1 to B3 (3.00 to 4.72 mm) or more than 1 year prior to menarche (3.75 mm). Significant growth occurred beyond stages PH3 (PH4 6.54 mm, PH5 8.98 mm) and B3 (B4 7.25 mm, B5 9.41 mm) and from less than 1 year prior to menarche to more than 1 year after menarche (5.92 mm for girls less than 1 year premenarche, 7.88 mm for girls in their first year after menarche, and 9.05 mm for girls more than 1 year beyond menarche). A more objective definition for breast stages B4 and B5, based upon nipple diameter, is now feasible. Thus, these data enhance the precision with which physiologic events occurring toward the close of puberty in girls can be studied.\r"

By the use of the secretin analogues [Tyr10,13]secretin and [Tyr10,13,Phe22,Trp25]secretin, we have shown that substitution of tyrosine for leucine at positions 10 and 13 was sufficient to reduce the ability of the peptide to stimulate the production of inositol trisphosphate and the increases in cytosolic free calcium, while the ability to stimulate cAMP is little affected and the peptide remained a full agonist. Incubation with cholera toxin caused increases in cAMP, which were maximal after 30 min. Cholera toxin treatment also resulted in a marked reduction of secretin-stimulated inositol trisphosphate production, but this required a much more prolonged treatment (150-240 min), suggesting that different cholera toxin substrates were involved. Activation of protein kinase C with the phorbol ester phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate had no effect on secretin-induced cAMP formation, nor was secretin-stimulated inositol trisphosphate formation altered by further increases in cAMP. These results indicate that the mechanisms by which secretin stimulates adenylate cyclase and activates phospholipase C in acinar tissue are completely independent.\r"

Probes encoding HSV-1 sequences of the five immediate early genes and representative early (thymidine kinase), early-late (major capsid protein), and late (glycoprotein C) genes were used in these experiments. Of the probes tested, only those encoding the immediate early gene product infected-cell polypeptide (ICP) 0 hybridized to RNA in latently infected tissues. Probes containing the other immediate early genes (ICP4, ICP22, ICP27, and ICP47) and the representative early, early-late, and late genes did not hybridize. Two probes covering approximately equal to 30% of the HSV-1 genome and encoding over 20 early and late transcripts also did not hybridize to RNA in latently infected tissues. These results, with probes spanning greater than 60% of the HSV-1 genome, suggest that transcription of the HSV-1 genome is restricted to one region in latently infected mouse trigeminal ganglia.\r"

Although cyclosporin A (CsA), an immunosuppressive drug, has been shown to inhibit the production of certain lymphokines, including interleukin 2 (IL-2), interleukin 3 (IL-3), and gamma-interferon, its effect on the production of granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) has not been evaluated. In the current study, concanavalin A (Con A)-stimulated murine spleen cells secreted GM-CSF, IL-3, and IL-2, and in the presence of CsA (0.1-1.0 micrograms/ml), IL-2 and IL-3 activities were inhibited. In contrast, significant activity was detected when the CsA-treated culture supernatants were assayed on a cell line that is dependent on GM-CSF and/or IL-3. Similar CsA-resistant activity was observed when the EL-4 thymoma cells were stimulated with a phorbol ester [phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA)] in the presence of CsA. The activity resistant to CsA was identified as GM-CSF by the ability of specific antibodies against murine recombinant GM-CSF to neutralize its activity. These findings indicate that GM-CSF, in contrast to IL-2 and IL-3, was not inhibited by CsA. In additional experiments, transfer blot of poly(A)+ RNA isolated from PMA-induced EL-4 cells in the presence or the absence of CsA was hybridized with GM-CSF and IL-2 cDNA probes. Expression of the GM-CSF gene in EL-4 cells was detected independent of CsA, whereas CsA inhibited the expression of the IL-2 gene. The present data show that production of IL-2 and IL-3, but not that of GM-CSF, is inhibited by CsA and suggest a differential control mechanism for lymphokine synthesis in T lymphocytes.\r"

The nucleic acid sequence and amino acid sequence of human DHPR were determined from a full-length clone. A 112 amino acid sequence of sheep DHPR was obtained by sequencing purified sheep DHPR. This sequence is highly homologous to the predicted amino acid sequence of the human protein. Gene transfer of the recombinant human DHPR into COS cells leads to expression of DHPR enzymatic activity. These results indicate that the cDNA clone identified by antibody screening is an authentic and full-length cDNA for human DHPR.\r"

We have developed a simplified procedure for using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis to detect base pair changes in genomic DNA. Genomic DNA is digested with restriction enzymes and hybridized in solution to labeled single-stranded probe DNA. The excess probe is then hybridized to complementary phage M13 template DNA, and the reaction mixture is electrophoresed on a denaturing gradient gel. Only the genomic DNA probe hybrids migrate into the gel. Differences in hybrid mobility on the gel indicate base pair changes in the genomic DNA. We have used this technique to identify two polymorphic sites within a 1.2-kilobase region of human chromosome 20. This approach should greatly facilitate the identification of DNA polymorphisms useful for gene linkage studies and the diagnosis of genetic diseases.\r"

The three TAP bands that are precipitated from metabolically labeled cells display a common migration pattern in isoelectric focusing/NaDodSO4/PAGE gels and have common N-terminal sequences. This sequence is rich in cysteine and is homologous to that previously reported for the Ly-6.1E antigen. We, therefore, compared TAP and Ly-6.1E biochemically and found them to be structurally distinct. Given the role of TAP in T-cell activation, we further studied whether the molecule was phosphorylated. We have not found evidence for phosphorylation of the TAP protein. The carbohydrates present on the TAP molecule are resistant to peptide N-glycosidase F in vitro and tunicamycin in vivo. The upper band of the TAP triplet is susceptible to treatment with trifluoromethanesulfonic acid and thus seems to be of the O-linked rather than of the N-linked variety. The biosynthetic processing of TAP was studied in pulse-chase experiments. The middle band of the TAP triplet appears to be the earliest detectable species. Its conversion to the O-linked high molecular weight species can be blocked by monensin.\r"

Variations in recognition of this diverse set of target cells was circumvented by attaching to all of them a monoclonal antibody to the antigen-specific receptor of a cloned CTL cell line (clone 2C) and using the 2C cell line as the standard aggressor or effector cell. All of the nine tumor cell lines and the four noncytolytic T-helper cell lines tested as targets were highly susceptible to lysis by the aggressor CTL, but seven cytotoxic T-cell lines (six CTL and one T-helper cell line with cytotoxic activity) were largely resistant. These results, and the use of the lectin Con A as an alternative means for triggering CTL activity, point clearly to a level of resistance that could enable CTL to avoid their own destruction when they lyse target cells. The resistance of the cytolytic T cells did not appear to be accompanied by a similar resistance to complement-mediated lysis, indicating that mechanisms of CTL-mediated and complement-mediated lysis are not identical.\r"

  ".W": "In this study, immunotoxins containing monoclonal anti-human T-cell leukemia antibodies are shown to be capable of completely suppressing the tumor growth of human T-cell leukemia cells in vivo without any overt undesirable toxicity. These immunotoxins were prepared by conjugating ricin A chain (RA) with our monoclonal antibodies, SN1 and SN2, directed specifically to the human T-cell leukemia cell surface antigens TALLA and GP37, respectively. We have shown that these monoclonal antibodies are highly specific for human T-cell leukemia cells and do not react with various normal cells including normal T and B cells, thymocytes, and bone marrow cells. Ascitic and solid human T-cell leukemia cell tumors were generated in nude mice. The ascitic tumor was generated by transplanting Ichikawa cells (a human T-cell leukemia cell line) i.p. into nude mice, whereas the solid tumor was generated by transplanting s.c. MOLT-4 cells (a human T-cell leukemia cell line) and x-irradiated human fibrosarcoma cells into x-irradiated nude mice. To investigate the efficacy of specific immunotoxins in suppressing the in vivo growth of the ascitic tumor, we divided 40 nude mice that were injected with Ichikawa cells into four groups. Each group of 10 mice was injected with one of the following mixtures: 40 micrograms of purified control mouse IgG [IgG1(kappa)] (group 1), 40 micrograms of control RA conjugate (group 2), 20 micrograms of purified SN1 antibody [IgG1(kappa)] and 20 micrograms of purified SN2 antibody [IgG1(kappa)] (group 3), or 20 micrograms of SN1-RA and 20 micrograms of SN2-RA (group 4). Mice in groups 1 and 2 formed large ascitic tumors, and died 5.8-7.0 weeks after the transplantation. Group 3 mice also formed large ascitic tumors and died 6.4-7.8 weeks after the transplantation. However, none of the mice in group 4 that were treated with SN1-RA and SN2-RA showed any signs of a tumor or undesirable toxic effects for the 20 weeks that they were followed after the transplantation; these mice were indistinguishable from healthy control nude mice that were not injected with Ichikawa cells. Treatment with SN1-RA plus SN2-RA completely suppressed solid tumor growth in 4 of 10 nude mice carrying solid tumors and partially suppressed the tumor growth in the remaining 6 nude mice. These results strongly suggest that SN1-RA and SN2-RA may be useful for clinical treatment.\r"

Involvement of HLA-DR is suggested by the pattern of sperm interactions with HLA-DR-positive and -negative cells and by inhibition of sperm binding to HLA-DR-positive cells by a monoclonal antibody that identifies a nonpolymorphic determinant on the HLA-DR molecule. That the complementary sperm ligand may be a T4-like structure is suggested by specific inhibition of sperm-lymphocyte binding with monoclonal antibodies OKT4 and OKT4A.

  ".W": "Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection of EBV-negative Burkitt lymphoma (BL) cells induces some changes similar to those seen in normal B lymphocytes that have been growth transformed by EBV. The role of individual EBV genes in this process was evaluated by introducing each of the viral genes that are normally expressed in EBV growth-transformed and latently infected lymphoblasts into an EBV-negative BL cell line, using recombinant retrovirus-mediated transfer. Clones of cells were derived that stably express the EBV nuclear antigen 1 (EBNA-1), EBNA-2, EBNA-3, EBNA-leader protein, or EBV latent membrane protein (LMP). These were compared with control clones infected with the retrovirus vector. All 10 clones converted to EBNA-2 expression differed from control clones or clones expressing other EBV proteins by growth in tight clumps and by markedly increased expression of one particular surface marker of B-cell activation, CD23. Other activation antigens were unaffected by EBNA-2 expression, as were markers already expressed on the parent BL cell line, including BL markers (cALLA and BLA), proliferation markers (transferrin receptor and BK19.9), and cell adhesion-related molecules (LFA-1 and LFA-3). Increased CD23 expression in cells expressing EBNA-2 was apparent from monoclonal anti-CD23 antibody binding to the cell surface, from immunoprecipitation of the 45-kDa and 90-kDa CD23 proteins with monoclonal antibody, and from RNA blots probed with labeled CD23 DNA. The results indicate that EBNA-2 is a specific direct or indirect trans-activator of CD23. This establishes a link between an EBV gene and cell gene expression. Since CD23 has been implicated in the transduction of B-cell growth signals, its specific induction by EBNA-2 could be important in EBV induction of B-lymphocyte transformation.\r"

  ".W": "Systemic administration of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) causes parkinsonism in humans and subhuman primates, but not in rats and many other laboratory animals; mice are intermediate in their susceptibility. Since MPTP causes selective dopaminergic neurotoxicity when infused directly into rat substantia nigra, we hypothesized that systemic MPTP may be metabolized by monoamine oxidase and/or other enzymes in rat brain capillaries and possibly other peripheral organs and thus prevented from reaching its neuronal sites of toxicity. We tested this hypothesis by assessing monoamine oxidase in isolated cerebral microvessels of humans, rats, and mice by measuring the specific binding of [3H]pargyline, an irreversible monoamine oxidase inhibitor, and by estimating the rates of MPTP and benzylamine oxidation. [3H]Pargyline binding to rat cerebral microvessels was about 10-fold higher than to human or mouse microvessels. Also, MPTP oxidation by rat brain microvessels was about 30-fold greater than by human microvessels; mouse microvessels yielded intermediate values. These results may explain, at least in part, the marked species differences in susceptibility to systemic MPTP. They also suggest the potential importance of \"enzyme barriers\" at the blood-brain interface that can metabolize toxins not excluded by structural barriers, and may provide biological bases for developing therapeutic strategies for the prevention of MPTP-induced neurotoxicity and other neurotoxic conditions including, possibly, Parkinson disease.\r"

The core particles observed in the cytoplasm and the virus particles secreted in the culture medium contained the replicative intermediates of HBV DNA and banded at densities of 1.35-1.36 g/cm3 and 1.22-1.24 g/cm3, respectively. Furthermore, the in vitro mutagenesis of the template HBV DNA demonstrated that the P gene as well as the C gene products were essential for the production of HBV particles.\r"

Four clonally invariant chains include delta (a 26-kDa glycoprotein), gamma (a 21-kDa glycoprotein), epsilon (a 25-kDa protein), and zeta (a 16-kDa protein). zeta is found in the complex as a disulfide-linked homodimer. The clonotypic chains and the invariant chains form a noncovalent complex on the cell surface. We have developed antibodies against each of the chains and used them to examine the assembly of the mature complex in the murine antigen-specific T-cell hybridoma 2B4. Pulse-chase studies of metabolically labeled cells demonstrate that many of the chains are synthesized in great excess over the amount assembled into the mature complex. These excess chains, either as free components or as partially assembled complexes, are rapidly degraded. This degradation most likely takes place in the lysosomes. The complete complex is quite stable with a long half-life. A specific hierarchy of partially assembled complexes can be discerned.\r"

In the presence of normal human plasma, gIL-3 stimulated megakaryocytes. In methylcellulose cultures, it stimulated erythroid colonies in the presence, but not in the absence, of erythropoietin. When mature human leukocytes were used, gIL-3 stimulated the function of purified mature eosinophils as measured by the capacity to kill antibody-coated target cells, to produce superoxide anions, and to phagocytize opsonized yeast particles in a manner similar to recombinant human granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor. In contrast, gIL-3 did not significantly stimulate any of the neutrophil functions tested, whereas human recombinant granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor was active in these assays. Among cytokines that are active on human hematopoietic cells, gIL-3 thus has a distinct set of functions and may predict the range of actions of the human molecule.\r"

It appeared that the H-2aw18 haplotype has a single, recessive, lethal mutation, since homozygotes for H-2aw18 were not detected in progeny generated from the intercross of mice that were heterozygous for this H-2 haplotype. Nine newly established recombinant H-2 haplotypes, which arose from the heterozygous mice that resulted from a cross between common inbred H-2 haplotypes and the aw18 haplotype, allowed us to map the lethal gene to the class III region of the H-2 complex. Southern blot analysis indicated that the aw18 haplotype has a deletion of the C4 gene and a deletion of one of the steroid 21-hydroxylase genes. This result was confirmed by an immunodiffusion test that demonstrated the absence of production of the C4 protein in mice of haplotype H-2aw18. All data that were obtained supported the hypothesis that the meiotic, presumably unequal, recombination between homologous chromosomes of the H-2a and H-2wm7 haplotypes caused the deletion of the C4 and the 21-hydroxylase genes.\r"

The nucleotide sequence of the 5' flanking region, which contains regions of DNase hypersensitivity and binding sites for putative regulatory proteins, is the same as that of the normal MYC. Accordingly, mutations in these regulatory regions are not required for the transcriptional deregulation of MYC in the BL2 cell line. The nucleotide sequence of the first exon is similar to that of the normal MYC [Gazin, C., Dupont de Direchin, S., Hampe, A., Masson, J. M., Martin, P., Stehelin, D. & Galibert, F. (1984) EMBO J. 3, 383-387] and has the coding capacity for a 188-residue polypeptide. However, six nucleotide changes that occur in the middle of this reading frame could result in amino acid substitutions. We also have cloned and sequenced the t(8;22) chromosomal breakpoint that is located 10 kilobases 3' of the MYC exon 3 and near the C lambda 3 gene on chromosome 22. Sequences with homology to immunoglobulin joining signals occur close to the breakpoint both on chromosome 8 and 22, providing further evidence that the immunoglobulin joining enzymes may be involved in the recombinations associated with a variety of chromosomal translocations in B and T cells.\r"

Mice heterozygous for this allele have a yellow coat color, are genetically obese with an increased susceptibility to cancer, and have other metabolic derangements. Mice homozygous for Ay die early in embryogenesis, possibly because of a trophectoderm defect. The Ay mutation is distinguished from the many alleles described at the agouti locus in being associated with an endogenous provirus, designated endogenous ecotropic murine leukemia viral locus 15 (Emv-15). To obtain DNA sequences from regions close to or within the agouti locus, we have isolated the Emv-15 provirus and have found that the DNA sequences adjacent to the provirus are part of a mouse gene that is expressed in the same transcriptional orientation as the proviral genes. These mouse DNA sequences recognize two distinct size classes of RNA in various adult wild-type tissues including skin. In Ay heterozygotes both types of transcript hybridize to the proviral long terminal repeat, and, in heterozygous spleens, the shorter transcript is present at an enhanced steady-state level. These results suggest that the Ay-associated provirus (Emv-15) is distinguished from the endogenous C-type proviruses described to date in having altered the expression of a flanking host gene by promoter insertion, resulting in the production of chimeric viral-host fusion transcripts.\r"

In situ hybridization of t(4;11)(q21;q23)-carrying leukemic cells revealed that the IP-10 gene is proximal to the breakpoint of this translocation. No DNA rearrangement was evident when the IP-10 gene was hybridized to genomic DNA isolated from two patients' leukemic cells that contain t(4;11)(q21;q23). However, restriction fragment length polymorphism in the 5' region of the IP-10 gene was detected. The ETS1 protooncogene is located at 11q23 and is known to translocate to chromosome 4 in t(4;11) (q21;q23) and into the interferon gene cluster in (9;11) (p22;q23). Both translocations are associated with acute monocytic leukemia. These results suggest a model in which juxtaposition of genetic loci regulated by antiproliferative signals, such as interferon, next to an oncogene, like ETS1, could effectively short circuit homeostatic control circuits and contribute to the neoplastic state.\r"

  ".W": "The human major histocompatibility complex is a multigene family containing at least 20 class I genes. Included within this family are the loci encoding the highly polymorphic HLA-A, -B, and -C antigens present at the surface of most nucleated cells. The large number of genes detected with class I probes by Southern blot analysis and the existence of serological reagents defining nonubiquitous, non-HLA-A,B,C class I antigens suggest that products other than HLA-A,B,C antigens are encoded within the class I gene family. These products might be the human counterparts of the murine Qa and TL antigens. In order to identify non-HLA-A,B,C genes, we have developed a probe, JF11, located in noncoding regions flanking the HLA-A locus. This probe detects only a limited number of class I genes and does not detect HLA-A,B,C-associated restriction fragments on Southern blots. This probe was used to screen a human cosmid library. Some of the cosmids isolated with this probe were then transferred into mouse fibroblasts expressing human beta 2-microglobulin. One of the transfectants specifically reacts with one alloantiserum (HA2) that detects HLA class I molecules specific to HLA-A2-positive, phytohemagglutinin-activated T cells and not found on resting T or B cells. Data presented in this paper provide evidence for the isolation and expression of a class I gene encoding a nonubiquitous class I antigen that could be a human analogue of the murine Qa antigens.\r"

Cross-reactions with other tested polynucleotides were frequent, but cross-reactions with phospholipids and phosphocholine were undetectable. Most anti-DNA antibodies bound preferentially or exclusively to single-stranded denatured DNA as compared to double-stranded native DNA. The frequency of anti-denatured DNA antibody-forming cell precursors among CBA peritoneal cells was not elevated. Fluorescence-activated cell sorter-selected Ly-1-positive NZB splenic B cells were not enriched, and Ly-1 negative B cells were not depleted of anti-DNA antibody-forming cell precursors. These results show that antibody-forming cell precursors specific for denatured DNA are not restricted to the Ly-1 positive B-cell subset.\r"

The primary structure of T11 was deduced from protein microsequencing and cDNA cloning. The mature human protein appears to be divided into three domains: a hydrophilic 185 amino acid external domain bearing only limited homology to the T-cell surface protein T4 and the immunoglobulin kappa light chain variable region, a 25 amino acid hydrophobic transmembrane segment, and a 126 amino acid cytoplasmic domain rich in prolines and basic residues. Transfection of cDNAs encoding either the 1.7- or the 1.3-kilobase T11 mRNA into COS-1 cells resulted in expression of surface T11 epitopes as well as sheep-erythrocyte-binding capacity. The predicted structure is consistent with the possibility that T11 functions in signal transduction.\r"

Comparison of cellular cytotoxicity and C9RP content at various times during activation yielded a coefficient of correlation r = 0.92. During OKT3 stimulation of peripheral mononuclear cells, maximal C9RP content and cytotoxicity were observed by day 2 or 3, with subsequent decline to baseline values by day 5, whereas during interleukin 2 stimulation, both parameters reached the maximal level at days 3-5. After fluorescence-activated cell sorting, C9RP and cytotoxicity were quantitated in CD4+, CD8+, and Leu-19+ subsets. In OKT3-activated CD8+ cells, C9RP increased to approximately 3 X 10(6) molecules per cell, with a corresponding increase in lysis of human melanoma cells mediated by anti-CD3-anti-melanoma monoclonal antibody conjugates. Interleukin 2-stimulated CD8+ cells showed similar increases, but cytotoxicity was conjugate-independent. Activated CD4+ cells showed minimal increase in C9RP content. Leu-19+ cells, which exhibit natural killer cell activity, had a high C9RP content (approximately 2.5 X 10(6) molecules per cell) before stimulation.\r"

Here we report the nucleotide sequence of the two overlapping CEA cDNA clones comprising 1422 nucleotides of CEA mRNA. This sequence encodes the 372 COOH-terminal amino acids of CEA followed by 305 nucleotides of 3' untranslated sequence containing a truncated Alu repeat. The predicted protein sequence is composed of two repeats comprising 178 amino acids, each with an exceptionally high homology of 67%. Each repeat unit contains four conserved cysteine residues and six to nine putative N-glycosylation sites. CEA mRNA is most strongly expressed in primary colon tumors and, to a lesser extent, in normal colonic tissue. No CEA mRNA is found in HeLa cells and normal human fibroblasts.\r"

  ".W": "Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) is a glycoprotein important as a tumor marker for colonic cancer. Immunological and biochemical studies have shown it to be closely related to a number of other glycoproteins, which together make up a gene family. We have cloned a member of this gene family by using long oligonucleotide probes (42-54 nucleotides) based on our protein sequence data for CEA and NCA (nonspecific cross-reacting antigen) and on human codon usage. The clone obtained (lambda 39.2) hybridizes with six probes and has a 15-kilobase insert. The 5' end of the gene is contained within a 2700-base-pair EcoRI fragment, which hybridizes with five of the six synthetic probes. Sequencing of the 5' end region revealed the location and structure of one exon and two putative intron boundaries. The exon encodes part of the leader sequence and the NH2-terminal 107 amino acids of NCA. Southern blot analysis of human normal and tumor DNA, using as probes two lambda 39.2 fragments that contain coding sequences, suggests the existence of 9-11 genes for the CEA family. One of the restriction fragments described here has been used by Zimmermann et al. [Zimmermann, W., Ortlieb, B., Friedrich, R. & von Kleist, S. (1987) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 84, 2960-2964] to isolate partial cDNA clones for CEA. The identity of this clone was verified with our protein sequence data [Paxton, R., Mooser, G., Pande, H., Lee, T.D. & Shively, J.E. (1987) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 84, 920-924]. We discuss a domain structure for CEA based on the CEA sequence data and the NCA exon sequence data. It is likely that this gene family evolved from a common ancestor shared with neural cell adhesion molecule and alpha 1 B-glycoprotein and is perhaps a family within the immunoglobulin superfamily.\r"

By using somatic cell hybrids and in situ hybridization, we localized this gene to human chromosome 5 at bands q31 to q35, a chromosomal region that is frequently deleted [del(5q)] in patients with myeloid disorders. By in situ hybridization, the CSF-1 gene was found to be deleted in the 5q- chromosome of a patient with refractory anemia who had a del(5)(q15q33.3) and in that of a second patient with acute nonlymphocytic leukemia de novo who had a similar distal breakpoint [del(5)(q13q33.3)]. The gene was present in the deleted chromosome of a third patient, with therapy-related acute nonlymphocytic leukemia, who had a more proximal breakpoint in band q33 [del(5)(q22q33.1)]. Hybridization of the CSF-1 probe to metaphase cells of a fourth patient, with acute nonlymphocytic leukemia de novo, who had a rearrangement of chromosomes 5 and 21 [ins(21;5)(q22;q31.3q33.1)] resulted in labeling of the breakpoint junctions of both rearranged chromosomes; this suggested that CSF-1 is located at 5q33.1. Thus, a small segment of chromosome 5 contains GM-CSF (the gene encoding the granulocyte-macrophage CSF), CSF-1, and FMS, which encodes the CSF-1 receptor, in that order from the centromere; this cluster of genes may be involved in the altered hematopoiesis associated with a deletion of 5q.\r"

Previous work on the effect of neuropeptides on mast cell mediator release showed that only substance P caused such release from intestinal mucosal mast cells [Shanahan, F., Denburg, J. A., Fox, J., Bienenstock, J. & Befus, A. D. (1985) J. Immunol. 135, 1331-1337]. Accordingly, we investigated the microanatomical relationship between mast cells and enteric nerves in normal rat intestine and parasite-infected rat intestine, in which mucosal mast cell hyperplasia occurs. Combined immunohistochemistry for neuron-specific enolase and staining with alcian blue at pH 0.5 was employed on paraffin-embedded sections of normal and Nippostrongylus brasiliensis-infected rat jejunum. Sixty-seven percent of intestinal mucosal mast cells were touching subepithelial nerves, and an additional 20% were within 2 micron of nerves. Assessment of the proportion of the lamina propria occupied by mast cells (12.5%), the average mast cell area (121 +/- 28 microns 2), and the density of enteric nerves (one per 788 +/- 151 microns 2) suggested that the association was 5 times greater than would be expected by chance alone (P less than 0.0001). In consecutive sections, the nerves in contact with mast cells were also shown to contain substance P and/or calcitonin-gene-related peptide. Electron microscopy confirmed this association: 8% of the mast cells in infected rats exhibited membrane-membrane contact with unmyelinated axons containing 70- to 170-nm dense-core vesicles, and an additional 31% were situated less than 250 nm from nerves. Other mast cells appeared to embrace nerve bundles through the projection of lamellopodia. These data provide systematic quantitative evidence that a structural foundation for communication between the immune and nervous systems exists in the rat gastrointestinal tract.\r"

The MT precursor consists of 125 amino acid residues containing a signal peptide followed directly by MT, which in turn is connected to the MT neurophysin by Gly-Lys-Arg, a processing and carboxyl-terminal amidation signal. In contrast, the VT precursor includes a glycoprotein of 36 amino acids following the VT neurophysin. Except for glycoprotein, the structures of MT and VT precursors are quite similar. RNA transfer blotting analysis showed that both MT and VT mRNAs are present in the brain but not in the liver, ovaries, and testes of the toad. The sequences and the structural organizations of the MT and VT precursors are highly homologous to those of their mammalian counterparts, oxytocin and arginine vasopressin precursors, respectively. This fact suggests that, in the evolutionary pathway of neurohypophysial hormones, VT is the ancestor molecule of vasopressin, while MT is that of oxytocin.\r"

Following step stimulation with a glass fiber, the hair bundle of a saccular hair cell initially had a stiffness of approximately equal to 1 mN X m-1. The stiffness then declined to a steady-state level near 0.6 mN X m-1 with a time course comparable to that of adaptation in the receptor current. The hair bundle may be modeled as the parallel combination of a spring, which represents the rotational stiffness of the stereocilia, and a series spring and dashpot, which respectively, represent the elastic element responsible for channel gating and the apparatus for adaptation.\r"

Each animal was anesthetized, and a full-thickness incision, 3.5-cm long, was made on its back. After 24 hours, Exp4 and Exp7 rabbits received HVS with a negative polarity for two hours twice daily. Although tensile-strength values were 36% higher for Exp4 rabbits than for Con4 rabbits, no significant differences in tensile strength or percentage of wound closure existed between the two groups. After seven days, Con7 rabbits had a higher percentage of wound closure and significantly greater tensile-strength measures than Exp7 rabbits. Histologic examination of the wounds did not provide clear-cut evidence of differences between the experimental and control groups. Results suggest that 1) HVS did not significantly improve wound healing for Exp4 rabbits and 2) HVS as given, may have hampered the healing process for Exp7 rabbits.\r"

G-6-PD-deficient patients were followed serially, with determinations of hemoglobin, haptoglobin, and bilirubin levels, reticulocyte count, and urinalysis. Pretherapy hemoglobin levels were compared with levels during and after therapy. One hundred patients were divided into four groups: group A comprised G-6-PD-deficient patients receiving TMP-SMZ (n = 20); group B, G-6-PD-deficient patients receiving vancomycin (n = 25); and groups C and D, patients with normal G-6-PD levels receiving TMP-SMZ (n = 24) and vancomycin (n = 31), respectively. Groups were comparable in terms of age of patients and duration of therapy. Hemolysis did not occur in any patient receiving TMP-SMZ and occurred in only one patient receiving vancomycin.

An alternative type of T cell receptor was earlier identified on a subpopulation of murine thymocytes with a similar phenotype (T3+, L3T4-, Lyt-2-), but not on peripheral murine T lymphocytes. Two independently derived Thy-1+, L3T4-, and Lyt-2- dendritic cell lines of epidermal origin that express a T3-associated disulfide-linked heterodimer composed of a 34-kilodalton gamma-chain and 46-kilodalton partner (the delta chain) have now been identified. Analysis of N-linked glycosylation revealed that this receptor is similar to that detected on thymocytes. These results demonstrate that Thy-1+ dendritic epidermal cell lines can express gamma delta T cell receptors in vitro and suggest that Thy-1+ dendritic epidermal cells express such receptors in vivo. The localization of these gamma delta T cell receptor-expressing cells in the epidermis may be of importance for understanding the function of these receptors.\r"

Separate plasmids encoding the art/trs protein, the tat protein, or the envelope glycoprotein gp120 were used to demonstrate that both art/trs and tat are absolutely required for the synthesis of gp120 from its cognate messenger RNA. In addition, both the tat and art/trs proteins influence the level of envelope RNA. The results suggest that art/trs and tat may be ideal targets for potential anti-HIV agents in AIDS therapy.\r"

An attempt was made to determine whether the cells from patients with this leukemia were HTLV-I antigen-committed B cells that had undergone malignant transformation. Cells from two HTLV-I seropositive Jamaican patients with CLL were fused with a human B-lymphoblastoid cell line. The hybridoma cells that resulted from the fusion of CLL cells from patient I.C. produced an immunoglobulin (IgM) that reacted with the p24 gag protein from HTLV-I, HTLV-II, and HTLV-III (now referred to as HIV), but showed preferential reactivity with HTLV-I. The specific immunoglobulin gene rearrangement (IgM, kappa) in the CLL cell was demonstrated in the hybridoma cell line, indicating that the captured immunoglobulin was from the CLL cells. The IgM secreted by the fusion of CLL cells from patient L.L. reacted only with HTLV-I-infected cells and with the HTLV-I large envelope protein (gp61) on Western blots. The CLL cells from these patients appear to be a malignant transformation of an antigen-committed B cell responding to HTLV-I infection, suggesting an indirect role for this retrovirus in leukemogenesis.\r"

Eighty rats had heterotopic transplants performed with systemic venous drainage of the grafts. The host native bowel was left in situ and no immunosuppressive agents were used. Twenty male Lewis inbred (LEW) rats who received isogenic grafts survived without any evidence of rejection or GVHD. When intestine from Lewis X Brown Norway hybrid rats (LBN) was transplanted into LEW rats, rejection occurred between day 6 and 9 and the time of onset of rejection was not influenced either by the length of transplanted bowel (10 to 80 cm, n = 6 each) or by whether the graft was from the jejunum or the ileum. However, rates of survival for 100 days from rejection were significantly better if 10 cm (100%) or 20 cm (84%) was transplanted than if the grafts were 40 cm or more in length (56%). The LBN recipients of LEW allografts developed GVHD on days 7 through 9, and this response was similarly unrelated to the length or segment of bowel transplanted. However, host survival was quite dependent on graft segment length and site of origin. All animals who received 20 cm or less of proximal bowel survived (with GVHD but no evidence of rejection). While 50% of the animals that received proximal intestinal grafts 40 cm in length survived GVHD, none who received identical-sized grafts from the distal ileum survived (all were dead by day 20). Our data document that the results of small-intestine transplantation is dependent on the length and site of origin of the grafts.\r"

TENS provided a simple, safe method of reducing postoperative pain in the three surgical procedures tested.

Forty-four of the 72 patients had extensive disease, defined as disease extending beyond the confines of one hemithorax, plus or minus mediastinal or ipsilateral supraclavicular disease or ipsilateral pleural effusion. Initial-staging abdominal CT revealed one or more sites of metastatic disease in 26 (59%) of these 44 patients, while 18 patients had normal initial CT examinations. Statistical analysis of patients with extensive disease revealed a significant increase in complete therapeutic response (p = .0054) and in the length of survival (p = .001) among those who had extensive disease without abdominal metastases as compared with those who had abdominal metastases on their initial abdominal CT examination. The development of new or recurrent abdominal metastases in general or in specific organs on follow-up scans obtained in 35 patients did not significantly decrease their survival time as compared with that of patients without such metastases. Our findings suggest that CT of the abdomen is beneficial in the initial staging of patients with small-cell carcinoma of the lung and provides prognostic information concerning response to therapy and length of survival.\r"

The efficacy and safety of using a small chest tube to treat this complication were examined by reviewing the records of 876 patients who underwent transthoracic needle aspirations between January 1981 and February 1986. Among these patients, 212 (24%) sustained a pneumothorax, and 92 (11%) required placement of a small 9-French chest tube attached to a flutter-type (Heimlich) valve. Duration of chest-tube drainage ranged between 24 hr and 3 weeks (mean, 2.2 days). Complete resolution of the pneumothorax and subsequent removal of the chest tube after 24 hr of drainage occurred in 38 (41%) of the 92 patients. Twenty-nine (32%) required 48 hr of drainage, and nine (10%) required 3 days. The remaining 16 (17%) required longer periods of drainage ranging from 4 days to 3 weeks. The tubes of six of this last group of patients were attached to a suction apparatus, and three of these patients eventually had a 28-French chest tube placed surgically. No significant complications occurred. The use of a small chest tube for treatment of pneumothorax after transthoracic needle aspiration is easy, safe, and efficacious.\r"

Two abscesses occurred immediately after surgery (two patients), five were in the liver (three patients), and 11 were the result of direct spread of disease from adjacent transmural bowel involvement (seven patients). Both postoperative and all five hepatic abscesses were treated successfully with percutaneous drainage. In two of the seven patients with abscesses secondary to transmural bowel disease, percutaneous drainage resulted in resolution of the abscess without the need for any further surgical intervention. The remaining five patients had subsequent elective intestinal surgery in which a single-stage surgical resection and primary reanastomosis were performed successfully. Two of these patients had abscesses recur at the same location, prompting a repeat percutaneous drainage before surgery. No enterocutaneous fistulas secondary to percutaneous drainage developed in any of the 10 patients. These results indicate that percutaneous abscess drainage can be a valuable technique for treating abscesses that result as a complication of Crohn's disease.\r"

Subsequently, the CT findings in 95 patients with proven small-bowel disease were analyzed to determine which CT observations correlated with neoplastic, inflammatory, or edema-producing processes. Thirty-three (83%) of 40 patients with wall thickening or mesenteric masses greater than 1.5 cm had a neoplastic process. Twenty-eight (82%) of 34 patients with normal mesenteric fat attenuation, wall thickening less than 1.5 cm, or mesenteric masses less than 1.5 cm had inflammatory disease. Fourteen (67%) of 21 patients with no mesenteric mass, increased mesenteric fat attenuation, and wall thickening less than 1.5 cm had noninflammatory edema. Overall, CT assigned 75 (79%) of 95 patients into appropriate categories; use of ancillary CT findings led to correct categorization in 83 (87%). CT is helpful in correctly assigning a disease category to patients with small-bowel wall thickening.\r"

  ".W": "In 62 consecutive patients, 99mTc RBC studies were reviewed and the scintigraphic findings were characterized to determine the ability of 99mTc RBC scintigraphy to estimate bleeding rates in patients with active gastrointestinal hemorrhage. Of the 62 scans, 10 showed early positivity (less than 1 hr) with a strongly intense bleeding focus relative to hepatic activity (group 1), four showed delayed positivity (greater than 1 hr) with a strong focus (group 2), five showed early positivity with a weak focus (group 3), 12 showed delayed positivity with a weak focus (group 4), and 31 studies were negative (group 5). The mean bleeding rates were then calculated by dividing the blood transfusion volume requirements by the duration of active bleeding for each patient, as recorded in the patients' charts. The mean bleeding rates for these groups were 0.4, 0.3, 0.2, 0.15, and 0.1 ml/min, respectively. Group 1 patients had the greatest mean blood-volume loss, longest duration of active bleeding, and highest mean bleeding rate, and they required more aggressive therapy than the other groups. The minimum mean bleeding rate detectable by scintigraphy was 0.1 ml/min. Our results suggest that 99mTc RBC scintigraphy can estimate bleeding rates and identify those patients who are at higher risk for developing massive gastrointestinal hemorrhage requiring more aggressive therapy.\r"

Nine criteria were identified as a useful means of detecting subtle abnormalities of duodenal position.

Over 4 years of age, mobility was very limited.

  ".U": "87209556\r", 
  ".W": "Understanding the MR appearance of spinal CSF is important in interpreting clinical spine images because the diagnosis of spinal pathology requires an accurate delineation of spinal CSF from spinal cord and thecal sac. During conventional 2DFT MR imaging of the spine, CSF pulsation caused two interdependent flow phenomena, signal loss and phase-shift images. Signal loss was observed as decreased signal intensity arising from pulsatile spinal CSF. Phase-shift images were observed as signal intensity arising from and morphologically identical to the spinal subarachnoid space but symmetrically displaced from it along the phase-encoding axis of MR images, either added to or subtracted from stationary signal intensity. These phenomena were common, occurring in most cervical and thoracic long-TR images. Both phenomena were less apparent in the lumbar region in most cases. CSF pulsation flow phenomena decreased CSF-spinal cord and CSF-thecal sac conspicuity, thereby obscuring normal and pathologic anatomy and, at times, simulating pathology. The areas of signal loss showed variable but characteristic patterns in the cervical and thoracic spine corresponding to regions of greatest flow. Signal loss in the axial plane was more pronounced when thin slices were used. Phase-shift images degraded overall image quality secondary to spatial mismapping of spinal CSF signal intensity. With the use of CSF gating, both signal loss and phase-shift images were eliminated. Understanding these features will be important in the accurate interpretation of MR spine images because analysis of CSF pulsation flow phenomena provides physiologic and pathologic information, and awareness of their existence avoids diagnostic confusion.\r"

  ".U": "87209557\r", 
  ".W": "The effects of pulsatile motion on MR imaging of spinal CSF were quantitatively evaluated with a spine phantom that simulated spinal CSF pulsation. Two fundamental interdependent pulsation flow phenomena were observed: variable reductions in signal intensity of pulsatile CSF (signal loss) and spatial mismapping of this signal beyond the confines of the subarachnoid space (phase-shift images). Phase-shift images were observed as multiple regions of signal intensity conforming morphologically to the subarachnoid space but displaced symmetrically from it along the phase-encoding axis, either added to or subtracted from stationary signal intensity. Both CSF pulsation flow phenomena occurred secondary to harmonic modulation of proton precessional phase (temporal phase shift) by the unique pulsatile motion of spinal CSF when the repetition time was not an integral multiple of the pulsation period. Each flow phenomenon was analyzed with the spine phantom independently to control individual imaging and physiologic parameters including imaging plane, repetition time, echo time, slice thickness, number of echoes, number of excitations, CSF pulsation amplitude, and CSF pulsation period. In the axial plane, signal loss was present on both first- and second-echo images and was more pronounced with larger pulsation amplitudes and smaller slice thicknesses. A quantitative relationship between these two parameters allowed the prediction of CSF pulsation amplitude when the slice thickness was known and the CSF signal intensity was measured. In the sagittal plane, signal loss was present on first-echo images, was more pronounced with larger pulsation amplitudes, and underwent incomplete even-echo rephasing on second-echo images. Phase-shift images were influenced by the relationship between repetition time and CSF pulsation period. They were partly eliminated on sagittal but not on axial second-echo images because of incomplete even-echo rephasing. Both signal loss and phase-shift images were completely eliminated with CSF gating or pseudogating, indicating the rationale for gating during clinical spinal MR. The clinical significance of these findings is that awareness of the existence of spinal CSF pulsation flow phenomena avoids diagnostic confusion, whereas understanding their etiology provides a rational approach, such as CSF gating, to eliminate them.\r"

Its major divisions and branches could be imaged only with specially angled axial scan planes. To verify our observations MR imaging was compared with whole-organ cryomicrotome sections cut at the same angles. Normal variations in the appearance of the nerve and pitfalls in its visualization are discussed. Three cases of parotid tumors, with surgical confirmation of the relationship of the facial nerve to the tumor, are presented. MR is the only imaging technique capable of direct imaging of the facial nerve in the parotid bed: it may assist materially in the surgical management of tumors of the parotid gland.\r"

Measurements of the cross-sectional area of the upper airway were correlated with the findings on sleep studies in four patients. During the awake state the airway was narrowed and showed increased collapsibility in all eight patients. Five of the eight patients had cross-sectional areas of less than or equal to 4 mm2 at one or more sites at some time during the respiratory cycle while awake. During apnea all patients had obstruction at the uvula and oropharynx, but the length of the obstruction varied from one patient to another. In three of the eight patients the obstruction extended inferiorly to the hypopharynx. Cine CT can be used to objectively evaluate patients with sleep apnea and may demonstrate the need to modify surgical treatment.\r"

All studies were carried out at 1.5 T, and the results were correlated with chest radiographs or CT scans. All MR studies were interpreted before surgery (13 cases) and without knowledge of the results of other radiologic studies. MR findings indicative of chest-wall invasion included a high-signal focus within the chest wall and/or chest-wall thickening with increased signal on spin-echo (SE) images having a repetition time of 2500 msec and an echo time of 50-100 msec (SE 2500/50-100). In one case, noncontour-deforming high-signal intensity within chest-wall musculature (but no other abnormality) was demonstrated on SE 2500/50-100 images. Coronal or sagittal imaging facilitated identification of tumor contiguity with extrathoracic structures in apical lesions. Contrast differences between normal and invaded chest wall on T2-weighted images were the most helpful in assessing chest-wall involvement. These preliminary observations indicate that MR imaging is useful in the evaluation of chest-wall invasion by carcinoma of the lung.\r"

In this case-control study, 160 cases of breast cancer and 160 matched controls from a mammography referral practice were compared to determine the risk of breast cancer associated with each of these two radiographic measures. The mammographic densities were quantified on caudal projections by means of a compensating polar planimeter. A relative risk estimate of 3.3 (p less than .05) was associated with the P2 + DY patterns compared with the N1 + P1 patterns. Significantly elevated risks of 4.3 to 5.5 also were observed among women whose breasts contained at least 25% mammographic densities, compared with women with less than 25% involvement. These radiographic measures tended to be more predictive of the risk of breast cancer in black women than in white women. Although the precise clinical roles of breast parenchymal patterns and densities have not been defined fully, the results of this study suggest that they are useful in the recognition of women at high risk of breast cancer. We make no claims that the findings of this study are sufficiently developed to be used as a basis for screening strategies.\r"

In a retrospective review of 13 pathologically proven cases of hepatocellular adenoma with technetium-99m sulfur colloid scintigrams, Kupffer cells were present in all 13 cases. We observed uptake of the radiocolloid by the hepatocellular adenoma in three cases (23%), and there were no histologic differences between the tumors with uptake and the ones without it. We conclude that the currently accepted reason for the lack of technetium-99m sulfur colloid uptake within hepatocellular adenoma is incorrect, and an explanation other than a lack of Kupffer cells is responsible for the photon-deficient appearance in the majority of cases of hepatocellular adenoma. Further, because hepatocellular adenoma may have technetium-99m sulfur colloid uptake in a significant percentage of cases, it should be added to focal nodular hyperplasia in the differential diagnosis of a hepatic mass with uptake by technetium-99m sulfur colloid.\r"

These studies were prospectively analyzed for degree of portal perfusion and direction of flow, portal vein thrombosis, and presence and type of shunt surgery. Thirty-three MR examinations were determined to have grade I (good) or II (fair) portal blood flow. Twenty-nine of these were grade I or II by angiography; the other four were grade IV. Of the eight cases documented as grade IV (hepatofugal portal blood flow) by angiography, none were considered grade IV by MR, suggesting that MR was unable to detect retrograde flow. The other case was not graded because of cavernous transformation of the portal vein. MR correlated well with angiography for the detection or absence of portal vein thrombus, agreeing with angiography in 41 of 42 cases. Two angiographically proven cases of portal vein thrombosis were correctly identified on MR. MR correctly identified the absence of portal vein clot in 39 of 40 angiographically negative cases. MR and angiography also agreed in 41 of 42 cases that a shunt was either present/absent or patent/occluded. The single error was due to inadequate MR scanning in the region of interest. The results show that MR cannot be used to grade blood flow in the portal vein. However, MR accurately detects portal vein thrombosis and the patency of surgical shunts.\r"

Small-bowel series were available within 2-4 days of CT in eight patients and were positive in five. Surgical proof of intussusception was available in seven of the nine patients. Resected small-bowel specimens from patients with the reniform configuration revealed focal ischemic changes. Other objective parameters of ischemia such as acidosis and hyperamylasemia were also present in the two patients with reniform masses. Such changes were not evident in the other patients. This suggests that intussusceptions with reniform configurations warrant more urgent surgical attention. The varying patterns of intussusception on CT should be recognized so that appropriate management can be initiated.\r"

Decreases in the numbers of upper gastrointestinal examinations, small bowel studies, and barium enemas was 24%, 17%, and 29%, respectively. The number of oral cholecystograms declined 93%. Respondents listed the advent of new techniques (sonography, CT, and MR imaging) and competition from endoscopy as the two major factors that they thought contributed to these decreases. They thought that competition from endoscopy would be the factor most likely to affect the numbers of gastrointestinal fluoroscopic procedures in the near future.\r"

  ".W": "The capability of 1.5-T MR imaging to detect focal defects in articular cartilage was investigated with cadaveric knees with and without intraarticular injection of saline and gadolinium-DTPA (Gd-DTPA). Full-thickness cartilage lesions ranging in diameter from 1 to 5 mm were surgically created in the femoral articular surfaces. Images were acquired with a variety of pulse techniques, slice thicknesses, and interslice gaps as well as one or two signal excitations. Potential intraarticular contrast agents (saline and Gd-DTPA) were tested, and their signal behaviors compared with that of hyaline cartilage. All cartilage defects were occult on T1-weighted and balanced images without Gd-DTPA. The smallest defect identified by using intraarticular saline was 3 mm in diameter and was apparent only on T2-weighted images. Intraarticular Gd-DTPA afforded detection of defects as small as 2 mm, even with short imaging times. Signal-intensity differences between saline and articular cartilage were minimal on T1-weighted images and increased on T2-weighted images; intensity differences were high between Gd-DTPA and articular cartilage on all imaging sequences. These results indicate that intraarticular fluid and appropriate selection of imaging sequences are necessary for delineation of focal defects in articular cartilage. They also show that Gd-DTPA is the optimal contrast agent for this purpose.\r"

T1- and T2-weighted spin-echo images, fat- and water-selective spin-echo images, and out-of-phase images were obtained. The specimens were then sectioned, radiographed, and studied histologically. The capital epiphysis and greater trochanter in normal femurs had the highest signal on T1-weighted, fat-selective, and out-of-phase images owing to their high fat content. Fat-selective and water-selective images accurately depicted regions of fat and water, whereas T1-weighted, T2-weighted, and out-of-phase images were misleading in some cases. On T2-weighted images, a double line consisting of a rim of low signal with a high-signal inner border was noted surrounding AVN lesions. Histologic correlation showed that the low-signal outer rim was due to sclerotic bone, while the high-intensity inner border was due to granulation tissue and/or chondroid metaplasia. Fractures within the six AVN lesions were best seen on T2-weighted images, but these could not be distinguished from granulation tissue. On T2-weighted images, the weight-bearing cartilage had lower signal in five of six femoral heads with AVN. We conclude that the MR appearance of AVN reflects its complex histopathology. Direct spin-echo chemical-shift imaging can help correlate MR images with histology by providing information not available from conventional or out-of-phase images.\r"

We performed direct sagittal CT and sagittal MR on 15 fresh temporomandibular joint autopsy specimens and compared our diagnoses with cryosectional findings in a blinded fashion. We found no statistically significant differences between these procedures in detecting bony abnormalities or disk position. However, a side-by-side comparison between the CT and MR images demonstrated that MR depicted the soft-tissue anatomy of the joint with greater detail than did CT. Thus, MR clearly displayed the disk when it was positioned either superiorly or anteriorly, whereas CT only showed the disk adequately when it was positioned anteriorly. MR further showed the configuration of the disk and the borderlines between the disk and its attachments; these relationships could not be assessed from CT images. This experimental study indicates that MR is superior to CT for depiction of soft-tissue changes, whereas CT is superior in showing osseous abnormalities. Clinical confirmation of these results is necessary before one method can be definitively recommended over the other for clinical studies.\r"

Scintigrams of the tibial diaphyses were obtained at 48 hr, 1 week, 2 weeks, and 3 weeks after surgical creation of a simulated fracture (a 1.5-mm hole in the cortex). The mean sensitivity for detecting fractures in control animals was 95% at 48 hr and 100% at all other times. Mean sensitivity for rabbits given the high dose of hydrocortisone was 41% at 48 hr. Mean sensitivity for the low-dose group was 75% at 48 hr, but this was not significantly different from the control group. Sensitivity in both groups treated with hydrocortisone improved with time. At 3 weeks, the mean was 93% in the low-dose group and 83% in the high-dose group. These data suggest that 99mTc scintigraphy may be less sensitive in detecting bone trauma in patients on glucocorticoid therapy than in patients in the general population.\r"

  ".U": "87209584\r", 
  ".W": "Forty-nine patients with cervical spine fractures were identified among 160 patients who underwent CT of the cervical spine for blunt trauma. Although there was a high index of suspicion on the plain film interpretation, as well as a large percentage of false positives, many fractures were found on CT that were not suggested, even in retrospect, on the plain radiographs. Of the 136 fractures ultimately identified in these patients, CT detected 135 (99%) while only 64 (47%) were seen or suspected on the initial screening radiographs. At first glance, this might appear to discredit the plain films as a screening device. However, most of these \"occult\" fractures occurred in vertebrae that had been identified as probably fractured in other parts, for example, pedicle fractures found in vertebrae initially suspected of harboring only a vertebral body fracture. Most of the remainder of the uncovered fractures were in vertebrae immediately adjacent to ones that were initially identified as fractured. Indeed, of the 49 patients with fractures, only one had an adequately exposed and positioned plain film that was completely normal. The ability of CT to determine quickly and confidently the presence or absence of cervical fractures and to define the position of fragments in relation to the spinal canal is of considerable value in the medical and nursing management of the seriously traumatized patient. For example, when a fracture is seen or suspected on conventional films, a limited CT examination of the area is recommended. Plain films should be used to guide the CT examination so that an intact vertebra above and below the lesion is included. If an adequately exposed and positioned plain film series of the cervical spine is normal, it is unlikely that CT will reveal a fracture. While conventional radiographs fail to detect a surprising number of fractures, they retain their value as a screening tool and as a guide to selective CT imaging.\r"

Although several investigators have reported on the number of complications associated with the use of this procedure in malignant disease, none has determined specifically the number associated with its use in benign disease. Differences in the number of procedure-related complications and deaths were examined in 206 patients with benign or malignant biliary diseases who underwent percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage at the Toronto General Hospital during a 40-month period. Of these, 54 had benign and 152 had malignant biliary diseases. The prevalences of procedure-related major complications and deaths were 2% and 0%, respectively, in the benign group vs 7% and 3%, respectively, in the malignant group. These differences can be attributed to the shorter periods of drainage required and the generally better health of patients in the benign group. These findings suggest that percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage can be performed with substantially fewer complications in patients with benign biliary diseases compared to those with cancer. Previously reported data on complications were derived from patient populations with preponderantly malignant obstructions and cannot be extrapolated to patients with benign diseases.\r"

The purpose of this study was to quantify changes in body surface temperature and other physiologic parameters in humans during MR scanning at 1.5 T. Blood pressure, heart rate, respiration, and axillary temperature measurements were obtained on 27 normal volunteers. Measurements were made at RF power levels of 0, 0.2, and 0.8 W/kg, with the power sequence randomized. In 14 volunteers receiving lumbar scans, statistically significant increases in temperature were observed at RF power levels of 0.2 (+0.2 +/- 0.1 degree C) and 0.8 (+0.5 +/- 0.1 degree C) W/kg. No significant changes related to RF power were observed in blood pressure or respiratory rate. At the 0.8 W/kg level there was a slight increase in heart rate (3 +/- 1.3 beats per minute). In the 13 patients receiving head scans, physiologic changes were substantially smaller. The temperature increases and other physiologic changes observed during MR scanning with the 1.5 T imager at RF powers of 0.2 and 0.8 W/kg were small and of no clinical concern. Additional studies should be performed in patients with cardiac failure, vascular occulusion, and metallic implants or prostheses.\r"

  ".W": "External hydrocephalus (EH) is a condition in which infants with rapidly enlarging heads are found to have a CT scan that shows widening of the subarachnoid space with mild or no ventricular dilation. In this study, 74 infants with EH associated with a variety of conditions were examined clinically and with CT scans to identify the radiologic features of the condition as well as to understand its clinical and radiologic evolution. Some of these CT scans were compared with those of patients with cerebral atrophy. The characteristic CT findings in EH were bifrontal widening of the subarachnoid space and widened interhemispheric fissure frontally with only mild enlargement of the rest of the subarachnoid space. Occasional mild to moderate ventriculomegaly was also present. In most cases the radiologic findings could be distinguished from those seen in cerebral atrophy, even without the clinical history of an enlarging head. The cases of cerebral atrophy showed prominent sulci throughout without disproportionate bifrontal widening of the subarachnoid space. Two major groups of infants are identified. The largest group (47) consisted of infants with primary megaloencephaly. Megaloencephaly was idiopathic in 40 infants, many of whom (19) met the criteria for benign familial macrocephaly. Others (7) had a clearly defined genetic syndrome. The radiologic abnormalities in these infants usually disappear by 2 years of age. The other major group (14) consisted of infants who sustained CNS or systemic insults such as subdural hematomas (8) or meningitis (3), which cause impaired CSF absorption. Thirteen premature infants with EH were also identified. It is concluded that EH is an age-related self-limited condition occurring in infants with open cranial sutures and that usually resolves without intervention by 2-3 years of age.\r"

  ".W": "The accuracy, safety, pitfalls, and limitations of trauma angiography were determined by comparing the findings of 280 arteriograms performed for suspected arterial trauma with the patients' surgical findings and clinical courses. Trauma angiography was accurate, with a sensitivity for detecting major arterial injury of 98.3%, specificity of 98.5%, positive predictive value of 95.0%, and negative predictive value of 99.5%. Angiography was effective in eliminating the need for surgical arterial exploration in 203 cases (73%). These emergency procedures were associated with a 5% morbidity; all complications were minor. Sixteen percent of the studies were technically compromised. Common factors included poor vessel opacification with aortic contrast injection, over-penetrated films, mistimed lower extremity studies, and overlapped structures obscuring the vessels. In most cases, the field of study can be limited to a region 5 cm beyond the most distant fracture fragment, bullet fragment, and entrance or exit wound. Emergency trauma angiography is an ideal technique for evaluating injured patients with suspected arterial trauma. It is safe to perform and accurately separates patients who may be spared surgical exploration from those who require vascular intervention.\r"

  ".U": "87209599\r", 
  ".W": "Most soft-tissue masses and tumors of various etiologies and histologies have high signal intensity on T2-weighted pulse sequences (long T2). Of 47 soft-tissue masses, seven had a low signal (short T2) on T2-weighted pulse sequences. All seven masses were tumors, and histologic review showed that their composition differed from that of the other 40 lesions with a long T2 in that the seven masses were relatively acellular and had more collagen. The tumors with a short T2 included one malignant and six benign soft-tissue tumors. Malignant fibrous histiocytoma and aggressive fibromatosis showed paradoxical signal intensities in that they showed both long and short T2. All of the tumors with low signal intensity on T2-weighted images had significant fibrous elements and marked hypocellularity. This study suggests that the less commonly encountered short T2 may be seen in both benign and malignant soft-tissue lesions. A part of the explanation for the low signal on T2-weighted sequences appears to be the relative acellularity and abundant collagen of these tumors in comparison with those that have the same histologic diagnoses but show a high signal. The histologic composition of the tumor rather than the histologic diagnosis appears to influence the MR signal on T2-weighted sequences.\r"

Although such methods can remove coherent ghosting artifacts, motion during gradient pulses also leads to poor image quality. This is due to phase variations at the echo caused by changes in velocity from one phase-encoding view to the next. The effect becomes severe for long sampling times and long TE values and can lead to low estimates of T2. We discuss general, robust modifications of the standard gradient or spin-echo sequences by using rephasing gradients that force the phase of constant-velocity moving spins to be zero at the echo. These sequences lead to a significant reduction in motion artifacts and hence improvement in image quality. They can be applied to multislice, multiecho, water/fat, and gating schemes as well. Since motion problems are universal, it would appear that these modified sequences should come into common usage for MR imaging.\r"

Because perfluorochemicals have no protons, they cause no MR signal. Since they are immiscible with water, they create a signal void in bowel independent of bowel contents and thus are suitable as oral contrast agents. Furthermore, they are tasteless and odorless and have no side effects. We evaluated the use of perfluorochemicals by performing MR scans of the abdomen in rats after the oral administration of unemulsified perfluorohexylbromide or perfluoroctylbromide. Since the latter is approved as an investigational drug for oral use in humans, two volunteers were also studied. Both compounds created signal void in the bowel of both rats and human subjects allowing identification of the gastrointestinal tract. The results suggest that these compounds have potential as oral contrast agents for MR imaging.\r"

To examine the relationship of cardiovascular reactivity with BP levels 4 years later, three cardiovascular response tasks (orthostatic, handgrip, and cold pressor) were administered. Partial correlations, adjusted for initial resting BP, showed that peak BP responses to the three tasks were related to future resting systolic and diastolic BP. Further analyses showed that DBP reactivity was related to future BP tracking in children with high DBP levels. In the high DBP group, while resting DBP levels did not differ for trackers vs nontrackers, peak DBP responses to each of the three tasks did (orthostatic, p less than 0.001; handgrip, p less than 0.05; cold pressor, p less than 0.01). The combination of resting and peak BP levels may provide more powerful predictions of future BP levels in children.\r"

Risk of night blindness was halved for children reportedly given VAC, although 2.5% of the reportedly protected population were still night blind. There was no significant reduction in prevalence of Bitot's spot. Risk of corneal ulcers or keratomalacia (X3A/B) was 2.7 times higher in children not given VAC. Based on reported coverage, efficacy of protection against potentially blinding corneal lesions was 63%. For maximum impact on eye lesions, massive dosing with vitamin A at ideally less than 6-monthly intervals needs to be combined with other nutrition and health interventions.\r"

Tinidazole and metronidazole were somewhat less active, with MIC90s of 4.09 mg/L (23.9 mumol/L) and 4.44 mg/L (18.0 mumol/L), respectively. The acid metabolite was inactive, with an MIC90 value of 226.55 mg/L (1.22 mmol/L).

Alterations in mucosal immunity may explain the increased incidence of enteric infections, and contamination of the upper small intestine with bacteria may be the cause of weight loss observed in these patients. To test this hypothesis we studied the mucosal T lymphocyte subset in duodenal mucosal biopsies in 14 AIDS and seven control patients. Duodenal fluid was also cultured for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. There was a significant decrease among leu-3a T cells (helper/inducer) subset in AIDS. The proportion of mucosal T cells reacting with leu-2a (cytotoxic/suppressor) was significantly increased in AIDS patients. These patients also had a significant reversal of the normal mucosal helper/suppressor T cell ratio. There was no change in the number of leu-7 cells (cells mediate natural killer and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity) as compared to controls. All patients with diarrhea and three of five patients without diarrhea had bacteria in their duodenal fluid. Mean number of organisms was 4.5 X 10(4)/ml. Cultures were negative in all control subjects. The results reveal that the abnormalities of T cell subpopulation in the blood of AIDS patients also occur in their duodenal mucosa. This immunological abnormality is associated with the bacterial colonization of upper gastrointestinal tract which may explain the diarrhea and weight loss observed in majority of our patients. The results also indicate that increased incidence of enteric infections in AIDS may be explained on the basis of altered mucosal immunity.\r"

Two of five patients lost HBeAg from serum. Furthermore, characteristic increases of serum aminotransferase were observed during r-IL2 therapy. This rise might have been mediated by enhanced immune responses to hepatitis B virus and increased rate of lysis of the infected hepatocytes. No consistent changes in immune markers such as OKT4 positive cells or OKT8 positive cells were demonstrated during or after the therapy. The activities of natural killer cells gradually increased during therapy, although they tended to decrease within 1 wk after the start of r-IL2 injections. In two responders who lost HBeAg from serum, the natural killer activity was high before the therapy, compared with nonresponders. Furthermore, the percentage of OKT4-positive cells in the responders was increased within 1 to 2 wk after starting r-IL2 injections. These findings suggest that the responders might be immunologically different from the nonresponders. Recombinant-IL2 therapy over short periods did not result in complete clearance of hepatitis B virus. Further studies with high doses of r-IL2 given over longer periods are warranted.\r"

  ".W": "Whether genetic factors other than the protease-inhibitor (PI) polymorphism itself contribute to variation in alpha-1-antitrypsin is of both theoretical and practical interest. We have measured the quantity of alpha-1-antitrypsin (by an immunoturbidometric assay) and its activity (by assaying elastase inhibitory capacity [EIC]) in 583 individuals from 114 twin kinships who were also typed for PI by isoelectric focusing. Models of variation were fitted directly to the raw observations by a maximum-likelihood method. Specification of phenotypic means led to highly significant improvements in fit over models including only individual environment variance and additive genetic variance. The 29 phenotype means could also be described as the appropriate additive combinations of the 12 allelic effects. Only small improvements in fit could then be obtained by addition of polygenic components of variance. We conclude that nearly all genetic variation in alpha-1-antitrypsin quantity and activity can be explained by detectable variation at the PI locus and that this variance is largely additive. Bivariate analysis of alpha-1-antitrypsin and EIC revealed marginal evidence for differences in specific activities of molecules coded by different PI alleles. The correlation between environmental deviations for the two measures was only .63, which may reflect, in part, the rather low reliability of the assays and account for the modest heritabilities (less than .5) of the two measures. An intriguing finding was the presence of significant differences in E1 variance for different PI types, suggesting that different phenotypes have differing capacities to react to environmental challenges.\r"

  ".W": "Epidermal growth factor receptors are present in many reproductive tissues but have not been demonstrated in the human corpus luteum. To determine the presence of epidermal growth factor receptors and its binding characteristics, we carried out studies on the plasma cell membrane fraction of seven human corpora lutea (days 16 to 25) of the menstrual cycle. Specific epidermal growth factor receptors were present in human corpus luteum. Insulin, nerve growth factor, and human chorionic gonadotropin did not competitively displace epidermal growth factor binding. The optimal conditions for corpus luteum-epidermal growth factor receptor binding were found to be incubation for 2 hours at 4 degrees C with 500 micrograms plasma membrane protein and 140 femtomol 125I-epidermal growth factor per incubate. The number (mean +/- SEM) of epidermal growth factor binding sites was 12.34 +/- 2.99 X 10(-19) mol/micrograms protein; the dissociation constant was 2.26 +/- 0.56 X 10(-9) mol/L; the association constant was 0.59 +/- 0.12 X 10(9) L/mol. In two regressing corpora lutea obtained on days 2 and 3 of the menstrual cycle, there was no detectable specific epidermal growth factor receptor binding activity. Similarly no epidermal growth factor receptor binding activity could be detected in ovarian stromal tissue. Our findings demonstrate that specific receptors for epidermal growth factor are present in the human corpus luteum. The physiologic significance of epidermal growth factor receptors in human corpus luteum is unknown, but epidermal growth factor may be involved in intragonadal regulation of luteal function.\r"

Both metronidazole-resistant and metronidazole-sensitive strains possessed both types of sex hormone-binding proteins. The estrogen receptor binding was competitively inhibited by the antiestrogen tamoxifen citrate, and the androgen binding was competitively inhibited by the antiandrogen cyoctol. The presence of these specific receptors may allow the use of hormonal and antihormonal manipulation in the treatment of infections caused by these organisms.\r"

Expectant management was associated with the development of abruptio placentae in 19 of these 298 patients (6.3%). The prevalence of abruptio placentae in the entire population during the same 3-year period was 2.7%, whereas in patients without preterm premature rupture of the membranes it was 2%. None of the patients developed clinical or laboratory evidence of disseminated intravascular coagulation and no infection (maternal or neonatal) was noted among the patients who had abruptio placentae. Patients with preterm premature rupture of the membranes and severe oligohydramnios (largest pocket less than 1 cm) seem to be at particular risk for developing this complication. These data suggest that abruptio placentae should be considered as one of the possible risks of expectant management in preterm premature rupture of the membranes.\r"

Immunized BALB/c mice exhibited mixed mononuclear cell reactions, with granulomatous inflammation, collagen deposition, and fibrinoid necrosis at the site of infection. In contrast, naive animals displayed a monomorphic picture composed of largely vacuolated and parasitized macrophages with areas of coagulative necrosis. Electron microscopy revealed an increased number of eosinophils, sometimes in close contact with parasitized macrophages, in immunized animals. These findings illustrate that histologic changes reflect host immune status in cutaneous leishmaniasis, and that susceptibility of BALB/c mice to L m amazonensis, although dependent on genetic background, can be artificially modified.\r"

The depressed patients' CRH levels were significantly correlated with 4:00 p.m. postdexamethasone plasma cortisol levels. While the inclusion of a depressed patient with an outlier CRH value resulted in the loss of statistical significance for both of these findings, the authors suggest that these results support the hypothesis that hypercortisolism in depressed patients in part reflects a defect at or above the hypothalamus, resulting in hypersecretion of CRH.\r"

Children were selected to obtain three equal-sized groups: one without respiratory symptoms, one with symptoms of persistent wheeze, and one with cough or phlegm production but without persistent wheeze. Parents completed a daily diary of symptoms from which illness constellations of upper respiratory illness (URI) and lower respiratory illness (LRI) and the symptom of wheeze were derived. Peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) was measured daily for nine consecutive weeks during the eight-month study period. Maximum hourly concentrations of sulfur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, ozone, and coefficient of haze for each 24-hour period, as well as minimum hourly temperature, were correlated with daily URI, LRI, wheeze, and PEFR using multiple regression models adjusting for illness occurrence or level of PEFR on the immediately preceding day. Respiratory illness on the preceding day was the most important predictor of current illness. A drop in temperature was associated with increased URI and LRI but not with increased wheeze or with a decrease in level of PEFR. No air pollutant was strongly associated with respiratory illness or with level of PEFR, either in the group of children as a whole, or in either of the symptomatic subgroups; the pollutant concentrations observed, however, were uniformly lower than current ambient air quality standards. Moreover, since exposure estimation based on monitoring of ambient air likely results in misclassification of the true exposure, the negative findings of this study must be interpreted cautiously.\r"

The observed prevalence of dyskinesia was greater among exposed subjects in all 21 studies; we estimate that, on the average, the occurrence rate was 2.9 times greater in exposed persons than would be expected if they had been unexposed. We estimate that 65 per cent of exposed cases and 51 per cent of all cases in these investigations were caused by long-term neuroleptic exposure. Among adult United States residents in 1980, we estimate that there were approximately 193,000 neuroleptic-induced TD cases of which about 60 per cent occurred in outpatients. We also observed substantial heterogeneity of effect (rate ratio) across studies, however, partially explained, by changes and differences in the rate of dyskinesia, by differences in the frequency of certain effect modifiers, and by differences in diagnostic methods. Methodologic limitations of the studies and their possible effects on our results are discussed.\r"

However, the proportions of the helper/inducer T cells were lower in untreated patients than in the controls (18.9% vs. 39.7%) while the levels of suppressor/cytotoxic T cells were higher than in the controls (40.5% vs. 27.8%). After successful antileishmania treatment these levels showed a gradual return towards normal over a period of one year.

These patients presented with clinical and radiologic findings that did not clearly distinguish them from patients with other infectious or neoplastic processes. Excisional biopsies usually showed tachyzoites on routine histology, but needle biopsies were usually negative unless mouse inoculation or immunoperoxidase staining was employed. Response to pyrimethamine and sulfadiazine therapy was often prompt, but therapy had to be continued for long periods of time to maintain a clinical response, and no alternative regimen of one or more drugs appeared to be effective in patients unable to tolerate both pyrimethamine and sulfadiazine.\r"

The volume of cardioplegia solution required to achieve and maintain cardiac asystole during ACC while on CPB was not significantly different in the two groups. After the release of ACC, the energy of direct current countershock required for defibrillation, the incidence of heart block, and the need for pacemaker were not significantly different. However, defibrillation was more readily achieved by a single countershock in the verapamil group than in the control group. Also, the incidence of ST segment changes after defibrillation was significantly lower in the verapamil group, suggesting that verapamil pretreatment before ACC may potentiate the myocardial preservation achieved by the cardioplegia, and hence may decrease the incidence of ischemic changes during the critical reperfusion period.\r"

Of 48 adult patients investigated prospectively after termination of cardiopulmonary bypass, two presented a sudden increase of airway pressure, acute pulmonary hypertension, and systemic hypotension 1-3 min after right atrial protamine injection. In these two subjects, plasma levels of C5a increased from 0.7 and 2.2 to 9.8 and 9.9 ng/ml, respectively, and thromboxane B2 increased from 0.26 and 0.34 to 7.5 and 16.2 ng/ml 1 minute after drug injection. A third subject not identified prospectively had an identical reaction and mediator profile (C5a, 10.2 ng/ml; TxB2, 18.6 ng/ml at 1 min). The plasma levels of these mediators were unchanged in the remaining patients (C5a, 0.7 +/- 1.1 [x +/- S.D.] to 0.6 +/- 0.9 ng/ml; TxB2, 0.16 +/- 0.12 to 0.15 +/- 0.07 ng/ml). Plasma histamine was not involved in this type of reaction, but increased from 0.7-10.4 ng/ml in a fourth patient who became hypotensive without acute pulmonary hypertension, bronchoconstriction, or elevation of C5a or TxB2. The authors' data indicate that the generation of high plasma levels of C5a anaphylatoxins and thromboxane is associated with pulmonary vaso- and broncho-constriction induced by protamine reversal of heparin in humans.\r"

All patients were premedicated and maintained on their preoperative medications (beta-blockers, nitrates, Ca++ entry blockers) up to and including the morning of surgery. Systemic and pulmonary hemodynamics and global (coronary sinus, CS) and regional (great cardiac vein, GCV) coronary blood flows were measured, and blood samples were obtained for systemic and myocardial metabolic parameters: after induction with 30 mcg/kg of sufentanil and 0.12 mg/kg vecuronium (FIO2 1.0), but prior to incision (control); 5 min after sternotomy; and during ventilation with isoflurane-oxygen. Heart rate, cardiac output, stroke volume, and GCV/CS flow ratio did not change throughout the study. Neither global nor regional myocardial lactate production was detected in any patient at any time, and the electrocardiogram (lead II, V5) remained unchanged. In response to sternotomy, seven of nine patients experienced an increase in mean systemic arterial pressure of 20% or more (27 +/- 3% from control values), due to an elevation in systemic vascular resistance (30 +/- 5%). Coronary sinus (CS) and great cardiac vein (GCV) flows, as well as CS and GCV lactate extractions, were unchanged 5 min after sternotomy. Both global and regional myocardial oxygen extraction increased, while coronary venous oxygen content decreased. Isoflurane was administered in a dose that restored systemic arterial pressure to baseline values (inspired concentration 0.75-1.0%).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

We analyzed the effects of interleukin-2 regimens on renal function in 99 consecutive patients. Interleukin-2 therapy with or without lymphokine-activated killer cells was associated with varying degrees of hypotension, fluid retention, azotemia, oliguria, and low fractional sodium excretion. After the patients completed the interleukin-2 regimens, their renal function improved promptly. Renal function values returned to baseline levels within 7 days in 62% of patients, within 14 days in 84%, and within 30 days in 95%. Pretherapy serum creatinine values above 1.4 mg/dL predicted the severity of azotemia and prolonged duration of renal functional recovery, interleukin-2 therapeutic regimens induce prerenal azotemia. Careful selection of patients and early detection of adverse physiologic changes may alleviate the side effects of interleukin-2 therapy.\r"

Cyclophosphamide was added to this regimen in 1969. On three separate occasions her disease relapsed when cyclophosphamide therapy was discontinued. In 1984, she developed cyclophosphamide-resistant disease and drug toxicity. We were able to discontinue cyclophosphamide therapy after a trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole regimen that was begun in February 1985 led to rapid improvement, a fall in the erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and a complete remission. Her 22-year survival is the longest one reported. Because patients with Wegener granulomatosis sometimes respond to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, this therapy deserves careful study and implies that Wegener granulomatosis is an as yet unidentified infection.\r"

The compound was effective against the altered thymidine kinase induced by acyclovir- and bromovinyldeoxyuridine-resistant virus variants. At 100 microM 5'-ethynylthymidine, the cellular pool size of dTTP in herpes simplex virus type 1-infected cells was 5% that of infected cells receiving no drug treatment, while there was no significant effect on the pool sizes of dATP, dGTP, and dCTP. There was a positive correlation between dTTP pools and the intracellular thymidine kinase activity of herpes simplex virus type 1-infected cells. When tested alone, 5'-ethynylthymidine exhibited no antiviral activity, but it antagonized the antiviral efficacy of five compounds which require viral thymidine kinase for their action.\r"

Ampicillin-susceptible (AS) and ampicillin-resistant (AR) challenge strains were employed. Treatment with enoxacin or ofloxacin produced intrapulmonary killing of H. influenzae that was superior to that achieved with ampicillin (P less than 0.01 to P less than 0.001 for both AS and AR strains). Ofloxacin and enoxacin also provided killing greater than that with chloramphenicol for the AS strain (P less than 0.01 to P less than 0.001). For the AR strain, ofloxacin provided killing greater than that obtained with chloramphenicol (P less than 0.001). Survival from AS strain pneumonia was 60% in enoxacin-treated and 78% in ofloxacin-treated animals compared with 41% for chloramphenicol-treated and 23% for ampicillin-treated groups. We conclude that enoxacin and ofloxacin may be effective antimicrobial agents in treating either AS or AR strains causing H. influenzae pneumonia.\r"

Few patients had hypocomplementemia. One patient had nephropathy. Most patients had an unchanged, benign disease course for, on the average, nine years. It is suggested that the term mixed connective tissue disease (MCTD) be reserved for such patients, and that the acronym MCTD be changed to SRA (swollen fingers, Raynaud's phenomenon, and arthritis).

The risk of UGI tract bleeding within 30 days after each prescription for the drug of interest was examined.

A retrospective review of 12 charts per physician over a six-month period was used to compare the charting behavior of three practice groups. Each group was comprised of an attending preceptor and a resident in each of the first, second, and third years of residency. Compared with the other two ambulatory preceptors, one ambulatory preceptor had significantly fewer charts with problem lists, medication lists, and health maintenance records as well as a lower ratio of psychosocial problems to total problems noted on his problem lists. The medical records of the residents supervised by this ambulatory preceptor were also significantly more deficient in each of these areas than the medical records of the other two resident groups. The fact that poor medical record keeping by an ambulatory preceptor was similarly deficient for the residents he supervised across each major area studied suggests that the ambulatory preceptor's actual practice behavior may exert a broad influence on the behavior of his residents. Future educational efforts in primary care internal medicine should be partially directed toward the ambulatory preceptors who serve as potent role models.\r"

Using supraorbital and lateral canthus electrodes to detect eye movement, we deleted EEG epochs during eye movement in 15 medication-free patients with schizophrenia and in 13 normal control subjects. Power spectral analysis of the 28-channel EEG demonstrated a diffuse mild increase in delta activity in schizophrenic patients compared with normal control subjects but no tendency for frontal localization of this slow activity. There were no differences between schizophrenic patients and normal control subjects in other frequency bands. These results, which replicate earlier findings of increased delta activity in schizophrenia, emphasize the importance of excluding the slow activity due to eye movement in the comparisons of summed EEG spectra. This emphasis can best be ensured by equating the summed spectra from extraocular movement channels of experimental and control groups.\r"

An asymptomatic Meckel's diverticulum was discovered incidentally at laparotomy in 132 children. Surgical therapy included bowel resection in nine patients with volvulus, four with intussusception, seven with bleeding, three with vitelline cysts, and one with a perforation. Diverticulectomy was performed in 189 cases, and excision of a patent vitelline duct was accomplished in four neonates with umbilical drainage. Ectopic gastric mucosa was present in all 48 patients with bleeding and in four of five with inflammation but in only two asymptomatic specimens. More than one third of the cases were symptomatic and presented in younger patients. This suggests that elective resection of asymptomatic vitelline remnants in early childhood is reasonable at the time of laparotomy for other conditions.\r"

It is precipitated by a wide variety of factors in addition to nerve injury. It occurs outside of dermatomal distributions and can spread to involve other extremities without new injury. The diagnosis is primarily clinical, but roentgenography, scintigraphy, and sympathetic blockade can help to confirm the diagnosis. The most successful therapies are directed toward blocking the sympathetic innervation to the affected extremity, in conjunction with physical therapy. The theories proposed to explain the pathophysiology of reflex sympathetic dystrophy include \"reverberating circuits\" in the spinal cord that are triggered by intense pain, ephaptic transmission between sympathetic efferents and sensory afferents, and the presence of ectopic pacemakers in an injured nerve.\r"

However, all of these isolates have been sensitive to vancomycin. These findings prompted us to reevaluate the retinal toxicity and clearance of intravitreal vancomycin in pigmented rabbits. Doses up to 2 mg were found to be nontoxic in phakic and aphakic-vitrectomized eyes. Clearance was determined in phakic and aphakic-vitrectomized rabbit eyes with or without intact lens capsules. The antibiotic was cleared most slowly in phakic eyes. Aphakic-vitrectomized eyes without an intact lens capsule cleared antibiotic most rapidly, while aphakic-vitrectomized eyes with intact capsules exhibited an intermediate clearance rate. In addition, the interaction between vancomycin and gentamicin on gram-positive endophthalmitis isolates was found to be additive or synergistic depending on the bacterial species. Based on these data, we recommend the combination of vancomycin and an aminoglycoside as the initial antibiotic therapy for exogenous bacterial endophthalmitis.\r"

Rats were immunized with varying doses of peptide M ranging from 1 to 100 micrograms in complete Freund's adjuvant. As little as 5 micrograms of the synthetic peptide was sufficient for the induction of disease. Clinically, the disease that developed was characterized by iris and pericorneal hyperemia followed by exudates in the anterior chamber. Histopathologically, a severe inflammatory response was observed in animals immunized with high doses of the peptide (greater than 50 micrograms). In these eyes the photoreceptor cell layer of the retina was completely destroyed. A massive subretinal exudate containing mononuclear cells and polymorphonuclear leukocytes was also present. The inflammatory changes were generally less severe following immunization with low doses of the peptide (less than 50 micrograms), and in some eyes only occasional focal lesions were observed. In addition, animals with ocular inflammatory disease had associated pinealitis characterized by a lymphocytic infiltration of the subcapsular and central area of the pineal gland. Both clinically and histopathologically, the experimental autoimmune uveitis produced by the synthetic peptide was indistinguishable from the disease caused by native S-antigen. We comment on the significance of these findings and the relationship of S-antigen in the pathogenesis of experimental autoimmune uveitis.\r"

Prior to adoptive transfer, the T cells were restimulated in tissue culture with peptide M. Approximately five days following the intravenous administration of restimulated T cells, a severe uveitis was documented both clinically and histopathologically. Clinically, the disease was characterized by iris hyperemia followed by anterior chamber exudates and posterior iris synechiae. Histopathologically, the photoreceptor cell layer of the retina was completely destroyed. A subretinal exudate containing mononuclear cells and polymorphonuclear leukocytes was also present. In addition, the pineal glands of animals with experimental autoimmune uveitis showed inflammatory changes characterized by a lymphocytic infiltration of the subcapsular and central region of the gland. The clinical and histopathologic features of the experimental autoimmune uveitis were similar to those that develop following the adoptive transfer of T cells from Lewis rats previously immunized with S-antigen. Our results indicate that the amino acid sequence of the region of S-antigen corresponding to peptide M represents a distinct pathogenic site with the ability to adoptively transfer disease.

  ".W": "Sequential skin biopsies from six patients with severe psoriasis were studied during treatment with cyclosporin. Four of the patients cleared completely and the remaining two showed a marked improvement. A subset of dendritic cells, HLA-DR+ but lacking the T6 antigen characteristically expressed by Langerhans cells (DR+ 6-), was observed in lesional epidermis. They disappeared during treatment, before clinical improvement was apparent and at a rate which correlated with clearance of psoriasis. These cells were not found in normal or uninvolved psoriatic epidermis and their number in lesional skin appeared to be related to the clinical severity of the disease. Total numbers of CD4 and CD8, and HLA-DR+ CD8 T cells were substantially reduced in both epidermis and dermis prior to clinical improvement. In contrast, there was generally no decrease in the number of HLA-DR+ CD4 T cells in the epidermis during resolution, whereas these cells were reduced by an average of 68% in the dermis. The beneficial effects of cyclosporin in psoriasis further support the hypothesis that T cells play a central role in the pathogenesis of psoriasis. The cellular changes observed in the skin during cyclosporin treatment may help to elucidate the effects of this drug on immunoregulatory mechanisms in man.\r"

The first 'half-life' of about 20 h (0-24 h after delivery or surgery) was of the same order of magnitude in all groups studied and corresponded well to previously published values. The mean second 'half-life' (greater than 24 h after delivery or surgery) was significantly longer in term (72.2 h) and in ectopic pregnancies (64.1 h) than in first trimester pregnancies (45.5 h).

In the current study, we reviewed the hematologic effects associated with this therapy in our initial 42 patients. Eighty-eight percent of the treated patients developed anemia that required greater than or equal to 4 units of red cell transfusions, and 43% received at least 8 units. Only a blood loss of 2 to 3 units could be attributed to repeated phlebotomy, cytophereses, and hemodilution. IL-2 administration also resulted in thrombocytopenia as well as lymphopenia and eosinophilia. Forty-three percent of patients developed platelet counts of less than or equal to 50,000/microL, and 36% of the total group required platelet transfusions. Mild neutropenia and a rebound lymphocytosis followed discontinuation of IL-2 treatment. To explore the possible mechanisms for these hematologic effects, standard hematopoietic colony assays were conducted on serial blood samples from five patients. IL-2 produced a significant decline in circulating erythroid (BFU-E) and granulocytic/macrophage (CFU-C) progenitors, which rebounded after the discontinuation of IL-2 therapy. Infusion of IL-2 also resulted in measurable serum levels of gamma-interferon. Some of the hematologic effects of immunotherapy with LAK cells and IL-2 may be the result of IL-2-mediated suppression of hematopoiesis.\r"

Although all the patients showed bcr rearrangements in non-T cell fractions, T cell populations lacked respective gene recombinations. Moreover, by Southern blot analyses using T cell receptor beta chain sequences our data indicate polyclonality of T cell samples from 11 of 12 cases; in one patient a clonal T cell population could be identified. These results suggest that T lineages of most Ph-positive CML patients are not derived from pluripotent stem cells involved in leukemogenesis and thus confirm previous investigations based on cytogenetic or glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase analyses. The demonstration of polyclonal T cell populations may reflect persistence of stem cells committed to differentiate only into T cells.\r"

The presence of the ABO blood group has a significant influence on vWF:Ag values; individuals with blood group O had the lowest mean vWF:Ag level (74.8 U/dL), followed by group A (105.9 U/dL), then group B (116.9 U/dL), and finally group AB (123.3 U/dL). Multiple regression analysis revealed that age significantly correlated with vWF:Ag levels in each blood group. We then performed reverse ABO typing on stored plasma from 142 patients with the diagnosis of von Willebrand disease (vWd). Of 114 patients with type I vWd, blood group O was found in 88 (77%), group A in 21 (18%), group B in 5 (4%), and group AB in none (0%), whereas the frequency of these blood groups in the normal population is significantly different (45%, 45%, 7% and 3%, respectively) (P less than .001). Patients with type II or III vWd had ABO blood group frequencies that were not different from the expected distribution. There may be a subset of symptomatic vWd patients with decreased concentrations of structurally normal vWf (vWd, type I) on the basis of blood group O. Some individuals of blood group AB with a genetic defect of vWF may have the diagnosis overlooked because vWF levels are elevated due to blood type.\r"

Analysis of the molecularly cloned viral genomes of one donor-recipient pair showed that virus from the recipient had restriction enzyme site differences from the donor, noticeably clustered in the env and orf-2 regions, and also had a greater number of restriction sites in common with the donor as well. These results suggest that HIV may undergo genomic variation in vivo. Comparison of donor-recipient viruses may further the understanding of the molecular basis for AIDS pathogenesis.\r"

  ".W": "A small subset of leukemic cells from most patients with acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML) have properties of stem cells and can be assayed by colony formation in agar or methylcellulose. Colony formation generally requires the addition of exogenous growth factors, but the exact factors required are incompletely defined. The AML colony-promoting activities of two recombinant human colony-stimulating factors (GM-CSF and G-CSF) were investigated by using blasts from 48 patients with AML. In nine cases, no colonies formed with either CSF. In seven cases colonies formed only in response to G-CSF and in 11 cases only in response to GM-CSF. In 21 cases colonies formed in response to either GM-CSF or G-CSF, and in 12 of these cases there was an additive effect between the two CSFs in determining maximum colony size. For cases responding to both GM- and G-CSF, the total number of colonies formed in response to the combination of both CSFs was almost always less than additive compared with the number of colonies formed in response to the individual CSFs. Further, the AML-CFU responding to either GM-CSF or G-CSF could not be distinguished by surface markers or by the cytochemical staining pattern of the colonies. These results suggest that there is considerable overlap between the GM-CSF- and G-CSF-responsive AML-CFU subpopulations in most cases. For five of seven cases, the combination of GM-CSF and G-CSF could replace a leukocyte feeder layer in providing maximum growth stimulation. These results indicate that GM-CSF and G-CSF are active growth factors for AML cells and are frequently additive in promoting maximum colony size.\r"

  ".U": "87215051\r", 
  ".W": "The fundamental pattern of coordinated eye-head roll motion is based upon utricular/saccular as well as vertical canal input, and mediated by the graviceptive pathways from the labyrinths via pontomedullary vestibular nuclei to the rostral midbrain tegmentum. The tonic bilateral graviceptive input stabilizes the eyes and head in the normal upright position. A unilateral lesion causes imbalance in vestibular tone in the roll plane which results in a tonic ipsiversive ocular tilt reaction (OTR). OTR, the triad of ipsilateral head tilt, skew deviation and ocular torsion, occurred as a tonic response (nonparoxysmal) persisting over months to years and was presumed to be due to upper brainstem lesions in 3 patients. Precise localization was limited because of the nature of the lesions. A reversible tonic OTR was seen with acute infarction of the dorsolateral medulla oblongata in 4 out of 11 patients. It may be explained by an ipsilateral lesion of the posterior canal pathways. Transient OTR seems not to be rare in acute Wallenberg's syndrome and ocular torsion in these patients is dysconjugate with predominant excyclotropia of the ipsilateral hypotropic eye. A deviation of the subjective visual vertical in the direction of the spontaneous head tilt--a previously undescribed feature of OTR--was present in all 7 patients and indicates a pathological shift of the internal representation of the gravitational vector. With respect to perception (subjective vertical) it is proposed that the manifest ipsiversive OTR represents a motor compensation of an apparent eye-head tilt contraversive to the lesioned side. Despite the resulting postural imbalance and the conflicting true vertical of the visual surround, the eyes, head and body are continuously adjusted to what the central nervous system erroneously computes as being vertical.\r"

To investigate the effect of human recombinant IL-2 on proliferative and cytotoxic responses in burn patients, peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 20 severely burned patients (body surface area (BSA) greater than 20 per cent) were studied in this way. Proliferative response measured by tritiated thymidine uptake was impaired from week 2 following injury. IL-2-activated cytotoxicity to NK-resistant target T24 was significantly impaired from week 2. To clarify if the defect in cytotoxic response is due to a decreased number of cell precursors or due to reduced responsiveness to IL-2, a limiting dilution assay was introduced. However, there was no reduction in precursor cell numbers. These data suggest that, in addition to impaired IL-2 production, there is an endogenous defect in IL-2 responsiveness. This may be of clinical importance since it is not possible to reverse this defect, at least in vitro.\r"

  ".W": "Unstable angina that occurs in the early postinfarction period is associated with an increased incidence of unfavorable cardiac events despite aggressive medical therapy. We examined the results of coronary angioplasty in 47 consecutive patients with postinfarction unstable angina who were referred for the procedure 12.9 +/- 7 days following myocardial infarction, 14 of which were Q wave and 33 of which were non-Q-wave. Coronary angioplasty was performed on a total of 55 arteries with a mean predilatation stenosis of 95 +/- 8%. These included 46 infarct-related arteries and nine noninfarct arteries. Double-vessel angioplasty was performed in eight patients. Successful coronary angioplasty (greater than 30% reduction of predilatation stenosis) was achieved in 43 patients (91%), with a mean residual stenosis of 33 +/- 28%. There was one in-hospital death, one patient required emergency bypass surgery, and two patients had early reocclusion resulting in myocardial infarctions. The 39 patients who had successful angioplasty procedures and who were discharged from the hospital without an unfavorable outcome were followed for 16.3 +/- 7 months, and repeat coronary angioplasty was required in five patients from 45 to 105 days after the initial procedure. Two patients had subsequent elective bypass surgery, one had a recurrent myocardial infarction, and one patient had a noncardiac death. For selected patients with suitable coronary anatomy, coronary angioplasty appears to offer an efficacious therapeutic option for early postinfarction unstable angina.\r"

  ".W": "The action of procaine on pharmaco-mechanical coupling activated by application of acetylcholine (ACh) was investigated using collagenase-treated dispersed intact and skinned smooth muscle cells and intact muscle tissues of the porcine coronary artery. ACh reduced stored 45Ca2+, and this action was prevented by procaine in intact dispersed cells. The maximum reduction in the level of stored 45Ca induced by caffeine (25 mM) or inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3; 3 microM) was also prevented by procaine in the skinned muscle cells in the presence or absence of ATP. However, inhibitions of the latter required higher concentrations of procaine than the former. Release by 10 microM ACh of Ca2+ from its store site in the presence or absence of extracellular Ca2+ was also inhibited by procaine and was detected using the quin2 fluorescence method. In these smooth muscle tissues, ACh (above 10 nM) reduced the amount of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PI-P2) and dose dependently increased the amount of phosphatidic acid. Procaine inhibited the hydrolysis of PI-P2 activated by ACh, thus reducing the amount of InsP3 and the release of Ca2+ from the store site. It is concluded that procaine has multiple actions on the porcine coronary artery, and one of the actions related with pharmacomechanical coupling appears through inhibition of hydrolysis of PI-P2 induced by ACh.\r"

This releases primitive peripheral reflex activities resulting in aberrant function of limbs and restricted motion in joints. The sensory cortex can equally be damaged and careful assessment of sensory appreciation in the stroke patient has to be made. The initial treatment of patients after a stroke consists of a variety of physiotherapy techniques, the rationale of which is to reduce the power of dominant aberrant reflex activities and build the strength in the antagonistic group of muscles. The potential for the efficacy of physiotherapy is somewhat restricted, but there is a place for appropriate bracing. A certain number of patients exist, however, for whom physiotherapy cannot achieve the desired results and for whom bracing is either ineffective or unacceptable. The only alternative for these patients is functional electrical stimulation or reducing the activity in the deforming muscles. This can either be done by direct inactivation of the motor nerve or by actually lengthening the muscle tendon unit to reduce the power of the muscle group. An alternative is to transfer tendons.\r"

The blood pressure fall was greater in the elderly even with chronic administration. Plasma angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition was similar in both groups. Steady-state serum enalaprilat concentrations were achieved more slowly in the elderly subjects and were correspondingly higher for all subjects. Clearance/bioavailability and volume of distribution/bioavailability diminished with repeated administration. Repeated exposure also led to a reduction in sensitivity of plasma angiotensin-converting enzyme to the inhibitor. Prolonged inhibition probably induces synthesis of new angiotensin-converting enzyme.\r"

Contrary to serum alpha 1-AT, faecal excretion and clearance of alpha 1-AT did not correlate with ESR, serum-albumin, orosomucoid, and two indices of disease activity. A comparison of alpha 1-AT faecal excretion and clearance with the faecal excretion of 111In labelled granulocytes in 27 patients with chronic inflammatory bowel diseases, showed no correlation between the intestinal protein loss and this highly specific marker of intestinal inflammation.

Drawbacks of the method are the application of radioactivity, the fact that children, pregnant women, and patients with renal insufficiency have to be excluded from the test, and the possible interference of drugs and isotopes. We propose simultaneous administration of p-aminosalicylic acid (PAS) in the PABA test and quantification of the urinary PABA and PAS excretion with liquid chromatography. Urinary PABA and PAS excretion in six hours are comparable (69.5 +/- 8.4% and 65.6 +/- 18.4% respectively in five healthy volunteers). Application of the PABA/PAS ratio was compared with the urinary PABA excretion in 21 normal controls, 38 patients with pancreatic disease, and 42 patients without pancreatic pathology. The PABA/PAS ratio and the per cent PABA excretion correlated very well in pancreatic patients: (PABA/PAS ratio) = 0.0149 (% PABA) + 0.052 (r = 0.902). Use of the PABA/PAS ratio enhanced the specificity of the test from 76 to 89%.\r"

  ".U": "87222926\r", 
  ".W": "ACTH has acute and long term effects on adrenal steroidogenesis by week 14 of fetal life. We used human fetal adrenal cells to investigate the long term effect of physiological doses of ACTH on mRNAs for P450scc (the cholesterol side-chain cleavage enzyme) and P450c17 (17 alpha-hydroxylase/17,20-lyase). Monolayer cultures of 18- to 24-week gestation fetal zone adrenal cells were maintained in the presence and absence of 10(-9) or 10(-8) M ACTH for up to 12 days. As assessed by RNA dot blots probed with cloned homologous human cDNAs, ACTH increased P450scc and P450c17 mRNAs 4- and 9-fold, respectively, over control values on day 7 of culture. ACTH-mediated stimulation was slightly less on day 12 of culture. The ACTH-mediated accumulation of those mRNAs were time dependent. When cells were exposed to a single 10(-8)-M dose of ACTH, the amount of P450scc and P450c17 mRNA was increased by 24 h, reaching a maximum at 48 h and diminishing by 72 h. When cells were maintained in 10(-8) M ACTH continuously, mRNA for both enzymes accumulated in a similar pattern, reaching a peak at 48 h but remaining at nearly maximal values thereafter, up to 96 h. Dibutyryl cAMP (10(-3) M) mimicked these stimulatory actions of ACTH, although its effect was greater at 24 h and more stable up to 96 h. Angiotensin II (1-100 ng/mL) and hCG (1-100 ng/mL) had no effect on accumulation of P450scc and P450c17 mRNAs. The production of both dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate and cortisol also was stimulated by ACTH, suggesting that the increased mRNAs were translated into active enzymes. These results indicate that ACTH induces human fetal adrenal cells to accumulate mRNAs for both P450scc and P450c17; this effect of ACTH is probably mediated by cAMP. Chronic 96-h stimulation of human fetal adrenal cells did not diminish their responsiveness to ACTH. Together with our earlier studies of the human fetal adrenal, these data indicate that fetal adrenal tissue does not exhibit the desensitization to trophic hormone stimulation characteristic of adult tissue.\r"

Basal and ovine CRH (oCRH)-stimulated plasma ACTH, cortisol, and adrenal androgen levels were measured 12 h (day on) and 36 h (day off) after the most recent dose of prednisone, and the results were compared to those in seven age- and sex-matched normal subjects. The patients' basal ACTH and cortisol levels did not differ significantly from those in the normal subjects on either the day on or the day off prednisone treatment. By contrast, their basal adrenal androgen levels were significantly decreased compared to those in normal subjects on both the day on and the day off prednisone (P less than 0.05). The patients' oCRH-stimulated ACTH and cortisol levels on the day off prednisone did not differ from normal levels, but were significantly blunted during the day on prednisone (P less than 0.05). In contrast, the patient's oCRH-stimulated adrenal androgen levels were significantly decreased during both the day off and the day on prednisone (P less than 0.05). These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that chronic alternate day prednisone therapy, at doses close to or below replacement, suppresses adrenal androgen levels without long term suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. Based upon these findings, we postulate that an alternate day regimen of prednisone might maintain the benefits while reducing the risks of glucocorticoid therapy of adrenal hyperandrogenism.\r"

  ".W": "Serum osteocalcin concentrations were measured in 42 patients with Paget's disease of bone and elevated serum alkaline phosphatase (AP) levels. High serum osteocalcin levels were found in only 22 patients. Serum osteocalcin was significantly correlated with urinary hydroxyproline excretion (r = 0.747; P less than 0.001) and, to a lesser extent, with serum AP levels (r = 0.483; P less than 0.01). In 23 patients who were followed during treatment with iv (3-amino-1-hydroxypropylidene) 1,1-bisphosphonate (APD) for 10 days, a dissociation among these 3 biochemical parameters was found. Urinary hydroxyproline excretion fell significantly (P less than 0.001), serum AP levels decreased, but not significantly, and serum osteocalcin concentrations increased progressively (P less than 0.001). This increase was greater when initial levels were lower than expected for the activity of the disease. The rise in serum osteocalcin correlated significantly with the concomitant increase in serum 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D concentrations. Three months after initiation of treatment, all 3 parameters, urinary OHP excretion, serum AP, and serum osteocalcin levels, were near or within the normal range. These results indicate that serum osteocalcin is not a clinically useful parameter for assessment of the activity of Paget's disease. Its basal concentrations lag behind those expected from the activity of the disease, suggesting defective osteocalcin production. It appears that the functions of osteocalcin and AP as well as their initial expression by the osteoblasts are different and that this difference may be important for the quality of bone formed in Paget's disease. APD can modulate the release of osteocalcin, possibly through stimulation of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D production, although other factors may be involved.\r"

GM-CSF has an established role as an in vitro regulator of granulocyte and macrophage colony formation. We have determined that rGM-CSF also has intrinsic activity as a megakaryocyte colony-stimulating factor and that rGM-CSF augments the effect of interleukin 3 (IL-3) on megakaryocyte colony formation. The dose-response curve for megakaryocyte colony induction with rGM-CSF showed plateau megakaryocyte stimulation at 9 ng/ml. When IL-3 (at a plateau dose for megakaryocyte colony induction) was added to rGM-CSF over a 0-22-ng/ml dose range, the resultant megakaryocyte colony stimulation approximated the sum of the levels of stimulation produced by either factor alone. These results establish GM-CSF as a multilineage growth factor with definite megakaryocyte colony-stimulating activity and indicate that both GM-CSF and IL-3 are important in the regulation of megakaryocytopoiesis.\r"

This study was undertaken to examine the ability of human sheep erythrocyte rosette forming lymphocytes (E-RFC) to form stable conjugates with microvascular endothelial cells (EC), and to assess whether a receptor-ligand interaction mediates this event. Human foreskin microvascular EC monolayers were used as targets of chromium-51-labeled E-RFC in a quantitative adherence assay. Binding was saturable, displaceable by unlabeled E-RFC, augmented by recombinant interleukin 1 (rIL-1) and inhibited by anti-LFA1 antibody. The Leu-11+ lymphocyte subset, known to be enriched for natural killer (NK) cells, bound preferentially. Only the EC-adherent lymphocyte fraction contained NK effectors, which lysed EC and classical NK targets. Thus, NK cells adhere to microvascular EC via a specific receptor-ligand interaction. The possibility exists that such binding occurs in recipients of vascularized allografts, representing the initial stage of graft rejection.\r"

Tachycardia was induced with one or two extrastimuli from both the right and the left atrium (by way of the coronary sinus). Preventive train stimulation, with the train delivered after the tachycardia-initiating stimulus, was attempted at the site of tachycardia induction as well as at the opposite site. Prevention at the site of tachycardia induction was successful in all patients when the length of the train (90 ms) exceeded the effective refractory period of the tachycardia-initiating stimulus to achieve single atrial capture within the \"preventive zone.\" However, in patients with a left-sided accessory pathway, preventive stimulation at the right atrium failed when tachycardia was induced from the coronary sinus because of interatrial conduction delay. It is concluded that train stimulation is an effective mode for supraventricular tachycardia prevention, yet the site of preventive stimulation should lie as close as possible to the anatomic site of the reentrant circuit to reduce interatrial conduction delay.\r"

This sensitivity is mediated by IgE antibody to ragweed antigens that in turn is presumed to be the product of B-lymphocytes regulated by various T cell subsets. Proliferation in vitro by lymphocytes obtained from individuals allergic to ragweed and cultured in the presence of ragweed antigen E (AgE) has been repeatedly described, but a comprehensive study of this proliferation has questioned the specificity of this response. We have examined this question and found that in the first week of culture, the specific lymphocyte proliferation to AgE may be obscured by high background and mitogen-like proliferation. However, by carrying the cells for a longer period of time in culture and providing a second in vitro boost with AgE, specific proliferation could be clearly documented. Lymphocytes from atopic ragweed-allergic donors proliferated at levels 20 to 50 times beyond background in the presence of AgE. Cells from nonragweed-allergic donors (either nonatopic or atopic) did not do so. The AgE-responsive cells could be expanded in culture and demonstrated to be T cells. Moreover, AgE-responsive T cells could only be cloned from AgE-allergic donors and, after expansion and subcloning, demonstrated to respond to AgE but not partially purified dust mite antigen. In contrast, a clone of T cells from a dust mite-sensitive individual proliferated in response to the dust mite antigen but not AgE.\r"

The present report demonstrates that this graft-vs-host-induced immune deficiency (GVHID) can be prevented in an antigen-specific way by immunization of the F1 mice with allogeneic cells before induction of GVHID. Thus, spleen cells from (A X B)F1 mice primed with allogeneic cells from strain C and then injected with parental spleen cells from A did not generate cytotoxic T lymphocyte responses to trinitophenyl-modified self cells or to allogeneic cells from third party strains D or E. However, spleen cells from the same mice generated normal levels of cytotoxic T lymphocyte activity to allogeneic cells from C, the strain used for immunization. Furthermore, mice exposed to murine cytomegalovirus before induction of GVHID were resistant to a subsequent challenge with murine cytomegalovirus, whereas GVHID mice that received only the murine cytomegalovirus challenge all died. These findings are discussed with respect to the possibilities that primed and unprimed T helper cells may be differentially susceptible to the suppressive effects of GVH.\r"

  ".W": "Murine as well as human lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) cells have been reported to have several characteristics of T lymphocytes and to be clearly distinct from natural killer (NK) cells. The present study of murine LAK cells showed that cytotoxic cells generated in the presence of interleukin 2 IL 2 were heterogeneous with respect to cell surface markers of progenitor as well as effector cells. Negative selection of cells with antibodies and complement or positive selection by fluorescence-activated cell sorting unequivocally showed that LAK effector cells consisted of at least two clearly distinct populations, the relative contribution of which was dependent on donor organ and target cells studied. Approximately 40% of the cytotoxic activity of spleen-derived effector cells active against the NK-resistant targets EL-4 or MCA-5 was eliminated by treatment with antibodies to the NK-markers asialo-GM1 and NK 1 (NK-LAK). Approximately 60% of cytotoxic activity was associated with cells expressing the T cell marker Lyt-2, lacked NK 1, and was lacking or expressed only small amounts asialo-GM1 (T-LAK). The NK-LAK cells were of greater importance for the cytotoxic activity against the standard NK target YAC-1, although T-LAK cells also excerted significant cytotoxicity against this cell line. Limiting dilution analysis estimated that the minimal frequency of precursors developing into cells with cytotoxic activity against EL-4 was 1/6700 in spleen and 1/4200 in peripheral blood. The frequency of cells developing into cytotoxic effectors against YAC-1 cells was 1/3700 and 1/1450 in spleen and peripheral blood, respectively. Depletion of progenitor cells from spleen or peripheral blood expressing NK 1 or Lyt-2 by treating the cells with antibodies to these structures and complement indicated that NK-1-expressing cells were the dominating progenitor of the LAK cells irrespective of target cells used. Culture of murine lymphoid cells from spleen or peripheral blood with high concentrations of IL 2 results in the emergence of two different killer cell populations with phenotypic similarities to NK and T cells, respectively, both being able to kill targets resistant to resting NK cells. In contrast to numerous earlier reports, we concluded that LAK cells are heterogeneous with respect to surface markers, with a major population of LAK cells apparently representing IL 2-activated cells expressing cell surface markers associated with NK cells.\r"

Tolerance induction at the level of T cell help results from exposure of the AB.7.D7 cells to 10 micrograms monomeric HGG. The monokine IL 1 was found to interfere with tolerance induction in AB.7.D7 cells in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, interference with tolerance induction was dependent upon the T cells being presented with IL 1 at the same time as monomeric HGG, the tolerogen. IL 1 and monomeric HGG could not be demonstrated to interact to make nontolerogenic soluble aggregates, however. It was found that monomeric HGG was unable to stimulate the production of either membrane or secreted IL 1 by splenic macrophages and in addition was not degraded by peritoneal exudate cells. Heat-aggregated HGG, which is highly antigenic and nontolerogenic, is a good stimulus for IL 1 production and is processed by macrophages into peptides of varying sizes. These data are consistent with the suggestion that a tolerogenic signal results from T cell recognition of a nondegraded antigen in the absence of a signal from IL 1. It is possible, however, that small amounts of processed antigen, undetectable by us, are involved.\r"

Nuclear disintegration has been reported for mouse lymphoid target cells by several groups. However, previous studies in which human target cells were studied saw little or no DNA solubilization. We here report rapid, extensive CTL-induced solubilization of DNA in human lymphoid target cells; on the other hand, we found that three mouse cell lines exhibit little or no nuclear disintegration. We conclude that the degree of nuclear disintegration depends on the nature of the target cell, but is not determined by the species of origin of the target cell.\r"

  ".W": "We have directly compared the signals required for: induction of the [Ca+2]i response, expression of Tac antigen, and proliferation in antigen-specific human T cell clones. We have previously shown that antigen-specific activation of cloned T cells under conditions leading to proliferation is accompanied by a rapid increase in [Ca+2]i. Cloned T cells showed increased [Ca+2]i, enhanced Tac expression, and proliferated in response to specific antigen in the presence of viable, genetically appropriate antigen-presenting cells. Paraformaldehyde fixation of antigen-presenting cells after \"pulsing\" with antigen prevented proliferation, but did not affect MHC-restricted [Ca+2]i or Tac responses. Treatment of cloned T cells with monoclonal anti-T3 antibody also increased [Ca+2]i and Tac expression but did not induce proliferation. Proliferation was restored by viable autologous or allogenic APC or exogenous IL 2, but not by IL 1. In contrast to resting T cells, T cell clones were insensitive to the mitogenic effects of lectins or of ionophores and phorbol esters. These results suggest that activation of antigen-specific T cells requires the sequential action of at least two signals. The first is MHC restricted and is mediated by interaction of antigen + MHC class II products with the T cell receptor (T3-Ti) complex. This leads to Tac expression and increased [Ca+2]i, but is not sufficient for proliferation. This signal can be bypassed by anti-T3 monoclonal antibodies. Proliferation requires a second, nonantigen-specific, non-MHC-restricted antigen-presenting cell signal, which cannot be replaced by IL 1 in our system. This signal can be bypassed, however, by the addition of exogenous IL 2 to cells that have received the first signal and express Tac, suggesting that it is required for IL 2 synthesis and secretion. T cell clones therefore provide a useful model for studying antigen-dependent and -independent events in cell activation.\r"

A decrease in the percentage of resting (Leu-8 positive) B cells was also seen in AIDS patients and HIV-seropositive individuals. An increased percentage of circulating, immature (CALLA-positive, CD10) B cells was seen in AIDS patients. These phenotypic changes were accompanied by an increased level of spontaneous IgG and IgM secretion, and increased cell size within the total B cell population and in some B cell subpopulations, in patients with AIDS and in HIV-seropositive people.

  ".W": "Sera collected in New York in 1984 from 77 patients with homozygous beta-thalassemia were assayed for antibodies to HTLV-III by ELISA and Western blot techniques. Eight (12%) of the 66 hypertransfused thalassemics were seropositive. Retrospective sera of these eight individuals were examined by radioimmune precipitation (RIP), and assays for neutralization of virus infectivity were performed. With seroconversion, antibodies to viral envelope proteins appeared first and were correlated with development of neutralizing antibody. Affinity purified gp120, the major envelope glycoprotein of HTLV-III, blocked viral infectivity and absorbed neutralizing antibody activity from a positive serum. Neutralizing antibody titers mirrored antibody titers to gp120 by RIP. Antibody to gp120 sometimes occurred in the absence of neutralizing antibody, although the reverse was not true. One thalassemia patient who exhibited antibody to gp120 for 3 yr post-seroconversion failed to develop neutralizing antibody, acquired the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome with central nervous system involvement and lymphoma, and subsequently died. In contrast, all other seropositive thalassemics possessed neutralizing antibodies, and were asymptomatic or exhibited only lymphadenopathy. These results indicate that gp120 elicits neutralizing antibodies in the course of natural infection with HTLV-III. The relationship seen here between neutralizing antibody and better clinical outcome needs to be verified by additional studies.\r"

To determine the role of complement in these ATS-induced glomerular lesions, ATS was given to Lewis rats that had been depleted of C3 by cobra venom factor (CVF). CVF treatment prevented the degenerative changes in mesangial cells and accumulation of even the few polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) seen in the glomeruli (2.67 PMN/glomerulus) 1 hr after ATS-treatment in rats not given CVF. In addition, CVF prevented the mesangiolysis and mesangial hypercellularity seen at day 4. Rat C3 and late complement components identified in the mesangial of ATS-treated rats in close association with the deposition of rabbit immunoglobulin G was also absent as a result of CVF treatment. CVF treatment did not affect binding of ATS to glomeruli as studied by immunofluorescence or paired label radioisotope techniques. The depletion of leukocytes and/or PMN by irradiation or treatment with anti-I-MN serum had no effect on the induction of the acute mesangial cell damage or the mesangiolytic lesion. Irradiation did diminish the 4-day proliferative/infiltrative lesion. Complement depletion normalized the ATS-induced increase in mesangial uptake of heat-aggregated human gamma-globulin (655.0 +/- 35.2 micrograms in ATS-treated vs 20.3 +/- 2.9 micrograms/5 X 10(4) glomeruli in ATS plus CVF-treated rats; mean +/- SEM). Small immune deposits present in the mesangial areas of kidneys 4 to 5 days after CVF treatment represented CVF-anti-CVF antibody-C3 complexes. The model of mesangial cell damage induced by ATS in the rat is complement-dependent and may relate, at least in part, to complement-mediated mesangial cell lysis.\r"

  ".U": "87224017\r", 
  ".W": "Following intracerebral inoculation of Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV), susceptible mouse strains develop a chronic demyelinating disease characterized by mononuclear cell-rich infiltrates in the central nervous system. Current evidence strongly supports an immune-mediated basis for myelin breakdown, with an effector role proposed for TMEV-specific, major histocompatibility class II-restricted delayed-type hypersensitivity, which temporally correlates with disease onset and remains chronically elevated in susceptible mice. This study examined the fine specificity of class II-restricted T cell responses in TMEV-infected mice to better define the relevant virus-encoded T cell determinant(s) responsible for triggering the demyelinating process, and to determine if class II-restricted neuroantigen-specific autoimmune responses could be detected in mice with TMEV-induced demyelination. The data clearly show that T cell responses in TMEV-infected mice are directed against determinants shared by closely related TMEV strains and are cross-reactive with related picornaviruses, such as encephalomyocarditis virus. In contrast, class II-restricted autoimmune responses against syngeneic mouse spinal cord homogenate and the two major protein components of myelin, myelin basic protein and proteolipid protein, are not demonstrable in susceptible SJL/J mice undergoing chronic TMEV-induced demyelinating disease, but are readily seen in SJL/J mice displaying chronic, relapsing experimental allergic encephalomyelitis. Cross-reactivity (or lack thereof), as determined by functional T cell analyses, was found to correlate with the extent of exact amino acid homology between the TMEV capsid proteins, the two neuroantigens, and related picornaviruses. The data thus do not support a major role for autoimmune responses against myelin proteins in TMEV-induced demyelinating disease, but are consistent with our previously proposed hypothesis that TMEV-specific T cell responses constitute a major effector mechanism of myelin breakdown.\r"

Production of high titers of IgG rheumatoid factors (RF) may be related to the formation of extremely large amounts of cryoglobulins and the development of tissue lesions such as necrotizing polyarteritis, arthritis, and glomerulonephritis. To analyze more directly the relationship of IgG RF to the development of cryoglobulins and tissue injuries, we have established four monoclonal IgG RF secreting hybridomas from unimmunized MRL-lpr/lpr mice and determined their pathogenic effects in normal strains of mice. All the monoclonal IgG RF obtained in this study were of the IgG3 subclass and generated cryoglobulins. However, the fact that not only IgG3 Rf monoclonals but also four of five non-RF IgG3 monoclonals were able to form cryoglobulins, which were composed exclusively of each IgG3 monoclonal, indicates that the IgG3 molecule has a unique physicochemical property to self-associate via nonimmunological interaction and the ability to form cryoglobulins. When the in vivo pathogenic activities of these IgG3 RF and non-RF monoclonals were examined, three of IgG3 RF monoclonals with the specificity to IgG2a were able to induce extensive pathologic manifestations including peripheral vasculitis and glomerulonephritis characteristic of patients with cryoglobulinemia. Our results indicate that the IgG3 itself, independently of its specificity, could be a potential source of cryoglobulins and IgG3 RF, combined with its activity of cryoglobulin formation, may play a significant role in the development of glomerulonephritis and cutaneous vascular lesions of ears and foot pads observed frequently in aged MRL-lpr/lpr mice.\r"

Stimulation of these quiescent cells with bacterial lipopolysaccharide induced the re-expression of intracellular, membrane, and extracellular IL 1 activities as well as IL 1 alpha and IL 1 beta mRNA. We found no qualitative difference in the degree or rate of induction of IL 1 alpha compared with IL 1 beta mRNA. These results indicate that resting macrophages are IL 1 negative, and that the IL 1 inducing stimuli used in this study act transiently to increase the levels of IL 1 alpha and IL 1 beta mRNA.\r"

Furthermore, PAM that were allowed to express mIL 1 before UV-B irradiation had a faster decay of mIL 1 activity than unirradiated cells. These data suggested that mIL 1 expression is inhibited by UV-B irradiation, and that under normal circumstances, mIL 1 synthesis and degradation is at a steady state, with the half-life of mIL 1 activity being 24 hr when assayed in an IL 1-dependent cell line proliferation assay. These data indicate that secreted forms of IL 1 and mIL 1 are differentially regulated and that the therapeutic effects of UV irradiation may be due to its inhibition of mIL 1 activity.\r"

However, the kinetics of IL 2 release during the first 8 hr of culture are highly temperature-dependent. The rate of IL 2 release increases linearly with temperature over the range from 33 degrees to 41 degrees C, demonstrating temperature coefficients (Q10) greater than 70. In contrast, IL 2-promoted proliferation of a continuous T cell line is much less temperature-dependent with Q10 values of less than 4.0.\r"

However, the soluble factors mediating these PG-stimulatory effects are incompletely understood. We characterized the effects on PG production by confluent normal lung fibroblasts of recombinant interleukin 1 alpha (IL 1 alpha), interleukin 1 beta (IL 1 beta) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF), alone and in combination. All three cytokines stimulated fibroblast PG production with both IL 1 peptides being significantly more potent than TNF. In addition, TNF interacted in a synergistic fashion with both IL 1 peptides to augment fibroblast PGE elaboration further. The stimulatory effects of the cytokines were almost entirely caused by an increase in PGE2 production and were reversed when the cytokine(s) were removed. These changes in PG production could not be explained by alterations in cell number and were completely negated by specific anticytokine antibodies. Recombinant gamma interferon, although synergizing with TNF in regulating other cellular functions, did not interact with TNF to augment fibroblast PGE elaboration. In addition, the synergistic interaction of IL 1 and TNF did not extend to all biologic effects of IL 1 since TNF did not augment the ability of IL 1 to stimulate thymocyte proliferation.\r"

In this report, we demonstrate that membrane-associated C1q, which contains the A, B, and C chains of C1q, is structurally distinct from fluid-phase C1q in that the B chain of the membrane species is approximately 1000 m.w. less than its fluid-phase counterpart. By using biosynthetically ([3H]proline) labeled C1q from guinea pig peritoneal macrophages, we found that the membrane form of C1q is derived from already secreted C1q. The demonstration of a distinct membrane form of C1q supports earlier functional studies which implicated C1q as a membrane-associated molecule with receptor functions for those molecules which also interact with fluid-phase C1q, such as polyanions, immune complexes, and bacteria. Furthermore, we show that, in the vicinity of macrophages, C1q is very susceptible to oxidation manifested by the formation of disulfide bonds. By SDS-PAGE (nonreduced and reduced), we demonstrate the existence of disulfide-linked multimers (180,000 m.w., 360,000 m.w.) which are composed of the A, B, and C chains of C1q.\r"

This study focuses on one of these anti-idiotopes, designated B24-44, which binds to a site near the T15 paratope. Another anti-idiotope, B36-82, recognizes an idiotope that is distant from the paratope. Two PC-binding immunoglobulins, 7-22 and 140.7C6, that differ from T15 by one to three amino acids have selectively lost their reactivity with the anti-idiotope, B36-82. However, the B36-82 binding was restored when B24-44 was first allowed to react with these immunoglobulins. The binding of B24-44 as well as the restoration of the B36-82 site was specifically inhibited by PC-protein conjugates. Competition experiments suggested that the newly induced B36-82 determinant is in the same location as the B36-82 binding site on T15. These data indicate that the binding of anti-idiotopic determinants to an immunoglobulin can alter the protein structure and create new determinants.\r"

These reactions have recently been demonstrated in mature resting B cells stimulated with anti-IgM, as well. In addition to Ins(1,4,5)P3, inositol tetrakisphosphate (InsP4) and inositol 1,3,4-trisphosphate (Ins(1,3,4)P3) were rapidly generated in WEHI-231 cells upon stimulation of the antigen receptor with anti-IgM. These two inositol polyphosphates are probably generated from Ins(1,4,5)P3 by phosphorylation to yield InsP4 and removal of the 5-phosphate from InsP4 to yield Ins(1,3,4)P3. It is possible that these inositol polyphosphates play a second messenger role in mediating the biologic effects of antigen-receptor signaling. It had previously been shown that anti-IgM also causes an increase in cytoplasmic free calcium. Therefore, the relationship between Ca2+ elevation and phosphoinositide breakdown was investigated. Although elevation of cytoplasmic Ca2+ with ionophores can trigger phosphoinositide breakdown, this required levels of Ca2+ well beyond those normally seen in response to anti-IgM. Thus, the Ca2+ elevation seen in response to anti-IgM cannot be the event controlling phosphoinositide breakdown. WEHI-231 cells have been shown to have a calcium storage compartment that releases Ca2+ in the presence of Ins(1,4,5)P3; therefore, it is likely that anti-IgM stimulates phosphoinositide breakdown as a primary event and this leads to the elevation of cytoplasmic Ca2+.\r"

We found that the E19 protein-induced reduction of the HLA-B7 cell surface expression led to a greatly reduced lysis of the infected cells.

We have studied the regulation of the human proIL-1 beta gene in THP-1 human monocytic leukemia cells. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induction of this gene results in an immediate and transient increase of message that rapidly falls to a low, but constant, level within 6 hr. This decrease results from a specific repression of transcription by 2 hr after stimulation. Cycloheximide inhibition of new protein synthesis causes a superinduction of IL 1 message, but does not alter the initial kinetics of message production. This presumably delays the synthesis of a labile transcriptional repressor protein and implies that the proIL-1 beta gene is under the control of both a transcriptional activator and a newly synthesized transcriptional repressor. The transient increase in mRNA production and the sustained low-level synthesis beyond the initial transient response suggest that the IL 1 protein itself may act intracellularly in a manner analogous to that described for several proto-oncogenes and cellular competence factors.\r"

Experiments were conducted to compare the effect of induction on killing by activated natural killer (NK) cells, cytotoxic T lymphocytes, activated macrophages, and antibody plus complement. The only effector that recognized increased ras expression and exhibited high-inducible cytolysis was an activated NK cell. The effectors from spleen were poly I.C. boostable, Lyt-1.1 negative, NK 1.2 positive, and asialo GM1 positive. Spleen cells from T cell-deficient nude mice, but not NK-deficient beige mice, exhibited high levels of killing activity, and experiments with NK cell clones demonstrated that these lines were also highly cytolytic and killed Ha-ras transfectants in parallel to YAC. Transfection of the same fibroblast line with c-myc did not alter the level of activated NK sensitivity. Cold target competition experiments revealed that Ha-ras-transfected and non-transfected 10T1/2 fibroblasts competed equally for lysis of either YAC or Ha-ras transfectants. Rat-1 fibroblasts did not compete, but gained this capacity when transformed with the v-Ki-ras oncogene but not v-fps. These data suggest that Ha-ras acts in target cells at a post-binding step, whereas Ki-ras may affect expression of target-effector binding structures. The findings that activated NK cell lysis may be specifically influenced by ras expression support a role for NK cells in host surveillance against early neoplastic changes.\r"

  ".W": "We and other investigators previously reported the cloning of CTLA-1 (or CCP-1) and CTLA-3 (or H Factor) serine esterase-related transcripts preferentially expressed in cytolytic T lymphocytes. We extended the survey of the tissue specificity of these molecules. Two main sets of results were obtained. First, both CTLA-1 and CTLA-3 transcripts could be found in the various cytolytic T cells tested, although in widely different amounts, and in some cases just at the threshold of detection. Secondly, these transcripts were not found in most of the other cells tested, including in some natural cytotoxic cells and in activated cytotoxic macrophages; however, they could be detected in mast cells for CTLA-1 and in some noncytotoxic lymphocytes for CTLA-3. Thus, the CTLA-1 and CTLA-3 serine esterase products are most probably not required for macrophage or natural cytotoxicity; their presence cannot be taken as characteristic of cytotoxic T cells; and a discussion about their relevance to T cell-mediated cytotoxicity should take into account their widely different amounts from one cytotoxic T cell to another.\r"

  ".W": "Cross-linking of cell surface Ly-6C molecules with the 6C3 rat monoclonal antibody (MAb) followed by anti-rat immunoglobulin antibody acts in concert with phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) as a potent mitogenic stimulus for normal T cells. Specificity of this stimulation was demonstrated by its absence in T cells from NZB, NOD, or STb/J mice which lack the 6C3 determinant. In 6C3+ normal strains, the extent of 6C3-mediated stimulation varied, depending on the level of 6C3 antigen expression. Analysis of this stimulation in purified T cell subsets revealed that in Ly-6.1 strains (e.g., BALB/c, CBA/J), Lyt-2+ cells responded, but not L3T4+ cells, whereas in Ly-6.2 strains (e.g., C57BL/6, MRL-+/+), both subsets produced IL 2 and proliferated, although with different kinetics. Moreover, in adult MRL-+/+ mice, the minor Lyt-2-/L3T4- subset from the lymph nodes gave low responses to 6C3 cross-linking, whereas that from the thymus reacted strongly. Stimulation via Ly-6C therefore provides a pathway for differential activation of normal T cells. In contrast, the expanding population of Lyt-2-/L3T4- T cells from lpr/lpr or gld/gld mice did not proliferate in response to 6C3 antigen cross-linking plus PMA despite high levels of 6C3 antigen expression. Responsiveness of lpr/lpr T cells could not be restored with IL 1, IL 2, or both. These T cells also failed to be triggered by conjunction of PMA with either Thy-1 antigen cross-linking or concanavalin A. Moreover, they were not stimulated, in the presence of PMA, by doses of ionomycin that were optimal for normal T cells, but did respond to higher ionomycin concentrations (2 micrograms/ml), and this response was not altered by Ly-6C cross-linking. It is concluded that the Ly-6C pathway of T cell activation is not functional in the aberrant lpr/lpr (and gld/gld) T cells, and that this defect may reflect abnormalities of intracellular signaling.\r"

Previous evidence has suggested that Tp44 may function as a receptor for accessory signals in T cell activation. High level Tp44 expression was observed on plasmacytomas grown in cell culture and on plasma cells from bone marrow biopsies of multiple myeloma patients. This antigen is not present on resting B cells from either peripheral blood or lymphoid organs, or on any other B cell tumor. The growth kinetics and Ig production in plasmacytomas are not affected by the binding of antibody 9.3. Moreover, the Tp44 molecule is co-expressed with PCA-1, an antigen characteristic of plasma cells, on peripheral blood B cells stimulated in vitro to differentiate toward plasma cells. Tp44 may represent a later stage of B cell differentiation than PCA-1 because unlike the PCA-1 antigen, this molecule could not be detected on any EBV-transformed cell line or Burkitt's lymphoma lines. The m.w. of the Tp44 molecule expressed on plasma cells and on T cells is identical, as determined by immunoprecipitation of radioiodinated cell surface proteins with monoclonal antibody 9.3. This antigen might be useful in studying the mechanism of growth and differentiation of human B cells, the heterogeneity within plasma cell populations, and B cell interactions with other components of the immune system.\r"

B cell responses to both type 1 and type 2 TI antigens were found to be strictly A cell dependent. Only A cells capable of IL 1 secretion could restore responsiveness in A cell-depleted spleen cells, regardless of Ia expression or antigen-processing capability. Moreover, recombinant IL 1 completely replaced A cell function in B cell responses to both TI 1 and TI 2 antigens. Finally, T cell depletion did not diminish the reconstitution by IL 1. Thus in contrast to T cell activation, IL 1 secretion is the only A cell function required in TI B cell activation, and the data are consistent with a direct role for IL 1 in B cell activation.\r"

In the present study we have compared the idiotypic specificities of a panel of 39 mouse monoclonal anti-idiotype (anti-Id) antibodies developed against 16 monoclonal human immunoglobulins (Ig). The Id cross-reactivities of these antibodies with Ig products of normal and abnormal B cells were examined by immunofluorescence and immunochemical methods. The reactivity patterns of these anti-Id antibodies with a normal population of plasma cells were highly variable in the immunofluorescence assay. Six were reactive with 2 to 10% of normal plasma cells, 30 with 0.1 to 2% of plasma cells, and three with less than 0.1% of plasma cells from blood, bone marrow, spleen, or tonsils. These reactivity patterns were relatively consistent among samples from 23 Caucasian, black, and Oriental adults. Although the reactivities of most anti-Id antibodies in the panel were not restricted to a particular Ig isotype, several were preferentially reactive with a particular heavy or light chain isotype: one IgM-, two IgA-, two kappa-, and three lambda-restricted antibodies. The immunofluorescence data was confirmed by biosynthetic analysis of Id+ molecules produced by a normal plasma cell population. When the reactivity of this panel of anti-Id antibodies with nonhomologous B cell neoplasms was examined, seven of 30 myelomas or leukemia-derived products and one of nine B cell leukemias or lymphomas without paraproteins were found to be cross-reactive with one or two of the anti-Id antibodies. Although clearly significant, the cross-reactivity between the Id of these paraproteins appeared to be of lower affinity than the reactivity of the homologous Id with their respective anti-Id antibodies. The results reveal a remarkable diversity in the specificities of monoclonal antibodies classified by conventional criteria as anti-Id antibodies, and indicate the potential usefulness of a panel of antibodies for analyzing clonal diversity in normal and abnormal B cell development.\r"

All of these autoantibodies were of the IgM class and reacted with antigens in multiple organs. In this study we generated IgG murine monoclonal anti-idiotypic antibodies against five human monoclonal autoantibodies, (i.e., MOR-h2, MOR-h3, MOR-h4, CG1, and CG2). These anti-idiotypic antibodies reacted strongly with the corresponding human monoclonal autoantibody, but minimally or not at all with other human monoclonal autoantibodies. By using these anti-idiotypic antibodies as probes, we screened sera obtained from normal individuals and patients with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, Hashimoto's thyroiditis, and systemic lupus erythematosus for the expression of idiotopes. Our study showed that the idiotopes recognized by three of the anti-idiotypic antibodies, i.e., anti-CG1, anti-CG2, and anti-MOR-h2, were not expressed, but the idiotopes recognized by two of the anti-idiotypic antibodies, i.e., anti-MOR-h3 and anti-MOR-h4, were expressed in normal individuals. In patients with autoimmune disorders, there was no increase in the expression of the CG1, CG2, and MOR-h2 idiotopes, but 45 and 23% of the patients with systemic lupus erythematosus showed a significant increase in the expression of the MOR-h3 and MOR-h4 idiotopes respectively. These findings show that there is widespread expression in the B cell repertoire of certain autoantibody-associated idiotopes.\r"

A maintenance dose of anti-IgM antibodies (600 micrograms/wk), which efficiently induced B cell depletion in various non-autoimmune strains of mice, was not sufficient to deplete B cells from autoimmune-prone (NZW x BXSB)F1 mice. (NZW x BXSB)F1 mice required approximately twice as many anti-IgM antibodies (1200 micrograms/wk) to maintain the suppression of B cell development. Continuous treatment with the sub-suppressive dose of anti-IgM antibodies led to a marked acceleration of autoimmune disease in (NZW x BXSB)F1 mice. In contrast, elimination of B cells in (NZW x BXSB)F1 mice with a higher dose of anti-IgM antibodies (1200 micrograms/wk) completely prevented autoantibody production, immune complex formation, and development of glomerulonephritis and vascular lesions associated with mononuclear cell infiltrations. Our results are a direct demonstration of the primary role of autoantibodies for the development of various tissue lesions seen in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and indicates that autoreactive effector T cells, if they exist, play no major direct role in the pathogenesis of SLE, at least in (NZW x BXSB)F1 hybrid mice.\r"

  ".W": "This investigation focused on the role of adherent accessory cells and their cellular product, interleukin 1 (IL 1), in cellular immune responses associated with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) in Lewis rats. Guinea pig myelin basic protein (GPMBP)-sensitized lymph node cells (LNC) responded in culture with GPMBP by undergoing activation as measured by augmented transfer of EAE to syngeneic recipients, and proliferation as measured by [3H]thymidine incorporation. GPMBP-sensitized LNC, after depletion of adherent accessory cells, no longer responded to GPMBP in the EAE transfer activation assay. In contrast, aliquots of the same LNC preparation exhibited proliferative responses to GPMBP that were only partially reduced. Addition of irradiated thymocytes to adherent cell-depleted cultures fully reconstituted responsiveness to GPMBP in the activation assay and restored full reactivity to GPMBP in the proliferation assay. Furthermore, addition of either purified human IL 1 or recombinant human IL 1 to adherent cell-depleted cultures reconstituted reactivity to GPMBP in the EAE transfer activation assay and augmented GPMBP-specific proliferative responses. Anti-Ia monoclonal antibodies blocked GPMBP + IL 1-induced cellular activation of nonadherent LNC. These results demonstrate that both IL 1 and Ia molecules are important in the pathway leading to GPMBP-induced activation of EAE-inducing T lymphocytes. Furthermore, these results suggest that different accessory signals may be required for optimal induction of GPMBP-induced lymphocyte activation vs GPMBP-specific proliferative responses.\r"

  ".W": "Monoclonal antibodies (McAb) were developed to the Mr 17,500 form of human recombinant interleukin 1, IL 1 beta. Four McAb have been identified that inhibit the biological activity of IL 1 beta. McAb H34 and H67, at 1 microgram/ml (6 X 10(-9) M), completely inhibit the capacity of 1 ng/ml (6 X 10(-11) M) recombinant IL 1 beta to stimulate the proliferation of murine thymocytes or human fibroblasts in vitro. McAb H6 and H21 are approximately 10-fold less potent, and completely inhibit IL 1 beta activity at 10 micrograms/ml (6 X 10(-8) M) in both assays. The McAb do not have a significant effect on the biological activity of human recombinant IL 1 alpha in either assay. These McAb block the binding of recombinant [125I]IL 1 beta to IL 1 receptors on mouse 3T3 fibroblasts and have affinity constants for IL 1 beta in the range of 10(9) to 10(10) liters/mol. Competition studies suggest that two nonoverlapping epitopes on the IL 1 beta molecule are recognized by the McAb. H6 and H34 recognize one epitope, and H21 and H67 another. McAb H6 and H67 have been used together in a two-site ELISA to detect IL 1 beta. The sensitivity of the ELISA, which is 15 pg/ml (0.86 pM), approaches the limit of sensitivity of the thymocyte proliferation assay. The ELISA and thymocyte proliferation assay were used to quantitate IL 1 beta in E. coli LPS-stimulated human monocyte culture supernatants (HMCS). The level of IL 1 beta detected by ELISA in culture supernatants from eight donors ranged from 1.7 to 5.6 ng/ml, with a mean value of approximately 3 ng/ml. By comparison, the thymocyte proliferation assay gave levels of IL 1 in HMCS that were eight fold higher when quantitated by using recombinant IL 1 beta as a standard. This discrepancy with the bioassay used was reflected by the three fold higher maximum stimulation of thymocyte proliferation by HMCS as compared with recombinant IL 1 alpha or IL 1 beta, and only 45% inhibition of HMCS IL 1 activity by McAb. Thus, factors other than IL 1 beta account for the IL 1-like activity in monocyte culture supernatant as measured by the bioassay. The ILB1 McAb and ELISA allow for the first time-sensitive, accurate, and convenient quantitation of IL 1 beta levels in biological fluids or specimens.\r"

  ".W": "The expression of interleukin 1 receptors (IL 1R) on human peripheral T cells was studied by the binding assay with 125I-labeled recombinant human interleukin 1 (IL 1) alpha and IL 1 beta and by the flow cytofluorometry with the fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated IL 1 alpha. Peripheral blood lymphocytes expressed only few IL 1R without any stimulations. When they were stimulated with concanavalin A (Con A), IL 1R-positive cells began to increase by 4 hr, reached the maximum level at 48 hr, and then gradually decreased. The kinetics of the expression of IL 1 alpha R and IL 1 beta R showed the same pattern. Furthermore the binding of 125I-labeled IL 1 alpha to IL 1R on T cells was inhibited by the addition of either cold IL 1 alpha or IL beta, but not by interleukin 2 or interferons. The similar results were observed in the binding of 125I-labeled IL 1 beta. These results suggest that IL 1R on human peripheral T cells reactive for IL 1 alpha and IL 1 beta were identical. By Scatchard plot analysis, the numbers of IL 1R were estimated as 40 and 350 molecules per cell before and after Con A stimulation, respectively, and their Kd values were 3.1 X 10(-10) M and 2.8 X 10(-10) M. When purified T cells alone were stimulated with Con A, IL 1R were only marginally expressed. However, by the addition of monocytes, IL 1R were expressed on T cells in a dose-dependent manner. The maximum response was induced in the presence of 10% monocytes. The maximum IL 1R-positive T cells were approximately 30% by the detection of the flow cytofluorometry with FITC-conjugated IL 1 alpha. This enhancing activity of IL 1R expression on T cells by monocytes was inhibited by the addition of an anti-HLA-DR antibody or by the treatment of monocytes with the anti-HLA-DR antibody and complement. Furthermore T cell proliferative responses induced with IL 1 and Con A were also enhanced by the addition of HLA-DR-positive monocytes. These results suggest that IL 1R are expressed as the result of monocyte-T cell interaction in the early stage of T cell activation, and the expression of IL 1R on T cells and the responsiveness of T cells for IL 1 require the accessory function of HLA-DR-positive monocytes.\r"

Resting, unactivated monocytes did not display IL 1 activity. Maximum induction of membrane IL 1 was obtained from monocytes treated with polyclonal activators, such as LPS or Staphylococcus aureus, whereas adherence was a weak inducer of membrane IL 1. Isolated cell compartments as plasma membranes, crude lysosomes, and crude cytosol from activated human monocytes expressed significant IL 1 activity, whereas the endoplasmic reticulum showed no IL 1 activity. Exposure to trypsin of either fixed, activated human monocytes or cell compartments from unfixed monocytes, revealed biologically active IL 1 in the membrane, crude lysosome, and crude cytosol, but not in the endoplasmic reticulum. The IL 1 activity in the purified cytosol, prepared by extraction with digitonin, was considerably increased by the trypsin treatment, whereas the increase in IL 1 activity within crude lysosomes and plasma membranes was less. The cell compartments from nonactivated monocytes did not express active IL 1 and trypsin treatment revealed no active IL 1, suggesting the absence of a pool of the trypsin-sensitive form of IL 1. The data confirm the presence of membrane-bound IL 1 in activated human monocytes and indicate that an inactive precursor molecule can be found in the cytosol of such cells. Furthermore, the absence of IL 1 activity either in its active form or as the inactive precursor in the endoplasmic reticulum suggests that IL 1 is not a conventionally secreted protein. Because IL 1 was found in the cytosol as a precursor and in the lysosomal fractions in an active form, these data suggest that after the synthesis and processing of the cytosolic precursor, the 17-kda IL 1, is released via lysosomal vesicles.\r"

  ".W": "We determined the activity of IL 1, obtained from various human monocyte subcellular compartments, when associated with liposomes. Soluble IL 1, bound to the outer surface of lyophilized liposomes, stimulated responsive target cells. However, this activity was not preserved when soluble IL 1 was incorporated into the inner chambers of classical liposomes. In contrast, monocyte plasma membranes that exhibited IL 1 activity had the same level of activity when presented on lyophilized liposomes and when incorporated inside the classical liposomes. However, monocyte plasma membranes bound to the outer surface of the liposomes exhibited greater activity than the monocyte membrane IL 1 itself in its soluble form. This suggests that membrane IL 1 is an integral membrane protein, readily integrated into the lipid bilayers. Like soluble IL 1, the expression of IL 1 activity present in the cytosol of activated monocytes was decreased by incorporation into liposomes, but was high and active when presented on lyophilized liposomes. The best artificial cell reconstitution was obtained with lyophilized liposomes in association with monocyte cytosol and plasma membranes. When an unactivated monocyte compartment was mixed with one from an activated monocyte, the signal was equal to that of the activated cell compartment alone. The IL 1 activity of activated cell fractions associated with lyophilized liposomes was determined, and an increase of IL 1 activity for both plasma membranes and cytosol was observed, whereas a decrease of the signal was obtained for the lysosomal compartment. Endoplasmic reticulum showed no IL 1 activity, even after trypsin treatment. The highest activity after trypsin treatment was recovered in the cytosol associated with lyophilized liposomes, suggesting that molecules obtained after this treatment were able to bind tightly to the lipid bilayers.\r"

  ".W": "The production of IL 1 by LPS-stimulated peritoneal macrophages from inbred mouse strains was studied. Macrophages from A/J (A) mice were deficient in IL 1 production, when compared with high IL 1-producing strains, including C57BL/6J (B). The difference between A and B macrophages was maintained over a wide LPS concentration range and throughout a 72-hr incubation period. Because of these differences, it was possible to investigate the mechanisms regulating IL 1 production by applying techniques of genetic analysis by using recombinant inbred (RI) strains derived from the A and B progenitors. A strain distribution pattern (SDP) of IL 1 production (low/high response) was obtained with the use of 15 AXB/BXA RI strains. This suggested the presence of a major gene locus controlling the production of IL 1 in response to LPS stimulation, with allelic differences presumably resulting in deficient or efficient IL 1 production. In addition, there appeared to be one or more other loci involved in determining the magnitude of the IL 1 response to LPS in the responder mice. The IL 1 response did not appear to be linked to the major histocompatibility complex, since B10.A mice (which share the same H-2a haplotype as A/J) were efficient IL 1 producers. There did not appear to be any correlation between the degree of IL 1 production and the magnitude of the peritoneal macrophage inflammatory response, or between IL 1 production and LPS responsiveness (as determined by splenocyte proliferation). SDP analysis also indicated that the IL 1 response was not linked to macrophage tumoricidal activity. A comparison of the SDP for IL 1 production with a library of SDP for other known genetic waits suggested linkage with at least four loci on chromosome 1.\r"

  ".W": "Peritoneal macrophages from mice bearing a transplantable methylcholanthrene-induced sarcoma produced progressively less IL 1 as tumor burden increased. The loss of activity was not explained by the production of any inhibitor of the mouse thymocyte comitogen bioassay. Immune precipitation with a polyclonal antibody confirmed the decline in IL 1 appearance. Although tumor-bearing animals lost approximately 17% of their carcass mass, the reduced production of IL 1 was not satisfactorily explained by coexistent malnutrition, since similarly depleted non-tumor-bearing mice were capable of producing IL 1. In addition to an altered IL 1 production by macrophages of tumor-bearing mice, SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography revealed that the pattern of secretory protein synthesis from LPS-stimulated and unstimulated peritoneal macrophages differed between tumor-bearing and control animals. Administration of LPS to tumor-bearing mice early after tumor transplantation resulted in reduced tumor growth and prevented the down-regulation of in vitro IL 1 production by peritoneal macrophages. These findings demonstrate a specific defect in IL 1 production associated with increasing tumor burden. Further studies are required to determine whether this defect in IL 1 synthesis contributes to the increased tumor growth.\r"

  ".U": "87224092\r", 
  ".W": "We have studied the effects of recombinant mouse interleukin 4 (IL 4) (previously known as B cell stimulatory factor 1) on the antigen-presenting ability of murine splenic B cells and bone marrow macrophages. Our assay is based on the induction of antigen-presenting ability in these cells after incubation with IL 4 for 24 hr. The presenting cells were then used to stimulate IL 2 production by antigen-specific, I-Ad-restricted T cell hybridomas, a response mainly dependent on the induction of Ia antigens. Consistent with our previously published data using partially purified natural IL 4, we show here that recombinant IL 4 (but not interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) or IL 1) induces antigen-presenting ability in B cells. Recombinant IL 4 was also found to induce antigen-presenting ability in a cloned, bone marrow derived-macrophage cell line (14M1.4), and in normal bone marrow-derived macrophages. These macrophage populations also respond to IFN-gamma showing enhanced antigen-presenting ability (mediated by increased Ia antigen expression). A small but significant increase in Ia antigen expression was also detected in 14M1.4 macrophages induced with IL 4. However, additional analysis suggested that the effect of IL 4 on 14M1.4 is different from that of IFN-gamma, because IL 4 (but not IFN-gamma) is able to maintain the viability and increase the size of and metabolic activity of bone marrow macrophages. However, IL 4 may not affect all macrophages because the macrophage cell line P388D1, which responds to IFN-gamma, failed to show enhanced antigen-presenting function after stimulation with IL 4. These observations indicate that IL 4, a lymphokine previously considered to be B cell lineage specific, has effects on macrophages and may be involved in their activation.\r"

  ".U": "87224093\r", 
  ".W": "Interleukin 4 (IL 4), formerly known as B cell stimulatory factor 1 (BSF-1), has recently been described as a growth factor for T cells. The role of IL 4 in the putatively IL 2-independent growth of certain cloned T helper cells is unclear. D10.G4.1 (D10) is a conalbumin-specific helper T cell that has been employed extensively in the analysis of T cell activation and as an assay for the detection of IL 1. Previously, it was thought that IL 1 induced the expression of IL 2 receptors on D10 cells, thereby permitting D10 to proliferate in response to endogenously produced IL 2. However, we cannot detect IL 2 mRNA or protein in D10 cells or their supernatants as determined by the following criteria: monoclonal antibodies that neutralize the in vitro activity of murine IL 2 do not block the IL 1-dependent proliferation of D10 cells; no competitive binding for high-affinity IL 2 receptors with 125I-labeled IL 2 can be detected with medium conditioned by activated D10 cells; and Northern blot analysis and S1 nuclease protection assays, performed with cDNA probes for IL 2, do not detect mRNA for IL 2 under a variety of different activation conditions that foster autocrine growth of D10 cells. In contrast, activated D10 cells produce both IL 4 mRNA and protein as judged by similar criteria. Purified IL 4 has significant TCGF activity as measured by proliferation of HT-2 cells. This activity can be blocked completely by a monoclonal antibody to IL 4 (11B11). The proliferation of D10 cells in the presence of 3D3 (a clonotype-specific monoclonal anti-T cell receptor antibody) and IL 1 can be blocked completely by 11B11 antibody. Highly purified IL 4 alone cannot induce the proliferation of resting D10 cells; however, equivalent amounts of IL 4 in the presence of recombinant IL 1 induce significant D10 proliferation. Therefore, IL 1 appears to render D10 cells responsive to their autocrine growth signal. These data indicate that IL 4 serves as the autocrine T cell growth factor for D10 cells, and that exogenous IL 1 is required for the transduction of this growth signal. This may represent a more broadly applicable mechanism for the growth of certain subsets of T helper cells.\r"

Various sublines of IL 2-dependent (and ostensibly specific) HT-2 and CTLL cells have now been shown to proliferate in response to BSF-1/IL 4 as well. After activation with antigen or mitogen, D10.G4.1, an antigen-specific cloned T helper cell that has recently been shown to produce IL 4 but not IL 2, secretes two distinct cytokines that induce the growth of HT-2 cells. These \"T cell growth factors\" (TCGF) can be separated by reversed phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC). The TCGF activity of one of these factors can be blocked by 11B11, an antibody specific for IL 4. The second TCGF activity is not affected by 11B11 or by antibodies specific for IL 2. This TCGF activity can be neutralized by a goat polyclonal antibody to granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), and has a RP-HPLC elution profile identical to that of recombinant GM-CSF. Recombinant GM-CSF induces both proliferation and long-term growth of HT-2 but not CTLL cells, and this activity can be neutralized by the same antibody to GM-CSF. GM-CSF is best known as a factor that induces the maturation and growth of granulocytes and macrophages from bone marrow-derived hematopoietic precursor cells. The ability of GM-CSF to induce the growth of certain T cell lines indicates that this molecule may play a role in T cell-mediated immune responses, either as an autocrine growth factor or a paracrine stimulus from both lymphoid and nonlymphoid tissues that produce this cytokine.\r"

All cloned T cell lines produce T cell growth factors that can be distinguished by the ability of monoclonal antibodies to inhibit the proliferation of cytokine-dependent T cell lines induced by these T cell growth factors. From these types of analyses, it has been shown that all cloned T cells that help hapten-specific B cells secrete immunoglobulin, produce interleukin 4 (IL 4). Those cloned T cells that fail to help for anti-hapten responses produce neither IL 4 nor interleukin 2 (IL 2), yet release an activity that induces the proliferation of the cytokine-dependent T cell line, HT-2. Additional analysis of the HT-2 stimulating activity has shown that it is indistinguishable from granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF)--this activity being produced by all cloned T cells tested. Thus GM-CSF is a product of all cloned L3T4a+ T cell lines tested thus far, and can serve as a T cell growth factor for HT-2, as well as a co-factor for in vivo derived T cells.\r"

We compared the effect of purified recombinant human TNF-alpha and TNF-beta on neutrophil adhesion molecule expression and hematopoietic growth factor production by cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells. Endothelial cells acquired adhesive properties for neutrophils after a 4-hr incubation with as little as 5 U/ml TNF-alpha. TNF-alpha stimulated a dose-dependent increase in endothelial cell adhesiveness for neutrophils, with a maximal effect at 250 U/ml. In contrast, TNF-beta did not enhance endothelial-dependent neutrophil adherence until a concentration of 600 to 1200 U/ml was reached. Endothelial cells cultured for 24 hr with TNF-alpha, 10 to 1,000 U/ml, released hematopoietic colony-stimulating activity. TNF-beta failed to augment growth factor production by endothelial cells at any concentration tested. Inhibitor assays showed that the absence of detectable colony-stimulating activity was not due to direct inhibition of colony growth by TNF-beta or to release of hematopoietic inhibitors by the TNF-beta-stimulated endothelial cells. Purified natural TNF-beta was similar to recombinant TNF-beta in its effect on neutrophil adhesion molecule expression and growth factor production by endothelial cells. These results indicate that the two immunomodulatory proteins TNF-alpha and TNF-beta differ in their effects on a common target tissue. TNF-beta, which retains tumoricidal properties, shows fewer proinflammatory activities on cultured endothelial cells than TNF-alpha in vitro.\r"

Cross-reactivity between the Q region controlled CTL determinant and a Kk region controlled class I product (probably H-2Kk) was observed. Finally, among lymphocytes, the CTL determinant is expressed preferentially (if not exclusively) on B cells, thus distinguishing it from all previously described Q region controlled determinants, which are expressed predominantly on T cells. We provisionally designate this novel Q region controlled CTL determinant Qc-1. The possibility that Qc-1 is recognized together with a self antigen is discussed.\r"

In complement-dependent depletion experiments and immunofluorescence studies on the nature of Fo-positive leukocytes in CBA/J mice the following results were obtained: whereas blood monocytes, polymorphonuclear leukocytes, and lymphocytes were Fo negative, 5 to 10% of suspended spleen cells were positive. The majority of these were macrophage-like, glass- and nylon-adherent, nonspecific esterase-positive phagocytizing cells carrying Ia and globoside markers. These cells participated as accessory cells in the mixed lymphocyte culture reaction. In cell suspensions from axillary and inguinal lymph nodes, 2% were Fo positive. They were enriched up to 70% in the glass-adherent, esterase-positive population from this source.

These antigens generate brisk responses in normal spleen and Peyer's patch cell cultures of xid mice, all of which suggest that responses are elicited in the Lyb-3+, 5+ B subpopulation. The antibody responses to TNP-M1 g (and TNP-M1 c) are not dependent upon T cells. Furthermore, TNP-M1 carbohydrates induce anti-TNP plaque-forming (PFC) responses in cultures of small, resting splenic B cell populations without an added T cell requirement. Thus two categories of type 2 antigens are distinguished, one which requires T cells or derived factors, e.g., TNP-Ficoll, and a second TNP-carbohydrate antigen TNP-M1 that does not. Studies of the mitogenic and polyclonal B cell activation properties of M1 carbohydrates indicated that B cell proliferation is induced in both xid (Lyb-3-, 5-) and normal (Lyb-3-, 5- and Lyb-3+, 5+) splenic B cell subpopulations, but that differentiation to IgM synthesis fails to occur in the Lyb-3-, 5- B cell subpopulation. Thus M1 carbohydrates are unique probes that allow the selective induction of proliferation and differentiation of mature B cells that are presumably Lyb-3+, 5+. Because the M1 serotype carbohydrates induce polyclonal IgM synthesis and antigen-specific responses in only the mature B cell population in the absence of T cells, whereas TNP-Ficoll and other type 2 antigens require T cells or their derived factors, the Lyb-3+, 5+ B cell subpopulation may consist of a T cell-dependent and a T cell-independent compartment for responses to different carbohydrate type 2 antigens.\r"

The results show that the 17-9 idiotype is recurrently expressed by all mice carrying the IgCHb haplotype, regardless of H-2 or background genes, and that this idiotype accounts for roughly one-half of the primary, specific response to Dex B512 in C57BL/6 mice. Backcross analysis confirmed the allotype-linkage of idiotype expression in the antibody response. Mice carrying other allotypes, however, had detectable levels of the 17-9 idiotype in normal sera, which was not associated with anti-Dex antibody activity and was not raised by specific immunization.

It was found that although mice of 3 to 18 mo of age were fully resistant to a standard immunizing dose of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, progressive mortality was observed in old (24 to 28 mo) mice. Death of these older animals was associated with an inability to contain or to eliminate the mycobacterial infection in the spleen and liver, and with an inability to prevent the progressive growth of the infection in the lungs. It was then revealed by the use of reciprocal passive cell transfer experiments that the age-related susceptibility of old mice reflected an inability to generate mediator protective T lymphocytes in response to the infection. In contrast, no evidence was obtained to indicate any defect at the effector cell (macrophage) level, as evidenced primarily by the finding that immune T cells from young mice conferred equivalent levels of immunity upon both old and young recipients. The results suggest therefore that T cell-mediated immunity undergoes an age-related decline in terms of its ability to respond to infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis.\r"

A cell line bearing an altered E beta k molecule has been examined to provide more information about the relationship between Ia structure and function. The cell line, 2B1, was derived from the TA3 B cell hybridoma through a series of negative and positive immunoselection steps. The 2B1 mutant lacked the binding site recognized by the 17.3.3 monoclonal antibody (mAb) but presented antigen normally to all I-Ek-restricted T cell hybridomas and clones examined. Sequence analysis of the mutant E beta k gene showed a single base transition (G----A) that resulted in an arginine to a histidine substitution at amino acid 49 of the beta 1 domain. This mutation demonstrates that residue 49 is not involved in antigen presentation to T cells but can be involved in B cell recognition (mAb binding).\r"

A recombinant murine genomic library was screened with a human lymphotoxin cDNA probe, resulting in the isolation of the entire LT gene. The murine LT gene structure is similar to the human gene, containing three intervening sequences. An activated murine T cell cDNA library was prepared with poly(A)+ RNA isolated 7 hr after concanavalin A stimulation of an L3T4+ interleukin 2-dependent murine T cell clone. Two colonies of the cDNA library that contained inserts that hybridized with the murine LT gene probe were sequenced and were used to construct expression plasmids. The amino acid sequence deduced from the cDNA indicates that murine LT is highly homologous to human LT (74%) and is related to murine tumor necrosis factor (35% homology). The cDNA was transcribed and was translated in vitro, and was expressed in COS-1 cells. This has resulted in the production of LT biological activity.\r"

  ".W": "The therapeutic efficacy of whole ricin, or recombinant ricin A chain, coupled to a monoclonal antibody that reacts with the idiotype of the surface IgM expressed on guinea pig L2C lymphoblasts, was assessed. In vitro studies were done to characterize the immunotoxins (IT) and to demonstrate their specificity before use in vivo. The concentration of whole ricin IT (M6-Ricin) that inhibited protein synthesis by 50% (IC50) in L2C cells was 1.4 X 10(-9) M, in a 5-hr assay, in the presence of lactose to block non-antibody-directed toxicity. M6-Ricin did not inhibit protein synthesis in two control guinea pig cell lines that did not express the idiotype, nor did a whole ricin IT prepared with an isotype-matched monoclonal antibody of irrelevant specificity inhibit protein synthesis in L2C cells. Two recombinant ricin A chain IT, which differed from one another by a factor of 2 to 3 in the number of A chains conjugated per antibody molecule, were less effective in vitro than M6-Ricin (IC50 of greater than 5 X 10(-8) M). For in vivo experiments, the IT were given by the i.p. route 24 hr after the i.p. inoculation of 1 X 10(5) L2C cells. The highest doses of M6-Ricin and M6-Ricin A chain IT tested, 30 micrograms/kg and 3000 micrograms/kg, respectively, were within fourfold to fivefold of their maximum tolerated doses; no deaths or ill effects due to ricin toxicity were noted. These doses increased the median survival time of L2C-bearing guinea pigs to 31 to 34 days, compared with 15 days for untreated animals. This magnitude of increase in survival indicates that 99.999% (5 logs) of injected tumor cells were eliminated, thus accounting for the 12% long-term survival rate obtained. Median survival times for guinea pigs treated with 30 micrograms/kg of the A chain IT were 18 and 21 days for the two conjugates tested, and the median survival for guinea pigs treated with 3000 micrograms/kg of unconjugated antibody was 18 days. Our data demonstrate that recombinant A chain IT are active in vivo and that the B chain of ricin can potentiate IT activity in vivo. Although the potency differs by 100-fold, the therapeutic index of the intact ricin IT is similar to that of the ricin A chain IT.\r"

We show that preincubation of resting B cells with BSF-1 alone prepares them to secrete IgG1, but not IgE, on subsequent stimulation with LPS. The ability of BSF-1 preincubation to increase overall viable cell yield on the subsequent addition of LPS only partially accounts for this enhancement. The degree of enhancement is dependent on the duration of preincubation, up to at least 48 hr. BSF-1 exerts this effect on resting B cells which have been selected for absence of surface IgG and in the presence of the reversible DNA synthesis inhibitor, hydroxyurea. BSF-1 can act to significantly enhance the IgG1 response when added for 48-hr periods before, at the same time as, or after the addition of LPS. These results suggest strongly that the mode of action of BSF-1 in preparing for the secretion of IgG1 is independent of that of LPS.\r"

An analog of alpha-MSH (Nle4, D-Phe7 alpha-MSH), known to be more potent than native alpha-MSH in a number of melanotropin-sensitive systems, was determined to be more active than alpha-MSH in the modification of these same in vivo responses. Neither alpha-MSH nor its analog were capable of altering the capacity of IL 1 to stimulate increased plasma levels in prostaglandin E2 (PGE2). In vitro, neither alpha-MSH nor its analog were capable of reducing the capacity of IL 1 to stimulate fibroblast production of PGE2 or to augment the proliferation of murine thymocytes exposed to phytohemagglutinin. The apparent selectivity associated with the regulatory influences of alpha-MSH on IL 1-induced responses in vivo suggests that this neuropeptide may function as an endogenous inhibitor of certain immunomodulatory and inflammatory activities of the cytokine IL 1.\r"

  ".W": "The cloned murine interleukin 3 (IL 3)-dependent cell lines FD.C/1, 32Dc1-23, and KP3 can each be switched to interleukin 2 (IL 2)-dependent growth states. Replication-defective retroviral vectors have been used to introduce the v-src oncogene into each of these cell lines maintained in either an IL 3- or an IL 2-dependent growth state. These cell lines maintained in an IL 3-dependent growth state were converted to lymphokine-independent growth after infection with v-src. These same cells maintained in an IL 2-dependent growth state and infected with v-src maintained strict lymphokine dependence for growth. Another cloned murine IL 3-dependent cell line, GM, can be switched to a granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF)-dependent growth state. GM cells maintained as IL 3- or GM-CSF-dependent cells readily converted to a lymphokine-independent growth state when infected with v-src. These experiments indicate that either there exist differences in the biochemical mechanisms of signal transduction through the IL 3- and IL 2-specific receptors, or developmental processes associated with the switching of cells to an IL 2-dependent growth state influence expression of the v-src gene product. These cell lines offer new ways not only for analyzing biochemical pathways that regulate cell growth, but also for analyzing the control of oncogene expression.\r"

Incubation of PMA-treated, paraformaldehyde-fixed U937 cells with the murine cell line D10.G4.1 in the presence of concanavalin A caused an increase in DNA synthesis as measured by the uptake of tritiated thymidine. Paraformaldehyde-fixed U937, not pretreated with PMA, showed little or no activity. A rabbit polyclonal antibody directed against human IL 1 neutralized all membrane-associated IL 1-like activity, as measured by the inhibition of D10.G4.1 cell proliferation. PMA-treated U937 caused a pronounced enhancement of PGE2 production from a human chondrosarcoma cell line, SW-1353. Membrane-associated IL 1 induced a more potent PGE2 response than did a maximal concentration of soluble IL 1. Rabbit antihuman IL 1 neutralized membrane-bound IL 1 induction of PGE2. The data presented here raise the possibility that membrane-bound IL 1 may play a primary role in the pathophysiology of the inflammatory disease process.\r"

The 60-kDa protein on activated human B cells could bind secreted IgM molecules of both mouse and human origin, as well as endogenous membrane-bound IgM molecules following their cross-linkage with anti-mu antibodies.

  ".W": "BALB/c mice can be protected against a fatal Leishmania major infection by immunization with whole radio-attenuated promastigotes; however, neither the antigens responsible for protection nor the protective immunologic mechanisms have been defined. In this study, the ability of promastigote fractions to elicit similar immunity to that obtained with whole organisms, and the immune responses associated with such protection were analyzed. Intraperitoneal immunization with a soluble, membrane-free parasite extract was found to induce protection against L. major challenge equal to that obtained with whole organisms. Induction of immunity (89% protection in seven experiments) was most effective with 100 micrograms of the soluble leishmanial antigen (SLA) and required concomitant injection of the bacterial adjuvant, Corynebacterium parvum (CP), followed by an i.p. boost of SLA alone 1 wk later. Vaccinated animals exhibited Leishmania-specific cell-mediated immunity, as assessed both by lymphocyte transformation and the production of macrophage-activating factors (MAF). In addition, although SLA + CP-immunized mice failed to exhibit delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) before challenge, splenic lymphocytes from these mice could transfer a local DTH reaction to naive recipients. Immunization also induced the production of antibodies against two major metabolically labeled proteins of m.w. 30,000 and 53,000, but failed to stimulate a detectable humoral response against promastigote surface antigens. Thus, these experiments demonstrate that vaccine-induced immunity against cutaneous leishmaniasis is strongly associated with the induction of cell-mediated immunity, but does not require the development of an antibody response to promastigote surface antigens. In addition, these studies establish the feasibility of employing soluble, nonmembrane-derived parasite material as a source of protective immunogens.\r"

A comparison of different sialidases and sialyltransferases suggests that the removal of only a subset of total surface sialic acid, rather than net desialylation of the cell surface, is required. Three sialidases were compared, including Vibrio cholerae (VC) and Clostridium perfringens (CP), which will cleave alpha 2-3, alpha 2-6, and alpha 2-8, sialic acid linkages, and Newcastle Disease virus (NDV), which will remove only alpha 2-3 and alpha 2-8 linked sialic acid. When treated with equivalent units of sialidase, CP-, VC-, and NDV-treated cells were 24-fold, sixfold, and threefold better stimulators than untreated cells. In contrast, VC released 1.3-fold and 2.5-fold more sialic acid per cell than did CP or NDV, respectively. Furthermore, VC was superior in reducing the levels of binding of the sialic acid-specific lectin, Limulus polyphemus agglutinin, in exposing Gal beta 1-3GalNAc and Gal beta 1-4GlcNAc residues, and in desialylating gangliosides. Two-dimensional gel analysis indicated that VC and CP were both equal and superior to NDV in the desialylation of iodinatable cell-surface proteins, including H-2Kk, I-A beta k, and a highly sialylated 65,000 dalton protein of unknown identity. Maximal resialylation of CP-treated cells with exogenously added CMP-NANA and either the alpha 2-3(Gal beta 1-3GalNAc) or alpha 2-6(Gal beta 1-4GlcNAc) sialyltransferase did not reduce the stimulatory capacity of these cells. However, resialylation of VC-treated cells with just CMP-NANA alone resulted in 49% reversal of their stimulatory capacity, and no additional reversal could be achieved with either of the sialyltransferases. Although the alpha 2-6(Gal beta 1-4GlcNAc) sialyltransferase was capable of adding back approximately 10% of the sialic acid removed, the endogenous activity added back approximately 0.1% of the total sialic acid removed. SDS-PAGE gels of the sialylated cells indicated that the exogenously added sialyltransferase labeled many different proteins, whereas the endogenous activity labeled far fewer proteins, predominantly in 46,000 and 25,000 m.w. range. Both the desialylation and resialylation data suggest that the sialidase-dependent stimulation is due to the desialylation of specific membrane structures. Together with previous studies, these data suggest that the sialic acids involved are probably alpha 2-6 linked to N-linked glycosyl moieties.\r"

Similarly, the bone marrow cell population necessary for induction of killer cells with highest cytotoxic activity displayed NK cell surface characteristics, as exemplified by CD16 and Leu-7 antigens. On the contrary, very low or no lytic activity was generated from the bone marrow cell population expressing T cell markers CD3 and CD5. These data indicate that the IL 2-dependent bone marrow-derived killer cells with antitumor activity were activated NK cells. If T cells are involved at all in IL 2-dependent bone marrow killing, their potency is inferior to that of activated NK cells. The clinical applications of these studies are discussed.\r"

The suppression of LAK cell induction by human AM was dependent on the density of AM added to the lymphocyte cultures. Recombinant IFN-gamma did not affect AM-mediated suppression of LAK cell induction by IL 2. Both AM and monocytes stimulated with lipopolysaccharide markedly suppressed LAK cell induction by IL 2. AM-mediated down-regulation was seen only when AM were added immediately after the start of incubation of lymphocytes with IL 2; AM potentiated LAK activity when added 1 day later. Similar AM-mediated suppression of LAK cell induction was observed with four lines of allogeneic lung cancer cells as targets for LAK activity. These results indicate that AM may be important in regulation of in situ induction of LAK activity in the lung.\r"

  ".W": "Systemic transfer of sensitized lymphocytes can effectively mediate the regression of established tumors. However, virtually all prior experimental applications of this approach have utilized lymphocytes from animals that have been immunized to reject tumor challenge. A similar source of cells is not available in the human. With the use of a weakly immunogenic murine tumor, MCA 105, we demonstrate here that following in vitro sensitization (IVS) with viable tumor cells and interleukin 2, the nontherapeutic lymphoid cells from mice bearing a progressively growing tumor acquired antitumor reactivity capable of mediating the regression of established pulmonary metastases. Although the IVS system induced nonspecific lymphokine-activated killer-like cytotoxic activity from lymphoid cells of normal as well as tumor-bearing mice, therapeutically active cells could only be generated from cultures initiated with lymphoid cells from tumor-bearing animals, indicating that the IVS was a secondary in vitro immune response. Without other treatment, the IVS cells could mediate antitumor effects. However, low doses of exogenous interleukin 2 administration could enhance their therapeutic efficacy. By in vivo T cell subset depletion with monoclonal antibodies, the primary effector cells were identified as belonging to cytotoxic/suppressor T cell lineage expressing the Lyt-2 phenotype. In addition, these therapeutic effector cells could be further expanded in numbers in vitro with continuous stimulation by tumor cells in the presence of interleukin 2. Compared to the number of cells initiating the culture, as many as 126 times the number of cells were obtained after 9 days of IVS followed by in vitro expansion for an additional 5 days. Studies on the kinetics of the occurrence of the pre-effector lymphocytes during tumor growth revealed that they were readily obtained from draining lymph nodes of mice with a broad range of tumor burdens as well as durations of tumor growth. The ability to generate and expand, in vitro, therapeutically active lymphocytes from tumor-bearing hosts has important implications for cellular therapy of human cancers.\r"

Microscopic and cell sorter analysis of cells isolated from a series of fresh normal tonsils have identified a subpopulation of normal B cells carrying the same cell surface markers. That BLA and CALLA could be co-expressed on individual B cells was demonstrated by two-color immunofluorescence (IF) of tonsils in suspension, and immunoperoxidase (IP) staining of serial tonsil sections. These BLA+, CALLA+, \"activation\" antigen- cells were further characterized as B1+, sIgM+, sIgD-, C3d/EB virus receptor+ and were susceptible to virus-induced transformation in vitro. IF studies on Percoll-fractionated tonsillar cell populations and direct examination of IP-stained tonsil semi-thin sections indicated that the BLA+, CALLA+ cells were localized in germinal centers. Their morphological characteristics matched those of BL cells, and their location within germinal centers was consistent both with the known phenotype of germinal center tonsillar B cells and with the description of BL as a proliferation of centroblasts. We suggest that this population of tonsillar germinal center B cells provides the normal counterpart of BL tumor cells.\r"

  ".W": "Inoculation of an immortalized clone of radiation leukemia virus (RadLV)-transformed antigen (ovalbumin, OVA)-specific T cells together with the relevant carrier (OVA) into unprimed syngeneic mice results in a preferential increase in the expression of anti-OVA antibodies of the immunoglobulin (Ig)G2b and IgG2a isotypes. Identical boosting of the clone-primed mice further augments the preferential production of anti-OVA antibodies of these two isotypes. The class-related helper activity is not due to nonspecific shift of class expression produced by the injected tumor cells, as a non-helper clone of RadLV-transformed T cells does not change the isotypic pattern of anti-OVA antibodies in the inoculated mice. A carrier-specific activation of the B cells is responsible for the class-restricted function of the helper clone. The isotypic profile of anti-hapten antibodies in mice injected with 2,4-dinitrophenyl (DNP)-bovine serum albumin and OVA-specific helper clone is not altered. On the other hand, mice inoculated with the OVA-specific helper clone and DNP-OVA respond with a preferential elevation of anti-DNP antibodies of the IgG2a and IgG2b isotypes. The preferential class augmentation may result from carrier-specific signals delivered by the helper clone which activate B cells in vivo toward certain CH expression. Alternatively, the observed class pattern may be induced by an isotype noncommited helper clone which triggers selected population of B lymphocytes of defined differentiation status toward secretion of a restricted array of isotypes. Regardless of the mechanism of the clone-dependent class expression, the isotypic profile in most of the experiments clearly demonstrates that an antigen-specific helper clone may be one of the elements which regulates the class of antibodies to be produced in vivo under normal physiologic conditions.\r"

  ".W": "Binding of porcine interleukin 1, radiolabeled with Bolton-Hunter reagent (125I IL 1), to monolayers of porcine synovial fibroblasts (PSF) was found to be a temperature-dependent process. The rate of uptake and the amount of cell-associated ligand was higher at 37 degrees C than at 4 degrees C or 19 degrees C, and exceeded the apparent equilibrium binding capacity. The amount of bound 125I IL 1 that was removed by brief treatment with acidic buffers decreased from 80% at 4 degrees C to 35% for PSF incubated at 37 degrees C; this procedure was used to distinguish surface-bound from internalized ligand. In untreated PSF, surface binding was maximal at 1 hr and was maintained for at least 5 hr during which time the internal pool continued to increase. The lysosomotropic agent methylamine (20 mM) decreased surface binding by 50%; monensin (20 microM) decreased the rate and extent of internalization. Cycloheximide (10 micrograms/ml) did not affect ligand uptake, hence, continual expression of surface receptors could not be ascribed to their de novo synthesis. 40% of the radioactivity taken up by PSF during incubation at 37 degrees C subsequently appeared in the culture medium upon prolonged postincubation (5 hr) in the absence of added 125I IL 1: 60% of this fraction was trichloroacetic acid-soluble in untreated cultures, but the extent of degradation was halved by treatment with methylamine or monensin. Direct measurement of the rate of internalization of prebound 125I IL 1 was obtained by monitoring the formation of covalently cross-linked ligand-receptor complexes after warming PSF monolayers to 37 degrees C. By using gel electrophoresis we observed a decrease (t1/2 = 9 to 11 min) in labeling of the major cross-linkable species.\r"

No demonstrable IL-1 beta protein could be observed on the cell surface by antibody staining, while both IL-1 alpha and IL-1 beta could be visualized intracellularly by the appropriate monoclonal antibodies following acetone permeabilization of the monocytes. Further experiments with cell associated IL-1 revealed that most of the biological activity of human monocytes could be inhibited by affinity purified polyclonal antibodies to IL-1 alpha protein, whereas no inhibitory activity was observed with IL-1 beta specific antibodies. These data support the hypothesis that a differential localization of IL-1 alpha and IL-1 beta exists within human blood-derived monocytes.\r"

  ".W": "Binding of von Willebrand factor (vWF) to collagen and to \"collagen-stimulated platelets\" was studied. Purified human iodine 125-labeled vWF binds to collagen. Binding was rapid, dependent on collagen and vWF concentration, independent of divalent ion concentration, and inhibited by unlabeled vWF as well as by high concentrations of fibronectin and fibrinogen. It was blocked by six monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) to human vWF (B200 through B205). Conversely, binding of 125I-vWF to platelets in the presence of collagen (collagen-treated platelets) was time dependent, saturable, and dependent on collagen, vWF, and divalent ion concentration. It was also inhibited by unlabeled vWF, fibronectin, or fibrinogen as well as by MAbs to vWF B200 through B205. In addition, binding of vWF to collagen-treated platelets was blocked by MAb to vWF 9 previously shown to inhibit binding of vWF to glycoprotein (GP) IIb-IIIa as well as by a MAb to GPIIb-IIIa. This binding was also strikingly decreased with use of patient platelets deficient in either GPIIb-IIIa or GPIa, whereas it was normal in the presence of a MAb to GPIb or when testing patient platelets deficient in GPIb. In conclusion, binding of vWF to platelets in the presence of collagen appeared to be a three-step phenomenon, including: binding of vWF to collagen; interaction of collagen with its receptor on the platelet membrane (GPIa ?), leading to activation of platelets and exposure of GPIIb-IIIa; and binding of vWF to GPIIb-IIIa.\r"

  ".W": "The mean survival period in a series of 216 multiple sclerosis deaths, which formed part of a large prevalence sample observed in the Grampian region of Scotland, was 24.5 years, with an insignificant difference between females (25.7 years) and males (23.5 years). A third of the patients survived for over 30 years after onset. The age at death ranged between 25-80 years, with majority of the deaths occurring in the seventh decade (37%). On comparing life expectancy with the Scottish general population using life tables, only a slight reduction in the short-term (less than 10 years from onset) survival was noted in all age groups, with the exception of those with onset over the age of 50 years. The long-term life expectancy was however markedly reduced in all age groups compared with the controls. The survival period could be accurately predicted from the degree of disability at a point in time, and could be correlated with a number of clinical features, the most important of which was the age at onset. Eighty five per cent of those with onset of multiple sclerosis over the age of 50 years died within 20 years. Patients with a cerebellar disturbance at onset survived the shortest, and those with a brainstem lesion or retrobulbar neuritis the longest; those with a pyramidal dysfunction had an intermediate prognosis. Other parameters which could be correlated with the survival were: the timing and frequency of occurrence of psychiatric and urinary symptoms, interval between onset and first relapse and the course of the disease.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Supernatants of unstimulated T lymphocytes from healthy subjects did not produce demyelination, but when T cells were stimulated by phytohaemagglutinin (PHA), 50% of tested supernatants produced demyelination, which was, however, never as advanced as in multiple sclerosis supernatant treated cerebellum cultures. The demyelinating activity proved to be heat labile. Gel filtration study revealed two fractions of the demyelinating activity 12.5-29.0 kD and 43.0-66.0 kD. The results suggest that lymphokines can be directly involved in the pathogenesis of demyelination in multiple sclerosis.\r"

Initially, biodistribution was investigated in mice. The rapid and high uptake of 11C radioactivity in the brain was observed following intravenous injection of [11C]DMPEA, the peak of which was reached at 1 min, followed by a decrease at 1-5 min and slowly thereafter. The kinetics of [11C]DMPEA in the human brain were determined using positron emission tomography (PET) and showed that 11C radioactivity increased gradually over 60 min following initial rapid uptake of 11C radioactivity, with basal ganglia and thalamus showing high accumulation.\r"

  ".W": "Positron emission tomography (PET) with rubidium-82 (82Rb) has been developed to measure regional myocardial perfusion and to detect transient ischemia both in the experimental laboratory and in humans. There are known and separate contaminating effects of the 82Rb signal by disturbances in wall motion, wall thinning, and the partial volume effect that occur during transient ischemia. In nine anesthetized greyhounds, PET with 82Rb (T1/2 = 78 sec) was used to determine the regional myocardial uptake of this cation during a control period that consisted of a mild stenosis of the left anterior descending coronary artery in the absence of ischemia (to limit reactive hyperemia), during 10 min of total occlusion and, finally, at 30 and 60 min of recovery with release of the occlusion but not of the stenosis. Separately, rubidium-81 (81Rb); T1/2 = 4.58 hr) was given as a peripheral intravenous injection 2 hr before the study to allow this long-lived tracer to distribute in the potassium space of the myocardium. Observations during control and ischemia revealed marked decreases in 82Rb uptake (0.84 +/- 0.12 to 0.28 +/- 0.12, p = 0.001) in affected regions and were paralleled by similar decreases in microsphere blood flow (0.88 +/- 0.08 to 0.12 +/- 0.10 ml/min/g, p = 0.003), which gradually recovered by 60 min postischemia. Lesser decreases in 81Rb activity (0.84 +/- 0.11 to 0.76 +/- 0.17, p = 0.83) were observed in the same regions during ischemia, but these were immediately reversible. Separate in vitro postmortem experiments in eight rabbits confirmed a linear relationship between plasma and myocardial activities of stable potassium and 81Rb although there was a greater concentration of 81Rb in the myocardium that in the plasma relative to potassium (y = -3.29 +/- 0.79 x, s.e.e. 1.91, r = 0.95). These studies demonstrate that if 81Rb is given intravenously to distribute into the potassium pool, tomograms of the heart may be recorded to measure the potassium-rich mass of myocardium providing information about the acute effects of wall thinning during ischemia. Rubidium-81 used in this way may be helpful in assessing the effects of wall thinning and/or scar when other tracers are being used to assess perfusion or metabolism.\r"

The T-cell number remained unchanged, but B-cell and macrophage numbers were increased in vitamin A--deficient mice. Surface expression of membrane glycoproteins (Thy-1, Lyt-1, Lyt-2, L3T4, IgM, Mac-1) was unchanged by the deficiency, as were lymphocyte numbers and distribution. The results suggest that vitamin A deficiency is associated with a functional immune system defect.\r"
