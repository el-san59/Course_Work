  ".W": "Signs of latent HIV infection were sought in stored serum samples collected before overt seroconversion, confirmed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), from 9 subjects with human-immunodeficiency-virus (HIV) infection, in serum from 25 seronegative sexual partners of HIV-seropositive men and from 23 other seronegative, homosexually active men. Free HIV antigen and/or low-titre antibodies to recombinant structural (core, env) or non-structural (3' orf, sor, tat) proteins were seen 6-14 months before seroconversion in all 9 subjects who seroconverted. Antibodies against core proteins detected by western blot were usually the first sign of latent HIV infection. 5 of the 25 ELISA-negative exposed partners have shown HIV antigenaemia and antibodies against core proteins for 16-34 months. By in-situ hybridisation, HIV-specific RNA was detected in peripheral-blood non-lymphoid mononuclear cells in some of the latently infected partners. All subjects with latent HIV infection had normal numbers of T4 lymphocytes but half of them lost their in-vitro proliferative T-cell response to a recall antigen (purified protein derivative of tuberculin). Early HIV infection, characterised by a low-level and restricted antibody response towards HIV core and regulatory proteins, seems mainly to affect antigen-presenting cells.\r"

Failure to elevate lactate in blood washed out from ischemically exercised muscles confirms an abnormality of glycolytic metabolism. A normal increase of lactate on FIET is assumed to rule out a disorder of glycolytic metabolism. Two patients with low levels of muscle phosphorylase are presented who produced a normal elevation of lactate on FIET. This suggests that, although the FIET is capable of identifying patients with absence of myophosphorylase, the test cannot identify patients with a partial expression of that disorder. Evaluation of the blood samples for ammonia in addition to lactate can be a significant help in confirming that the exercise performed by the patient was an adequate challenge for the glycolytic pathway. In addition, failure to elevate ammonia on ischemic exercise can identify a relatively new disorder of muscle metabolism.\r"

  ".U": "87315422\r", 
  ".W": "Retroviruses lacking oncogenes can induce tumours in animals, and the tumour cells are frequently found to contain proviral DNA inserted next to a proto-oncogene, which is thus placed under the regulatory control of the retroviral long terminal repeat (LTR). This altered regulation leads to overexpression of the proto-oncogene, which presumably contributes to the growth properties of the tumour cells. fim-2 has been described as a retroviral integration site frequently and specifically involved in murine myeloblastic leukaemias induced in vivo or in vitro by the replication-competent Friend murine leukaemia virus (F-MuLV). Here we report that fim-2 spans the 5'-end of the murine proto-oncogene c-fms, known to code for a transmembrane glycoprotein with tyrosine kinase activity probably identical to the receptor of the haemopoietic growth factor, monocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF or CSF-1). Proviral integration in the fim-2 region results in a high expression of a normal sized c-fms messenger RNA. We also observe that some tumours have lost the fim-2/c-fms germ line allele. These results provide the first evidence for the presumed involvement of c-fms in myelomonocytic leukaemias.\r"

The results of DNA studies modified the carrier risks for 34 of the 59 (58%), but the derived risks often did not differ importantly from risks calculated by conventional methods. Elevated CK/PK provided strong evidence of the carrier state for 24 of the 59 (41%), and CK/PK frequently provided data unavailable through DNA studies. Serum enzyme determinations remain an important means of evaluating DD carrier suspects and are especially valuable in isolated-case families. Enzyme testing should be combined with DNA studies to achieve the best estimate of carrier risk.\r"

The diagnosis of oral CMV infection was established when large intranuclear and smaller cytoplasmic CMV inclusions were observed in endothelial cells at the base of the mucosal ulcer. The identification of intranuclear and intracytoplasmic herpes-type viral particles in the infected cells was confirmed by electron microscopy. Cytoplasmic viral particles coexisted with paranuclear dense bodies resembling lysosomes. These features are characteristic of CMV-infected cells. A review of the English-language literature disclosed only three previously reported cases of CMV infection involving the oral mucous membranes. A vasculitis associated with the CMV-infected endothelial cells appears to be the underlying mechanism responsible for development of the oral ulcer. CMV should be considered a possible causative agent when oral ulcers are detected in immunocompromised patients. Likewise, the finding of CMV in oral ulcers should alert one to the possibility of an immunocompromised state.\r"

Also, the use of xeroradiographic cassettes causes a slight increase in patient discomfort. In addition, two types of rectangular collimating devices were shown to be useful. The greatest shortcoming of the xeroradiographic cassette is not its greater thickness or rigidity but the reduced dimensions of its internal surface area.\r"

Protein distribution patterns of uncooked pearl millet and shifts in the different fractions as a result of cooking also resembled that of maize and not sorghum. The amino acid profile of pearl millet is more favorable than that of normal sorghum and normal maize and is comparable to the small grains, wheat, barley, and rice. On the basis of these findings, it appears that pearl millet is a nutritious and well-digested source of calories and proteins for humans.\r"

There is minimal TGF-beta secretion in unactivated monocytes, even though TGF-beta mRNA is expressed in these cells at a level similar to that in activated, lipopolysaccharide-treated cultures. U937 lymphoma cells, which have monocytic characteristics, also express mRNA for TGF-beta. Freshly isolated monocytes, both control and lipopolysaccharide-treated, secrete an acid-labile binding protein that inhibits TGF-beta action. We conclude the following: (i) that expression of TGF-beta mRNA is unrelated to monocyte activation, (ii) that secretion of TGF-beta is induced by monocyte activation, and (iii) that cosecretion of TGF-beta and its monocyte/macrophage-derived binding protein may modulate growth factor action. In contrast, monocytic expression of other growth factor genes, such as the B chain of platelet-derived growth factor, is not constitutive and requires activation.\r"

  ".W": "We have identified a cellular transcription factor from uninfected HeLa cells that stimulates the simian virus 40 (SV40) late mode of transcription and specifically binds the SV40 21-base-pair repeat promoter element. In particular, the late SV40 transcription factor (LSF) stimulates transcription at initiation sites L325 and L264 of the SV40 late promoter, which are the major transcription sites utilized after DNA replication during the SV40 lytic cycle. In addition, LSF appears to stimulate transcription to a lesser extent from the late-early initiation site of the early promoter. LSF binds specifically to the 21-base-pair repeats of the SV40 promoters, forming specific protein-DNA complexes, which migrate more rapidly through nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels than that formed by the previously identified transcription factor Sp1. Thus, LSF is distinguishable from Sp1 in both its transcriptional and DNA-binding properties. These findings suggest a potential role of LSF in the early to late transcriptional switch during a SV40 lytic infection.\r"

  ".W": "In vitro-transcribed human interferon-beta (IFN-beta) mRNA, which contains all the sequence of the natural molecule, is poorly translated in a reticulocyte lysate or when injected in Xenopus oocytes. This low level of translation is due to an inhibition by the 5' and 3' untranslated regions (UTRs). Indeed, the replacement of these sequences by those of Xenopus beta-globin mRNA dramatically increases the translational efficiency of the mRNA, especially in oocytes. This phenomenon is not due to a difference in mRNA stability since both native and chimeric mRNAs remain undegraded, at least during the translation period considered. Construction of different chimeric molecules having various combinations of 5' and 3' UTRs from IFN-beta or Xenopus beta-globin mRNA or a small sequence of SP6 polylinker as 5' UTR has revealed that the 3' UTR of IFN-beta in itself has a pronounced inhibitory effect on translation in the two translation systems from animal cells. Indeed, the addition of this 3' UTR at the 3' end of the coding region of a chicken lysozyme mRNA also causes a large decrease of its translational capacity in both systems. However, the nature of the 5' noncoding sequence influences the degree of translation inhibition exerted by the 3' UTR. Remarkably, we observed no difference in translation level when the different mRNAs were tested in a wheat germ extract.\r"

Nucleotide sequence analysis of one isolated clone, pMG377, reveals that the clone encodes a polypeptide that is homologous to, yet distinctly different from, type IX short-chain collagen polypeptides. The structure of the conceptual translation product of the cDNA is also different from that of all other collagen types. Therefore, we have given the type IX-like collagen chain encoded by pMG377 the designation alpha 1(XII). Ribonuclease protection assays with single-stranded cRNA probes demonstrate that alpha 1(XII) mRNA is present in several tissues such as calvaria, tendon, and sternal cartilage of 17-day-old chicken embryo and in cornea from 6-day-old embryos. Using pMG377 as the hybridization probe, we isolated a fragment of the corresponding gene from a chicken genomic library. Partial nucleotide sequence analysis of the genomic clone DG12 shows that the exon/intron structure of the alpha 1(XII) collagen gene appears to be homologous to that of the alpha 1(IX) and alpha 2(IX) collagen genes. Our data demonstrate that types IX and XII collagen are two homologous members of a family of unique collagenous proteins that show tissue-specific patterns of expression. Based on their structure and the properties of their genes, we conclude that this family of collagens is distinctly different from that of fibrillar collagens.\r"

When cell suspensions were incubated with purified phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C, most of the placental alkaline phosphatase was released from membranes in a hydrophilic form. On incubation of the cells with [14C]ethanolamine, [14C]myristic acid, or myo-[3H]inositol, each was incorporated into the phosphatase near the carboxyl terminus, showing that these components, which are found in other phosphatidylinositol membrane-linked proteins, are also present in placental alkaline phosphatase.\r"

Studies using monoclonal antibodies directed to these glycoproteins suggest that their molecular structures can vary with differentiation stages in the normal gland and in malignancy. To analyze the molecular nature of these glycoproteins, milk mucin was affinity-purified and deglycosylated with hydrogen fluoride, yielding bands at 68 and 72 kDa on silver-stained gels. Polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies to the stripped core protein were developed and used to screen a lambda gt11 expression library of cDNA made from mRNA of the mammary tumor cell line MCF-7. Seven cross-reacting clones were isolated, with inserts 0.1-1.8 kilobases long. RNA blot analysis, using as a probe the 1.8-kilobase insert subcloned in plasmid pUC8 (pMUC10), revealed transcripts of 4.7 and 6.4 kilobases in MCF-7 and T47D mammary tumor cells, whereas normal mammary epithelial cells from pooled milks have additional transcripts. The expression of mRNA correlates with antigen expression as determined by binding of two previously characterized anti-mucin monoclonal antibodies (HMFG-1 and HMFG-2) to seven cell lines. Restriction enzyme analysis detected a restriction fragment length polymorphism when human genomic DNA was digested with EcoRI or HinfI.\r"

Transformation of mouse 3T3 cells with murine sarcoma viruses results in marked decreases in the levels of gangliosides GM1 and GD1a and an increase in gangliotriaosylceramide. The transforming oncogenes of these viruses have been identified as members of the ras gene family. We analyzed NIH 3T3 cells transfected with human H-, K- and N-ras oncogenes for their glycolipid composition and expression of cell surface gangliosides. Using conventional thin-layer chromatographic analysis, we found that the level of GM3 was increased and that of GD1a was slightly decreased or unchanged, and GM1 was present but not in quantifiable levels. Cell surface levels of GM1 were determined by 125I-labeled cholera toxin binding to intact cells. GD1a was determined by cholera toxin binding to cells treated with sialidase prior to toxin binding. All ras-transfected cells had decreased levels of surface GM1 and GD1a as compared to logarithmically growing normal NIH 3T3 cells. Levels of GM1 and, to a lesser extent, GD1a increased as the latter cells became confluent. Using a monoclonal antibody assay, we found that gangliotriaosylceramide was present in all ras-transfected cells studied but not in logarithmically growing untransfected cells. Interestingly, gangliotriaosylceramide appeared when the latter cells became confluent. These results indicated that ras oncogenes derived from human tumors are capable of inducing alterations in glycolipid composition.\r"

However, plants with the N' gene, such as Nicotiana sylvestris and Nicotiana tabacum L. cv. Bright Yellow, respond differently to infections by these viruses. In the N' plants, TMV-OM (common strain) spreads systemically with mosaic symptoms, whereas TMV-L (tomato strain) induces the necrotic response of plants, causing local lesions. To reveal the viral factor of TMV-L inducing the necrotic response, we have constructed several recombinant viruses between the two strains, in which TMV-L RNA was partly replaced by TMV-OM RNA. The recombinant viruses having the coat protein gene sequence of TMV-OM in place of TMV-L produced no necrotic local lesions but spread systemically with mosaic symptoms in the N' plants. On the other hand, the recombinant viruses having TMV-OM-derived sequences other than the coat protein gene sequence, and in which the coat protein gene sequence of TMV-L still remained, produced necrotic local lesions. These observations indicate that the viral factor of TMV-L responsible for the necrotic response of the N' plants is coded in the coat protein gene sequence.\r"

We now report the amino acid sequence of approximately one-third of this protein and show that it has extensive homology with a newly defined family of Ca2+-binding proteins termed annexins. The partial sequence of the placental protein could be aligned with the sequence of either lipocortin I or calpactin I such that 49% and 58%, respectively, of the residues were identical. A comparison of the partial sequences of the placental protein with the partial sequence of bovine endonexin revealed 74% sequence identity. Based on this close relationship, the placental protein was named endonexin II. Equilibrium dialysis showed that endonexin II bound Ca2+ (Kd greater than 0.5 mM) and the affinity was increased by phosphatidylserine liposomes (kd approximately equal to 100 microM). In addition, endonexin II bound to phosphatidylserine- and phosphatidylethanolamine-containing liposomes in a Ca2+-dependent manner, and the binding was cooperative with respect to Ca2+ concentration (Hill constant greater than 3). The Ca2+- and phospholipid-binding properties of endonexin II raise the possibility that each of the four internally repeated sequences that have been demonstrated within this family of proteins contains a Ca2+-binding site.\r"

We find that at least 90% of the gamma-crystallins synthesized in the young human lens are the products of genes gamma G3 and gamma G4. We demonstrate that gamma G4-crystallin undergoes a temperature-dependent phase separation, and we have measured the low-concentration branch of its coexistence curve (phase separation temperature vs. concentration) up to about 40 mg/ml. By comparison, we found no evidence of gamma G3-crystallin phase separating, even at lower temperatures and higher concentrations. This is consistent with predictions based on sequence homology between human and rat gamma-crystallins. The implications of these findings for human inherited and senile cataracts are considered.\r"

A procedure is described for the isolation of a fraction enriched in these transition elements from rat liver. The isolated fraction generates small vesicles morphologically resembling transition vesicles when incubated with nucleoside triphosphate at 37 degrees C. In the cell-free system consisting of a donor fraction enriched in transition elements and an acceptor fraction consisting of intact Golgi apparatus immobilized on nitrocellulose strips, transfer in vitro of radiolabeled membranes was demonstrated. Nucleoside triphosphates were required for transfer, and transfer was facilitated by a cytosol fraction of Mr greater than 10,000. In the presence of both nucleoside triphosphate and cytosol, radiolabeled proteins were transferred in a manner dependent upon both time and temperature. Transfer appeared to be both vectorial and specific in that, with Golgi apparatus (or endoplasmic reticulum) as both donor and acceptor, only negligible time and temperature-dependent transfer was observed. The test system described is expected to facilitate further investigation of the transfer process and to provide a convenient assay to guide transition vesicle isolation and characterization.\r"

Upon photolysis at 314 nm, it is rapidly converted into the reactive nitrene, which efficiently attaches covalently to lipid-embedded domains of proteins and, to a lesser extent, to membrane phospholipids. Above 370 nm, Ina absorption is negligible and photolysis at these wavelengths does not occur. However, on addition of the photosensitizing molecule 3-aminopyrene, trifluoperazine, or 8-anilinonaphthalene-1-sulfonate, followed by irradiation at 380 nm, efficient conversion of Ina to reactive species was observed, as measured by [125I]Ina-labeling of membrane proteins and inactivation of the hormonal response of adenylate cyclase. Irradiation at 480 nm in the presence of a fluorescein derivative of n-undecylamine also resulted in a pattern of [125I]Ina-labeled membrane proteins and hormone uncoupling indistinguishable from that obtained following direct photolysis at 314 nm. Photosensitization of the azide molecules is confined to the vicinity of the photosensitizer chromophore. This allowed selective labeling of chromophore-bearing proteins in solution or in membranes. Bovine serum albumin-fluorescein conjugate, in the presence of nonderivatized soluble proteins, was exclusively labeled by [125I]Ina when irradiated at 480 nm, but random labeling occurred on photolysis at 314 nm. Likewise, rhodopsin in rod outer segment membranes from frog retina was exclusively labeled by [125I]Ina upon photosensitization at 380 nm. Random labeling again occurred on direct irradiation at 314 nm. The results suggest that selective labeling in complex biological systems may be achieved by photosensitized activation of azides.\r"

The levels of this factor remained unchanged after virus infection of human cells. Another study also identified a factor (EIIF) specific for this same promoter, but the activity of this second factor was shown to increase severalfold after virus infection. We now show that these dramatically different results, both based on gel shift assays on the same promoter, may be explained by variations in protocol details and actually identify two distinct factors. When synthetic DNA copolymers [poly(dI).poly(dC) or poly(dI-dC).poly(dI-dC)] are used as competitors in gel shift assays, a factor specific for DNA sequences between -82 and -66 can be identified, whereas when natural eukaryotic DNAs (salmon sperm or calf thymus) are used as competitors a different factor specific for DNA sequences between -69 and -33 can be identified. We have mapped the DNA-protein contact residues for the EIIF by analyzing a series of linker scan mutants in gel shift assays and methylation interference experiments. The EIIA-EF and EIIF bind to two distinct but adjacent sequences. Competition experiments indicate that these two activities are due to two different factors. Consistent with the earlier reports, the levels of one (EIIA-EF) do not change after virus infection of human cells, whereas the levels of the other (EIIF) are increased severalfold.\r"

The gene is 75 kilobases long and is split into 10 exons. The introns range in length from 85 bases to 26 kilobases. The sum of the total exons is 1.5 kilobases and occupies only 2% of the gene; this value being one of the lowest among genes heretofore reported. The first exon encodes most of the NH2-terminal presequence that functions as a mitochondrial targeting signal. Putative binding sites for the two substrates of the enzyme, carbamoyl phosphate and ornithine, are encoded by exons 3 and 9, respectively. A set of \"CAAT box\"- and \"ATA box\"-like sequences is present about 200 bases upstream from the 5' end of the mRNA. About 35 bases downstream from this set of putative promoter elements, an 11-nucleotide sequence around the 5' end of the mRNA reappears, as a direct repeat. This pair of direct repeats may play a role in pulling the cap site and the promoter elements together. Upstream and downstream from the 5' end of the mRNA there are several sequences that resemble the transcription factor Sp1 binding site, the enhancer core sequence, the consensus sequence for the glucocorticoid receptor binding sites, and the putative enhancer element of the antithrombin III gene, another gene that is expressed specifically in the liver.\r"

Molecular dynamics simulations of the tryptophan and heme motions in sperm whale myoglobin were used to calculate the fluorescence intensity and anisotropy decays. The side chains underwent both small rapid orientational fluctuations and large infrequent transitions between conformations. The predicted motions of the tryptophans and the heme produce large fluctuations in the instantaneous rate of energy transfer, but no stable conformations in which energy transfer is suppressed were found. The calculated fluorescence anisotropies exhibited a large subpicosecond decay, corresponding to nondiffusive side-chain motions. The calculations adequately predict the observed fluorescence decay curve for myoglobin and the total anisotropy decay at 16-ps time resolution. The subnanosecond decays of anisotropy for tryptophan-14 in tuna myoglobin are not reproduced by the calculation.\r"

The strands in each of the seven pairs are half-staggered, and from longitudinal views the polarity of each pair can be determined. The positions of the pairs and their polarities (three in one orientation; four in the opposite orientation) suggest a close relationship with the crystals of deoxyhemoglobin S composed of antiparallel pairs of half-staggered strands.\r"

In two cases, the stem-loop sequences were deleted from the mRNAs and replaced either by 3' sequences flanking the H3 gene or by globin 3' untranslated region sequences including the polyadenylylation signal. In the former case, approximately equal to 50% of the modified mRNA was polyadenylylated, whereas in the latter case all of the mRNA had a polyadenylylated terminus. In contrast to the normal histone mRNAs, these mRNAs, including the nonadenylylated form, were stable when DNA synthesis was inhibited with several drugs. The levels of two other histone mRNAs, each containing the stem-loop sequences as an internal part of the mRNA, also were stable when DNA synthesis was inhibited. These results indicate that the posttranscriptional coupling of histone mRNA levels to DNA synthesis requires the presence of the stem-loop sequences at the 3' end of the mRNA.\r"

The statistical distribution of stop codons allows examination of the probability of generating reading frames of approximately equal to 0.55 kb in this primordial polynucleotide. This analysis reveals that with three stop codons, a run of at least 0.55-kb equivalent length of nonstop codons would occur in 4.6% of 20-kb-long polynucleotide molecules. We attempt to estimate the total amount of noncoding sequences that would be present on the chromosomes of contemporary species assuming that present-day chromosomes retain the prototype primordial genome structure. Theoretical estimates thus obtained for most eukaryotes do not differ significantly from those reported for these specific organisms, with only a few exceptions. Furthermore, analysis of possible stop-codon distributions suggests that life on earth would not exist, at least in its present form, had two or four stop codons been selected early in evolution.\r"

As a base of reference, the additive variance sigma 2a in an infinite equilibrium population is used. sigma 2a increases as k increases and decreases with variation in the mutation rates. Both transitional and equilibrium values of the variance within populations could be expressed as sigma 2w = (1 - theta)sigma 2a, where theta is the coancestry with mutations of individuals within populations. Thus, rates of convergence and evolutionary times are a function of those for theta, which involves both N and u. When the founder population is fixed, very long times are required to obtain a perceptible increase in sigma 2w and equilibrium values of sigma 2w are very small when 4Nu less than or equal to 10(-1). The variance between populations can be expressed as sigma 2b = 2 theta sigma 2a when the founder population is an infinite equilibrium population, and as sigma 2b = 2(theta - alpha)sigma 2a when the founder population is fixed, where alpha is a function only of u. In this latter case, rates of divergence, while affected by both N and u, are dominated by u and asymptotically a function of u only. With u = 10(-5), very long times (10(3) generations) are required for any perceptible divergence, even for N = 1-10. At equilibrium, most of the variance is between small populations and within very large populations. Migration increases the variance within populations and decreases the variance between populations.\r"

  ".W": "In marsupials and eutherian mammals, X chromosome dosage compensation is achieved by inactivating one X chromosome in female cells; however, in marsupials, the inactive X chromosomes is always paternal, and some genes on the chromosome are partially expressed. To define the role of DNA methylation in maintenance of X chromosome inactivity, we examined loci for glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase and hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase in a North American marsupial, the opossum Didelphis virginiana, by using genomic hybridization probes cloned from this species. We find that these marsupial genes are like their eutherian counterparts, with respect to sex differences in methylation of nuclease-insensitive (nonregulatory) chromatin. However, with respect to methylation of the nuclease-hypersensitive (regulatory) chromatin of the glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase locus, the opossum gene differs from those of eutherians, as the 5' cluster of CpG dinucleotides is hypomethylated in the paternal as well as the maternal gene. Despite hypomethylation of the 5' CpG cluster, the paternal allele, identified by an enzyme variant, is at best partially expressed; therefore, factors other than methylation are responsible for repression. In light of these results, it seems that the role of DNA methylation in eutherian X dosage compensation is to \"lock in\" the process initiated by such factors. Because of similarities between dosage compensation in marsupials and trophectoderm derivatives of eutherians, we propose that differences in timing of developmental events--rather than differences in the basic mechanisms of X inactivation--account for features of dosage compensation that differ among mammals.\r"

  ".W": "The suppressor T-cell hybridoma 1556A2.1 can be induced by the monoclonal L-glutamic acid60-L-alanine30-L-tyrosine10 (GAT)-specific suppressor inducer 372B3.5 and soluble GAT to synthesize a disulfide-linked heterodimeric protein (GAT-TsF2), which directly suppresses a primary in vitro immune response to GAT. Induction and synthesis of the GAT-TsF2 protein is correlated with the appearance of specific mRNA, as detected by translation in vitro in a wheat germ cell-free extract of RNA isolated at various times after induction. The mRNA coding for the polypeptide chain that bears a serologically defined I-J determinant (I-J+ chain) appeared 8 hr after induction, whereas the mRNA coding for the antigen-binding chain (AB+ chain) was not detected until 16 hr after induction. The mRNAs coding for the individual chains sedimented as different species, suggesting that the two-chain factor is the product of two genes. The AB+ chain of the 1556A2.1 GAT-TsF2 was synthesized on membrane-bound polysomes, whereas the I-J+ chain was translated on free polysomes. The AB+ chain was synthesized from two independent mRNA species sedimenting at 10 S and 28 S, whereas a single 16S mRNA encoded the I-J+ chain. The in vitro translated I-J+ chain was bound by a monoclonal antibody against the I-J+ determinant of only the appropriate H-2 haplotype. These results suggest that posttranslational modification, including glycosylation, is not required for biological activity or for expression of the I-J epitope on the GAT-TsF2 molecule.\r"

Two expressed loci were identified in the haplotypes DR2, -3, -4, -7, and -9; one locus being present at a much lower frequency (4-7%) than the other. The low-frequency allele was highly conserved between each of the DRw53 (DR4, -7, -9) and the DRw52 (DR3, -5, -6) haplotypes. Analysis of the variation between alleles confirms the presence of three allelic hypervariable regions. At each variable residue, a limited range of amino acid substitutions are found, distinguishing them from immunoglobulin hypervariable regions. Dinucleotide substitutions are extremely common. Individual hypervariable regions are often shared between haplotypes. Much of the variation in these alleles can be attributed to the shuffling of these regions between haplotypes, possibly by the mechanism of gene conversion.\r"

  ".W": "We studied the effect of 17 beta-estradiol (E) on the proliferation and alkaline phosphatase activity of cultured UMR106 cells, a clonal osteoblastic cell line. Growth rates were reduced and alkaline phosphatase activity was increased in cells incubated for 2 days in medium containing E (10(-8) M). In contrast, E had no effect on the growth rates or alkaline phosphatase of a human fibroblastic cell line, S90E. The effect of E was not observed with low cell density or at confluence. 1,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D3 antagonized the response to E. Preincubation of the cells with dexamethasone, a potent inducer of differentiation, reversed the effect of E or 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3. These results indicate that cellular and/or extracellular factors such as cell density, the phase of the cell cycle, the state of differentiation, and the presence or absence of other steroids influenced the response of UMR106 cells to E. Serum was removed from the culture medium to minimize the effect of the steroids, growth factors, and nutrients present in serum. A striking stimulation of alkaline phosphatase by E occurred with serum-free conditions. This stimulation was biphasic over an E concentration from 10(-12) to 10(-8) M, with the peak response at 10(-10) M. The action of E on UMR106 cells was metabolite-specific, since the isomer 17 alpha-estradiol produced no effect on proliferation rates or alkaline phosphatase activity. The cyclic AMP response to parathyroid hormone (residues 1-34) was not altered by E treatment of these cells. In contrast, dexamethasone exposure did increase the cyclic AMP response to parathyroid hormone. These results demonstrate a direct effect of E on an osteoblastic cell line. They also raise the possibility that similar or identical actions of E occur in cultured normal osteoblasts.\r"

Because of the high degree of nucleic acid sequence homology among the numerous enteroviral serotypes, including the group A and B coxsackieviruses and the echoviruses, detection of these various agents commonly implicated in human viral heart disease is possible in a single hybridization assay. We demonstrate the considerable potential of this method for an unequivocal diagnosis of enteroviral heart disease as well as for pathogenicity studies. Using athymic mice persistently infected with coxsackievirus B3 as a model system, we show that the myocardium is affected in a disseminated, multifocal manner.\r"

  ".W": "At equilibrium, voltage-sensitive sodium channels normally are closed at all potentials. They open transiently in response to changes in membrane voltage or chronically under the influence of certain neurotoxins. Covalent modifications that result in chronic opening may help identify molecular domains involved in conductance regulation. Here, the purified sodium channel from electric eel electroplax, reconstituted in artificial liposomes, has been used to screen for such modifications. When the liposomes were treated with the alkaloid neurotoxin batrachotoxin, sodium-selective ion fluxes were produced, with permeability ratios PNa greater than PTl greater than PK greater than PRb greater than PCs. When the liposomes were treated with either of two oxidizing reagents (N-bromoacetamide or N-bromosuccinimide), or with Pronase or trypsin, ion-selective fluxes also were stimulated. These were blocked by tetrodotoxin and the anesthetic QX-314 in a manner suggesting that only modification of the cytoplasmic protein surface resulted in stimulation. Limited exposure to trypsin resulted in strong flux activation, with the concomitant appearance of peptide fragments with masses of approximately equal to 130, 70, and 38 kDa and fragments with masses of 45 and 24 kDa appearing later. We propose that characterization of these fragments may allow identification of channel domains important for inactivation gating.\r"

  ".W": "The cervical spinal cords of 23-day-old myelin-deficient (md) rats, an X chromosome-linked myelin mutant, and their normal littermates were studied by light and electron microscopy, immunocytochemistry, and in situ hybridization. Light microscopy showed that there were scattered myelinated fibers in the md rat, particularly in the lateral and ventral columns. Ultrastructural examination of these fibers showed that the myelin often had many lamellae that were tightly compacted, but in which the intraperiod line was abnormally fused at most places, resulting in a minor alteration of the myelin periodicity. Immunocytochemical staining of adjacent sections following a variety of fixation methods showed that the myelinated fibers were positive for myelin basic protein but negative for proteolipid protein (PLP). In situ hybridization using cDNA probes to these proteins showed a severe diminution of the mRNAs for both proteins. These findings provide further support for an abnormality in genetic regulation of PLP as has been described in another X chromosome-linked mutant, the jimpy mouse. Despite the lack of PLP, however, a few myelinated fibers are formed in the md rat, but the myelin formed in general lacks a normal intraperiod line, a site at which this protein is thought to be located.\r"

Three components of the outward current could be identified by their gating and kinetics: a calcium-dependent potassium current [IK(Ca)], a voltage-dependent potassium current [IK(V)], and a transient potassium current (Ia). Typical resting potentials were near -54 mV, and typical input resistance was 3-6 G omega. Thus, only 3 pA of injected current was required to depolarize the cell to spike threshold near -45 mV. The response to a current step consisted of either a single spike regardless of stimulus strength, or a train of less than 8 spikes, decrementing in amplitude and frequency over approximately equal to 250 msec. Thus, the receptor response cannot be finely graded with stimulus intensity.\r"

  ".W": "Postsynaptic membranes isolated from Torpedo electric organ are highly enriched in the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor and a nonreceptor protein of 43 kDa; the distribution of the 43-kDa protein and the receptor is coextensive in the electrical membrane. As a first step in understanding the regulation of 43-kDa protein expression, we have isolated and characterized 43-kDa protein cDNAs. A lambda gt11 cDNA library was constructed from Torpedo californica electric organ mRNA and screened with a pool of 26-mer oligonucleotides encoding a short tryptic fragment of the 43-kDa synaptic protein. Positive clones were purified and sequenced; the amino acid sequences were deduced, and they matched chemically determined protein sequences of the 43-kDa protein. Two distinct classes of cDNAs were obtained; one class encoded a 43-kDa protein of 389 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 43,988 daltons, and another class encoded a second 43-kDa protein containing 23 additional amino acids at the C terminus. Therefore, it appears that two 43-kDa proteins with different carboxyl termini are encoded by separate mRNAs. Consistent with this idea, blot hybridization analysis revealed multiple polyadenylylated 43-kDa mRNAs in electric organ. One polyadenylylated mRNA of approximately equal to 2.0 kilobases in length was apparent in both embryonic day-11 chick muscle and the mouse muscle cell line BC3H1.\r"

  ".W": "Release of the neuropeptide egg-laying hormone (ELH) from Aplysia bag cell neurons augments the endogenous bursting pacemaker activity of neuron R15. We have studied the ionic mechanisms underlying the effect of ELH in voltage-clamped R15 neurons. Both electrical discharge of the bag cells, which releases endogenous ELH, and application of synthetic ELH on cell R15 result in an increase in two discrete ionic currents. One of these currents activates with hyperpolarization, reverses near the K+ equilibrium potential, is sensitive to the external K+ concentration, and is blocked by addition of 5 mM Rb+ or 1 mM Ba2+ to the bathing medium. This current appears to be identical to the inwardly rectifying K+ current IR. The other current activates with depolarization and is blocked by replacement of external Ca2+ with Co2+ or Mn2+. This current appears to be a voltage-gated Ca2+ current ICa. Both ICa and IR in R15 have previously been shown to be enhanced by the neurotransmitter serotonin, acting via intracellular cyclic AMP. We now report that increasing cyclic AMP in R15, by applying either serotonin or the adenylate cyclase activator forskolin together with a phosphodiesterase inhibitor, mimics and occludes the action of ELH on neuron R15. Furthermore, application of ELH increases the cyclic AMP content of single R15 neurons, as measured by radioimmunoassay. Finally, the effects of ELH are potentiated by a phosphodiesterase inhibitor. These results suggest that ELH augments bursting activity in R15 by causing cyclic AMP-mediated increases in IR and ICa.\r"

Lower, but detectable levels were present in cerebral cortex, hypothalamus, thalamus, midbrain, and cerebellum. In the medulla/pons and spinal cord, the levels of receptor mRNA were in a range comparable to that detected in the liver. The levels of receptor mRNA in whole brain were constant from 3 days of age to adulthood and, thus, did not vary in proportion to the rate of myelin synthesis. LDL receptor mRNA in the CNS was produced by the same gene that produced the liver and adrenal mRNA as revealed by the demonstration of a deletion in the neural mRNA of Watanabe-heritable hyperlipidemic (WHHL) rabbits identical to the deletion in the LDL receptor gene of these mutant animals. Using antibodies directed against the bovine LDL receptor, we showed that LDL receptor protein is present in the medulla/pons of adult cows. The cell types that express LDL receptors in the CNS and the functions of these receptors are unknown.\r"

We prepared DNA for transfection of NIH 3T3 cells from primary glial tumors of the brain and from schwannomas of the cranial and spinal nerves that developed in the transplacentally exposed offspring between 20 and 40 weeks after birth. DNA preparations from 6 of 13 schwannomas, but not from normal liver, kidney, or intestine of tumor-bearing rats, transformed NIH 3T3 cells. NIH 3T3 clones transformed by schwannoma DNA contained rat repetitive DNA sequences, and all isolates contained rat neu oncogene sequences. One schwannoma yielded a transformant with rat-specific sequences for both neu and N-ras. A point mutation in the transmembrane region of the putative protein product of neu was identified in all six transformants and in the primary tumors from which they were derived as well as in 5 of 6 schwannomas tested that did not transform NIH 3T3 cells. Of 59 gliomas, only one yielded transforming DNA, and an activated N-ras oncogene was identified. The normal cellular neu sequence for the transmembrane region, but not the mutated sequence, was identified in DNA from all 11 gliomas surveyed by oligonucleotide hybridization. Activation of the neu oncogene, originally identified [Schechter, A.L., Stern, D.F., Vaidyanathan, L., Decker, S.J., Drebin, J.A., Greene, M.I. & Weinberg, R.A.

A probe specific to the brain cDNA 5' untranslated region hybridizes to a 6.0-kilobase transcript present in placenta, hypothalamus, adrenal gland, kidney, Wilms tumor, and a pheochromocytoma. The 5' untranslated sequence of the brain cDNA does not hybridize to a 5.3-kilobase transcript found in liver or to a 5.0-kb transcript found in pheochromocytoma.

The gene that encodes the human ferritin heavy chain has been transfected into mouse fibroblasts. Stable transformants that express the human ferritin heavy chain have been isolated. This protein assembles into ferritin polymers and can co-assemble with host mouse ferritin. Biosynthetic rates of the expressed human ferritin varied over a wide range in response to perturbations in iron supply, but total and cytoplasmic messenger RNA levels remained unchanged. When changes in ferritin mRNA levels were induced by treatment with sodium butyrate, proportional changes in the biosynthetic rates of ferritin were observed, but the capacity for modulating biosynthesis in response to alterations in iron availability was preserved. These findings suggest that the final protein biosynthetic rate of a translationally regulated gene depends on both translational regulatory signals and underlying transcription rates.\r"

The cDNA has a very high G+C content. EC-SOD is synthesized with a putative 18-amino acid signal peptide, preceding the 222 amino acids in the mature enzyme, indicating that the enzyme is a secretory protein. The first 95 amino acids of the mature enzyme show no sequence homology with other sequenced proteins and there is one possible N-glycosylation site (Asn-89). The amino acid sequence from residues 96-193 shows strong homology (approximately 50%) with the final two-thirds of the sequences of all known eukaryotic CuZn SODs, whereas the homology with the P. leiognathi CuZn SOD is clearly lower. The ligands to Cu and Zn, the cysteines forming the intrasubunit disulfide bridge in the CuZn SODs, and the arginine found in all CuZn SODs in the entrance to the active site can all be identified in EC-SOD. A comparison with bovine CuZn SOD, the three-dimensional structure of which is known, reveals that the homologies occur in the active site and the divergences are in the part constituting the subunit contact area in CuZn SOD. Amino acid sequence 194-222 in the carboxyl-terminal end of EC-SOD is strongly hydrophilic and contains nine amino acids with a positive charge. This sequence probably confers the affinity of EC-SOD for heparin and heparan sulfate. An analysis of the amino acid sequence homologies with CuZn SODs from various species indicates that the EC-SODs may have evolved from the CuZn SODs before the evolution of fungi and plants.\r"

  ".W": "Human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) is a member of a family of heterodimeric glycoprotein hormones that have a common alpha subunit but differ in their hormone-specific beta subunits. The beta subunit of hCG (hCG beta) is unique among the beta subunits in that it contains four mucin-like O-linked oligosaccharides attached to a carboxyl-terminal extension. To study the effects of O-glycosylation on the secretion and assembly of hCG, expression vectors containing either the hCG beta gene alone or together with the hCG alpha gene were transfected into a mutant Chinese hamster ovary cell line, IdID, which exhibits a reversible defect in O-glycosylation. Our results reveal that hCG beta can be secreted normally in the absence of its O-linked oligosaccharides. hCG beta devoid of O-linked carbohydrate can also combine efficiently with hCG alpha and be secreted as an intact dimer. We conclude that in Chinese hamster ovary cells, the hCG beta O-linked chains play no role in the assembly and secretion of hCG. The normal and O-linked oligosaccharide-deficient forms of hCG secreted by these cells should prove useful in examining the role of O-linked chains on the biological function of hCG.\r"

  ".W": "Extracts from unfertilized sea urchin eggs contain an inhibitor of translation that inhibits protein synthesis in cell-free translation systems from sea urchin embryos or rabbit reticulocytes. The inhibitory effects of egg extracts can be reversed by the addition of mammalian eukaryotic initiation factor 4F (eIF-4F) in both sea urchin embryo and reticulocyte systems, suggesting that the inhibitor inactivates this initiation factor. The accumulated data suggest that the ability of eIF-4F to recycle may be compromised. The addition of eIF-4F to cell-free translation systems from unfertilized sea urchin eggs also stimulates protein synthesis. However, the stimulation does not increase protein synthetic activity in the egg cell-free translation system to the levels observed in those produced from 2-hr embryos. This suggests that, although the unfertilized egg contains an inhibitor of eIF-4F and reduced levels of eIF-4F activity, inactivation of this component is only one of the factors involved in the low rate of maternal mRNA utilization found prior to fertilization.\r"

The mechanism of action of the tat gene product appears to be bimodal, resulting in both an increase in the steady-state level of viral mRNA and the enhanced translation of that RNA. In this report we have examined the mechanism by which tat elevates viral mRNA levels. Data are presented demonstrating that tat acts by increasing the rate of viral transcription, rather than by modulating the stability of viral mRNA. Indirect immunofluorescence was used to show that tat is predominantly localized in the nucleus of expressing cells, a location consistent with a role in the regulation of viral transcription. These results suggest that tat could play a role in human immunodeficiency virus replication essentially similar to that proposed for the trans-acting nuclear gene products described for several other virus species.\r"

Medium change after the activation showed that L-arginine was the only amino acid essential for this synthesis. D-Arginine would not substitute for L-arginine. Other analogues that could replace L-arginine were L-homoarginine, L-arginine methyl ester, L-arginamide, and the peptide L-arginyl-L-aspartate. L-Argininic acid, L-agmatine, L-ornithine, urea, L-citrulline, and ammonia were among the nonprecursors, while L-canavanine inhibited this L-arginine-derived NO2-/NO3- synthesis. When morpholine was added to the culture medium of the activated RAW 264.7 macrophages, N-nitrosation took place, generating N-nitrosomorpholine. GC/MS experiments using L-[guanido-15N2]arginine established that the NO2-/NO3- and the nitrosyl group of N-nitrosomorpholine were derived exclusively from one or both of the terminal guanido nitrogens of arginine. Chromatographic analysis showed that the other product of the L-arginine synthesis of NO2-/NO3- was L-citrulline. The role of the respiratory burst in NO2-/NO3- synthesis was examined using the macrophage cell lines J774.16 and J774 C3C. Both cell lines synthesized similar amounts of NO2-/NO3-. However, J774 C3C cells do not produce superoxide and hence do not exhibit the respiratory burst. Additional experiments also ruled out the involvement of the respiratory burst in NO2-/NO3- synthesis.\r"

  ".W": "We have investigated the possible role of a cAMP-mediated protein-phosphorylation event(s) as the key regulatory mechanism in beta-adrenoreceptor-stimulated activation of mannosylphosphodolichol (Man-P-Dol) synthase (GDP-mannose:dolichyl-phosphate O-beta-D-mannosyltransferase, EC 2.4.1.83) in rat parotid acinar cells. Microsomal membranes isolated from these cells pretreated with 10 microM isoproterenol for 60 min showed approximately 40-80% enhanced Man-P-Dol synthase activity compared to the untreated controls. This change in enzyme activity was not associated with a significant alteration in apparent Km for GDP-mannose, but the Vmax was enhanced 2-fold. When microsomal membranes isolated from control cells were phosphorylated in vitro by a cAMP-dependent protein kinase, an increase in Man-P-Dol synthase activity, similar to that with membranes from isoproterenol-treated cells, was observed (i.e., a moderate change in Km for GDP-mannose but a 2-fold higher Vmax). Furthermore, treatment of in vitro phosphorylated microsomal membranes by alkaline phosphatase led to a substantial reduction in Man-P-Dol synthase activity. Increased Man-P-Dol synthesis (approximately 30-40%) was also observed in bovine brain and hen oviduct microsomal membranes after in vitro protein phosphorylation. In aggregate, these results strongly suggest that agents that increase cAMP in cells may modulate protein N-glycosylation in those cells by activating this key glycosyltransferase of the dolichol cascade by a cAMP-dependent protein kinase-mediated protein phosphorylation/dephosphorylation cycle.\r"

  ".W": "A human gene encoding an interferon-induced 15-kDa protein has been isolated from a genomic library. The gene appears to be single-copy and is composed of two exons, the first of which contains the ATG translation initiation codon. In vitro nuclear run-on assays showed that the transcription rate of the gene is stimulated after interferon treatment. To analyze transcriptional regulatory sequences, we constructed recombinant plasmids for use in transient transfection assays of HeLa cells. Constructs containing 115 nucleotides 5' to the transcription initiation site were found to be fully inducible by interferon. Assays of deletion mutants identified a critical element for interferon induction located between -115 and -96, just upstream of the \"CCAAT box.\" Moreover, a DNA fragment including this region can confer interferon inducibility on a heterologous promoter (thymidine kinase) when cloned in either orientation upstream of the gene or downstream of the gene. These are properties characteristic of an enhancer element that is active only after treatment with interferon. This regulatory sequence may be shared by a group of interferon-induced genes, since a very similar sequence is present within the functional region near the RNA start site of another interferon-induced gene.\r"

Further analysis of the transcripts formed with a series of templates containing 16 related synthetic oligonucleotides established the minimum functional termination signal as TTTTTNT, in which N represents any nucleotide. Termination efficiency may be increased, however, by the presence of an adenosine preceding the thymidine cluster.

It consists mainly of four antiparallel alpha-helices arranged in a left twisted helical bundle, a structural motif observed in a number of other unrelated proteins. However, the way the four helices are connected in the bundle is unusual and, to our knowledge, has never been reported before. Alignment of the amino acid sequence of MPS with that of other growth hormones reveals that residues within the alpha-helices are predominantly invariant and thus these invariant residues are necessary to maintain the structural integrity of these proteins.\r"

The objective of this study was to determine the mechanism(s) of H+/OH- conductance and permeability through planar phospholipid bilayer membranes. Membranes were formed from decane solutions of bacterial phosphatidylethanolamine, diphytanoyl phosphatidylcholine, or egg phosphatidylcholine plus cholesterol. At pH 7, H+/OH- conductance (GH/OH) ranged from 2 to 6 nS.cm-2, corresponding to H+/OH- \"net\" permeabilities of (0.4-1.6) X 10(-5) cm.sec-1. GH/OH was inhibited by serum albumin (fatty acid-free), phloretin, and low pH. GH/OH was increased by chlorodecane, long-chain fatty acids, and voltages greater than 80 mV. Water permeability and GH/OH were not correlated. The results suggest that the H+/OH- charge carrier (i) is primarily anionic, (ii) crosses the membrane via nonpolar pathway(s), and (iii) can be removed from the membrane by \"washing\" with serum albumin. The simplest explanation is that the phospholipids contain weakly acidic contaminants that act as proton carriers at neutral pH. However, at low pH or in the presence of inhibitors, a \"background\" GH/OH remains that may be due to other mechanisms.\r"

Immunofluorescence localization of the antigen recognized by mAb CHON211 revealed a punctate pattern restricted to the nuclear envelope; this pattern changed dramatically during the cell cycle. When examined by electron microscopy, the antigen was largely restricted to the nucleoplasmic and cytoplasmic faces of the nuclear pore complex. Immunoblots showed that mAb CHON211 bound to a series of polypeptides enriched in the nuclear envelope fraction with apparent molecular masses ranging from 110 to 35 kDa. Using galactosyltransferase and the lectin wheat germ agglutinin as probes, we have previously shown that proteins bearing O-linked N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) are restricted to the cytoplasmic and nucleoplasmic faces of the nuclear pore complex. The nuclear membrane proteins recognized by mAb CHON211 had properties very similar to those identified by galactosyltransferase and wheat germ agglutinin labeling. Removal of O-linked GlcNAc residues with beta-hexosaminidase greatly reduced the binding of mAb CHON211, strongly suggesting that O-linked GlcNAc moieties are part of the immunodeterminant. This monoclonal antibody defines a new family of antigens that are restricted to the nuclear pore and bear a common modification: O-linked GlcNAc. mAb CHON211 will be useful for defining the role of the nucleoporins in nucleo-cytoplasmic exchange.\r"

The ciliary action potential was correlated with intracellularly recorded action potentials, selectively blocked by Ca2+-channel antagonists, and correlated with ciliary reorientation and reversed beating. Dual-electrode recording from different sites on the same comb plate showed that, unlike protistan cilia, the approximately 1-mm-long cilia of comb plates are not isopotential. Rather, action potentials are generated 150-200 microns from the base and propagate to the tip of the cilia. These results indicate that voltage-dependent channels that mediate increases in intraciliary Ca2+ concentration are distributed over most of the length of the cilia. Consequently, the Ca2+-sensitive machinery controlling ciliary motor responses is also likely to be located along the length of the axoneme.\r"

We have detected another erythroid-inducing factor in cell-free extracts from dimethyl sulfoxide- or hexamethylenebis(acetamide)-treated MEL cells, which acts synergistically with DIF-I. The partially purified factor (termed DIF-II) triggered erythroid differentiation when introduced into undifferentiated MEL cells that had been potentiated by the induction of DIF-I. The activity in the extracts appeared in an inducible manner after addition of dimethyl sulfoxide or hexamethylenebis(acetamide), reached a maximum at 6 hr, and then rapidly decreased. The induction was inhibited by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate and also by cycloheximide. No induction was observed in a mutant MEL cell line defective in erythroid differentiation. These characteristics are consistent with the supposition that DIF-II is one of the putative dimethyl sulfoxide-inducible factors detected in previously reported cell-fusion and cytoplast-fusion experiments. The role of DIF-II in MEL-cell differentiation and in vitro differentiation in general is discussed.\r"

The presence of introns within eukaryotic genes is thought to enhance such exchanges. Yet domain exchanges must necessarily be the secondarily developed process in evolution, for they would have been effective only after multitudes of domains came into being. Many of the proteins with functionally divergent domains were established before the division of prokaryotes from eukaryotes; i.e., soon after the creation of life on this earth. I attribute the extreme innovativeness of early coding sequences to their construction; i.e., being repeats of oligomeric units. The rhodopsin family of proteins--with seven hydrophobic, alpha-helical transmembrane domains, four extracellular domains, and four intracytoplasmic domains--indeed arose before the division of prokaryotes from eukaryotes and later gave rise to muscarinic acetylcholine receptor and beta-adrenergic receptor among others. In this paper, I show that the entire coding sequence for porcine muscarinic acetylcholine receptor is still replete with copies of three heptameric units that are very closely related to each other. Original heptameric units are more stringently conserved in parts encoding the seven transmembrane domains, whereas new repeating units are comingled with the old in parts encoding extracellular and intracytoplasmic domains.\r"

  ".W": "Choroideremia, an X-chromosome linked retinal dystrophy of unknown pathogenesis, causes progressive nightblindness and eventual central blindness in affected males by the third to fourth decade of life. Choroideremia has been mapped to Xq13-21 by tight linkage to restriction fragment length polymorphism loci. We have recently identified two families in which choroideremia is inherited with mental retardation and deafness. In family XL-62, an interstitial deletion in Xq21 is visible by cytogenetic analysis and two linked anonymous DNA markers, DXYS1 and DXS72, are deleted. In the second family, XL-45, an interstitial deletion was suspected on phenotypic grounds but could not be confirmed by high-resolution cytogenetic analysis. We used phenol-enhanced reassociation of 48,XXXX DNA in competition with excess XL-45 DNA to generate a library of cloned DNA enriched for sequences that might be deleted in XL-45. Two of the first 83 sequences characterized from the library were found to be deleted in probands from family XL-45 as well as from family XL-62. Isolation of these sequences proves that XL-45 does contain a submicroscopic deletion and provides a starting point for identifying overlapping genomic sequences that span the XL-45 deletion. Each overlapping sequence will be studied to identify exons from the choroideremia locus.\r"

DNA sequence analysis suggests that the 4F2 heavy-chain cDNAs encode an approximately 526-amino acid type II membrane glycoprotein, which is composed of a large C-terminal extracellular domain, a single potential transmembrane region, and a 50-81 amino acid N-terminal intracytoplasmic domain.

In contrast the DQ alpha and DR beta probes failed to identify disease-specific restriction fragment length polymorphism fragments. These studies indicate that DQw1 and DQw3 polymorphisms carried by pemphigus vulgaris patients may be directly involved in predisposition to the disease or may be tightly linked to the susceptibility gene itself. To our knowledge, this is the first example of an HLA restriction fragment length polymorphism that is highly associated with susceptibility to autoimmune disease.\r"

However, in the presence of Triton X-100, the soluble FBP eluted from a Sephadex G-150 column with an apparent Mr of approximately 40,000 (similar to NaDodSO4/PAGE) but the membrane-associated FBP eluted with an apparent Mr of approximately 160,000, indicating that this species contains a hydrophobic domain that interacts with the detergent micelles. The amino acid compositions of both forms of FBP were similar, especially with respect to the apolar amino acids. In addition, the 18 amino acids at the amino termini of both proteins were identical. The membrane FBP, following delipidation with chloroform/methanol, contained 7.1 mol of fatty acid per mol of protein, of which 4.7 mol was amide-linked and 2.4 mol was ester-linked. The soluble FBP contained only 0.05 mol of fatty acid per mol of protein.

  ".W": "Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) is a polypeptide cytokine that is cytotoxic to some but not all tumor cells. The basis for resistance to the cytotoxic effects of this agent remains unclear. We have studied the development of TNF resistance in human ZR-75-1 breast carcinoma cells. ZR-75-1 cells have undetectable levels of TNF RNA and protein. However, TNF transcripts are transiently induced in these cells by exposure to recombinant human TNF. This induction of TNF RNA is associated with production of TNF-like protein in cell lysates and culture supernatants. Stable resistance to TNF-induced cytotoxicity develops when ZR-75-1 cells are exposed to increased concentrations of TNF. The TNF-resistant cells, designated ZR-75-1R, continuously express TNF transcripts and a TNF-like protein. Furthermore, ZR-75-1R cell supernatants contain cytotoxic activity that is abrogated by polyclonal antibody against TNF. The ZR-75-1R cells also possess TNF receptors that are occupied or down-regulated by the TNF-like protein. These findings thus suggest that (i) TNF induces TNF transcripts and production of a TNF-like protein in ZR-75-1 cells and (ii) resistance to TNF-induced cytotoxicity is associated with stable TNF expression.\r"

We have obtained a series of recombinant viruses using neutralizing monoclonal antibodies in conjunction with temperature-sensitive markers. All of the recombinants obtained have a crossover within gene C, which encodes the peplomer protein of the virus. The genetic structure of these recombinants suggests that the antigenic regions recognized by these neutralizing monoclonal antibodies are localized on the carboxyl-terminal one-third of the peplomer protein. Since the two monoclonal antibodies used are also associated with the critical determinants of virus neuropathogenicity, we conclude that both the neutralizing antibody binding sites and determinants of pathogenicity are localized at the carboxyl-terminal one-third of the peplomer. The variation of crossover sites in different recombinant viruses also allowed precise mapping of additional antigenic sites. RNA recombination thus presents a powerful genetic tool, and the carboxyl-terminal localization of the biological functions of peplomers suggests a distinct conformation of these viral membrane proteins.\r"

These concentrations of permeant ions were low enough to avoid contamination by macroscopic inward currents through calcium channels. Calcium-dependent potassium currents were reduced by 1 microM tetraethylammonium. These currents can also be activated by barium or strontium. Barium as well as calcium activated outward currents in young neurons (6-8 hr) and in relatively mature neurons (19-26 hr in vitro). However, barium influx appeared to suppress the sustained voltage-dependent potassium current in most cells. Barium also activated at least one class of potassium channels observed in excised membrane patches, while blocking others. The blocking action may have masked and hindered detection of the stimulatory action of barium in other systems.\r"

Under basal conditions, the nicotinic AcChoR was shown to be phosphorylated in situ on the beta and delta subunits. Regulation of AcChoR phosphorylation by cAMP-dependent protein kinase was explored by the addition of forskolin or cAMP analogues to prelabeled cell cultures. Forskolin, an activator of adenylate cyclase, stimulated the phosphorylation of the delta subunit 20-fold over basal phosphorylation and induced phosphorylation of the alpha subunit. The effect of forskolin was dose dependent with a half-maximal response at 8 microM in the presence of 35 microM Ro 20-1724, a phosphodiesterase inhibitor. Stimulation of delta subunit phosphorylation was almost maximal within 5 min, whereas stimulation of alpha subunit phosphorylation was not maximal until 45 min after forskolin treatment. Stimulation of AcChoR phosphorylation by 8-benzylthioadenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate was identical to that obtained by forskolin. Two-dimensional thermolytic phosphopeptide maps of the delta subunit revealed a single major phosphopeptide. These results correlate closely with the observed effects of forskolin on AcChoR desensitization in muscle and suggest that cAMP-dependent phosphorylation of the delta subunit increases the rate of AcChoR desensitization in rat myotubes.\r"

Two different methods were used: single-neuron receptive-field (RF) mapping in unanesthetized cats (maximal RF) and multiunit RF mapping in deeply anesthetized cats (minimal RF). Ten or more maximal RFs were sampled in each of 14 near-radial microelectrode penetrations. In 6 penetrations, the maximal RFs of all sampled neurons (despite prominent variations in RF size and shape) shared in common a small skin area--termed the \"RF center.\" Each of the remaining penetrations had to be divided into at least two segments (6 penetrations) or three segments (2 penetrations), for all maximal RFs mapped in a segment to include a common skin site. In six penetrations, after maximal RFs were mapped, deep general anesthesia was induced and minimal RFs were mapped in the same penetration at cortical sites separated by 150 microns. Minimal RFs closely matched the RF centers defined by maximal RFs in the same penetration. In penetrations that mapped two or three RF centers, a rapid transition in minimal RF position was detected at the same cortical site where the shift in RF center was detected. Closely spaced penetrations revealed discrete cortical columns, having the size and shape of 350- to 400-microns-diameter irregular hexagons, such that the identical minimal RF was mapped at any site within a column. The forelimb body surface in cat 3b thus appears to be represented by a mosaic of discrete columns--an organization similar to the whisker representation in rodent primary somatosensory cortex.\r"

One of the viral genes encodes a protein (tat) that not only results in transactivation of viral gene expression but may also regulate the expression of certain cellular genes that are important for cell growth. Transgenic mice that expressed the authentic tat protein under the control of the HTLV-1 long terminal repeat were generated, and cell types that are permissive for the viral promoter and the effects of the tat gene on these cells were studied. Three of eight founder mice with high levels of expression of the transgene in muscle were bred and then analyzed. All developed soft tissue tumors at multiple sites between 13 to 17 weeks of age. This phenotype was transmitted to nine of nine offspring that inherited the tat gene and were available for analysis. The remaining five founders expressed the transgene in the thymus, as well as in muscle. This second group of mice all exhibited extensive thymic depletion and growth retardation; in all of these mice, death occurred between 3 to 6 weeks of age before tumors became macroscopically visible. The tat gene under the control of the HTLV-1 regulatory region showed tissue-specific expression and the tat protein efficiently induced mesenchymal tumors. The data establish tat as an oncogenic protein and HTLV-1 as a transforming virus.\r"

An increase in maximum wound strength of 220 percent of control was observed at 5 days; the healing rate was accelerated by approximately 3 days for at least 14 days after production of the wound and application of TGF-beta. These increases in wound strength were accompanied by an increased influx of mononuclear cells and fibroblasts and by marked increases in collagen deposition at the site of application of TGF-beta. TGF-beta is thus a potent pharmacologic agent that can accelerate wound healing in rats.\r"

Since conventional linkage programs consider only disomic individuals, we have written a FORTRAN computer program, DSLINK, that performs gene-centromere linkage analysis on the basis of information on trisomic and disomic offspring. This program makes it possible to study the relationship between recombination and chromosome segregation.\r"

Arterial blood gas measurements showed frequent changes from baseline with alterations in PCO2 (greater than 10 torr) or pH (greater than 0.05) occurring on 14 occasions. In a subsequent study, 16 patients received ventilation during transit with the aid of a portable mechanical ventilator. Although 6 patients showed changes in arterial blood gas values, mean changes in PCO2 and pH were significantly less than in the group that received manual ventilatory support. (p less than 0.01). Hemodynamic complications of hypotension and cardiac arrhythmia showed a significant correlation with disturbances in arterial blood gases (p less than 0.05). Although limited by the lack of a control period, this study shows that the transport of critically ill patients may result in severe hemodynamic complications; it also suggests that these complications might be prevented by more careful monitoring of ventilation.\r"

Setting: Tertiary care center at a university hospital. Patients: A consecutive collection of four patients with advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the skin who failed to respond to standard surgical or radiation therapy. Interventions: Isotretinoin in gelatin capsules was given at a total daily dose of 1 mg/kg body weight in two divided doses for at least 4 weeks. Measurements and Main Results: Bidimensional tumor measurements at monthly intervals showed striking responses to isotretinoin in all four patients. Response durations ranged from 2 to more than 23 months. The drug produced reversible moderate mucocutaneous side effects and asymptomatic laboratory abnormalities. Conclusions: Impressive responses to isotretinoin occurred in our four patients and in six of ten other reported patients. Retinoic acid's mechanisms of action in cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma is not precisely known, but may involve the modulation of epidermal growth factor receptors and certain protein kinases. These in-vitro findings and the clinical data suggest that retinoids may be an effective and well-tolerated therapy for refractory advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the skin. The absence of any other effective systemic therapy indicates the need for continuing trials with retinoids in this disease.\r"

The epidermis of the ears and tail also loses its pigmentation. Histologic studies confirm that in the epidermis and hair follicles there is an absence of pigment cells identifiable by various histochemical or electron microscopic techniques. This mouse may be an excellent model in which to study the role of Langerhans' cells and the immune response in the pathogenesis of vitiligo, a study not easily done in humans. From results of prior studies, we postulated that if Langerhans' cells were involved in the destruction of melanocytes, they would be abnormal (either more or less numerous) in number during the active phase of depigmentation and normal in number after depigmentation was complete. To determine whether the Langerhans cell (Ia+/adenosine triphosphatase dendritic epidermal cell) might be involved in destruction of pigment cells, we quantified the number of Ia+ and adenosine triphosphatase dendritic cells in the hair follicles in skin from the ear, abdomen, back, and tail from male C57Bl/Ler-vit.vit mice while the fur and skin were depigmenting and after depigmentation was almost completed. We found that Langerhans' cells were normal in number during depigmentation and were most numerous after depigmentation. Previous studies indicate that Langerhans' cells in these mice are functionally defective and respond poorly to some contact allergens. From these morphologic and functional data, we conclude that Langerhans' cells probably are uninvolved in causing depigmentation in these mice. We also observed that the epithelium of hair follicles has a significantly higher (up to 1600/mm2) population density of Langerhans' cells than interfollicular skin.\r"

When patients were stratified according to the drugs involved as causes for their TEN, we found other HLA phenotypes associated with B12, varying with each category of drugs. Sulfonamide-related cases of TEN were linked to A29, B12, and DR7, while oxicam-related cases of TEN were linked to A2 and B12.

Under close observation the patient was re-treated with lower doses of salsalate while renal function and the urinary excretions of prostaglandins were monitored. The excretion of prostaglandin E2 decreased abruptly while the excretion of 6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha decreased more gradually as the dose of salsalate was increased. Renal function appeared to decline in parallel with the decrease in 6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha and recovered rapidly after discontinuation of salsalate therapy.

A single topical application of 1 mg of pilocarpine hydrochloride produced a much smaller IOP reduction and strong, probably maximal accommodation, both of which lasted at least eight hours. When prostaglandin F2 alpha-treated eyes were given pilocarpine before the seventh dose of prostaglandin F2 alpha, accommodation and IOP responded as in eyes receiving pilocarpine only. Atropine sulfate pretreatment of eyes receiving pilocarpine and prostaglandin F2 alpha completely prevented pilocarpine-induced accommodation and inhibition of ocular hypotension induced by prostaglandin F2 alpha. We hypothesize that (1) prostaglandin F2 alpha reduces IOP by increasing uveoscleral drainage of aqueous humor, and (2) pilocarpine pretreatment contracts the ciliary muscle, obliterating the intramuscular spaces and closing off the uveoscleral drainage pathway and thus physiologically blocking the effect.\r"

We measured FEV1 before and at regular intervals after exposure to TDI and performed bronchoalveolar lavage at 8 hours after TDI in two groups of subjects with previously documented late asthmatic reactions, in one group, after no treatment, and in the other group, after treatment with prednisone (50 mg/day for 4 days). After no treatment, each subject developed a late asthmatic reaction, an increase in airway responsiveness, polymorphonuclear leukocytosis, and increased albumin in bronchoalveolar lavage. By contrast, after treatment with prednisone, no subject developed a late asthmatic reaction or an increase in airway responsiveness, and the number of leukocytes and the concentration of albumin were normal in bronchoalveolar lavage. These results suggest that late asthmatic reactions induced by TDI may be caused by airway inflammation and that prednisone may block them [corrected] by inhibiting the inflammatory reaction of the airway induced by TDI in sensitized subjects.\r"

  ".W": "The absence of large von Willebrand factor (vWF) multimers from plasma is a characteristic of Type IIA von Willebrand's disease (vWD) and is thought to contribute to the clinical expression of this disorder. Recently, three IIA patients have been reported in whom intermediate and large multimers could be restored if blood were collected in 5 mm EDTA, 6 mmol/L N-ethylmaleimide, and 1 mmol/L leupeptin. This suggested that absence of large multimers resulted from in vitro proteolysis. We have now collected blood from ten Type IIA vWD patients in these inhibitors but were not able to detect large multimers in the plasma of any of them. In addition, intermediate-sized multimers were reduced or completely absent in all. The inclusion of inhibitors in the citrate anticoagulant, as compared to citrate alone, was found to increase the relative proportion of intermediate multimers in some patients but had no effect in others, and in none did it restore large multimers to plasma. The results with platelet vWF were more varied. Four patients showed an absence or decrease of large multimers, whereas in seven patients large multimers were present. When compared with citrate anticoagulant alone, the inclusion of inhibitors in the anticoagulant had little or no effect on the platelet multimeric pattern. 1-Deamino-8-D-Arginine Vasopressin (DDAVP) was administered to six patients from five families. Two patients from one family showed complete correction and a third patient showed almost complete correction of her bleeding time. Two patients showed minimal correction and one showed no detectable correction. An increase in multimer size after DDAVP tended to be associated with correction of the bleeding time. However, in no case did the largest multimers appear in plasma even in patients with complete bleeding time correction. The presence or absence of inhibitors in the anticoagulant had little or no effect on the multimeric pattern after DDAVP. These results indicate that Type IIA vWD is a heterogeneous disorder in which absence of largest and intermediate multimers is an in vivo phenomenon.\r"

  ".W": "In order to investigate the clinical significance of surface antigen analysis in acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML), the blasts from 196 patients with AML were analyzed prospectively with a panel of 16 monoclonal antibodies. The antibodies were selected to identify differentiation-associated antigens of either the myeloid lineage (MY9, PM-81, AML-2-23, MY7, MCS-1, MY8, Mo1, MY1, MY4, Mo2), T cell lineage (T101, T11), B cell lineage (B1, B4) or multiple lineages [J5 (CALLA), HLA-DR]. Independent morphological review and classification by French-American-British (FAB) criteria was performed in 161 of the 196 cases. One or more myeloid surface antigens were detected on the blasts of 195 cases, while B and T cell markers were detected on 0% to 2% of cases. When both blood and marrow samples were studied on the same patient, very few differences were noted between the antigenic profiles of the paired specimens. The frequency of expression of individual myeloid antigens ranged from 91% (PM-81) to 29% (Mo2). Expression of individual antigens was found to correlate significantly with several clinical parameters including FAB classification, cytochemical staining for alpha naphthyl acetate esterase, leukocyte count, and the presence of extramedullary disease at presentation. Two myeloid antigens (MY4 and MY7) predicted for a low rate of complete remission (CR) to standard induction chemotherapy. MY4+ cases (37% of the total population) had a CR rate of 53%, while M4- cases had a CR rate of 69% (P = .03). MY7+ cases (57% of the total population) had a CR rate of 55% while MY7- cases had a CR rate of 73% (P = .01). Neither MY4 nor MY7 antigen expression was correlated with patient age. Paired combinations of antigens were also examined. The [MY4- MY7-] phenotype was exhibited by 32% of all cases and was associated with an 82% CR rate while the CR rate of all other cases was 54% (P = .001). The expression of three antigens (HLA-DR, MY8, Mo1) was associated with a decreased continuous complete remission (P less than .05, median follow-up time of 19 months). Expression of MY8 antigen was also associated with decreased survival (P = .03). These results confirm earlier reports of antigenic heterogeneity in AML, and indicate that immunologically defined subgroups of AML patients which are of potential clinical significance can be identified.\r"

The purity of the samples was confirmed by electrophoresis in both nondenaturing and denaturing conditions and silver staining. Concentrations of 10(-8) to 10(-10) mol/L rHF caused an approximately 40% significant decrease in colony formation. Some significant activity was detected at 10(-11) mol/L, and activity was lost at 10(-12) mol/L. In contrast, rLF had no significant activity at 10(-8) to 10(-16) mol/L. rHF was significantly active against mouse bone marrow CFU-GM to concentrations as low as 10(-8) to 10(-9) mol/L. The inhibitory activity of rHF was inactivated with three different monoclonal antibodies recognizing the heavy subunit of ferritin, but not with two monoclonal antibodies recognizing the light subunit of ferritin. The inhibitory activity of rHF was similar in the absence or presence of serum, monocytes, and T lymphocytes. We and others have shown an association of a glycosylated natural acidic isoferritin (AIF) with inhibitory activity, but since the rHF was expressed in Escherichia coli and did not bind to concanavalin A, glycosylation of AIF is not an absolute prerequisite for this activity. These results demonstrate that rHF has suppressive activity in vitro and substantiate our original observations using purified natural acidic isoferritins.\r"

  ".W": "To investigate cellular mechanisms involved in thyroid hormone stimulation of erythropoiesis, we studied the response of erythroid burst-forming unit (BFU-E) proliferation to L-triiodothyronine (L-T3) in a serum-free culture system. When added directly to culture, L-T3 stimulates erythroid burst formation by normal human bone marrow cells. In contrast, granulocyte-macrophage colony formation is unaffected. Enhancement of erythroid burst formation by L-T3 required the presence of nylon wool adherent and/or B-4 antigen-positive light-density marrow populations. Addition of other erythropoietic factors including platelet-derived growth factor and insulinlike growth factor II did not abrogate this apparent cellular requirement. Pulse exposure of marrow and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (greater than 95% lymphocytes) to L-T3 accelerates the release of a soluble factor that augments BFU-E proliferation into serum-free liquid culture medium. Time-course studies show that this factor appears in conditioned medium (CM) coincidentally with erythroid burst-promoting activity (BPA). Furthermore, incubation of CM with an antibody known to react with and adsorb BPA from solution removes the inducible mitogen. Biochemical analysis of CM prepared from unexposed and L-T3 pulse-exposed cells indicates that the rate of protein appearance is accelerated by L-T3 in a fashion that immediately precedes growth factor release and that several polypeptides are quantitatively increased. We conclude that unlike erythropoietin, which is mitogenic for progenitor cells directly, L-T3 enhances BFU-E proliferation indirectly by augmenting the release of soluble BPA-like molecules from accessory cells in culture.\r"

  ".W": "Analyses of bone marrow blast cells collected at diagnosis and relapse from 68 children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) demonstrated changes in the expression of cell markers in one-fourth of the patients. Loss of the common ALL antigen (CALLA) was a frequent change, occurring in 8 of the 51 cases initially classified as common or pre-B ALL. The HLA-DR antigen was either acquired or lost in 5 of the 68 cases, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase was lost in 6 of 25 cases, and reactivity of the T10 antigen with monoclonal antibodies was increased in 6 of 17 cases of non-T cell ALL. Conversion to acute nonlymphoblastic leukemia, so-called lineage switch, was noted in two cases of common ALL and one of pre-B ALL, coinciding with the loss of CALLA. Results of chromosomal analyses in cases with a loss of CALLA implicated several mechanisms in the observed phenotypic changes. In six cases, including each instance of lineage switch, the original karyotype had been replaced by an entirely different abnormal karyotype, suggesting clonal selection or induction of a second malignancy. In another case, the evidence suggested clonal evolution. Our findings demonstrate that sequential phenotypic and cytogenetic studies may yield valuable insights into the mechanisms of leukemic recurrence and may have implications for treatment selection.\r"

DIF was highly purified from HUT-102-conditioned media by means of diethylaminoethanol (DEAE)-chromatography, gel chromatography, and high-resolution, ion-exchange chromatography on a MonoQ column and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). In addition to inducing differentiation of wild-type HL-60 cells, resulting in secondary inhibition of growth, DIF, at a tenfold lower concentration, inhibited the growth of some clones of the monoblastic U-937 cell line as well as that of subclones of HL-60. The latter effect was most likely a primary growth inhibition and not secondary to differentiation; 50% inhibition of clonogenic growth in agar was seen at approximately 1.0 pmol/L of DIF. In addition, the clonogenic growth of fresh leukemia cells from 10 of 12 patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) was inhibited with 50% inhibition at approximately 10 pmol/L of DIF. The growth of normal granulocyte-macrophage colonies was inhibited at a similar concentration, whereas early erythroid colonies were much more resistant. DIF and interferon-gamma (gamma-IFN) were shown to be separate molecules inasmuch as a neutralizing antibody for gamma-IFN did not abolish the DIF effect. The differentiation effect on wild-type HL-60 and the proliferation inhibitory effect on leukemic and normal myeloid cells cochromatographed through all purification steps suggest that both activities are exhibited by identical polypeptides. DIF may have a role in regulating normal hemopoiesis. The growth inhibitory effect of DIF and the ability to induce differentiation of some leukemia cells may suggest a clinical utility in the treatment of leukemia.\r"

  ".W": "Hemopoiesis in long-term bone marrow cultures (LTBMC) is dependent on adherent stromal cells that form an in vitro hemopoietic microenvironment. Myeloid bone marrow cultures (MBMC) are optimal for myelopoiesis, while lymphoid bone marrow cultures (LBMC) only support B lymphopoiesis. The experiments reported here have made a comparative analysis of the two cultures to determine whether the stromal cells that establish in vitro are restricted to the support of myelopoiesis or lymphopoiesis, respectively, and to examine how the different culture conditions affect stromal cell physiology. In order to facilitate this analysis, purified populations of MBMC and LBMC stroma were prepared by treating the LTBMC with the antibiotic mycophenolic acid; this results in the elimination of hemopoietic cells while retaining purified populations of functional stroma. Stromal cell cultures prepared and maintained under MBMC conditions secreted myeloid growth factors that stimulated the growth of granulocyte-macrophage colonies, while no such activity was detected from purified LBMC stromal cultures. However, this was not due to the inability of LBMC stroma to mediate this function. Transfer of LBMC stromal cultures to MBMC conditions resulted in an induction of myeloid growth factor secretion. When seeded under these conditions with stromal cell-depleted populations of hemopoietic cells, obtained by passing marrow through nylon wool columns, the LBMC stromal cells could support long-term myelopoiesis. Conversely, transfer of MBMC stroma to LBMC conditions resulted in a cessation of myeloid growth factor secretion; on seeding these cultures with nylon wool-passed marrow, B lymphopoiesis, but not myelopoiesis, initiated. These findings indicate that the stroma in the different LTBMC are not restricted in their hemopoietic support capacity but are sensitive to culture conditions in a manner that may affect the type of microenvironment formed.\r"

DR typing was also performed but was not possible for technical reasons in three patients. Twenty-three patients who had progressed to definite or classical rheumatoid arthritis (RA) after a mean interval of 5 years were compared with 20 patients whose palindromic attacks had persisted over a similar period. Both groups showed a significantly higher frequency of DR4 antigen than a control population. The RA group also showed an increased frequency of DR1. There was no significant difference in the frequency of DR4 or any other DR antigen between the two patient groups. The frequency of B27 antigen was significantly higher in the palindromic group compared with the controls. It is suggested that although DR4 may be associated with a tendency to inflammatory joint problems, environmental or other unrelated genetic factors may be more important in determining the progression of palindromic rheumatism to RA.\r"

Treatment with amphotericin B was administered because of the high risk of dissemination. The patient has been followed for 9 months with no evidence of relapse of infection. Survival after gastrointestinal mucormycosis in acute leukemia has not previously been reported in the English language literature.

  ".W": "Interleukin-2 (IL-2) is a 15,000 dalton glycoprotein produced naturally by human T-cells during an immune response. IL-2 has been demonstrated to have substantial activity alone or in combination with the adoptive transfer of lymphokine-activated killer cells in murine tumor models. IL-2 derived from both natural (Jurkat human T-cell tumor) and recombinant (Escherichia coli) sources has been studied in Phase I protocols designed to evaluate toxicity in patients with a variety of solid tumors and to ascertain improvement in clinical parameters and immunologic status. A total of 16 patients (7 with acquired immune deficiency syndrome [AIDS] and 9 with non-AIDS malignancies) were treated with Jurkat derived IL-2. The total maximum dose (1.3 X 10(5) U/kg) was limited only by supply of this reagent. A total of 25 patients have been treated with recombinant IL-2 (RIL-2) alone. Dose-limiting toxicity manifested by marked malaise and weight gain was achieved with doses of RIL-2 of 10(6) U/kg as a single bolus or 3000 U/kg/hr. IL-2 could be administered intraperitoneally with similar toxicity. Minimal renal or hepatic toxicity was demonstrated. Hematologic toxicity was limited to mild anemia (25/25), thrombocytopenia (10/25), and marked reversible eosinophilia (15/25). Pronounced weight gain greater than 2 kg (16/25) occurred in most patients, primarily those who received cumulative doses of greater than 1-3 X 10(5) U/kg of IL-2. The weight gain amounted to as much as 10% to 20% of the pretreatment weight over 3 weeks of treatment and limited our ability to give higher doses. Two partial responses (greater than 50% decrease in cross sectional diameters) were seen in two patients with melanoma metastatic to the lung.\r"

Although we have strong clues as to the true nature of this dichotomy, there are so many factors involved with open congenital heart repairs that the explanation is not certain. Considering the coronary anatomy, the character of right ventricular infarction, the total lack of reports of post-operative angiography, and our clinical results, we have not found sufficient evidence at this time to recommend bypass to right ventricular coronary branches. We believe that the use of a checklist of right ventricular dysfunction after congenital heart repair may result in detection of a reversible cause of right ventricular dysfunction that could be fatal.\r"

The effect of CGRP was measured angiographically with a computerized analysis system. A dose-dependent increase in coronary arterial diameter was observed. At the highest dose there were 34%, 7%, 38%, and 40% mean increases in the diameters of the circumflex, proximal, mid, and distal left anterior descending arteries, respectively. No further increase in diameter was found after a subsequent dose of 1 mg intracoronary isosorbide dinitrate. Prior infusion of CGRP did not prevent coronary arterial spasm induced by ergonovine in two patients with variant angina, but a subsequent bolus of CGRP partially relieved the spasm. We propose that CGRP has a role in the regulation of coronary vascular smooth muscle tone.\r"

Unilateral gn was induced by perfusion of left kidneys with 200 micrograms cationized human IgG followed by intravenous (i.v.) autologous anti-human IgG antiserum. Rats developed proteinuria in the first 24 hours and hypercellular gn with leukocyte infiltration in the left kidney. Synthesis of thromboxane B2 (TXB2), prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and 6-ketoprostaglandin F 1 alpha(6-keto-PGF 1 alpha) was measured at 6, 12, 18 and 24 hours in isolated glomeruli by radioimmunoassay. In nephritic glomeruli there was a nine-fold rise in TXB2 at six hours (5.35 ng/mg glomerular protein) when compared to control (0.6 ng/mg). TXB2 was still elevated at 24 hours (2.7 +/- 1 ng/mg; control 0.7 +/- 0.2 ng/mg). There were no consistent changes in PGE2 or 6-keto-PGF 1 alpha. No changes were found in right kidneys of nephritic or control rats. Treatment of nephritic rats with a selective thromboxane synthetase inhibitor, dazmegrel (20 mg/kg 8 hourly intraperitoneally), suppressed glomerular TXB2 at 24 hours. TXB2 was also inhibited in right (non-nephritic) kidneys and serum. Dazmegrel did not inhibit proteinuria or glomerular hypercellularity. We conclude there is a major increase in glomerular TXB2 in this model which does not play an essential role in the development of proteinuria or cellular infiltration.\r"

Repeat scintigraphy was performed two to three hours after the vasopressin was stopped. Eleven of the 16 patients (69 percent) demonstrated areas of decreased myocardial 201Tl uptake that resolved after the infusion was stopped. Heart rate-blood pressure product was significantly lower at the time of the second scan. Autopsies were secured in three of 11 scan-positive patients: one had severe coronary artery obstruction, one nonsignificant disease, and another had normal coronary arteries. Vasopressin, even at low doses, can induce abnormalities in myocardial perfusion that are probably mediated by a direct effect on the coronary circulation. They are usually not detectable by routine monitoring techniques and conceivably form the basis for the cardiovascular morbidity associated with the use of this agent.\r"

Patients with PBC but not patients with AC had an increased proportion of lymphocytes in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (respectively 22.4 percent +/- 5.2 and 11.6 percent +/- 2.52 compared with the normal value of 9.9 percent +/- 1.5 p less than 0.05). In the same way, alveolar lymphocytosis of the lower respiratory tract from PBC patients predominantly comprised T4+ (helper/inducer) T-lymphocyte subset in patients showing an increased alveolar lymphocytosis. Alveolar macrophages from PBC patients showed a dramatic increased chemiluminescence response before and after stimulation by phorbol-myristate-acetate, regardless of the intensity of alveolar lymphocytosis. Thus, our data demonstrated that subclinical alveolar inflammation comprising T-lymphocytes and activated alveolar macrophages mimicking sarcoid alveolitis is present in a high proportion of patients with PBC.\r"

  ".W": "In contrast to the human placenta, which does not secrete androgens, the rat placenta synthesizes significant amounts of these steroids. The purpose of this study was to determine why the rat placenta does not secrete androgens before day 12 of pregnancy, to ascertain whether the rat placenta secretes more androstenedione than testosterone, to compare the capacity of luteal and placental tissue to secrete androgen, and to determine whether the rat placental produces androstenedione via the delta 4- or delta 5-steroidogenic pathway. To determine whether the inability of the rat placenta to produce androstenedione before midpregnancy was due to the absence of active 17 alpha-hydroxylase and 17,20-lyase enzymes and also to investigate the ontogeny of both placental production of androstenedione and enzyme activities, placentas were isolated from rats between days 8-21 of pregnancy and either incubated or used to determine the activities of 17 alpha-hydroxylase and 17,20-lyase. Before day 11, enzyme activity was not detectable. From day 11, both enzyme activities and placental secretion of androstenedione steadily increased to peak values by day 18 and declined just before parturition. To investigate the principal aromatizable androgen secreted both in vivo and in vitro approaches were used. Levels of androstenedione and testosterone found in the uterine vein as well as those produced by placental tissue were determined. Rat placentas secreted markedly more androstenedione than testosterone, both in vivo and in vitro. When placental and luteal secretion of androstenedione and testosterone were compared, it was found that luteal tissue had a higher capacity for androgen synthesis than did the placenta. Yet, because of its greater mass, each placenta secreted 15 times more androstenedione and 4.5 times more testosterone than each corpus luteum. To determine the preferential usage of progesterone or pregnenolone as substrate by the placenta, [14C] progesterone and [3H]pregnenolone were added in equimolar concentrations. The resulting 14C to 3H ratio of the androgen produced indicates that the preferred substrate is progesterone. In summary, results of this investigation describe, for the first time, the development of 17 alpha-hydroxylase and 17,20-lyase activities in the rat placenta and demonstrate that the placenta does not produce androgen before day 11 due to the absence of active enzymes. The results further demonstrate that the rat placenta secretes significantly more androstenedione that testosterone both in vivo and in vitro, produces more androgen than the corpus luteum because of its greater mass, and forms its androgen primarily via the delta 4-st\r"

Treatment of anterior pituitary cells with the calcium channel blocker methoxyverapamil (D600; 10 microM) or with calcium-free medium for 1 h did not alter the basal release of beta-endorphin and only partially blocked CRF (10 nM)-stimulated beta-endorphin release. In contrast to these effects of D600 or calcium-free medium on corticotrophs, both of these test conditions decreased basal secretion of PRL from lactotrophs by 50-70% and completely blocked forskolin (10 microM)-stimulated PRL secretion. Although omission of calcium from the culture medium caused a 50% decrease in basal levels of both proopiomelanocortin (POMC) and PRL mRNA, treatment of cells with D600 did not significantly alter the basal levels of POMC or PRL mRNA. Treatment of cells with D600 partially blocked CRF-stimulated elevation of POMC mRNA and forskolin-stimulated elevation of PRL mRNA. The calcium agonist barium (1 mM) produced a 2-fold increase in both beta-endorphin and PRL release, which was blocked by D600. Treatment of cells with barium had no effect on POMC mRNA levels, but increased PRL mRNA levels. D600 treatment of cells partially blocked barium-stimulated PRL mRNA levels. These findings demonstrate a calcium-dependent as well as a calcium-independent component of CRF-stimulated beta-endorphin secretion and CRF-stimulated POMC mRNA elevation. In contrast, PRL secretion and biosynthesis appear to be totally calcium-dependent processes.\r"

Experimental animals received CRF (10 micrograms/day) over a period of 52 days by means of sc osmotic pumps changed at 10- to 14-day intervals. The average 0800 h plasma corticosterone levels in the treated animals were significantly greater than control values [7.52 +/- 0.99 (+/- SE) vs. 1.14 +/- 0.5 micrograms/dl; P less than 0.001]. The CRF-treated animals also had a significantly greater adrenal weight (16.44 +/- 1.38 vs. 12.24 +/- 0.85 mg; P less than 0.05) and lower thymus weight (164 +/- 12 vs. 248 +/- 27 mg; P less than 0.005). There was a marked increase in the number of ACTH-producing cells in the anterior pituitaries of the rats that received CRF (13.3 +/- 0.8% vs. 4.5 +/- 0.3% ACTH-producing cells; P less than 0.001), as determined by immunocytochemical methods. Corticotrophs of rats treated with CRF manifested a significant increase in nuclear area (24.0 +/- 0.7 vs. 21.4 +/- 0.4 micron 2; P less than 0.001) and an increased diameter of forming and storage granules (191.1 +/- 1.1 vs. 158.6 +/- 3.5 nm and 196.1 +/- 1.2 vs. 170.1 +/- 3.7 nm, respectively; P less than 0.001). There was no demonstrable increase in ACTH cell area. These data indicate that long term administration of CRF is capable of increasing the number of pituitary corticotrophs. It also supports the view that the corticotroph hyperplasia occurring after adrenalectomy, in unusual cases of ectopic CRF production, and in rare instances of Cushing's disease is a proliferative response to CRF.\r"

Plasma interleukin-1 (IL-1) in the trained men was also higher (P less than 0.001) than in the untrained men before exercise but did not significantly increase after exercise. In the untrained men, IL-1 was significantly elevated 3 h after exercise (P less than 0.001). In the untrained group only, 24-h urines were collected before and after exercise while the men consumed a meat-free diet. Urinary 3-methylhistidine/creatinine in the untrained group rose significantly from 127 mumol/g before exercise to 180 mumol/g 10 days after exercise. The results suggest that in untrained men eccentric exercise leads to a metabolic response indicative of delayed muscle damage. Regularly performed long distance running was associated with chronically elevated plasma IL-1 levels and serum CK activities without acute increases after an eccentric exercise bout.\r"

This investigation was intended to characterize further IL-1 activity found in human plasma following exercise (3) and to identify physiological initiators of IL-1 secretion. IL-1 activity was measured by the ability of plasma fractions to stimulate lymphocyte proliferation. This activity appeared in plasma several hours after exercise on a cycle ergometer (1 h at 60% of aerobic capacity, n = 8 subjects) and was neutralized with a specific antiserum to human IL-1. The hypothesis that IL-1 release from monocytes was initiated by phagocytosis of material from cells damaged by exercise was tested. The increase in IL-1 activity did not correlate significantly (r = 0.55) with creatine kinase activity, a marker for release of intracellular proteins into the circulation, and IL-1 secretion by monocytes was not stimulated by incubation with red blood cell lysates in vitro. Thus the stimulus for IL-1 secretion did not appear to be related to a scavenging function of monocytes. The possibility that IL-1 secretion may be mediated by stress hormones associated with exercise was examined. IL-1 secretion by monocytes was increased up to 48 +/- 18% (P less than 0.01) by addition of physiological concentrations of epinephrine in vitro. Low concentrations of hydrocortisone (1 ng/ml) also augmented IL-1 secretion by 58 +/- 20%. Higher concentrations in the physiological range had no effect, and combinations of epinephrine and hydrocortisone suppressed IL-1 secretion.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Graft patency rate was 78.4% at the time of early angiographic control (from one to 24 months). There were two early deaths and 47 late deaths. One patient was last to follow-up. Twenty-six of the late deaths were cardiac in nature (57.7%). The overall 10-year survival rate was 68.0 +/- 4.1%. The factors most clearly related to survival rate were: age (p less than 0.05) ischaemic ST-segment depressions on resting preoperative electrocardiogram (p less than 0.005), preoperative electrocardiographic evidence of anterior, septal or lateral myocardial infarction (p less than 0.05), ventricular function as assessed by preoperative left ventriculography (p less than 0.05). During the follow-up period 35.1% of survivors had had no recurrence of angina and 64.9% had experienced at least one episode of angina. At the ten-year evaluation 33 surviving patients considered themselves free of angina, 27 patients considered the angina to be less severe than before the operation and four considered it to be the same or more severe. A significant positive correlation was noted between clinical response and completeness of revascularization (p less than 0.05).\r"

Each oCRH injection was followed by a distinct elevation of plasma ACTH and cortisol levels, with a return to basal values before the next injection. The characteristics of the ACTH and cortisol pulses induced by 25 micrograms oCRH (i.e. 0.3-0.4 micrograms/kg) were similar to those observed in other studies with 1 microgram/kg human CRH. There was no significant blunting of oCRH-induced hormonal increments in the course of the 72-h study. On each oCRH injection day, the mean 24-h cortisol level was higher than that in the basal study, but there was no increase in the mean 24-h ACTH level. During the 72-h oCRH study, the preinjection ACTH and cortisol levels exhibited a diurnal variation, indicating persistence of the circadian periodicity of pituitary-adrenal activity. There was a diurnal variation of oCRH-induced ACTH increments, with highest responses at 0700 h. A small but not significant reverse trend was apparent for cortisol increments. Spontaneous pulses of ACTH and cortisol occurred throughout the 3 days of oCRH injections, and the total number of spontaneous and oCRH-induced pulses was similar to the number of spontaneous pulses observed in the basal study. All oCRH-induced and more than 90% of spontaneous cortisol pulses occurred concomitantly with an ACTH pulse. The variability of pulse increments was greater for ACTH than for cortisol. In conclusion, prolonged pulsatile administration of oCRH did not induce pituitary desensitization and did not suppress the endogenous circadian and pulsatile ACTH and cortisol variations.\r"

Mean peak (+/- SEM) hormone concentrations were significantly reduced (ACTH, 16.7 +/- 3.5 vs. 45.3 +/- 7.8 pg/ml; beta-endorphin, 151 +/- 25 vs. 277 +/- 51 pg/ml; cortisol, 8.1 +/- 1.2 vs. 19.5 +/- 2.6 micrograms/dl; P less than 0.02), as were secretory areas (P less than 0.02). These results indicate a direct pituitary action of the synthetic met-enkephalin. In contrast, in patients with Cushing's disease, FK 33-824 did not inhibit hCRH-induced hormone release. Instead, maximum ACTH and beta-endorphin concentrations were slightly but not significantly higher after the administration of FK 33-824 (ACTH, 292 +/- 143 vs. 131 +/- 32 pg/ml; beta-endorphin, 2409 +/- 763 vs. 1921 +/- 600 pg/ml). These findings indicate a defect in inhibitory opiodergic control of ACTH secretion in patients with Cushing's disease, which may contribute to the pathological ACTH hypersecretion. In patients with Cushing's syndrome due to an adrenal adenoma or ectopic ACTH secretion, neither hCRH nor FK 33-824 altered hormone concentrations.\r"

  ".W": "An early (but not a late) first pregnancy is known to be protective for breast cancer. This effect might be mediated through a long term change in the hormonal environment caused by the early first pregnancy. To investigate the possibility of such a change we carried out a prospective longitudinal study of serum and urinary estrogens and serum androgens in four groups of women, namely early (age, 18-23 yr) first pregnancy (n = 15), early control (n = 20), late (age, 29-40 yr) first pregnancy (n = 9), and late control (n = 20). The pregnancy groups were studied before (initial visit) and 7-19 months after a first pregnancy (return visit). The control groups were similarly studied, but without an intervening pregnancy. The following were measured: serum estrone (E1), 17 beta-estradiol (E2), estriol (E3), and E1 sulfate; urinary total E1, E2, E3, and glucosiduronates of these three estrogens; and serum testosterone, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHAS), and dehydroepiandrosterone (DHA). There was no significant change between the initial and return visits in serum E1, E2, E1 sulfate, or any of the urinary estrogens in either pregnancy group or in the corresponding control groups. There was, however, a significant increase in serum E3 between initial and return visits for both pregnancy groups compared with the control values. There was no significant change in serum testosterone. There was a marked significant decrease in both serum DHAS and DHA between initial and return visits in both pregnancy groups compared with the corresponding control group values. There was also a significant increase in the serum E3 to DHA ratio in both pregnancy groups. A cross-sectional study (measuring serum DHAS and DHA only) was then carried out in a series of parous and nulliparous women. The serum DHAS and DHA levels were markedly and significantly lower in parous than in nulliparous women, as expected. There was no significant relationship between serum DHAS or DHA levels and months elapsed (up to 150) since last delivery, indicating that the changes last at least for this period of time. There was no significant relationship between serum DHAS or DHA levels and parity (one to three previous pregnancies), indicating that the changes occur only after a first pregnancy.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

There was no significant difference in the total osteocalcin concentrations between the control patients and the patients receiving long term warfarin treatment, and it did not significantly change after warfarin ingestion in the normal subjects. The GLU/GLA ratio was significantly increased (P less than 0.002) in the patients receiving long term warfarin treatment compared with that in the control patients. There was a significant increase (P less than 0.01) in the GLU/GLA ratio after warfarin ingestion in the normal subjects. This study demonstrates that osteocalcin carboxylation in humans is a vitamin K-dependent process and that circulating osteocalcin is structurally altered by warfarin administration. This finding has pathophysiological implications for the fetal warfarin embryopathy syndrome, bone disease associated with chronic liver diseases, and possibly for osteoporosis, in which vitamin K deficiency has been implicated.\r"

We examined hormone levels in patients with nonclassical 21-hydroxylase deficiency in whom pedigree analysis and/or HLA linkage disequilibrium allowed unequivocal identification of the respective haplotypes as either classical or nonclassical. The results indicated that compound heterozygotes (21-OH defsevere/21-OH defmild) have an ACTH-stimulated 17-hydroxyprogesterone (17-OHP) response significantly greater than that of mild homozygotes (21-OH defmild/21-OH defmild): at 60 min, 8,131 +/- 4,205 (+/-SD) (n = 17) vs. 4,468 +/- 2,123 ng/dl (n = 31) for the respective groups (P less than or equal to 0.01); at 360 min, 11,067 +/- 5,582 (n = 17) vs. 5746 +/- 1565 (n = 8, P less than or equal to 0.01). Since serum cortisol levels were the same in both groups, the ratio of 17-OHP to cortisol was higher in the former group. Sixty minute ACTH-stimulated serum delta 4-androstenedione levels also were significantly higher in compound heterozygotes than in mild homozygotes. Serum dehydroepiandrosterone and its sulfate were not significantly different between the two groups. Notably, compound heterozygotes were no more likely to have signs of androgen excess than were homozygotes for the mild gene defect. Stimulated levels of serum 17-OHP, 17-OHP/cortisol, delta 4-androstenedione and dehydroepiandrosterone and its sulfate did not differ significantly between heterozygotes for the classical (21-OH defsevere/21-OHnormal) and nonclassical (21-OH defmild/21-OHnormal) 21-hydroxylase deficiency alleles. Thus, the presence of a single normal 21-hydroxylase allele is sufficient to obscure the difference between a severe and a mild 21-hydroxylase deficiency allele on the opposite haplotype. We conclude that the compound heterozygous patients as a group have a significantly higher response of 21-hydroxylase precursors to ACTH stimulation than do patients with the homozygous mild 21-hydroxylase deficiency state.\r"

Because altered function of smooth muscle cells (SMC) accompanies certain vascular diseases, we tested whether SMC themselves might produce this hormone. Unstimulated SMC contain little or no IL-1 mRNA. However, exposure to bacterial endotoxin caused accumulation of IL-1 mRNA in SMC cultured from human vessels. Endotoxin maximally increased IL-1 beta mRNA in SMC after 4-6 h. The lowest effective concentration of endotoxin was 10 pg/ml. 10 ng/ml produced maximal increases in IL-1 beta mRNA. Interleukin-1 alpha mRNA was detected when SMC were incubated with endotoxin under \"superinduction\" conditions with cycloheximide. Endotoxin-stimulated SMC also released biologically functional IL-1, measured as thymocyte costimulation activity inhibitable by anti-IL-1 antibody. Thus, human SMC can express IL-1 beta and IL-1 alpha genes, or very similar ones, and secrete biologically active product in response to a pathological stimulus. Endogenous local production of this inflammatory mediator by the blood vessel wall's major cell type could play an important early role in the pathogenesis of vasculitis and arteriosclerosis.\r"

Platelets aggregated in the shear field if large von Willebrand Factor (vWF) multimers were present. Aggregation did not require ristocetin, other exogenous agents, or desialation of vWF. Unusually large vWF multimers produced by human endothelial cells were functionally more effective than the largest plasma vWF forms in supporting shear-induced aggregation. Shear-induced aggregation was inhibited by monoclonal antibodies to platelet glycoprotein Ib or the IIb/IIIa complex, but was little affected by the absence of fibrinogen. vWF-dependent platelet aggregation under elevated shear stress in partially occluded vessels of the arterial microcirculation may contribute to thrombosis, especially if unusually large vWF multimers are released locally from stimulated or disrupted endothelial cells.\r"

In contrast, the Fab' fragments of 5F4 inhibited only the fluid phase activation and had no effect on the surface-mediated activation. 3C1 was found to block the binding of Factor XI to HMW kininogen, whereas 5F4 did not. We conclude: a domain on the heavy chain region of Factor XI is essential for binding to HMW kininogen and for optimal surface-mediated activation by Factor XIIa; and binding of 3C1 to Factor XI changes its conformation rendering it a more favorable substrate for Factor XIIa in the fluid phase.\r"

This decrease was found both in active and in late rosette-forming cell subpopulations. Natural killer cell activity of peripheral blood mononuclear cells was found to be increased in four of nine patients with epidermodysplasia verruciformis, whereas antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity was within the normal range in all patients studied. Lymphocyte-induced angiogenesis assay, which is a sensitive test for the estimation of the immunocompetence of lymphoid cells, revealed increased angiogenic capability of peripheral blood mononuclear cells in the majority of the patients.

The 5 year probability of remaining free of an acute cardiac event, defined as acute coronary insufficiency, myocardial infarction or sudden death, was 0.92 +/- 0.01 (mean +/- SE) for the 1,207 men without previous myocardial infarction and 0.98 +/- 0.01 for the 122 men who never smoked and did not have a history of hypertension. Among the 1,119 men with a previous myocardial infarction, the probability of remaining free of acute cardiac events was 0.91 +/- 0.02 and 0.92 +/- 0.02 when left ventricular contraction score was 5 to 9 and 10 or greater, respectively. In this patient subgroup, mortality rate was similar to that of the age-matched U.S. male population when the left ventricular contraction score was 5 to 9 (4.0% versus 4.3%; p = NS) but significantly worse when the left ventricular contraction score was 10 or greater (7% versus 4.2%; p = 0.05).

B-lymphocytes were not detectable, and approximately 20% of cells could not be identified. Although patients varied greatly in the ratio of Leu 3a positive helper-inducer T cells to T8 positive cytotoxic-suppressor cells, the average of all patients was not significantly different from the T4/T8 ratio in plasma.

  ".W": "Novel cell-sized, supported artificial membranes bearing class I antigens have been prepared by a simple dialysis procedure and then used to study the requirements for antigen recognition by precursor cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL). The membranes were made by mixing lipid, H-2 antigen, and C18 alkylated 5 microns silica beads in deoxycholate, and dialyzing to remove the detergent. The H-2 antigen-bearing, cell-sized beads, termed pseudocytes (artificial cells), were able to simulate generation of secondary CTL responses with the same specificity as alloantigen-bearing spleen cells. Comparative analyses demonstrated that the size of an antigen-bearing structure, and thus its potential for multivalent interaction, was a critical determinant of effectiveness of antigen recognition, and showed that H-2 antigen was recognized as effectively on cell-sized beads as on allogeneic spleen cells. Generation of a response to antigen on the cell-sized beads was completely dependent on addition of lymphokines to the cultures. Thus, unlike liposomes, H-2 antigen on beads was not available to accessory cells for stimulation of Ia-dependent production of lymphokines by T helper cells. These results, as well as direct observations by microscopy, strongly indicate that antigen is recognized on the surface of the beads. Despite effective stimulation of secondary CTL responses, antigen on beads was completely inactive in stimulating a primary CTL response by naive spleen cells. The results of mixing experiments by using beads and alloantigen-bearing cells or plasma membrane vesicles indicate that the lack of a primary response may result from a requirement for a soluble factor(s) that is not needed for generation of secondary responses. The unique advantages of cell-size supported membranes for studying antigen recognition by T cells are discussed. The beads can be handled and used like antigen-bearing cells in functional assays, while possessing well-defined, readily varied, and easily quantitated composition.\r"

  ".W": "In this study we examined the mechanism by which a PPD-specific murine T cell hybridoma, 8B2, recognized PPD associated with antigen-presenting cells (APC) in a manner genetically restricted by I-Ad. It was found that PPD-pulsed APC that were glutaraldehyde-fixed and treated with anti-Ia monoclonal antibody (abbreviated as PGM) were unable to stimulate the 8B2 T cells, as expected, due to inhibition caused by antibody binding to the Ia. However, addition of non-antigen-treated, glutaraldehyde-fixed APC (abbreviated as G) to cultures containing 8B2 T cells and PGM restored T cell activation, as determined by IL 2 production. This second non-antigen-specific function provided by the additional APC, G, was attributed to Ia and could be substituted by APC plasma membranes and by soluble membrane extracts. Genetic restriction analysis in which a variety of Ia-positive and Ia-negative cell lines and B cell blasts from different mouse strains were used as PGM or as G showed that each APC provided different Ia determinants that were specifically recognized by the T cells. PGM cells had to express I-Ad in order to present the PPD determinant, whereas the non-antigen-specific function was specific for I-Ad or I-Ab. These results suggest that the anti-Ia antibody does not interfere with the PPD/I-Ad-specific determinant bound by the antigen-specific T cell receptor, but prevents a second non-antigen-specific interaction with another region of the Ia molecule, which is provided by G. These two roles for Ia (antigen-specific and non-antigen-specific) were also found for activation of normal polyclonal PPD-specific T cell responses; thus they are not unique to the 8B2 T cell, but are generally applicable. In addition, T cell interactions with PGM and with G each provide different intracellular activation signals. This was determined by substituting the PGM or the G with either the tumor promoter phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) or the Ca++ ionophore, ionomycin. It was found that 8B2 T cells cultured with PGM and ionomycin, but not with PGM and PMA, were activated for IL 2 production. Neither PMA nor ionomycin in conjunction with G resulted in T cell activation. Taken together, these results indicate that 8B2 T cell activation involves APC Ia antigens in two different ways: one is to contribute to the presentation of the foreign PPD antigen, and a second is a non-antigen-specific Ia-T cell interaction necessary to provide additional intracellular activation signals.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

This proliferative response is abolished by depletion of macrophages-monocytes, but can be reconstituted by the addition of cerebral vascular endothelial cells (EC) freshly isolated from syngeneic mice with adoptively transferred acute experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE). Reconstitution by EC from mice with EAE can be blocked by pretreatment of EC with syngeneic anti-I-A antisera. Freshly isolated EC from normal syngeneic mice do not restore responsiveness, but can be induced to present antigen by culture with murine recombinant immune interferon-gamma or supernatants from a variety of immune cell cultures. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that immune cells release interferon and/or other soluble factors which induce I-A molecules on EC, which subsequently acquire the capacity to present antigen. The implications of these findings relate to the migration of cells across the blood-brain-barrier into the central nervous system, and are of importance in the understanding of the pathogenesis of several neurologic disorders.\r"

In this paper we have addressed the effect of treatment with prazosin commencing at varying times in the disease process. The results show that treatment during the early inductive stage (1 to 6 dpi) has no effect on the clinical course of the disease, whereas treatment commencing at the time of onset of early clinical signs (10 to 16 dpi) still significantly suppresses EAE. Leakage of serum proteins into the central nervous system (CNS) and histologic expression of EAE are also suppressed. Prazosin had no effect on lymphocyte responses to mitogen or antigen as determined by lymphocyte transformation tests when lymphocytes were exposed to prazosin in vitro, and the responses of lymphocytes from prazosin-treated animals were similar to those from saline-treated animals. These results support the hypothesis that prazosin suppresses EAE through a direct vascular effect although they do not preclude an immunologic component to its mechanism of action.\r"

One manifestation of this gene is a massive T cell proliferation that results in a generalized lymphadenopathy in older animals. Interleukin 3 (IL 3), a recently described lymphokine, has been shown to influence lymphocyte differentiation. It was possible that abberrant IL 3 production was the mechanism responsible for the lpr controlled lymphadenopathy. Consequently, in this paper we tested the MRL congenic mice for their ability to produce IL 3. We report that the T lymphocytes from MRL-+ and MRL-lpr could neither respond to pokeweed mitogen in the induction of proliferation nor produce IL 3. Moreover, IL 3 was not produced constitutively nor could be induced at any time period up to 5 days in vitro. This hyporesponsiveness was shown to be controlled at the accessory cell level. Addition of T cell-depleted peritoneal exudate cells from normal major histocompatibility complex (MHC) compatible mice was able to restore the ability to secrete IL 3 in response to pokeweed mitogen in MRL-+ and young MRL-lpr mice. The defect in the accessory cells could be overridden by two means: the incorporation of phorbol myristate acetate in the induction system and preincubation of the cells in tissue culture.\r"

Aqueous extracts of psoriatic scale contained significantly greater neutrophil chemokinetic activity than extracts of scale from normal skin. Successive ultrafiltration of extracts showed that the chemokinetic material was 10 to 30 kd. Heat lability and gel filtration HPLC characteristics suggested that the major chemokinetically active material in aqueous extracts of psoriatic scale is different from C5a des arg. Reversed-phase HPLC of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid/acetonitrile extracts of psoriatic scale revealed two clearly resolved peaks of chemokinetic activity, the major peak consistently containing thymocyte co-stimulating activity. No significant neutrophil chemokinetic activity was seen in fractions after reversed-phase HPLC of scale from normal skin. These findings suggest that a major portion of the neutrophil chemoattractant activity in aqueous extracts of psoriatic scale is due to interleukin 1-like material, which may play a role in the pathogenesis of this disease.\r"

To determine whether the IL 2 gene is activated in sarcoidosis T cells in a systemic manner or only at sites of disease, cells obtained by bronchoalveolar lavage of individuals with active sarcoidosis, inactive sarcoidosis, and normals were evaluated for the spontaneous presence of IL 2 transcripts by using a human IL 2 cDNA probe and Northern analysis of extracted RNA. Freshly recovered lung cells of individuals with active pulmonary sarcoidosis contained 0.85 kilobase pairs (kb) IL 2 mRNA transcripts. In contrast, no IL 2 mRNA transcripts could be detected in fresh autologous blood T cells or in purified autologous blood Leu-3+ T cells, although IL 2 mRNA transcripts were inducible in these cells by phytohemaglutinin/phorbol myristic acetate. The sarcoid lung T cells, however, did not express the IL 2 gene constitutively; when placed in culture with no stimulation and evaluated after 24 hr, they demonstrated down regulation of the amounts of IL 2 mRNA transcripts, despite the fact that they were capable of re-expressing the IL 2 gene and releasing more IL 2 in response to added activation signals. Thus the activation of the IL 2 gene in T cells in active sarcoidosis occurs at the sites of disease and is not a generalized property of T cells throughout the body, and is not sustained if the T cells are removed from the sites of disease. Although the cause of sarcoid is unknown, these observations are consistent with the concept that sarcoid is associated with local stimuli at the site of disease eliciting the Leu-3+ T cell IL 2 gene activation that plays such a critical role in the pathogenesis of this disease.\r"

The surface phenotype and cytolytic function was compared with the ability of these T cell clones to release cytotoxic lymphokines in response to mitogenic lectins. The cytotoxins released by these CTL clones were detected on the murine L929 target cells in a 16-hr assay. All of the T cell clones, whether stimulated by HLA alloantigens, tetanus toxoid, or mitogens, exhibited killer cell activity and the capacity to secrete a soluble cytotoxin(s). Specific polyclonal antisera to recombinant human tumor necrosis factor (rTNF) and human alpha-lymphotoxin (alpha LT) were unable to neutralize the cytotoxic activity released by most of these CTL clones. These results indicate that human CTL produce a novel antigenic form(s) of cytotoxin that we have termed CTL-toxin. Supernatants from several CTL clones yielded a cytotoxic activity that was partially neutralized (10 to 40%) by saturating levels of anti-TNF (but not anti-alpha LT) indicating that human CTL may be capable of producing a TNF-like molecule. Only two out of 60 CTL clones studied thus far produced a cytotoxic activity that was partially neutralized by anti-alpha LT (20 to 40%). Collectively, these results suggest that although both the CD4 and the CD8 subpopulations of human cytotoxic T cells may be capable of releasing several types of cytotoxins in response to mitogenic signals, the predominant cytotoxin is distinct from alpha LT and TNF.\r"

We have investigated whether astrocyte-derived IL 3 supports growth of macrophages and their representatives in the brain, the microglia cells. Evidence for intercellular communication between murine astrocytes and macrophages became already detectable in co-culture experiments: astrocytes activated with endotoxin resulted in an increased growth of peritoneal macrophages on the astrocyte monolayer. Biochemical analysis of supernatants of activated astrocytes revealed that the IL 3-like factor that stimulated 32DCL cells and the expression of 20 alpha SDH also served as a growth factor for cultured peritoneal macrophages. The same results were obtained by using microglia cells isolated from primary brain cell cultures of newborn mice, which are characterized by their positive reaction for macrophage markers such as Mac-1 and nonspecific esterase. If secreted by reactive astrocytes in vivo, the IL 3-like factor may contribute to the accumulation of macrophages and microglia cells detected in brain lesions of patients with multiple sclerosis.\r"

HLA-B27.4 differs from the main B27.1 subtype in the same two changes of aspartate-77 to serine-77 and valine-152 to glutamate-152, which distinguish the B27.1 and B27.3 subtypes. In addition, there are two other amino acid changes of histidine-114 to aspartate-114 and of aspartate-116 to tyrosine-116, which are unique to B27.4. The close structural relationship between B27.3 and B27.4 explains the similarity of these two subtypes in terms of T cell recognition. The presence of the two single amino acid differences between B27.3 and B27.4 within a span of three residues in the linear sequence provides a new example, suggesting that gene conversion-like mechanisms play a major role in the diversification of HLA-B27. A comparison of the structure of HLA-B27.4 with those of B27.1, B27.2, and B27.3 in the context of their ethnic distribution suggests that the diversification of the HLA-B27 antigens is an ongoing process that has continued after the separation of the major ethnic groups.

Our studies establish a relationship between f-Met-Leu-Phe receptor number and affinity and neutrophil chemotaxis and oxidative metabolism. A brief (5- to 15-min) exposure to physiologic concentrations of GM-CSF (10 pM to 100 pM) enhances f-Met-Leu-Phe-induced neutrophil chemotaxis by 85%, correlating with a rapid threefold increase (46,000/cell to 150,000/cell) in high-affinity neutrophil f-Met-Leu-Phe receptors. More prolonged incubation (1 to 2 hr) of neutrophils with GM-CSF is accompanied by a change to low-affinity f-Met-Leu-Phe receptors (Kd = 29 nM to Kd = 99 nM) concomitant with priming for enhanced neutrophil oxidative metabolism. Moreover, enhanced chemotactic responses to f-Met-Leu-Phe are no longer evident after more prolonged incubation of neutrophils with GM-CSF. These results show that a single lymphokine (GM-CSF) induces sequential changes in neutrophil f-Met-Leu-Phe receptor number and affinity that may enhance different physiologic responses.\r"

In addition, class II MHC-restricted antiviral CTL failed to show any lysis of radiolabeled bystander cells. Killing of labeled specific targets by these class II MHC-restricted CTL was also efficiently inhibited by unlabeled specific competitor cells in a cold target inhibition assay. In sum, these data suggest that class I and class II MHC-restricted CTL mediate target cell destruction by an essentially similar direct mechanism.\r"

Specifically, BSF1-containing supernatant does not induce PtdInsP2 hydrolysis as determined by measurement of PtdOH and InsP3. Additionally, BSF1 does not stimulate Ca2+ mobilization, PKC translocation from cytosol to membrane, or membrane depolarization. All of these metabolic events appear to play a central role in hyper-Ia expression mediated by mIg and are initiated after treatment of resting B cells with anti-Ig antibodies. In vitro phosphorylation studies with partially purified plasma membranes from resting B cells revealed that BSF1 interaction with membrane receptors stimulates a membrane-associated protein kinase that phosphorylates an endogenous protein of 44 KDa. Anti-Ig does not stimulate phosphorylation of the 44 KDa protein, suggesting that it does not activate the membrane-associated protein kinase. This observation provides the first evidence of a signal transduction mechanism associated with BSF1-receptor ligation. It indicates that although BSF1 does not modulate events associated with PKC activation, it may function via activation of a membrane-associated protein kinase. This provides a focal point for further studies directed at elucidating signal transduction resulting from BSF1-receptor interaction.\r"

We evaluated the therapeutic potential of such lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) cells in vivo and high-dose II 2 in vivo against disseminated murine leukemia. To quantitate the potential anti-leukemia effect of LAK cells in vivo, B6 mice were injected i.p. with graded doses of FBL-3 leukemia cells followed by LAK cells. In this Winn-type assay, 1 X 10(7) LAK cells were able to prevent the outgrowth of 1 X 10(2) FBL-3 cells in only 50% of mice and did not prevent the outgrowth of 1 X 10(6) tumor cells. Thus LAK cells, highly cytolytic to FBL-3 in vitro, mediated only a limited anti-tumor effect when applied directly to leukemia cells in vivo. LAK cells used as an adjunct to chemotherapy induced a small but non-curative effect against FBL-3, however. In this circumstance, LAK cells were markedly less effective than were immune spleen cells from mice previously sensitized to FBL-3. To test the anti-leukemia effect of high-dose IL 2 in vivo, B6 mice were inoculated with 5 X 10(6) FBL-3 cells followed by repeated doses of IL 2 at dose levels shown to induce LAK in vivo. \"LAK-inducing\" IL 2 doses on days 5 to 9 after FBL-3 inoculation, when tumor was disseminated, cured 50% of the mice. Treatment on days 5 to 9 was far more effective than on days 0 to 4, implying that the evolution of a host-tumor interaction was essential for the therapeutic effect of IL 2. Mice cured of FBL-3 by high-dose IL 2 were found to be immune to FBL-3, suggesting that tumor eradication resulted from a collaboration between LAK activity and tumor-specific immunity.\r"

  ".U": "87058964\r", 
  ".W": "Expression of several of the surface antigens on normal and malignant hematopoietic cells is reduced or is modulated by incubation with specific antibodies. Although antigenic modulation provides a means by which cells can escape antibody-mediated immune destruction, the physiologic significance and frequency of this phenomenon are both poorly understood. To begin to address these issues, we identified and characterized surface antigens on the malignant B cell line Laz 221 established from a patient with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Indirect immunofluorescence analysis with the use of 26 hematopoietic cell populations and immune precipitation studies with the use of iodinated ALL cells indicate that 163 monoclonal antibodies (MoAb) identify 22 different proteins on this cell line, including at least six previously described surface molecules. Seven of these antigens are expressed by all nucleated cells examined, whereas only the mu chain of immunoglobulin is B cell specific. Incubation of specific MoAb with cultures of Laz 221 cells at 37 degrees C reduces or modulates surface expression of five of these 22 antigens (p45, immunoglobulin mu chain, transferrin receptor, common ALL antigen (CD10), and p105). Studies that made use of multiple MoAb specific for the same antigen suggest that the capacity for antigenic modulation is an intrinsic property of individual antigens. These studies also suggest that the murine immune response to shared human antigens varies from one immunizing cell population to another. For example, three of the antigens present on Laz 221 cells were only identified by MoAb raised to the Burkitt's cell line Ramos and vice-versa. Only one of these six shared antigens is present in greater amounts on the immunogenic cell population. Immunogenicity of individual human antigens in the mouse may be a function of their cell surface environment.\r"

By using an in vitro culture system, it was previously determined that the induction of NP-specific effector suppressor activity requires T cells, antigen, and an anti-idiotypic B cell population. We now demonstrate that the generation of Ts3 cells in this system also requires accessory cells. The accessory population appears to play a role in the processing and presentation of antigen. These antigen-presenting accessory cells are required early in the induction phase of Ts3 generation. These accessory cells can present NP coupled to immunogenic or non-immunogenic polypeptide carriers, including polymers of L-amino acids. However, NP coupled to polymers of poorly metabolized D-amino acids fail to induce suppressor T cell generation. Furthermore, the data demonstrate that an H-2 homology must exist between the Ts3 precursors and the antigen-presenting cell population if suppressor activity is to be generated. We also characterize the differential genetic restrictions that govern the induction of Ts3 cells that control suppression of either T cell or B cell responses. The data suggest that although I-J region encoded gene products control the induction and effector phases of suppressor cell activity as measured on T cell responses, the suppression of B cell responses appear to be controlled by I-A gene products. Possible cellular mechanisms that might explain these findings are discussed.\r"

  ".U": "87058969\r", 
  ".W": "Previous work has shown that specific helper T cells are required for the primary induction of delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH). Conditions are defined here under which the primary induction by antigen of precursor helper T cells only occurs in the presence of specific, irradiated effector T cells, demonstrating that the induction of helper T cells requires T-T cooperation. The interaction between precursor and effector helper T cells is mediated by the recognition of epitopes that must be physically linked to one another. In more detail, hapten-Ficoll conjugates and xenogeneic red blood cells induce medium-density but not low-density cultures of unprimed murine spleen cells to express antigen-specific DTH. Low-density cultures do not support the induction of DTH unless they are supplemented with specific irradiated helper T cells. These helper T cells are themselves induced when antigen is added to medium-density but not low-density cultures. Precursor helper T cells in low-density cultures are only induced by antigen in the presence of additional specific irradiated T cells. Further experiments were directed at analyzing the nature of this T-T interaction. Irradiated hapten-primed T cells help the induction of precursor helper T cells specific for burro red blood cells (BRBC) in the presence of haptenated BRBC and chicken red blood cells (CRBC), but do not help in the presence of haptenated CRBC and BRBC. These experiments demonstrate that the interaction between precursor and effector T cells is mediated by the linked recognition of antigen. These findings show that the induction of precursor cells for both DTH reactivity, and those T cells able to help in the induction of DTH, require specific helper T cells. It is further shown that the induction of T cells able to help in the induction of helper precursor cells takes place in medium-density but not low-density cultures. In order words, antigen, when added to medium-density cultures of normal spleen cells, induces T cells able to mediate DTH, and T cells able to help in the induction of these helper T cells, whereas antigen induces none of these T cells when added to low-density cultures unless appropriate specific helper T cells are added.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

Cells with the same apparent surface phenotype also accumulate in vast numbers in the lymphoid tissues of the autoimmune lpr mouse. Lyt-2- L3T4- T lymphocytes from lpr lymph node (LN) or normal thymus express low to undetectable levels, respectively, of surface antigen receptor. In addition, they produce reduced amounts of lymphokines compared with normal T cells and lack precursors of alloantigen-specific cytolytic T lymphocytes. We previously showed that after culture with phorbol esters and interleukin 2, lpr Lyt-2- L3T4- T lymphocytes proliferate and differentiate, acquiring increased levels of surface antigen receptor by most cells, as well as Lyt-2 by a portion. We now show that cultured Lyt-2- L3T4- T cells from lpr LN or normal thymus are very efficiently cytolytic toward not only allogeneic tumor targets, but also natural killer (NK)-susceptible targets and syngeneic targets. Such killing was not inhibited by antibodies to H-2 or Lyt-2. In contrast, cultured mature Lyt-2+ L3T4- T cells from normal LN, thymus, or lpr LN were cytolytic only toward allogeneic targets and were dependent on Lyt-2 expression and H-2 recognition. The similarities of cultured Lyt-2- L3T4- T cells to NK and lymphokine-activated killer cells are discussed.\r"

  ".W": "The current studies were undertaken to explore the regulatory effects of macrophages and their soluble products on B cell activation in defined medium by surface membrane-directed mitogens (anti-Ig, LPS) and by intracellular mitogens (8-mercaptoguanosine, [8MGuo]). Supplementation of macrophage-depleted B cell cultures with adherent cells enhanced the response to anti-Ig but depressed the response to 8MGuo. These changes could be eliminated by adding indomethacin to B cell cultures containing supplemental macrophages. Moreover, they could be reproduced by adding exogenous prostaglandins (PGE1, PGE2) but not other macrophage products to cultured B cells. Prostaglandins regulate B cell function (i.e., immunoglobulin secretion) in the same manner as they do mitogenesis. Thus, the polyclonal response to LPS is enhanced, whereas that to 8MGuo is inhibited. We showed previously that anti-Ig acts on a B cell subpopulation distinct from that stimulated by 8MGuo. Moreover, when addition of prostaglandin is delayed for more than 24 hr, the effect on the anti-Ig response changes from enhancement to inhibition and the effect on 8MGuo is lost, suggesting that in the course of activation the cell progresses through a series of cell cycle-specific regulatory states. Additionally, the mitogenic effects of 8MGuo appear to involve larger, cycling cells more than smaller cells. In concert, these data suggest a model for regulation of the B cell cycle in which prostaglandins, whose secretion is elicited by many surface-directed B cell stimuli, enhance the entry of cells into the cell cycle and subsequently regulate their passage through the cycle.\r"

Con A-activated CD4+ or CD8+ T lymphocytes from the SLE patients and from normal controls were further separated into two populations, using the autologous erythrocyte rosette technique. One population very rich in cells capable of forming rosettes with autologous erythrocytes from the active patients showed the same degree of suppressor activity, as did that from normal controls; the CD4+ or CD8+ population poor in autorosetting cells derived from Con A-activated T lymphocytes from both the controls and patients did not express suppressor activity. Moreover, when autorosetting T cells from the active patients and nonrosetting cells from the same patients were mixed at a normal ratio (4:6), normal suppressor activity could be restored. It was notable that the frequency of autorosette-forming cells was markedly reduced in the Con A-activated T lymphocytes from the active, but not inactive, SLE patients, regardless of the phenotype of CD4+ or CD8+. These findings indicate the presence of a normally functioning suppressor T cell population in patients with active SLE. It seems that the lack of suppressor T cell function in patients with active SLE is due to the dilution of a few normal suppressor T cells by large numbers of nonsuppressor T lymphocytes.\r"

  ".W": "T lymphocyte lines specific for the peripheral nerve myelin protein P2 were selected from the lymph nodes of Brown Norway (BN) rats immunized with bovine P2 protein in complete Freund's adjuvant. These T cells expressed the W3/25+, OX8-phenotype and responded specifically to bovine P2 protein, but not to PPD or bovine basic protein, in T cell proliferation assays. When injected i.v. into syngeneic recipients, BN P2-specific T cell lines induced both clinical and histologic signs of experimental allergic neuritis (EAN), overcoming the resistance of this rat strain to actively induced EAN. Although the histopathology of the disease was indistinguishable from that seen in T cell-mediated EAN in the Lewis rat, disease onset was considerably later, 7 to 8 days after cell transfer, as opposed to 4 days in Lewis. This lag phase between inoculation and disease onset could not be further reduced even by raising the cell dose to 50 X 10(6) cells/host. The fine specificity of the T cell response to P2 differs between Lewis- and BN-derived T cell lines. At least one neuritogenic epitope for each strain was present in the cyanogen bromide-derived peptide CB2 (residues 21-113), as shown by the ability of CB2-specific T cell lines derived from each strain to transfer EAN to the appropriate host strain. However, neuritogenic BN T lines fail to mount a response to the sequence 53-78 (SP4), which encompasses an epitope that is neuritogenic for Lewis rats. These results demonstrate that the resistance of BN rats to actively induced EAN is not due to the lack of appropriate P2-specific autoreactive T cell clones in the normal T repertoire. Furthermore, the results suggest that two distinct epitopes of P2 are responsible for EAN in Lewis and BN rats.\r"

Antibody levels to DM-20 were not related to the clinical signs. Five of 11 BALB/c nude mice reconstituted with T cells developed similar clinical and pathologic signs.

  ".W": "We report that resting human peripheral blood natural killer (NK) cells proliferate in response to recombinant interleukin 2 (rIL 2), and addition of irradiated lymphoblastoid B cells significantly increase their proliferative response. Interaction of IL 2 with the Tac IL 2 receptor expressed on activated NK cells is necessary to maintain continued growth of these cells. Experiments in which NK cell mitosis is prevented by colchicine show that the majority of peripheral blood NK cells are induced into the first cell cycle over a 6-day culture period in the presence of rIL 2. The addition of the irradiated lymphoblastoid B cell line, Daudi, to colchicine blocked cultures does not increase the proportion of cells entering cell cycle in response to rIL 2 alone. In limiting dilution analysis, only 1/1700 B73.1+ cells grow clonally in response to rIL 2. The frequency of clonal growth of NK cells in response to irradiated Daudi cells alone is minimal, whereas the addition of irradiated Daudi cells to rIL 2 stimulated cultures resulted in a 10-fold increase in clonal frequency compared with the cultures in rIL 2 alone. Therefore, Daudi cells may act by maintaining continuous proliferation of the NK cells originally responsive to IL 2. Unlike NK cells, only a minimal proportion of peripheral blood T cells proliferate in response to IL 2. These IL 2 responsive T cells are characterized by a lower bouyant density than the majority of peripheral blood T cells. These results indicate physiologic differences between peripheral blood resting NK and T cells in their ability to be induced to cycle. IL 2 is a growth factor for both cell types, but although the presence of the growth factor is sufficient for quiescent NK cells to be induced into cycle, T cells require antigenic or other mitogenic stimuli to respond to IL 2. The small proportion of light density IL 2 responsive T cells might represent in vivo activated T cells.\r"

  ".W": "The growth and differentiation of B cells to immunoglobulin (Ig)-secreting cells is regulated by a variety of soluble factors. This study presents data that support a role for transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta in this regulatory process. B lymphocytes were shown to have high-affinity receptors for TGF-beta that were increased fivefold to sixfold after in vitro activation. The addition of picogram quantities of TGF-beta to B cell cultures suppressed factor-dependent, interleukin 2 (IL 2) B cell proliferation and markedly suppressed factor-dependent (IL 2 or B cell differentiation factor) B cell Ig secretion. In contrast, the constitutive IgG production by an Epstein Barr virus-transformed B cell line was not modified by the presence of TGF-beta in culture. This cell line was found to lack high-affinity TGF-beta receptors. The degree of inhibition of B cell proliferation observed in in vitro cultures was found to be dependent not only on the concentration of TGF-beta added but also on the concentration of the growth stimulatory substance (IL 2) present. By increasing the IL 2 concentrations in culture, the inhibition of proliferation induced by TGF-beta could be partially overcome. In contrast, the inhibition of Ig secretion induced by TGF-beta could not be overcome by a higher concentration of stimulatory factor, demonstrating that the suppression of B cell differentiation by TGF-beta is not due solely to its effects on proliferation. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that B lymphocytes secrete TGF-beta. Unactivated tonsillar B cells had detectable amounts of TGF-beta mRNA on Northern blot analysis, and B cell activation with Staphylococcus aureus Cowan (SAC) resulted in a twofold to threefold increase in TGF-beta mRNA. Supernatants conditioned by unactivated B cells had small amounts of TGF-beta, SAC activation of the B cells resulted in a sixfold to sevenfold increase in the amount of TGF-beta present in the supernatants. Thus, B lymphocytes synthesize and secrete TGF-beta and express receptors for TGF-beta. The addition of exogenous TGF-beta to cultures of stimulated B cells inhibits subsequent proliferation and Ig secretion. TGF-beta may function as an autocrine growth inhibitor that limits B lymphocyte proliferation and ultimate differentiation.\r"

T helper cell clones and a T cell hybridoma induced macrophages to express mIL 1 after an antigen-specific, Ia-restricted interaction. Induction of mIL 1 was proportional to antigen concentration and was increased in the early course of the response in macrophages pretreated in culture with interferon-gamma. mIL 1 activity was detectable 4 hr after interaction with T cells. mIL 1 induction was inhibited by antibodies to either class II molecules or the T cell receptor. Two pathways of T cell-mediated mIL 1 induction could be defined. In the first, T cells, whose protein synthesizing capacity was completely eliminated by pretreatment with the irreversible protein synthesis inhibitor emetine, induced levels of mIL 1 expression indistinguishable from controls. In the second, T cells stimulated by paraformaldehyde-fixed macrophages in the presence of concanavalin A or antigen secreted a soluble factor that induced macrophage mIL 1 expression. Thus, it appears that T cells may induce macrophages to express mIL 1 both by direct cell-cell contact mediated through binding of T cell receptor to the Ia/antigen complex, and through the release of a lymphokine after activation. This lymphokine does not appear to be IL 2, IFN-gamma, BSF-1, or CSF-1.\r"

  ".W": "Studies of immune recognition of hybrid class I antigens expressed on transfected cells have revealed an apparent general requirement that the N(alpha 1) and C1(alpha 2) domains be derived from the same gene in order to preserve recognition by virus-specific H-2-restricted and allospecific T cells. One exception has been the hybrid DL antigen in which the N domain of H-2Ld has been replaced by that of H-2Dd. Cells bearing this molecule serve as targets for some virus and allospecific CTL. Because cells expressing the reciprocal hybrid LD (N domain of H-2Dd replaced by that of H-2Ld) antigen have not been available, it has not been possible to evaluate whether this exception stemmed from the relatedness of H-2Ld and H-2Dd or whether the DL antigen fortuitously preserved some function of the parent molecule as a rare exception. To assess this question, and to evaluate the contribution of the N and C1 domains of H-2Ld and H-2Dd to serologic and T cell recognition, we have constructed the reciprocal chimeric gene pLD (the N exon of H-2Ld substituted for that of H-2Dd), introduced this into mouse L cells by DNA-mediated gene transfer, and analyzed the expressed product biochemically, serologically, and functionally. Transformant L cells expressing either LD or DL antigens were both reactive with a number of anti-H-2Ld or anti-H-2Dd N/C1-specific monoclonal antibodies, indicating the preservation in the hybrid molecules of determinants controlled by discrete domains. Mab binding was generally greater with cells expressing hybrid DL antigen than with those transformants expressing LD molecules. Moreover, the amount of beta 2M associated with DL antigens was more than that associated with LD. Cells expressing hybrid DL antigens were recognized as targets by bulk and cloned allospecific anti-H-2Dd and anti-H-2Ld CTL, whereas cells expressing LD molecules were not recognized by any of the T cells tested. VSV-specific H-2Ld-restricted CTL failed to lyse VSV-infected targets expressing either DL or LD. These results indicate that T cell reactivity of cells expressing the DL hybrid antigen is an exception to the observed general requirement for class I antigens to possess matched N and C1 domains for functional T cell recognition by T cells restricted to parental antigens.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Large numbers of functional mast cells were obtained by bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) of Macaca arctoides monkeys that had been infected with the nematode Ascaris suum. These lavage cells, of which 21% were mast cells, released histamine, LTC4, and PGD2 in a concentration-dependent fashion when challenged with ascaris antigen or antibody to human IgE. However, there was no release of histamine when these cells were challenged with compound 48/80. The amount of mediator released was highly dependent on the sensitivity of the cells to immunologic challenge, but was generally in the range of 2 to 5 micrograms histamine (30 to 70% of total), 20 to 80 ng LTC4, and 100 to 300 ng PGD2 per 10(6) mast cells when maximally challenged. Other eicosanoids measured were released only in much smaller quantities. Maximal values were 4 ng LTB4, 2 ng PGE2, and approximately 10 to 20 ng PGF2 alpha per 10(6) mast cells. The amount of LTC4 and PGD2 released correlated with the release of histamine, the calculated regression line indicating that 18 ng LTC4 and 50 ng PGD2 were released per microgram of histamine released. This correlation suggests that the majority of the LTC4 and PGD2 released was probably mast cell-derived. Further support for this conclusion was given by the observation that when lavage cells were fractioned on continuous Percoll gradients, the ability to release LTC4 and PGD2 on immunologic challenge coincided with the peak of mast cells.\r"

We examined the specificity of CTL generated against MuLV-induced tumors and identified two distinct patterns of reactivity. The first follows the traditional pattern of FMR vs GCSA reactivity as assessed on a panel of established MuLV-induced lymphomas. However, CTL exhibiting this pattern of reactivity are incapable of lysing MuLV-infected fibroblasts. CTL exhibiting the second pattern of reactivity are capable of lysing MuLV-induced lymphomas as well as MuLV-infected fibroblasts. In addition, these CTL exhibit extensive cross-reactivity between lymphomas and fibroblasts infected by both groups of MuLV. Our results suggest that CTL exhibiting the traditional FMR vs GCSA pattern of reactivity are directed against a tumor-associated antigen and not against virus-encoded antigens, and that CTL directed against MuLV-encoded antigens demonstrate extensive cross-reactivity, including the ability to lyse AKV-infected cells.\r"

We describe here the use of recombinant vaccinia viruses, containing cDNA corresponding to either the nucleoprotein (N) gene or the major surface glycoprotein (G) gene of human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), to examine the antigen specificity of anti-RSV cytotoxic T cells from humans and mice. The results demonstrate that the RSV N protein is one of the target antigens for CTL in man and mouse, whereas the G protein was not recognized and can at best represent a minor target antigen for CTL.\r"

  ".U": "87059013\r", 
  ".W": "Mammalian T lymphocytes mature in the thymus through a series of differentiation events that involve both rapid proliferation and extensive cell death. The mechanisms that govern these processes are currently unknown; however, both mitogenesis and death affect particular subpopulations of cells, suggesting the selective amplification and destruction of specific T cell clones. In mature peripheral T cells, proliferation is most commonly triggered by the recognition of antigen through the T cell antigen receptor complex. If antigen recognition also controls proliferation in the thymus, the differential expression of antigen receptor genes during maturation could play some role in determining the fate of developing T cells. In this study, we examined the expression of the alpha- and beta-chain genes of the T cell antigen receptor in different subpopulations of adult thymocytes. We compared two postmitotic populations--one that appears committed to die and one that appears mature--and several blast cell populations that are enriched for precursors of one or another presumptive lineage. We have found that Lyt-2-, L3T4- precursor thymocytes express much lower levels of both alpha- and beta-chain mRNA than the cells likely to be their immediate descendents. Furthermore, our results show that the cells of the major cortical lineage, which have at least a 95% probability of death, nevertheless express high levels of mature mRNA encoding both the alpha- and the beta-chains of the T cell antigen receptor. These results have important implications for the mechanisms involved in the overproduction and elimination of this major class of T lymphocyte.\r"

S49.1 expressed both Kd and Dd, T-25 and T-25ADH expressed Dd but not Kd or Ld, Thy-1- expressed Kd but not Dd or Ld, and 100.0 did not express any detectable amounts of Kd, Dd, or Ld.

  ".U": "87059021\r", 
  ".W": "The incidence of lupus nephritis is low in autoimmune NZB mice, but when they are crossed with normal SWR mice, almost 100% of the female F1 hybrids (SNF1) develop lethal glomerulonephritis. In a previous study we showed that anti-DNA auto-antibodies produced by the SNF1 mice were qualitatively different from those made by the NZB parents with respect to their isotype, charge, and antigenic specificity patterns. Here we studied idiotypic cross-reactions among the 65 monoclonal anti-DNA antibodies that were derived from four NZB and seven SNF1 mice. A library of 15 anti-idiotypic antibodies were prepared by immunizing rabbits with 15 monoclonal anti-DNA antibodies selected from the panel of 65. We identified 10 cross-reactive idiotype (CRI) families among this large collection of autoantibodies. Five of these CRI families were restricted to cationic anti-DNA antibodies that were exclusively of SNF1 origin, and the strongly cross-reacting members were predominantly IgG2b auto-antibodies with the allotype of the normal SWR parent. The cationic anti-DNA CRI families could be grouped into an interrelated cluster called the Id564 cluster. The other five anti-DNA CRI families were not restricted to any particular parental allotype or charge, although two of these CRI were shared exclusively by SNF1-derived autoantibodies and four of these CRI families could also be grouped into an idiotypically interrelated cluster called the Id512 cluster. In the case of seven out of the 10 CRI families, the idiotypic determinants detected were close to the antigen-binding site of the anti-DNA antibodies. The results indicate that the idiotypic repertoire of anti-DNA autoantibodies produced by the SNF1 mice is different from the NZB parents, and potentially pathogenic (cationic) antibodies produced by the SNF1 mice that are encoded by genes from the normal SWR parent can be identified as distinct CRI families. In the accompanying paper we demonstrate the role of these anti-DNA CRI families in the development of lupus nephritis.\r"

In the preceding paper we found qualitative and idiotypic differences between the anti-DNA antibodies produced by the SNF1 mice and their NZB parents. We identified two clusters of interrelated cross-reactive idiotypic (CRI) families among the SNF1-derived autoantibodies. Here we analyzed the idiotypic profile of the broad spectrum of immunoglobulins deposited in the nephritic kidneys of SNF1 mice and found a restricted idiotypic diversity. To establish that the autoantibody idiotypes detected in the renal lesions were not there as a result of nonspecific trapping, five separate batches of kidney eluates obtained from 100 SNF1 kidneys were analyzed. Both during early and late stages of nephritis, the predominant and consistent idiotypic markers of antibodies in the renal lesion of SNF1 mice were those shared by the two clusters of anti-DNA CRI families. We have termed these nephritogenic idiotypic markers collectively as idiotypes-lupus nephritis-SNF1 or IdLNF1. The Id564 family that encompasses a set of SNF1-derived highly cationic anti-DNA antibodies bearing the normal SWR parent's allotype was more prominently represented in the SNF1 kidneys with early nephritis. Although cationic antibodies were prevalent, the IdLNF1 markers were present on both cationic and anionic or neutral antibodies in the renal lesions of SNF1 mice, and the Ig allotypes of both parents were equally represented in those nephritogenic antibodies. The IdLNF1 positive family of antibodies were also found in high levels in the sera of old SNF1 mice, but they could not be detected in the sera of NZB or SWR mice, nor were they present in the immunoglobulins deposited in the kidneys of rare old NZB mice. The results suggest that select families of nephritogenic idiotypes that are dormant in the autoimmune NZB and the normal SWR parents become expressed in the SNF1 progeny due to genetic and immunoregulatory defects.\r"

One line responded to major PLP, and another responded to both major PLP and DM-20, which are the two major intrinsic membrane proteins of the central nervous system (CNS) myelin. Intraperitoneal inoculation of 4 to 30 X 10(6) PLP-activated line cells followed by injection of pertussis vaccine induced acute inflammatory disease of the CNS, with typical clinical signs of EAE mostly in a week in recipient mice that had been treated with low-dose irradiation. Almost all animals recovered completely, and two of the 12 animals relapsed 42 or 75 days after inoculation. The lesions were restricted to the CNS and were characterized by perivascular and parenchymal infiltration of inflammatory cells, fibrin deposit, and demyelination. In the severe lesions, axons were also damaged. These observations suggest that PLP is a definite encephalitogen, and PLP-sensitized effector T cells induce inflammatory demyelination in the CNS.\r"

  ".W": "The ability to predict T cell antigenic peptides would have important implications for the development of artificial vaccines. As a first step towards prediction, this report uses a new statistical technique to discover and evaluate peptide properties correlating with T cell antigenicity. This technique employs Monte Carlo computer experiments and is applicable to many problems involving protein or DNA. The technique is used to evaluate the contribution of various peptide properties to helper T cell antigenicity. The properties investigated include amphipathicities (alpha and beta), conformational propensities (alpha, beta, turn and coil), and the correlates of alpha-helices, such as the absence of helix-breakers and the positioning of the residues which stabilize alpha-helical dipoles. We also investigate segmental amphipathicity. (A peptide has this property when it contains at least two disjoint subpeptides, one hydrophobic, one hydrophilic.) Statistical correlations and stratifications assessed independent contributions to T cell antigenicity. The findings presented here have important implications for the manufacture of peptide vaccines. These implications are as follows: if possible, peptide vaccines should probably be those protein segments which have a propensity to form amphipathic alpha-helices, which do not have regions with a propensity to coil conformations, and which have a lysine at their COOH-terminus. The last two observations are of particular use in manufacturing peptides vaccines: they indicate where the synthetic peptides should be terminated. These implications are supported by the findings given below. The significances (p values) support the following statistical generalites about antigenic conformations: most helper T cell antigenic sites are amphipathic alpha-helices; alpha-helical amphipathicity and propensity to an alpha-helical conformation contribute independently to T cell antigenicity; there is evidence that some T cell antigenic sites are beta conformations instead of alpha-helices; T cell antigenic sites avoid random coiled conformations; and T cell antigenic sites are usually not segmentally amphipathic. alpha-Helical amphipathicity was significant, but segmental amphipathicity was not. This has implications for the dimensions of the structure interacting with the hydrophobic portion of an amphipathic T cell antigenic site. Lysines are unusually frequent at the COOH-terminal of T cell antigenic sites, even after accounting for tryptic digests. These lysines can stabilize alpha-helical peptides by a favorable interaction with alpha-helical dipoles.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "To gain a better understanding of the diversity of epitopes on a protein, the specificities of 103 monoclonal antibodies to a model antigen, horse cytochrome c(cyt c), were analyzed. The antibodies were generated in in vitro monoclonal, secondary antibody responses against horse cyt c coupled to hemocyanin in splenic fragment cultures. For this assay, horse cyt c-primed murine B lymphocytes were transferred to irradiated, hemocyanin-primed recipients. A panel of seven mammalian cyts c differing at one to six residues out of 104 and cyanogen bromide-cleaved fragments of horse cyt c containing residues 1-65, 1-80, and 66-104 was used to examine the specificities of the antibodies. Twenty-two distinct reactivity patterns were observed, even though the majority of the monoclonal antibodies were found to bind in the three previously identified antigenic regions of the molecule about residues 44-47, 60-62, and 89-92. The results indicate that each of the three antigenic regions consists of multiple overlapping epitopes. Few of the antibodies directed to any given antigenic region bound polypeptide fragments inclusive of the epitope sequences, demonstrating that some antibodies were more conformationally dependent than others. Only 13% of the antibodies bound to cyanogen bromide-cleaved polypeptide fragments that together encompassed the entire length of the protein. Considering the large number of antibodies analyzed and the reoccurrence of 13 of the 22 clonotypes in different lymphocyte donors, it is likely that the antibody specificities tabulated herein approach yet do not completely enumerate the total inventory of the horse cyt c-specific B cell repertoire. The remarkable diversity for epitope recognition within antigenic regions observed here is likely to pertain to protein antigens in general, and strongly supports the widely held notion that the entire surface of a protein is potentially antigenic. The restriction of the epitopes of horse cyt c to three antigenic regions where the amino acid sequences of the mammalian cyts c differ probably results from tolerance of the mice to their own cyt c.\r"

TABM were detected at low levels in sera from nonimmune and immune mice. Amounts of TABM rose 300-fold in MBSA-immune mice within 12 hr of a desensitizing injection of MBSA, and rapidly returned to pre-desensitization levels. Serum TABM were purified by precipitation with 50% (NH4)2SO4 and chromatography in carboxymethylcellulose. The purified TABM were Mr 30,000 to 37,000 reduced, 72,000 nonreduced, and had a pI range of 5.5 to 7.1. A portion of the elevated TABM in desensitized mice bound MBSA specifically, whereas TABM from the sera of nonimmune/nondesensitized mice did not bind MBSA. The timing of the appearance of TABM early in desensitization suggests the possibility that they may play a role in the subsequent appearance of suppressor cells in later stages of this phenomenon. In addition, the results presented here raise the possibility that fluctuations in TABM levels might prove to be a sensitive indicator of immunoregulatory status in general.\r"

The amino terminal portion of this molecule can also be expressed as an integral membrane protein by splicing the 5' end of the Q10 gene to the 3' end of H-2Ld and transfecting the hybrid gene into murine L cells. Because CTL primarily recognize polymorphic determinants controlled by the alpha 1 and alpha 2 domains of class I molecules and because the Q10d/Ld product expressed by transfected L cells includes the alpha 1 and alpha 2 domains of Q10d, we could address whether mice bearing serum Q10 were tolerant to this molecule at the CTL level. The results of these experiments demonstrate that Q10+ mice are able to generate H-2-unrestricted CTL activity against Q10d expressed on transfected L cells, and this response was not inhibitable by the addition of Q10-containing normal mouse serum. It is unlikely that this CTL activity is due to possible polymorphic differences in Q10 alleles, since semisyngeneic BALB/c (H-2d) mice, from which the Q10d hybrid gene construct was derived, are able to generate anti-Q10d effector cells. The Q10d molecule was shown to cross-react with H-2Ld, lending support to the concept that Qa genes can serve as donors for polymorphic sequences found in H-2K, -D, and -L. That mice can generate anti-Q10 CTL activity suggests that this soluble class I protein does not act as a toleragen for these cells. The implications of these findings for an understanding of self-tolerance are discussed.\r"

  ".W": "Interleukin (IL 1) preparations from five different sources (human monocyte, LPS-stimulated, purified IL 1 from two different laboratories) and human recombinant IL 1 (HrIL 1) were shown to be capable of directly inducing histamine (HA) release from human basophils (10 to 50% of total cellular HA, depending on the source of IL 1). The release was not due to the medium, pyrogens, or other contaminants. Il 1-induced HA release was dose dependent between 1 to 100 U/ml of IL 1 and 1 to 15 ng/ml of HrIL 1 and was rapid, with a peak release at 15 min. HA release induced by IL 1 was blocked completely by preexposure of cells to IL 1 but was not affected by prechallenge with anti-IgE. Also, preincubation of IL 1 with anti-IL 1 antibody abolished the HA-releasing activity. IL 1-induced HA release was also observed in preparations of human adenoidal mast cells. Our data indicate that it is unlikely that the HA release induced by IL 1 is due to a contamination with HA-releasing factor. This effect of IL 1 provides a mechanism for non-IgE-related local HA release and raises the possibility of a link between cellular immunity and immediate hypersensitivity of potential importance for the pathology of immuno/inflammatory diseases.\r"

Because of the importance of cytoskeletal elements in cellular functions, we examined the content and the state of polymerization of actin in lymphocytes from Fischer F344 rats of four different ages (6, 14, 23, and 31 mo). The cellular actin content was determined by a DNAase I inhibition assay. Our results indicate that the total actin content of spleen lymphocytes did not change significantly with age; however, polymeric actin content, particularly in T cells, decreased with age, which might be a result of the shift from the polymeric actin pool to the monomeric pool. Similar changes also occurred in B cells but to a lesser extent. We conclude that the state of polymerization of lymphocytes changed drastically with age, and that this might be an important factor in the age-related decline in the cellular functions of lymphocytes.\r"

  ".W": "Evidence for maternal immune recognition of the fetus can be found during pregnancy, yet the conceptus remains unharmed. Indeed, in some cases immunizing the mother with cells sharing histocompatibility antigens with the fetus is beneficial to fetal survival. This could be due to the effect of maternally derived lymphokines on placental growth and function, according to the immunostimulation hypothesis. We demonstrate here that placental cells in culture proliferate upon the addition of T cell-derived lymphokines. The lymphokine activity has been separated from IL 2 and B cell growth factor, and copurified with IL 3 and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (CSF-GM). Recombinant CSF-GM and recombinant IL 3 showed a similar effect. The placental cells that proliferate in culture are of fetal origin and are characterized by strong adherence, phagocytosis, nonspecific esterase staining, and response to the macrophage-specific colony-stimulating factor CSF-1. In addition, treatment of pregnant females with anti-thymocyte serum as well as anti-Ly-2.1 monoclonal antibody, at gestational times before Ly-2 antigen appearance in the fetus, leads to a reduction of the proliferative and phagocytic capacity of day 12 placentae. These results clearly demonstrate that maternal T cells act upon fetally derived placental cells to improve their proliferative and phagocytic potential, and thus provide evidence for the immunostimulatory role of these cells during pregnancy.\r"

All three lines were selected for with antigen and represent two allospecific cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) clones and a major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-restricted clone specific for a murine minor histocompatibility antigen. On long-term in vitro culture, IEL clones gradually lost antigen-specific lytic activity and simultaneously acquired the capacity to lyse natural killer (NK)-sensitive target cells which, in some cases, required high-level lymphokine activation. Of interest was the finding that, despite changes in lytic specificity, IEL clones remained strictly antigen-dependent for proliferation. A murine CTL clone of splenic origin, which was propagated under culture conditions identical to those used for IEL, did not exhibit changes in lytic specificity, suggesting that acquired changes in IEL function cannot be attributed solely to the influence of in vitro culture. Phenotypic analyses of IEL clones with altered lytic specificity revealed that all lines remained Thy-1+, Lyt-2+, L3T4-, with or without lytic activation by lymphokines. The expression of CT-1, a murine CTL activation antigen, and asialo GM1, a murine NK cell marker, were variable on IEL clones, and their presence did not correlate with the changes in lytic behavior. Collectively, these findings provide evidence, at the clonal level, that at least some NK activity present in isolates of murine IEL may originate from antigen-specific CTL. The data also indicate that, on binding antigen, different signals are conveyed to T cells, resulting in proliferation or target cell lysis.\r"

To synchronize lethal hit delivery in a suspension of effector and target cells, a modification of the cation pulse method in which Ca2+ is added to preformed conjugates of CTL and target cells was used. Conjugate formation was unaffected by the absence of extracellular Ca2+ under these conditions. Lytic activity of these cloned CTL was markedly reduced in the absence of extracellular Ca2+ and was restored upon Ca2+ repletion. When indo-1-loaded CTL were preincubated with target cells in the absence of extracellular Ca2+, a marked antigen-specific increase in indo-1 fluorescence, indicative of an increase in intracellular Ca2+, was observed after repletion of extracellular Ca2+. This increase in intracellular Ca2+ was shown to be due solely to changes in the CTL and not the target cell within the time course of the experiment, and results from the influx of extracellular Ca2+. Antibody to the T cell receptor for antigen also evokes a similar increase in intracellular Ca2+ in CTL under these conditions. This method provides a means for the direct examination of the response of CTL to cellular antigen as well as soluble antibody and is a versatile and valuable tool for the study of CTL function.\r"

Serum from 23 of 50 healthy young adults had no bactericidal effect (BE) against Hib yet opsonized these organisms for approximately 30% uptake by polymorphonuclear leukocytes. The degree of bactericidal and opsonizing activity in serum from the other 27 subjects generally correlated with the level of antibody to PRP but not to LOS or OMP. However, serum from some individuals had levels of antibody to PRP as high as 4.9 micrograms/ml without BE, and seven of 27 subjects with BE had antibody levels of less than 1 microgram/ml. After vaccination with 20 micrograms of conjugated PRP, the level of antibody to PRP was greater than 5 micrograms/ml in all 50 subjects. BE appeared in 22 of those who originally lacked it, and opsonization increased to approximately 50%.\r"

Antiviral activity also appeared in fresh milk stored at 4 C for at least two days. The antiviral activity, which reduced titers of virus by as much as 10,000-fold, only affected enveloped viruses and was localized in the milk lipid fraction. Its appearance in stored milk was apparently due to fatty acids released by the activity of milk lipases, particularly lipoprotein lipase. Antiviral activity in the infants' stomach, however, most likely resulted from the activity of gastric and lingual lipases on milk triglycerides and caused the release of antiviral fatty acids. Milk and stomach contents that were antiviral also lysed cultured cells by disruption of their plasma membrane. Cell lysis was also caused by purified linoleic acid, which is a normal constituent of human milk triglycerides.\r"

In the present study we found that 13 of a group of 17 (76%) seropositive patients with rheumatoid arthritis had lymphocytes that possessed 1,25(OH)2D3 receptors (without activation in vitro) compared with only three of 17 (18%) normal individuals. The biochemical characteristics of the 1,25(OH)2D3 receptor, including affinity, sedimentation coefficient, and DNA-binding properties in the rheumatoid arthritis lymphocytes were indistinguishable from those established for this receptor in the classic target tissue of the hormone.

  ".U": "87059949\r", 
  ".W": "To address the problem of historically poor results in the treatment of children with advanced-stage Burkitt's lymphoma and B cell (SIg+) acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), an intensive chemotherapy regimen was devised using the most effective single agents in high-dose short courses. Treatment commenced with a fractionated schedule of intravenous (IV) cyclophosphamide (300 mg/m2 every 12 hours for six doses) followed immediately by Adriamycin (50 mg/m2) and vincristine (1.5 mg/m2) with combined intrathecal (IT) methotrexate and cytarabine. Predictably, this treatment produced virtually complete disappearance of all tumor and profound myelosuppression. Immediately on hematologic recovery, IV high-dose methotrexate (1,000 mg/m2 over 24 hours) followed by IV cytarabine (400 mg/m2 over the next 48 hours) was administered with leucovorin rescue and repeated IT treatments. The treatment sequence described above is repeated four times, with the dose of cytarabine doubled in succeeding courses, up to 3,200 mg/m2. The entire planned therapy required approximately 24 weeks. Since 1981, we treated a total of 29 children with this approach, 19 of whom had massive unresectable intraabdominal tumor. According to initial extent of disease, 17 were classified as stage III, four as stage IV non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), and eight as B cell ALL. Eight of the 12 patients with stage IV NHL or B cell ALL had initial involvement of the CNS. Twenty-seven of 29 patients (93%) attained a complete remission. Fourteen of 17 stage III NHL patients remain disease free, for periods ranging from 3+ months to 4 1/2+ years. The actuarial estimate of the proportion of stage III patients remaining disease free at 2 years is 81%. Results in patients with initial involvement of the CNS and/or marrow are much less favorable, with only two of ten patients who attained remission apparently being cured. In addition to stage, the initial serum lactic dehydrogenase (LDH) level emerged as a prognostic indicator, higher levels (over 1,000 IU/L) being associated with the worst prognosis (P less than .05). Major toxicity consisted of severe hematopoietic suppression and febrile episodes associated with neutropenia. We conclude that this treatment is highly effective for advanced-stage Burkitt's tumors in children free of initial CNS involvement.\r"

This study reports brain imaging obtained with 99mTc-d,1 HM-PAO in 20 subjects; seven without evidence of cerebral disease and 13 with cerebrovascular disorders. In 16 patients comparative data were available with N,N,N'-trimethyl-N'-(2-hydroxy-3-methyl-5-iodobenzyl)-1,3-propanediamine ([123I]HIPDM). Technetium-99m-d, 1-HM-PAO is retained sufficiently long to allow single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) with widely available rotating gamma camera systems. The kinetics demonstrated a rapid brain uptake and prolonged retention of activity in cerebral structures. Good tomographic images are obtained with much higher uptake in gray than in white matter. Blood flow maps are comparable to those achieved with [123I]HIPDM and established strokes were clearly seen, with similar details as in HIPDM studies. Delayed studies showed that the distribution in the brain remained virtually unchanged. Technetium-99m-d, 1-HM-PAO imaging appears particularly promising in routine examination of patients with cerebrovascular disorders.\r"

  ".W": "Positron imaging provides tomographic images of regional myocardial perfusion but has required an on-site cyclotron. Rubidium-82 (82Rb) is a short-lived (T1/2 = 75 sec) positron emitter available from a generator. In order to determine the feasibility for its use to image acute myocardial infarction, 18 patients with transmural infarctions who had coronary arteriography were given 30-40 mCi of 82Rb intravenously and positron tomographic imaging was carried out within 96 hr after onset of symptoms. Nine simultaneous transaxial slices were obtained for each patient with a positron camera. Images were also reconstructed in a long-axis, short-axis, and three-dimensional display. One study could not be interpreted because of excessive lung activity. Fourteen normals were also studied. The infarct related artery determined by angiography was correctly diagnosed by positron imaging in all 17 patients as were all three prior infarcts by readers blinded to the clinical data. No defects were observed in normals or in noninfarcted myocardial regions. This study indicates that 82Rb should be useful for perfusion imaging in patients with acute myocardial infarction. The short half-life of 82Rb should make it ideal for providing serial assessment of perfusion in patients undergoing thrombolytic therapy.\r"

The false-negative defects were located mainly in the inferior wall, apicoinferior wall, or high anterior wall. When the patients were moved half the slice interval to perform the interpolating scan, and the two sets of images were interlaced with each other, the detectability increased to 88%. The interpolating scan also allowed reconstruction of long-axis and short-axis tomograms in high quality, which further improved the detectability of perfusion defects (100% for RCA or LAD and 75% for LCX lesion) and helped in understanding the anatomic relationships to the coronary artery territories.\r"

Accordingly, 1 yr after testing we contacted 819 patients without previous MI or CABG seen in our laboratory during a 2-yr period. Events were defined as death from a cardiovascular cause, nonfatal MI, or worsening clinical state requiring CABG. The event rate was 3.9 events per 100 patients per year. There was univariate prognostic information when comparing the highest and lowest categories as risk ratios for chest pain characteristics (2.7), sex (2.3), exercise duration (3.1), ST slope (2.5), and thallium pattern (11.6), intensity of perfusion defect (17.2), and number of abnormal regions (8.7). However, the strongest predictors were also the least common. Prognostic ability was improved by combining the results categorically, as the number of abnormal tests (13.9). The highest risk ratio, 20.5:1, was obtained by combining results through discriminant function analysis. We conclude that exercise thallium scintigraphy provides prognostic information, although the most predictive patterns are uncommon. Combining the results of multiple test results improves the prognostic ability.\r"

The ratio of carrier affinity for G and CMG was reported to be 1.11. By simultaneously measuring CMG concentration in plasma and in cerebral cortex in vivo with positron tomography at 1-min intervals for 40 min, two time-activity curves are obtained, as reported previously, which together with the G concentration in plasma yield the in vivo rate constants of G transport across the blood-brain barrier and the rate of G inflow; a repeat measurement at a different G concentration in plasma gives the in vivo Michaelis-Menten constant KM and the maximal rate of transport VMAX. The present paper summarizes and extends this approach to analyzing the free G pool in tissue, the rate of G return to circulation, and the rate of G exit into metabolism with its corresponding rate constants. The data from six volunteers agreed with results reported for the individual biochemical parameters in primate brains.\r"

These studies demonstrated two unique findings concerning the in vivo distribution of this neuroleptic: (a) it is tightly bound to dopamine D-2 receptors in the caudate-putamen brain regions, and (b) these regions are the only large brain structures which exhibit appreciable long-term retention. In addition, radioactivity clears rapidly from plasma, and the percentage of unchanged [18F]-N-methylspiroperidol in plasma declines rapidly. These results suggest that this compound binds irreversibly to dopamine D-2 receptors, and that there are few if any dopamine D-2 receptors in the human frontal cortex. These studies emphasize not only the importance of characterizing neurotransmitter receptors in living human brain using a ligand labeled with a positron emitting nuclide of sufficiently long half-life to allow monitoring of brain radioactivity distribution for several hours after the injection of radioligand, but also of accurately determining the amount of unchanged tracer in plasma for tracer kinetic modeling.\r"

The effects of larger magnetic fields on an Anger camera, were made in fields up to 10 G. Sensitivity and positional stability were studied as a function of gantry angle in a magnetic field. Scans of uniform and hot rod sections of and ECT phantom were also performed. No visible artifacts were found in reconstructions of the phantom measured in a 5-G magnetic field, although some small sensitivity and linearity effects did exist. In 10-G fields, planar and reconstructed images were grossly distorted. Magnetic shielding placed across the collimator reduced the influence of the magnetic field but at a cost in sensitivity that varies with photon energy.\r"

  ".W": "A technique for the semiautomatic calculation of left ventricular volumes from multigated blood-pool tomograms (MGBPT) was tested in a series of 12 patients undergoing contrast ventriculography within 48 hr of gated tomography. The parameters necessary for the calculation of volume were developed in a chest phantom study performed with a series of 99mTc-filled balloons representing the right and left ventricles. The images were analyzed for volume using a percentage of peak count-threshold of the left ventricular balloon. This technique resulted in a correlation of r = 0.99 of the calculated to the true phantom volumes (y = 0.87x + 27.4, p less than 0.01, s.e.e. = 7.87 ml). The patient studies were recorded at 16 frames/cardiac cycle at each of 60 angles over a 360 degree rotation. Reconstructed data were presented in an endless loop cine format producing a set of sequential \"beating tomographic slices\" in the transverse, apical four-chamber, short-axis, and long-axis oblique views. Measurements of end systolic volume (y = 0.79x + 30, r = 0.93, p less than 0.001, s.e.e. = 24 ml), end-diastolic volume (y = 0.63x + 60, r = 0.94, p less than 0.0001, s.e.e. = 20 ml) and ejection fraction (y = 0.88x - 0.02, r = 0.92, p less than 0.001, s.e.e. = 0.08) determined from the semiautomated volume method correlated well with those determined by left ventricular contrast angiography. A qualitative comparison of MGBPT, planar imaging, and left ventricular angiography in 12 patients revealed that the visual assessment of wall motion using the 16-frame tomographic slices had significant advantages over planar and single plane angiographic data in the identification of inferior, basal, and septal wall motion abnormalities as well as the extent of involvement by aneurysm formation. A quantitative comparison of wall motion in the long-axis oblique view of the MGBPT to the RAO 30 degree ventriculogram (y = 0.74x + 8.7, r = 0.82, p less than 0.0001, s.e.e. = 14%) confirmed the qualitative similarity of these two views. We conclude that MGBPT is promising as a method for accurately measuring left ventricular volumes and assessing regional wall motion.\r"

  ".W": "Fibronectin is found in plasma as well as in association with connective tissue and cell surfaces. Depletion of plasma fibronectin is often observed in septic trauma and burned patients, while experimental rats often manifest hyperfibronectinemia with sepsis. Since Factor XIII may influence the rate of clearance and deposition of plasma fibronectin into tissues, we evaluated the temporal changes in plasma fibronectin and plasma Factor XIII following bacteremia and RE blockade in rats in an attempt to understand the mechanism leading to elevation of fibronectin levels in bacteremic rats, which is distinct from that observed with RE blockade. Clearance of exogenously administered fibronectin after bacteremia was also determined. Rats received either saline, Pseudomonas aeruginosa (1 X 10(9) organisms), gelatinized RE test lipid emulsion (50 mg/100 gm B.W.), or emulsion followed by Pseudomonas. Plasma fibronectin and Factor XIII were determined at 0, 2, 24, and 48 hours post-blockade or bacteremia. At 24 and 48 hr following bacteremia alone or bacteremia after RE blockade, there was a significant elevation (p less than 0.05) of plasma fibronectin and a concomitant decrease (p less than 0.05) of plasma factor XIII activity. Extractable tissue fibronectin from liver and spleen was also increased at 24 and 48 hours following R.E. blockade plus bacteremia. In addition, the plasma clearance of human fibronectin was significantly prolonged (p less than 0.05) following bacterial challenge. Infusion of activated Factor XIII (20 units/rat) during a period of hyperfibronectinemia (908.0 +/- 55.1 micrograms/ml) resulted in a significant (p less than 0.05) decrease in plasma fibronectin (548.5 +/- 49.9 micrograms/ml) within 30 min. Thus Factor XIII deficiency in rats with bacteremia may contribute to the elevation in plasma fibronectin by altering kinetics associated with the clearance of fibronectin from the blood.\r"

  ".W": "Previous investigation has suggested that the direct cost of medical care for the 24,011 reported patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) may be as high as $147,000 per patient. To evaluate the use and cost of medical services for patients with AIDS in Massachusetts, we performed a one-year cost of illness study of 45 AIDS patients. Sociodemographic and clinical data as well as information on medical utilization were obtained from review of outpatient and hospital records. Patients with AIDS required a mean of 3.3 (+/- 3.2) hospitalizations per year and 18.4 (+/- 21.8) ambulatory visits per year. Overall, medical costs averaged $46,505 +/- $38,720 per patient per year, with 91% of these expenditures related to use of inpatient services. These results suggest that the cost of medical care for AIDS patients may be substantially less than previously estimated.\r"

Ten patients with a variety of malignant disorders unresponsive to conventional treatments were treated with at least 30,000 U/kg of IL-2 by bolus administration three times a day. Patients were treated intravenously or intraperitoneally from four to 21 days in a single course, usually interrupted by a week of recovery. Three of six patients with melanoma experienced an objective regression (greater than 50% decrease in volume); there was no response to treatment in patients with colorectal (0/3) or ovarian (0/1) cancer. Two patients with initial objective regressions who subsequently developed progression were re-treated and one sustained a second partial response. Responses lasted 1, 3, and 7 months without additional treatment. Responses in the three patients with melanoma were in visceral sites (lung, liver, and spleen), as well as cutaneous sites in one patient. Progressive shrinkage of tumors for three to six months after the conclusion of therapy has been noted in two patients. Marked lymphocytic infiltrate was noted in a patient with lesions accessible to repeated biopsies. This study demonstrates that the administration of IL-2 can mediate the regression of established cancer in some patients.\r"

  ".W": "Plasma anticardiolipin antibody (ACA) was measured in 83 patients having coronary artery bypass graft surgery and results were correlated with the incidence of early (1-2 weeks) and late (12 months) graft occlusion, as judged by angiography. There was an association between preoperative ACA level and the incidence of late graft occlusion in relation to both number of patients with an occlusion and number of distal anastomoses occluded. 8 of 15 patients (53.3%) whose maximum ACA level exceeded 4 SD of the mean of controls had a late graft occlusion. When the ACA titre was 2-4, 0-2, or less than 0 SD above the mean of the controls, the occlusion rates were 3 of 13 (23.1%), 3 of 33 (9.1%), and 1 of 15 (6.7%), respectively (p less than 0.03). The incidence of a postoperative rise in ACA level was higher in patients who had had a myocardial infarction in the past than in those with a history of angina only (chi 2 = 4.08, p less than 0.05). This observation supports the notion that one mechanism of ACA production is an immune response to myocardial injury. These results raise the further possibility that the ACA, or related antiphospholipid antibodies, may play a part in progressive coronary vessel disease.\r"

We examined whether genetic variation in apolipoprotein B is associated with myocardial infarction by studying apolipoprotein B-gene restriction-fragment-length polymorphisms in 84 patients with myocardial infarction and an equal number of matched controls. Southern blot analysis with apolipoprotein B-gene probes, performed after DNA was digested with the endonucleases XbaI and EcoRI, revealed alleles that we designated as X1, X2, and X3 and as R1 and R2, respectively. Similar studies with the endonuclease MspI revealed alleles of many different sizes (the difference was due to an insertion-deletion polymorphism), which we grouped as larger and smaller alleles and designated as ID1 and ID2, respectively. The frequencies of the X1, R1, and ID1 alleles were all significantly higher (P less than 0.01) in the cases than in the controls. None of the alleles, however, was significantly associated with variation in levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol or apolipoprotein B, and the functional importance of these alleles is therefore uncertain. Nonetheless, in addition to quantitative variation in apolipoprotein B levels in plasma, genetic variation at the apolipoprotein B locus may be a new and independent risk factor for myocardial infarction.\r"

Their mean age at the time of immunization was 27.8 months (range, 18 to 47). Meningitis developed in 39 patients, of whom 3 died and 6 had neurologic sequelae. We investigated certain host factors that may have contributed to the failure of the vaccine. The geometric mean concentration of antibody to type b polysaccharide in convalescent-phase serum from 31 of the vaccinated patients who had hemophilus disease was significantly lower than that in serum from 25 patients of similar age with the disease who had never been vaccinated (0.59 vs. 3.46 micrograms per milliliter, P less than 0.001). However, only 3 of 46 patients in whom the vaccine failed and who were tested for hypogammaglobulinemia had this finding, and none of 33 children tested for IgG2 had low serum concentrations of this immunoglobulin subclass, which is thought to be important in the immune response to polysaccharide antigens. In addition, all but 1 of the 46 patients in whom the vaccine failed and who were tested for IgG antibody to tetanus toxoid protein, a thymic-dependent antigen, had normal values, and 19 of 20 tested for hemolytic complement activity had normal levels. In white children, the presence of the Gm immunoglobulin phenotype (1,2,3, 17; ;5,13,21) was associated with a sevenfold increase in the relative risk of vaccine failure (P less than 0.003). We conclude that vaccine failure may be related in part to genetic factors, and that most vaccinated children in whom Hemophilus influenzae disease develops have deficient antibody responses to the type b polysaccharide despite normal serum concentrations of immunoglobulin and normal antibody responses to tetanus toxoid.\r"

We identified 185 patients with primary invasive hemophilus type b disease who were under six years of age and who attended a total of 195 day-care facilities (centers or private homes). There were 4102 children in attendance at these day-care facilities when the primary cases occurred; 4034 (98 percent) were followed for 60 days or more after the onset of illness in the patients with primary disease. A total of 2612 children were considered classroom contacts of the patients with primary disease, because they were cared for in the same home or the same room in a larger facility, but they were not siblings of the index patients. Of these classroom contacts, 370 from 0 to 23 months of age and 716 from 24 to 47 months of age did not receive rifampin chemoprophylaxis. We could confirm no subsequent H. influenzae disease among contacts. Our results suggest that the risk of subsequent hemophilus disease in contacts of patients in day-care facilities is significantly lower than that previously reported for siblings and day-care contacts.\r"

The duration of initial hospitalization and the total amount of blood transfused during hospitalization were significantly less in the patients receiving sclerotherapy (P less than 0.001). There was no difference in short-term survival (50 percent of the sclerotherapy group were discharged alive, as compared with 44 percent of the shunt-surgery group). Both groups were followed for a mean of 530 days after randomization. Rebleeding from varices, the duration of rehospitalization for hemorrhage, and transfusions received after discharge were all significantly greater in the sclerotherapy group (P less than 0.001). Forty percent of the sclerotherapy-treated patients discharged alive (7 of 16 patients) ultimately required surgical treatment for bleeding varices, despite a mean of 6.1 treatment sessions. Health care costs and long-term survival did not differ significantly between the groups (P greater than 0.05). We conclude that although endoscopic sclerotherapy is as good as surgical shunting for the acute management of variceal hemorrhage in poor-risk patients with massive bleeding, sclerotherapy-treated patients in whom varices are not obliterated and bleeding continues should be considered for elective shunt surgery.\r"

The mechanism of this immunosuppression is unknown. We studied methimazole-induced immunoregulatory effects prospectively in 14 patients with Graves' disease treated for up to six months. The numbers of circulating activated, HLA-DR-positive T helper/inducer cells decreased gradually, from 8.3+1.7 percent (+SD) to 1.0+1.7 percent (P less than 0.001). HLA-DR-positive T suppressor/cytotoxic cells increased transiently at one month, from 2.0+1.9 percent to 12.6+6.4 percent (P less than 0.001), and returned to 2.9+3.7 percent at six months. Methimazole did not alter the HLA-DR expression of T cells in vitro. In two patients, the helper activity of T cells in inducing autoantibody secretion in vitro was substantially reduced after one month of methimazole treatment. Before treatment, large proportions of thyroid-infiltrating T-cell subsets expressed the activation markers HLA-DR, interferon-gamma, and interleukin-2 receptors, which were partially lost during therapy. Methimazole treatment was accompanied by a gradual reduction in circulating levels of thyrotropin-receptor, microsomal, and thyroglobulin autoantibodies. These results are compatible with the view that methimazole-induced immunoregulation in Graves' disease is mediated by a direct inhibitory effect on thyrocytes. This inhibition is in turn accompanied by marked changes in the proportions of activated T helper-like and T suppressor-like cells. This altered T-cell activation profile reflects, at least in part, the functional suppression of autoantibody production observed in methimazole-treated patients with Graves' disease.\r"

We prospectively investigated primary cases of H. influenzae type b disease in day-care facilities in Dallas County, Texas, to determine the rate of subsequent disease among contacts. Ninety-one children with primary cases of H. influenzae type b disease who were attending day-care facilities were enrolled from October 1982 to October 1984. A total of 587 classroom contacts of these children under four years of age were not given rifampin. During 60 days of follow-up, there was one subsequent case in a classroom contact. Untreated children under two years of age who were directly exposed to a patient with a primary case were considered to be at highest risk of disease, but there were no subsequent cases in this group of 361 children. However, there were two cases in new enrollees who started attending day-care facilities during the 60-day follow-up period but who were not exposed to a patient with a primary case. At day-care centers in which there was a second case during the follow-up period, there was a high prevalence of colonization with H. influenzae type b in both patient and nonpatient groups of preschool children. These data indicate that the rate of subsequent disease in classroom contacts of patients in day-care facilities is lower than that reported in households (1 of 587 vs. 20 of 829, P = 0.001) and that this rate may be similar to the base rate of primary disease in day-care facilities. We conclude that rifampin prophylaxis may not be appropriate after the occurrence of a primary case of H. influenzae type b disease in a day-care facility in Dallas County.\r"

These populations differ in their location, cell size, staining characteristics, ultrastructure, mediator content and T-cell dependency. Several investigators recently reported a further subclass of mast cells which arise when normal mouse haematopoietic cells are cultured with interleukin-3 (IL-3); IL-3 is an activity similar or identical to mast-cell growth factor, histamine-producing factor, or P-cell stimulating factor. These cultured mast cells are in many ways similar to MMC; they stain with Alcian blue but not safranin, contain chondroitin sulphate E proteoglycan rather than heparin proteoglycan and have relatively low histamine content, as do MMC. Although proliferation of MMC is known to be T-cell dependent in vivo and thought to be IL-3-dependent in vitro, the factors on which CTMC proliferation depends remain elusive. Here we show that mature CTMC purified from mouse peritoneal cells can proliferate in vitro in methylcellulose culture and maintain the appearance and function of CTMC. We also present evidence that mature CTMC cannot proliferate in the presence of pure IL-3 alone.\r"

These soluble factors are functionally divided into two groups: B-cell growth factor (BCGF), thought to be involved in B-cell proliferation; and B-cell differentiation factor (BCDF), responsible for maturation of activated B cells into immunoglobulin-secreting cells. This classification needs to be re-examined in the light of the recent cloning of complementary DNA encoding IgG1 induction factor (interleukin-4, IL-4) from the 2.19 mouse T-cell line. Recombinant IL-4 has BCGF and BCDF activities and affects B cells, T cells and mast cells (refs 7, 8; our unpublished data). Another well-characterized B-cell factor is T-cell replacing factor (TRF), which, when secreted by the murine T-cell hybridoma B151K12, is defined by two activities: induction of IgM secretion by BCL1 leukaemic B-cell line; and induction of secondary anti-dinitrophenol (DNP) immunoglobulin G (IgG) synthesis in vitro by DNP-prime B cells. Although TRF from B151K12 was classified as BCDF, purified TRF has BCGF-II activity. To elucidate the molecular properties of TRF we isolated cDNA encoding TRF from the 2.19 T-cell line and report here the structure and multiple activities of this lymphokine.\r"

Among these, human B-cell differentiation factor (BCDF or BSF-2) has been shown to induce the final maturation of B cells into immunoglobulin-secreting cells. BSF-2 was purified to homogeneity and its partial NH2-terminal amino-acid sequence was determined. These studies indicated that BSF-2 is functionally and structurally unlike other known proteins. Here, we report the molecular cloning, structural analysis and functional expression of the cDNA encoding human BSF-2. The primary sequence of BSF-2 deduced from the cDNA reveals that BSF-2 is a novel interleukin consisting of 184 amino acids.\r"

  ".W": "Intracellular free Ca2+ [( Ca2+]i) plays a crucial role in the transduction of extracellular signals. It has been implicated in the modulation of light sensitivity in Limulus photoreceptors and in the efficacy of synaptic transmission; calcium ion fluxes are also involved in the postsynaptic facilitation of nicotinic transmission seen in sympathetic ganglia, and in activation of the acetylcholine (ACh) receptor. [Ca2+]i is also a second messenger for many biologically active substances. We recorded neuronal activities of sensory neurones from the bullfrog (Rana catesbiana), using the suction pipette method and a 'concentration clamp' technique to apply gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) to the cell. We report the first evidence that [Ca2+]i suppresses the GABA-activated Cl- conductance, by decreasing the apparent affinity of the GABA receptor.\r"
