Because physical freedom and personal autonomy have been given such a high value in the constitution, civil and legal rights will be protected for all residents in nursing homes, and procedural safeguards will become mandatory in the next few years for patients who refuse treatment and for those who are deemed to be incompetent. Physicians and other caregivers will increasingly be removed from the role of substitute decision-maker for incompetent patients, and patient representatives, court-appointed guardians and courts will assume this responsibility. Judicial safeguards such as impartial hearings, appeals to the court and the principles of natural justice will become commonplace in nursing homes.\r"

Overall, 25 patients (39%) achieved complete remission. The median remission duration was 28 weeks with 20% of these patients remaining disease-free at 2 years. The median overall survival was 23 weeks. Prognostic factors associated with differences in remission rates included patient performance status, hemoglobin and platelet levels, and degree of peripheral and marrow blastosis. Factors related to differences in survival were patient age and performance status, hemoglobin and platelet levels, percentage of peripheral blasts, and albumin and bilirubin levels. The toxicity of the regimen was minimal, with 33% of patients requiring hospitalization because of febrile episodes of unknown origin (17%) or documented infections (16%). Therapy-related mortality occurred in four patients (6%). We conclude that the VAD program has significant antileukemic efficacy and acceptable toxicity in adult salvage ALL.\r"

A 22-year-old man with spontaneous rupture of a Wilms' tumor, who died within 5 months, is described. The factors that probably contributed to his rapid demise included preoperative tumor spilling, unfavorable histology, and the omission of radiotherapy owing to poor patient compliance. Although Wilms' tumor is known to have a poorer prognosis in adults than in children, the reason for this is not known. Due to the limited number of cases reported, the optimal treatment for adult Wilms' tumor remains to be defined. However, the recent literature indicates that radical surgery combined with maximal radiotherapy dosage and modification of the chemotherapy schedules used in children may be required to improve the prognosis for adults with Wilms' tumor.\r"

Their relationship to the so-called Askin's tumor, neuroectodermal tumor of bone, and peripheral neuroblastoma remains to be established. In an attempt to clarify these points, immunocytochemical and ultrastructural studies were done on tissues from 14 cases of EW, 4 cases of EEW, and 9 cases of primitive neuroectodermal tumor (PNET) and compared with neuroblastoma and olfactory neuroblastoma. Six tumors categorized initially as EW and EEW on biopsy, turned out to be PNET by extensive histologic and/or ultrastructural observations. Abundant glycogen was recognized not only in 16 of 18 cases of EW and EEW, but also in seven of nine cases of PNET. Fine fibrillar cell processes were seen between tumor cells, at least in limited areas even in cases of EW and EEW. Immunocytochemically, neuron-specific enolase (NSE), neuroblastoma cell surface antigen (NBCA), neuron cell surface antigen (NCSA), and neurofilament (NF) were demonstrated not only in neuroblastoma, but also frequently in cases of EW, EEW, and PNET. The results seem to suggest that EW and EEW represent the most immature forms of neuroectodermal tumor. Electron microscopic study showed predominantly primitive cells with occasional areas of cell processes, neurosecretory granules, and microtubules, suggesting a neuroectodermal origin.\r"

In a randomized, double-blind, and placebo-controlled study of 10 normotensive volunteers caffeine, a xanthine with in vitro adenosine antagonistic properties, increased mean arterial pressure by 5.6 +/- 0.9 mm Hg and lowered heart rate by 5.3 +/- 1.1 beats/min. After administration of enprofylline, a xanthine without adenosine antagonism, forearm vascular resistance decreased by 5.6 +/- 3.4 IU, heart rate increased by 10.6 +/- 2.6 beats/min, and plasma adrenaline, plasma noradrenaline, and renin activity increased by 178 +/- 86%, 14 +/- 8%, and 36 +/- 13%, respectively. Adenosine infusion alone induced a dose-related increase in pulse pressure and heart rate, and it increased plasma adrenaline and noradrenaline by 186 +/- 77% and 132 +/- 55%, respectively. This response to adenosine was reduced by pretreatment with caffeine but not enprofyline. Thus opposite circulatory responses to caffeine and enprofylline occurred, with signs of vasoconstriction and vasodilation, respectively. In addition, caffeine, but not enprofylline, reduced the cardiovascular response to exogenous adenosine.\r"

The results from the analysis of 5 optimal samples were compared with those derived from 15 concentration determinations (10 samples, with the 5 optimal samples assayed in duplicate). The use of a standard least-squares estimator as opposed to a bayesian estimator, with normal prior distributions placed on beta and serum clearance, was also examined. Finally, the use of duplicate determinations in improving the precision of parameter estimation was studied. Plasma concentrations obtained at time points determined by optimal sampling theory, when analyzed with a bayesian estimator, produced estimates of pharmacokinetic parameter values that were in good agreement with those derived from the 15-determination set. Duplicate assay did not improve the precision of parameter estimation. Estimation of plasma clearance was quite robust, irrespective of the estimator used, probably because this evaluation was performed at steady state. Optimal sampling theory is a promising technique that can be employed to determine patient-specific estimates of pharmacokinetic parameter values in target populations.\r"

  ".W": "The pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics (blood pressure, heart rate, serum angiotensin-converting enzyme, and plasma renin activity) of enalapril and enalaprilat were studied after oral administration of enalapril maleate (10 mg) to seven biopsy-proven cirrhotic patients and to seven healthy subjects. The mean Cmax, AUC, and urinary excretion of enalapril and enalaprilat were greater and less (p less than 0.01), respectively, and mean oral clearance of enalapril was less (p less than 0.01) in the cirrhotic group than in the healthy group. However, there was no significant difference in the mean total drug (enalapril plus enalaprilat) excretion between the two groups. Blood pressure fell (p less than 0.05) only at 3 or 4 hours postdose, with no change in heart rate in the two groups. Serum angiotensin-convering enzyme (ACE) decreased (p less than 0.001) and plasma renin activity (PRA) increased (p less than 0.05) in the two groups. The magnitude of the percentage of inhibition of ACE activity was comparable between the two groups. Serum enalaprilat concentration correlated (p less than 0.001) with the percentage of inhibition of ACE activity. The results suggest that the bioactivation of enalapril to enalaprilat is considerably impaired in patients with cirrhosis but that the pharmacodynamic effects do not appear to be blunted in those patients. The mechanism and clinical implications remained unclear.\r"

This study was undertaken to determine whether proglumide enhances morphine analgesia for patients experiencing postoperative pain. At onset of pain after the removal of impacted third molars, patients (n = 60) received intravenously either 4 mg morphine, 8 mg morphine, or 4 mg morphine plus proglumide (0.05, 0.5, or 5 mg). The administration of 8 mg morphine significantly reduced pain, in comparison with baseline and 4 mg morphine, for the first 30 minutes. The addition of 0.05 mg proglumide resulted in a significant increase in the magnitude and duration of the analgesic activity of 4 mg morphine; 0.5 and 5.0 mg proglumide did not produce this effect. No difference was seen in respiratory rate or in the frequency of side effects among the various forms of treatment. These data indicate that a low dose of proglumide potentiates both the magnitude and the duration of morphine analgesia in a clinical model of acute pain, without any detectable increase in side effects.\r"

When a need appeared, most laboratory workers simply devised a method that would solve their own immediate problem. That resulted in a chaotic array of testing procedures that were being used in different laboratories and most of those procedures were not carefully controlled. Standardization of methods being used in the United States was brought about under the guidance of Dr. John C. Sherris and many others. As a result of the efforts that occurred in the late 1950s and early 1960s, susceptibility testing in the United States has reached a fairly sophisticated level of maturity. The National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards has accepted the challenge of maintaining the level of standardization that we have learned to expect.\r"

Instead of using a continuous twofold dilution series as we had done for the previous 10 years, in 1978 we introduced a susceptibility panel that utilized a minimal number of selected (discontinuous) antimicrobic concentrations. The concentrations selected were those thought to be the most clinically relevant, based on known pharmacologic properties of each antimicrobic agent, as well as known MIC population distributions that we had acquired on 50,000 organisms in the preceding years. In addition to using selected concentrations, we also added interpretive codes to aid the physician in selecting the best antimicrobic agent to use. We had previously only reported quantitative MIC results without qualitative interpretations. The present interpretive criteria inform the physician not only if the organism is susceptible or resistant but also if intramuscular or intravenous doses are needed, if the organism is susceptible to an antimicrobic agent but only for lower urinary tract infections, if the organism is resistant to penicillin by virtue of penicillinase production, and in the case of streptococci, if streptomycin or gentamicin can be expected to show synergy when combined with a penicillin. The use of clinically relevant selected concentrations combined with clear interpretive criteria has worked well in our hospital setting. Physicians are able to understand and utilize the information effectively and have found almost no need for exact MICs using a twofold dilution series.\r"

Central to such programs is the concept of universal precautions. The program described here relates the level of protection or precaution to the potential danger for infection, given the laboratory workstation and task which is to be performed. Four Levels of Protection are described. Implementation of this program requires that each workstation and procedure in each laboratory section be reviewed by the laboratory director and supervisory personnel for risk of exposure. Implementation additionally requires that provisions be made for both the initial and continuing education of laboratory employees. Laboratory directors and supervisors should also monitor the program to ensure compliance. There will certainly be situations unique to individual institutions or laboratory settings that may require precautions or policies over and above those described by universal precautions. Laboratory policies will not gain acceptance if they are developed and implemented without the advice and cooperation of the hospital medical staff. Employee acceptance of infection control policies will be greater if actual development and implementation actively involves the laboratory personnel who will practice them. The program described here is but one approach to the problem. Employers and laboratory directors must understand that it is their responsibility to develop a program that provides appropriate safeguards for workers who may be exposed to infectious agents in the laboratory workplace and to ensure that employees are properly trained and educated in the proper use and application of those safeguards.\r"

This common disorder may be seen at any age, including childhood, and may be associated with secondary symptoms of depression and other affective disorders. It may also be associated with findings of disturbed sleep, hearing and vestibular abnormalities, and profound complaints of fatigue. The vagueness of this latter complaint means that PFS must be distinguished from the newly described CEBV syndrome. Although the etiology of PFS remains unknown, recent investigations suggest that these patients may suffer a disorder with a central nervous system component as well as a subtle peripheral tissue lesion. Newer PFS studies demonstrate tissue changes that may be consistent with altered microvascular permeability and blood flow, tissue hypoxia, and chronic muscle spasm. An immunologic abnormality, or even a previously undescribed connective tissue disease, may be important as a pathogenic factor in some PFS patients.\r"

Forty patients with diabetes mellitus and a plantar ulcer but with no gross infection, osteomyelitis, or gangrene were randomly assigned to the TCC group (n = 21) or TDT group (n = 19). Age, sex, ratio of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus to non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, duration of diabetes mellitus, vascular status, size and duration of ulcer, and sensation were not significantly different between groups (P greater than .05). In the experimental group, TCC was applied on the initial visit, and subjects were instructed to limit ambulation to approximately 33% of their usual activity. Subjects in the control group were prescribed dressing changes and accommodative footwear and were instructed to avoid bearing weight on the involved extremity. Ulcers were considered healed if they showed complete skin closure with no drainage. Ulcers were considered not healed if they showed no decrease in size by 6 wk or if infection developed that required hospitalization. In the TCC group, 19 of 21 ulcers healed in 42 +/- 29 days; in the TDT group, 6 of 19 ulcers healed in 65 +/- 29 days. Significantly more ulcers healed (chi 2 = 12.4, P less than .05) and fewer infections developed (chi 2 = 4.1, P less than .05) in the TCC group. We conclude TCC is a successful method of treating diabetic plantar ulcers but requires careful application, close follow-up, and patient compliance with scheduled appointments to minimize complications.\r"

  ".W": "This study examined the effect of age on the posthepatic delivery of oral glucose (PHDG) during steady-state conditions. We used an intravenous-oral modification of the euglycemic insulin-clamp technique to assess PHDG in six men aged 24-39 yr (young) and eight men aged 65-83 yr (old). Each subject underwent two studies in which insulin was infused at 120 mU.m-2.min-1 for 3 h, and either oral glucose (45 g) or water was given 60 min after initiating insulin. This level of insulin infusion is known to fully suppress hepatic glucose output. For each subject, PHDG was calculated as the difference between the whole-body glucose disposal rates in the paired studies. The time course of PHDG differed in the two groups (P less than .0001), with an overall delay in PHDG in the older men. During the 1st h, younger men showed a greater PHDG (58.6 +/- 3.8% of the oral load vs. 45.1 +/- 4.2%) than the older group (P = .04). During the 2nd h, PHDG was less in the younger group (20.7 +/- 4.9%) than the older group (36.6 +/- 3.9%, P = .02). Over the 2-h period, total PHDG was comparable in younger (79.3 +/- 7.4%) and older (81.7 +/- 7.9%) men. These results indicate that normal aging is associated with significantly delayed but overall equal PHDG in men, consistent with the greater effect of age on 2-h rather than earlier postprandial glucose levels. It reinforces the role of impaired peripheral utilization as the primary mechanism of the glucose intolerance of aging.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Eight subjects in the sucrose group ate sucrose-sweetened snacks twice a day, and 8 subjects in the control group ingested snacks that were sweetened with aspartame. The percentage of total daily calories derived from added sucrose was 7% for the sucrose group and 1% for the control group. Metabolic control was assessed by daily capillary BG measurements obtained before meals and the bedtime snack and by determination of serum fructosamine (F) concentrations on arrival at camp (day 0) and after 5 days on the study protocol (day 5). No significant difference was seen between the groups on day 0 (sucrose group [mean +/- SD]: BG 9.9 +/- 3.6 mM, F 3.54 +/- 0.38 mM; control group: BG 9.1 +/- 2.8 mM, F 3.74 +/- 0.71 mM) or day 5 (sucrose group: BG 8.8 +/- 2.6 mM, F 2.94 +/- 0.32 mM; control group: BG 7.4 +/- 2.8 mM, F 2.92 +/- 0.59 mM). We conclude that ingestion of sucrose, added to snacks in an amount up to 7% of total energy intake, does not adversely affect short-term BG control.\r"

We have investigated with an isotopic technique whether duodenal bulb clearance or duodenal transit are abnormal in duodenal ulcer. Six patients with inactive and six with active duodenal ulcers, all men, and six healthy male controls were studied. Motility of the duodenum was simultaneously monitored. A bolus of 99mTcDTPA was injected into the duodenum while water or acid were perfused on different occasions. Duodenal bulb clearance and transit to the ligament of Treitz were calculated. Duodenal transit in duodenal ulcer patients 108.8 (23) sec was faster than in controls, 194.9 (5.1) sec (p less than 0.05) during the quiescent period of the motility cycle. The frequency of duodenal bulb contractions during acid perfusion was higher in duodenal ulcer patients 1.7 (0.4) cont/min, than in controls 0.8 (0.1) cont/min (p less than 0.05). No other significant differences were observed between ulcer patients and controls. These data suggest that patients with duodenal ulcers do not have major abnormalities of duodenal bulb clearance, nor of duodenal transit and that duodenal motility does not play a primary role in the pathogenesis of the ulcer.\r"

Both groups showed a similar decrease in stool frequency (p less than 0.001). The proportion of unformed stools was also decreased, but to a lesser extent (p less than 0.05) in those taking olsalazine (78% v 55%; p less than 0.001) compared with those taking sulphasalazine (72% v 28%; p less than 0.001). There was a diminution in the proportion of stools containing blood in both groups (olsalazine: 61% v 22%; p less than 0.001/sulphasalazine: 67% v 37%; p less than 0.001). Sigmoidoscopic and histological appearances and clinical activity improved significantly and to a similar extent in both groups. Intolerance was encountered in two patients on olsalazine and four on sulphasalazine; intolerance to sulphasalazine being even higher (five of seven patients) in a preliminary study using a dose of sulphasalazine releasing the same amount of 5-aminosalicylic acid as 2 g olsalazine. Olsalazine was at least as effective as sulphasalazine in the treatment of new patients with distal colitis, and in a dose releasing an equivalent amount of 5-aminosalicylic acid was better tolerated.\r"

When Pn was elevated above a Pcrit, periodic occlusions of the upper airway were eliminated and inspiratory airflow limitation was demonstrated by the finding that inspiratory airflow (VI) became maximal (VImax) and independent of fluctuations in hypopharyngeal pressure (Php) when Php fell below a specific Php (Php'). As Pn was elevated, VI vs. Php demonstrated 1) marked decreases in early and late inspiratory resistances from 75.9 +/- 34.7 and 54.6 +/- 19.0 to 8.0 +/- 1.7 and 7.6 +/- 1.6 cmH2O.l-1.s (P less than 0.05), respectively, and 2) increases in early and late inspiratory Php' to levels that exceeded Pcrit by 3.0 +/- 0.6 and 3.1 +/- 0.7 cmH2O, respectively, at the highest level of Pn applied (P less than 0.01). This latter finding suggests that elevations in Pn result in increases in Pcrit. We suggest that elevations in Pn produce distinct alterations in upper airway resistance and collapsibility, which may influence oppositely the level of airflow through the upper airway during sleep.\r"

  ".W": "Constant-flow ventilation (CFV) is achieved by delivering a constant stream of inspiratory gas through cannulas aimed down the main stem bronchi at flow rates totaling 1-3 l.kg-1.min-1 in the absence of tidal lung motion. Previous studies have shown that CFV can maintain a normal arterial PCO2, although significant ventilation-perfusion (VA/Q) inequality appears. This VA/Q mismatch could be due to regional differences in lung inflation that occur during CFV secondary to momentum transfer from the inflowing stream to resident gas in the lung. We tested the hypothesis that substitution of a gas with lower density might attenuate regional differences in alveolar pressure and reduce the VA/Q inequality during CFV. Gas exchange was studied in seven anesthetized dogs by the multiple inert gas elimination technique during ventilation with intermittent positive-pressure ventilation, CFV with O2-enriched nitrogen (CFV-N2), or CFV with O2-enriched helium (CFV-He). As an index of VA/Q inequality independent of shunt, the log SD blood flow increased from 0.757 +/- 0.272 during intermittent positive-pressure ventilation to 1.54 +/- 0.36 (P less than 0.001) during CFV-N2. Switching from CFV-N2 to CFV-He at the same flow rate did not improve log SD blood flow (1.45 +/- 0.21) (P greater than 0.05) but tended to increase arterial PCO2. In excised lungs with alveolar capsules attached to the pleural surface, CFV-He significantly reduced alveolar pressure differences among lobes compared with CFV-N2 as predicted. Regional alveolar washout of Ar after a stap change of inspired concentration was slower during CFV--He than during CFV-N2.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "We examined the mechanical behavior of a bronchopleural fistula created by sectioning a small subpleural bronchus in seven anesthetized lambs. The pressure across the fistula was measured as the difference between the pressure recorded by a retrograde bronchial catheter inserted in the vicinity of the fistula and the outflow pressure at the fistula exit. The effective resistance of the fistula (Rf) was computed by dividing this pressure difference by the gas flow through the fistula measured at the outlet of an intrapleural tube adjacent to the fistula. Rf increased by 114 +/- 25% (SE) when we inflated the lungs in a stepwise manner from a tracheal pressure of 2-20 cmH2O. Rf also increased when inflation pressure varied continuously; this increase, however, was less evident when we decreased the inflation time from 1.0 to 0.2 s. The relationship between Rf and lung volume was similar during the stepwise inflations and deflations but showed marked hysteresis during the continuous inflation-deflation maneuvers, when Rf was greater during deflation than inflation. Our results suggest that the fistula behaves as a compliant pathway whose relevant transmural pressure is the transmural pressure at or near the fistula's exit. We attribute the increase in Rf during inflation to decreases in transmural pressure caused by convective and dissipative losses inside the fistula and by the stress applied by the chest wall on the outer surface of the fistula.\r"

The objective of this study was to determine if treatment with a leukotriene receptor antagonist and 5-lipoxygenase inhibitors could diminish acrolein-induced bronchial hyperresponsiveness and to determine whether leukotriene (LT) C4 generation is augmented by acrolein exposure. Guinea pigs (groups of 6-7) were exposed to 1.3 ppm acrolein for 2 h and bronchial responsiveness to intravenous acetylcholine determined twice before, and once 1, 2, 6, and 24 h after exposure. Immediately after acrolein exposure (5 min) specific total airway resistance (sRt) increased from 0.86 +/- 0.01 to 1.29 +/- 0.07 ml.cmH2O.ml-1.s. Within 1 h after exposure, the effective dose of acetylcholine sufficient to double sRt (ED200) decreased from 114.0 +/- 6.6 to 58.5 +/- 6.5 micrograms.kg-1.min-1. Bronchial hyperresponsiveness became maximal at 2 h with ED200 = 44.7 +/- 4.2 and persisted for up to 24 h after exposure (24 h ED200 = 60.2 +/- 11.6 micrograms.kg-1.min). A LTC4/LTD4 receptor antagonist, L-649,923 (10 mg/kg iv), and two putative inhibitors of 5-lipoxygenase, L-651,392 (10 mg/kg po) and U-60,257 (5 mg/kg i.v.), diminished the immediate bronchoconstriction and markedly inhibited bronchial hyperresponsiveness. Analysis of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid obtained from guinea pigs after acrolein exposure revealed a significant increase in immunoreactive LTC4 concentrations (control LTC4 = 8.8 +/- 0.3, n = 7; exposed LTC4 = 15.9 +/- 2.4 pg/ml, n = 6). Treatment with L-651,392 inhibited this response (acrolein exposed = 9.4 +/- 2.4 pg/ml, n = 5).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Three groups of rats were implanted with osmotic pumps; two groups received saline-filled pumps, whereas the third received endotoxin. One of the saline groups was pair fed to match the food intake of the endotoxemic rats. After 7 days, body energy and protein and fat contents of rats were determined together with the energy content of food and feces. Endotoxin infusion not only induced fever, but it also suppressed appetite and significantly decreased body weight gain. Metabolizable energy intake was reduced by approximately 20% in infected rats. Although protein and fat gains were lowest in the endotoxin group, there appeared to be a selective loss of protein when considered as percent of body weight. Percent body fat was unaltered between the groups. Energy expenditure considered in absolute (kJ) or body weight-independent (kJ/kg0.67) terms yielded similar patterns of results; expenditure (kJ) was 10 and 20% (P less than 0.05, P less than 0.01) lower in the endotoxemic and pair-fed rats, respectively, compared with controls. Hence, compared with pair-fed rats, endotoxin-infused animals had a 10% rise in their expenditure. Brown adipose tissue thermogenesis was assessed by mitochondrial binding of guanosine 5'-diphosphate, and results showed that binding was greatest in endotoxemic rats and lowest in the pair-fed animals. The present results suggest that in this endotoxemic model appetite suppression exacerbates changes in energy balance. However, the reduction in body weight gain is also dependent on a decrease in metabolic efficiency and an increase in total energy expenditure.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

All of the patients had disabling pain after the failure of previous attempts to correct the problem surgically. Thirty-nine patients (forty knees) were available for follow-up at two to ten years after the allograft was transplanted. Nine transplants (22.5 per cent) failed and thirty-one (77.5 per cent) were successful. The result was rated excellent after thirteen of the successful transplants, good after fourteen, and fair after four. Transplantation of a fresh osteochondral allograft proved to be a satisfactory intermediate procedure for the treatment of the disabling conditions, except unicompartmental traumatic arthritis, in the young patients in this series. For the patients who had unicompartmental traumatic arthritis, the rate of success was only 30 per cent.\r"

To test this hypothesis, we tested the tensile strength of femora from normal rats and from untreated and insulin-treated diabetic rats two weeks after the production of a closed fracture. One week before the fracture, diabetes was induced by administration of streptozotocin (sixty-five milligrams per kilogram of body weight). The concentration of serum glucose increased from 6.1 +/- 0.3 millimoles per liter (110 +/- 5 milligrams per deciliter) in the control animals to 31.1 +/- 0.8 millimoles per liter (560 +/- 15 milligrams per deciliter) in the untreated diabetic animals. After two weeks of healing, fracture callus from the untreated diabetic animals had a 29 per cent decrease in tensile strength and a 50 per cent decrease in stiffness compared with the controls. Treatment of the diabetic animals with insulin resulted in a mean concentration of serum glucose of 14.4 +/- 0.6 millimoles per liter (260 +/- 10 milligrams per deciliter) and restored the tensile strength and stiffness of the callus to a value that was not statistically different from that of the controls. Between the fourth and eleventh days of healing, there was a 50 to 55 per cent decrease in the collagen content of the callus of the untreated diabetic animals compared with the controls. In addition, on the fourth day of healing, DNA content, an indicator of cellularity of the callus, was decreased 40 per cent in the untreated diabetic group. Between the fourth and eleventh days of healing, the collagen-to-DNA ratio, which was determined as an indicator of net collagen synthesis per cell, was decreased 15 to 50 per cent in callus from the untreated diabetic animals.\r"

Term placental cells in suspension prelabeled with [3H]myoinositol were stimulated without or with increasing concentrations of LHRH in the presence of 10 mM LiCl, and total inositol phosphate (IP) was measured by ion exchange chromatography; a nonsignificant 0.9 +/- 0.08-fold increase over the control value was observed. In contrast, placental cells stimulated with equimolar concentrations of angiotensin II (AII) induced a 4.6 +/- 0.9-fold increase in total IP (P less than 0.01), while rat pituitary cells showed 1.9 +/- 0.2- and a 2.4 +/- 0.07-fold increases in total IP production after stimulation with LHRH or AII, respectively (P less than 0.05). These increases were blocked by coincubation with specific LHRH and AII antagonists. When 1 x 10(6) placental cells were incubated with 45Ca2+ without and with increasing doses of LHRH for 0-75 s and then filtered under negative pressure, we observed significant incorporation of 45Ca2+. This influx was linear with incubation time, significantly more pronounced in cells exposed to LHRH than in control cells, and showed a dose-response curve to LHRH that reached maximal influx rates of 3.6 +/- 0.3 nM/min.1 x 10(6) cells with 10(-5) M LHRH. This response was completely blocked by coincubation with 10(-5) M LHRH antagonists; cobalt chloride and verapamil reduced it by 60% and 80%, respectively. Compared to placental cells stimulated with LHRH alone, those coincubated with LHRH and specific LHRH or Ca2+ antagonists released from 10-100% less hCG. We conclude that Ca2+ participates in the LHRH action in human placentas, but uncoupled to PI turnover.\r"

IL-1 beta (0.001-10 mumol/L) increased ACTH release 3-fold. Thymosin fraction-5 (10 mumol/L), gamma-interferon (1 mumol/L), and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (1 mumol/L) also stimulated ACTH release. These cultured cells secreted little or no GH, PRL, TSH, LH, and FSH, and their release was not stimulated by any cytokine. These results suggest that ACTH release in patients with Cushing's disease may be responsive to stimulation by various cytokines.\r"

We investigated the relative distribution of the various components throughout the placenta to determine whether the distribution is consistent with a role for them in parturition or in stimulation or inhibition of placental hormone biosynthesis. Thus, active and total renin were measured in fetal membranes (chorion laeve and amnion) and in discoid placenta (chorion frondosum and chorion plate) of women who were delivered vaginally (n = 12) or by cesarean section with (n = 6) or without labor (n = 9). The interrelationships between active and total renin and angiotensinogen, progesterone, hCG, and estradiol concentrations were investigated. Labor had no significant effect on the concentration of active or total renin, angiotensinogen, hCG, or estradiol in any part of the placenta. Tissue progesterone concentrations were higher in placentas from women who underwent vaginal deliveries than in those who had cesarean sections with or without labor (P less than 0.02). The chorion laeve had 20 times more total renin per g than the discoid placenta and 3 times more than the amnion. In contrast the discoid placenta had 5 times more hCG per g and 3 times more progesterone per g than the fetal membranes. The concentration of estradiol was lower in amnion, while that of angiotensinogen was lower in the chorion frondosum than in all other regions. The tissue concentrations of active renin, prorenin, or total renin were not related to those of any of the other hormones. Altogether these data do not provide evidence of a role for the placental renin system in parturition or placental hormone biosynthesis.\r"

In a prospective study we investigated the effect of metabolic regulation on the plasma levels of F VIII/vWF and cross-linked fibrin degradation products (XL-FDP), an indicator of intravascular coagulation, in 15 insulin-dependent diabetic patients who had no demonstrable vascular abnormalities. Eight patients had newly diagnosed diabetes, and 7 had been diabetic for an average of 12 yr. The patients were tested before and 1, 2, 4, and 8 weeks after the start of a structured diabetes education and care program, including introduction of a basal-bolus form of insulin treatment. Treatment for 8 weeks resulted in a highly significant improvement of metabolic control [hemoglobin Aic, 11.1 +/- 1.3% (+/- SD) vs. 6.8 +/- 1.0%; plasma fructosamine, 4.8 +/- 1.0 vs. 2.9 +/- 0.7 mmol/L; plasma glucose, 13.5 +/- 4.2 vs. 6.3 +/- 2.2 mmol/L; P less than 0.0001, respectively]. Compared to age- and sex-matched normal subjects, plasma activity of factor VIII (F VIII:C) was significantly elevated in the diabetic patients initially (1.5 +/- 0.6 vs. 1.0 +/- 0.1 x 10(3) U/L; P less than 0.01). After 2 weeks of intensified therapy it was 1.1 +/- 0.4 x 10(3) U/L. The mean plasma vWF value also was significantly elevated initially [vWF antigen, 1.8 +/- 0.7; normal group, 0.9 +/- 0.1 x 10(3) U/L (P less than 0.01); vWF ristocetin cofactor activity, 1.9 +/- 0.9; normal group, 1.0 +/- 0.3 x 10(3) U/L (P less than 0.001)] and decreased significantly after only 1 week of therapy. In the following 7-week period plasma vWF remained near normal. Plasma XL-FDP levels were elevated in all patients initially (190 +/- 150; normal group, 35 +/- 30 micrograms/L): the value was most abnormal in the patients with newly diagnosed disease (300 +/- 150 micrograms/L), indicating intravascular fibrin formation. The mean XL-FDP level declined significantly in the patients with newly diagnosed diabtes after 1 week of therapy; in the other patients, however, XL-FDP levels remained slightly elevated. In all 15 patients the plasma F VIII:C and XL-FDP levels were correlated significantly at all times. The plasma vWF and XL-FDP levels were correlated after 1, 2, 4, and 8 weeks of treatment as were the plasma vWF levels and glucose concentrations before and 1 and 2 weeks after the start of treatment program.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

Immunostaining was performed on paraffin wax embedded control saphenous vein and graft sections incubated directly with primary antibodies against von Willebrand antigen (vWFAg), fibronectin, fibrinogen, leucocyte common antigen (LCA), lysozyme, vimentin, desmin, platelet factor 4, and thrombospondin. Antigens were visualised by a chromogen providing an orange-red immunoprecipitate at the site of epitope localisation. The intraluminal, amorphous exudate present in most grafts was not composed simply of fibrin or fibrinogen, as previously thought, but was a multiprotein complex including wWFAg, fibronectin, thrombospondin and platelet factor 4. Along with macrophages, these components probably enter the graft after haemodynamic, physical, and chemical injury to, and disruption of, the endothelial cell. Progressive myointimal proliferation and fibrosis of these grafts may be local repetitive responses to macrophages and platelets, cells previously known to participate in vascular disease.\r"

  ".W": "A radioimmunoassay for the measurement of gonadotrophin releasing hormone (GnRH) in plasma and urine using readily available reagents was developed. The GnRH assay showed good precision, recovery, and parallelism over a wide range of GnRH concentrations with a sensitivity of 15 pg/ml. The assay was compared with a commercially available kit (Buhlmann Laboratories). Although the Buhlmann kit showed acceptable precision, recovery, sensitivity, and correlation with the developed GnRH assay for plasma samples, lack of parallelism of serially diluted plasma and urine samples was consistently observed, together with a poor correlation with the developed GnRH assay for urine, suggesting a matrix effect with the Buhlmann kit. The developed assay is suitable for measuring GnRH in samples obtained from patients receiving pulsatile infusions of GnRH. In contrast, the commercially available Buhlmann kit was unsuitable for measuring plasma GnRH as the kit had a top standard of only 160 pg/ml, well below the peak plasma concentration. It would not be possible to dilute samples for analysis because of the lack of parallelism of diluted samples compared with standards obtained with the Buhlmann assay.\r"

  ".U": "89278478\r", 
  ".W": "Recent studies have suggested that inflammation may play an important role in the characteristic bronchial hyperresponsiveness and symptoms of chronic asthma. The mechanisms by which inflammatory cells, mediators, and nerves interact to produce the features of asthma are still uncertain, however. Although mast cells play an important role in the immediate response to allergen (and probably exercise), pharmacologic evidence argues against a critical role in the late response or bronchial hyperresponsiveness in which other cells, such as macrophages and eosinophils, may play a more important role. Many mediators have been implicated in asthma, but only PAF causes a prolonged increase in bronchial responsiveness. PAF attracts eosinophils into tissues and potently activates these cells, which may lead to epithelial damage, a key feature of asthmatic airways. PAF is also a potent inducer of microvascular leakage in airways, which may result in submucosal edema and plasma exudation into the airway lumen in the future. PAF antagonists will reveal whether PAF plays an important role in the eosinophilic inflammation of asthma. Neural mechanisms may also make an important contribution. Inflammatory mediators may influence neurotransmitter release from airway nerves, and neurotransmitters may be proinflammatory. Neural control is complex and cholinergic, adrenergic, and NANC mechanisms may contribute to bronchial hyperresponsiveness. Many neuropeptides, which may be the transmitters of NANC nerves, have been identified in airways. Neuropeptides in airway sensory nerves, such as substance P, have potent proinflammatory effects and, if these are released by an axon reflex, may amplify the inflammatory response in asthma. Since asthma may be chronic eosinophilic bronchitis, it is logical that the primary treatment should involve drugs that suppress this inflammatory response. At present, corticosteroids appear to be the most effective therapy; they have potent effects against eosinophils and macrophages (but not on mast cells) and reduce bronchial hyperresponsiveness and symptoms. By contrast, bronchodilators, such as beta-agonists, although they reduce symptoms, do not reduce the chronic inflammatory response or bronchial hyperresponsiveness and may mask the underlying inflammation. New therapies should be directed toward controlling eosinophil infiltration and activation in airways.\r"

Asthma cases were defined as patients with evidence of at least two diagnoses and prescription drug transactions consistent with asthma. More than 52,000 cases were thus identified. The period prevalence of asthma was estimated on a year-by-year basis. The prevalence of asthma in the population increased from 2.0 per 100 Medicaid patients in 1980 to 2.8 per 100 Medicaid patients in 1986. Prevalence decreased with age until the age of 20 years and increased thereafter, and was higher in male children than in female children. In contrast, asthma was more prevalent in female adults than in male adults. Prevalence was higher in black subjects than in other races and higher in urban residents than in rural residents. The total number of reimbursements for antiasthma medications increased from 60,000 per year to 120,000 per year, and the average number of antiasthma prescriptions per Michigan Medicaid asthma case increased at the rate of 6.6% per year during the study interval. Changes in the preferred types of asthma treatment consistent with changes that have occurred in the general population were observed. These data suggest that the relative and absolute occurrence of asthma and asthma treatment in the Michigan Medicaid population is increasing.\r"

  ".W": "In a double-blind, multicenter study, we compared the effects of SCH 434 (Claritin-D; Schering Corp., Kenilworth, N.J.), a new sustained-release, combination antihistamine/decongestant medication, with the effects of its individual components and placebo in 435 patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis. SCH 434 contains 5 mg of loratadine, a nonsedating antihistamine, and 120 mg of pseudoephedrine as the decongestant component. Administered twice daily in this study, SCH 434 effected a 50% decrease in total symptom scores at day 4 and was significantly (p less than or equal to 0.03) more effective than the components alone or the placebo. Loratadine or pseudoephedrine alone, with 43% and 33% decline in symptom scores, respectively, also was more effective than placebo (p less than 0.05). As expected, pseudoephedrine alone was more effective than loratadine (p less than 0.01) in relieving nasal stuffiness; SCH 434 was more effective (p less than or equal to 0.01) than placebo and loratadine in relieving nasal stuffiness. All treatments were safe and well tolerated, although insomnia and dry mouth were noted in a significant number of patients who received either SCH 434 or pseudoephedrine. No serious side effects were noted. The incidence of sedation did not differ significantly among the four treatment groups. We conclude that SCH 434 is a safe and effective treatment for symptoms of seasonal allergic rhinitis. The combination drug (SCH 434) was better than its components for some, but not all, symptoms.\r"

  ".W": "The conditions and cell sources for colony stimulating activity (CSA) production by nasal polyp epithelial scrapings were examined. Epithelial scrapings removed from patients were grown to confluence during 7 days as monolayers of epithelial cells in media supplemented with fetal calf serum (FCS) on collagen-coated microwell plates. Growth kinetics of nasal polyp epithelial cells (NPECs) were determined, and CSA in NPEC conditioned medium (CM) was assessed with density-gradient separated, nonadherent peripheral blood mononuclear cells in standard 14-day methylcellulose assays. Nasal polyp cultures in the presence of 5% or 15% FCS (vol/vol) demonstrated significantly more epithelial cell proliferation than cultures at 0% and 1% FCS. There were comparable metachromatic cell counts in polyp epithelial scrappings from allergic and nonallergic donors. Similarly, NPEC CM from allergic and nonallergic donors had equivalent CSA for basophil/mast cell (BMC) and eosinophil (EO) lineages, respectively. CSA production was enhanced under conditions of higher FCS concentration and NPEC proliferation. These studies confirm an epithelial cell origin of BMC and EO growth and differentiation factors derived from nasal polyps and point to the existence of a unique microenvironment for BMC and EO development provided by polyp epithelium that appears to be independent of the presence of an allergic diathesis.\r"

  ".W": "C57BL/6 (B6) mice were i.v. presensitized with class I H-2-disparate B6-C-H-2bm1 (bm1) spleen cells. Such presensitization resulted in almost complete abrogation of bm1-specific Lyt-2+ T cell-mediated proliferative and IL-2-producing capacities as measured by MLC of lymphoid cells from presensitized B6 mice with stimulating bm1 cells. In contrast, comparable magnitude of CTL responses was generated in bulk cultures from presensitized B6 lymphoid cells to that obtained in unpresensitized B6 responding cultures. These differential influences of Lyt-2+ T cell functions were also demonstrated by limiting dilution assays; frequencies of proliferative and IL-2-producing T cell precursors were as low as undetectable in presensitized B6 lymphoid cells, whereas an appreciable frequency of CTL precursors in a portion of the same lymphoid cells was observed. When bm1 skin grafting was performed in B6 mice i.v. presensitized with bm1 cells, the strikingly prolonged survival of bm1 skin grafts was observed. It was also demonstrated that the bm1 skin graft-bearing B6 mice which had been presensitized with bm1 cells not only exhibited a continuing suppressive state of bm1-specific helper (proliferative and IL-2-producing) function but also failed to generate anti-bm1 CTL responses. These results indicate that 1) i.v. presensitization with class I H-2 alloantigens results in selective tolerance of Lyt-2+ Th cells which is adequate for inducing prolonged graft survival, 2) the induction of complete abrogation of CTL potential is not absolute requirement for the prolongation of graft survival, and 3) residual CTL potential is attenuated after grafting so far as Th cells are rendered tolerant.\r"

Experiments were thus undertaken to determine whether rGM-CSF would affect IL-3-dependent growth of mast cells from mouse bone marrow cells (BMC). BMC placed in liquid culture containing 50 U/ml of IL-3 gave rise to cultures containing up to 95% mast cells by 2 to 3 wk. The rise in percentage of mast cells was accompanied by an increase in total cell-associated histamine. In contrast, BMC grown in the presence of 50 U/ml of rGM-CSF gave rise to cultures containing primarily macrophages and granulocytes with less than 1% mast cells. The addition of increasing amounts of rGM-CSF to BMC cultures grown in the presence of IL-3 resulted in a decrease in the number of mast cells present in culture at 2 to 3 wk. Cells other than mast cells in these cultures consisted principally of granulocytes and macrophages. The rGM-CSF-related inhibition of mast cell growth was not abrogated by the addition of indomethacin to cultures. Granulocyte-macrophage cell populations added to IL-3-containing cultures did not inhibit mast cell growth. The suppressive effect of rGM-CSF on IL-3-dependent mast cell growth may indicate an important role for GM-CSF in the down-regulation of mast cell proliferation in tissues.\r"

  ".W": "Purified recombinant human granulocyte-macrophage (rhuGM)-CSF, rhuG-CSF, and rhuCSF-1 were evaluated for their capacity to influence the differentiation of U-937 cells and normal human monocytes. The human U-937 cell line represents an early stage of monocytic differentiation. It was found that rhuGM-CSF and rhuG-CSF, but not rhuCSF-1, induced phenotypic changes consistent with monocyte/macrophage differentiation in U-937 cells. After 3 days of culture in the presence of either rhuGM-CSF or rhuG-CSF, a small but significant proportion of U-937 cells were able to reduce nitroblue tetrazolium. Nitroblue tetrazolium reduction, however, was maximally induced when rhuGM-CSF and rhuG-CSF were added in combination. These changes were accompanied by increased alpha-naphthyl acetate esterase activity, acquisition of macrophage morphology, Mo-1 Ag expression, and decreased cell proliferation. rhuGM-CSF alone also induced expression of the c-fms proto-oncogene (CSF-1 receptor) in U-937 cells and this expression was enhanced by the combination of rhuGM-CSF and rhuG-CSF. In cultured normal human peripheral blood monocytes, representing a late stage of maturation, rhuGM-CSF and rhuCSF-1 differentially increased Mo-1 and My-4 Ag expression, respectively, whereas rhuG-CSF was without effect. Our results suggest that the interaction of GM-CSF, G-CSF, and CSF-1 may play a fundamental role in the early and late stages of the human monocyte/macrophage differentiation process.\r"

EPO reacts with H2O2 formed by the respiratory burst and a halide to form cytotoxic oxidants. The relative potency of the EPO-H2O2-halide system and the GBP is considered here. Horse eosinophils were induced to degranulate, the degranulation products were separated by chromatography on Sephadex G-50 and comparable volumes of the column fractions were tested for toxicity to Escherichia coli and the schistosomula of Schistosoma mansoni in the presence and absence of H2O2 and halides. Both the EPO system and GBP were toxic. However, the peak EPO fraction could be diluted 1000-fold at pH 7.0 and 5000-fold at pH 5.0, and with a 10-fold dilution at pH 7.0 incubation time could be reduced to 5 s, with retention of bactericidal activity in the presence of H2O2 and halides, whereas the peak GBP fractions diluted 10-fold had a small bactericidal effect at 1 h which increased with prolongation of incubation to 24 h. A less than 1 log fall in E. coli viable cell count was produced by the GBP fractions under all conditions as compared to total destruction (greater than 5 log fall) with the EPO system. A 1000-fold dilution of the peak EPO fraction was schistosomulocidal in the presence of H2O2 and halides, with toxicity observed at 2 h with a 10-fold dilution. In contrast, no schistosomulocidal activity was observed at 18 h with a 10-fold dilution of the GBP fractions. However, toxicity was observed with a 5- or 50-fold increase in GBP concentration with maximum toxicity observed with fractions between the two major protein peaks. Thus, under the conditions employed, the EPO-H2O2-halide system contributed to a considerably greater degree to the toxic activity of the granule components than did the GBP.\r"

  ".W": "We previously established that Trypanosoma cruzi, the causative agent of Chagas' disease, has the ability to suppress expression of the p55 component of the IL-2R by activated human PBMC. We explored in this work whether the parasite alters the expression of high affinity IL-2R, responsible for the internalization of IL-2 and signal transduction. Radiobinding measurements revealed that the trypanosome indeed inhibited the expression of high affinity IL-2R. Thus, a considerably smaller number of 125I-IL-2 molecules was necessary to saturate the IL-2R on PHA-stimulated PBMC cocultured with T. cruzi than those of control PBMC that had not been exposed to the organisms. Scatchard analysis of equilibrium binding data showed that, in the presence of T. cruzi, the number of high affinity IL-2R per cell was reduced by approximately 80%. The Kd for IL-2 binding to the fewer IL-2R expressed on PBMC exposed to T. cruzi was not significantly different from that of IL-2R on nonsuppressed PBMC. Independent measurements made after cross-linking 125I-IL-2 to its specific receptors with disuccinimidylsuberate showed that both the p55 and p70 components of the IL-2R were markedly suppressed and to comparable extents. These results demonstrate for the first time that T. cruzi suppresses the expression of high affinity IL-2R by human cells, including the p70 chain of the heterodimeric IL-2R. It is noteworthy that the in vitro model system we used in this work to study the mechanisms whereby T. cruzi may induce the immunosuppression that accompanies acute Chagas' disease also lends itself to the exploration of the regulatory mechanisms governing the expression of IL-2R by human PBMC.\r"

  ".U": "89278660\r", 
  ".W": "A protein of 75 kDa is found in large quantities throughout the blood stages of the human malarial parasite, Plasmodium falciparum. Based on a partial amino acid sequence for p75, previously deduced from a cDNA clone encoding approximately 40% of the molecule, secondary structural predictions were made. The potential role of long range effects on the tertiary structure of the protein stabilized by disulfide bridges was determined by reduction and alkylation of the fusion protein. Five regions were then chosen for peptide modeling. Peptides of 16, 28, 49, 64, and 76 residues were synthesized and used to immunize rabbits. All but the 16-residue peptides were capable of stimulating boostable IgG antibody responses in rabbits, but the antibody produced against the 49 mer did not react with the native parasite protein. Thus, the 28, 64, and 76 residue peptides represent good immunologic models for portions of the P. falciparum 75-kDa protein capable of stimulating both T and B cells in rabbits. The peptides were also used to probe whether any of the selected regions contain epitopes which react with antibodies from owl monkeys immune to P. falciparum. Of these peptides, two were found to be consistently recognized in ELISA by four owl monkey antisera raised in response to malarial infection. Because these two peptides model a cysteine-containing region of the protein, owl monkey sera were also used as probes of the importance of disulfide bonding in maintaining the native structure. The results obtained were consistent with a folding pattern for p75 that incorporates a disulfide bond between cysteines 161 and 194. These results also suggest that most of the epitopes recognized in this part of p75 by the immune system of the monkey are created by folding of the molecule.\r"

Polyclonal antisera raised to purified beta-galactosidase fusion proteins from two of the most highly reactive clones identified a protein of Mr 70,000 in all stages examined (microfilariae, L3 and adults) of both B. malayi and Brugia pahangi. Derivation of the amino acid sequence from these two overlapping cDNAs identified the encoded protein as a member of the heat shock protein 70 family, and showed the closest similarity to the constitutively expressed \"heat shock cognate 70\" (hsc70) protein. Hybridization of hsc70 cDNAs to RNA and DNA from B. pahangi under stringent conditions identified a major transcript of 2.4 kb and revealed the existence of a family of related genes. In vitro culture of larval stages of B. pahangi at elevated temperatures (43 degrees C) resulted in increased expression of hsc70, and a classic heat shock response in which five proteins (mr 18,500, 22,000, 62,000, 70,000, and 85,000) were exclusively synthesized in microfilariae. Analysis of cross-reactivities by Western blotting implied that antibody generated by infection with B. malayi was directed at filarial-specific determinants of Brugia hsc70. However, ELISA with recombinant fusion proteins for both Plasmodium falciparum and Schistosoma mansoni hsc70 indicated that some individuals with Brugian or Bancroftian filariasis did produce antibodies which cross-reacted with plasmodial and schistosomal homologs. Thus filarial-specific antibody responses were not generated in all individuals, indicating that this molecule would not be suitable for diagnostic purposes. ELISA with a purified beta-galactosidase fusion protein from B. pahangi showed antibody responses to hsc70 across the clinical spectrum of filariasis. Alignment of the derived amino acid sequences from B. pahangi, P. falciparum, S. mansoni and rat hsc70 homologs, and comparison of the immunologic reactivity of the products of the two cDNA clones by Western blotting and ELISA suggested that these determinants were located primarily at the C terminus of the protein.\r"

  ".W": "T200 glycoproteins of lymphoid and myeloid cells exhibit cell lineage-specific structural heterogeneity. Peptide heterogeneity appears to arise from alternate 5'-exon use (Ex-4, 5, and 6), potentially giving rise to eight distinct forms of T200 mRNA containing 0 to 3 of these alternate exons. A method is described for determining the number and identity of the three alternate T200 exons expressed in cells by using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) without prior purification of RNA. Synthetic primers flanking the alternate exon region of T200 were designed to yield products for each possible exon combination having unique size and restriction enzyme sites. PCR amplification of plasmids containing T200 cDNA with none (pLy-5-68) or all three (p70Z/3-3) known alternate exons resulted in the amplification of 186 and 603 bp products, respectively. That amplified products were derived from T200 cDNA was verified by restriction enzyme mapping of each PCR product. T200 cDNA prepared from cell lines utilizing no alternate exons (BW5147) or all three exons (70Z/3.12) were analyzed by RT-PCR and contained amplified products of 186 bp (zero alternate exons) and 603 bp (containing Ex-4+5+6), respectively. RT-PCR of EL4 cells revealed approximately 186 and 330 bp products suggestive of zero and one alternate exon forms. Restriction mapping confirmed that EL4 cells contained a zero-exon form and a one-exon form containing Ex-5. Analysis of the 3B3 pre-B cell line yielded 186, 330, 460, and 603 bp products; restriction mapping revealed T200 mRNA for a zero alternate exon form, two distinct one- and two-exon forms (Ex-4; Ex-5; Ex-4+5; Ex-5+6), and a three-exon form (Ex-4+5+6). Other lymphoid cell lines were heterogeneous in T200 alternate exon use, with distinct patterns distinguishing B and T cells. RT-PCR can facilitate the analysis of variations in T200 alternate exon use among developmentally and functionally distinct lymphoid and myeloid cells.\r"

The results showed that (1) high and low m.w. heparin enhanced mouse antitumor and antiallogeneic cell responses in vitro; (2) other sulfated heparinoids did not have this enhancing activity and some of them (including dextran sulfate) totally suppressed generation of cytotoxic cells; (3) these immunomodulating activities of heparin and heparinoids did not correlate with their anticoagulant effects, degree of sulfation, and mitogenic activity; (4) heparin did not increase the production of IL-2 and did not enhance the action of IL-2 on the cells in MLC, heparin also had no effect on the growth-promoting activity of IL-2 on cloned cytotoxic T cells; (5) heparin had a synergistic enhancing effect with IL-1 on the generation of cytotoxic cells in MLC; and (6) heparin abolished endothelial cell growth factor-induced suppression of cytotoxic response. The latter two effects by themselves, however, could not fully explain the entire immunoenhancing activity of heparin. These results indicate that heparin and heparinoids have multiple effects on the immune system and that some of them can enhance, whereas others can suppress cell-mediated responses.\r"

  ".U": "89278679\r", 
  ".W": "It has been suggested that Ag-specific T cell factors play a role in the early phase of cellular immune responses. Two of these factors are studied in this paper. The first factor is specific macrophage arming factor (SMAF), that binds to (arms) macrophages and renders them specifically cytotoxic against tumor cells. The second factor is involved in the induction of an early (2 h) mast cell-dependent hypersensitivity reaction, that precedes the delayed-type hypersensitivity response (mast cell arming T cell factor; MTCF). In this study we compare both factors in an allogeneic murine tumor system (C57BL (H-2b) mice sensitized against SL2 (H-2d) lymphoma cells), both factors were: 1) dependent on T lymphocytes for their production, 2) detectable in serum 2 to 3 days after immunization, and 3) MHC (H-2)-Ag specific. Immunochemical studies showed that both factors have a molecular mass between 45 and 90 kDa and bind to the mAb 14-30 (directed against specific T cell factors), but not to anti-kappa/lambda L chain antibodies. Furthermore, it was shown that SMAF produced in vitro could induce a mast cell-dependent early 2-h hypersensitivity reaction against SL2 tumor cells, and resembled in this way MTCF. We concluded that the biologic activities and immunochemical characteristics of SMAF and MTCF are similar. Both factors are produced during the early stages of the immune response and seem to play a role in the initiation of the cell-mediated immune response.\r"

In the first year post-transplant, monocytes were of both donor and recipient origin whereas T and B cells were of donor origin. Three years after transplant, all monocytes and T and B cells were of donor origin. T lymphocytes taken from the child at that time and depleted in vitro of alloreactivity to paternal Ag proliferated in response to TT presented by maternal as well as paternal monocytes. A TT-specific T cell line established from these cells in the presence of maternal monocytes cooperated with maternal but not with paternal monocytes, whereas a TT-specific T cell line established in the presence of paternal monocytes cooperated with paternal but not with maternal monocytes and with monocytes derived from a paternal uncle who shared the haplotype inherited by the recipient from her father. These results show that long-term memory T cells restricted to recipient MHC Ag not shared with the bone marrow donor continue to circulate long after the disappearance of accessory cells of recipient origin. These T cells could potentially participate in a secondary immune response because they were shown to recognize TT presented by recipient fibroblasts induced to express class II MHC molecules following treatment with IFN-gamma.\r"

The results in the first two groups were comparable, with greater than 90% clinical cures with an average time of 16-18 w required for healing. The cure rate was considerably lower (42%) and more prolonged in the group receiving BCG alone. Secondary effects were observed in less than 5% of the patients receiving combined immunotherapy or BCG alone. In contrast, 49% of the patients receiving chemotherapy showed side effects. High therapeutic efficacy was also observed using combined immunotherapy in patients with intermediate and diffuse cutaneous leishmaniasis who were previously unresponsive to chemotherapy. Cure or clinical improvement was seen in all 11 patients with intermediate forms of the disease, and marked clinical improvement was observed in 9 of 10 patients with diffuse disease. The results on the efficacy of the combined vaccine in immunotherapy for American cutaneous leishmaniasis provide a strong rationale for studying its effectiveness in prophylactic trials.\r"

The separated strains retained stable restriction profiles through greater than 20 passages in cell culture. However, similar passage of the original mixed-strain clinical isolates gave rise to new, recombinant strains of CMV. These findings indicate that more than one strain of CMV can establish latency in normal hosts and suggest that new viral strains arise readily through recombination of existing strains.\r"

Some of these factors are known or suspected (figure 1), and they may explain observed differences in the sexual transmission of HIV in different parts of the world, notably in Africa, where genital ulcerative disease is probably influencing the epidemiology of HIV. Several studies have shown that infection in partners of HIV-infected persons is not determined solely by numbers of sexual encounters; on the contrary, HIV-infected partners have usually had fewer sexual encounters with infectious mates than have noninfected partners. Thus, sexually active persons should be cautioned that, to our knowledge, there are no nonsusceptible persons and that any single unprotected sexual encounter may lead to HIV transmission. Research into biologic factors that modulate HIV transmission continues to be hampered by difficulties in identifying HIV transmitters and nontransmitters, infective and noninfective variants of HIV (if the latter exist in vivo), and persons relatively more or less susceptible to HIV infection. However, as the number of partner studies and the number of those enrolled in them increase, a progressively clearer idea of the biologic determinants of sexual transmission of HIV should emerge.\r"

EAF-containing (EAF+) E. coli of three common classic EPEC serotypes (O111:H-, odds ratio [OR] 36.0; O111:H2, OR 55.0; O119:H6, OR 3.7) were individually strongly associated with diarrhea, as were EAF+ strains of less common classic serotypes combined (OR 5.3). Among EPEC serogroups, neither EAF+ strains of nonclassic serotypes (OR 1.8) nor EAF-strains of classic (OR 2.2) or nonclassic (OR 1.4) serotypes were significantly associated with diarrhea. At least one EAF+ non-EPEC serogroup serotype (O88:H25) may represent an unrecognized EPEC serotype. Serotype-specific variation in the association of EAF+ E. coli with diarrhea suggests that other factors are also important in determining virulence; thus, both EAF detection and E. coli serotyping are desirable in studying the etiology of diarrheal disease.\r"

A nonpiliated mutant (42-2-37-8) of the RDEC-1 strain colonized the gut lumen less readily than the parent strain. The mutant adhered infrequently to Peyer's patch lymphoid follicle epithelium (22% vs. 84%, P less than .0001). Ileal close adherence was less frequent at 3 d, but by 9 d after inoculation had increased, approaching that of the parent RDEC-1 strain. However, adherence was focal, and fewer bacteria were present at each adherence site compared with the parent RDEC-1 strain. The result was a lower frequency of diarrhea (34% vs. 65%, P = .003) and mortality (9.4% vs. 27%, P = .035) with the 42-2-37-8 strain.

Symptomatic CMV disease was identified in 21 of 25 primary infections, 2 of 16 reinfections, and 1 of 4 cases of endogenous reactivation. Before receiving a transplant, reinfected recipients had detectable neutralizing antibody to the specific reinfecting strain of CMV and to laboratory strain AD169. Following reinfection, rises in neutralizing antibody titers were observed, comparable to the responses of those with reactivation of endogenous CMV. The preexisting level of neutralizing antibody did not appear to predict clinical outcome, and moderately high levels of neutralizing antibody did not prevent viremia. Thus, posttransplant CMV reinfection occurs frequently and appears clinically, serologically, and virologically similar to reactivation of endogenous virus.\r"

In severely hyperglycemic (plasma glucose level 644 +/- 40 mg/dl) rats with streptozocin-induced diabetes that had not been treated with insulin, GFR was reduced to values below those in control rats by 2 months, whether data were expressed as milliliters per minute or as a function of kidney weight. By contrast, treatment of the diabetic rats with insulin to maintain moderate hyperglycemia (plasma glucose concentration 398 +/- 40 mg/dl) resulted in a persistent elevation of GFR compared with values in control rats. Basal production of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and 6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha (6-keto-PGF1 alpha), the stable metabolic product of prostaglandin I2 (PGl2), by glomeruli isolated from the moderately hyperglycemic rats was higher than corresponding values of glomeruli from control rats. Differences in PGE2 and 6-keto-PGF1 alpha production by glomeruli from moderately hyperglycemic and control rats were abolished by addition of arachidonate to the incubation mixture, supporting a role for enhanced availability of arachidonate in the mediation of altered vasodilatory prostaglandin production. By contrast, glomerular production of thromboxane B2 (TXB2), the stable metabolic product of thromboxane A2 (TXA2), was not different in moderately hyperglycemic rats compared with controls. Thus, enhanced production of vasodilatory prostaglandins by glomeruli from moderately hyperglycemic rats was associated with an increase in GFR.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Immunofluorescence studies indicated the presence of antithrombin III in granule-like structures in the endothelial cell. Immunoelectron microscopy studies performed with ultrathin cryosections of endothelial cells showed a colocalization of antithrombin III and a lysosomal marker protein in low electron dense organelles, indicating a lysosomal localization of antithrombin III. By using the ELISA, 77 +/- 40 ng (n = 8) antithrombin III was quantitated in 10(6) endothelial cells. Immunoprecipitation studies performed with metabolically labeled cultured human endothelial cells indicated that antithrombin III was not synthesized by the cells. Endothelial cells cultured in antithrombin III-depleted human serum did not contain antithrombin III, as was measured by ELISA. Internalization studies performed with radiolabeled purified antithrombin III and antithrombin III-thrombin complexes indicated that endothelial cells internalize antithrombin III when it is complexed to thrombin. Antithrombin III alone was not internalized by the endothelial cells.\r"

There was no operative mortality. Fourteen patients died during the follow-up, 12 of them from cardiovascular causes. The 57 surviving patients were reexamined with a mean follow-up of 7 years. The relative cumulative 5- and 10-year survival rates in all patients were 79% and 55%, respectively. At follow-up, seven (19%) of the atherosclerotic patients were classified as cured, 22 (59%) as improved and eight (22%) as failures. In the patients with fibromuscular dysplasia, 12 (60%) were normotensive without medication, and six (30%) were improved. The relative 5-year survival rates in these aetiological groups were 73% and 90%, respectively. Only complete cure of hypertension by surgery predicted a good outcome, whereas very similar survival curves were found in the improved and failed groups. This could be due to a higher incidence of target organ changes before surgery in the latter groups. A positive blood pressure response to long-term converting-enzyme inhibition correlated well with the response to surgery. Renal venous renin studies correctly predicted long-term outcome of surgery in 78% of the patients studied, but require careful preparation of the patients and interpretation of results.\r"

A pilot study on healthy volunteers was executed to investigate palatability of the two diets. The patients were randomized in a double-blind study to the two diet regimes for 14 d. A simultaneous determination of laboratory data including plasma C3c split product and urinary excretion of 51Cr-EDTA was carried out together with a careful registration of the clinical symptoms and signs. No significant effect on the stage of clinical activity was seen in CD. A significant effect on clinical activity was obtained in both UC groups. The clinical improvement was primarily due to a decrease in number of bowel movements both in the elemental diet group and in the group of patients on the blended normal diet. The gross appearance of rectal mucosa did not improve during the study period in the Pepti 2000 or in the placebo group. The concentration of complement split products in plasma remained unchanged. 51Cr-EDTA excretion, as an expression of a leaky bowel mucosa, also remained unchanged. It was concluded that an effect on inflammation could not be demonstrated even if both diets seem to have a beneficial effect on the stage of clinical activity, especially diarrhoea, in patients with UC.\r"

The first 52 patients underwent one year follow up angiography and comprise the material for this study. At one year 26 patients (50%) already had a favourable outcome (16 complete and 10 almost complete obliteration). The results were the same in the two sexes. There was a better response in younger patients: under 20 years 75% favourable, between 20 and 40 years 45% favourable and above 40 years about 25% favourable. Malformations in a lateral position appeared to respond better than those in the midline. Lesions fed by vessels from more than one large vessel territory had less chance of complete obliteration at one year than those gaining blood from only one main supply. There was no difference in outcome between small malformations (less than 2 cm3) medium (2-3 cm3) or large (greater than 3 cm3). No immediate morbidity or late side effects were encountered in these patients. Stereotactic radiosurgery is a safe and effective method in the treatment of arteriovenous malformations but there is a relatively long latency. The number of malformations obliterated is expected to be much higher when two years have elapsed after treatment.\r"

In a controlled trial of long vs short duration adjuvant chemotherapy for women with Stage II breast cancer, the Breast Cancer Chemotherapy Questionnaire (BCQ) proved valid as a measure of subjective health status and was able to distinguish long vs short arms. Well validated measures of physical and emotional function developed by the Rand Corporation were unable to distinguish between the two groups. The Eastern Co-operative Oncology Group Criteria (ECOG) distinguished the two groups, but failed criteria of clinical sensibility as a measure of subjective health status. In a study of patients with Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, the Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire (IBDQ) showed small intrasubject variability over time. Gobal ratings of change showed moderate to high correlations with changes in IBDQ score, and patients who reported overall improvement or deterioration showed large changes in IBDQ score. Each of these findings support, in different ways, the reproducibility, validity, and responsiveness of the questionnaire. While the same data can at times bear on both validity and responsiveness, when assessing evaluative instruments it is useful to make a conceptual distinction between the two.\r"

At higher doses, the drugs caused motor impairment (TD50 values, 16.3 and 43.0 mg/kg) and blocked the behavioral effects and lethality of i.p. injected N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) (ED50 values, 36.3 and 127 mg/kg). The separation in potencies in the MES seizure and motor toxicity tests of PCA and PM-THIQ contrasts with PCP which was equally potent in both tests. Several compounds that were structurally related to PM-THIQ (N-ethyl-PCA, 2-methyl-PCA, N-methyl-PM-THIQ, tetrahydroisoquinoline and benzylamine) also blocked MES seizures and caused motor impairment, but failed to show as great a separation between MES anticonvulsant activity and motor toxicity. None of the compounds protected against seizures induced by the chemoconvulsant pentylenetetrazol at doses that lacked motor toxicity. The drugs were also evaluated for their ability to displace [3H]-1-[1-(2-thienyl)-cyclohexyl]piperidine from binding to high affinity acceptor sites (presumably on NMDA receptor-coupled channels) in rat brain homogenates. The rank order of potencies in the binding assay was similar to that in the behavioral tests, except for 2-methyl-PCA which was behaviorally more potent than expected.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Rings of bovine femoral and coronary arteries were mounted for isometric tension recording in physiological saline solution. SnoCap induced dose-dependent relaxations in both the coronary and femoral arteries, but inhibited contractions in the coronary artery to a significantly greater degree. Relaxations to SnoCap were inhibited by methylene blue. Angiotensin I and angiotensin II induced dose-dependent contractions in the bovine femoral artery. The angiotensin II antagonist saralasin induced comparable inhibition of the response to angiotensin I and angiotensin II. Captopril (10(-6) M) and SnoCap (10(-6) M) equally inhibited contraction to angiotensin I, inducing a 50-fold shift in the dose-response curve. SnoCap inhibited contraction to angiotensin II, inducing a 5-fold shift in the dose-response curve and depressing the maximum response. In summary, the S-nitrosylated derivative of captopril is a unique compound that inhibits vascular reactivity through activation of soluble guanylate cyclase and inhibition of angiotensin converting enzyme. This combined nitrovasodilator and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor may have clinical utility in hypertension, coronary artery disease and congestive heart failure.\r"

  ".W": "(+)-N-Allylnormetazocine (NANM) binds to at least two sites in the mammalian central nervous system, a high-affinity, haloperidol-sensitive site and a lower-affinity site identified as the phencyclidine (PCP) receptor. The relevance of these sites to the discriminative stimulus properties of (+)-NANM was evaluated in rats trained to discriminate (+)-NANM from saline. Drugs with a high affinity for the haloperidol-sensitive site, including haloperidol, (+)-ketocyclazocine, 1,3-di-ortho-tolyl-guanidine and (-)-butaclamol failed to substitute for the (+)-NANM stimulus. In addition, when they were tested in combination with (+)-NANM, only haloperidol evidenced any antagonistic effects. The antagonistic effects of haloperidol were incomplete and only occurred at doses that substantially disrupted responding. Evidence obtained earlier that (+)-3-(3-hydroxyphenyl)-N-(1-propyl) piperidine could antagonize (+)-NANM was not replicated. On the other hand, PCP-like drugs from diverse chemical classes, including PCP, ketamine, MK-801, (-)-2-methyl-3,3-diphenyl-3-propanolamine, etoxadrol and dextrorphan, all substituted fully for the (+)-NANM stimulus with a potency predicted by their relative potency for PCP-like discriminative stimulus effects and relative affinity for the PCP receptor. Taken together, these results fail to provide evidence for an important role for the high-affinity haloperidol-sensitive binding site for (+)-NANM in its discriminative stimulus properties. Instead, activity at the PCP receptor is predictive of (+)-NANM-like effects.\r"

We now report that repeated weekly administration of a selective D1 antagonist, SCH 23390, does not produce this syndrome in cebus monkeys. Cebus monkeys were treated with either vehicle (n = 6), the specific D2 antagonist haloperidol (0.3 mg/kg p.o., n = 9) or the specific D1 antagonist SCH 23390 (10.0 mg/kg p.o., n = 9) once a week for approximately 1 year and behavioral effects were observed and scored. The drug doses used in this study produced similar sedative scores when given acutely and sedation increased over the first 12 weeks of the study for both treatment groups. However, by the 12th week of dosing with haloperidol all the monkeys showed a profound EPS characterized by limb extensions, head pushing, tongue protrusions and sometimes severe biting movements. In contrast, none of the SCH 23390-treated monkeys showed any abnormal movements, suggesting D1 antagonists have a low EPS side-effect liability. The profile of the incidence of EPS seen with classical neuroleptic drugs in cebus monkeys and their blockade of EPS by anticholinergic drugs mimics the profile seen in humans. The models presented appear to be predictive of the production of the EPS in humans and could be used to screen neuroleptics for EPS liability. Furthermore, the EPS is probably due to the selective blockade of dopamine D2 receptors with its associated enhancement of cholinergic neurotransmission.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Serum progesterone determination holds promise as a means of identifying abnormal gestations. Early diagnosis of tubal pregnancies has prompted conservative surgical treatment and the use of medical therapy in selected cases. Because of the improvement in diagnostic aids and conservative treatment, we are documenting a change in epidemiologic profiles. The incidence of ectopic pregnancy has increased, with a concomitant decrease in mortality. Fertility after conservative surgical procedures appears improved over that with radical treatment. However, women with ectopic pregnancies continue to have reduced fertility potential.\r"

The IL-2 receptor is proving to be an extraordinarily versatile therapeutic target, since it is expressed by the abnormal T cells in patients with certain lymphoid malignancies or autoimmune disorders and in individuals rejecting allografts, whereas it is not expressed by normal resting cells. Monoclonal antibodies and toxin-lymphokine conjugates directed toward IL-2 receptors represent novel therapeutic agents for these clinical conditions.\r"

A broader approach is being followed in Europe, where considerable reliance will still be placed on data from animal tumor systems. We argue the case for broader preclinical evaluation using animal model systems that are resistant to standard anticancer agents and thus reflect the clinical disease. Selection of compounds for clinical trials should be based on a therapeutic index that will give a more realistic representation of the margin between antitumor activity and toxicity to normal cells. Furthermore, preclinical evaluation can establish understanding of the factors responsible for treatment efficacy, including pharmacokinetics, metabolism, and drug bioavailability.\r"

In a preliminary investigation of the efficacy and safety of mercaptoacetylglycine in 30 adult patients with suspected renal disease we used simultaneous imaging with orthoiodohippurate as the physiological \"gold standard\". Of these patients 11 had undergone renal transplantation. Factors, such as time to peak renal activity, clearance half-life and regional functional comparison, were similar by orthoiodohippurate and mercaptoacetylglycine imaging. Visual and quantitative analysis of angiograms and renograms was markedly facilitated with the use of mercaptoacetylglycine. Several morphological abnormalities were apparent only during mercaptoacetylglycine evaluation. No adverse effects, changes in vital signs or significant changes in clinical laboratory status were encountered. Since mercaptoacetylglycine combined an excellent technetium image with the pharmacokinetics of orthoiodohippurate, mercaptoacetylglycine may supplant all other agents for routine clinical use.\r"

  ".W": "The levels of several tumor associated proteases, including plasminogen activators (PA), are elevated in many malignant tumors compared to their benign tumor counterparts. Extracellular matrix degradation mediated by PA may facilitate tumor cell invasion and metastasis. To assess whether PA content correlates with the aggressive phenotype in prostate cancer, we studied these activators in the PC-3 human prostate cell line and PC-3CALN, an aggressive in vivo derived variant cell line. Enzymatic assays using H-D-val-leu-lys-pNA (S-2251) as substrate and peroxidase-anti-peroxidase immunohistochemical techniques were used. In an in vitro chemoinvasion assay, the PC-3CALN variant cell line demonstrated significantly greater invasive behavior than the unselected, parental PC-3 line. The activity of PA secreted by PC-3CALN cells was 3.5 times greater than that of PC-3 cells (p less than 0.01). PC-3 metastases obtained following intrasplenic injection of PC-3 cells had greater PA activities than the corresponding primary tumors. Immunohistochemical studies of PC-3 tumors demonstrated preferential localization of urokinase-type PA to areas of apparent tumor cell invasion. These data suggest a correlation between PA and the aggressive phenotype in this model of human prostate cancer. PA, in particular u-PA, may play a role in the migration and invasion of prostate cancer cells and provide a marker of the aggressive phenotype.\r"

Muscarinic cholinergic and alpha 2 adrenergic receptor binding sites were studied in these tissues using saturation experiments with 3H-NMS and 3H-rauwolscine, respectively. The mean equilibrium dissociation constants for 3H-NMS binding (0.13 to 0.17 nM) in these tissues were similar (p greater than 0.05) indicating homogeneity of muscarinic cholinergic binding sites. The mean equilibrium dissociation constants for 3H-rauwolscine binding (1.27 to 1.98 nM) in these tissues were also similar (p greater than 0.05). A substantial density of MCh (1.06 to 1.22 fmol/mg. wet wt.) and alpha 2 adrenergic (0.47 to 1.11 fmol/mg. wet wt.) binding sites was identified in the intestinal tissues assayed. The density of ileal and colonic MCh and alpha 2 adrenergic binding sites was not altered following construction of urinary intestinal reservoirs. The presence of a substantial density of MCh and alpha 2 adrenergic binding sites in the intestinal tissues suggests that MCh and alpha 2 adrenergic analogs may be utilized for the management of urinary incontinence following bladder replacement with intestinal urinary reservoirs.\r"

A hypoechoic defect on ultrasound was identified in 227 of 251 patients (90 per cent) corresponding to the area of palpable nodularity or abnormal firmness. A mean of 6.25 biopsies were obtained per patient using a commercially available spring-loaded gun. Biopsies were positive for cancer in 165 of the 251 prostates (66 per cent). Palpable nodules more often were hypoechoic and more often contained cancer than less distinct areas of abnormal firmness on digital examination. Among the clinical stages B1, B2 and B3 nodules 70, 76 and 88 per cent, respectively, were positive for cancer, as were 100 per cent of the clinical stage C prostates. Of 77 abnormally firm, nonnodular prostates 36 per cent were positive for cancer. Random biopsy of the contralateral normal lobe in 56 men with clinical stage B1 or B2 nodules showed cancer present contralaterally in 42 and 60 per cent, respectively; 20 per cent had positive biopsies despite a contralateral isoechoic ultrasound. In 78 patients with prior digitally guided biopsies, ultrasound guided biopsies confirmed previously diagnosed cancers in 94 per cent. However, in 23 of 43 patients (53 per cent) with previous negative digitally guided biopsies, ultrasound guided biopsies made the new diagnosis of cancer. Complications, including post-biopsy fever and bleeding, occurred in 6 of 251 patients (2.4 per cent). The combination of the new spring-loaded biopsy guns and transrectal ultrasound guidance of biopsies provides the urologist with a tool that allows multiple prostate cores to be obtained safely and painlessly, reducing the sampling error and increasing the accuracy in diagnosing prostate cancer in the man with a palpable abnormality of the prostate.\r"

Ultrasound guided random systematic biopsy is simple and easily learned. When combined with additional directed biopsies of the rare hypoechoic areas not included in the pattern of systematic sampling, it provides a highly accurate means to diagnose prostate cancer, minimizing observer and sampling errors. This technique of prostate mapping with 6, 1.5 cm. cores provides valuable additional information on cancer volume, Gleason grade and the potential location of surgically positive margins, all without compromising the operation or the chance for a surgical cure.\r"

  ".W": "Preoperative transrectal ultrasonograms in 70 patients who underwent radical prostatectomy were compared retrospectively to the histological features of whole mount sections of the surgical specimens. In 42 cases (60 per cent) the tumor could be appreciated as a hypoechoic area on the sonogram. In only 1 case did the tumor appear as a hyperechoic area. In the other 27 cases (39 per cent) the tumor was isoechoic and could not be distinguished clearly from the surrounding tissue. The smallest tumor visualized sonographically measured 4.4 mm. in diameter in the surgical specimen. There was a statistically significant correlation among tumor echogenicity, the actual tumor size and the Gleason grade. Although there was a linear correlation between the size (maximum diameter) of the tumor measured by ultrasound and that determined from the histological sections, ultrasonography generally underestimated the size of the tumor, with the maximum diameter measured sonographically being approximately 4.8 mm. smaller than the diameter measured in the whole mount sections. Of 25 nonpalpable (stage A) tumors 9 (36 per cent) were visualized on ultrasound, while of 45 palpable (stage B) tumors 11 (21 per cent) were not. Although most clinically recognized tumors can be appreciated sonographically, the tumors that are visualized tend to be larger, less well differentiated and palpable. These features favor the use of sonography to stage and monitor established prostate cancers, and suggest that tumors detected by sonography in an early detection program are likely to be clinically important cancers.\r"

None of the patients had an objective response, although 6 (37.5 per cent) had stable disease (2 of whom had a subjective decrease in bone pain). The median duration of stable disease was 6.8 months (range 2 to 12 months) and side effects were seen in 14 patients. Nausea, vomiting or anorexia was noted in 10 patients, rash and pruritus in 2, transient abnormal liver function tests in 1 and transient pulmonary infiltrates in 1. Nine prior studies investigating the use of ketoconazole in hormone refractory metastatic prostate cancer were reviewed. Only 1 complete response was reported. A partial response was noted in 14 per cent of the patients. Most of the patients had stable or progressive disease. High dose ketoconazole as a single agent appears to have limited use in patients who have failed prior systemic therapy.\r"

Based on a randomly selected nationwide sample of beneficiaries, we analyzed differences in patient satisfaction between 2091 beneficiaries who were continuously enrolled in an HMO plan for 1 year and 1000 beneficiaries in the fee-for-service sector. We also studied the reasons for disenrollment. No significant difference in overall satisfaction was found between HMO enrollees and fee-for-service beneficiaries. However, HMO enrollees expressed less satisfaction compared with fee-for-service beneficiaries regarding the professional competence of their health care providers and the willingness of the HMO staff to discuss problems. On the other hand, HMO enrollees were more satisfied than fee-for-service beneficiaries with waiting times and claims processing. Approximately half of the disenrollment from an HMO within 1 year was attributed to misunderstanding the terms of enrollment.\r"

  ".W": "The consequences of childbearing for adolescent parents, their children, and society are severe. We have focused exclusively on one consequence of adolescent sexual activity, namely, pregnancy. In so doing we are not denying the presence of other serious consequences of sexual activity, including sexually transmitted diseases, particularly the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. For almost all young people, pregnancy should be prevented or at least delayed. Prevention is difficult, however, because it involves understanding the complexities of adolescence as a stage in the development of the individual. It also requires increased understanding of the behavioral and cultural origins of adolescent sexual activity and pregnancy. Physicians are among those with a reasonable understanding of the individual and societal factors that influence the sexual activity of adolescents. Because of their contacts with patients and families, including adolescents, they are in a pivotal position to recognize early sexual activity, to counsel young people about ways to prevent pregnancy, and to prescribe contraceptives when appropriate. Physicians should consider taking leadership positions in the community in both educational efforts and preventive services. In some communities, physicians work closely with educators in developing and teaching family life programs in the schools. They also are in influential positions to improve the availability of preventive contraceptive services through development of community-based services. The Robert Wood Johnson High-Risk Youth Programs are an excellent example of the types of community-based services that should be provided for adolescents. Physicians can serve as an educational resource about a wide spectrum of health issues for young persons and their families and communities.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Most adolescents are still psychologically immature when they initiate sexual activity. Delayed initiation of sexual activity during adolescence, therefore, is the ideal solution. Physicians are an important resource in encouraging responsible sexual behavior and preventing adolescent pregnancy and in guiding the patient and her family when adolescent pregnancy does occur. Physicians can provide age-appropriate contraceptive services and adolescent prenatal and postpartum services. They can also participate actively in community-based sex and family life educational programs as knowledgeable and respected sources of information and guidance.\r"

The method retains its specificity even under conditions of very low stringency similar to those that will occur in field diagnosis. Direct application of treated blood to nylon is possible and consistently results in the detection of fewer than 10 parasites by autoradiography in an overnight exposure. The target rRNA is stable even in dehydrated cells.\r"

  ".W": "To examine the efficacy and tolerance of pentamidine aerosol in the prevention of Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP) relapse in patients with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) being treated with zidovudine, 51 patients who had had an episode of PCP in the previous 5 months were enrolled in a randomised controlled study. 25 patients (group I) received pentamidine mesylate aerosol (4 mg/kg every 2 weeks for the first month then monthly) and zidovudine, and 26 patients (group II) zidovudine alone. 3 group I patients withdrew from pentamidine therapy prematurely and were excluded from the analysis of efficacy. Relapses of PCP occurred in 2 out of 22 (9%) group I patients and in 16 out of 26 (61%) group II patients after a mean follow-up of 10 and 8.7 months, respectively. The two groups differed significantly (p less than 0.0001) in proportions without relapse. They did not differ in proportions surviving. Bronchial intolerance was common (47%); no systemic side-effects of pentamidine were observed. Pentamidine aerosol thus seems to be effective in preventing PCP relapses in AIDS patients on zidovudine. The early termination of the trial prevented assessment of the long-term efficacy and safety of pentamidine given by aerosol.\r"

When their glucose tolerance was normal, subjects who later developed NIDDM had higher fasting and post-load insulin concentrations than controls of similar age and body mass index who did not become diabetic. Onset of IGT or NIDDM was associated with a further increase in fasting insulin concentrations, although a deterioration from IGT to NIDDM was associated with little change in insulin responses to oral glucose in spite of increased blood glucose. After the onset of NIDDM, both fasting and post-load insulin concentrations diminished. These longitudinal data show that, as glucose tolerance worsens, insulin and glucose concentrations in individuals follow the inverted-U-shaped relation previously reported in cross-sectional population studies.\r"

Stroke distance was lower after anterior (65%) than inferior infarction (75%), and was negatively correlated with peak serum aspartate aminotransferase (r = 0.47, p less than 0.001). Of 16 patients whose stroke distance on days 1-5 was below 50% of normal for age, 4 died, all within the first week. Of 84 patients whose stroke distance was 50% of normal or higher, only 1 died (at 13 days). The simple bedside measurement of stroke distance offers a practical method of monitoring left ventricular function in acute myocardial infarction: the measurement may have prognostic value.\r"

An increased rate of carriers of Klebsiella spp strains resistant to ampicillin, cefuroxime, and cephalexin and of E coli strains resistant to ampicillin was associated with the use of ampicillin, with or without gentamicin. Ampicillin and cephalosporin (86% cefuroxime) consumptions were inversely related, which probably explained the paradox that cephalosporin use (and therefore less ampicillin use) was negatively correlated with the carriage of Klebsiella spp strains resistant to ampicillin, cefuroxime, and cephalexin. The ecological impact of antibiotics was much the same among treated and untreated babies in each unit. The findings show a greater risk of drug resistance due to a related agent rather than to the drug itself and a clear indirect impact of an antibotic on the microflora of untreated patients. Ampicillin-based regimens are more likely than cefuroxime to produce drug-resistant strains in the newborn.\r"

This EIA method offers a substantial advance in the serological diagnosis of acute salmonella infections; it detects antibodies to the salmonellae of groups B and D, which constitute about 70% of culture-positive cases of human salmonellosis. Antibodies to other salmonellae are also detected. This EIA is particularly valuable for the detection of salmonella antibodies during post-infectious complications when isolation of the organism is often no longer possible.\r"

Each patient was randomised to receive either 10 mg of salbutamol nebuliser solution in 2 ml of saline or 10 mg of salbutamol in 2 ml (0.5 mg) of preservative-free ipratropium bromide. Peak flow rate (PFR) was recorded before treatment and 1 hour after beginning nebulised treatment. In 23 asthmatic patients given salbutamol alone PFR rose by a mean 31% 1 hour after treatment whereas in 33 such patients given combined treatment it rose by a mean 77% (95% confidence interval for the difference 8-84%). Patients whose PFR was below 140 l/min at entry gained maximum benefit from the combined treatment. For COPD patients the PFR rise was almost identical for both treatments. In acute asthma the immediate PFR response to a mixture of salbutamol and ipratropium bromide was better than the response to nebulised salbutamol alone. For COPD patients, the two treatments were of equal benefit.\r"

Tissue damage was evaluated using the corneal endothelium in vitro as a model system. Systematic studies were performed to determine the scaling of the tissue damage and damage range with pulse energy. For suprathreshold lesions, the radius of the damage zone varies as the cube root of the pulse energy, in agreement with simple physical scaling laws. A minimum damage range of less than 100 microns was observed for pulse energies of 8 muJ. Damage morphology was investigated by scanning electron microscopy. Three different damage patterns were observed; cell damage, cell removal, and rupture of Descemet's membrane. Different irradiation geometries were used to study damage mediated by either the shock wave or the cavitation bubble. Comparative studies using 10 ns pulses demonstrated that picosecond pulses yielded a significant reduction in collateral tissue damage.\r"

While reviews of research have failed to substantiate this general proposition, they have identified enhanced self-esteem as an empirically supported exercise outcome. Unfortunately, research in this area has tended to be simplistic in self-esteem theory and measurement and has remained incapable of addressing how or why change may occur. This paper summarizes pertinent self-esteem theory and presents an empirically based rationale for self-esteem enhancement through exercise participation. It constructs a model for examining exercise and self-esteem interactions in which components of self-structure are hierarchically organized on a basis of generality. The self-esteem model contains dimensions of competence and self-acceptance, and it is operationally defined.\r"

  ".W": "No controlled trials have been performed to assess the efficacy of liver transplantation. Because of the marked improvement in survival after liver transplantation since 1981, random assignment of patients to a control group not undergoing transplantation is considered clinically inappropriate. To assess the efficacy of liver transplantation in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis, we compared survival in 161 patients with this diagnosis who had undergone a liver transplantation with survival in patients with the same diagnosis who had been treated conservatively. The comparison was performed with use of a recently developed statistical technique, the Mayo model. All patients had undergone liver transplantation between March 1980 and June 1987 and were followed for a median of 25 months. Three months after liver transplantation, the Kaplan-Meier survival probabilities in the recipients were substantially higher than the Mayo-model \"simulated-control\" survival probabilities (P less than 0.001). At two years, the Kaplan-Meier survival probability was 0.74, whereas the mean Mayo-model survival probability was 0.31. The patients who were at low risk according to the Mayo model had the best probability of survival after liver transplantation; however, patients at all risk levels who had undergone liver transplantation had higher probabilities of survival that those who had not. We conclude that liver transplantation is an efficacious treatment in patients with advanced primary biliary cirrhosis.\r"

We describe 20 patients from the Rocky Mountain region who had group A streptococcal infections from 1986 to 1988 that were remarkable for the severity of local tissue destruction and life-threatening systemic toxicity. Among the 20 patients (median age, 36), necrotizing fasciitis with or without myositis was the most common soft-tissue infection (55 percent). Nineteen patients (95 percent) had shock, 16 (80 percent) had renal impairment, and 11 (55 percent) had acute respiratory distress syndrome. The mortality rate was 30 percent. All patients but 1 had positive tissue cultures for Streptococcus pyogenes; 12 had positive blood cultures. Most of the patients had no underlying disease; 2 used intravenous drugs. Strains of group A beta-hemolytic streptococci isolated from 10 patients were not of a single M or T type; however, 8 of the 10 strains produced pyrogenic exotoxin A (scarlet fever toxin A, a classic erythrogenic toxin), which has rarely been observed in recent years. From our study of this cluster of severe streptococcal infections with a toxic shock-like syndrome, we conclude that in our region, more virulent group A streptococci have reappeared that produce the pyrogenic toxin A associated with scarlet fever.\r"

  ".W": "During the past decade the incidence of Plasmodium falciparum malaria in the United States has increased 10-fold. Treatment may be delayed because the therapy recommended for severe or complicated disease, intravenous quinine dihydrochloride, is available only from the Centers for Disease Control. We studied 17 patients who were treated for severe or complicated P. falciparum malaria in the United States between 1985 and 1987. Five patients were treated with a continuous infusion of quinidine gluconate, 10 with an exchange transfusion in addition to the continuous infusion of quinidine gluconate, and 2 with intermittently administered intravenous quinine dihydrochloride and an exchange transfusion. All 16 patients with P. falciparum malaria (1 patient had P. vivax malaria) had hyperparasitemia at the time of diagnosis (6 to 54 percent of the erythrocytes infected; median, 13 percent). Three patients with marked hyperparasitemia (54, 38, and 30 percent) and multiple other indicators of a poor prognosis, including advanced age, died. The 13 patients who completed their courses of quinidine with or without exchange transfusion had a parasitemia level of 1.1 percent or less 28 to 72 hours (mean, 44.4 hours) after the start of therapy. Side effects of quinidine treatment were observed in only two patients, one of whom had a serum quinidine concentration above the toxic level. We conclude that the continuous infusion of quinidine gluconate is well tolerated alone and with exchange transfusion and is effective in the treatment of severe and complicated malaria.\r"

  ".W": "The diagnosis of lymphangitic spread of carcinoma in the lungs is sometimes difficult. We studied the cytologic characteristics of blood drawn through a wedged pulmonary-artery catheter from eight patients in whom lymphangitic carcinomatosis was confirmed by subsequent autopsy, lung biopsy, or clinical evaluation. The sites of the primary tumors were the prostate, breast, esophagus, and lung. Malignant cells were found in seven of the eight patients. Cytologic findings were normal in 16 of 17 patients with cancer but without pulmonary metastases and in 22 of 23 patients with nonmalignant pulmonary disorders. In a patient with cancer with tumor embolism to the lungs, the findings were positive, probably because of extensive intravascular tumor in large hepatic veins. One false positive finding occurred in a patient with extensive pulmonary infarction. Megakaryocytes, which are present in large numbers in the pulmonary capillary bed, are the hallmark of a satisfactory pulmonary vascular blood sample for pulmonary microvascular cytologic study. Familiarity with the cytologic characteristics of these cells in Papanicolaou preparations is essential to avoid mistakenly identifying them as malignant. Although transbronchial lung biopsy remains the diagnostic procedure of choice in this disorder, our findings suggest that the presence of malignant cells in pulmonary microvascular-cytology preparations in patients with cancer and unexplained dyspnea constitutes presumptive evidence of lymphangitic carcinomatosis. Pulmonary microvascular cytology may be particularly valuable when lung biopsy is refused or is thought to be too hazardous.\r"

  ".W": "Experimental studies in animals have demonstrated that the topical application of epidermal growth factor accelerates the rate of epidermal regeneration of partial-thickness wounds and second-degree burns. We conducted a prospective, randomized, double-blind clinical trial using skin-graft-donor sites to determine whether epidermal growth factor would accelerate the rate of epidermal regeneration in humans. Paired donor sites were created in 12 patients who required skin grafting for either burns or reconstructive surgery. One donor site from each patient was treated topically with silver sulfadiazine cream, and one was treated with silver sulfadiazine cream containing epidermal growth factor (10 micrograms per milliliter). The donor sites were photographed daily, and healing was measured with the use of planimetric analysis. The donor sites treated with silver sulfadiazine containing epidermal growth factor had an accelerated rate of epidermal regeneration in all 12 patients as compared with that in the paired donor sites treated with silver sulfadiazine alone. Treatment with epidermal growth factor significantly decreased the average length of time to 25 percent and 50 percent healing by approximately one day and that to 75 percent and 100 percent healing by approximately 1.5 days (P less than 0.02). Histologic evaluation of punch-biopsy specimens taken from the centers of donor sites three days after the onset of healing supported these results. We conclude that epidermal growth factor accelerates the rate of healing of partial-thickness skin wounds. Further studies are required to determine the clinical importance of this finding.\r"

  ".W": "The microvascular complications of diabetes mellitus may be caused, in part, by poor glycemic control. Diabetic patients who have received renal allografts may have new glomerular lesions that are manifested structurally by increases in mesangial and glomerular volume. Successful pancreas transplantation produces long-term normoglycemia and provides a unique opportunity to evaluate the impact of the normalization of the blood glucose level on the development of the renal lesions typical of diabetes mellitus in transplanted kidneys. We obtained biopsy specimens from the functioning renal allografts of 12 patients with insulin-dependent (Type I) diabetes before successful pancreas transplantation (performed one to seven years after renal transplantation) and repeated the biopsy at least 1.9 years later. In renal biopsy specimens obtained before pancreas transplantation, the mesangial volume was normal or modestly increased and the glomerular basement membrane was moderately thickened. At follow-up, no progression could be detected in any structural measure in the glomerulus. Furthermore, the recipients of pancreas transplants had smaller glomerular volumes than 13 matched diabetic patients who were recipients of renal allografts but who did not undergo pancreas transplantation (mean +/- SD, 1.80 +/- 0.55 vs. 2.47 +/- 0.73 x 10(6) microns 3; P = 0.02) and showed markedly less mesangial expansion (mesangial-volume fraction, 0.19 +/- 0.07 vs. 0.31 +/- 0.10 microns 3 per cubic micrometer; P = 0.004). We conclude that successful pancreas transplantation is associated with significantly less severe diabetic glomerulopathy in kidneys previously transplanted into diabetic patients. These data support the hypothesis that normoglycemia can prevent the progression of diabetic glomerulopathy in humans.\r"

  ".W": "Genetic studies in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe have established that a critical element required for the G2----M-phase transition in the cell cycle is encoded by the cdc2+ gene. The product of this gene is a serine/threonine protein kinase, designated p34cdc, that is highly conserved functionally from yeast to man2 and has a relative molecular mass of 34,000 (34 K). Purified maturation-promoting factor (MPF) is a complex of p34cdc2 and a 45K substrate that appears in late G2 phase and is sufficient to drive cells into mitosis. This factor has been identified in all eukaryotic cells, and in vitro histone H1 is the preferred substrate for phosphorylation. The increase in the activity of H1 kinase in M-phase is associated with a large increase in total cell protein phosphorylation which is believed to be a consequence of MPF activation. We show here that the H1 kinase activity of p34cdc2 oscillates during the cell cycle in Xenopus, and maximal activity correlates with the dephosphorylated state of p34cdc2. Direct inactivation of MPF in vitro is accompanied by phosphorylation of p34cdc2 and reduction of its protein kinase activity.\r"

However, New Zealanders do not suffer from the Se-responsive ills that afflict their farm animals and some people in China. New Zealanders, particularly those in the South Island, may have adapted to their low Se environment by thriftiness in urinary excretion of Se. Low glutathione peroxidase activities in their tissues have not resulted in noticeable damage or changes. The enzyme activity can be raised to a plateau by Se supplements, but there is no evidence that supplementation leads to better health. Since patterns of coronary heart disease, hypertension, and cancer in New Zealand resemble those in other Western countries, no direct link between these diseases and Se level is likely.\r"

All women had a routine ultrasonic scan in weeks 16-18 for the purpose of dating. The mean (+/- SD) modified Bishop score on entry to the study was 4.15 +/- 2.0 for nulliparas and 4.90 +/- 2.1 for multiparas. The duration beyond 294 days to spontaneous onset of labor varied little (mean 3.5-4.5 days) for nulliparas with scores greater than 2 and for multiparas regardless of score. Nulliparous women with a poor score (less than 3) had spontaneous onset of labor and delivery within a mean of 9.8 days. Half of the multiparas (50.0%) and 43.9% of the nulliparas gave birth within 3 days. About 90% of all women gave birth within 7 days. All but three had a vaginal delivery; the instrumental vaginal delivery rate was 16.3%. The results suggest that in postterm women dated with a second-trimester ultrasonic scan, the cervical scores are in general more favorable than previously reported in series not dated with early scans. The postterm group is also much smaller, and the time interval from entry into the postterm period to spontaneous onset of labor is shorter.\r"

This enabled us to predict whether the hydrops was due to anemia-related causes (isoimmunization, fetomaternal hemorrhage, alpha-thalassemia) or non-anemia-related causes. Fetuses without anemia as the cause of hydrops most often exhibited pleural effusions (87%) or marked edema (62.5%). A combination of pleural effusions and marked edema was evident in fetuses without anemia 56.3% of the time. Those with anemia as the cause of hydrops were significantly less likely to exhibit pleural effusions (20%), marked edema (10%), or pleural effusions and marked edema (10%). A thickened placenta occurred significantly more frequently (80 versus 37%) in anemia-associated hydrops. With the use of cordocentesis and intravascular in utero transfusion, the early recognition and treatment of hydrops fetalis due to anemia should lead to improved outcome in fetuses so affected.\r"

They were divided into three groups: group 1, 2.5-2.9; group 2, 3.0-3.9; and group 3, over 4.0 multiples of the median. These groupings determined the relationship to adverse pregnancy outcome, defined as fetal death, fetus with significant anomalies, and prematurity/growth retardation. The overall risk of adverse outcome after an initial elevation was 38%, after excluding pregnancies with incorrect dates or multiple gestations with levels below 4.5 multiples of the median: 27, 39, and 45% in groups 1, 2, and 3, respectively. This risk rose to 86% for levels over 6.0 multiples of the median. There was a significant positive correlation between abnormalities and death detected with ultrasound and amniocentesis and those indicated by increasing MSAFP levels: 10, 20, and 31% in groups 1, 2, and 3, respectively. After normal ultrasound and amniocentesis studies, there was a trend toward increasing risks for fetal death after 20 weeks between groups 2 and 3 (5 and 11%), but not for growth retardation/prematurity (12, 17, and 13%). After an elevated MSAFP, the overall risk of a late pregnancy complication after normal ultrasound and amniocentesis was 22%: 19, 23, and 25% in groups 1, 2, and 3, respectively. This figure increased to 67% for levels above 6.0 multiples of the median.\r"

A system of indication-based obstetric ultrasound discovered 124 abnormal fetuses (34%) at 22 weeks or less and 240 (66%) at 23 weeks or more. Most fetal abnormalities found at 23 weeks or more were probably detectable earlier, because the pattern of abnormalities discovered was reasonably similar in the two groups. Discovery of abnormal fetuses at 22 weeks or less was associated with a 67% termination rate and an 11% postnatal survival rate, whereas discovery at 23 weeks or more was associated with a 14% termination rate and a 51% postnatal survival rate. For fetal abnormalities not detected until 23 weeks or more, the indications that led to detection were present earlier in only 28%, and any indications were present earlier in only 44%. This study raises serious concern about the ability of the indication-based obstetric ultrasound system commonly used in the United States to detect fetal abnormalities before therapeutic options become limited. Evaluation of alternative systems for timing of obstetric ultrasound appears to be warranted.\r"

We tested sizes 2/0 and 4/0 (United States Pharmacopeia [USP]) coated polyglycolic acid and coated polyglactin-910 sutures, and two different knots. In addition, we measured the volume of the different knots and the total volume of tissue reaction surrounding the knots. Multivariate analysis showed only suture material and suture size to be independent factors determining tissue reaction. An increase of suture size resulted in a more than four- to sixfold increase in knot volume and a more than two- to threefold increase in the amount of the tissue-reaction sheath; however, the addition of extra throws to the knot enlarged the knot body by a factor of ony 1.5 and the tissue-reaction sheath by a factor of 1.0-1.9. These findings suggest that the use of thick-gauge suture material adds much more to the total amount of foreign body and tissue reaction in the wound than the addition of extra throws to the knot and might, therefore, be deleterious to optimum wound healing.\r"

Consistent and proper use of contraception, especially condoms, should be encouraged. Patients with a history of cervicitis or other STDs should be targeted for being at high risk and should have periodic screening tests to search for pathogens such as N. gonorrhoeae and C. trachomatis, even at times when they are asymptomatic. Other groups, including patients with multiple sexual partners, those with genitourinary symptoms, pregnant adolescents, and some adolescent clinic populations, also should be considered at increased risk and be monitored similarly. To be effective, encounters with adolescents around matters related to sexuality and STD must be done privately and with confidentiality assured. Special attention should be paid to the adolescent's family and cultural milieu, as well as to their level of psychosocial development, so that specific needs, fears, and misconceptions can be addressed. Cervicitis and other STDs are so common and have such important personal and public health implications that identification and effective treatment are of critical importance. The general tendency to be parsimonious when fitting together signs and symptoms into a medical diagnosis must be modified when dealing with STDs as multiple concomitant infections do occur routinely.\r"

Amenorrheic patients who have sufficient estrogen effect on their endometrium to have withdrawal bleeding following exposure to progestins should be cycled with progestins on a regular basis to prevent endometrial hyperplasia. Estrogen replacement with cyclic progestin should be considered in the hypoestrogenic adolescent with prolonged amenorrhea. The long-term consequences of hypothalamic amenorrhea in adolescents remain to be determined.\r"

  ".W": "Pregnancy testing and counseling are increasingly accepted as necessary services for adolescents within the primary care setting. For teenagers in need of a pregnancy test, the easy-to-perform, highly sensitive and specific enzyme immunoassay analysis for measuring beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (beta-HCG) is ideal. However, no single beta-HCG analysis should be taken as absolute evidence for the presence or absence of pregnancy. Instead, an integrated approach using all of the health care professional's skills in adolescent health care should be taken. In some cases a careful history and physical examination will confirm the pregnancy. At other times serial quantitative serum HCG titers, pelvic ultrasonography, and culdocentesis may be necessary to rule out the possibility of ectopic pregnancy or threatened abortion. For more than three quarters of pregnant adolescents the pregnancy is unplanned and may represent a major conflict for themselves, their partner, and their families. When such an event occurs the health care professional will frequently be sought as a resource. Successful pregnancy counseling has many components. The adolescent will need to visualize the counselor as an available, sensitive, nonjudgmental individual who believes in the right of the pregnant teenager ultimately to progress to her own decision. The counseling process should be firmly based on an understanding of adolescent psychosocial and biologic development, crises intervention techniques, and family dynamics. The counselor needs to be a reliable information source. If the adolescent decides to go to term, programs offering comprehensive prenatal services to teenagers should be identified. Information concerning high-quality, low-cost abortion services also will need to be available for those who wish to terminate. It is important to monitor the quality of care given in prenatal and abortion service referrals. Few adolescents currently choose to place their babies for adoption. Counseling in this area is especially needed. Several types of adoption procedures are available and at appropriate times during a teenager's neonatal care adoption should be presented as a reasonable alternative to parenthood. Throughout this process, the health care professional will have opportunities to discuss a wide variety of health related topics with the adolescent and often her partner and their respective families. Ideally, whatever her final decision, it is the goal of the counselor to make the experience a positive and maturing influence on her life and the lives of other persons involved.\r"

Barrier methods of contraception offer adolescents protection against both pregnancy and STDs, but innovative approaches are needed to enhance availability and acceptability. Condom use in conjunction with a vaginal spermicide would provide optimal protection. The \"female condom\" may prove to be an effective alternative. Diaphragms and cervical caps can be prescribed for well-educated, highly motivated adolescents comfortable with insertion and removal. The vaginal contraceptive sponge provides many of the advantages of the diaphragm and cap without the need for an examination and fitting and also may be used as a backup method with the condom. Vaginal spermicides used alone are significantly less effective than in combination with a mechanical barrier. The IUD is not considered appropriate for most adolescents due to its association with an increased risk of pelvic infection. Periodic abstinence requires accurate identification of the fertile period, extensive education, and partner cooperation. Sterilization is rarely considered an option in adolescents. Alternate forms of sexual expression are available to adolescents who choose to abstain from intercourse.\r"

The preassembled digalactoside alpha-D-galactopyranosyl-(1----4)-beta-D-galactopyranose-binding adhesin was purified to homogeneity from the periplasmic space in a complex with the periplasmic assembly protein PapD by affinity chromatography to alpha-D-galactopyranosyl-(1----4)-beta-D-galactopyranose-Sepharose. A receptor-binding domain was mapped to the amino-terminal half of the adhesin. The interaction of PapD with PapG, which was required for the incorporation of the adhesin into the pilus, was found to protect PapG from proteolytic cleavages and enhanced the processing of the PapG signal peptide. A preassembly domain necessary for forming a complex with PapD was mapped to the carboxyl terminus of PapG.\r"

In HeLa cells, p34 kinase has previously been shown to exist in both a low- and a high-molecular-mass form, the latter of which is only found in cells in the G2/M phase of the cell cycle and contains a 62-kDa subunit. Here we show that although each form of the kinase phosphorylates casein in vitro, only the high-molecular-mass form uses histone H1 as substrate. The high-molecular-mass form of p34 kinase from nocodazole-treated HeLa cells was purified 6700-fold. The apparent molecular mass of the mitotic CDC2-encoded protein kinase complex was 220 kDa. The purified enzyme phosphorylated not only its endogenous 62-kDa subunit but also phosphorylated histone H1 with a Km of 3 microM and used ATP 40 times more efficiently than GTP (Km 54 microM and 2 mM, respectively). The enzyme activity was unaffected by cAMP, calcium/calmodulin, or by the heat-stable inhibitor of cAMP-dependent protein kinase. These characteristics are typical of growth-associated histone H1 kinase from different organisms. These results suggest that CDC2 protein may be activated as an M-phase-specific protein kinase in part by its association with the p62 subunit.\r"

This approach was used to recover a full-length fusion product in Escherichia coli containing the human insulin-like growth factor II (IGF-II). Surprisingly, the recombinant IGF-II showed increased stability against proteolytic degradation in E. coli when produced as a dual affinity fusion protein, as compared to an N-terminal fusion protein. After site-specific cleavage of the tripartite fusion protein, IGF-II molecules with immunological and receptor binding activity were obtained without renaturation steps. The results demonstrate that proteins can fold into biologically active structures, even if provided with large flanking heterologous protein domains. The concept was further used to characterize the specific degradation of recombinant IGF-II in this heterologous host.\r"

Here it is shown that this enzyme also catalyzes the ATP-dependent unwinding of a DNA.RNA hybrid consisting of a radioactively labeled RNA molecule annealed on M13 single-stranded DNA. The DNA.RNA unwinding reaction required less protein to unwind more base pairs than the corresponding unwinding of duplex DNA. In addition, the rate of unwinding of the DNA.RNA hybrid was more than an order of magnitude faster than unwinding of a DNA partial duplex of similar length. The unwinding of the DNA.RNA hybrid is a property unique to helicase II since helicase I, Rep protein, and helicase IV failed to catalyze the reaction. In light of these results it seems likely that helicase II is involved in some previously unrecognized aspect of nucleic acid metabolism, in addition to its known roles in DNA repair reactions.\r"

Expression of URF13 in Escherichia coli imparts pathotoxin sensitivity to the bacterium. We show by ion uptake studies in E. coli that a pathotoxin-URF13 interaction causes membrane permeability. Similarly, mitochondrial dysfunction caused by membrane permeabilization probably accounts for increased colonization of maize carrying the Texas cytoplasm by toxin-producing pathogens. Site-directed mutagenesis studies show that approximately one-quarter of the amino acids at the carboxyl end of URF13 can be eliminated without affecting toxin sensitivity. We have identified two dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCCD) binding sites in the URF13 protein and show that one of the sites is involved in conferring DCCD protection against the pathotoxin. Substitutional mutations at this DCCD binding site also eliminate toxin sensitivity.\r"

Further, amino acid sequence comparisons of T5 DNA polymerase with a large group of DNA polymerases previously shown to exhibit little similarity to polymerase I indicate certain sequence segments are shared among distantly related DNA polymerases. These shared regions have been implicated in the 3'----5' exonuclease function of polymerase I, which suggests that the proofreading domains of all these enzymes may be evolutionarily related.\r"

When cultured rat pituitary cells were permeabilized by digitonin for 5 min in the absence of Ca2+, endogenous PKC activity was decreased by 72%. PKC depletion was also achieved by prior treatment (24 hr) with high concentrations of phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA). When purified activated brain PKCs were added for 30 min to PMA-pretreated, digitonin-permeabilized cells, only alpha- and beta- but not gamma-type PKC stimulated luteinizing hormone release. Since PKC was implicated as a mediator of gonadotropin secretion, gonadotropin-releasing hormone might utilize alpha- and beta-type PKCs for stimulation of gonadotropin secretion; alpha- and beta-type PKCs might participate also in other exocytotic responses in diverse biological systems in which PKC was implicated.\r"

  ".W": "Fetal pancreatic beta cells demonstrate a deficient insulin release in response to glucose, but the underlying mechanism at the cellular level is unknown. By using beta cells from 21-day fetal rats we made an attempt to clarify the mechanism(s) behind this reduced glucose response. In addition to measuring insulin release, glucose metabolism, and cellular ATP content, ATP-regulated K+ channels (G channels) and voltage-activated Ca2+ currents were investigated with the patch-clamp technique. It was thus demonstrated that the ATP-regulated K+ channels in fetal beta cells were not sensitive to glucose but otherwise had similar characteristics as those of adult beta cells. Also, the characteristics of the voltage-activated Ca2+ currents were similar in adult and fetal beta cells. However, as judged from measurements of both glucose oxidation and glucose utilization, glucose metabolism was impaired in fetal beta cells. In addition, there was no increase in the ATP content, even when the cells were stimulated for 30 min. It is therefore concluded that the attenuated glucose-induced insulin release in fetal pancreatic beta cells is due to an immature glucose metabolism resulting in impaired regulation of the ATP-sensitive K+ channels. These findings may be relevant to the understanding of the deficient stimulus-secretion coupling associated with non-insulin-dependent diabetes.\r"

  ".W": "The role of microtubules in 3H-labeled protein secretion in rat lacrimal glands was probed by the use of colchicine and two of its analogues that reversibly bind to tubulin. These analogues were 2-methoxy-5-(2,3,4,4'-trimethoxyphenyl)-2,4,6-cycloheptatriene-1-o ne and 2,3,4,4'-tetramethoxy-1,1'-biphenyl, the latter having been synthesized for these studies. Immunofluorescence revealed that untreated exocrine acinar cells contained an intact microtubule network, which was totally abolished by drug addition. Subsequent drug removal restored the network for the two reversibly binding drugs--more rapidly so for the biphenyl, but this was not the case with colchicine. The protein-secretory process was examined by adding the three drugs at various stages--prepulse incubation, pulse, maturation, apical storage of granules, and discharge under cholinergic stimulation. Comparison with the kinetics of microtubular network restoration, which differed for the two reversibly binding drugs, led to the conclusion that the microtubular system is critical to the maturation phase of secretion.\r"

In the present study, we have documented the development of human multipotential blast cell colonies from single cells by daily observation of the growth of candidate progenitors. The results clearly demonstrated that early hemopoietic progenitors may remain as single cells for more than 2 weeks of incubation. Once the progenitors began proliferation, the subsequent growth was characterized by steady cell doubling. Next, we tested the survival of blast cell colony progenitors in the presence of neutralizing antibodies prepared against early acting hemopoietic factors including interleukin (IL) 1 alpha, IL-1 beta, IL-3, IL-6, and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor. Cultures were initiated with individual antibodies, and, on day 14, IL-3 and the corresponding growth factor in concentrations that neutralize the antibodies were added. On days 18-27 of culture, blast cell colonies containing 25 or more cells were identified and replated for analysis of their ability to form secondary colonies. The cumulative frequency of the blast cell colonies in cultures containing antibody did not differ significantly from that of the control group containing rabbit IgG. A combination of anti-IL-1 alpha, anti-IL-1 beta, anti-IL-6, and anti-granulocyte colony-stimulating factor did not affect the survival of dormant blast cell colony-forming cells. These results indicate that survival of hemopoietic stem cells in the G0 period of the cell cycle is independent of early hemopoietic regulators.\r"

  ".W": "Mice were repopulated with small numbers of retrovirally marked hematopoietic cells operationally definable as totipotent hematopoietic stem cells, without engraftment of cells at later stages of hematopoiesis, in order to facilitate analysis of stem cell clonal histories. This result depended upon the use of unirradiated W/Wv newborn recipients. Before transplantation, viral integration markers were introduced during cocultivation of fetal liver or bone marrow cells with helper cell lines exporting defective recombinant murine retroviruses of the HHAM series. Omission of selection in culture [although the vector contained the bacterial neomycin-resistance (neo) gene] also limited the proportion of stem cells that were virally labeled. Under these conditions, engraftment was restricted to a small population of marked and unmarked normal donor stem cells, due to their competitive advantage over the corresponding defective cells of the mutant hosts. A relatively simple and coherent pattern emerged, of one or a few virally marked clones, in contrast to previous studies. In order to establish the totipotent hematopoietic stem cell identity of the engrafted cells, tissues were sampled for viral and inbred-strain markers for periods close to one year after transplantation. The virally labeled clones were characterized as stem cell clones by their extensive self-renewal and by formation of the wide range of myeloid and lymphoid lineages tested. Results clearly documented concurrent contributions of cohorts of stem cells to hematopoiesis. A given stem cell can increase or decrease its proliferative activity, become completely inactive or lost, or become active after a long latent period. The contribution of a single clone present in a particular lineage was usually between 5% and 20%.\r"

  ".U": "89282814\r", 
  ".W": "The GCN2 protein of Saccharomyces cerevisiae stimulates the expression of amino acid biosynthetic genes under conditions of amino acid starvation by derepressing GCN4, a transcriptional activator of these genes. GCN2 contains sequences homologous to the catalytic domain of protein kinases. We show here that substitution of a highly conserved lysine in the presumed ATP-binding site of this domain impairs the derepression of histidine biosynthetic genes under GCN4 control. This result supports the idea that protein kinase activity is required for GCN2 positive regulatory function. Determination of the nucleotide sequence of the entire GCN2 complementation unit, and measurement of the molecular weight of GCN2 protein expressed in vivo, indicate that GCN2 is a Mr approximately 180,000 protein and contains a Mr approximately 60,000 segment homologous to histidyl-tRNA synthetases (HisRSs) juxtaposed to the protein kinase domain. Several two-codon insertion mutations in the HisRS-related coding sequences inactivate GCN2 regulatory function. Based on these results, we propose that the GCN2 HisRS domain responds to the presence of uncharged tRNA by activating the adjacent protein kinase moiety, thus providing a means of coupling GCN2-mediated derepression of GCN4 expression to the availability of amino acids.\r"

The frameshifting event is likely to have occurred at the sequence AAAAAC where the insA frame overlaps the B' frame.

Both receptors have been described as heterogeneous 90-kDa transmembrane glycoproteins, referred to here as gp90. Monoclonal anti-HAR antibodies, Hermes-1 and Hutch-1, and monoclonal anti-ECMRIII antibodies, P1G12 and P3H9, were utilized to compare the two receptors. (i) All these monoclonal antibodies immunoprecipitated major gp90 components as well as uncharacterized additional higher molecular mass antigens of 120-200 kDa in human and macaque fibroblasts and peripheral blood mononuclear cells. (ii) Competitive binding analyses with the antibodies identified distinct epitopes present on gp90. (iii) Enzymatic and chemical digestions generated identical peptide fragments from all the antigens in human and macaque fibroblasts and peripheral blood mononuclear cells. (iv) Sequential immunoprecipitation with P1G12 followed by the other monoclonal antibodies indicated that all gp90 species reactive with Hermes-1 and Hutch-1 also expressed the P1G12 defined epitope. In reciprocal experiments, Hermes-1 and Hutch-1 immunoprecipitation did not completely remove all P1G12-reactive gp90 from cellular extracts. One inference from these data would be that gp90 is serologically heterogeneous, encompassing HARs as a major subset of this broadly expressed class of molecules.\r"

We report here the molecular cloning from a baboon lymphoid cell line of a cDNA that encodes an adhesion receptor for HEV.

The mature protein, resulting from the cleavage of a putative 20-amino acid signal peptide, has a calculated molecular mass of only 37 kDa, indicating that the 90-kDa cell surface protein is highly modified. The 342 amino acids, which lack any repeated sequences of significant length, encompass an extracellular domain (250 amino acids), a putative transmembrane domain (20 amino acids), and a cytoplasmic domain (72 amino acids).\r"

We had suggested that anti-DNA antibodies bind to cell-surface protein(s) of several cells. When the mAb of this crude supernatant was purified on a dsDNA-cellulose column and a histone-Trisacryl column, the mAb no longer bound to the cell surface. Only when dsDNA plus purified histones was added to the purified antibody did the immune complex strongly and uniformly stain again the cell surface of CVI cells. No significant staining was observed if either DNA or histones were omitted. A signal 94-kDa protein from membrane fractions of CVI, Raji, and RINm cell lines was visualized in immunoblots when mAb-DNA-histone complexes were applied to the nitrocellulose strips. No polypeptide was seen if one component was omitted. This 94-kDa protein behaved like a plasma membrane protein since it required the use of detergent to be solubilized and was quantitatively recovered in the Triton X-114 detergent-rich phase. Moreover, a brief treatment of living cells with trypsin cleared off this protein. Purified nucleosomes could be substituted to DNA-histone complexes, giving rise to identical results. Finally, purified polyclonal anti-DNA antibodies from sera of systemic lupus erythematosus patients labeled a 94-kDa protein provided that DNA-histone complexes were added. Anti-DNA autoantibodies could be pathogenic when they are bound to nucleosomes.\r"

We demonstrate that MHC molecules may have nonimmune functions in modulating tumor cell growth in addition to their classical role in antitumor immunity. A human neuroendocrine carcinoma cell line, COLO 320, with low levels of endogenous class I expression was transfected with the murine H-2Ld gene. Eleven independent stable clones were established, four containing only pRSV-neo and seven also containing varying copy numbers of the transfected Ld gene. The ability of the different clones to grow as colonies in soft agar correlated strongly with the relative amounts of Ld antigen expression (r = 0.89; P less than 0.001). There was a weaker correlation between increased clonogenic ability and higher levels of Ld mRNA (r = 0.67; P less than 0.05). There was no correlation between clonogenic ability and relative expression of amplified c-myc gene or of integrated pRSV-neo. Furthermore, in nude mice, Ld antigen expression was associated with increased formation of metastatic lung colonies 6 weeks after intravenous injection of 10(5) cells. These observations are consistent with the concept that MHC class I antigens may have a role in modulating the growth potential of certain tumor cells independent of their involvement in immune responses.\r"

As previous data suggested that protein kinase C plays an important role in the action of insulin and in the insulin-like effects of hGH in rat adipocytes, we tested the effects of sphingosine, a potent inhibitor of protein kinase C, on the lipogenic activity of both hormones. At 50 microM, sphingosine had no effect on basal lipogenesis but completely abolished the action of phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate and decreased by 65% and 89%, respectively, the effects of hGH and insulin. At higher concentrations (100 microM), sphingosine abolished both basal and hormone-stimulated lipogenesis; this effect was partially reversible after washing the cells. Similar effects of sphingosine on basal and stimulated glucose uptake were seen in parallel, suggesting that sphingosine inhibits lipogenesis at the glucose-uptake step in rat adipocytes. N-Acetylsphingosine and sphingomyelin, two analogs of sphingosine that are inactive on protein kinase C, did not inhibit lipogenesis induced by hGH, insulin, or phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate. Sphingosine did not inhibit insulin binding to rat adipocytes at concentrations up to 200 microM but decreased hGH binding to its receptors by 44% at 50 microM. These data suggest a direct link between the inhibition of protein kinase C and that of lipogenesis and provide new evidence for the involvement of protein kinase C in the mechanism of action of growth hormone and insulin in rat adipocytes.\r"

Although fresh chimpanzee serum was found to have pronounced infection-enhancing properties in the absence of antibody to HIV-1, this effect was abolished by heat inactivation (57 degrees C, 1 hr) or treatment with cobra venom anticomplementary protein. Heat-inactivated, HIV-1 antibody-positive chimpanzee serum could enhance HIV-1 infection of MT-2 cells in vitro when combined with fresh, normal human serum. By serial serum samples from three HIV-1-infected chimpanzees, HIV-1 antibody-positive chimpanzees are shown to develop enhancing antibodies early in infection (2 mo postchallenge), whereas neutralizing antibodies develop later. Over the course of HIV-1 infection, this enhancing activity decreases while neutralizing activity increases, suggesting a possible role for enhancing and neutralizing activities in HIV-1 pathogenesis. The enhancing activity of an IgG fraction used to passively immunize chimpanzees against HIV-1 infection is shown to be present at dilutions as high as 1:65,000, offering an interesting possible reason for the failure of passive immunization to protect chimpanzees from HIV infection. These results suggest that serum from HIV-1-immunized chimpanzees might be tested to determine whether current HIV-1 candidate vaccines induce production of antibodies that mediate antibody-dependent enhancement of HIV-1 infection in this in vitro assay.\r"

Nineteen distinctive electrophoretic types (ETs), representing multilocus clonal genotypes, were identified. Mean genetic diversity per locus among ETs of isolates of the same serotype was, on average, nearly equal to that in all 19 ETs. Cluster analysis of the ETs revealed two primary phylogenetic divisions at a genetic distance of 0.65. A single clone (ET 1) represented by 40 isolates expressing type III antigen formed division I. Division II was composed of 18 ETs in three major lineages diverging from one another at distances greater than 0.35 and included strains of all six antigenic classes. The type III organisms in division I produce more extracellular neuraminidase and apparently are more virulent than the type III strains in division II, which are related to strains of other serotypes that cause disease much less frequently. The existence of this unusually virulent clone accounts, in major part, for the high morbidity and mortality associated with infection by type III organisms.\r"

Additional analysis indicated that the deduced Fc-receptor protein contains a proline-rich region and membrane anchor region highly similar to that of M protein. In view of these results, we postulated that Fc-receptor and M-protein genes of group A streptococci are the products of gene duplication from a common ancestral gene.

  ".W": "Eight pediatric patients with giant congenital nevi confluent over 21 to 51 percent body surface area were treated by excision and grafting. The nevus was excised to the muscle fascia, and the open wound was grafted with cultured epithelial autografts and split-thickness skin grafts. The patients have been followed from 17 to 56 months. Seventeen operations were performed in the eight patients, excising a mean of 6.9 percent body surface area at each procedure. The mean duration of anesthesia was 3.7 hours, and the mean operative blood loss was 12.3 percent estimated blood volume. The mean \"take\" for the cultured epithelial autografts was 68 percent, and for the split-thickness skin grafts, 84 percent. Epithelialization of open wound areas adjacent to the grafts was somewhat slower for the cultured epithelial autografts than for the split-thickness skin grafts, but it led to a healed wound in all patients except one. Ten of the 17 areas grafted with cultured epithelial autografts resulted in small open wounds that required regrafting. Wound contraction under the cultured epithelial autografts and under split-thickness skin grafts was similar and depended more on the anatomic site grafted than on the type of graft employed. in 16 of 17 operations, the cultured epithelium remained as a permanent, durable skin coverage. The use of cultured epithelial autografts allowed a larger area of excision than would have been possible with split-thickness skin grafts alone and, therefore, a more rapid removal of nevus. Cultured epithelial autograft are an important new technique in the care of patients with giant congenital nevi.\r"

  ".W": "The groin flap is a reliable and well-established reconstructive option for pedicled or free-tissue transfer. Concern regarding its variable vascular origin and caliber has limited its use. To overcome this, a simplified guideline based on the transverse diameter of the patient's index and long fingers at the distal interphalangeal level has been developed. Thus \"rule of two finger widths\" positions the origin of the vascular pedicle from the femoral vessels two finger widths below the inguinal ligament, the upper flap border two finger widths above the inguinal ligament, the lower flap border two finger widths below the vascular origin, and both parallel to the flap axis, which lies along a line from the vascular origin to the anterosuperior iliac spine. This new groin flap design provides the necessary guidelines for vascular identification, accommodates pediatric and adult stature, and ensures primary donor-site closure if flap dimensions are within the prescribed boundaries. In addition, a new sartorius-cutaneous groin flap is presented. This combines the cutaneous groin flap with the proximal sartorius muscle (up to 15 cm), which is supplied by the deep vessels of the superficial circumflex iliac system. The sartorius-cutaneous groin flap further emphasizes the concept of single-pedicle compound or combined flaps and additionally enhances the extensive reconstructive versatility of previously described groin flaps. Over 200 pedicled and free groin flaps have been performed according to the \"rule of two finger widths\" over the past 5 years. There have been no complications related to flap design, such as difficulty with flap elevation, marginal necrosis, or donor-site closure.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Two single-copy genes have now been cloned from a library of yeast artificial chromosome clones that was prepared from total human DNA. Multiple, independent isolates were obtained of the genes encoding factor IX and plasminogen activator inhibitor type 2. The clones, which ranged in size from 60 to 650 kilobases, were stable on prolonged propagation in yeast and appear to contain faithful replicas of human DNA.\r"

When the cell-free supernatant products of activated cloned T helper (TH) cells were found to mediate helper activity with antigen specificity identical to that of intact T cells, experiments were carried out to determine whether this functional activity was mediated by a cell-free form of TCR-related material. A disulfide-linked dimer indistinguishable from the T cell surface alpha beta heterodimer was precipitated from cell-free supernatants of cloned TH cells with F23.1, a monoclonal antibody specific for a TCR V beta 8 determinant. Moreover, when cell-free TH products were bound to and eluted from immobilized F23.1, these affinity-purified materials had antigen-specific and major histocompatibility complex-restricted helper activity that synergized with recombinant lymphokines in the generation of B cell antibody responses. These findings suggest that the factor isolated from T cell supernatants is a cell-free form of the TCR alpha beta dimer.\r"

Group 1 was made up of the 25 subjects whose levels of plasma renin activity were the lowest (1.93 +/- 0.70 ng/ml/hr). Group 2 comprised the 26 subjects with the highest plasma renin activity levels (4.80 +/- 0.84 ng/ml/hr). The following parameters were measured on all subjects: plasma renin activity and plasma and urinary aldosterone levels (by radioimmunoassay), serum ionic calcium levels (by Nova-2), total serum calcium, and serum and urinary magnesium values (by atomic absorption), serum and urinary sodium and potassium levels (by flame photometry), and creatinine clearance. In the group with low plasma renin activity (group 1), our findings included low serum ionic calcium levels (P less than .001); high coefficients of plasma aldosterone/plasma renin activity and urinary aldosterone/plasma renin activity (P less than .001); a significant correlation between the serum ionic calcium level and plasma renin activity (P less than .001); and an inverse correlation between systolic arterial tension and the serum ionic calcium level (P less than .05). These changes were more similar to change described in hypertensive patients with low plasma renin activity than to the findings in group 2 subjects. We speculate that normotensive subjects with low plasma renin activity present significant changes in the relationship between the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and sodium and calcium levels, and that this group is at risk for hypertension. A diet low in sodium and high in calcium could be an effective preventive measure.\r"

  ".W": "Overwhelming Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP) in patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) carries a poor prognosis. Patients who require mechanical ventilation have up to a 90% mortality rate despite vigorous treatment. Although there are theoretic contraindications to steroid use in severely immunocompromised individuals, case reports of AIDS patients with PCP either inadvertently or intentionally given steroids have shown benefit. We report a series of seven patients whose AIDS and PCP worsened with conventional therapy and who subsequently received high-dose intravenous steroid therapy. All patients required intubation or a high inspired oxygen concentration. Four patients with uncomplicated PCP had a rapid and sustained response to steroids. Three patients with mixed infections (cytomegalovirus, Legionella pneumophila, and Pneumococcus) had transient improvement in gas exchange, though two of these patients subsequently died. Our experience is similar to that of others and suggests that corticosteroids may be of benefit in patients with AIDS and overwhelming PCP. We postulate that pulmonary inflammation is a major determinant of the severity of PCP in AIDS, and that this inflammation may be diminished by high-dose corticosteroid therapy.\r"

Underuse of surgical treatment of epilepsy is reflected by the fact that only about 1% of these candidates are operated on. Candidates for ablative surgery (ie, removal of seizure focus) must have a focus demonstrated by either extracranial or intracranial electrode recordings. Nearly half of the patients who have ablative surgery become seizure-free, and nearly two thirds have no seizures or only rare ones. Candidates for corpus callosotomy are those patients with multiple seizure types and nonfocal EEG abnormalities. Almost half of these patients have at least a 50% reduction in seizure frequency. Patients with infantile hemiplegia and seizures may have marked improvement in seizure control after physiologic hemispherectomy.\r"

These patients differ from those in other reports in that two of the three had no associated arthritic condition that could readily explain synovitis or a condition that predisposed them to bleeding into a joint. Although the accumulated evidence suggests that heterozygous hemoglobinopathies do not produce arthritic syndromes, these reports again raise that question. We cannot conclude, however, that the hemarthroses were definitively caused by the underlying hematologic abnormality. Important when synovial fluid is mixed with blood, since other medical conditions can be diagnosed if abnormal findings are detected.\r"

One of these patients with nausea and occasional vomiting pretreatment had exacerbation several hours after treatment, in spite of droperidol and prochlorperazine prophylaxis. Nausea and vomiting in the other six patients was self-limited and was completely resolved by 12 hours from onset. None of these six patients suffered from nausea and vomiting before treatment. This was directly correlated with the total dose to the vomiting center in the floor of the fourth ventricle (area postrema). The median dose to the vomiting center in the seven patients was 618 cGy (range 275-1257). The final patient in the series received 1088 cGy to the area postrema after droperidol and dexamethasone prophylaxis without developing nausea or vomiting. In the remaining 36 patients who received from less than 5 to 184 cGy to area postrema, nausea and vomiting did not occur. We recommend that patients treated with large fractions of radiation by radiosurgery in this area be premedicated appropriately.\r"

  ".W": "Sixty consecutive patients with untreated acute leukemia alternately received either ABO-matched or ABO-mismatched random-donor platelet transfusions prepared from pooled platelet concentrate stored for 1 to 3 days. Patients were assigned randomly to receive matched or mismatched platelets as their first transfusion, and the first four transfusions were analyzed. In 40 evaluable patients, there was no significant difference (paired t test) between the 10-minute posttransfusion corrected count increments (CCI) of the initial transfusions of matched and mismatched platelets. In contrast, the second matched transfusion was significantly better than the second mismatched transfusion. This effect of ABO compatibility was particularly pronounced in a subset of patients. Six patients in whom mismatched transfusions were consistently inferior to matched transfusions had either a significant increase in anti-A or -B isoagglutinin titers following the first transfusion or elevated titers before or at the conclusion of the study. Conversely, in five patients in whom there was no apparent effect of ABO mismatching, only one had an increase in isoagglutinin titer. Platelet survival was not altered as the ratio of 18-hour to 10-minute posttransfusion CCl was 0.6 for both matched and mismatched platelet transfusions. These data demonstrate that ABO compatibility can affect the results of random-donor platelet transfusions and that patients who experience poor increments from ABO-mismatched platelets may benefit from a trial of ABO-compatible platelets before the initiation of HLA-matched platelet transfusion.\r"

Records were reviewed in 496 adults and 286 children undergoing 1000 consecutive transplants. Twenty-two percent of adults and 14 percent of children had RBC alloantibodies. Antibodies of potential clinical significance were found before transplant in 6.3 percent of adults and 1.0 percent of children; despite immunosuppression, they appeared 1 to 5 weeks after transplant in an additional 7.5 and 5.2 percent respectively. These antibodies probably represented secondary immune responses. Of 58 transplant patients with prior potentially significant antibodies, 8 required 7 to 110 units of antigen-untyped blood after 8 to 28 units of antigen-negative blood; of these patients, one had subsequent hemolysis. Positive direct antiglobulin tests in 24 percent of adults and 10 percent of children were most often thought to be due to nonspecific adsorption of IgG. Anti-recipient ABO antibodies developed in 22 of 60 (37%) evaluable ABO-unmatched grafts; 13 cases had associated hemolysis. In all, 36 percent of adults and 20 percent of children had diverse RBC antibody problems. Resolution of these problems is an important part of the laboratory support necessary for a liver transplantation program.\r"

This study examined the feasibility of using washed apheresis donor platelets stored for up to 1 year in a modified Hank's buffer solution at 4 degrees C as crossmatch reagents in an indirect IgG-enzyme immunoassay. Pooled and monospecific HLA and PlA1 antisera were used to determine the antigenic reactivity of donor platelets in relation to duration of storage. There were no significant differences between mean HLA and PlA1 antigen expression in fresh and stored platelets. HLA reactivity was detected on 12 of 13 donor platelet samples stored for 3 to 9 months and on 14 of 17 platelets stored for 12 to 14 months. PlA1 reactivity was maintained at 12 to 14 months for all 12 donor platelet samples tested. In addition, incompatibility remained in 23 of 24 paired fresh and stored platelet crossmatches using individual alloimmunized patient plasmas. These data indicate that both HLA and platelet-specific PlA1 antigen reactivity can be maintained adequately in liquid storage at 4 degrees C for up to 1 year. The availability of a convenient platelet storage method should facilitate the general application of platelet crossmatching procedures for alloimmunized patients.\r"

In five allogeneic bone marrow transplants, the maximum value of transfused incompatible red cells was 8.8 ml. There was no evidence of a hemolytic transfusion reaction in any patient. The median cell recovery for nucleated marrow cells and progenitor cells was 77 and 104 percent, respectively. Engraftment occurred at a median of 13 days (range, 11-21 days) after transplantation.

We and others have found the guided fine-needle biopsy technique to be safe, relatively cheap, and highly accurate in the diagnosis of liver cancer. Blind percutaneous biopsy should be reserved for patients with possible diffuse, noncancerous, liver disease. Guided biopsies at laparoscopy can be done if the other two methods fail to give a tissue diagnosis. The transvenous approach is useful in patients with a coagulation disorder.\r"

This strategy is summarized with suggestions on therapy in emergency departments, during the transition from hospital to ambulatory care, before exercise, and during pregnancy.\r"

  ".W": "Pancreas transplantation for the treatment of diabetes mellitus is being done with increasing frequency. Refined operative techniques, an improved immunosuppression regimen, and an earlier recognition of rejection have led to dramatic increases in both graft and patient survival rates. Preliminary data suggest that a functioning pancreatic allograft may arrest or reverse most of the complications of diabetes, although the effects on retinopathy remain controversial. Patients also acquire a strong sense of well-being after successful pancreas transplantation.\r"

  ".U": "89284568\r", 
  ".W": "Pertussis is a severe epidemic disease that causes significant morbidity and mortality in unimmunized children. It is now clear, however, that adults with atypical disease account for many of the cases and are often responsible for transmission to susceptible infants. Because of the extent of unrecognized pertussis in the adult population, mass pediatric immunization has been successful in controlling the disease in children but not in reducing the presence of the organism in the United States. Pertussis immunization of children is associated with a high rate of side reactions and is temporally related to severe neurologic disease and death in infants. These events are often considered to be reactions, but available scientific evidence indicates that few, if any, are actually caused by pertussis immunization. Pertussis vaccine reactogenicity in adults is anecdotally considered to be worse than in children, but direct studies do not support that. In the context of current programs emphasizing adult immunization, consideration should be given to booster doses of diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis in adults, using component pertussis vaccines when they become available.\r"

  ".W": "The treatment of dilated cardiomyopathy is palliative and, hence, has little effect on the natural history. Therapy directed toward the cause rather than the effect will be necessary before mortality can be affected. Active myocarditis is postulated to be the cause of dilated cardiomyopathy in a subset of patients. A model of murine coxsackievirus B3 myocarditis has immunopathogenic parallels to the disease in humans and suggests that persistent autoimmune reactivity following viral clearance leads to progressive myocyte damage and dilated cardiomyopathy. In preliminary uncontrolled studies, patients with myocarditis have shown clinical and histologic improvement with the addition of immunosuppressive therapy, but there may also be a significant rate of spontaneous improvement. A multicenter study currently acquiring patients is designed to determine the efficacy of immunosuppression and the natural history of active myocarditis.\r"
