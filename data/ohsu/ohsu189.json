  ".W": "The influence of body weight on the performance in cross-country skiing has been studied by: dimensional analysis of the ratio (R) between the factors of importance to power production (VO2max, acceleration of gravity) and the braking powers, e.g., friction and air resistance; measuring the energy cost of level skiing (N = 6); comparing male world class skiers (N = 5) with less successful ones (N = 34) and female winners of the National Championships (N = 9) with non-winners (N = 9) in regard to the relationship between body weight and VO2max. The dimensional analysis revealed that R was less than unity for rather steep uphills. For level, downhill, and less steep uphill skiing, R was greater than unity. Thus, skiers who are light will be favored in steep uphill slopes, whereas heavier skiers have advantages in the other parts of the track. Energy cost per kilogram for level skiing was inversely related to the transported mass. Per unit of distance, this cost was positively related to velocity. The world class skiers displayed significantly greater VO2max than the less successful ones, regardless of the unit used. The lowest standard deviation among the world class skiers was attained when expressing VO2max as ml X min-1 X kg-2/3. The present results indicate that R will be quite close to unity and therefore the performance capability would theoretically be independent of body mass. Furthermore, VO2max is preferably expressed as ml X min-1 X kg-2/3 for cross-country skiers.\r"

  ".W": "In the literature, drop jumping is advocated as an effective exercise for athletes who prepare themselves for explosive activities. When executing drop jumps, different jumping techniques can be used. In this study, the influence of jumping technique on the biomechanics of jumping is investigated. Ten subjects executed drop jumps from a height of 20 cm and counter-movement jumps. For the execution of the drop jumps, two different techniques were adopted. The first technique, referred to as bounce drop jump, required the subjects to reverse the downward velocity into an upward one as soon as possible after landing. The second technique, referred to as counter-movement drop jump, required them to do this more gradually by making a larger downward movement. During jumping, the subjects were filmed, ground reaction forces were registered, and electromyograms were recorded. The results of a biomechanical analysis show that moments and power output about knee and ankle joints reach larger values during the drop jumps than during counter-movement jumps. The largest values were attained during bounce drop jumps. Based on this finding, it was hypothesized that bounce drop jump is better suited than counter-movement drop jump for athletes who seek to improve the mechanical output of knee extensors and plantar flexors. Researchers are, therefore, advised to control jumping technique when investigating training effects of executing drop jumps.\r"

For the execution of drop jumps, different techniques and different dropping heights can be used. This study was designed to investigate for the performance of bounce drop jumps the influence of dropping height on the biomechanics of the jumps. Six subjects executed bounce drop jumps from heights of 20 cm (designated here as DJ20), 40 cm (designated here as DJ40), and 60 cm (designated here as DJ60). During jumping, they were filmed, and ground reaction forces were recorded. The results of a biomechanical analysis show no difference between DJ20 and DJ40 in mechanical output about the joints during the push-off phase. Peak values of moment and power output about the ankles during the push-off phase were found to be smaller in DJ60 than in DJ40 (DJ20 = DJ60). The amplitude of joint reaction forces increased with dropping height. During DJ60, the net joint reaction forces showed a sharp peak on the instant that the heels came down on the ground. Based on the results, researchers are advised to limit dropping height to 20 or 40 cm when investigating training effects of the execution of bounce drop jumps.\r"

Enkephalins were measured using a radio-receptor assay (Leu-Enk RRA). Subjects ran for 80 min at 40 and 60% VO2max and for 40 min at 80% VO2max. Each session was separated by at least 1 wk. Heart rate, blood pressure, lactic acid, and rectal temperature responses increased in an intensity-dependent manner. Epinephrine increased from resting values of 38.2 +/- 6.8 pg X ml-1, mean +/- SE to 75.0 +/- 13.3 pg X ml-1 during the 40% VO2max run, from 60.2 +/- 15 to 186 +/- 45 pg X ml-1 during the 60% run, and from 33.4 +/- 7.6 to 311 +/- 52 pg X ml-1 at the 40th min of the highest workload (80% VO2max). These increases were significant (P less than 0.05). Plasma Leu-Enk RRA was between 3.8 and 6.2 pmol X ml-1 prior to each run and did not change significantly as a result of exercise. Levels of Leu-Enk RRA also did not change during 30 min of supine recovery. Perception of effort increased (P less than 0.05) with increases in exercise intensity, and effort sense was unrelated to plasma Leu-Enk RRA. Psychological tension decreased significantly (P less than 0.05) following exercise at 60 and 80% of VO2max, but the decrease following the 40% run was not significant (P greater than 0.05). Reduced tension following exercise was not related to Leu-Enk RRA.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Seven exercises were performed in the following order: leg extension, bent-over row, bicep curl, squat, upright row, bench press, and behind-neck press. Each exercise was performed three times with the following work-to-rest timing: 30 s exercise, 30 s rest; 30 s exercise; 30 s rest; and 30 s exercise, 60 s rest (to allow for machine switch-over to the next exercise). Thus, each exercise took a total of 120 s, of which work was for 90 s and rest 120 s. During the circuit, heart rate averaged 153.8 b X min-1 (81.2% of TM max) and VO2 averaged 1.93 l X min-1 (41.4% of TM max). Oxygen uptake for the individual exercises ranged from 1.52 l X min-1 (32.6% of TM max) for the behind-neck-press exercise to 2.43 l X min-1 (52.1% of TM max) for the squat exercise. Heart rate ranged from 135.9 b X min-1 (71.8% of TM max) for the leg extension exercise to 163.4 b X min-1 (86.3% of TM max) for the squat exercise. Hydraulic circuit resistance exercise results in an average caloric expenditure of 40.8 kJ X min-1 (9.75 kcal X min-1).\r"

Subjects were assigned to either a training group (N = 11), who trained 2 to 3 times weekly for 6 wk, or a control group (N = 6). Training progressed from two 15-s and two 30-s \"all-out\" sprints on a cycle ergometer during week 1 to six 15-s and six 30-s bouts per session during week 6. The Wingate test was performed before and after the 6 wk, but performance variables were not changed in either group. In the training group, peak lactate after the Wingate test was significantly higher after training. No significant changes in enzyme activities, myoglobin concentration, or fiber-type frequency were observed in the control group. In contrast, in the training group, the percent fast twitch oxidative fibers increased, myoglobin decreased, and both citrate synthase and phosphofructokinase activities increased (P less than 0.05). The results suggest that muscle myoglobin concentration is not increased by 6 wk of supra-maximal exercise training and that such training induces cellular adaptations without accompanying performance changes. Alternatively, the Wingate test is not a sensitive test of adaptations to the training.\r"

Sixteen women (mean age = 24.7 yrs) were evaluated during progressive LBNP to -50 torr. Each subject's VO2max was determined using indirect calorimetry during the Bruce protocol exercise test. Eight subjects [mean VO2max = 56.8 (ml O2 X min-1) X kg-1] were designated as trained, and eight subjects [mean VO2max = 39.4 (ml O2 X min-1) X kg-1] were designated as untrained. During LBNP, heart rate, blood pressure, cardiac index, forearm blood flow, and leg circumference were measured. All subjects completed the LBNP protocol without clinical symptoms of pre-syncope. The over-all hemodynamic responses of both groups to LBNP were qualitatively similar to previous findings reported for males. However, no significant differences in response of hemodynamic variables were observed between trained and untrained subjects during LBNP to -50 torr (P greater than 0.05) except for vascular resistance and diastolic blood pressure at -50 torr where the untrained value was greater than the trained value. This would suggest that a fitness-related difference may have been present at higher levels of LBNP. Furthermore, in contrast to previous reports in males, the index of baroreflex responsiveness (delta heart rate/delta systolic blood pressure) was similar for both groups (P greater than 0.05). When these data were compared with a similar subject pool of males, the females displayed a significantly greater (P less than 0.05) tolerance of LBNP to -50 torr regardless of fitness.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Seven conscious dogs were studied in the untrained (UT) and partially trained (PT) conditions. The conditioning regime consisted of treadmill running 5 d X wk-1 for 4 to 5 wk. Left circumflex coronary flow, aortic pressure, and heart rate were measured, and DCR and myocardial oxygen consumption were calculated. During sub-maximal exercise, DCR in the UT dogs decreased from a resting value of 4.08 +/- 0.18 mm Hg X ml-1 X min-1 to 1.91 +/- 0.17 mm Hg X ml-1 X min-1 at a workload of 6.4 kph (speed)/16% (grade). During exercise, DCR was significantly greater in UT than in PT dogs. Atenolol significantly increased DCR at all levels of sub-maximal workload in both UT and PT dogs. However, the percent increase in DCR with atenolol was significantly greater in the PT dogs compared to UT dogs. These findings suggest that daily exercise for 4 to 5 wk may decrease beta 2-receptor activity of the coronary vasculature during sub-maximal exercise.\r"

The persistence of alterations in ventricular dimensions in the immediate post-recovery period, however, provides an artifact-free opportunity for evaluating recovery from the inotropic response of exercise stress. To determine the feasibility of this technique for children and to examine typical values in the pre-pubertal population, 20 boys had two-dimensional directed left ventricular M-mode echocardiograms performed before and after maximal treadmill exercise. Acceptable measurements were possible by 2 min of recovery in all subjects. Mean left ventricular shortening fraction at this time was increased 10% from resting values as a result of decreased end-systolic dimension. This study demonstrated the feasibility of post-exercise echocardiography in evaluating recovery left ventricular dimensions, but further examination of specificity, validity, variability, and reproducibility of this technique will be important in assessing its clinical usefulness.\r"

Hence, we studied the effect of exhaustive running on post-exercise changes in muscle glycogen concentration in untrained subjects and compared the effect of tapered running with an exhaustive bout of running in well-trained runners. Six trained runners (T), 6 untrained subjects (UT), and 6 physically active subjects participated. Four hundred grams of carbohydrate were given for 2 d (PX2 and PX1) before exercise and 600 g for 3 d (R1, R2, and R3) with rest afterwards. Before exercise, T and UT were restricted in physical activity. Biopsies were obtained from the gastrocnemius muscle on PX2 and PX1 in T, and before (PX0), immediately after exercise (R0), and on R1, R2, and R3 in all groups. Muscle glycogen increased from 110 (+/-14) on PX2 to 180 (+/-11) mmol X kg-1 on PX0 in T (P less than 0.001). This PX0 value was higher than the PX0 value for UT, which was 102 (+/-8) mmol X kg-1 (P less than 0.005). R0 values were 57 (+/-14) and 26 (+/-4) mmol X kg-1, respectively.

We investigated one of the peroxisomal lipid metabolisms, i.e., plasmalogen metabolism in cultured skin fibroblasts from myotonic dystrophy, and found plasmalogen ratios to be significantly reduced.\r"

At 37 degrees C all investigated parameters were normal. At 27 degrees C the resting potentials decreased to about -40 mV, and the fibers were inexcitable. At this stage the membrane currents were much larger than in normal fibers owing to increases in the membrane conductances for Na and Cl ions. The earlier finding that in the cold the Na permeability is abnormally large was confirmed. The Cl permeability was shown to be normal even in the cold. The decrease of the resting potential and the changes in the current-voltage relationship at 27 degrees C could be prevented by the use of the Na channel blocker tetrodotoxin (TTX) or by bathing the fibers in a Na-free solution. Our previous conclusion that the Cl conductance at 27 degrees C was also increased when TTX was present was not confirmed. Exposure of a muscle bundle to 7 mmol/l potassium did not lead to excessive depolarization and paralysis.\r"

  ".W": "To elucidate the risk factors for anal cancer, we interviewed and obtained blood specimens from 148 persons with anal cancer and from 166 controls with colon cancer in whom these diseases were diagnosed during 1978-1985. We found that in men, a history of receptive anal intercourse (related to homosexual behavior) was strongly associated with the occurrence of anal cancer (relative risk, 33.1; 95 percent confidence interval, 4.0 to 272.1). Anal intercourse was only weakly associated with the risk of anal cancer in women (relative risk, 1.8; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.7 to 4.2). Among the subjects with squamous-cell anal cancer, 47.1 percent of homosexual men, 28.6 percent of heterosexual men, and 28.3 percent of women gave a history of genital warts, as compared with only 1 to 2 percent of controls and no patients with transitional-cell anal cancer. In patients without a history of warts, anal cancer was associated with a history of gonorrhea in heterosexual men (relative risk, 17.2; 95 percent confidence interval, 2.0 to 149.4) and with seropositivity for herpes simplex type 2 (relative risk, 4.1; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.9 to 8.8) and Chlamydia trachomatis (relative risk, 2.3; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.1 to 4.8) in women. Current cigarette smoking was a substantial risk factor in both women (relative risk, 7.7; 95 percent confidence interval, 3.5 to 17.2) and men (relative risk, 9.4; 95 percent confidence interval, 2.3 to 38.5). We conclude that homosexual behavior in men is a risk factor for anal cancer, and that squamous-cell anal cancer is also associated with a history of genital warts, an association suggesting that papillomavirus infection is a cause of anal cancer. Certain other genital infections and cigarette smoking are also associated with anal cancer.\r"

  ".W": "We report the development of a rapid nonradioactive technique for the genetic prediction of human disease and its diagnostic application to hemophilia A. This method is based on enzymatic amplification of short segments of human genes associated with inherited disorders. A novel feature of the procedure is the use of a heat-stable DNA polymerase, which allows the repeated rounds of DNA synthesis to proceed at 63 degrees C. The high sequence specificity of the amplification reaction at this elevated temperature permits restriction-site polymorphisms, contained in the amplified samples, to be analyzed by visual inspection of their digestion products on polyacrylamide gels. By means of this method, we have performed carrier detection and prenatal diagnosis of hemophilia in two families with use of the factor VIII intragenic polymorphisms identified by the restriction enzymes BclI and XbaI. Predictions can be made directly from chorionic villi, without previous DNA extraction, and fetal sex can be determined by amplification of sequences specific for the Y chromosome. Specific amplification of genomic sequences with heat-stable DNA polymerase is applicable to the diagnosis of a wide variety of inherited disorders. These include diseases diagnosed by restriction-site variation, such as Duchenne's muscular dystrophy and sickle cell anemia, those due to a collection of known mutations, such as beta-thalassemia, and those due to gene deletion, such as alpha-thalassemia.\r"

To establish a normal range of values, we used a two-site monoclonal-antibody assay to measure protein C levels in 699 healthy adults. The distribution was log normal; 95 percent of the values ranged from 70 to 140 percent of the overall mean (4.03 micrograms per milliliter). Two subjects had levels more than 3.5 SD below the mean (34 and 50 percent), consistent with heterozygous deficiency. We also screened 4723 other blood donors and found 8 additional unrelated subjects with levels from 33 to 51 percent of normal. Autosomal inheritance of heterozygous protein C deficiency was confirmed in them by a detailed study of four families. Levels from 55 to 65 percent of normal are consistent with either heterozygous deficiency or the lower end of the distribution of normal values, and were found in 79 of 5422 subjects when the two groups were combined. None of the subjects had any history of venous thrombosis. We conclude that heterozygous deficiency of protein C has a prevalence of 1 in 200 to 300, a figure consistent with the known number of homozygous infants recently identified, and that levels consistent with heterozygous deficiency are found in 1 in 60 healthy adults but are not detectably associated with a risk of thrombosis.\r"

  ".W": "In some patients with thrombocytopenia, it is difficult to determine whether the condition is caused by underproduction of platelets (reduced numbers of megakaryocytes) or an increase in the rate of their destruction (normal or increased numbers of megakaryocytes). A non-invasive test to help distinguish between these two categories of thrombocytopenia would be useful. We related the plasma concentration of glycocalicin, a fragment of the platelet-membrane glycoprotein Ib, to the mechanism of thrombocytopenia by evaluating bone marrow megakaryocyte content and measuring platelet life span. Plasma glycocalicin was measured with a monoclonal antibody to the glycocalicin component of platelet glycoprotein Ib. The mean (+/- SD) plasma concentration of glycocalicin in 34 healthy controls was 87 +/- 20 percent of the level in pooled normal plasma (range, 52 to 127 percent). All of eight patients with aplastic anemia or amegakaryocytic thrombocytopenia confirmed by examining bone marrow (in all patients) and by determining the life span of autologous platelets (in six patients) had glycocalicin levels significantly below the normal range (5 to 27 percent). In contrast, each of 25 patients with thrombocytopenia thought to be caused by a reduction in platelet life span, whose bone marrow contained normal or increased numbers of megakaryocytes, had glycocalicin levels that fell within or above the normal range (48 to 261 percent). There was no overlap of values between the two patient populations. These studies indicate that the measurement of plasma glycocalicin may be a useful adjunct in classifying thrombocytopenic disorders.\r"

During cardiac catheterization, 28 episodes of arteriographically confirmed coronary reopening and subsequent reocclusion were observed in 16 patients before (3 episodes) and during (25 episodes) continuous intracoronary infusion of streptokinase. In addition, ST-segment monitoring demonstrated 12 episodes of spontaneous transient return of the ST segment to the base line in eight patients between the time of admission and the performance of coronary arteriography. During arteriographically documented reocclusion, intracoronary isosorbide dinitrate (2 mg) reestablished the patency of the coronary artery within one to two minutes in 14 of 28 episodes that occurred in 11 of 16 patients. After streptokinase infusion, intracoronary administration of isosorbide dinitrate was followed by dilatation of the infarct-related stenosis from a mean value (+/- SD) of 1.12 +/- 0.3 mm (58.1 +/- 12.1 percent) to 1.33 +/- 0.4 mm (51.6 +/- 12.9 percent; P = 0.004). Spontaneous intermittent coronary recanalization and reocclusion resulting from a variable combination of thrombosis and vasoconstriction are frequent during the early phase of acute myocardial infarction. We propose that the combination of intracoronary streptokinase and isosorbide dinitrate may increase the rate of stable coronary recanalization.\r"

In the pilot study, involving 274 Nepalese, there were no significant side effects of the Vi vaccine; about 75 percent responded with a rise in serum antibodies of fourfold or more. In the clinical trial, residents of five villages were given intramuscular injections of either Vi or, as a control, pneumococcus vaccine dispensed in coded, randomly arranged, single-dose syringes. There were 6907 participants, of whom 6438 were members of the target population (5 to 44 years of age); each was visited every two days. Those with temperatures of 37.8 degrees C or higher for three consecutive days were examined and asked to give blood for culture. Typhoid was diagnosed as either blood culture-positive or clinically suspected on the basis of bradycardia, splenomegaly, and fever, with a negative blood culture. Seventeen months after vaccination, the codes were broken for the 71 patients meeting the criteria for either culture-positive or clinically suspected typhoid. The attack rate of typhoid was 16.2 per 1000 among the controls and 4.1 per 1000 among those immunized with Vi (P less than 0.00001). The efficacy of Vi was 72 percent in the culture-positive cases, 80 percent in the clinically suspected cases, and 75 percent in the two groups combined. These data provide evidence that Vi antibodies confer protection against typhoid. Surveillance continues to determine the duration of Vi-induced immunity.\r"

Our patients, 17 to 74 years of age, were all immunocompromised either from their primary disease or from chemotherapy, and the Hickman catheters had been placed to provide venous access for chemotherapy or hyperalimentation or both. Clinical signs of infection included erythema, induration, and cutaneous or subcutaneous necrosis at the point of entry into the subclavian vein, in the subcutaneous tunnel, or at the exit site from the skin. Diagnosis was confirmed by positive wound culture for Aspergillus flavus in all but one patient. Treatment consisted of intravenous amphotericin B, oral flucytosine, and local wound care. Three patients recovered completely without operative debridement; three others recovered after operative debridement and delayed grafting. Two patients died of disseminated aspergillosis, and one died of unrelated causes while recovering from primary cutaneous aspergillosis. Successful treatment required resolution of aplasia or leukopenia, catheter removal, systemic treatment with amphotericin B, and local wound care. We conclude that primary cutaneous aspergillosis, a rare infection, may occur at the sites of Hickman catheters in immunocompromised patients, and that it is a serious complication requiring prompt diagnosis and treatment.\r"

We therefore looked for loss of 3p alleles in tumor tissue from 42 patients with either small-cell or non-small-cell lung carcinoma. All 13 patients with small-cell lung carcinoma who were heterozygous for one or more alleles at 3p in normal tissue had the loss of at least one codominant allele in the tumor tissue. Cell lines of small-cell lung carcinoma from an additional eight patients were homozygous for 3p alleles; this result was significantly different from the predicted frequency of homozygosity. The tumor tissue studied included cell lines of small-cell lung carcinoma obtained from biopsy specimens, an autopsy sample, and an excised lymph node containing tumor cells. Loss of alleles at 3p was observed in tumor samples obtained before and after chemotherapy. Four of 15 evaluable patients with non-small-cell carcinoma of the lung had loss of 3p alleles. We conclude that loss of alleles at 3p is a change found consistently in small-cell lung carcinoma and occasionally in non-small-cell lung carcinoma.\r"

  ".W": "The well-known increased risk of the respiratory distress syndrome in a twin born second as compared with the twin born first is usually attributed to the second twin's predisposition to depression at birth (\"asphyxia\"). We analyzed the etiologic roles of birth order, presentation, and depression at birth in the development of the respiratory distress syndrome in matched case-control populations drawn from 221 preterm twin pairs. Among the 39 twin pairs discordant for respiratory distress syndrome, the second twin was the affected member in 31 pairs. Second birth order was the only independent risk factor, but only in vaginal deliveries (matched odds ratio, 14.2; 95 percent confidence interval, 2.5 to 81.1). Second twins delivered abdominally did not have an increased risk relative to first twins (odds ratio, 0.9; confidence interval, 0 to 17.8). When depression at birth was evaluated as an outcome variable, malpresentation, rather than birth order, was the major risk factor (independent matched odds ratios of 2.7 [confidence interval, 1.0 to 7.5] and 1.3 [0.7 to 2.5], respectively). Thus, second twins' increased risk of respiratory distress syndrome cannot be explained by a predisposition to depression at birth; a more important factor may be that second twins do not benefit from the salutary effects of labor to the same extent as first twins.\r"

Information obtained at routine biennial examinations about the use of estrogens, body weight, age at menopause, smoking, and alcohol consumption was used to evaluate the risk of hip fracture among postmenopausal women who received estrogens. Hip fractures occurred in 179 postmenopausal women, at a rate that increased exponentially after the age of 50. The risk of fracture was inversely related to weight at all ages. The relative risk of hip fracture in subjects who had taken estrogens at any time was 0.65 after adjustment for age and weight (95 percent confidence interval, 0.44 to 0.98). The adjusted relative risk in women who had taken estrogens within the previous two years was further reduced, to 0.34 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.12 to 0.98). Taking estrogens within four years of menopause also protected against fracture. The number of women in each age group who took estrogens was insufficient for a definitive evaluation of risk, but recent use of estrogens appeared to be protective in women under the age of 65 (no fractures among those who took estrogens) and those 65 to 74. We cannot exclude some degree of selection bias among the women who received estrogen-replacement therapy. Nevertheless, this large cohort study supports the hypothesis that postmenopausal use of estrogens protects against subsequent hip fracture in women.\r"

The incidence rate of headache after aspartame (35 percent) was not significantly different from that after placebo (45 percent) (P less than 0.50). No serious reactions were observed, and the incidence of symptoms other than headache following aspartame was also equivalent to that after placebo. No treatment-related effects were detected in vital signs, blood pressure, or plasma concentrations of cortisol, insulin, glucagon, histamine, epinephrine, or norepinephrine. Most of the subjects were well educated and overweight and had a family or personal history of allergic reactions. The subjects who had headaches had lower plasma concentrations of norepinephrine (P less than 0.0002) and epinephrine (P less than 0.02) just before the development of headache. We conclude that in this population, aspartame is no more likely to produce headache than placebo.\r"

  ".W": "One of the most common karyotypic abnormalities is the t(14;18) translocation, which is found in many lymphomas that have a characteristic follicular morphology. Recent molecular studies have shown that this chromosomal translocation results in the juxtaposition of the candidate proto-oncogene bcl-2 (B-cell leukemia-lymphoma) on chromosome 18 with the immunoglobulin heavy-chain locus on chromosome 14. However, because performing accurate cytogenetic studies in solid hematolymphoid neoplasms is difficult, knowledge of the prevalence of the t(14;18) translocation and, by association, the extent of bcl-2 involvement in human lymphomas is limited. We used a number of chromosome-18 DNA probes to analyze various subtypes of Hodgkin's and non-Hodgkin's lymphomas and test for structural abnormalities near or within the bcl-2 gene. Molecular features of the t(14;18) translocation were found in virtually all follicular neoplasms and about 28 percent of diffuse large-cell lymphomas. No changes in bcl-2 were found in several other subtypes of Hodgkin's and non-Hodgkin's lymphomas, including those previously suggested to originate from follicular-center cells and those about which cytogenetic data have been difficult to obtain. Our findings suggest a close pathogenetic relation between bcl-2 and a large group of non-Hodgkin's lymphomas, both with and without a follicular morphology. The methods employed in this study may be useful in improving the accuracy of diagnosis and subclassification of malignant lymphomas.\r"

  ".W": "Neurons in the visual cortex typically respond selectively to the orientation, and velocity and direction of movement, of moving-bar stimuli. These responses are generally thought to provide information about the orientation and position of lines and edges in the visual field. Some cells are also endstopped, that is selective for bars of specific lengths. Hubel and Wiesel first observed that endstopped hypercomplex cells could respond to curved stimuli and suggested they might be involved in detection of curvature, but the exact relationship between endstopping and curvature has never been determined. We present here a mathematical model relating endstopping to curvature in which the difference in response of two simple cells gives rise to endstopping and varies in proportion to curvature. We also provide physiological evidence that endstopped cells in area 17 of the cat visual cortex are selective for curvature, whereas non-endstopped cells are not, and that some are selective for the sign of curvature. The prevailing view of edge and curve determination is that orientations are selected locally by the class of simple cortical cells and then integrated to form global curves. We have developed a computational theory of orientation selection which shows that measurements of orientation obtained by simple cells are not sufficient because there will be strong, incorrect responses from cells whose receptive fields (RFs) span distinct curves (Fig. 1). If estimates of curvature are available, however, these inappropriate responses can be eliminated. Curvature provides the key to structuring the network that underlies our theory and distinguishes it from previous lateral inhibition schemes.\r"

This hypothesis is supported by demonstration of allele loss specific for these regions using polymorphic DNA markers and by the isolation of a complementary DNA clone for the retinoblastoma gene. A cytogenetic deletion in chromosome 3 (p14-p23) was reported in small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) by Whang-Peng et al. At least one homologue of chromosome 3 was affected in the majority of SCLC tumours; however, the multiple chromosomal changes seen presented the possibility that chromosome 3 was rearranged, not deleted. We used polymorphic DNA probes for chromosome 3p and compared tumour and constitutional genotypes of nine SCLC patients. Our data show loss of alleles of chromosome 3p markers in tumour DNA of all nine patients supporting the hypothesis that this region contributes to tumorigenesis in SCLC.\r"

  ".U": "88014183\r", 
  ".W": "Rhodes and Klug have recently proposed that the internal control region of the Xenopus 5S RNA gene adopts an A-type DNA structure in solution. This suggestion was based on a Fourier analysis of both the spacing of DNase I cutting sites and on the distribution of G residues in the DNA sequence. Both revealed a approximately 5.6-5.7-base periodicity which the authors interpreted as a structural repeat every half helical turn of A-type DNA. This contention was strengthened by the finding that a 9-base-pair (bp) double-stranded deoxyoligonucleotide corresponding to residues +81 to +89 of the 5S gene exhibits an A' RNA-like crystal structure. This region of DNA is of special interest as it forms the binding site for the 5S gene-specific transcription factor IIIA (TFIIIA). TFIIIA is a Zn2+-binding protein which interacts with both the internal control region of the gene and the 5S transcript. As base-paired regions of RNA are of the A type, it was reasonable to postulate that 5S DNA might also adopt this conformation. We report here that the circular dichroism (CD) spectrum of a synthetic 54-bp deoxyoligonucleotide corresponding to the TFIIIA binding site is similar to the CD spectrum of B-form DNA in solution. Further, DNA-TFIIIA complexes show an unaltered DNA CD component indicating no gross alteration in DNA structure on protein binding.\r"

  ".W": "A new member (theta 1, or psi alpha) of the alpha-globin gene family has recently been identified in a number of species. In higher primates the theta 1 gene has all the structural features apparently necessary for expression, and it appears to have long been under strong selective constraints which suggests that it could still be, or recently have been, a functional gene. No corresponding 'globin' has yet been identified, however. In some other species, galago and rabbit for example, the theta 1 and psi alpha genes have accumulated enough inactivating mutations for them to be considered genuine pseudogenes. Horses also have an alpha-like gene (psi alpha), in a 3' position identical to the other species in relation to the functional alpha genes, and this also appears to have the elements required for a functional gene. The predicted amino-acid sequence, however, suggests that any 'globin' product is likely to be non-viable because it has a number of seriously deleterious amino-acid replacements. Some of these amino-acid changes are shared with the rabbit and primate sequences, indicating that they predate the mammalian radiation, and that if indeed any of these genes are still functional, they are unlikely to be making haemoglobin.\r"

  ".W": "The OPCS report on cancer incidence and mortality in the vicinity of nuclear installations in England and Wales provides a mass of information that is so large that it should be possible to detect quite small changes in disease levels with considerable confidence. The data on cancer mortality are less subject to selective bias than the registration data on which incidence rates are based, and they provide the firmest grounds on which evidence of any effect can be obtained. These data show conclusively that there has been no general increase in cancer mortality in the vicinity of nuclear installations in a 22-year period beginning several years after the opening of the installations that have released the largest amounts of radionuclides to the environment. On the contrary, the mortality from cancer has tended to be lower in the LAAs in the vicinity of nuclear installations than in control LAAs selected for their presumed comparability with the former. This is unlikely to be due to a protective effect of ionizing radiation and suggests that, despite the efforts that were made to choose comparable control areas, there were non-installation differences between the populations relevant to the risk of dying from one or other type of cancer. Detailed examination of the few types of cancer that were relatively more common in the installation areas suggest that several of the differences were most likely to be due to chance, diagnostic artefacts or social factors rather than to any hazard specifically related to the installations. One disease provides a possible exception: namely, leukaemia in the age group 0-24 years. Two other diseases need further investigation, multiple myeloma and Hodgkin's disease in the older age group 25-74 years. The excess mortality rates recorded from these cancers were not large, and it has yet to be established that they are not due to general confounding by other environmental or socio-economic factors.\r"

Although estimates of prevalence vary, up to 10-15% of school-age children have severe reading deficits in spite of average intelligence and adequate educational opportunity. That reading disability may have a constitutional basis has long been recognized, and results of twin and family studies suggest that one or more of its forms may be heritable; however, definitive evidence for a genetic aetiology has not been reported. Establishing a heritable basis for reading disability could suggest possible causes, give improved risk estimates, facilitate early diagnosis, and provide validity tests for ostensible subtypes. In this report, we apply a recently developed multiple regression analysis to data collected from a sample of 64 pairs of identical twins and 55 pairs of fraternal twins, in which at least one member of the pairs is reading disabled, and present evidence for a significant genetic aetiology.\r"

We have examined the T-cell determinants of the antigen and find that HBcAg-specific helper T cells (TH) can help B cells produce antibody against envelope (HBsAg) antigens as well as HBcAg, even though these antigens are found on separate molecules. We have also been able to prime helper T cells with synthetic T-cell epitopes of HBcAg; helper cells primed with a single synthetic epitope can induce B cells to produce antibody that reacts with multiple HBsAg epitopes. One problem with the development of an HBV vaccine is that some vaccinees and patients do not respond to HBsAg directly; our results indicate that this problem can be circumvented using the response to HBcAg.\r"

  ".U": "88014212\r", 
  ".W": "A new gene like the alpha-globin gene has been identified in higher primates at the 3' end of the alpha-globin gene cluster. There is some controversy as to whether this gene, theta, is a functional globin gene or a non-functional pseudogene. The high degree of sequence conservation displayed by theta between primates and various mammals, such as horse and rabbit, suggests that this gene is functional in some species. Furthermore, theta encodes a 141-amino-acid polypeptide in sequence similar to alpha-globin and appears to possess functional RNA-processing signals. But the promoter region of theta is unlike the other globin genes because its CCAAT and ATA box sequences are displaced from the coding sequence by the insertion of a 200-base-pair GC-rich sequence. We demonstrate here the presence of theta-globin messenger RNA in human fetal erythroid tissue, but not in adult erythroid or other non-erythroid tissues. Furthermore, theta-globin mRNA is detectable in significant amounts in a human erythroleukaemic cell line. These results predict that theta-globin protein will be found in the early stages of human fetal development. Surprisingly, the promoter sequence of theta-globin does not correspond to the CCAAT and ATA box sequences of the gene but rather lies within the adjacent GC-rich sequence, resulting in a heterogeneous series of mRNA 5' ends 50-10 base pairs to 5' of the initiation codon. This type of promoter is reminiscent of that found in housekeeping genes such as adenine deaminase and hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyl-transferase.\r"

The DMD locus has a high mutation frequency: one third of the cases is thought to result from a new mutation. Linkage studies using probes to detect restriction fragment length polymorphisms and DNA deletion studies have greatly improved DMD carrier detection and prenatal diagnosis. Here we report on two families in which a pERT87 (DXS164) deletion was transmitted to more than one offspring by women who showed no evidence for the mutation in their own somatic (white blood) cells. We also show that the deletion in both siblings in one of the families is identical, indicating that the deletion must have occurred during mitosis in early germline proliferation, leading to a germline mosaicism. This phenomenon may turn out to be a major factor contributing to the induction of DMD mutations, and has important implications for the counselling of DMD families.\r"

  ".W": "A gene of unknown function located in band Xp21 on the short arm of the human X chromosome gives rise to X-linked recessive muscular dystrophy, of either Duchenne or Becker type, when mutated. The gene encodes a large muscle-specific transcript of about 14 kilobases (kb) and its genomic size extends over more than 1,800 kb. The high mutation rate (about 10(-4) per generation) is likely to result from the large target size. Submicroscopic deletions, detectable with one or more of the dozen cloned DNA probes available for regions within the gene, constitute a significant proportion of the mutations. Because no such deletions have been found in normal individuals, it is assumed that intragenic deletions are the molecular basis of the mutations. The origin of deletions can be traced in families. With sufficient data collected, it will soon be possible to answer questions about the relative frequencies of mutations in male and female gametogenesis and about the timing of mutational events in mitotic or meiotic stages of germ cell development. We have studied a four generation family containing males who have Duchenne muscular dystrophy due to deletion of the sequence recognized by intragenic probe J-Bir. The deletion was present in two of five daughters of a woman who herself did not have the deletion. Haplotype analysis on 15 members of this family using nine informative restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) markers indicated that the J-Bir deletion chromosome was transmitted from the unaffected father.\r"

Hydrogen bonds, acting primarily through backbone peptide units, are mainly responsible for the involvement of the positively charged arginine 151 residue in the ligand site of the arabinose-binding protein, for the association between teh sulphate-binding protein and the completely buried sulphate dianion, and for the formation of the complex of the leucine/isoleucine/valine-binding protein with the leucine zwitterion. We propose a general mechanism in which the isolated charges on the various buried, desolvated ionic groups are stabilized by the polarized peptide units. This mechanism also has broad application to processes requiring binding of uncompensated ions and charged ligands and stabilization of enzyme reaction charged intermediates, as well as activation of catalytic residues.\r"

We show here that tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), a secretory product of activated macrophages that is believed to mediate tumour cytotoxicity, is a potent inducer of new blood vessel growth (angiogenesis). In vivo, TNF-alpha induces capillary blood vessel formation in the rat cornea and the developing chick chorioallantoic membrane at very low doses. In vitro, TNF-alpha stimulates chemotaxis of bovine adrenal capillary endothelial cells and induces cultures of these cells grown on type-1 collagen gels to form capillary-tube-like structures. The angiogenic activity produced by activated murine peritoneal macrophages is completely neutralized by a polyclonal antibody to TNF-alpha, suggesting immunological features are common to TNF-alpha and the protein responsible for macrophage-derived angiogenic activity. In inflammation and wound repair, TNF-alpha could augment repair by stimulating new blood vessel growth; in tumours, TNF-alpha might both stimulate tumour development by promoting vessel growth and participate in tumour destruction by direct cytotoxicity.\r"

We have determined the position of the ATPase site of myosin using three-dimensional image reconstruction from electron micrographs and site-specific labelling with the avidin-biotin system. The ATPase site is about 5 nm from the tip of the myosin head and is about 4 nm away from the actin-binding site of myosin.

The biochemical basis for both diseases is unknown and no effective treatment is available. Long-range physical mapping has shown that the DMD gene, localized in Xp21, is extremely large, exceeding 2 million base pairs. Until now, carrier detection and prenatal diagnosis has involved the use of linked restriction fragment length polymorphism markers which detect muscular dystrophy-associated deletions in about 10% of the cases. Field inversion gel electrophoresis (FIGE) allows the detection of structural rearrangements in 21 out of 39 of the DMD patients studied (54%), of which 14 (65%) were not detected by conventional methods. Large deletions seem to make up a much higher fraction of the DMD mutations than so far indicated by other methods. A region prone to deletion was located in the distal half of the gene. FIGE analysis could provide a valuable extension of information for carrier detection and prenatal diagnosis. The technique should be generally applicable to the study of diseases involving structural chromosomal rearrangements.\r"

Previous results indicate that complete inactivation of the RB gene is required for tumour formation. As a 'cancer suppressor' gene, RB thus functions in a manner opposite to that of most other oncogenes. Sequence analysis of RB complementary DNA clones demonstrated a long open reading frame encoding a hypothetical protein with features suggestive of a DNA-binding function. To further substantiate and identify the RB protein, we have prepared rabbit antisera against a trypE-RB fusion protein. The purified anti-RB IgG immunoprecipitates a protein doublet with apparent relative molecular mass (Mr) of 110,000-114,000. The specific protein(s) are present in all cell lines expressing normal RB mRNA, but are not detected in five retinoblastoma cell lines examined. The RB protein can be metabolically labelled with 32P-phosphoric acid, indicating that it is a phosphoprotein. Biochemical fractionation and immunofluorescence studies demonstrate that the majority of the protein is located within the nucleus. Furthermore, the protein can be retained by and eluted from DNA-cellulose columns, suggesting that it is associated with DNA binding activity. Taken together, these results imply that the RB gene product may function in regulating other genes within the cell.\r"

A third description of somatic chromosomal interchanges at mitosis is also required. Because mitotic exchanges occur in a single postembryonic somatic progenitor cell, lethal effects on the organism are reduced.

  ".W": "Protein kinase C is important in the transduction of signals generated at the plasma membrane. The physiological activators of protein kinase C are diacylglycerols, and the tumour-promoting phorbol esters, such as 12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-14 acetate (TPA), constitute another group of specific activators. Many cellular substrates for phosphorylation by protein kinase C have been described, but proteins that directly control transcription in response to protein kinase C activation are yet to be identified. TPA treatment leads to induction of various proto-oncogenes, growth factor genes, and genes encoding secreted proteases. In addition. TPA increases the activity of viral enhancer elements. To identify trans-acting factors that mediate the transcriptional response to TPA we chose the simian virus 40 (SV40) enhancer as a model, because it is known to be composed of several discrete cis-acting elements which are recognized by multiple transacting factors. We report here that the SV40 enhancer contains at least four different TPA responsive elements whose activity is dependent on cell-type. The induction response is likely to involve at least two distinct post-translational steps which modulate the activity of the proteins that recognize these elements.\r"

  ".W": "Mounting evidence suggests that chronic cerebral vasospasm may be linked to the inflammatory response that follows subarachnoid hemorrhage. Twenty-one patients judged to be at high risk for vasospasm because of either poor admitting grade or a large amount of subarachnoid blood shown by computed tomography were treated with a course of high dose methylprednisolone, and management results were compared to those of a cohort of contemporary control patients matched for grade, number of hemorrhages, time from hemorrhage to admission, time from hemorrhage to operation, aneurysm location, age, and sex. Patients treated with high dose methylprednisolone were twice as likely to have an excellent result and half as likely to die as those who were not treated. The incidence and severity of delayed cerebral ischemia were reduced in treated patients when compared to control patients. None of the treated patients developed a serious side effect that could be attributed to steroid treatment. These findings are consistent with the conclusion that chronic vasospasm is an inflammatory vasculopathy and suggest that early treatment with high dose methylprednisolone may benefit this high risk group of patients.\r"

  ".W": "We inserted stainless steel cannulae to compare vascular responses to five kinds of barbiturates and to investigate the mechanism of vascular responsiveness to thiopental in isolated and perfused canine basilar arteries. Intraluminal thiopental (10 to 3000 micrograms) usually caused a distinctly biphasic vascular response, i.e., initial vasoconstriction followed by vasodilatation. The vasoconstriction was always greater than the vasodilatation in percentage of change. Thiamylal (10 to 3000 micrograms) evoked similar vascular responses. Pentobarbital, phenobarbital, and amobarbital (100 to 3000 micrograms) induced slight monophasic vasodilatation in lower doses and a weak biphasic response in higher doses. Pretreatment with phentolamine and ketanserin, an alpha-adrenoceptor antagonist and a 5-hydroxytryptamine2 inhibitor, did not alter vasoconstriction to thiopental. Increasing doses of pretreatment with diltiazem, a potent calcium antagonist, depressed the vasoconstriction induced by potassium chloride in a dose-related manner, but thiopental-induced constriction was only slightly suppressed by diltiazem treatment. Endothelial removal produced by intraluminal saponin treatment significantly enhanced vasoconstriction to potassium chloride, but thiopental-induced constriction was not enhanced significantly after saponin treatment. These findings suggest that thiopental-induced vasoconstriction does not involve adrenergic and serotonergic mechanisms and is due to intracellular movement of calcium ions in canine basilar arteries.\r"

The angiographic results were compared to the CT images and to the gross and microscopic endarterectomy pathological specimens, when available. Examples of the various types of abnormalities that can be visualized using CT scans are presented. The CT scan was useful for determining the presence of degenerative atheromatous changes including carotid artery calcification, subintimal hemorrhage, carotid occlusion, carotid segmental occlusion, and carotid pseudoocclusion, as well as carotid artery dissection. The scans were particularly useful for identification of atheromatous carotid artery disease when the carotid angiogram appeared nearly normal and for identifying the cause of postoperative carotid stenosis. CT scanning allows visualization of the carotid artery wall and lumen rather than just the lumen and, consequently, can sometimes add helpful information about the pathological processes affecting this artery.\r"

  ".W": "Using the bilateral carotid artery occlusion model of cerebral ischemia in the gerbil, we studied the effect of moderate hypothermia (30 to 31 degrees C) on the postischemic production of prostanoids (cyclooxygenase pathway) and leukotrienes (lipoxygenase pathway) and accompanying changes in cerebral edema formation. Hypothermia capable of slowing central evoked potential conduction time was studied over the course of 40 minutes of cerebral ischemia and for up to 2 hours of reperfusion. The successful induction of cerebral ischemia was confirmed by somatosensory evoked potential amplitude changes. Measurements of 6-ketoprostaglandin F1 alpha (PGF1 alpha) and leukotriene B4 (LTB4) (radioimmunoassay) and cerebral edema (specific gravity) were made at early (10 minutes) and late (2 hours) reperfusion times. Although both white and gray matter showed no early significant difference in edema accumulation between normothermic and hypothermic gerbils at 10 minutes of reperfusion, hypothermic animals demonstrated significantly less white matter edema (specific gravity, 1.0397 +/- 0.0010 vs. 1.0341 +/- 0.0012, P less than 0.01) and gray matter edema (specific gravity, 1.0408 +/- 0.0009 vs. 1.0365 +/- 0.0008, P less than 0.01) by 2 hours of reperfusion. Production of PGF1 alpha was not significantly different between normothermic and hypothermic animals during the reperfusion period; however, hypothermic gerbils demonstrated significantly lower production of LTB4 at 10 minutes reperfusion time compared to normothermic animals (1.49 +/- 0.79 vs. 5.28 +/- 1.49 pg/mg of protein, P less than 0.05). This difference between the two groups in LTB4 levels was no longer detectable at 2 hours of reperfusion time.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The infusion of isoosmolar glycerol (0.35 mol/dm-3) into the ventricles of laboratory rats for 120 minutes led to an increase in the serum osmolality by 11 mosm/kg and to hypernatremia. The brain water content of the cerebral hemispheres decreased by 0.9% (P less than 0.05). A corresponding intraventricular infusion of saline or d-glucose did not cause significant changes in these parameters. These findings support the view that glycerol, even in a dose incapable of creating a major osmotic gradient between plasma and brain, could have a beneficial effect in the control of intracranial volume-pressure perturbations. It is hypothesized that, besides acting as an osmotic dehydrating agent in certain concentrations, glycerol influences the central neuroendocrine system responsible for brain ion and volume homeostasis. By its presumed reduction of central and peripheral vasopressin release through lowering the cerebrospinal fluid sodium concentration, it may help in decreasing the brain water content.\r"

Fifty-three pulmonary complications were noted in 44 (35.7%) patients. The most common problems were atelectasis and pneumonia. There were 22 (18%) deaths. Fourteen deaths were related to pulmonary complications. The mean age of patients who died was 52 +/- 13 (SE) compared to 28 +/- 12 for survivors. A mean forced vital capacity (FVC) of 1127 +/- 410 cc in patients suffering respiratory difficulties compared to a FVC of 1865 +/- 85 cc in patients without complications (P less than 0.001). Oxygenation (PaO2 90 +/- 19 torr) was normal in patients without respiratory problems and was abnormal in patients developing problems (PaO2 76 +/- 30 torr; P less than 0.05). Twenty patients were treated with a rotating bed. The complication rate of patients on the bed was only 10%. In conclusion, respiratory problems remain a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in spinal cord injury. The forced vital capacity, blood oxygen tension, and age are predictors of pulmonary complications. The use of a multidisciplinary approach and a rotating bed may minimize these problems.\r"

The median age was 50 years and the median preoperative Karnofsky rate was 80. Twenty-one patients (68%) had glioblastoma multiforme, and 10 patients (32%) had anaplastic astrocytoma. Early postoperative enhanced computed tomography was used to determine the extent of tumor resection. Gross total tumor resection was accomplished in 19 patients (61%), and subtotal resection was performed in 12 patients (39%). The two groups were comparable regarding age, sex, pathological condition, preoperative Karnofsky rating, tumor location, postoperative radiation therapy, and postoperative chemotherapy (P greater than 0.05). The gross total resection group lived longer than the subtotal resection group by life table analysis (P less than 0.001; median survival of 90 and 43 weeks, respectively). Postoperatively, the mean functional ability measured by the Karnofsky rating was significantly increased in the gross total resection group (P = 0.006), but not in the subtotal resection group (P greater than 0.05). The difference in degree of change between preoperative and postoperative Karnofsky rating in the two groups was statistically significant (P = 0.002). The gross total resection group spent significantly more time after the operation in an independent status (Karnofsky rating greater than or equal to 80) compared to the subtotal resection group (P = 0.007; median time of 185 and 12.5 weeks, respectively). Gross total resection of supratentorial glioblastomas and anaplastic astrocytomas is feasible and is directly associated with longer and better survival when compared to subtotal resection.\r"

Oral glycerol was given before i.v. VM-26. Twelve patients responded (46% of all patients and 63% of the fully evaluable patients). The response rate for gliomas was 50% if all patients were considered and 71% if only fully evaluable patients were considered. The response rate did not seem to be affected by glioma grade, prior chemotherapy, or pretreatment performance status. Median time to tumor progression for responders was 19 weeks. Median survival from initiation of treatment was 21 weeks for evaluable patients and 17 weeks for all patients. Median survival from initial diagnosis was 55 weeks. Myelosuppression was dose-limiting for the systemic chemotherapy. Reversible neurological toxicity was common, but tolerable. One patient developed ipsilateral blindness, and two patients developed prolonged neurological toxicity. Pulmonary toxicity was also seen. Vertebral artery infusions proved feasible, although difficult and more toxic than carotid infusions. Overall, this regimen was not more active than the intraarterial combination of BCNU, VM-26, and cisplatin without the systemic chemotherapy. Further studies of more intensive intracarotid therapy combined with different systemic drugs are being initiated.\r"

Microfascicular ligation was performed immediately after section of the sciatic nerve or 10 days later. The results were compared to those of control groups treated with simple nerve section or simple neuroma resection 10 days after nerve section.

Pituitary adenomas were confirmed in 93 patients, and initial remission was achieved in 86 (92%) of them. Hypercortisolemia was not corrected in 7 patients, and in 4 this was due to invasive adenomas. These patients were subjected to irradiation, medical treatment, or both after operation. Only 7 of the 100 patients had no pituitary adenoma found at operation, and they obtained no clinical remission even after partial or subtotal hypophysectomy. Follow-up review, with an emphasis on endocrinological studies, was performed on these patients for a mean period of 38 months. Seventy-eight patients were in long term remission after operation and had restoration of noncorticotropic hormone secretion as well as pituitary-adrenal function. Recurrence was noted in 8 patients after 19 to 82 months in remission. In all of these patients, pituitary adenomas were verified by reoperation and no case of corticotrophic cell hyperplasia was noted. We conclude that late recurrence of Cushing's disease may occur after adenoma removal and is due to the regrowth of adenoma cells left behind in the peritumoral tissue at the first operation. In view of the overall remission rate, transsphenoidal adenomectomy is considered a highly effective treatment for Cushing's disease.\r"

However, the source of ACTH seemed to be autonomous as she demonstrated abnormal feedback control, with lack of response to metyrapone and high coses of dexamethasone. A search for an ectopic ACTH-secreting nonpituitary neoplasm was unsuccessful. Transsphenoidal pituitary exploration revealed a normal pituitary gland, but an ectopic pituitary adenoma was found incidentally in the mucosa of the sphenoid sinus. This adenoma stained strongly positive for ACTH on immunocytochemical studies. Resection of this lesion led to remission of the Cushing's syndrome. This variant of ACTH-dependent Cushing's syndrome can mimic the ectopic ACTH-dependent type and should be looked for in patients who fail to respond to pituitary operation.\r"

Fifty-nine infarcts and eight hemorrhages had sequential scanning. MRI is more sensitive than CT in the early detection of cerebral infarcts. CT is the method of choice to rule out intracerebral bleeding, but MRI is more specific in later stages of hemorrhage. Periventricular hyperintensity is seen more frequently with diabetes than without. Hyperintense white matter patches are often unrelated to clinical events. MRI is useful in following the evolution of strokes and distinguishing acute and chronic infarcts without contrast agents.\r"

This study examines and compares the relative utility of the initial neurologic examination and early CT in predicting cerebral ischemia after SAH. The influence of antifibrinolytic drugs (AFD) in the development of cerebral ischemia was also studied. AFD increased the risk of cerebral ischemia regardless of the admitting neurologic condition or the findings of CT. Among patients given AFD, impaired orientation or alertness was associated with a higher risk of ischemia. Other neurologic signs were not predictive of ischemia. Clinical features were not predictive of ischemia among patients not given AFD. Focal, thick collections of blood on CT were highly predictive of ischemia, whether or not patients received AFD. Admitting CT is the best prognostic indicator for the development of cerebral ischemia after SAH. It should be used to supplement the clinical examination in selecting patients best suited for therapy to prevent vasospasm.\r"

Immediate alterations of consciousness were significantly more likely to lead to accidents than were seizures beginning with an aura. Motor activity during simple partial seizures was also responsible for some accidents. Differences in seizure frequency may account for different crude accident rates among studies of epileptic drivers. We suggest guidelines for licensing restrictions that seem safe and reasonable.\r"

When areas with epileptiform discharges were left behind, good outcome was significantly less frequent. This correlation between complete resection and good outcome was independent of the presence or absence of CT-detected structural lesions or sharp waves on post-resection electrocorticography. These results support completeness of resection, defined by prolonged extraoperative EEG, as an important factor in seizure surgery.\r"

Sixty-five patients were followed either until they reached the endpoints or to the end of the study period. Survivorship curves were drawn to predict the distribution of time to onset of an endpoint in patients with and without the clinical signs. Time to reach the cognitive endpoint was shorter for patients with extrapyramidal signs or psychosis compared with those without these signs and symptoms. These clinical signs did not predict the functional endpoint. We conclude that extrapyramidal signs and psychosis may be useful predictors of intellectual decline in Alzheimer's disease.\r"

Crude prevalence ratio per 100,000 population was 152 (154 for men, 150 for women) with an age-adjusted ratio of 185 (both sexes). This study shows that the prevalence of PD in the Mediterranean area of South Europe is similar to that in North Europe and the United States.\r"

In newborns with a nuchal cord, the umbilical artery acidemia was usually mixed (68%) or respiratory (23%) in origin, and pure metabolic acidemia was infrequent (9%). We conclude that nuchal cords are associated with an increased prevalence of variable FHR decelerations in the first and second stages of labor and with an increased incidence of umbilical artery acidemia.\r"

We conducted a retrospective study (1979-1983) to identify antenatal events that may be associated with this disease. Thirty-seven mothers of neonates with this disorder were compared with 150 randomly selected control patients. Logistic regression analysis revealed that meconium, maternal fever (caused by urinary tract infection, upper respiratory infection, chorioamnionitis, and unknown causes), maternal anemia (caused by abruptio placentae, placenta previa, and unknown causes), and maternal pulmonary disease (caused by asthma and/or pneumonia) were associated with persistent pulmonary hypertension of the neonate. The computed odds ratios for the variables associated with this disease were increased significantly above the controls. In addition, cesarean section, nonvertex presentation, fetal distress, and vaginal bleeding were found to be significant on univariate analyses. The cesarean section rate in the study group was 59%, with the primary indications of fetal distress and/or third-trimester bleeding in 77.3% of instances. These data suggest that antenatal risk factors and the computed odds ratio may help identify pregnancies likely to produce infants at high risk for persistent pulmonary hypertension of the neonate.\r"

The results indicate that patients destined to develop preterm labor had this contractility pattern significantly more often than did their counterparts who delivered at term (13.5 versus 9.2%; P less than .01). Parity and gestational age had no effect on the occurrence of low-amplitude, high-frequency contractility, but this pattern was also significantly more prevalent in the presence of multifetal gestations, independent of the occurrence of preterm labor. The institution of tocolytic therapy was accompanied by a 50% decrease in the proportion of time occupied by low-amplitude, high-frequency contractions. Although this contraction pattern occurred significantly more often among patients who later developed preterm labor, calculations of its predictive values, specificity, and sensitivity indicate that its presence has relatively limited clinical significance.\r"

Difficulty with infant delivery was significantly less frequent with both the Maylard and Pfannenstiel when the incision was at least 15 cm in length. These results suggest that cesarean delivery is performed optimally with an adequate surgical incision, and that the Maylard incision is a safe option which should be strongly considered when risk factors (eg, macrosomia, twins) demand maximal surgical exposure for nontraumatic abdominal delivery.\r"

The purpose of this report was to present the results of a year-long, prospective study in which the indications for trial of labor were liberalized. Only patients with a previous classical incision or \"T\" incision on the uterus were excluded. Two hundred seventy-two patients elected to undergo a trial of labor. Vaginal delivery occurred in 216 patients (76.5%). Oxytocin was used as needed, and epidural anesthesia was used in all patients who requested it. One uterine rupture occurred in a patient with a single lower transverse scar. The results of this study suggest that a trial of labor is a safe alternative for patients with a previous single or multiple lower uterine transverse incision or a lower uterine vertical incision. In addition, the use of epidural anesthesia and oxytocin appears safe in patients undergoing a trial of labor.\r"

The antibiotics were administered after delivery of the infant. The two groups were comparable with respect to recognized risk factors for postcesarean infection. There were no statistically significant differences between the groups in the incidence of standard febrile morbidity, endomyometritis, urinary tract infection, wound infection, and bacteremia. There were also no significant differences between the groups in the fever index or the duration of hospitalization. We conclude that cefazolin and cefonicid provide a similar degree of prophylaxis against infection in patients having unscheduled cesarean delivery.\r"

However, successful version was more likely in parous women than in nulliparous women, and less likely with cornual than with other placentations. Amniotic fluid volume, fetal abdominal circumference, type of breech, and the specific nature of the maternal-fetal spatial relation were also important determinants of success. Fetal biparietal diameter, gestational age, and estimated fetal weight were not. All of these factors can be evaluated before attempting version and can be used when counseling candidates for version.\r"

  ".W": "A prospective study was undertaken to critically evaluate the endocervical curettage. The study group consisted of 261 patients with colposcopically identifiable cervical lesions that had not been previously biopsied and were not macroscopically suspicious for invasive cancer. In 210 patients, the entire lesion, transformation zone, and squamocolumnar junction were visible (satisfactory colposcopy), and in 51 patients, the full extent of the lesion was not visualized colposcopically (unsatisfactory colposcopy). We used a method of examination not previously described. Colposcopy was performed before and after the endocervical curettage, but before the ectocervical biopsy. This method of examination allowed us to identify potentially contaminated endocervical curettages and to test the null hypothesis that a positive endocervical curettage in patients with satisfactory colposcopy is not the result of contamination. Twenty of 210 endocervical curettages in patients with satisfactory colposcopy were potentially contaminated, as suggested by an ectocervical lesion disrupted by the endocervical curettage. No patient with a positive endocervical curettage had an intact ectocervical lesion. Therefore, the null hypothesis was rejected (P less than .005). Of the 51 patients with unsatisfactory colposcopy, 39 (76%) underwent cone biopsy. Invasive cancer was diagnosed by cone biopsy in two patients when both ectocervical biopsy and endocervical curettage demonstrated only dysplasia. We also confirmed that patients with unsatisfactory colposcopy occasionally benefit from having an endocervical curettage. However, basing the treatment plan for any lesion short of invasive cancer solely on the results of colposcopy, ectocervical biopsy, and/or endocervical curettage could lead to significant undertreatment of some patients.\r"

We studied consecutively 735 women who underwent mammography at two rural midwestern hospitals to determine the factors that influence the decision to undergo mammography. Those who underwent mammography had significantly more education and higher household incomes than the general population. The decision to have mammography was influenced by many factors, the most important of which were encouragement by the doctor, influence of the media, and the cost of the mammogram. Women of higher socioeconomic status were most likely to be influenced by the media, particularly printed material, but were much less likely than women of lower socioeconomic status to report physician influence as an important factor. These data have implications for the methods physicians use in recommending mammography to individual patients.\r"

Surgically menopausal women were randomly selected to have either 25-mg or 50-mg pellets implanted subcutaneously. The bone mineral content of the midshaft of the nondominant radius in the combined group--measured by single photon absorptiometry--increased by 1.8% over the two-year period of observation (P less than .03); the distal bone mineral content of the radius was maintained at 0.8% per annum. No adverse effects were noted in the coagulation profiles or in the coagulation inhibition and fibrinolysis assays of both groups. Serum high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglycerides were unaltered, but serum cholesterol values decreased during the six-month period of observation by 14 mg/dL (P less than .05) and 11 mg/dL in the 25- and 50-mg groups, respectively. Carbohydrate and insulin metabolism was unaffected, as was the systolic and diastolic blood pressure. There were no significant intergroup differences in any of the parameters measured. The serum estradiol/estrone ratios of 1.45 and 1.59 reflected a physiologic estrogen milieu at the 25- and 50-mg dosages. Subcutaneous 17 beta-estradiol pellets can effectively maintain the bone mineral content of surgically menopausal women without inducing adverse cardiovascular side effects.\r"

  ".W": "Eighteen patients with residual epithelial ovarian cancer at second-look laparotomy were treated with a combined total of 210 cycles of intraperitoneal cis-platinum. Sixteen patients had previously received cis-platinum containing combination chemotherapy systemically. Seven patients had microscopic residual disease at the start of intraperitoneal therapy, eight had macroscopic disease of 5 mm in diameter or less, and three had disease of 6-10 mm in diameter. The drug was administered weekly in 2 L of Ringer's lactate solution via an indwelling Tenckhoff catheter, and the dose ranged from 30-270 mg per cycle (median 120 mg). The dwell time was 20 minutes. After 12 cycles, response was assessed by open laparoscopy (six patients), laparotomy (eight patients), or peritoneal cytology (three patients). One patient developed distant metastases. Local and systemic toxicity was mild. Delays of therapy were necessary for eight of the 210 cycles because of hematologic toxicity. Of the 15 patients available for pathologic evaluation, four (26.6%) had a complete response and two (13.3%) had a partial response. Results of this pilot study suggest a possible role for intraperitoneal cis-platinum in the management of carefully selected patients with epithelial ovarian cancer.\r"

  ".W": "From September 1981 until June 1986, eight patients with metastatic ovarian stromal tumors were entered into a prospective phase II study to determine the efficacy of a chemotherapy regimen combining cisplatin, doxorubicin, and cyclophosphamide. Patients received cisplatin 40-50 mg/m2 intravenously (IV), doxorubicin 40-50 mg/m2 IV, and cyclophosphamide 400-500 mg/m2 IV, all on day 1 every 28 days. The median age was 43 years (range 24-65 years). Two patients had stage II disease, one had stage III, and five had recurrent disease (original stage: four stage I and one stage III). The median number of chemotherapy cycles was six (range four to 14). Three patients (38%) had a complete response to therapy (two confirmed by second-look laparotomy), and two patients (25%) achieved a partial response (one verified by second-look laparotomy). The overall response rate was 63%. Toxicity was minimal. Four patients are disease-free at 13+ to 48+ months, one patient is alive with disease at six+ months, and three patients are dead of tumor at four, 17, and 36 months from the start of chemotherapy. These results indicate that the combination of cisplatin, doxorubicin, and cyclophosphamide has modest activity in the treatment of metastatic ovarian stromal tumor.\r"

Three patterns of invasion were predefined: carcinoma in situ with early stromal invasion (33%), pushing (8%), and infiltrative (59%). Infiltrative pattern and invasion deeper than 1.5 mm equally predicted nodal metastases (P = .045), although depth measurement in biopsy specimens was subject to sampling error. Confluence and absence of carcinoma in situ each predicted extranodal recurrence (P = .011). Local recurrence appeared more related to inadequate surgical margins than failure to perform radical vulvectomy. Carcinoma in situ with early stromal invasion represents a group at zero risk for nodal metastases. We recommend wide local excision for all stage I lesions. In general, omission of lymphadenectomy should be reserved for cases of carcinoma in situ with early stromal invasion.\r"

  ".W": "To simplify the procedure for obtaining individual growth curve standards, we investigated the use of models derived from the slopes of growth curves determined before 26 weeks' menstrual age. In serial examinations of 33 normal fetuses between 15-38 weeks, we obtained measurements of the biparietal diameter (BPD), head circumference, abdominal circumference, femur diaphysis length, head profile area, abdominal profile area, head cube, and abdominal cube. Rossavik models fitted to these data provided estimates of the coefficients c and s, and fitting linear models to the data before 26 weeks gave estimates of growth curve slopes. Slopes were also estimated from two data points at approximately 16 and 25 weeks. Regression analysis demonstrated a strong linear relationship between loge c and loge SLOPE1 (R2 = 87.3-98.4%), and between s and c (R2 = 64.9-90.3%). Using these relationships, growth models were determined from the slope values. Comparisons between observed measurements and those predicted by these models for the period after 26 weeks indicated that the methods of slope calculation were equally accurate in predicting future growth, and that this accuracy was very similar to that obtained with models based on regression analysis. These results demonstrate that individual growth curve standards for at least eight anatomic parameters during the last 14 weeks of pregnancy can be determined from the data obtained in two examinations before 26 weeks' menstrual age.\r"

Collagen bandage lenses therefore may be useful in the treatment of a variety of ocular surface problems.\r"

The tip has an opening on the side and end, both 0.20 mm in diameter, for aspiration. The opening at the end serves to remove the cells at the equator. The top of the tip is sandblasted to provide an abrasive surface. This tip is connected to a phacoemulsifier handle. After nucleus delivery and cortex removal, the tip is inserted beneath the inner surface of the anterior capsule. The cells are detached by the abrasive tip, which vibrates by ultrasound, and then aspirated. Histologic examination revealed that the cells can be removed completely, and that this method is more effective than vacuum cleaning.\r"

  ".W": "We present two unique cases of unilateral blepharochalasis. Blepharochalasis is an idiopathic disorder of young adults manifested by intermittent, recurrent episodes of eyelid edema. After repeated episodes of swelling, the periorbital tissue develops premature aging with thinned, redundant skin and stretching of the eyelid tendons. Blepharochalasis is considered bilateral; unilateral cases are extremely rare. Ptosis surgery in these cases may be unpredictable due to alterations in the levator aponeurosis. Simple reattachment of the apparent edge of the disinserted levator aponeurosis may cause significant overcorrection and variations in postoperative eyelid heights. Our two unilateral cases demonstrated proptosis on the affected side, and prominent vessels in the levator aponeurosis and suborbicularis muscle planes, plus vascular changes in orbital fat in one case. Blepharochalasis therefore may be an orbital rather than a periorbital disease, as suggested previously. Proptosis is probably overlooked in the usual bilateral cases. When all other causes of unilateral swelling have been ruled out and the findings are consistent with blepharochalasis, this diagnosis should be considered.\r"

Electron microscopy showed persistent lymphocytes and macrophages throughout the course, while plasma cells appeared at the height of the inflammation corresponding to the locally elevated antibody titers. There was no electron microscopic evidence of viral infection in the aqueous cells examined.\r"

Recent studies have shown that the major subunit protein composing amyloid fibrils in these conditions is a variant or abnormal prealbumin molecule and that affected individuals have low levels of this protein in their blood. The authors studied material obtained at vitrectomy from two cases of vitreous amyloid. One of these was nonfamilial and the other familial. Two-dimensional gels of solubilized protein from pelleted and washed vitreous amyloid in both cases were found to consist of material with the molecular weight and isofocusing coordinates of prealbumin monomer. Reactivity of fibrils with a monospecific antiserum to prealbumin was confirmed by colloidal gold immunoelectron microscopy. Non-familial as well as familial vitreous amyloid may in fact be systemic forms of amyloidosis due to deposition of prealbumin which can be characterized by biochemical or immunohistologic studies of material obtained at vitrectomy.\r"

Of the 2111 eyes with uveal melanomas, secondary IOP elevation was present in 55 (3%). Secondary IOP elevation was present in 7% of eyes with iris melanoma, 17% with ciliary body melanoma, and 2% with choroidal melanoma. The most common mechanism of elevated IOP was tumor invasion of the angle in the case of iris melanomas, pigment dispersion and tumor invasion of the angle in the case of ciliary body melanomas, and iris neovascularization in the case of choroidal melanomas. Of the 256 eyes with uveal metastases, secondary IOP elevation was found in 12 eyes (5%). Secondary IOP elevation was present in 64% of eyes with iris metastases, 67% with ciliary body metastases, and 1% with choroidal metastases. The most common mechanism of elevated IOP was tumor invasion of the angle in the case of iris and ciliary body metastases, and angle closure in the case of choroidal metastases. There were 303 eyes with retinoblastoma, 17% of which had elevated IOP which was secondary to iris neovascularization in 70% of cases and to an angle closure without neovascularization in 27%. Several other intraocular tumors including lymphoma, leukemia, medulloepithelioma, melanocytoma, and adenoma of the iris pigment epithelium were occasionally associated with secondary elevated IOP.\r"

Aqueous phenylephrine hydrochloride (2.5%) given in the commercially available drop volume of 32 microliters was compared with 10% aqueous phenylephrine given in an 8-microliters volume. Both preparations contained the same total amount of phenylephrine per drop. Ten subjects had both eyes dilated with each of the phenylephrine solutions according to a randomized, double-crossover sequence. The mean final pupillary diameter was nearly 1.0 mm larger for the 8-microliters drop (P = 0.0033). Nine of ten subjects achieved a larger pupillary diameter with the 8-microliters drop. Systemic absorption, as measured by plasma phenylephrine level, was similar for the two drop volumes. Thus, the 8-microliters drop achieved a significantly larger pupillary dilation without an increase in systemic absorption. Phenylephrine may have the most favorable risk-benefit ratio when administered as a high concentration in a small volume.\r"

Similar results are presented for 22 eyes from patients with pseudoexfoliation glaucoma.

Patients were evaluated upon entry and at 6-month intervals. Scheimpflug lens photographs (Topcon SL45) were taken at each visit. All photographs were evaluated by densitometry which allowed quantification of the light scattering in the various lens layers. A significant and progressive (4-7% every 6 months) increase in light scattering was observed in the lens anterior superficial lens cortex over 24 months. The rate of change in lens clarity was similar in all patients regardless of the clinically observable lens change type (nuclear, cortical, posterior subcapsular, or mixed). Patients who were younger at enrollment, having diabetes of shorter duration and higher glycosylated hemoglobin values (a measure of long-term glucose control), were identified to be at greater risk of having increased densitometry values in the anterior superficial lens cortex. Only a few patients had significant changes in visual acuity during 24 months, and the correlation of superficial cortical lens clarity changes to clinical cataract formation and visual impairment remains to be established.\r"

The risk of bilaterality in patients with arteritic AION was found to be 1.9 times the risk in patients with nonarteritic AION (P = 0.0118). The cumulative incidence curve, considering the time taken to develop bilateral AION for nonarteritic cases was significantly (P = 0.0103) different from that for arteritic cases. The estimated 25th-percentile time to development of bilateral AION was much shorter in patients with arteritic AION (0.4 month) than in those with nonarteritic AION (32.4 months). In arteritic AION, unilateral as well as bilateral AION had almost invariably developed before systemic steroid therapy was started and not after, indicating that this therapy is effective in preventing the development of AION in giant cell arteritis. In nonarteritic AION, the risk of bilaterality was significantly greater in men (P = 0.0113) and in young (less than 45 years old) patients with diabetes (P = 0.0245), with no significant difference attributable to the other age groups or other associated systemic diseases. In this study, it was found that young diabetic men have a risk of AION developing in the second eye that is 1.56 times the risk in young diabetic women, 2.56 times the risk in women who either are nondiabetic or are not young, and 1.64 times the risk in both older men and nondiabetic men.\r"

The results of the study indicate that deficits in visual function are common after resolution of optic neuritis.\r"

The results were compared to conventional cycloplegic retinoscopy in a blind study. Significant amblyogenic conditions, such as hyperopic anisometropias of more than 1.0 diopter (D), high ametropias, or astigmatism and strabismus cases of 2 degrees to 3 degrees or more are detectable. The technique provides a simple and useful tool for mass screening of infants. The sensitivity of the method for detecting amblyopia seems to be at least as high as in visual checking. Media opacities are recordable, and a permanent document is obtained.\r"

This is the first report of a series of patients with this condition previously termed simultaneous or synergistic divergence. All patients had a large exotropia, and two had a horizontal face turn away from the involved eye. A large (14 mm) lateral rectus muscle recession done on one of these children reduced the face turn but did not eliminate the simultaneous abduction. Clinical, intraoperative, and electromyographic data suggest that this condition is an unusual variant of type 2 Duane's syndrome.\r"

Synthetic keratophakia for the correction of aphakia has several inherent advantages over alternative forms of refractive surgery which use lathed corneal tissue. For example, the ability to produce a synthetic lens to precise specifications before surgery is a dramatic advantage over the use of lathed tissue lenses whose refractive properties cannot be determined until weeks or months after the lens is in place on the recipient cornea. Synthetic materials appear to behave in a predictable manner and are biocompatible. Both polysulfones and hydrogel materials can be used to correct aphakia in clinical situations where other modalities are less appropriate.\r"

However, corneal involvement, as well as similar and recurrent lesions, were also present in the larynx, vocal cords, trachea, nose, vagina, cervix, and gingiva. Many recurrences (up to 10 times) rapidly followed simple surgical excision in all patients. Histopathologically, the lesions were characterized by subepithelial, eosinophilic, amorphous material admixed with acute and chronic inflammatory cells. The finding of amorphous material containing fibrin, immunoglobulins, and albumin suggested leakage from hyperpermeable blood vessels. Electron microscopic studies of the lesions disclosed few abnormal blood vessels with wide gaps between endothelial cells that were surrounded by a thick multilaminar basement membrane. The duration of the disease ranged from 4 months to 44 years. After several recurrences, spontaneous resolution occurred in six patients.\r"

Histologically, the lesion was a dermal nevus, but extended deeply into subcutaneous tissue and had neuroid features. The ultrastructural characteristics of melanocytes varied according to the depth at which they resided, but cells did not differ basically from melanocytes found in smaller acquired nevi.

Patients with mild blepharospasm responded significantly longer to Botulinum injection, than those with severe spasms. The response to Botulinum was not significantly different in patients with Meige syndrome than in patients with only essential blepharospasm. Patients previously treated surgically for essential blepharospasm did not respond differently than those patients with no previous surgical therapy. The authors believe that Botulinum toxin injection is an effective, although temporary, mode of therapy for the signs and symptoms of this focal dystonia.

  ".W": "Molecular genetic (genotypic) analysis elucidates gene rearrangements within lymphocytes that are responsible for either immunoglobulin production in B-lymphocytes or the expression of cell-surface antigen recognition receptors in T-lymphocytes. Molecular genetic analysis is far more sensitive than immunophenotypic methods for the detection of small clones of lymphocytes because as few as 2 to 5% of cells in an infiltrate can be discovered to possess the same rearranged DNA sequences with genetic probes. In truly polyclonal proliferations, each lymphocyte reorganizes its immunoglobulin or T-antigen receptor genes in a unique manner, resulting in an almost infinite number of combinations of genetic rearrangement and the absence of any new hybridizing bands upon Southern blotting. In monoclonal proliferations, a new, homogeneous, nongermline band is identified on Southern blotting because a sufficiently large number of lymphocytes exhibit an identical genetic rearrangement. In a group of five orbital lymphoid tumors that appeared to be benign reactive hyperplasias by light microscopy and that were polyclonal by immunophenotypic methods, three were found by molecular genetic analysis to harbor small clones of B-lymphocytes with new rearrangement bands on Southern blotting. No clonal abnormalities of T-lymphocytes were found in these five lesions, despite the fact that they were the preponderant cells in the tumors. These observations suggest that \"reactive lymphoid hyperplasia\" of the orbit may be an unstable lesion, owing to a T-cell immunoregulatory imbalance, with the potential for developing clonal expansions of B-lymphocytes that nonetheless usually remain localized to the orbit.\r"

The first patient presented with a slowly developing palpable mass in the upper and anterior orbit. This localized lesion proved to be a reactive plasma cell proliferation. The second case had a 3-month history of proptosis, diplopia, and droopy eyelid and a pulsatile temporal mass with bone destruction. Results of biopsy and systemic investigations showed a solitary plasmacytoma of bone. In the third case, a patient with a known multiple myeloma for 2 years presented with a progressive osteolytic mass which proved on biopsy to be a plasmacytoma. At the time, she also had other active bone lesions. The fourth case presented as a possible orbital cellulitis in a man with known multiple myeloma for 2 years. He proved to have disseminated myeloma, the orbital infiltrate being secondary to sinus involvement. The differential diagnosis for each case can be quite involved. Each case required a biopsy for an accurate diagnosis in addition to a complete clinical, radiographic, and laboratory workup. The pathologic features of each tumor can be misleading. These will be discussed as well as the use of ancillary diagnostic methods such as electron microscopy and immunohistochemistry to further characterize each lesion.

Children with neurogenic bladder dysfunction resulting from myelodysplasia are rarely diverted, but are started at an early age with ICC. It is hoped that in future the contents of this article on diversion techniques and undiversion will be of historical interest, however. Note: The editors also have found the use of the Mitrofanoff procedure, utilizing a nonrefluxing tunnel and a catheterizable stoma made out of the ureter or appendix, to be a very valuable addition to the reconstructive surgeon's armamentarium. We also feel that use of detubularized bowel for either bladder augmentation or replacement provides more efficient storage capability. Occasional reports of extremely significant diarrhea after removal of the ileocecal segment from the intestinal tract have been reported in children with myelodysplasia.\r"

  ".W": "To estimate the impact of antiviral therapy and prophylaxis on the natural course of the infection, 288 cases of varicella in children with cancer were reviewed. Among 127 patients with untreated infections, the overall mortality rate was 7%. Varicella-zoster virus pneumonitis developed in 28% of the untreated patients and was associated with a 25% mortality rate. Pneumonitis was much more likely to develop in patients with acute leukemia than in those with other malignancies (32% v 19%). Similarly, deaths due to pneumonitis were restricted to patients with acute leukemia. Lymphopenia (absolute lymphocyte count less than 500/microL) was significantly associated with varicella-zoster virus pneumonitis and a higher fatality rate among patients with this complication. Both acyclovir and adenine arabinoside, administered to 18 and 28 patients, respectively, stopped the progression of skin lesions; however, pneumonitis developed in none of the acyclovir recipients after two days of treatment, compared with 29% of the adenine arabinoside recipients (P = .03). Passive immunization in 45 children who subsequently had varicella was associated with an 11% incidence of varicella-zoster virus pneumonitis. Despite passive immunization of approximately 150 children, the attack rate of varicella at our institution remains unchanged. Results of this study demonstrate the efficacy of antiviral therapy and passive immunization in patients with childhood cancer and varicella, but prevention of the infection will require a universal vaccine.\r"

Overall evidence of vaccine effectiveness as judged by vaccine virus shedding or a serologic response was seen in 82% of vaccinees. No clinical illness was seen in the rotavirus vaccinees when compared with 40 concurrently studied control children. No transmission to control children was observed even with close daily contact in a day-care setting. Young infants, generally less than 1 year of age, who had not previously experienced wild-type rotavirus infection shed significantly more vaccine virus. Limitation of virus shedding in those already exposed may be related to a prompt copro-IgA response which was significantly elevated by three days after vaccination. In summary, the development of this rotavirus vaccine, rhesus rotavirus-MMU-18006, is a promising step in the development of immunoprophylaxis against this major enteric pathogen.\r"

In the first study, 13 boys with attention deficit disorder participating in a summer treatment program went through a double-blind, within-subject trial of each form of methylphenidate and placebo. Measures of social and cognitive behavior were gathered in classroom and play settings. Although group analyses of the data showed that both drugs were effective and there were few differences between them, standard methylphenidate was superior to SR-20 on several important measures of disruptive behavior. Furthermore, analyses of individual responsivity showed clearly that most boys responded more positively to standard methylphenidate than to SR-20. The second study involved a partially overlapping group of nine boys with attention deficit disorder participating in the same summer treatment program. Also double-blind, within-subject, and placebo controlled, this study tracked the time courses of the two forms of methylphenidate. Both were shown to have similar time courses on the Abbreviated Conners Rating Scale and other measures, but SR-20 had a slower onset than did the standard drug form on a continuous performance task. Effects of SR-20 were still evident eight hours after ingestion.\r"

Previous research findings have often been conflicting because of a failure to distinguish intrauterine growth retardation from prematurity, differences in focus (means v rates), inadequate control for confounding variables, and insufficient statistical power. This review of the English and French language medical literature published between 1970 and 1984 is based on a critical assessment and meta-analysis of 895 studies concerning 43 potential determinants of intrauterine growth or gestational duration. Based on methodologic standards established a priori for each candidate determinant, the best studies were used to assess the existence and magnitude of an independent causal effect on birth weight, gestational age, prematurity, and intrauterine growth retardation. Factors with well-established direct causal impacts are identified, and their relative importance is indicated for \"typical\" developing and developed country settings. Modifiable factors with large effects are targeted for public health intervention in the two settings. Finally, factors of potential quantitative importance, but for which data are either unavailable or inconclusive, are highlighted as priorities for future research.\r"

In a cross-over design study, five patients with cystic fibrosis (12.1 +/- 2.6 years of age) and three control subjects received either placebo or taurine (30 mg/kg/d) for two 1-week periods, a month apart, followed by a fat meal test. Blood samples were drawn 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8 hours after the meal. Four patients with cystic fibrosis and severe steatorrhea despite appropriate enzyme therapy showed a significant (P less than .05) improvement in the absorption of triglycerides, total fatty acids, and linoleic acid while receiving taurine supplements. Three control subjects and one child with cystic fibrosis and mild steatorrhea receiving enzyme therapy did not experience such an effect. The difference in triglyceride absorption, when calculated as the area under the curve, receiving and not receiving taurine was significantly (P less than .05) correlated with the degree of steatorrhea. Furthermore, in contrast to control subjects, the fatty acid composition of chylomicrons in these four study patients showed important discrepancies with that of the fat meal and was corrected, in part, by taurine supplementation. These results suggest that taurine supplementation could be a useful adjunct in the management of patients with cystic fibrosis with ongoing fat malabsorption and essential fatty acid deficiency.\r"

At 5 years of age, a significant number of infants were correctly classified on the McCarthy General Cognitive Index and on the verbal, perceptual-performance, and quantitative subscales based on the variability of the fundamental frequency, variability of the first formant, and amplitude and duration of the cry.

To determine the incidence of catheter colonization in our neonatal intensive care unit (NICU), 25 consecutively removed percutaneous central venous catheters were examined by rinsing the lumen with saline and plating the rinse fluid on Sabouraud dextrose agar overlaid with olive oil. M furfur grew from the lumina of eight catheters (32%). Surveillance skin cultures were performed in the NICU on two occasions to determine the prevalence of skin colonization with M furfur. M furfur was found on the skin of 64% of the infants. In contrast, only 3% (1/33) of healthy, nonhospitalized infants 2 to 8 weeks of age had skin colonized with M furfur. During the 5-month study period, two NICU infants had evidence of systemic infection with M furfur. We conclude that M furfur frequently colonizes both the skin and percutaneous central venous catheters in NICU infants. Further studies are needed to determine the relationship between skin colonization and catheter colonization, and the factors contributing to systemic disease with this organism.\r"

This high prevalence of syphilis and gonorrhea and the high frequency of disease without physical signs of illness indicate the desirability of screening high-risk adolescents for these and other sexually transmitted diseases.

The limited data available reveal that excessive postneonatal deaths among native American infants largely result from preventable accidents and treatable acute medical conditions, such as pneumonia and gastroenteritis. This suggests that native American infants leave the hospital healthy but go to unsafe environments, which decrease their chances of survival past 1 year. In particular, the poorer socioeconomic conditions that native American families experience and the related problems of alcoholism, unemployment, and family disorganization contribute to the high rate of postneonatal mortality. Intervention programs to lower native American postneonatal mortality should focus on promoting prompt recognition of and health seeking for treatable medical conditions and prevention of accidents and other postneonatal health problems. The roots of the problem of native American postneonatal mortality lie in the socioeconomic conditions of many Indian communities and cannot be addressed without recognition of how these factors combine with the health care delivery system to diminish life expectancy for native American infants.\r"

Ten subjects with right hemiplegia resulting from a cerebrovascular accident (mean age = 56 +/- 14 years) and 5 healthy subjects (mean age = 47 +/- 6 years) stood symmetrically on a movable force platform. During platform-induced sway, the support surface was translated horizontally to induce antero-posterior body sway about the ankle joints. Surface electromyographs were obtained from the tibialis anterior, quadriceps femoris, gastrocnemius, and hamstring muscles bilaterally. Prior knowledge appeared to have no significant influence on healthy subjects' ability to execute postural adjustments more rapidly during AP displacements. Hemiplegic subjects exhibited longer and more variable latencies in the paretic limb than in the nonparetic limb during voluntary AP weight shifts. When hemiplegic subjects had prior knowledge of the platform's movement (time and direction), latencies were significantly shorter in the paretic limb and could be as brief as those seen in the nonparetic limb. The results showed that prior knowledge may be an important treatment consideration for patients with muscle timing disorders.\r"

The heart rates of 12 healthy, female college students were measured immediately after walking in waist-deep water and on a treadmill at the same distance, durations, and speeds (2.55, 2.77, 3.02, and 3.31 km/hr). A significant increase in heart rate with increased speeds resulted from water walking (p less than .05); from rest to the fastest speed, it was 135% (96 bpm). For treadmill walking, the increase of 19% (13 bpm) was not significant. The heart rates for the water condition were significantly higher (p less than .05) at each speed. These findings indicate that water walking could serve as an effective exercise mode, for example, for cardiorespiratory fitness for individuals who are unable to perform such weight-bearing activities as jogging, fast walking, cycling, and dancing.\r"

An additional seven subjects with no history of injury to either ankle comprised Group 3 with 14 nonsprained control ankles. The experimenter tested all blindfolded subjects with active and passive attempts at replicating predetermined ankle joint positions in the inversion-eversion range of motion. An isokinetic dynamometer measured joint position. A two-way analysis of variance indicated no significant effect caused by ankle injury or noninjury. Passive judgments were significantly better than active judgments of joint position (p less than .01) in the nonsprained control group. The results suggest that joint receptors play a dominant role in joint angle detection and that muscle receptors are more valuable in the perception of joint movement.\r"

Twenty-three of 31 patients with prostheses were evaluated 7 to 35 months after receiving the prostheses. Ten (44%) of these patients wore their prostheses all day every day and used wheelchairs minimally or not at all. Over half of the patients evaluated used their wheelchairs most of the time. Two (9%) of the 23 patients had stopped wearing their prostheses. Patients who demonstrated increased walking distances and velocities at follow-up used their prostheses more and their wheelchairs less than did the other patients. Neither gait factors nor hip range of motion at discharge was predictive of continued prosthetic use. Functional outcome and prosthetic use were limited in this group of elderly patients with dysvascular AK and TK amputations. The results of this study may serve as a basis for clinical determination of prosthetic candidacy and functional goals.\r"

The exercises produced a significant difference (p less than .025) in the passive lumbar extension ROM between the male experimental and control groups preventing a loss of spinal mobility in the men who exercised. Analysis of the data revealed no significant difference between the female groups. The results are discussed in light of the clinical significance of lumbar extension ROM. We suggest further studies to examine the effects of lumbar extension exercises on patients with restricted ROM and low back pain.\r"

Good reliability was obtained in the atrophy inspection of the small muscles of the hand, in the sensitivity tests for touch and pain, and in the neck compression and axial manual traction tests. Fair reliability was obtained in muscle strength testing and in the estimation of the range of motion, and poor reliability was obtained for many palpations. Poor standardization of examination procedures and changes in the patients' attention were considered the main factors affecting reliability. Better operational definitions and procedures, such as the standardization of palpation pressure and traction force, are suggested for future studies.\r"

Reported onset of the ulcer was 10 months before referral for physical therapy. The MDRPS was chosen as an alternative treatment to conventional below-knee total contact casting (TCC) because of the stasis changes and fragile skin in the patient's lower extremities. The ulcer healed in 39 days after initiating treatment with the MDRPS.

Ablation or obliteration of the fractured frontal sinus is not necessary. Primary reconstruction of the sinus and nasofrontal duct drainage constitute the preferred treatment. \"Cranialization\" of a severely damaged sinus is performed by excision of the posterior wall plugging of the nasofrontal duct and reconstruction of the anterior wall. Reconstruction of the anterior wall with primary bone grafting may be necessary in selected patients.\r"

With adequate full-thickness release of this medial lip segment and subsequent rotation into the proper position, the C flap is advanced into the donor defect of the columellar base and is also used to lengthen the shortened columella on the cleft side. This results in placement of a scar that will closely simulate the \"mirror image\" of the noninvolved philtral column. Fifty-seven patients with unilateral cleft lip have been repaired utilizing this technique during the past 14 years. Several of these children have required secondary surgeries because of mucosal irregularities or residual nasal deformities, but none has required additional surgery because of inadequate rotation of the medial lip segment or for correction of any donor-site defect at the base of the columella.\r"

Tissue expansion was utilized for breast reconstruction when the remaining muscle and skin following modified radical mastectomy was insufficient to accommodate a prosthesis that matched in size and shape the opposite breast. All expanders were placed beneath an investing muscular pocket created by elevating the pectoralis major and serratus anterior. Postoperative expansion began within 1 week, and the breast was expanded to double the volume of the opposite breast. Twenty-two patients have completed their reconstruction with a mean follow-up in 7 months. There were nine complications, including five deflations and four infections. All patients have remained Baker I or Baker II. Creating ptosis to match the breast was accomplished by placing the expander below the rectus fascia and superiorly advancing this expanded tissue at the time of prosthesis placement. Primary breast reconstruction with tissue expansion following modified radical mastectomy is safe, simple, and produces a breast with excellent shape, size, texture, and patient satisfaction.\r"

Distribution of the volume into many intervals was safer than infrequent high-volume injections. Histology showed no reduction in vessel wall diameter or loss intimal integrity. Subendothelial cellular proliferation was an indicator of this rapid regeneration. Microvascular anastomoses performed in elongated arteries and veins had the same patency rate (90 percent) as in controls.\r"

  ".W": "The amputated canine limb was used to create a devascularized skeletal-muscle-containing model. The extremity was perfused with one of several solutions or merely cooled as a preservative measure during the devascularized period and then replanted. Perfusion of the limb with oxygenated fluorocarbon solution minimized edema formation and leakage of skeletal muscle enzymes into the serum following revascularization as compared to the other perfusates or to mere cooling. Histopathologic changes within the revascularized muscle were also minimized by the oxygenated fluorocarbon perfusion. It is probable that these findings will correlate with improved function of replanted extremities or free muscle flaps. The applicability of these findings to human extremity replantation and free-flap transfer is postulated. However, long-term human studies will be necessary to assess the function of extremities and flaps perfused with this solution prior to its general use in extremity replantation and free-flap transfer.\r"

  ".W": "Amputated rat hindlimbs were subjected to either normothermic (26 degrees C) or hypothermic (4 degrees C) ischemia. Experimental limbs had their microcirculation washed out (either before or after the ischemic insult) with a physiologic acellular plasma substitute previously reported to enhance flap survival following extended periods of warm ischemia. Control limbs were not washed out; i.e., stagnant blood remained in these limbs. Following the ischemic interval, amputated limbs were replanted. Monastral blue B, a colloidal pigment capable of labeling leaky blood vessels, was administered systemically to all rats just prior to vascular declamping. Limb biopsies of skin and muscle were harvested 30 minutes following revascularization in order to assess Monastral labeling and, therefore, the functional integrity of the microcirculation. Results confirm that stagnant blood under conditions of warm ischemia is detrimental to the functionality of the microcirculation in both skin (p less than 0.03) and muscle (p less than 0.007). Accordingly, perfusion washout, when performed prior to the ischemic period, enhances limb survival following 6 hours of warm ischemia (p less than 0.01). Hypothermia protects against the detrimental effects of stagnant blood; perfusion offers no benefit if hypothermic conditions prevail. Physiologic mechanisms responsible for these findings are discussed.\r"
