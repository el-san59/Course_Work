  ".W": "To stimulate ulcer patients undergoing operation for gastric outlet stenosis, pyloric obstruction was created in dogs and repaired with pyloroplasty to which was added truncal vagotomy, proximal gastric vagotomy, or no vagotomy. Gastric antral contractile activity after feeding a solid meal was studied before and after repair (2 week period of study). This activity was correlated with the initial lag and regulated phases of solid meal emptying. Five quantified indices of contractile activity measured during the first postprandial hour indicated variable and inconclusive results in the antrum during the lag phase (first 20 minutes). Consistent percentage changes in these indices after obstruction repair were seen during the subsequent regulated phase. Gastric work was reduced 28 to 35 percent, but not work capability (mean area), by pyloric obstruction in the no vagotomy dogs. Reductions seen in proximal gastric vagotomy dogs were not different from those in the no vagotomy dogs. Higher percentages of reduction in amplitude (70 percent) and mean area of contractions (53 percent) occurred after truncal vagotomy compared with what occurred in the no vagotomy dogs. Mean area was also reduced more compared with what occurred in the proximal gastric vagotomy dogs. These data indicate that the reduced gastric work after feeding and impaired work capability caused by truncal vagotomy when superimposed on that produced by pyloric obstruction may exaggerate gastric atony and contribute to the delayed recovery of gastric emptying seen in the clinical setting.\r"

Resting anal tone, maximum voluntary squeeze, and rectal functional capacity were significantly decreased in the rectal prolapse patients (p less than 0.02). During defecation attempts, external sphincter or pelvic floor electromyographic activity decreased in all of the control subjects, whereas six prolapse patients showed increased electromyographic activity and one had no change in activity (p less than 0.01). Continence to saline solution was also significantly impaired in prolapse patients (p less than 0.001). Postoperative studies in three patients who underwent repair revealed persistence of abnormal anorectal function and defecation dynamics. Patients with rectal prolapse have impaired resting and voluntary sphincter activity, decreased functional rectal capacity, and impaired continence. The failure of normal relaxation of the external sphincter or pelvic floor during defecation attempts, as demonstrated in the patients described herein, may contribute to the development of prolapse and denervation sphincter injury seen in such patients.\r"

If the barium enema revealed a polyp or other suspicious pathologic process, the patient was referred for colonoscopy. In 258 patients, findings of barium enema and flexible sigmoidoscopy were in agreement. The findings in 178 of these examinations were completely negative, and in the remaining 80 cases flexible endoscopy and barium enema revealed diverticulosis. In an additional 18 patients, negative findings on flexible sigmoidoscopy were followed by positive findings on barium enema. Thirteen of these 18 patients (72 percent) had negative findings on colonoscopies and therefore had false-positive findings on barium enema. In the remaining five patients (28 percent), an unsuspected colonic carcinoma or premalignant polyp was discovered on barium enema and documented by colonoscopy. Also, in four of these five patients, colonoscopy found additional polyps that were not seen on barium enema.\r"

Four of 131 radionuclide brain scans in primary breast cancer suggested calvarial metastasis, and the findings were confirmed with bone scans and skull radiographs. One of 95 computerized tomographic scans of the brain showed brain metastasis, and this patient had profound neurologic deficits. With respect to locoregional recurrence, the results of 2 of 23 radionuclide scans and 1 of 11 computerized tomographic scans were positive. All three patients had clinical evidence for brain metastasis. We conclude that in the absence of signs and symptoms, routine evaluation for brain metastasis is not justified in primary and locoregional recurrence of breast cancer.\r"

Among these elderly patients, 40.7 percent died in the hospital compared with 21.3 percent of the younger patients (p less than 0.05). Sepsis accounted for 72.7 percent of the hospital deaths among the elderly patients, in contrast to 25.9 percent among the younger patients. The overall incidence of hospital death due to sepsis was significantly higher in the elderly patients (p less than 0.001). Hepatic lobectomy or segmentectomy in the elderly patients with cirrhosis was followed by hospital death in 88.9 percent compared with 25 percent of the elderly patients without cirrhosis (p less than 0.01). A higher incidence of hospital death occurred among the elderly in Okuda's stage I (p less than 0.05), Child's class A (p less than 0.02), and in those with concomitant systemic disorders (p less than 0.05). We conclude that in patients 65 years of age or older with hepatocellular carcinoma, concomitant systemic disorders play a role in determining the outcome of hepatectomy. Elderly patients with cirrhosis are high-risk candidates for major hepatectomy for whom limited hepatic resection should be considered.\r"

Paramount, however, is the fear that they might jeopardize cure rates by inadvertently leaving residual tumor behind. In cutaneous melanoma, for example, wide excision of the primary tumor site, usually in combination with skin grafting, has been the standard for years. Recently, as the biologic characteristics of this neoplastic system have become better understood, a subset of patients has been identified who can be cured readily by surgical excision alone. It is in this low-risk group of patients that lesser margins of excisions have been advocated. To date, a majority of surgeons have not accepted this thesis. In an effort to study this further, one of us prospectively treated 45 patients with thin, low-risk melanomas by conservative excision of their primary tumor sites. The margins invariably were 2 cm or less, and two thirds of the patients were operated on as out-patients utilizing local anesthesia. After a mean follow-up period of 36 months, no recurrences of melanoma developed. Acceptance of this treatment appears appropriate in this subset of patients.\r"

In Group I, a standard hepatectomy removing two thirds of the organ was performed. In Group II, an oral dose of 10 mg/kg of cyclosporin A was given 1 day before and immediately, 24 hours, and 48 hours after the same hepatectomy. In Groups III and IV, azathioprine and methylprednisolone were administered in 8 mg/kg doses by way of the tail vein by the same protocol as in Group II. The mortality rate, liver weight restoration, and histologic and mitotic characteristics of the liver remnants, as well as serum levels of animotransferase, total bilirubin, and creatinine were examined from 24 hours to 10 days after the operation. Azathioprine and methylprednisolone substantially suppressed hepatocyte mitosis when compared with the control group; however, cyclosporin A treatment did not inhibit, but may, in fact, have stimulated liver cell proliferation. Changes in other parameters coincided with this phenomenon. The noninhibitory effect of cyclosporin A on liver regeneration has also been discussed.\r"

Incidence rates varied substantially by age and length of hospital stay from a low of 8 deaths per 100,000 patient-days for adult female patients with stays longer than 28 days to a high of 102 deaths per 100,000 patient-days for elderly men with stays of 7 to 28 days.

This pulmonary trapping is due either to the size of the platelet aggregates or to changes in the pulmonary microvasculature. To evaluate which one of these mechanisms is responsible for the trapping, we performed portacaval transposition in one group of pigs, making the liver the first receiving capillary bed for blood from the trauma sites in the lower extremities. One week after the operation, the platelets were labeled with indium oxine and reinfused, and the operated animals and a group of six control animals were subjected to standardized soft-tissue trauma to the lower extremities. Sequestration of platelets in the lungs and in the liver was registered dynamically before and for 90 minutes after the trauma. Soft-tissue trauma induced platelet sequestration in the liver in the operated group (p less than 0.01) and in the lungs in the control group (p less than 0.01). Trapping was paralleled by a decrease in the number of circulating platelets. This study has indicated that posttraumatic pulmonary platelet trapping is caused by platelet activation at the trauma sites and not by changes in the pulmonary microvasculature.\r"

Using computerized external gamma imaging, the percentage of splenic uptake of heat-damaged radiolabeled red blood cells was determined in adult Sprague-Dawley rats with eutopic (partial splenectomy) or ectopic (single or multiple autotransplantation) remnants or whole spleens, and in 14 patients with either an intact spleen or splenic remnants after treatment for trauma or hypersplenism. The masses of both eutopic and ectopic remnants correlated directly with the percentage of heat-damaged red blood cell uptake, but the percentage of uptake per gram was higher in eutopic remnants, paralleling more vigorous compensatory growth. In patients, the percentage of heat-damaged red blood cell uptake by remnant spleens was similar to that seen in the rats and, in addition, was supernormal in those with congestive splenomegaly. This noninvasive technique both provides a vivid biplanar image and quantifies blood-borne particle trapping, which is a key splenic function. A heat-damaged red blood cell uptake of less than 15 percent after splenic salvage suggests marginal splenic performance and continued vulnerability to overwhelming sepsis.\r"

In patients with normal appendices, postoperative sepsis was extremely low. For early and late appendicitis, the infection rates of the trainees decreased as experiences accumulated, but they were still higher than that of the senior surgeons. The difference in infection rates in acute appendicitis did not reach statistical significance between any of the training stages and between the various stages and the rate of the senior surgeons. The differences in infection rates in late appendicitis between stage 1 and stage 3 was significant, as was the difference in infection rates between stage 1 and the infection rate of the senior surgeons. Therefore, we have concluded that overall, the limited experience of trainees is related to the rate of postoperative sepsis in late appendicitis, although the infection rates of individual trainees vary a lot.\r"

Although removal of the graft has generally been recommended in the literature, the role of lesser procedures, the need for alternate revascularization, and a precise plan of attack are ill defined. We have treated 18 patients with infection of aortic prostheses. Specific risk factors potentially promoting infection included reoperation, septic complications, or gastrointestinal entry at the time of graft placement. Clinical signs of infection included chronic draining sinus in eight patients, localized groin abscess in three patients, groin swelling in four patients, gastrointestinal bleeding in two patients, and pseudoaneurysm in one patient. Treatment by local therapy, including catheter irrigation of sinus tracts, debridement, and local antibiotics, resulted in failure in eight of nine patients. If the sinogram of a groin sinus showed no communication with the body of the graft, resection of a graft limb was successful in 66 percent of the patients. If the sinus communicated with the body of the graft, total resection was mandatory. When total excision was necessary, all patients required revascularization by means of an extraanatomic bypass. The mortality rate was 33 percent and was primarily due to bleeding fistulas. An aggressive approach to this serious problem with early graft excision is encouraged.\r"

Eleven of 12 were diagnosed preoperatively on computerized tomography by the triad of air in the bladder, thickened colon adjacent to an area of thickened bladder, and the presence of colonic diverticula. Contrast enema examinations demonstrated the fistula in only three of eight patients studied. The remaining 20 patients proved to have uncomplicated acute diverticulitis. Findings on computerized tomography included the presence of a segmentally thickened colon with diverticula but without the findings of an abscess or a colovesical fistula. Computerized tomography correctly visualized acute diverticular complications in 21 of 22 patients and it excluded an abscess or fistula in all 20 patients with uncomplicated acute diverticulitis who were suspected of having a diverticular complication. Computerized tomography is the most sensitive and specific test for diagnosing complications of acute diverticulitis. It should be an early consideration in patients with suspected diverticular abscesses or fistulas so that appropriate therapy is not delayed.\r"

The bile of patients with percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage was also cultured for bacteriologic studies. There was a significantly positive correlation between the endotoxin levels and both immunoglobulin A-containing circulating immune complex and immunoglobulin G-containing circulating immune complex. The endotoxin levels of the patients with gram-negative infections were significantly increased compared with those of the patients with sterile cultures. The immunoglobulin G-containing circulating immune complex levels of the patients with bacteria in bile were significantly increased compared with those of the patients with sterile cultures. The immunoglobulin A-containing circulating immune complex levels of the patients with bacteria in bile were slightly increased, but the difference did not reach statistical significance. These results indicate that one of the causes of increased circulating immune complex levels may be endotoxemia in combination with biliary infection in patients with biliary obstruction.\r"

The bacteriuria was correlated to the position of the appendix, the duration of disease, and the degree of inflammatory changes in the appendix. The results suggest direct spread of bacteria from the inflamed appendix to the urinary tract due to close anatomic relationship and to the severity of the inflammatory changes. That this spread of bacteria can have clinical significance cannot be excluded. Urinary sedimentation study is of no use in the diagnosis of acute appendicitis.\r"

Thirty patients were studied prospectively. Twenty-five of the patients were suspected of having peritonitis but doubt existed because of an unreliable history or equivocal or confusing abdominal signs. Five remaining patients were comatose and an intraabdominal source of sepsis needed to be excluded. The technique of lavage and criteria for diagnosis have been presented herein. There were 10 true-positive results, no false-positive results, 19 true-negative results, and one false-negative result (positive predictive value 100 percent, confidence level 95 percent). There were no complications due to the test. Peritoneal lavage is a useful method of diagnosing or excluding peritonitis in patients with confusing abdominal signs. Negative results of laparotomy or prolonged observation may thus be obviated in such patients.\r"

Bupivacaine (3 and 5 micrograms/ml) significantly decreased diastolic resting potential, maximum rate of depolarization, and action potential amplitude. Lidocaine (10-20 micrograms/ml) also decreased maximum rate of depolarization and action potential amplitude, but the decreases were significantly different from those produced by B. High concentrations of B (30 micrograms/ml) and L (100 micrograms/ml) resulted in delayed conduction between Purkinje fibers and ventricular muscle cells and, ultimately, conduction blockade. The duration of conduction blockade was significantly longer with B than with L. The results of this study indicate that B produces electrophysiologic changes in cardiac tissue that may produce ventricular arrhythmias of a reentrant type.\r"

Argon laser light penetrates deep into the skin and makes this laser type preferable for simulating pain arising from surgical skin incisions. Short argon laser pulses were applied to the skin and three parameters were quantified before and during analgesia; sensory threshold, pain threshold, and the pain-related cortical response (latency and amplitude). Determination of sensory and pain thresholds made it possible to distinguish between two levels of analgesia; the pain block, where no pain was felt but other sensations were still perceived; and total sensory block, where the laser stimulus elicited no sensations of any type. The analgetic effects of cutaneous injections of lidocaine and topical application of EMLA (eutectic mixture of local anesthetics) cream were evaluated and compared by means of the introduced parameters. Lidocaine produced total sensory block almost immediately after injection, which was associated with the absence of cortical response to cutaneous laser stimulation. When the EMLA cream was applied for 15 minutes, both sensory and pain thresholds increased. During the next 30 minutes after removal of the cream, the thresholds increased further. The increase in analgetic effect after removal of the cream was studied using different times (15, 30, 60, 80, 100, and 120 minutes) for topical EMLA cream application. Total sensory block was reached 20 minutes after removal of application for 80 minutes or immediately after removal of the cream after it was applied for 100 or 120 minutes.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "This study was designed to test the hypothesis that beta-adrenergic receptor blockade with esmolol would decrease the hemodynamic and myocardial metabolic impairment produced by left anterior descending coronary artery (LADa) occlusion. Twenty-three anesthetized open-chest dogs underwent direct cannulation of the LADa, its companion vein (LADv), and a distal circumflex vein (CFXv) for blood sampling. All dogs were subjected to two consecutive 15-minute periods of total LADa occlusion; group 1 (n = 11) received an infusion of esmolol (150 micrograms.kg-1.min-1) during either occlusion period (randomly assigned) and group 2 (n = 12) received no intervention during either occlusion period. One hour of reperfusion was interposed between the two periods of LADa occlusion. Hemodynamic measurements were made and blood was sampled from the aorta, CFXv, LADa, and LADv before and during both periods of LADa occlusion. Without esmolol infusion, LADa occlusion was associated with decreases in stroke index, coronary perfusion pressure, and left ventricular stroke work index; with esmolol infusion these hemodynamic decrements did not occur. During both LADa occlusion periods in both groups, lactate extraction became negative, i.e., there was net lactate production. Despite this, the magnitude of lactate production was less with esmolol than without it. Finally, average endocardial-to-epicardial blood flow ratio in the LAD perfusion area was decreased during each LAD occlusion period except when esmolol was infused, during which the baseline value was maintained. Thus, infusion of esmolol during temporary LADa occlusion preserved certain hemodynamic variables, preserved the ratio of endocardial-to-epicardial blood flow, and decreased the apparent magnitude of lactate production.\r"

Based on serum potassium levels measured immediately before surgery, 57% of patients were normokalemic (greater than or equal to 3.6 mEq/L), 34% hypokalemic (3.1-3.5 mEq/L), and 9% severely hypokalemic (less than or equal to 3.0 mEq/L). No arrhythmia occurred at any time in 63% of patients and minor arrhythmias (premature atrial and occasional premature ventricular contractions) occurred in 16%. Frequent or complex ventricular ectopy appeared before and during operation in 92 patients (21%) but was not related to preoperative potassium level or history of long-term diuretic therapy. Frequent and complex ventricular arrhythmias were more common in patients with a history of long-term digoxin therapy or congestive heart failure. Even among these patients, hypokalemia or diuretic therapy did not increase the incidence or severity of ectopy. These data fail to support the common practice of delaying operation for acute potassium replacement in patients whose preoperative serum potassium is less than normal, even in the presence of cardiovascular disease.\r"

  ".W": "The systolic pressure variation (SPV), which is the difference between the maximal and minimal values of the systolic blood pressure (SBP) after one positive-pressure breath, was studied in ventilated dogs subjected to hypotension. Mean arterial pressure was decreased to 50 mm Hg for 30 minutes either by hemorrhage (HEM, n = 7) or by continuous infusion of sodium nitroprusside (SNP, n = 7). During HEM-induced hypotension the cardiac output was significantly lower and systemic vascular resistance higher compared with that in the SNP group. The systemic, central venous, pulmonary capillary wedge pressures, and heart rates, were similar in the two groups. Analysis of the respiratory changes in the arterial pressure waveform enabled differentiation between the two groups. The SPV during hypotension was 15.7 +/- 6.7 mm Hg in the HEM group, compared with 9.1 +/- 2.0 mm Hg in the SNP group (P less than 0.02). The delta down, which is the measure of decrease of SBP after a mechanical breath, was 20.3 +/- 8.4 and 10.1 +/- 3.8 mm Hg in the HEM and SNP groups, respectively, during hypotension (P less than 0.02). It is concluded that increases in the SPV and the delta down are characteristic of a hypotensive state due to a predominant decrease in preload. They are thus more important during absolute hypovolemia than during deliberate hypotension.\r"

A central venous catheter was placed using pentobarbital anesthesia, and rats were randomized to one of four groups for treatment several days later. Group 1 animals received normal saline, 3 ml/kg, given via the central venous catheter. The other three groups were administered equivalent volumes of either: crystalline etomidate (group 2), 0.4 mg/ml, in saline and 1.1% ethanol; propylene glycol (group 3), 7%, in saline; or etomidate (group 4), 0.4 mg/ml in saline with 7% propylene glycol. In the first part of this study, after an intravenous bolus of one of these four solutions, animals were immediately placed in a 200-liter chamber and received 1 h of 2% enflurane. Serum and urine were assayed for inorganic fluoride (F-) before and after anesthesia. Two hours after enflurane anesthesia, groups 1 and 2 had the highest mean peak serum F- concentrations (13.2 and 13.5 uM, respectively). Groups 3 and 4 had significantly lower mean peak serum F- concentrations (4.7 and 4.5 uM, respectively).

The preparations included the sinus node and right atrium, and, in some cases, the AV node and interventricular septum as well. Action potentials were recorded from these areas, and right atrial twitch amplitude and spontaneous rate and rhythm were monitored. Heart rate was depressed in a dose-dependent manner by both drugs, as was atrial twitch amplitude. In the absence of arrhythmias, the spontaneous rate decreased less than 30% with lidocaine up to 50 micrograms/ml, and with bupivacaine up to 5 micrograms/ml. The twitch depression reflected a potency ratio for bupivacaine (mol. wt. 288) to lidocaine (mol. wt. 234) on a mass basis of 8.1:1. The most prominent arrhythmia found was sinoatrial block, which was caused by both drugs with a potency ratio for bupivacaine to lidocaine of 15.4:1 and was reversed by 0.02 microgram/ml norepinephrine. Sinus arrhythmias, block of retrograde conduction from AV node to atrium, and irregular rhythms originating within the AV node were observed with both drugs at concentrations similar to those which produced sinoatrial block. The atrial action potential revealed decreased upstroke velocity, overshoot, and height with both lidocaine and bupivacaine, with potency ratios (bupivacaine:lidocaine) ranging from 15:1 to 26:1. In septal cells, both drugs depressed upstroke velocity, and bupivacaine lengthened action potentials by up to 14%, but lidocaine did not. The major difference between bupivacaine and lidocaine in this study was the higher potency of the former agent with respect to electrophysiologic end-points.\r"

Radiologic evaluation of the epidural space was performed to evaluate possible disc herniation or other pathologic encroachments on the epidural space. In all 40 patients, the examinations showed the posterior epidural space to be divided by the plica mediana dorsalis and an additional transverse connective tissue plane not previously described. The compartmentalized nature of the space may be, at times, responsible for entrapment and coiling of epidural catheters, despite satisfactory technical performance of catheterization for epidural anesthesia. Thirty-one of 40 patients demonstrated a greater amount of fatty tissue within the junctions of the posterior midline epidural connective tissue structures, producing a bulky triangular-shaped structure which might be an impediment to catheterization. The divisions of the anterior and posterior epidural spaces are seen to be more complex than previously described.\r"

  ".W": "The authors investigated the mechanism for slowing of heart rate (HR) and associated changes in the pulmonary hemodynamics caused by cold injectate during thermodilution method. To clarify whether the slowing of HR after cold injectate is due to the cooling of the sinoatrial (SA) node or a reflex mediated by the autonomic nerves, we directly measured the myocardial temperature of the SA node region by a thermistor probe, and evaluated the HR responses to iced injectate after autonomic blockade in anesthetized dogs. Additionally, pulmonary blood flow (PBF) was continuously measured by an electromagnetic flowmeter during the delivery of injectate. The direction and magnitude of changes in HR after injectate were significantly dependent upon the injectate temperature (P less than 0.01). Thereby, the changes in HR correlated well with those in myocardial temperature of the SA node region (r = 0.987, P less than 0.01). However, the HR responses to injectate were unaffected by cervical vagotomy or stellate ganglionectomy. A significant decrease in PBF was noted in most cases during the slowing of HR. It was concluded that the slowing of HR after cold injectate during thermodilution in dogs is primarily due to the direct cooling of the SA node.\r"

  ".W": "To assess the dose-response effects of isoflurane and halothane anesthesia on hemodynamics and coronary artery reactivity, the authors studied myocardial hyperemic responses following brief single artery flow arrests in 21 open chest, isocapnic swine in which arterial blood pressures and cardiac outputs were recorded. A specially designed Doppler probe was used to measure the peak and time course of coronary blood flow velocity in the left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) after 15-s LAD occlusions. The ratio of peak velocity of blood flow to resting velocity (coronary reserve), relative repayment of flow debt, and duration of hyperemic responses were studied. Surgery was performed at MAC end-tidal concentrations ([Et]isoflurane = 1.45%. [Et]halothane = 1.25%) of isoflurane (n = 7) or halothane (n = 7), and recordings were made after 15-min steady state [Et]agent at 0.5, 1, 1.25, 1.5, 1.75, 2 MAC, and further 0.5 MAC increments until the demise of each animal. To compare coronary reactivity at similar coronary pressures, an aortic snare was used to elevate arterial pressures in a third group of halothane anesthesized pigs (n = 7) to those in the previously studied isoflurane group at each MAC level. There were three major differences between halothane and isoflurane. First, cardiac depression (reduction in arterial pressure, cardiac output, and stroke volume) was less with isoflurane compared with halothane anesthesia. Second, with halothane anesthesia, there was a marked decrease in coronary reactivity independent of coronary perfusion pressures with marked, dose-dependent reductions in both coronary reserve and relative flow repayment. During isoflurane anesthesia, coronary reactivity and coronary reserve was well preserved within physiologic limits up to 1.75 MAC [Et]. Third, halothane anesthesized pigs died in cardiac collapse at much lower agent concentrations than with isoflurane (no animals survived 1.75 MAC halothane, whereas all animals survived 2.5 MAC isoflurane). Therefore, pigs anesthesized with isoflurane had greater coronary reserve, better preserved cardiac function, and greater tolerance to increasing agent concentration than pigs anesthesized with halothane.\r"

  ".W": "The pharmacokinetic behavior of intravenous anesthetic drugs can be described by two- or three-compartment models. Rapid achievement and maintenance of steady plasma concentrations of these drugs requires a complicated delivery scheme, perhaps best controlled by a computer. The authors developed a method of simulating the performance of a computer-controlled infusion pump from the differential equations describing drug transfer between compartments. They also derived a mathematically simple and flexible approximate solution to these equations using Euler's numerical method. They incorporated this approximate solution into a computer-controlled infusion pump for intravenous drugs. They tested their pump by simulating the administration of fentanyl to a hypothetical patient whose fentanyl pharmacokinetics were described by a three-compartment model. The exact analytical solution served as the standard of comparison. The approximation technique, using a 15-s interval between model updates, had a maximum error of 0.35 ng.ml-1, and rapidly converged on the exact solution. The simulations revealed oscillations in the system. The authors suggest that such simulations be used to evaluate computer-controlled infusion pumps prior to clinical trials of these devices.\r"

The mean age was 71.7 years, ranging from thirty-six to eighty-four years; 55.9% were males. The subsequent follow-up study revealed that the status of 44.1% of the patients with underlying arterial insufficiency deteriorated. Eventually, they underwent vascular surgery for limb-threatening ischemia. From this study, the analysis of the parameters could predict the clinical outcome of intermittent claudication at the time of initial and follow-up evaluation. During initial evaluation, when the ankle brachial index (ABI) was higher than 0.7 or when follow-up evaluation did not show a decrease of ABI by 0.15, the chance of favorable outcome was increased by 2.4 and 1.6 times respectively. When the ABI was less than 0.5 at the initial evaluation and decreased 0.15 or more during follow-up studies, the risk of requiring vascular surgery for limb salvage increased by 3.8 and 1.9 times, respectively. The onset of major vascular events in other areas appeared to influence the time of significant deterioration in the lower limb arterial disease, indicating multifactorial and systemic contribution in the natural history of intermittent claudication. In this homogeneous patient population with arterial insufficiency referred to the vascular surgeon, conservative management with strong supervision for smoking cessation, exercise, diet control, body weight reduction, and medical regimen can modify the natural course of intermittent claudication and associated vascular problems.\r"

Statistically significant differences between groups A and B were as follows: the incidence of rest angina (50.6% vs 85.7%; p less than 0.01) and mixed angina (32.5% vs 5.7%; p less than 0.01); the appearance of ST segment depression (53.3% vs 16%; p less than 0.01) and no electrocardiographic changes during stress test (35.6% vs 76%; p less than 0.01); and the tendency for arteriographically documented spasm to be focal (87.5% vs 71.4%; p less than 0.05) and to affect only one vessel (76.6% vs 57.1%; p less than 0.05). No differences were found between groups A and B in major coronary risk factors, history of previous myocardial infarction, electrocardiographic abnormalities at rest or during pain episodes, or arteries affected by spasm. Thus, angina appearing exclusively at rest is the main clinical feature of spasm of normal coronary arteries. The electrocardiogram, whether at rest or during pain episodes, has no value for predicting the existence of underlying coronary lesions, whereas stress testing does. Spasm of normal arteries tends to be more diffuse than that superimposed on organic lesions and to affect more than one artery, suggesting different mechanisms in the genesis of both types of spasm.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of acute (single-dose) and chronic (26-day) therapy with nitrendipine on renal function were evaluated in 10 patients with mild to moderate hypertension. The patients were studied during three phases: for one week while on a constant diet containing 100 mEq of sodium and 80 mEq of potassium daily and receiving placebo, after administration of a single 20-mg oral dose of nitrendipine, and during one week of treatment with nitrendipine at 10 mg twice daily. After two weeks of outpatient treatment at 10 or 20 mg twice daily, the patients were readmitted and reevaluated while on controlled diets. Isotopic determinations of glomerular filtration rate, effective renal blood flow, blood volume, and cardiac output were made during each phase, and free water clearance and osmolar clearance following a water load were measured; during the periods of hospitalization, 24-hour urinary creatinine and electrolyte excretion were assessed. A significant decrease in blood pressure occurred during both the acute and chronic phases as compared with the placebo phase. During the first week of treatment with nitrendipine, a significant increase in urinary sodium excretion over control values was observed, with a mean deficit of 148 +/- 7 mEq (p less than 0.001); a mean weight loss of 1.0 +/- 0.1 kg during this period was also significant (p less than 0.05). No substantial changes in glomerular filtration rate, renal blood flow, blood volume, cardiac output, plasma renin activity, and levels of plasma catecholamines or urinary aldosterone from control values were noted during either the acute or chronic phases.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Nitrendipine is a new dihydropyridine derivative developed specifically for the treatment of hypertension. Oral nitrendipine was administered to twelve patients with severe hypertension (diastolic blood pressure greater than 114 mm/Hg). All antihypertensive drugs were discontinued at least 72 hours prior to nitrendipine administration. The initial dose of nitrendipine was 5 mgs. orally twice daily which was titrated at 2 to 5 day intervals up to a maximum dose of 40 mgs. twice a day. Average pretreatment blood pressure (+/- SD) was 194/118 (28/3) mm/Hg and was 191/122 (25/9) mm/Hg standing. After 7 to 10 days of nitrendipine monotherapy, the average blood pressure had decreased to 170/102 (20/9) mm/Hg supine and 167/106 (19/8) mm/Hg standing. Thirty days of nitrendipine therapy resulted in a further decrease of average blood pressure to 159/96 (18/7) mm/Hg supine and 154/99 (12/12) mm/Hg standing. Average supine pulse (+/- SD) increased from 79.0 (13.9) to 90 (15.7) beats/min. after 7-10 days and to 82 (17) beats/min. after 30 days of therapy. The average total daily dose of nitrendipine was 47.5 mgs. after 30 days. Side effects were minimal and the medication was well tolerated by most patients. It was concluded that nitrendipine is a potent and effective antihypertensive agent in patients with severe hypertension.\r"

This method is so simple, painless, and effortless with high reproducibility that it is possible to use the technique on children as young as 2 years old. Consequently, we used this method to study bronchial hyperresponsiveness in 141 children with asthma and 46 disease controls without asthma or chronic respiratory disorder. The bronchial responsiveness in asthmatic children aged 2 to 5 years was higher than in the disease controls (P less than .001). Further, bronchial responsiveness was significantly higher in moderately as opposed to minimally affected asthmatics (P less than .01), and was gradually higher according to clinical severity. In other age groups as well, the bronchial responsiveness of asthmatic children was higher than of disease controls. There was a close relationship between the level of increased bronchial responsiveness and the clinical severity of asthmatic children.\r"

Sixty-six individuals underwent a methacholine challenge, an UNDW challenge, and were administered a standardized respiratory disease questionnaire. To perform the UNDW challenge, subjects inhaled increasing volumes of nebulized distilled water while breathing tidally. Thirty-eight asthmatics, two former asthmatics, 14 normal, and 12 allergic subjects, were included. Sixty-six percent of the asthmatics dropped 20% from their baseline FEV1 during the UNDW challenge. Only one allergic or normal subject had a similar drop. The Pearson's correlation coefficient between methacholine and UNDW challenges was 0.60. If positive, an UNDW seems to be highly specific in supporting a diagnosis of asthma, while methacholine challenges are more useful in verifying the presence of non-specific bronchial reactivity.\r"

Six animals received no antibiotics, while the remainder were treated with a variety of prophylactic regimens of intravenous and topical agents. Bacterial contamination at each culture site was expressed as a \"bacterial index\" (BI), obtained as the sum of the logarithmic concentrations of individual species. In the absence of antibiotics, pneumonias occurred in all animals and were polymicrobial; 56% of organisms in lung tissue were members of the normal upper respiratory tract flora, while 44% were gram-negative bacilli with a mean total bacterial index of 13.94/g. Lobar tissue BI values greater than 6.0/g were found in 77% of lobes containing pneumonias judged by histologic criteria to be moderate or severe in extent, whereas only 7% of lobes with lesser inflammatory changes had similar BI values. The BI values of BAL were linearly related to tissue values, whether the BAL was performed of the same lobe cultured or a different lobe. BAL recovered 74% of all species present in lung tissue compared to 41% by PSB and 56% for needle aspirates. False positive specimens were found with similar frequency with these 3 procedures. Tracheal aspirates revealed 78% of organisms found in lung tissue, but 14 of 35 (40%) of species isolated were not present in lung tissue. BAL provides the best reflection of the lung's bacterial burden, both quantitatively and qualitatively, in the setting of prolonged intubation and ventilation.\r"

In 12 animals receiving no antibiotics, only topical application of polymyxin B (PB), or only intravenous penicillin and gentamicin (IV PCN/GM), moderate or severe pneumonia was found in 81% of lobes examined at necropsy; no lobes were sterile. Pneumonias were polymicrobial in the absence of antibiotics, due to PCN-sensitive organisms in the topical PB group, and due to gram-negative bacilli in the IV PCN/GM group. Combinations of topical PB or GM or both plus IV PCN were highly efficacious in preventing pneumonia in 23 animals as only 15% of the lobes contained moderate to severe pneumonia and 52% of lobes were sterile. In these groups, histologically evident pneumonias were associated with low concentrations of bacteria in lung tissue, principally gram-negative bacilli resistant to the topical agent being used. Resistance to PB appeared to be solely due to selection of intrinsically resistant species, whereas resistance to GM may have developed through additional mechanisms as well. Although this approach to pneumonia prevention is clearly efficacious in this animal model, clinical studies are needed to define the frequency and significance of microbial resistance in human subjects.\r"

In addition, the validity of the measurement of Vtg at FRC in children at a low panting frequency (Vtgpant) was also determined. During both the panting (encouraged to be about 1 Hz) and inspiratory maneuvers, mouth pressure (Pm) and esophageal pressure (Pes) were measured simultaneously. Hence, Vtgpant and Vtginsp were determined using both delta Pm and delta Pes. Vtginsp using delta Pm was found to be similar to Vtginsp using delta Pes. Values for Vtgpant using either delta Pm or delta Pes were also found to be similar. The percent difference between Vtginsp (using delta Pm) and the average of Vtgpant and Vtginsp (using delta Pes for both) was calculated as an indication of the error of the inspiratory method. The error ranged from -13 to +13% and did not correlate with indices of air-flow limitation or hyperinflation. We have found that Vtginsp can be used to determine FRC in normal children and young adults as well as in those with CF or asthma. In addition, we have also validated the use of Vtgpant at a low panting frequency in these subjects.\r"

The method entailed submitting the subject to very slow sinusoidal variations of ambient pressure (delta Pam) and studying the relationship between delta Pam and the resulting gas displacement at the mouth (delta Vaw): Vtgapc = PB.delta Vaw/delta Pam.cos phi, where PB is barometric minus alveolar water vapor pressure, and phi is the phase angle between Pam and Vaw. delta Pam of 40 cm H2O at 0.05 Hz were achieved by placing the subject in a 410-I body chamber connected to a large stroke volume reciprocating pump. Pam and Vaw were processed digitally by Fourier transform to obtain their amplitude ratio and phase angle at the frequency of interest. Vtg was also measured by body plethysmography (Vtgplet) during slow panting maneuvers (0.79 +/- 0.19 Hz) and also in order to detect any artifactual frequency dependence at a higher panting frequency (1.71 +/- 0.27 Hz); the agreement between the 2 estimates in all subjects (r = 0.975) suggested that Vtgplet could be taken as a valid reference. Functional residual capacities derived from Vtgapc and Vtgplet were not significantly different (5.113 +/- 1.198 versus 5.260 +/- 1.328 L) and were highly correlated (r = 0.915). Intermethod differences averaged 1.7 +/- 10.5% and were not significantly correlated to functional indices. We conclude that the new method provides accurate Vtg values in patients with chronic airway obstruction.\r"

  ".W": "Data from a random sample of 8,191 men and women from 6 U.S. cities are used to fit a model describing the effects of cumulative and current cigarette smoking on pulmonary function. The data show that smokers suffer an irreversible loss of FVC and FEV1, which is described by a linear function of their cumulative cigarette smoking as measured in pack-years. For a typical male 173 cm tall, the estimated loss of FEV1 is 7.4 ml for each pack-year smoked. For a typical woman, 161 cm tall, the estimated effect is 4.4 ml per pack-year. Current cigarette smoking adds an acute deficit over and above the cumulative effect of lifetime smoking. For any lifetime pack-years, exsmokers have higher levels of FEV1, 123 ml for a typical man, 107 ml for a typical woman, than do current smokers of a pack per day (p less than 0.001). A man who starts smoking one pack of cigarettes per day at 25 yr of age would at age 60, after 35 pack-years of exposure, have an expected FEV1 equal to that of a man 69.4 yr of age who had never smoked. If he stopped smoking at 60 yr of age, his expected level would increase to that of a 66.5-yr-old never-smoker. This model therefore estimates how much lung function is irreversibly lost by smoking, estimates how much could be regained with cessation of smoking, and predicts the future loss of lung function in both cases.\r"

The analyses are based on 734 subjects tested from 3 to 5 times over the follow-up period; 82 smokers developed an abnormal FEV1 during the follow-up period. Of these, 71 (87%) had had an abnormal single-breath N2 test at some time prior to the FEV1 becoming abnormal. Of the single-breath N2 test variables, CC/TLC was the only one significantly associated with the rate of decline of FEV1 in both cohorts once adjustments were made for age, sex, height, and smoking. We conclude that the single-breath N2 test can be useful in identifying the smoker who is at risk of developing chronic airflow limitation. However, its usefulness is diminished by the high proportion of smokers who have mild functional abnormalities but do not progress to develop chronic airflow limitation. We also find that the single-breath N2 test does not appear to have a useful predictive value in nonsmokers.\r"

There were 72 whites, 15 blacks, 3 Asians, and 1 Hispanic in the study group. Multiple regression analyses indicated that the O3 concentration in the previous hour, the cumulative daily O3 exposure during the hours between 9 A.M. and the function measurement, ambient temperature, and humidity were the most explanatory environmental variables for daily variations in function, with the 1 - h O3 concentration having the strongest influence. Linear regressions were performed for each child between O3 concentration and function, and all average slopes were significantly negative (p less than 0.05) for FVC, FEV1, PEFR, and FEF25-75 for all children, and for boys and girls separately. Comparable results were obtained in data subsets (i.e., children studied during the first or second 2 wk only, and for data sets truncated at O3 less than 80 and O3 less than 60 ppb). The average regression slopes (+/- SE) for FVC and FEV1, respectively, were -1.03 +/- 0.24 and -1.42 +/- 0.17 ml/ppb, whereas for PEFR and FEF25-75 they were -6.78 +/- 0.73 and -2.48 +/- 0.26 ml/s/ppb.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Ethane production rates in groups of 8 rats increased during 8 h of 100% oxygen exposure from a mean (+/- SE) room air value of 11.30 +/- 1.15 to 27.85 +/- 2.93 pmol/min/100 g rat (p less than 0.005). The mean (+/- SE) percent increases in ethane production after exposure to 100% oxygen in 8 rats pretreated with 0.1 mg/100 g of vitamin E in corn oil vehicle (0.1 ml/100 g) injected intraperitoneally and in a group of 5 rats injected with vehicle alone averaged 157.16 +/- 37.83% and 150.98 +/- 25.19%, respectively. The percent changes noted were not significantly different as measured by analysis of variance. These data indicate that lipid peroxidative activity, hence oxygen-free radical activity, increases in normally fed rats exposed to hyperoxia at a time prior to the previously reported neutrophil influx into the lungs of similarly exposed rats and that it is not attenuated by pretreatment with vitamin E.\r"

Dexamethasone (10(-5) to 10(-9) M) added to culture medium for 24 h caused a dose-related reversible inhibition of RCG of as much as 40% with a peak effect at 24 to 60 h after initiation of dexamethasone treatment. A monoclonal antilipocortin antibody added to the cultures blocked the inhibitory effect of dexamethasone on RGC secretion and accelerated the reversal of the dexamethasone effect after discontinuation of dexamethasone treatment. A control antibody without antilipocortin activity had no effect on RGC secretion or dexamethasone-induced inhibition of RGC secretion. Measurement of the concentration of lipocortin in airways revealed a 220% increase after treatment with dexamethasone for 24 h. We conclude that dexamethasone inhibits RGC secretion through the induction of lipocortin synthesis.\r"

Dust mite antigen content was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) specific for the major allergens of Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus, D. farinae, and D. microceras. Cat and dog antigen content were determined by ELISA using antisera for Fel d 1 (formerly cat allergen 1) and dog allergens 3 and 13, respectively. Mold content was assessed by culture with microscopic identification. Dust mite antigen was detected in 99% of homes (D. farinae, 95%; D. pteronyssinus, 88%; D. microceras, 31%), with total antigen content ranging from 50 ng/g dust (the lower limit of detection) to 30,170 ng/g (median, 1,123 ng/g). Animal allergens were found in 100% of samples (cat: range, 2 to 130,000 ng Fel d 1/g; median, 90 ng/g; dog: range, 112.5 to 585,000 IU/g; median, 2,719.5 IU/g). Although there were highly significant differences in antigen content (p less than 0.001) between homes with and without a particular pet in residence, many homes without pets contained pet allergens at high concentrations. Molds were also detected in 100% of homes (range, 4 to 761 colonies/30 mg dust; median, 72 colonies/30 mg). No correlation was demonstrated between antigen content and skin test results, a history of asthma, symptoms on allergen exposure, or the age of the home (except for molds) for any of the allergens detected. We conclude that dust mite allergens, cat and dog allergens, and molds are virtually ubiquitous in Baltimore homes and that our ability to predict the presence and relative quantities of these allergens on clinical grounds is very limited.\r"

Emphysema development was assessed by histologic evaluation and by changes in lung volume and mean linear intercept values. Evidence of pathologic changes were also documented by clinical and radiographic findings of osteolathyrism. The induction of centriacinar emphysema was attributed specifically to NO2 exposure. Neither the severity of the emphysema nor the time course of its development was altered by the beta APN-supplemented diet. These findings are in marked contrast to those observed with the exogenous elastase model of the disease, and they suggest that elastin synthesis and repair may not modulate elastin destruction in the NO2 model of emphysema.\r"

In 28 of these patients, a preoperative computer tomography (CT) scan, at 6 and 10 cm below the sternal notch, was used to generate frequency histograms of CT numbers (measured as EMI units), a measure of lung density, in pixels from the lung or lobe that was subsequently resected. A similar CT number histogram was also derived from the lateral two fifths of the area of lobe/lung that was to be resected. The EMI unit that defined the lowest fifth percentile of this latter histogram correlated (n = 28, r = -0.77, p less than 0.001) with the mean value of the surface area of the walls of distal airspaces per unit lung volume (AWUV) in the five 1 mm x 1 mm microscopic fields with the lowest AWUV values, out of the 20 to 35 such fields examined in each patient. In the 34 of the 45 patients in whom we also measured volume-corrected diffusing capacity (DLCO/VA), this also correlated (n = 34, r = 0.84, p less than 0.001) with this value of AWUV, which measures the surface area of airspaces distal to the terminal bronchioles--reflecting an increase in airspace size, a defining characteristic of emphysema. However, a low DLCO/VA is nonspecific, whereas an abnormally low regional lung density is more likely to be specific for emphysema. In addition, highlighting those pixels of the CT display with low CT numbers (i.e., EMI units -500 [air] to -450, where zero = water) can locate areas of macroscopic emphysema, as shown by subsequent pathologic examination. Thus the quantitative CT scan can diagnose, quantitate, and locate mild to moderate emphysema, in humans, in life, noninvasively.\r"

  ".W": "Central hypoventilation syndrome (CHS) is a disorder of respiratory control. It may be an idiopathic primary disease or it may be the secondary consequence of an infectious process or Chiari II malformation. Clinical data suggest that the primary defect involves the brainstem respiratory centers. To date, pathologic evaluation has linked primary CHS with decreased density of neurons and myelinated nerve fibers in the medulla and brainstem gliosis, and absence of the external arcuate nucleus. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is now considered the most reliable imaging technique for evaluating the brainstem. In the hope of finding gross structural abnormalities that might correlate with the clinical and pathologic features of CHS, we used MRI and computerized tomography (CT) to evaluate the brain, brainstem, and spinal cord of 17 infants and children with central hypoventilation (11 primary, 6 secondary). Each of the 11 children with primary CHS demonstrated a normal brainstem and spinal cord by MRI. However, 9 of 11 infants had mild ventricular dilatation and modest prominence of the sulci interpreted as either mild atrophy or mild extraventricular obstructive hydrocephalus. Results of studies in the one child with postinfectious disease were normal. The 5 infants with Chiari II malformation demonstrated characteristic brainstem changes. MRI results modified clinical care, resulting in symptomatic improvement after hindbrain decompression by cervical laminectomy in 1 infant and surgical drainage of syringobulbia in 1 child. In summary, in primary CHS, the MRI and CT provided evidence for a more diffuse CNS process rather than a specific brainstem lesion. Such a lesion may be too small or too subtle to resolve with MRI or CT. In secondary central hypoventilation, MRI modified surgical management in 2 cases, resulting in symptomatic improvement of hypoventilation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Recent evidence indicates that human alveolar macrophages can degrade purified elastin in vitro by a cell contact-dependent process involving acidic proteinases of the cysteine proteinase class. It is unclear to what extent these cells can degrade elastin within a natural extracellular matrix. To address this question, we cultured live human alveolar macrophages on elastin-rich, 3H-lysine-labeled, extracellular matrices deposited by rat smooth muscle cells in vitro. Under various culture conditions, we then measured release of total radioactivity from the matrices during co-culture with cells as well as net loss of desmosine/isodesmosine as a specific marker of elastin degradation. Live macrophages adhered to and progressively solubilized matrix protein at a slow rate (approximately 5 micrograms/10(6) cells/24 h) but the rate of solubilization increased more than 15-fold in the presence of plasminogen. The elastin component of the complicated matrix was not measurably degraded in the absence of plasminogen, but in medium containing plasminogen, 3.5 X 10(6) macrophages degraded 25 +/- 8 micrograms of elastin in 72 h. After pretreatment of matrices with trypsin to remove glycoprotein elements, live cells degraded 16 +/- 4 micrograms of elastin under plasminogen-free conditions. The addition of serum to the medium (1 to 5%) inhibited degradation of elastin within whole matrices (approximately 50% compared to serum-free medium containing plasminogen) but had no effect on degradation of elastin in trypsin-pretreated matrices. An active site inhibitor of cysteine proteinases, Z-phenylalanine-phenylalanine-diazomethylketone, blocked approximately 50% of the elastin degradation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Airway obstruction persisted unabated throughout the postexposure period, with significant reductions in maximal expiratory flows. Pulmonary resistance, the slope of phase III, and the volume of isoflow were increased. Hyperresponsiveness to histamine developed between 3 and 5 months. Histologically, there was minimal damage to the cartilaginous airways. Widespread chronic inflammation with minimal fibrosis was seen in the membranous bronchi and respiratory bronchioles. Pathology scores for cartilaginous and noncartilaginous (small) airways were developed and correlated with tests of airway function. Small airways pathology scores correlated with flows at 50 and 25% of the vital capacity and with pulmonary resistance. Density dependence of maximal expiratory flow, closing volume, and closing capacity failed to correlate with either the airway obstruction or the small airways pathology scores.\r"

  ".W": "Epithelial injury and inflammation have been implicated in ozone-induced airway hyperresponsiveness. Because ozone is relatively insoluble and highly reactive, toxicologic effects of this compound may be limited to the plasma membranes of airway epithelium. We hypothesize that oxidant damage to epithelium may result in elaboration of various eicosanoids, which are known to alter airway smooth muscle responsiveness and epithelial cell functions (including ion transport). To examine eicosanoid metabolism after exposure to 0.1 to 10.0 ppm ozone, epithelial cells derived from bovine trachea were isolated and grown to confluency. Bovine tracheal cells in culture expressed differentiated features characteristic of epithelial cells, including a plasma membrane with a specialized polar morphology, an extensive network of filaments that were connected through intercellular junctional complexes, and keratin-containing monofilaments as determined by indirect immunofluorescent localization. Monolayers were alternately exposed to ozone and culture medium for 2 h in a specially designed in vitro chamber using a rotating inclined platform. Eicosanoid products were measured by the release of [3H]-labeled products from cells incubated with [3H]-arachidonic acid for 24 h before exposure and by the release of immunoreactive products into the cell supernatant. Both methods revealed ozone-induced increases in cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase product formation with significant increases in prostaglandins E2, F2 alpha, 6-keto F1 alpha, and leukotriene B4. Release rates of immunoreactive products were dose-dependent, and ozone concentrations as low as 0.1 ppm produced an increase in prostaglandin F2 alpha. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that ozone can augment eicosanoid metabolism in airway epithelial cells.\r"

  ".W": "To evaluate the evolution of airway epithelial damage in premature infants developing bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), a detailed quantitative light and electron microscopic evaluation was performed of the major airways in 3 infants who succumbed from respiratory failure. The 3 infants ranged from 24 to 28 wk gestational age and died after 14 h, 10 days, and 6 months of life. The tracheal epithelium was severely damaged with up to half of the epithelium being denuded in each infant. The infants who died after 14 h and after 10 days demonstrated minimal epithelial denudation in more distal bronchial divisions. However, gross and microscopic abnormalities of the ciliated component of the epithelium were common. In the infant with severe established BPD, there was extensive epithelial denudation and ciliary abnormalities out to the fourth bronchial division. The percentage of goblet cells in the total cell population decreased from proximal to distal major airways, with the lowest percentage being seen in the infant with established BPD. These studies demonstrate the respiratory failure and assisted ventilation in the human neonate is associated with severe epithelial damage in the trachea and proximal bronchi. It suggests that the difficulty in clearing airway secretion results from a defect in mucociliary transport system rather than from an increase in airway secretion.\r"

The acute myopathy can occur with several parenteral corticosteroids, may be severe (with rhabdomyolysis and myoglobinuria), and may have protracted morbidity. Prospective follow-up allowed demonstration of histopathology, electrophysiology, and also the contribution of various pharmacologic agents. Careful analysis of the evidence strongly implicates corticosteroids as the causative agent.\r"

We also quantitated radiographic density in 6 areas of the film in each subject. There was no radiographic change to suggest an increase in lung water in any lung zone in any of the subjects. Given the documented sensitivity of chest radiography in this respect, we conclude that any increase in extravascular lung water during exercise must be trivial.\r"

To evaluate the role of ablative laser therapy in palliation, we reviewed our experience with 30 consecutive patients who presented with symptoms of obstruction, bleeding, or pain from unresectable tumors of the esophagus (20), Stomach (4), or rectum (6). Overall, 97 laser treatments were administered endoscopically with a Neodymium Yttrium Aluminum Garnet (Nd:YAG) laser using average energy per treatment of 4525 joules. Forty per cent of the patients received their therapy as outpatients and all were given only light intravenous sedation. The symptomatic response was good to excellent in 70 per cent of patients but five (16.7%) subsequently developed recurrences requiring further laser ablation. Performance status was improved in 19 of 20 patients with esophageal cancer. Few of the gastric or colorectal cancer patients noted changes in performance status since concomitant medical illnesses often limited their overall function. There was one mortality within 30 days from esophageal tumor cachexia and two patients experienced moderately severe visceral pain. No perforation or fistulizations occurred. This experience confirms that a Nd:YAG laser photo-ablation is safe and effective when palliation is indicated for advanced cancers of the gastrointestinal tract.\r"

Gross and microscopic examination of treated sites at 1-60 days showed ischemic necrosis of mucosa and submucosa (24 hours), acute inflammation, demarcation of viable and necrotic tissue, and appearance of granulation tissue (3-7 days), full thickness replacement of mucosa and submucosa with maturing scar tissue and near complete re-epithelialization (14-21 days), and complete healing (50-60 days). Inflammation and scar tissue deposition consistently obliterated submucosal venous channels but left muscularis propria intact. No perforations or other adverse clinical or histological effects were observed.

In a pilot project, we measured gastric-acid secretion, gastrin and cholecystokinin (CCK) levels in ten patients before and during balloon therapy in a study of the impact of the balloon on gastric physiology. Gastric-acid secretion tended to decrease following balloon treatment, while gastrin and CCK levels were unchanged suggesting that weight loss is achieved by mechanisms, which are not mediated by gastrin or CCK. The balloon program was then expanded to a group of 29 patients who met the criteria. They were followed for a period of 4 months. Average weight loss for the group was 31 +/- 4 pounds for a monthly average of 8 pounds. The main complications were gastric ulcers in four patients and a small-bowel obstruction in one patient. Satisfactory weight loss was achieved in 80 per cent of patients, but this benefit must be balanced against a relatively high incidence (17%) of side effects, some of which were quite serious. Therefore, the gastric balloon program should still be considered experimental.\r"

  ".W": "The incidence of synchronous polyps of the colon has been shown to be 25 to 40 per cent and the incidence of synchronous carcinomas to be two to eight per cent. Because of this, many surgical groups now advocate routine preoperative colonoscopy on all patients with colon carcinoma. The possibility of spreading and implanting tumor cells with the colonoscope has prompted the authors to purposely avoid preoperative colonoscopy and then clear the colon of any missed lesions with an early postoperative colonoscopy. This study is a retrospective review of 104 patients who have undergone a partial colectomy for colon and rectal carcinoma followed by a postoperative colonoscopy between June 1982 and June 1986. The purpose is to determine the adequacy of intraoperative palpation to detect synchronous neoplasms, and to further define the role of perioperative colonoscopy. The results of 34 per cent synchronous polyps and 5.8 per cent synchronous carcinomas parallels previous studies. The six patients with synchronous carcinomas were discovered by intraoperative palpation and the operation was modified in four of the six patients. Postoperative colonoscopy revealed polyps in 20 per cent of the patients, but all of these were amenable to snare polypectomy or electrocoagulation. No carcinomas were overlooked by palpation. It is our conclusion that intraoperative palpation is adequate for detection of synchronous carcinomas and therefore the risk and expense of preoperative colonoscopy can be avoided. Early postoperative colonoscopy, however, is imperative to clear the colon of small polyps which have the potential to progress to carcinoma.\r"

The technique was validated in the laboratory by performing endoscopic measurement of gastric mucosal blood flow in the dog simultaneously with application of a second probe at open operation, utilizing the same laser Doppler flowmeter. Probe pressure causing minor dimpling (less than 20 gm/cm2) was found to cause insignificant alteration of mucosal blood flow. Criteria were developed to aid separation of artifacts introduced by probe motion. A conversion factor was established for converting the readout of the instrument (Hertz x 10(2] into ml/100g/min by synchronously measuring mucosal blood flow by hydrogen gas clearance technique and laser Doppler velocimetry in the gastric and duodenal mucosa. In patients with portal hypertension gastric mucosal blood flow was determined before and after sclerotherapy, and compared to the gastric mucosal blood flow in subjects without portal hypertension. Gastric mucosal blood flow was elevated in portal hypertensives, but sclerotherapy did not appear to cause changes in blood flow. Endoscopic mucosal blood flow measurement is non-invasive, practical and of potential value in clinical investigation of gastrointestinal pathophysiology.\r"

The arterial and venous blood supply to a 20 cm segment of distal jejunum in mongrel dogs was isolated and the bowel divided. External and endoscopic photography and intestinal biopsies were obtained at 0, 5, 15, 30, 60, 120, 180 and 360 minutes after vascular occlusion. Arterial occlusion was characterized by initial blanching of the mucosa, hyperperistalsis, edema, spasm and serosal pallor within 5 minutes. Microscopically, capillaries became congested at 5 minutes; epithelial sloughing occurred in 1-2 hours; necrosis of the tips of the villi occurred at 4 hours; and necrosis of muscle fibers was observed at 18 hours. Venous occlusion was characterized by marked mucosal and edema and hemorrhages within 5 minutes. At 15 minutes serosal hemorrhages were observed. Mucosal sloughing with hemorrhage and infarction were observed at 3 hours. Microscopically, mucosal capillary congestion was severe at 5 minutes and widespread hemorrhages were seen at 15 minutes. Mucosal sloughing began at 30 minutes and was severe by 60 minutes. Complete mucosal necrosis occurred by 3 hours. Combined arterial and venous occlusion was similar to arterial occlusion alone except for the early appearance of punctate mucosal hemorrhages. Massive submucosal hemorrhages did not occur. Results demonstrate that arterial and venous occlusion can be differentiated endoscopically; venous occlusion appears to be more readily injurious; and endoscopy and biopsy are valuable in diagnosis and management.\r"

In 2 years, three video endoscope systems have emerged to develop the field of digital imaging. In order to accurately assess the rapidly changing technology, these state of the art systems were \"bench\" tested in an electronics laboratory to objectively compare resolution, brightness (luminosity), color intensity (chroma), and field of view. All systems were excellent, surpassing the professional broadcasting minimum standards for the adequate discrimination of objects and colors. The Welch Allyn Video-Endoscope originated video endoscopy continued to demonstrate a superior resolution; however this was at the expense of a significantly more narrow field of view, relative to the two newer systems. Although all systems have adequate luminosity and chroma, there were differences in the maximum amounts of luminosity and chroma. This is reflected in the observation that the most recently introduced system, Olympus Endoscopic Video Information System had relatively low levels of light beyond 9 cm from the tip, while the other systems had ample illumination. This report on the relative advantages of each system is based on the interpretations, implications, and practical applications of these findings.\r"

The purpose of the study was to assess the potential endoscopic application of the Nd-YAG contact probe in cystogastrostomy for the treatment of selected patients with pancreatic pseudocyst. Seven dogs were used in the study. In the first two dogs, full-thickness linear incisions through the gastric wall demonstrated the Nd-YAG contact probe could be used for a full-thickness gastrostomy dissection. In the other five dogs, gastric ulcers were created by injection of morrhuate sodium (5%). Gastric mucosal dissection with the Nd-YAG contact probe was performed without difficulty. Hemostasis was obtained with either the Nd-YAG contact probe or noncontact fiber, and all areas of dissection and ulcer beds healed within 35 days. The Nd-YAG laser contact endoscopic delivery system appears to be a promising technique for intraluminal dissection.\r"

The two groups had similar clinical characteristics, treadmill test results, and extent of infarction and ischemia, but only 14 [corrected] patients with diabetes compared with 34 [corrected] patients without diabetes had angina during exertional ischemia. In diabetic patients the extent of retinopathy, nephropathy, or peripheral neuropathy was similar in patients with and without angina.

Thirty-eight percent of employees studied had antibody levels less than 10 mIU/mL. Low levels were associated with smoking, older age, and higher body-mass index. Seventy-eight percent of persons with low antibody levels responded to a single booster vaccine. Two micrograms of intradermal vaccine was as effective as 20 micrograms of intramuscular vaccine in inducing an antibody response; however, intradermal vaccine was associated with more local reactions (42% compared with 17%). Many healthy adults will need periodic boosters of hepatitis B vaccine to maintain production of antibody to hepatitis B surface antigen; low-dose intradermal booster schedules may be feasible.\r"

Design: Random plasma or serum samples for determining of antibodies to vasopressin were collected from patients and controls. Setting: Referral university hospital with most patients studied in the clinical research center. Patients: Twenty-nine healthy controls and 113 patients with polyuria (15 with primary polydipsia; 86 with neurogenic diabetes insipidus [60 studied before, 28 during, and 10 after antidiuretic hormone treatment]; and 12 with nephrogenic diabetes insipidus). Interventions: Antibodies were detected by incubating samples with radiolabeled 125I-arginine vasopressin. The effect of antibodies on diagnosis was studied by examining the relation of plasma vasopressin to osmolality measured during dehydration or infusion of hypertonic saline and the relation of urine osmolality to plasma vasopressin measured during dehydration. Measurements and Main Results: Antibodies to vasopressin were not detected in patients with primary polydipsia, nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, or neurogenic diabetes insipidus studied before therapy with antidiuretic hormone. Antibodies were detected in 6 of 28 patients studied during such treatments. All 6 patients reported decreased antidiuretic response to previously effective therapy with arginine or lysine vasopressin but had normal response to desmopressin or chlorpropamide. Conclusion: Diabetes insipidus does not result from spontaneously occurring antibodies to vasopressin. The antibodies occasionally develop during treatment with antidiuretic hormone and, when they do, almost always result in secondary resistance to its antidiuretic effect. Antibodies usually do not impair the response to other forms of therapy; they only rarely interfere with the diagnosis of diabetes insipidus, by falsely suggesting the presence of the partial nephrogenic form.\r"

Therefore, unexplained fever in a neutropenic patient requires prompt initiation of antibiotic therapy. Many physicians advocate continuing antibiotic therapy until neutropenia resolves. However, prolonged treatment with broad-spectrum antibiotics increases the risks of drug toxicity and superinfection with resistant bacteria and fungi. Based on a critical review of the literature and a large personal clinical experience, I offer tentative guidelines for withdrawing antibiotic therapy in persistently neutropenic patients. When antibiotic therapy is discontinued, frequent and careful monitoring of these patients and a low threshold for reinstituting antibiotic therapy are essential.\r"

DESIGN: Prospective, consecutive sample study. Setting: Referral-based clinic and wards, National Institutes of Health. PATIENTS: Twenty of twenty-two consecutive homosexual males with AIDS and diarrhea, and 10 homosexual males with AIDS without diarrhea. INTERVENTIONS: All patients had a complete physical examination; serial stool examinations for viral, bacterial, fungal, and protozoan pathogens; and esophagogastroduodenoscopy and colonoscopy to obtain duodenal fluid and mucosal tissue to analyze for enteric pathogens or histopathology. Patients with diarrhea had a malabsorption evaluation. Patients with treatable pathogenic microorganisms received standard antimicrobial therapy. MEASUREMENTS and MAIN RESULTS: The 20 patients with AIDS and diarrhea had greater weight loss, lower mean numbers of helper-inducer (OKT4) lymphocytes, and a higher incidence of extraintestinal opportunistic infections than the 10 patients without diarrhea. One or more enteric pathogen was identified in 17 of 20 patients (85%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 65% to 96%) with diarrhea. Only 1 patient without diarrhea was infected with an enteric pathogen. Nineteen of twenty patients with diarrhea and all 10 patients without diarrhea had chronic inflammatory changes in their intestinal biopsy specimens. Sixteen patients with identifiable enteric pathogens and diarrhea were treated; 11 (69%; 95% CI, 43% to 87%) showed microbiologic, histologic, or clinical improvement. CONCLUSIONS: Thorough diagnostic evaluation can lead to the identification of enteric pathogens in a high percentage of patients with AIDS and diarrhea. Specific therapy can lead to symptomatic improvement.\r"

Ninety-seven embolizations were done with a median number of 4 (range, 1 to 12) per patient. The interval between embolizations ranged from 1 to 8 months. Twelve of twenty evaluable patients had a partial remission, frequently associated with subjective improvement and decrease in hormone levels. The projected median survival of all 22 patients from the initiation of embolization is 33.7 months (range, 1 to 72). Nausea, vomiting, fever, and abdominal pain occurred with each embolization and subsided usually by day 10 (range, 3 to 35). Sequential hepatic artery occlusion is an effective method for prolonged palliation in this selected group of patients.\r"

SETTING: Academic medical center, university referral hospital, city hospital, and Veterans Administration hospital. PATIENTS: Sixty patients with malignant pleural effusions, proven at either initial thoracentesis by cytologic examination or within 4 months of initial thoracentesis by repeat thoracentesis, thoracotomy, or autopsy, were followed until death. INTERVENTION: Twenty-one patients, 12 with normal pleural fluid pH and 9 with low pleural fluid pH, were treated with tube thoracostomy and intrapleural tetracycline for symptomatic, recurrent pleural effusions. MAIN RESULTS: The 20 patients with low-pH malignant effusions had a significantly greater positivity on initial pleural fluid cytologic evaluation, a shorter mean survival, and a poorer response to tetracycline pleurodesis compared with 40 patients with normal-pH malignant effusions. CONCLUSIONS: Determination of pleural fluid pH in malignant effusions provides a rational approach to further diagnostic testing, prognostic information, and a rationale for palliative treatment.\r"

DESIGN: Case-control study. SETTING: Large, urban, university-affiliated referral hospital. PATIENTS: From a consecutive sample of 6452 women having coronary arteriography between 1972 and 1984, 2188 patients were eligible for study; others were excluded because they were nonmenopausal, had congenital heart defects, valvular heart disorders, primary myocardial disease, or no more than mild to moderate coronary artery disease. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS and MAIN RESULTS: Hospital nurses routinely obtained medication histories. Staff invasive cardiologists interpreted coronary arteriograms. Clinical, laboratory, and angiographic data were abstracted from the cardiac catheterization reports and entered into a computerized registry. Postmenopausal estrogen use for 1444 cases of coronary artery disease (70% stenosis) was compared to that 744 controls (0% stenosis). The odds ratio estimate of the risk of coronary artery disease for estrogen users relative to the risk of coronary artery disease for nonusers was 0.44 (95% confidence interval, 0.29 to 0.67) after adjustment for age, cigarette smoking, diabetes, cholesterol, and hypertension. Postmenopausal estrogen replacement was a significant independent protective factor for coronary artery disease in a multivariate logistic regression model (P = 0.037). CONCLUSION: The data suggest that postmenopausal estrogen treatment reduces the risk for angiographically significant coronary artery disease.\r"

A case-control study implicated a new vehicle for botulism, commercial chopped garlic in soybean oil (P less than 10(-4)). Relatively mild and slowly progressive illness, dispersion of patients over at least eight provinces and states in three countries, and a previously unsuspected vehicle had contributed to prolonged misdiagnoses, including myasthenia gravis (six patients), psychiatric disorders (four), stroke (three), and others. Ethnic background influenced severity of illness: 60% of Chinese patients but only 4% of others needed mechanical ventilation (P less than 10(-3]. Trypsinization of serum was needed to show toxemia in one patient. Electromyography results with high-frequency repetitive stimulation corroborated the diagnosis of botulism up to 2 months after onset. Although botulism is a life-threatening disease, misdiagnosis may be common and large outbreaks can escape recognition completely.\r"

Thirty percent of cases were caused by coinfection with hepatitis B virus and hepatitis delta virus or by infection with hepatitis delta virus superimposed on carriers of chronic HBsAg. In 18.5% of the patients, the absence of IgM anti-HBc indicated that they were not known to carry HBsAg, but no obvious superimposed factor of hepatitis could be identified. The cause of fulminant hepatitis is complex, and major risk factors are a pre-existing HBsAg state and hepatitis delta virus infection. Superinfection of HBsAg carriers by non-A, non-B viruses seems to be the cause in a consistent proportion of cases.\r"

Although the syndrome has received recent attention, and has been diagnosed in many patients, the chronic Epstein-Barr virus syndrome has not been defined consistently. Despite the name of the syndrome, both the diagnostic value of Epstein-Barr virus serologic tests and the proposed causal relationship between Epstein-Barr virus infection and patients who have been diagnosed with the chronic Epstein-Barr virus syndrome remain doubtful. We propose a new name for the chronic Epstein-Barr virus syndrome--the chronic fatigue syndrome--that more accurately describes this symptom complex as a syndrome of unknown cause characterized primarily by chronic fatigue. We also present a working definition for the chronic fatigue syndrome designed to improve the comparability and reproducibility of clinical research and epidemiologic studies, and to provide a rational basis for evaluating patients who have chronic fatigue of undetermined cause.\r"

However, after pretreatment with a single dose of buthionine sulfoximine (BSO; 800 mg/kg intraperitoneally) to reduce intracellular glutathione (gamma-glutamylcysteinylglycine; GSH) levels, the above single administration of ETA and KA resulted in complete deafness and severe morphologic damage. The kidney, which has a rapid GSH turnover and is therefore especially susceptible to GSH depletion by BSO, also demonstrated severe damage after this treatment. A similar rapid turnover of GSH and resulting limited capacity to detoxify reactive metabolites and free radicals may determine cochlear and renal vulnerability to this toxicity. These findings may explain the clinical observations of enhanced ototoxicity in patients administered amino-glycoside antibiotics concomitantly with loop diuretics.\r"

The results demonstrated a marked reduction (74%) in the number of synaptic profiles (SPs) on the VO cell soma in both experimental groups. Synaptic vesicles in the remaining SPs on VO neurons were fewer, smaller, and rounder than vesicles in control animals. The residual SPs also were associated with more asymmetric synapses.

This study was designed to compare the morphologic effects of urea and glycerol on cochlear tissues, using the chinchilla as an experimental model. Animals were given subcutaneous injections of glycerol (2 g/kg) or urea (1.2 g/kg) over periods of 3 hours, 4 days, or 1 week. Both agents were found to produce ultrastructural changes, including spiral ligament vacuolization, intracellular alterations of the stria vascularis, and increased numbers of Hensen's bodies in outer hair cells. These alterations appeared indicative of metabolic stress, but not toxicity. The morphologic findings provided no evidence that glycerol and urea affect the inner ear by fundamentally different mechanisms of action.\r"

Patients in whom rubber tubes were inserted between the gauze layers of the anterior nasal packs suffered no such inconvenience and showed no such gradients. Our work proves the value of using these tubes for pressure equalization when nasal packs are necessary.\r"

Loss of hair cell stereocilia was found in all ears with cholesteatomas and was significantly increased when compared with uninvolved ears from animals of similar age. The hair cell loss associated with gerbilline cholesteatomas appeared to be most marked in the middle turn of the cochlea and increased in severity with increasing size of the cholesteatomas. Outer hair cells were affected more than inner hair cells. Inner and outer hair cell loss was not significantly different in infected cholesteatomas versus sterile cholesteatomas. The greater damage to hair cells at the middle turn compared to the basal turn suggests that these losses may be the result of some agent acting through the cochlear wall rather than through the round window.\r"

The results emphasized that SAN function was relatively good after conservative neck surgery. Muscle testing findings showed better function than did EMG findings. After surgery the trapezius muscle functioned more efficiently than the sternocleidomastoid (SCM) muscle probably because of the more traumatic surgical handling of both the SCM muscle and its SAN branch. In order to obtain the functional advantages of SAN preservation, the authors suggest that the conservative procedure in radical neck dissection be used whenever warranted by oncologic diagnosis.\r"

In order to examine the function of the stapedius muscle in diseased ears, the recording of the stapedial electromyogram by an electrocochleographic (ECoG) method was considered. The SR was recorded simultaneously by the impedance method in ten normal subjects for comparison. The outputs of ECoG were averaged by a signal processor up to 200 times under a longer sweep time, and a large biphasic wave with a latency of about 11 ms was obtained on the ECoG records. The amplitude increase of the biphasic wave caused by raising the intensity of the acoustic stimulation paralleled that of the SR. This means that the biphasic wave obtained by ECoG with a latency of about 11 ms originated from the stapedius muscle.\r"

In a previous study, we examined the effects of noise, hypertension, and an atherogenic diet on the microvasculature of the cochleas in rats. The present study examines the effects of these stresses on the hearts of the same rats. The technique used to examine microvascular blood flow was the injection of unlabeled microspheres prior to killing. We found that the blood flow in the cochleas was reduced significantly in hypertensive animals exposed to noise or an atherogenic diet compared to that of normotensive or hypertensive control animals. The hearts of such animals, however, showed decreased myocardial blood flow only when compared to those of normotensive control animals, not when compared to those of hypertensive control animals.\r"

Whereas the most potent species in vitro were the free fatty acids, polar lipids and glycosphingolipids also demonstrated antistaphylococcal activity in vitro, while other neutral lipids displayed virtually none, results that were confirmed with authentic standards in vitro. In a pilot study on delipidized forearm test sites in human volunteers, naturally occurring free fatty acids, polar lipids, and glycosphingolipids exhibited significantly more antistaphylococcal activity than other stratum corneum lipids or vehicle controls. Finally, biopsy specimens of incubated skin sites demonstrated penetration of staphylococci through lipid-enriched intercellular domains. These results provide the first evidence that endogenous, epidermis-derived skin lipids may contribute to cutaneous antimicrobial resistance.\r"

  ".W": "Fibronectin (Fn) is a normal plasma and extracellular matrix glycoprotein that is thought to be important in reticuloendothelial system function as well as in promoting adhesion of various cell types to basement membranes and to each other. Plasma Fn levels are depressed following almost any type of trauma. It opsonizes circulating tissue debris for removal by the fixed cells of the reticuloendothelial system. It has been assumed but not proven that Fn also opsonizes tissue debris at the site of the injury for subsequent phagocytosis by tissue macrophages. In this study, rats were given intracardiac injections of Fn coupled with fluorescence isothiocyanate (Fn-FITC) and human serum albumin-rhodamine isothiocyanate (HSA-RITC). Abdominal Rebuck skin windows were then prepared. Within 24 hours, debris at the sites of injury were observed to be coated with Fn-FITC but not HSA-RITC. This Fn-labeled debris was subsequently ingested by macrophages at the site. No macrophages were found that had taken up HSA-RITC. Thus, Fn is seen to coat tissue debris and effete cells within the wound, and the coated material is subsequently removed by tissue macrophages.\r"

  ".W": "In a recent study, all patients with delayed pressure urticaria (DPU) developed late cutaneous reaction (LCR) after intradermal injection of compound 48/80 and after skin testing with certain food antigens. In the present study, we analyzed the histologic changes in the pressure lesions and compared them with those found in normal skin injected with diluent and in LCR to 48/80. The study included five patients with DPU associated with chronic urticaria (CU) and four patients with CU but without DPU. Six to eight hours after pressure challenge and intradermal skin testing with 48/80 and diluent, skin biopsy specimens were obtained from the pressure lesions, the LCRs, and normal skin (diluent injection). Specimens were assessed by Giemsa staining of 1-micron sections and immunofluorescence of frozen sections. Total cells were counted in each specimen. Interstitial deposits of fibrin were observed by immunofluorescence in LCR and pressure lesions. The total numbers of infiltrating cells in the dermis among LCR sites and pressure lesions were not significantly different, while both LCR sites and pressure lesions contained significantly more infiltrating cells than did normal skin injected with saline diluent. The differential counts in LCR and DPU were mostly mononuclear cells. Infiltrates in the DPU and LCR were mostly perivascular. No histopathologic changes were seen at skin sites challenged with pressure in the control patients with CU without clinical manifestations of DPU. We conclude that lesions seen in DPU are morphologically similar to classic LCR.\r"

The cutaneous disorder, which paralleled the clinical course of her disease, was characterized by slightly raised, erythematous, annular lesions predominantly involving the face and arms, with sporadic involvement elsewhere. Histopathologic examination of biopsy material obtained from affected skin disclosed a granulomatous dermatitis. The patient's symptoms and cutaneous eruption resolved after systemic corticosteroid therapy. This eruption may represent a distinct cutaneous component of CEBV infection with clinically granuloma annulare-like features or the mere serendipitous association of CEBV infection and an unusual granulomatous dermatitis. Because of the unusual clinical appearance of the eruption and its clear correlation with disease activity, we speculate that it likely represents a distinct cutaneous condition, heretofore unreported, caused by CEBV infection.\r"

Four patients (3 women, 1 man) with recurrent giant liver hemangiomas underwent either surgical or radiation therapy as initial treatment for the primary tumor. The average time until recurrence was 14 years, and each tumor weighed more than 600 g. Each of the female patients had been given chronic estrogen (Premarin) replacement therapy. Three of the four patients underwent surgical resection for intractable symptoms or progressive enlargement. It is believed that estrogen replacement therapy may play a role in the pathogenesis of these tumors. Furthermore, operative intervention should be considered in patients with recurrent giant liver hemangioma.\r"

Right lobectomy was performed in 4 patients, extended right lobectomy in 7, left lobectomy in 8, and excision of the median segment segment of the left lobe (segment IV) in 3. Bilio-enteric continuity was restored by hepatocholedochostomy in 17 patients and hepatojejunostomy in 4. (One patient had external transhepatic catheter drainage and no internal bile drainage.) Operative mortality rate was 27% and caused by excessive intraoperative bleeding, sepsis, or liver insufficiency. Postoperative complications occurred in 57% of patients surviving the operation and were due mainly to leakage from the hepatocholedochostomy. Median survival was 6 months, and one third of the patients survived 1 year. Three patients survived 10 years and were among the four patients in whom a tumor-free resection margin was obtained (one of them died in the postoperative phase). It is concluded that resection of hilar cholangiocarcinoma may give long-term survival if a free resection margin is obtained. The importance of a free resection margin indicates that surgery should be aggressive and include liver resection.\r"

Two hundred thirty-seven patients with CBD stones were treated. One hundred thirty patients had intact gallbladders. Of these patients, 76 (59%) underwent cholecystectomy and common bile duct exploration (CBDE) while 54 (41%) underwent endoscopic papillotomy (EP) only. Of the 107 patients admitted with recurrent stones after cholecystectomy, all but five were treated with EP. The overall mortality rate was 3.0%. Complications, success, and death rates were all similar for CBDE and EP, but the complications of EP were often serious and directly related to the procedure (GI hemorrhage, 6; duodenal perforation, 5; biliary sepsis, 4; pancreatitis, 1). Patients undergoing EP required significantly shorter hospitalization than those undergoing CBDE. Multivariate analysis showed that age greater than 70 years, technical failure, and complications increased the risk of death, regardless of procedure performed. Twenty-one per cent of those undergoing EP with gallbladders intact eventually required cholecystectomy. The conclusion is that the results of EP and CBDE are similar, and the use of EP has not reduced the mortality rates of this disease.\r"

  ".W": "A reoperation after excisional procedure was carried out in seven cases due to early or late postoperative complications. Of the 12 patients with early complications, four underwent relaparotomy due to anastomotic leakage and bleeding. Late complications were seen in nine patients with recurrent cholangitis caused by an anastomotic stricture, and three patients with intrahepatic involvement required a reoperation several years after the initial surgery. Recurrent cholangitis after biliary reconstruction mainly occurs due to an anastomotic stricture of the hepaticoenterostomy. There was no significant difference in the results between hepaticoduodenostomy and hepaticojejunostomy over a long follow-up period. A wide anastomotic stoma that permits free drainage of bile into the intestine is imperative to the prevention of cholangitis, and can be created by an incision extending along the lateral wall of both the hepatic ducts with a hepaticoenterostomy at the hilum. This procedure is obviously necessary in all patients with or without intrahepatic involvement. Carcinoma of the intrahepatic ducts and the retained distal choledochus have rarely developed in patients undergoing cyst excision followed by biliary reconstruction. Complete excision of the whole extrahepatic bile duct could prevent carcinoma arising in the distal choledochus, although it could not prevent carcinoma arising from the intrahepatic ducts. However, patients with carcinoma of the intrahepatic duct were reported to have had symptoms of biliary stricture for a long time since the cyst excision. Bile stagnation in the intrahepatic ducts is possibly responsible for the development of carcinoma. A wide anastomosis resulting in free drainage of bile appears to be essential to the prevention of carcinoma arising in the intrahepatic ducts after cyst excision.\r"

As a result, some characteristic patterns of stress response in the elderly could be detected as follows: the disorders of the vital organs were more important indices for the development of postoperative complications rather than age, and a reduction in the maximum response of the stress hormones to surgical procedures in aged patients was noted; moreover, the functional variability of target organ in the aged group was confirmed. Studies on the hormonal response to surgery suggest that the restriction of fluid replacement is advisable until the third postoperative day, maintaining the host on the dry side, to prevent cardiopulmonary complications. As the nutritional status in the patients with esophageal and gastric cancer goes from bad to worse with the advancing clinical stages, adequate perioperative nutrition is imperative to prevent complications such as anastomotic leakage, wound dehiscence, and/or infections. For the treatment of anastomotic leaks after esophagectomy and esophagogastrectomy, more than 45 kcal/kg/d must be provided, and the serum albumin level must be restored to 3.5 g/dL in order to achieve spontaneous healing of small anastomotic leakages.\r"

The purpose of this study was to compare the stages of colorectal cancers resected during the 18-month period prior to (Pre-SES) and during the first 18 months (Post-SES) after the creation of the Surgical Endoscopy Service. In addition, the yield of lesions that would have been obtained by depending upon patient symptoms or occult blood testing were determined. A total of 361 colonoscopies were performed Pre-SES and 874 colonoscopies Post-SES; 26 patients underwent resection of colorectal cancers Pre-SES and 32 Post-SES. Whereas early colorectal cancers (Dukes' A and B1) were found in only three patients (12%) Pre-SES period, early cancers were found in 13 (41%) Post-SES. Doubling the number of colonoscopies produced a fourfold increase in the number of early lesions. Furthermore, disseminated cancers (D lesions) dropped from 19% Pre-SES to 3% Post-SES. Among the total 58 patients, 43% of the A lesions and 40% of the B1 lesions were asymptomatic. Even more alarming, 86% of the A lesions, 50% of the B1 lesions, 31% of the B2 lesions, and 14% of the C2 lesions were occult blood negative. Indeed, only the D lesions were uniformly occult blood positive. This study demonstrates that aggressive colonoscopy detects early colorectal cancers. Moreover, patient symptoms or occult blood testing will fail to indicate the majority of early colorectal cancers.\r"

The mean patient age was 74 years, and 74% were men, 57% had diabetes mellitus, 92% were smokers, and 72% had hypertension and/or coronary artery disease. All patients were evaluated by preoperative noninvasive testing and biplanar angiography. All procedures were performed by the valve incision technique. The vein utilization rate was 91%. Grafts were routinely placed into isolated tibial segments and foot vessels without evidence of a patent pedal arch. Follow-up information was obtained at 3-month intervals. Patency and limb salvage data were calculated by life-table analysis. The cumulative patency rates were 98% at 1 month, 88% at 12 months, and 82% at 50 months. These data demonstrate that the in situ bypass maintains an excellent patency rate and provides durable limb salvage.\r"

The overall result was favorable: 96.5% of the patients found the new appearance of their breast very good (30.7%), good (44.0%), or acceptable (21.8%). Women with a benign diagnosis ran a two-fold higher risk of being discontented with the new appearance of the breast than those with breast cancer. Complications of radiation therapy, preoperative concern that the breasts are important for the appearance, and anxiousness about the cosmetic result were associated with a significantly elevated risk of being less satisfied with the outcome. The main finding that it is possible to perform a locally radical operation that is highly acceptable to the woman is relevant to the surgical management of potentially malignant mammographic lesions and also to the scientific strategies for future evaluation of breast-conserving treatment modes in malignant disease.\r"

Infection was induced by seeding wounds with Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Subpopulations were identified by flow cytometry 48 hours after burn. Helper lymphocytes were selectively depleted from the circulation of BI but not B animals, which caused the ratio of helper to suppressor cells (HSR) in BI animals to decrease significantly compared with the unburned controls. Both LN helper and suppressor cells were decreased in BI animals and the HSR was unchanged, but a selective reduction in suppressor cells in B LN increased the HSR relative to unburned controls. Spleen subpopulations were unchanged for both B and BI groups. Subpopulation changes after trauma and infection were different for each tissue examined.\r"

  ".W": "Of 119 patients with surgical correction of anorectal malformations, 47 who were 10-30 years of age were interviewed personally and had manometric studies to evaluate postoperative continence. This clinical study included not only long-term anorectal function but also sexual function. Patients with low type anomalies or with intermediate type anomalies were more likely to be continent, whereas patients with high type lesions had some problems with continence. However, only two of the 16 patients (12%) with high type anomalies were classified as having poor results. This rate is perhaps lower than might be expected. Thus, incontinent patients may become continent even if they were classified as having fecal incontinence before 6 years of age. Most patients who were 15-30 years of age had normal sexual function except for two females with irregular menstruation. These results indicate that achievement of fecal continence and sexual function in patients with high type anomalies treated by abdominoperineal rectoplasty depends on careful dissection as close as possible to the rectal wall and bringing the terminal bowel down exactly within the sling of the puborectal muscle.\r"

  ".W": "Mitral valve surgery was performed in 88 patients with severe pulmonary hypertension (average systolic pulmonary artery pressure, 94.7 +/- 22 mm Hg; range, 70-180 mm Hg) over a 10-year period. Sixty-four patients (73%) were in New York Heart Association Functional Class III or IV. There were 64 valve replacements and 24 open mitral commissurotomies. Operative mortality was 5.6% (5 patients) and was not related to the degree of pulmonary hypertension, surgical procedure performed, or type of valve lesion. A 100% follow-up was obtained, ranging from nine months to 10 years, with a mean of 44 months. Six late cardiac deaths (7.2%) occurred, 5 in patients with valve replacement and 1 in a patient who underwent a commissurotomy. Actuarial survival was 86 +/- 3% at five years and 83 +/- 4% at 10 years. Fourteen patients underwent right ventricular catheterization a mean of 24 months following operation. Systolic pulmonary artery pressure had decreased from a mean preoperative value of 101 +/- 22 to 40.5 +/- 7 mm Hg (p less than 0.001). Cardiac index increased by 55% of the preoperative values. Functional status improved markedly; 71 survivors (93%) were in New York Heart Association Class I or II. These results indicate that, in patients with mitral valve lesions and severe pulmonary hypertension, (1) surgical procedures can be performed with an acceptable operative mortality; (2) excellent long-term survival and functional results can be obtained; and (3) pulmonary hypertension decreases significantly after operation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Forty-eight had gastroesophageal reflux disease and 2 had chronic lye strictures. Of the patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease, 21 had a Barrett's esophagus. Esophageal dilations had been performed in 29 patients, 12 of whom also had undergone previous surgical procedures. Preoperative dilations by our group were used to determine further intervention. Patients with dilatable strictures were randomized to either a Nissen or a Belsey operation. In this group, there were no operative deaths, and excellent or good clinical results were obtained in 28 of 34 (82%) patients, with no significant differences noted in the outcomes between the two operations. Patients with undilatable strictures, Barrett's ulcer, or mucosal dysplasia underwent resection plus colon interposition (N = 12) or resection plus gastric interposition (N = 4). Two of the patients in the Nissen operation group later required resection and colon interposition, bringing that total to 14. Resection plus colon interposition resulted in excellent or good results in 71% of patients, with a 7% operative mortality. These results suggest that a standard transthoracic antireflux procedure can be performed with a low risk when strictures are dilatable. Excellent or good results were obtained in 82% of patients, which is equivalent to results for more complex operations. There was no significant difference in the outcome for the transthoracic Nissen procedure compared with the Belsey procedure. In addition, when required, resection plus colon interposition provided excellent or good results in 71% of the patients.\r"

The decreased plasma fibronectin levels seen after cardiac surgery have been considered to derive mainly from opsonic consumption. In the present study, we demonstrated that the administration of ulinastatin, a human urinary trypsin inhibitor, to patients after cardiac surgery not only inhibited the postoperative depression of plasma fibronectin levels, but also maintained the plasma fibronectin level within the normal range. This effect apparently resulted from the inhibitory activity of ulinastatin on the proteolytic enzymes released after operation. This result suggests that the decreased plasma fibronectin level noted after cardiac surgery may derive mostly from excessive proteolytic enzymes. Our observation also indicates that the prophylactic administration of ulinastatin to patients undergoing major operations will result in a favorably functional reticuloendothelial phagocytic system.\r"

Preoperative echocardiography and cardiac catheterization were performed on all patients. The ratios of the left ventricular outflow tract diameters and the ascending aortic diameters to the descending aortic diameters were 0.56 +/- 0.03 and 0.56 +/- 0.06, respectively, compared with 0.81 +/- 0.12 and 0.95 +/- 0.17, respectively, in 20 patients with interrupted aortic arch but without obstruction (p less than 0.001). Four of the 10 patients underwent pulmonary artery banding and insertion of a bypass graft between the ascending and the descending aorta. All 4 died of low cardiac output soon after operation (100% operative mortality). The remaining 6 patients underwent banding and insertion of a graft between the main pulmonary artery proximal to the band, and the descending aorta. All of these patients survived, and all except 1 are doing well 3 months to 4 years postoperatively. The use of a pulmonary artery-descending aorta conduit and of distal pulmonary artery banding provides good palliation for patients with interrupted aortic arch and major subaortic stenosis.\r"

Pure coarctation was present in 63 patients (Group 1), 47 infants had additional ventricular septal defects (Group 2), and 68 patients had associated complex heart disease (Group 3). Subclavian flap angioplasty was used in 26 patients, limited resection and end-to-end anastomosis in 45 patients, extended resection and end-to-end anastomosis in 99 patients, and miscellaneous procedures in 8 infants. The early mortality was 8% for the first group, 11% for the second group, and 37% for the third group (p less than 0.001). Mean follow-up was 32 months and included 97% of patients. Actuarial survival at five years was 90% for the first group, 84% for the second group, and 40% for the third group. Recoarctation occurred in 15 operative survivors (11%); 7 necessitated reoperation. Freedom from recoarctation at five years was 89% after subclavian flap angioplasty, 81% after end-to-end anastomosis, and 86% following extended resection and end-to-end anastomosis. Early mortality and late results were not influenced by the type of coarctation repair but were determined by the clinical status and the presence of associated major cardiac anomalies. These results suggest that the surgical procedure should be individualized for each infant to optimize the aortic anatomy.\r"

  ".W": "We examined the effects of buoyancy on the distribution of arterial gas bubbles using in vitro and in vivo techniques in dogs. A simulated carotid artery preparation was used to determine the effects of bubble size and vessel angle on the velocity and direction of bubble movement in flowing blood. Because buoyancy tends to float bubbles away from dependent areas, bubble velocity would be expected to decrease as the vessel angle increased. We found that larger bubbles increased in velocity in the same direction as the blood flow at 0-, 10-, and 30-degree vessel angles and decreased when the vessel was positioned at 90 degrees. Smaller bubbles did not change velocity from 0 to 30 degrees and increased in velocity in the same direction as blood flow at 90 degrees. In 10 anesthetized dogs, we studied the effects of 0-, 10-, 15-, and 30-degree Trendelenburg's position on carotid artery distribution of gas bubbles injected into the left ventricle or ascending aorta. Regardless of the degree of the Trendelenburg position, the bubbles passed into the carotid artery simultaneously with passage into the abdominal aorta. We conclude that the forces of buoyancy do not overcome the force of arterial blood flow and that the Trendelenburg position does not prevent arterial bubbles from reaching the brain.\r"

  ".W": "We assessed somatosensory evoked response (SSER) as a monitor of cerebral protection during nonpulsatile, hypothermic cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). In 13 dogs under CPB, extracorporeal flow rate (EFR) thresholds for loss of SSER were determined by stepwise reduction of the EFR from 2.0 to 0.25 L/min/m2 at perfusion temperatures of 35 degrees C, 30 degrees C, 25 degrees C, and 20 degrees C. Testing began at 35 degrees C in Group 1 (N = 6) and at 20 degrees C in Group 2 (N = 7). Immediately on loss of SSER (denoted as a decrease of 80% or more in the amplitude of the somatosensory evoked potentials), EFR was restored to 2.0 L/min/m. Thresholds for loss of SSER ranged between 0.75 and 0.25 L/min/m2. SSER was always restored on return of EFR to 2.0 L/min/m2; thus loss of SSER was a reversible ischemic change. Both groups had similar threshold values at 35 degrees C, but at lower temperatures, Group 1 thresholds were significantly higher than those in Group 2. Since 35 degrees C was the first test temperature for Group 1 but the last for Group 2, EFR reduction at 35 degrees C apparently caused neurophysiological changes (depletion of cortical energy reserves), which diminished subsequent tolerance to ischemia, but EFR reduction at 20 degrees C did not. Our findings show that loss of SSER warns of reversible cerebral ischemia, and support SSER monitoring as a useful measure of cerebral function during low-flow, hypothermic CPB.\r"

Natriuresis, weight reduction (mean, 11 kg), and relief of symptoms were achieved in all patients. The mean survival after the start of the high-dose furosemide therapy was 11.3 months (range, 0.5 to 36 months) (n = 35). When this therapy eventually failed, long-term intermittent hemofiltration was performed in eight selected cases, further prolonging survival (mean, 3.0 months). High-dose furosemide therapy and hemofiltration improved the quality of life and prolonged survival. The use of diuretics in congestive heart failure should therefore include treatment with high-dose furosemide, which is effective and can be given over a long period without serious side effects.\r"

  ".U": "88133138\r", 
  ".W": "An intravenous magnesium-loading test with 30 mmol/L of magnesium was used to evaluate the magnesium status in 38 patients with ischemic heart disease (IHD) admitted to the coronary care unit with suspected acute myocardial infarction (AMI), in ten healthy volunteers (control group), and in nine patients with chronic IHD in a stable phase of their disease (chronic IHD group). Sixteen of the patients admitted with acute disease proved to have AMI (AMI group) and 22 did not (non-AMI group). Patients with IHD both with and without AMI retained significantly more magnesium (9.3 and 10.7 mmol/L [22.6 and 26 mg/dL], respectively) than did the control group (1.4 mmol/L [3.4 mg/dL]). This 34% magnesium retention points to a state of magnesium deficiency in patients with IHD. However, since the patients with and without AMI did not differ, the observations do not indicate that AMI is associated with a more severe magnesium deficiency than that found in other IHD patients without AMI. When the patients with IHD were subgrouped according to long-term diuretic treatment, the patients (n = 19) receiving long-term diuretic treatment had a 39% retention of magnesium (11.6 mmol/L [28.2 mg/dL]) compared with a 29% retention (8.7 mmol/L [21.1 mg/dL]) observed in 19 patients who were not receiving long-term diuretic treatment. This observation was not influenced by the presence or absence of AMI. An even higher level of magnesium retention (17.1 mmol/L [41.6 mg/dL] equals 57% retention) was found when investigating patients with chronic ischemic heart disease in a stable phase of their disease. This indicates that patients with IHD may be severely magnesium deficient; that long-term diuretic treatment contributes to this deficiency, but that diuretic treatment per se is not the only cause of this condition.\r"

Unexpected toxicology findings led to changes in therapy in only three cases, and none of these changes appeared to have a major impact on outcome. Although routine comprehensive toxicology screening frequently may identify unsuspected drugs, it is likely that a policy of more selective use of the laboratory would not compromise the care of patients with drug overdose.\r"

Net economic impact was calculated by estimating cumulative costs borne by the employer under various scenarios and comparing them with projected costs estimated from baseline data. The model included the following: baseline number of staff, baseline percentage of smokers, annual employee turnover rate, number of smokers interested in quitting, the cost of a smoking cessation program, expected success rate of a voluntary cessation program, smokers quitting spontaneously without a program, and employer-borne costs related to employee smoking. A variety of scenarios were constructed to generate a range of employer net economic impact figures and resulting percentages of smoking employees. Results showed that the benefits of a cessation program would be eliminated over several years, unless the prevalence of smoking in incoming employees was reduced. The most favorable scenario, combining a hospital cessation program and reduced smoking among new employees, generated cumulative savings, discounted at 5%, of $358,000 to $684,000 over an eight-year period.\r"

Angiography disclosed the presence of a late-filling well-circumscribed saccular pseudoaneurysm. This was obliterated with an acute infiltrate with or without hemoptysis in the area subtended by a flow-director pulmonary artery catheter, and particularly when it is associated with manipulation of that catheter, the differential diagnosis should include pulmonary artery perforation as well as infarction.

It is possible, however, that fecal occult blood testing and sigmoidoscopy to 60 cm would fail to identify patients with adenomatous polyps located only in the proximal colon. The purpose of this study was to determine how many patients without polyps in the distal 60 cm of the colon would have more proximal lesions. Ninety-eight consecutive patients with positive fecal blood test results or suspicious barium enema results were studied, using the assumption that if they had been seen six months earlier, when asymptomatic, they would have been candidates for screening examination. Forty-one (42%) of 98 patients had adenomatous polyps or cancer, and 15 (37%) of these patients had isolated proximal lesions. The polyp detection rate from 0 to 60 cm was significantly less than the detection rate for a full colonoscopy (27% vs 42%). We conclude that isolated proximal colonic polyps may be common.\r"

To determine what asymptomatic women actually experience during mammography, a survey of 1847 women was performed at seven breast-imaging centers. Women recorded their experience on a six-point scale ranging from no discomfort to severe pain. Eighty-eight percent of the women experienced no discomfort (49%) or mild discomfort (39%). Only 9% experienced moderate discomfort; 1%, severe discomfort; and 1%, moderate pain. No woman had pain so severe that it would make her reconsider having a mammogram again. The degree of discomfort was slightly greater in women who complained of breast tenderness within three days prior to the mammogram but was not strongly related to age, menstrual status, or week of the menstrual cycle. We conclude that in a vast majority of women mammography causes no or mild physical discomfort and that actual pain is an uncommon occurrence.\r"

Multivariate analysis was performed to determine the important variables related to the occurrence of fascicular block and hospital mortality based on 17 clinical variables obtained at the time of hospital admission. Serum potassium level and heart rate were the significant factors predicting the occurrence of fascicular block, whereas cardiac output and arterial oxygen tension were important for hospital mortality. Therefore, not only the rise in the heart rate but also the effect of the serum potassium level on the conduction system are independent factors related to the occurrence of fascicular block, and fascicular block in itself has no significant influence on the hospital mortality.\r"

Computed tomographic and cerebrospinal fluid data in male subjects were compared with those obtained in female subjects. We found that when cysticerci are found in brain parenchyma, women develop a greater degree of inflammation; such differences disappear when cysticerci are found in the subarachnoid space. Our results point out the possibility of a factor located within brain parenchyma that accounts for the observed sex-related differences in the severity of immune response to the parasite; this factor could also play a role in the pathogenesis of other immunologically mediated diseases of the brain that may occur more frequently in women. To our knowledge, this study is the first in demonstrating that sex is a risk factor for the severity of inflammatory response within brain parenchyma to a parasitic disease.\r"

A significant level of herd immunity may have accounted for the slow progression through the nursing home. In addition, serologic evidence of concurrent infection with respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza virus, and Mycoplasma pneumoniae was present in many residents. Epidemics of influenza in a closed, partially immunized population in a nursing home may proceed at a slower rate than in an open, largely unimmunized community. By monitoring for infection with other respiratory agents, the complex nature of the outbreak in this nursing home became evident.\r"

A high incidence of methicillin-resistant S aureus infection or colonization is a clinical feature of nursing home patients.

The number of patients per outbreak ranged from one to ten (mean, 3.8). All outbreaks were caused by home-prepared foods: nine by smoked ham, one by bacon, one by sausage, and one by mussels; contaminated food was not found in one outbreak. Bacteriologic study was performed in 11 outbreaks and type B toxin, the only found, was detected in eight of them. Generalized muscular weakness, visual disturbances, extreme dry mouth, and severe constipation were observed in all inpatients. Palpebral ptosis, dysphonia, urinary retention, postural hypotension, and respiratory impairment were also reported, but not in all inpatients. Identical, but less severe, manifestations were registered in the 20 ambulatory patients. Electromyographic study showed decreased motor action potential and posttetanic facilitation. Pulmonary function, studied in four inpatients, was decreased in three. All patients recovered fully. Management consisted of supportive measures, symptomatic treatment, and nursing care. Equine antitoxin was not administered and assisted ventilation was unnecessary.\r"

  ".W": "Fluid retention in decompensated hepatic cirrhosis is frequently accompanied by edema, ascites, and hydrothorax. Whether pericardial effusion occurs in such patients has not been studied. Twenty-seven consecutively hospitalized patients with ascites secondary to alcoholic cirrhosis of the liver were studied, and 28 control subjects were studied with the use of an echocardiographic method to detect pericardial effusion and to evaluate their left ventricular (LV) function. Seventeen patients (63%) and three control subjects (11%) showed pericardial effusion. The prevalence of pericardial effusion in the patients was significantly greater than in the control subjects (chi 2 = 10.6). Although the mean values of the echocardiographic measurements of LV function of the patients and the control subjects did not differ significantly, the individual values of the patients varied considerably. Among the patients, six patients (27%) had LV dysfunction, 14 patients (64%) had normal values, and two patients (9%) had values suggestive of hypercontractility of the left ventricle. Furthermore, abnormal systolic motions of the mitral valve and/or septum were noted in eight patients (30%) but in none of the control subjects. Six patients with pericardial effusion on initial examination were evaluated after the resolution of their ascites; pericardial effusion disappeared in two patients, diminished in two others, and remained unchanged in two patients. Resolution of ascites was also associated with normalization of the systolic motion of the mitral valve and septum. It was concluded that pericardial effusion is common in patients with ascites secondary to alcoholic hepatic cirrhosis and that its presence is probably related to fluid retention.\r"

Several complications of PNH during pregnancy were prevented: chronic anemia, folate and iron deficiency, and deep-vein thrombosis. During puerperium, acute hemolytic crises, most probably triggered by delivery, were observed in two patients. Thrombotic complications could be prevented by early initiation of an anticoagulant therapy after delivery. The only neonatal complication, observed in two cases, was isoimmune hemolytic anemia related to the multiple blood transfusions received before and during pregnancy. These results show that successful pregnancies are possible in women with PNH provided that both the obstetricians and physicians in charge monitor the pregnancies closely.\r"

The case-patients lived in adjacent, rural counties and had multiple exposures to goats. We conducted a serosurvey of goat owners and a reference population to compare the prevalence of Q fever antibodies in the two-county area. Goat owners were almost three times more likely to be seropositive with Q fever antibodies than the reference population (43% vs 15%). Among goat owners, individual and household seropositivity prevalences were positively correlated with the number of goats, the number of positive goats, and the number of goat births on the farm. Q fever should be considered more often in the differential diagnosis of patients with compatible illness, especially those with frequent animal contact.\r"

Many signs and symptoms showed little change with age until after the fifth decade of life when they began to decrease gradually. Findings that increased with age were weight loss and atrial fibrillation, while those that decreased most markedly with age were increased appetite and weight gain. The diagnosis is more difficult as age progresses because there are fewer findings and because the significance of those present may not be appreciated. Identification of the most sensitive and specific signs and symptoms in each age decade should improve the early detection of hyperthyroidism.\r"

Seven residents had antibodies to Strongyloides stercoralis as determined by an IgG enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay system (10.9%) and five (71.4%) of this subset had persistent eosinophilia, suggesting a strong association. Sex, race, age, ward, degree of retardation, and medication were not associated with eosinophilia. Stool examination revealed S stercoralis larvae in two residents with S stercoralis antibodies and eosinophilia. Follow-up studies after thiabendazole treatment of the residents with S stercoralis antibodies showed resolution of eosinophilia and disappearance of S stercoralis antibodies in most. Eosinophilia in an adult institutional setting may be associated with strongyloidiasis, even in a nonendemic area. The enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for antibody to S stercoralis may be useful in diagnosing or monitoring therapy of strongyloidiasis.\r"

Overall, 48% (41/85) of patients with myelodysplasia developed acute leukemia. Primary acquired sideroblastic anemia was the most favorable category with longer survival and 13.8% (4/29) leukemic conversions. Variables correlating with leukemic transformation included male sex, thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, and pseudo-Pelger-Huet neutrophils. Only two variables had independent predictive value by multivariate regression analysis: a high percentage of myeloblasts and a low percentage of ringed sideroblasts. Numerous ringed sideroblasts strongly predicts a more favorable course in myelodysplastic patients.\r"

Medical records and biopsies were reviewed and echocardiograms were interpreted by observers who were unaware of the recorded findings. Cardiac amyloidosis was documented by endomyocardial biopsy in 30 (100%) of the patients. In two patients, amyloid was present in only one of four specimens, suggesting that a minimum of four biopsy samples is necessary to eliminate the possibility of sampling error. Only 36 (55%) of 65 biopsy specimens of extracardiac tissues contained amyloid. Findings were positive for amyloidosis in 11 (58%) of 19 rectal biopsies and in 16 (52%) of 31 bone marrow biopsies. Of interest, only the endomyocardial biopsy tissues were positive for amyloid in eight (27%) of the 30 patients, among whom 12 extracardiac biopsies had been performed. Two-dimensional echocardiography was consistent with the diagnosis of amyloidosis in 19 (68%) of 28 patients and was abnormal but nonspecific in the remainder. Endomyocardial biopsy frequently provides information about cardiac involvement with amyloid when biopsy of other organs is negative or echocardiography is nonspecific.\r"

We found that a cuff-IR difference of 4 mm Hg could identify the majority of patients with pseudo-hypertension (sensitivity, 93%; specificity, 64%; positive predictive value, 62%; negative predictive value, 93%). We concluded that the IR is an accurate, quantitative, noninvasive substitute for intra-arterial measurements and may be the preferred technique for screening and monitoring of blood pressure in elderly hypertensive patients.\r"

The rate of normalization of an initial abnormal impedance plethysmogram and, consequently, the usefulness of impedance plethysmography in the management of patients with recurrent symptoms is, however, unknown. In a prospective cohort follow-up study, 161 consecutive patients with proved venous thrombosis and abnormal impedance plethysmograms were studied for one year. After 3, 6, 9, and 12 months, the impedance plethysmograms had normalized in 67%, 85%, 92%, and 95% of the patients, respectively. Thirty-five patients (22%) returned with clinically suspected recurrent thrombosis, of whom 31 had normal impedance plethysmograms prior to their return. In 18 of these patients, repeated tests were normal; these patients did not undergo anticoagulant therapy, and follow-up disclosed no subsequent adverse consequences. In the other 13 patients, the test again became abnormal; 11 patients were shown by venograms to have recurrent deep-vein thrombosis. Consequently, 29 (83%) of the 35 patients in whom the suspicion of recurrent thrombosis arose could have been managed with impedance plethysmography alone without the necessity for venography or anticoagulant therapy. It is concluded that normalization of impedance plethysmography tests occurs in almost all patients within nine months, and that serial impedance plethysmography is useful for patient management in nearly 90% of patients presenting with recurrent symptoms.\r"

All had objective evidence of urethral inflammation and negative cultures for both Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Chlamydia trachomatis. Structural abnormalities were documented in nine (25%) of 36 patients but were considered clinically significant in only four. Physical examination and uroflow testing led to clinical suspicion of anatomic abnormalities in all four patients with significant lesions, which included urethral strictures in three patients and benign prostatic hypertrophy in one patient. Additional abnormal findings included wide-bore strictures in three patients and developmental abnormalities of doubtful significance in two patients. Increased numbers of inflammatory cells in expressed prostatic secretions were associated with the presence of structural abnormalities. We conclude that among men with chronic urethritis, careful physical examination and uroflow studies can be used to screen for evidence of structural abnormalities that merit endoscopic evaluation.\r"

Administration of potassium chloride resulted in normalization of the serum potassium level and resolution of muscle weakness. Treatment with propranolol, and subsequent restoration of a euthyroid state with iodine 131, was effective in preventing further episodes of paralysis. Thyrotoxic periodic paralysis, although rare, may occur in Hispanic patients, and should be considered in the differential diagnosis of muscle weakness in this population.\r"

Three populations at risk for severe bradycardia during oral clonidine therapy were identified: patients with renal insufficiency, patients with clinical sinus node dysfunction, and patients who had developed bradycardia while taking other sympatholytic agents or who were currently receiving another sympatholytic drug. Clonidine effects were dissociated in two patients who were not hypotensive despite severe bradycardia. Asymptomatic patients required only dose reduction or discontinuation of clonidine therapy. Symptomatic patients responded inconsistently to intravenous atropine sulfate therapy; one responded to isoproterenol therapy, and one required temporary artificial pacing. Awareness of the variable presentation and response of this bradycardia to medical therapy will assist patient management. The incidence of this complication is low (less than 0.3%), but attention to risk factors should make clonidine-induced bradycardia even less frequent.\r"

Levels of intrafamilial EE and AS were found to predict likelihood of patient relapse at follow-up, especially when used as conjoint predictors of patient outcome status. Levels of AS also predicted degree of social adjustment at follow-up. The predictive relationships observed were independent of patient medication compliance, treatment regimen, baseline symptoms, demographics, and illness history.

  ".W": "Previous studies of peripheral blood mononuclear cells isolated from drug-free, hospitalized patients with endogenous major depression have demonstrated a diminished adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cyclic AMP) response to single concentrations of isoproterenol as compared with that obtained from normal control subjects. We now report results of isoproterenol dose-response studies that indicate lower basal levels of cyclic AMP as well as diminished cyclic AMP levels in response to isoproterenol stimulation at concentrations ranging from 10(-10) to 10(-5) mol/L in drug-free, hospitalized patients with endogenous depression. The major factor responsible for the diminished cyclic AMP production in the depressed patients was a loss of receptor sites capable of cyclic AMP production. Taken together with our previously reported finding that beta-adrenergic antagonist binding was normal in peripheral blood mononuclear cells obtained from depressed patients, the results of the dose-response studies suggest a loss of receptor function (desensitization) rather than a diminished number of receptor binding sites (down-regulation) as the underlying mechanism. Potential explanations for beta-adrenergic desensitization and its implications for the catecholamine hypothesis of depressive disorders are discussed.\r"

Although the depressed patients were not significantly different from the nondepressed patients in background characteristics, history of depressive disorder, neurological impairment, or social functioning, the depressed group had greater cognitive impairment as measured by Mini-Mental State score. In addition, the depressed group had significantly larger lateral and third ventricular to brain ratios than nondepressed patients on computed tomographic scan analysis. The results suggest that poststroke depression itself may produce an intellectual impairment; subcortical atrophy, which likely preceded the stroke lesion, may produce a vulnerability for depression following stroke.\r"

  ".W": "Using electroencephalographic sleep data from a sample of 235 elderly subjects, discriminant function analyses of sleep alterations in depression and dementia were performed. Overall, 80% of patients were correctly classified using a backward discriminant function analysis, and 81% with a general stepwise discriminant function analysis. Four measures contributed to the separation of depressed and demented patients: rapid eye movement (REM) sleep latency (lower in depressives); REM sleep percent (higher in depressives); indeterminate non-REM sleep percent (higher in demented patients, reflecting greater loss of spindles and K complexes); and early morning awakening (more marked in depressives). When both discriminant functions were subjected to cross-validation in independent subsamples, both procedures correctly identified 78% of patients. The classification functions derived from nondemented depressed and nondepressed demented patients were applied to a mixed-symptom group (n = 42). Overall, 27 patients (64%) with either depressive pseudodementia or dementia with depressive features were correctly classified using the same four predictor variables. These findings suggest that sleep physiological alterations of depression and dementia reflect between-group differences in sleep continuity, sleep architecture, and REM sleep temporal distribution, and that the differences are statistically reliable, in both diagnostically pure and mixed clinical presentations. These findings are discussed in the context of current hypotheses of sleep regulation and its mechanisms.\r"

Compared with age- and sex-matched normal control subjects, manic patients exhibited significantly decreased total recording period, decreased time spent asleep, increased time awake in the last two hours of recording, shortened rapid eye movement (REM) latency, increased REM activity, and increased REM density. These results suggest that mania is associated with marked disturbances of sleep continuity and REM measures. Sleep continuity and REM sleep abnormalities of a similar nature and degree have been reported in major depression and psychotic depression. Thus, it is possible that various forms of affective disorders and psychotic disorders have pathophysiologic mechanisms in common.\r"

Increased risk of unnatural death was found in five of eight psychiatric diagnostic categories but was significant only for Mental Reasoning, a category that combined patients with organic mental disorders, schizophrenia, or mental retardation. Clinical variables associated with an excess rate of unnatural death included age 15 years or older at the time of admission, the absence of a second psychiatric diagnosis, the presence of previous psychiatric hospitalizations, and the presence of a seizure disorder.

  ".W": "Previous studies have shown that arm cranks and arm levers, working as propulsion mechanisms for nonambulatory individuals, may have mechanical and physiologic advantages over standard handrim wheelchairs. This study evaluated physiologic responses to arm lever and arm crank ergometry using identical workloads. An arm lever ergometer (ALE) was constructed and adapted to an arm crank ergometer (ACE) so that equal workloads could be applied with both ergometers. Fifteen able-bodied men and 15 able-bodied women exercised at a low (15 watts) and a high (45 watts) workload, with a three-minute rest interval. While exercising at each level, oxygen consumption (VO2), minute ventilation (VE), and heart rate (HR) were monitored. When low workloads with ALE and ACE were compared, no significant differences (p greater than 0.05) were demonstrated in any of the variables for men or women. For the men, at the high workload, the ALE elicited significantly lower (p less than 0.05) VO2 (by 9.8%), HR (by 6.3%), and VE (by 7.5%), than did the ACE. For the women, at the high workload, VO2 was significantly lower (p less than 0.05) (by 7.6%) with the ALE, as was VE (by 7.5%), but HR, although 3.3% lower with the ALE, was not significantly different (p greater than 0.05) from the ACE. These data suggest that the ALE is physiologically less stressful than the ACE at high workloads. Arm levers may, therefore, provide an advantage for handicapped persons when they propel themselves in wheelchairs.\r"

Latencies to recruitment and termination of EMG activity of flexor carpi radialis and extensor carpi radialis longus were recorded from nine stroke patients and five age- and sex-matched control subjects, in response to buzzer signals, during maximal isometric wrist flexion and extension. Both agonist and antagonist recruitment times were slower in paretic than in control forearms (p less than .01). Termination of EMG activity occurred earlier in paretic forearms, primarily because of inability to maintain a prolonged muscular contraction. The effects of the variable lengths of testing trials reinforced these conclusions. The paretic extensor carpi radialis longus showed the greatest impairment with a very long latency to contract, and frequent failure to maintain a contraction. This study presents a new method of quantifying a common clinical problem in rehabilitation medicine.\r"

This study evaluated the follow-up functional status levels of 236 patients with traumatic SCI who completed comprehensive inpatient rehabilitation and were also followed for three years. The sample population was 83% men, with a mean age of 27.0 years. The 100-point Modified Barthel Index (MBI) was used to assess functional abilities. The 75 patients with complete quadriplegia had mean MBI scores of 30.3 at rehabilitation discharge and 37.8 at three-year follow-up. The 53 patients with incomplete quadriplegia were discharged with a mean MBI score of 53.8, and scored 68.3 at three-year follow up. The mean MBI scores for the 66 patients with complete paraplegia were 72.0 at discharge and 75.6 at three-year follow-up. The 42 patients with incomplete paraplegia had mean MBI scores of 77.0 at discharge and 86.1 at three-year follow-up. Each of the four groups demonstrated stability or increases in the proportions of patients who were independent in performance of each of the 14 MBI component tasks from discharge to follow-up. The finding that SCI patients, in this large series, maintained or improved functional levels for three years after discharge is consistent with previous studies and is reassuring to rehabilitation providers.\r"

All children displayed premature triceps surae activity beginning in swing phase of gait and continuing through stance. Tibialis posterior, normally active during stance, was also active during swing phase of gait. However, some patients displayed cocontraction of triceps surae and tibialis anterior during stance, together with hamstring muscle activity within normal limits. The remainder of the patients displayed a prolonged duration of hamstring activity. How this gait analysis contributed to presurgical decisions for equinovarus gait is discussed and compared with data from postsurgical gait analysis.\r"

Postdischarge follow-ups were performed at three months. Training consisted of twice daily aerobic exercise of 30 to 40 minutes' duration. Intensity of training was determined after exercise testing and approached the maximal limits of ventilation. In general, the program failed to demonstrate significant changes in pulmonary function. Exceptions were mid-expiratory flow rate (FEF25-75) (p less than .02) and peak flow rate (p less than .05). Evaluation of exercise capacity via maximal exercise testing yielded significant increases in caloric expenditure (p less than .001), peak exercise oxygen consumption (p less than .001), and work output (p less than .0001). Peak exercise ventilation increased significantly (p less than .005) due to an increase in tidal volume (p less than .002). Work efficiency improved with training, but the change was not statistically significant. Resting oxygen consumption and carbon dioxide production were decreased (p less than .05); tidal volume was increased (p less than .005). However, the significant increase noted in tidal volume did not alter minute ventilation. In general, the changes noted at 12 days were maintained at three months postdischarge. These data support the hypothesis that a short-term, in-hospital program of general exercise conditioning can improve work output, gas exchange, and mechanical efficiency without significantly affecting spirometric indices. These changes may translate into improved performance of activities of daily living and a sense of general well-being.\r"

Low-grade atrial and ventricular ectopy occurred in eight patients, decrease or plateauing of systolic blood pressure in three, increased diastolic blood pressure in two, and significant (greater than or equal to 1mm) ECG S-T segment displacement in one. With the use of appropriate equipment for each patient, exercise testing can be done safely and effectively in musculoskeletally handicapped individuals.\r"
