The interval from splenectomy to testing averaged 1,471 +/- 193 days (mean +/- SEM) in the ASP. Total lymphocyte count averaged 2,941 +/- 234 in the ASP with a T-cell count of 2,030 +/- 182 and a B cell count of 351 +/- 58. The average control lymphocyte count of 1,769 +/- 147 was significantly less than ASP (p less than 0.001) as were the T-cell count of 1,328 +/- 107 (p less than 0.005) and the B-cell count of 124 +/- 18 (p less than 0.001). Responses to PHA were diminished in ASP lymphocytes by 38% at 3 days (p less than 0.01) and by 49% at 5 days (p less than 0.001) when compared to C. Levels of IgM were significantly decreased (p = 0.05) in ASP. Levels of C3, C4, and C5 were similar in ASP and C. These data demonstrate persistent abnormalities in immune function in adult ASP without underlying lymphoreticular disorders and suggest a possible explanation for the increased septic risk in this patient group.\r"

During the last 5 years 34 patients were treated by vibratory and/or electrostimulation at our center, and semen was produced in all but 5. In 8 patients ejaculation was attempted by vibratory stimulation alone and in 22 electrostimulation also was used. Vibratory stimulation is the easier and less cumbersome of the 2 methods. No major side effects were noted with either technique. Stimulation was performed by a rectal electrode incorporated in a silicone finger glove with a current of 0.1 msec. in duration, a frequency of 30 Hz. and an average of 60 volts. Vibratory stimulation was applied to the frenulum and/or glans penis with a specially constructed vibrator at a frequency of 80 Hz. and a peak-to-peak oscillation of 1.6 to 2.4 mm. Semen obtained during the first 6 months after injury was not of a quality consistent with successful fertilization owing to poor motility. However, semen quality and motility were better in patients who had been injured for more than 6 months. Repeated electro-ejaculation did not improve the quality of semen. The effects of bladder outlet surgery and autonomic blockers were noted in 5 patients.\r"

The binding of antibodies to cell surface antigens was examined by a complement-dependent microcytotoxicity test and indirect immunofluorescence quantitated by flow cytometry. The phenotype of the tested NIH 3T3 cell line was H-2q, Qa-2, Ly-6.2, Thy-1.2, Ly-23.2, and 9F 3+. The expression of H-2 antigens (Kq, Dq/Lq) was lower than that in the T-lymphocytes of the B10.Q (H-2q) strain, and the expression of Qa-2 was very low. From the Ly-6 complex, the antigen Ly-m6.2A was strongly expressed, while Ly-m.6B, Ly-m.6C, and antigens ThB and H9/25 were not detected. A monoclonal antibody specific for the nonpolymorphic antigen 9F 3 brightly stained 100% of NIH 3T3 cells. Inasmuch as the NIH 3T3 immortalized cell line was developed from outbred NIH Swiss mice, a syngeneic recipient for this cell line does not exist. However, on the basis of the determined antigenic phenotype the host most compatible to NIH 3T3 cells can be selected for in vivo experiments, where an immunocompetent recipient is required. Two inbred mouse strains identical with NIH 3T3 cells in the antigens examined in this study, B10.Q and DBA/1, are of potential use for transplantation with NIH 3T3 cells.\r"

  ".W": "We contrasted the renal effects of vasopressin in Brattleboro rats with and without pretreatment with aprotinin (20,000 KIU kg-1). In both treatment groups, vasopressin injected at 3 mU kg-1 sec caused in conscious rats elevation of urine osmolality and reduction of urine flow and urinary excretion of total solutes. However, these effects of vasopressin were significantly greater in aprotinin pretreated rats than in rats without aprotinin treatment. In ketamine-pentobarbital-anesthetized rats without aprotinin pretreatment, vasopressin infused at 2 mU kg-1 hr-1 elevated urinary kinin excretion but did not affect urine flow rate or osmolality; in contrast, in aprotinin-pretreated rats, the same dose of vasopressin did not increase urinary kinins but caused elevation of urinary osmolality and reduction of urine flow, solute excretion, and glomerular filtration rate. Aprotinin pretreatment in anesthetized rats also blunted the rise in kinin excretion elicited by vasopressin at a higher dosage, 5 mU kg-1 hr-1, but did not potentiate the vasopressin-induced antidiuresis. We conclude that aprotinin facilitates the expression of the antidiuretic effect of vasopressin at a low, but not at a high dosage. This effect of aprotinin may be a consequence of: renal kallikrein inhibition which prevents augmentation of renal kinins in response to increased vasopressin levels, or other unrecognized properties of aprotinin.\r"

Twenty-four biopsies with no significant glomerular proliferation on optical microscopy, thirty-two with only endocapillary hypercellularity, and twenty-one with extra capillary crescentic glomerular disease were studied. Few intra-glomerular leucocytes were seen in the non-proliferative group. In contrast, when compared with this group, biopsies with glomerular hypercellularity and particularly those with crescents showed increased numbers of intra-glomerular total leucocytes and monocytes/macrophages, as well as an excess of T lymphocytes and T cytotoxic/suppressor cells; T helper/inducer lymphocytes were significantly increased only in the crescentic group. Only small numbers of B lymphocytes and NK cells were found in all groups. The numbers of total glomerular T-cells and monocytes per glomerular cross section were highly correlated in the crescentic group. Only idiopathic IgA nephropathy failed to show a significant increase in the numbers of intra-glomerular leucocytes, in comparison with the non-proliferative group, Henoch-Schonlein purpura biopsies in contrast had an excess of both monocytes and T cell subsets. The finding of T lymphocytes as well as monocytes in glomeruli of proliferative nephritis suggests that cellular immune mechanisms may play a role in their pathogenesis, especially when crescents are present.\r"

A potent inhibitor of lymphocyte blastogenesis was frequently demonstrable not only in patients with active minimal change nephropathy as has been previously described, but also in other forms of GN. The inhibitor was resistant to heating and prolonged storage but rendered ineffective by normal serum. We have been able to show for the first time, using gel filtration, that normal serum also contains the inhibitor. The inhibitor was shown to be highly avid for a receptor on leucocytes as judged by dose response experiments and by the ability of cell pellets to remove this activity. Gel filtration demonstrated a molecular weight in the range 60 to 160 kilodaltons. The combination of information regarding the biological properties of the inhibitor, its clinical occurrence and molecular weight suggests it to be distinct from any other well-described lymphotoxin. It's presence in normal serum in association with a self-regulatory factor and the known proclivity of minimal change nephropathy patients to infection, also indicate that the inhibitor may play an important role in immunoregulation.\r"

Another mechanism to explain the occurrence of some cases of \"iatrogenic\" air embolism has also been presented: introduction of air into the ascending aorta while cardioplegic solution is being injected through peripherally attached bypass grafts. Air trapped in these grafts or in the coronary artery itself may propagate proximally as well as distally in the coronary arteries and may reach the aortic root even if the left side of the heart is left unvented. These mechanisms may be responsible for heretofore unexplained cases of \"iatrogenic\" air embolization. We recommend careful purging of air, which may be present, from the left ventricle and aortic root every time before the aortic cross-clamp is removed during coronary operations.\r"

The time interval between the onset of symptoms and reperfusion was 169 +/- 80 minutes. Quantitative assessment of postoperative thallium 201 myocardial scans in 19 patients revealed a significant salvage of myocardium after surgical reperfusion: The size of the residual infarction was less than 50% of that in a matched, medically treated, prospective control group (n = 39) (p less than 0.05). Postoperative equilibrium-gated radionuclide blood pool studies (technetium 99m) showed an enhanced recovery of regional and global ejection fraction after operation as compared to after medical treatment (p less than 0.05). Ultrastructural evaluation of biopsy specimens obtained during the operation delineated subendocardial necrosis in the majority of cases (72%), but subepicardial necrosis was found in only 6% of instances. Q-wave abnormalities were observed on the postoperative electrocardiogram in 50% of cases. Operative mortality was 0% in low-risk patients (i.e., hemodynamically stable condition, n = 26) and 18% in high-risk patients (i.e., cardiogenic shock including total electromechanical dysfunction, n = 22). Survival rate at 18 months was 92% +/- 4%, and 95% +/- 4% of the survivors were event free. It is concluded that early surgical reperfusion of evolving myocardial infarction limits infarct size significantly, enhances functional recovery, and may be a lifesaving operation in patients having cardiogenic shock associated with unsuccessful resuscitation.\r"

The VsER was altered and later disappeared in three cats, and in one cat it became asymmetric, typical of a unilateral vestibular lesion. In all cats the ABR was unaffected and remained normal through the end of the experiment 4 months later. Histopathological examination of the temporal bones of three cats showed severe damage to the vestibular end-organ, particularly in the summit of the cristae, but in lesser amounts in the hair cells on the slopes of the cristae and in the maculae. In one cat, the pathological condition was greater in one ear, corresponding to the asymmetry in the VsER records. This new method of inducing and recording the VsER has been demonstrated by the present study to be an effective tool for experimentally assessing vestibular end-organ and nerve function in animal models. Furthermore, these results indicate that the VsER is generated in the vestibular labyrinth, most probably by the cristae of the semicircular canals.\r"

  ".W": "In 18 of 20 patients with psychosis secondary to systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), autoantibodies to ribosomal P proteins were detected by immunoblotting and measured with a new radioimmunoassay using a synthetic peptide as antigen. The frequency of anti-P was not increased in patients with other central nervous system manifestations of SLE (3 of 20, by radioimmunoassay), in patients with transient behavioral abnormalities due to SLE (none of 8), in patients with psychosis who did not have SLE (none of 13), or in normal controls (none of 20). In four of five paired serum samples, anti-P-peptide antibody levels increased 5-fold to 30-fold during the active phase of lupus psychosis. Longitudinal studies of anti-P activity in two patients with psychosis revealed that anti-P levels increased before and during the active phases of psychosis but not during sepsis or other exacerbations of SLE, and that the elevations were selective for anti-P antibodies, as opposed to anti-DNA antibodies. Longitudinal studies of anti-P activity in two patients with anti-P but without psychosis showed less than threefold changes in anti-P levels despite exacerbations of disease. We conclude that anti-P is associated with lupus psychosis and that synthetic peptide antigens may be useful for the detection and measurement of autoantibodies to intracellular proteins.\r"

Here we report evidence that in B lymphocytes, cyclic-cAMP-generating signal transduction pathways can activate translocation of PKC from the cytosol to the nucleus. Elevated cAMP levels and translocation of PKC to the nucleus are induced by antibodies against Ia antigens in normal B lymphocytes. Further, cAMP analogues mediate the translocation of PKC to the nucleus of these cells. These findings suggest that in physiological situations, ligation of B-lymphocyte Ia molecules by helper T cells leads to increased cAMP production which in turn causes PKC translocation to the nucleus. In view of recent observations that antibodies against Ia antigens induce differentiation of B cells, we conclude that nuclear PKC may function in the regulation of gene expression.\r"

  ".W": "In prokaryotes, the degree of supercoiling of DNA can profoundly influence the use of specific promoters. In eukaryotes, a variety of indirect observations suggest that DNA topology has a similar importance in proper gene expression. Much attention has therefore been focused on the cellular proteins that control DNA supercoiling, among which are the enzymes topoisomerase I and II. A hexadecameric sequence functions as a strong attraction site for topoisomerase I. Here we report that the interaction of topoisomerase I with this sequence motif is highly specific, because a single base-pair substitution prevents strand cleavage and thereby catalytic activity at the sequence. Thus, supercoiled DNA containing the recognition sequence is relaxed preferentially by topoisomerase I compared to a control, but no difference in the relaxation rate is observed for supercoiled DNA carrying the mutated sequence. The preference for the recognition sequence seems to be an intrinsic property of all eukaryotic type I topoisomerases, suggesting that the interaction might be important in a fundamental biological process.\r"

  ".W": "The precise molecular structure of the antigenic determinant recognized by the T-cell receptor of the CD4-positive cell has not been completely resolved. A major advance in our understanding of this issue has been made by our demonstration of a direct association between an immunogenic peptide and a purified Ia molecule. The most likely and economical hypothesis is that antigen binds directly to an Ia molecule creating the antigenic determinant and that this antigen-Ia complex is recognized by the T-cell receptor. We examined in detail a determinant of hen egg-white lysozyme (HEL) contained in the tryptic fragment HEL(46-61), recognized by T cells in H-2k strains of mice. This peptide binds with a Kd of approximately 3 microM to I-Ak molecules. We have already ascertained that (1) the 10-mer HEL(52-61) is the shortest stimulatory peptide; (2) the Leu56 residue, the only residue different from mouse lysozyme, is responsible for the immunogenicity; (3) the Leu56 and Tyr53 residues are critical for recognition by the T-cell receptor and (4) HEL(46-61) generates multiple determinants when it associated with the I-Ak molecule. If antigen and Ia interact, the antigen must have two features: it must bind to an Ia molecule and also interact with the T-cell receptor. The two sites do not appear to be laterally separable in this peptide and are therefore probably composed of distinct but interspersed amino-acid residues. We have now identified the three residues of HEL(52-61) that contact the T-cell receptor and three other residues that contact the I-Ak molecule. From modelling studies we also propose that HEL(52-61) assumes an alpha-helical conformation as it is bound to I-Ak and recognized by the T-cell receptor.\r"

It includes such functionally important members as the immunoglobulins themselves, major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I and class II and T-cell receptor (TCR) molecules. Several members of this superfamily are expressed on lymphocytes where they are membrane-bound and capable of interactions with other members of the family, thus taking part in cell-cell recognition. In screening mouse cytolytic-T-cell-derived cDNA libraries, we came across cDNA clones defining a sequence, CTLA-4, which could encode a 223-amino-acid protein clearly belonging to the immunoglobulin superfamily. It consists of one V-like domain flanked by two hydrophobic regions, one of which has a structure suggestive of membrane anchoring. CTLA-4 is mainly expressed in activated lymphocytes and is coinduced with T-cell-mediated cytotoxicity in inducible models of this process. The mouse ctla-4 gene maps to band C of chromosome 1.\r"

Previously we have shown that the pseudoautosomal gene MIC2 only rarely recombines between the sex chromosomes and, based on the elevated recombination rates in the pseudoautosomal region, we predicted that this gene would lie close to the Y-specific region. In this report we describe a test of this prediction using long-range restriction mapping techniques. We conclude that MIC2 is less than 200 kilobases (kb) away from Y-specific sequences. During these experiments we have identified an HTF island in a position consistent with the proposed location of the human sex determining gene.\r"

Recombinant HIV-vaccinia viruses were used to express HIV antigens in B-cell lines established from subjects seropositive for HIV and seronegative controls. Circulating lymphocytes capable of killing HIV env-expressing autologous B cells were detected in eight of eight seropositive subjects; in addition, at least three seropositive subjects demonstrated gag-specific cytotoxic responses. No HIV-specific cytotoxicity was observed in seronegative subjects. Selective inhibition of the env-specific cytotoxicity by a CD3-specific monoclonal antibody indicates that the effectors are T cells. This demonstration of a cytotoxic T-cell immune response to HIV in infected individuals should prove useful in investigating the immunopathogenesis of HIV infection further and in evaluating AIDS vaccine strategies.\r"

Functional, HIV-specific CTL are obtained by broncho-alveolar lavage (BAL) from the lungs of seropositive patients with lymphocytic alveolitis. These alveolar CTL: (1) recognize and kill HIV-infected alveolar macrophages in vitro under autologous, but not heterologous, conditions; (2) correspond to standard CTL as they express the CD3 and CD8 surface markers, but not the CD4 marker; and (3) are restricted by class I HLA transplantation antigens in their cytotoxic activities.

Amniotic fluid was collected from patients with intra-amniotic infection and from matched control women. In addition to media for aerobes, anaerobes, and mycoplasmas, we used V agar-selective (Remel, Lenexa, KS) to isolate G vaginalis. Acute and convalescent maternal sera were collected and assayed for antibodies by a microenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) prepared against whole cells of G vaginalis. Gardnerella vaginalis was isolated in the amniotic fluid of 24 (28%) of the 86 patients with intra-amniotic infection, but this was not significantly different from the isolation rate in amniotic fluid of 86 matched controls (21%). No patient exhibited G vaginalis bacteremia. The ELISA performed on paired sera of selected patients showed that 25 had intra-amniotic infection (eight G vaginalis-positive, 17 negative), and 18 were asymptomatic (seven G vaginalis-positive, 11 negative). The amount of G vaginalis antibodies detected by ELISA in acute sera was similar in all four groups. Mean changes during convalescence were small (.053-.084 optical density units) and not significantly different. Although G vaginalis is found commonly in amniotic fluid of patients with intra-amniotic infection, the data do not support a pathogenic role for this organism; however, a facilitating role in polymicrobial infection cannot be excluded.\r"

An infusion of balanced salt solution through a limbal infusion cannula was employed during vitrectomy and also during drainage of suprachoroidal blood. The simultaneous intravitreal infusion helped to create an efficient, controlled choroidal drainage procedure. In addition to relieving vitreoretinal traction, this technique helps prevent the periods of extreme hypotony experienced when choroidal drainage and anterior chamber reformation are accomplished serially in step-wise fashion. This use of this method also obviates the compromised view of the peripheral retina which occurs when air is introduced into the vitreous cavity.\r"

Patients with septic shock, meningitis, or epiglottitis were excluded. Of 576 patients, 16 had pneumococcal bacteremia (final diagnoses: primary bacteremia, nine; otitis media, four; pneumonia, two; unknown, one), and five had H influenzae b bacteremia (final diagnoses: primary bacteremia, two; cellulitis, two; arthritis, one). Latex agglutination was positive in all five patients with H influenzae b bacteremia (positive in three of three urine specimens, three of four sera tested) but only one of 16 patients with pneumococcal bacteremia (positive in one of seven urine samples, zero of 13 sera tested). Both assays had specificities of greater than 95%. Nonspecific agglutination occurred in 7% of specimens tested. Enzyme immunoassay for pneumococcal antigen, although more sensitive than latex agglutination, failed to detect antigen in ten sera and three urine specimens from patients with pneumococcal bacteremia. Thus, neither latex agglutination nor enzyme immunoassay was sufficiently sensitive for detection of occult pneumococcal bacteremia. Latex agglutination for H influenzae b holds promise as a sensitive and specific test for rapid diagnosis of occult bacteremia due to H influenzae b.\r"

  ".W": "A series of overlapping cosmid genomic clones have been isolated that contain the entire coding unit of the human gene for von Willebrand factor (vWf), a major component of the hemostatic system. The cloned segments span approximately 175 kilobases of human DNA sequence, and hybridization analysis suggests that the vWf coding unit is approximately 150 kilobases in length. Within one of these clones, the vWf transcription initiation site has been mapped and a portion of the vWf promoter region has been sequenced, revealing a typical \"TATA box,\" a downstream \"CCAAT box,\" and a perfect downstream repeat of the 8 base pairs containing the transcription start site. Sequencing of a segment of another genomic clone has revealed the vWf translation termination codon. Where tested, comparative restriction analysis of cloned and chromosomal DNA segments strongly suggests that no major alterations occurred during cloning and that there is only one complete copy of the vWf gene in the human haploid genome. Similar analyses of DNA from vWf-producing endothelial cells and nonexpressing leukocytes suggest that vWf gene expression is not accompanied by gross genomic rearrangements. In addition, there is significant homology of C-terminal coding sequences among the vWf genes of several vertebrate species.\r"

The DNA digests fall into three distinct patterns based on the presence and intensity of an extra 1.1-kilobase Pst I band. The extra 1.1-kilobase band is present in 9 of 27 placenta samples, and in 1 of these samples the extra band is present at double intensity. No polymorphism was revealed by digestion with restriction enzymes EcoRI, Sma I, BamHI, or Sac I. The extra Pst I-digestion site may lie in a noncoding region of the gene because no correlation was observed between the restriction fragment length polymorphism and the common placental alkaline phosphatase alleles identified by starch gel electrophoresis. In addition, because placental alkaline phosphatase is frequently re-expressed in neoplasms, we examined tissue from ovarian, testicular, and endometrial tumors and from BeWo choriocarcinoma cells in culture. The Pst I-DNA digestion patterns from these cells and tissues were identical to those seen in the normal ovary and term placentae. The consistent reproducible digestion patterns seen in DNA from normal and tumor tissue indicate that a major gene rearrangement is not the basis for the ectopic expression of placental alkaline phosphatase in neoplasia.\r"

Although the structure and sequence of the corresponding gene show nonhomology with the IFN-beta gene, the gene is identical to that of B-cell stimulatory factor 2, a human interleukin, and displays a very potent growth and differentiation factor activity for B lymphocytes. In this work we show that IL-1 beta and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) strongly induce the 26-kDa protein in FS-4 fibroblasts and in some transformed cell lines. Addition of cycloheximide to recombinant (r)IL-1 beta and rTNF further enhances the level of 26-kDa-protein mRNA. We determined the kinetics of induction and the amounts of rTNF and rIL-1 beta required for optimal induction of this mRNA in FS-4 cells and in HeLa H21 cells and found that rIL-1 beta is a more efficient inducer of 26-kDa protein mRNA than is TNF. By analyzing the inducibility of the 26-kDa protein gene by rTNF and rIL-1 beta in a series of transformed cell lines that differ in their sensitivity to the cytotoxic action of TNF, we report a direct correlation between the 26-kDa protein mRNA expression and the resistance of these cells to the cytotoxic effect of TNF.\r"

In order to investigate how the expression of class I antigens affects the in vivo growth of this spontaneous tumor, H-2Dp genes were transferred into line 1 cells. Cloned transfectants that displayed H-2Dp surface antigens were identified using flow cytometry. The transfected H-2Dp antigens appeared normal by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and could also function as excellent targets for T-cell-mediated lysis in vitro. Marked differences in tumorigenicity (defined as tumor growth in immunologically competent hosts) were observed between the Dp transfected cells and untransfected or control transfected line 1 cells in syngeneic mice only if the animals had previously received injections of irradiated Dp transfectants. Expression of Dp antigens did not appreciably affect the growth of line 1 tumors in immunologically naive syngeneic mice or necessarily cause rejection in allogeneic mice. Our in vivo results show that increased expression of class I antigens can reduce the growth of tumors like line 1 that lack all class I antigens. Our results also suggest that increasing class I antigens alone on some spontaneous tumors deficient in expression will not by itself be sufficient for tumor rejection.\r"

We previously found that EBV-negative and EBV-carrying BL lines derived from HLA-A11-positive donors were not only resistant to lysis by the HLA-A11-restricted CTL generated by stimulation with the autologous LCL, but also to HLA-A11-specific CTL derived from lymphocytes of an EBV-seronegative donor stimulated with an allogeneic LCL. Using the same and additional cell lines, we now show that the CTL resistance of the BL lines is probably due to a selective down-regulation of HLA-A11. We also show that the EBV-encoded latent membrane protein is expressed at a lower level in the EBV-carrying BL lines than in EBV-transformed LCLs. Only one of eight in vitro EBV-converted BL lines that shifted to a more LCL-like growth pattern expressed LMP at a high level. This line also reexpressed the HLA-A11 antigen that was undetectable in its EBV-negative progenitor. Our findings suggest that the typical BL cell phenotype is associated with low expression of both proteins.\r"

It is of importance to define the active sites of these molecules in order to understand their receptor interactions and the mechanisms involved in their multiple biological functions. We report here the localization of the biologically active portions within the initial polypeptide translation products. An in vitro transcription and translation system was used to generate specific fragments of each of the IL-1 molecules, which then were assayed for receptor binding capability and biological activity. Using this system, we have demonstrated that core sequences of amino acids for IL-1 beta (numbers 120-266) and 140 amino acids for IL-1 alpha (numbers 128-267) must be left intact to retain full biological activity and further that the biological activities of the IL-1 polypeptides parallel their receptor binding capabilities.\r"

  ".W": "T-cell-replacing factor (TRF) is a T-cell-derived factor required for terminal differentiation of activated B cells to immunoglobulin-secreting cells. Previous studies have shown that a murine T-cell hybrid (B151K12) produces factor(s) that (i) induce immunoglobulin secretion by the B-cell leukemia line BCL1 and secondary anti-2,4-dinitrophenyl IgG synthesis in vitro by dinitrophenyl-primed B cells (TRF activity) and (ii) cause proliferation of the BCL1 cells [B-cell growth factor II (BCGF-II) activity]. Both activities appear to be associated with the same molecule. Here we report the production of a monoclonal antibody to murine TRF. The monoclonal antibody, designated TB13, strongly inhibited both TRF and BCGF-II activities and absorbed TRF- as well as BCGF-II-active molecules produced by B151K12 and by Xenopus oocytes that had been injected with mRNA transcribed from plasmid pSP6K-mTRF23. Inhibition was linearly dependent on the concentration of both TB13 and TRF. Monoclonal antibody TB13 did not inhibit the activities of B-cell stimulatory factor 1, interleukin 1, interleukin 2, or interleukin 3. TRF activity in dissolved samples of immunoprecipitates obtained with TB13 was recovered after NaDodSO4/PAGE, in the fractions corresponding to a protein band at Mr 46,000. Our results indicate that monoclonal antibody TB13 recognizes a molecule that has both TRF and BCGF-II activities.\r"

These subtypes included Dw2, Dw12, and non-Dw2/non-Dw12. Analysis by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis showed that two DR beta genes were expressed in each cell line studied. One of these expressed genes encoded a protein that was nonpolymorphic on two-dimensional gel electrophoresis among all subtypes. The second expressed DR beta gene was polymorphic and migrated to a position on two-dimensional gels dependent on the subtype of the cell line. cDNA sequence analysis of the DR beta genes revealed a DR beta gene identical between the Dw2 and Dw12 subtypes, which correlates with the nonpolymorphic spot on two-dimensional gels. A second gene was sequenced that exhibited variability between the Dw2 and Dw12 subtypes. This variability takes the form of clustered point mutations in the first domain of the molecules. The alleles from the DR beta genes of a non-Dw2/non-Dw12 cell line, AZH, were unusual in sequence. In contrast to other DR beta alleles, the AZH genes may have been generated by a double recombinational event between two DR beta loci from a DR2 parent. The DR2 serotype may also constitute a supertypic \"family,\" with one DR beta gene relatively nonpolymorphic, and one that varies with Dw subtype.\r"

Multiple locally elaborated factors have been identified that appear to influence the cellular events in bone remodeling. The possible role(s) of these factors in the pathogenesis of osteoporosis is unknown. One such factor, interleukin 1 (IL-1), is of particular interest, as this protein is known to stimulate bone resorption and perhaps formation. Consequently, we have measured the spontaneous secretion of IL-1 activity by cultured peripheral blood monocytes obtained from 22 osteoporotic patients and 14 age-matched control subjects. Monocytes from osteoporotic patients produced more IL-1 than did monocytes from control subjects. When patients were grouped according to monocyte-produced IL-1 activity, dynamic parameters of bone formation, as judged by quantitative histomorphometric analysis of iliac crest bone biopsies and by circulating levels of bone 4-carboxyglutamic acid protein (BGP)--a marker of bone formation--were higher in subjects with elevated IL-1 activity; whereas, indices of bone resorption and static indices of bone formation were similar in subjects with either high or normal IL-1 activity. IL-1 activity released by peripheral blood monocytes appears to reflect bone formation rate in osteoporotic patients and may be of pathogenetic significance in a subset of individuals with osteoporosis.\r"

Because the cell lines under investigation grow very slowly and have poor plating efficiencies in unconditioned medium, an assay was developed that relies on cell proliferation rather than colony formation as a measure of toxicity. This approach is easily generalized to provide a rapid and inexpensive assay of drug competition. Two-dimensional studies indicate that methotrexate and BW301U show differences in patterns of toxicity, competition, and rescue by folinic acid, suggesting that the two drugs act on different targets. Further applications of the microtiter assay to the analysis of multidrug interactions are discussed.\r"

The B-cell parent, the 6-thioguanine- and ouabain-resistant mutant GM1500, is a lymphoblastoid cell line that secretes IgG2, kappa chains, and expresses B1, B532, and HLA class I and II antigens. All hybrids expressed characteristics of B cells (Ig+, B1+, B532+, EBNA+, HLA antigens), whereas only CD4 among the T-cell markers was expressed. The level of T-cell receptor beta-chain transcript was greatly reduced and no RNA of the chimeric T-cell receptor alpha-chain joining segment-immunoglobulin heavy-chain variable region was detected. Southern blot analysis indicated that absence of T-cell differentiation markers in the hybrids was not due to chromosomal loss. Rather, some B-cell-specific factor present in the hybrids may account for the suppression.\r"

Data from the various combinations of Id and anti-Id (and anti-isotype) were used to construct a low-resolution three-dimensional model that revealed not only the approximate locations of Ids on the surface of the antibody variable domains but also details of the geometry of Id-anti-Id interactions not otherwise available. The Ids were shown to be dispersed over the variable domains, extending from the complementarity-determining region to near the variable-constant switch region. Thus, immunoelectron microscopy is a useful complement to serologic, biochemical, and genetic strategies for the topographical analysis of immunoglobulin Ids or other epitopes. This same approach should be of broader applicability in the study of epitopes and receptor sites on other macromolecules.\r"

Regulatory effects of these high titers of anti-IgE can now be investigated. Such studies will be facilitated by the availability of monoclonal, syngeneic anti-IgE antibodies.\r"

  ".W": "Major histocompatibility complex-restricted and alloreactive cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) can discriminate between the HLA-A3.1 and HLA-A3.2 antigens. HLA-A3.1 and the rare variant HLA-A3.2 have been shown to differ by two amino acids in the alpha 2 domain at positions 152 (A3.1, glutamic acid; A3.2, valine) and 156 (A3.1, leucine; A3.2, glutamine). To determine the structural basis for the ability of CTL to differentiate A3.1 from A3.2, two site-directed mutants of the HLA-A3.2 gene were produced, 152A3.1-156A3.2 and 152A3.2-156A3.1, that have the indicated codons for positions 152 and 156. These mutated HLA-A3 genes, as well as the nonmutated HLA-A3.1 and HLA-A3.2 genes, were then transfected into the murine cell line P815-HTR and used as targets for human CTL. Influenza virus-specific HLA-A3.1-restricted CTL lysed virus-infected P815 cells transformed with the HLA-A3.1 and 152A3.1-156A3.2 genes, but not P815 cells transformed with the HLA-A3.2 and 152A3.2-156A3.1 genes. HLA-A3.2-allospecific CTL lysed the P815 cells transformed with the HLA-A3.2 and 152A3.2-156A3.1 genes but did not lyse P815 cells transformed with the HLA-A3.1 or 152A3.1-156A3.2 genes. Thus, a single amino acid change at position 152, substituting valine for glutamic acid and thereby introducing a charge difference, produces major structural changes in the epitopes recognized by major histocompatibility complex-restricted and alloreactive CTL.\r"

The immunoglobulins secreted by these cell lines reacted variably with a panel of anti-idiotypic antibodies, indicating that the tumor was heterogeneous; however, one antibody, 4D6, reacted strongly with the product of all the heterohybridomas. cDNA for the immunoglobulin heavy chain variable-region genes expressed in these heterohybridomas was cloned and sequenced. Comparison of these sequences indicated that the cells expressing them were clonally related but that they had undergone considerable mutation. Despite mutation, the cells in this tumor population continued to express a functional immunoglobulin molecule and to retain, over a span of 3 years, the idiotypic determinant defined by the 4D6 monoclonal antibody. Thus a selective force existed within the host to retain tumor cells bearing an immunoglobulin molecule with a particular idiotypic structure.\r"

As a consequence of the gene overlap, the termination/polyadenylylation signal for the 22K gene is located at nucleotides 56-68 within the L gene. L-gene transcription yielded two RNAs: an abundant, truncated, polyadenylylated transcript resulting from termination at the internal signal and a markedly less abundant large polyadenylylated transcript representing the complete L gene. This result showed that the internal termination/polyadenylylation signal is an attenuator of L-gene transcription.\r"

The sequence of the mature protein suggests that there are three distinct domains: extracellular, residues 1-219; hydrophobic, residues 220-242; and cytoplasmic, residues 243-263. Three potential N-linked carbohydrate attachment sites occur in the extracellular domain.

Two overlapping genomic clones containing sequences encoding human factor VII were isolated and characterized. The complete sequence of the gene was determined and found to span about 12.8 kilobases. The mRNA for factor VII as demonstrated by cDNA cloning is polyadenylylated at multiple sites but contains only one AAUAAA poly(A) signal sequence. The mRNA can undergo alternative splicing, forming one transcript containing eight segments as exons and another with an additional exon that encodes a larger prepro leader sequence. The latter transcript has no known counterpart in the other vitamin K-dependent proteins. The positions of the introns with respect to the amino acid sequence encoded by the eight essential exons of factor VII are the same as those present in factor IX, factor X, protein C, and the first three exons of prothrombin. These exons code for domains generally conserved among members of this gene family. The comparable introns in these genes, however, are dissimilar with respect to size and sequence, with the exception of intron C in factor VII and protein C. The gene for factor VII also contains five regions made up of tandem repeats of oligonucleotide monomer elements. More than a quarter of the intron sequences and more than a third of the 3' untranslated portion of the mRNA transcript consist of these minisatellite tandem repeats.\r"

The polypeptide chain of the protein is arranged into two distinct domains. The structures of these domains were determined independently in separate calculations and then combined to obtain an overall view of the protein. The backbone fold thus determined includes the regular backbone structure elements that were previously identified using different techniques for the analysis of the nuclear magnetic resonance data.

Functional analysis of recombinant viruses shows that the host-range expansion of PCMV is a property of nucleotide changes within the U3 region of the long terminal repeat. Furthermore, expression assays of chimeric long terminal repeats show that the enhancer region of PCMV joined to the promoter region of Moloney murine leukemia virus is sufficient to direct the synthesis of chloramphenicol acetyltransferase in F9 and PCC4 cells.\r"

To characterize the genetic lesions occurring in spontaneous C15 mutants, we molecularly cloned the homolog of the C. elegans unc-22 gene from wild-type P. redivivus and two strains carrying spontaneous mutations in this gene. One of these mutations resulted from the insertion of a 4.8-kilobase segment of repetitive DNA. This repetitive element (PAT-1) varies in copy number (10-50 copies) and location in different P. redivivus strains and is absent from C. elegans. The element could be useful as a transformation vector for C. elegans. Our approach is a general one that could be used to isolate additional nematode transposons from other species.\r"

We observed that, in mouse LTK- cells, intrachromosomal recombination between type 1 and type 2 tk sequences is reduced by a factor of at least 1000 relative to the rate of intrachromosomal recombination between homologous type 1 tk sequences. In sharp contrast, the rate of intermolecular or intramolecular extrachromosomal recombination between the heterologous tk sequences introduced by calcium phosphate or microinjection was reduced only by a factor of 3 to 15 compared with extrachromosomal homologous tk crosses. Our results suggest differences between the mechanisms of extrachromosomal and intrachromosomal recombination in mammalian cells.\r"

Immunologic parameters were analyzed by the Guttman scalogram technique to determine if immunologic abnormalities occurred in a nonrandom pattern. The following four patterns emerged: (i) seropositivity for HIV with no immunologic abnormalities; (ii) seropositivity for HIV with a depressed T4/T8 cell ratio; (iii) seropositivity with a depressed T4/T8 cell ratio and T4-cell depletion; and (iv) seropositivity with a depressed T4/T8 cell ratio, T4-cell depletion, and lymphopenia. Ninety-two to 100% of subjects in each of the three groups of patients were found \"to scale\" because the abnormalities occurred in the cumulative, ordered fashion described. This nonrandom occurrence of abnormalities indicates an ordered progression of immunologic abnormalities in individuals infected with HIV, a finding useful in the staging of both symptomatic and asymptomatic HIV-seropositive subjects.\r"

For human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) cloned DNA carrying three open reading frames (sor, tat, and 3'-orf), the approach yielded three authentic polypeptides. Clearly, the internal initiation codons can be used for reinitiation of translation of the downstream open reading frames. However, the downstream open reading frames were translated with relatively lower translational efficiencies. In general, the translational efficiency of RNAs depended significantly on their structures. The in vitro approach was utilized further to map the immunoreactive domains of the 3'-orf and sor gene products of HIV. Deletion clones were constructed with deletions within the open reading frames. Translation products of these clones reacted differentially with anti-3'-orf and anti-sor rabbit immune sera and human sera from individuals with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome and related disorders. Apparently, recombinant 3'-orf and sor polypeptides used to immunize rabbits express many more immunogenic epitopes and/or different set of epitopes than is the case for the native proteins in humans infected with HIV. Immunoreactivity and immunogenicity of these gene products were significantly dependent on their structure and/or conformation.\r"

  ".W": "Certain monoclonal antibodies specific for glycoprotein D of herpes simplex virus have potent neutralizing activity but fail to block attachment of virus to cells. Here we have investigated the fate of neutralized and infectious virus after attachment to primate cells. Infectious virions fused with the cell surface such that naked nucleocapsids were detectable in the cytoplasm near or just under the plasma membrane. Neutralized virions did not fuse with the cell. They remained attached to the cell surface and could be rendered infectious by treatment with polyethylene glycol. We conclude that some anti-glycoprotein D neutralizing antibodies can inhibit the penetration of herpes simplex virus by blocking fusion of the virion envelope with the plasma membrane. These results identify a pathway of entry that initiates successful herpes simplex virus infection and a step in this pathway that is highly sensitive to neutralizing antibodies. A role for glycoprotein D in virion-cell fusion is indicated.\r"

The study group consisted of 26 consecutive patients referred for evaluation of liver lesions. A total of 23 cavernous hemangiomas were found, all of which showed decreased or normal flow and delayed uptake of the radiotracer. SPECT demonstrated 13 hemangiomas that were not detected with planar imaging; both modalities demonstrated the other ten lesions. Lesions that were not cavernous hemangiomas showed either normal (n = 6) or increased (n = 4) flow; none had delayed increased uptake on either planar or SPECT images. SPECT with labeled red blood cells is an accurate method for the detection of cavernous hemangiomas of the liver and is more sensitive than planar imaging in depicting small lesions.\r"

Four meningiomas followed for 3-5 years after PET-FDG and surgery showed no evidence of recurrence. These tumors had significantly lower glucose utilization rates (1.9 mg/dl/min +/- 1.0) than 11 recurrent or regrowing meningiomas (4.5 mg/dl/min +/- 1.96) (P less than .01). The glucose metabolic rates of meningiomas correlated with tumor growth, as estimated from changes in tumor size on repeated computed tomographic scans. Histopathologically, a syncytial (atypical) meningioma had the highest glucose utilization rate, followed by a papillary meningioma and an angioblastic meningioma. Individual transitional and syncytial (typical) meningiomas showed marked differences in glucose metabolism despite similar microscopic appearance. Glucose utilization rate appears to be at least as reliable as histologic classification and other proposed criteria for predicting the behavior and recurrence of intracranial meningiomas.\r"

Sixteen of 40 retinoblastomas examined with a complementary DNA probe shown to be the Rb gene had identifiable structural changes of the Rb gene including in some cases homozygous internal deletions with corresponding truncated transcripts. An osteosarcoma also had a homozygous internal deletion with a truncated transcript. In addition, possible hot spots for deletion were identified within the Rb genomic locus. Among those tumors with no identifiable structural changes there was either absence of an Rb transcript or abnormal expression of the Rb transcript. Comparison of the structural changes in the tumor cells and fibroblasts of certain patients provided support for Knudson's two-hit hypothesis for the development of retinoblastoma at the molecular level. The ability to detect germline structural deletions in fibroblasts from some patients with bilateral retinoblastoma also indicates that the isolated gene is useful for diagnostic purposes.\r"

  ".W": "It has recently been shown that activation of murine T-cell hybridomas with antigen inhibits their growth in vitro. The \"suicide\" of these neoplastic T cells upon stimulation with antigen suggested the possibility that activation via the antigen-specific receptor could also inhibit the growth of neoplastic T cells in vivo. To test this, mice were subcutaneously inoculated with antigen-specific T-cell hybridomas and then treated intraperitoneally with antigen. Administration of the appropriate antigen immediately after inoculation with the T-cell hybridoma abrogated tumor formation; antigen administered after tumors had become established decreased the tumor burden and, in a substantial fraction of animals, led to long-term survival. The efficacy of antigen therapy was due to both a direct inhibitory effect on tumor growth and the induction of host immunity. These studies demonstrate the utility of cellular activation as a means of inhibiting neoplastic T-cell growth in vivo and provide a rationale for studying the use of less selective reagents that can mimic the activating properties of antigen, such as monoclonal antibodies, in the treatment of T-cell neoplasms of unknown antigen specificity.\r"

The area detector has a dynamic range of 1 to 10(5), a sensitivity about 60 times greater with approximately 1/300 as much fog background as x-ray film. It is erasable and reusable but, like film, can integrate at a practically unlimited counting rate. The high sensitivity and wide dynamic range of the detector resulted in a sufficient reduction in the exposure time to make possible the recording of a clear x-ray diffraction pattern, with up to 2.0-nanometer axial spacing, from a contracting frog skeletal muscle in as little as 10 seconds with synchrotron radiation. During the isometric contraction of the muscle, most of the actin diffraction lines increased in intensity without noticeable changes in their peak positions. Changes also occurred in diffraction intensities from the myosin heads. The results indicate that during contraction the structure of the actin filaments differs from that in the rigor state, suggesting a possible structural change in the actin subunits themselves; the myosin heads during contraction retain the axial periodicity of the myosin filament and become aligned in a more perpendicular manner to the actin filaments.\r"

A complementary DNA representing a portion of the smaller 50-kilodalton subunit of the rat brain enzyme has been cloned and sequenced. The calmodulin-binding region has been identified and a synthetic analog prepared that binds calmodulin with high affinity in the presence of calcium. Like the 50-kilodalton kinase polypeptide, the concentration of the messenger RNA varies both neuroanatomically and during postnatal development of the brain. The broad tissue and species cross-reactivity of the complementary DNA suggests that the 50-kilodalton subunit found in rat brain is evolutionarily conserved and is the product of a single gene.\r"

The purpose of comparing the 2 groups was to determine to what extent neurologic complications after heart surgery can be attributed to cardiopulmonary bypass. The 2 groups were similar with respect to age, preoperative neurologic and intellectual status, anesthetic methods, duration of operation, perioperative complications, and time spent in the intensive therapy unit. Certain potential risk factors for cerebrovascular disease were more common in the control than the coronary bypass patients. The important difference between the 2 groups was that only the latter group underwent cardiopulmonary bypass. In this group 191 of 312 (61%) and 235 of 298 (79%), respectively, developed early neurologic and neuropsychological complications. By the time of hospital discharge 17% had neurologic disability and 38% had significant neuropsychological symptoms. In the control group 9 of 50 (18%) developed neurologic complications resulting largely from trauma to lower limb sensory nerves. Two patients developed primitive reflexes. Fifteen of 48 (31%) showed neuropsychological impairment on 1 or 2 subtest scores. Moderate or severe intellectual dysfunction was not seen in the control patients in contrast to the 24% thus affected in the coronary bypass group. The difference in frequency and severity of central nervous system complications between the 2 groups is likely to reflect cerebral injury resulting from cardiopulmonary bypass.\r"

To better characterize the liver disease, all known deceased adult Swedish patients known to us with homozygous (PiZZ) AAT-deficiency, who had undergone autopsy during the 20-year period 1963-82 were reviewed. Of 94 such patients, 35 had cirrhosis (27 males and eight females) with a mean age at death of 65.5 +/- 10.5 (SD) years compared to 53.6 +/- 12.8 years (p less than 0.01) for the 59 non-cirrhotic patients. The longer survival suggests less severe lung disease in the cirrhotic group. Clinically these patients most frequently presented with ascites or other signs of portal hypertension. Evidence of alcohol overconsumption, chronic viral hepatitis, or autoimmune disease was rare. Aside from low plasma AAT levels, laboratory and other clinical features were indistinguishable from those of decompensated cirrhosis of any etiology. The prognosis was generally grave with a mean survival of two years after diagnosis. Fourteen of the 35 cirrhotics (10 males and four females) had primary liver cancer (PLC) at autopsy. We conclude that cirrhosis and PLC are more frequent complications in elderly patients with AAT-deficiency than was previously known. These complications had a marked male predominance.\r"

Infarct mass was measured from gated transverse MR images using computer-generated calculated-T2 images. T2 images provided accentuation of the boundary between infarcted and normal myocardium as well as objective, reproducible calculation of image voxels representing infarcted myocardium. Postmortem and in vivo MR infarct mass and percentage correlated closely at 3 days (r = .98, SEE = 0.73 g; r = .97, SEE = 1.2%), and 21 days (r = .94, SEE = 1.54 g; r = .95, SEE = 1.61%). Left ventricular mass, infarct mass, and percentage of infarct were measured on end-diastolic MR images. Infarct mass at 3 and 21 days was not significantly different, with a mean deviation of 0.63 g. There was close intra- and interobserver reproducibility (r = .99 and r = .90, respectively) for measurement of infarct mass. The quantitative technique employed for determining the mass of acute myocardial infarctions, based on the different T2 relaxation times of infarcted and normal myocardium, provides for objective analysis and reproducibility. With this technique, MR provides an accurate method for assessing the mass of acute infarcts and the percentage of the left ventricle involved by the infarct both early and late after coronary occlusion.\r"

  ".W": "An extremely rapid MR imaging technique is described, and its use on a new 2.0-T high-speed MR system is demonstrated. This implementation permits complete filling of the two-dimensional spatial-frequency domain (k-space) within an acquisition window of 26 msec. With this acquisition window placed under the spin-echo signal envelope generated by a 90-180 degree pulse pair, the image contrast is the same as that of a conventional spin-echo pulse sequence. Resultant proton images have a motion-independent voxel resolution of 0.08 cm3 and a signal-to-noise ratio for cardiac muscle of approximately 30:1 (for TE = 30 msec) with no signal averaging. The pulse sequence yields images that are chemical shift-resolved. The total proton density distribution is optionally presented with lipid and water signals displayed in two different colors. Cardiac function is observed by displaying multiple images, acquired at different times in successive cardiac periods, in a cyclic movie format. Such motion pictures are obtained within a single period of suspended respiration, thereby assuring freedom from respiratory related motion artifacts. As preliminary examples, we present MR images of the normal adult human heart that have total acquisition times of only 40 msec/image and that show the major cardiac anatomy. Frames from movie loops show contraction of cardiac chambers and left ventricular wall thickening. The extremely rapid acquisition time of this technique suggests that it may hold promise for the routine and cost-effective evaluation of cardiac anatomy and function.\r"

Our preliminary experience with MR imaging in five patients with vascular rings suggests that this technique is an excellent alternative to angiography when further anatomic delineation of the abnormality is required.\r"

It was proved at autopsy in one case and confirmed by a Swan-Ganz catheter delineating the lateral right atrial wall in another case. Tricuspid insufficiency of varying severity was present in all patients. Progressive bulging of the right heart border on frontal radiographs and an anterior masslike density on lateral radiographs were the important findings. The bulging right heart border was seen in all 15 patients. The anterior masslike density was noted in seven of nine patients with lateral radiographs; its upper border was sharp in four and indistinct in three. Giant right atrium may be misdiagnosed as pleural effusion, pericardial effusion, and mediastinal neoplasm. Correct diagnosis is important so that unnecessary procedures are not performed.\r"

Chest radiographs were abnormal in 73 (70%). Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia was identified at bronchoscopy or open-lung biopsy in 52 (50%). Nonspecific interstitial pneumonitis occurring in the absence of an identifiable infection was documented histologically in 36 (34%). Twenty (56%) of these 36 patients had abnormal chest radiographs. No currently recognized infectious agents were recovered from lavage fluid or were seen histopathologically in patients with nonspecific interstitial pneumonitis. The results show that nonspecific interstitial pneumonitis is clinically and radiologically indistinguishable from Pneumocystis carinii pneumonitis and should be considered in the differential diagnosis of AIDS patients with interstitial infiltrates.\r"

Thymic volumes were determined for each patient during cycles of chemotherapy and were compared with the patient's clinical status. This group included patients with Hodgkin's disease (13 patients), osteogenic sarcoma (five), testicular neoplasm (four), Wilms' tumor (three), rhabdomyosarcoma (two), malignant fibrous histiocytoma (one), and Ewing's sarcoma (one). Seven patients with mediastinal lymphoma had tumor involvement of the thymus and therefore were excluded. The 22 remaining patients showed cyclic thymic volume changes in response to chemotherapy or its discontinuance. During the first course of chemotherapy the thymic volume decreased by an average of 43% in 20 of 22 patients. Between the first and second course, regrowth was observed in all 20 of these patients. Among the six patients who received a second course of therapy, an average volume decrease of 36% was observed during the second course with regrowth again occurring during recovery from chemotherapy. Thymic rebound (regrowth 50% greater than baseline volume) occurred in five patients, three of whom were in clinical remission. The thymus appears to atrophy during the administration of chemotherapy and regrow during the recovery phase of chemotherapy in 90% of the patients studied. Thymic hyperplasia or rebound is a relatively common phenomenon occurring in 25% of patients. The size of the thymus appears to be extremely sensitive to chemotherapy.\r"

  ".W": "Conventional chest radiography poses a challenging technical problem because of its requirement for simultaneous high-contrast display and wide-latitude recording across the entire image. We developed and evaluated a method of producing chest radiographs by using a tantalum air-interspace grid for highly efficient scatter rejection, wide-latitude X-ray film for recording the low-scatter image, and a LogEtronics printer for optical unsharp masking and contrast enhancement of the recorded image (TWL technique). TWL images can be readily obtained and have excellent contrast and detail across the entire image. In comparison with a conventional technique, the TWL technique provides about a 15% improvement in image contrast in well-penetrated areas and a threefold to tenfold improvement in poorly penetrated areas. A detection study using simulated lung nodules and a chest phantom showed about 10% overall improvement in nodule detection with the TWL technique (51% vs 42%), most of which was due to improvement in detection rates in poorly penetrated areas of the chest (62% vs 26%). In well-penetrated areas, there was a decrease in detection rates (52% vs 44%) using TWL images despite measured improvements in image contrast in these areas. Possibly this was due to the observers' unfamiliarity with the reversed-contrast TWL images. Our results show the TWL technique to be valuable for improving image quality and diagnostic accuracy in chest radiography.\r"

Twenty-six patients had nonpalpable, noncalcified lesions, and a second specimen radiograph was obtained in 24 of these. In four of these cases the initial specimen radiograph failed to show the suspected lesion, and a second specimen radiograph orthogonal to the original plane of orientation of the specimen showed the lesion to be contained within the biopsied material. Although it is seldom necessary to use this technique, it may obviate a second biopsy specimen as well as reduce operative time. We found that a second orthogonal specimen radiograph provided important information in 7% of cases.\r"

Esophageal manometry was abnormal in 66 (38%), with diagnoses of nonspecific esophageal motor disorder (26), achalasia (19), nutcracker esophagus (12), diffuse esophageal spasm (seven), and scleroderma (two). Compared with manometry, radiographic sensitivities were 95% (18 of 19) for achalasia, 71% (five of seven) for diffuse esophageal spasm, and 46% (12 of 26) for nonspecific esophageal motor disorder. Nutcracker esophagus was not diagnosed specifically on the radiographic examination. Overall radiographic sensitivity was 56% (37 of 66) but increased to 89% by excluding nutcracker esophagus and nonspecific esophageal motor disorders. In 106 manometrically normal patients, radiographic specificity was 91% with 10 false-positive diagnoses of nonspecific motor disorder. We conclude that radiographic examination of the esophagus is useful in patients with dysphagia for evaluating functional esophageal abnormalities, although detection rates vary widely with the type of motor disorder.\r"

We evaluated CT scans in 32 patients who underwent radical prostatectomy to assess its role in the preoperative staging of prostatic carcinoma. Two experienced radiologists blindly interpreted CT scans of the pelvis; they looked for evidence of tumor beyond the prostatic capsule and involvement of the seminal vesicles (stage C) or involvement of pelvic lymph nodes (stage D). Sixty-four interpretations in 32 patients yielded a specificity of 75% for predicting stages A or B disease (local disease), a sensitivity of 50% for the prediction of stages C or D, and an overall accuracy of staging of 67%. Interpretation errors were due to an inability to detect lymph node metastases, errors in evaluating the seminal vesicles, and errors in interpreting densities surrounding the prostate gland. Our data suggest that CT should not be used to influence decisions concerning surgical vs nonsurgical treatment in patients with clinically staged local disease and is only useful when unsuspected metastatic nodal disease is detected.\r"

Lateral vertebral radiographs of 118 patients on maintenance hemodialysis were reviewed to assess the frequency, distribution, and rate of progression of vertebral erosions. Thirty (25%) of 118 patients showed a superficial corner erosion resembling the so-called Romanus lesion of ankylosing spondylitis. Their presence, whether at a single level or at multiple levels, did not correlate with erosive changes in the phalanges or sacroiliac joints that are known to occur in renal osteodystrophy. Vertebral erosions may progress slowly with time, but seem to have limited bearing on clinical symptoms. In two patients, however, the radiographic changes progressed dramatically, simulating an infection. Biopsy and surgical intervention were considered but not carried out because one patient declined and in the other an infected graft was identified as the source of infection. Both patients had negative scintiscans, and their subsequent clinical courses excluded infectious spondylitis. Vertebral erosions in patients on maintenance hemodialysis are frequent, and there appears to be a spectrum of changes from superficial erosions to large resorptive defects. Further diagnostic evaluation of these erosive changes appears to be warranted only rarely.\r"

Four patients had healing of their acute fractures with angulation or displacement. Stress fractures can easily be overlooked on radiographic studies in this setting and may be a source of pain that mistakenly can be attributed to malunion or nonunion. Stress fractures should be considered in patients with fractures of the lower extremity, particularly those who experience new or persistent pain or discomfort.\r"

In most cases, tears were seen as regions of increased signal intensity within the cuff on long-TR pulse sequences, although two cases simply showed an almost complete absence of normal cuff. The MR appearance of the two cases with partial tears was similar to that of full-thickness tears. Of the four cases with normal arthrograms, one case had MR findings consistent with a tear. We conclude that MR has good potential for the noninvasive diagnosis of rotator cuff tears. Its ultimate role in this diagnosis must await prospective studies comparing its accuracy with that of sonography, CT, and arthrography.\r"

  ".W": "A flying spot digital imaging unit was devised to measure skeletal length and angles. This device uses a spinning chopper wheel and fixed slit collimator in front of a conventional X-ray tube to produce a scanning pencil beam that passes through the patient and onto an electronic detector. The beam scans the patient transversely and the device moves longitudinally, creating a digital image with a skin dose of less than 2 mrad (0.02 mGy). Patients can be imaged both when upright and when recumbent. A large field of view makes it possible for the entire length of the spine or lower extremities to be included in a single image. Built-in computer algorithms are used to make measurements of skeletal lengths and angles. The accuracy of the digital device was tested by making measurements of known angles and lengths using protractors and rulers. Skeletal measurements were then made on a number of patients. Interobserver error was tested using both patient and nonpatient images. The following patient measurements were made: Cobb angle in 166 patients with scoliosis; knee joint angles in 120 patients undergoing knee surgery; lower extremity lengths in 78 patients with length inequalities; bony fragment angulation and displacement in 30 patients with healing fractures. These studies have shown the device to be accurate with low interobserver error, while delivering much lower patient dose than more conventional methods. The ability to manipulate window levels and widths enables visualization of thick and thin body parts on the same image. Our experience both in the laboratory and with patients has been encouraging, and the method appears to have several advantages over more conventional techniques.\r"

  ".W": "The type, frequency, and extent of MR signal abnormalities in Alzheimer's disease and normal aging are a subject of controversy. With a 1.5-MR unit we studied 12 Alzheimer patients, four subjects suffering from multiinfarct dementia and nine age-matched controls. Punctate or early confluent high-signal abnormalities in the deep white matter, noted in 60% of both Alzheimer patients and controls, were unrelated to the presence of hypertension or other vascular risk factors. A significant number of Alzheimer patients exhibited a more extensive smooth \"halo\" of periventricular hyperintensity when compared with controls (p = .024). Widespread deep white-matter hyperintensity (two patients) and extensive, irregular periventricular hyperintensity (three patients) were seen in multiinfarct dementia. Areas of high signal intensity affecting hippocampal and sylvian cortex were also present in five Alzheimer and two multiinfarct dementia patients, but absent in controls. Discrete, small foci of deep white-matter hyperintensity are not characteristic of Alzheimer's disease nor do they appear to imply a vascular cause for the dementing illness. The frequently observed \"halo\" of periventricular hyperintensity in Alzheimer's disease may be of diagnostic importance. High-signal abnormalities in specific cortical regions are likely to reflect disease processes localized to those structures.\r"

  ".U": "87267132\r", 
  ".W": "High-field-strength (1.5-T) MR imaging was used to evaluate 47 patients with definite multiple sclerosis and 42 neurologically normal control patients. Abnormal, multiple foci of increased signal intensity on T2-weighted images, most prominent in the periventricular white matter, were apparent in 43 of 47 MS patients and in two of 42 control patients. A previously undescribed finding of relatively decreased signal intensity most evident in the putamen and thalamus on T2-weighted images was seen in 25 of 42 MS patients and correlated with the degree of white-matter abnormality. In the normal control patients a prominently decreased signal intensity was noted in the globus pallidus, as compared with the putamen or thalamus, correlating closely with the distribution of ferric iron as determined in normal Perls'-stained autopsy brains. The decreased signal intensity (decreased T2) is due to ferritin, which causes local magnetic field inhomogeneities and is proportional to the square of the field strength. The decreased T2 in the thalamus and striatum in MS may be related to abnormally increased iron accumulation in these locales with the underlying mechanism remaining speculative.\r"

The images are affected by the presence of small amounts of naturally occurring paramagnetic substances--principally iron--that delineate the neostriatum (caudate and putamen), globus pallidus, red nucleus, substantia nigra, and dentate nucleus, primarily by a decrease in signal secondary to the T2* effect. Movement disorders are associated with either increased or decreased signal or both in these structures, depending on the pathologic process. In the initial evaluation of 113 patients with a variety of movement disorders, good correlation of imaging abnormalities can be made with a simplified schema of the extrapyramidal pathways and a system of classification of abnormal movements, parkinsonism/tremor, dystonia, chorea, myoclonus, and hemiballismus. Parkinsonisms are characterized by abnormalities of the cortico-ponto-cerebello-dentato-rubro-thalamo-cortico-spinal tract or the nigrostriatal tract. Dystonias are characterized by abnormalities of the neostriatum predominantly affecting the putamen. Choreas are also characterized by abnormalities of the neostriatum but predominantly affecting the caudate nucleus. Hemiballismus is characterized by lesions affecting the subthalamic nucleus or associated pathway.\r"

A variable appearance on T1-weighted MR images reflected the pathologic appearance of craniopharyngiomas. High intensity on T1-weighted images corresponded to high cholesterol content or presence of methemoglobin. MR was the preferred method in the evaluation of tumor extent, especially in the cavernous sinus and posterior clival region. CT was superior to MR in detecting the presence of calcification, which with the clinical history correctly suggested the diagnosis of craniopharyngioma. Both MR and CT studies are desired initially to establish the diagnosis and to evaluate tumor extent. MR was the preferred method in detecting the presence of recurrent tumor.\r"

The coexistence of these two conditions made the diagnosis of each difficult. In only three children were both diagnoses made preoperatively; in the others, the second diagnosis was either suspected at surgery or was made on postoperative uroradiologic studies. Of five children in whom the initial diagnosis was obstruction at the ureteropelvic junction, only two have needed surgery for obstruction at the ureterovesical junction. Seven children had an initial diagnosis of obstruction at the ureterovesical junction, and all required subsequent pyeloplasty to relieve coexisting obstruction at the ureteropelvic junction. Therefore, our experience suggests that when both obstructions are known to exist or are suspected preoperatively, it is advisable to repair the stenosis at the ureteropelvic junction first, as distal ureteral surgery may not be necessary.\r"

  ".W": "Of 16 patients with normal preoperative left ventricular (LV) function studied by simultaneous two-dimensional and M-mode echocardiography before and after uncomplicated cardiac surgery, M-mode interventricular septal motion remained normal in seven (group I) and was paradoxical in nine (group II) 7 to 13 days postoperatively, but was normal in all 12 patients (7 group II) studied 3 to 18 months later. An abnormal systolic increase in normalized septal curvature, the essential feature of truly paradoxical septal motion, was not observed in either group during any study period (mean = 0.92 +/- 0.08), nor were significant differences found in septal thickening, LV fractional shortening, or fractional area change. In contrast, systolic anterior motion of the LV center increased from -0.1 +/- 1.6 mm preoperatively to 4.8 +/- 2.5 mm postoperatively in group II (p less than 0.001), and the LV posterior wall motion:thickening ratio increased from 1.10 +/- 0.33 to 2.16 +/- 0.45 (p less than 0.01), but both parameters had returned to preoperative levels at the follow-up study. Both parameters remained stable in group I during all study periods. In addition, direct intraoperative M-mode recordings (n = 14) demonstrated normal septal motion in both groups before chest closure, but esophageal echocardiograms (n = 10) demonstrated exaggerated anterior systolic LV motion within 2 hours of surgery in those from group II. Thus, early after uncomplicated cardiac surgery, apparently paradoxical septal motion relative to a fixed reference point is an artifact due to exaggerated cardiac mobility that resolves with the progressive restraining effect of postoperative adhesions.\r"

Left ventricular (LV) mass was measured from contrast angiograms in 21 patients and was compared with LV mass estimated from thallium-201 tomographic studies. A comparison of angiographic mass to mass estimated from stress studies yielded an r = 0.97 (SEE = 21.6 gm) and a comparison of angiographic mass to mass determined from the redistribution images yielded r = 0.96 (SEE = 23.0 gm). Values of mass from stress and redistribution studies varied 7.3% +/- 6.7 and 8.8% +/- 9.2, respectively, when compared with values obtained by cineangiography. LV mass derived from the stress and redistribution studies were highly correlated (r = 0.97; SEE = 21.9 gm). Linear regression analysis revealed a slope of 1.06 (stress ventricular mass = 1.06 X redistribution mass - 14.9 gm). Thirteen patients had two thallium-201 SPECT studies performed approximately 1 month apart. Estimated LV mass was highly correlated when the two studies were compared (r = 0.94; SEE = 21.7 gm comparing the two stress studies; and r = 0.93, SEE = 19.4 gm for the two redistribution studies). We conclude that SPECT thallium-201 imaging can define LV mass accurately and reproducibly in normal, ischemic, or infarcted tissue.\r"

Coronary angiography revealed incomplete revascularization in 26 patients. Six of these 26 had 52 episodes of ST-segment depression during Holter monitoring and myocardial ischemia during exercise testing. Their exercise capacity was significantly lower than that of 10 other patients in whom the results of exercise testing only were positive (heart rate at 0.1 mV ST-segment depression 112 +/- 9 vs 123 +/- 15 beats/min, p less than 0.001). In the other 10 patients with incomplete myocardial revascularization the results of both investigations were negative. The graft patency rate was lower in patients with a positive response to exercise testing than in those with a negative response (52% vs 71%, p less than 0.005). Myocardial revascularization was angiographically complete in 19 patients. In 18 of these 19 patients the findings of both investigations were negative; in 1 patient Holter monitoring revealed episodes of ST-segment elevation suggestive of variant angina. Thus, after CABG for stable angina pectoris the results of Holter monitoring do not improve the sensitivity of exercise testing in identifying patients with angiographically incomplete myocardial revascularization because findings are positive only in patients with low exercise capacity. Both tests fail to show evidence of myocardial ischemia in most patients with angiographically complete myocardial revascularization.\r"

Maximal hemodynamic effects were evident between 15 and 30 minutes after drug infusion. After 2 mg/kg, heart rate decreased 9% (p less than 0.01), cardiac index 17% (p less than 0.01), LV dP/dt max 16% (p less than 0.01), stroke work index 14% (p less than 0.01) and mean aortic pressure 8% (difference not significant). Right atrial pressure increased 8% (not significant), pulmonary arterial wedge pressure 24% (p less than 0.01) and systemic vascular resistance 17% (p less than 0.01). After administering 4 mg/kg of bepridil the changes in heart rate, cardiac index, right atrial pressure, LV dP/dt max, mean aortic pressure and systemic vascular resistance were almost identical to those after the smaller dose. The larger dose produced a 40% (p less than 0.01) increase in pulmonary arterial wedge pressure and a 22% decrease in stroke work index (p less than 0.01), but only the change in wedge pressure was significantly greater (p less than 0.01) than that produced by the lower dose. Radionuclide-determined LVEF decreased 6% (p less than 0.05), from 0.33 +/- 0.14 after 2 mg/kg and 11% (p less than 0.05) from 0.27 +/- 0.11 after 4 mg/kg of bepridil.

Normal subjects, type I von Willebrand's disease (vWd), and type II vWd were studied. The authors have found by correlating collagen-binding results with multimeric analysis that normal controls exhibit 85.4 +/- 5.1% collagen absorption of their vWf, patients with type I vWd 80.8 +/- 5.3%, whereas patients exhibiting a deficiency of high molecular weight vWf have 32.3 +/- 16.6% collagen absorption of vWf.

The results below were obtained from a prospective nonrandomized study in which the patients were subdivided into the following groups (subsets): elective sclerotherapy--10, active variceal bleeding at endoscopy--47, active variceal bleeding with spontaneous resolution at the time of endoscopy--21, and gastric variceal bleeding--nine. The data were analyzed as follows: 14 variables possibly affecting 6-wk survival were evaluated by stepwise logistic regression analysis. Variables examined were subset, age, sex, Child's classification, ascites, comorbid conditions, SGOT, bilirubin, protime, albumin, volume of initial bleed, volume of rebleed, rebleed rate, and Blakemore tube use. Survival curves were also compared using the Kaplan-Meier methodology. The following results were obtained. First, the subsets above had significantly different survival curve patterns with the elective endoscopic injection sclerosis group having the best prognosis and the gastric variceal bleeders a significantly poorer survival. Second, stepwise logistic regression analysis revealed the following four significant variable prognostic indicators: comorbid factors, subset, Child's classification, and serum albumin. Although the latter two variables, Child's class (p = 0.03) and albumin (p = 0.1) had an impact on six week survival, this was no longer seen when subset (p = 0.0124) and comorbid factors (p = 0.003) were taken into account. We conclude that comorbid factors and subsets of variceal bleeding in themselves were the only two prognostic indicators showing a statistically significant association with 6-wk and long-term survival. In contrast, the more usual clinical prognostic parameters, i.e., the physical findings and biochemical test of liver function in patients with cirrhosis and acute variceal bleeding, were of lesser prognostic magnitude.\r"

After five endoscopic injection sclerotherapy procedures using sodium morrhuate, she developed fever and elevated white blood count. Reendoscopy, chest x-ray, and upper gastrointestinal contrast x-rays showed no local complication. Urine analysis was normal, but CT scans, renal sonograms, and white blood cell radionuclide scan demonstrated bilateral perinephric abscesses. Percutaneous abscess drainage grew Streptococcus pneumoniae, normally found in the nasopharyngeal flora, which was probably a result of hematogenous spread. The perinephric abscesses were successfully treated with percutaneous drainage and antibiotics. Renal infection should be considered as a possible locus of distant blood-borne infection in patients who develop fever after endoscopic injection sclerotherapy.\r"

  ".W": "In this trial, we examined the role of 4-g 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA) enema in the long-term management of patients with previously refractory distal ulcerative colitis. Of 20 such patients treated with nightly 5-ASA enemas, 16 improved symptomatically, with 15 achieving clinical remission and 14 achieving sigmoidoscopic remission within 3 to 5 wk. An attempt was made to maintain clinical remission with 5-ASA enemas in these 16 by successively decreasing the frequency of administration to every other night and then every third night, as long as remission was maintained. Relapses were treated by reinstituting nightly 5-ASA enema administration followed by another attempt at tapering the frequency of administration. Follow-up has ranged from 5 to 16 months. Nine patients were rapidly tapered to every third night administration, but six relapsed. Of these six, four were brought into remission with reinitiation of nightly enemas and tapered to every three nights, whereas one ultimately required enemas every two nights for control and one required enemas nightly (with mild symptoms). Six other patients relapsed when the enemas were tapered to every two nights, and after retreatment on a nightly regimen, four could be maintained on an every third night regimen while two have required every second night administration. One patient has required nightly administration from the outset. Currently, one patient is off all medication, while eight are on an every third night, three are on an every second night, and three are on a nightly schedule. We conclude that in patients with distal ulcerative colitis refractory to conventional therapy but responsive to 5-ASA enemas, relapse is common as the frequency of 5-ASA enema administration is decreased, although some patients may be maintained on a less than nightly schedule. The optimal maintenance regimen remains to be determined.\r"

Three of the 21 patients had evidence of active malaria at the time of presentation, and all of these patients had Plasmodium falciparum. Renal histopathology revealed that six patients (29%) had amyloidosis and five patients (24%) had mesangiocapillary glomerulonephritis (type 1). Of particular note was the fact that only one patient had membranous glomerulonephropathy and only one patient had minimal change nephrotic syndrome, the two most common lesions reported in nephrotic patients in Europe and the United States. Thus, the spectrum of renal histopathology in patients presenting in Vanuatu with significant proteinuria is very different from that seen in Western Countries.\r"

  ".W": "To evaluate the role of the dialysate in the stimulation of interleukin-1 (IL-1) production during clinical hemodialysis (HD), we studied maintenance HD patients in two experiments. Cellulosic hollow-fiber dialyzers were obtained after 20 minutes of HD using either nonsterile standard dialysate (n = 6) or sterile pyrogen free 0.9% saline as dialysate (n = 6). After rinsing the blood compartment with normal saline, dialyzers were incubated at 37 degrees C for six hours. Aliquots from the blood compartment were analyzed for the presence of IL-1 by (1) rabbit pyrogenic response after intravenous injection or (2) thymocyte co-proliferation assay. The in vivo assay showed a significantly greater febrile response when standard dialysate was used than in the sterile saline group (P less than .001), and this response could be abolished by heat inactivation of aliquots (P less than .001). The in vitro assay confirmed the presence of significantly greater amounts of IL-1 (P less than .05). Studies were repeated using filter sterilized standard dialysate (n = 6) v standard dialysate (n = 6) for 240 minutes of clinical HD. The in vitro assay revealed significantly lower IL-1 levels in the filtered sterilized dialysate group (P less than .05), however, a blank control assay showed yet significantly lower levels (P less than .05). We conclude that IL-1 is produced during clinical HD and that endotoxin or its fragments play a role in the stimulation of IL-1 production, probably through monocytes adhering to the dialysis membrane. In addition to this dialysate factor, IL-1 production appears also to be stimulated by a blood-membrane interaction.\r"

The study results showed that norfloxacin treatment, which was well tolerated and not associated with any serious systemic adverse effects, prevented acquisition of gram-negative bacillary organisms. Fewer norfloxacin-treated patients (38 of 108 patients, or 35 percent) experienced microbiologically documented infections compared with patients receiving placebo (27 of 40 patients, or 68 percent), vancomycin-polymyxin (16 of 30 patients, or 53 percent), or TMP/SMX (14 of 28 patients, or 50 percent). Gram-negative bacteremia developed in five of 108 norfloxacin-treated patients (5 percent), compared with 17 of 40 placebo-treated patients (43 percent), five of 30 treated with vancomycin-polymyxin (17 percent), and one of 28 patients treated with TMP/SMX (4 percent). The incidence of gram-positive bacteremia was similar in all study groups and was not affected by norfloxacin or any other oral prophylactic antibiotics. These results suggest that norfloxacin is both safe and effective for the prevention of serious gram-negative bacillary infections in granulocytopenic patients. More effective prophylaxis of gram-positive bacterial infections, however, is needed.\r"

Quantitative bone biopsy performed in two patients (one with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and one with Waldenstrom's disease) demonstrated a dramatic increase in osteoclastic resorption close to tumor cells in both cases, similar to or even more marked than that observed in multiple myeloma. Finally, significant production of bone resorbing activity was found in short-term liquid culture specimens of tumor cells in eight of the nine cases. These observations clearly indicate that in B cell disorders other than multiple myeloma, the malignant B cells can produce significant bone resorbing activity in vitro and result in excessive osteoclastic resorption and lytic bone lesions, frequent hypercalcemia, and an overall disease picture clinically mimicking multiple myeloma.\r"

The scoring system was developed from the best clinical predictors of mortality, determined in a prospective study of consecutive bleeding patients. The model was then tested in a prospective validation phase at three hospitals. Three main factors in the model predict mortality: bleeding, including hematochezia, drop in hematocrit of 5%, short duration of bleeding, absence of melena, and hypotension; liver disease, manifested by prolonged prothrombin time and encephalopathy; and renal disease. Patients determined to be at high risk for death using the scoring system might be candidates for aggressive management and for therapeutic endoscopy.\r"

Histopathologic studies disclosed a marked gliotic retina and thick subretinal fibrotic tissue as well as a granulomatous lymphocytic infiltration in the choroid. Electron microscopy demonstrated that the subretinal tissue was derived from retinal pigment epithelial cells. The immunoperoxidase staining showed similar proportions of T and B lymphocytes, indicating a relative increase of B cells. There was a predominance of the helper/inducer T lymphocyte subset in the infiltrating area. The Muller cells in the retina expressed class II antigens of the major histocompatibility complex.\r"

Six juvenile macaques developed persistent lymphadenopathy (greater than 3 months in duration) after inoculation with SIV. The histologic appearance of the lymph nodes was characterized by marked follicular hyperplasia with abundant proliferative B cells infiltrating into the paracortex. The number of T8-positive lymphocytes equaled or exceeded the number of T4-positive lymphocytes in the paracortex. These findings, in association with immunologic abnormalities and a previously observed fatal immunodeficiency syndrome in SIV-infected macaques, provide further evidence of the importance of SIV-induced disease in macaques as a model for the study of AIDS.\r"

The kinetics of the neutrophilia that peaked at 2 hours as well as of the lymphopenia were highly reminiscent of the neutrophilia and lymphopenia following intravenous administration of either recombinant human interleukin-1 (IL-1) alpha or beta to rats. The peripheral neutrophilia was accompanied by a significant depletion of bone marrow neutrophils (P less than 0.001), as is also known to occur after administration of IL-1. Systemic blood pressure was not affected by rLT, which suggested that the changes in circulating leukocyte subsets were not attributable to hemodynamic changes nor to the hemodynamic-change-related release of adrenal hormones. Adrenalectomy did not alter the rLT-induced neutrophilia or lymphopenia, which suggested that rLT does not mediate its hematologic effects on peripheral blood leukocytes via the release of adrenal hormones. Pretreatment of rats with dexamethasone, indomethacin, or aspirin also did not alter rLT-induced neutrophilia or lymphopenia, which suggested that rLT-induced hematologic effects were not mediated via arachidonic acid metabolites, in stark contrast to IL-1 induced neutrophilia, which is inhibited by both dexamethasone and indomethacin.\r"

T cells, B cells, natural killer cells, and macrophages were quantitated on frozen tissue sections, which were stained with monoclonal antibodies, as demonstrated by the immunoperoxidase technique. The carcinomas had significantly higher numbers of T cells, Leu-3+ helper-inducer cells, T8+ cytotoxic-suppressor cells, M5+ macrophages, and T6+ Langerhans cells than the fibroadenomas. There were no significant differences in the distribution of natural killer cells. Among these mononuclear subsets, helper-inducer T cells were the primary cell type in both benign and malignant neoplasms. Estrogen receptor-positive carcinoma had significantly fewer numbers of T cells and the subgroup of Leu-3+ helper-inducer cells. Clinical Stage 3 cancers had significantly fewer numbers of T cells and natural killer cells than both fibroadenomas and Stage I and II neoplasms. Prominent infiltration of T cells, specifically helper-inducer cells, is not associated with estrogen receptor positivity, which is known to be a favorable prognostic marker of breast carcinoma. The findings of fewer T cells and natural killer cells in Stage 3 carcinomas are intriguing but unexplained.\r"

Focusing on very narrow time intervals following immunization, we found the SIDS mortality rate in the period zero to three days following DTP to be 7.3 times that in the period beginning 30 days after immunization (95 per cent confidence interval, 1.7 to 31). The mortality rate of non-immunized infants was 6.5 times that of immunized infants of the same age (95 per cent CI, 2.2 to 19). The latter result and to some extent the former appear to be ascribable to known risk factors for SIDS. Although the mortality ratios for SIDS following DTP, as estimated from this study, are high the period of apparently elevated risk was very short, so that only a small proportion of SIDS cases in infants with birthweights greater than 2500 gms could be associated with DTP.\r"

We hypothesized that activation of cardiac beta 2 receptors by endogenously released epinephrine and norepinephrine during surgical stress would add to the positive chronotropic response mediated by beta 1 stimulation. Twenty patients scheduled for coronary artery bypass grafting were studied. Ten patients received a beta 1-selective antagonist (atenolol, 6; metoprolol, 4) and ten patients received a nonselective beta 1 and beta 2 antagonist (propranolol) preoperatively. An isoproterenol dose-heart rate response test was performed. After stabilization, general anesthesia was induced followed by tracheal intubation and surgery. Hemodynamic data were recorded before induction, 1 min after induction, 5 min after intubation, 1 min before and after skin incision, 1 min before and after sternotomy. The ten patients on cardioselective beta-blocker drugs had significantly greater increases in heart rate during isoproterenol administration than did the non-cardioselectively blocked group of patients. Heart rate responses to tracheal intubation and surgical stress were not significantly different between the two groups at any point. We conclude that changes in heart rate during perioperative stress are primarily mediated through activation of beta 1 receptors in the myocardium and that patients on either cardioselective or noncardioselective beta-blockers have similar protection to adrenergic-mediated stressful hemodynamic events.\r"

  ".W": "The authors examined the effect of clonidine, a preferential alpha 2-adrenergic agonist, upon narcotic requirements, hemodynamics, and adrenergic responses during the perioperative period in patients undergoing CABG surgery. Anesthesia was provided by sufentanil supplemented with isoflurane; sodium nitroprusside was given as needed for hemodynamic control. Ten patients received oral clonidine preoperatively at the time of premedication, and again intraoperatively by nasogastric tube. Another group of ten untreated patients were otherwise managed identically. Intergroup differences in required anesthetic and vasoactive drug doses and recovery times were measured and evaluated, as well as hemodynamics and plasma catecholamines prior to induction, after intubation, and at intervals intra- and postoperatively. Patients who received clonidine required less diazepam prior to induction, and received 40% less sufentanil during the anesthetic period, than did untreated controls. More control patients required the addition of isoflurane to prevent hypertension. Mean blood pressures and heart rates were elevated at many sampling points in patients not treated with clonidine. Four of the clonidine-treated group required atropine for treatment of bradycardia in the pre-incision period. Plasma catecholamines were significantly lower throughout most of the study period in patients treated with clonidine. After cardiopulmonary bypass and postoperatively, cardiac outputs were significantly higher in the treated group. Patients who had received clonidine were extubated significantly earlier, and fewer of them shivered postoperatively. We conclude that perioperative treatment with clonidine reduced narcotic and anesthetic requirements, improved hemodynamics, reduced plasma catecholamines, and shortened the period of postoperative ventilation in patients undergoing coronary artery surgery.\r"

Control tobacco smokers (TS) and nonsmokers (NS) residing in the same metropolitan area were similarly studied and compared with the marijuana smokers (MS) and marijuana-tobacco smokers (MTS). Respiratory and drug histories, physical examination, and pulmonary function tests were obtained prior to bronchoscopy. The prevalence of respiratory symptoms and pulmonary function abnormalities was generally higher in the 3 smoking groups than in the NS group but was not statistically different across all groups. However, bronchoscopic inspection revealed airway hyperemia and other visible abnormalities in 32 (91%) subjects in the 3 smoking groups, unlike the unremarkable findings in the NS group. Light microscopy showed 2 or more histopathologic changes in the bronchial epithelium of all MS, MTS, and TS. Squamous metaplasia was observed in all MTS, a prevalence that was significantly different from that in MS, TS, and NS. Hyperplasia of basal and goblet cells was more prevalent in the MS than in the NS, whereas cellular disorganization was more prevalent in the MS than in the TS. A direct relationship between cumulative marijuana use (joint-years) and bronchoscopic and histopathologic changes was not apparent in this study sample. These results indicate that relatively young, habitual, heavy marijuana smokers have a high prevalence of abnormal airway appearance and histologic findings, irrespective of concomitant tobacco smoking.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Until now, however, it has been available only as a commercial preparation made from pooled human plasma, and it has not been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for use in the United States because of a high associated risk of hepatitis and acquired immune deficiency syndrome. Methods of obtaining fibrinogen, an essential component of fibrin glue, from cryoprecipitate or fresh frozen plasma have been published recently. However, the cryoprecipitate method results in relatively low concentrations of fibrinogen, which can reduce glue effectiveness. The fresh frozen plasma method is more expensive and does not meet the standards of the American Association of Blood Banks for the \"closed\" system required for safe handling and management of blood component products. Both the cryoprecipitate and the fresh frozen plasma methods result in waste of unstable clotting factors. These factors are necessary to replace human plasma clotting deficiencies but are not necessary for the production of fibrin glue. The authors have developed an efficient, high-concentration blood bank method for producing and maintaining a local supply of a safer and less expensive but equally effective material derived from stored human plasma. This material is produced using approved blood bank techniques for a \"closed\" system in blood component production, thus reducing the risks of contamination and infection, and its fibrinogen concentration is higher than that of standard cryoprecipitate. The cost of 1 unit of this fibrin glue is comparable to that for 1 unit of cryoprecipitate and less than that for 1 unit of fresh frozen plasma.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Mainly hematologic toxicity occurred: moderate leukopenia (1000 to 1900/mm3) was seen in 7 patients and severe (less than 1000/mm3) in 1, and moderate neutropenia (500 to 1000/mm3) in 5 and severe (less than 500/mm3) in 1. A cutaneous rash developed in 2 patients. Median overall survival was 16 weeks (range, 2 to 56).

In these studies, a cortical region of severe ischemia (I) was outlined, its metabolic and perfusion properties evaluated, and its length measured. The contralateral uninvolved cortical rim (C) in these patients and the cortical rim in 5 older normal patients were used for comparison. The length of region I correlated with the neurological deficit measured independently by a clinical scoring method. The 12 patients fell into two groups: Group I (8 patients), whose CBF in I was 9.3 +/- 2.5 ml/100 gm/min (mean +/- SEM) and was in every patient lower than that in C (33.1 +/- 2.2), and Group 2 (4 patients), whose CBF in I was 42.1 +/- 8.5 ml/100 gm/min and was in every case higher than that in C (28.2 +/- 1.5). In Group I, region I showed a CMRGlc(N)/CMRO2 ratio of 0.22 +/- 0.06 and a CpH of 6.83 +/- 0.06. In Group 2, the same ratio in the region I was 0.58 +/- 0.09 and the CpH was 7.12 +/- 0.05. The CMRGlc (N)/CMRO2 ratio for the contralateral hemisphere was comparable in the two groups. Our data suggest that, within 48 hours of the clinical onset of stroke, the ischemic cortex is already reperfused in one third of patients. Those ischemic regions with persistent hypoperfusion appear acidotic, whereas in the reperfused regions, despite evidence of an increased CMRGlc/CMRO2 ratio, acidosis is not evident. The implications of these findings for therapies proposed in acute human cerebral ischemia are discussed.\r"

MIC90s were 8 micrograms/ml for Enterobacter species and C. freundii, for which other agents had MICs of 32 micrograms/ml, except imipenem, which had equal activity. The MIC90 for Proteus vulgaris, Morganella morganii, Providencia stuartii, and Providencia rettgeri was 8 micrograms/ml, compared with less than 2 micrograms/ml shown by the other agents. Acinetobacter species resistant to other agents except imipenem were inhibited by 4 micrograms/ml, as were Pseudomonas aeruginosa, including piperacillin-, ceftazidime-, and gentamicin-resistant isolates. The MIC for P. cepacia, P. fluorescens, and P. acidovorans was less than or equal to 8 micrograms/ml, but that for P. maltophilia was greater than or equal to 128 micrograms/ml. Hemolytic streptococci A, B, C, G, and F were inhibited by less than 1 micrograms/ml, but the MIC for Streptococcus faecalis was greater than or equal to 32 micrograms/ml. MICs for Staphylococcus aureus methicillin-susceptible and -resistant strains were less than or equal to 1 microgram/ml, as were those for methicillin-susceptible and -resistant S. epidermidis. Bacteroides fragilis and Clostridium species and Fusobacterium spp. were inhibited by less than or equal to 4 micrograms/ml.

CGP 31608 induced beta-lactamases in P. aeruginosa, E. cloacae, C. freundii and Providencia rettgeri, but there was no increase in MICs for the isolates and it did not select strains derepressed for beta-lactamase production. Synergy of CGP 31608 and gentamicin was found against 90% P. aeruginosa, 60% Enterobacter cloacae, and 50% Serratia marcescens strains. No synergy was found with rifampin.

  ".W": "The mechanism of chloramphenicol transport into susceptible strains of Haemophilus influenzae cells has not been reported previously. We examined apparent uptake of chloramphenicol by bacterial cells by using high-pressure liquid chromatography to quantitate drug disappearance from liquid media. Cell-associated chloramphenicol concentration is 1,000-fold greater than the extracellular drug concentration. Under incubation conditions associated with chloramphenicol disappearance from media, cellular protein synthesis was inhibited; however, if accumulation was inhibited, protein synthesis occurred in the presence of the drug. Chloramphenicol uptake appeared saturable (Km = 0.96 mM, Vmax = 0.9 mumol/min per mg of protein) and energy dependent: disappearance from media was markedly decreased by 2,4-dinitrophenol and carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone, compounds which disrupt the proton motive force. Uptake occurred only in median which can support growth and was dependent upon temperature and pH. Drug accumulation was minimally affected by inhibitors of electron transport or by gentamicin and puromycin, both inhibitors of protein synthesis. The rate of disappearance was inhibited by SCH24893, a fluorinated chloramphenicol analog which also inhibits protein synthesis. We conclude that chloramphenicol accumulation by H. influenzae occurs by energy-dependent transport.\r"

  ".W": "A total of 111 clinical isolates of Campylobacter jejuni and 10 clinical isolates of Campylobacter coli were characterized by their susceptibility to nine antimicrobial agents and by their plasmid profiles on agarose gel electrophoresis. All of the C. jejuni isolates were susceptible to chloramphenicol, ciprofloxacin, erythromycin, kanamycin, and nalidixic acid, but 55% were tetracycline resistant. In the 10 C. coli isolates, a high prevalence of multiple-antibiotic resistance was noted. Plasmids were found in 82% of the tetracycline-resistant and 15% of the tetracycline-susceptible C. jejuni isolates. Tetracycline resistance in six randomly selected C. jejuni isolates, which contained 50- or 135-kilobase (kb) plasmids, was transferred by conjugation to a Campylobacter fetus subsp. fetus recipient with recovery of a 50- or a 45-kb plasmid from transconjugants. From one multiple-antibiotic-resistant C. coli isolate, resistance to tetracycline, kanamycin, and chloramphenicol was transferred concomitantly with a 58-kb plasmid, pNR9589. Nonconjugative 98-kb plasmids, pNR9131 and pNR9581, from C. coli isolates with resistance to tetracycline, kanamycin, and erythromycin were shown by cloning experiments to code for at least kanamycin resistance. Restriction digests revealed that 50-kb plasmids from tetracycline-resistant C. jejuni isolates were identical, although plasmids from multiple-antibiotic-resistant C. coli isolates shared partial DNA homology to each other. Cloning of the kanamycin and chloramphenicol resistance genes of pNR9589 into Escherichia coli showed that the two genes are closely linked or clustered. Double-digestion analysis of the fragments encoding the kanamycin resistance of pNR9131, pNR9581, and pNR9589 showed that these three plasmids contain a common fragment related to kanamycin resistance.\r"

However, colonization resistance has not been shown in humans. We administered cefoxitin, piperacillin, cefoperazone, and aztreonam intravenously to healthy subjects for 9 days and monitored the acquisition of new isolates in the fecal flora. Seven of sixteen antibiotic-treated subjects but none of four untreated controls became colonized by gram-negative bacilli. However, there was no correlation between colonization and the particular drug given or the extent of suppression of anaerobes or of any other component of the fecal microflora. Cefoxitin and piperacillin were associated with the greatest increases in the numbers of drug-resistant bacteria and in fecal beta-lactamase content. The results of this study support the concept that colonization resistance occurs in humans and is diminished by antibiotic administration but fail to support the hypothesis that resistance is related to the anaerobic microflora.\r"

  ".W": "In view of the claim that low 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25-OHD) concentrations may contribute to the pathogenesis of bone disease in patients with beta thalassaemia major and iron overload, we have assessed the concentrations of 25-OHD, 1 alpha,25 dihydroxyvitamin D (1 alpha,25(OH)2D), parathyroid hormone, and osteocalcin in such patients. 25-OHD concentrations were significantly lower in patients with thalassaemia major and iron overload than in controls and in some patients were subnormal or undetectable. 1 alpha,25(OH)2D concentrations were, however, normal in all patients and were similar to those in controls. Serum parathyroid hormone and plasma calcium concentrations were also normal and not significantly different from those in controls. Although 25-OHD concentrations increased significantly between January and June, there was no change in 1 alpha,25(OH)2D concentrations. 25-OHD concentrations remained lower than control values, even in June. Parathyroid hormone concentrations fell, but not significantly, between January and June, but calcium concentrations did not alter. Osteocalcin concentrations were normal in all patients except one, who had extremely low concentrations of this protein. The concentration of osteocalcin was not related to 25-OHD or 1 alpha,25(OH)2D concentrations. Thus normal calcium homeostasis is maintained in patients with thalassaemia major despite low or low-normal 25-OHD concentrations; this is probably achieved through the maintenance of normal 1 alpha,25(OH)2D concentrations, which were indistinguishable from those in controls. Normal 1 alpha,25(OH)2D, parathyroid hormone, and osteocalcin concentrations argue against an important role for vitamin D deficiency in the pathogenesis of thalassemia bone disease.\r"

In the first survey, FEV1.0, FEF25-75, and MEF50 of children from urban areas were significantly lower, while in the second survey they were not significantly different from those of controls. The slopes over time of FEV1.0, FEF25-75, and MEF50, adjusted for sex and anthropometric variables, were closely related to the decrease of pollutants concentration.

Frozen sections of 5-, 7-, and 10-day-old incisional wounds and sponges from Lewis rats were stained with mouse anti-rat monoclonal antibodies. Cellular staining to OX1 (all leucocyte), W3/25 (helper/effector T lymphocytes), and OX8 (suppressor/cytotoxic T lymphocytes) was quantitated in two arbitrarily defined areas based on maximal cellular infiltration: the superficial wound, down to and including the papillary dermis, and the deep wound, the reticular dermis. Five-day wounds were significantly more cellular than 10-day wounds in the deep portion (p less than 0.05) and somewhat more cellular in the superficial section (p less than 0.10). Approximately 2:1 W3/25 to OX8 ratios were noted for wound strips on all days. At 5 and 10 days there are twice as many W3/25 and OX8 labeled cells in the deep wound as in the superficial portion. At 7 days there is a peak in surface W3/25 and OX8 lymphocytes, whereas the deep population remains constant. Seven- and 10-day sponge granulomas demonstrate ratios similar to the wound strips (5-day sponge lymphocytic infiltration was insufficient to count). The data demonstrate that lymphocyte subpopulation participation in wound healing is a dynamic and distinctive process.\r"

Because of this, a strong case has been made against emergency shunt. This report describes an experience with emergency portacaval shunt for the treatment of variceal bleeding when used systematically after hemodynamic stabilization and control of the bleeding episode with balloon tamponade, if necessary, in patients with mild or moderate liver disease. The population studied comprised 62 consecutive patients who rebled from varices while participating in a controlled trial of propranolol for the prevention of rebleeding. Of the 62 patients, nine died of massive hemorrhage and 53 survived the hemorrhage. Of the 53 survivors, 11 had severe liver disease and were not considered for shunt surgery. Of the remaining 42 patients with mild or moderate liver disease, 36 had emergency central portacaval shunt. The interval between endoscopic diagnosis of variceal bleeding and surgery averaged 19 +/- 3 hours (mean +/- SE). The operative mortality rate, defined as in-hospital mortality, was 19%. One- and 2-year survival rates were 78% and 71%, respectively. The incidence of postoperative hepatic encephalopathy was 36%; all patients responded favorably to protein restriction and lactulose. Thus, under specific conditions, emergency portacaval shunt results in an acceptable long-term survival rate. In patients with mild or moderate liver disease, emergency portacaval shunt should be considered when other forms of treatment for the prevention of variceal rebleeding have failed.\r"

  ".U": "87269849\r", 
  ".W": "It is commonly believed that the digestion of intraluminal blood by colonic bacteria is the primary cause of increased ammonia production after upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage. To evaluate the role of the small intestine in ammonia production, blood, amino acids, or water (5 mL/kg) was administered as a meal or enema to awake dogs with chronic indwelling catheters. After blood meals, intestinal ammonia production increased rapidly to peak at 60 minutes and returned to basal levels. This response was mimicked by the gastric administration of ammoniagenic amino acids. No change in ammonia production occurred with water administration. In contrast, colonic blood administration resulted in a gradual rise in ammonia production, and peaked at 150 minutes. Amino acid enemas resulted in a similar but somewhat more rapid response. No change occurred with water enemas. After gut decontamination, ammonia production did not increase after blood enemas. However, the rapid increase in ammonia production persisted after blood meals. It is concluded that both the small bowel and colon participate in the augmented ammonia production that occurs after upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage. Gut decontamination reduces ammonia production by altering the colonic microflora, but is not specific therapy directed towards amino acid metabolism by the enterocytes of the small bowel and thus, does not alter the ammonia produced by the small intestine.\r"

In Group I patients, length of operation had a significant effect (p less than 0.01) on anastomotic complications. In Group II patients, a significant increase in complications was related to the presence of obstruction (p less than 0.001), recent weight loss (greater than 10 pounds) (p less than 0.02), malignancy (p less than 0.04), and sepsis (p less than 0.05).\r"

Pulmonary artery diastolic pressure, PAWP, and their percent change after bypass did not correlate with absolute values (before or after bypass) or percent change in LVEDP. Percent change in LV area correlated weakly with percent change in PADP (r = .34, p less than .03) but not with changes in PAWP or LVEDP. Changes were opposite in direction in 45% (PADP), 50% (PAWP), and 67% (LVEDP) of patients. In conclusion, both PADP and PAWP were poor guides to LVEDP and neither reflected changes in LV size. Thus, hemodynamic indexes of preload should be used with caution during cardiac operations.\r"

Six subjects initially exhibited no residual volitional activity in targeted muscles, and all patients had undergone conventional therapy with little or no functional recovery. Electromyographic (EMG) recordings and EMS directed to prime movers of impaired movements were accomplished by way of skin-surface electrodes. Prescribed treatment (patient compliance was frequently substandard) involved several months of four to five sessions per week, focusing on wrist extension and/or ankle dorsiflexion initially, and often other movements later. During 30 to 300 movement attempts per session, EMGs that exceeded a preset threshold triggered immediate stimulation to force movement completion. Over sessions, patients commonly realized substantially improved increases in voluntary EMG capabilities generally proportionate to the frequency of treatment sessions. Parallel improvements were also found for subjectively scaled functional measures of range-of-motion and ambulation. Motivation was important to success, but side and nature of stroke, age, and poststroke interval were not. Progress often far exceeded that of previous conventional therapy (each patient served as his/her own control). Regarding mechanisms, impaired proprioceptive feedback is considered central to stroke-disrupted sensorimotor control. EMG-triggered EMS is intended to improve brain relearning by reinstating proprioceptive feedback time-locked to each attempted movement. Clinical results were consistent with this theory; further assessment of the new EMG-triggered EMS modality intergrated into conventional treatment regimens seems warranted.\r"

This study was undertaken in order to determine whether a large-scale trial should be initiated using FES to prevent DVT in spinal cord injury (SCI) patients. The goals of this pilot study were to demonstrate the value of FES of calf musculature in (1) increasing plasma fibrinolytic activity and (2) promoting venous blood flow in the lower extremities. Plasma fibrinolytic activity was monitored in ten SCI patients before, immediately after, and 100 minutes after 60 minutes of calf FES. A significant increase in plasma fibrinolytic activity was noted using whole blood and platelet-rich plasma clot lysis assays. Continuous photoplethysmographic and Doppler ultrasound monitoring of venous flow was attempted during FES in four spinal cord patients, and a mild to moderate increase in flow was achieved. FES was not as successful as manual compression in promoting venous emptying of the lower extremity. FES may be a useful tool in the prevention of DVT in SCI patients due to a significant increase in fibrinolytic activity and a mild to moderate increase in venous blood flow. FES merits full-scale clinical evaluation for this purpose.\r"

Damage from such stimulation can occur in the form of tissue burns. Two cases of burns in spinal cord patients receiving functional electric stimulation are presented. It is concluded that to avoid burning of tissue: a stimulating electrode with a large surface should be used; uniform contact between the electrode and the skin should be insured; a good conducting-material interface between the electrode and skin is required; adequate ventilation for heat dissipation should be provided; sharply cut electrode corners, wire insulation damage, and cuts in lead wires must be avoided.\r"

Staphylococcus aureus was the most common organism (48%) isolated from these infants. Chlamydia trachomatis could not be isolated from eyes with mild to moderate conjunctivitis. Forty-four infants with severe conjunctivitis, with or without dacryocystitis, were randomly assigned to treatment with either topical chloramphenicol or oral erythromycin for 14 days. Chlamydia trachomatis was isolated from 19 (43%) of these infants. All infants with chlamydial conjunctivitis who were treated with 25 mg/kg of oral erythromycin ethylsuccinate twice daily for 14 days were clinically and microbiologically cured. In contrast, all treatment of chlamydial conjunctivitis with topical chloramphenicol failed clinically as well as microbiologically. Dacryocystitis was a common complication in neonatal conjunctivitis (17%). The clinical failures in neonatal nonchlamydial conjunctivitis were associated with persistent obstruction of the nasolacrimal duct.\r"

Endotoxin was not detected in the samples of nCSF-1 or rIL-3 with the Limulus lysate test, and the in vitro and in vivo hematopoietic stimulatory effects of both molecules were abolished or markedly reduced by 30 minutes' treatment at 100 degrees C, which demonstrates that the effects noted in vivo were not due to endotoxin. Combinations of low concentrations of rIL-3 and nCSF-1, which by themselves were inactive, increased the percentage of HPP-CFC and LPP-CFC in active cell cycle in a synergistic fashion. No significant change in the number of HPP-CFC or LPP-CFC per femur or femoral nucleated cellularity was observed. Thus, rIL-3 and nCSF-1 can synergize to effect the proliferation of the same cell populations in vivo.\r"

  ".W": "We examined the in vitro effect of recombinant human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (rhG-CSF) on neutrophil anomalies in 20 patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and eight patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). Neutrophil alkaline phosphatase (NAP) activity was determined in nine MDS patients and eight CML patients by a scoring method. NAP scores were decreased in six of the nine patients with MDS and in all of the patients with CML. In all patients with these diseases, NAP scores increased by incubating the blood with rhG-CSF. An increase in NAP scores by rhG-CSF was observed even at a concentration of 1 U/mL in patients with MDS but was observed only at higher concentrations (1,000 to 10,000 U/mL) in patients with CML. Significant increases in NAP scores occurred at 12 hours' incubation in patients with MDS, whereas the increase was more gradual in patients with CML. This time course difference was thought to be due mainly to the difference in cell populations of circulating myeloid cells between MDS patients and CML patients. Induction of NAP activity by rhG-CSF in patients with both these diseases was suppressed by the addition of inhibitors of RNA or protein synthesis. Neutrophil superoxide anion (O2-) production induced by N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (fMLP) was determined in the other 11 patients with MDS. This neutrophil function was decreased in seven of the 11 patients with MDS, normal in two patients, and increased in two patients. Preincubation with rhG-CSF caused a significant increase in fMLP-induced O2- production in nine of the 11 patients with MDS. rhG-CSF enhanced this neutrophil function in a time- and dose-dependent manner, and maximal stimulation was observed at 2,000 to 4,000 U/mL of rhG-CSF and at five to ten minutes' incubation. The present results show that rhG-CSF is able to repair at least in part the neutrophil anomalies in these patients, and our data, especially for patients with MDS, suggest the clinical usefulness of rhG-CSF for this preleukemic disorder.\r"

  ".W": "In an attempt to compare B cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) with its normal cellular counterpart, the cell surface phenotype of 100 cases of B-CLL was determined by using a panel of monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs) directed against B cell-restricted and -associated antigens. The majority of B-CLL cells expressed Ia, B4 (CD19), B1 (CD20), B2 (CD21), surface immunoglobulin (sIg), and T1 (CD5) but lacked C3b (CD35) receptors. In contrast, the overwhelming majority of small unstimulated B cells expressed Ia, B4, B1, B2, sIg, and C3b receptors but lacked detectable T1. Small numbers of weakly sIg+ cells could be identified in peripheral blood and tonsil that coexpressed the B1 and T1 antigens. Approximately 16% of fetal splenocytes coexpressed B1, T1, weak sIg, B2, and Ia but lacked C3b receptors and therefore closely resembled most B-CLL cells. With the phenotypic differences between the majority of small unstimulated B cells and B-CLL cells, we examined normal in vitro activated B cells and B-CLL cells for the expression of B cell-restricted and -associated activation antigens. Of 20 cases examined, virtually all expressed B5, and approximately 50% of the cases expressed interleukin-2 receptors (IL-2R) and Blast-1. Normal B cells were activated with either anti-Ig or 12-0-tetradecanoylphorbol-beta-acetate (TPA) and then were examined for coexpression of B1, T1, and the B cell activation antigens B5 and IL-2R. Only cells activated with TPA coexpressed B1 and T1 as well as B5 and IL-2R. B cells activated with either anti-Ig or TPA proliferated in the presence of IL-2, whereas B-CLL cells did not, although they all expressed the identical 60-kilodalton proteins by immunoprecipitation. These studies are consistent with the notion that B-CLL resembles several minor subpopulations of normal B cells including a population of B cells that are activated in vitro directly through the protein kinase C pathway.\r"

  ".W": "Chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) is associated with the Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome, which results from a reciprocal translocation between chromosomes 9 and 22. This activates the abl oncogene by moving it from chromosome 9 and combining it with sequence located on chromosome 22. The new fusion gene, with chromosome 22 sequence at its 5' end and chromosome 9-abl sequence at its 3' end, generates a new messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein that are implicated in the pathogenesis of CML. The breakpoint near the c-abl locus on chromosome 9 can occur within a large area. In contrast, the breakpoints on chromosome 22 are concentrated within a 6 kilobase (kb) region termed the breakpoint cluster region (bcr). This study was designed to determine whether chronic-phase and blast crisis patients had identifiable differences in the structure of their Ph chromosomes. Restriction mapping of the chromosome 22 translocation breakpoints performed for 26 patients showed that the breakpoints of eight of the nine patients in blast crisis were in the 3' portion of the bcr, whereas the breakpoints in the 17 patients in the chronic phase were clustered in the 5' portion of the bcr. This suggests a strong correlation between a 3' bcr breakpoint and blast crisis in CML.\r"

  ".W": "Immunoregulatory T and B cell functions in 15 patients with primary myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) were studied by measuring the proliferative and the stimulatory capacity of T and B cells, respectively, in autologous (auto) and allogeneic (allo) mixed lymphocyte reaction (MLR). T cell proliferation in the auto MLR was 25% of the control (P less than .02), whereas proliferation in the allo MLR was normal. When control T cells were stimulated by MDS B cells, their proliferative response was only 57% of the control (P less than .01). The mechanism responsible for these abnormalities was studied by determining the capacity of MDS and normal T cells to produce interleukin 2 (IL 2) and to generate IL 2 receptors (IL 2R) following stimulation with control and MDS B cells. In the auto MLR of MDS patients, only 3% +/- 2% of T cells developed IL 2R positivity, whereas in control cultures 12% +/- 2% of T cells were positive, as determined by immunofluorescence, using a monoclonal antibody (MoAb) directed against the IL 2R, and FACS analysis. When MDS T cells were stimulated by control B cells, IL 2R generation and the production of IL 2 were within normal limits. In contrast, when control T cells were stimulated by MDS B cells or control B cells, the MDS B cells induced production of only 26% of IL 2 as compared with control B cells. In parallel experiments, IL 2R generation in control T cells stimulated by either MDS or control B cells was similar. We conclude that in the primary MDS, T and B cell interactions are impaired. Although MDS T cells develop normal quantities of IL 2R and produce normal amounts of IL 2 when stimulated by control B cells, they are markedly impaired when stimulated by self B cells. Similarly, MDS B cells can induce IL 2R generation in control T cells but not in MDS T cells. Myelodysplastic B cells are also defective in inducing IL 2 production by normal T cells in an allo MLR. These in vitro abnormalities strongly suggest that generation of lymphocytes with immunoregulatory functions is impaired in patients with MDS.\r"

IgG-class antibodies against cytomegalovirus (CMV), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), herpes simplex virus (HSV), and varicella-zoster virus (VZV) were used as markers for the carrier status of those viruses. CMV carrier status was associated with significant increases in the numbers of some T cell subsets, whereas the carrier status of EBV, HSV, and VZV had no significant effects. The 159 CMV-seropositive individuals had higher numbers of HNK1+ T cells than did the 175 CMV-seronegative individuals [mean (SD), 292 (196)/microL v 164 (89)/microL, respectively], including the CD4+HNK1+ T cells [38 (48)/microL v 9 (13)/microL, respectively] and the CD8+HNK1+ T cells [166 (146)/microL v 73 (54)/microL, respectively]. Morphological and cytochemical studies showed that the expression of HNK1 by the CD4+ and CD8+ T cells was associated with the occurrence of azurophilic cytoplasmatic granules and a loss of nonspecific esterase activity. The numbers of CD4+HNK1+ and CD8+HNK1+ T cells increased proportionally to the levels of the IgG-class CMV antibody titers. We suggest that the increased numbers of CD4+HNK1+ and CD8+HNK1+ granular T cells in CMV carriers reflect the persistent interaction between CMV and the immune system of its hosts.\r"

Each of these 11 cases demonstrated leukemic cell surface antigens that have been correlated with a B cell precursor phenotype. Of the 11, lymphoblasts of 4 retained the germline configuration of both Ig and TCR loci, whereas 7 had rearranged the Ig heavy chain gene. Two of these seven showed light chain gene rearrangement. TCB beta chain rearrangement had occurred in only one of the 11 patients' tumors. No TCR gamma chain rearrangements were identified. These results are in contrast to earlier studies of B cell precursor ALL in children in which Ig heavy chain gene rearrangements were evident in every case and approximately 40% showed Ig light chain rearrangement as well. In addition, 45% of cases of B cell precursor ALL of children had rearranged their gamma TCR genes, and 20% had rearranged beta. These data suggest that ALL in infancy represents an earlier stage of B cell development than is found in B cell precursor ALL of children. ALL in the infant age group has been associated with the worst prognosis of all patients with ALL. This study suggests that the disease in infants differs not only clinically, but also at the molecular genetic level, from the disease in children.\r"

  ".U": "87272072\r", 
  ".W": "The platelet retention test provides a measure of the number of platelets retained in a column of glass beads and is one of the few in vitro platelet function tests that is abnormal in von Willebrand's disease (vWd). In a two-stage test, 1 mL of blood (designated A) was passed through the column, followed by 5 mL of isotonic saline and then 5 mL of blood (B) in which platelet retention was measured. With normal blood as A and B, retention is very high in all 5 mL of blood B. In the first stage, platelets adhere to the glass beads; this requires fibrinogen but not von Willebrand factor (vWf). The platelet-platelet adhesion in the second stage requires vWf, is dependent on release of ADP, and fails to occur if thrombasthenic platelets are tested. Retention was normal when blood from a patient with afibrinogenemia was used as blood B. We have now used monoclonal antibodies to elucidate further the mechanism of platelet retention. Five antibodies to different epitopes on vWf essentially abolished retention in the one-stage test and in the second stage of the two-stage test, but had no effect on the first stage. Thus, the entire vWf molecule must be free of antibody to function in the platelet-platelet adhesion of the second stage of this test. Binding of the antigen-antibody complex to the platelet Fc receptor was not responsible, as Fab and F(ab')2 fragments of one of the antibodies were as effective as intact antibody, and as neither heat-aggregated IgG nor a polyclonal antibody to plasma factor IX inhibited retention. F(ab')2 fragments of 6D1, an antibody to platelet GP Ib that prevents binding of vWf to platelets, also inhibited the second phase of retention. An antibody that inhibits binding of fibrinogen and vWf to GP IIb/IIIa (LJ-CP8) inhibited both the first and second stages of retention, whereas LJ-P5, an antibody that inhibits only the binding of vWf to GP IIb/IIIa, caused slight inhibition of retention when normal or afibrinogenemic blood was used as blood B and was reported to cause only partial inhibition of ADP-induced platelet aggregation in this afibrinogenemic patient. The results suggest that vWf is altered during rapid passage of blood through the glass-bead column so that it attaches to GP Ib, exposing GP IIb/IIIa, which then binds the altered vWf or fibrinogen, either of which can induce platelet aggregation (platelet-platelet adhesion) and thus retention in the column.\r"

Of 563 serum samples tested, 251 were from HIV-infected patients diagnosed as having AIDS manifested by opportunistic infections (AIDS-OI), AIDS-associated Kaposi's sarcoma (AIDS-KS), or AIDS-related complex (ARC). One hundred seventy-six specimens tested were from asymptomatic high-risk individuals, and 136 were from heterosexual control subjects or patients with non-AIDS-related disease. None of the 136 control individuals tested had HIV Ag or HIV antibodies to either p24 or gp41. Of the 427 HIV-seropositive individuals, 99% to 100% were positive for gp41 antibodies to HIV. In contrast, the seroprevalence of p24 antibodies to HIV varied from 23% to 83% and appeared to be inversely associated with the severity of the patients' clinical symptoms. When specimens were analyzed for the presence of HIV Ag, in seropositive individuals the prevalence rate for this marker was lowest (1.4%) in asymptomatic individuals and highest (50%) in the AIDS-OI diagnosed group. Also, 240 cases with AIDS-KS, AIDS-OI, and ARC and the group of asymptomatic high-risk individuals were analyzed for T helper/T lymphocytes (T4) cell number and T4/T8 ratio; only one (2.0%) HIV Ag-positive case showed a T4 cell number greater than 400 and a normal T4/T8 ratio.

However, 50% of the subjects with an apparently normal upper gastrointestinal tract had a positive test for blood in the stool and these comprised the largest group of those examined. It was concluded that the finding of a positive faecal occult blood in such subjects is a poor indicator of ulcerative or inflammatory lesions of the upper gastrointestinal tract. The possible reasons for a finding of blood in the stool of patients taking NSAID who apparently have a normal upper gastrointestinal tract is discussed.\r"

This low incidence of haemorrhage and mortality can be directly related to an aggressive prophylactic treatment with antacid and titration of the gastric pH to 5.5 or above. With this aggressive management programme, few operative procedures were required. A review of autopsy data showed that the site of haemorrhage was distributed throughout the gastrointestinal tract with the predominant site being the stomach.\r"

The supposition that a complete 4-test set is necessary only if the monothermal reaction shows significant asymmetry, is tested by determining how far this would lead to a correct evaluation compared with the final results obtained by the bithermal testing. The study shows that hot as well as cold monothermal screening would result in too many false positive as well as false negative findings. A test procedure consisting of an alternating bithermal stimulation is proposed as a technique for shortening the examination time. This technique has proven to be reliable and it is also more comfortable for the patient.\r"

Patients with Meniere's disease were examined between attacks and patients with a sudden unilateral vestibular loss syndrome at least 3-4 weeks after the initial attack. Posturography, (recording and analysing the postural sway) was used to evaluate the influence of these disorders upon the vestibulospinal reflex. In 50% of the patients, the postural sway was disturbed compared with the performance of a normal control group. Meniere's disease had a more pronounced effect on the posturographic results, whereas for the unilateral vestibular loss syndrome the rotation tests showed more asymmetry. It is obvious that the effect upon the vestibulospinal reflex cannot be deduced from the rotational test results. Indeed in a large number of patients discordance between rotational test results and posturography was seen. The presence or absence of attacks during the previous year in patients with Meniere's disease had no influence on the presence of abnormal posturographic results. If other complaints of dizziness were mentioned by the patient, posturography was nearly always abnormal. It is evident that a complete evaluation of such patients must include information obtained by posturography.\r"

We analyze the clinical characteristics, histological renal findings and subsequent course of patients with silent renal disease. Renal biopsy was performed in 15 patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) who had no clinical signs of renal involvement (no urinary sediment abnormalities, absence of proteinuria and serum creatinine less than 1.3 mg/dl). All biopsies were classified according to a modified classification proposed by the WHO. Six cases (40%) showed no histological or immunofluorescence changes (type I), 7 (47%) had mesangial nephropathy (3 type IIa and 4 type IIb) and 2 (13%) had focal proliferative glomerulonephritis (type III). None of the patients had previous evidence of neurological abnormalities. Patients with type I only had arthritis, skin lesions and Raynaud's phenomenon. By contrast, 7 patients with histological renal involvement had serositis or hemolytic anemia. All cases with silent nephropathy were treated with steroids and showed a benign clinical course with stable renal function and absence of urinary abnormalities during follow-up. We concluded that in the absence of clinical renal abnormalities, renal involvement is not uncommon in SLE. We believe that a renal biopsy should be performed mainly in those SLE patients presenting with clinical manifestations other than arthritis or cutaneous lesions since this policy may allow detection of significant silent renal injury.\r"

Disability evaluation for Social Security applicants and Workers' Compensation patients is commonplace in orthopedic practices. Yet, formal education in this aspect of patient care is rare both during and after residency. Because of a lack of understanding and sophistication the physician who knows the patient better than any other evaluator often play a minor role in the determination of disability. Disability Evaluation Under Social Security--A Handbook for Physicians lists the medical criteria necessary for qualification. Severely disabled arthritis patients will not always fit into these various categories and may have to be considered under the rule of medical equivalency. Workers' Compensation statutes vary somewhat from state to state but generally include disability criteria. Familiarity with these criteria and the process involved will allow the orthopedist to communicate more meaningfully with administrators and will reduce much of the frustration and some of the cost inherent in this system. When subjective complaint (illness) is in excess of apparent organic pathology (disease), team evaluation under the direction of the treating physician will help sort out the dilemma and develop a treatment plan. One hopes that this will bring the illness more in line with the disease, and thus reduce the disability.\r"

Coincidentally, 7.7 ml H2O was linked to 1 g of albumin retained in the circulation. The half-life of P-Alb was 16.2 h, and the distribution volume of the infused dose exceeded PV. An increased pulmonary capillary wedge pressure produced an increase in cardiac index. The right and left ventricular stroke work indices also increased.

We conclude that the assessment of D-erythro-neopterin might be an easily available aid for an early evaluation of the immunologic status of a patient at risk for septic complications.\r"

The only significant difference that emerged was in their slightly decreased number and proportion of surface immunoglobulin (lambda chain) -bearing cells. Of specific interest, the numbers of OKT4+ and OKT8+ lymphocytes and the T4+/T8+ ratios were not significantly different from control values. A sizable minority of patients had increased ratios, while a smaller number had decreased values. No explanation or identifying feature was apparent for those patients with either increased or decreased T4+/T8+ ratios. (One patient with a very low ratio, who was excluded from our analysis, developed acquired immune deficiency syndrome.) No differences were apparent in T4+/T8+ ratios or any other lymphocyte surface phenotypic characteristics when patients were segregated by presence of anti-intrinsic factor antibody or anti-parietal cell antibody, or by race, sex, or age. Our results in a racially heterogeneous group of patients do not support the suggestion that T4+/T8+ ratios are usually abnormal in prenicious anemia or that the presence of anti-intrinsic factor antibody is associated with such abnormality.\r"

  ".W": "Previous studies in the authors' laboratory suggest that the antiprogestin RU486 may directly affect human ovarian progesterone production. The possibility that this compound could affect other steps in human ovarian steroidogenesis was examined by studying its effects on estrogen production in cultured human granulosa cells and on human ovarian aromatase (AR) and 17-hydroxylase (17-OH) activities in vitro. RU486 had no effect on media estradiol (E2) levels as measured by radioimmunoassay (RIA) over a 24-hour incubation period. Furthermore, no effect on ovarian AR activity occurred at concentrations of RU486 100 times substrate. However, a dose-dependent decrease in the activity of 17-OH was observed with increasing amounts of drug. RU486 decreased 17-OH activity by 12 and 29% below that of basal activity at concentrations equal to and ten times substrate. At 50- and 100-fold excess, RU486 further decreased 17-OH activity by 42 (P less than 0.01) and 48% (P less than 0.005). In conclusion, RU486 directly inhibits human ovarian 17-OH activity, but does not affect AR activity or E2 production in vitro. Clinically observed decreases in serum E2 levels may be due to inhibition of enzymatic steps proximal to E2 synthesis. These findings support the authors' previous observations suggesting that RU486 has a direct affect on human ovarian steroidogenesis.\r"

In untreated (control) rats, a dramatic rise in the leakage of 51Cr-labeled red blood cells into the gastric lumen was observed during the reperfusion period. Treatment with neutrophil antiserum attenuated 51Cr-labeled red blood cell flux into the gastric lumen. Using the radioactive microsphere technique, neutrophil-depleted animals were shown to have higher blood flows in the ischemic period than the untreated rats. Bleeding of untreated rats to a mean arterial pressure of 40 mmHg resulted in blood flows that were not different from those in antiserum-treated rats bled to 27 mmHg and leakage of 51Cr-labeled red blood cells similar to that measured in antiserum-treated rats.

After intestinal administration of cholera toxin, high numbers of specific antibody-containing cells appeared in the liver during the early priming period and after boosting. In contrast, a significant number of specific antibody-containing cells appeared in the lamina propria of the intestine only after boosting. In the liver, the specific antibody-containing cells were predominantly located in the sinusoidal region of zone 1 of the liver lobules. About 80% of the specific antibody-producing cells in the liver synthesized anticholera toxin antibody of the immunoglobulin A class. During the priming period, the concentration of immunoglobulin A anticholera toxin in bile paralleled the increase and decrease in the number of specific antibody-containing cells in the liver. Liver perfusion experiments indicated that during the priming period at least 70% of the biliary immunoglobulin A anticholera toxin antibody was synthesized within the liver, whereas 30% was synthesized in the liver after boosting. Thus, during the early immune response, the liver seems to be the major source for specific biliary antibody to intestinally administered cholera toxin.\r"

Plating efficiency, DNA and protein content, viability, and morphologic appearance were the same in cultures prepared with hepatocytes isolated from male or female rats. Epidermal growth factor (EGF)-induced DNA synthesis was significantly higher in hepatocytes from male rats than in hepatocytes from female rats. This was the case whether hepatocytes were isolated from normal or partially hepatectomized male or female rats. Hepatocytes isolated from regenerating liver synthesize more DNA than those isolated from normal liver in response to EGF. This increased response to EGF in hepatocytes derived from regenerating liver was relatively the same for male- and female-derived hepatocytes, but the magnitude of the response was considerably higher in male-derived hepatocytes. In contrast, in vivo DNA synthesis in the liver remnant after partial hepatectomy was similar in male and female rats if measured 24 h after the operation. A comparison of EGF binding to male- and female-derived hepatocytes maintained in primary culture indicated a lower number of high-affinity receptors for EGF in the female hepatocytes. The addition of estrogen to primary cultures of hepatocytes isolated from male rats inhibited EGF binding as well as EGF-induced DNA synthesis. Our studies show significant differences in DNA synthesis in response to EGF when male and female hepatocytes are compared in primary culture. The regenerative response after partial hepatectomy, on the other hand, was the same in male and female rats. Thus, our studies indicate that the sex of the donor, rat is important when hepatocytes in culture are used for a variety of studies, such as hepatocyte metabolism, induction and control of DNA synthesis, and hepatocarcinogenesis. In addition, our results indicate that caution is advised when inferences are made from in vitro findings for in vivo conditions.\r"

In all patients a significant reduction of growth (mean +/- SEM) of colony-forming unit-granulocyte, erythrocyte, macrophage, (megakaryocyte) (CFU-GEM) (1.2 +/- 0.3), burst-forming unit-erythroid (BFU-E) (17 +/- 10), CFU-megakaryocyte (CFU-Mk) (1.7 +/- 0.6), and CFU-granulocyte-macrophage (CFU-GM) (35 +/- 10) was observed in comparison with normal controls. Depletion of T cells from the bone marrow before culture led to a significant increase in colony growth, which indicated an imbalance of the normally modulating T cell subsets. This increase was reversed by readdition of autologous T cells causing a decrease in colony growth to a degree, dependent on the T4 to T8 ratio. A decreased number of hemopoietic progenitor cells and/or a defective modulation of progenitor cell growth, normally carried out by T lymphocyte subsets, might be the cause of the hematological abnormalities in AIDS patients.\r"

Antibody titers were generally lower in sera from patients with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and in sera from men whose condition subsequently progressed to AIDS than in sera from men who had not progressed to AIDS. We found no evidence of isotypic prominence or restriction of the antibody response. In multivariate analysis, lower levels of CD4 helper cells were most highly associated with progression to AIDS. Lower antibody titers to the envelope protein gp110, the core protein p24, and the reverse transcriptase enzyme p51/65 were also predictive of progression to AIDS independent of their association with CD4 cell levels. These data suggest that differences in antibody levels are not simply a consequence of severe immunodeficiency but may be markers for control of infection.\r"

In this paper, we describe that two 2',3'-dideoxynucleoside analogues, erythro 3'-azido-2',3'-dideoxythymidine (also called azidothymidine) and 2',3'-dideoxycytidine can inhibit the infectivity of HTLV-I against helper/inducer T cells in vitro. Both 2',3'-dideoxynucleoside analogues inhibited the overgrowth of target T cells, which was a consequence of virally mediated transformation, when they were exposed to the virus and cultured with the compounds. A profound decrease in the expression of HTLV-I gag-proteins was also observed. Moreover, we observed that the amount of proviral DNA detected in cellular DNA from the target T cells was substantially reduced when the cells were protected by the compounds against the virus and that at certain concentrations of the compounds the synthesis of viral DNA was completely suppressed. These results may be of value in developing a new pharmacological strategy for preventing the replication and possibly blocking the transmission of HTLV-I and related retroviruses in human beings.\r"

  ".U": "87280710\r", 
  ".W": "Interleukin 1 (IL-1) is a family of polypeptides initially found to be produced by activated monocytes and macrophages that mediate a wide variety of cellular responses to injury and infection. Epidermal epithelial cells (keratinocytes) produce \"epidermal cell-derived thymocyte activating factor\" or ETAF, which has been recently shown to be identical to IL-1. Human epidermis is normally exposed to significant amounts of solar ultraviolet radiation. Certain ultraviolet wavelengths (UVB, 290-320 nm) are thought to be responsible for most of the immediate and long-term pathological consequences of excessive exposure to sunlight. In this study, we asked whether exposure to UVB irradiation induced IL-1 gene expression in cultured human keratinocytes. Cultured human keratinocytes contain detectable amounts of IL-1 alpha and beta mRNA and protein in the absence of apparent stimulation; these levels could be significantly enhanced 6 h after exposure to 10 ng/ml of 12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate (TPA). Exposure to UVB irradiation with an emission spectrum comparable to that of sunlight (as opposed to that of an unfiltered artificial UV light source) significantly increased the steady state levels IL-1 alpha and beta mRNA in identical populations of human keratinocytes. This was reflected in the production of increased IL-1 activity by these cultures in vitro. In the same cell population, exposures to UVB irradiation did not alter the level of actin mRNA; therefore, the effect of UV irradiation on IL-1 represents a specific enhancement of IL-1 gene expression. Local increases of IL-1 may mediate the inflammation and vasodilation characteristic of acute UVB-injured skin, and systemic release of this epidermal IL-1 may account for fever, leukocytosis, and the acute phase response seen after excessive sun exposure.\r"

  ".W": "Three preparations of purified von Willebrand factor (vWF), obtained from unrelated patients affected by type IIB von Willebrand disease, were found to have normal sialic acid content (between 129 and 170 nmol/mg of vWF, as compared with 158 +/- 17 nmol/mg in four normal preparations) and to induce platelet aggregation in the presence of physiologic levels of divalent cations and without addition of ristocetin. A monoclonal antibody that blocks the vWF binding domain of the platelet glycoprotein (GP)Ib caused complete inhibition of IIB vWF-induced aggregation. In contrast, a monoclonal antibody that blocks the receptor for adhesive proteins on the platelet GPIIb/IIIa complex failed to inhibit the initial response of platelets to high concentrations of IIB vWF. Moreover, IIB vWF caused agglutination of formalin-fixed platelets that was blocked only by the anti-GPIb antibody, suggesting that the binding of vWF to GPIb, even in the absence of ristocetin, results in platelet-platelet interaction that is followed by exposure of the GPIIb/IIIa receptors for adhesive proteins. Endogenous ADP, normally active platelet metabolism and fibrinogen binding to GPIIb/IIIa were necessary for maximal and irreversible platelet aggregation. In the absence of fibrinogen, however, aggregation was mediated by vWF binding to GPIIb/IIIa. A 52/48-kD tryptic fragment containing the GPIb binding domain of normal vWF completely blocked the aggregation induced by all three IIB vWF preparations. The present study defines in detail the mechanisms involved in IIB vWF-induced platelet aggregation. Moreover, it establishes that the GPIb binding domain of normal and IIB vWF are closely related and that desialylation is not required for the direct interaction of IIB vWF with GPIb.\r"

To investigate the role of T cells in the pathogenesis of this disorder, we compared disease expression in T cell-deficient athymic nude (nu/nu) mice and heterozygotes (nu/+) with normal T cell function. Acute infectious myositis occurred in nu/nu and nu/+ mice. Chronic (greater than 21 d postinfection) weakness and myositis, however, developed only in nu/+. Resistance to disease in nu/nu mice was not explained by insusceptibility to infection; the amount of virus lethal for 50% of mice and virus replication were comparable in both groups. Additionally, anti-CVB 1 antibody production was similar in both groups. Reconstitution of infected nu/nu mice with spleen cells from normal mice resulted in disease. These results demonstrate that chronic weakness after infection with this virus is not simply a sequela of acute myonecrosis and suggest that T cells play a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of chronic myositis.\r"

We wished to determine if TCR rearrangement and expression was lineage restricted, showed any developmental hierarchy, or could identify new subsets of T cells. Rearrangement of gamma and beta TCR genes occurred early in development but in no set order, and most T-ALLs (22/26) were of sufficient maturity to have rearranged both genes. T-ALLs preferentially rearranged C gamma 2 versus the C gamma 1 complex; no preference within the beta locus was apparent. Once rearranged, the beta TCR continued to be expressed (11/13), whereas the gamma TCR was rarely expressed (3/14). The alpha TCR was expressed only in more mature T-ALLs (8/14) that usually displayed T3. The 3A-1 T cell associated antigen appeared earliest in development followed by T11 and T3. Within pre-B cell ALL a higher incidence of lineage spillover was noted for gamma TCR rearrangements (8/17) than for beta rearrangements (3/17). This also contrasts with the only occasional rearrangement of immunoglobulin (Ig) heavy chains (3/25) in T-ALL. However, in pre-B ALL the pattern of gamma TCR usage was distinct from that of T cells, with the C gamma 1 complex utilized more frequently. Almost all ALLs could be classified as pre-B or T cell in type by combining Ig and TCR genes with monoclonal antibodies recognizing surface antigens, although examples of lineage duality were noted. Unique subpopulations of cells were discovered including two genetically uncommitted ALLs that failed to rearrange either Ig or TCR loci. Moreover, two T lymphoblasts were identified that possessed the T3 molecule but failed to express alpha plus beta TCR genes. These T-ALLs may represent a fortuitous transformation of T cell subsets with alternative T3-Ti complexes.\r"

There seems to be a correlation between secondary IgM antibody titre and total serum IgM concentration, although this fails to reach significance (p = 0.069).

  ".W": "The composition of cutaneous lesions from 158 patients with confirmed cutaneous T cell lymphoma, 91 patients with suspected cutaneous T cell lymphoma, and 145 patients with lymphoid disorders other than cutaneous T cell lymphoma was quantitated in situ with the use of commercially available murine monoclonal antibodies that identify the Pan T, T-helper/inducer (Th), T cytotoxic/suppressor (Ts), and Pan B lymphocyte subsets. On average, cutaneous infiltrates of confirmed cutaneous T cell lymphoma were found to contain significantly more Th and less Ts or Pan B cells compared to benign lymphoid disorders. Moreover, when analyzed in terms of the type of lesion examined by biopsy, the absolute amount of Th cells progressively expands with increasing magnitudes of infiltrate in the dermis while the amount of Ts and Pan B cells remains relatively constant among lesions. A useful diagnostic criterion (anti-Leu 1/4 greater than or equal to 70% and anti-Leu 3a/anti-Leu 2a ratio greater than or equal to 6) correctly discriminated between cutaneous T cell lymphoma and non-cutaneous T cell lymphoma in 87.5% of cases. A positive immunodiagnostic result also may be useful for the prediction of subsequent histopathologic confirmation of cutaneous T cell lymphoma in patients who have suspect lymphoid infiltrates, such as alopecia mucinosis or idiopathic generalized erythroderma, when first seen. With the use of multivariate analysis, stage and possibly the percentage of Th cells within the T cell component in cutaneous infiltrates were covariates with significant relationships to survival in patients with confirmed cutaneous T cell lymphoma. In addition, Ts cells in infiltrates did not correlate significantly with observed responses to topical treatment and subsequent course in pretumorous mycosis fungoides. These results indicate that Ts cells play little biologic role in modifying the natural history of cutaneous T cell lymphoma.\r"

Because her primary coelenterate contact occurred at a time when she was receiving systemic corticosteroids, it is assumed that the eruption due to the initial sting was delayed. The third and fourth patients exhibited recurrent eruptions after solitary envenomations by different coelenterates. These case histories demonstrate that multiple recurrent eruptions may follow solitary envenomations by different subphyla of coelenterates, that the initial eruption induced by the sting may be delayed by the administration of high doses of systemic corticosteroids, and that an immunologic reaction in both the B and T cell systems can follow jellyfish envenomation.\r"

Varices were the only potential site of the index bleed in 101 of the 127 patients (79.5%). In addition to varices, other potential sites of bleeding were gastric ulcer in 9 (7%), Mallory-Weiss tear in 4 (3.1%), duodenal ulcer in 3 (2.3%), and multiple gastroduodenal erosions in 10 (7.8%). We used the characteristics of the clinical presentation (e.g., varix seen bleeding) and the known natural course of the variceal bleeding to attempt to define the site of bleeding in the group with more than one potential site. In 15 we could make a judgment as to the likely source: In 9 it was variceal and in 6 nonvariceal. When varices are seen at endoscopy in a patient with a major hemorrhage, they are responsible for the bleeding in greater than 80% of cases.\r"

Other lymphoid tissues such as the thymus and the cervical and mesenteric lymph nodes were almost devoid of such cells with one exception: the perithymic lymph nodes (pt-LN). Twenty-four hours after the cell transfer, viable antigen-specific cells could be recovered from these organs. Within 9 days the pt-LN enlarged, the percentage of W 3/13+ and W 3/25+ T lymphocytes was enhanced, and both relatively high spontaneous and antigen-driven responses were measurable in cell cultures of these lymph nodes. All the effects were observed if viable but not irradiated antigen-specific T blasts were transferred. Moreover, after active immunization, antigen-reactive cells appeared to accumulate not only in the draining but also in the pt-LN. In both experimental situations, the adoptive transfer and the in vivo activation of antigen-specific lymphocytes, the pt-LN appear to play an important role in the homing of such cells.\r"

  ".W": "Cultures of normal spleen cells with anti-idiotypic antibody (anti-Id) or antigen B (AgB)-specific T suppressor factor (Tsf1) in mini-Marbrook chambers for 4 days at 37 degrees C lead to the in vitro induction of AgB-specific T suppressor (TS) cells. These TS cells significantly suppress a secondary AgB-specific IgE response, but they do not affect a secondary AgB-specific IgG response. Depletion of both B cells and macrophages from normal spleen cells by panning on anti-Ig-coated petri dishes provides an enriched T cell population. These enriched T cells when cultured with anti-Id or Tsf1 in mini-Marbrook chambers do not produce AgB-specific TS cells, and mice treated with cells harvested from the mini-Marbrook chambers have normal secondary AgB-specific IgG and IgE responses. The addition of as few as 1000 bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDM) to cultures of the enriched T cells with anti-Id, or Tsf1 restores the ability of these cultures to produce significant levels of AgB-specific TS cells. Further studies reveal that the macrophage population must be histocompatible and express a cell surface I-J antigen. Attempts to pulse BMDM with anti-Id or Tsf1 at 4 degrees C and to culture in mini-Marbrook chambers 10(3) pulsed BMDM with enriched T cells were unsuccessful in producing AgB-specific TS cells. However, pulsing BMDM with anti-Id or Tsf1 at 37 degrees C, and adding 10(3) of these pulsed BMDM to enriched T cells in culture led to the formation of significant levels of AgB-specific TS cells.\r"

The inhibition of enhanced InsP3 level is detected at 30 sec after the addition of anti-IgM, the earliest point measured, and is reversed by 1-(5-isoquinolinesulfonyl)-2-methylpiperazine dihydrochloride, an inhibitor of protein kinase C (PKC). The blockade of increased [Ca2+]i by PMA is also observed at the earliest time examined (15 sec), is reversed by 1-(5-isoquinoline-sulfonyl)-2-methylpiperazine dihydrochloride, and is mimicked by dioctanoylglycerol, a physiologic activator of PKC. The enhanced production of inositol phosphates in response to NaF is also blocked in BAL17 cells pretreated with PMA. Extended treatment of BAL17 cells with PMA depletes cellular PKC. Such pretreatment with PMA enhances rather than inhibits increased InsP3 levels in response to anti-IgM and leads to more sustained elevations in [Ca2+]i than in normal BAL17 cells. These results lead us to conclude that PMA-blockade of the response of B cells to anti-IgM represents a disruption of the transmembrane signaling process (desensitization of the signaling pathway) as a result of a PKC-mediated phosphorylation event.\r"

The class II restriction of T cells primed with MBP 1-11 has been examined in primary cultures in vitro. Similar to encephalitogenic T cell clones, isolated after continuous selection in vitro, the population of MBP 1-11-specific proliferative PL/J and (PLSJ)F1 T cells, recognize this epitope in association with I-Au class II molecules. Not all MBP-specific T cell clones which are restricted to I-Au class II molecules cause autoimmune encephalomyelitis. The specificity of these non-encephalitogenic clones has been examined in this report. These clones also recognize MBP 1-11.

Although liposomes are entering clinical trials, their effect on Il 1 synthesis and release has yet to be determined. The beneficial, as well as possible pathological, effects of liposome therapy may be due to IL 1 released by reticuloendothelial cells. This study examined the effects of multilamellar phospholipid vesicles on the synthesis and release of IL 1 from human peripheral blood monocytes. Liposomes consisting of phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylserine in molar ratio of 7:3 did not stimulate IL 1 release, and did not diminish the level of IL 1 release when monocytes were subsequently stimulated with LPS or Staphylococcus aureus. Surprisingly, LPS encapsulated in liposomes failed to stimulate IL 1 release from monocytes. This defect was limited to the release of IL 1, because monocytes stimulated with liposomes containing LPS had control levels of intracellular (cytosolic) and membrane IL 1. By contrast, LPS associated with lyophilized liposomes induced the secretion of IL 1 and behaved similarly to free LPS. These findings indicate that LPS activation of monocytes may involve not only the synthesis of IL 1 but activation of the secretory mechanism for IL 1, and that these two events could be independent, that the density of LPS molecules at the surface of the liposome may influence the degree of monocyte activation as measured by intracellular IL 1 synthesis, membrane accumulation, and secretion into the medium, and that intracellular lipids may not interfere with the secretory mechanism, because liposomes made with phospholipids differing in acyl chain length or the headgroup behaved identically.\r"

The N-terminal sequence of the first 24 amino acids was consistent with that inferred from the nucleotide sequence of BSF-1 cDNA clones. Amino acid composition analysis also agreed well with that predicted from the nucleotide sequence. A rabbit antibody to a peptide corresponding to positions 100 to 113 inferred from the nucleotide sequence of the cDNA clones bound to BSF-1 purified from EL-4 cells. Purified BSF-1 possesses complex N-linked glycosidic side chains as shown by reduction in Mr from 20,000 to approximately 15,000 by endoglycosidase F but not by endoglycosidase H treatment. Removal of these N-linked sugars does not diminish the activity of BSF-1 as a costimulant in the response of B cells to anti-IgM. By contrast, the reduction of disulfide bonds completely destroyed biologic activity. A monoclonal antibody to BSF-1 blocks its binding to cellular receptors and inhibits biological activities, whereas antibody to the BSF-1 peptide (100-113) has neither effect.\r"

  ".W": "Recently, we reported the isolation of a cDNA clone that encodes a polypeptide which has B cell and T cell growth factor activities. The amino acid sequence of this polypeptide deduced from the nucleotide sequence of the cDNA clone showed significant homology with mouse B cell stimulating factor-1. Because of its multiple biologic activities, it was designated interleukin 4 (IL-4). Here we describe the effects of supernatants of Cos-7 mouse cells transfected with the IL-4 coding cDNA clone in a mammalian expression vector, on human thymocyte T cells and T cell clones. The T cell growth-promoting effect of IL-4 on preactivated T cells was not inhibited by monoclonal antibodies against IL-2 or the IL-2 receptor, indicating that the IL-4 activity is independent from IL-2 or the IL-2 receptor. IL-4 induces a low proliferative response in thymocytes and peripheral blood lymphocytes, but the response was considerably enhanced by preactivation of the thymocytes or peripheral blood T cells. Both T4+ and T8+ antigen-specific proliferative and cytotoxic T cell clones and T3 natural killer clones proliferated in response to IL-4. But one of six T4+ and one of four T8+ T cell clones were consistently found to be unresponsive. The proliferative responses to IL-4 were always lower than those obtained with IL-2. Most of the T cell clones generally became unresponsive to IL-4 10 days after stimulation, but still responded well to IL-2. These results indicate that the responsiveness to IL-4 is relatively short lasting and is regulated by activation signals. Interestingly, IL-4 acted in synergy with IL-2 in promoting the growth of T cell clones. Our results establish that IL-4 can act as a T cell growth factor independently of IL-2.\r"

This factor, designated B cell-derived growth-enhancing factor (BGEF), enhanced IL-1-induced proliferation of peanut agglutinin nonagglutinated thymocytes. BGEF also enhanced IL-1-induced production of interleukin 2 (IL-2) by both thymocytes and a human T cell clone, HSB.2 C5B2. BGEF alone did not induce the production of IL-2. BGEF failed to induce proliferation of the IL-2-dependent T cell clone, and did not enhance its response to IL-2. The activity of BGEF was not blocked by antisera against human IL-1-alpha or human IL-1-beta. Gel filtration analysis revealed that BGEF has a m.w. of 60,000 to 65,000 in its native state. We concluded that BGEF differed from IL-1 and IL-2, but is a novel factor produced by TKS-1 cells. In addition, we found that partially purified B cells from patients with rheumatoid arthritis produced factors which enhanced the activity of IL-1.\r"

  ".W": "Binding of radiolabeled tumor necrosis factor (TNF) to cell surface receptors was markedly reduced in human foreskin fibroblasts and cells from SV-80 and HeLa cell lines subsequent to treatment with interleukin 1 (IL-1) or 4 beta-phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA). The decrease in TNF binding was initiated within minutes of application of IL-1 or PMA and could not be blocked by cycloheximide, suggesting that it is independent of protein synthesis. Scatchard plot analysis of TNF binding to the SV-80 cells indicated that its decrease in response to IL-1 and PMA reflects a reduced amount of TNF receptors, with no change in their affinity. IL-1 and PMA together had an additive effect on TNF binding. Treatment with TNF did not result in decreased binding of IL-1 to its receptors nor did TNF and IL-1 compete directly for their respective receptors. Human U937 cells on which receptors for IL-1 were below detectable levels exhibited no decrease in TNF binding when treated with IL-1, but did so in response to PMA. In addition to a decrease in TNF receptors, cells treated with IL-1 or PMA exhibited a lesser vulnerability to the cytolytic effect of TNF. The two kinds of changes were not completely correlated. A particularly notable dissimilarity was evident when comparing the rate of their reversal: the TNF receptor level was fully recovered within a few hours of removal of IL-1 or of the water-soluble analogue of PMA, 4 beta-phorbol-12,13-dibutyrate, from pretreated SV-80 cells; yet at that time resistance to the cytotoxicity of TNF was still prominent. These findings indicate that IL-1 as well as tumor-promoting phorbol diesters can down regulate cellular response to TNF by inducing a decrease in the number of receptors for TNF, and apparently through some other effect(s) as well.\r"

In our studies adherence was increased twofold to threefold by a 6-hr preincubation of the EC with IL 1. Recombinant human IL 1 alpha induced a maximal adherence response at less than 1 U per 2 X 10(4) EC. In contrast, recombinant murine IL 1 alpha was found to be 250- to 1250-fold less active in the adherence assay, based on units of IL 1 activity defined by the murine thymocyte proliferation assay. Moreover, when EC were preincubated with excess murine IL 1, no inhibition of the adherence-inducing effect of human IL 1 was noted. To characterize further this dichotomy of biological potency of murine and human IL 1 on the adherence assay, IL 1 binding studies were initiated. Recombinant human and murine IL 1 alpha were equally effective in inhibiting the binding of 125I-labeled human and murine IL 1, based on both micrograms of protein and units of IL 1 activity. The results of this study demonstrate that although human and murine IL 1 bind with equal affinity to receptors on human EC, human IL 1 is significantly more potent at inducing the increased EC adhesiveness for lymphocytes. The implications of these results for endothelial cell IL 1 receptor function are discussed.\r"

  ".W": "T cell activation requires two initial signals that first lead to the expression of interleukin 2 (IL 2) receptors and the initiation of IL 2 synthesis and then to T cell proliferation. Jurkat T lymphoma cells have been shown to be a good model for studying IL 2 synthesis because these cells also require two signals for activation. The first signal can be provided by the lectin phytohaemagglutinin (PHA), and the second one by the phorbol ester, 12-o-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate (TPA). The regulation of IL 2 synthesis in Jurkat cells, however, is unclear, and the present study deals with the role of cAMP on IL 2 synthesis. In Jurkat cells, IL 2 synthesis appears to be highly regulated by the activity of adenylate cyclase. This was demonstrated by using different means to increase intracellular cAMP level, namely by using permeant cAMP analogs, using the activator of adenylate cyclase, forskolin, using the activator of the alpha subunit of the stimulatory GTP binding protein cholera toxin, and using inhibitors of phosphodiesterase. In addition, prostaglandins E1 and E2 were shown to bind specifically to Jurkat cells, to induce a rise in intracellular cAMP level, and to markedly decrease IL 2 synthesis. All together, these results suggest that in T lymphocytes, the prostaglandin E2 receptor is linked to adenylate cyclase through a GTP binding protein and regulates the production of IL 2 by controlling the intracellular cAMP level.\r"

The mechanism of this upregulation was characterized on Fc epsilon R+ murine B cell hybridoma lines. Measurements of [35S]methionine incorporated into the Fc epsilon R over time indicated that IgE did not appreciably increase the rate of Fc epsilon R synthesis. In contrast analysis of Fc epsilon R decay from surface radioiodinated B hybridoma cells demonstrated that IgE acted to slow the rate of Fc epsilon R degradation. Very little endocytosis of monomeric IgE was seen; this, combined with the observation that lysomotropic agents failed to inhibit Fc epsilon R degradation suggested that decay occurs at the cell surface. A soluble receptor immunoassay was developed, using monoclonal anti-Fc epsilon R, and this assay demonstrated that cell-bound IgE inhibited the release into the culture media of soluble immunoreactive Fc epsilon R. Examination of the soluble Fc epsilon R by SDS-PAGE after isolation with monoclonal anti-Fc epsilon R demonstrated that it was 10,000 m.w. smaller than the cell-associated Fc epsilon R. IgE affinity columns failed to bind the Fc epsilon R fragment, indicating that the ligand binding activity was largely lost. Thus this study demonstrated that IgE-dependent Fc epsilon R induction on B cells occurs because IgE upon binding to the B cell surface, inhibits the proteolytic cleavage and release of the Fc epsilon R into the surrounding medium, and it is this inhibition of degradation that causes the higher Fc epsilon R levels.\r"

Endo and exoglycosidase treatment demonstrated that the mature receptor is composed of two to three complex-type N-linked oligosaccharides and contains sialic acid. Pulse-chase experiments indicated that the receptor is synthesized as a 44,000 dalton precursor that begins to be processed by 1 hr to the mature 49,000 dalton form, and the latter is expressed at the cell surface by 2 hr. It was determined that the processing included the conversion of N-linked oligosaccharides to the complex type as well as an additional processing event, because in the presence of tunicamycin, the receptor is synthesized as a 36,000 dalton precursor that is processed to a 38,000 dalton species. Analysis of the effects of tunicamycin treatment and endo F digestion on soluble Fc epsilon R isolated from cell supernatants demonstrated the existence of several m.w. species of Fc epsilon R fragments, and indicated that only the higher m.w. fragments were N-glycosylated. The use of several inhibitors of the N-linked carbohydrate processing pathway demonstrated that the addition of core N-linked side-chains, but not their processing to the complex type, is required for cell surface expression of Fc epsilon R. Also, processing of N-linked carbohydrate is not required for ligand binding activity. Finally, IgE affinity chromatography indicated that the 49,000 and 38,000 dalton (tunicamycin) Fc epsilon R bind IgE more effectively than their precursor forms, 44,000 and 36,000 daltons, respectively, indicating that a processing event independent of N-linked glycosylation is necessary for optimal ligand binding activity.\r"

However, Asn86 of H-2Kb contained a higher ratio (5 to 1), while Asn86 of H-2Kk a lower ratio (1.5 to 1). This difference was seen on antigens isolated from cells of the parental strains as well as from the F1 cross. The glycosylation of H-2Kk did not vary between B10.A and C3H mice. Mitogenic stimulation increased markedly both total [3H]mannose incorporation and the spectrum of N-linked oligosaccharides labeled. For H-2Kk, it had no effect on sialylation, but resulted in a slight under galactosylation of the monosialylated structures at both sites. A comparison of the patterns seen here, determined on nontransformed T cells, with those previously determined on H-2Kk from a B lymphoma line, revealed marked differences in sialylation and branching patterns at both sites. These data indicate that glycosylation differences may be found between highly homologous (91%) alleles of an H-2 gene, even when co-dominantly expressed by F1 cells; however, the patterns do change with mitogenic stimulation, and between normal and transformed cells.\r"

  ".W": "A new T cell molecule defined by the mAb 143-4-2 has been identified that is involved in T cell activation. The expression of the 143-4-2-defined epitope is linked to the previously characterized Ly-6 locus and restricted to bone marrow cells and to a subset of peripheral Lyt-2+ cells. In comparison to other anti-Ly-6.2 mAb, the 143-4-2 mAb appears to be directed at an allogeneic determinant of the Ly-6.2C molecule. The anti-Ly-6.2C antibody can promote the lysis of antigen-non-bearing target cells by alloreactive CTL clones, and in the presence of cofactors (PMA or IL 2) induces a subset of Lyt-2+ cells to proliferate, perhaps through an autocrine pathway. Although the antibody described has antigen-like effects as described for anti-TcR complex reagents, studies performed with a recently derived anti-murine T3 mAb suggest that the Ly-6.2C molecule is not associated on the cell surface with components of the TcR complex. Nevertheless, cell surface expression of the TcR complex is required for optimal triggering of T cells via the Ly-6.2C molecule. Because Ly-6.2C determinants are expressed in bone marrow and not in the thymus, the possibility is considered that expression of this molecule identifies a distinct subset of extrathymically derived T cells.\r"

To determine if this acute-phase response involves a change in the rate of hepatic protein synthesis and if it is due to a direct effect of IL 2 on hepatocytes, human hepatoma-derived hepatocytes (Hep-3B cells) were incubated in medium containing IL 2 or in culture supernatants from IL 2-activated human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMNC). The rate of synthesis of two acute-phase proteins, complement protein factor B and albumin, was determined by the incorporation of a radiolabeled amino acid precursor into newly synthesized protein as measured by analytical gel electrophoresis of immunoprecipitates. IL 2 in concentrations from 1 to 1000 U/ml had no effect on the synthesis of factor B or albumin; conversely, there was a dose-dependent increase in the rate of synthesis of factor B and decrease in albumin synthesis mediated by culture supernatants of IL 2-activated PBMNC. The magnitude of the effect of acute-phase protein synthesis was dependent on the IL 2 concentration used for the activation of PBMNC. The rate of factor B synthesis increased approximately 4.0-fold in the presence of culture supernatants of PBMNC activated with either opsonized heat-killed Staphylococcus albus or with 1000 U/ml IL 2. Preincubation of the IL 2-activated PBMNC culture supernatants with an antiserum specific for recombinant IL 1-beta completely neutralized the capacity of the supernatants to stimulate factor B synthesis, whereas antisera specific for human IL 1-alpha or for tumor necrosis factor had no effect. These results indicate that the indirect effect of IL 2 on hepatic acute phase protein synthesis is mediated by IL 1-beta.\r"

  ".W": "A murine monoclonal anti-tumor antibody termed SN2 (Ab1), isotype IgG1-kappa, that defines a unique human T cell leukemia-associated cell-surface glycoprotein, gp37 (m.w. 37,000), was used to generate monoclonal anti-idiotype antibodies (Ab2) in syngeneic BALB/c mice. The Ab2 were screened on the basis of their binding to the F(ab')2 fragments of SN2 and not to the F(ab')2 of pooled normal BALB/c mice sera IgG1 or to an unrelated BALB/c monoclonal antibody of the same isotype. Fifteen Ab2, obtained from two fusions, were specific for the SN2 idiotope and not against isotype or allotype determinants. To find out whether these Ab2 are directed against the paratope of SN2, the binding of radiolabeled SN2 to leukemic MOLT-4 and JM cells which contain gp37 as a surface constituent was studied in the presence of these anti-idiotopes. Clone 4EA2 inhibited the binding 100% at a concentration of 50 ng and 4DC6 inhibited 90% at a concentration of 250 ng. A third clone 4DD6 gave about 50% inhibition. Similar was the inhibition of SN2 binding to insolubilized MOLT-4 antigen or cell membrane preparation. The binding of SN2 (Ab1) to 4EA2 and 4DC6 was also inhibited by semipurified preparation of gp37 antigen. These results demonstrate that at least two of the anti-idiotope antibodies are binding either at or near the binding site idiotope of SN2. Next, the purified Ab2 was used to immunize syngeneic mice to induce antibody binding to MOLT-4 cells or gp37. Sera from mice immunized with 4EA2 and 4DC6 coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin contained antibodies which bind to semipurified gp37 antigen and MOLT-4 cells. Immune sera inhibited the binding of iodinated Ab2 and Ab1 indicating that an anti-anti-idiotopic antibody (Ab3) in mice shares idiotopes with Ab1 (SN2). Also, the binding of iodinated Ab2 to Ab1 was inhibited by rabbit antisera specific for gp37. Collectively, these data suggest that anti-idiotype antibodies 4EA2 and 4DC6 may be useful in the generation of idiotype vaccines against human T cell leukemia.\r"

Therapy with acyclovir delayed and diminished the antibody response to gD, although by day 60 the titers of antibody to gD in acyclovir-treated animals were not significantly different from those in controls.

All strains were type b, were biotype I, were type 12 by isoenzyme analysis, and harbored plasmids whose mass was 45 or 52 megadaltons. Restriction endonuclease analysis indicated that the plasmids were closely related to one another but that there were at least three distinct plasmids. The four index strains had two different outer membrane protein profiles and three distinct plasmid restriction patterns; an additional outer membrane protein profile and plasmid restriction pattern were found in carrier strains.\r"

Fifty eight patients (57%) had developed multiple sclerosis at the time of reassessment in the present study, of whom 51 (88%) had clinically definite disease. This compared with 40% of the original group, in 1978, of whom 62% then had clinically definite multiple sclerosis. When the life-table method of analysis was used, the probability of developing multiple sclerosis was 75%, 15 years after the initial episode of optic neuritis. The frequencies of HLA-DR2 and the recently defined D-region antigen, DQw1, were significantly increased in patients with isolated optic neuritis and those who subsequently developed multiple sclerosis compared with normal controls, but neither allele appears to influence progression from optic neuritis to multiple sclerosis. Patients with optic neuritis who were HLA-DR3 positive had an increased risk for the development of multiple sclerosis (RR = 2.8) and this risk was further enhanced when DR3 occurred in combination with DR2 (RR = 6.7). The overall increased risk of developing multiple sclerosis for patients with this combination was 26 times that for the normal population. When the patients' original tissue-typing was considered BT 101 no longer influenced conversion of optic neuritis to multiple sclerosis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Dementia was diagnosed from a history of mental deterioration, disorientation and hallucinations. All Down's syndrome subjects were trisomy 21 karyotype. CMRglc also was examined in 15 healthy men aged 20-35 years and in 20 healthy men aged 45-64 years. All subjects were at rest with eyes covered and ears plugged. Mean hemispheric CMRglc in the older Down's syndrome subjects was significantly less, by 23%, than in the young Down's syndrome group; statistically significant decreases in regional metabolism (rCMRglc) also were present in all lobar regions. Comparison of the younger control group with the older control group showed no difference in CMRglc or any rCMRglc (p greater than 0.05). Assessment of language, visuospatial ability, attention and memory showed significant reductions in test scores of the old as compared with the young Down's syndrome subjects. These results show that significant age differences in CMRglc and rCMRglc occur in Down's syndrome but not in healthy controls, and that, although only some older Down's syndrome subjects are demented, significant age reductions in neuropsychologic variables occur in all of them.\r"

Using a GE 8800 CT/T scanner, slices parallel to and from 30 to 80 mm above the IOM line were analysed for CSF volume. Cerebral atrophy, indicated by increased CSF volume, was correlated significantly with global CMRglc, but accounted for no more than 13% of the variance in the CMRglc measurements. Methods for correcting for inter-subject variation in CSF volume were proposed. Global values for CMRglc, uncorrected or corrected for CSF volume, were found to be age invariant.

Out of 12 patients in the first group, 8 survived and resumed their previous activities; in the second group (i.e. patients with clinical and/or CT evidence of adjacent intraparenchymal bleeding only three patients survived, two with considerable handicap. The overall prognosis, however, was significantly better in patients with IVH of unknown cause. Altered sensorium as an initial presentation was associated with a grave prognosis, irrespective of the cause of IVH. The outcome was not affected by the age of patient or the amount of blood within the ventricles. Our data suggest a favourable outcome in a relatively large percentage of patients with spontaneous IVH, if there is no clinical or CT evidence of concomitant parenchymal bleeding. Hence we question the notion that there is a grave prognosis in all kinds of IVH.\r"

  ".W": "Regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) and glucose metabolism (rCMRglc) were measured in 44 patients with various kinds of focal vascular brain lesions, using multislice positron emission tomography (PET). Haemodynamic data were obtained by a recently developed, non-invasive clearance method utilizing (18F)-methyl fluoride as a diffusible, gaseous indicator. Shortly after completion of each flow study, rCMRglc was dynamically determined by standard procedures using 2(18F)-fluorodeoxyglucose. While blood flow and glucose consumption in the structurally damaged area were often uncoupled during the acute phase, metabolism-to-flow ratios were markedly less scattered at later stages of cerebrovascular disease. Individual maximum-likelihood cluster analysis of brain regions revealed remarkable similarity between deactivation patterns of rCBF and rCMRglc, with Tanimoto coefficients averaging 0.56. This similarity was inversely related to the residual rCMRglc of the lesion. These findings are in line with results obtained by PET of other tracers, suggesting that the pair of methods provides valuable and somewhat complementary information on brain function and mechanisms of cerebral vascular disease.\r"

Centered around an eight-track instrumentation tape recorder, the system solves several problems encountered in gathering this type of research data: (1) slowly changing variables are digitized and compressed onto a single track by recording them in one serial message, allowing for recording many more variables than there are tape tracks available; (2) simultaneous analog recording allows retention of original data for variables that may be processed subsequently by multiple schemes; (3) data acquisition is verified with both analog chart recording and numerical video display monitors; (4) off-line computer processing time is decreased at least twofold by using tape playback speeds faster than the recording speed; (5) cost is kept low by using an inexpensive 1/4-inch (0.64-cm) tape medium and dedicated microcomputers; and (6) the system is unobtrusive, portable, and easily reconfigured for different clinical studies. It proved to be reliable in a study of more than 80 patients undergoing cardiac surgery.\r"

Blood-to-brain influx constants (Ki) were calculated for [11C]PUT. Tumor uptake of 11C after [11C]PUT injection was unidirectional peaking at 15 min. The mean +/- s.d. Kis for [11C]PUT for tumor and normal brain tissue were 0.78 +/- 0.045 and 0.024 +/- 0.007 ml cc-1 min-1, respectively (average of ratio, 3.11) whereas the ratio of GMR for tumor and normal brain tissue was 1.2 +/- 0.5. The mean Ki for four active, high grade astrocytomas was 0.098 +/- 0.030 in contrast to 0.027 +/- 0.008 ml cc-1 min-1 for two patients with low grade astrocytoma. Active high grade astrocytomas also showed marked CT contrast enhancement and regional glucose hypermetabolism. In one subject with brain metastases, both [11C]PUT and GMR correlated with a declining clinical picture in repeated studies over a 4-mo period. PET studies with [11C]PUT provide a better signal:noise ratio than GMR measurements, are useful for locating small glycolytically hypometabolic tumors and, when used in longitudinal studies in a single subject, appear to provide an index of degree of malignancy.\r"

  ".W": "The effect of percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) on myocardial perfusion reserve has not been previously determined. Accordingly, 11 patients underwent positron imaging with [13N]ammonia or 82Rb at rest and following dipyridamole + handgrip stress before and after PTCA. The ratio of stress to rest activity (S:R) was determined for each region of interest. Relative myocardial perfusion reserve by positron tomography (RMPR) was calculated by dividing S:R of the stenotic area by a corresponding value from a normal reference area of the same patient. Automated quantitative coronary arteriography was used to objectively measure the percent diameter (%D) and the percent area narrowing (%A) of the stenoses. In nine patients with successful PTCA, %D and %A improved (68 +/- 10 to 49 +/- 15% and 92 +/- 3 to 72 +/- 5%) and RMPR increased from 0.79 +/- 0.07 to 0.96 +/- 0.05. In the two patients in whom PTCA was unsuccessful, RMPR was unchanged. Changes in RMPR correlated inversely with changes in %D (r = -0.68) and %A (r = -0.92) and directly with improved coronary flow reserve derived from all stenosis measurements (r = 0.73, p less than 0.001 for each). This study suggests that dipyridamole + handgrip stress imaging with PET can be used to assess changes in myocardial perfusion reserve before and after PTCA with the potential for determining restenosis noninvasively.\r"

A diagnostic sensitivity of 0.96 was achieved when the results of either MRI or SPECT was considered evidence of internal joint derangement. Five symptomatic TMJs, clinically thought to be abnormal, were positive on SPECT but showed no evidence of anterior disk displacement at the time of arthrography. In such instances, SPECT may be detecting functionally significant altered joint mechanics that are not evident on anatomic imaging of the TMJ.\r"

This simulation was used to evaluate changes caused by increasing the number of views from 60 to 180 and to compare results to published angular sampling requirements. Also, a comparison was made of step-and-shoot and continuous data acquisition modes. Experimental phantom data were taken for three acquisition modes and for two levels of image statistics and compared with the simulation. This study shows the effects of angular aliasing and that image quality generally improves with increasing views even if total image counts are reduced. Despite smoothing effects, a continuous (180 view) scan is, in most cases, the preferred acquisition mode because it offers the highest angular sampling, as well as maximum counting efficiency.\r"

  ".W": "A new automated edge detection program has been developed to estimate left ventricular mass from single photon emission computed tomographic (SPECT) 201Tl images and 14 dogs were studied. Six of the 14 dogs underwent imaging before and 5 hr after coronary artery occlusion with a closed-chest technique. True left ventricular mass was determined at time of killing within 1 hr of the last 201Tl study. Left ventricular mass determined by tomography correlated well with autopsy left ventricular mass (r = 0.94; p less than 0.001, s.e.e. = 5.9 g) over a range of 62-156 g. The intraobserver variation between repeated measurements of the same SPECT study yielded an r = 0.99; p less than 0.0001; s.e.e. = 2.3 g. The reproducibility of the mass determination was assessed in four animals with two studies performed 10-14 days apart. The estimate of left ventricular mass from the two studies were highly correlated (r = 0.98; p less than 0.001) with a mean absolute difference of 4 g (3.3%). In the six dogs with a control and postinfarct study the mean total left ventricular mass by 201Tl tomography varied by less than 3.8% (r = 0.89; p less than 0.001). In conclusion, tomographic imaging with 201Tl can define left ventricular mass accurately and reproducibly in the dog model. The ability of this 201Tl tomographic left ventricular mass program to measure both normal and infarcted tissue accurately suggests the possibility of documenting interventions designed to alter left ventricular mass and of sizing acute infarcts and assessing interventions that may alter acute infarct size.\r"

The fate of [1-11C] and [1-14C]palmitate was studied in 13 open-chest dogs during control or ischemic extracorporeal perfusion of the left circumflex coronary artery. Residue detection of myocardial radioactivity, and radio-biochemical analyses of sequential transmural biopsies and arterial and coronary venous effluent were performed for 30 min after intracoronary bolus administration of tracer. In control hearts, 10.3% of initially extracted tracer was retained in tissue (2.9% in triglyceride, 3.5% in phospholipid, and 3.9% in other lipid and aqueous fractions), 73.7% was oxidized, and 16.1% back-diffused unaltered. With ischemia (pump flow 10% of normal), 28.1% was retained (18% in triglyceride, 6.0% in phospholipid, and 4.1% in other lipid and aqueous fractions), 27.2% was oxidized, and 44.4% back diffused (p less than 0.05 compared to control). Throughout the 30-min study interval, triglyceride, diglyceride, and nonesterified fatty acid comprised a significantly greater fraction of initially extracted radioactivity in ischemic than in control hearts. Thus, during ischemia externally detected clearance rates cannot be used as a direct measure of fatty acid metabolism because of marked influences on efflux of nonmetabolized radiolabeled palmitate and the distribution of tracer retained in tissue. Quantitative measurements of specific metabolic processes by tomography will require development and validation of tracers confined to individual metabolic pathways or pools.\r"

We established a statewide surveillance system for the reporting of all forms of invasive Hib disease from physicians, clinical laboratories, county health departments, and infection control practitioners from all hospitals in and bordering Oklahoma. For the 2-year period March 15, 1984, to March 15, 1986, there were 409 culture-confirmed cases of invasive Hib disease in children 12 years of age or younger; 147 (37%) case-patients attended day care. When a case-patient attended day care during the week before illness, we prospectively identified and observed all classroom contacts (n = 2147) for the next 60 days. Of 1253 classroom contacts younger than 4 years of age, seven (0.6%) secondary cases were identified. Isolates from all paired index and secondary cases had identical outer membrane protein (OMP) patterns. Strains causing primary disease were indistinguishable by OMP distribution from those causing secondary disease. Of 685 classroom contacts younger than 2 years of age from whom rifampin use was ascertained, five (1.7%) of 292 who did not receive rifampin became secondary cases, compared with one (0.3%) of 393 who received rifampin (rate ratio 6.7; 95% confidence limits 1.1, 42.5; P less than 0.05). Of 495 classroom contacts 24 to 47 months of age for whom rifampin use was ascertained, one (0.5%) of 194 who did not receive rifampin became a secondary case, compared with none of 301 who received rifampin. This experience indicates that secondary transmission of invasive Hib disease can be appreciable in day care settings, particularly in children younger than 2 years of age, and that rifampin prophylaxis reduces this risk.\r"

The patients were observed for 1 years, when clinically infected and noninfected. Although noninfected patients had GEC levels within the normal range, the mean value was significantly higher than the mean values in patients in an optimal noninfectious state (P less than 0.01) and in healthy controls (P less than 0.001). Clinical signs of (in most cases) low-grade infection were paralleled by significant increases in GEC levels (P less than 0.001). There was no correlation with different types of bacteria or age of patients. No cross reaction to Pseudomonas elastase could be found in vitro or in vivo. Significant decreases of GEC values were seen after intravenously administered antimicrobial therapy (P less than 0.001), and although the white blood cell count and erythrocyte sedimentation rate were rarely increased above the normal range, they decreased congruently (P less than 0.001), and lung function improved (P less than 0.001). The sensitivity of GEC was significantly higher than that for erythrocyte sedimentation rate (P less than 0.01) and white blood cell count (P less than 0.05). Determination of GEC values seems to be a simple and sensitive measurement for monitoring treatment in cystic fibrosis, especially of low-grade infections in patients with normal standard blood tests.\r"

Infants of drug abusers had a lower proliferative response to mitogen, associated with altered kinetics of the maximum response to PHA. The OKT4/OKT8 ratio decreased with age in the drug-exposed infants compared with control infants (P less than 0.005). There was no evidence of CMV infection in either group. One mother and her infant had antibody to HIV. Our data demonstrate that infants of intravenous drug-using mothers have distinct immunologic differences at birth compared with non-drug-exposed infants and that these persist throughout the first year of life. The cause appears unrelated to intrauterine viral infection, suggesting a direct toxic effect of the drugs on fetal immunologic development.\r"

Marijuana often aggravated chronic pulmonary symptoms, although some patients reported transient relief during use. Comparison with a retrospectively selected control group did not show faster short-term pulmonary deterioration in the tobacco smokers. Physicians who deal with cystic fibrosis and other chronic illnesses should be cognizant of interactions of unprescribed and prescribed drugs. Recreational use of unprescribed psychoactive drugs should be considered if unexpected symptoms occur in older patients.\r"

A dose-response curve for MPTP and its oxidized metabolite, MPP+, revealed IC50 values of 160 and 16 microM, respectively. MPTP (5 mM) and MPP+ (5 mM), maximally inhibited H+-driven NMN (50 microM) uptake by 86.0 and 86.6%, respectively. Additionally, serotonin (0.5 mM) and harmaline (0.5 mM) inhibited NMN transport by 65.8 and 87.1%, respectively. Mepiperphenidol (Darstine) (0.5 mM), a classical organic cation competitor, inhibited NMN transport by 80.6%. However, dopamine (0.5 mM) was not as effective and resulted in only 24.9% inhibition. The cationic specificity was demonstrated by showing that MPP+ and MPTP had no effect on the transport of the organic anion, p-aminohippurate. Additionally, the effect of MPP+ on NMN was not due to either a voltage effect or vesicle disruption. In countertransport studies, MPTP acted as an elicitor of NMN counterflow and produced trans stimulation whereas MPP+ did not and resulted in trans inhibition. Inasmuch as transport involves both binding and translocation we speculate that MPTP binds and is translocated; in contrast MPP+ binds and is not translocated. These reagents may serve as a basis for elucidating the structure-activity requirements of the organic cation/H+ antiporter.\r"

  ".W": "Using the frog sciatic nerve as an in vitro model system, the effects of 10(-5) M nocodazole, an antimitotic drug, on rapid axoplasmic transport were quantified and tested for reversibility. After pulse-labeling the 8th dorsal root ganglia with [3H]leucine, the nerves were incubated for 4.5 to 9 hr at 25 degrees C. Transport velocities and amounts of transported material were determined from the distribution of radioactively labeled proteins. One nerve per animal served as a control. Before ganglia labeling, the nerves were preincubated for 1 or 15 hr in 10(-5) M nocodazole, respectively. In one set of experiments, the nerves were preincubated in nocodazole for 6 hr washed for 1.5 hr and further treated in Ringer's solution to test for reversibility. We found that nocodazole did not affect the maximal transport velocity under any of the conditions tested. The amounts of rapidly transported material were reduced to 60% of controls after 1 hr of pretreatment with nocodazole, and to 30% after 6 to 15 hr of pretreatment. There was no indication for a reversibility of these effects. We conclude that 10(-5) M nocodazole shows maximal effects on rapid axoplasmic transport only if given several hours before protein synthesis, and that it reduces the capacity of rapid axoplasmic transport without affecting transport velocity. These effects are not reversible during the survival time of the in vitro preparation.\r"

  ".W": "We compared the effects of epidermal growth factor-urogastrone (EGF-URO) with those of transforming growth factor-alpha (TGF-alpha) on regional blood flow in the anesthetized dog in vivo, and on isolated canine helical coronary artery strips in vitro. Like EGF-URO, TGF-alpha was a potent stimulator of femoral arterial blood flow in vivo; and, when added to the tissue bath in vitro before an agonist, TGF-alpha like EGF-URO was a potent inhibitor of the contractile responses of helical coronary arterial strips to various smooth muscle agonists: norepinephrine (NE), prostaglandin F2 alpha (PGF alpha) and potassium chloride (KCl). Nonetheless, there were marked differences between EGF-URO and TGF-alpha in terms of the two biological responses measured. In terms of blood flow, although the ED50 for the increase in blood flow was similar for EGF-URO and TGF-alpha (ED50 = 0.4 micrograms EGF-URO equivalents per dose), the maximum responsiveness to TGF-alpha (130% increase in flow) was substantially greater than the maximum response to EGF-URO (70% increase in flow). Furthermore, TGF-alpha did not cause tachyphylaxis to subsequent doses of TGF-alpha, whereas a prior dose of either EGF-URO or TGF-alpha desensitized markedly the blood flow preparations to EGF-URO. Different desensitization patterns for the actions of EGF-URO and TGF-alpha also were observed in the arterial strip preparations. The inhibitory action of EGF-URO for agonist (NE, PGF2 alpha or KCl)-mediated contraction was diminished with repeated exposure of the tissue to EGF-URO, whereas the inhibitory action of TGF-alpha persisted with repetitive tissue exposure.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Benzo(a)pyrene (BaP) has been shown previously to affect humoral immunity in part through alterations in the normal functioning of macrophages. In this study we investigated several specific events affected by BaP. Concanavalin A-elicited macrophages from BaP-exposed animals had a decreased capacity to present keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH) to nylon wool nonadherent, KLH-primed lymph node T cells. BaP treatment 7 days before and after administration of KLH resulted in a decrease in the responsiveness of KLH primed T cells to antigen. BaP administration beginning 3 days before (day -3), concurrently with (day 0) or 7 days after (day +7) KLH antigen treatment had no effect on the ability of KLH primed T cells to respond to KLH presented by untreated macrophages. The decreased capacity of BaP-exposed macrophages to present KLH is due in part to a decrease in the amount of KLH taken up by these cells. There was no alteration in the amount of soluble interleukin-1 released by BaP exposed cells or was there a change in the expression of membrane associated interleukin-1. BaP treatment resulted in a dose-dependent increase in the percentage of Ia+ macrophages. These results demonstrate that BaP affects antigen presentation through alteration in macrophage function.\r"

The major fraction of the alkaloids reside in a synaptosomal fraction and are present in tissues as the sulfate conjugate. The levels of morphine in the spinal cord and the urinary excretion of morphine are elevated in the arthritic rat model. We used extracted alkaloid samples from arthritic rats spinal cord for analysis by mass spectrometry and found molecular ions identical with morphine and codeine.

  ".W": "The effect of capsaicin on the rat vas deferens was examined in relation to the role of endogenous calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) in modifying the contractility of smooth muscles. Capsaicin attenuated the twitch response of the rat vas deferens induced by the transmural nerve stimulation (TNS) in vitro. The effect of capsaicin was transient and developed tachyphylaxis rapidly. Capsaicin inhibited the contraction induced by the direct electrical stimulation of the innervated tissues in the presence of tetrodotoxin but not of the surgically denervated tissues. CGRP-like immunoreactive nerves were demonstrated to be present in the rat vas deferens. Exogenously applied CGRP inhibited both the TNS-induced twitch response and the contraction induced by direct electrical stimulation. Both capsaicin and CGRP slightly hyperpolarized the resting membrane potential of smooth muscle cells but did not affect the amplitude of the excitatory junction potentials. The intensity of CGRP-like immunoreactivity was reduced markedly after the in vitro incubation of the tissue with capsaicin. No CGRP-like immunoreactive nerves were detected in the denervated tissues. Thus, capsaicin inhibited both the TNS-induced twitch response and the contraction induced by direct stimulation of the smooth muscles only when CGRP-like immunoreactive nerves were normally present. These results suggest that capsaicin releases endogenous CGRP and that the released CGRP inhibits the contraction of the rat vas deferens by acting directly on smooth muscle cells but not on the sympathetic nerves.\r"

The data obtained by genetic analyses of murine lupus are a most useful guide for studies on autoimmunity, as related to (1) the type or subset of immune cells expressing each autoimmune disease gene; (2) how each gene or the cell (in which the gene is activated) plays a role in the etiopathogenesis of the disease; and (3) how the gene actions can be manipulated. Data on aspects of the genetic and cellular basis of murine lupus, particularly as related to the anti-DNA antibody synthesis in the (NZB X NZW)F1 hybrid mice are presented based on studies done in our laboratories.\r"

Relatively unique profiles tend to characterize disease groups, but SLE sera were heterogeneous, displaying reactivity with only 1 to all 5 histones. Antihistone antibodies from human sera as well as murine monoclonal antibodies showed the capacity to react with more than 1 histone class. However, the fine specificities of antihistone antibodies were often assay dependent. Explanations for these discrepancies include degraded and impure histone preparations, irreversible denaturation and the role of soluble histones in biological fluids.\r"

In contrast, the IgM released by normal cultured lymphocytes in vitro expresses this idiotype family but does not bind DNA. Both idiotype 4.6.3 and anti-DNA antibodies are frequently detectable in the serum of patients with monoclonal IgM but not IgG. Therefore, it is likely that idiotype 4.6.3 reflects the expression of a common germ line immunoglobulin gene family.

B cell hyperactivity and autoantibody production are the hallmarks of this illness. In humans with SLE, there is increased stem cell, B cell precursor and B cell proliferation. The same is true of NZB mice. In lpr/lpr and gld/gld mice, marked expansion of a subpopulation of T cells allows extrathymic terminal T cell maturation and secondary B cell hyperactivity. Androgens suppress these processes and polyclonal immune activators accelerate them. Three types of genes are identified: inducing genes, accelerating genes and background genes. These give rise to abnormal expression of various cellular oncogenes, T cell receptor genes and immunoglobulin genes. The data suggest that abnormal immune regulation plays a critical role in the development of SLE, with polyclonal B cell activation being common to both mice and humans with SLE. Different genetic and cellular abnormalities underlie the ultimate syndrome, the common denominator, generalized autoimmunity, that we call SLE.\r"

In this report characteristics of 3 classes of autoantibodies are described. Anti-(U1) RNP antibodies recognize the U1 specific 70K and/or A and/or C proteins. Anti-Sm antibodies recognize proteins associated with all U snRNA, primarily the B', B and D proteins. Anti-(U1,U2) RNP sera contain antibodies directed against the U2 specific A' or B\" proteins. These antibodies are useful tools for studying the structure and function of U snRNP complexes. Using mutant U2 snRNA and monospecific antibodies directed against the U2 specific proteins, we analyzed the interactions between proteins and RNA in the U2 snRNP particle. We have also isolated recombinant clones containing cDNA of mRNA coding for a number of snRNA associated proteins. Possible directions of future research are discussed.\r"

  ".W": "Certain DNA binding proteins are thought to organize the mammalian genome into distinct 3 dimensional structures, each characteristic of a given differentiated state. Autoantibodies to 2 types of DNA binding protein complexes, the nuclear lamina and p70/p80 (Ku), were identified in sera of patients with collagen vascular diseases. The intranuclear distribution, DNA binding, and behavior during mitosis of these antigens were examined using autoimmune sera and murine monoclonal antibodies. In vivo, the antigens have different intranuclear distributions and solubility characteristics. However, both antigens appear to reversibly bind to DNA during interphase and to rapidly dissociate from DNA during mitosis. Although the binding affinity of p70/p80 to DNA is heterogeneous, the interaction between p70/p80 and DNA in vitro is stable over 2 h or more. The rapid dissociation of p70/p80 from DNA during mitosis may therefore be mediated by a modification in either chromatin structure or in the p70/p80 antigen itself. Other proteins that reversibly interact with DNA, such as the lamins and nuclear pores, may have a role in the organization of DNA into transcribable euchromatin and nontranscribable heterochromatin. Autoantibodies to these proteins, and possibly those reactive with p70/p80, or other DNA binding proteins may be useful probes for studying both chromatin organization and the causes of autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus.\r"
