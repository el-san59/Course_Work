  ".W": "The purpose of this study was to differentiate by means of electrophysiologic study, a drug's ability to terminate or to prevent ventricular tachycardia (VT). Differences between the 2 effects were examined in patients with VT and the underlying mechanisms were studied in verapamil-responsive idiopathic sustained VT. The clinical significance of the distinction for chronic oral drug therapy is discussed. Thirty-five cases of inducible sustained VT were studied. A drug was considered \"preventive\" if it prevented VT induction and repetitive ventricular response, and \"terminating\" if it stopped induced VT within 15 complexes or could stop VT after its intravenous administration. Prevention and termination occurred together in 13 of 19 cases (68%) with disopyramide, in 10 of 19 cases (53%) with procainamide, in 8 of 12 cases (67%) with lidocaine, in 11 of 15 cases (73%) with mexiletine, and in 10 of 16 cases (63%) with verapamil. In the 16 in which verapamil terminated VT, VT rate immediately before termination slowed markedly from 167 +/- 33 to 134 +/- 28 beats/min. In the 6 cases without preventative effects, minimal and maximal premature intervals for VT induction increased significantly, from 291 +/- 70 to 335 +/- 85 ms and 323 +/- 68 to 423 +/- 109 ms, respectively, after verapamil administration. In 2 cases in which verapamil had a terminating effect, 5 mg of verapamil restored sinus rhythm but 10 mg caused premature beats resembling VT complexes. In another 2, 5 mg of verapamil lengthened the minimal premature interval; 10 mg increased both minimal and maximal premature intervals and lengthened the VT cycle.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The usefulness of cellular electrophysiologic techniques in elucidating the fundamental actions of antiarrhythmic drugs is contrasted with their apparent lack of relevance to the selection of drugs for the treatment of particular arrhythmias. Clinical electrophysiologists employ different techniques, but their results may be explained in terms of cellular drug actions. The varying clinical effects of class IA, IB and IC agents are due to differences in the speed of their attachment to, and detachment from, sodium channels. The role of sympathetic activity in arrhythmogenesis is complex, but again readily explicable in terms of the electrophysiologic cellular actions of stimulation of the individual types of adrenoceptors (alpha 1, alpha 2, beta 1 and beta 2) and the distribution of these receptors, and of the longterm effects of sympathetic deprivation, either by antisympathetic drugs (class II) or by sympathetic denervation. Delayed repolarization (e.g., by class III drugs or prolonged beta blockade) is antiarrhythmic because it is homogeneous, despite the incidental prolongation of QT. If, however, QT is prolonged by heterogeneity of conduction or repolarization, or by partial sympathetic denervation (long QT syndrome or post myocardial infarction), this indicates increased risk of arrhythmia. Finally, the efficacy of calcium antagonists (class IV) in supraventricular arrhythmias is attributable to the cellular electrophysiologic characteristics of sinoatrial and atrioventricular nodal and transitional elements.\r"

  ".U": "90086550\r", 
  ".W": "Whereas much has been learned of the mechanisms and pathophysiology of cardiac arrhythmias, treatment remains controversial and is largely empiric. Cardiac arrhythmias range in severity from innocuous to fatal; antiarrhythmic agents offer differing degrees of efficacy, inefficacy or toxicity. For an arrhythmia that needs treatment, there is no reliable or easy method for selecting the most appropriate antiarrhythmic drug. Antiarrhythmic treatment is justified for arrhythmias that are symptomatic or hemodynamically significant, the risk of lethality dictating the degree of drug toxicity that might be tolerated. The treatment of prognostically important arrhythmias is indicated if their suppression is rewarded by an improved prognosis. However, these arrhythmias are often merely indicators of a bad prognosis rather than the cause of death. Assessment of the risk-benefit ratio of antiarrhythmic treatment principally depends on the perceived risk and symptomatology of the arrhythmia and the efficacy and toxicity of the antiarrhythmic drug. Beta-adrenoceptor blocking drugs offer optimal risk-benefits for the prevention of ventricular fibrillation (infarct survivors and long QT syndrome); disopyramide and the class IC agents offer acceptable risk-benefit ratios for the treatment of ventricular tachycardia, whereas no antiarrhythmic drug offers an acceptable risk-benefit for the suppression of asymptomatic \"cosmetic\" atrial or ventricular ectopic beats.\r"

In patients with symptomatic arrhythmias, treatment must be instituted and tested during rigorous supervision of the patient. Using both the noninvasive Holter monitoring/exercise test procedure and invasive electrophysiologic testing, a beneficial antiarrhythmic response after institution of antiarrhythmic agents indicates improved prognosis. However, a negative treatment response during programmed stimulation does not necessarily indicate bad prognosis. This is particularly true for testing during amiodarone treatment. For unselected patients, routine antiarrhythmic treatment cannot currently be recommended. Continuing studies will show whether screening for electrical instability of the myocardium, and institution of antiarrhythmic therapy thereafter, will improve overall survival. If patients tolerate beta-blocking treatment, this should probably be instituted because reductions in mortality have been found, particularly in high-risk patients.\r"

  ".W": "Chronic recurrent ventricular tachycardia (VT) can be terminated reproducibly by programmed endocardial right ventricular stimulation. However, antitachycardia pacing is associated with possible acceleration of VT, while frequent occurrence of VT and discomfort of the patient can limit treatment with an automatic implantable cardioverter/defibrillator (AICD; Cardiac Pacemakers Inc.). The combined use of antitachycardia pacing (Tachylog pacemaker; Siemens-Elema) and AICD was therefore evaluated in 6 of 35 patients (aged 50 to 70 years, mean 60.1 +/- 7.7) in whom AICD had been implanted because of VT, which could be terminated by temporary overdrive pacing. With the interactive mode of the Tachylog, termination of VT by the pacemaker as well as by the AICD was assessed after implantation. In the automatic mode, the Tachylog functioned as a bipolar ventricular inhibited (VVI) device with antitachycardia burst stimulation: 2 to 5 stimuli, interval 260 to 300 ms, 1 to 2 interventions. During follow-up of 32 +/- 17 months, the Tachylog terminated VT reliably 50 to 505 times per patient. When burst stimulation accelerated VT, termination was achieved by AICD discharge. Thus, drug-resistant VT can be terminated by antitachycardia pacing avoiding patient discomfort. In case of acceleration, VT can be controlled by the AICD. A universal pacemaker should combine antibradycardia and antitachycardia pacing with backup cardioversion/defibrillation mode.\r"

  ".U": "90086557\r", 
  ".W": "A reentrant mechanism is believed to be responsible for atrial flutter. The recent development of the entrainment criteria further supports this theory, and there is a general consensus that circus movement is the underlying abnormality that supports this arrhythmia. In most clinical studies, abnormal fragmented (or double spike) electrograms, suggesting the presence of areas of localized slowing of conduction or block, have been reported. They are almost always recorded in the lower and posterior portion of the right interatrial septum, but also frequently in the high lateral portion of the right atrium. The determination of their involvement in the reentry pathway is important for designing curative procedures such as surgery or ablation. The low atrial septal area surrounding the mouth of the coronary sinus was suspected as being the critical area of slow conduction in atrial flutter. Rapid pacing at that site can yield a surface electrocardiographic pattern similar to the clinically occurring arrhythmias. Additionally, the flutter circuit can be accelerated during atrial pacing at fixed and slightly faster rates than the intrinsic tachycardia rate--the so-called entrainment phenomenon. When entrainment criteria are fulfilled, tachycardia termination being by definition ruled out, any concomitant recorded local type II block identifies an area that must be outside the circuit. Such local block may be recorded either spontaneously or during entrainment and therefore helps in identifying atrial slow conduction areas that do not belong to the reentrant path. This approach was applied to identify the optimal ablation site in 8 patients with long-standing drug resistant atrial flutter. In 7 of 8 patients, we were able to identify a fragmented potential in the low posteroseptal area during sustained atrial flutter.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The fulguration procedure was originally introduced for the treatment of supraventricular arrhythmias by a pervenous interruption of His bundle conduction. This procedure has been extended to the treatment of almost any cardiac arrhythmia resistant to antiarrhythmic drug therapy. Recent results suggest that ablation could be selectively applied to the site of abnormal conduction. Overall results obtained at the Jean Rostand Hospital are reported for a series of 104 patients ranging in age from 14 to 83 years with atrial, junctional and ventricular tachycardias. The follow-up extends up to 65 months. Clinical efficacy, defined as a control of the arrhythmias by fulguration used alone or in association with drug therapy that was previously ineffective, lead to a success rate ranging from 80 to 85%. Mortality was less than 10% in the worst situation (chronic resistant ventricular tachycardia). Mortality was always related to inappropriate protocols. Therefore, fulguration, which was originally reserved to treat the most difficult cases, is now considered for non-life-threatening but incapacitating arrhythmias. Despite these results the technique is not simple. Fulguration should be performed by groups knowledgeable in electrophysiology and with expertise in high voltage electricity and biophysics.\r"

Additional use of cryocoagulation after surgical incision of the atrium, previously routinely performed, is at present only done occasionally for septal accessory pathways. Ventricular tachycardia (VT) was the next most frequent condition. The surgical procedures for ischemic and nonischemic VTs are completely different, although both are based on the principle of complete electrophysiologic mapping. For ischemic VT, surgery consists of resection of the left ventricular aneurysm and excision or cryocoagulation of the endocardium, or both. For nonischemic VT, either excision of the entire thickness of the myocardium (2.0 X 2.5 cm on average) at the earliest excitation site of the right ventricle and cryocoagulation of the area of delayed potential or only incision and cyrocoagulation of the left ventricle were performed to avoid reduction of the left ventricular cavity. Ectopic atrial tachycardia was cured by excision of the earliest excitation site without use of a heart-lung machine, when the focus was located in the atrial free wall. Other successful treatments were of reentrant atrial tachycardia by cryocoagulation, atrial flutter by cryocoagulation of impulse pathways at the coronary sinus and around the atrioventricular node, and a new surgery for atrial fibrillation and flutter, which retained sinus rhythm. Johnson's procedure was used for surgical ablation of atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia.\r"

The surgical rationales are based on the site of origin of the arrhythmic mechanism and the associated pathology that characterizes the \"arrhythmogenic substrate.\" The Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome is characterized by an accessory atrioventricular (AV) connection distinct from the AV node-His bundle system. It is associated with AV reentrant tachycardia or atrial fibrillation, or both, with fast ventricular responses through the accessory pathway. The current surgical management involves ablation of the accessory pathway using either an endocardial or an epicardial approach. Surgical ablation is associated with high efficiency and low morbidity. Epicardial dissection of the accessory pathway on the beating heart has helped to localize variant accessory pathways associated with Coumel's tachycardia or the Mahaim fiber. AV nodal reentrant tachycardia can be cured using direct AV nodal dissection (or perinodal cryoablation). Atrial flutter can be interrupted by cryoablation of the arrhythmogenic substrate located in the coronary sinus orifice region. The chronotropic atrial function, abolished by incessant or paroxysmal idiopathic atrial fibrillation, can be restored using the corridor operation (sinus node-AV node insulation). The success of surgical intervention in atrial tachycardias is uncertain, but it may be an option in selected patients with resistant atrial tachycardias.\r"

Greater weight, stature, body mass index (BMI), skinfold thickness, and lean body mass (LBM) are associated with higher hemoglobin, hematocrit, and total iron-binding capacity. LBM and body fat are weakly related to serum albumin concentrations in men and to serum total protein concentrations in women. Total cholesterol concentrations are directly associated with weight, body fat, and LBM and are more strongly associated with central than peripheral obesity. Constitutional factors may be important for clinical assessment and for interpretation of epidemiologic studies.\r"

Fewer kcalories were ingested at lunch after ingestion of the VHF cereal than after ingestion of the VLF cereal. The degree of colonic microbial fermentation of the various cereals was evaluated by breath-hydrogen analysis.

Measurements of physical activity indicated a reduction of spontaneous physical activity during slimming. Alternating low energy intake did not prevent 24EE from declining. The reduction in 24EE was determined by a decrease of body weight, dietary induced thermogenesis (in proportion to caloric restriction), and physical activity.

Half of the subjects had diet only (DO) and half underwent supervised exercise (DE) four times weekly. Five control subjects ate a balanced, moderately low-calorie diet (approximately 1400 kcal/d). Stress tests included maximal and submaximal (85%) exercise, psychological stress, and isometric handgrip tests, all with constant electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring. Twenty-four-hour Holter monitors at weeks 0 and 6 and weekly resting ECGs were obtained. DO and DE lost similar amounts of weight. There were no changes in QT intervals or in voltage or width of the QRS complex on resting ECG and no arrhythmias on Holter monitoring. These data support the safety of VLCDs containing greater than or equal to 650 kcal/d and adequate amounts of high-quality protein, vitamins, and minerals for use for periods of at least 6 wk in normal, healthy obese women.\r"

Contrary to intentions, qualitative improvements were minor and transient resulting in a lasting fractional increase of patients with inadequate intakes of a wide range of nutrients. Protein malnutrition could not be detected from measurements of serum-albumin, plasma-prealbumin, or plasma retinol-binding globulin. Calcium was not included in the vitamin-mineral supplement and serum-Ca decreased. Despite thorough instruction, close follow-up, and gastrosurgery, there were no major qualitative dietary improvements. The study showed that bad compliance with an intended qualitative improvement of diet adds to the risks of being on a severely energy-restricted GP diet and increases the necessity for broad long-term supplements.\r"

Fat content of the milk was slightly lower. Free fatty acids were 2% of total lipid on day 3 but increased to 23% on days 4-7, suggesting impaired esterification in the mammary gland. Total milk lipoprotein lipase increased approximately fourfold during days 4-5. Other changes were 1) low cholesterol content, only one-fifth of normal milk; 2) decreased medium-chain fatty acids, suggesting impairment of fatty acid synthesis in the mammary gland; 3) increased oleic acid; and 4) high concentrations of polyunsaturated fatty acids, suggesting increased chain elongation. These results suggest that diabetes produces changes in lipid metabolism in the mammary gland that alter the composition of milk produced by the diabetic mother.\r"

In long-chain triglyceride emulsions it is greater than in medium-chain triglyceride emulsions. As the particle diameter decreases, the total interfacial area increases, as does the lipoprotein lipase (LPL) and hepatic lipase (HL) activity. For a given quantity of triglycerides and phospholipids the lipolytic activity is proportional to the total interfacial area. A doubling of the phospholipid concentration is accompanied by a small reduction in the activity of both enzymes. In going from long-chain to medium-chain triglycerides, there is an acceleration in the clearance rate of infused lipid. For a similar emulsion, the clearance rate decreases as the particle size decreases. It seems plausible that the larger the mean droplet diameter, the greater the participation of the reticuloendothelial system in the clearance.\r"

However, because further metabolism of cysteine also occurs primarily in the liver, the metabolic clearance of this amino acid could be impaired in cirrhosis. We administered oral loads of L-cysteine to cirrhotic patients and healthy volunteers. Plasma cyst(e)ine (free and protein-bound cysteine, and 1/2 cystine) and urinary sulfur-containing constituents were measured at various times postload. Cirrhotic subjects exhibited a greater maximal plasma cyst(e)ine concentration and plasma elimination half-life (t1/2) and a delayed excretion of metabolic end products after an oral L-cysteine load. The postload increase in total plasma cyst(e)ine was accounted for primarily by an increase in the disulfide form (cystine). These studies show that cirrhotics have an impaired ability to clear cyst(e)ine from the plasma.\r"

Hepatic vein, femoral vein, and radial artery catheterizations were performed in 12 febrile patients with infections of varying severity. Differences in arteriovenous 3MH, analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography, were multiplied by the plasma flows, determined by a dye dilution technique. The mean splanchnic efflux was 0.062 +/- 0.180 mumol/min (mean +/- SD) with uptake occurring in five patients. The splanchnic uptake was significantly (p less than 0.001) correlated with the urinary 3MH excretion and the peripheral release from the leg. It is concluded that in human infection, splanchnic 3MH release is low and in patients with high rates of myofibrillar catabolism there may even be an uptake. The urinary 3MH excretion is still a marker of myofibrillar protein breakdown because it correlates well with the release from the leg, regardless of whether the patient has a splanchnic uptake or a release.\r"

In a population study (n = 92) E-GPT activity differed significantly (p less than 0.001) among the three phenotypic groups. Plasma pyridoxal-5'-phosphate concentrations in the three groups did not differ significantly. Therefore, E-GPT activity can only be used to assess vitamin B-6 nutritional status if GPT phenotype is accounted for. 2) Pyridoxine supplementation (10 mg/d) significantly (p less than 0.0001) increased E-GPT activity and decreased (p less than 0.0001) the percentage stimulation by pyridoxal-5'-phosphate in vitro although the absolute amount of in vitro stimulation by pyridoxal-5'-phosphate changed only marginally. 3) Inorganic phosphate inhibits in vitro activation of E-GPT by pyridoxal-5'-phosphate.\r"

In the ethanol-fed pigs peak blood alcohol concentrations averaged 28 mmol/L, serum alanine transaminase and aspartate transaminase activities were elevated, and liver histology showed a centrilobular distribution of succinate dehydrogenase. Tissue folate concentrations were comparable in both groups. The jejunal uptake of folic acid, measured by intestinal perfusion, was similar in both groups of animals and was not affected by acute exposure to 445 mmol/L ethanol. The in vivo hydrolysis of polyglutamyl folate was reduced by 35% in one ethanol-fed minipig. Decreased hydrolysis of polyglutamyl folate may represent an early step in the development of folate deficiency in chronic alcoholics.\r"

Thus, half-life (t1/2) and volume of distribution (Vd) of PEG in the gut could be computed for each of seven infants who received continuous daily PEG doses and t1/2 only for four infants who received a single PEG dose. t1/2 of PEG in the gut was 0.99 +/- 0.48 d (means +/- SD).

The effect of 6 months' medical treatment on BE patients was reevaluated by repeating manometry, endoscopy, and biopsy. Esophageal manometry was performed by perfusion technique and endoscopic biopsies were obtained. There were 180 patients; 20 (11%) were found to have BE. The vast majority of BE patients were caucasians. BE patients had symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux for a longer time than did NBE patients. Mean lower esophageal sphincter pressure in BE patients was lower than that in NBE patients. On medical treatment, the severity of esophagitis as judged by endoscopic criteria in BE patients was reduced, but there was no increase in lower esophageal sphincter pressure and no regression of the columnar epithelium.\r"

  ".W": "Simultaneous recordings of myoelectric and manometric activities of the esophagus were made in two groups of patients with scleroderma. Group A consisted of patients who suffered from functional dysphagia that had appeared recently, and who had a normal size esophagus when examined radiographically. Patients in group B had complained of functional dysphagia for several years and showed a dilated hypotonic esophagus on x-ray. A control group of five normal subjects was also examined in the same manner. The study was carried out by means of a peroral probe with two pairs of suction-needle electrodes and two manometric side-hole catheters positioned at the same levels as the electrodes. Standard manometric examination of the esophagus was carried out in all patients. Normal subjects after each deglutition showed a propagated burst of spikes in correspondence with the ascending phase of the peristaltic wave, whereas, in the period between deglutitions, rare spikes and no pressure waves were recorded. Group A patients were characterized by the frequent appearance during the interdeglutitive period of spontaneous rhythmic sequences or bursts of spikes associated with pressure waves. In these patients, repetitive nonpropagated spike bursts with a higher than normal amplitude and duration were observed after deglutitions in association with high-amplitude nonpropagated repetitive pressure waves similar to those observed in diffuse esophageal spasm (DES). Five of the seven group B patients showed spike bursts and pressure waves with both amplitude and duration markedly lower than normal. The remaining two patients from group B presented no spike bursts or pressure waves at all. Standard manometry demonstrated findings equivalent to those obtained via electromyography (EMG) in all patients of group B and in only two patients of group A. In conclusion, the functional dysphagia of patients with scleroderma can be attributed to two different motor disorders. The first one is characterized by disorganized myoelectric hyperactivity and may have a manometric appearance similar to that of diffuse spasm. The second one is characterized by a marked decrease in myoelectric activity and corresponds to the classic manometric finding of scleroderma involvement of the esophagus. Both these myoelectric patterns seem to be related to subsequent stages of esophageal scleroderma involvement.\r"

  ".W": "Gastroesophageal reflux (GER) has been implicated in otolaryngologic problems, particularly chronic hoarseness that cannot be attributed to other causes. To study this relationship, we used 24-h ambulatory intraesophageal or dual pharyngoesophageal pH monitoring in 33 patients with chronic hoarseness and laryngeal lesions suggestive of acid irritation. Twenty-six of the patients (78.8%) had pH evidence of severe GER, being at least three times greater than the upper limit of normal. In contrast to 19 patients with proven esophagitis, this GER was worse in the upright position. Of 15 patients with both pharyngeal and esophageal probes, three had esophagopharyngeal reflux, and two had atypical unexplained pharyngeal decreases in pH to below 4.0. Less than half of the 33 patients had the typical symptoms of GER, and standard esophageal tests usually yielded normal findings. Occult GER, predominantly in the upright position, appears to be common and severe in patients with chronic hoarseness, who have laryngeal lesions suggestive of GER. The causative mechanisms are not clear. The 24-h esophageal pH monitor is useful in screening this potentially treatable problem.\r"

  ".W": "The effect of treatment of Campylobacter pylori-associated gastritis on acid secretion was studied to examine further the strong association between C. pylori and peptic diseases. Twelve symptomatic patients with non-ulcer dyspepsia and C. pylori-associated histologic gastritis had basal and pentagastrin-stimulated gastric acid analysis before and after a 14-day course of amoxicillin 250 mg qid and bismuth subsalicylate 524 mg qid. Endoscopy, antral biopsies, and symptom questionnaires were obtained at entry and at the conclusion of the study. C. pylori was identified by Warthin-Starry stain. Biopsy specimens were also graded for the severity of chronic inflammation and the presence of neutrophils in the epithelium. The treatment regimen cleared C. pylori in 10 of 12 patients. Dyspeptic symptoms improved in 10 of 12 patients, two of whom did not clear the organism, and were unchanged in the remaining two patients, both of whom cleared the bacteria. Neutrophil infiltration in the antral biopsies resolved in 10 patients, including nine with C. pylori clearance and one with persistence of the organism. The severity of the underlying chronic inflammation improved in only one of the 10 organism-free patients and one of the two persistently infected individuals. Pretreatment gastric acid analysis demonstrated hypochlorhydria in three of 12 patients, mild hyperchlorhydria in three of 12 patients, mild hyperchlorhydria in two of 12, and normal acid secretion in the remaining seven patients. Posttreatment acid studies revealed that four of 12 patients were hypochlorhydric, one of 12 had hyperchlorhydria, and seven of 12 were normochlorhydric. After treatment, there was no significant change in basal or maximal acid secretion in the 10 patients who cleared the organism. The two patients who failed to clear C. pylori had insignificant increases in acid secretion after treatment. Our data show no consistent pretreatment pattern of acid secretion in patients with C. pylori-associated gastritis. In addition, gastric acid output did not show a consistent change after treatment for C. pylori. This suggests that the association between C. pylori infection and peptic diseases does not occur via altered acid secretion.\r"

  ".W": "This paper will describe a case series of 35 AIDS patients with infection of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract with Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare (MAIC). Thirty-five homosexual men with a mean age of 35 yr and a mean duration of AIDS of 7.7 months prior to the diagnosis of MAIC were investigated to determine the extent of MAIC infection. The investigations included upper endoscopy, sigmoidoscopy, liver biopsy, bone marrow aspiration and biopsy, stool and blood cultures for MAIC, and D-xylose absorption tests. Tissue biopsy material was examined by light microscopy with the Ziehl-Neelsen stain. The duodenum was most commonly involved (30/34 men), with 65% positive on special stains and 76% positive on culture of biopsy tissue. Unusual fine white nodules, believed to be characteristic for duodenal MAIC infection, were observed in 12 men. Esophageal (two men), liver (two men), and rectal involvement (seven men) were found. In nine of 18 men (50%), the D-xylose test was abnormal. In 28 of 33 men (85%), blood cultures grew MAIC. Similarly, in 25 of 28 men (89%), bone marrow biopsies grew MAIC, and in 18 of 21 men (86%) stool samples grew MAIC. We conclude that GI tract infection with MAIC in AIDS patients is frequently associated with systemic infection with the agent. Duodenal involvement is common, and may be accompanied by a characteristic gross lesion, that of fine white nodules on the mucosa. Malabsorption, as determined by the D-xylose test, is not a universal finding, as has been reported previously.\r"

Among the patients, 93.2% were black and 32 were males, with a mean age of 36.7 yr. Intravenous drug abuse was a risk factor for AIDS in 81.8% of patients. Liver biopsies were particularly useful in patients with fever of unclear origin, which was positively correlated with the presence of granulomas (p = 0.01). Granulomas due to mycobacteria were present in 16 (33.3%) of the biopsies. Liver biopsy proved to be clinically significant in 14 of 17 patients (82.3%) with mycobacterial disease, or 29.3% of the liver biopsies. Chronic active hepatitis was present in 12 (29.2%) of the biopsies, and in all but one was due to non-A non-B hepatitis viruses. All patients with chronic active hepatitis were intravenous drug abusers or the sexual partners of intravenous drug abusers. Liver biopsy can provide important diagnostic information in AIDS patients. The pathological findings in this series reflect the high risk of exposure to tuberculosis and hepatitis in the intravenous drug abusers in Harlem.\r"

  ".W": "The present study was undertaken to examine early T lymphocyte activation in chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) carriers. Nineteen hepatitis B surface antigen-positive patients (eight with liver cirrhosis and 11 with chronic hepatitis) and 18 healthy controls were studied in a period free of other infection. Mitogen-stimulated cellular interleukin 2 receptor expression, soluble interleukin 2 receptor release, and interleukin 2 production were studied in peripheral blood mononuclear cells cultured for 24 h. No difference was demonstrated between the patients and healthy controls in the cellular interleukin 2 receptor expression, soluble interleukin 2 receptor release, and interleukin 2 production. Pokeweed mitogen-stimulated interleukin 2 production in lymphocytes from cirrhotic patients was significantly lower than that of the noncirrhotic patients. However, the cellular and soluble interleukin 2 receptor levels did not differ between the two groups of chronic HBV carriers. Despite the fact that it has been suggested that autoreactive T cells have a role in mediating the development of chronic liver diseases associated with HBV infection, this study fails to demonstrate a defective T lymphocyte activation in these patients. The observed reduction of interleukin 2 production from activated lymphocytes may be related to the severity of liver impairment, rather than the HBV infection itself.\r"

  ".W": "To assess the significance of intrahepatic expression of pre-S1 and S2 proteins of hepatitis B virus (HBV) in patients with HBV infection, an indirect immunoperoxidase technique employed monoclonal antibodies to pre-S proteins was used to detect pre-S1 and -S2 proteins in 80 liver specimens. The frequency of pre-S1 and -S2 proteins was 61.3% and 51.3%, respectively, and the co-expression of pre-S and HBsAg occurred in most specimens. The preferential expression of pre-S1 and -S2 in HBcAg-positive specimens suggests that pre-S proteins are associated with HBV replication. Membranous expression of both pre-S1 and -S2 is associated with inflammatory activity and liver cell necrosis. Furthermore, our results show that T cells, not NK or B cells, were the predominantly infiltrating cells in necrotic foci with pre-S expression. Almost all of these T cells may express HLA-DR antigen simultaneously; therefore, they are activated. In conjunction with these data, we conclude that, as the essential components of HBV envelope proteins, pre-S proteins may play an important role in resulting in liver cell necrosis.\r"

Indeed, 20 patients (36%) with moderate to heavy infections had no gastrointestinal symptoms, and three symptomatic patients did not show clinical improvement after elimination of the parasite. Reexamination of stool samples revealed that eight untreated patients had spontaneous disappearance of B. hominis. We conclude that B. hominis probably is not responsible for clinical symptoms when detected, and additional investigations should be pursued for other etiologies of the patient's symptoms.\r"

  ".W": "Treatment of idiopathic membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis remains an unsettled issue. The results of five randomized clinical trials have not provided convincing evidence for the effectiveness of any treatment. Follow-up periods in these trials were relatively short-term, ranging from 1 to 4 years. In three recently published long-term clinical studies of patients with membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis, 10-year cumulative survival free of renal failure improved by 20% to 35% over that described in studies published 5 to 10 years earlier. In each study, survival was estimated using life-table analysis. The survival curve in the treated group was then compared with that of a historical control group using the date of clinical onset as time zero. The survival curve in the treatment group was spuriously shifted to the right. By definition, those in the treatment groups had to survive from clinical onset to initiation of treatment, but the historical control group did not have such a constraint. The problem in this comparison is that treatments were not started in a large number of patients for years after clinical onset, resulting in a biased comparison in favor of the treatment groups. (Also, the conclusions drawn from the survival data were that the improvement related directly to various treatments that were used.) Survival was similarly improved in patients treated with dipyridamole and aspirin when survival was plotted against time after clinical onset. However, when the data were replotted and the platelet-inhibitor-treated group was compared with a contemporary randomized control group, no difference in either patient survival or survival free of renal disease was demonstrated.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "These studies were designed to investigate the functional and morphologic glomerular effects of pregnancy in a model of experimentally induced glomerulonephritis (GN) in the Munich-Wistar rat. Virgin and midterm (day 12) pregnant rats were studied during the autologous phase of anti-glomerular basement membrane antibody GN and were compared with normal control virgin and pregnant rats. In this model of moderately intense GN, glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and single-nephron GFR were not different from normal controls; however, glomerular micropuncture revealed that glomerular capillary blood pressure was elevated and the glomerular capillary ultrafiltration coefficient, Kfi, was reduced in rats with GN compared with normal rats. In addition a substantial proteinuria was present, and there was morphologic evidence of a moderate and fairly uniform GN. The superimposition of pregnancy to midterm (11 to 13 days) had no effects on the proteinuria or glomerular morphology in rats with GN. Also, pregnancy did not further alter the increased glomerular blood pressure or reduced Kf that occur in this model of GN. Despite the presence of an underlying glomerular disease, the maternal kidney was able to increase renal plasma flow. When underlying mild GN is present, 11 to 13 days of pregnancy does not appear to worsen the disease in the short term. Other studies are needed to determine the long-term renal effects of repeated pregnancy when underlying GN is present.\r"

These observations suggest that PAN membranes may have a large propensity to adsorb native complement proteins; as a consequence, complement depletion can occur without activation. In the present study, we observed that incubation of human serum in the presence of PAN membrane resulted in a 50% loss of serum hemolytic activity of C3. When radiolabeled purified components were offered, PAN membranes were found to adsorb C3 and C5 in a dose-dependent manner. Adsorption of these proteins by PAN was more than 20 times greater than adsorption by cuprophan, cellulose acetate or Hemophan (Akzo, formerly Enka, Wuppertal, FRG) at all concentrations examined. These results suggest that depletion of complement when serum is exposed to hemodialysis membranes may result from adsorption of complement components onto the membrane surfaces and does not necessarily indicate complement activation.\r"

After r-HuEPO treatment, subjects had significantly higher hematocrits, markedly improved energy levels, and marginally improved global health. r-HuEPO treatment was also associated with progressively decreased levels of subject mood disturbance and dialysis-related stresses. Subjects had no increased participation in paid employment and only minimally increased participation in social and leisure activities at posttreatment data points. There was no significant improvement in cognitive function after treatment. r-HuEPO treatment appears to be associated with higher energy levels, significant psychological benefits, and minimal improvements in social adaptation. The effects on cognitive function merit further study.\r"

The drug was initially given intravenously three times a week for 1 to 5 months, then by subcutaneous injections three times each week for 4 to 8 months, and finally by subcutaneous injection once weekly for 3 to 18 months. The duration of follow-up ranged from 11 to 29 months. Anemia was ameliorated in all participants. Mean hematocrit increased from a basal value of 26.8% to 35.1% during the intravenous phase and to 36.7% and 34.6% during the two subcutaneous periods. Mean weekly doses of erythropoietin (EPO) were 276 units/kg during intravenous therapy and 134 and 108 units/kg in the two subcutaneous periods. The differences in the doses were significant only between the intravenous and the two subcutaneous periods. Mean erythrocyte mass increased from a baseline value of 13.6 mL/kg to 20.4 mL/kg 8 months after initiation of treatment. Mean erythrocyte survival half-time was increased from 23 days before to 26 days, 8 months after r-HuEPO treatment, P less than 0.002. Mean blood pressure (mm Hg) was 105 before and 95 after treatment. Mean serum creatinine was 513 mumol/L (5.8 mg/dL) at the beginning of the study. At the time of this writing (11 to 29 months after treatment), seven patients have required dialysis treatment. There were three episodes of transient refractoriness to r-HuEPO documented during periods of infection and surgical procedures. All subjects tolerated the medication well, and no serious side effects attributable to the medication were noted. Furthermore, circulating antibodies against r-HuEPO were consistently negative.\r"

  ".W": "It might be expected that the tremendous increase in available antihypertensives would eliminate resistant hypertension by allowing many alternatives to its treatment. In spite of this, resistant hypertension remains a common problem due, the authors feel, to a poor understanding of the pathophysiology of this condition, particularly an understanding of whether plasma volume expansion mediates resistance to antihypertensive therapy. The authors evaluated the status of plasma volume as a major determinant of response to therapy in nine patients with resistant hypertension. Measuring plasma volume using I125 radiolabeled albumin, they found eight patients with elevated plasma volumes and one patient with a contracted plasma volume at the time of presentation with resistant hypertension. In all eight patients with plasma volume expansion, aggressive diuretic therapy allowed goal blood pressure to be achieved. The patient with plasma volume contraction achieved goal blood pressure with vasodilator therapy. Plasma volume expansion is common in resistant hypertension and it mediates resistance to therapy. Measurement of plasma volume gives the clinician important insight into the pathophysiology of resistant hypertension and increases the likelihood of successful management of the resistant hypertensive patient.\r"

Previous studies indicated that fibroblasts cultured from patients Atl and Ark-1 had less than 10% of normal insulin binding. Cells cultured from the related parents of Atl had partial reduction in insulin binding, suggesting that patient Atl inherited the same mutant allele for the insulin receptor from both his parents. By contrast, the parents of Ark-1 were unrelated and their cells had different degrees of impaired insulin binding, suggesting that patient Ark-1 inherited two different, non-complementing alleles for the insulin receptor. To test these hypotheses, RFLPs were defined for the insulin receptor gene and their transmission was studied in families Atl and Ark-1. Patients affected with leprechaunism had no private polymorphisms in the insulin receptor gene, indicating that gross rearrangements were not present. A polymorphism generated with EcoRI at the 5' end of the insulin receptor gene gave fragments of 16 and 20 kb and was the only one informative in family Atl. Both parents were heterozygous, presenting a 16 and a 20 kb fragment, and transmitted the 20 kb allele to their affected offspring. Ark-1's parents were heterozygous for three different RFLPs, including this EcoRI polymorphism, and patient Ark-1 inherited a different allele for the insulin receptor from each parent. These results support the genetic hypotheses suggested by insulin-binding studies and indicate that RFLPs can be used to identify transmission of the insulin receptor gene in families with insulin resistance.\r"

This study was done to determine the relative effects of HA and DBM implanted as moldable phospholipid composites in bone defects that result in non-unions. We studied 22 ten-month-old Long-Evans male rats with 5.0 mm unilateral radial defects implanted with HA, DBM, and a combination of both substances. Control defects were left unfilled. Eight weeks after implantation, the histological sections demonstrated a decrease in bone formation with HA relative to controls. The HA crystals were encapsulated by connective tissue stroma made up of collagenous elements, fibroblasts, and blood vessels. There were no indications of bone formation within the fibrous stroma. 45Calcium, alkaline phosphatase, and bone gla protein (BGP) assays demonstrated a 16% increase in bone formation in rats implanted with DBM, an 80% decrease in groups implanted with HA (p = 0.01) and an 80% decrease with DBM plus HA (p = 0.01). Radiologic analysis corresponds well with histological and biochemical results. We conclude that osteogenesis in non-union defects is enhanced by the implantation of DBM, while HA interferes with bone formation in the rat model. In the presence of both substances, HA appears to impede new bone growth, negating any positive effects seen with DBM.\r"

Studies were performed in rats using a hypertonic (1200 mOsm/L) dialysate solution containing 5.6% glucose, 2.8% amino acid, and electrolytes. Both intact and eviscerated rats were studied. The experiments were repeated in animals whose diaphragms were fibrotic and densely adherent to liver. Preparation of the diaphragm did not impact upon ultrafiltration. Ultrafiltration in controls (54 vs. 56 ml with and without a fibrotic diaphragm respectively) and in eviscerated groups (44 vs. 45 ml with and without a fibrotic diaphragm respectively) were not significantly different. However, controls had significantly more ultrafiltration than did eviscerated animals (p less than 0.01). The parietal viscera accounted for 56-59% of the ultrafiltration. This study demonstrates that both the intestinal viscera and parietal walls participate in ultrafiltration.\r"

  ".W": "We studied the ocular characteristics of 40 pairs of normal-tension and high-tension glaucoma patients who matched closely for the extent of field damage, pupil size, and visual acuity. To determine if there were differences in visual field damage between patients with normal-tension and high-tension glaucoma, we studied characteristics of the areas of the patients' visual fields that were undisturbed. We computed the number of normal locations, the number of clustered normal locations, and the size of the largest cluster of normal locations. The results showed that for an equivalent extent of damage, the individuals in the normal-tension group had greater areas with normal sensitivity, hence more localized damage. A comparison of the patient data to control data showed that paired differences were larger when the normal-tension member of a pair had a larger value in any of the parameters. The results support the hypothesis that glaucoma patients with lower intraocular pressures have more localized damage and those with higher intraocular pressures have more diffuse damage.\r"

Threshold measurements were performed on Humphrey and Octopus perimeters at 0, 5, 10, 15, 20, and 25 degrees nasally along the 180-degree meridian. A 0.6-log unit neutral density filter, which reduces retinal illumination the equivalent of halving the pupillary diameter, decreased the mean Humphrey thresholds by 1.1 +/- 0.8 decibels (dB) (mean +/- standard deviation) and the mean Octopus thresholds by 1.7 +/- 1.4 dB. Statistically significant (P less than or equal to .05, Dunnett's test) threshold depressions were observed at all eccentricities with a 1.5-log unit neutral density filter on the Humphrey perimeter (-4.5 +/- 0.7 dB) and with a 1.0-log unit neutral density filter on the Octopus perimeter (-3.5 +/- 1.0 dB).\r"

A syndrome resembling pars planitis with atypical features such as granulomatous keratic precipitates and posterior synechiae should prompt a search for Lyme borreliosis. Topical corticosteroid therapy is necessary to prevent complications of anterior segment inflammation caused by Lyme uveitis, but the benefit of systemic and periocular corticosteroids is uncertain. Oral antibiotics may be effective in treating early stages of ocular Lyme borreliosis. In later stages, intravenous antibiotic therapy is indicated.\r"

We studied the adherence of Acanthamoeba to unworn extended-wear soft contact lenses on a human corneal isolate of Acanthamoeba castellanii suspended in normal saline (cysts, 6.3 x 10(5)/ml; trophozoites, 3.6 x 10(5)/ml). Unworn hydrogel contact lenses (polymacon, water content 38.6%; 50 lenses, 400 lens segments) were exposed to A. castellanii cysts or trophozoites with or without stirring. After exposure for zero to seven hours, soft contact lenses were or were not washed, and the A. castellanii adherence was determined with a standardized light-microscopy technique (40 fields, ten lens segments for each count) and with scanning electron microscopy. Both cysts and trophozoites adhered to the unworn soft contact lenses. Trophozoites showed acanthopodia, lobopodia, and filopodia. This study indicates that both A. castellanii cysts and trophozoites can firmly adhere to unworn soft contact lens. Such adherence may play a role in the pathogenesis of soft contact lens-related Acanthamoeba keratitis.\r"

Six of the nine patients had atherosclerotic disease or hypertension, six of nine patients had glaucoma, and eight of nine patients had undergone previous intraocular surgery. Surgery was performed under general anesthesia in 714 patients, and four of these patients (0.56%) suffered hemorrhages. Five of 116 (4.3%) local anesthesia patients experienced expulsive choroidal hemorrhage. The increased resistance to venous outflow associated with retrobulbar anesthetic injection may significantly contribute to the risk of massive suprachoroidal hemorrhage.\r"

We found the Binkhorst and the Holladay intraocular lens calculation formulas to be more accurate than the SRK II for these patients. Corneal curvature measured with the keratometer was less accurate for intraocular lens calculations than was a value derived by subtracting the refractive change induced by the radial keratotomy from the patients' keratometric measurements obtained before radial keratotomy.\r"

The cumulative risk of loss of visual acuity was 37% in one year, 59% in two years, and 80% in three years. Visual loss occurred in 29 of the 36 eyes as a result of a complication of retinal pigment epithelial detachment. The magnitude of risk to the fellow eye was greater than has been documented in unselected age-related macular degeneration.\r"

Patients with peripheral retinitis and other areas of retinitis were excluded. All patients were treated with ganciclovir. Two distinct types of cytomegalovirus infection of the peripapillary area were identified. Type I was characterized by spread of limited retinitis to the optic disk margin, good central visual acuity, and permanent arcuate and altitudinal visual field defects that enlarged and became more complete as the retinitis progressed toward the disk. Type II appeared to be a true cytomegalovirus infection of the optic nerve characterized by primary, isolated papillitis with peripapillary retinitis, an early afferent pupillary defect, and good initial visual acuity, which rapidly deteriorated despite prompt antiviral therapy. Peripapillary cytomegalovirus retinitis appears to be an important and underreported cause of visual morbidity in patients with AIDS.\r"

Conjunctivitis was the most frequently reported reaction. Periorbital edema was reported in two patients, and lacrimation was reported in a published study. Blepharospasm, keratitis, and decreased visual acuity were reported once each in patients treated with combination chemotherapeutic regimens containing doxorubicin. These reactions usually resolved rapidly on discontinuation of the drug. Conjunctivitis frequently followed accidental ocular exposure to doxorubicin. All but a few of these reactions cleared within 24 hours of exposure. The infrequent nature and usually rapid resolution of these ocular adverse reactions suggest that when ocular toxicities occur in patients undergoing doxorubicin-containing chemotherapy, the cautious reintroduction of doxorubicin, if further antineoplastic therapy is indicated, should be considered.\r"

  ".U": "90086987\r", 
  ".W": "It was previously shown by the authors that the binding of human low-density lipoprotein (LDL) to the surface of schistosomula inhibits the binding of human anti-schistosomal antibodies and is inhibited by suramin. Here, three questions were considered. 1) Are LDLs bound to schistosomula displaced from the membrane by polyanions? 2) Does bound LDL mask or hide antigens recognized by human anti-schistosomal antibodies? 3) Is LDL, binding capability present when the larvae enter the blood stream? The first question was tested by measuring the percentage of the schistosomular surface membrane covered by LDL after exposure to LDL with or without dextran sulfate or suramin. The bound LDL was visualized with polyclonal goat anti-human apolipoprotein B (anti-apo B) antibodies and peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies. After overnight culture in 20 micrograms/300 microliters LDL, 84.0% +/- 0.3% of the parasite surface was covered by LDL reaction product. When the polyanions suramin or dextran sulfate were added to the cultures for 30 minutes, only 59.7% +/- 4.9% of the surface was covered by reaction product, demonstrating that the LDL was partially displaced from the membrane by these compounds. The second question was tested by measuring the binding of human and mouse monoclonal anti-schistosomal antibodies before and after exposure to LDL, with or without partial removal of the bound LDL by suramin. LDL partially inhibited antibody binding in a reversible fashion. The LDL clearly masked parasite antigens, most probably by steric hindrance. However, there may be competitive inhibition of antibody binding by the LDL as well, because human anti-schistosomal antibodies inhibited LDL binding to worms and both human anti-schistosomal antibody and LDL binding to schistosomula were inhibited by suramin. Finally, the third question was tested by quantitative immunofluorescence. The LDL binding capability persisted and nearly doubled by 72 hours after transformation from cercariae. These experiments demonstrated that LDL bound to the surface of schistosomula through the time they enter the blood stream. LDL bound to the parasite surface may help the parasite to evade antibody-dependent cytotoxic reactions by masking parasite antigens.\r"

The purpose is to develop evaluative criteria for diagnosis of viral presence in clinical tissue specimens. In this work simultaneous denaturation of probe and target DNA and an alkaline phosphatase conjugate to detect biotinated probe were used as described by Unger et al. For evaluation of the hybridization, a variety of cell lines, both productively and latently infected, that were hybridized in situ using nick translated 32P-labeled viral probe sequences and counted by scintillation after the method of Lawrence and Singer were used. Producer cells (B95-8) showed intense foci of staining in approximately 5% of cells, with most of the other cells showing varying staining intensity. Raji cells showed varying amounts of signal from cell to cell. Namalwa cells exhibited one spot in most cells that was decreased after cells were treated with Actinomycin D (dactinomycin, Merck Sharp & Dohme, West Point, PA). Signal was identified in only a third of these same cells after sectioning. EB virus-negative Ramos cells showed no signal. The nuclear punctate nature of the signal generated is diagnostic of infected cells, and may be a useful test for cultured cells or pathologic specimens.\r"

  ".U": "90086990\r", 
  ".W": "The ability of small molecules such as urushiol, present as a wax on the poison ivy leaf surface, to cause allergic contact dermatitis (rhus dermatitis) has fascinated immunologists for decades. Current dogma suggests that these epicutaneously applied catechol-containing molecules serve as haptens to conjugate with larger proteins via reactive o-quinone intermediates. These complexes are then recognized as foreign antigens by the immune system and elicit a hypersensitivity reaction. Phorbol ester can directly induce cultured keratinocyte (KC) intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) expression via a protein kinase C (PK-C)-dependent mechanism. As urushiol is also a known PK-C agonist, we asked if topical application of a poison ivy/oak mixture could directly induce epidermal KC ICAM-1 expression. During the pre-erythematous phase of this reaction (4 to 20 hours), epidermal KCs expressed ICAM-1; this \"initiation phase\" preceded the appearance of activated memory T lymphocytes in the papillary dermis, and thus appeared to be nonlymphokine mediated. A near-contiguous cellular-adhesion molecular network was identified by ICAM-1 staining of basal KCs, dermal dendrocytes, and endothelial cells. During the second 24-hour period with the onset of erythema and edema, there was an \"amplification phase\" of more intense KC ICAM-1 expression coupled with relatively weak KC HLA-DR expression that coincided with dermal and epidermal T-cell infiltration. This suggests the presence of lymphokines, such as gamma interferon, during the amplification phase because of KC HLA-DR expression. On cultured KCs, urushiol directly induced ICAM-1 expression but not HLA-DR. Thus, in addition to functioning as an antigenic hapten, urushiol directly induces KC ICAM-1 expression. The KC ICAM-1 expression may then alter the dynamic trafficking of memory T cells in the epidermis, so as to initiate cutaneous inflammation in a nonantigen specific manner. This initiation phase is followed by T-cell infiltration and consequent lymphokine production that significantly amplifies the original stimulus. Thus much can still be learned about the molecular pathophysiology of this common type of cutaneous inflammation.\r"

  ".U": "90086991\r", 
  ".W": "Transin is a neutral metalloproteinase whose mRNA was first isolated from rat fibroblasts that had undergone malignant transformation. The protein is highly expressed in malignant rather than benign animal tumors. Its human analog is stromelysin, a 51-kd metalloproteinase initially isolated from cultured human synoviocytes. Northern blot analysis demonstrated that rheumatoid arthritis synovial tissue contained significantly higher levels of stromelysin mRNA than did osteoarthritis synovial tissue. Cultured synoviocytes were also shown to express stromelysin mRNA, and an affinity-purified anti-peptide antiserum to stromelysin specifically immunoprecipitated the stromelysin protein from the conditioned medium of cultured explant rheumatoid synoviocytes. Immunohistochemical staining of rheumatoid synovium demonstrated specific cytoplasmic staining of cells of the synovial lining layer, stromal fibroblasts, and endothelial cells. Osteoarthritic synovia showed significantly less stromelysin staining. Similarly, rheumatoid synovia demonstrated marked nuclear staining for the proliferation- and transformation-associated Myc oncoprotein. In contrast, osteoarthritic synovia showed negligible staining. These results support the belief that the proliferative, invasive behavior of rheumatoid synoviocytes reflects the expression of biochemical features generally associated with phenotypically transformed, malignant tumors. Clearly not a malignancy, the rheumatoid synovium appears to be paracrine driven by mediators generated in local inflammatory milieu.\r"

In vessels from normotensive control animals, low levels of hybridizable tropoelastin mRNA were detected in smooth muscle cells (SMC) of the inner media associated with large elastic lamellae. Compared to control arteries, vessels from hypertensive animals demonstrated a markedly different pattern of hybridization. In these arteries, strong hybridization signals for tropoelastin mRNA were seen in SMC lying between the elastic lamellae of the outer media, and the density of labeling associated with these medial cells decreased progressively toward the lumen. Endothelial and adventitial cells in both control and hypertensive arteries were negative for tropoelastin mRNA. Type I procollagen mRNA was dispersed through the media of control arteries, and in hypertensive calves, the hybridization signal was more intense and was unevenly distributed through the media similarly to that for tropoelastin mRNA. Adventitial cells were strongly positive for procollagen mRNA, and the signal was equally intense for both control and hypertensive arteries. Cells that had no detectable tropoelastin mRNA were noted in the outer media of both control and hypertensive vessels. These cells occurred as broad circumferential bands in the normotensive artery and as nodular foci in the hypertensive artery. Immunocytochemical studies with antibodies to smooth muscle specific actin, desmin, and vimentin demonstrated that cells within these foci, as well as tropoelastin mRNA-positive cells, were SMC. These studies demonstrate that expression of tropoelastin and procollagen mRNA was differentially stimulated by pulmonary hypertension within specific regions and SMC populations of the vascular wall.\r"

Biopsies taken from 14 allogeneic HLA-identical bone marrow transplant recipients who never developed GVHD were used as controls. Sections were evaluated for evidence of immunologic vascular injury using the rank file analysis of histologic features, expression of HLA-DR antigen, and the distribution of fibrin and factor VIII-related antigen (F VIII RAg). Patients with acute GVHD had significantly greater intimal lymphocytic infiltrates, perivascular nuclear dust deposition, perivascular F VIII Rag extravasation and deposition and vascular proliferation than controls. We find significantly greater endothelial injury in GVHD patients, which may represent primary immunologic injury to the vasculature. The clinical findings in acute GVHD probably result from cumulative endothelial as well as epithelial injury.\r"

The animals were sacrificed 6 to 8.5 months after the first injection and lung tissues were processed for light microscopy. Using serotonin (5-HT) as a marker for the endocrine cells, tissue sections were stained immunohistochemically by the avidin-biotin complex method. In both control and DEN-treated animals, serotonin-immunoreactive cells organized into neuroepithelial bodies (NEBs). There was an apparent increase in the size, number, and stainability of NEB in DEN-injected animals. A majority of these NEBs were localized in the alveolar duct region. Small foci of adenomatosis and well-differentiated adenocarcinomas, which sometimes coexisted with hyperplastic pulmonary endocrine cells, were also found in the DEN-treated rabbits.\r"

In another patient with long-term ADA enzyme replacement, a terminal autoimmune hemolytic anemia developed. Autopsy revealed severe deposits of iron in the B cell zones of the lymph nodes, which is an unusual location. In addition, iron deposits outlined the splenic trabeculae, as well as the ring fibers and bridging fibers of the splenic sinuses.\r"

Quantitative morphometry of electron micrographs of capillary endothelial cells demonstrated a 5.2-fold increase in these vesicles. This increase in vesicular transport was associated with a decrease in mitochondrial content from 13.7% of the endothelial cytoplasmic area in the normal rat to 4.2% in EAE rats at the height of clinical disease. These alterations correlated with the clinical course of EAE. In animals infused with tracer after fixation, tracer was restricted to areas of cellular inflammation. Immunogold staining of endogenous albumin demonstrated the presence of albumin in cytoplasmic vesicles and in channel-like tubular structures adjacent to endothelial cell junctions. These results indicate that there is a role for vesicles in transendothelial cell transport and edema formation in animals with EAE.\r"

By detailed banding analysis and identification of several identical chromosomal marker types in the two cell lines, it was proven that they originally derived from the same single cell or single clone. Because the first cell line, with mainly fibroblast-like cells, was in the hypotriploid region and the second, with mainly histiocyte-like cells, was in the penta-hexaploid region, the data explained the appearance of histiocyte-like cells in MFH as a consequence of chromosomal progression.\r"

  ".W": "Fodrin (nonerythroid spectrin) is a 475,000 molecular weight (MW) (apparent) heterodimeric actin-binding protein usually found in mature cells at the cytoplasmic face of the plasma membrane. While its precise role is uncertain, it may participate in the establishment and/or maintenance of cell polarity, shape, and specialized receptor domains. In polarized epithelial cells, an asymmetric distribution of fodrin appears to signal phenotypic maturity. Using immunohistochemical techniques, the distribution of fodrin in enterocytes during normal crypt-to-villus maturation, and in adenomas, adenocarcinomas, and cultured Madin-Darby Canine Kidney (MDCK) cells has been studied and its abundance quantitated by immunoblotting and digital immunofluorescent confocal microscopy. During normal maturation, fodrin was found to assemble at the apex of the enterocyte, presumably in the terminal web, only in those cells near the villus tip. Villin was found in an apical location in both crypt and surface enterocytes. In adenocarcinomas of the colon (n = 11), there were enhanced levels of fodrin at the apex, and an approximately threefold increase in the total amount of fodrin per cell relative to normal crypt enterocytes. An increased percentage of this protein was also found in the cytoplasm. Adenomas (n = 7), nonconfluent MDCK cells in culture, and two (of two) cases of ductal carcinoma of the breast also demonstrated enhanced cytoplasmic and total fodrin. Supranormal levels of fodrin at the apex of enterocytes were also observed in Crohn's disease samples and in the normal-appearing enterocytes adjacent to a tumor. It is hypothesized that increased apical fodrin may signal a reaction of the microvillar brush border to pathologic stress, while increased cytoplasmic and total pools of fodrin may mark neoplastic activity. These findings may be of diagnostic value, particularly in the evaluation of small biopsies or cytologic material.\r"

Endothelial cells in 32 of more than 100 attempted cultures were pure enough for evaluation. Emerged endothelial cells in primary culture were classified into two types: typical endothelium and variant endothelium. Typical endothelial cells were small, round to polygonal shaped, and were arranged uniformly. Their diameter ranged from 50 to 70 microns. Variant endothelial cells were larger, ranging from 100 to 200 microns in diameter, and giant endothelial cells measuring more than 250 microns in diameter were scattered among them. Variant endothelial cells were usually multinucleated and possessed endothelium-specific markers of vWF and Weibel-Palade bodies. No incorporation of [3H]thymidine was found in the nuclei of cultured variant endothelial cells. Although most cultured endothelial cells were of the typical type, variant endothelial cells were interspersed throughout the culture. The ratio of variant endothelial cells to typical cells correlated well with the severity of atherosclerosis, but less so with aging. The number of variant endothelial cells in cultures from inferior venae cavae was slight and constant throughout all age groups. The presence of multinucleated endothelial cells in in vivo aortas was confirmed by both scanning and transmission electron microscopy. They sometimes existed in colonies in the aortas from elderly subjects with intimal-thickened or advanced atherosclerotic lesions. These results indicate that variant endothelial cells were present in vivo and their ratio in primary culture reflected the in vivo population. It is likely that these cells were formed by adhesion of adjacent typical endothelial cells and that this process was affected more by atherosclerosis than by aging. Although it is not clear if the multinucleated variant cells were formed before the formation of atherosclerotic plaque or after the plaque formation, they will contribute to further development of atherosclerotic lesions, which in turn cause malfunction of the cell membrane. We suggest that there is a cyclic effect of these processes for multiplication of the variant endothelial cells and advancement of atherosclerotic lesions.\r"

  ".W": "To determine whether or not male (NZWXBXSB)F1 [WXB)F1) mice exhibiting a lupus-like syndrome died of acute myocardial infarction (MI), and whether acute MI is directly related to small coronary artery disease, acute and old MIs were examined histologically in 55 dead (WXB)F1 male mice and 30 age-matched, surviving (WXB)F1 male mice used as a control group. In each heart from the 15 dead mice with MI and the five surviving mice without MI, 300 to 400 5-microns-thick serial sections were made; every fourth section was stained. Acute MI was found in 35 (64%) dead mice and in one (3%) survivors, whereas old MI was found in 50 (91%) dead mice and 17 (57%) survivors: a significant difference between the dead and surviving mice. The MIs were numerous, scattered, and small in most mice. Quantitative analysis revealed that the percentage of acute MI and old MI in the left ventricular (LV) wall was 6% +/- 11% and 3% +/- 3% in the dead group, and 0.4% and 2% +/- 3% in the control group. This indicated that recurrent acute MI is a major factor in the death of the mice. Although all the epicardial major coronary arteries of the (WXB)F1 male mice were intact, significant stenoses were noted in the intramyocardial small arteries. The serial sections in the 15 dead mice with MI revealed 1) segmental occlusive thrombi in the infarct-related small coronary artery in 14 of the 20 foci of acute anemic MIs, two of the 18 foci of acute hemorrhagic MIs, and four of the 58 foci of old MIs; and 2) segmental intimal thickenings in the infarct-related small artery in six of the 20 foci of acute anemic MIs, two of the 18 foci of acute hemorrhagic MIs, and 56 of the 58 foci of old MIs. There was no evidence of small coronary artery disease in the surviving mice without MI. The thrombus would result in thickened intima as MI progresses from the acute to the old stage. Because it was established that acute MI of hemorrhagic type follows reperfusion after transient occlusion of the coronary artery, hemorrhagic acute MI with rare incidence of thrombi in this mouse suggests that thrombolysis occurs after occlusion due to thrombus formation. Thus, the pathogenesis of multiple MIs is occlusive thrombi, recanalization in small coronary arteries or both. Some of the mice had dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM)-like features (marked LV dilatation).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

Extent of tranquilizer use before age 50 was the most powerful negative predictor of both mental and physical health outcomes at age 65. Another important predictor for mental health was maturity of defenses before age 50. Paradoxically, warm childhood environment made an important independent contribution to predicting physical--not mental--health.\r"

  ".W": "We investigated the effect of disinfectants on microbial contamination present on the interior surface of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) pipes filled with 600 ml of water contaminated with Pseudomonas pickettii and P. aeruginosa. After eight weeks, water was removed, and the test pipes exposed to various types of aqueous disinfectants. Disinfectant samples were removed, neutralized, and examined for recovery of microorganisms by membrane filtration. After seven-days exposure, disinfectant solutions were removed and pipes filled with sterile distilled water. Water was examined by membrane filtration at seven-day intervals to determine whether the organisms had survived in the pipes. Colonization of PVC surfaces were examined during each study phase by scanning electron-microscopy (SEM). P. aeruginosa was isolated directly from iodophor disinfectant, phenolic germicide, and iodophor antiseptic solutions. After addition of sterile water, P. aeruginosa was recovered from PVC pipes previously exposed to chlorine, phenolic, quaternary-ammonium, and iodophor disinfectants; P. pickettii was recovered from water in pipes treated with iodophor disinfectant, chlorine, and ethanol. The existence of glycocalyx-like cellular masses on the interior wall of PVC pipes most likely protected embedded organisms from the microbicidal action of some of the disinfectants tested and served as the reservoir for continuous contamination.\r"

Patients discharged alive from the nursing home were followed for two years or until death. The relative time spent at home, in hospitals, and in skilled nursing facilities is reported. Of the 705 patients discharged from their initial nursing home admission to homes in the community, about 50 percent made only one transfer and only 15 percent made four or more transfers. Of the 509 discharged to a hospital, 26 percent died there and 37 percent of the 374 survivors made four or more moves in the next two years. In all, 1,332 patients were discharged alive and they spent almost two-thirds of the subsequent two years, or their remaining lifetimes, in the community. Of those who transferred only once, over two-thirds of their follow-up time was spent in their own homes. Policies concerned with long-term care should use some type of actuarial data base to successfully plan and implement long-term care insurance.\r"

Elevated relative risks were associated with low maternal age, multiparity, maternal smoking, and male infants. Smoking doubled the risk and a clear dose-response relation by amount smoked was observed. Maternal smoking also seemed to influence the time of death, as infants of smokers died at an earlier age. In countries like Sweden, smoking may be the single most important preventable risk factor for sudden infant death syndrome.\r"

Data derive from the obstetric histories of both groups of women obtained while seeking prenatal care for a later pregnancy. A total of 639 women (304 exposed, 335 unexposed) had at least one previous pregnancy and lived at the same address since their first pregnancy. The geometric mean blood lead concentrations in the sample at the time of the interviews were 0.77 mumol/L in the exposed town and 0.25 mumol/L in the unexposed town. The rates of spontaneous abortions in first pregnancies were similar, with 16.4 percent of women in the exposed town and 14.0 percent in the unexposed town reporting loss. The adjusted odds ratio relating town of residence to spontaneous abortion was 1.1 (95% CI = 0.9, 1.4). This analysis represents the first systematic attempt to seek an association between environmental lead exposure and spontaneous abortion. As such, the failure to find a positive association strongly suggests that at the levels of exposure represented in our sample, such an association does not exist.\r"

The program goals were to reduce stress in the caregivers, improve functioning and reduce mortality in patients, and reduce health service utilization in patients. Subjects were patients at the Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore, Maryland, age 65 or over, who were returning home to the care of a non-paid caregiver and who had extensive post-hospital care needs which were expected to continue for at least one year. The 93 comparison group patient/caregiver pairs were discharged between May 15, 1983 and May 14, 1984. The 98 treatment group pairs were discharged between May 15, 1984 and May 14, 1985. Interviews were conducted with patients and caregivers at 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months after discharge. Results showed a slight reduction in caregiver stress and a substantial reduction in hospital days used by the treatment group. When confounding and history effects are taken into consideration, an average difference of 6.5 days per patients remains. The data also suggest that the treatment program may have postponed some deaths and nursing home placements. The results suggest that support services for the frail elderly and their caregivers can be cost efficient by reducing hospital length-of-stay. Savings were estimated at $4,585 per patient per year in this study. However, further work is needed to design programs which more effectively reduce caregiver stress.\r"

Three cases (less than 0.1%) of antibiotic-associated diarrhea and one case (less than 0.1%) of antibiotic-associated colitis were confirmed. We conclude that this methodology can provide further information about the safety of a drug once it is in customary use, at a fraction of the cost of Phase III clinical trials.\r"

Only 10 states reported AIDS prevention to be part of their client training programs, with training more likely to be found in institutional settings. Eleven states reported HIV positive cases, with such cases found more often in institutions than in community settings. Several states reported some type of segregation of HIV positive individuals.

For this analysis, the sample was restricted to 1,716 respondents ages 18-44 at the time of interview, drawn by probability sampling area household residents of all adult ages. Using Cox proportional hazards models, the onset of psychotherapeutic medicine use was modeled as a function of illicit drug use and psychiatric symptoms, both defined as time-dependent covariates. Newly observed in this analysis was an independent association of illicit drug use with psychotherapeutic medicine use, which was unexplained by psychiatric symptoms (relative hazard = 2.61, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 2.15, 3.18). Adjustment for age of onset of alcohol intoxication did not alter the impression that illicit drug users were more likely to initiate use of prescribed psychotherapeutic medicines (relative hazard = 2.52, 95% CI = 2.02, 3.11).\r"

Those with documented rubella immunization had a seronegative rate of 13 percent compared to 19 percent if the immunization status was unknown. For patients who received care in our clinic for less than two years, 32 percent were seronegative compared to 10 percent for those treated greater than or equal to 2 years (odds ratio = 0.31, 95% CI = 0.16, 0.60).

  ".W": "The value of monitoring the right precordial lead, V4R, to detect peri-operative ischaemic events during coronary artery surgery was studied in 60 patients. Thirty-four patients had only left-sided coronary disease (Group 1). The other 26 patients had both left-sided occlusive coronary artery disease and significant right-sided occlusive lesions on coronary angiography (Group 2). Lead sensitivity was estimated, assuming that all ST segment changes were true positive responses. Sensitivity using a single lead was greatest for lead V5 in the two groups (73% for Group 1 and 69% for Group 2). Sensitivity in Group 1 for lead II was intermediate (55%), whereas sensitivity for lead V4R was only 9%. In Group 2, on the other hand, lead V4R was 54% sensitive and lead II only 31%. The combination of leads V4R and V5 increased the sensitivity to 92% in Group 2, whereas lead II or V5 combined with V4R failed to improve sensitivity in Group 1. The monitoring of lead V4R allowed detection of 23% of the ischaemic episodes in Group 2 that would have passed undetected if only lead II and V5 were monitored. These results demonstrate the value of an additional right precordial lead during coronary artery bypass grafting in patients with right-sided occlusive disease.\r"

Twenty-three patients developed unequal pupils at some stage, while six had equal pupils throughout but exhibited differing reaction to light. Major cerebral deficit was significantly more common after operation in patients who developed inequality in pupil size than those who did not (p less than 0.05). No relationship was seen between dissimilar pupil reaction to light and the development of neurological complications. The clinical estimation of pupil size may help to identify those patients who may exhibit postoperative major neurological dysfunction.\r"

Correlation between these tests after recovery from standardised general anaesthesia was calculated in 22 patients. Moderate to high correlation was found between CRT and CRT doubletask (r = 0.62 to r = 0.73), when parameters of six different tests were compared. Finger tapping correlated moderately with the movement time of both the CRT and the CRT doubletask (r = 0.46 and r = 0.47 respectively). We concluded that the CRT test, which measures initiation and movement time, might replace the CRT doubletask and the FTT. The CFF correlated moderately with the initiation time of the CRT doubletask, but because a slightly different function seems to be involved, further research is needed. Maddox wing and the p-deletion test correlated with no other test. Results indicated that recovery is differentiated in at least four distinct psychomotor functions, which should be tested by CRT (to measure initiation and movement time), Maddox wing and p-deletion.\r"

The tourniquet was inflated either to occlusion pressure plus 100 mmHg or to occlusion pressure plus 200 mmHg. Plasma prilocaine levels were measured while the tourniquet remained inflated and after release of the tourniquet. All four techniques resulted in a low incidence and magnitude of prilocaine leak and low prilocaine plasma levels after tourniquet release. The data suggest that slow injection with the high tourniquet inflation pressure is better, although the differences in leakage with an intact tourniquet were not statistically significant. Excellent analgesia was achieved in over 90% of patients and there were no complete failures. No dangerously high prilocaine plasma levels were produced and no serious side effects observed.\r"

Systolic and diastolic arterial pressures in the fibreoptic group were significantly lower than in the control group during the first minute after intubation. The maximum increase in diastolic pressure was significantly lower in the fibreoptic group. The heart rate in the fibreoptic group was significantly higher than in the control group during all five minutes after intubation. The maximum increase in heart rate was significantly higher in the fibreoptic group. The cardiovascular responses to fibreoptic nasotracheal intubation under general anaesthesia should not cause undue concern in fit patients, but appropriate measures should be taken to prevent excessive tachycardia in compromised patients.\r"

The ability to remove large amounts of fluid during haemofiltration dialysis proved to be effective in preventing this. All three patients had impaired liver function and showed evidence of chlormethiazole accumulation after 4-6 days. The combination of progressive reduction in dose and daily withdrawal of infusions prevented a major problem. Acceptance of this technique by the patients was high. Chlormethiazole may be a useful addition to the drugs available to provide sedation in well defined clinical circumstances.\r"

Patients were assigned to one of two groups on the basis of fractional shortening. The first group consisted of 44 patients with a normal fractional shortening (greater than 0.17), and the second group, of 47 patients with a fractional shortening of 0.17 or less. The two groups were similar in respect to all historical and physical findings. Median survival was eleven months for patients with a decreased fractional shortening and twenty-six months for patients with a normal fractional shortening. Patients with a decreased fractional shortening had a significantly shorter survival (p = 0.01). The authors conclude that congestive heart failure with preserved systolic function is common and is associated with a better prognosis, and the literature suggests it may require nonstandard therapy. Their data also suggest, however, that CHF patients with preserved systolic function cannot be reliably distinguished at the bedside. Rather, echocardiography or other tests of systolic wall motion are needed to make the diagnosis.\r"

In order to test this hypothesis, IV aminophylline (6 mg/kg over fifteen minutes), a dosage known to effectively block adenosine receptors, was acutely administered--in a double-blind, placebo-controlled study design--in 13 patients with intermittent claudication and documented atherosclerotic disease. All patients performed two treadmill exercise tests at the same hour on two consecutive days, five minutes after aminophylline or placebo administration randomly allocated. Pain-free time was 109 +/- 133 (mean +/- SD) seconds after placebo and 173 +/- 165 seconds after aminophylline (p less than .01); maximum time to claudication was 273 +/- 191 seconds after placebo and 397 +/- 318 seconds after aminophylline (p less than .05). The authors conclude that intravenous aminophylline markedly increases the walking capacity in patients with intermittent claudication, possibly by preventing flow maldistribution phenomena through adenosine receptors blockade.\r"

Before treatment there were no significant differences for all measured parameters between the two groups of patients. Seven days later, ST elevations were statistically different for NST and sigma ST with lower values for the s group. Higher values for NR and sigma R were also noted in this group. No statistically significant difference was found for NQ and sigma Q. CK-MB curve showed an earlier peak in the s group than in the control group. Five patients from the s group showed a patency of the infarct-related vessel. In conclusion, the results of this study show that patients receiving s have a significant benefit with ECG improvement. On the other hand, the CK-MB curve indicates an eventual recanalization to a certain degree in the obstructed coronary artery, which is the final goal.\r"

In the hypertensive patients at rest, peak early diastolic (E) velocity was lower, and atrial (A) velocity higher, with lower E/A peak velocity ratios than in normals (p less than 0.05). These differences were more accentuated during isometric stress. Atrial filling fractions were higher in hypertensives (37 +/- 6%) than in normals (24 +/- 7%) at rest, p less than 0.05, and this difference increased during isometric stress (44 +/- 9% versus 30 +/- 11%). Thus, isometric stress accentuated the reliance of left ventricular filling on atrial contribution and may be applied for the detection of early ventricular filling abnormalities in patients with mild hypertension. The systolic blood pressure and the hypertrophic process were both important determinants of left ventricular diastolic filling.\r"

  ".W": "There is a recent need to study glucose metabolism of the heart in ischemic, as well as in \"hibernating or stunned\" myocardium, and compare it with that in perfusion studies. In non-positron emission tomography centers, positron imaging is possible with a standard Anger-type camera if proper collimation and adequate shielding of the camera crystal can be achieved. For the study with fast-decaying isotopes, seven-pinhole tomography (7PHT), a limited-angle method designed for transaxial tomography of the left ventricle using a nonrotating camera, is well suited, because projections are acquired simultaneously. Individual adjustment (patient supine) of the camera's view axis (CAx) with the left ventricular axis (LVAx) gives excellent results: sensitivity for CHD 82%, specificity 72% in a prospective 201TI study (48 patients, x-ray coronarography as reference). Good alignment of CAx with LVAx is also achieved with the patient prone in LAO in a hammock above the camera surface. In this setting additional lead shielding of the camera is possible using a table reinforced with 5 cm of lead with a central hole for the 7PH-collimator, which has a special lead inlay. This allows utilization of the 511 KeV emitter 18F-FDG, which with a half-life of 109 minutes, can be transported a reasonable distance from the production site. System sensitivity and resolution for 18F was found comparable to 201Tl, 99mTc, and 123I using a phantom. First clinical examinations after 201Tl stress/redistribution studies showed increased 18F-FDG uptake in ischemic heart segments, as well as in \"hibernating\" nonperfused or \"stunned\" myocardium.\r"

However, the detection of coronary artery disease in patients with peripheral vascular disease may be complicated, since most of these patients are unable to perform conventional exercise testing. The authors report a sixty-two-year-old man with an infrarenally located aneurysm of the abdominal aorta who underwent thallium 201 scintigraphy combined with dipyridamole infusion as an alternative exercise test. The subsequent thallium 201 images showed perfusion defects indicative of severe coronary artery disease. Coronary angiography showed an occluded right coronary artery and a significant proximal stenosis in the left anterior descending coronary artery. The patient underwent successful aortocoronary bypass surgery, and two months later, the aortic aneurysm was operated on without complications. As a result, dipyridamole thallium 201 scintigraphy should be considered as a valuable diagnostic test to detect coronary artery disease in patients with peripheral vascular disorders.\r"

Seventeen patients were RAST positive and nine negative for whole milk proteins. No differences were found in the lymphocyte stimulation test response between RAST-positive and RAST-negative subjects.

The RAST screening revealed that 73% of patients had specific IgE antibodies to at least one of the 16 molds. Eighteen percent were negative to the six molds of the previous RAST panel but had specific IgE antibodies to at least one of the ten new molds. The highest frequency of IgE antibodies in the A group could be assigned to Cladosporium, followed by Botrytis and Helminthosporium. In group B, sensitivity to Botrytis and Phoma showed the highest frequencies. This study revealed that the relative importance of mold genera may vary greatly between patient groups from different geographic areas. Some of the species of the expanded RAST panel seem to be at least as important as Alternaria and Cladosporium. Multiple sensitivities seem to be caused by sensitization by many mold species rather than by cross-reactivity.\r"

  ".W": "Accepted therapy for intermediate-thickness melanomas is wide local excision and regional lymphadenectomy for nodes known to be in the lymph drainage basin. Lymphoscintigraphy has been shown to be of great help in predicting the drainage pattern of truncal, shoulder, proximal extremity, and head and neck melanomas. Lymphoscintigraphy using Technetium-99 antimony sulfur colloid was performed on 17 patients with cutaneous melanomas at H. Lee Moffitt Cancer Center at the University of South Florida. Of 13 patients with primary truncal and shoulder lesions, drainage patterns were discordant 54 per cent of the time and resulted in dissection of nodal groups different than would otherwise have been planned. This resulted in several lymph nodes positive for metastatic disease removed from operative sites not expected to show metastatic spread by clinical experience alone. The discordant rate for head and neck drainage was also high with 2 of 3 forehead studies showing drainage to both anterior and posterior cervical chains when only anterior chain drainage was expected, while only one of these drained to the preauricular nodes. Again, this led to elective lymph-node dissections of nodal basins not anticipated on clinical grounds alone. After a mean follow-up of 2 years, in which 60 to 75 per cent of all recurrences from melanoma are expected to occur, there has been no lymph-node metastasis development in basins that were not predicted by the scan. It is clear from our data that well-known historical patterns of lymph drainage in addition to the clinical impression of experienced surgeons cannot reliably predict the lymphatic drainage of many truncal, shoulder, and head and neck melanomas.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

One day after initiation of therapy, the mean fistula output for the group decreased by 52 per cent. By three days, fistula output decreased by 70 per cent. All fistulas closed in 7 to 44 days. Adverse reactions to the drug included diarrhea in one patient and transient hyperglycemia in another. Sandostatin is effective in decreasing drainage from external pancreatic fistulas and may, therefore, facilitate their closure. No serious adverse reactions to the drug were noted. Further studies will better define the role of Sandostatin in the treatment of pancreatic fistulas.\r"

  ".W": "Because dislocation of the knee (DK) is accompanied by a substantial risk of popliteal artery injury, the importance of arteriography in ruling out occult arterial damage in such patients is well accepted. However, because antecedent DK cannot be ruled out in a trauma victim presenting only with severe knee ligamentous disruption (LD), we have routinely performed arteriography in all patients presenting with grossly unstable knees, whether or not DK is present. To evaluate this policy we reviewed the records of 30 patients with either DK (n = 19) or severe LD (n = 11). There was no significant difference between DK and LD in the frequency of major (22% vs 18%) or minor (38% vs 36%) vascular abnormalities. We also found that Doppler pressure measurements were highly predictive of major arterial trauma in patients in whom it was used. We conclude that arterial injury should be ruled out in all trauma victims with severe knee ligament disruption, whether or not actual joint dislocation is present.\r"

Five patients presented at the time of rupture and in three of those the aneurysm communicated with the biliary tree causing hemobilia. The aneurysm was located in the right hepatic artery in four patients; in the common hepatic artery in two patients, and in the left hepatic artery in one patient. Excision of the aneurysm was performed in five cases, but in two cases a liver resection had to be carried out. Five of the seven patients survived, including both patients who had elective surgery. It is concluded that hepatic artery aneurysms have a high tendency to rupture and therefore an elective operation should be performed in all patients with diagnosed aneurysm of the hepatic artery.\r"

Over the past two and a half years endoscopic balloon dilation was performed in eight patients for stenosis of gastrojejunostomy following gastric bypass. The technique of dilation, indications, and pitfalls are discussed. The procedure was safe and effective. Patients who had dilation performed successfully avoided surgery entirely in seven of eight cases. Therapy was modified in two other patients based on endoscopy findings. Endoscopy was found to be more reliable and superior to upper gastrointestinal (UGI) series for evaluation of symptoms following gastric bypass procedures. Based on our experience and literature review we propose that endoscopy is the preferred alternative to major reoperative surgery and urge its wider use.\r"

SUBJECTS: Healthy postmenopausal women (55 to 75 years old) were recruited from the convents in and around Maastricht. Controls (25 to 40 years old) were healthy premenopausal volunteers. INTERVENTION: Daily administration of 1 mg of vitamin K for 2 weeks. MEASUREMENTS: Serum immunoreactive osteocalcin: hydroxylapatite binding (HAB) capacity of serum immunoreactive osteocalcin; excretion of calcium, hydroxyproline, and creatinine in the urine during the last 2 h of a 16-h fasting period. RESULTS: In premenopausal women, no effect of vitamin K administration was seen. In the postmenopausal group, vitamin K induced increased serum immunoreactive osteocalcin concentration; normalization of the HAB capacity of serum immunoreactive osteocalcin (this marker was less than 50% that of the controls in the pretreatment samples); a decrease in urinary calcium excretion, notably in the \"fast losers\" of calcium; and a parallel decrease in urinary hydroxyproline excretion in the fast losers of calcium. CONCLUSIONS: The serum immunoreactive osteocalcin level may vary with vitamin K status. This variance should be taken into consideration if osteocalcin is used as a marker for osteoblast activity. Vitamin K is one factor that may play a role in the loss of bone mass in postmenopausal osteoporosis.\r"

DESIGN: Mailed survey. PARTICIPANTS: A random sample of 2500 American College of Physicians (ACP) members identified as general internists; 1806 (72%) responded. Of these, we excluded 398 who were board eligible or board certified in a subspecialty and 143 with unknown status. The resulting sample of 1179 was augmented in selected analyses by an additional sample of 199 rural internists. RESULTS: General internists did, on average, 16 of the 40 procedures. Practice characteristics markedly affected the number and variety of procedures done. A larger number of different procedures was independently associated with smaller cities, smaller hospitals, younger age, increased hours in patient care, and certain regions of the country. Practice characteristics varied considerably by practice type and location. Many procedures were done infrequently. There was reasonable agreement on the experience needed to attain and maintain competency in each procedure. The majority of respondents favored hospital credentialing for 22 of the 40 procedures. CONCLUSIONS: General internists do a wide variety of procedures, the number and frequency of which are affected by the characteristics and location of their practice. Despite opinion to the contrary, more recently trained general internists do a wider variety of procedures than older colleagues. These results provide data to help define standards for training and credentialing and suggest that we should reexamine general internists' training in procedural skills.\r"

DESIGN: Case series ascertained through investigation of extant obstructive lung disease (index cases, 22 subjects) or by other means (non-index cases, 30 subjects). SETTING: Referral-based pulmonary division at a tertiary care medical center. PARTICIPANTS: Fifty-two alpha-1-antitrypsin-deficient persons of type Pi Z ascertained by: extant chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (22 cases), family studies (20 cases), liver disease (4 cases), population screening (4 cases), and other pulmonary problems (2 cases). MEASUREMENTS and MAIN RESULTS: Pulmonary function tests and a version of the American Thoracic Society 1978 standard respiratory epidemiology questionnaire were used. Persons of type Pi Z who were not specifically ascertained with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease had values of forced expiratory volume in 1 second over 65% of predicted in 20 out of 30 cases and frequently had normal lung function. Univariate and multivariate analyses of possible causes of lung disease showed that the following factors were significant (P less than 0.05): pulmonary symptoms (effects associated with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), including dyspnea and chronic cough; age and pack-years of smoking (epidemiologic correlates); and other pulmonary conditions (potential causes or effects) including asthma, pneumonia, and episodes of increased cough and phlegm. Finally, we found a striking excess of questionnaire-reported parental emphysema in families of type Pi Z persons with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease compared with families of type Pi Z persons without disease. CONCLUSIONS: Many persons with alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency do not have clinically significant lung function impairment: the perceived natural history of antitrypsin deficiency has been distorted by ascertainment bias. In addition to cigarette smoking, it appears that asthma, lower respiratory infections, and possibly some familial factors contribute to a severe clinical course. Follow-up of our cohort with widely varying lung function will provide insights into the natural history of the emphysema associated with alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency.\r"

DESIGN: Retrospective analysis of data collected during exercise testing and coronary angiography. SETTING: A 1000-bed Veterans Affairs Medical Center. PARTICIPANTS: The study included 328 male patients who had had both a sign- or symptom-limited treadmill test and coronary angiography. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Of the 168 patients who had abnormal ST-segment responses, 26 had such responses only during recovery. The positive predictive value of this pattern for significant angiographic disease (84%) was not statistically different from the predictive value of ST depression occurring during exercise (87%). Inclusion of ST depression during recovery significantly increased the sensitivity of the exercise test from 50% to 59% (P = 0.01) without a change in predictive value. In addition, ST-segment depression occurring only during exercise is usually associated with less-severe angiographic coronary artery disease. CONCLUSION: The occurrence of ST-segment depression during the recovery period only, does not generally represent a \"false-positive\" response. The inclusion of findings from this period increases the diagnostic yield of the exercise test. Previously proposed exercise test scores, as well as exercise electrocardiography (ECG) analysis done in conjunction with scintigraphy, have a falsely lowered sensitivity that could be increased by considering ST-segment changes occurring in recovery.\r"

PATIENTS: Eight patients with longstanding traumatic transection of the lower cervical cord. METHODS: The electromyographic activity of the pectoralis major and abdominal external oblique muscles and the changes in the anteroposterior diameter of the lower rib cage, the upper rib cage, and the abdomen were measured during voluntary coughing efforts in the seated posture. RESULTS: When coughing, all subjects showed a large amount of electrical activity in the pectoralis major with no activity in the external oblique. Simultaneously, they had a clear-cut decrease in the anteroposterior diameter of the upper rib cage together with an increase in the anteroposterior diameter of the abdomen. In five subjects, the anteroposterior diameter of the lower rib cage also showed an initial increase. These changes were seen when cough was initiated at functional residual capacity or at a higher lung volume; they were also seen during a fit of coughing. CONCLUSIONS: In tetraplegic subjects the clavicular portion of the pectoralis major plays a major role during coughing. Its contraction causes a reduction in the size of the upper part of the rib cage and a rise in intrathoracic pressure; this pressure rise results secondarily in an outward (paradoxical) motion of the abdomen and the lower rib cage. Cough in tetraplegic subjects is thus an active, rather than a passive, process, and its effectiveness might be improved by a combination of specific muscle training and abdominal binding.\r"

DESIGN: Clinical case study. SETTING: University-affiliated hospitals and outpatient clinics. PATIENTS: Consecutive sample of 17 patients. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: All of the 17 patients had bilateral parotid gland enlargement; 14 had xerostomia and 6 had xerophthalmia. Of the 17 patients, 14 had generalized lymphadenopathy, 10 had histologically proved lymphocytic interstitial pneumonitis, 4 had neurologic involvement, and 3 had lymphocytic infiltration of the gastrointestinal tract. Gallium scanning in all of 11 tested patients showed abnormal salivary gland uptake. Minor salivary gland biopsies showed more than 2 lymphocytic foci per 4 mm2 tissue in all of 11 tested patients, the infiltrate consisting predominantly of CD8 cells. Fifteen patients had circulating CD8 lymphocytosis; the principal phenotype of these cells was CD8+ CD29+. Rheumatoid factor and antinuclear antibodies were infrequent, and none of the patients had anti-Ro/SS-A or anti-La/SS-B antibodies. HLA-DR5 was significantly more frequent in the black patients (10 of 12) compared with controls (13 of 45). Only one patient developed an opportunistic infection during 544 patient-months of study, and none has died of AIDS. CONCLUSIONS: A distinct syndrome primarily characterized by parotid gland enlargement, sicca symptoms, and pulmonary involvement occurs in HIV infection. This disorder is associated with CD8 lymphocytosis and the presence of HLA-DR5, and appears to be a genetically determined host immune response to HIV.\r"

DESIGN: Survey of elderly persons and other adults seeking care at an emergency department. PATIENTS: Four-hundred twenty-four randomly selected adults seeking care at a university-affiliated hospital emergency department. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: We evaluated 424 randomly selected visits to a hospital emergency department made by 186 persons over age 65 and 238 younger adults; all of the subjects were discharged without hospital admission. Forty-seven percent of visits led to added medication, and in 10% of the visits in which at least one medication was added, a new medication added a potential adverse interaction. The interactions were determined by a computer program, were reviewed using explicit criteria, and were excluded if of uncertain or trivial clinical significance, rare, or not established for that specific drug. The number of medications used at presentation was the best predictor of whether a potential interaction would be introduced. CONCLUSIONS: In the emergency departments studied, a medication history was recorded on every patient and was available to physicians, but physicians did not routinely screen for potential drug interactions. Further safeguards are needed to protect patients from receiving medications that could produce adverse interactions.\r"

  ".W": "A study of 832 patients operated on within 30 days of infarction from 1974 to 1987 has resulted in 2,388 patient-years (maximum, 14 years) of prospectively acquired follow-up. This study excludes 74 patients in whom cardiogenic shock was the indication for operation. Five-year survival (+/- standard error) was 84% +/- 2%, 85% +/- 1%, and 90% +/- 1%, and 10-year survival was 71% +/- 4%, 68% +/- 1%, and 78% +/- 1% for patients with acute infarction, remote infarction, and no previous infarction, respectively. Age and left ventricular end-diastolic pressure significantly affected long-term survival for patients with acute infarction by both univariate and multivariate analysis. For patients aged less than 65 years, the 5-year and 10-year actuarial survival rates were 89% +/- 2% and 80% +/- 4%, compared with 75% +/- 3% and 58% +/- 9%, respectively, for patients aged more than 65 years. The survival percentages were 89% +/- 2% and 75% +/- 6% for patients with left ventricular end-diastolic pressure less than 15 mm Hg compared with 77% +/- 5% and 67% +/- 7% for patients with left ventricular end-diastolic pressure greater than 15 mm Hg. Operative mortality was 7.6% for patients operated on within 24 hours, compared with 4.1% for patients operated on between 2 and 30 days after infarction. Ten-year survival was similar (about 70%) for all timing groups. Based on these long-term results, there appears to be little to gain by delaying coronary artery bypass grafting, when indicated, after infarction occurs.\r"

  ".W": "We have reviewed chest roentgenograms of 745 patients before hospital dismissal after cardiac operations and serially to determine the incidence and prognosis of elevated hemidiaphragm and any relationship to the use of topical ice slush (TIS) in myocardial preservation. All patients had similar myocardial preservation techniques including moderate systemic hypothermia and 4 degrees C saline solution poured over the heart at aortic clamping. During a 12-month period, TIS was added to the saline bath. Two (2.4%) of 84 patients before TIS and 5 (2.5%) of 201 consecutive patients operated on since discontinuing TIS had elevated hemidiaphragm on the predismissal roentgenogram. Of 460 patients in whom TIS was employed, 109 (23.7%) had elevated hemidiaphragm (p less than 0.001). When TIS was employed, elevated hemidiaphragm developed in 72 (26%) of 280 patients without internal mammary artery takedown versus 13 of 33 patients (39.4%) with takedown of the internal mammary artery (p = 0.047). Ninety-nine patients with elevated hemidiaphragm were available for follow-up at 1 month, at which time 79 (79.8%) continued to have elevated diaphragm. At 1 year, 14 (21.9%) of 64 patients had persistent diaphragm elevation. We conclude that TIS predisposes to elevated diaphragm and that the incidence is increased when the internal mammary artery is harvested.\r"

When direct anastomosis between these collateral vessels and the central pulmonary arteries is not technically feasible, an interposition graft is required. Dacron, polytetrafluoroethylene, and pericardium have been used for this purpose. We describe our experience with the use of azygos vein as an interposition graft in 3 patients who underwent unifocalization of the pulmonary blood supply to the right lung. Our experience suggests that the azygos vein is a useful graft for use in this specific form of unifocalization procedure.\r"

Ninety-six percent of surviving patients were in New York Heart Association functional class I at last follow-up, and the slight decline in this percentage as the interval between operation and last follow-up lengthened could have been due to chance alone (p = 0.24) and was no different in patients with a transannular patch. Transannular patching was a risk factor for reoperation for pulmonary regurgitation late postoperatively, but only a 7% incidence within 20 years is predicted when mild residual stenoses are beyond the patch: the incidence rises to about 20% with important distal stenoses. Inferences from the study are relevant to the indications for transannular patching and insertion of allograft semilunar valves at the time of repair.\r"

Fourteen normal hearts were used for comparison. In the hearts with common arterial trunk, the location and level of the coronary artery orifices (as well as the relationship of the truncal root to the area of fibrous continuity with the mitral valve) are different from those in normal hearts. In none of the hearts with common arterial trunk (particularly the 53 hearts with three leaflets in the truncal valve) did the appearance of the truncal valve approximate that of a normal aortic valve. Among the 22 hearts with four leaflets, there was a high incidence of coronary artery orifices in opposite sinuses (17/22 or 77.3%) and a low incidence of coronary artery orifices in adjacent sinuses (2/22 or 9.1%). These results suggest that the formation of the truncal valve is independent of the formation of the coronary orifices. Its leaflets are not predestined to become part of either the aortic valve or the pulmonary valve.\r"

Clinical attempts to solve this problem using synthetic materials or glutaraldehyde-fixed pericardial xenograft have been less than satisfactory. Although experimental animal results have been good, they have not considered the influence of cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) on adhesion formation. This study addressed the influence of CPB on the formation of adhesions and evaluated biodegradable polyglycolic acid as a material to reduce adhesions and as a pericardial substitute. Forty-five weanling sheep received implants of pericardial xenograft and polyglycolic acid with and without CPB. The pericardial xenograft showed no adhesions when implanted without CPB, but severe adhesions formed and a thick fibrinous layer covered the heart when CPB was used, making identification of coronary arteries at reoperation very difficult. The polyglycolic acid mesh implanted without CPB was absorbed and replaced with newly formed host collagen. With CPB, the polyglycolic acid was more rapidly absorbed, and a thinner layer of host collagen formed. Therefore, future animal studies must include CPB. In agreement with reported clinical results, glutaraldehyde-fixed pericardial tissue implanted with CPB resulted in severe epicardial reaction and therefore is not an ideal pericardial substitute.\r"

Patients with ventricular dysfunction, myocardial ischemia, and limited cardiac reserve undergoing an urgent operation represent a challenge to modern methods of myocardial protection. To improve results of operation a new technique was devised with continuous infusion of cold oxygenated blood cardioplegia during the entire cross-clamp period. Between 1984 and 1988, 19 consecutive patients with severe mitral regurgitation and cardiogenic shock (systolic blood pressure less than 60 mm Hg) after myocardial infarction underwent urgent myocardial revascularization, mitral valve replacement, or both. Left ventricular ejection fraction was less than 40% in 16 of 19 patients. All patients had suffered myocardial infarction within 4 weeks of operation and underwent an urgent operation within 24 hours of the onset of hemodynamic compromise. Severe three-vessel coronary artery disease was present in 16 of the 19 patients. A continuous infusion of blood cardioplegia was instituted at aortic cross-clamping and continued throughout the cross-clamp period. Infusion of continuous blood cardioplegia was also instituted through each completed distal vein graft. Myocardial septal and left ventricular apical temperatures were maintained at 10 degrees +/- 2 degrees C throughout the cross-clamp period. There were two in-hospital deaths (mortality, 10.5%) and low output syndrome was present in 10 patients (53%). At a mean follow-up of 2.5 years, there was one late death and 14 of the 16 remaining patients were in New York Heart Association functional class I or II.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Worldwide experience with the Bjork-Shiley valve supports the need for long-term anticoagulation to prevent entrapment of the disc. Replacement of the malfunctioning device is associated with a high mortality, and therefore a more expeditious method is desirable. It is our experience that simple thrombectomy may suffice in most occasions, even for the mitral position, and especially when done through a bicameral approach in order to visualize both supravalvular and infravalvular regions. The philosophy and results with thrombectomy and disc rotation in 12 cases of thrombotic occlusion of the Bjork-Shiley valve are described. It is suggested that this method may be preferable to replacement of the thrombosed prosthetic valve in select patients.\r"

Passive distention of the right heart inherent with right atrial cardioplegia has been shown to impair right ventricular function in a canine model of global ischemia. This study was designed to compare right ventricular performance after right atrial cardioplegia administered intermittently (n = 5) and continuously (n = 5) with coronary sinus retrograde cardioplegia (n = 5) and aortic root cardioplegia (n = 8) in a canine model of acute right ventricular ischemia and reperfusion. Right ventricular performance was assessed using the load-independent relationship of end-systolic pressure versus dimension (myocardial fiber length). Right ventricular performance was well preserved after reperfusion in those dogs protected with intermittent right atrial cardioplegia (95% of control). Results with continuous right atrial cardioplegia (66% of control) and coronary sinus retrograde cardioplegia (40% of control) demonstrated diminished postreperfusion right ventricular performance. Right ventricular performance in the group protected with aortic root cardioplegia was significantly impaired after reperfusion when compared with all retrograde groups (34% of control, p less than 0.05). In this model, postreperfusion right ventricular performance was preserved in the right atrial cardioplegia groups despite passive ventricular distention. All methods of retrograde cardioplegia resulted in superior preservation of right ventricular performance when compared with standard aortic root cardioplegia.\r"

Serial left ventriculograms showed that within four hours the infarct segment expands, wall thickness decreases, and aneurysmal dilatation occurs and progresses over the next 60 days in all sheep. Epicardial ventricular point references indicated that adjacent noninfarcted myocardium participates in the formation of the aneurysm. Anatomy of the coronary vasculature was studied in 22 excised sheep hearts. In sheep, coronary arterial anatomy is remarkably constant. The left coronary artery provides all of the blood supply to the left ventricle and septum and only a small rim of both the anterior and posterior right ventricles. Cardiac veins from the left ventricle drain into the coronary sinus, which also receives the left azygos vein. Right ventricular veins drain separately. The essentially separate coronary circulations to the two ventricles, the paucity of coronary collateral circulation, and the consistent evolution of left ventricular infarcts into aneurysms are important advantages of the ovine model for both metabolic and ventricular mechanical studies of acute myocardial infarction and left ventricular aneurysm.\r"

Five patients had a delay of nine to 89 days before operation. All of them had good primary healing but later developed dyspnea. Bronchoscopy revealed scar obstruction in all 5. The stenosed segment was resected in 4 patients at thoracotomy. The fifth patient, who had an intermediate bronchus rupture, underwent lobectomy. Seven patients were followed from 6 months to 18 years. One of them, who had a nine-day delay in treatment, needed further operation 6 months after the accident because of scar obstruction. The other 6 patients were interviewed, examined, and studied with spirometry, body plethysmography, bronchoscopy, and bronchography. In these 6 patients no stricture was seen, and there was no reduced pulmonary function due to the rupture even when operation was delayed.\r"

Of these patients, 144 (5.9%) underwent percutaneous cricothyroidostomy (minitracheostomy) using a 20F pediatric silver tracheostomy tube. Minitracheostomies were performed for the treatment of sputum retention in 81 patients, prophylactically in 62 patients, and as a route for high-frequency jet ventilation in 1 patient. Minitracheostomy tubes remained in situ a median of four days. Suction function was satisfactory in 99% of patients, with only 2 patients requiring subsequent suction bronchoscopy and no occurrence of tube blockage. Ninety-four percent of minitracheostomies performed were entirely uneventful. Bleeding was the most common complication (3.5%), and no instances of subglottic stenosis have occurred. During the review period, there was a significant increase in the percentage of patients requiring major operations undergoing prophylactic, but not therapeutic, minitracheostomy (p less than 0.001). This was associated with a significant decrease in the percentage of patients requiring suction bronchoscopy (p less than 0.001). We conclude that prophylactic minitracheostomy with the 20F pediatric silver tracheostomy tube is a safe and effective procedure in the prevention of postoperative sputum retention.\r"

Requirements for lung donors, management before explantation, and methods of preservation were reviewed for the 70 heart-lung, eight double-lung, and two single-lung transplantations performed at the University of Pittsburgh since 1982. Careful observation of trends of hyperoxygenation studies, chest roentgenograms, and Gram stain and culture results of tracheal secretions, as well as findings on bronchoscopy, can help identify which lungs not only have adequate function but are acceptable for transplantation. In spite of the rigid criteria used, 76% of tracheal cultures from donors deemed acceptable grew organisms. The presence of oropharyngeal flora has been shown to correlate with the development of early intrathoracic infections in the recipient. Prophylactic broad-spectrum antibiotic treatment of the donor is desirable to treat microbial contamination that could cause focal injury to the donor lung and predispose to infection in the recipient. Acceptance of less than ideal donors is ill-advised even though rejection of such donors conflicts with the current shortage of organs.\r"

In all groups, mean serum levels of potassium rose within 1 week and showed no further change thereafter. However, the hydrochlorothiazide/triamterene and hydrochlorothiazide plus 40 mmol of potassium regimens were significantly more effective in restoring serum potassium levels than was the hydrochlorothiazide plus 20 mmol of potassium regimen. A significant increase in magnesium levels was observed only in the group treated with the hydrochlorothiazide/triamterene combination.

The unsafe group had less adequate knowledge about human immunodeficiency virus transmission but felt safer from the risk of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome even when engaging in unsafe sex. Educational programs dealing more directly with belief systems and the potential addiction to recreational drugs and sexual behaviors need to be developed for primary care settings.\r"

Of 209 patients taking enalapril, 22 (10.5%) required discontinuation of therapy because of an intractable, dry cough. Cough was more than twice as common in women; 16 (14.6%) of 109 women and 6 (6%) of 100 men stopped taking enalapril because of cough. The cough resolved in 21 of 22 patients within 2 weeks of discontinuation of enalapril therapy. When the patients with cough were compared with the others, there was no significant difference in age, smoking status, creatinine levels, enalapril dosage, associated cardiopulmonary disease, or concomitant administration of medications. Among the 187 study patients who did not discontinue taking enalapril because of cough, many developed a persistent, dry cough that to date has not been severe enough to require discontinuation of therapy, after a mean follow-up period of 16 months. The enalapril-induced cough is insidious, dry, persistent, benign, and reversible on discontinuation of therapy. It is important to distinguish enalapril-induced cough from cough resulting from acute illness, reactive airway disease, and congestive heart failure. Optimal clinical application of enalapril in the treatment of hypertension and congestive heart failure will require increased awareness of this incessant cough, which requires discontinuation of the therapy in about 10% of patients.\r"

To examine this possibility and its pathophysiologic implications, we report the results of two studies. The first evaluated responses to head-up tilt in young and old subjects. Presyncopal vasovagal symptoms occurred in 4 of 9 young subjects and only 1 of 22 old subjects. The second study asked whether decreased beta-adrenergic responsiveness protected the old during tilt via unopposed alpha-adrenergic-mediated vasoconstriction. Blood pressure, heart rate, and forearm vascular resistance responses to tilt in 11 healthy young subjects randomized to receive intravenous propranolol hydrochloride or saline were compared with those of 10 healthy elderly. Propranolol attenuated heart rate and forearm vascular resistance responses. Vasovagal symptoms occurred in 4 young and no old subjects; 2 were symptomatic during propranolol administration. Thus, presyncopal vasovagal symptoms are less common during tilt in old age. Propranolol did not prevent the vasovagal reaction or enhance forearm vasoconstriction. Propranolol's attenuation of vasoconstriction may be due to decreased activation of cardiopulmonary baroreceptors during beta-blockade.\r"

This mean admission serum theophylline concentration of this cohort was 0.331 mmol/L, with a range of 0.165 to 0.982 mmol/L. The simultaneous mean serum potassium concentration was 3.36 mmol/L (range, 2.20 to 5.80 mmol/L). Fifty-three patients (60%) were hypokalemic on hospital arrival. When, on the basis of recent ingestion, patients were separated into acute, chronic, or acute-on-chronic categories of theophylline intoxication, significant differences in serum potassium were found: Patients with acute theophylline intoxication had a mean serum potassium concentration of 2.94 mmol/L; 85% were hypokalemic. In contrast, patients with chronic theophylline intoxication had a mean serum potassium concentration of 3.83 mmol/L, with a 32% frequently of hypokalemia. These data demonstrate that hypokalemia is common after theophylline intoxication and has a significantly higher incidence after acute overdose. The difference in the frequency of hypokalemia between patients with acute vs chronic intoxication has unclear origins but may be related to the disparities in clinical course (particularly the appearance of seizures and cardiac arrhythmias) that have been observed after acute vs chronic theophylline intoxication.\r"

At the end of the initial year of weight loss, dieters (n = 44) and exercisers (n = 46) were randomly assigned to either an intervention condition, comprising monthly mailed informational packets and monthly to quarterly telephone contacts, or an assessment-only condition. The intervention had a significantly greater impact on weight maintenance in exercisers than it did in dieters. In addition, dieters showed a more variable pattern of weight gain and weight loss during the maintenance year than did exercisers. Based on 7-day food records and a 7-day physical activity recall questionnaire, exercisers reported a greater energy intake and a greater amount of time spent in vigorous activity relative to dieters at both the beginning and the end of the maintenance year. We conclude that exercise is easier to maintain in men using minimal contact strategies than dietary approaches to weight control focusing on modification of energy intake, with subsequent benefits in terms of both overall maintenance and stability of weight.\r"

One particular brand of vinyl examination glove had been used in the medical intensive care unit. Restriction endonuclease mapping established the similarity of employee isolates with one patient isolate of herpes simplex virus type I. When initial viral assay demonstrated 2.5% to 10% penetration of herpes simplex virus type I across unused gloves, an evaluation of glove quality was undertaken. In a 300-mL watertightness test, seven brands of vinyl gloves failed 4% to 28% (average, 11.1%; 132/1200), while seven brands of latex gloves failed 0% to 2.6% (average, 1.4%; 24/1750). The brand of vinyl glove that had been in use in the medical intensive care unit failed 28% of the time. Watertight gloves were then tested for permeability to herpes simplex virus type I. None of the latex gloves failed (n = 1726), while only 10 of the vinyl gloves failed (n = 1068, 0.95%). Extreme variability in glove quality was observed. However, gloves made from intact vinyl may provide similar protectiveness as those made from intact latex. As the demand for gloves increases, emphasis should be placed on the production of plentiful, better quality latex and vinyl gloves.\r"

This study evaluated the effect of age, meals, and time of day on supine and standing blood pressure (BP) and heart rate in healthy young and elderly subjects. A postural BP protocol was performed on 10 young and 16 elderly subjects during an overnight stay. The protocol included first morning and postprandial readings. The systolic and diastolic BP responses to standing were not significantly different between the two groups and were not affected by time of day. Postprandial recumbent BPs declined significantly only in the older subjects. There was no effect of meals on the BP response to standing. We conclude that healthy elderly subjects have a postprandial decline in BP even when supine. However, the BP response to standing is similar in young and elderly subjects and is not impaired by overnight rest or meals. This suggests that the regulation of BP after meals and with standing may be different.\r"

  ".W": "Several agents are available for treatment of Paget's disease of bone, but their long-term use may be limited by resistance or adverse effects. I have treated two patients with exceptionally severe polyostotic Paget's disease (serum alkaline phosphatase values 25- to 30-fold above normal), in whom salmon calcitonin, sodium etidronate, and plicamycin each had become ineffective or could not be used. Pamidronate (3-amino-1-hydroxypropylidene-1,1-bisphosphonate) decreased serum alkaline phosphatase to normal or near-normal values and almost completely relieved symptoms, without recognizable adverse effects, except for transient mild hypocalcemia. The symptomatic and biochemical responses were maintained through 2 years of treatment and for more than 6 months after the treatment was discontinued. Thus, pamidronate can be very effective in severe, resistant cases of Paget's disease. Further study of this potent agent is needed to define the optimum regimen for maximum effectiveness and minimal long-term toxicity.\r"

Extent of improvement and residual deficits in physical and mental impairment and mood and frustration tolerance changes are reported. The impact of these changes upon ability to work and to establish living situations is presented. It was found that long-term outcome is related significantly both to elapsed time between injury and admission to an intensive rehabilitation hospital program and to level of disability at admission. Major problems and needs at follow-up are reported. Thirteen demographic and clinical profile parameters are suggested to permit meaningful comparisons of long-term outcome among different groups of TBI victims.\r"

In the present study of five severely head injured patients and five controls, the effect of vestibular stimulation on reaction times (reflecting attention) and some motor speech parameters (reflecting dysarthria) was investigated. After eight weeks with regular stimulation, it was concluded that reaction time changes were individual and consistent for a given subject. Only occasionally were they shortened after stimulation. However, reaction time was lengthened in three cases, prohibiting further stimulation in one case. Motion sickness was prohibitive in a second case. However, after-stimulation increase of phonation time and/or vital capacity was found in one patient and four controls. Oral diadochokinetic rates were slowed in several cases. Collectively, when stimulation induced changes of reaction times or motor speech parameters, the changes were more pronounced in patients than in controls.\r"

Its purpose is to help clarify the nature and extent of cognitive impairments and to quantify change during recovery. The Barry Rehabilitation Inpatient Screening of Cognition (BRISC) represents an extension downward into the broad range of below-normal functioning. Reliability and validity data, based on 20 head-injured inpatients, and normative data, based on 52 nonpatients are presented. These data indicate that the BRISC is an appropriate instrument for use with its target population.\r"

  ".W": "This study was conducted to determine the intertester reliability of a hand-held dynamometer for the wrist flexor and extensor muscles. Using the break test on 20 healthy subjects, three testers obtained two measures of strength for each muscle group. The data were analyzed using the Pearson product-moment correlation coefficients, intraclass correlations, and an analysis of variance (ANOVA) for repeated measures. Our Pearson product-moment correlations ranged from 0.89 to 0.95 for the intertester reliability of the wrist extensors and 0.90 to 0.93 for the wrist flexors, whereas the intraclass coefficients were 0.91 and 0.85, respectively. Although these correlations were high, ANOVA tests revealed that significant differences existed between testers for both the wrist flexion and extension data (p less than .05). From these results we concluded that although the correlations between testers were good, ANOVA tests suggested that there was limited reliability between testers.\r"

Despite the fact that body cooling and changes in osmolality of bronchial liquid can induce bronchoconstriction, we measured a significant improvement of the lung function parameters: FVC values were 3.22 +/- 0.89 and 3.6 +/- 0.99 before and after the sauna program, respectively. It is concluded that patients with an obstructive pulmonary disease can take part in sauna programs without eliciting bronchoconstriction; sauna even causes transient improvement of the lung function.\r"

Two cases of patients with significant disease subsequent to minor electric burns are presented. In one patient with a 2% superficial partial-thickness burn of the right forearm, nerve conduction studies, electromyography, and somatosensory evoked potential studies were consistent with right median mononeuropathy at the wrist and a distal slowing of the right ulnar nerve. The second patient presented with persistent numbness, hyperpathia, and burning in his left hand after an electric shock in a telephone booth. He had a creatine phosphokinase of 2000m mu/mL but no surface burn. A left stellate ganglion block provided complete resolution of his symptoms and established a diagnosis of minor reflex sympathetic dystrophy.\r"
