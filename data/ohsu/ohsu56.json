The mortality rate was 50%, with most patients dying within the first 2 years after cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) shunting. The prognosis was worse in females than in males. Multiple surgical procedures for shunt obstruction were necessary in half of the patients. Complications such as bacterial meningitis and shunt obstruction were more frequent in the patients who died than in those who survived. The follow-up data revealed that the clinical status was satisfactory in 78% of survivors and unsatisfactory in 22%. Spontaneous remission of the cysticercotic arachnoiditis, as shown by the CSF findings, occurred in only 18% of the cases. In most patients, arachnoiditis and positive immune reactions persisted unchanged even after several years. The results demonstrate the poor outcome of these patients and indicate the need for better medical and surgical therapy.\r"

  ".W": "Sixty-one patients with closed cervical spinal cord injury were cared for within a defined protocol and followed for at least 1 year. Neurological recovery and healing of spinal structures were evaluated at intervals. Forty-three patients were managed without surgical intervention at the site of spine trauma, and the incidence of spontaneous fusion (\"autofusion\") was noted. Surgical fusion was performed on 17 patients, mainly to restore spinal stability and alignment. One patient underwent laminectomy without fusion. In both the surgical fusion and the autofusion groups, there were significant numbers of patients who improved neurologically, including some designated as having a complete spinal cord lesion at the initial neurological examination. As expected, better spinal alignment was achieved in the surgical group, although alignment in the nonsurgically treated group was generally acceptable. The majority of patients developed radiographically apparent callus formation anterior to the injured vertebral bodies, regardless of the mechanism of injury or the method of treatment. After 3 months all patients who underwent surgical fusion achieved spinal stability, as did the majority of patients in the autofusion group. Only individuals with flexion-distraction injuries who did not undergo surgical fusion appeared to be at risk for progressive spinal column deformity. Neither retropulsion of bone fragments nor angulation at the fracture site appeared to correlate with a poor neurological outcome, since improvement in neurological function occurred similarly in patients with and without these deformities.\r"

Estimates of lesion volume based on MRI were frequently greater than with CT; however, MRI disclosed no additional lesions that required surgical evacuation. Neuropsychological assessment during the initial hospitalization revealed deficits in frontal lobe functioning and memory that were related to the size and localization of the lesions as defined by MRI. Follow-up MRI and neuropsychological testing at 1 month (13 cases) and 3 months (six cases) disclosed marked reduction of lesion size paralleled by improvement in cognition and memory. These findings encourage further investigation of the prognostic utility of MRI for the clinical management and rehabilitation of mild or moderate head injury.\r"

  ".W": "The severity of initial brain damage is an important risk factor in determining the prognosis of head trauma. It can be assessed by assigning neurological scores or by determining the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) activity of the isoenzyme creatine kinase-BB (CK-BB). In 10 severely head-injured patients serial CSF samples were obtained during the first 24 hours after trauma, and exponential decay of CK-BB activity with an average half-life of 4.5 hours was demonstrated. This finding led the authors to propose an \"extrapolated\" CK-BB activity, which theoretically occurs immediately after injury and is calculated from a single CK-BB recording, as a new index for assessing the degree of initial brain damage. In 50 patients with severe head injury, the prognostic ability of \"observed\" and \"extrapolated\" CK-BB activity was compared with two clinical scoring systems that evaluate severity of head trauma (the Glasgow and the Glasgow-Liege Coma Scales). \"Extrapolated\" CK-BB activity proved to be the best prognostic factor. With a CK-BB cutoff point of 330 U/liter, a true-positive rate of 79% and a true-negative rate of 73% were obtained. These results suggest the usefulness of measuring CK-BB activity in CSF as soon as possible after hospital admission for head injury.\r"

  ".W": "This study was designed to determine whether implanting shunts in hydrocephalic cats produced the same biomechanical changes as have previously been found in children with shunts. Neuraxis volume-buffering capacity (pressure-volume index: PVI) and the resistance to the absorption of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) were determined before and 3 weeks after placing shunts in 16 hydrocephalic cats. Intracranial pressure (ICP) was monitored for at least 6 hours after the shunts were occluded. The brains were perfused in vivo and removed to assess the size of the ventricles. The mean PVI of the hydrocephalic cats was 3.6 +/- 0.2 ml (+/- standard error of the mean) before the shunts were placed. Three weeks after adequate shunt function was first established, the mean PVI decreased to 1.1 +/- 0.1 ml and was similar to values determined in control animals. Prior to shunt placement, the resistance to the absorption of CSF was 28.4 +/- 4.5 mm Hg/ml/min and did not vary with ICP. This parameter changed after shunting and increased as a function of ICP (r = 0.87, p less than 0.001). At ICP's below 20 mm Hg, the resistance to the absorption of CSF was 65.0 +/- 18.0 mm Hg/ml/min but increased to 220.0 +/- 40.5 mm Hg/ml/min when determined at ICP's above 20 mm Hg. Corroborating evidence for this linkage of resistance to the absorption of CSF to ICP was found in the inexorable rise of ICP during the 6 hours of monitoring after the shunts were occluded. After shunt placement, the ventricles were normal in size in 12 cats and slightly enlarged in four. The biomechanical profile and pressure response to shunt occlusion in this laboratory model resembles that previously described in shunt-dependent children. As in humans, shunt placement in hydrocephalic cats results in normalization of the PVI and a linkage of the resistance to the absorption of CSF to ICP. The significance of these changes as they relate to shunt dependency is discussed.\r"

  ".W": "The common carotid, femoral, and middle cerebral arteries in the rat have been occluded thrombotically by means of a rose bengal dye-sensitized photochemical reaction initiated in vascular endothelium by the 514.5-nm beam of an argon laser, focused for maximum excitation efficiency of the photosensitizer according to a derived criterion. The total energy required for vessel occlusion was approximately 1 joule (J) for the middle cerebral artery and 140 to 180 J for the femoral and carotid arteries. At energy fluences (energy deposited per unit area) of 3.5 kJ/sq cm for the middle cerebral artery and 35 kJ/sq cm for the larger arteries, occlusion was observed within 3 minutes. The middle cerebral artery thrombus consisted entirely of aggregated platelets; in the larger arteries the thrombi were composed of platelet aggregates and groups of red blood cells interspersed within a matrix of coagulum. Vessels irradiated similarly in the absence of rose bengal dye displayed no morphological or functional damage. Because the photochemical reaction is mediated by electronic-state transitions, the process of photothrombosis (as opposed to photocoagulation) can be initiated in vessels with high flow rates without the requirement of increased temperature. The photothrombotic technique may be useful in the treatment of arteriovenous malformations owing to its significant enhancement of the efficiency and permanency of vessel occlusion.\r"

  ".W": "The purpose of this study was to determine in subhuman primates whether hemodynamic mechanisms (as compared with embolic mechanisms) contribute to cerebral ischemia following carotid artery occlusion or stenosis. Following carotid artery occlusion there was loss of cerebral autoregulation: cerebral blood flow (CBF) measured with the xenon-133 technique became passively dependent upon the mean arterial blood pressure (MABP) over an MABP range of 30 to 110 mm Hg. By contrast, autoregulation was preserved in normal animals and in animals with a 90% carotid artery stenosis. Regional CBF was measured with carbon-14-labeled iodoantipyrine autoradiography in normotensive baboons, in hypotensive animals, and in hypotensive animals with carotid artery occlusion or stenosis. With carotid artery occlusion and hypotension, reduced levels of local CBF were seen ipsilaterally in the boundary zones between the anterior and middle cerebral arteries with 35% of the area of an anterior section through the hemisphere displaying a CBF value of less than 20 ml/100 gm/min. Comparable values with hypotension were 21% with carotid artery stenosis, 20% with no proximal vascular lesion, and 1% in normotensive animals. These areas of reduced CBF corresponded with areas of boundary-zone ischemia seen with light microscopy. The study suggests that while hemodynamic ischemia develops with carotid artery occlusion, it does not occur with even a 90% carotid artery stenosis or in normal animals.\r"

Some of the management problems commonly encountered with these tumors are discussed. Many of these tumors are associated with severe hydrocephalus at the time of diagnosis, and the perioperative management of this hydrocephalus remains a matter of some debate. The timing of and the necessity for shunting are major considerations. Large subdural fluid collections are often discovered in the postoperative period, and these occasionally cause symptoms of increased intracranial pressure. Reasons for this problem are suggested and possible steps for its prevention are proposed. The similarity between papillary ependymomas and choroid plexus papillomas has sometimes caused difficulty in pathological diagnosis. Choroid plexus carcinomas, of which there were two in this series, also present a diagnostic challenge. Differential diagnosis affects the further treatment and prognosis for the patient.\r"

Concentrations of GH were elevated preoperatively in all subjects and could not be suppressed during oral glucose tolerance testing. Somatomedin-C concentrations were elevated in two patients. Immunocytochemical studies of surgically obtained tumor tissue demonstrated sparse positive staining for GH in all subjects. Gel-chromatographic analysis of serum and tumor tissue samples demonstrated that the immunoactive GH was authentic GH. On pathological examination, the tumor was cellular in all cases, consisting of partly acidophilic and partly chromophobic cells. Electron microscopic analysis of one tumor showed a cell composition not previously described.

Seventeen of the 22 patients were aged 6 months or younger; five patients were aged 3 to 23 years. Patients in the younger group presented with stridor, apnea, and/or feeding difficulty; those in the older group presented with hemiparesis, quadriparesis, oscillopsia, nystagmus, or opisthotonos. Fourteen of the 17 younger patients underwent surgical decompression of the Arnold-Chiari malformation: 10 within 18 days following the onset of symptoms and four on Day 19 or later. Of the 10 infants with early treatment, five eventually died secondary to continued symptoms and five survived. Of those surviving, three were asymptomatic and two had continuing symptoms but were improved over their preoperative state. Among the four patients undergoing surgery later, two died, one had lessening of stridor, and one had complete relief of symptoms. Of the three infants not undergoing decompression, two died and one eventually became asymptomatic. All five of the older patients underwent decompression and all had complete resolution of their preoperative symptoms and signs. The authors conclude that while decompression of a symptomatic Arnold-Chiari malformation may be effective in children and adults, this treatment does not always improve the clinical condition of infants. This may be the result of ischemic/hypoxic effects on the infant's brain stem, which may not be organized normally at birth.\r"

The patients included 40 men and 24 women, with a mean age of 64 years (range 32 to 87 years). Correlation of angiographic findings with outcome revealed that of the 27 patients with severe stenosis, usually with delay in blood flow, 25 (93%) were the same or improved postoperatively; of the 11 patients with stenosis and an intraluminal filling defect (six of whom had an intraluminal clot), eight (73%) were the same or improved after surgery; of the 16 patients with complete occlusion, 14 (88%) were the same or improved (backflow was established in all cases); and of the 10 patients with moderate to severe stenosis and/or severe ulceration (including three with transient ischemic attacks who were receiving heparin), eight (80%) were the same or improved. Pre- and postoperative clinical status were graded into five categories: intact; mild deficit; moderate deficit (significant impairment but able to perform activities of daily living); severe deficit (requiring assistance for daily activities); and death. Of the 36 patients who preoperatively were intact or had mild deficits, 33 (92%) were the same or improved postoperatively, three were worse, and there were no deaths. Among 15 patients presenting with moderate deficits, 12 (80%) were the same or improved, two were worse, and one died. Of the 13 patients with severe deficits, 10 (77%) were the same or improved and three died. Two patients with sudden severe deficits associated with loss of contralateral bruit were operated on without angiography and were intact postoperatively. Of the four deaths in the total series, two were attributed to cardiac causes and two to unrelated disease processes. The indications for emergency carotid endarterectomy are discussed.\r"

  ".W": "Serial measurements of cerebral blood flow (CBF) were performed in 56 patients before and one to four times after uncomplicated carotid endarterectomy. The findings were related to the ratio between internal carotid artery (ICA) and common carotid artery (CCA) mean pressures. Within the 1st postoperative day CBF increased by a median of 37% in the ipsilateral and 33% in the contralateral hemisphere. Later recordings showed a gradual return of CBF toward the preoperative level. Sixteen patients with an ICA/CCA pressure ratio below 0.7 showed a significantly more pronounced and longer-lasting flow increase than did 40 patients with a ratio above this level. On Day 1, the median CBF increase in the ipsilateral hemisphere was 61% and 24% in the two groups, respectively (p less than 0.01). A significant improvement in side-to-side asymmetry, resulting from a higher gain in the ipsilateral hemisphere, occurred in the low pressure ratio group, while the hemispheric asymmetry on average was unchanged in the high pressure ratio group. This relative hyperemia was most pronounced 2 to 4 days following reconstruction. The marked hyperemia, absolute as well as relative, in patients with a low ICA/CCA pressure ratio suggests a temporary impairment of autoregulation. Special care should be taken to avoid postoperative hypertension in such patients, who typically have preoperative hypoperfusion, to avoid the occurrence of cerebral edema or hemorrhage.\r"

Six lesions were intramedullary, five were dural, and one was in a posterior extramedullary location. Serpentine filling defects similar to the classic myelographic findings were demonstrated within the high-signal cerebrospinal fluid on T2-weighted coronal scans. The intramedullary nidus was identified by MRI as an area of low-signal intensity within the cord in all six intramedullary AVM's. Neither the dural nor the posterior extramedullary lesions showed intramedullary components. It is concluded that MRI may noninvasively provide the initial diagnosis of a spinal AVM and distinguish intramedullary from dural and extramedullary lesions.\r"

Six patients with intractable lower-extremity pain due to avulsion of nerve roots from the conus medullaris were treated by thoracolumbar laminectomy and dorsal root entry zone (DREZ) lesions. Patients with avulsion of lumbosacral roots from the conus medullaris have a characteristic clinical presentation. They are usually young men who, as a result of a motorcycle accident, have suffered multiple pelvic or long-bone fractures or traumatic amputation of part of the lower extremity. Early in their course there is pain not directly attributable to the injured part. The pain is described as intense and burning, with episodic radiation and electric shock-like sensations in the injured or phantom limb. If the leg is intact, there is usually a dermatomal pattern to the distribution of the pain and neurological deficit. A myelogram often reveals a traumatic pseudomeningocele similar to those seen in the cervical region after avulsion of the brachial plexus. Surgical exploration of the conus medullaris usually reveals the extent of nerve root avulsion, and an appropriate DREZ operation can be performed.\r"

Symptomatic tandem spinal stenosis (TSS) is characterized by the triad of intermittent neurogenic claudication, progressive gait disturbance, and findings of mixed myelopathy and polyradiculopathy in both the upper and lower extremities. Nineteen patients with clinically symptomatic and myelographically proven disease were studied retrospectively. Surgical intervention was directed at decompression of the stenotic lesions in both the cervical and lumbar regions. The most symptomatic level was usually treated first. After a mean follow-up period of 22 months, an excellent outcome was obtained in five patients (26%), four improved (21%), five deteriorated despite initial improvement (26%), and one was unchanged. Three patients could not be traced for follow-up review, and there was one postoperative death. Postoperative improvement correlated inversely with symptom duration. Sphincter disturbance, radiculopathy, myelography, cerebrospinal fluid analysis, and electrophysiological data were not prognostically significant. The presentation of TSS mimics amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and other forms of motor-neuron disease. In contrast to these conditions, however, TSS is amenable to treatment. Operative sequence and technique could not be related to outcome. Functional recovery in TSS depends on early diagnosis and timely surgical intervention.\r"

  ".W": "Because of the central role of the sympathetic nervous system in mediating the stress response, plasma norepinephrine (NE), epinephrine (E), and dopamine (DA) levels were measured in 61 traumatically brain-injured patients to determine whether catecholamine (CA) levels obtained within 48 hours after injury provide reliable prognostic markers of outcome. Patient outcome was determined at 1 week using the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) and at the time of discharge using the Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS). Levels of NE, E, and DA correlated highly with the admission GCS score (NE: r = 0.58, p less than 0.0001; E: r = 0.46, p less than 0.0025; DA: r = 0.27, p less than 0.04). Moreover, in the 21 patients with GCS scores of 3 or 4 on admission, NE levels predicted outcome at 1 week. All six patients with NE levels less than 900 pg/ml (normal level less than 447 pg/ml) improved to GCS scores of greater than 11, while 12 of 15 with NE values greater than 900 pg/ml remained with GCS scores of 3 to 6 or died. Levels of E and DA were not as useful. Catecholamine levels also increased significantly as the GOS score worsened. Levels of NE and E were significantly higher in patients who died or remained persistently vegetative than in those with better outcomes. In the 54 patients who survived beyond 1 week, significant correlations were present between the length of hospitalization and NE (r = 0.71, p less than 0.0001) and E (r = 0.61, p less than 0.0001) levels. Concentrations of NE (r = 0.61, p less than 0.0004) and E (r = 0.48, p less than 0.01) were also highly correlated with the duration of ventilatory assistance. Analysis of the interactions of CA levels and GCS scores, duration of ventilatory assistance, and length of hospitalization revealed that the CA's either enhanced the reliability of the GCS score or were independent predictors of outcome. Thus, these findings indicate that alterations in circulating CA levels reflect the severity of the neurological insult and provide support for the use of CA measurements as a physiological marker of patient outcome in both the acute and chronic phases of traumatic brain injury.\r"

This was accomplished by first characterizing the temporal course of CSF formation and outflow resistance during the 5-day period postinjury. The CSF formation and outflow resistance were obtained from pressure responses to bolus addition and removal of fluid from an indwelling ventricular catheter. The vascular contribution to the level of ICP was assessed by withdrawing fluid at its rate of formation and observing the resultant change in equilibrium ICP level. It was found that, with the exception of patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage, CSF parameters accounted for approximately one-third of the ICP rise after severe head injury, and that a vascular mechanism may be the predominant factor in elevation of ICP.\r"

  ".W": "Systems analysis of intracranial pressure pulse waveforms was carried out in six dogs under conditions of normocapnia and intracranial normotension to determine how the pressure pulse is transmitted through the intracranial cavity. Since the intracranial cavity can be regarded as a system, systems analysis was applied to it. The pressure pulse wave of the common carotid artery was used as the input signal and the epidural pressure pulse wave as the output signal. An attempt was made to randomize the input signal using a cardiac pacemaker or an aorta balloon. The transfer function of the system was estimated numerically from the autocorrelation function of the input signal and the cross-correlation function of the input and output signals by means of the least-squares method. Some characteristics of pressure transmission through the system were observed. The gain curve of the system decreased between 1 and 7 Hz, then suddenly increased to form a marked peak at about 10 to 15 Hz, where the phase curve also changed from positive to negative. These results suggest that the lower frequencies of the pulse wave were suppressed during transmission through the intracranial cavity, whereas the greatest acceleration in transmission occurred at about 10 to 15 Hz. In addition, resonance was evident in the intracranial cavity under normal intracranial conditions. This is the first report of such resonance.\r"

  ".W": "The effect of subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) on endothelium-dependent vasodilation of the isolated rabbit basilar artery was examined using an isometric tension recording method. The SAH was induced by injecting 5 ml of fresh arterial blood into the cisterna magna. Sixty-two rabbits were separated into four groups according to the timing of sacrifice: control rabbits, and operated rabbits sacrificed on Days 2, 4, and 6 after SAH. Acetylcholine (ACh) (10(-7) M to 10(-4) M) and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) (10(-7) M to 10(-4) M) were used to evoke dose-dependent vasodilation of isolated arterial rings previously contracted by 10(-6) M serotonin (5-HT). There were no significant differences in the vasodilatory response to ACh among these four groups. Relaxation to approximately 84% of the initial contractile tone occurred with 10(-4) M ACh. On the other hand, the vasodilatory response to ATP was suppressed in the animals sacrificed 2 days after SAH; the relaxation of this group was approximately 52% at 10(-4) M ATP, compared to a relaxation of 87% observed in the other groups of animals. One of the major causes of the impairment of endothelium-dependent vasodilation seems to be an inhibition of the production of endothelium-derived relaxing factor by endothelial cells. After the relaxation studies, the dose-response curves for 5-HT were obtained. Serotonin caused significantly more contraction in the animals sacrificed 2 days after SAH than in the other groups. The present experiments suggest that impairment of the endothelium-dependent vasodilation following SAH, together with the potentiation of the contractile response to vasoactive agents in cerebral arteries, may play an important role in the pathogenesis of vasospasm.\r"

PCS findings were characterized in terms of localization, appearance, and homogeneity of abnormal radionuclide accumulation. Thus, metastatic cancer manifested as diffusely or focally homogeneous accumulation within the vertebral body or as a typical short-segmental accumulation along the end-plate, whereas compression fracture manifested as characteristic board-like accumulation along the entire length of end-plates. Tuberculous spondylitis, on the other hand, revealed homogeneous accumulation throughout the vertebral body, and pyogenic spondylitis revealed accumulation at the end-zone of opposing vertebral bodies giving sandwich-like appearance. The disk space at the affected level was not narrowed in the former two diseases but it was narrowed in the latter two. It was concluded that PCS may be useful in differentiating metastatic cancer, compression fracture, tuberculous spondylitis, and pyogenic spondylitis.\r"

The scintigraphic findings were evaluated for severity of lesions by extent of the visualized bone response, ranging from ill-defined cortical lesions with slightly increased activity (I) to well-defined intramedullary transcortical lesions with intensely increased activity (IV). Bone scintigraphies using [99mTc]MDP were obtained in 310 military recruits suspected of having stress fractures. In 235 patients, 391 stress fractures were diagnosed. Forty percent of the lesions were asymptomatic. Most of the lesions were in the tibiae (72%), and 87% of the patients had one or two lesions, while 13% had three to five lesions. Eighty-five percent of the lesions were classified as mild and showed early and more complete resolution on follow-up studies after treatment as compared to the severe grades. Furthermore, specific scintigraphic patterns have been introduced for distinguishing inflammatory shin-splints from stress fractures, allowing for their appropriate early treatment. Thus, early recognition of mild stress fracture scintigraphic patterns representing the beginning of pathologic bone response to stress enabled a prompt and effective treatment to prevent progression of lesions, protracted disability, and complications.\r"

In this study, bone scintigraphy was carried out in 15 patients with proven HPT (primary and secondary in patients with chronic renal disease) and 25 normal subjects, to evaluate quantitatively increased bone metabolism. The count density ratios bone to soft tissue (D/S-index) were calculated. In normal, this D/S index averaged 3.66 +/- 0.94 and was significantly (p less than 0.001) different to that of HPT-patients averaging 6.37 +/- 1.64. The quantitative evaluation shows a sensitivity of 73%, a specificity of 100% and an accuracy of 90% for detecting HPT (based on the sample values). Discriminant analysis can be applied to calculate the probability of the presence of HPT (primary and secondary) as a function of the measured D/S index.\r"

  ".W": "An alternative method of estimating the lumped constant (LC) in the deoxyglucose model was developed. The LC was estimated using data obtained during the first 10 min after injection of the tracer by a nonlinear least-squares (NLSQ) method. The method does not require a constant plasma concentration. This approach was evaluated in a computer simulation by adding different levels of noise and considering various input functions. Errors in the estimated LC in this and Sokoloff et al.'s conventional method were compared. We found that the approach proposed here results in more reliable estimates of LC. The study in completed in a shorter experimental period, and any shape of the input function can be used. The new technique was then applied to measure whole brain LC and rate constants in cat brain for 2-[18F]fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (2-[18F]FDG). Measured mean value (+/-s.e.m.) for the whole brain LC = 0.443 +/- 0.012 (N = 7), for the whole brain k2* = 0.124 +/- 0.009 and k3* = 0.024 +/- 0.001 (N = 7).\r"

LCBF values for DDC, IMP, and IAP were measured using simultaneous multiple radionuclide autoradiography and quantitative digital image analysis. Patterns of local cerebral blood flow (LCBF) obtained with DDC were intermediate compared to IMP and IAP, although they were more similar to those of IMP. DDC and IMP underestimated LCBF in some white matter and adjacent structures, while IAP underestimated LCBF values in high flow regions. We conclude that DDC uptake generally reflects local cerebral blood flow and that it can therefore be used as a cerebral perfusion tracer in humans using SPECT imaging.\r"

Rabbit studies confirmed the [153Sm]EDTMP results obtained in rats. Blood clearance in rabbits was found to be more rapid than [99mTc] methylene diphosphonate (MDP). Scintigraphic images were virtually indistinguishable from [99mTc]MDP images. Lesion/normal bone ratios were determined from digitized images obtained using a drill hole model and found to be approximately 17:1. Based on these excellent biodistribution characteristics, [153Sm] EDTMP could be therapeutically useful in treating metastatic bone cancer.\r"

The travelers consisted of both Americans arriving home after business or vacation and European nationals visiting relatives in the Boston area. For purposes of dosimetry the population was divided into three subpopulations--adult (greater than 18 yr old), children (less than or equal to 18 yr old), and two individuals, 17 and 26 wk pregnant. Seventy-four percent of the population had detectable quantities of 131I thyroid burdens, ranging from 1 nCi (37 Bq) to 900 nCi (33,300 Bq). The highest adult radiation dose equivalent was 5.18 mrem (51.8 mSv). The children, however, had considerably higher dose equivalents with one infant receiving 37 rem (370 mSv). Several other children were above 1 rem (10 mSv). The fetal dose equivalents were less than 14 mrem (140 mu Sv). The presence of rain dominated those testing positive for 131I. Radioactive fallout from the Chernobyl accident contaminated a wide range of Europe and a large population subsequently ingested radioactivity. The children exhibited the highest thyroid radiation dose equivalents of the individuals monitored in the present study. The significance of this is presently unknown.\r"

Five cases showed the \"classic\" scintigraphic pattern of caudate lobe hypertrophy (62.5%), and other abnormalities observed included segmental hepatic insufficiency, diffuse hepatic insufficiency, and relative hypertrophy of both the caudate lobe and a portion of the parenchyma of segment VI (one case each). An experimental study of hepatic venous drainage performed on livers at autopsy revealed four groups of accessory hepatic veins in addition to the main hepatic veins. The occlusion of various parts of this drainage appears to relate to the various scintigraphic patterns that were encountered in patients with Budd-Chiari syndrome. A review of the literature revealed three additional patterns previously reported in association with Budd-Chiari syndrome (normal scan, diffuse hepatomegaly, and multiple filling defects). If all these variations are appreciated, liver scanning can be a valuable screening tool for Budd-Chiari syndrome and may also serve as a noninvasive means of follow-up.\r"

Quantitation of RES included calculation of percent emptying at 30 sec, and standard manometric measurements were obtained. RES and manometry were performed before and 10 min following the i.v. administration of metoclopramide. RES showed a significant increase in mean percent emptying from 36% to 46% after drug administration (p less than 0.01), while mean lower esophageal pressure (end-expiratory) increased from 2 to 11 mm of Hg (p less than 0.001). Manometry failed to reveal a significant increase in either distal or proximal mean esophageal contractile amplitude, and no correlation was found between the increase in percent emptying at RES and the change in lower esophageal pressure in the individual patient. RES is the only quantitative method presently available to evaluate bolus propagation in the esophagus, and it documented improved esophageal function after metoclopramide administration in a PSS population. When drug therapy is directed at augmentation of esophageal emptying, RES is an ideal method to evaluate drug response.\r"

Data were accumulated at 5 min intervals to obtain the gastric emptying time (GET). The results of the studies were divided into three categories: prolonged, 13 patients; rapid, 11; and normal 3. Twelve of 13 patients with prolonged GET were given 10 mg metoclopramide i.v. injections; nine of the 12 patients had a good response and three had no response. Five of the nine patients underwent metoclopramide therapy and four of the patients showed benefit from the therapy. One patient discontinued metoclopramide therapy because of somnolence. Although all patients had subjective symptoms of gastric dysfunction, our results indicated only 50% had objectively prolonged GET, and another 50% showed normal or even rapid GET. Therefore, this radionuclide study enables quantitatively objective documentation of gastric emptying, separation of those patients with rapid or normal GET from those with prolonged GET, thereby avoiding the possible side effects from metoclopramide medication, and prediction of effectiveness of metoclopramide therapy in patients with prolonged GET.\r"

When an inappropriate young control group was compared with coronary disease patients aged 40-65 yr, large differences in peak filling rate were seen. Sensitivity for detection of disease was very low (0%-9%) except when the inappropriate young control group was used. Thus, analysis of rapid diastolic filling cannot detect individual patients with coronary disease who have normal LV ejection fractions.

Group I had severe, resting myocardial ischemia induced by coronary occlusion, followed in 2 min by [Gd]DTPA infusion and heart excision 1 min later. Group II had a variable reduction in blood flow. In Group II the coronary vasodilator dipyridamole was infused to enhance blood flow to the normal myocardium before [Gd]DTPA was given. In Group I [Gd]DTPA caused a significant difference in T1 between the normal and severely ischemic zones; changes in T1 correlated with the severity of myocardial ischemia. Although vasodilatation delivered more Gd-DTPA to the normal myocardium in Group II, the lack of further decrease in T1 suggested that it was cleared more rapidly. Thus, [Gd]DTPA permits the detection and characterization of severe, resting myocardial ischemia by magnetic resonance techniques. Using the experimental techniques described in this study, less severe flow differences caused by vasodilatation and resultant hyperemia are not detected.\r"

In Group C hearts (n = 8) only 201Tl uptake was determined at control and following coronary reperfusion. Myocardial 201Tl and 83Rb transport were not significantly different and were proportional to flow. Although all interventions caused significant hemodynamic alterations, neither tracer was affected by hypoxia at constant flow. Thallium-201 permeation, however, was transiently decreased immediately after coronary reperfusion.

Both left atrial-aortic and left ventricular-aortic bypass improve survival up to 6 hr after acute coronary occlusion, compared with control animals. The initial measurement of left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) following occlusion appears predictive of the need for ventricular assistance. Assisted animals maintain their level of left ventricular function until 6 hr in contrast with control animals, whose function steadily deteriorates over this period. There was no demonstrable recovery in regional ventricular function in the infarcted territory over this period, and in all assisted animals the right ventricular function deteriorated more rapidly than in controls. These results demonstrate the efficacy of left ventricular assistance in terms of improved survival and preserved left ventricular function. Gated blood-pool ventriculography has also been shown to be a suitable technique for monitoring the physiological changes during left ventricular assistance.\r"

Goals of the investigator have been to discover why drugs cause nutrient depletion and how drugs influence nutrient requirements. The investigator justifies the need to develop special animal models in order to solve specific problems related to drug-nutrient interactions and to link biochemical changes produced by drugs to pathology.\r"

Adequate nutrition will be essential for maintaining crew health, effectiveness and morale. Although much is known from prior space experience about in-flight metabolism, nutrition and associated food technology, important gaps in knowledge exist that need additional research, development and analysis to meet Space Station requirements. This paper is a synopsis of a report prepared by the Life Sciences Research Office (LSRO), FASEB, from a study of the nutritional and metabolic aspects of spaceflight. It reviews available data on the metabolic responses to spaceflight including extravehicular activity, physiological responses to microgravity that influence metabolism and energy needs, in-flight nutritional experience, space menus, food packaging, in-flight food service methodology, water supply and disposal of food wastes. The LSRO ad hoc Working Group identified critical gaps in knowledge and suggested corresponding research approaches for acquiring essential new data. The 38 research suggestions detailed in the report address in-flight metabolic needs, nutrient requirements, food systems and nutritional countermeasures.\r"

Effects of nutritional state and of a high fat diet (90 g/kg) were examined. Different classes of liver lipids were also measured. Fed birds exhibited enhanced hepatic lipogenesis, which was more pronounced in FL than in LL birds (+73%, mean of three experiments). Extrahepatic lipogenesis was poorly influenced by nutritional state in LL birds and not modified in FL ones. The high fat diet induced a fall in liver triacylglycerol and reduced de novo lipogenesis more drastically in liver than in carcass of both lines. Reduction of carcass lipogenesis was less pronounced in FL than in LL. Starvation led to a fall in liver triacylglycerols, nonesterified fatty acids and free cholesterol. The fat diet had similar but less pronounced effects. In most circumstances FL chickens exhibited a higher liver triacylglycerol content than LL ones. Comparison of fed and refed birds 100 min after the beginning of refeeding showed that de novo lipogenesis did not reach a plateau and differences between lines were still not significant.\r"

  ".W": "Levels of retinol-binding protein (RBP) and transthyretin (TTR) were determined in rat maternal livers, placenta, yolk sac, whole fetuses and fetal livers at different stages of gestation. Yolk sac concentrations of RBP and TTR expressed as micrograms per mg protein were three- to fivefold higher than liver values. TTR (moles) in the whole fetus was higher than RBP at all stages of gestation. Fetal hepatic RBP concentration was relatively constant throughout gestation, where fetal hepatic TTR concentration was low until close to parturition. RBP was observed in fetal microsomes at 12 d gestation. Incorporation of labeled amino acids into both RBP and TTR in vitro was observed in the yolk sac. In the 20-d fetal liver, incorporation to RBP and TTR was observed, whereas at 14 d gestation, incorporation only to RBP was observed. A small amount of synthesis of both proteins was also observed in the placenta. In the fetal circulation at 20-21 d gestation, no TTR-RBP complex was observed; instead a broad peak of RBP was found eluting at 20,000-40,000 daltons on gel chromatography. Incubation of fetal serum with maternal TTR resulted in an RBP peak eluting with an Mr of approximately 40,000. Treatment of the fetal serum with either lysozyme, neuraminidase or endoglycosidase H resulted in a 20,000 dalton RBP peak and following incubation with maternal TTR, a 70,000 dalton RBP-TTR complex was formed. Yolk sac, fetal liver and amniotic fluid on gel filtration exhibited a 40,000-20,000 dalton RBP peak. It is suggested that retinol transport in the fetus may involve RBP and TTR synthesized in the yolk sac as well as in fetal tissue.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The heart pantothenate levels of ethanol-fed rats were 51-78% of that in controls. The heart total CoA levels of ethanol-fed rats were 78-90% of that in controls. Liver total CoA and pantothenate levels were lower in ethanol-fed rats than in controls in one and two studies, respectively. Differences were diminished in rats fasted for 24 h. Control and chronic ethanol-treated rats given no ethanol for 24 h were intubated with [1-14C]pantothenate. Accumulation of radioactive pantothenate in hearts of ethanol-treated rats was 58% and accumulation in livers was 75% of that in controls. An acute effect of ethanol on pantothenate conversion to CoA in liver was found in naive rats intubated with 0.5-2.5 g ethanol/kg body weight and given [1-14C]pantothenate by intubation or intraperitoneal injection. In ethanol-treated rats, conversion of [1-14C]pantothenate to CoA was 4-28% of that in controls. These studies demonstrated an effect of chronic ethanol ingestion on pantothenate and total CoA contents of heart and possibly other tissues and an acute effect of ethanol ingestion on [1-14C]pantothenate conversion to CoA in liver.\r"

  ".W": "Studies were conducted to determine the relationship between dietary vitamin E (VE) and the development of nutritional pancreatic atrophy (NPA) in selenium (Se)-deficient chicks. Selenium- and VE-depleted chicks reared on a low Se, amino acid-based diet containing 100 IU VE (as all-rac-alpha-tocopheryl acetate) per kilogram were found to have exceedingly low pancreatic activities of Se-dependent glutathione peroxidase (SeGSHpx) at 8 d of age. Supplementation of the purified diet with 500 or 1,000 IU VE/kg prevented both NPA and the associated growth depression. Use of graded dietary VE levels showed that addition of at least 300 IU/kg was required to overcome the growth depression associated with severe Se deficiency. Although tissue alpha-tocopherol concentrations increased linearly with increasing dietary levels of VE, the response in pancreas was less than (about one-half of) those in liver and heart and, unlike the response in heart, was not affected by dietary Se level. That protection against NPA involved the antioxidant action of VE was suggested by results showing that NPA is promoted by high dietary levels of linoleic acid, that high VE levels correct membrane unsaturated fatty acid losses due to Se deficiency and that NPA is prevented by high levels of other antioxidants. It is suggested that the normally low activities of SeGSHpx and concentrations of alpha-tocopherol in the pancreas may predispose that organ to lesions due to oxidative stress under conditions of severe nutritional Se deficiency that results in further depletion of SeGSHpx. This situation may be overcome by feeding VE at 15-20-fold excesses over the levels normally regarded as nutritionally required.\r"

Two rats from each dietary group were placed in metabolic cages and urine was collected in the dark for 24 h. On the fourth week, a third animal from each group received an i.p. injection of [2-14C]riboflavin before being placed in a metabolic cage and urine collected in the dark for 48 h. Urine samples were extracted with phenol for flavin components and with chloroform for lumichrome and derivatives. Riboflavin was the predominant flavin excreted by rats in all dietary groups, followed by hydroxymethylriboflavins and smaller amounts of flavin mononucleotide (FMN), lumiflavin and 10-hydroxyethylflavin. Carboxylumichromes accounted for 5-10% of the total flavin-derived fluorescence in urine of rats fed 2 and 6 micrograms riboflavin/g diet and were reduced to approximately 3% when sulfathiazole was added to the base diets. Carboxylumichromes were absent from urine of riboflavin-deficient rats. Riboflavin accounted for 85-90% of the recovered radioactivity of all radioactive urine extracts; no radioactively labeled carboxylumichromes were detected. These results indicate that hydroxymethylriboflavins are primary catabolites of riboflavin derived from tissue microsomal oxidations, whereas carboxylumichromes reflect the continued oxidation of ring hydroxymethyl functions plus gut microbial cleavage of the side chain of flavin.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of starvation and refeeding of 2-wk-old turkey poults on serum and tissue levels of zinc, copper and iron were investigated. Serum concentrations of zinc and copper declined during 4 d of starvation. Refeeding for 24 h following a period of starvation restored serum copper to levels similar to those in the fed controls but failed to elevate zinc levels. Liver concentrations and total quantities of zinc, copper and iron increased throughout starvation. Refeeding the starved poults reduced hepatic metal concentrations but caused a further increase in total metal content. This was apparently related to the large increase in liver mass, and the effect was most pronounced in poults starved 1 d prior to refeeding. Starvation also caused an increased zinc concentration and content and a reduced copper content in the pancreas, duodenal mucosa and kidney. Iron content of the pancreas and kidney increased during starvation, but that of the duodenal mucosa declined. Starvation evoked a progressive increase in the cytosolic zinc concentration from liver, pancreas, duodenal mucosa and kidney. A major part of this increase was accounted for as zinc bound to metallothionein (MT). Refeeding rapidly reduced cytosolic and MT-bound zinc in each of these tissues. It was concluded that starvation and refeeding had major effects on tissue trace metal status. A function is proposed for MT during starvation as a mechanism for the conservation of body zinc stores. Zinc, released as a consequence of tissue catabolism, is repartitioned into a soluble storage site (MT), which can be rapidly mobilized to meet the demands of new tissue synthesis once anabolic metabolism resumes.\r"

After 6 wk, rats fed the lowest magnesium-containing diets had significant reductions of plasma and femur magnesium. Higher dietary fluoride prevented accumulation of calcium in the kidneys of magnesium-deficient rats. Rats fed the lowest magnesium-containing diets had significantly more fluoride in their femurs and molar teeth than other groups at both levels of fluoride, whereas rats fed diets containing 5 times normal magnesium had less fluoride in their femurs and molars. The magnitude of the magnesium effect was considerably greater in rats fed diets containing 10 ppm fluoride compared to 2 ppm, indicating a highly significant, level-dependent interaction between magnesium and fluoride. Five-day metabolic studies conducted during wk 3 and 6 showed that low dietary magnesium significantly enhanced fluoride absorption, whereas high dietary magnesium significantly reduced fluoride absorption. Fluoride retention values simply reflected absorptive changes, which indicates that the site of the interaction between magnesium and fluoride is at the intestinal level, most likely involving insoluble complex formation.\r"

Rats were made moderately anemic (Hb 7.8 +/- 0.7 g/dL) by feeding an iron-deficient diet and were then fed one of the 16 experimental diets. Test meals (100 micrograms Fe) labeled with 59Fe were fed after 5 d and 59Fe absorption determined by whole-body counting. Rats were killed after 5 wk and liver Fe, final Hb and delta Hb were determined. Nonheme iron was better absorbed than heme iron regardless of other dietary factors. Both heme iron absorption and nonheme iron absorption were higher when high (30%) rather than low (5%) dietary fat was fed. The type of fat had no effect. Rats fed both nonheme and heme iron had significantly higher Hb, delta Hb and liver iron when fed coconut oil, compared to safflower oil.

In contrast, weight gains were markedly reduced compared to those with the basal diet; that is, growth was inhibited, when the supplement was soy protein or gluten that had been heated at 200 or 215 degrees C for 72 min in the dry state to stimulate crust baking. Addition of various carbohydrates to the gluten during heating prevented such growth inhibition. After heating with sodium ascorbate (but not L-ascorbic acid), soy protein (at 200 degrees C) and gluten (at 215 degrees C) completely prevented growth when added to the basal diet. Growth inhibition also occurred with a heated casein-ascorbate mixture, but was less than with the other proteins. The extent of growth inhibition increased sharply with temperature of heating in the range 180-215 degrees C and with sodium ascorbate concentration in the range 1-20%. Possible physical and chemical changes during heating of protein-ascorbate mixtures are discussed, as are possible mechanisms for the growth inhibition.\r"

In a 2 X 3 X 3 multifactorial trial with a niacin-free basal diet, the effects of 15 g/kg supplementary leucine were compared with isonitrogenous glycine supplements. Half of the diets were also marginally deficient in pyridoxine and resulted in slower growth, but no interactive effect with leucine. The leucine supplement depressed excretion of N1-methylnicotinamide only in the groups receiving supplementary tryptophan. It was also associated with a depression in the level of nicotinamide nucleotides in the rats' livers that was not eliminated by addition of either 25 mg/kg nicotinic acid or 1 g/kg L-tryptophan. The existence of pellagra in Hyderabad, India, has been hypothesized to result from excessive leucine in the diet rather than from a deficiency of niacin/tryptophan. Neither our results with rats nor those of others appear to provide support for this hypothesis.\r"

Metabolic inhibitors (antimycin A, 2,4-dinitrophenol) had no effect, so uptake is not energy dependent. Ouabain and N-ethylmaleimide, inhibitors of cation gradients, had no effect on biotin uptake, thus showing the absence of cotransport. The inhibition of uptake by analogs of biotin, that is, biocytin and DL-thioctic acid, indicates that the terminal carboxyl group and the thiophane ring play a role in the recognition of biotin. Counterflow experiments showed competitive inhibition of efflux when excess biotin was present in the cells. These findings are consistent with biotin uptake by isolated hamster enterocytes being a process of facilitated diffusion.\r"

Similarly, the arterial concentrations of amino acids were lower except for L-asparagine, L-alanine, L-tyrosine and L-phenylalanine. Net uptake of amino acids by the mammary gland of the lactating rat was significantly lower after starvation for 6 or 24 h than in the fed state because the arteriovenous differences of amino acids and the blood flow were significantly lowered. Starvation produced a significant decrease of 2-amino-[1-14C]isobutyric acid uptake by isolated acini from lactating rat. These results show that short-term starvation decreases the amino acid supply and transport in mammary gland as well as the free amino acid concentration in milk.\r"

Effects of the hg gene on the partial energetic efficiencies of protein and fat deposition in mice between 21 and 42 d of age were examined by using comparative slaughter data and multiple regression techniques. Efficiency estimates for fat deposition were biologically impossible and unstable, probably as a result of high correlations between the independent variables (multicollinearity). Use of biased regression techniques gave rise to biologically possible estimates for efficiencies of fat and protein gain. However, biased regression procedures introduced subjectivity in an otherwise objective analysis. Since these regression techniques produce biologically possible estimates, the physiological implications of the results are discussed in relation to protein and fat turnover. Although the usefulness of these statistical methods for predictive purposes is not questioned, it is concluded that they do little toward advancing our understanding of energy metabolism. Rather, we suggest that mechanistic models be used wherein specific biological processes are presented separately and effects of energy intake on these processes accommodated explicitly.\r"

Two days post parturition litters were adjusted to seven pups each, and on d 17 the pups were injected intraperitoneally with 5 X 10(5) plaque-forming units of vaccinia virus. Following a 4-d incubation period, spleens were removed and the cell suspensions combined with YAC-1 target cells to measure cytolysis in a 4- and 16-h chromium release assay. Hematocrit levels of severe (6 ppm) and moderately (10 ppm) iron-deficient rat pups were significantly lower than that of controls. Similarly, body weight and spleen weights were significantly lower in iron-deficient pups than in control pups. Iron deficiency significantly impaired spleen NK cell activity when measured by two different effector:target ratios and assay time periods.\r"

Adult male Swiss-Webster mice were pair-fed for 4 wk an EtOH-containing liquid diet that provided 50 or 100% of the methionine requirement in a 2 X 2 factorial design. Hepatic microsomal protein, relative liver weight and microsomal aniline hydroxylase activity were higher in EtOH-fed groups than in non-EtOH-fed groups. After an ACAP dose of 300 mg/kg body wt i.p., serum inorganic sulfate, endogenous hepatic methionine and GSH concentrations were lower, whereas uridine diphosphoglucuronosyltransferase activity was not changed compared to controls. GSH levels were lowered to a greater extent in the methionine-deficient groups than in methionine-sufficient groups. Incorporation of [35S]methionine into hepatic proteins was lower in all treatment groups after ACAP administration than in controls. The distribution of ACAP into the urinary sulfate conjugates was lower in methionine-deficient than in methionine-sufficient groups, and the percentage of sulfate and mercapturic acid conjugates formed as determined by high-performance liquid chromatographic analysis was higher in mice fed EtOH than in controls. Methionine deficiency compromises the normal pathways of ACAP disposition in the mouse, and chronic EtOH ingestion may potentiate this effect by increasing the amount of activated ACAP formed.\r"

The total amount and the concentration of vitamin A were lower in the liver but higher in the kidneys and in serum of TCDD-treated dams than in controls. TCDD-exposed weanlings showed lower weight gain, liver enlargement and thymus atrophy compared to controls. Growth reduction became more pronounced with time, liver enlargement was at its peak on PND 8 and thymus atrophy was most pronounced on PND 16, although all three effects persisted throughout the study. The total amount of vitamin A increased at a similar rate in control and TCDD-exposed weanlings throughout lactation. When the young started to eat pelleted diet there was a pronounced increase in hepatic vitamin A content. Between PND 16 and 32 controls increased their hepatic vitamin A content 21-fold, compared to 12-fold in TCDD-exposed offspring. The hepatic stores of TCDD-treated animals reached 45% of the stores of control pups on PND 32. From PND 8 renal vitamin A was significantly higher in the TCDD-exposed young than in the controls. At PND 32 TCDD-exposed weanlings had six times more renal vitamin A than controls.\r"

However, much of the energy requirement of the night is met by utilization of feed stored in the upper gastrointestinal tract. It is presumed that some nocturnal energy deficit occurs and is met by changes in metabolism and endocrine balance. The hormonal involvement in these changes in avian metabolism is discussed.\r"

Yolk proteins are almost exclusively synthesized in the liver, then transported to developing follicles. Yolk accrual by follicles is continuous and rapid because of hepatic and follicular construction. Albumen is largely synthesized by the tubular gland cells of the magnum. Albumen formation is also continuous; however, the rate appears to be particularly accentuated during the 4 h the ovum is in the magnum. Ovarian sex steroids are necessary for transcription of mRNA for all of the major egg proteins. Circulating sex steroids undergo a transient surge prior to ovulation that not only extends transcription but also appears to enhance translation of existing mRNA. Full realization of this enhancement by the magnum seems to be limited to when the ovum is present. Hens increase their protein intake at this time, presumably in response to associated demands.\r"

These calculations consider the circadian rhythm in Ca2+ intake when the hen is fed a complete feed or a diet containing oyster shell, the effect of the stage of the ovulatory sequence and the stage of shell formation. The calculations indicate that medullary bone accrues Ca2+ during the day and that Ca2+ is drawn from the bone reserve during the scotophase if shell calcification is active. When fed Ca2+ as an identifiable feedstuff, the hen will ingest large amounts of Ca2+ at the end of the photophase. Some of this Ca2+ is temporarily stored in medullary bone and the remainder is metered into the lower digestive tract throughout the early part of the scotophase. It is suggested that the preovulatory surge of estrogens sensitizes medullary bone to the osteoclastic effect of parathyroid hormone, the production of which is stimulated by a decline in the total and ionized concentrations of Ca2+ during shell formation.\r"

Thirty-six healthy, term, appropriate for gestational age infants were assigned randomly and prospectively to one of two feeding groups and observed longitudinally over the first year of life. Group 1 infants (n = 18) were fed soy protein isolate-based formula (Isomil with Iron); group 2 infants (n = 17) were fed a cow milk protein-based formula (Similac with Iron). All infants were given the formula within the first 24 hours of life, and were fed the study formula through the first year of life. Weight, length, and head circumference were recorded; bone mineral content (BMC) and bone width (BW) were measured at one-third distal length (midshaft) of the left radius and ulna during the first 18 days of life, and again at 6 weeks, and 3, 6, 9, and 12 months postnatally. Baby food was provided to all infants, and except for type of formula, food intake was similar for all infants. Weight, length, and head circumference were normal in all infants and not different between groups. BMC and BMC/BW were similar for both groups at entry into the study. Group 1 infants had significantly lower BMC and BMC/BW at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months of age (P less than 0.05 to P less than 0.0001) compared with group 2 infants, but their values were similar to those in previously studied infants receiving human milk with vitamin D supplementation. The long-term implication of differences in bone mineralization in early infancy for long-term skeletal mineralization remains to be determined.\r"

Pulmonary function tests and graded exercise stress tests were performed. Residual volume, the ratio between residual volume and total lung capacity, vital capacity, forced expiratory volume in 1 second, forced expiratory flow between 25% and 75% of vital capacity, and maximal expiratory flows at 80%, 70%, and 60% of total lung capacity were all abnormal (P less than 0.02) in the children with BPD, compared with control values. Pre-exercise transcutaneous CO2 tension was higher (P less than 0.05) in the BPD group than in the control group. At maximal workload, tcPCO2 remained high in patients with BPD compared with control values (P less than 0.05). Arterial oxygen saturation at maximal workload fell below pre-exercise levels in the BPD group (P less than 0.05) but not in control children. There were no differences in maximal oxygen consumption between the BPD group and control children. Exercise-induced bronchospasm occurred in 50% of the BPD group, but not in the control group. We conclude that long-term survivors of BPD have evidence of airway obstruction, hyperinflation, and airway hyperreactivity, compared with a control group. Aerobic fitness was not significantly different in the BPD and control groups, but was achieved in the BPD group at the expense of a fall in SaO2 and a rise in tcPCO2.\r"

These infants had associated cardiac defects including aortic stenosis, ventricular septal defect, and patent ductus arteriosus. Catheters used carried 5 to 10 mm balloons; 4 to 8 atm pressure was applied for 10 to 15 seconds, and the procedure was repeated at least three times. No significant complications were encountered during the procedure. The mean systolic pressure gradient across the coarctation decreased from 44.2 +/- 4.7 mm Hg to 11.7 +/- 9.4 mm Hg (P less than 0.001) after angioplasty, and the diameter of the coarcted segment increased from 2.9 +/- 0.7 mm to 6.3 +/- 1.2 (P less than 0.001). Long-term follow-up indicated excellent results in four patients; the other two infants required additional treatment (repeat angioplasty and surgical resection, respectively). No aneurysm was seen in any infant. Based on this experience and the reported high mortality and high recurrence rate after surgical repair in neonates and young infants, we recommend balloon angioplasty as the therapeutic procedure of choice for relief of severe, previously unoperated coarctation of the aorta in neonates and young infants.\r"

A distinct, characteristic carotid arterial blood velocity waveform indicating absent cerebral blood flow appeared in 19 of the 23 brain-dead patients 4 months of age or older. The velocity patterns of the other four older children were similar, but not identical, to the characteristic waveform. The remaining nine brain-dead patients were infants 4 months of age or younger. These infants had velocity waveforms different from those of healthy infants, but also were totally different from the characteristic brain death pattern of older children. No patient had the characteristic brain death waveform without being clinically brain dead. Measurement of carotid arterial blood velocity with pulsed Doppler ultrasound is a repeatable, noninvasive, portable test useful for confirmation of brain death in children.\r"

Patients with diabetes were chosen because their renal response to such a meal has been reported to be abnormal. All had an increase in GFR and plasma glucagon levels after the protein meal. The peak rise in GFR occurred from 1 to 2 1/2 hours after the meal (mean +/- SEM, delta 26 +/- 5 mL/min/m2, controls; delta 22 +/- 7 mL/min/m2, patients with diabetes), with the mean time to normal rise in GFR occurring at 2 hours after the meal. Similarly, plasma glucagon values peaked at different times in individual patients (delta 769 +/- 532 pg/mL, controls; delta 267 +/- 69 pg/mL, patients with diabetes), with the mean plasma glucagon rise occurring 1 hours after the meal. Premeal growth hormone levels tended to be higher in the patients with diabetes (7.6 +/- 1.4 vs 2.1 +/- 0.4 ng/mL), and did not change after the meal. To allow study of the contribution of the increased plasma glucagon to the rise in GFR, eight of these patients (five with diabetes) volunteered to undergo a second GFR response test with a simultaneous infusion of somatostatin. The glucagon response was significantly lowered at all time periods during the infusion (P less than 0.05); no significant change in growth hormone occurred. Without somatostatin in these eight patients, peak increase in postmeal GFR average 20.6 +/- 1.5 mL/min/m2; with the somatostatin, peak increase in GFR was 6.0 +/- 1.8 mL/min/m2 (P less than 0.01). Neither metabolic control nor degree of albuminuria was significantly different at the time of the two studies. Thus, as has been shown in animals, somatostatin infusion limits the rise in GFR after a protein meal in humans.\r"

The higher energy intake (formula C) but not the higher protein intake (formula B) resulted in greater energy expenditure. Both the higher protein (formula B vs formula A) and higher energy intakes (formula C vs formula B) resulted in greater weight gain secondary, in group B, to a greater absolute rate of protein deposition and, in group C, to a greater absolute rate of fat deposition. The relative composition of the new tissue deposited reflected the proportional intakes of protein and energy. The numerical value of the protein/fat ratio (g/g) of the new tissue deposited by infants fed formulas A and C, the protein contents of which were low relative to energy contents, were similar and significantly lower than the numerical value of the protein/fat ratio of the new tissue deposited by infants fed formula B, which had a higher protein content relative to energy content. These findings suggest that the composition of weight gain is related to both the absolute amounts and the proportions of dietary protein and energy; thus, both must be considered in formulation of nutritional regimens for LBW infants.\r"

Of 17 infants (mean gestational age 37.5 weeks, mean birth weight 3070 g) 14 (82%) had detectable tricuspid regurgitation. By modified Bernoulli equation, all infants had right ventricular pressure greater than 60% of systemic pressure, and nine of 14 had estimated right ventricular pressure at or near systemic pressures. In eight infants for whom sequential evaluations could be obtained, right ventricular pressure as a percentage of systemic pressure gradually decreased, and corresponded to decreasing needs for supplemental oxygenation. Tricuspid regurgitation could no longer be detected between 3 and 16 days after the first study, and was associated with decreased right ventricular pressures (less than 50% systemic) and weaning from supplemental oxygenation. We conclude that in the near-term infant with early respiratory difficulties, tricuspid regurgitation is common and is associated with increased right ventricular pressure.\r"

Each of these fractions was instilled into the lungs of dogs (15 experimental, eight saline solution controls), and cardiac output, venous and arterial blood gases, pulmonary, atrial, and systemic pressures, airway pressure, and static lung compliance were serially monitored for 2 hours. Mean airway pressure increased and static lung compliance decreased significantly in all of the experimental groups. Although arterial pH and PaCO2 and the various hemodynamic measurements did not change during the experiment, PaO2 decreased significantly and did not return to baseline in all experimental groups. Extracts from atelectatic portions of experimental dog lung had a surface tension minimum of greater than 20 dynes/cm, whereas airway foam had a surface tension minimum of less than 10 dynes/cm, suggesting that the free fatty acids of meconium are able to strip surfactant from the alveoli.\r"

Most rings could be seen without slit lamp by direct inspection of the cornea. Furthermore, the rings appeared to resolve over time. Liver dysfunction tended to be more severe in patients with corneal rings. We speculate that abnormal tissue accumulation of copper may be present in many infants with cholestatic liver disease. Ophthalmologic examination for pigmented corneal rings or determination of serum copper levels may need to be performed in patients at high risk with hepatic disease to monitor for excessive copper accumulation.\r"

  ".U": "87197905\r", 
  ".W": "A prospective study of a cohort of healthy infants observed from birth to 2 years of age was carried out to investigate factors influencing the development of early adiposity. Infant suckling was measured in the laboratory twice during the first month of life. Multiple regression analyses revealed that parental educational level and a measure of feeding behavior, the interval between bursts of suckling, accounted for 18% of the variance in triceps skinfold measures at 1 year of age. A lower level of education and shorter interburst interval were associated with increased adiposity. Two feeding variables, pressure of suckling and the number of reported feeds per day, accounted for 21% of the variance in skinfold thickness at 2 years of age. Fewer, but larger, feeds and a higher sucking pressure were associated with a greater degree of adiposity. It seems that a vigorous infant feeding style, consisting of sucking more rapidly, at higher pressure, with a longer suck and burst duration, and a shorter interval between bursts of sucking, is associated with higher caloric intake and greater adiposity. The early development of this feeding style suggests that it may be a genetically endowed behavior. Breast-feeding protected against early adiposity only to the age of 6 months in this cohort of infants.\r"

Initial patient reports of self-esteem, perceived competence, social functioning, behavioral symptoms, and their adjustment to diabetes predicted subsequent compliance behaviors. The findings highlight the linkage of child personality and adjustment with self-care of diabetes, and suggest that psychosocial assessment soon after diabetes is diagnosed may help identify patients at risk for later compliance problems.\r"

When lungs were challenged by 60 min of perfusion with H2O2 (generated by the reaction between glucose and glucose oxidase) the wet weight-to-dry weight ratio increased from control by 54%, indicating development of pulmonary edema. In contrast, lungs treated simultaneously with H2O2 plus PGE1 (1 microgram/min) failed to exhibit an elevated wet-to-dry weight ratio. H2O2-injured lungs demonstrated a modest 2 torr increase in pulmonary arterial perfusion pressure that was not influenced by simultaneous treatment with PGE1. Both radioimmunoassay (RIA) and high-performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) analysis detected increased amounts of (5S)-5-hydroxy-6,8,11,14 eicosatetraenoic acid in the perfusion medium of H2O2-injured lungs (RIA, 48.0 +/- 14.7; HPLC, 54.8 +/- 13.5) relative to controls (RIA, 6.6 +/- 1.6; HPLC, 6.8 +/- 1.9), and simultaneous treatment with PGE1 tended to blunt this increase (RIA, 29.2 +/- 8.3; HPLC, 29.8 +/- 7.6). PGE1 abolished the increase in wet weight-to-dry weight ratio induced by exogenous leukotriene C4. Production of H2O2 by the glucose-glucose oxidase reaction was not influenced by PGE1. Taken together, these observations indicate that PGE1 attenuates H2O2-induced pulmonary edema formation in buffer-perfused rat lungs by mechanisms that may relate to inhibition of lung 5'-lipoxygenase activation and/or to inhibition of the injurious effects of endogenously produced lipoxygenase products.\r"

  ".W": "The in vivo pharmacological activity of L-364,718, a new, potent peripheral cholecystokinin (CCK) antagonist, was characterized in several species using assay systems that measure various well known actions of CCK upon the gastrointestinal system. Administered p.o., L-364,178 was highly potent in antagonizing cholecystokinin octapeptide (CCK-8)-induced inhibition of gastric emptying in mice (ED50 = 38 micrograms/kg), rats (ED50 = 140 micrograms/kg) and dogs (ED50 = 91 micrograms/kg) as well as CCK-8-induced reduction in food consumption in rats (ED50 = 321 micrograms/kg). Administered i.v., L-364,718 effectively antagonized the contractile effects of CCK on the colon in rabbits (ED50 = 34 micrograms/kg) and the gallbladder in cats (ED50 = 210 micrograms/kg). Secretion of pancreatic protein and amylase elicited by CCK in cats was also antagonized by L-364,718 (ED50 less than 1.0 mg/kg i.v.). The CCK antagonism produced by L-364,718 in all species persisted for at least 2 to 5 hr. In the absence of exogenously administered CCK-8, L-364,718 per se had no effect in any of the assay systems studied, indicating a lack of CCK-like agonist properties. Specificity for CCK was demonstrated by the inability of L-364,718 (1.0-5.0 mg/kg) to antagonize either amino acid- or atropine-induced inhibition of gastric emptying in rats and dogs, respectively. L-364,718 also did not antagonize motilin-induced gallbladder contractions or secretin-induced pancreatic secretion in cats.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "A new, highly potent antagonist of gut cholecystokinin (CCK) receptors has been examined for effects upon postprandial biliary and exocrine pancreatic secretion in conscious dogs with chronic duodenal pouches. This drug (L-364,718) markedly inhibited the postprandial increases in biliary volume, bile acid and bilirubin secretion. However, even at high p.o. doses relative to its ability to antagonize the effects of exogenous CCK, no effects were observed upon the pancreatic secretion of either fluid volume or amylase and lipase under similar conditions. In additional studies, pretreatment with L-364,718 did not significantly reverse the inhibitory effects of a fatty acid salt (sodium oleate) upon gastric emptying in gastric fistula dogs. Moreover, pretreatment with L-364,718 had no significant effects upon postprandial acid and pepsin secretion in lesser curvature (vagally innervated) pouch dogs or did it affect basal (interdigestive) gastric secretion in rats. These results suggest that endogenous CCK plays a critical physiological role in regulating postprandial biliary outflow, but not pancreatic enzyme secretion or the gastric emptying of at least liquid fatty substances. The latter two findings stand in contrast with classical views regarding the physiological function(s) of this hormone.\r"

Fractional recrystallization of binaphthyl phosphate salts of dl-threo-MPH allowed resolution of d-threo-MPH and 92% enrichment of l-threo-MPH. The enantiomeric disposition was monitored using gas chromatographic separation of trifluoroacetylprolyl diastereomeric derivatives. The activity of the d-isomer was greater than the l-isomer in the induction of locomotor activity and the inhibition of tritiated dopamine and l-norepinephrine uptake into striatal and hypothalamic synaptosomes, respectively. Neither isomer produced a significant change in the spontaneous release of tritiated catecholamines from synaptosomes. Destruction of catecholaminergic neurons by 6-hydroxydopamine pretreatment attenuated the locomotor response to d-threo-MPH, indicating the involvement of catecholaminergic neural pathways in the locomotor response. Only the d-enantiomer significantly potentiated the pressor responses to i.v. l-norepinephrine. Receptor site stereoselectively for threo- vs. erythro-MPH is discussed in terms of isomer conformational preferences. These results suggest that synaptic inhibition of catecholamine uptake by d-threo-MPH may be involved fundamentally in behavioral and pressor effects of the racemic drug.\r"

  ".W": "The training dose was progressively reduced (faded) using rats in a drug discrimination task in order to determine whether the discriminative stimulus effects of phencyclidine HCI (PCP) were separable from its response rate effects. Rats were initially trained to discriminate PCP from saline in a two-lever food-reinforced operant discrimination procedure. After initial training at 3.0 mg/kg, the rats were subsequently retrained at 1.5, 0.75 and 0.375 mg/kg. Stimulus generalization testing followed training at each training dose. Although discriminative control was developed by lower doses of PCP during the fading procedures, control by previously effective higher doses was not diminished. The number of training sessions required before reaching criterion levels of performance and the number of errors during training (i.e., incorrect lever selections) increased with decreases in training dose. The results indicated that fading of the training dose of PCP caused marked parallel shifts in the dose-effect curves for PCP's discriminative stimulus effects although its response rate effects were left unaffected. The ED50 for PCP's discriminative stimulus effects decreased with decreases in training dose although the ratio of the ED50 to the training dose remained relatively constant. The ED50 for the response rate effects, however, remained relatively constant with decreases in training dose, and the ratio of the ED50 to the training dose markedly increased. It was concluded that the discriminative stimulus and the response rate effects of PCP are separable and, hence are under control by different determinants.\r"

  ".W": "We examined the hypothesis that the reduced accumulation of aminoglycoside in renal cortex of rats with streptozotocin-induced diabetes mellitus (DM) is secondary to lower rates of tubular transport of drug compared with non-DM rats. Using whole kidney clearance techniques we found that the fractional excretion of [3H]netilmicin in DM rats rose from an initial value of 92.4 +/- 1.3% to 101 +/- 4.5% (N = 10) after eight 20-min periods. These values were not significantly different from those of non-DM rats (96.4 +/- 1.8 and 106.7 +/- 1.4%, respectively, N = 7). The plasma concentration of drug was similar in the two groups whereas inulin clearance and the filtered load of drug were higher in DM rats. In both groups microinjection experiments revealed the presence of an absorptive flux of [3H]netilmicin along the proximal tubule and loop of Henle, but no absorptive flux was detected along the distal nephron. In free-flow micropuncture experiments in DM rats a net secretory flux of netilmicin was detected in the early proximal tubule and a net absorptive flux was detected along the loop of Henle, presumably the pars recta. No net flux occurred along the distal tubule. These findings are similar to those previously reported by us for non-DM rats. At the end of the clearance experiments the concentration of netilmicin in renal cortex of DM rats (56 +/- 5 micrograms/g wet wt.) was significantly less (P less than .01) than that in the renal cortex of non-DM rats (122 +/- 6 micrograms/g wet wt).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Administration of LTD4 alone into the LCX (0.625-10 micrograms) produced a dose-dependent decrease in LCX blood flow, dP/dt and aortic blood flow and an increase in left ventricular end-diastolic pressure. Systemic arterial blood pressure, left ventricular developed pressure and heart rate were unchanged by LTD4. During i.v. infusions of the LTD4 antagonists, SK&F 102922 or FPL 55712 (1 mg/kg/min), the dose-dependent decreases in LCX flow, dP/dt and aortic blood flow were blocked whereas the increase in left ventricular end-diastolic pressure remained unchanged. The thromboxane A2 antagonist, SK&F 88046 (5 mg/kg + 0.1 mg/kg/min), which has been reported previously to block the coronary blood flow reducing action of LTC4, had no effect on the LCX blood flow responses to intracoronary LTD4. In a separate study, dogs instrumented in a similar manner were given bolus injections of arginine-vasopressin (1 microgram), the thromboxane A2 mimetic, U-46619 (10 micrograms), LTD4 (10 micrograms), angiotensin II (1 microgram) and prostaglandin F2 alpha (100 micrograms) directly into the LCX to provoke coronary vasoconstriction.

In hippocampal slices prepared from rats receiving i.c.v. AF64A, the activation of phosphoinositide turnover or the inhibition of cyclic AMP accumulation elicited by muscarinic receptor agonists is facilitated. This AF64A treatment also causes a long-lasting decrease of hippocampal norepinephrine and serotonin (5-HT) content. Even a smaller dose of AF64A (1.5 nmol/side) reduces the hippocampal 5-HT content. The number of alpha-1 adrenoceptor recognition sites is slightly increased by 3 nmol/side of AF64A and the stimulation of phosphoinositide turnover by norepinephrine is facilitated. In contrast the decrease of hippocampal 5-HT concentration elicited by AF64A fails to change the 5-HT receptor indices that were measured. These results indicate that in rat hippocampus muscarinic receptors and alpha-1 adrenoceptors are denervated by AF64A and that this denervation promotes a receptor supersensitivity. These results also suggest that we could not find appropriate conditions to express a complete specificity of AF64A in destroying cholinergic axons and therefore this drug cannot be used readily to induce a selective deficiency of central cholinergic transmission.\r"

  ".W": "Repeated administration of the centrally acting beta adrenoceptor agonist, clenbuterol, to rats reduced the ability of isoproterenol to increase the concentration of cyclic AMP (cAMP) in slices of cerebellum. This reduced responsiveness to isoproterenol was accompanied by a marked reduction in the density of beta adrenoceptors as measured by the binding of the beta adrenoceptor antagonist [125I]iodopindolol. In addition, the agonist-binding properties of remaining cerebellar beta adrenoceptors were altered after clenbuterol treatment. The clenbuterol-induced reduction in the density of beta adrenoceptors in the cerebellum is in marked contrast to its inability to do this in cerebral cortex. Comparison of the ability of clenbuterol to that of isoproterenol to increase levels of cAMP in slices of cerebral cortex or cerebellum showed that clenbuterol is a weakly potent agonist in both brain regions. The increase in cAMP induced by isoproterenol in the cortex was significantly reduced in the presence of the selective beta-1 adrenoceptor antagonist, ICI 89,406. In contrast, the clenbuterol-induced increase in cortical cAMP was unchanged by ICI 89,406 but was reduced significantly by the beta-2 adrenoceptor antagonist, ICI 118,551. In cerebellum, both isoproterenol- and clenbuterol-stimulated accumulation of cAMP were antagonized much more potently by ICI 118,551 than by ICI 89,406. Furthermore, clenbuterol antagonized the cAMP response induced by isoproterenol in the presence of ICI 118,551 in a concentration-dependent manner. In terms of measurement of cAMP in brain slices, clenbuterol is weakly potent as an agonist at beta-2 adrenoceptors and has antagonist properties at beta-1 adrenoceptors.\r"

The radioactivity in hypothalamus and cortex 20 min to 2 hr after [3H]CN-IMI administration was reduced in rats pretreated with chlorimipramine (10 mg/kg) 5 min before [3H]CN-IMI. No effect of chlorimipramine pretreatment was seen in the cerebellum; levels of radioactivity in this tissue were subtracted from total levels in hypothalamus and cortex to define specific binding. This represented approximately 50 and 30% of total binding in hypothalamus and cortex, respectively. Specific binding in hypothalamus and cortex was reduced by a number of drugs which are potent blockers of serotonin uptake and the binding was inhibited in a stereoselective manner by the stereoisomers of norzimelidine. In contrast, pretreatment with drugs which are weak inhibitors of serotonin uptake had no effect on specific binding. Experiments using increasing doses of [3H]CN-IMI showed that the binding in vivo was saturable. Lesioning rats with the serotonin neurotoxin 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine resulted in an 80% decrease in the specific binding in hypothalamus and a 35% decrease in cortex. The potencies of drugs to inhibit the specific binding of [3H]CN-IMI in vivo were highly correlated with their previously published potencies for inhibiting serotonin uptake in human blood platelets in vitro and for preventing the serotonin depletion induced by 4-methyl-alpha-ethyl-metatyramine in vivo. These results indicate that [3H]CN-IMI can be given to rats to provide a measure of serotonin uptake sites in the central nervous system in vivo.\r"

  ".W": "To determine the hemodynamic effects of isomazole, an imidazopyridine, we administered isomazole (10 and 20 micrograms/kg/min) to 10 awake dogs with right-sided congestive heart failure produced by pulmonary artery constriction and tricuspid valve avulsion. Isomazole increased cardiac output, heart rate, right ventricular and left ventricular (LV) dP/dt, LVdP/dt/P and decreased aortic pressure and total peripheral vascular resistance. Simultaneously, blood flow increased to myocardium, quadriceps muscle, brain and splanchnic beds, whereas vascular resistance decreased. Furthermore, isomazole increased LV oxygen consumption and decreased transcoronary arteriovenous oxygen difference. Similar administration of normal saline had no effects. Angiotensin II was infused to restore mean aortic pressure to base-line values during isomazole infusion; however, despite the return of aortic pressure to base-line values, cardiac output, LVdP/dt and LVdP/dt/P remained elevated. The systemic and regional hemodynamic effects of isomazole were unaffected by pretreatment with propranolol and mecamylamine. Thus, isomazole exerted positive inotropic, chronotropic and vasodilator effects in congestive heart failure dogs. The inotropic effect of isomazole was independent of the decrease in aortic pressure, and the hemodynamic effects of isomazole were not mediated via the autonomic nervous system. Furthermore, the decrease in transcoronary arteriovenous oxygen difference suggests that isomazole exerted an active coronary vasodilator action which may improve myocardial oxygen demand/supply ratio.\r"

This study was designed to characterize the behavioral sensitization produced by daily morphine and to evaluate the involvement of the mesolimbic and/or mesocortical dopamine (DA) neurons. Daily injection of morphine for 7 days produced an increase in both horizontal and vertical photocell counts. There was no difference in morphine levels in the blood or brain between daily morphine- and daily saline-treated rats at 30 or 90 min after acute injection of morphine. The increase was present for 60 days after initiating treatment and was associated with increases in locomotion, rearing, sniffing, grooming and bursting. Sensitization to morphine was prevented by pretreatment with naloxone i.p. or naltrexone methobromide injection into the ventral tegmental area (VTA; location of A10 DA perikarya projecting to limbic and cortical areas). In contrast, pretreatment with the same dose of naltrexone methobromide injected into the nucleus accumbens (limbic DA terminal field) or lateral ventricles did not significantly attenuate behavioral sensitization to morphine. Daily intra-VTA injections of the mu opioid agonist Tyr-D-Ala-Gly-NMe-Phe-Gly-ol enhanced the behavioral stimulant effect of acute morphine. The effects of daily morphine treatment on DA systems were evaluated by measuring DA metabolism, dopa accumulation and DA depletion in the VTA and various DA terminal fields including the prefrontal cortex, nucleus accumbens and striatum.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Bradykinin increased synthesis of prostaglandin E2 and thromboxane B2 more from colitis than from control colons (both P less than .001) but had no effect on leukotriene synthesis. The inflammatory cell agonist N-formylmethionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (30 ng) also induced greater synthesis of prostaglandin E2 (70 +/- 13 vs. 14 +/- 6) and thromboxane B2 (84 +/- 22 vs. 20 +/- 11) from colitis than from control colons (P less than .01), but leukotriene B4 (416 +/- 68 vs. 438 +/- 128 ng/5 min) and leukotriene C4 (171 +/- 50 vs. 203 +/- 25 ng/5 min) synthesis were greatly augmented in both colitis and control colons. In vitro incubations demonstrated similar dose-dependent stimulation of leukotriene B4 by N-formylmethionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine in both colitis and control colons. These studies demonstrate that healthy colon tissue as well as colitis tissue can produce proinflammatory leukotrienes in response to bacterial peptides. Leukotriene production may contribute to the induction or mediation of colon inflammation.\r"

Pavlovian conditioning of nictitating membrane extension was accomplished by pairing the offset of a 800-msec tone- and light-conditioned stimulus with the onset of a 100-msec shock unconditioned stimulus to the skin just lateral to the outer canthus of the eye. L-PIA (5 mumol/kg) retarded the acquisition of conditioned responses to the tone- and light-conditioned stimuli, although theophylline (50-200 mumol/kg), caffeine (3-100 mumol/kg) and rolipram (0.03-3.0 mumol/kg) had no effect. The highest dose of caffeine used (300 mumol/kg) produced a small but significant enhancement of conditioned response acquisition in two of four experiments. The two adenosine antagonists theophylline (200 mumol/kg) and caffeine (300 mumol/kg) completely blocked the retardant effects of L-PIA on acquisition, although the phosphodiesterase inhibitor rolipram (3.0 mumol/kg) did not. In previously trained animals, L-PIA (5 mumol/kg) also increased the intensity threshold of a tone-conditioned stimulus for eliciting conditioned responses by more than 10 db. Theophylline (200 mumol/kg) and caffeine (300 mumol/kg) had no effect on the intensity threshold of the tone-conditioned stimulus but completely antagonized the effects of L-PIA. It was suggested that the depressant effects of the adenosine analog L-PIA on both the acquisition of conditioned responses and on the ability of a conditioned stimulus to elicit conditioned responses as soon as learning had occurred were mediated by adenosine receptors.\r"

Activation of adenylate cyclase by VIP had a Ka of 65 nM, and the maximal response was 3.3-fold greater than that for I-isoproterenol (Ka, 102 nM). A peptide fragment of VIP (sequence 10-28) was inactive in all assays and did not inhibit VIP-stimulated adenylate cyclase at 10 microM. Responses to VIP and isoproterenol in combination were additive at lower doses but less than additive at maximal doses. Responses to VIP in combination with a low dose of forskolin (0.1 microM) were potentiated at all dose levels, whether assays were done in presence of MgCl2 or MnCl2. VIP- and forskolin-activated adenylate cyclase was associated with the nonpigmented epithelial cell fraction and not with pigmented epithelial cells separated on Percoll density gradients after dissociation of cells from processes by collagenase digestion. Intravitreous injection of 10 nmol of VIP into the rabbit eye caused a maximal reduction in intraocular pressure at 40 to 50 hr lasting beyond 72 hr. VIP-responsive and beta adrenergic-responsive adenylate cyclase are present on the same cell type (nonpigmented epithelial cells) and appear to share components of the adenylate cyclase system in the same membrane. VIP may participate in the physiologic regulation of aqueous humor secretion at the level of the epithelial cell membrane.\r"

In the superior mesenteric artery, determinations were made after endothelial inactivation and in the presence of indomethacin, because in this vessel blockade by these procedures influences norepinephrine sensitivity. In 12 arteries a positive correlation was found between norepinephrine pD2 and pKA (r = 0.74, P less than .01). The slope of the regression line did not differ from unity. Norepinephrine pD2 did not correlate with receptor reserve in these arteries when assessed as antilog pD2-pKA. In three arteries, the ear and common and external iliac, a large receptor reserve was found. If these were excluded from the series, the following correlation would be found: r = 0.9; P less than .001. Here again the slope of the regression line did not differ from unity. The pD2 and pKA were determined for the more selective alpha-1 adrenoceptor agonist, phenylephrine in six of these arteries, and similar results were obtained. The KB for prazosin in this series did not correlate with norepinephrine KA (r = 0.45, P greater than .05), and the slope (0.17) was not significantly different from zero.

In contrast to tricyclic antidepressants, fengabine antagonizes 5-hydroxytryptophan-induced head twitches and only weakly reverses reserpine-induced ptosis. Fengabine inhibits neither monoamine uptake nor monoamine oxidase. A GABAergic mechanism of fengabine is indicated as bicuculline reverses its action in the olfactory bulbectomy and learned helplessness models.

  ".W": "The effects of fengabine (a novel benzylidene derivative possessing clinically demonstrated antidepressant action) on neurochemical parameters related to norepinephrine, serotonin and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) neurons have been investigated in the rat and mouse brain. When given acutely, fengabine (50-1000 mg/kg i.p.) does not alter norepinephrine uptake but accelerates the turnover rate of norepinephrine in the rat brain as demonstrated by the enhancement of: the alpha-methyl-p-tyrosine-induced disappearance of norepinephrine in the hypothalamus; 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid levels in noradrenergic cell body areas; the pargyline-induced accumulation of normetanephrine in the hypothalamus; and 3,4-dihydroxyphenylethyleneglycol levels in the hypothalamus, septum and spinal cord. No tolerance to the effect of fengabine on the latter biochemical parameter was observed after repeated treatment for 2 weeks at doses of 100 or 200 mg/kg i.p., b.i.d. Fengabine (100 or 200 mg/kg i.p., b.i.d.), given for 14 days, causes a desensitization of isoprenaline-stimulated adenylate cyclase in septal and cortical slices of the rat but fails to modify cortical beta, alpha-1 or alpha-2 adrenoceptor binding sites. Fengabine (up to 400 mg/kg i.p.) has no effect on rat cerebral serotonin uptake, synthesis or metabolism. Moreover, when given subacutely (100 or 200 mg/kg i.p., b.i.d. for 2 weeks), it fails to alter rat cortical serotonine receptors or [3H]imipramine binding sites. Fengabine (up to 50-100 microM) is also inactive in vitro on [3H] GABA binding to GABAA or GABAB receptors in the rat brain or on GABA transaminase activity in the mouse brain.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The potency of various C-terminal fragments of the neurohypophyseal hormone [Arg8]vasopressin [AVP-(1-9)] was determined using different avoidance behavioral test procedures in rats. Passive avoidance behavior was facilitated by these peptides. The fragments [Cyt6]AVP-(5-8) and [Cyt6]AVP-(5-9) were the most potent peptides tested after postlearning injection (consolidation) and preretention treatment (retrieval), respectively, after s.c. treatment. Comparable results were found when the peptides were injected into the lateral brain ventricle, but after this route of administration the peptides were about 3 to 4 order of magnitude more potent as compared to the s.c. route. Pentylenetetrazol-induced retrograde amnesia was reversed by AVP-(1-9) and various C-terminal fragments. In this respect [Cyt6] AVP-(5-9) and [pGlu4,Cyt6]-AVP-(4-9) appeared to be the most potent peptides. Injection of AVP-(1-9) and various C-terminal fragments after the acquisition of pole-jumping avoidance behavior induced resistance to extinction of the behavior. The fragment [pGlu4,Cyt6]AVP-(4-8) was the most potent peptide for this effect. Passive avoidance behavior was attenuated by s.c. administered oxytocin [OXT-(1-9)] and various C-terminal fragments. [pGlu4,Cyt6]-OXT-(4-9), [pGlu4,Cyt6]OXT-(4-8) and [Cyt6]OXT-(5-8) were the most potent of the peptides tested after postlearning administration, whereas [Cyt6]OXT-(5-9) was the most potent sequence after preretention injection. In all experiments the effects of the peptides were dose-dependent and of a long term nature. The results show that C-terminal fragments of the neurohypophyseal hormones potently modulate various aspects of memory processes, as assessed with different avoidance behaviors.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

However, it has been difficult to show that DA agonists or antagonists can modify K+-evoked release of [3H]DA. DA. In this study [3H]DA release evoked by exposure of synaptosomes (isolated and superfused previously with 0.0 mM Ca++ and 0.1 mM ethylene glycol bis(beta-aminoethyl ether)-N,N'-tetraacetic acid) to 1.25 mM Ca++ can be modulated by the DA (D2) agonists apomorphine, pergolide and quinpirole and antagonists l-sulpiride and domperidone. The release was evoked under low potassium (6 mM or less) concentrations and the potassium concentration in the superfusion medium was not elevated before or during Ca++ exposure. Analysis of the superfusates obtained during Ca++ exposure revealed that approximately 80% of the tritium released was [3H]DA. The ability of DA (D2) agonists to inhibit the Ca++-evoked release from synaptosomes superfused with 9 mM K+ was greatly reduced. Therefore, prolonged depolarization may block DA (D2) regulation of [3H]DA release from synaptosomes. The Ca++-evoked release of [3H]DA was reduced greatly when 1 microM tetrodotoxin was present indicating sodium channels play a role in triggering the processes involved in Ca++-evoked [3H]DA release.\r"

  ".W": "Whereas the interval-dependence of antiarrhythmic drug effects on Vmax is known, the corresponding time-dependence of drug-induced changes in cardiac conduction is not established. The purpose of these experiments was to study the relationship between the time-dependence of lidocaine-induced changes in Vmax and in conduction time. Standard microelectrode techniques were used to monitor conduction and action potential characteristics of Purkinje fibers within free-running canine false tendons. Lidocaine-induced alterations in conduction and Vmax were related to drug concentration and to the preceding diastolic recovery time. At concentrations of 18 to 74 microM, changes in both Vmax and conduction time were an exponential function of diastolic interval, with recovery time constants averaging 123 to 150 msec for conduction time and 138 to 150 msec for Vmax. With higher lidocaine concentrations, changes in Vmax continued to be an exponential function of recovery interval, whereas changes in conduction time consistently deviated from the terminal exponential relationship at short diastolic intervals. These observations are consistent with the predictions of a model based on linear cable theory. Calculations using this model suggest that recovery from moderate drug-induced conduction slowing should proceed with a time course similar to changes in Vmax, whereas recovery from more severe conduction slowing should occur more rapidly than changes in Vmax. These observations suggest that the time dependence of drug effects on conduction in vivo can be analyzed quantitatively in relationship to observations on Vmax in vitro.\r"

  ".W": "The purpose of these experiments was to evaluate the relationship between interval dependent effects of antiarrhythmic drugs on conduction time and Vmax in canine cardiac Purkinje fibers. Standard microelectrode techniques were used to monitor action potential characteristics at two sites along a canine cardiac false tendon and to measure interelectrode conduction time. The maximum rate of voltage rise during phase 0 (Vmax) and conduction time were independent of diastolic interval under control conditions. In the presence of local anesthetic drugs, recovery from drug-induced depression of Vmax and conduction were first order processes with recovery time constants (mean +/- S.D. in seconds) of 0.14 +/- 0.02 (for Vmax) and 0.15 +/- 0.04 (for conduction time) for lidocaine; 0.17 +/- 0.04 and 0.18 +/- 0.05, respectively, for mexiletine; 0.26 +/- 0.05 and 0.27 +/- 0.07 for amitriptyline; and 1.01 +/- 0.31 and 1.00 +/- 0.32 for procainamide. The kinetics of onset of block were studied using a 30-sec pause, followed by a pacing cycle length of 300 msec (for procainamide) or 1 sec (for quinidine). The onset time constants averaged 2.66 +/- 0.53 pulses (for Vmax) and 2.49 +/- 0.42 pulses (for conduction time) in the presence of procainamide; and 4.02 +/- 1.33 pulses (for Vmax) and 3.86 +/- 1.22 pulses (for conduction time) in the presence of quinidine. These experiments show that local anesthetic drugs produce use dependent changes in conduction time in vitro with time constants comparable to simultaneously measured time constants for effects on Vmax. They imply that the use dependence of drug effects on cardiac conduction can be studied quantitatively in vivo by studying the response to changes in activation frequency.\r"

  ".W": "The pharmacokinetics and the antiarrhythmic effect of lidocaine were studied in healthy dogs on three occasions: before administration of rifampicin, on the 14th day of treatment with rifampicin and 4 weeks after stopping rifampicin treatment. On each occasion a loading and a maintenance infusion of lidocaine were given to obtain steady-state concentrations. Blood and plasma concentrations of lidocaine, alpha-1-acid glycoprotein plasma concentrations and percentage of free lidocaine in plasma were determined at the end of the maintenance infusion. The antiarrhythmic effect of lidocaine was evaluated by measuring the arrhythmogenic dose of epinephrine. Blood concentrations and, consequently, the total blood clearance of lidocaine were comparable on the three occasions. Total plasma concentrations were significantly higher after rifampicin administration as compared to the two control periods. Percentage of free lidocaine decreased from about 50 to about 30%, accompanied by a nearly 3-fold increase of alpha-1-acid glycoprotein concentrations. Free plasma concentrations were slightly lower after rifampicin treatment. The epinephrine dose ratio (before/after) paralleled the changes in free lidocaine concentrations. The correlation between free plasma concentrations and epinephrine dose ratio was much stronger than between total plasma concentrations and epinephrine dose ratio. The plasma elimination half-life of lidocaine was markedly shortened after rifampicin treatment, due to a diminished volume of distribution. It is concluded that, under steady-state conditions, marked increases in the protein binding of lidocaine are accompanied by only slight decreases of free plasma concentrations and of antiarrhythmic effect.\r"

All three agonists produced concentration-dependent relaxations of the isolated saphenous vein with an order of potency: procaterol (pD2 value, 7.69) greater than isoproterenol (pD2 value, 7.41) much greater than norepinephrine (pD2 value, 5.30). ICI 118,551 (3 X 10(-10) to 3 X 10(-9) M) was nearly 100 times more potent than bisoprolol (10(-7) to 10(-6) M) in antagonizing the relaxant effects of isoproterenol and procaterol. The slopes of the Schild plots for the antagonistic effects of ICI 118,551 and bisoprolol against isoproterenol- and procaterol-induced relaxations were not significantly different from unity indicating interaction with a homogeneous population of beta adrenoceptors. The pA2 value for ICI 118,551 amounted to 9.11 to 9.20 and for bisoprolol to 6.50 to 6.63. In addition, the concentration-response curve for the relaxant effect of norepinephrine was significantly shifted to the right by 10(-9) M ICI 118,551, but not affected by 10(-7) M bisoprolol. These results indicate that on the isolated strips of the human saphenous vein the beta adrenoceptor mediating relaxation is of the beta-2 subtype.\r"

After isoelectric focusing across a pH gradient, it occupies the same position as the synthetically reconstituted or chemically generated species, (alpha 2+ beta 3+)2 (I). Unlike its synthetic or chemically generated counterpart, however, it (HbX) does not bind oxygen. A different method for the preparation in situ of the (alpha 3+ beta 2+)2 valency hybrid results in a pigment with chemical and spectral properties identical with those ascribed to its synthetically reconstituted counterpart, and both bind oxygen. HbX is generated in highest yield when red cells are incubated under N2 in the presence of glucose, methylene blue and nitrite for several hours. Its visible absorption spectrum differs from that reported for I, and it reacted very slowly with ferricyanide. Exposure to CO did not result in spectral shifts over that for HbX in air, but spectral shifts were produced with CO exposure of (alpha 3+ beta 2+)2. HbX had an inositol hexaphosphate difference-binding spectrum quite unlike that described for I. HbX also had a distinctive electron paramagnetic resonance spectrum that shifted after inositol hexaphosphate addition with a new three-line hyperfine pattern. Both spectra were characteristic for an unpaired electron in an iron-centered orbital with a hyperfine coupling to the nitrogen nuclear spin of a nitrosyl ligand on heme iron. The authors conclude that HbX is a form of I, but it has NO bound to its reduced subunits.\r"

[Met]enkephalin produced a dose-dependent (3-300 micrograms/kg) decrease in hindquarter vascular resistance (18-42% change from base line). The duration of the response ranged from 28 sec to over 2 min. Heart rate decreased 16 to 45% over the same dose range but returned to preinjection levels in 5 sec. Only the bradycardia was abolished by pretreatment with atropine methyl nitrate. All hemodynamic changes were eliminated or significantly reduced after pretreatment with the ganglionic blocking agent, chlorisondamine hydrochloride. The opioid antagonist, naloxone hydrochloride, abolished the hemodynamic effects of [met]enkephalin. Resistance decreases in the mesenteric vasculature were coincident with those in the hindquarters. The time to onset of the response was delayed when [met]enkephalin was injected i.v. These data indicate activation of a reflex originating in the hindquarters that resulted in opioid-dependent increased efferent parasympathetic activity to the heart and decreased sympathetic tone to at least two vascular beds.\r"

Depressions induced by PCP or dexoxadrol, a sigma receptor agonist, were markedly antagonized by the PCP receptor antagonist metaphit, which acylates PCP receptors via its isothiocyanate moiety. Conversely, the depressant effect of levoxadrol, the (-) isomer of dexoxadrol, was not affected by metaphit. Further evidence that metaphit's specific antagonism of dexoxadrol- and PCP-mediated depressions was derived from data showing that drugs which respectively acylate mu and delta opioid receptors, benzimidazole isothiocyanate and fentanyl isothiocyanate, do not antagonize the actions of either PCP or dexoxadrol. Moreover, tyramine, which like PCP acts as an indirect norepinephrine agonist, is not antagonized by metaphit. These observations support the concept that metaphit causes a pharmacologically specific and irreversible antagonism of the effects of both PCP and dexoxadrol in the cerebellum. Thus, the electrophysiological mechanisms of PCP actions are similar to those triggered by sigma opioid agonists in this brain area.\r"

Thus, injection of morphine and enkephalin analogs into the ventral tegmental area (a major subnucleus of the A10 DA region) produces an increase in spontaneous motor activity that is blocked by DA receptor antagonists and increases DA metabolism in the nucleus accumbens. The present study utilized enkephalin analogs specific for either the mu or delta opioid receptor to evaluate which receptor subtype(s) is activating the A10 DA neurons. It was found that the specific mu agonist, Try-D-Ala-Gly-NMe-Phe-Gly-ol, was significantly more potent than the specific delta agonist, [D-Pen2,5]-enkephalin, at increasing spontaneous motor activity or DA metabolism in the nucleus accumbens, septum, striatum and prefrontal cortex. Further, naloxonazine, a putative antagonist of the mu-1 isoreceptor, significantly attenuated the motor-stimulant effect and increase in DA metabolism produced by intra-ventral tegmental area injection of Tyr-D-Ala-Gly-NMe-Phe-Gly-ol. It was found that the disposition of microinjected Tyr-D-Ala-Gly-NMe-Phe-Gly-ol or [D-Pen2,5]-enkephalin was not responsible for the difference in their potency. It is concluded that the mu receptor and, perhaps, the mu-1 isoreceptor mediate a major portion of the activation of A10 DA neurons previously demonstrated with mixed mu and delta opioid agonists.\r"

Norepinephrine, dopamine and serotonin (5-HT) levels were assayed in the hippocampus, hypothalamus, striatum and neocortex. In rats, MDMA produced dose-dependent reductions in 5-HT in all brain regions examined. The highest dose also reduced norepinephrine and/or dopamine in some regions. The 20-mg/kg dose of MDMA depleted 5-HT in all regions of the guinea pig brain assayed. In both species, repeated administration of 20 mg/kg of MDMA reduced the Vmax but not the Km of 5-HT uptake 2 weeks after administration. A single 40-mg/kg injection of MDMA depleted 5-HT 2 and 8 weeks after administration to rats in all regions of the brain examined except the hypothalamus. Administration of 80 mg/kg of MDMA twice a day for 2 days to rats depleted striatal 5-HT and dopamine. Brain sections from rats injected with MDMA according to this dosage regimen were stained by the Fink-Heimer method. Degenerating axon terminals and cell bodies were observed in the striatum and somatosensory cortex, respectively. These findings suggest that MDMA is toxic to serotonergic and, to a lesser extent, catecholaminergic neurons. Some neurons that do not contain these transmitters (neocortical neurons) are also affected.\r"

  ".W": "The ability of various treatments to prevent peripheral parasympathetic actions, central effects and lethality of the muscarinic agonist oxotremorine was studied in rats. The percentage of animals exhibiting effects of oxotremorine was dose and time dependent. The ED50 for producing lacrimation, salivation, tremor, convulsions and death was 2.5, 1.3, 1.6, 3.2 and 8.3 mg/kg i.p., respectively. Pretreatment with 5 mg/kg of atropine completely prevented all observable effects of oxotremorine at doses of 5 mg/kg and below. Doses of oxotremorine in excess of 5 mg/kg produced tremor, generalized clonic convulsions and death that could not be prevented by atropine when given at up to 160 mg/kg; lacrimation and salivation were not present in atropine-treated rats. In the presence of 40 mg/kg of atropine, ED50 values for oxotremorine were shifted more than 12-fold for lacrimation, salivation and tremor, whereas convulsions and death were maximally altered by a factor of 2. Scopolamine, benactyzine and benztropine were also incapable of completely preventing tremor, convulsions and death induced by 10 or 15 mg/kg of oxotremorine. Atropine methyl nitrate had effects comparable to atropine sulfate on lacrimation, salivation and lethality induced by oxotremorine (10 or 15 mg/kg) but had no effect on tremor or convulsions. A similar profile of atropine-insensitive effects was produced by pilocarpine and arecoline. Doses of diazepam 4 times higher (4 mg/kg) than necessary to prevent tonic-clonic convulsions induced by pentylenetetrazol were ineffective against tremor, convulsions or death produced by oxotremorine (10 or 15 mg/kg) unless given in conjunction with atropine.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Certain steroids are potent barbiturate-like modulators of the gamma-aminobutyric acidA (GABA) receptor-chloride ionophore complex in rat brain membranes. At nanomolar to low micromolar concentrations, these steroids stimulate [3H]flunitrazepam and [3H] muscimol binding and displace the convulsant [35S]t-butylbicyclophosphorothionate from its binding site in an allosteric manner, in addition to enhancing Cl- conductance responses to GABA recorded in cultured rat hippocampal and spinal neurons. A stringent structure-activity relationship exists for these interactions of steroids with the GABAA receptor complex. Comparison of the structure-activity relationship data obtained in this study with those for steroid-induced general anesthesia strongly suggests that steroidal anesthesia may result from the interaction between steroids and the GABAA receptor. The essential features of the active structures are a 5 alpha or 5 beta-reduced pregnane skeleton with a hydroxyl at C3 in the alpha-position and a ketone group at C20. These features are all present in some naturally occurring steroids, including metabolites of deoxycorticosterone and progesterone, that show potent activity at the GABAA receptor complex. Two of the compounds investigated are known to be formed in vivo as reduced metabolites of endogenous steroid hormones: 5 alpha-pregnane-3 alpha -ol-20-one and 5 alpha-pregnane-3 alpha,21-diol-20-one, which are derived from progesterone and deoxycorticosterone, respectively. These two steroids produce a striking prolongation of GABA-mediated inhibitory postsynaptic currents recorded at synapses between rat hippocampal neurons in culture and could conceivably regulate GABA-mediated inhibition under some physiologic and pathologic conditions.\r"

A cardiomyopathy (CM) characterized by multifocal areas of interstitial and replacement fibrosis, mixed inflammatory infiltrates and contraction band necrosis is evident 35 to 45 days after tumor implantation. Using a morphological scoring system of 0 (no cardiac damage) to 3 (involvement of almost the complete ventricular cross-section sampled), a CM score of 1.8 +/- 0.1 was found in rats harboring pheochromocytoma, a significant increase over that in age- and sex-matched controls (0.4 +/- 0.1, P less than .001). The pheochromocytoma rats also had hypertension (systolic blood pressure = 182 +/- 4 vs. 131 +/- 2 mm Hg in controls, P less than .001). In an effort to prevent the CM, rats harboring pheochromocytoma were treated with either the beta receptor antagonist timolol, the alpha receptor antagonists phentolamine or phenoxybenzamine or the nonspecific vasodilator hydralazine. Hydralazine normalized systolic blood pressure (135 +/- 6 mm Hg), whereas timolol (144 +/- 5 mm Hg), phenoxybenzamine (166 +/- 5 mm Hg) or phentolamine (154 +/- 10 mm Hg) only moderately decreased blood pressure in rats harboring pheochromocytoma. Hydralazine had no effect on CM score (1.8 +/- 0.1). Timolol markedly attenuated the CM score (0.6 +/- 0.1), whereas the alpha adrenergic antagonists were not as effective (phenoxybenzamine CM score = 1.3 +/- 0.2; phentolamine CM score = 1.7 +/- 0.2). Furthermore, timolol prevented desensitization of beta adrenergic receptor-mediated contraction in the hearts of rats harboring pheochromocytoma.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Earlier studies have suggested that the acute administration of an opiate can result in the development of supersensitive dopamine receptors. The present study was undertaken to determine whether the supersensitive dopamine receptors can modify the development of opiate tolerance and dependence. Administration of morphine (100 mg/kg s.c.) 6 or 24 hr before apomorphine (i.p.) potentiated apomorphine-induced climbing behavior in mice. Administration of levorphanol (12 mg/kg s.c.) 3 or 6 hr, but not 24 hr, before apomorphine also potentiated apomorphine-induced climbing behavior. Coadministration of 5 mEq/kg of LiCl with morphine or levorphanol attenuated the increased sensitivity developed to apomorphine after either opiate. Acute tolerance and dependence was induced by administration of 100 mg/kg of morphine or 12 mg/kg of levorphanol. Lithium enhanced the development of acute tolerance when coadministered with morphine 3, 6 or 24 hr before test doses of morphine, or with levorphanol 3 hr before test doses of levorphanol. Administration of apomorphine 5 min before naloxone significantly decreased the naloxone ED50 for inducing withdrawal jumping in mice that had been pretreated with morphine or levorphanol. Although coadministration of lithium with morphine or levorphanol had no significant effect on naloxone-induced withdrawal jumping, it attenuated the ability of apomorphine to decrease naloxone ED50. Morphine (100 mg/kg s.c.) increased the number of whole brain [3H]spiroperidol binding sites 3 and 6 hr after administration of morphine. This increase was no longer present 24 hr after morphine administration. Levorphanol (12 mg/kg s.c.) also increased the number of binding sites 3 hr after administration. Coadministration of lithium with morphine attenuated the increase in [3H]spiroperidol binding sites.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".U": "87198209\r", 
  ".W": "The ability of dopamine, ibopamine and epinine to elicit alpha adrenoceptor-mediated vasoconstriction was studied in the in situ, autoperfused pulmonary circulation of the open-chest anesthetized dog. Animals were pretreated with propranolol to eliminate beta adrenoceptor-mediated relaxation of the pulmonary vasculature. Heparinized blood was withdrawn from the left femoral artery and transferred via a peristaltic pump to the pulmonary arterial branch supplying the left diaphragmatic lobe of the lung. The flow rate of the pump was adjusted so that mean pulmonary perfusion pressure in the lobe was equal to resting diastolic pulmonary artery pressure (10 +/- 1 mm Hg). Under conditions of constant left atrial pressure and pulmonary blood flow, intralobar administration of dopamine, ibopamine and epinine elicited dose-dependent increases in perfusion pressure of the lobe, reflecting increases in pulmonary vascular resistance. Prazosin (100 micrograms/kg i.v.), a selective alpha-1 adrenoceptor antagonist, inhibited the pulmonary vasopressor responses to dopamine, ibopamine and epinine. Rauwolscine (100 micrograms/kg i.v.), a selective alpha-2 adrenoceptor antagonist, inhibited pulmonary pressor responses to dopamine and epinine without altering significantly the pulmonary vasoconstrictor response to ibopamine. These data indicate that dopamine and epinine stimulate both postjunctional vascular alpha-1 and alpha-2 adrenoceptors to elicit pulmonary vasoconstriction in the dog, whereas ibopamine, when injected directly into the pulmonary circulation, stimulates primarily postjunctional vascular alpha-1 adrenoceptors. However, when ibopamine was administered intraduodenally, both prazosin and rauwolscine were found to inhibit the resulting pulmonary vasopressor response. This finding is consistent with the hypothesis that ibopamine is converted to its active metabolite epinine, which stimulates both pulmonary vascular alpha-1 and alpha-2 adrenoceptors.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Experiments were designed to characterize pre- and postjunctional muscarinic receptors in the canine saphenous vein. In rings contracted by 2-Hz electrical stimulation, acetylcholine produced concentration-dependent relaxations that result from prejunctional inhibition of norepinephrine release from adrenergic nerve endings (prejunctional effect). In quiescent preparations, acetylcholine caused concentration-dependent contractions (postjunctional effect). Both responses to acetylcholine were inhibited in a competitive manner by atropine, pirenzepine and gallamine. The affinity of atropine for pre- and postjunctional muscarinic receptors was similar (pKB = 8.7 and 9.2, respectively). However, gallamine displayed higher affinity for the prejunctional than for the postjunctional receptor (pKB = 6.1 and 4.7, respectively), whereas the converse was true for pirenzepine (pKB = 6.5 and 8.1). The data support the presence in the canine saphenous vein of two muscarinic receptor subtypes, M1 postjunctionally and M2 prejunctionally, which are distinguishable by selective antagonists.\r"

Furthermore, it has been suggested that centrally acting beta adrenergic agonists might possess antidepressant activity. However, preclinical as well as clinical studies of the effects of beta adrenergic agonists have been limited due to the lack of compounds that penetrate into the central nervous system after peripheral administration. Recent results indicate that the beta adrenergic agonists clenbuterol and prenalterol are active centrally. For this reason, it was of interest to begin to assess their behavioral effects. It was found that clenbuterol and prenalterol, in a dose-dependent manner, reduced response rate and increased reinforcement rate under a differential-reinforcement-of-low-rate 72-sec schedule. The effects of these agonists were very similar to those of proven antidepressant drugs. The effects of the agonists clenbuterol and prenalterol, as well as the effects of the tricyclic antidepressant desipramine, on response and reinforcement rate were antagonized by the beta adrenergic antagonist propranolol. The present results indicate that clenbuterol and prenalterol are active behaviorally and that their effects appear to be mediated by beta adrenergic receptors. The similarity between the behavioral effects of the beta adrenergic agonists and those of proven antidepressant drugs provides evidence consistent with the contention that centrally acting beta adrenergic agonists might possess antidepressant activity.\r"

Behavioral effects were determined in monkeys trained to respond under a 30-response fixed-ratio (FR) schedule of food presentation; cardiovascular effects were evaluated in a separate group of unanaesthetized monkeys seated at rest. Dose-effect curves for each drug were determined by administering cumulative doses i.v. during sequential components of the experimental session. All six analogs of adenosine produced dose-related decreases in FR responding with the following order of potency: 5'N-ethylcarboxamide adenosine (NECA) greater than 2-chloroadenosine (2-CA) greater than N6-R-phenylisopropyladenosine (R-PIA) greater than N6-cyclopentyladenosine (CPA) greater than N6-cyclohexyladenosine (CHA) greater than N6-S-phenylisopropyladenosine (S-PIA). In cardiovascular studies, all drugs except CPA produced dose-related decreases in mean blood pressure (MBP) with the following order of potency: NECA greater than 2-CA = R-PIA greater than CHA greater than S-PIA. CPA did not alter MBP at doses that decreased both FR responding and heart rate (HR). All drugs except NECA produced dose-related decreases in HR with the following order of potency: CPA greater than 2-CA greater than R-PIA greater than CHA greater than S-PIA. NECA increased HR at doses that decreased MPB and FR responding. Doses of caffeine that did not alter FR responding or cardiovascular function when given alone antagonized the behavioral effects of R-PIA, CHA, CPA and NECA. Caffeine also antagonized the effects of R-PIA, CHA and NECA on MBP and the effects of R-PIA and CPA on HR.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Although metabolites of quinidine are active in animal models and can accumulate to plasma levels similar to those of quinidine during chronic therapy, their effects on cardiac transmembrane action potentials have not been reported. We therefore examined the effects of quinidine, its major metabolites, 3-hydroxyquinidine, quinidine-N-oxide, O-desmethylquinidine, and 2'-oxoquinidinone, and a common commercial impurity, dihydroquinidine, on action potentials from canine Purkinje fibers. Using standard microelectrode techniques, measurements at stimulation basic cycle lengths (BCLs) of 300 to 8000 msec were made at base line and repeated after a 1 hr of superfusion with a 10 microM concentration of drug or vehicle controls. Vehicle controls (n = 5) produced no change in maximum phase 0 upstoke slope of the action potential (Vmax) or action potential duration at 90% repolarization (APD90). Vmax depression when present was greatest at short BCL with statistically significant changes seen at BCL = 300 msec with all compounds tested except quinidine-N-oxide. The time constants for the onset of and recovery from frequency-dependent Vmax depression were similar to those of quinidine. In contrast, changes in APD90 were greatest at long BCL, with significant prolongation seen with all drugs at BCL = 4000 msec. In addition, the agents prolonging repolarization to the greatest extent, quinidine, dihydroquinidine, 3-hydroxyquinidine and O-desmethylquinidine, caused early afterdepolarizations at long BCL. We conclude that these metabolites and dihydroquinidine may contribute to the antiarrhythmic and/or arrhythmogenic effects of quinidine therapy.\r"

Steady-state 45Ca++ uptake increased with K+ concentration in a dose-dependent manner. With 25 to 50 mM K+, Ca++ uptake was 0.6 nmol of Ca++ per one million cells. All calcium channel blockers inhibited K+-induced 45Ca++ uptake and [3H]nitrendipine binding in a dose-dependent fashion. The enatiomeric dihydropyridines 202-791 [isopropyl-4-(2,1,3-benzoxadiazol-4-yl)-1,4-dihydro-2, 6-dimethyl-5-nitro-3-pyridinecarboxylate] exhibited marked stereoselectivity in both studies, the agonist (+)-202-791 significantly enhancing 45Ca++ uptake at 15 to 50 mM K+. The similarity between the order of potency in inhibiting 45Ca++ uptake and displacing [3H]nitrendipine resulted in a highly significant linear (1:1) correlation. An equally significant correlation was also established for the 10 blockers between their inhibitory potencies on 45Ca++ uptake and the contractile response of rabbit aortic strips as cited in the literature. These findings support the hypothesis that calcium channel blockers block contraction of vascular muscle by inhibiting cellular calcium uptake through voltage-dependent calcium channels as a result of binding to receptors associated with these channels. The aortic cells possess channels that are functionally similar to those found in intact vascular tissue.\r"

WHR1582A was active in preclinical ulcer models induced by 18-hr pylorus ligation, aspirin, indomethacin, reserpine, stress or cysteamine. WHR1582A inhibited acid secretion in the pylorus-ligated rat and in the anesthetized, lumen-perfused rat. The antisecretory effects of WHR1582A were antagonized by yohimbine, RX781094A and phentolamine. Propranolol, prazosin, corynanthine, methysergide, sulpiride and pimozide were unable to block its activity. WHR1582A blocked acid secretion stimulated by 2-deoxy-D-glucose but was inactive against the direct parietal cell stimulants carbachol and dimaprit. WHR1582A also inhibited electrically stimulated contractions that were mediated via the vagus in the isolated rat stomach preparation. The antisecretory activity of WHR1582A was not due to a reduction in gastric mucosal blood flow. These results demonstrate that WHR1582A is an effective antiulcer-antisecretory agent that exerts its gastric effects through the activation of alpha-2 adrenoceptors located presynapitcally on the vagus.\r"

  ".W": "Experiments were performed in order to characterize the post-junctional alpha adrenoceptors that mediate contraction in arteries of human limbs. Blood vessels were obtained from patients undergoing amputation of an extremity for reasons other than vascular disease. Proximal (dorsalis pedis and arcuate arteries of the foot, superficial palmer arch of the hand) and distal (digital arteries of the foot and hand) blood vessels were studied from each limb. The blood vessels were removed within 60 min of amputation and were suspended for isometric tension recording in modified Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate solution. In proximal and distal arteries, alpha-1 adrenergic blockade with prazosin produced a nonparallel shift in the concentration-effect curve to high compared to low concentrations of the agonist. In contrast, alpha-2 adrenergic blockade with rauwolscine was more effective against responses evoked by low concentrations of norepinephrine. This suggests that the alpha-2 adrenergic component of the response to norepinephrine is a low-maximum effect compared to the alpha-1 adrenergic component. Prazosin was less potent and rauwolscine more potent in distal arteries, compared to proximal arteries which might indicate an increased alpha-2 adrenergic response in distal arteries. The selective alpha-1 adrenergic agonist, phenylephrine, produced similar responses in proximal and distal arteries. However, the selective alpha-2 adrenergic agonist, B-HT 920, caused greater contractile responses in distal arteries compared to proximal arteries. The results suggest that alpha-1 and alpha-2 adrenoceptors are present on the vascular smooth muscle of arteries of human limbs, and that alpha-2 adrenoceptors are more prominent on distal arteries. This may be related to an increased contribution of the distal arteries to thermoregulation.\r"

When coronary rings with intact endothelium were pretreated for 60 min with 10 or 100 nM (-)-R202-791, the contraction to subsequent addition of (+)-S202-791 was significantly greater than in control tissues pretreated with only solvent. However, in rings with denuded endothelium, pretreatment with (-)-R202-791 resulted in a rightward shift of the dose-response curve to (+)-S202-791, and a depression of the maximal contraction compared with controls. Thus, the interaction between the calcium agonist [(+)-S202-791] and antagonist [(-)-R202-791] is more complex than competitive inhibition. We suggest that the calcium agonists produce two effects, a release of endothelium-derived relaxant factor and a direct contraction of smooth muscle; the calcium antagonists can inhibit both processes.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The authors studied the pharmacokinetic properties of this drug in normal volunteers and patients with Cushing's syndrome using a rat progesterone radioreceptor assay. This assay gave values similar to those obtained with a rat glucocorticoid radioreceptor assay. After a single oral dose of 25 mg/kg (n = 11) or 10 mg/kg (n = 11) to normal volunteers, plasma concentrations of progesterone receptor-reactive material reached maximal levels of 754 +/- 288 (mean +/- S.D.) and 517 +/- 183 micrograms/dl. This occurred at 3.1 +/- 1.9 and 2.5 +/- 1.0 h, respectively. The respective apparent plasma half-lives were 19.2 +/- 7.0 and 20.6 +/- 7.7 h. Four patients with Cushing's syndrome treated chronically (10-20 mg/kg/day) had relatively constant plasma levels of receptor reactivity ranging from 506 to 1184 micrograms/dl. Chromatographic characterization of circulating receptor reactivity showed that the active fraction corresponded to RU 486 and its hydrophilic N-mono- and N-didemethylated metabolites. Less than 0.5% of the daily dose was excreted in the urine of two of these patients as receptor reactivity. The drug bound extensively to circulating albumin, which competed with the glucocorticoid receptor of intact human mononuclear leukocytes for [3H]RU 486 in a concentration-dependent manner.\r"

At the adenosine A-1 receptor labeled with [3H]cyclohexyladenosine, CGS 15943A had an IC50 value of 20 nM. At the striatal A-2 receptor labeled with [3H]5'-N-ethylcarboxamidoadenosine in the presence of a low concentration of cyclopentyladenosine to block A-1 receptors labeled by this nonselective adenosine agonist, CGS 15943A had an IC50 value of 3 nM, indicating that the compound had some degree of selectivity for the A-2 receptor. Analysis of the effect of the compound on the saturation isotherms for each of the receptors indicated that it was a competitive antagonist at the brain A-1 receptor but that it was noncompetitive at the striatal A-2 receptor. CGS 15943A was a potent adenosine antagonist in the adenosine-stimulated adenylate cyclase system in guinea pig synaptoneurosomes, where the compound was found to have an IC50 value of 30 to 70 nM against the increase in cyclic AMP evoked by 5 microM adenosine. CGS 15943A had no effect on the binding of [3H]nitrobenzylthioinosine, a ligand thought to bind to adenosine uptake sites, and, at a concentration of 10 microM, had no effect on beef heart type III phosphodiesterase activity.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Muscarinic receptor-stimulated phosphoinositide hydrolysis was investigated in rat brain during ontogeny by measuring the accumulation of [3H]inositol phosphates ([3H]InsPs) in cerebral cortex slices at various ages. Experiments with carbachol and acetylcholine showed that [3H]InsPs accumulation was maximal in 7-day-old rats (1477 +/- 98% of basal) and lowest in adult (75 days) rats (428 +/- 24% of basal). No differences were found in the EC50 values for both cholinergic agonists. This effect appeared to be mediated by the M1-muscarinic receptor subtype as it was blocked by pirenzepine with Ki = 29.1 +/- 7.1 nM (adults) and 87.9 +/- 18.2 nM (7-day-old rats). Incorporation of [3H]inositol into phospholipid decreased from day 3 to adulthood; however, when data of [3H]InsPs release were corrected for the incorporation at a given age, the highest stimulation by cholinergic agonists was still observed in 7-day-old rats. Among the other neurotransmitters tested (norepinephrine, histamine and serotonin), all known to stimulate phosphoinositide metabolism, none had the same developmental profile of [3H]InsPs accumulation as cholinergic agonists. In contrast to carbachol- and acetylcholine-stimulated phosphoinositide hydrolysis, the density of muscarinic binding sites, measured by [3H]quinuclidinyl benzilate binding, increased from day 3 to day 75. Acetylcholinesterase activity also increased during development. The dissociation of receptor binding sites from receptor-stimulated phosphoinositide metabolism suggests the presence of a more effective receptor-effector coupling at specific times of neonatal development, particularly 1 week. Furthermore, the fact that maximal stimulation of phosphoinositide hydrolysis coincides with the period of brain growth spurt in the rats suggests that this system in the cerebral cortex might be involved in the processes of cell division and differentiation.\r"

Hypoxia was induced in male Sprague-Dawley rats by placing them in a hypobaric chamber at 0.42 atmospheres for 6 and 12 hr. Serum levels of erythropoietin were measured by the exhypoxic polycythemic mouse bioassay and a sensitive radioimmunoassay for erythropoietin. Verapamil (5, 10 and 20 mg/kg i.p.) produced significant increases in mean serum erythropoietin levels after 6 and 12 hr of hypoxia, which was significantly higher than those of saline-injected hypoxic control rats. Mean arterial blood pressure values in rats injected with 5 and 10 mg/kg of verapamil were not significantly different from the preinjection controls when measured at ambient pressure over a 12-hr period. A dosage of 20 mg/kg of verapamil i.p. in rats produced a significant decrease in mean arterial pressure between 5 and 30 min after injection but was not significantly different from the vehicle controls between 30 min and 12 hr postinjection. In conclusion, the calcium entry blocker verapamil enhanced erythropoietin production in response to hypoxia. Thus, it is postulated that calcium plays a significant role in erythropoietin production and/or release.\r"

In addition, serial blood samples were withdrawn to determine trimoprostil plasma concentrations. Trimoprostil was absorbed rapidly and eliminated with T1/2 ranging from 25 to 37 min. Trimoprostil was effective in inhibiting acid output compared with control. The maximal response and duration of activity were dependent on the concentration-time profile of trimoprostil. Trimoprostil produced a maximum inhibition of 98% and suppressed acid output for at least 3 hr. When plasma concentrations were related to the antisecretory response using a modified Hill equation, the response was found to lag behind plasma concentrations as evidenced by hysteresis loops. The predicted plasma concentration associated with a 50% inhibition of acid secretion (IC50) ranged from 0.58 to 0.79 ng/ml.\r"

The stimulatory effect of nicotine on these stress responsive hormones desensitizes after a single injection of nicotine. Continuous exposure to nicotine also induces tolerance to its locomotor depressive and hypothermic effects, which have been associated with an increase of central [3H]nicotine binding. Thus, the acute and chronic administration of nicotine might induce changes in central nicotinic cholinergic circuits that affect the ACTH and PRL responses to stress. In the present study, a single dose of nicotine (0.75-3.0 mg/kg b.wt.) significantly inhibited the elevation of plasma PRL due to restraint stress initiated 60 min afterward. Five injections of nicotine during 1 day produced a similar attenuation of the PRL response to restraint stress but neither of these paradigms affected ACTH. In contrast, intermittent delivery of nicotine for 7 days failed to affect the PRL response to restraint stress; however, after withholding nicotine for 14 hr, high dose nicotine attenuated the PRL response to stress, whereas low dose nicotine remained ineffective. On the other hand, administration of the same schedule of low dose nicotine did significantly diminish the expected release of PRL in response to a final injection of nicotine (0.5-2.0 mg/kg b.wt.) in unstressed animals. In summary, a single dose or 5 doses of nicotine in 1 day attenuated the PRL response to restraint stress, whereas, after chronic administration, this effect was lost.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

These METH-induced increases in NTLI concentrations were attenuated by coadministration of haloperidol in the substantia nigra, hypothalamus and hippocampus, indicating a possible involvement of dopamine receptors in these tissues. In the striatum haloperidol alone produced significant increases in NTLI levels; these increases were additive with those induced by METH treatment demonstrating that the neurotensin pathways associated with the striatum are regulated differently from that of the other brain areas examined. The implications of these findings to the relationship between dopamine and neurotensin transmitter systems are discussed.\r"

The sensitivity is increased to isoproterenol, norepinephrine, 5'-guanylylimidodiphosphate and forskolin, and the maximum response is increased to the partial agonist albuterol. These results, coupled with data in the literature, suggest that adaptive supersensitivity in the guinea pig heart is due to a change in one or more of the components of the adenylate cyclase system that is specifically coupled to beta adrenoceptors. The results indicate that the supersensitivity is demonstrable when the concentration-response curves for agonists are determined in isolated whole left atria but not when they are determined in strips cut from left atria. This explains a discrepancy in the literature. It is suggested that cellular changes, possibly in electrolyte distribution, resulting from the additional manipulation of cutting the atria into slices obscure the sensitivity difference between the control and experimental tissues.\r"

Mono- and dimethoxysubstituted tolazolines produced contractile responses which, at their maximum, were 27 to 100% of the response produced by the full agonist phenylephrine. In addition to differences in maximum response, contraction kinetics varied between full and partial agonists. Responses to partial agonists displayed a slower approach to peak tension and loss of the rapid phase of tension development which is associated with release of intracellular Ca++. Among the tolazoline series 3,5 dimethoxy-, 3 methoxy-, and 2 methoxy derivatives were compared further with phenylephrine for their ability to cause phosphatidylinositol cycle turnover, intracellular Ca++ release and Ca++ influx. For each of these coupling events, a rank of phenylephrine greater than or equal to 3, 5 greater than 3 greater than 2 was observed. However, a higher percentage of Ca++ influx vs. Ca++ release was observed for the partial agonists, suggesting that their contractile responses may be more dependent upon extracellular Ca++ than intracellular Ca++. Our results indicate that partial agonists initiate the same coupling events as full agonists; however, the relative proportion of Ca++ release and influx may be different for partial agonists because of the reduced rate of second messenger production.\r"

In fact, 5-OH-kynurenamine was an agonist at 5-HT2 receptors in the rat jugular vein and aorta, at 5-HT3 (neuronal \"M\") receptors in the guinea pig ileum and at 5-HT receptors in the rat stomach fundus. Maximal contractile responses to 5-OH-kynurenamine in these three smooth muscle preparations were similar to those produced by 5-HT, although 5-OH-kynurenamine was approximately 10- to 100-fold less potent than 5-HT as a contractile agonist. Using appropriate antagonists, LY53857 as a selective antagonist at 5-HT2 receptors, ICS 205-930 as a selective antagonist at 5-HT3 receptors and 1-(1-napthyl) piperazine as a potent antagonist in the rat stomach fundus, we documented further that the contractile responses to 5-OH-kynurenamine resulted from its interaction with 5-HT receptors in these tissues. Kynuramine did not contract either the rat jugular vein, aorta or the guinea pig ileum, although a contractile response did occur in the rat stomach fundus (maximal response approximately 70% of the maximal contractile response to 5-HT). High concentrations of kynuramine (10(-4) M) produced modest inhibition and reduction in maximal responses to 5-HT in the jugular vein, aorta and guinea pig ileum.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

At 16 hr after in vitro topical application (10 micrograms/2 cm2), the extent of permeation of the selected steroids was testosterone (65.13%) much greater than cortisol (18.1%) = estradiol (18.0%) greater than estrone (10.58%) much greater than estriol (2.45%). Permeation was accompanied by cutaneous first pass metabolism. In addition to water-soluble metabolites, other metabolites found in the perfusion medium from topical testosterone included 5 alpha-dihydrotestosterone, 5 alpha-androstanedione and androstenedione. Cortisone was identified as one of the metabolites of topical cortisol. For the estrogens, estradiol and estriol were metabolites of topical estrone, whereas estrone and estriol were metabolites of topical estradiol. The extent of cutaneous first pass metabolism of these selected steroids varies considerably. Estrone was metabolized extensively, but only limited metabolism of estradiol and cortisol was observed during their translocation through the skin. With testosterone, it was evident that an increase in the topically applied dose was accompanied by a decrease in the relative extent of both permeation and cutaneous first pass metabolism. However, cutaneous first pass metabolism of estriol was essentially negligible. These observations demonstrated that both diffusional and metabolic processes are important in the percutaneous fate of topical steroids. They also suggest that in future studies concerned with the absorption and bioavailability of topically applied chemicals, an assessment of the drug-metabolizing capabilities of the skin needs to be considered.\r"

Subjects received oral theophylline (510 mg/day) for 14 days and cimetidine (1200 mg/day) during days 1 to 7 or 8 to 14. On days 7 and 14, a tracer dose (10 mg i.v.) of stable isotope-labeled theophylline was administered with the oral dose of theophylline. Plasma clearance in old nonsmokers was 33% less than in young nonsmokers. Values in both young and old smokers were not significantly different but exceeded those in non-smokers. Because volume of distribution was similar in all groups, the half-lives were prolonged in proportion to the decrease in clearance. Although smoking was associated with selective induction of the formation of 3-methylxanthine and 1-methyluric acid, the effect of cimetidine was nonselective and the proportionate inhibitory effects of cimetidine on theophylline metabolism did not differ with age or smoking status. The excretion of 6 beta-hydroxycortisol was similar in smokers and non-smokers but was slightly inhibited by cimetidine. Cimetidine also reduced the interindividual variation in the absorption of theophylline. Despite a reduction in the basal oxidative capacity in healthy male nonsmokers, these results indicate that both the induction of theophylline metabolism by smoking and the inhibition of theophylline metabolism by cimetidine are preserved in old age.\r"

For contractions, the rank order of agonist potency was alpha, beta-methylene-ATP much greater than ATP greater than ADP. For endothelium-dependent relaxation, the order was 2-methylthio-ATP greater than ADP greater than ATP much greater than alpha, beta-methylene-ATP (the latter causing no relaxation), suggesting two different subtypes of the P2-purinoceptors in these tissues. alpha, beta-Methylene-ATP could be used like an antagonist in the saphenous vein because it desensitizes receptors; exposure to it prevented contractions to ADP or ATP, but did not inhibit relaxations to them in the coronary artery. Reactive blue 2, from 2 X 10(-6) to 2 X 10(-5) M, behaved as a competitive antagonist of relaxations of the coronary artery induced by ADP and 2-methylthio-ATP; it did not inhibit contraction of the saphenous vein by alpha, beta-methylene-ATP. It antagonized slightly the endothelium-dependent relaxation of the coronary artery to acetylcholine, but not that to the calcium ionophore A23187. In contrast, methylene blue, a functional antagonist of endothelium-dependent relaxations, caused noncompetitive antagonism of relaxation to the same agonists. Thus, different subtypes of P2-purinoceptors on canine vascular smooth muscle and endothelium can be distinguished on the basis not only of the potencies of a series of agonists, but by two antagonists which discriminate between them.\r"

  ".W": "Volatile inhalants represent a diverse group of chemicals which pose a public health problem because of their abuse potential and neurobehavioral toxicity. Although relatively little is known about their pharmacology, they share certain pharmacological properties with classic central nervous system depressants. Drug discrimination procedures were used to compare the effects produced by pentobarbital (PB), oxazepam and several inhalants. Mice were trained to discriminate PB from saline injections in a two-lever operant task. Stimulus generalization was examined after 20-min inhalation exposures to halothane (500-8000 ppm), 1,1,1-trichloroethane (500-12000 ppm), isoamyl nitrite (150-1050 ppm), flurothyl (562-1300 ppm) and injections of oxazepam (0.1-20 mg/kg). Halothane, 1,1,1-trichloroethane and oxazepam produced discriminative stimulus effects similar to those produced by PB. Isoamyl nitrite and flurothyl, while decreasing rates of responding, were not consistently generalized from PB. Differences are apparent in the PB-like discriminative effects of inhalants. Toluene, as shown in a previous study, as well as halothane and 1,1,1-trichloroethane have PB-like discriminative effects which are also shared by oxazepam and may be another common effect of central nervous system depressants. Other chemicals, like isoamyl nitrite and flurothyl, are representative of qualitatively different classes of behaviorally active inhalants.\r"

  ".W": "The present studies examine some of the pharmacological effects of delta-9 (11)-tetrahydrocannabinol (delta 9-11-THC), an analog of delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (delta 9-THC). In tests with mice, delta 9-11-THC was similar to but less potent than delta 9-THC in producing hypothermia, analgesia, lethality and in reducing spontaneous activity. In dogs delta 9-THC but not delta 9-11-THC produced classical cannabimimetic signs including static ataxia, hyperreflexia, prancing and tail-tuck. delta 9-11-THC did produce central nervous system depression in 9 of the 15 dogs tested but the effects were not dose-related and appeared earlier and dissipated faster than the depressive effects induced by delta 9-THC. delta 9-THC but not delta 9-11-THC produced signs of ptosis, sedation and ataxia in rhesus monkeys. delta 9-THC also suppressed operant responding completely in four of four monkeys tested whereas in one monkey delta 9-11-THC did not do so up to doses as high as 5.0 mg/kg and was 8 to 100 times less potent in doing so in the other monkeys. When monkeys were pretreated with delta 9-11-THC the doses of delta 9-THC required to produce ptosis, sedation, ataxia and operant suppression were increased. However, when mice and dogs were pretreated with delta 9-11-THC the effects of delta 9-THC were not attenuated and usually were enhanced. The pharmacological profile of delta 9-11-THC is unusual in that it seems to have cannabimimetic activity in mice, noncannabimimetic-like effects in dogs and is perhaps devoid of cannabimimetic effects in rhesus monkeys. In addition, pretreatment with delta 9-11-THC attenuates the cannabimimetic effects of delta 9-THC in rhesus monkeys but not in mice or dogs.\r"

We have developed an avidin biotin-amplified competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to detect protein-bound acetaminophen. This assay utilizes antisera from rabbits immunized with 3-(N-acetyl-L-cystein-S-yl)acetaminophen coupled via the carboxyl group to primary amino groups on the protein keyhole-limpet hemocyanin. The competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay utilizes metallothionein derivatized with N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine (acetaminophen-bound metallothionein) and quantitation was obtained by competition of acetaminophen-derivatives for a limited amount of antibody in the presence of excess solid phase acetaminophen-bound metallothionein. Synthetic 3-(N-acetyl-L-cystein-S-yl)acetaminophen, acetaminophen bound to mouse 9,000 X g supernatant, 100,000 X g supernatant, microsomes, as well as acetaminophen-bound metallothionein were inhibitory. The 50% inhibition for 3-(N-acetyl-L-cystein-S-yl)acetaminophen was 110 fmol/well. In contrast, free acetaminophen was 6200 times less efficient as an inhibitor. The mean 50% inhibition for protein-bound acetaminophen was 2.89 pmol/well. The utility of the method to detect acetaminophen-protein adducts in biological samples was confirmed by detection of NADPH-dependent binding of acetaminophen to microsomal proteins.\r"

Tissues were incubated with desipramine or reserpine to determine the effects of blockade of neuronal uptake and of interference with vesicular translocation of NE. Radioactive NE appeared to distribute differently from endogenous NE into at least two pools, but for the most part endogenous NE and DHPG behaved similarly in response to pharmacological manipulations. Desipramine blocked completely the increased appearance of both radioactive and endogenous DHPG in the medium during electrical stimulation or K+ stimulation; DHPG responses to stimulation are thus dependent on recapture of NE at the synapse. Basal release of DHPG was increased by reserpine, and this increase was not affected by desipramine; therefore, reserpine-induced release of DHPG is independent of neuronal uptake consistent with formation of DHPG from NE leaking into the cytosol from vesicular stores. Reserpine enhanced the release of DHPG during stimulation, and concomitant desipramine treatment blocked this effect; thus, interference with NE translocation into storage vesicles increases the availability of recaptured NE for intraneuronal metabolism. During stimulation of NE release between 70 to 80% of the recaptured NE was estimated to be sequestered into storage vesicles for rerelease. Combined measurement of endogenous and labeled NE and DHPG provides a useful tool for examining neuronal uptake and intraneuronal disposition of NE.\r"

SK&F 102698 [1-(3,5-difluorobenzyl)imidazole-2-thiol] is the prototype molecule of this class of substituted 1-benzylimidazole-2-thiols and is one of the most potent inhibitors of DBH yet described. After acute p.o. administration in conscious unrestrained SHR, SK&F 102698 elicited a dose-dependent decrease in mean arterial blood pressure. The antihypertensive effect was marked by a gradual onset with long duration of activity. The antihypertensive effect produced by SK&F 102698 was accompanied by bradycardia. SK&F 102698 inhibited DBH in vivo as demonstrated by its ability to increase vascular levels of dopamine (DA) while concomitantly decreasing vascular levels of norepinephrine (NE), thus increasing the overall DA/NE ratio. The chronic cardiovascular effects of SK&F 102698 were evaluated in developing SHR. SHR were administered SK&F 102698 p.o. once daily for 9 weeks beginning when animals were 4 weeks of age. SK&F 102698 (50 mg/kg) significantly attenuated the development of hypertension of these SHR. Tolerance to the chronic effects of DBH inhibition was not observed and blood pressures in drug-treated animals were still reduced significantly 20 hr after drug administration. Vascular catecholamine levels were determined in the mesenteric artery of these chronically treated animals. Vascular DA levels were increased 290%, vascular NE levels were decreased 36% and the DA/NE ratio was increased 520%, as compared to controls. Furthermore, hearts weights of SHR receiving SK&F 102698 were approximately 10% lower than controls. The present study demonstrates that in SHR SK&F 102698 is an effective antihypertensive whose effects are mediated by the novel mechanism of DBH inhibition.\r"

  ".W": "Phospholipase activation has been proposed as one relevant biochemical step toward irreversible myocardial injury during ischemia. Accordingly, after coronary artery occlusion, the time course of myocardial phospholipid degradation was studied in 83 control rats and 84 rats treated with quinacrine (75 mg/kg s.c. every 8 hr), a phospholipase inhibitor. Animals were sacrificed at different times ranging from 2 to 48 hr postocclusion. In controls a rapid fall in left ventricular phospholipid concentration (from 1.33 +/- 0.12 to 0.67 +/- 0.05 micrograms of P/mg of protein) and creatinkinase (CK) activity (from 9.84 +/- 0.49 to 6.93 +/- 0.60 I.U./mg of protein) was observed within 4 hr postocclusion. In quinacrine-treated animals phospholipids and CK also fell initially; however, 24 and 48 hr after occlusion they were higher than in controls (phospholipids: 0.99 +/- 0.05 vs. 0.62 +/- 0.04 micrograms of P/mg of protein, P less than .001; CK: 7.76 +/- 0.54 vs. 4.99 +/- 0.37 I.U./mg of protein, P less than .001, at 48 hr). Additional rats surviving coronary occlusion were divided randomly into a control (n = 14) and three treated groups receiving quinacrine every 8 hr at the dose of 5 (n = 13), 20 (n = 13) or 75 mg/kg (n = 15); 13 rats were sham-operated. Forty-eight hours postocclusion myocardial phospholipids were measured and infarct size calculated by CK depletion. Infarct size was significantly smaller in high dose quinacrine-treated than in control rats (16.6 +/- 5.7 vs. 42.1 +/- 4.4% of left ventricle, P less than .001). In treated animals, myocardial phospholipid concentration was also significantly higher.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

N-alpha-Acetyl-(2-0-methyltyrosine)-OXT and (penicillamine1-2-0-methyltyrosine)- lysine8-vasopressin, both OXT receptor antagonists, facilitated the development of a moderate morphine tolerance. The i.c.v. injection of either antagonist prevented the effects of i.c.v. and s.c. OXT treatment on the development of tolerance. The effect of desglycinamide9-OXT, but not that of Z-prolyl-D-leucine was also prevented by N-alpha-acetyl-(2-0-methyltyrosine)-OXT. It is concluded that OXT and desglycinamide9-OXT, but not Z-prolyl-D-leucine, attenuate morphine tolerance by affecting putative oxytocinergic binding sites in the mouse brain. The fact that i.c.v. injection of the receptor antagonist also blocked the effect of s.c. OXT treatment argues in favor of the possibility that a minor proportion of s.c. OXT (or behaviorally active fragments thereof) may reach central nervous system target sites.\r"

Chlordecone (10-50 microM) increased [Ca++]i from the resting level of 370 nM in a dose- and time-dependent manner to above 1.5 microM. This took place in the presence of 1 mM extrasynaptosomal Ca++ but not in nominally Ca++-free medium. Verapamil, a voltage sensitive Ca++ channel blocker, inhibited the initial increase of [Ca++]i caused by chlordecone, by 40%. Chlordecone also elevated [Ca++]i in synaptosomes in which mitochondrial Ca++ uptake had been abolished by valinomycin. Chlordecone depolarized partially the synaptosomal plasma membrane and, to a lesser extent, the potential of mitochondria within synaptosomes. However, chlordecone appeared to inhibit synaptosomal K+-stimulated and unstimulated 45Ca++ uptake by 20 to 30%. Inasmuch as chlordecone also stimulated release of 45Ca++ and the fluorescent dye fura-2 from preloaded synaptosomes, the apparent inhibition of uptake might be due to lysis of some synaptosomes by chlordecone. The effect of chlordecone on [Ca++]i decreased when the total amount of tissue in incubations was increased. [Ca++]i was only elevated marginally by mirex at the same concentration range. The results suggest that chlordecone increases free intrasynaptosomal Ca++ mainly by increasing influx of extrasynaptosomal Ca++. The principal mechanism appears to be a nonspecific leakage of Ca++ through the plasma membrane but some Ca++ may pass through voltage-sensitive Ca++ channels due to chlordecone-induced membrane depolarization.\r"

HA (0.09-180 nmol) increased dose-dependently the plasma glucose level, 30 min after the injection. Even a low dose of 0.45 nmol produced a significant effect. The pretreatment with metoprine, an inhibitor of HA-N-methyltransferase, heightened the peak of the hyperglycemic response markedly and prolonged the duration. Systemic administration of the H1-receptor antagonists mepyramine (0.5-2 mg/kg), chlorpheniramine (1-4 mg/kg) and promethazine (1-4 mg/kg), inhibited dose-dependently the HA-induced hyperglycemia, whereas an H2-receptor antagonist, cimetidine (80 nmol i.c.v.), was without effect. The hyperglycemic response to HA disappeared in bilaterally adrenalectomized mice. Although the treatment of mice with metyrapone reduced the plasma corticosterone level to less than 15% of the control value, the hyperglycemic response to HA was still observed. After the administration of HA, there was a significant elevation of plasma norepinephrine levels. Increase in the plasma epinephrine was more marked than the norepinephrine response. Pretreatment with phentolamine (5 mg/kg i.p.) but not propranolol (15 mg/kg i.p.) inhibited the HA-induced hyperglycemia by about 50% and the combination of same doses of phentolamine and propranolol blocked the response completely. These results suggest that the central hyperglycemic effect of HA is produced mainly by an increase in the sympathetic outflow, followed by an increase in catecholamine secretion from the adrenal medulla. It is likely that the stimulation of H1, but not H2, receptors in the brain is involved in this response.\r"

  ".W": "The characteristics of the transport of cefixime, a new p.o. cephalosporin, antibiotic, were studied by using brush-border membrane vesicles from the rat small intestine. The initial rate of uptake of cefixime was not affected by the presence of an inward gradient of either Na+ or other monovalent cations. With an intravesicular pHi of 7.5, optimal cefixime uptake occurred at an extravesicular pHo of 5.0, with about 6-fold acceleration compared with that in the absence of an inward proton gradient (pHi = pHo = 7.5). A protonophore, carbonyl-cyanide-4-trifluoromethoxy-phenylhydrazone, abolished the stimulating effect of low pHo. In the presence of a sufficient inward proton gradient (pHi = 7.5, pHo = 5.0), cefixime uptake showed an overshoot phenomenon and apparent saturation kinetics expressed by the Michaelis-Menten equation with the maximum rate of 2.67 +/- 0.06 nmol/30 sec/mg of protein and a Michaelis constant of 0.83 +/- 0.04 mM. Cefixime uptake was inhibited competitively by glycyl-L-proline and stimulated by the countertransport effect of this dipeptide. The other peptides also inhibited cefixime uptake significantly. A valinomycin-induced inside-negative K+-diffusion potential had a dramatic reducing effect on the uptake of dianionic cefixime. All the data obtained in this study demonstrate that cefixime transport across the brush-border membrane vesicles is carrier-mediated, independent of Na+ and dependent on a H+ gradient via the peptide transport systems.\r"

The results of this study demonstrate that proglumide has both prophylactic and curative effects on various experimentally induced ulcers. It produced a dose-dependent inhibition of gastric secretion in the pylorus-ligated rats and reduced significantly the intensity of gastric lesions induced by pyloric ligation, hypothermic restraint stress, acetic acid, mucosal damaging agents and that of duodenal ulcers induced by cysteamine. The intensity of gastric lesions induced by nonsteroid anti-inflammatory drugs and reserpine was also reduced significantly by proglumide. Cimetidine, which was used as a standard antiulcer drug for comparison, also produced a similar protective effect in most of the models used by us. It was found to have a more potent antisecretory effect but failed to protect the rats against the gastric mucosal damage induced by hyperthermic restraint stress and 0.2 M NaOH. Our findings suggest that proglumide exerts these antiulcer effects by its antisecretory, gastric mucosal resistance increasing and cytoprotective activities. Further studies are required to find out its exact mechanism of action and therapeutic usefulness.\r"

  ".W": "Phenytoin pharmacokinetics exhibit large intersubject differences and coinheritance of phenytoin metabolism with known drug hydroxylation polymorphisms was therefore suspected. To study the inherited enzymatic mechanisms underlying phenytoin disposition in humans, we have investigated the rate and the stereochemical course of aromatic phenytoin hydroxylation in subjects with and without genetic drug hydroxylation deficiencies for mephenytoin or debrisoquine. For the separate analysis of S- and R-enantiomers of 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-5-phenylhydantoin (HPPH; the major phenytoin metabolite), a chiral ligand exchange chromatography system was used. The S-enantiomer of HPPH was the major urinary phenytoin metabolite irrespective of the various drug hydroxylation phenotypes studied. By contrast, the formation of the HPPH R-enantiomer was significantly decreased in poor metabolizer phenotypes of mephenytoin leading to a bimodal distribution of the urinary HPPH S/R-ratio in humans which was correlated closely with the mephenytoin hydroxylation index. Thus, HPPH S/R-values greater than 40 are likely to occur in S-mephenytoin hydroxylation-deficient phenotypes. Analysis of HPPH S/R-ratios in urine samples in a population of 122 randomly selected epileptic patients under chronic phenytoin treatment showed that product-stereoselective aromatic phenytoin hydroxylation is preserved after chronic drug administration. In subjects with and without genetic S-mephenytoin hydroxylation deficiency, extensive HPPH formation was confirmed by a pronounced NIH-shift of the tritium isotope during the product-stereoselective hydroxylation of the pro-S phenyl ring of phenytoin. Substrate-stereoselective glucuronidation of R- and S-HPPH (and related enantiomeric hydantoin metabolites) could be excluded based on identical urinary excretion of p.o. administered pure metabolite enantiomers.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In \"in vitro\" and \"in vivo\" experiments, AF-DX 116 behaved as a competitive antagonist and exhibited a selectivity for cardiac muscarinic-mediated functions. It antagonized negative chronotropic and inotropic effects exerted by muscarinic receptor activation in the guinea pig atria with an affinity (pA2) 10-fold greater than that estimated in intestinal and tracheal smooth muscle preparations. It also reversed the negative chronotropic effect induced by peripheral vagal stimulation, intrasinus node injection of bethanechol and central vagal activation by clonidine. In all these in vivo functions, AF-DX 116 was approximately 10 times less potent than atropine, while being several hundred-fold less potent in antagonizing acetylcholine-mediated bronchoconstriction and gastric emptying. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that the cardiac muscarinic receptors constitute a subclass of the M2 subtype.\r"

  ".W": "Transcortical dialysis in awake unrestrained rats has been used to evaluate the functional role of differently located alpha-2 adrenoceptors in mediating the action of the alpha-2 adrenoceptor antagonist idazoxan on cerebral noradrenaline release. Basal efflux of noradrenaline collected by a cortically implanted dialysis fiber was stable over a period of 4 days. Systemic injections of idazoxan (20 mg/kg i.p.) increased cortical noradrenaline efflux. This effect was potentiated by pretreatment with the noradrenaline uptake blocker desipramine (20 mg/kg i.p.). Local cortical infusion of (10(-4) M idazoxan which provides a theoretical extracellular administration of 4 to 48 microM) via the dialysis fiber, thus eliminating the potential contribution of somatodendritic alpha-2 adrenoceptors, also elevated cortical noradrenaline efflux. Desipramine (20 mg/kg i.p.) potentiated this effect. Four days after lesioning cortical cell bodies with ibotenic acid (20 min infusion of 10(-4) M ibotenic acid via the dialysis fiber), both systemic injections and local cortical infusions of idazoxan were still effective in increasing cortical noradrenaline efflux. Lesion of serotonergic afferents to the cerebral cortex (by i.c.v. injection of 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine) or of cortical cholinergic afferents (by bilateral electrocoagulation of the nucleus basalis magnocellularis) did not affect the ability of cortical idazoxan infusion to stimulate noradrenaline efflux. The results suggest that the effects of idazoxan on cortical noradrenaline release are mediated primarily by alpha-2 adrenoceptors on noradrenergic nerve terminals, rather than by those located postsynaptically, somatodendritically or on the terminals of other neuronal inputs to the cerebral cortex.\r"

Electrical stimulation of the vagal trunk in cats with chronic supranodose vagotomy for 11 to 32 days caused an excitatory response of the stomach. The pulse duration of electrical stimulation to obtain a maximal excitatory response of the stomach was 3 msec. Administration of hexamethonium (10 mg/kg i.v.) did not inhibit but enhanced the excitatory response of stomach. Atropine (3, 10 and 30 micrograms/kg i.v.), hemicholinium (10 mg/kg i.v.) and morphine (5 mg/kg i.v.) inhibited this hexamethonium-resistant excitatory response of the stomach, whereas treatment with physostigmine (300 mu/kg i.v.) augmented it. A substance P antagonist, (D-Pro2, D-Trp7.9)-substance P (250 and 500 micrograms/kg i.v.), did not affect the hexamethonium-resistant excitatory response. Acetylcholine content of the nodose ganglion 6 to 8 days after supranodose vagotomy was assayed using the radioenzymatic method, and the level was about 48% that of the intact ganglion. These results suggest that the gastric excitatory response to stimulation of the supranodose denervated vagal trunk is produced by activation of vagal afferent fibers probably originating from the nodose ganglion; the fibers involved are cholinergic.\r"

  ".W": "The preparation and evaluation of an in vitro system to study the effects of denervation on amino acid uptake in the adolescent rat parotid gland are described. The biochemical consequences of denervation in adolescent rats were different from those seen in the adult. Surgical sympathectomy at 23 to 25 days resulted in marked decreases in weight (29%), acid-precipitable protein (21%) and alpha-amylase (50%) 2 weeks after surgery. Measurement of DNA indicated a loss of cells but no change in cell volume. These effects of sympathectomy were reversible, and these parameters had returned to control levels at 4 weeks. Parasympathetic denervation resulted in decreases in weight (48%), protein (20%) and alpha-amylase (30%) 2 weeks after surgery and paralleled those seen in the adult rat. Unlike sympathectomized glands, the deficits were not reversed at 4 weeks. Fluorometric measurement of norepinephrine and in vivo uptake of [3H]norepinephrine showed a large depletion at 2 weeks (80 and 84%, respectively). Auriculotemporal neurotomy (parasympathectomy), assessed by gas chromatographic measurement of acetylcholine, resulted in a 60% decrease in acetylcholine. The evaluation of a lobule preparation of these glands, suitable for short-term in vitro studies, is also described. Lobules were prepared by strictly mechanical means to avoid membrane changes reported in in vitro systems using enzymatically dissociated tissue. Histologic evaluation indicated that most lobules were free of mechanical damage, and normal secretory units were intact.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Uptake of a nonmetabolizable amino acid, [14C]alpha-aminoisobutyric acid (AIB), was measured in an in vitro system of parotid lobules prepared from surgically denervated glands. Despite atrophic changes indicated by morphologic and biochemical examination, lobules prepared from sympathectomized glands showed a 22% (P less than .05) increase in [14C]AIB uptake. Uptake by lobules prepared from parasympathectomized glands had a similar average increase, but results were more variable (P greater than .05). Analysis of initial flux data for AIB suggested that a small increase in Vmax and a small decrease in Km occur after sympathetic or parasympathetic denervation. Norepinephrine, at a concentration of 10(-6) M, caused acceleration of AIB uptake in normal lobules (60%) and further increase in parasympathectomized lobules (150%) and sympathectomized lobules (200%). Acceleration of AIB uptake was only evident, however, after 1 hr of incubation, suggesting an intermediate event. The pattern of in vitro uptake of [3H]norepinephrine over a period of 3 hr was studied and revealed a biphasic pattern of uptake in control and parasympathectomized tissue. Early rapid increase in radioactivity was followed by slow decline. A different pattern was observed in sympathectomized glands, in which radioactivity increased steadily but at a reduced rate. These results suggest that the initial rapid phase of uptake may be the result of neuronal uptake followed by gradual degradation and release of radioactive metabolites. [3H]Norepinephrine uptake by parasympathectomized glands averaged 20% greater than controls, suggesting a possible expansion of the sympathetic component after surgery.\r"

  ".W": "An improved neurochemical assay for gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) function has been developed using tracer-radioactive chloride efflux in mouse cortical slices. Careful maintenance of the brain slice viability resulted in a 3-fold stimulation of 36Cl- efflux rate by the GABA agonist muscimol (EC50 = 3 microM), comparable to electrophysiologic and other chloride flux preparations. The shape of the muscimol dose-response curve was shallow, suggestive of negative cooperativity or heterogeneous receptors, but tissue uptake of agonist, possible diffusion barriers and apparent functional desensitization complicated these results. The response to muscimol was inhibited by GABAA receptor antagonists such as RU5135 and was enhanced by barbiturates and benzodiazepines. As observed previously, barbiturates stimulated 36Cl- efflux rate on their own and potentiated the response (potency and maximal effect) to muscimol in a stereospecific and picrotoxin-sensitive manner. Benzodiazepine receptor ligands alone did not alter 36Cl- flux, but agonists such as flunitrazepam enhanced the response to muscimol, an effect sensitive to the antagonist Ro15-1788. The inverse agonist methyl 6,7-dimethoxy-4-ethyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate did not inhibit muscimol-activated 36Cl- flux. The anthelminthic-insecticide avermectin B1a stimulated 36Cl- flux by itself, and this response was apparently additive with that of muscimol. This brain slice chloride flux assay is therefore suitable for the assessment of activity including dose-response curves for GABAA agonists, antagonists and modulators including benzodiazepines.\r"

The pattern and kinetics of PHT distribution in vivo were examined with quantitative carbon-14 autoradiography. Initially gray matter levels were greater than white matter levels, but after 30 min the opposite condition was found. At a given time point, the levels of PHT among various gray matter structures as a group or among white matter structures as a group were uniform. The ratio of radioactivity in white matter to that in gray matter was 3:1 120 min after injection of radiolabeled PHT. Thin-layer chromatography showed only PHT in the brain 15 min after injection of PHT and both PHT and its hydroxylated metabolite [5-(p-hydroxyphenyl)-5-phenylhydantoin] 120 min after injection. The proportions of PHT and 5-(p-hydroxyphenyl)-5-phenylhydantoin were the same in white as in gray matter. Direct chemical measurements of brain samples obtained after coinjections of tracer amounts of radiolabeled PHT with increasing doses of unlabeled PHT corroborated the autoradiographic findings and revealed no displacement of the tracer by pharmacologic doses of the unlabeled drug. In vitro binding of PHT was investigated with sections obtained from frozen brains and with physiologically intact brain slices. Both high (4-10 nM) and low (1 microM) affinity conditions were examined. In no case was specific binding detected. Binding was greater in gray matter than in white matter in sections, whereas binding was greater in white matter than in gray matter in slices. We conclude that PHT distribution and binding reflect physico-chemical factors, such as lipid content, and physiological factors, such as blood flow and selective partitioning into white matter in living tissue, rather than specific receptors.\r"

Local application of PCP did not elicit an observable increase in extracellular levels of the monoamine neurotransmitters. However, pretreatment with PCP significantly potentiated the potassium-evoked release of monoamines. Nomifensine, a potent catecholamine reuptake blocker, produced effects that were analogous with PCP. Local pretreatment with PCP was also found to potentiate the electrochemical signal detected after pressure ejection of dopamine directly into the caudate nucleus. Finally, electrophysiological studies showed that locally applied PCP and nomifensine solutions had similar potencies in depressing the spontaneous firing of striatal neurons. Taken together, these data suggest that the major presynaptic action of PCP in the rat caudate nucleus is inhibition of the reuptake, and not alteration of release, of the monoamine neurotransmitters.\r"

Optimal conditions for the assay of BAR on type II pneumocyte membranes are presented. Type II pneumocyte BAR are primarily of the beta-2 subtype, as indicated by inhibition of subtype-specific antagonists, ICI 118,551 and betaxolol. Maximum binding and Kd were measured (Kd, 4-20 pM; maximum binding, 30-50 fmol/mg of protein) and used to identify factors which alter BAR. The number of BAR on type II pneumocytes doubled after 42-hr culture in the presence of dexamethasone. Ligand-receptor interactions were of similar affinity to those in membrane particulates from whole lung, but maximum binding was reduced 3- to 4-fold. Less than 5% of total pulmonary BAR can be accounted for by those expressed on freshly isolated type II pneumocyte membranes. Other cell types thus probably account for the majority of specific beta adrenergic binding sites in the lung as a whole.\r"

The cationic amphiphilic nature of many of these compounds suggests that they may be sequestered within an acidic and/or phospholipid-rich compartment. We described previously receptor-independent, concentrative, temperature- and pH-dependent sequestration of the beta adrenergic antagonists [125I]iodocyanopindolol and [125I]iodopindolol by intact rat type II pneumocytes in primary culture. The present study reveals that type II pneumocytes sequester [125I]iodocyanopindolol to an extent greater than other cell types (type II cells greater than polymorphonuclear leukocytes greater than S49) within 80-min incubations. Localization of fluorescence into large granular structures was observed after incubation of type II cells with 9-aminoacridine-propranolol (9-AAP). The distribution of fluorescence coincides with surfactant-containing lamellar bodies (LB) visualized with tannic acid/osmium staining. The large granule localization of 9-AAP fluorescence decreases with time in primary culture in parallel with changes in cell morphology and decreased numbers of LB. Comparison of patterns of fluorescence after incubation with 9-AAP, acridine orange and 9-aminoacridine (all 1 microM) indicates that localization is not a property of the acridine moiety, but requires the propranolol side-chain. Association of 9-AAP fluorescence with LB is inhibited completely by chlorpromazine (10 microM); the same concentration of propranolol or chlorquine produces less extensive, but detectable, inhibition.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Ketanserin produced a dose-related inhibition of sympathetic nerve discharge recorded from the inferior cardiac nerve in chloralose-anesthetized cats. Administration of a large dose of prazosin (1 mg/kg i.v.) decreased arterial blood pressure and inhibited sympathetic activity for several hours. Additional doses of prazosin failed to further inhibit sympathetic nerve discharge. Pretreatment with prazosin (1 mg/kg i.v.) also blocked the ability of ketanserin to inhibit sympathetic activity. Conversely, pretreatment with ketanserin blocked the central sympatholytic action of prazosin. In contrast, the alpha-2 adrenergic agonist clonidine inhibited sympathetic activity in animals pretreated with prazosin. The highly selective serotonin2 antagonist, LY 53857, failed to affect arterial blood pressure, heart rate or sympathetic activity recorded from the inferior cardiac nerve. These data, along with earlier results from our laboratory, provide strong evidence to indicate that ketanserin produces a centrally mediated inhibition of sympathetic nerve discharge as a result of the ability of the drug to block alpha-1 adrenergic receptors.\r"

  ".W": "Human uterine fluid (UF) was found to contain several amino acids at high concentrations. Taurine was predominant; its concentration in UF was up to 400-fold that of plasma during the luteal phase. High UF concentrations of amino acids probably result from active endometrial secretion, which is selective with respect to type of amino acid and is regulated by ovarian steroids. Amino acids, particularly taurine, have an apparent function in osmotic regulation since UF has a lower salt content than serum but the same osmolarity. The high concentration of taurine may also act to sustain the motility of spermatozoa in UF, by protecting them from the adverse influence of high K+ concentration. Knowledge of the amino acid composition of UF in the luteal phase may prove useful in such clinical contexts as in vitro fertilization of ova and embryo replacement.\r"

The purposes of this prospective investigation were to determine the effect of pregnancy on cardiac function in women thought to have MVP and to determine whether any such changes would adversely affect pregnancy outcome. During a recent three-year period, 43 (1.2%) of 3,582 pregnant women followed in our clinic had a prior diagnosis of MVP without any other cardiac disorder. On closer evaluation, only 21 women (0.6%) had a previous echocardiogram suggestive of MVP. Serial echocardiograms in these women revealed that pregnancy caused either no change or an improvement in the valve prolapse. No cardiac complications were present, and perinatal outcomes were favorable. MVP may be less pronounced during pregnancy, and an echocardiogram late in gestation seems worthwhile to confirm the diagnosis before delivery.\r"

Immunobeads coated with rabbit antibody to one of the three major immunoglobulins (IgG, IgM and IgA) are used. The procedure involves mixing a Hepes washed sample of normal donor sperm with the individual sera followed by centrifugation and incubation with each type of immunobead preparation and observed for evidence of binding. Sera from 40 patients previously tested with SAT and SIT were compared in four groups. There was a good correlation between IgG-IBA and SIT and a poor correlation between IgG-IBA and SAT. The class of immunoglobulin detected most frequently was IgG.\r"

After infection of neonatal Swiss mice with active CVB 1, virus replicated to high titers in muscle and produced acute myonecrosis. Viral titers peaked in muscle at Day 7 and virus was undetectable after Day 14. Myocytes regenerated, but a chronic inflammatory myositis, involving principally proximal muscle groups of the hind limbs, was observed by Day 14 and persisted through at least Day 70. Injection of inactivated virus resulted in no clinical or histological disease. Anti-CVB 1 antibody was demonstrated in mice injected with inactivated or active virus pools.

Relapsing polychondritis is seen not uncommonly with a variety of inflammatory skin lesions. Because of this, and because many rheumatic diseases have been observed with relapsing polychondritis, we stress that relapsing polychondritis is a syndrome and not a unique disease. Relapsing polychondritis in mild form may be fairly common; a search for signs and symptoms of chondritis should be a routine part of the workup of patients with inflammatory rheumatic diseases and dermatoses.\r"

Of the 126 deans contacted, 113 supplied course descriptions, and 99 responded to survey questions about the integration of human values programs into students' clinical education. Ninety-five schools reported that at least one human values course was required during the first or second year of the curriculum; 38 schools listed a program as part of the required curriculum for the third or fourth year. The respondents reported several ways in which human values programs were integrated into clinical education. The most frequently mentioned method was reinforcement or addition of human values emphases during medical clerkships. The process considered to be most important by respondents in achieving this integration was a combination of interactions among faculty members, improvement of human values courses, and the support of the dean. The respondents also reported on the characteristics of faculty members who teach such courses, on faculty development efforts, on barriers to the integration of human values teaching into the curriculum, and on the evaluation of such courses.\r"

A rating form was developed for the study to assess residents' competency in the medical care tasks and was sent to the directors of the residency programs entered by the graduates of a medical school. Stepwise multiple regression procedures were used to analyze the relationship between these ratings of residency performance and the residents' premedical and medical school performance and to identify the best predictors of residency performance for the 1982 and 1984 classes. A Rasch model analysis of the residency performance ratings indicated the ease or difficulty of each of the 18 tasks. The results provide information that would allow medical educators to use premedical and medical school performance to predict residents' competencies. The task of \"clinically evaluates research and clinical data\" was the most difficult for the graduates; that is, they were rated lower on it than on any other task. Two groups of measures of undergraduate and medical school performance were significantly related to performance in the residency: the Part II examination of the National Board of Medical Examiners (particularly the scores on the obstetrics-gynecology, medicine, surgery, and pediatrics subtests and the overall score) and the clerkships (particularly the third-year medicine clerkship, the fourth-year medicine clerkship, and the surgery clerkship).\r"

The graduates favorably evaluated patient contact time provided by the program but felt too much time was spent waiting for faculty members and more time should be spent interacting with other health professionals. Nearly two-thirds of the graduates indicated no change should be made in proportion of time spent in the CHC. The experience was viewed as providing early primary care exposure, the opportunity to follow patients over time, and the opportunity to learn the doctor-patient relationship. However, some of the graduates felt there was too much emphasis on primary care in their fourth year. Finally, over 91 percent of the graduates thought the training prepared them as well as or better than other residents were prepared by other programs.\r"

When the course was scheduled in competition with demanding basic science courses, however, the students' attitudes did not become as positive as or became more negative than when the course was part of a less demanding schedule. The course used lectures and reading assignments to provide information on substance abuse and used patient contact to change attitudes toward substance abusers and treatment. Emphasis was placed on patient management problems and small-group discussions. The changes in the students' attitudes are assumed by the authors to be positive, but the link between these attitudes and good clinical practice has not been demonstrated.\r"

The study reported here is the first national survey of primary care physicians' perceptions of their competency in dealing with adolescents' health concerns. In the survey, 351 internists, family practitioners, and pediatricians rated their competency in 19 areas of adolescent health care. Approximately three-quarters or more of the internists indicated deficits in all 19 areas. In areas related to gynecologic concerns, more pediatricians reported deficits than family physicians; but more family physicians than pediatricians reported deficiencies in managing acute conditions of youth (growth and developmental problems, endocrinopathies, school-based problems, and chronic illnesses). All physicians indicated deficiencies in dealing with high-risk health behaviors: eating disorders, drug and alcohol abuse, homosexuality, and delinquency. Finally, more than 45 percent of the physicians overall reported deficiencies in areas related to social and/or emotional concerns, including suicide, depression, and family conflicts. Despite these acknowledged deficits, most of the primary care physicians did not indicate adolescents to be the least desirable age group with which to work. However, few of the physicians expressed a desire to improve their skills. Overall, in none of the 19 areas did more than 30 percent of the physicians who had reported deficiencies in an area express interest in improving their competency.\r"

  ".W": "The authors compared the attitudes of men and women junior medical students at one medical school before and after completing the surgery clerkship. The attitudes surveyed pertained to the students' confidence in dealing with problems in the doctor-patient relationship, concerns about future practice, and attitudes about preventive care. The women and men differed in only one career preference, with more women than men choosing obstetrics-gynecology. The class as a whole had more positive attitudes in all three areas after the clerkship. The men and women did not differ before or after the clerkship in their confidence in handling problems in the doctor-patient relationship. The women, however, had higher levels of concern than the men about preventive care after the clerkship. Although the men and women overall entered the clerkship with similar attitudes, the women left the surgical clerkship with more positive attitudes overall but also with more concerns about future practice than the men. Because of the demands made on students' time during the surgery clerkship, some women students may become concerned about conflicts that could arise from balancing career roles and homemaker roles, and they may need support at this time in dealing with these concerns.\r"

Available means for preventing many injuries and reducing the resulting disability or death are often ignored, and for many decades there was little emphasis on effective preventive measures. Examples of successful efforts to prevent injury illustrate the effectiveness of measures that provide automatic protection rather than requiring repeated individual action. Traditionally, funding for research on trauma has had an inverse relationship to its importance as a public health problem. Recent progress toward a federal Center for Injury Control reflects the hard work of many members of the trauma community and provides cause for optimism that there will be greater support for training and research in trauma epidemiology, prevention, biomechanics, acute care, and rehabilitation.\r"

Secondary colonization of the oropharynx and respiratory tract with ICU-associated Gram-negative bacilli followed by pneumonia occurred in 12 patients (20%). The overall incidence of respiratory tract infections was 59%. In a prospective open trial three prophylactic antibiotic regimens were compared: 17 patients were treated with intestinal decontamination using nonabsorbable antibiotics (polymyxin E 400 mg, tobramycin 320 mg, amphotericin B 2,000 mg/day). No difference in infection rate was found. Twenty-five patients were treated with intestinal and oropharyngeal decontamination using an ointment containing 2% of the same antibiotics. Secondary colonization and infection of the respiratory tract with Gram-negative bacilli was significantly reduced (p less than 0.001). The incidence of early (Gram-positive) infections, however, was unchanged. Another group of 63 patients was treated with systemic antibiotic prophylaxis during the first days in combination with oropharyngeal and intestinal decontamination. The incidence of early pneumonia was significantly reduced (p less than 0.001). Five patients (8%) developed an infection. Superinfections were not observed.\r"

Forty-two of the victims had been wearing a seatbelt and had an abdominal trauma as the main cause of death or as first diagnosis of injury. Small intestine and colon injuries were more common in the severely injured victims than was the case with the fatally injured ones and in these accidents the injury mechanism was always deceleration or contusion, which was in most cases caused by the seatbelt. Liver injuries seem to be the major abdominal cause of fatality, and in the fatally injured group, half of the victims sustained the fatal abdominal injury through gross crushing impact. When the direction of the impact was analyzed, all the victims seated on the receiving side of the vehicle in lateral impact collisions sustained an abdominal injury with fatal outcome. It seems that the seatbelt is less effective in protecting wearers from severe or fatal abdominal injuries in lateral impact collisions.\r"

The fresh fractures were stabilized from the condylar region by intramedullary nails connected to a coupling-piece with two transverse screws preventing extrusion or intrusion of the nails. All fractures healed uneventfully without rotatory and angulatory malalignment. The maximum shortening was 2 cm in two patients and was less in the others. Patients walking before surgery were mobilized the day after. The system is more stable than Rush pins or Ender nails only and does not require good quality of bone needed for plating.\r"

A review of our experience at the Harborview Medical Center in the treatment of 14 consecutive patients with this injury provides insights into the management of multiply injured patients with long bone fractures. All of the 28 tibial fractures were the result of high-energy forces, and 16 were open injuries. Thirteen of the patients had sustained severe multiple trauma and three died as a result of their injuries. All surviving patients were followed until complete healing and long-term followup examination was obtained. The severe injuries which result in bilateral tibial fractures are associated with a high morbidity and mortality. Aggressive and meticulous management of the bony and soft-tissue injuries can provide for good results, early mobilization, and full functional return in these multiply injured patients. Primary amputation should be undertaken only as a final alternative, as most open fractures are salvageable.\r"

  ".U": "87198788\r", 
  ".W": "Predictable vascular responses to burn injury can occur where blood vessels are occluded in and just beneath the site of trauma. The loss of vascular patency is linked to the development of ischemia in the surrounding skin. Several mechanisms may be responsible for this occlusion, and their identification will provide a logical means for prevention or reversal of the occlusion. The role of fibrin deposition was investigated here using a rat burn model. If an intravascular fibrin clot is a primary cause of early occlusion, the depletion of circulating fibrinogen should prevent its deposition. Ancrod, a pit viper venom trypsin-like proteinase, when given systemically, converts fibrinogen into a soluble product which does not clot. In studies here, the host is depleted of fibrinogen by intravenous injections of ancrod for 3 days before standard burn trauma. Burn injury in defibrinogenized rats resulted in greatly reduced local vascular occlusion. These results support the idea that vascular occlusion caused by burn injury is dependent on the deposition of fibrin. It is conjectured that the vascular occlusion of burn injury can be reversed by preventing or breaking down intravascular fibrin clots.\r"

  ".W": "Ultralight aircraft, which originated in 1975 in the U.S. and have been available in Canada since 1980, have enjoyed a tremendous increase in popularity to the point where it is estimated that there are close to 20,000 ultralights in North America today. Two reasons account for their growing popularity: relatively low cost and simplicity, allowing almost any person to enjoy the sport of flying, which was unattainable for most just a few years ago. Unfortunately, inexperienced pilots and relatively new and unproven aircraft have been brought together to create a potentially lethal combination. On average, 60 deaths per year occur in the U.S. due to ultralight crashes, a number that will undoubtedly rise in the future. The U.S. and Canada have very few regulations covering the licensing of pilots or the design and construction of ultralight aircraft. The North American safety record is inferior to that of countries that have implemented stricter, more far-reaching regulations. Stricter pilot certification and enforced regulations governing design and construction of ultralight aircraft would improve the safety record of this sport. Ultralight aircraft crashes and their associated injuries came to our attention recently through the presentation of three cases of isolated fractures of the thoracolumbar spine in such crashes. Spinal fractures due to ultralight crashes have no unique features that separate them from those of other trauma victims. Physicians must, however, have a high index of suspicion for spinal injuries in these victims.\r"

There were 230 patients without renal injury and 45 patients with renal injury treated without exploration of the kidney in 17 patients, with exploration and renorrhaphy in nine patients, and with partial or total nephrectomy in 19 patients. In addition, 45 patients without renal injury were randomly matched by computer to the 45 patients with renal injury based on the number of blood transfusions and severity of shock as indicators of physiologic insult. Renal function was adversely affected by partial or total nephrectomy in patients with renal injury. Significant decreases in renal filtration and excretion were seen when the nephrectomy group was compared to the patients without renal injury matched for injury insult. Creatinine clearance decreased from 103 ml/min to 55 ml/min, inulin clearance from 106 ml/min to 63 ml/min, and osmolar clearance from 4.8 ml/min to 3.3 ml/min. The 230 patients without renal injury had an incidence of renal failure of 7.4% and a mortality rate of 8.2% compared to 11.4% and 15.6%, respectively, in the 45 patients with renal injury. Death and renal failure occurred in 13 of the 230 patients without renal injury (5.6%) and in two of the 45 renal injury patients (4.4%). The incidence of renal failure in the 19 patients without renal injury who died was 68% versus 29% in the seven renal injury patients who died. Preservation of renal parenchyma is recommended to provide maximal renal function in severely injured patients.\r"

Subjectively, no patient had long-term pain or dissatisfaction with the functional or cosmetic result. Objectively, all patients regained full joint motion and normal grip strength. Mild rotatory malalignment was present in both groups, but the conservative group had less extensor lag. The main difference between the two groups centered on residual dorsal angulation. This cosmetic deformity was considerably less in the operative group, although the cost of this improvement was significantly longer rehabilitation. Failure to correct dorsal angulation was not associated with functional disability.\r"

Using a low (145 degrees-150 degrees) nail-plate fixation (McLaughlin) for this type of fracture, early weight-bearing ambulation can be obtained. In the period from 1 January 1978 through 1 May 1982 52 stable trochanteric fractures in 52 patients were treated by low nail-plate fixation. Within 1 week postoperatively, the patients started full weight-bearing ambulation. The functional result was good in 88.2%. Despite the average age of 77.9 years the hospital mortality rate was 1.9%. On the basis of the results mentioned above, it is concluded that the described treatment of stable trochanteric fractures can be considered reliable.\r"

Thirty-one patients sustained single or double vertical ring fractures. Fifteen of these patients underwent both plain radiography and Computerized Axial Tomographic (CAT) scans in the evaluation of their pelvic injuries. The CAT scans of these pelvic injuries aided in detecting occult sacroiliac disruptions, determining the extent of posterior ring comminution, evaluating possible extension of the pelvic fractures into the acetabulum, assessing pelvic ring stability, and demonstrating soft-tissue injuries within the pelvis. Six pelvic injuries were diagnosed as single vertical breaks in the pelvic ring and nine were diagnosed as double vertical breaks in the pelvic ring by plain radiographs. CAT scanning demonstrated occult posterior ring disruptions in four patients which led to the reclassification of their injuries to double vertical fractures. CAT scanning also demonstrated significant degrees of sacral comminution in five patients which altered surgical treatment plans in all five patients. Two fractures were classified as unstable based on marked sacral comminution demonstrated on CAT scan. Extension of the pelvic ring fractures into the acetabulum was suggested on plain radiographs in three patients and was excluded by review of the CAT scans in these patients. Significant intrapelvic hematomas were demonstrated in three patients and urine extravasation into the hip joint from a bladder laceration was seen in one patient with the CAT scan.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The hyperphagic burned rats also exhibited increased resting energy expenditure and no gain in body weight, suggesting hypermetabolism. Plasma levels of immunoreactive insulin and albumin were decreased in both groups of burned rats; immunoreactive pancreatic glucagon concentrations were elevated only in the anorectic burned rats. Plasma levels of epinephrine were elevated in the hyperphagic burned rats. In the brain, dopamine metabolism appeared to be increased in the corpus striatum, nucleus accumbens, and amygdala of anorectic burned rats; norepinephrine levels were elevated in the hypothalamus and nucleus accumbens of the hyperphagic-hypermetabolic rats. These data indicate that this animal model of major burn trauma exhibits anorexia, hyperphagia, catabolism, and hypermetabolism. Furthermore, elevated dopamine metabolism appears to be associated with the anorexia, while the hyperphagia-hypermetabolism may be mediated by norepinephrine.\r"

Eighty-eight cases resulted from blunt trauma and 39 cases had penetrating injuries. There were 34 gunshot wounds and five stab wounds. An IVP was performed in 116 patients. All cases of blunt trauma with an IVP reported as normal had no renal pathology greater than contusion. Intravenous pyelogram results in penetrating injuries had a 75% false negative rate. Findings of nonvisualization or extravasation were significant for fractures, perforation, or pedicle injuries in all trauma. Eight of the patients with nonpenetrating wounds and 37 of the patients with penetrating injury underwent exploratory laparotomy. Sixteen nephrectomies were performed for a nephrectomy rate of 12.6% of the total series. This nephrectomy rate is comparable to similar studies which are reviewed.\r"

  ".W": "A compact device which evacuates blood from a hemothorax and facilitates rapid autotransfusion was evaluated in dogs. Experimental hemothorax was established surgically by incising the internal mammary artery through a thoracotomy with the animals under general anesthesia. Postoperatively the blood was drained by one of two methods. In the Heimlich valve group (n = 5), blood was drained by a chest tube through a one-way flutter valve into a collapsible plastic bag. In the Sorenson group (n = 5), blood was drained by a chest tube into the Sorenson Autotransfusion System. Blood from these two groups was then autotransfused. In the control group (n = 5), the drained blood was not autotransfused. Results showed no statistical difference between the two autotransfusion groups in the volume of blood collected, circulating fibrinogen levels, platelet counts, stroma-free hemoglobin levels, prothrombin time, or 51Cr-labeled RBC survival. There was a significant drop in the circulating platelet count, which returned to normal by 24 hours, in both groups of dogs which were autotransfused. We conclude that autotransfusion of blood collected by a compact device which utilizes a Heimlich valve and requires no suction is similar to using the Sorenson Autotransfusion System. It may be safe to use the Heimlich valve to collect blood for autotransfusion in clinical situations, where its qualities of simplicity, portability and a minimum requirement for storage space are desirable.\r"

When bile drained from suction catheters reexploration revealed an injury to the duodenum and diaphragm. Wounds that penetrate the vagina may injure nonpelvic viscera. Vaginal penetrating wounds should be managed like other abdominal penetrating injuries.\r"

  ".W": "4-Methylpyrazole (4 MP) is a strong inhibitor of alcohol dehydrogenase. Its use in acute ethylene glycol (EG) or methanol intoxication has been suggested in experimental studies about its efficacy and safety. We report three cases of accidental intoxication with ethylene glycol in man treated orally with 20 mg/kg/day of 4 MP. The treatment was maintained until plasma EG concentrations became unmeasurable. The patients were admitted early during the course of the poisoning. Their neurological status was good. A slight metabolic acidosis observed in two cases was easily corrected and did not recur. Renal function remained normal in all cases. No patient underwent hemodialysis. On admission plasma EG concentrations were 24.2 mmol/l, 13 mmol/l and 9.7 mmol/l respectively. Plasma EG half-lives were 14.5, 11.5 and 14.75 hours respectively. Plasma oxalate concentrations and the rate of urine oxalate elimination, determined in two patients, were high on admission but quickly returned to normal. Concerning possible side effects of 4 MP, a skin rash was observed in one patient and a possible eosinophilia in the others. These three cases suggest that 4 MP may decrease the metabolic consequences of EG poisoning in man and may be of therapeutic value when administered early during the course of the intoxication before coma, seizures and organic renal failure have occurred.\r"
