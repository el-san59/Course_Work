At Brigham and Women's Hospital, the effects of a sublethal, 6-hour infusion of TNF (0.57 X 10(5) Units/kg body weight) in twelve anesthetized dogs were studied. The dose caused falls in mean arterial pressure from 153 mmHg to 96 mmHg, pulmonary artery pressure (-4.5 mmHg), central venous pressure (-2.5 mmHg) and pulmonary capillary wedge pressures (-5.25 mmHg). Associated with these responses were a fourfold increase in urine volume (22.4 ml/kg/6 hours as compared to 5.2 ml/kg/6 hours in controls), significant pyrexia (from 38.1 C to 39.5 C, rectal), tachycardia (from 125 to 175 beats/minute), and hypermetabolism. In addition, leukopenia and increased circulating stress hormone concentrations were observed. Blood glucose concentrations fell from 4.68 mM/1 to 3.97 mM/1 (84-71 mg/dl) within 3 hours of TNF infusion, whereas lactate and pyruvate concentrations increased. These alterations occurred in the absence of severe hypotension or acidosis and were similar to changes observed after endotoxin administration or gram-negative septicemia. Pretreatment of the animals with the cyclooxygenase inhibitor ibuprofen abolished most of the hemodynamic changes and attenuated other responses. These findings support the hypothesis that TNF is an important mediator of septic responses and that some of the effects of TNF are mediated via cyclooxygenase pathways.\r"

  ".W": "The objective of this study was to evaluate the use of the serum creatinine in following postoperative renal function. In this prospective study of 278 patients (mainly hypertensives and diabetics) undergoing noncardiac surgery, the serum creatinines were followed from the first through the sixth postoperative day. Creatinine clearances were evaluated before operation and on the fourth to fifth postoperative day. During the first six days after the operation, 23% (65 of 278 patients) had an increase of serum creatinine greater than or equal to 20%. Such increases were sustained for greater than or equal to 48 hours in 12% of the patients (32 of 278), and half of these patients had not returned to their initial level of renal function by the time of discharge. Patients who sustained such a deterioration were at risk for nonoliguric renal failure if they had a subsequent insult (i.e., hypotension, reoperation, angiography, aminoglycosides). Such increases occurred early in the postoperative period--on the first or second postoperative day. As judged by the creatinine clearances, postoperative increases of greater than or equal to 20% in the serum creatinine identified most patients whose clearance fell more than 50%, although the serum creatinine did not accurately reflect changes in creatinine clearance among those patients who had undergone an amputation. It is concluded that the serum creatinine is useful in monitoring postoperative renal function. Of those patients who had postoperative increases in serum creatinine sustained for greater than or equal to 48 hours, as many as one third had evidence of impairment in renal function at the time of discharge.\r"

This study was a randomized cross-over comparison of 500 ml of 5% albumin and 500 ml of 10% pentastarch, a new hydroxyethyl starch, in acute burn resuscitation. Pentastarch was an effective plasma expander, resulting in increases of preload, cardiac output, oxygen delivery, and oxygen consumption; the hemodynamic effects of pentastarch infusion were equal or superior to those of albumin. Both albumin and pentastarch infusions resulted in increased bleeding and clotting times; these effects were most likely dilutional. Pentastarch is a promising plasma substitute for burn resuscitation; the effects of a 500 ml infusion are equal or superior to those of albumin. Further study is necessary to assess the safety of larger infusion volumes.\r"

  ".W": "To evaluate the effect of aortic occlusion and limb reperfusion on global and regional function of the right and left ventricle during infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm repair, 23 patients underwent five intraoperative first-pass radionuclide angiocardiograms: 1) before the skin incision, 2) at aortic cross-clamp, 3) 20 minutes after aortic occlusion, 4) at unclamping, and 5) after skin closure. A subset of twelve patients had simultaneous transesophageal echocardiography to evaluate left ventricular wall stress. Parameters measured included the electrocardiogram (ECG), heart rate, blood pressure, pulmonary artery pressure, the cardiac output, the left and right ventricular ejection fractions, left ventricular volumes, and left ventricular wall stress. Significant changes (p less than 0.01) were observed at aortic clamping in the left ventricular ejection fraction (from 0.56 to 0.48), end-diastolic volume (from 171 to 225 ml), end-systolic volume (from 85 to 127 ml), mean blood pressure (from 82 to 91 mmHg), and meridional end-systolic wall stress (from 53 to 67 10(3) dyne/cm2). Once the clamp was removed, significant variations were seen in the left ventricular ejection fraction (from 0.51 to 0.58), end-diastolic volume (from 205 to 187 ml), end-systolic volume (from 105 to 94 ml), mean blood pressure (from 84 to 69 mmHg), and meridional end-systolic wall stress (from 67 to 46 10(3) dyne/cm2). No differences were observed between the two aortic occlusion studies, and the baseline level of function was recovered in all parameters during the last study. These data quantify the changes in heart function that occur during abdominal aortic aneurysm operation and demonstrate that the majority of the adaptations that occurred were due to a variation in afterload.\r"

The study purpose was to predict long-term outcome in chronic TBI patients by using multimodality evoked potentials (MEP), the Rancho Los Amigos Scale (RLAS), and other clinical parameters. Neither the BAEP nor SSEP correlated significantly with the cognitive level on the RLAS at the MEP study approximately one year after TBI (RLAS1). Only 11.7% of RLAS1 could be predicted by the combined study of BAEP and SSEP. BAEP and SSEP obtained about one year after TBI jointly had a 15% predictive power of the long-term follow-up RLAS score obtained 18 months after performance of the MEP (RLAS2). Stepwise regression analysis showed that the best predictive indicator of the status of long-term outcome was RLAS1 which alone can predict 60% of long-term outcome. The predictive value of combinations of RLAS1 and age improved prediction of long-term outcome to 66.8%, and the combination of RLAS1, age, and SSEP further increased the value to 72%. Perhaps the MEPs were relatively insensitive in reflecting the patient's adaptation to fixed neuronal damage since patients can perform higher cognitive function by adaptation through behavioral modification and cognitive retraining despite little structural improvement. This adaptation would result in a discrepancy between MEP and RLAS scores in the late chronic phase.\r"

CSEPs were recorded at Cz'-Fz (10-20 international EEG system) after stimulation of the saphenous, peroneal, and sural nerves at the ankle. Each nerve was tested in the supine and sitting positions. CSEP P1, N1 latencies and P1 - N1 amplitudes were recorded. The mean values of these parameters and side-to-side differences were determined for both positions. Parameter changes between the two positions were also determined. No statistically significant difference was found when comparing supine and sitting, or side-to-side values (p greater than 0.05). Regression analyses of P1 latency vs height revealed a significant positive correlation for both positions (p less than 0.0001-0.0045). Mean P1 and N1 latencies (msec) +/- 1SD, and mean P1 - N1 amplitudes (microV) +/- 1SD are as follows: peroneal nerve (n = 119) P1 = 39.5 +/- 2.98, N1 = 48.2 +/- 3.79, P1 - N1 = 1.41 +/- 0.81; sural nerve (n = 119) P1 = 41.3 +/- 4.03, N1 = 50.9 +/- 4.57, P1 - N1 = 1.31 +/- 0.61; saphenous nerve (n = 119) P1 = 41.5 +/- 4.02, N1 = 50.4 +/- 4.10, P1 - N1 = 0.87 +/- 0.30.

The pressure applied in groups A, B, C, D, E, and F was approximately 20kg/cm2 for 20 minutes, 20kg/cm2 for 10 minutes, 20kg/cm2 for 5 minutes, 10kg/cm2 for 20 minutes, 20kg/cm2 for 10 minutes, and 10kg/cm2 for 5 minutes, respectively. The motor nerve conduction velocity (NCV) and the amplitude of the evoked compound muscle action potential (CMAP) were measured before and periodically after nerve compression. The period of initial complete block was significantly longer in the high pressure groups than in the lower ones, and also significantly longer in the nerves compressed for 20 minutes than for those compressed for five or ten minutes. Thus, the severity of conduction block seems to be related to both pressure and duration of compression. Once the conduction block began to recover, the recovery rate of conduction block (recovery rate of amplitude ratio of CMAP, proximal/distal) was not significantly different. The recovery rate of demyelinative lesion (NCV recovery rate) was also not significantly different among the six groups. The degree of compression seems to determine the severity of the initial conduction block, but not the subsequent recovery rate of conduction.\r"

The prognosis is usually poor. Most patients who do survive have severe residual impairment or develop chronic LIS. Review of the literature shows that recovery has been reported but not systematically studied, particularly with respect to early prognostic signs. We report a case of LIS with bilateral pontine infarctions shown by MRI. Severe neurological deficits included quadriplegia, paresis of horizontal gaze, facial paralysis, and bulbar palsy. Horizontal eye movements were present and smooth by the second week after onset. The patient had almost full functional motor recovery within four months, after a comprehensive rehabilitation program. Fourteen other reported cases of LIS with full recovery had documented recovery of lateral gaze in the early stage. In addition, smooth horizontal gaze is the most frequent activity in incomplete LIS. Early recovery of horizontal eye movement may indicate that the brain lesion is limited and may be a good prognostic sign in LIS.\r"

We developed a simple \"bedside\" test of rear wheelchair stability, using a goniometer and a plumb line. The angle of the wheelchair handle while the occupied wheelchair was on a level surface was subtracted from the angle measured while the occupied chair was balanced over the rear axle. The intraobserver and interobserver reliability and the validity in comparison with platform testing were assessed by studying 30 patient-occupied wheelchairs. There was a high correlation (r = 0.93, p less than 0.001) between the values obtained from the beside and platform tests and no significant difference between them. Intraobserver and interobserver reliabilities were 0.87 (p less than 0.001) and 0.94 (p less than 0.001). There was no significant difference between the first and second test values done by a single observer; the mean difference (+/- 1SD) between observers, 1.3 degrees (+/- 1.6 degrees), was small but statistically significant. The bedside test is simple, reliable, valid, and suitable for use as a screening test for the platform assessment of rear stability.\r"

The study examined the period beginning three months postoperatively, well after all suture cutting was completed, a point often considered to represent \"final postoperative astigmatism.\" For the group as a whole, the induced astigmatism measured at three months was not stable, but gradually shifted 0.69 diopter toward against-the-rule astigmatism. Three specific patterns of evolution of postoperative astigmatism were identified, depending on the amount of induced astigmatism found at three months. The data revealed that it was not possible to consistently induce with-the-rule astigmatism, although permanent against-the-rule induced astigmatism could be produced. The long-term evolution of postoperative cataract wounds toward more against-the-rule astigmatism seen in this study was not affected by the number of intact nylon sutures. Proper evaluation of any technique to modify postoperative astigmatism must consider the long-term evolution of the cataract wound.\r"

Although PSC opacities may occur following intraocular inflammation, trauma, or use of steroids, the cause is often unknown. A case-control study was undertaken to investigate the role of exposure to ultraviolet light in the B range (UV-B) and other potential risk factors for the development of PSC cataracts. Surgical PSC cataract cases from a large rural ophthalmic practice on the lower eastern shore of Maryland were matched with phakic controls without PSC cataract changes from the same geographic area by age, sex, and referral pattern. All patients with PSC opacities who underwent cataract surgery in a 12-month period were chosen. One hundred sixty-eight cases and 168 controls were interviewed regarding sunlight exposure, drug use, occupational history, history of diabetes, hypertension, and other diseases. Matched-pairs analyses indicated that a history of relatively high exposure to UV-B was associated with increased risk of PSC cataracts. The association of PSC cataracts with steroid use and diabetes was reconfirmed. Subjects with blue eyes and less than high school education were also at increased risk for PSC cataracts. Smoking and hypertension were not found to be PSC cataract risk factors. These data suggest that UV-B exposure may be an important risk factor for PSC cataracts.\r"

The correlation between migration- and proliferation-stimulating activity was not strong, suggesting the possibility that different agents are responsible for each. Several variables were examined for correlation with each activity, including age and sex of the patient; extent, duration, and height of the detachment; protein content of the fluid; and amount of cryopexy. It was found that proliferation-stimulating activity increased with the extent of detachment and duration of detachment, while migration-stimulating activity correlated best with amount of cryopexy given before drainage. These data suggest that retinal cryopexy enhances RPE cell migration activity in subretinal fluid, while RPE proliferation activity increases with the size and duration of detachment.\r"

Histologic examination following enucleation revealed diffuse iris replacement by spindle and epithelioid cells with extension into the trabecular meshwork. Evidence of direct extraocular extension was absent, and a metastatic evaluation showed no abnormalities. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of xeroderma pigmentosum complicated by melanoma of the iris.

We tested whether vitreoperfusion could protect the retina from severe combined retinal and choroidal ischemia. An intraocular pressure of 170 mm Hg was induced in each eye of nine cats for up to four hours, and simultaneously one eye of each cat underwent vitreoperfusion. After one week, histopathologic examination revealed retinal atrophy and dissolution in untreated eyes but not in eyes treated with vitreoperfusion. To our knowledge, such severe ischemia has never been treated successfully before. Vitreoperfusion is a potential treatment modality in various forms of ocular ischemia. Additional studies are warranted to refine the technique and determine any clinical applicability.\r"

Sixteen cases had no evidence of retinal injury, including one in which the membrane was only 800 microns from the retina. Retinal injuries in the remaining cases consisted of small (less than 300 microns) retinal burns and hemorrhages. In 94% of the cases with retinal injury, the fiberoptic was within 2000 microns of the retina. We conclude that a pulsed erbium-YAG laser allows near tractionless cutting of vitreous membranes and may have potential for clinical use if further studies show it to be efficacious and safe near the retina.\r"

Hyperplasia of lymphoid tissues was induced during a shorter period (two to five months) with a mixture of FL-OA and phorbol ester. Culture fluid from hyperplastic conjunctival lymphoid tissue showed a ratio of IgG1/IgG2 antibody production of up to 15.

Further, studies show that medical students are lenient towards dishonesty in education and practice. One result is that researchers and faculty members may turn to fraud when faced with the pressures to excel, produce, publish, be promoted, and win tenure. Also, physicians' ties to research and commercial endeavors raise questions of conflict of interest that may tarnish the medical image and compromise research findings. An AAMC ad hoc committee on research fraud identified three steps institutions might take: determination of the magnitude of the problem by a formal study; institution of guidelines for research, publication, and promotion; and establishment of policies for investigating allegations of fraud. Because of the problems of dishonesty, fraud, and conflict of interest, academic medical institutions must establish codes of conduct to govern professional life.\r"

  ".W": "Two principles shape an applied research field such as health services research. First, studies can be classified as methodological, descriptive, analytical, or experimental; and second, health services research is conducted at two levels, the doctor-patient level and the policy level. Twenty years of increasingly sophisticated description and analysis allow researchers now to measure better the appropriateness and outcome of care, both at the policy level (do cuts in medical coverage affect patients' health?) and at the individual level (does physicians' behavior affect patient compliance and thereby outcome?). Further, researchers have been able to develop increasingly useful measures of patient health status and function. Consequently, relations between the public and physicians and medical institutions will change further as patients receive more and better information about hospital mortality rates, quality-of-life measures, and similar results of health services research. Conducting good health services research is complicated, depends upon teams of physicians and social scientists working together, and produces complex, not simple, results, but it is worth the effort because the results make a difference to physicians and to the American people.\r"

  ".W": "Despite the economic growth in 1987 and 1988, there are three issues of concern: the strength of consumer spending, the risk of accelerating inflation, and the federal budget deficit. The history of recent consumer spending is reviewed, and the recommendation made that if the recent \"binge\" of 1987-1988 has caused the economy to overshoot its production capacity, monetary and fiscal policies should be adjusted to rein in the spending. Regarding inflation, despite projected productivity gains, the economy seems to be heading for a 4.5%-5.0% core rate of inflation, a rate that can surge to 1970s-like levels with any substantial bad news. The observation is made that no major sustained cut in financing costs will occur until U.S. fiscal policy is changed. Regarding the deficit, voters cannot seek more services without either higher taxes or higher interest rates; growth alone will not cure the federal deficit. The distinction between good and bad types of debt is made and the history and causes of the $ 2 trillion increase in federal debt between fiscal years 1980 and 1988 is reviewed. Corporate debt and the recent corporate acquisitions and leveraged buyouts are analyzed. Public policy considerations arise primarily from the need to limit the system risks imposed by the scale of the buyout mania and to insure fair treatment of current debt holders of target corporations. Greater regulation of pension investments may be necessary, and widespread use of change-of-ownership clauses in bonds would be productive.\r"

Ten physicians encoded 2,310 test items that constituted three previously administered certification-recertification examinations of the American Board of Family Practice. Analysis of the data for the major content of one of these certification examinations suggests that a profile based on this classification system might provide a specialty board, the residency programs, and candidates for certification with important information not produced by discipline labels or disease names. This classification system may allow a board to define more effectively the content of its examinations, monitor other requirements for certification, and communicate its standards to the medical profession and society.\r"

Intraclass correlations showed that the students were able to judge their instructors reliably. Further analyses were then carried out to determine whether students differentially evaluated the four instructor groups. Three of the descriptive items that related to overall evaluations, as well as the mean rating of all items, indicated no group differences. However, when the groups were compared on specific teaching characteristics (by means of a multiple-group discriminant function analysis), systematic differences were found. The first function differentiated the groups in terms of the cognitive and experiential characteristics of the instructors, with attending physicians being rated the highest and first-year residents the lowest. In contrast, the third function separated the groups in terms of interpersonal skills; on this function, the senior medical residents were rated the highest and preceptors the lowest. It is concluded that students make sophisticated judgments in evaluating their clinical teachers.\r"

  ".W": "One year of graduate medical education, the internship, had become the norm for graduates of most U.S. medical schools by 1920, and subsequently was adopted by most states as a criterion for licensure. The original concept of a \"resident physician\" carried with it responsibility for patients 24 hours per day, seven days per week. Recent public and media attention to the issues of residents' supervision and working hours has led to governmental efforts to restrict their hours and set minimum requirements for supervision. New York is the first state to impose specific requirements. The New York recommendations have implications for the concept of graded responsibility for residents, for learning the natural course of illness, and for the need to provide service in hospitals. Further, the recommendations raise four objections: they do not recognize differences by type of specialty or year of training; they might affect the length of time needed to acquire aggregate clinical skills; they affect different types of hospitals differently; and they would have a major effect on physician manpower. Hospitals and residency programs will face several difficult choices in responding to the regulations. To provide its members with guidelines for action, the Executive Council of the Association of American Medical Colleges has issued recommendations for residency hours and supervision, including the use of an 80-hour work-week averaged over four weeks, the continued use of graded supervision of residents in emergency rooms and in inpatient and ambulatory settings, and control of housestaff moonlighting.\r"

This study examined men and women faculty who received their first appointments in the departments of radiology and internal medicine in 1976 and who were still active in 1986. Disparities between men and women in rank attained were apparent in both specialties but were greater in radiology than in internal medicine. Other variables examined include ethnic-racial self-description and teaching, research, patient care, and administrative responsibilities.

An extensive survey of the physiology curricula in 107 U.S. medical schools conducted during the 1986-87 academic year revealed that physiology was taught as a separate course, averaging 100.1 lecture hours, 24.0 laboratory hours (usually dealing with cardiovascular and pulmonary physiology), and 25.6 conference hours. The physiology courses offered by the schools surveyed averaged 21.8 weeks in duration and were taught by an average of 13 faculty (72.5% with Ph.D. degrees, 21.8% with M.D. degrees, and 5.4% with both M.D. and Ph.D. degrees). The evolution of the physiology curriculum has been slow; as a result the need for change is great. Physiology departments must give a high priority to reorganizing and revitalizing teaching. Additionally, the physiology curriculum must be critically examined. There is an urgent need to reevaluate course content, decide the fate of the student laboratory, and develop new, innovative teaching techniques. The ubiquity of these problems among medical schools suggests that they be addressed at a national level.\r"

  ".W": "In 1983 the American Board of Internal Medicine mandated that training programs assess residents in procedural skills prior to board certification. Beginning in 1984, the University of Hawaii developed an assessment and testing program that consists of a three-phase evaluation process for qualifying internal medicine residents in basic procedural skills: an observation period spanning the three-year residency, a 100-question multiple-choice examination, and a slide-identification examination involving simple identification of body fluid elements. From 1984 through 1987 the mean scores of both examinations were analyzed for each level of residency and for each year of testing to assess whether curriculum changes were effective. There was a statistically significant improvement (p less than .005) in performance on both the multiple-choice and the slide-identification examinations as the residents progressed through the program. No difference in performance was found for the multiple-choice examination between calendar years, but a significant difference (p less than .01) was found for the slide-identification examination between calendar years. Despite perceptions by the faculty that their increased emphasis on the learning of procedural skills has been successful, the multiple-choice examination results over time do not support this belief. These findings suggest that residents need more structured curriculum guidelines to aid their learning and faculty members require better direction in the educational goals for procedural skills training.\r"

Recently, there has been an increased incidence among patients, particularly with the rise in cocaine abuse and trauma. The variety of proposed methods of repair points to the lack of a definitive solution for successful surgical treatment of nasoseptal perforations. Successful septal perforation repairs using an open rhinoplasty approach with bipedicled mucoperichondrial flaps and temporal fascia grafts were achieved in eight of nine patients in a series. Resident otolaryngologists in training were the primary surgeons in all nine patients. The open rhinoplasty approach affords better exposure to the septal perforation than does a closed technique, and it facilitates the elevation of mucoperichondrial flaps on all sides of the perforation. This method also allows the surgeon access to perform a limited concurrent rhinoplasty when indicated. The open rhinoplasty approach is ideally suited for teaching the technique of large septal perforation closure in surgical training programs. The surgical considerations in using this method are discussed.\r"

Development of maxillary sinus, nasal mucociliary transport, and ciliary beating frequency of ciliated cells were also examined. The saccharin test indicated that nasal mucociliary transport was impaired. This impairment is believed to be one of the reasons for the high incidence of sinusitis in patients with cleft palate.\r"

The subjects in the OME group had significantly longer ABR latencies for waves III and V, with the most compelling delay for wave III and the III-I interwave interval. Although wave I prolongation in the OME group was not significant, the possible contribution of a peripheral effect on the latencies of waves III and V was investigated. The typical gender effect for the ABR latencies was unaltered in the OME group, and there was no group by gender interaction. We suggest that although the data support increased ABR latencies for children with a history of OME, they do not establish a causal relationship.\r"

There was no significant difference between thresholds for round-window and scala tympani stimulation. Amplitude/intensity functions for the EMLR differed with site of stimulation. The EMLR seems to be comparable with the EABR for assessing the electrical excitability of the auditory pathway with less electrical artifact contamination.

Mucus glycoproteins were responsible for effusion viscosity. Their percentage by weight in thick and thin effusions was 25% and 8.2%, respectively. N-acetylcysteine and 0.2 mol/L of mercaptoethanol caused a 39% viscosity drop in a 5-mg/mL glycoprotein solution, whereas S-carboxymethylcysteine had no effect. Treatment of thick effusions with 0.2 mol/L of mercaptoethanol initially caused a viscosity decrease followed by a gradual increase. Higher reducing agent concentrations (0.5 mol/L) caused a more rapid decrease followed by a rapid increase, presumably by causing nonspecific aggregation of reduced protein molecules. These results suggest that the concentration of and the time that a mucolytic is in the middle ear would be of prime importance in achieving the desired decrease in viscosity.\r"

Observations of this patient population provided the basis for describing pathological variations of internal derangements. Radiologic studies, including tomograms and arthrograms or magnetic resonance scans, and surgical/pathological findings were correlated with clinical data in each case. It was found that clinical manifestations varied in a characteristic way and were directly related to the degree of pathological change and time course. Various stages of internal derangements were identified. Pathophysiological mechanisms responsible for the observed changes, as well as clinical signs and symptoms and causal factors, were discussed. Internal derangements are organic lesions that appear to be progressive and are probably of traumatic origin. The view is given that internal derangements represent the basic pathological entity responsible for clinical manifestations of what has been known as the temporomandibular joint pain-dysfunction syndrome or similarly described conditions. Effective clinical management takes on new importance because progression to advanced degenerative states may occur.\r"

Herein are reported the characteristics of two new lines derived from human MCT that are tumorigenic in athymic mice and do not secrete CT. After treatment with various concentrations of retinoic acid (a vitamin A derivative) and cyclic adenosine monophosphate, both lines exhibit the traits of more differentiated cells with a decrease in cellular proliferation and an increase in cytoplasmic CT content as shown by in situ immunoperoxidase staining. These cell lines should prove of great value in the study of the biology of MCT and the mechanisms underlying induced differentiation in this type of tumor.\r"

However, there was no difference in the recovery time of the EP between the two groups. The results indicate that access to the site of furosemide action in the cochlea is dependent on the unbound fraction of furosemide and that the albumin-bound furosemide alleviates the EP depression induced by furosemide alone with the augmentation of diuresis.\r"

Eighteen (42%) of these 43 patients were initially misdiagnosed as having cervical adenitis and were treated with antibiotics. The otolaryngologist may see these patients in referral and should consider the diagnosis of KD in patients with cervical adenopathy, prolonged fever, signs of mucosal inflammation, or rash.

The onset of the first vibration of the third heart sound coincided with peak left ventricular inflow blood velocity to within 5 ms in all but two of the patients. The mean (SD) difference between the two events was 5 (5) ms, which did not differ significantly from zero. The relation was similar in patients with primary myocardial disease (11), and in those with valve disease (26), hypertension (five), and coronary artery disease (four). In the normal children, the mean interval was 2.5 (5) ms--not significantly different from zero. By contrast, the first deflection of the fourth heart sound consistently preceded the timing of peak atrial inflow velocity by 55 (10) ms. Agreement was much closer between the onset of atrial flow and the onset of the atrial sound (mean difference 1 (5) ms, not significantly different from zero). Gallop sounds seem to be closely related to changes in ventricular inflow velocity, and thus to the effects of forces acting on blood flow. The forces underlying the third sound seem to arise within the ventricle and are responsible for sudden deceleration of flow during rapid ventricular filling. The fourth sound, occurring at the onset of the \"a\" wave, is more likely to arise from dissipation of forces causing acceleration of blood flow--that is, atrial systole itself.\r"

Age and the extent and distribution of coronary artery disease were similar in the two groups. At rest, blood pressure, pulmonary artery wedge pressure, cardiac index, forearm vascular resistance, and oxygen consumption were similar in the two groups. During supine leg exercise on a bicycle ergometer mean blood pressure increased in group 2 but did not change in group 1. Increases in cardiac index, pulmonary artery wedge pressure, and oxygen consumption during leg exercise were not significantly different in the two groups but forearm vascular resistance increased less in group 1 than in group 2. There was a positive correlation between the magnitude of the change in mean blood pressure and change in forearm vascular resistance during leg exercise. The impaired response of blood pressure to leg exercise in group 1 was not the result of a failure of the cardiac index to increase. The results suggest the possibility that attenuation of reflex vasoconstriction in non-exercising muscles may contribute to the impaired response of blood pressure to exercise in patients with coronary artery disease.\r"

Profound bradycardia (less than 35 beats/min) occurred in eight athletes but only one control. Eight athletes and two controls had asystolic pauses ranging from 1.8 to 15 seconds. Six athletes had first degree heart block, four had Mobitz II second degree block, and three had complete heart block. Most conduction abnormalities occurred at night and resolved during exercise. Ventricular ectopic activity was not significantly different between the groups. Thus heart block patterns and profound bradycardia are more frequent in older athletes than their youthful counterparts.\r"

All patients studied had normal left ventricular function and a normal sinus node rate response to exercise. Cardiac output was measured by continuous wave Doppler and was calculated as the product of stroke distance measured by Doppler at the left ventricular outflow, aortic root area measured by M mode echocardiography, and heart rate. Pacemakers were programmed in the DDD mode. Cardiac output was measured with the patient at rest while supine and while erect and at the peak of submaximal exercise (the end of stage 1 of the Bruce protocol) with the pacemakers programmed to the following atrioventricular intervals: 75-80 ms, 100-110 ms, 140-150 ms, and 200 ms. During exercise the basic pacing rate was programmed to 70 beats/min. Cardiac output at rest while supine and erect was greatest with an atrioventricular delay of 140-150 ms and it was significantly higher than that with an atrioventricular delay of 75-80 ms. On average there was a 31% decrease in cardiac output when patients stood up. During treadmill exercise, however, cardiac output was greatest when the atrioventricular delay was 75-80 ms, and this was significantly higher than the cardiac output with atrioventricular delays of 150 and 200 ms. During exercise 1:1 atrioventricular relations were maintained in patients at all atrioventricular intervals. In patients with atrioventricular sequential pacemakers cardiac output at rest is greatest with an atrioventricular delay of 140-150 ms but during exercise the optimal atrioventricular delay is shorter.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The relation between standardised mortality ratios for coronary deaths (1979-83) for 56 local government districts and a range of socioeconomic factors from the 1981 Census as well as climatic factors and water hardness were investigated. Strong associations were seen with several measures of social disadvantage, the strongest being with percentage of male unemployment. A fitted multiple regression model with mortality from coronary heart disease in men found independent effects of two social variables (percentage male unemployment and percentage social class III-V) and one climatic factor (rainfall). The model explained much (73%) of the geographical variation in mortality from coronary heart disease, but part of the geographical pattern, in particular some of the east-west gradient in mortality, remained unexplained by it. Explanations for the geographical variation and the association with economic factors are currently being sought in terms of individual risk factors in a large screening study, the Scottish Heart Health Study.\r"

Volumes were calculated by Simpson's rule from casts of postmortem specimens from patients with congenital heart disease. The casts were divided into two groups: those that came from patients with abnormal right ventricular haemodynamic function (group 1, n = 11) and those that came from patients in which it was normal (group 2, n = 9). Biplane cinegrams were taken in conventional (anteroposterior/lateral, right anterior oblique/left anterior oblique) and non-conventional (long axis oblique, hepatoclavicular, and sitting up) projections. The true volume of each cast was determined from its weight and specific gravity. Correlations between measured and true volumes (r = 0.96 to 0.99) were excellent in all projections, although each projection overestimated the true volumes (slope = 0.72 to 0.94). The regression equations obtained from conventional views were significantly different from those from the non-conventional views; however, the regression slopes in group 1 were not different from those in group 2 in any view. Regression equations obtained by Simpson's rule do not seem to be affected by the haemodynamic state of the right ventricle. Different regression equations are required to measure left ventricular volumes from non-conventional angiograms.\r"

  ".W": "Balloon dilatation of the aortic valve was attempted in 34 consecutive children aged 16 months to 17 years (median 7 years), weight range 9-60 (median 22) kg. Previous surgical valvotomy had been performed in two patients (twice in one of them). The valve was not crossed in one patient. In the remaining 33 patients the pressure difference between the left ventricle and the ascending aorta during systole was reduced from 71 (30) to 28 (19) mm Hg. In 24 patients recatheterisation 2-19 (mean 9) months later showed gradients that were similar to those immediately after balloon dilatation (35 (20) v 31 (20) mm Hg). The two patients with the highest residual gradients immediately after balloon dilatation showed a spontaneous reduction in gradient at repeat catheterisation, whereas the patient who had twice had previous surgical valvotomy showed an increase in gradient from 37 to 99 mm Hg over nine months and required aortic root replacement. Balloon dilatation was repeated in two patients and this caused a further reduction in gradient. New aortic regurgitation occurred in nine (27%) patients (grade I, 8; grade II, 1) and aortic regurgitation was exacerbated (grade I to II) in two of the nine with pre-existing aortic regurgitation. External iliac artery avulsion occurred in one (3%) patient and two (6%) required intravenous streptokinase because the femoral artery became occluded. There were no other complications. Open valvotomy was performed in the child in whom the valve was not crossed, but no other child required aortic valve operation. Balloon dilatation of the aortic valve gave reasonable short term palliation and was well tolerated.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Patients with anomalous origin of the left coronary artery from the pulmonary trunk usually have a large right coronary artery. This study examines the diagnostic value of measuring the diameter of the right coronary artery by echocardiography in distinguishing between this lesion and other causes of dilated cardiomyopathy. The diameter of the right coronary artery and the right coronary artery/aorta ratio were measured in the parasternal short axis view in 40 controls, 11 patients with dilated cardiomyopathy, and 10 with anomalous origin of the left coronary artery from the pulmonary trunk. In the controls, the diameter of the right coronary artery increased with age, but the right coronary artery/aorta ratio remained constant. In the control group the 95% upper limits of prediction for right coronary artery diameter were 1.6 mm for one month of age, 1.8 mm for three months, 2.0 mm for one year, 2.2 mm for two years, 2.4 mm for three years, 2.6 mm for four years, 2.7 mm for six years, 3.0 mm for eight years, and 3.2 mm for 10 years; and for right coronary/aorta ratios the limits were 0.17 for one month to one year, 0.18 for one to six years, 0.19 for six to 10 years, and 0.20 for more than 10 years. All patients with dilated cardiomyopathy had normal right coronary artery diameters and right coronary artery/aorta ratios (0.10-0.13). Those patients with anomalous origin of the left coronary artery from the pulmonary trunk had larger than normal right coronary artery diameter and a significant increase in the right coronary artery/aorta ratio (0.21-0.29). The presence of an anomalous left coronary artery was likely if the diameter of the right coronary artery or the right coronary artery/aorta ratio was larger than the normal 95% limits of prediction.\r"

  ".W": "To assess left ventricular diastolic filling in patients with amyloid heart disease 12 patients with familial amyloid polyneuropathy and 15 normal subjects were studied by pulsed Doppler echocardiography. None of the patients had clinical evidence of overt heart disease or restrictive cardiomyopathy and only two of them showed ventricular wall thickening. The peak flow velocity of rapid diastolic filling and the acceleration rate of early diastolic inflow were significantly lower in patients with familial amyloid polyneuropathy than in controls. The pressure half time was significantly longer in patients than in controls. In addition, the peak flow velocity during atrial contraction and the ratio of atrial peak flow velocity to rapid diastolic peak flow velocity were significantly greater in patients than in controls. Although there were no significant correlations between measurements of diastolic filling and clinical findings in patients with familial amyloid polyneuropathy, the ratio of atrial peak flow velocity to rapid diastolic peak flow velocity was significantly related to left ventricular posterior wall thickness. These findings suggest that in patients with cardiac amyloidosis without restrictive cardiomyopathy, abnormal left ventricular diastolic filling, manifested by a reduction in the rate and volume of rapid diastolic filling with enhanced atrial contraction, can be seen even in the early stage of the disease.\r"

Barrier pressure (BrP = lower oesophageal sphincter (LOS) pressure minus gastric pressure) increased significantly (by 25%) following cisapride, but not placebo, within 10 min of injection; following the combined administration of atropine and neostigmine, there was an abrupt decrease in mean BrP in the cisapride group from 37.0 (SEM 4.5) cm H2O to 24.1 (3.2) cm H2O (P less than 0.01) and in the control group from 26.6 (4.8) cm H2O to 19.9 (3.1) cm H2O (P less than 0.05) 2 min after injection. Subsequently, there was a small increase in BrP to values not significantly lower than control measurements.

Motility was measured by manometry and gastric emptying rate by the rate of paracetamol absorption. During anaesthesia, gastric emptying was delayed in eight patients. General anaesthesia with halothane reduced the duration of the interdigestive motility complex (P less than 0.01), mainly by a shortening of phase II (P less than 0.01) which correlated with the inhaled concentrations of halothane (P less than 0.01). Anaesthesia impeded the occurrence of antral contractions during phase II (P less than 0.01); the frequency of contractions was unchanged during anaesthesia, but decreased during the recovery period (P less than 0.01). The amplitudes of antral contractions diminished with anaesthesia (P less than 0.01), but increased after operation. The frequency of contractions in the duodenum was unchanged during phase II and reduced during phase III (P less than 0.01). Gastric pH increased during and after operation (P less than 0.01). General anaesthesia with halothane affects gastroduodenal motility especially during phase II, increases gastric pH and delays gastric emptying rate.\r"

There was a greater amount of isolated forearm movement when enflurane was used. The three main criteria for a satisfactory general anaesthetic technique for Caesarean section were fulfilled, namely no maternal awareness, no undue depression of the fetus and no adverse effect on uterine contractility. Isoflurane and enflurane appear to be suitable anaesthetic agents for facilitating hyperoxygenation during Caesarean section.\r"

A 33-yr-old male anaesthetist, with no family or personal history of allergy, collapsed soon after induction of anaesthesia. The drugs used included fentanyl, droperidol, thiopentone and pancuronium. Diffuse erythema occurred, with probable cardiac arrest. The patient was treated with cardiac massage, sympathomimetics and cortisone, and made a complete recovery. Examination (skin tests, passive transfer according to Prausnitz and Kustner, in vitro lymphocyte transformation test, total IgE assay) revealed that the allergic reaction was to pancuronium bromide.\r"

LTB4 was irradiated with dosages of UVB (290-320 nm) ranging from 100-1500 mJ cm-2 and with dosages of UVA (320-400 nm) ranging from 5-40 J cm-2. Topical application of UVB irradiated LTB4 to the forearm skin of normal volunteers showed a marked reduction in cutaneous erythema, paralleled histologically by reduced transepidermal PMN migration when compared with sites of application of unirradiated and UVA irradiated LTB4. High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) demonstrated a dose-dependent photodegradation of LTB4 by UVB irradiation. UVA irradiation produced no such effect. The wavelengths responsible lie within the absorption spectrum of LTB4. In vitro chemotaxis studies, using an under agarose technique, showed a statistically significant reduction in the migration of PMN from both psoriatic and non-psoriatic subjects to the UVB irradiated LTB4 compared with the unirradiated LTB4, whilst UVA irradiated LTB4 produced a normal PMN chemotactic response.\r"

  ".W": "The metabolism of benzo(a)pyrene (BP), a ubiquitous environmental carcinogen, and its subsequent binding to DNA, and the repair of UV-induced DNA damage were studied in fibroblasts cultured from the skin of a 61-year-old male who had multiple BCC (greater than 100) on his left upper trunk. Biopsies were obtained and fibroblasts cultured from clinically normal tumour-free skin adjacent to tumour-bearing sites (TBS) and from visibly uninvolved normal skin (UNS) at distant sites. The cultured cells were incubated with [3H]-BP for 24 h and BP metabolism was assessed by HPLC and the formation of BP-diols, quinones and phenols verified. Total BP metabolism was 45% lower in TBS fibroblasts than in UNS fibroblasts. The formation of BP-7,8-diol, the precursor of the carcinogenic end product of BP metabolism, was 53% lower in TBS cells than in UNS cells. Pretreatment of UNS cells with benz(a)anthracene (BA) (x 10(-4) M) did not significantly affect BP metabolite formation whereas BA-treatment of TBS cells resulted in 55% and 76% increases in total BP metabolism and BP-7,8-diol formation, respectively. Treatment of TBS cells with BA also caused a substantial increase (95%) in BP-DNA adduct formation. Whereas DNA-binding in UNS cells was unaffected by this treatment. In response to irradiation with 2J/m2 UVC, total DNA repair was similar in both cell types; on alkaline elution it appeared that the TBS cells were more efficient in repairing UV-induced DNA strand breaks. These results suggest that BP metabolism and repair of DNA are altered in TBS cells and that patients with this type of metabolic profile may be at higher risk of the development of cutaneous neoplasms. It is also possible that fibroblasts from tumour bearing skin undergo some as yet unexplained alteration in carcinogen metabolism as a consequence of the induction of neoplasia.\r"

Histological examination of biopsies performed 1 h, 5 h, 24 h, 72 h and 144 h post-irradiation revealed onset within 5 h of perivascular cellular infiltration. The infiltrate was dominated by lymphocytes in both early and established lesions, without evident epidermal pathology. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated a predominance of CD4+ cells in lesions up to 72 h post-induction, but later biopsies were dominated by a CD8+ infiltrate. Significantly increased numbers of dermal macrophages and CD1b+ cells were detected 1 h and 5 h post-irradiation, respectively. These findings are consistent with a delayed type hypersensitivity response underlying the pathogenesis of polymorphic light eruption.\r"

Only one lesion recurred after attempted removal. This lesion in the past may, have been mistaken for a Spitz naevus. Immunohistochemical findings mirror those of ordinary histiocytomas. In particular approximately 50% of the constituent cells label with a polyclonal antibody directed against factor XIIIa--an antibody that labels dermal fixed connective tissue cells (fibrocytes) and cells in ordinary histiocytoma, but not the cells of Spitz or common melanocytic naevi.\r"

The higher exposure to house dust mites corresponded to a relative risk of 4.6 and a clear dose-response relationship between exposure and disease could be demonstrated. Our results illustrate a clear association between moderate to severe atopic dermatitis and increased exposure to house dust mites in the patients' homes, and support the hypothesis that mite antigens could be an aetiological factor in atopic dermatitis.\r"

In the asymptomatic women both age and parity appeared to be related to the morphological features of the samples and in particular those obtained from the posterior part of the pubococcygeus. In the symptomatic women there was a significant increase in the number of muscle fibres showing pathological damage which were obtained from the posterior part of the pelvic floor. The range of diameters of both Type I and Type II fibres obtained from this region was significantly different between symptomatic and asymptomatic women. These findings may be attributable to partial denervation of the pelvic floor in patients with urinary stress incontinence with or without genital tract prolapse.\r"

  ".U": "89166427\r", 
  ".W": "Saliva aldosterone concentration was measured in samples collected at hourly intervals from healthy pregnant women (approximately 26 and 36 weeks gestation) who were going about their normal daily activities, and from some women hospitalized for disorders of pregnancy. In the healthy women diurnal saliva aldosterone fluctuated considerably, the highest values being 2-22 times the lowest on a given day. Because of the known correlation between saliva and plasma aldosterone concentrations we believe that the fluctuating salivary level is indicative of fluctuating plasma levels and that this is due to the intermittent secretion of aldosterone. The rate of decline of saliva aldosterone from peak levels indicated a half life (t 1/2) of 72 (SD 31) min which was not significantly different from that in non-pregnant subjects. The temporal pattern of saliva aldosterone suggests an enhanced response of the zona glomerulosa to the factors that cause aldosterone secretion to fluctuate in non-pregnant subjects, rather than the development of a more potent stimulus to the zona glomerulosa during pregnancy. In addition to hour-to-hour variation there is also substantial day-to-day variation, so that estimation of aldosterone in a single sample of saliva or plasma is of little value during pregnancy. The mean diurnal aldosterone concentration can be estimated from five saliva samples so this measurement presents a convenient technique for the assessment of aldosterone status in pregnancy. In contrast to healthy pregnancy, a patient with pre-eclampsia at 39 weeks gestation showed no elevation of saliva aldosterone above non-pregnant levels at any time during the day.\r"

Seven of the eight permanent catheters were removed because of complications; intraperitoneal adhesions were a major problem in this group. Overall, 137 temporary catheters were inserted (14G Venflon i.v. cannula in 119, Verres needle in 15, and a Trocath peritoneal dialysis catheter in 3 instances) but it was not possible to perform a peritoneal lavage in 42 (30%). Access to the peritoneal cavity was unsatisfactory on 29 (34%) occasions when a Venflon cannula was used, either because there was inadequate flow of lavage fluid into the peritoneal cavity or this was limited by pain. Perforation of the bowel occurred in 12 (9%) cases but there was no significant morbidity. Problems with achieving reliable peritoneal access using either permanent or temporary catheters may limit the potential advantages of the intraperitoneal route for treatment and monitoring.\r"

High-resolution CT enabled a clear diagnosis in 80% of cases, conventional radiology in 63%; 1.6-times more bone information was recorded by high-resolution CT which is clearly superior for imaging cholesteatomas, metastases and inflammatory processes and for evaluating osseous destruction. With regard to pathological soft tissue or effusions filling the tympanic cavities, conventional radiology shows poor sensitivity (0.61). High-resolution CT is the most sensitive method for the imaging and classification of temporal bone fractures, including labyrinthine damage and ossicular chain injuries. Only in cases of atypical fractures with an unfavourable relationship to the CT planes, can carefully directed tomography be more effective. In most cases high-resolution CT replaces conventional radiology and should be the method of choice for comprehensive radiological examination of the temporal bone.\r"

It is commonly assumed that the neck axis is a straight line connecting the centre of the femoral head, the centre of the femoral neck and the axis of the femoral shaft. However, the line through the centre of the femoral head and neck crosses anterior to the axis of the femoral shaft. A distinction has therefore to be made between two principal different definitions of anteversion, denoted ANTEV 1 and ANTEV 2 in this paper, depending on the precise definition of the neck axis. Previous studies have indicated substantial differences between these definitions. The present study, using precise measuring methods, shows that the definitions have a systematic but small spread of differences. The large individual variation previously found between the two definitions is therefore caused mainly by the measuring methods and to a lesser extent by real anatomical variations.\r"

  ".W": "Eight millimetre diameter angioplasty balloon catheters of both the Gruntzig and Olbert types from five manufacturers have been tested in vitro to establish bursting pressures and the changes in maximum and deflated diameters following repeated inflations, both when free and within a restraining sleeve. Maximum inflated diameters were within 10% of that stated and all types of balloon except one burst at a pressure greater than the recommended value. Deflated diameters were approximately 1 mm greater than insertion diameters, which are much smaller in the Olbert type. All balloons became a little larger with each of the first few distensions, and became stiffer. The maximum diameter was reached and remained constant after 10-15 distensions. Distension within a latex sleeve did not change bursting pressures, and it is considered that results from unconstrained testing can be extrapolated to behaviour in vivo. Computer modelling and calculation of maximum stress resultants also showed that calculated longitudinal and circumferential stresses are unaffected by applied restrictions. It is concluded that balloon technology is steadily improving and it is suggested that British Standards should be established for dilatation balloon catheters. Amongst other factors these Standards should include maximum recommended inflation pressures that are at least 2 atm less than bursting pressures, whilst the stated maximum diameter should be for fully extended balloons, and should have a tolerance of more than +/- 10%.\r"

These abscesses were subsequent to abdominal surgery (28 patients), biliary obstruction and/or fistula (six patients), trauma (two patients) or acute pancreatitis (one patient). The procedures were usually monitored by duplex sonography and fluoroscopy (35 out of 40 cases), with an angled subcostal approach to the subphrenic space in over 85% of the cases. Forty-three drainage catheters were inserted using the Seldinger method; 37 (86%) had a size of 12 F or more, 21 were 16 F in size. Only two out of 43 catheters were double-lumen sump drains. The clinical condition improved after insertion of the catheter in all 37 patients. Definitive successful drainage, defined as hospital discharge without complementary surgery, was achieved in 32 patients (87%), without major complications. A temporizing effect was obtained in three additional patients (8%) who underwent curative surgery for the underlying process after complete drainage of the abscess. Two patients died from multiple organ failure before their abscess healed. Considerations for successful drainage of subphrenic abscesses include a good knowledge of the subphrenic space anatomy, the use of large-bore drainage catheters and the recognition and correct management of underlying enteric, biliary or pancreatic fistulas.\r"

This substantial rise has occurred because of an increase in patient throughput, higher radiation doses associated with modern CT scanners and an increasing proportion of (higher dose) body CT studies. The mean patient dose on a second generation (EMI 5005) scanner was about 1.4 mSv, whereas the corresponding doses on third generation scanners operating in Manitoba were 3.9 mSv (GE 9800) and 5.6 mSv (Siemens DRH).\r"

Forty randomly selected physicians were separated into three groups: those who would be involved in establishing the criteria (15), those who would receive the criteria by mail (15) and those who would act as controls and not be aware of the criteria (10). We found no significant difference between the three groups in the number of hypertensive patients whose condition remained uncontrolled after the intervention. We conclude that physicians' participation in the establishment of standards of care for conditions such as hypertension or their awareness of such standards does not independently result in significantly better patient outcomes. Consequently, we recommend that physicians and health care planners concerned with improving outcomes not rely on any single intervention strategy when planning change.\r"

  ".U": "89167997\r", 
  ".W": "In January 1986 two brief power failures occurring within an hour of each other affected the operation of visual display terminals in a section of the Manitoba Telephone System. After the power failures three operators reported an alarming tingling sensation in their arms and one side of their body, which they called \"shocks\". Other operators then began to report incidents of numbness and tingling in their limbs, face or head as well as other, diffuse symptoms. During the next 2 weeks 92 such incidents were reported by 55 operators. The media carried alarming headlines, and medical practitioners perpetuated the label of \"electric shock\". Despite extensive investigation, which revealed no electrical fault, the section was closed by the regulatory authority, and an independent medical panel was convened to review the findings. The panel concluded that there was no immediate hazard to life or health and recommended continued workplace assessment and follow-up of affected operators; however, because the panel lacked electrical engineering expertise, uncertainty persisted as to the cause of the events. The reports of incidents persisted, peaking in association with continued rumours of diagnoses of \"nerve damage\". In the fall of 1987 a multidisciplinary committee ruled out as causative factors all known hazards other than electrostatic shock and occupational stress. This costly and lengthy investigation underlines the danger in regarding collective stress reaction as a diagnosis of exclusion. It highlights the need to scrutinize objective evidence before validating potentially unfounded concerns and underlines the desirability of considering the psychosocial effects of technology and regimented tasks.\r"

  ".U": "89168065\r", 
  ".W": "The results of 144 previously untreated cases of primary Ewing's sarcoma of bone are reported with a minimum follow-up of 5 years. This series was treated between 1972 and 1982 at Istituto Ortopedico Rizzoli with a combined therapy. The local control of the disease consisted of amputation (ten cases), resection followed by radiation therapy (35-45 Gy) (48 cases) and radiation therapy alone (40-60 Gy) (86 cases). Adjuvant chemotherapy, rigorously standardized, was performed according two different protocols: the first (85 cases treated in the period 1972-1978) consisted of vincristine (VCR) Adriamycin (doxorubicin) (ADM), and cyclophosphamide (EDX); the second (59 cases treated in the period 1979-1982) of VCR, ADM, EDX and dactinomycin (DACT). At a follow-up of 5 to 16 years (median, 9), 59 patients (41%) are continuously disease-free (CDF), 81 (56%) developed metastatic disease and/or local recurrence, and four (3%) had a second malignancy. Three factors seem to be correlated to prognosis: the site of the initial lesion (only 23% of the pelvic lesions are represented in the CDF group versus 46% of the other locations); the chemotherapy protocol (32% of the cases in the first protocol are CDF versus 54% in the second); the type of local treatment (60% of the patients treated with amputation or resection plus radiotherapy versus 28% of those treated with radiation therapy alone are CDF). A local recurrence was observed in 24% of the patients (8% in the group locally treated with surgery or surgery plus radiation therapy versus 36% in the group treated with radiation therapy alone). These data suggest that even though adjuvant chemotherapy can improve the long-term results in localized Ewing's sarcoma patients, this disease still represents, in a high percentage of cases, a lethal process whose final prognosis widely depends on the local control of the lesion. Due to the questionable effect of the radiation therapy alone in controlling the primary lesion and its important side effects, the role of surgery in treating Ewing's sarcoma of bone should be extended.\r"

  ".W": "The authors have reported previously that conventionally defined grades of tumor morphology do not correlate with tumor response or survival in advanced squamous cell cancers of the head and neck (SCCHN) treated with cisplatinum combination induction therapy. This lack of correlation may be the result of the imprecision and subjectiveness of the conventional grade determination. To examine this possibility, response and survival were correlated with individual parameters of morphologic differentiation in 136 patients with advanced, untreated SCCHN. A multi-variable analysis of degree of keratinization, number of mitotic figures per high powered field, degree of nuclear differentiation, presence of vascular invasion, intensity of inflammatory response, and invasion pattern of the cancer was performed. The grade of each variable was weighted by assigning a score from 1 to 4, with 1 representing the most differentiated and 4 the least. The cumulative score of each specimen was tallied and assigned to one of three groups, less than 12, 12 to 18, and greater than 18, analogous to the conventional grades of well, moderately, and poorly differentiated, respectively. No correlation between the grade of individual morphologic variables and response to chemotherapy was demonstrated, or between tumor response and cumulative score groups. There was no correlation of the grade of individual morphologic variables or cumulative score groups with survival. Only the survival of patients achieving a complete response to chemotherapy was correlated with the cumulative score groups: 2-year survivals of 84%, 70%, and 46% for less than 12, 12 to 18, and greater than 18, respectively. Multi-parameter analysis of individual features of tumor differentiation is not superior to conventional morphologic analysis in predicting response to chemotherapy or survival in patients with advanced SCCHN.\r"

  ".W": "The authors report on combination chemotherapy in 22 patients (seven men, 15 women; age 20-67, median 38.5 years) with incompletely resected invasive thymoma. Twelve of 22 patients have had prior radiotherapy of the tumor (four of 12 local failure, eight of 12 remote metastases). By subsequent chemotherapy five of 12 obtained complete remission (CR). One of them died by relapsed tumor, another by an intercurrent infection. At 5 years after diagnosis the survival rate of the 12/22 patients was 33% (Kaplan-Meier). Ten of 22 patients received chemotherapy as primary treatment of incompletely resected thymoma. Four of 10 obtained CR. One of them was lost during follow-up, the others received adjuvant irradiation of the mediastinum and are free of disease. Two of ten obtained partial remission (PR), but relapsed within 6 months after chemotherapy. At 3 years after diagnosis the survival rate of the 10/22 patients was 34%. Thirteen of 22 patients received cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone (CHOP) or CHOP/bleomycin as first chemotherapeutic regimen. Five of them achieved CR. Cyclophosphamide, vincristine, and prednisone (COP) or COP plus procarbazine (COPP) was administered to six of 22. Three of them obtained a CR and one a PR. In an alternating manner COPP and Einhorn regimens were given to two of 22, one of which had a CR. In one of 22 the doxorubicin, bleomycin, cisplatin, prednisone (BAPP) regimen was followed by a PR. The authors conclude that combination chemotherapy is effective in the first-line postsurgical treatment of incompletely resected thymoma and also in the treatment of local or metastatic relapses after radiotherapy.\r"

  ".U": "89168068\r", 
  ".W": "Euoxic and hypoxic BP-8 murine sarcoma cells were exposed for up to 3 hours to various concentrations of three nitroimidazole derivatives (misonidazole, Ro 03-8799, RSU-1164) at normal or elevated incubation temperatures. Cell survival was monitored with the iodine 125 (125I)-iododeoxyuridine prelabeling assay. When cell lethality was evaluated as a function of drug molarity, the three nitroimidazoles displayed widely different toxicities, but when expressed in terms of toxicity ratio between euoxic and hypoxic cells, all three drugs showed nearly identical toxicity differentials of 16 to 18 in 1-hour drug incubation experiments. Prolonging the treatment period to 3 hours did not change the euoxic/hypoxic toxicity ratio for misonidazole and Ro 03-8799, but with RSU-1164 the toxicity ratio was increased significantly from 16 (1 hour) to 73 (3 hours). This increase was attributed to the bifunctional action of RSU-1164 as a combined electron-affinic and alkylating agent, with the alkylation component of cell killing becoming more pronounced after prolonged drug incubation under hypoxic conditions. Combined administration of hyperthermia and nitroimidazoles increased drug-induced cell lethality for all three agents, but did not materially change the relative toxicity differential between euoxic and hypoxic cells. In short, based on cellular toxicity data, Ro 03-8799 appears to offer no advantage over misonidazole as a selective cytocidal agent for hypoxic cells, but RSU-1164 does provide a moderate therapeutic advantage.\r"

  ".W": "The current study compares the outcome within 3 years after diagnosis in two groups of histologically confirmed Stage II-IV ovarian carcinoma patients in complete clinical remission with minimal or no residual disease at second-look laparotomy, performed after completion of cisplatin-based combination chemotherapy. One group (n = 18) received after reexploration abdominopelvic irradiation (RT group), the other, diagnosed during a later period (n = 19), received three courses of intraperitoneal cisplatin chemotherapy with systemic thiosulfate protection (IP group). The two groups were comparable with regard to age, stage at diagnosis, histologic category, grade of differentiation, size of residual tumor after the initial operation, and rate of negative second-look laparotomy. The overall survival probability after diagnosis was significantly better in the IP group, the maximal difference being observed at 36 months: 76.6% versus 44.4% in the RT group (P = 0.04). This difference was mainly evident in patients with a negative second-look laparotomy in whom the respective survival probabilities were 100% versus 70% (P = 0.04). Survival was significantly shorter (P less than 0.01) in patients with a positive second-look, and there was a nonsignificant trend for better survival in the IP group. Significantly improved probability of progression-free interval after diagnosis was also found in the IP group, the maximal difference being observed at 22 months: 78.3% as compared to 50.9% in the RT group (P = 0.04). This difference was again limited to patients with negative second-look, the respective values being 100% versus 60% (P = 0.05). Our retrospective data suggest an apparent advantage to intraperitoneal cisplatin treatment in these patients which should be further explored for definite evaluation.\r"

  ".U": "89168072\r", 
  ".W": "Because Forssman antigen, one of the most well-known heteroantigens, has been noted in certain cancerous tissues, it would seem that the serum levels of the Forssman antibody of patients with these cancers would be low, owing to the absorption of the naturally occurring antibody by the Forssman antigen-containing cancerous tissues. This hypothesis was tested by researchers assessing the serum hemolysin titers of 174 patients with cancer (gastric cancer, 100; colonic cancer, 40; and other cancers, 45) and of 856 age-matched, sex-matched, and blood type-matched healthy individuals against the serum levels of sheep red blood cells. Serum levels of the hemolysin of patients with gastric cancer tend to be lower than those of patients with other types of cancer and also lower than those of age-matched and sex-matched controls. The decrease was especially prominent in patients with moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma of the stomach. Preoperative and postoperative serum samples of 40 patients with gastric cancer were analyzed therefore to determine the effect of surgically removing the cancer on the serum level of the hemolysin. The results showed that the serum levels of the hemolysin antibody increased in all 40 patients after the successful surgical removal of the cancer. However, in patients with recurrence of the cancer, the serum levels of hemolysin decreased again in 11 of 11 patients. These results indicate that the serum levels of the Forssman-like hemolysin could be used as an index of recurrence in patients with gastric cancer after surgical removal of the cancer.\r"

  ".W": "Splenic extramedullary hematopoiesis (EMH) is a characteristic finding in agnogenic myeloid metaplasia (AMM) and in the spent phase of polycythemia vera (PV). Evidence from our laboratory has suggested that splenic EMH in these conditions results from the filtration of circulating hematopoietic cells from the peripheral blood and does not arise de novo from splenic stem cells. To further test this hypothesis, 31 autopsy and 26 surgical cases of carcinoma metastatic to the bone marrow were studied. The presence of leukoerythroblastosis (LEB) correlated with intravascular hematopoiesis (IVH) in the bone marrows associated with reticulin fibrosis, and with splenic EMH in the autopsy cases. These studies provide evidence that stromal changes in the bone marrow with resulting IVH, LEB, and splenic EMH are not unique to AMM and PV but also occur in such unrelated conditions as metastatic carcinoma, and suggest that these phenomena are causally related.\r"

Concentrations of amosite, crocidolite, and tremolite fibers, and of typical asbestos bodies discriminated sharply between cases and referents. The distributions of chrysotile and anthophyllite/talc fibers and of all other natural and man-made inorganic fibers (greater than or equal to 8 microns) in the two series were quite similar. Relative risk was related to the concentration of long (greater than or equal to 8 microns) amphibole fibers with no additional information provided by shorter fibers. The proportion of long fibers was much higher for amphiboles than chrysotile and, except for chrysotile, systematically higher in cases than referents. Amphibole asbestos fibers could explain most mesothelioma cases in Canada and other inorganic fibers, including chrysotile, very few. Fibrous tremolite, contaminant of many industrial minerals including chrysotile, probably explained most cases in the Quebec mining region and perhaps 20% elsewhere.\r"

FCM DNA assays were carried out on the formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumor tissue. Seventy-nine (85%) of the tumors were aneuploid and 14 were diploid. There was no significant difference in survival between patients with diploid and aneuploid tumors. The DNA index, proliferation fraction, and fraction of aneuploid cells also had no effect on survival. However, patients with tumors smaller than 3 cm in diameter had a significantly better prognosis than those with larger tumors. Thus, in Stage I adenocarcinoma of lung, tumor size but not cellular DNA content distinguishes subgroups with favorable versus unfavorable prognosis.\r"

A case of surgically resected intraductal variant of peripheral cholangiocarcinoma of the liver in a 46-year-old Korean man who had eaten raw fresh-water fish is described. The tumors were entirely confined within the dilated peripheral tributaries of the left intrahepatic bile duct, and no tumorous extension beyond the bile duct walls into the hepatic parenchyma or to the hilum was found. Microscopically, the tumor was a well-differentiated papillary adenocarcinoma of large duct origin, and the major branches were plugged with multiple tumor casts. A histologic feature of a C. sinensis infection with fully developed adenomatous hyperplasia was associated in the peripheral septal ducts, and the nonneoplastic large duct showed focal epithelial dysplasia. The authors assume that intraductal cholangiocarcinoma is a distinct macroscopic subtype, and that a C. sinensis infection may also be responsible for its development.\r"

The mucosal ODC activity was significantly higher in 17 multiple tumor cases bearing adenocarcinoma(s) plus adenoma(s) than in 31 solitary tumor cases bearing one adenocarcinoma alone. It was higher in the mucosa of the two groups of cases than in the mucosa of individuals without large bowel cancer. Furthermore, the enzyme activity in left-sided cancer cases was significantly higher than that in right-sided cancer cases. Carcinoma tissue showed a remarkable high level of enzyme activity, compared with the normal mucosa. The results indicate the larger the number of tumors the higher the level of the ODC activity in the normal mucosa, particularly in left-sided cancer cases. It is concluded that the mucosal ODC may provide a good biological marker to detect individuals at higher risk for large bowel cancer due to exogenous or endogenous factors, and thus contribute to the prevention of mortality from large bowel cancer.\r"

A significant correlation (r = 0.27, P less than 0.001) was found between the severity of dysplasia and the size of the polyps. Moreover, the ratio between goblet and columnar cells was also found to decrease (P less than 0.0001) with the severity of dysplasia. Independent of the mucin stain used (periodic acid-Schiff, alcian blue, and high-iron diamine stains), mucin reactive cells were found to be negatively correlated (-0.17 less than r less than -0.44, P less than 0.01) with severity of dysplasia, especially in the tubular adenomas. These findings suggest that evaluation of mucin stain, related to dysplasia, may contribute to the assessment of premalignant and early malignant changes in adenomas of the colon.\r"

Demonstrating interinstitutional consistency in FCM analysis of replicate specimens simulating clinical barbotage specimens, fixed to allow easy transportation and storage at room temperature was one specific objective. Simulated barbotage specimens were prepared by mixing cultured aneuploid bladder carcinoma cells with normal or mitogen-stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells in different ratios. The samples were fixed in 10% formalin for 30 minutes, stored in buffer, and enucleated with pepsin, pH 1.5, before staining with propidium iodide for FCM DNA analysis. Preservation in ethanol or other common DNA cytochemical reagents was found to be unsatisfactory. In contrast, the formalin-fixed samples showed excellent preservation of quantitative DNA fluorescence and coefficient of variation of histogram peaks for over 2 weeks. Exchange of eight fixed specimens among five network laboratories that analyzed them as \"unknowns\" showed good overall agreement on histogram data and interpretation, although some noteworthy interlaboratory differences were found. This technique could be used for self-assessment surveys of clinical laboratory performance in DNA FCM of bladder barbotage specimens.\r"

Thirty-six children with genitourinary rhabdomyosarcoma were treated at our institutions from 1957 to 1985. The primary site of tumor involved the bladder, prostate, or both in 15 patients, the paratesticular structures in 12, and female reproductive organs in nine. Although treatment modalities and philosophies of care varied over the past 27 years, the majority of patients were treated with a combination of surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy. The event-free survival for all patients is 74%. Patients with paratesticular tumors had the best prognosis (88% event-free survival). Regional nodal radiation therapy is not necessary in this favorable group if the retroperitoneal lymph node dissection is negative. Of 15 children with bladder/prostate tumors nine had initial conservative surgery. Of these nine six are long-term survivors, but only three patients have intact bladders. The girls with tumors of the reproductive organs had an event-free survival of 63%; all patients in this group had hysterectomies. Chemotherapy and radiotherapy have not substituted for radical surgical procedures in most children with bladder or prostate rhabdomyosarcomas. Innovative therapeutic approaches are necessary for this group of patients.\r"

Polyclonal hypergammaglobulinemia was present in 64% of patients. Histologically clear cells or convoluted cells were observed in 36% and 48% of the patients, respectively. Univariate analysis (log-rank test) for prognostic factors revealed age, appetite, presence of clear cells, or convoluted cells were important factors. However, multivariate analysis revealed that there were no independent factors for prognosis. The presence of clear cells and/or convoluted cells were histologic signs for poor prognosis; autopsy showed that patients with the clear cells with or without convoluted cells mostly died of active disease of AILD with two cases progressing to non-Hodgkin's lymphomas and those with convoluted cells alone died of lung infection. From these findings, AILD could be divided into three groups: AILD with (1) clear cells with or without convoluted cells, (2) convoluted cells alone, or (3) neither cells. The first two groups showed poor prognosis, and the last a favorable prognosis.\r"

All patients had been treated by breast-conserving surgery and radiotherapy, including supplemental radiation to the tumor bed. For 67 patients with predominantly lobular carcinomas, the actuarial overall 5-year survival was 100% and 77% for node-negative and node-positive patients, respectively. The actuarial probability of recurrence in the treated breast (13.5% at 5 years) appeared to be somewhat greater than that observed after treatment of invasive ductal cancers (8.8% at 5 years, P = 0.11). Of 12 mammary recurrences in patients with lobular carcinoma, four occurred at a considerable distance from the original primary and seven were multifocal, involving more than one quadrant in five patients. Of 47 patients with strictly in situ carcinomas, one patient whose axillary nodal status had not been determined subsequently developed distant metastases. Three additional patients developed mammary recurrence, two at the primary tumor site and one in another quadrant. The actuarial 5-year mammary recurrence and overall survival rates were 4% and 98%, respectively. For 27 patients with true medullary cancers, overall survival at 5 years was 90%. One localized mammary recurrence was observed at the site of the original primary. Actuarial mammary recurrence rate was 4% at 5 years. No relapse was observed in ten patients with colloid and one patient with adenoid cystic carcinoma. The authors conclude that, in addition to its well-established efficacy in the treatment of infiltrating ductal carcinomas, the combination of tumor excision and radiotherapy appears to provide adequate local control for other histologic types as well. However, patients with lobular cancer appear to be at somewhat greater risk of mammary failure, and recurrences in such patients tend to be multifocal and multicentric.\r"

  ".W": "The technology for patient intravenous self-administration of morphine has been successfully implemented in postoperative and other clinical settings and can be used with terminal patients who experience pain. The question of whether patients who use such instrumentation will be vulnerable to over-medication or development of addiction has not been addressed. This report reviews two competing theories that bear upon this question and tests their predictions about self-administration of morphine for pain relief using data obtained from patients in a bone marrow transplant unit. The first, Opponent Process Theory, predicts escalating drug use and the development of addictive behavior in patients who self-administer morphine. The second, Control Theory, predicts that patients will self-regulate pain effectively by administering morphine without developing problems of medication abuse or addiction. Patients self-administering morphine for 2 weeks were compared to controls who received the drug via routine staff-controlled continuous infusion procedures. Self-administering patients used significantly less morphine than controls and still achieved the same amount of pain control; moreover, they terminated drug use sooner than controls. The predictions based upon Opponent Process Theory were not supported in these marrow transplant patients, but Control Theory accounted well for the outcomes. These results support the assumption that self-administration of opioids in a medical setting does not put patients at risk for over-medication or addiction.\r"

  ".W": "Disturbances associated with a breast cancer diagnosis were defined when psychological assessments from 63 patients with a known breast cancer diagnosis were compared to those from 56 patients with an as yet undiagnosed malignancy. Subsequent assessments from the 56 patients with an undiagnosed breast cancer showed disturbances after they saw a physician compared with the assessments from 72 similar patients ultimately diagnosed as benign. Apprehension apparently arose from clues given before a biopsy was done even though the cancer was not yet diagnosed. Compared with the benign breast disease group, the disturbances in patients suspected or diagnosed with breast cancer were found chiefly in assessments of mood and adjustment, and less in assessments of more durable characteristics of personality, psychopathology, and sexual behavior. Psychological problems associated with breast cancer decreased over time, but residuals persisted for at least 16 months postoperatively. Few differences were found between 41 patients who elected breast-conserving surgery and 78 who were treated with mastectomy. Problems were not eliminated by operations which saved the breast.\r"

  ".W": "Left ventricular biplane cineangiography, micromanometry, and endomyocardial biopsies were performed in 27 patients with aortic stenosis (AS) and in 17 patients with aortic insufficiency (AI). Twenty-three patients with AS and 15 with AI were restudied at an intermediate time (18 months after successful valve replacement), and nine patients with AS and six with AI were restudied late (70 and 62 months after surgery). Biopsy samples were evaluated for muscle fiber diameter, percent interstitial fibrosis, and volume fraction of myofibrils. In control biopsy samples obtained from five donor hearts at transplantation, these morphometric variables averaged 21.2 microns, 7.0%, and 57.2%, respectively. After surgery, mass determined by cineangiography decreased from 186 to 115 and 94 g/m2 in patients with AS and from 201 to 131 and 93 g/m2 in patients with AI. At the three studies, muscle fiber diameter was 30.9, 28.0, and 28.7 microns in patients with AS and was 31.4, 27.6, and 26.4 microns in patients with AI. Percent interstitial fibrosis was 18.2, 25.8, and 13.7% in patients with AS and was 20.4, 23.7, and 19.2% in patients with AI. Left ventricular fibrous content decreased from 34.2 to 29.8 and to 12.7 g/m2 in patients with AS and from 42.1 to 28.9 and to 18.9 g/m2 in patients with AI. Volume fraction of myofibrils was 57.7, 56.8, and 49.0% in patients with AS and was 56.8, 56.6 and 48.8% in patients with AI. Thus, the decrease of muscle mass determined by cineangiography at the intermediate time after valve replacement is mediated by regression of myocardial cellular hypertrophy in patients with AS and AI and in addition by a decrease of fibrous content in patients with AI. Late after surgery, left ventricular fibrous content also decreases in patients with AS. This late decrease associated with minor changes of end-diastolic volume may be important for improvement of increased diastolic myocardial stiffness. Even 6-7 years after valve replacement, incomplete regression of structural abnormalities of left ventricular hypertrophy still exists compared with the normal myocardium. The residually increased relative interstitial fibrosis and the small late postoperative decrease of volume fraction of myofibrils, associated with a prosthesis-related slight left ventricular pressure increase, are at the origin of a persistent systolic overload at the myofibrillar level.\r"

The percentage occurring OH/ER declined with age, was higher in men than women, and higher in blacks than whites. At age 55-64, 61% of ischemic heart disease deaths in white and 66% in black men occurred OH/ER. Between 1980 and 1985, age-adjusted death rates in white men aged 35-74 years declined 19% for OH/ER and 18% for in-hospital ischemic heart disease deaths. The percentage of deaths in ER increased. The decline in deaths occurring OH/ER accounted for 61% of the total absolute decline in ischemic heart disease death rate in white men, 55% in white women, and about 70% in nonwhites. The decline in rates of death OH/ER should encourage further efforts at preventing coronary heart disease and improving emergency medical services.\r"

  ".W": "To assess the impact of operative reduction of left ventricular outflow obstruction in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, measurements of great cardiac vein flow, oxygen and lactate content, left ventricular pressures, and cardiac index were measured at rest and during pacing stress in 20 consecutive patients (13, myotomy-myectomy; six, mitral valve replacement; one, both myotomy-myectomy and mitral valve replacement) who underwent both preoperative and postoperative studies. All had angiographically normal epicardial coronary arteries. Operation resulted in reduction in outflow gradient (64 +/- 38 to 4 +/- 7 mm Hg, p less than 0.001) and in left ventricular systolic pressure (186 +/- 32 to 128 +/- 22 mm Hg, p less than 0.001) and was associated with reduction in great cardiac vein flow (101 +/- 26 to 78 +/- 16 ml/min, p less than 0.001) and oxygen consumption in the anterior left ventricle and septum (11.9 +/- 4.1 to 8.4 +/- 1.9 ml O2/min, p less than 0.001) in the basal state. During rapid atrial pacing, 13 of 20 patients experienced chest pain postoperatively, whereas all 20 developed chest pain during preoperative pacing, with an improvement in pacing anginal threshold (or heart rate 150 if no chest pain was experienced) of 16 +/- 18 beats/min (p less than 0.001). The peak great cardiac vein flow (161 +/- 41 to 131 +/- 45 ml/min, p less than 0.025) and myocardial oxygen consumption (19.4 +/- 6.1 to 14.3 +/- 5.5 ml O2/min, p less than 0.005) during pacing, which correlated directly with the severity of the basal left ventricular gradient (p = 0.011 and p = 0.002, respectively), were also reduced by surgery. Lactate metabolism during pacing changed from net production before surgery to net consumption after operation (-17 +/- 47.6 to 4.4 +/- 29.8 mumol/min, p less than 0.01), with six of 20 patients producing lactate after surgery compared with 13 of 20 before surgery (p = 0.06). The six patients with the highest peak great cardiac vein flow (greater than 175 ml/min) during preoperative pacing had greater symptom and metabolic benefit during pacing after surgery compared with the 14 patients with lower peak coronary flow. Postpacing left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (30 +/- 7 to 23 +/- 7 mm Hg, p less than 0.001) and pulmonary artery wedge pressure (24 +/- 6 to 20 +/- 5, p less than 0.001) were reduced after surgery.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

The infusion rates of epinephrine used in this study were 25 and 50 ng/kg/min, which previously have been demonstrated to result in plasma epinephrine concentrations in the range that occurs during a variety of stresses in humans. The subjects of this study were 17 patients with recurrent PSVT who underwent an electrophysiologic study in the control state and after at least 2 days of treatment with 240-480 mg/day verapamil. After assessing the response to verapamil, epinephrine was infused and testing was repeated. Verapamil significantly slowed atrioventricular conduction and prolonged refractoriness in the atrium and atrioventricular node. The effects of the two infusion rates of epinephrine were generally similar in magnitude and, therefore, the results were pooled. Epinephrine partially or completely reversed all of verapamil's electrophysiologic effects. Verapamil suppressed the induction of sustained PSVT in 15 patients. Epinephrine facilitated the induction of PSVT in seven of these 15 patients. All 15 patients were treated on a long-term basis with verapamil. The eight patients in whom epinephrine did not facilitate the induction of PSVT had no recurrences of PSVT during 9-18 months of follow-up.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The effect of preexistent coronary collateral perfusion on the prevention of left ventricular aneurysm formation was examined in 47 patients undergoing an intracoronary thrombolysis within 6 hours after the onset of a first acute anterior myocardial infarction. Left ventricular aneurysm formation and wall motion were analyzed with cineventriculography. A left ventricular aneurysm was determined as well-defined demarcation of the infarcted segment from normally contracting myocardium. In 25 patients with successful thrombolysis (group A), a left ventricular aneurysm was observed in one patient (4%) during the chronic stage of infarction. In 10 patients who had a significant collateral circulation to the infarct-related coronary artery and unsuccessful reperfusion (group B), the left ventricular aneurysm was observed in only one patient (10%). In the remaining 12 patients with unsuccessful recanalization in the absence of a significant collateral perfusion (group C), there was a higher incidence (seven of 12, 58%) of left ventricular aneurysm formation than in groups A and B (p less than 0.05). In group A, both the global ejection fraction and regional wall motion in the infarct areas improved significantly (p less than 0.05) between the acute and chronic stages of infarction. By contrast, in groups B and C, these indexes on the ventricular function did not change significantly during the convalescent period. Thus, although the collateral perfusion existing at the onset of acute myocardial infarction may not improve ventricular function, it exerts a beneficial effect on the prevention of left ventricular aneurysm formation.\r"

  ".W": "Vasodilation occurs in the nonexercising forearm at the beginning of isometric handgrip despite activation of sympathetic vasoconstrictor reflexes. The mechanism of this response remains unclear. In 33 normal humans, age 24 +/- 1 years (mean +/- SEM), we measured mean arterial pressure, heart rate, and forearm blood flow (plethysmography) in the nonexercising arm during sustained contralateral isometric handgrip at 30% maximal voluntary contraction. Sympathetic nerve activity to calf muscles (microneurography) was also measured in 15 subjects. Handgrip resulted in increases in arterial pressure from 86 +/- 2 to 97 +/- 3 mm Hg (p less than 0.05). Despite increases in nerve activity to calf muscles from 229 +/- 43 to 337 +/- 66 units (p less than 0.005), which would be expected to produce forearm vasoconstriction, forearm vascular resistance in the contralateral resting arm decreased from 20 +/- 3 to 18 +/- 2 units (p less than 0.05). To determine the mechanism of this vasodilatory influence, additional studies were performed with regional autonomic blockade with intra-arterial administration of atropine (0.8 mg, 10 subjects) or propranolol (2.0 mg, eight subjects) into the nonexercising forearm before contraction. Propranolol and vehicle had no effect on forearm vascular responses in the resting arm during SHG in the other arm. In contrast, atropine blocked the vasodilatory response in the resting arm during contraction (delta forearm vascular resistance during contraction, control = -2.1 +/- 0.6 units; postatropine = +0.2 +/- 0.9 units, p less than 0.05). Atropine did not attenuate the vasodilator response to isoproterenol or the vasoconstrictor response to norepinephrine. We conclude 1) a dissociation exists between sympathetic neural and forearm vascular responses to isometric exercise; 2) the vasodilatory response in the nonexercising forearm is not due to sympathetic withdrawal or beta 2-adrenergic-mediated vasodilation; and 3) this response is mediated primarily by cholinergic mechanisms. These studies provide the first direct evidence for active, cholinergically mediated vasodilation during exercise in humans.\r"

Cardiac extraction of norepinephrine averaged 59 +/- 17% in the patients with HCM, significantly less than in the control subjects (79 +/- 13%, p less than 0.05), whereas cardiac extraction of isoproterenol was similar in the two groups (13 +/- 23% versus 13 +/- 14%), indicating that neuronal uptake of norepinephrine was decreased in the patients with HCM.

Apexcardiograms, phonocardiograms, electrocardiograms, two-dimensional and dual M-mode echocardiograms, and radionuclide ventriculograms (RNV) were performed. There were no differences in the timing of right ventricular events between LBBB and normal subjects; however, striking delays in left ventricular systolic and diastolic events were apparent in the LBBB group. The delay was associated with shortening of left ventricular diastole and resultant increase in the ratio of right to left ventricular diastolic time in LBBB (1.2 +/- 0.08) compared with normal (1.0 +/- 0.06), p less than 0.0001. First heart sound (S1) amplitude, expressed as the ratio S1/S2, was decreased in LBBB compared with normal (0.67 +/- 0.2 compared with 1.34 +/- 0.25, p less than 0.01), in part due to wide separation of the valvular contributors to S1. The abnormal interventricular septal motion in LBBB corresponded to periods of asynchrony in contraction, ejection, end systole, and end diastole between right and left ventricles. Radionuclide ventriculograms revealed decreased regional ejection fraction of the septum in LBBB (40 +/- 16%) compared with 67 +/- 7% in normal subjects (p less than 0.001), while the apical and lateral regional ejection fractions were similar in the two groups.

Impedance and wave reflections were calculated from standard Fourier series analysis of ascending aorta micromanometer pressure and electromagnetic flow records. Compliance was estimated by a method recently proposed that uses the area under the pressure-time curve assuming a two-element Windkessel model of the circulation. Measurements were made in the baseline state, during vasodilatation with nitroprusside, after beta-adrenergic receptor blockade with intravenous propranolol, and during vasodilatation after beta-blockade. Marfan's syndrome produces alterations from normal in some hemodynamic variables: during baseline conditions, the magnitude of wave reflection was higher than in normal patients. This was normalized by vasodilatation and further increased by beta-blockade. Despite the greatly dilated aortic root, the aortic characteristic impedance was in the normal range, suggesting increased aortic wall stiffness. The baseline total arterial compliance was greatly increased with nitroprusside and was reduced by beta-blockade. beta-Blockade did not decrease the maximum acceleration of blood into the ascending aorta. These are the first detailed measurements of hemodynamic indexes in this disease. The results suggest that acute beta-blockade is not necessarily beneficial in reducing hemodynamic loading on an already dilated aortic root.\r"

In the patients with chronic pulmonary disease, symptom-limited, incremental supine bicycle exercise and pulse oximetry were performed on and off high-flow oxygen. Technically adequate Doppler studies were initially obtained in 20 patients (56%) at rest and 14 (39%) on exercise; these numbers increased to 33 (92%) and 32 (89%), respectively, after enhancement with agitated saline (both p less than 0.001). In 10 patients with chronic lung disease who had simultaneous hemodynamic monitoring during exercise, the correlation between Doppler and catheter measurements of pulmonary artery systolic pressure was close (r = 0.98). Among controls, RVSP increased from 22 +/- 4 at rest (mean +/- SD) to 31 +/- 7 mm Hg at peak exercise. In patients with chronic lung disease, RVSP increased from 46 +/- 20 to 83 +/- 30 mm Hg (both p less than 0.001 vs. controls). Despite normal resting values for RVSP in 28% of study patients, nearly all showed abnormal increases in RVSP during supine bicycle exercise. Increases in RVSP during exercise were greatest in patients who showed oxyhemoglobin desaturation. The short-term administration of oxygen significantly blunted the increase in RVSP during exercise. Saline contrast-enhanced Doppler evaluation of tricuspid insufficiency seems a potentially valuable noninvasive method of determining the exercise response of RVSP in patients with chronic pulmonary disease.\r"

In six dogs with LV pump failure, there was a progressive decline in circumferential fiber shortening (29 +/- 4% at 12 months); this was significantly less than that seen in five littermate controls (38 +/- 3%, p less than 0.05). The average LV to body weight ratio in this group was 9.8 +/- 2.7 g/kg. In 10 dogs without pump failure (compensated LVH group), shortening exceeded that seen in the controls (43 +/- 4%, p less than 0.05); the LV to body weight ratio was 7.7 +/- 1.0 g/kg. At 12 months (cardiac catheterization), the LV end-diastolic pressure was higher in the failure (25 +/- 15 mm Hg) than in the compensated group (8 +/- 5 mm Hg, p less than 0.05); mean systolic stress was also higher in the failure group (313 +/- 67 g/cm2) than in the compensated group (202 +/- 53 g/cm2, p less than 0.05). The transmural distribution of myocardial blood flow was measured (at 12 months) with the radioactive microsphere technique; flow data were then related to an index of demand (a stress-time index). There was preferential blood flow to the subendocardial layers in the control (endo/epi = 1.28) and compensated hearts (endo/epi = 1.10), but in the failure group there was a relative decrease in subendocardial flow (endo/epi = 0.92). However, the absolute values for subendocardial flow in the normal, compensated, and failure groups were 77 +/- 54, 125 +/- 48, and 113 +/- 64 ml/min/100 g; the stress-time indexes in the subendocardial shell were 38 +/- 11, 74 +/- 19, and 93 +/- 34 g sec.10(2)/cm2/min. Despite what appears to be a marginal balance between blood flow and the stress time index in the failure group, the myocardial high energy phosphates were not depleted and the inoptropic state was not depressed. In this model of LV hypertrophy, the observed differences in fiber shortening can be explained on the basis of the inverse afterload-shortening relation; pump failure was due to an inadequate LV hypertrophy with afterload excess.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

Awake mongrel dogs chronically instrumented with proximal circumflex coronary occluders were subjected to permanent occlusion (group A, n = 10) or occlusion followed by reperfusion 2 hours later (group B, n = 11). Myocardial blood flow was quantified with radioactive microsphere injections before, 6 hours after occlusion (group A), immediately before release, and 4 hours after reperfusion (group B). Three days later, the dogs were killed, and the heart was sectioned systematically into approximately 80 1-2-g circumferential and transmural samples for radioactive counting and histologic infarct quantification. Epimyocardial and endomyocardial samples from the permanent occlusion group (A) and the reperfused group (B) were separated by infarct range and related to regional myocardial blood flow measurements. In groups A and B, regional myocardial blood flow in endomyocardial and epimyocardial layers were inversely related to the extent of infarction. For given degrees of infarction, myocardial blood flow was significantly higher (greater than twofold) in the reperfused group. Myocardial samples with extensive infarction (51-75%) showed only mild (20-30%) reductions in blood flow when compared with nonischemic regions in the reperfused group. Thus, although early reperfusion may salvage ischemic myocardium, these studies showed that reperfusion causes a new relation between blood flow to the ischemic region and eventual histologic infarct size. When myocardial blood flow is used as an index of myocardial salvage after reperfusion, the basic relation obtained from permanent occlusion studies substantially overestimates the extent of myocardial salvage and underestimates the degree of remaining infarction.\r"

Domestic swine (n = 10) were instrumented with a coronary arterial stenosis that reduced vessel diameter 80%. Measurements of hemodynamic indexes were made 1) before stenosis, 2) at 5, 20, and 60 minutes after stenosis placement, and 3) after each of three, 20-minute NaOH infusions (0.05 M, 0.1 M, and 0.5 M) distal to the stenosis (group 1). Intracellular pH at the end of 30 minutes of 0.5 M NaOH infusion distal to the stenosis was measured in a second group (n = 6) of swine (group 2). After stenosis placement in group 1, endocardial blood flow declined significantly, and evidence of regional acidosis (increased coronary venous Pco2 and decreased coronary venous pH) and ischemia (lactate production) developed. One hour later, evidence of acidosis persisted, though to a lesser extent. Myocardial oxygen and lactate metabolism exhibited similar patterns. Infusion of 0.5 M NaOH (0.38 ml/min) reduced (p less than 0.01) distal zone epicardial blood flow but did not change endocardial flow. Regional myocardial oxygen extraction (75 +/- 8%, mean +/- SD) and consumption (8.2 +/- 2.3 ml/min/100 g) also declined significantly (p less than 0.01) in response to 0.5 M NaOH infusion compared with 60 minutes after stenosis (86 +/- 4 and 12.4 +/- 2.8 ml/min/100 g respectively).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The beta-adrenergic and calcium channel blocking agents are known to reduce heart rate and alter myocardial contractility. More recent evidence suggests that both agents affect the metabolic consequences of ischemia, independent of their effects on heart rate and contractility. We used a low-flow model of ischemia in swine with heart rate held constant by atrial pacing. Blood was shunted from the carotid artery to the left anterior descending coronary artery through a controlled-flow roller pump to assess the threshold flow for the rise in extracellular potassium ([K+]e) and fall in extracellular pH (pHe) associated with ischemia during control situations and after the administration of either propranolol or verapamil. We also measured the changes in activation delay and contractility associated with graded flow reductions in the presence and absence of these drugs. We found that when heart rate is held constant, 1) verapamil shifts the threshold flow for [K+]e and pHe to lower levels, but propranolol does not; 2) verapamil lessens activation delay, while propranolol aggravates the delay; and 3) verapamil reduces afterload and selectively depresses contractility in the reperfused ischemic zone. We conclude that the calcium channel blockers and the beta-adrenergic-blocking agents have different effects and possibly different modes of action and should not be considered interchangeable when evaluating therapeutic options for patients with ischemic heart disease.\r"

  ".W": "The electrophysiologic effects of amiodarone were examined in 13 dogs that received 30 g amiodarone orally during 3 weeks and compared with 13 control dogs that did not receive amiodarone. Longitudinal and transverse epicardial conduction velocities were estimated with a square array of 64 closely spaced electrodes and a computer-assisted acquisition and analysis system. Amiodarone caused a rate-dependent decrease in conduction velocity with a slightly greater effect in the longitudinal direction of propagation. Rate-related depression of conduction velocity developed rapidly after abrupt shortening of the pacing cycle length; 67% of the change occurred between the first two beats of the rapid train, and little change occurred after the 10th beat. Recovery from use-dependent depression of conduction velocity was exponential with a mean time constant of 447 +/- 172 msec in the longitudinal direction and 452 +/- 265 msec in the transverse direction. Repolarization intervals, defined as the interval between the activation time and the repolarization time in the unipolar electrograms, correlated highly with refractory period determinations in the absence and presence of amiodarone at each cycle length tested. The increase in repolarization intervals and refractory periods resulting from amiodarone treatment did not vary with cycle length. Amiodarone treatment also resulted in a significant rate-related reduction in systolic blood pressure. The systolic blood pressure in the group that received amiodarone decreased by a mean of 50 +/- 23% between steady-state pacing cycle lengths of 1,000 and 200 msec, whereas the corresponding decrease in the control group was 21 +/- 32% (p less than 0.05). Plasma and myocardial amiodarone and desethylamiodarone levels were comparable to those observed clinically. We conclude that long-term amiodarone administration causes rate-dependent reductions in conduction velocity and blood pressure and causes rate-independent increases in repolarization intervals.\r"

Subtle histological changes in the alignment of collagen bundles and subsequent ossification reflected the mechanical configuration of each fixator. The multiplanar, full-pin Ilizarov system delivered concentric load to the site of osteogenesis, inducing perfectly parallel columns of new bone. The uniplanar, one-half pin Wagner system induced angulation of the collagen and subsequent bone columns on the basis of eccentric load to the osteogenic interface. Despite a significant difference in axial rigidity, the Ilizarov and Wagner external fixators induced osteogenesis of equal volume.\r"

  ".W": "Twenty-five patients aged 19-62 years were treated for tibial nonunions (22 atrophic, three hypertrophic) with bone loss (1-23 cm, mean 6.2 cm) by the Ilizarov technique and fixator. Thirteen had chronic osteomyelitis, 19 had a limb-length discrepancy (2-11 cm), 12 had a bony defect (1-16 cm), and 13 had a deformity. Six had a bone defect with no shortening, 13 had shortening with no defect, and six had both a bone defect and shortening. Nonunion, bone defects, limb shortening, and deformity can all be addressed simultaneously with the Ilizarov apparatus. Bone defects were closed from within without bone grafts by the Ilizarov bone transport technique of sliding a bone fragment internally, producing distraction osteogenesis behind it until the defect is bridged (internal lengthening). Length was reestablished by distraction of a percutaneous corticotomy or through compression and subsequent distraction of the pseudarthrosis site (external lengthening). Distraction osteogenesis resulting from both processes obviated the need for a bone graft in every case. Deformity was corrected by means of hinges on the apparatus. Infection was treated by radical resection of the necrotic bone and internal lengthening to regenerate the excised bone. Union was achieved in all cases. The mean time to union was 13.6 months, but it was only 10.6 months if the time taken for unsuccessful compression-distraction of the nonunion is eliminated from the calculation. The bone results were excellent in 18 cases, good in five, and fair in two based on union in all cases, persistent infection in three, deformity in four, and limb shortening in one. The functional results were excellent in 16 cases, good in seven, fair in one, and poor in one based on return to work and daily activities in all cases, limp in four cases, equinus deformity in five cases, dystrophy in four cases, pain in four cases, and voluntary amputation for neurogenic pain in one case.\r"

A group of 250 patients with rheumatoid arthritis were investigated to evaluate the neurologic status with respect to the degree of instability in the proximal cervical spine. Neurologic isolated signs such as hyperreflexia could not be correlated with the onset of cervical myelopathy or quadraparesis or to the radiographically measured degree of atlantoaxial instability.

These measurements are taken from roentgenograms during the early stage of the disease. Under these criteria, primary osteoarthritis accounted for only 0.65% of 2000 consecutive cases of osteoarthritis. Observation of the natural course of primary osteoarthritis revealed two subtypes.

Temperatures in excess of 50 degrees for a duration of more than one minute were found within approximately 2 mm from the periphery of the reamer. This finding implies that the thread of the screw will be placed in an osteonecrotic zone.\r"

Each patient had a \"catch\" or \"clunk\" associated with pain on extension of the knee. At revision, a prominent fibrous nodule was found at the junction of the proximal patellar pole and the quadriceps tendon. The pathogenesis of this proximal fibrous nodule may involve impingement of the anterosuperior edge of the intercondylar notch area of the femoral component into the proximal quadriceps tendon or may involve impingement of the patellar prosthesis itself on the quadriceps tendon. Roentgenographic examination revealed an abnormally proximal placement of the patellar prosthesis on the patella. Surgical removal of the fibrous nodule resolved the symptoms. Revision of the patellar prosthesis may be necessary.\r"

At an average follow-up period of three years, no evidence of persistent or recurrent infection was noted. Roentgenograms showed no evidence of joint or epiphyseal destruction. Because of the low morbidity associated with the procedure, rapid restoration of joint motion and patient mobility was seen in all patients. Arthroscopic debridement of acute septic knees may be carried out in pediatric patients, given appropriate equipment and arthroscopic skills.\r"

A prospective study was designed to evaluate the use of the Orthofix Dynamic Axial Fixator (DAF) for the short- and long-term treatment of open tibial fractures. Forty-four patients with 45 open tibial fractures were enrolled in the study, which included a one-year follow-up period. Eighty-nine percent of the fractures were classified as Gustilo and Anderson's Type III. All fractures except one were united in a mean healing time of 22.6 weeks. The dynamization of the Orthofix in nonsegmental fractures occurred at an average of 8.1 weeks. Segmental fractures received a two-stage dynamization. The first stage consisted of removing the supplementary pins, once callus formation was seen at one of the fractures lines, plus the addition of a bone graft. This stage occurred at an average of 8.8 weeks. The second stage consisted of unlocking the telescoping rods and allowing dynamic axial loading of the consolidating graft. This stage occurred at an average of 19.0 weeks. The implementation of this one-plane unilateral frame, which is capable of converting from a rigid to a dynamic fixator, combined with a bone graft in 58% of the patients, contributed to a 98% success rate. Proper timing of dynamization is emphasized to avoid angulation, nonunion, or delayed union.\r"

In children almost all fixations were done with Kirschner wires. The adult fractures were stabilized according to the recommendations of the AO/ASIF, i.e., monocondylar fractures by screws and/or single-plate fixation and bicondylar fractures by screws and dual-plate fixation, preferably with reconstruction plates. Comminuted fractures required an additional osteotomy of the olecranon. Except for children, the essential feature of postoperative management was early functional treatment by continuous passive motion. Eighty-eight patients (84.6%) were followed with an average follow-up time of 4.4 years. The results were evaluated for range of motion, pain, working capacity, neural and vascular impairment, valgus/varus deformity, and subjective judgment. The long-term outcome of almost 81% good and very good results suggests that operative treatment can be valuable when indications, anatomic surgical reconstruction, and postoperative care are performed correctly.\r"

This study investigates the anatomical pathway through which rapid cell spread could occur. Radioactively labeled 15-mu microspheres were injected into the medullary canal of rat femurs. The ratio of injected particles found in the femur was compared among groups that received application of a tourniquet prior to injection, no tourniquet, or transection of all soft tissue proximal to the injection site. Obliteration of circulation in the soft tissue surrounding the femur with a tourniquet or tissue transection did not alter the spread of particles from the femur. The pulmonary circulation trapped approximately 95% of particles reaching the lungs, limiting their access to peripheral arterial circulation. If the number of particles injected into the femur was increased, the number of particles leaving the femur increased at an even greater rate. These data suggest that (1) a particle can exit the femur without traveling through the soft tissue surrounding the femur; (2) most particles that reach the lung are retained; and (3) the injected bone acts as a sponge, retaining some particles and permitting the rest to enter the venous drainage.\r"

Untreated joints showed a marked increase in both total soluble glycosaminoglycan (GAG measured as uronic acid) and in the associative fraction. In both treated groups, there was a reduced amount of soluble GAG. Cessation of treatment after seven weeks caused gradual regression, with an increasing amount of CaCl2-soluble material in the associative fraction, while inception at seven weeks gave biochemical evidence of reversal, with increasing GAG present in the guanidine-soluble (dissociative) fraction on the insoluble residue. The protective effects of hyaluronic acid suggest the potential clinical application of this therapy in retarding the advance of osteoarthritis.\r"

Seven weeks after surgery, the damage, graded according to Mankin's scale, was significantly reduced in knee joints treated with HA from the second week postsurgery compared to untreated joints. When intraarticular HA therapy was initiated after the seventh week, osteoarthritis progression was still reduced compared to controls. Both morphology and morphometry showed a beneficial effect of HA on the cartilage response to the damage, as well as a clearcut inhibitory effect on the development of the fibroblastlike cell layer on the articular cartilage in untreated joints. The beneficial effects on the cartilage integrity and response to osteoarthritic damage might be related to a primary effect of HA on the cartilage surface. However, these effects do not exclude the possibility that, in addition, HA might act on the synovial membrane by limiting the synovial reaction.\r"

In the present studies, the influence of applying a very short period of axial micromovement with defined characteristics to healing fractures has been studied both in simulated and clinical tibial fractures. The fracture healing process is seen to be acutely sensitive to small periods of daily strain applied axially within two weeks of fracture. There are boundaries of strain magnitude and force of application of applied movement that, if exceeded, inhibit the healing process. The application of appropriate applied strain to clinical tibial fractures at a time shortly after injury, when most patients would be very inactive, appears to enhance the healing process when using external skeletal fixation.\r"

Indications included open fractures with soft-tissue injury (13 patients), comminuted shaft fractures (six patients), and unstable operative candidates (five patients). In 14 patients, external fixation was a temporary method (Group I), while in ten patients it was the definitive method of stabilization (Group II). Twenty-one patients achieved solid union, two developed a delayed union, and one had a nonunion. Three patients developed pin-tract infections, and one developed osteomyelitis after intramedullary fixation in Group I. Two patients in Group II developed shortening (2.1 cm and 3.2 cm). Loss of motion occurred in 11 patients, averaging 56 degrees. It is suggested that external fixation be considered in the following types of femoral fractures: open fractures for aggressive management of soft-tissue injuries; closed fractures in severely traumatized, burn, or head injury patients; fractures about the knee resulting in floating knees; and infected femoral nonunions and pseudarthroses.\r"

Three pin-tract infections occurred. In two patients, a 10 degrees anteroposterior angulation occurred after external fixation removal. One patient healed with a 25 degrees external rotation deformity. At final follow-up evaluation, all tibial shaft fractures had healed. Knee and ankle ranges of motion were affected by ipsilateral femoral shaft fracture, knee injury, or ankle and foot trauma but not by the type of fixation. Both methods yielded excellent results, but the rate and extent of complications were lower with external fixation. Therefore, external fixation using the one-half pin technique should be regarded as a primary method of stabilization for Grades II and III open tibial shaft fractures.\r"

The data were compared with the results of eight conventional one-half frame fixators previously tested in the same manner. The Ilizarov fixator allowed significantly more axial motion at the fracture site during axial compression than the other fixators tested. The overall stiffness and shear rigidity of the Ilizarov external fixator were similar to those of the one-half pin fixators in bending and torsion. The stability of the Ilizarov fixator was a function of bone position within the fixator rings and fixation wire tension. The use of olive stop wires increased the shear resistance of the Ilizarov system.\r"

The pulsatile nature of luteinizing hormone (LH) secretion has recognized physiological and clinical importance, but because of the difficulties with statistical analysis of serial data the precise nature of this pulsed signal is poorly understood. Several groups have noted small-amplitude, high-frequency pulses superimposed on large slower pulses, but, using conventional methods of analysis, it is not possible to distinguish these from assay variation or to characterize them. 2. In an alternative approach we have applied the methods of time series analysis which identify the harmonic patterns within data. Twenty-four healthy women in the early follicular phase of the cycle had blood samples taken at intervals of 1, 5 or 10 min for up to 6 h. 3. We found that LH secretion consists of superimposed harmonics of varying amplitude which occur in frequency bands of about (a) 1-3 h and (b) 2-3 min. Investigations excluded a reproducible pulsatility in our LH assay, implying that the small fast pulses are physiological events. 4. We conclude that LH release is highly complex and that the methods of time series analysis permit identification and characterization of the multiple pulses.\r"

A portion of the recaptured noradrenaline is deaminated to form dihydroxyphenylglycol. The present report describes a technique using plasma dihydroxyphenylglycol for estimation of the rate of neuronal reuptake of endogenous noradrenaline in vivo. 2. Neuronal re-uptake of noradrenaline in the sympathetic nervous system of the rat was estimated from the effects of neuronal uptake blockade with desipramine on three variables: (i) the plasma clearance of intravenously infused 3H-labelled noradrenaline, (ii) the plasma concentration of endogenous dihydroxyphenylglycol, and (iii) the plasma concentration of 3H-labelled dihydroxyphenylglycol formed from infused 3H-labelled noradrenaline. 3. Desipramine decreased plasma dihydroxyphenylglycol by 36%, this representing the fraction of dihydroxyphenylglycol in plasma that was derived from recaptured noradrenaline. After desipramine, the decrease in the rate of neuronal uptake of 3H-labelled noradrenaline was 9.7 times that of the decrease in the plasma spillover of 3H-labelled dihydroxyphenylglycol. Since the appearances in plasma of dihydroxyphenylglycol from unlabelled and 3H-labelled noradrenaline were similar, the neuronal re-uptake of endogenous noradrenaline could be assumed to be 9.7 times as much as the plasma spillover of dihydroxyphenylglycol that was derived from recaptured noradrenaline (0.15 nmol min-1 kg-1). 4. The rate of neuronal re-uptake of endogenous noradrenaline was estimated to be 1.45 nmol min-1 kg-1, whereas the plasma spillover of noradrenaline was 0.127 nmol min-1 kg-1. Thus, only a small fraction (less than 9%) of the noradrenaline released into the synaptic cleft spills over into the circulation.\r"

This necessitates a separation procedure which is time-consuming and may modify the function of the cells. Interaction between different cell types is precluded. 2. To avoid these disadvantages a method was developed which quantifies granulocyte aggregation in whole blood. Samples drawn from an incubated vessel before and after the addition of a chemotactic stimulus were fixed with formaldehyde to prevent disaggregation. Erythrocytes were then removed by chemical lysis and using an electronic cell-sizing device the number of single cells and aggregates could then be easily measured. 3. Results from a group of volunteers showed a rapid and reversible response to a chemotactic tripeptide, with a fall in single granulocyte count and the appearance of doublets and triplets. Lymphocytes were unaffected. Intra-assay reproducibility was better than +/- 5%. 4. Using this assay, a significant elevation in aggregability was observed in blood from patients after acute myocardial infarction. 5. This novel technique, by avoiding the separation step, is faster, simpler and more physiological than previous methods, and as such is useful for both assays of drug action in vitro and the study of cell activation in disease states.\r"

Renal clearance and duct transport measurements were made before and after KCl infusion in three groups of animals: normal rats on a regular K+ diet (group I), and sham-operated (II) or adrenalectomized rats (group III), both on a low K+ diet. 2. Only the sham-operated animals on the low K+ diet became hypokalaemic. They also had the lowest rate of K+ excretion at the time of study. Adrenalectomized rats were normokalaemic, and had an intermediate rate of K+ excretion. After the acute KCl infusion, kaliuresis remained significantly depressed in the rats which were previously hypokalaemic. In contrast, K+ excretion rates in response to K+ infusion were high and not significantly different in both previously normokalaemic groups, independent of the presence of the adrenal glands. 3. In the medullary collecting duct, before the KCl infusion there was no net K+ transport in either normokalaemic group (I and III). However, after the KCl infusion there was significant K+ secretion in both of these groups (32% and 22% of total urinary excretion, respectively). In contrast, the sham-operated hypokalaemic rats on the low K+ diet had a small absolute, but large fractional K+ reabsorption (64% of delivered load) in the medullary collecting duct. With KCl infusion in this group, K+ delivery to the medullary duct increased, but absolute reabsorption along the duct was maintained, resulting in a fractional reabsorption of 28% of delivery.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Lyso-PAF was acetylated in vitro to PAF which was measured by bioassay using 5-[14C]hydroxytryptamine-labelled rabbit platelets. 2. Under 40 years there were similar direct relations between plasma lyso-PAF and age in both sexes (linear regression; males, P less than 0.001; females, P less than 0.002), the level approximately doubling from the adolescent level around 100 ng/ml. However, in the later years the levels fell, the fall seeming to commence earlier in females, so that between 40 and 65 years the level was greater in males [169 +/- 47 (SD) vs 120 +/- 30 ng/ml; P less than 0.01]. 3. The increase in plasma lyso-PAF up to middle-age may be related to the reported increase in prostanoid production with age, since these platelet and vasoactive compounds can have a common origin in membrane phospholipid. This would be consistent with increasing phospholipase A2 activity and decreasing stability of cell membranes with age, but the later fall in lyso-PAF is then unexplained; the lesser values in females than males in the more advanced years could be related to females' generally lesser vascular disease. However, knowledge of the biological roles and metabolism of PAF is still very limited and the real significance of the findings remains to be determined.\r"

  ".W": "1. Prior adaptation to a high potassium (HK) diet reduces the increment in plasma potassium after nephrectomy and acute potassium loading. Previous work has suggested that this 'extrarenal potassium adaptation' is due to direct stimulation of cellular potassium uptake by chronic hyperaldosteronism. 2. In contrast, we have shown that when dietary potassium is withdrawn from HK rats, large urinary potassium losses persist, resulting in 'paradoxical potassium depletion'. This potassium depletion facilitates cellular potassium uptake and is, at least in part, responsible for extrarenal potassium adaptation. 3. To try to reconcile these observations, we explored further the role of aldosterone in extrarenal potassium adaptation. When dietary potassium was withdrawn from chronically adrenalectomized HK rats, paradoxical potassium depletion was markedly blunted and extrarenal potassium adaptation could not be demonstrated. Similarly, urinary potassium losses and potassium depletion were reduced when acute adrenalectomy was performed concomitantly with dietary potassium withdrawal. 4. We were unable to confirm previous studies showing extrarenal potassium adaptation in the absence of potassium depletion. Thus, extrarenal potassium adaptation did not occur after pretreatment with chronic high-dose mineralocorticoid, after prior adaptation to a sodium-free diet, or after prior adaptation to an extremely HK diet in the absence of dietary potassium withdrawal. 5. We conclude that chronic hyperaldosteronism is important in extrarenal potassium adaptation, but probably not via direct enhancement of cellular potassium uptake. Rather, in HK animals, hyperaldosteronism magnifies urinary potassium losses during fasting and thus promotes potassium depletion, which in turn facilitates the uptake of an acute potassium load.\r"

We have applied the technique of television capillary microscopy to make direct measurements of nutritional capillary flow in the toe nailfold (i) at heart level and (ii) in a near standing position, with the foot 96 cm below heart level. By indirect heating we have examined the relationship between posture-related changes and thermoregulation in the capillary circulation of the toe. 2. Capillary blood flow in 14 male subjects with their feet at heart level showed a positive correlation with increasing skin temperature. 3. On quiet standing, capillary blood flow decreased to 11.3% of supine values, achieved both by a reduction in capillary blood velocity and the duration of flow. 4. Indirect heating of the trunk led to a partial release of sympathetic tone and induced a significant increase in capillary blood flow in both the supine and dependent positions. However during heating, the percentage fall in capillary blood flow associated with dependency remained unchanged. 5. In conclusion, it appears that in the dependent foot, compensatory mechanisms exist to limit nutritional capillary blood flow by regulating both erythrocyte velocity and the duration of flow. These mechanisms fulfil a physiological requirement to limit the rate of oedema formation. The preservation of this response during the partial sympathetic release induced by indirect heating suggests a mechanism independent of that controlling flow through arteriovenous shunts. Our results are compatible with the hypothesis that a local vasoconstrictor mechanism is operative in the vascular resistance elements in closest relation with the capillary bed, and distal to that regulating arteriovenous shunt flow.\r"

In order to evaluate the influence of varying degrees of anaemia on exercise capacity and haemodynamic parameters, 13 patients on chronic intermittent haemodialysis with haemoglobin levels between 5.1 and 12.2 g/100 ml were subjected to an exhaustive exercise test. Measurements during bicycle ergometry consisted of O2 uptake at the anaerobic threshold and of maximum O2 uptake. Resting haemodynamic parameters such as cardiac index, heart rate, stroke volume index and blood pressure were assessed non-invasively in the 13 patients undergoing exercise and in an additional three patients. 2. O2 uptake at the anaerobic threshold as well as maximum peripheral O2 uptake were severely impaired and were positively correlated with haemoglobin concentration. The strongest correlation was found between the impairment of O2 uptake at maximum workload, as assessed by maximum O2 uptake/predicted maximum O2 uptake, and haemoglobin concentration. Haemodynamic alterations in the resting state consisted of a cardiac index in the upper normal range and did not correlate with the haemoglobin concentration. 3. We conclude from our study that exercise capacity in patients on chronic intermittent haemodialysis is severely impaired and that the impairment of aerobic and anaerobic capacity is significantly correlated with the severity of renal anaemia.\r"

  ".W": "1. The intensity of breathlessness during exercise was measured in ten normal subjects using a visual analogue scale (VAS) and a Borg scale to compare the use of the scales and their repeatability, both within the duration of a period of exercise and between tests. For each scale, subjects performed two exercise tests separated by a period of 2-6 weeks. Each exercise test consisted of two cycles of progressively increasing and decreasing workload. 2. All subjects felt confidently able to use both scales to quantify their feelings of breathlessness exclusively of other sensation. Equal preference was expressed for use of a particular scale. 3. With both scales there was a large intersubject variation in the relationship between dyspnoea score and minute ventilation (VE) (P less than 0.01), and in the range of the scale used. 4. There was a good correlation between the VAS and Borg scores at each level of VE (r2 = 0.71), but the VAS score was used over a wider range than the Borg score. 5. The relationship between VE and the dyspnoea score measured by the two techniques was predominantly linear. The mean r2 for VAS score/VE was 0.68 (SD 0.19) and for Borg score/VE the mean r2 was 0.75 (SD 0.13). 6. The relationships VAS score/VE and Borg score/VE were unaffected by the direction in which the workload was varied (P greater than 0.05). 7. VE, measured at each work rate, did not differ between the two cycles (P greater than 0.05) or between the 2 days (P greater than 0.05).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The basic biochemical defect of cystic fibrosis (CF) remains undetermined, but impaired function of the beta-adrenoceptor-mediated adenosine 3':5'-cyclic monophosphate (cyclic AMP)-dependent regulatory pathway in secretory cells is likely to be involved in the pathophysiology of the disease. 2. We have compared responsiveness to beta-adrenergic stimulation in vivo by infusing isoprenaline locally into peripheral veins of CF patients and control subjects; the dorsal hand vein technique was used to measure the vascular response to isoprenaline. 3. CF patients required significantly higher doses of isoprenaline for half-maximal dilatation of the preconstricted veins (ED50) than controls (geometric mean: 44.5 ng/min in CF patients compared with 14.8 ng/min in controls; P less than 0.05). Maximal venodilatation was 74 +/- 30% of baseline in CF patients compared with 94 +/- 50% in controls (NS between groups). 4. The clinical score of CF patients was uncorrelated with the ED50 of isoprenaline. Thus the decreased beta-adrenergic responsiveness does not seem to be related to the severity of the disease. 5. Our results indicate a defect in the cyclic-AMP-dependent pathway in vascular smooth muscle cells of CF patients. Whether this is associated with the CF gene defect itself requires further study.\r"

Twenty-four patients with primary hyperparathyroidism were studied before and 18 restudied 6.5 months (mean) after parathyroidectomy, to investigate the pathogenesis of the hypertension which may accompany this condition. Comparison was made with age-matched patients with essential hypertension and with normotensive control subjects. 2. There was a significant inverse relationship between mean arterial pressure and 51Cr-labelled ethylene-diaminetetra-acetate (51Cr-EDTA) clearance in patients with hyperparathyroidism both before and after parathyroidectomy, but not in patients with essential hypertension. 3. Creatinine clearance appeared to overestimate glomerular filtration rate in some patients with hyperparathyroidism, falling significantly after surgery while 51Cr-EDTA clearance was unchanged. This observation may explain the failure of some previous studies to relate hypertension to impairment of renal function. 4. Plasma renin activity, plasma aldosterone and whole-body exchangeable sodium did not differ between normotensive and hypertensive patients with primary hyperparathyroidism and were unchanged after surgery. 5. Parathyroidectomy did not result in any change in blood pressure or in glomerular filtration rate measured by 51Cr-EDTA clearance.\r"

The present study investigated the role of intestinal cholesterol absorption in the regulation of cholesterol metabolism and serum lipoprotein levels in 22 patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia on low to normal cholesterol intake. 2. The results showed that the higher the dietary cholesterol absorption, the lower was the overall synthesis of cholesterol. Efficient cholesterol absorption actually reduced the elimination of cholesterol as faecal neutral sterols but not consistently as bile acids. 3. In multifactorial analysis, body mass index and dietary plant sterols were negatively associated with cholesterol absorption, but were unrelated to cholesterol synthesis. 4. Fractional cholesterol absorption was related only to the serum very-low-density triacylglycerol level. It was not associated with the total or low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels. On the other hand, cholesterol synthesis was significantly associated with the serum concentrations of very-low-density lipoprotein and intermediate-density lipoprotein cholesterol and triacylglycerols, and with those of low-density lipoprotein triacylglycerols. 5. In conclusion, dietary cholesterol absorption is an essential regulator of cholesterol homoeostasis in familial hypercholesterolaemia, even in patients on low cholesterol intake.\r"

The present study was designed to examine whether the urinary defect is related to abnormalities in the renal kallikrein content in this hypertensive model. 2. Active and total kallikrein were measured (amidolytic assay) in the renal cortex of newborn and 4-, 8- and 12-week-old SHR and age-matched WKY. Active and total kallikrein were also measured in urine at the same ages, except at birth. 3. Tissue active kallikrein was significantly lower in SHR at birth, representing on average 53% of the values in WKY expressed as content per total cortex weight. Tissue total kallikrein did not differ between newborn SHR and WKY. 4. SHR at 4, 8 and 12 weeks of age had lower urinary active and total kallikrein excretion. Tissue active akllikrein, but not total kallikrein, was higher than in age-matched WKY per g of cortex weight or per mg of protein, whereas both tissue active and total kallikrein were lower in SHR when expressed as content per total cortex weight. At these three ages, active kallikrein represented, on average 86%, while total kallikrein represented 77%, of the values in age-matched WKY. 5. Our results indicate a defect in prokallikrein activation rather than in kallikrein synthesis in the renal cortex of SHR at birth. The reduction in urinary kallikrein excretion during the developmental phase of hypertension in young SHR is similar to the reduction observed in the renal tissue.\r"

Compared with control plasma, ouabain-insensitive 86Rb uptake of cells was reduced and ouabain-sensitive 86Rb uptake was unchanged in the plasma of rats with malignant hypertension. The reverse was found in the plasma of uraemic rats. 3. Inhibition of ouabain-sensitive 86Rb uptake of cells occurred in the plasma of rats with malignant hypertension when an angiotensin II antagonist was added to the reaction mixture. 4. The findings confirm the presence of a frusemide-like plasma factor in malignant hypertension and a ouabain-like plasma factor in uraemic. The presence of a ouabain-like plasma factor in malignant hypertension is camouflaged by an elevated circulating angiotensin II level, which stimulates K+ transport.\r"

Lithium clearance was used as an index of proximal tubule sodium handling. 3. When the perfusate contained an oncotic agent (albumin, 6.7 g/dl) the SHR kidneys performed differently from the WKY kidneys with a reduction in inulin clearance, sodium excretion, fractional sodium excretion and fractional lithium excretion [at 105 mmHg (14 kPa) perfusion pressure, SHR 6.0 +/- 1.1% vs WKY 12.6 +/- 2.4% (mean +/- SEM); at 150 mmHg (20 kPa), SHR 17.1 +/- 1.6% vs WKY 27.0 +/- 2.3%]. Calculated indices of distal tubular function showed no major differences between SHR and WKY. 4. When kidneys were perfused without oncotic agent in the perfusate the differences between SHR and WKY in tubular handling of sodium and lithium were largely abolished. 5. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that increased sodium reabsorption occurs in the proximal tubules of the kidneys of SHR and suggest that this is an intrinsic property of the kidney, not immediately dependent on neural or humoral factors. Increased sodium reabsorption in the proximal tubule may contribute significantly to the existence of hypertension in the SHR.\r"

Continuous ambulatory recordings were obtained in 16 male subjects; six were healthy nonsnorers, five were healthy snorers, and five had sleep apnea.

Thirty-nine patients demonstrated hyperreactive airways (HA) by carbachol inhalation and/or eucapnic hyperventilation of cold air. Twenty-seven of 78 without HA had postnasal drip, and 13 of 78 had a persistent cough following acute upper airway inflammation. Other less common diagnoses included chronic bronchitis, gastro-esophageal reflux, occupational bronchitis, interstitial lung disease, and psychologic causes. We were able to find the cause of cough 88 percent of the time. Treatment adjusted for noncompliance was not always a success. While all patients with HA improved, 8 percent of patients without HA or specific diagnosis did not have an improvement in their cough upon retrospective inquiry. Based on this analysis, we find that the diagnosis and treatment of cough may not be as successful as originally reported using Irwin's approach.\r"

The changes in HR and SaO2 during breath-hold (B), Valsalva (V) and Mueller (M) maneuvers were determined in nine male subjects with OSAS while breathing RA or O2. Oxygen saturation was significantly lower breathing RA than O2 at the end of B (92.6 +/- 1.6 vs 97.2 +/- 0.8 percent), V (92.9 +/- 1.3 vs 95.2 +/- 1.7 percent), and M (92.7 +/- 1.2 vs 95.3 +/- 1.9 percent). Despite this, there was no significant difference between the HR change while breathing RA and O2 during B (12 +/- 18 vs 7 +/- 15 beats/minute), V (-2 +/- 12 vs -5 +/- 17 beats/minute), and M (5 +/- 16 vs 1 +/- 8 beats/minute). The change in HR was not related to the duration of B, V, or M or to the mouth pressure generated during V and M. In order to determine if awake HR response to the maneuvers reflected HR response to obstructive apnea, we examined the relationship between the HR response to B, V, and M during wakefulness and the response to obstructive apnea of similar duration while asleep. A significant correlation was found between the HR response to obstructive sleep apnea during sleep and the response to awake B (r = 0.67, p less than 0.001), V (r = 0.51, p less than 0.05), and M (r = 0.75, p less than 0.001). We conclude that in OSAS, increased vagal tone is a major determinant of HR response to voluntary respiratory maneuvers, that bradycardia can occur in the absence of hypoxemia, and that HR response to these maneuvers, especially to M, during wakefulness predicts HR response to obstructive apnea while asleep.\r"

Nineteen age-matched male control subjects (group 1) were also tested to determine the normal endurance and oxygen consumption during arm exercise in their age group and to compare the results with those obtained during a standard treadmill performance. The maximal heart rate, systolic blood pressure, pressure rate product, and oxygen consumption were all significantly lower for arm than for leg exercise. However, there was good correlation between all these parameters for both types of exertion. The maximal heart rate, work load and oxygen consumption were greater for group 1 subjects than in patients with peripheral vascular disease despite similar activity status. None of the group 1 subjects had abnormal arm exercise ECGs, while six members of group 2 had ST segment changes. Thallium-201 scintigraphy performed in the latter group demonstrated perfusion defects in 25 patients. After nine to 29 months of follow-up, three patients who had abnormal tests developed angina and one of them required coronary bypass surgery. Arm exercise with myocardial scintigraphy may be an effective method of detecting occult ischemia in patients with peripheral vascular disease. Those with good exercise tolerance and no electrocardiographic changes or 201T1 defects are probably at lower risk for the development of cardiac complications, while those who develop abnormalities at low exercise levels may be candidates for invasive studies.\r"

We hypothesized that those patients with the highest hypoxic drives would be the most likely to have increased exercise tolerance with supplemental oxygen. Seventeen patients with CAO (mean FEV1 = 0.99 +/- 0.45 L) underwent identical maximal cycle ergometry exercise tests on two occasions 45 minutes apart while breathing either air or 30 percent oxygen in a randomized single-blind fashion. With supplemental oxygen, the ventilation decreased and the PaCO2 increased significantly at rest. The patients had a significantly greater exercise tolerance on supplemental oxygen (76.7 vs 69.1 watts, p less than 0.005) but no increase in the maximal ventilation. When the nine patients who improved were compared to the eight patients who did not improve, the two groups were basically identical. Specifically, there were no significant differences in the mean ventilatory or mouth occlusion responses to hypoxia or in the blood gases. The patients who did improve tended to have a greater reduction in their ventilatory response to exercise while exercising on oxygen as compared to when they were exercising on room air. From this study, it was concluded that measurements of hypoxic ventilatory drive are not helpful in predicting which patients with CAO are likely to have improved exercise capability while breathing supplemental oxygen.\r"

  ".W": "Serious respiratory depression has been described in COPD patients receiving hypnotics during acute exacerbations. There are few studies quantifying the effects of hypnotics on oxygenation during sleep in patients with stable hypoxemic COPD. In this study, the effects of single therapeutic doses of nitrazepam and flunitrazepam on SaO2, apneas during sleep and other sleep variables were measured in 14 COPD patients. All patients used theophylline. Sleep-induced decrease in mean SaO2 was 1.3 percent after placebo, 1.4 percent after nitrazepam and 1.9 percent after flunitrazepam (no significant differences). Sleep apneas were not more common or longer after nitrazepam or flunitrazepam, but sleep quality seemed to improve. It is concluded that oxygenation during sleep in these nonobese patients with stable hypoxemic nonhypercapnic COPD, all on maintenance theophylline therapy, was affected very little by single therapeutic doses of nitrazepam or flunitrazepam.\r"

  ".W": "To evaluate a possible cardiac pathophysiology of the chronic fatigue syndrome, we compared the resting cardiac function and exercise performance of 41 patients to those of an age-matched and sex-matched normal control group. Persistent fatigue following an acute apparently viral illness was the major complaint of all patients; none had specific cardiac symptoms nor abnormal physical findings. Electrocardiographic spatial patterns were normal in the patients, and there were no differences in the body surface sum of positive T-wave integrals between the patients (240 microV.x 10(2) +/- 107 microV.s x10(2)) and control (244 microV.x 10(2) +/- 108 microV.s x 10(2) subjects. Twenty-four hour ambulatory ECGs revealed no differences in sinus rates and incidences of ventricular dysrhythmias in the two populations. Left ventricular dimensions and systolic fractional shortening values were also similar in both groups; moreover none of the patients had segmental wall motion abnormalities. On graded exercise testing, 20 of 32 normal subjects achieved target (85 percent of age-maximum) heart rates, compared to four of 31 patients (p less than 0.001). The duration of exercise averaged 12 +/- 4 minutes for the normal subjects and 9+/- 4 minutes for the patients (p less than 0.01). The temporal profile of exercise heart rates was dissimilar in the two groups, with patients' rates consistently and progressively less than those of normal subjects. Peak heart rate averaged 152 +/- 16 beats per minute for the normal group vs 124 +/- 19 beats per minute for the patients (p less than 0.0001); in age-related terms, respectively, 82 +/- 6 percent of the maximum heart rate vs 66 +/- 10 percent (p less than 0.0001). Thus, patients with chronic fatigue syndrome have normal resting cardiac function but a markedly abbreviated exercise capacity characterized by slow acceleration of heart rate and fatigue of exercising muscles long before peak heart rate is achieved.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

No malignant arrhythmias were observed following fulguration. There were five early deaths, four deaths related to the procedure, and eight late deaths, but no death was thought to be related to the endocardial shock itself. Thus, fulguration appears to be a valuable adjunct to the treatment of drug-resistant VT.\r"

  ".W": "The proper classification of pleural effusions into transudates and exudates has great clinical significance. It is believed that the treatment of congestive heart failure may convert an associated transudative pleural effusion into a \"pseudoexudate.\" We studied eight patients with congestive heart failure during nine episodes of decompensation with pleural effusion, which was bilateral in five and right-sided in three. Thoracocentesis was done on identification of the patient and at 6 +/- 2 days after treatment of heart failure resulting in diuresis and a mean weight loss of 5.8 +/- 3.2 kg. The mean protein level of the pleural fluid was 2.2 +/- 0.7 g/dL at the initial study and increased to 3.2 +/- 1.08 g/dL at the final study (p less than 0.01). The LDH level of the pleural fluid increased from 116 +/- 69 to 183 +/- 117 units/L (p less than 0.01). The fluid/serum ratio for protein increased from 0.34 +/- 0.09 to 0.47 +/- 0.13 (p less than 0.01) and for LDH from 0.39 +/- 0.16 to 0.64 +/- 0.28 (p less than 0.01). In three patients, pleural fluid was classified as a transudate at the initial study but met the criteria for an exudate after treatment of heart failure. Effectiveness of diuresis was measured by weight loss; a significant correlation between weight loss per day and change in the protein level of the pleural fluid was noted (r = 0.715; p less than 0.05). We conclude that the treatment of congestive heart failure causes significant changes in the pleural fluid's chemistry; in some cases, a transudate may be converted into a \"pseudoexudate.\"\r"

Homogeneity of distribution was quantified using indices derived from computerized analysis of Anger camera pulmonary images including skew (a measure of distribution asymmetry) and kurtosis (a measure of distribution range). Aerosol clearance in 97 minutes (a measure of large, central airway deposition) was also assessed. Values of skew and kurtosis were reproducible for the patients with CF and were significantly elevated compared to the normal subjects. Reproducibility of skew and kurtosis were not studied in the normal subjects. Clearance was not significantly different in the two groups. We conclude that the bronchopulmonary distribution of this radioaerosol is nonuniform in patients with CF, compared to normal subjects, and clearance may be impaired in patients with CF who are severely ill.\r"

  ".W": "The diagnosis of asbestos-related pulmonary disease is frequently based in part on the identification of pleural plaques; however, postmortem observations have suggested that pleural plaques may occur without associated pulmonary disease. To examine this issue, we compared the pulmonary parenchymal pathology in 93 patients with pleural plaques to 93 control patients matched for age, race, and sex, all autopsied at The Johns Hopkins Hospital between Jan 1, 1981 and March 31, 1986. Pulmonary sections were graded without knowledge of the patient's group for peribronchiolar fibrosis, other types of fibrosis, emphysema, and pleural changes. Correlations were found between the presence of pleural plaques and peribronchiolar fibrosis (p less than 0.001), alveolar fibrosis (p less than 0.05), large scars (p less than 0.02), scar-related emphysema (p less than 0.02), and pleural thickening (p less than 0.005). A history of smoking was also associated with pleural plaques (p less than 0.05). Interstitial fibrosis was not significantly different between the two groups. Peribronchiolar fibrosis was neither universally nor exclusively present in patients with pleural plaques, being found in 49 (53 percent) of 93 subjects with and 36 (39 percent) of 93 subjects without plaques. The results suggest that caution must be exercised in extrapolating from the identification of pleural plaques to a diagnosis of asbestos-related pulmonary disease.\r"

From 1970 to 1986, some 74 patients with rounded atelectasis have been seen at the Lung Department. Sixty-four of these patients had been exposed to asbestos. The lesion was secondary to a benign asbestos pleurisy in nine patients and resulted from a slowly increasing pleural fibrosis in 13 patients; in the remaining 39 patients with exposure to asbestos, rounded atelectasis was a sudden finding, with earlier roentgenograms showing only plaques or being normal. Three patients had bilateral lesions, and one had no fewer than three small rounded atelectases. All of the asbestos-exposed patients were men. Ten patients (four women and six men) had not been exposed to asbestos. Two of these cases occurred after trauma and four after a pleural exudate. One of the latter was the only one which disappeared spontaneously. The lingula was affected in 33 cases, the middle lobe in 16, the right lower lobe in 12, the left lower lobe in 11, the right upper lobe in six, and the left upper lobe (except the lingula) in one. Nine patients underwent surgery. Operation should be avoided; the typical roentgenologic and CT findings combined with negative results of bronchoscopy (and, in some cases, fine-needle biopsy) will suffice to exclude malignancy.\r"

  ".W": "Carborundum is a synthetic abrasive manufactured through fusion of high grade silica sand and finely ground carbon in an electric furnace at 2,400 degrees C. It had been considered an inert dust until recently. Two recent epidemiologic studies in Quebec have documented an excess of interstitial lung disease in plant workers and some 30 workers have received workman compensation. Histopathologic lesions have been described in four of the workers. To further investigate the carborundum pneumoconiosis, nine groups of eight sheep were exposed once in the tracheal lobe to either 100 ml saline, 100 mg latex beads in 100 ml saline, 100 mg graphite in 100 ml saline, 100 mg carborundum particles in 100 ml saline, 100 mg ashed carborundum particles in 100 ml saline, 100 mg of quartz (Minusil-5) in 100 ml saline, 100 mg crocidolite fibers in 100 ml saline, 100 mg carborundum fibers in 100 ml saline, and 100 mg ashed carborundum fibers in 100 ml saline solutions. The animals had BAL at two-month intervals and autopsy at month 8. The BAL analyses of cellularity, cytotoxicity and fibrogenicity, in association to necropsy histopathology, documented that all particles except for quartz were inert. The two-carborundum fiber samples produced a similar sustained nodular fibrosing alveolitis and crocidolite asbestos fibers produced a peribronchiolar fibrosing alveolitis of comparable severity. Thus, the major bioactive dusts in the carborundum manufacturing process are quartz particles and the carborundum fibers generated in the process. The latter have fibrogenic activities comparable to asbestos fibers of similar size and are likely to contribute to the pathogenesis of the interstitial lung disease of carborundum workers.\r"

A combination of anteroposterior indices at the upper and lower level of the chest were investigated to quantitate and to discriminate the different pectus deformities. The study comprised four groups: pectus excavatum, pectus carinatum, pectus deformatum and pectus excavatum with scoliosis. These indices were also assessed in 250 healthy males and females. Generally, several indices showed significant and discriminative changes in the different patient groups and improved again after surgery. Preoperative lung function was decreased in pectus excavatum only. In all groups lung function worsened after surgery. A stepwise discriminant analysis performed on the large group with pectus excavatum indicated that postoperative lung function was decreased if the preoperative value of FEV1 or VC was more than about 75 percent predicted and vice versa, but that it was not related to other factors such as radiologic indices, age at operation or time since operation.\r"

The Oxymizer pendant improves efficiency of oxygen delivery compared with SF. However, the device requires that the patient inhale and exhale nasally to maximize its oxygen-saving properties. When patients do PLB they may not receive full oxygen-saving benefit of the pendant. Yet PLB itself can increase SaO2. We evaluated an AP, which does not require nasal exhalation, in nine patients with COPD. We measured SaO2 while breathing oxygen via SF and the AP with nasal-only breathing and PLB. Results indicate that the AP maintains an increase in SaO2 over SF during nasal-only breathing and a further increase during PLB. We conclude that AP acts as an oxygen conserver during PLB; PLB with the AP achieves greater savings than with nasal-only breathing.\r"

Six patients with hypercapnia and four with hypoxemic acute respiratory failure met clinical and objective criteria for mechanical ventilation, which was delivered with pressure control and pressure support via a tightly strapped, clear face mask. No patient terminated the study because of inability to deliver adequate ventilation or to improve oxygen exchange; three eventually required endotracheal intubation. The mask was generally well tolerated. All patients had a nasogastric tube placed on suction, and none vomited or aspirated. The mean duration of treatment was 33 h (range, 3 to 88). The physiologic response was considered similar to that which would have been achieved with conventionally delivered ventilation. Noninvasive face mask ventilation may have a role in managing respiratory failure.\r"

The adult respiratory distress syndrome was associated with sepsis (n = 16), postoperation (n = 7), and trauma (n = 1). Fourteen of the 24 patients (58 percent) died. Although there were no significant differences in the indices of pulmonary or renal dysfunction between survivors and nonsurvivors, evidence of hepatic dysfunction was different in the two groups. On the day we identified ARDS, serum bilirubin was 1.2 mg/dl +/- 0.9 mg/dl in patients who survived, and was 2.3 mg/dl +/- 2.8 mg/dl (chi +/- SD) in those who died. Initial serum glutamic oxalacetic transaminase (SGOT) and alkaline phosphatase levels were lower in survivors than in those who died (71 +/- 44 IU/L vs 399 +/- 807 IU/L, and 121 +/- 53 IU/L vs 269 +/- 243 IU/L, respectively). These abnormalities persisted during the first week of respiratory failure, with significant differences in serum bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase between survivors and nonsurvivors (p less than 0.01). The degree of pulmonary and renal dysfunction was similar in both groups.

Eight-one attempts at left endobronchial placement were made on 74 stable adult intensive care unit patients. The suction catheter was inserted into the oral endotracheal tube or tracheostomy tube just prior to an x-ray filming of the chest. In 15 of 66 patients, the tip of the oral endotracheal tube was too distal (less than 2 cm above the carina) to allow proper functioning of the catheter. Patients with a properly positioned oral endotracheal tube were analyzed separately and showed 56 percent of the catheters went to the left bronchus. When the head was turned to the left prior to placement, successful left bronchus placement occurred in 65 percent. When the catheter was placed through a tracheostomy tube, 100 percent went into the left bronchus (n = 15). There were no catheter-induced complications in this study. The curved tip catheter is an effective means of suctioning the left bronchial tree in patients with tracheostomy tubes. Its reliability in patients with oral endotracheal tubes is reduced but more effective than current methods.\r"
