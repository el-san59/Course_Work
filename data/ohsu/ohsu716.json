In the 9 children with pure attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), the distribution of regional cerebral activity was abnormal--low in striatal and posterior periventricular regions and high in occipital regions. Low activity in striatal and posterior periventricular areas was also seen in the 8 children with ADHD in combination with phonologic-syntactic dysphasia. 7 children with dysphasia, but without hyperactive behaviour, had low cerebral activity in left temporofrontal regions.\r"

The amplitude was higher in younger children with migraine (under 13 years) than that in older children or adults with migraine. Children with periodic syndrome had VERs similar to those of children with migraine. The VER, especially in children, may prove to be a useful test in the diagnosis of migraine.\r"

Among persons with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) reported to Centers for Disease Control by March 31, 1989, 15% (13,616) had Kaposi's sarcoma. Kaposi's sarcoma was commoner among those who had acquired the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) by sexual contact than parenterally, the percentage with Kaposi's sarcoma ranging from 1% in men with haemophilia to 21% in homosexual or bisexual men. Women were more likely to have Kaposi's sarcoma if their partners were bisexual men rather than intravenous drug users. Kaposi's sarcoma risk was not consistently related to age or race but varied across the United States, being greatest in the areas that were the initial foci of the AIDS epidemic. Thus Kaposi's sarcoma in persons with AIDS may be caused by an as yet unidentified infectious agent, transmitted mainly by sexual contact.\r"

Before bone-marrow transplantation, there was strong recipient anti-donor cellular cytotoxic reactivity directed against several minor histocompatibility (mH) antigens, including the male-specific H-Y antigen. After conditioning treatment, no recipient anti-donor cytotoxic activity could be detected, and good graft function was shown a month after transplantation. Thereafter, however, graft function deteriorated rapidly, while recipient-derived anti-donor cellular cytotoxic reactivity, against similar mH antigens, reappeared. The recipient-derived cytotoxic T lymphocytes could completely inhibit growth of donor haemopoietic progenitor cells both before and after bone-marrow transplantation. Thus, cytotoxic T lymphocytes can survive very intensive conditioning regimens, and residual recipient cytotoxic T lymphocytes directed against mH antigens expressed on donor haemopoietic progenitor cells may cause graft rejection after HLA-identical T-lymphocyte-depleted bone-marrow transplantation.\r"

A total of 1,010 questionnaires were distributed in five high schools in a relatively affluent school district (Group I, 510 surveys with a 92.4% response rate) and five high schools in a relatively less affluent school district (Group II, 500 surveys with an 86.0% response rate). Three percent of all high school students reported using anabolic steroids: 5.0% of males and 1.4% of females. Among Group I students, 5.9% of all athletes reported using anabolic steroids, whereas only 1.5% of all Group II athletes admitted using them. A 10.2% usage of anabolic steroids among Group I male athletes was observed, but only 2.8% of Group II male athletes reported their use. The median age for anabolic steroid consumption was 17 yr. The primary source of anabolic steroids was the black market (85.2%), while physicians directly supplied anabolic steroids to only 7.4% of the adolescents. It appears that within the high school adolescent population, Group I male athletes are the primary consumers of these drugs, with a reported 10.2% prevalence.\r"

Seven male subjects performed two bouts of cycle exercise (60% VO2max) drinking either a CE beverage (4.85% polycose, 2.65% fructose) or distilled water. Subjects continued to drink ad libitum for 3 h during recovery in the heat. No significant differences were observed between drinks for rectal temperature, heart rate, or sweat rate during exercise. Subjects tended to drink more (P less than 0.0565) water than the CE beverage during exercise, but plasma volume (percent PV) decreased less (P less than 0.0253) and plasma [( glucose], P less than 0.0001 and [K+], P less than 0.0047) were higher when subjects drank the CE solution. At the end of exercise, plasma osmolality and [Na+] were also higher (P less than 0.05) when subjects drank the CE beverage rather than water. Rating of perceived exertion was higher (P less than 0.0001) when drinking water. In recovery, ingesting the CE beverage, 1) subjects drank more (P less than 0.0012); 2) plasma volume increased to a higher level (P less than 0.0017); 3) plasma osmolality (P less than 0.0001), [Na+] (P less than 0.0001), glucose (P less than 0.0001), and [K+] (P less than 0.0015) were greater; and 4) body weight increased more (P less than 0.0422) than when water was ingested. Thus, in terms of minimizing physiological disturbances, ad libitum drinking of the CE beverage was as effective as drinking water during exercise but was more effective in recovery.\r"

  ".W": "The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of increased training intensity (ITI) on VO2max, plasma lactate accumulation, ventilatory threshold (VT), and performance in trained distance runners. Seven trained male distance runners increased their training intensity three d.wk-1 at 90-95% HRmax for eight wk. ITI did not alter VO2max (65.3 +/- 2.3 vs 65.8 +/- 2.4 ml.kg-1.min-1) but improved 10 km race time (means = 63 s decrease) and increased run time to exhaustion on the treadmill at the same speed and grade (means = 3.88 min). Significant decreases in plasma lactate concentration at 85 and 90% of VO2max were observed after ITI. No differences were found in plasma lactate at 65, 70, 75 or 80% of VO2max or VT following ITI. Significant correlations were obtained between 10 km race times and changes in plasma lactate at 85 and 90% of VO2max (r = 0.69 and 0.73, respectively). Lactate accumulation at both 2.5 and 4.0 mM were at a significantly greater percent of VO2max after ITI. Additionally, the changes in plasma lactate were dissociated from alterations in VT after ITI. These data indicate that previously trained runners can increase training intensity to improve endurance performance by lowering lactate at the intensity at which they trained despite no changes in VO2max and VT.\r"

VO2max was measured during treadmill running (TR), cycle ergometry (CE), and tethered swimming (TS). Lactate threshold (LT), defined as the VO2 at a lactate concentration of 4 mM, was determined during TR and CE. In all sessions, TS VO2max was less than TR and CE (P less than 0.05), and CE was less than TR (P less than 0.05). Means for Session I were 57.4, 53.4, and 48.3 ml.min-1.kg-1 for TR, CE, and TS, respectively. Corresponding values for Session IV were 58.4, 56.0, and 47.8 ml.min-1.kg-1. The only significant increase in VO2max was for CE (5%). VO2 at the LT increased from Session I to IV for both TR (6%) and CE (10%); the LT for TR was at a higher VO2 than for CE in all sessions. The percent VO2max at LT for TR in Sessions I and IV was 80 and 85%, respectively. Analogous values for CE were 72 and 76%. The minimal increases in VO2max suggest that subjects had reached their potential in this parameter. Improvements in race performance were probably attained through peripheral adaptations, as suggested by increases in the VO2 at LT. The occurrence of the LT at a lower percent VO2max in cycling than in running suggests that the triathletes had greater potential for improvement in cycling.\r"

  ".W": "The effect of hydraulic circuit training (HCT) on cardiovascular (CV) function was assessed in 32 healthy middle-aged males (X age = 42.2 +/- 2.1 yr). Maximal aerobic power (VO2max), with simultaneous measurement of stroke volume (SV) and cardiac output (CO), by impedance cardiography, was assessed pre- and post-training. Subjects were randomly assigned to a nonexercising control group, a cycle training group (cycle), or one of the two HCT groups. Training groups participated in a 9 wk program, 3 d.wk-1. Subjects assigned to HCT exercised on a 9 station circuit, completing 3 circuits.d-1. Each circuit consisted of three 20 s work intervals at each station with a 1:1 work:rest ratio. One HCT group (HCTmax) completed the maximal repetitions possible (RM) during each work interval. The other HCT group (HCTsub) exercised at 70-85% of RM. Following training VO2max (ml.kg-1 min-1) was significantly increased in all training groups (18.0, 12.5, and 11.3% for cycle, HCTsub, and HCTmax groups, respectively; P less than 0.05). The increase in VO2max observed in the cycle group was significantly greater than that recorded by the two HCT groups (P less than 0.05). For all three training groups, the increase in VO2max was associated with increases in SVmax and COmax (P less than 0.05 for both). These findings suggest that both maximal and submaximal HCT programs can elicit improvements in cardiovascular fitness.\r"

  ".W": "The ability of sport shoe midsole materials to attenuate impact loads was assessed. The three materials examined were mechanically characterized as a stiff spring (STS), subordinate spring/dominant damper (SS/DD), and dominant spring/subordinate damper (DS/SD). Each material was used as the midsole in one pair of basketball shoes. Nine male intercollegiate basketball players performed five vertical jumps in each condition. Vertical ground reaction force and discrete in-shoe stress data were recorded during the landing phase of the jump. Material differences did not alter vertical impact forces. The mean (standard deviation) DS/SD calcaneal impact stress (523.0 (277.4) kPa) was significantly reduced compared to the SS/DD (787.2 (283.7) kPa) and STS (708.9 (394.2) kPa) conditions. In addition, DS/SD calcaneal loading rates were 48.5 and 62.3% of the SS/DD and STS impact rates, respectively. Stress moderation differences across the forefoot were not detected. In vitro modeling suggested improved DS/SD calcaneal impact moderation was founded upon its minimal viscous properties, which allowed greater surface deflection. Lack of discernible forefoot differences were traced to minimal forefoot midsole thickness (0.64 cm) as compared with the rearfoot (1.59 cm). These data indicate the most successful moderation of impact stresses was achieved by the material displaying the least stiffness at in vivo loading rates, providing sufficient material thickness was maintained to allow deflection without bottoming.\r"

Signals governing satellite cell growth were studied using a tissue culture system consisting of single myofibers with attached satellite cells. The cells remain quiescent in basal medium but enter the cell cycle in response to growth factor obtained from injured muscle. The growth factor exhibits both source and target specificity and appears to be a polypeptide greater than 30 Kd. Satellite cells exposed to growth factor enter the S phase of the cell cycle by 18 h and proliferate with a generation time of 12 h. The growth factor is active in vivo and increases the proliferation and fusion of satellite cells to myofibers when injected intramuscularly in rat pups or adults. In addition to positive signals, satellite cell growth is modulated by negative feedback from the mature myofiber, as satellite cells removed from single myofibers by centrifugation show increased sensitivity to growth factor. The mitotic inhibition imposed on satellite cells results from contact with the myofiber plasmalemma and not the basal lamina, as shown by comparison of satellite cell mitogenesis in killed and living myofibers.\r"

  ".W": "A polyclonal antibody specific to bovine basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) localizes bFGF in the extracellular matrix of rat skeletal muscle fibers, where it is bound by the heparin-rich basal lamina. FGF accumulation appears to be augmented in hypertrophied compared to control fibers. In addition, FGF-like growth activity can be isolated from hypertrophied muscle. This growth activity binds to heparin and can be purified by heparin-affinity chromatography. When assayed in a chick myogenic cell culture system, the purified rat growth activity stimulates myobenic cell replication and stimulates myosin accumulation and synthesis. The function, in vivo, of basal lamina-localized FGF in rat muscle is not known, but it is most probably related to increased satellite cell replication seen during normal fiber maturation, during work-induced hypertrophy, and during regeneration. During hypertrophy, we observe the appearance of new fibers in addition to growth of preexisting fibers. It is hypothesized that muscle hypertrophy involves activation of satellite cells which may then fuse with existing fibers and, in addition, also form new fibers.\r"

Peak weekly swim distances ranged from 1 to 20 miles, with an average weekly distance of 7.2 miles. Usual swim training pace varied from 17 to 50 min.mile-1, with an average swim training pace of 29.6 min.mile-1. Peak weekly cycling distances ranged from 15 to 435 miles; average was 227 miles. Cycling pace averaged 18.6 mph and ranged from 13 to 26 mph. Run distances ranged from 4 to 100 miles.wk-1 at paces between 5 1/2 and 14 min.mile-1. Average run training was 45 miles.wk-1 at a 7 min 42 s pace. There was little or no systematic difference in training between males and females. Younger triathletes, however, tended to train greater distances at faster paces. Faster finishers (less than 10.5 h in the Hawaii Ironman Triathlon) tended to average greater training distances at faster paces than slower finishers. There was, however, a great deal of overlap in training practices according to finish time. Faster finishers in the Hawaii Ironman Triathlon were able to maintain their training paces throughout all three activities of the triathlon. Large differences were seen between faster finishers and slower finishers, particularly in the ability to hold run training pace during the race. The reason for this remains unclear. Training distances appear to be more important than training paces in preparation for an ultraendurance triathlon.\r"

Although medical organization at triathlons involves certain principles which should be applied regardless of race specifics, there are certain other arrangements that will vary with the size and length of the event. For example, the longer races require a reliable communication system, fully equipped mobile response teams, and a larger number of medical staff. Medical communication needs can be served by having priority medical transmissions via UHF radio from mobile vans to a main medical station. An average of 2.5 physicians and 7.5 nurses and other paramedical volunteers for each group of 100 competitors has been found to be sufficient to meet the medical needs of triathletes. The swim, although having the greatest potential for catastrophe, accounts for only 1-3% of medical visits at the Hawaii Ironman Triathlon. Ten percent of injuries requiring medical evaluation at the Hawaii Ironman occur during the bike portion of the race. The rest occur either during the run or after finishing. Seventy-one percent of the total medical visits come directly from the finish line. Dehydration and exhaustion account for the majority of primary medical diagnoses. Appropriate medical care at triathlon races is necessary to aid athletes in safely experiencing their physical potentials.\r"

We found no major differences between the flexed or extended position of the elbow except that normal values for each of these positions varied. The yield of abnormal findings was greatest from measuring absolute motor conduction velocity across the elbow as opposed to comparing the difference in velocities between the elbow and either adjacent segment.\r"

A patient with primary hypokalemic periodic paralysis (HPP) and three healthy volunteers served as controls. The TPP patients were of Oriental and Caucasian origin and differed in their clinical symptoms. For the Caucasian patient, the Na+ content of the erythrocytes was twice the control, for the Oriental patient it was normal. The K+ dependence of the ouabain-inhibitable K+ influx (the pump action) was also abnormal in the Caucasian patient, the flux being 70% of control at 2 mM [K+]e and normal at 4 mM [K+]e. The K+ influx was normal in the Oriental patient. By contrast, the K+ leak of the cells was normal in the Caucasian and was increased in the Oriental patient. The pump/leak ratio was thus reduced in both TPP patients. All parameters investigated were normal in the patient with primary HPP. It is concluded that the ion transport systems of muscle may be altered in TPP, but that the patho-mechanism might be different in the rare Caucasian cases and the rather more common Oriental cases.\r"

Central conduction abnormalities persisted even after peripheral conduction and clinical abnormalities had recovered. Morphometric studies showed prompt restoration of the largest-diameter fibers in the peripheral nerve after clinical recovery but persistent or even more severe loss of large- and medium-sized fibers in the cervical gracile tract. This finding suggests that recovery from central-peripheral distal axonopathy begins in the largest peripheral axons, perhaps even at the expense of central axons, and that clinical recovery can occur at a time when central conduction remains abnormal. The selective central axonopathy found in certain chronic degenerative disorders may be a consequence of this slow central recovery process associated with chronic or intermittent metabolic derangements.\r"

Western blot analysis demonstrated that the antibody reacted with 30-kd and 36-kd polypeptides in the soluble fraction and with a 38-kd polypeptide in the insoluble fraction. We isolated a fraction that contained the 38-kd polypeptide from the insoluble fraction. The material in this fraction bound to F-actin. Two-dimensional electrophoresis of the fraction showed that the 38-kd polypeptide was part of the group of isoforms of troponin-T, which was identified by a monoclonal antibody developed against troponin-T.

However, the frequency, distribution, and long-term significance of these findings are poorly understood. First we performed magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the extremities as a screening test for the detection of muscle abnormalities incurred in activities of daily living in four patients with myophosphorylase deficiency (MPD) and three with muscle phosphofructokinase deficiency (PFKD). MRI findings of abnormal muscles detected upon screening were next compared with changes observed in a prospective study of muscle contractures involving the forearms of four of the patients (two MPD, two PFKD). Screening revealed abnormalities of proximal thigh muscles in three of seven patients, in two of whom (one MPD, one PFKD) a recent history of exertional myalgia coincided with increases in T1 and T2 estimates of isolated thigh muscles. In the third patient (PFKD), focal atrophy of the adductor magnus was present bilaterally. In prospective studies, focal areas of prolonged T1 and T2 appeared in the flexor digitorum superificalis in all four cases and in the flexor digitorum profundus in two cases. Serial imaging suggested that the onset of MRI abnormalities begins within 24 hours of contracture and persists for at least several days and possibly for much longer, with complete recovery apparently the rule. These cases suggests a high prevalence of focal muscle abnormalities in patients with glycolytic myopathies and show the potential of MRI to detect them.\r"

Of the 11 patients who participated in the study for more than 5 weeks, 9 developed symptoms and signs of a mainly sensory painful neuropathy that was confirmed by electromyography to be mixed sensory and motor neuropathy of axonal type. The neuropathy which developed on dideoxycytidine occurred between 9 and 12 weeks of treatment. One patient, who had the drug stopped at 3 weeks owing to thrombocytopenia, developed a similar clinical picture of a sensory peripheral neuropathy after 2 weeks off dideoxycytidine. However, he did not have electromyographic evidence of a neuropathy, and he subsequently returned to normal clinically while taking a lower dose of dideoxycytidine in an alternating regimen. Five patients were withdrawn from the study because of the neuropathy. The pattern of this neuropathy was different from that of the slowly progressive painful neuropathy of AIDS, in that there was (1) a sudden onset of intense burning discomfort in both feet sparing the hands at about the tenth week (mean 10.4 weeks) of treatment, (2) there was motor involvement in some patients without progression, and (3) onset of the neuropathy was temporally related to the administration of dideoxycytidine and began to resolve 3-5 weeks after its discontinuation. We believe that dideoxycytidine can be an axonal toxin, especially when given in high dose continuous regimens.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Another clinically similar autosomal dominant neuropathy (HMSN II) is distinguished from HMSN I by nearly normal nerve conduction velocity. Acquired demyelinating neuropathy may occasionally resemble HMSN I clinically, but the former demonstrates electrophysiologic features not seen in the latter such as conduction block, dispersed compound muscle action potentials, and differential slowing of conduction velocity. Neuropathologic studies of HMSN I suggest that both neuronal and Schwann cell distrubances play a role in pathogenesis.\r"

The BCR was evaluated by recording the associated EMG activity using a concentric needle electrode placed in the external urethral sphincter. The influence of the central nervous system (CNS) on the BCR was studied in 29 neurologically normal individuals and in 33 patients with upper motor neuron (UMN) lesions and voiding dysfunction. Ninety percent (26/29) of the neurologically normal patients did not have a BCR during most of micturition. By comparison, all the patients with an UMN lesion had a positive BCR beginning early during voiding. The finding of suprasegmental modulation of the BCR during voiding demonstrated by external urethral sphincter EMG was a more sensitive although slightly less specific sign of UMN bladder dysfunction than detrusor sphincter dyssynergia; uninhibited bladder contractions were neither sensitive nor specific for UMN lesions.\r"

This action was tested on rats made myotonic by drugs that block GCl by different mechanisms. Experiments were made \"in vivo\" using electromyographic (EMG) recordings and \"in vitro\" with intracellular microelectrode recordings from extensor digitorum longus muscle fibers. Taurine did not antagonize the myotonic discharges produced in vivo by anthracene-9-carboxylic acid, nor did it restore GCl lowered in vitro by this agent. However, when myotonia was chronically induced by 20,25 diazacholesterol, taurine given chronically in vivo or acutely in vitro antagonized the EMG myotonia as well as the reduced GCl and increased excitability of single fibers. We conclude that taurine acts directly on chloride channels to modify their kinetics. Our findings suggest that further clinical studies on the use of taurine in muscle disease involving abnormal excitability or chloride channel function will be useful.\r"

Comparative testing of other nerves in the same hand may control for these variables and improve sensitivity for detection of mild focal entrapment. In consecutive cases referred for evaluation, antidromic sensory latencies were recorded from the thumb over 10 cm segments of the median and radial nerves, and the difference between these latencies was calculated. Median sensory antidromic conduction to digit III, ulnar sensory conduction, and median motor latency measurements were also made. Three hundred and thirty-three upper limbs were studied in 262 patients. All tests were normal in 73 arms. Mild conduction slowing was identified in 86 median nerves. The median-radial latency difference was increased in 87% of these mild cases. The median-ulnar latency difference was diagnostic in 88%. Either median-radial or median-ulnar latency differences were abnormal in all confirmed cases. The routine median motor and sensory distal latency tests had sensitivities of 29% and 52%, respectively. Radial responses were elicited in 99% of the hands studied. The median-radial latency difference in digit I is a sensitive indicator of mild CTS that can be measured quickly with a minimum of discomfort.\r"

We studied the ultrastructural localization of these Ca2+ binding sites in normal human muscle fibers, using Polymyxin B as a marker for anionic phospholipids and the lectin Limulus Polyphemus as a probe for sialic acid. We found that anionic phospholipids have a patchy distribution along the muscle sarcolemma, with a preferential localization at the I band level and at the junction between the I and A band. Sialic acid has an uniform distribution along the muscle plasma membrane and basal lamina. Our observations suggest that the plasma membrane, basal lamina, and transverse tubular system play an important role in providing the negative charge of the human muscle cell surface and that these structures may be involved in the binding of calcium.\r"

The physiological and histological responses in nerve to a range of constricting cuffs of standard sizes were readily graded. The initial response to any significant constriction was a transient, focal conduction slowing or block at the constriction, followed by more protracted distal effects; the latter ranged from loss of excitability consistent with \"dying-back\" degeneration to reductions in conduction velocity consistent with histologically observed atrophy. Smaller myelinated fibers tended to have similar but less pronounced changes than larger diameter fibers. Recordings from ventral and dorsal roots showed that distal degeneration was more pronounced in motor than in sensory fibers of similar caliber. Electronmicroscopical measurements showed that basal laminas were relatively preserved around even the most atrophic and demyelinated axons. Perimeter measurements of the basal lamina could be used to estimate the diameter of the original nerve fiber.\r"

S-100 beta was found in more of the large neurons, but almost all of the small neurons were negative for S-100 beta. In the anterior horn cells, S-100 beta staining was stronger than that of S-100 alpha.

Using this test, patients with upper motor neuron muscle weakness owing to multiple sclerosis (MS) and injuries to the spinal cord showed greater fatigability of their TA muscles, suggesting that the muscle fiber population changed toward that typical of fatigable motor units. During repetitive stimulation, in addition to the decrement in tension there was an increase in half-relaxation time of tetanic contractions at 40 Hz in both subjects and patients. The increase in half relaxation during repeated activity was greater in patients with MS and spinal cord injury than in healthy subjects, suggesting that the long-term inactivity affected the efficiency of the Ca2+ uptake mechanism of their muscle fibers. Thus long-term inactivity of patients with upper motoneuron dysfunction leads to increased fatigability of their muscles and exaggerates the slowing of muscle relaxation after prolonged exercise.\r"

  ".W": "The role of motor innervation and muscle tension in the posthatching maturation of the slow-tonic anterior latissimus dorsi (ALD) muscle of the chicken has been investigated. Modification of the muscle tension was obtained either by maintaining ALD in a shortened state or by stretching, after or without denervation. In denervated as well as in innervated ALD, shortening resulted in atrophy and inhibition of developmental change in muscle fiber population. In contrast, stretch causes hypertrophy, transformation of all 3B fibers, increase in SM2 isomyosin expression, and decrease in Ca2+-activated myosin ATPase in innervated or denervated ALD. On the other hand oxidative activity in ALD fibers was strikingly reduced after denervation even in presence of stretch-induced hypertrophy. This study suggests that a passive stretch can be involved in some, but not all, changes in ALD characteristics occurring after denervation and may be also involved in normal posthatching development of the slow-tonic muscle. Possible clinical implications of these results in relation to treatments for preventing muscle atrophy resulting from immobilization or disuse are suggested.\r"

Their use has been associated with increased bone density, but their role in preventing hip fracture has not been established. We prospectively studied the effect of thiazide diuretic agents on the incidence of hip fracture among 9518 men and women 65 years of age or older residing in three communities. At base line, 24 to 30 percent of the subjects were thiazide users. In the subsequent four years, 242 subjects had hip fractures. The incidence rates of hip fracture were lower among thiazide users than nonusers in each community; the Mantel-Haenszel relative risk of hip fracture, adjusted for community and age, was 0.63 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.46 to 0.86). The protective effect of the use of thiazides was independent of sex, age, impaired mobility, body-mass index, and current and former smoking status; the multivariate adjusted relative risk of hip fracture was 0.68 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.49 to 0.94). Furthermore, the protective effect was specific to thiazide diuretic agents, since there was no association between the use of antihypertensive medications other than thiazides and the risk of hip fracture. These prospective data suggest that in older men and women the use of thiazide diuretic agents is associated with a reduction of approximately one third in the risk of hip fracture.\r"

We used the polymerase chain reaction and hybridization with allele-specific oligonucleotides to analyze the presence or absence of this mutation on 439 cystic fibrosis chromosomes and 433 normal chromosomes from non-Ashkenazic white families. This mutation was present on 75.8 percent of the cystic fibrosis chromosomes. Using the DNA markers XV-2c and KM-19, we found that 96 percent of cystic fibrosis chromosomes with the mutation had a single DNA haplotype that occurs frequently with cystic fibrosis chromosomes. This haplotype was also found on 54 percent of the cystic fibrosis chromosomes without the three-base deletion. The three-base deletion was found on only 30.3 percent of cystic fibrosis chromosomes from Ashkenazic families, although the common cystic fibrosis haplotype was present on 97 percent of cystic fibrosis chromosomes from Ashkenazic families. The ability to detect the common mutation causing cystic fibrosis represents a major improvement in prenatal diagnosis and heterozygote detection, particularly in families in which no DNA sample is available from the affected child, and provides an improved method of testing for spouses of carriers of cystic fibrosis. Mutation analysis introduces the possibility of population-based screening programs for carriers, which on the basis of the sample in this study, would currently identify about 57 percent of the non-Ashkenazic white couples at risk.\r"

We measured the 34-kd mature form of the enzyme by Western blot assay and densitometry. Among 199 patients with node-negative disease, but not among 198 with node-positive disease, high levels of cathepsin D proved to be a significant predictor of reduced disease-free survival (median follow-up, 64 months), either as a continuous variable (log cathepsin D; P = 0.018) or as a dichotomous variable with an optimized cutoff point (P = 0.0001). Results were similar for overall survival (P = 0.009 and 0.0001, respectively). Relating the level of cathepsin D to other prognostic factors in the patients with node-negative disease, we found an association with aneuploidy but none with estrogen or progesterone receptors, tumor size, or the age of the patient. In multivariate analyses, a high level of cathepsin D was the most important independent factor in predicting shorter disease-free and overall survival in patients with node-negative disease. As compared with the risk in women with low levels of cathepsin D, the relative risk of tumor recurrence was 2.6 (95 percent confidence interval, 1.6 to 4.4) and the relative risk of death was 3.9 (95 percent confidence interval, 2.1 to 7.3) among those with high levels of cathepsin D. For disease-free survival, cathepsin D status was predictive of outcome primarily among those with aneuploid tumors; the actuarial five-year recurrence rates of aneuploid tumors were 60 percent among women with high levels of cathepsin D and 29 percent among those with low levels, as compared with 22 percent for all diploid tumors. We conclude that cathepsin D may be an independent predictor of early recurrence and death in node-negative breast cancer.\r"

To investigate this possibility, we assessed pancreatic function in 78 patients identified in a neonatal screening program as having cystic fibrosis. The diagnosis of cystic fibrosis was confirmed by abnormal results on a sweat chloride test. The results of measurements of fecal fat excretion, pancreatic-stimulation tests, and estimations of the serum level of pancreatic isoamylase indicated that 29 of the 78 children (37 percent) had substantial preservation of pancreatic function. These children (median age, four years) had growth that was close to normal and comparable to growth in children with severe pancreatic insufficiency who received oral enzyme therapy. Pancreatic insufficiency subsequently developed in 6 of the 29 patients, at 3 to 36 months of age. We conclude that the serum immunoreactive-trypsin assay used in neonatal screening programs identifies patients with cystic fibrosis who have sufficient pancreatic function to have normal fat absorption and that a substantial proportion of infants identified as having cystic fibrosis are in this category.\r"

Among 1719 patients admitted to the two intensive care units, life support was withheld from 22 (1 percent) and withdrawn from 93 (5 percent). The reason for limiting care was poor prognosis. Of these 115 patients (18 of whom were considered brain-dead), 89 died in the intensive care unit (accounting for 45 percent of all deaths there), and all but 1 of the remaining patients died after transfer from the intensive care unit. Thirteen (11 percent) had earlier expressed the wish that their terminal care be limited, but this affected care in only four cases. Only 5 of the 115 patients made the actual decision to limit care; the others were incompetent at the time. Of the latter, 102 had families who participated in the decision; family members of the other 8 incompetent patients could not be found, and the decisions were made by physicians. Only 10 families initially disagreed with the recommendations to limit care, and they later agreed. The median duration of intensive care among the patients from whom life support was withheld or withdrawn was eight days at Moffitt-Long Hospital and four days at San Francisco General, as compared with medians of three and one days, respectively, for other patients who died in the intensive care units. We conclude that although life-sustaining care is withheld or withdrawn relatively infrequently from patients in the intensive care unit, such decisions precipitate about half of all deaths in the intensive care units of the hospitals we studied. In most of these cases the patients are incompetent, but physicians and families usually agree to limit care.\r"

  ".W": "The sensory bases of species and population mate preferences are well known; in frogs properties of the female auditory system influence such preferences. By contrast, there is little understanding of how sensory characteristics could result in sexual selection within a population. One possible mechanism is that females are more sensitive to male courtship signals that deviate from the population mean. We document this mechanism in the frog Physalaemus pustulosus. Female basilar papilla tuning is biased toward lower-than-average frequencies in the 'chuck' portion of the male's call, explaining female preference for the lower-frequency chucks produced by larger males. The tuning does not differ between P. pustulosus and its close relative P. coloradorum, a species in which males never evolved the ability to produce chucks; thus the female tuning evolved before the chuck and therefore the chuck played no role in the evolution of the preference. This allows us to reject two popular hypotheses for the evolution of this female preference (runaway sexual selection and natural selection) in favour of a third: sexual selection for sensory exploitation.\r"

Until now inferences about their function in vision have been based primarily on studies examining single-cell receptive field properties which have shown that the colour-opponent retinal ganglion cells have small receptive fields, produce sustained responses and receive spatially segregated inputs from different cone types; the broad-band cells have large receptive fields, respond transiently and receive cone inputs that are not spatially separated. We have now examined the visual capacities of rhesus monkeys before and after interrupting either of these channels with small lesions at the lateral geniculate nucleus. Here we report that the colour-opponent channel is essential for the processing of colour, texture, fine pattern and fine stereopsis, whereas the broad-band channel is crucial for the perception of fast flicker and motion. Little or no deficits were found in brightness and coarse-shape discrimination, low spatial frequency stereopsis and contrast sensitivity after the disruption of either of the channels.\r"

The complex of peptide and MHC molecule on the APC surface provides the stimulatory ligand for the alpha beta T cell receptor. The intracellular pathways and molecular mechanisms involved in the generation of the peptide-MHC complex are not well understood. Here, we describe several mutant APCs which are altered in their ability to present native exogenous protein antigens but effectively present immunogenic peptides derived from these proteins. The lesions in these mutants are not in the class II structural genes, but they affect the conformation of mature class II dimers.\r"

  ".W": "Models for antigen presentation have divided the world of antigens into two categories, endogenous and exogenous, presented to T cells by class I and class II major histocompatibility complex (MHC) encoded molecules, respectively. Exogenous antigens are though to be taken up into peripheral endosomal compartments where they are processed for binding to class II MHC molecules. Endogenous antigens are either synthesized or efficiently delivered to the cytoplasm before being partially degraded in an as yet undefined way, and complexed with class I MHC molecules. A useful phenotypic distinction between the two pathways has been the sensitivity to weak bases, such as chloroquine, which is a property only of the exogenous pathway. The fungal antibiotic brefeldin A (BFA), which blocks protein transport from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi network, also blocks class I-restricted antigen-presentation, providing us with the corresponding marker of the endogenous pathway. Experiments with influenza virus antigens have supported the view that class II MHC molecules can present exogenous but not endogenous antigen, whereas the observation that class II MHC molecules present measles virus non-membrane antigens by a chloroquine-insensitive pathway suggests that this is not always the case. We show here that influenza A matrix protein can be effectively presented to class II-restricted T cells by two pathways: one of which is chloroquine-sensitive, BFA-insensitive, the other being chloroquine-insensitive and BFA-sensitive. Our results indicate that both class I and class II molecules can complex with antigenic peptides in a pre-Golgi compartment and favour a unified mechanism for MHC-restricted endogenous antigen presentation.\r"

  ".U": "90114415\r", 
  ".W": "Epidermal growth factor, and its human homologue urogastrone (EGF/URO), are secreted by the gut-associated salivary and Brunner's glands. Recombinant EGF/URO is a powerful stimulator of cell proliferation and differentiation in the rodent and neonatal human intestine. But EGF/URO is not absorbed from the adult gut and has no action when given through the gut lumen; thus the role of secreted EGF/URO is unknown. We now report that ulceration of the epithelium anywhere in the human gastrointestinal tract induces the development of a novel cell lineage from gastrointestinal stem cells. This lineage initially appears as a bud from the base of intestinal crypts, adjacent to the ulcer, and grows locally as a tubule, ramifying to form a new small gland, and ultimately emerges onto the mucosal surface. The lineage produces neutral mucin, shows a unique lectin-binding profile and immunophenotype, is nonproliferative, and contains and secretes abundant immunoreactive EGF/URO. We propose that all gastrointestinal stem cells can produce this cell lineage after mucosal ulceration, secreting EGF/URO to stimulate cell proliferation, regeneration and ulcer healing. This cell lineage is very commonly associated with gastrointestinal mucosal ulceration, and we conclude that a principal in vivo role for EGF/URO is to stimulate ulcer healing throughout the gut through induction of this cell lineage in the adjacent mucosa.\r"

  ".W": "In the host cell, retroviral DNAs exist in three main forms: unintegrated linear, unintegrated circular, and integrated (the provirus). High levels of unintegrated forms of retroviral DNA often correlate with superinfection and accompanying cytopathic effects, as, for example, in the case of feline acquired immunodeficiency. In culture, HIV-1 infection also results in high levels of unintegrated viral DNA although direct correlations with cytopathicity have not been made. The low frequency of HIV-1-infected cells in patients has made it difficult to determine the structure of the viral DNA in fresh tissue samples from AIDS patients by standard methods such as Southern hybridization. The PCR technique however, which allows the detection of viral DNA at levels far below that possible by other hybridization methods is, in its conventional form, of limited use for quantitative analysis. To study the amount and form of HIV-1 DNA in primary tissue of AIDS patients we have therefore modified the PCR method. Our results indicate that each of the three species of viral DNA are detectable in blood and brain of AIDS patients, and that in autopsy samples from patients with HIV encephalitis there is a considerably higher proportion of unintegrated viral DNA.\r"

The truth is that, on the contrary, highlights are rich in local geometric information. Here we report that the three-dimensional appearance of a highlight on a computer-simulated stereoscopic curved surface affects observers' judgment of surface gloss. We also show that the 3-D appearance of a highlight affects the perception of surface curvature--that is, it can force an ambiguous convex-concave figure to change state. We thus conclude that human visual analysis seems to employ a physical model of the interaction of light with curved surfaces, a model firmly based on ray optics and differential geometry.\r"

  ".W": "In animals with internal fertilization, paternity is uncertain. In birds, the occurrence of copulations outside the pair-bond has been documented in a number of species, but the extent to which these result in illegitimate young is largely unknown, and constitutes a major deficiency in our understanding of avian mating systems. The analysis of tandemly repeated sequences (minisatellites), has enhanced our ability to make individual identifications and paternity determinations. Here we describe the use of a bird minisatellite DNA probe in assigning paternity in natural populations of the monogamous willow warbler Phylloscopus trochilus and of the polygynous wood warbler Phylloscopus sibilatrix. In both species this probe detects a multiple locus pattern and a single locus that exhibits a variable number of tandem repeats. Although we observed intrusions by non-resident males into the territories of paired males and extra-pair copulations, no illegitimate offspring were detected among 176 young from 32 families of both species, implying that extra-pair copulations have little or no genetic impact.\r"

  ".W": "Phagocyte recognition of cells that have undergone apoptosis (programmed cell death) is an event of broad biological significance. Characterized by endogenous endonuclease activation, which results in chromatin fragmentation and nuclear condensation, apoptosis leads to swift ingestion of intact but 'senescent' or 'unwanted' cells by phagocytes in processes as diverse as the physiological involution of organs, the remodelling of embryonic tissues, and metamorphosis. The cell-surface mechanisms by which macrophages recognize apoptotic cells as 'senescent-self' have remained obscure. Here we report that macrophage recognition of apoptotic cells (both neutrophils and lymphocytes) is mediated by the vitronectin receptor, a heterodimer belonging to the beta 3 or cytoadhesin family of the integrins. Previously, the functions of the vitronectin receptor were believed to be limited to cell anchorage, but our findings indicate that the receptor has a novel and direct role in self-senescent-self intercellular recognition leading to macrophage phagocytosis of cells undergoing apoptosis.\r"

  ".W": "Limb development in Drosophila requires the activity of a proximo-distal pattern-forming system, in addition to the antero-posterior and dorso-ventral pattern-forming systems that subdivide the embryo. Several lines of genetic evidence indicate that the Distal-less gene plays an important part in specifying proximo-distal positional information. The Distal-less locus encodes a homoeodomain-containing protein, which suggests that Distal-less may exert its activity through differential regulation of subordinate genes. The spatially restricted pattern of Distal-less expression allows direct visualization of the limb primordia during early embryogenesis. Here I report that from their inception, the leg primordia span the parasegment boundary. The segment polarity gene wingless seems to have a key part in defining the positions at which leg primordia will develop along the antero-posterior axis of the embryo. This analysis allows a direct molecular visualization of the compartments that subdivide the limb primordia into discrete developmental domains.\r"

  ".U": "90114439\r", 
  ".W": "Retinoic acid, the first morphogen described so far in vertebrates, is a vitamin A derivative which exerts striking effects on development and differentiation. The identification of three retinoic acid receptors as members of the nuclear receptor super-family provides an explantation for the molecular action of morphogens on gene expression. Functional analysis of the receptors requires the identification of target genes and of their cis-acting retinoic acid-responsive elements. We have previously shown that the retinoic acid receptor beta gene is transcriptionally up-regulated by retinoic acid and now report the characterization of a functional retinoic acid responsive element in the beta gene that mediates trans-activation by retinoic acid. Using deletion mapping, we have identified a 27-base pair fragment, located 59 base pairs upstream of the transcriptional start, which confers retinoic acid responsiveness on the herpes virus thymidine kinase promoter. This sequence contains a perfect direct repeat of the motif GTTCAC, which is reminiscent of the 5' half-palindrome of the thyroid and oestrogen hormone responsive elements. Specific binding of the beta protein to the retinoic acid responsive element is demonstrated and is independent of the presence of retinoic acid. Both alpha and beta receptors enhance retinoic acid response in CV1 cells, indicating that they can both act through the same DNA sequence.\r"

  ".W": "A single base-pair mutation (beta s) in codon 6 of the human beta-globin gene, causing a single amino-acid substitution, is the cause of sickle cell anaemia. The mutant haemoglobin molecule, HbS, polymerizes when deoxygenated and causes deformation of the erythrocytes to a characteristic 'sickled' shape. Sickling of cells in small vessels causes painful crises and other life-threatening complications. Although the molecular basis for sickle cell anaemia has been known for 30 years, no definitive treatment is available. An animal model of sickle cell anaemia would not only allow a detailed analysis of the factors that initiate erythrocyte sickling in vivo and of the pathophysiology of the disease, but would also permit the development of novel approaches to the treatment of the disease. By using the dominant control region sequences from the human beta-globin locus, together with human alpha- and beta s-globin genes, we have obtained three transgenic mice with HbS levels ranging from 10 to 80% of total haemoglobin in their red cells. As observed in homozygous and heterozygous Hbs patients, the erythrocytes of this mouse sickle readily on deoxygenation. Irreversibly sickled cells, which are characteristic of sickle-cell patients homozygous for beta s, are also observed in the peripheral blood of the mouse with high levels of HbS.\r"

  ".W": "Two components constitute Mo-dependent nitrogenase (EC 1.18.6.1)--the Fe protein (a homodimer encoded by nifH) and the MoFe protein (an alpha 2 beta 2 tetramer encoded by nifDK). The MoFe protein provides the substrate-binding site and probably contains six prosthetic groups of two types--four Fe-S centres and two Fe- and Mo-containing cofactors. To determine the distribution and catalytic function of these metalloclusters, we and others are attempting to change the catalytic and spectroscopic features of nitrogenase by substituting specific amino acids targeted as potential metallocluster ligands, particularly those to the FeMo-cofactor, which is responsible for the biologically unique electron paramagnetic resonance signal (S = 3/2) of nitrogenase, and is believed to be the N2-reducing site. Here we describe mutant strains of Azotobacter vinelandii that have single amino-acid substitutions within the MoFe protein alpha-subunit. These substitutions alter both substrate-reduction properties and the unique electron paramagnetic resonance signal, indicating that the FeMo-cofactor is associated with both the alpha-subunit and the substrate-reducing site.\r"

Here we show that attaching a neutral globular protein, streptavidin, to one end of a single-stranded DNA molecule profoundly alters the DNA mobility pattern and increases the band separation manyfold within a size range controlled by voltage and pulse cycle. In constant field, short modified fragments are only slightly retarded but long molecules are retarded dramatically above a 'threshold size' of 0.6 kilobases at 60 V per cm. At this voltage, molecules above a 1.2-kilobase 'cut-off' do not enter the gel. Both the threshold and the cut-off sizes decrease as the voltage increases. In FIGE, the longer the reverse pulse, the larger the modified fragments that enter the gel. We interpret these results as the trapping by the gel matrix of the protein attached to the DNA. The probability of release then depends on the balance between the electric field and thermal motion: the larger the DNA and the higher the voltage, the harder it is to release.\r"

The LBV group showed gross pallor of the substantia nigra, greater neuron loss in the locus ceruleus, substantia nigra, and substantia innominata, lower neocortical ChAT levels, and fewer midfrontal tangles than did the pure AD group, along with a high incidence of medial temporal lobe spongiform vacuolization. Analysis of neuropsychological tests from 9 LBV subjects and 9 AD patients matched for age and degree of dementia revealed greater deficits in attention, fluency, and visuospatial processing in the LBV group. Similar comparisons of neurologic examinations showed a significant increase in masked facies; in addition there was an increase in essential tremor, bradykinesia, mild neck rigidity, and slowing of rapid alternating movements in the LBV group. Extremity rigidity, flexed posture, resting tremor, or other classic parkinsonian features were not characteristic of the LBV patient. In some cases, it may be possible to diagnose LBV premortem on the basis of the clinical and neuropsychological features.\r"

In normal rats, we measured RINCF sequentially for 4 hours immediately after glucose injection and once after 1, 2, 3, or 4 hours of hyperglycemia. In diabetics, we measured RINCF sequentially for 4 hours after insulin injection. In normal rats, in sequential measurements, RINCF progressively fell but glucose injection prevented this fall. Hyperglycemia without preceding ischemia increased RINCF. In diabetic rats, sequential measurements also produced a decline in RINCF, accentuated with insulin injection. The results suggest that both glucose and insulin are important in determining the response of peripheral nerve to ischemia. They also underscore the importance of knowing the blood glucose and time of most recent insulin injection when measuring RINCF.\r"

While furosemide was effective in 3 patients with renal transplants, administration of corticosteroids to 2 other patients did not halt progressive loss of vision. The visual function of 2 patients deteriorated even after lumboperitoneal shunting. Five patients underwent fenestration of the optic nerve sheath. This procedure improved the visual acuity of 3 patients and stabilized vision in the others.

This dramatic increase of GFAP is not simply reflective of the astrocytic gliosis usually observed near the neurofibrillary tangles and senile plaques but more likely represents an astrocytic reaction in the whole brain corresponding to an overproduction or an accumulation of GFAP. The significance of such an increase is unknown, but it might be a key element in the pathogenesis of AD.\r"

Cognitive disorders were limited in the early-onset PD group compared with their age-matched controls. Conversely, we found global cognitive changes, including marked frontal lobe dysfunction, in the late-onset group. This specific cognitive impairment in older patients related to a significant interaction between the aging and disease processes. Late onset seemed to compound the subtle cognitive changes associated with the disease for which the early-onset group compensated. This compounding effect of aging may explain, at least partially, the high frequency of dementia in older PD patients.\r"

Rates rose sharply in both lands and sexes between 1976 and 1984. Age-specific death rate curves for whites in the 1960s and 1980s were very similar between the countries with a regular male excess. Both countries drastically changed the configuration of all the death rate age curves in parallel fashion between the 2 periods: rates were now nearly twice those of the earlier interval for each sex, age, and race, and were then maximal at age 82 or 85+ as opposed to the prior peak at age 77 or 80. Age-adjusted rates did not consistently reflect this change, being markedly lower for US white females despite their age-specific rate increases. This discrepancy appears to be an artifact of changing population distributions which increasingly differ by age between sexes and countries over time. When the recent age-specific death rates were recalculated with the thesis that all deaths had occurred at ages 5 years younger, all the 1980s death rate configurations returned to those of the 1960s, with but modest increases at most ages. This is evidence that age at death, and thus survival, has increased at all ages by about 5 years since the introduction of levodopa, released in the US in 1970 and in Denmark in 1971.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Effect measurements obtained with each blood sample included tapping and walking speed as well as a global assessment of motor function. Analysis of the data by extended least squares regression for linear, Emax, and sigmoid Emax pharmacodynamic models revealed that linear relationships do not provide the best fit between LD plasma concentrations and clinical effects after controlled-release CD/LD. The data are fit best to models that are curvilinear in nature. LD plasma concentrations greater than 2.0 micrograms/ml resulted in sustained effects on walking and global scores while the greatest rate of change in walking and global scores occurred at 0.9 micrograms/ml. LD plasma concentrations fluctuating around 0.9 micrograms/ml may result in the \"on/off\" effects seen in Parkinson's disease.\r"

All patients localized with subdural electrodes were extratemporal and 3 of the 4 had lesions on imaging studies which helped guide location of electrode placement. Eighty-seven percent of temporal lobe seizures began in hippocampus (recorded by the depth electrode), and 80% were eventually propagated to the ipsilateral temporal neocortex (recorded by the subdural electrode). In 8 patients with bilateral temporal depth and subdural recording, seizures never spread to the contralateral neocortex before the ipsilateral neocortex. Subdural electrodes were 20% less sensitive than depth electrodes in detection of seizures beginning in hippocampus but were accurate when lateralized. Variable or simultaneous unilateral neocortical versus hippocampal temporal lobe seizure onset, determined by the combined study, was significantly correlated with less favorable seizure control after anteromedial temporal lobectomy and hippocampectomy.\r"

The Blessed Dementia Rating Scale (Part 1) correlates well with postmortem changes but is not an effective antemortem index of functional change since disparate behavioral domains are assessed. We performed a factor analysis of the Blessed items in 187 patients with clinically diagnosed Alzheimer's disease and identified 4 independent factors: (I) cognitive, (II) personality, (III) apathy, and (IV) basic self-care. An endpoint, consisting of a score indicative of moderate disability, was determined for each factor. We then used life table analyses to compare the probability of reaching these endpoints over time in longitudinally followed patients. Patients with extrapyramidal signs at their initial visit reached the factor IV endpoint sooner, and those with psychosis or no family history of dementia also reached the factor I endpoint faster. These data illustrate the utility of a multifactorial approach to the assessment of functional capacity in Alzheimer's disease, and also indicate that extrapyramidal symptoms and psychosis are powerful predictors of the rate of decline in basic self-care activities and cognition.\r"

  ".W": "Primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL), an uncommon tumor, is occurring with increasing frequency. Conventional therapy with corticosteroids and cranial radiotherapy (RT) usually gives a dramatic initial response, but median survival is only 10 to 18 months. Chemotherapy is more successful in comparable systemic lymphoma and has been employed for PCNSL at relapse, causing remission but not cure. Between June 1985 and June 1988, we prospectively staged 32 patients with PCNSL at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center and treated 28 on a new protocol that combined chemotherapy and radiotherapy at diagnosis. None had occult systemic lymphoma, but 19% had ocular and 69% had definite or probable leptomeningeal lymphoma. There were no complications in 19 stereotactic biopsies, but 4/10 patients who had a complete resection suffered a severe postoperative deficit. Four patients received RT alone, and 28 received chemotherapy and cranial RT, 17 of whom (group A) received a combination regimen using pre-RT systemic (1 g/m2) and intra-Ommaya methotrexate (MTX), 4,000 cGy whole-brain RT with a 1,440 cGy boost, and 2 courses of post-RT high-dose cytosine arabinoside; 5 other patients received an identical regimen but with a decreased dose of MTX (200 mg/m2). Sixty-three percent of assessable patients had a response to MTX independent of corticosteroid and prior to RT. Eighteen of 26 (69%) assessable patients who received combined therapy are alive with a median follow-up of 25.4 months. Twelve of 16 (75%) assessable group A patients are alive in the same period. Chemotherapy-related toxicity was minimal, and no late toxicities have occurred to date.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The magnitude of change in CBF varied with the neurologic syndrome. CBF was least affected in patients with nonspecific symptoms such as headache or malaise, whereas patients with encephalopathy or psychosis exhibited the greatest reductions in CBF. In 1 patient with affective psychosis, without clinical or CT evidence of cerebral ischemia, serial SPECT studies showed resolution of multifocal cerebral perfusion defects which paralleled clinical recovery.\r"

The Voluntary Review of Quality Care Program allows hospital departments of obstetrics and gynecology to be reviewed, at their own request, by a team of trained reviewers. The Quality Assurance in Obstetrics and Gynecology Manual, published in May 1989, provides clinical indicators and clinical criteria to be used within a department to establish its own quality assurance program. It allows evaluation of a departmental practice; development of physician profiles, department profiles, and practice trends; and identification of educational needs. The planning of these programs is difficult. Setting standards and establishing quality assurance programs carries some risk, but certainly not the risk incurred by hearing, seeing, and doing nothing. We must provide a quality assurance program that changes appropriately and continuously with proven advances in science and technology.\r"

  ".U": "90114819\r", 
  ".W": "Ovarian carcinoma disseminates primarily through the shedding of cells into the peritoneal cavity and subsequent implantation onto peritoneal surfaces. Accurate evaluation of the extent of disease is important both at initial surgical evaluation for staging and at second-look operations to determine the necessity of further therapy. Techniques used for such assessment include node sampling, peritoneal washings, and random biopsies of peritoneal surfaces. Although random biopsies are used by some, others have found them to be of negligible value in the absence of gross disease. The use of cytologic smears of peritoneal surfaces offers a simple method by which cells from a large surface area may be evaluated, and uses equipment readily available to the gynecologist. We compared results of 125 cytologic smears with washings and biopsy specimens obtained during 33 laparotomies for ovarian carcinoma. Cytologic smears identified disease in 48 of 125 sites, whereas biopsy identified only 29 areas of disease. Thirteen of the positive Papanicolaou smears were obtained from clinically disease-free areas. Although the cytologic evaluation of the parietal peritoneal surfaces was more frequently positive than were biopsy specimens, each method identified disease in 16 patients when paired with standard techniques of examination and washing. We conclude that the peritoneal cytologic smear offers an alternative method of further evaluating the extent of disease, particularly when no gross evidence of extraovarian disease is detected.\r"

The possibility of dispersing viral DNA during laser therapy of human papillomavirus (HPV)-containing genital infections was explored using a filter hybridization technique. Samples were taken using dacron swabs from 110 patients in nine separate treatment sessions as well as from five pre-filter canisters, four fume vacuum tubes, and from the nasopharynx, eyelids, and ears of the laser surgeon before and after laser surgery. The viral RNA probes were specific for groups of HPV types 6/11, 16/18, and 31/33/35. Human papillomavirus DNA was identified in swabs from 65 of 110 (60%) of histologically unequivocal condylomata and cervical intraepithelial neoplasias. One of the five pre-filter canisters (20%) tested was HPV DNA-positive after laser treatment of 65 patients; it contained HPV DNA type 6. The four fume vacuum tubes tested in the remaining 45 patients were HPV DNA-negative, as were the nasopharynx, eyelids, and ears of the operator. Although HPV DNA may be released during laser vaporization of genital HPV infections, contamination of the operator is unlikely provided appropriate equipment for evacuating HPV DNA-positive smoke is used.\r"

  ".W": "The rising cesarean birth rate is a matter of national concern, and the goal of clinical obstetricians is to contain this trend while maintaining good maternal and perinatal outcome. Despite published reports suggesting that excellent perinatal outcome can be achieved with modest cesarean birth rates, the general increase of abdominal delivery in the United States appears to continue unabated. An educational approach to modify the community cesarean rate was directed at physicians, nurses, and interested lay groups via presentations in the Denver metropolitan community over a 5-year period. The content of these presentations included management of patients with previous cesarean births, diagnosis and management of fetal distress, the approach to patients with apparent failed progress in labor, indications and strategies for the indicated induction of labor, alternatives in the management of breech presentations and twin deliveries, and identification of patients at risk for genital herpes. The total cesarean birth rate increased to a level of 19.3% in this community in 1986, largely accounted for by the increase in the primary rate to 13.7%. Repeat cesarean birth rates remained relatively stable at 5.6% over the 2-year survey. Hospitals in which resident house officers either managed the entire service or participated in patient care achieved some of the lowest rates of both primary and repeat cesarean birth. Although intellectual arguments for decreasing cesarean births are acknowledged by physicians and nurses alike, translating them into practice on a daily basis is tempered by the constraints of time and the burden of medicolegal concerns. Educational efforts alone, therefore, are likely to produce change only slowly.\r"

We evaluated 63 women with urinary incontinence and 27 continent controls using the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory, Uplift and Hassle Scales, and a structured questionnaire screening sexual dysfunction. All incontinent women underwent diagnostic urodynamic studies including uroflowmetry, subtracted water cystometry with provocation, and urethral closure pressure profilometry. Thirty-five women had genuine stress incontinence and 28 had detrusor instability, including nine with mixed incontinence. No differences in psychological test results were noted between the detrusor-instability and genuine-stress-incontinence groups. On the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory, subjects with detrusor instability scored significantly higher than controls on the hypochondriasis (P = .006), depression (P = .01), and hysteria (P = .0009) scales. Compared with continent controls, the detrusor-instability group reported a lower frequency of uplifts (P less than .05) and a greater intensity of hassles (P less than .05). Both incontinent groups reported more sexual dysfunction than did controls. We conclude that many women with urinary incontinence have abnormal psychological and sexual test results reflecting moodiness, feelings of helplessness and sadness, pessimism, general hypochondriasis/somatization, and sexual dysfunction. These abnormalities appear to be associated with urinary incontinence in general rather than with specific diseases of the urinary tract.\r"

In the same period there were 18,071 live births, giving an overall maternal mortality ratio of 177 per 100,000 live births. Maternal mortality increased from 128 per 100,000 live births in 1978 to 462 per 100,000 in 1987. Abortion-related deaths accounted for 47% of the total mortality, followed by toxemia (19%) and hemorrhage (13%). The contribution of abortion-related mortality to maternal mortality increased 172% over the 10-year period studied. These results indicate that maternal mortality has been increasing in a population of urban poor and that the leading cause of death is induced abortion. In a setting where access to abortion is highly restricted and desire to regulate fertility is high, death due to illegal abortion is a major contributor to maternal mortality. The rise in abortion-related mortality over the past 10 years is attributed to a lack of family planning services in conjunction with urban socioeconomic conditions conducive to smaller families.\r"

A protocol was developed to monitor pregnancies complicated by major blunt abdominal trauma in the third trimester, looking specifically for delayed placental and/or fetal problems. Of the 84 pregnancies studied, the most serious complication was placental abruption. Although abruption occurred in only two cases, one case was associated with a ruptured uterus and fetal death. There were no cases of delayed abruption or delayed fetal compromise. The most common complication was preterm labor, occurring in 28% of cases when the traumatic insult happened before 37 weeks' gestation. Of these 17 patients, 15 were successfully treated with tocolysis. There were no cases of direct fetal injury or Rh-isoimmunization. A revised protocol is recommended for limited outpatient observation with nonstress testing and screening ultrasonography to rule out preterm labor and placental abruption and to document fetal well-being.\r"

During the study period, 73 women who had previously undergone a cesarean for dystocia had a successful trial of labor. We matched each study patient to two controls. One control was nulliparous and the second was a woman who had undergone a previous uncomplicated vaginal delivery. Thirty-six study patients had had a cesarean in the latent phase of labor (group I), 29 in the active phase of labor (group II), and eight in the second stage of labor (group III). With the exception of group I patients, the first and second stages of labor were similar to those of nulliparous control patients. Patients in group I had a significantly longer first stage of labor than did the nulliparous controls. There was no significant difference in oxytocin requirements among the three groups. We conclude that primiparous women who have had a previous cesarean delivery for dystocia have a duration of labor similar in length or longer than that of nulliparous women.\r"

Pilot studies suggested that local anesthesia was as adequate and as safe as general anesthesia. Since 1980, the senior author has performed more than 3000 outpatient laparoscopic tubal sterilizations with the silastic ring under local anesthesia. A retrospective descriptive study was conducted on 2827 cases. The technical failure rate was 0.14%. There were no unintended laparotomies due to complications. The mean operative time was 10.0 +/- 5.1 minutes. The mean anesthesia time was 23.3 +/- 6.9 minutes. The hospital cost for the patient was reduced by 68-85%. This study demonstrates that laparoscopic tubal sterilization can be performed adequately, safely, and quickly under local anesthesia.\r"

To further assess the association between bacterial vaginosis and postpartum endometritis, vaginal Gram smears were obtained from women admitted for delivery. Vaginal smears of women delivered by cesarean were scored as normal or as indicating bacterial vaginosis. Factors related independently to postpartum endometritis by multiple logistic regression analysis included maternal age less than 25 years, any duration of membrane rupture, and bacterial vaginosis. The unadjusted odds ratio for the development of postpartum endometritis associated with bacterial vaginosis (odds ratio = 6.1, 95% confidence interval 3.3-15.9) was not appreciably changed in the multivariable analysis (odds ratio = 5.8, 95% confidence interval 3.0-10.9) after adjusting for maternal age, duration of labor, and duration of membrane rupture. At the time of endometritis, Bacteroides sp, Peptostreptococcus sp, and Gardnerella vaginalis were isolated more frequently from the endometrium using a triple lumen endometrial sampling method among patients with bacterial vaginosis than among those with a normal Gram stain. Bacterial vaginosis appears to be an important risk factor for postpartum endometritis after cesarean delivery.\r"

There has been only sparse description of placental pathology in the third trimester in these fetuses, and therefore the placental role in their growth and development remains unexplored. We performed quantitative morphometric analysis on the placentas of 18 fetuses with trisomy and ten normal control fetuses. Doppler umbilical artery analysis was performed on ten abnormal fetuses and all controls. The placentas of trisomic fetuses exhibited a significant reduction in small muscular artery count and small muscular artery/villus ratio. Abnormal Doppler waveforms correlated closely with reduced small muscular artery counts. Undervascularization and increased vascular resistance of the placenta of trisomic fetuses may contribute to diminished fetal growth. The placenta appears to be another fetal organ whose structure and function are affected adversely by abnormal karyotype.\r"

Twenty-three of the total 53 (43%) had unilateral disease and 30 (57%) had bilateral involvement. Thirty-five of 53 (66%) survived, with 22 undergoing operative therapy postnatally. In all but one of the 35 survivors, the anomaly was isolated to the genitourinary tract, and the majority of surviving fetuses had unilateral disease. Oligohydramnios was present in only three of 35 survivors, and none had severe oligohydramnios. Nine of 53 women underwent termination of pregnancy and nine others experienced a neonatal death. All 18 of their fetuses had bilateral disease, with oligohydramnios present in 14 (78%). All five fetuses with chromosomal abnormalities were found in this group of 18. The majority of fetuses with a genitourinary anomaly will do well postnatally. Pulmonary hypoplasia, extrarenal anomalies, and chromosomal defects are frequent findings in the minority with poor outcomes. A multidisciplinary approach to management of the pregnancy with a fetal genitourinary tract anomaly is essential to optimize outcome.\r"

We hypothesized that improvement of glycemic control from one pregnancy to the other would improve fetal outcome and that deterioration of glycemic control would increase the likelihood of abortion. We studied prospectively 43 insulin-dependent diabetic women (White class B-RF) with two consecutive pregnancies, recruited before 9 weeks' gestation. Preprandial and 90-minute postprandial blood glucose concentrations were measured at each weekly visit. Glycohemoglobin A1 was measured at 9 weeks' gestation. Twenty women had two successful pregnancies and 15 had an abortion followed by a successful pregnancy (abortion-no abortion); the sample sizes for other sequences (no abortion-abortion, N = 5; and abortion-abortion, N = 3) were too small to allow for analysis. Glycohemoglobin A1 concentrations were stable in the sequence no abortion-no abortion (9.7 +/- 0.5 versus 9.8 +/- 0.4%, mean +/- SEM; not significant), whereas in the sequence abortion-no abortion, there was a significant decrease in glycohemoglobin A1 values from the nonsuccessful to the successful pregnancy (10.7 +/- 0.6 versus 9.3 +/- 0.4%; P = .01). Similarly, in the sequence abortion-no abortion, there was a significant decrease in mean postprandial blood glucose from first to second pregnancy (166 +/- 13 versus 135 +/- 11 mg/dL; P = .04), whereas in the sequence no abortion-no abortion, mean postprandial blood glucose did not change significantly (160 +/- 14 versus 144 +/- 11 mg/dL; not significant).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Within this population, we identified those patients with normal-sized ovaries (4 cm or less in maximum diameter) and those with papillary serous histology, exclusive of borderline tumors. The 74 patients so identified were classified as having papillary serous carcinoma of the peritoneum, and form the basis of this report. The average age at diagnosis was 57.4 years. The majority of the patients (90.5%) were white. Common presenting symptoms included abdominal pain (54.9%) and abdominal distention (51.5%). In 89.1% of patients, disease involved the omentum. Clinical response to chemotherapy was seen in 63.6% of the patients; 40.9% of them had partial responses and 22.7% complete responses. At second-look laparotomy, 27.3% of 33 patients demonstrated a surgical complete response, 21.2% had microscopically positive disease only, and 51.1% had grossly positive disease. The median survival for the total group was 24.0 months. Neither patient age nor presence of residual disease after cytoreduction predicted survival. Patients treated with combination chemotherapy fared better than patients treated with single-agent regimens (29.5 versus 16.5 months; P = .01). Patients receiving cisplatin-containing regimens also did better (31.5 versus 19.5 months; P = .02). Among several pathologic characteristics analyzed, only the absence of mitoses predicted improved survival (76.5 versus 21.4-27.0 months; P less than or equal to .05). Papillary serous carcinoma of the peritoneum, though biologically and histologically similar to ovarian carcinoma, is a distinct clinicopathologic entity not uncommonly encountered by the gynecologist.\r"

The condition of the tube relative to the previous surgical management and the resolution of the previous implantation sites were correlated with the recurrent tubal pregnancy. All previous incisions were identified and all were well-healed, except for one fistula. Residual histologic evidence was present in only five of 16 previous implantation sites. The recurrent eccyeses were related to previous surgical management in only three women, two after anastomosis and one because of inadvertent obstruction of the tube. The cases of tubal obstruction and tuboperitoneal fistula formation were thought to reflect a lack of understanding of the pathologic changes associated with tubal pregnancy during conservative surgery. The previous tubal incision sites were all remarkably well-healed regardless of whether they were primarily closed or left open, and independent of location. Infundibular or fimbrial \"milk-outs\" were without histologic evidence of damage. The underlying tubal disease (chronic salpingitis, follicular salpingitis, or salpingitis isthmica nodosa) seems to be the major factor identified that is associated with, and probably the cause for, the recurrent tubal gestation.\r"

We examined the clinical course of 520 patients with endometrial carcinoma treated at Walter Reed Army Medical Center and the Naval Hospital, Bethesda, Maryland, between January 1, 1960 and December 31, 1982. Life table 5-year survivals for stages Ia, Ib, II, III, and IV were 89, 92, 77, 27, and 0%, respectively. Compared with patients with grade 1 endometrial adenocarcinomas, significant decreases in survival were noted for patients with grade 2 or 3 endometrial, papillary endometrioid, serous papillary, and clear-cell tumors. There were six treatment-related deaths (1.2%). Thirty-eight patients (7.3%) developed recurrent disease, with a median time to recurrence of 15 months and a median survival of 21 months. Two of 11 patients with pelvic recurrence were salvaged by radiotherapy, whereas none of 27 patients with distant failure survived. Sixteen advanced-stage patients (3.1%) with persistent disease had a median survival of 4.5 months. Patients with advanced disease or unfavorable histologic subtypes responded poorly to conventional therapy. Current salvage treatments are largely ineffective. Combined-modality therapy and systemic adjuvant therapy should be prospectively evaluated in high-risk patient subgroups.\r"

In an attempt to overcome this disadvantage, we elevated the articular soft tissue cover, shaved the condylar head, and replaced the articular soft tissue cover in its original position in nine adult rabbit temporomandibular joints. On the contralateral joints, the same amount of bone was shaved together with the articular soft tissue cover. The rabbits were killed after 3 months, and the condyles were macroscopically and histologically evaluated. All condyles were covered with an articular soft tissue layer in the area operated on. This surface was smoother when the articular soft tissue cover was preserved. Histologically, the subarticular layer of cartilage cells was continuous in the joints with preservation of the articular soft tissue cover but was frequently interrupted in the joints where this cover was removed. The incision made in the posterior part of the articular surface for elevating the articular soft tissue cover frequently caused a deformity of the condyle and an interruption of the subarticular layer of cartilage. The results suggest that preservation of the articular soft tissue cover on the mandibular condyle might be one way to improve the postoperative morphology after high condylar shave. The technique in its present state has obvious drawbacks and should be further refined before it is considered for clinical application.\r"

New bone of variable form and thickness was observed in 64 joints (the involvement was bilateral in 14 patients). These joints were classified into one of two categories: type I, medially angulated condyle with deformed articular fossa and a mild-to-moderate amount of new bone formation; and type II, no recognizable condyle or fossa but instead a large mass of new bone. Type I was etiology-specific and seen only when trauma was the antecedent, whereas type II was a sequelae of either insult. A pseudofracture in the new bone was seen in 49 (77%) joints. Six joints showed subtle deformities but no new bone. Since coronal CT fully characterizes the lesion at acceptable radiation exposure levels, it appears to be valuable in the preoperative workup of these patients.\r"

  ".W": "A 2-year longitudinal study on signs and symptoms of mandibular dysfunction was performed with 285 17-year-old adolescents living in a certain geographic area in Skelleftea, Sweden. Crepitation was neither reported nor recorded in any subject. Both reports and recordings of TMJ clicking sounds fluctuated with time. The 2-year period prevalence was 24%, and 5.8% consistently reported TMJ clicking sounds. The corresponding figures for clinically recorded clickings were 36% and 9.3%, respectively. Both reported and recorded joint sounds were significantly more frequently found in 19-year-old girls than in boys. No consistent pattern of relationships between reported and recorded clicking sounds and single factors obtained by the questionnaire or clinically recorded variables could be found. Palpation tenderness in three muscle sites was to a varying degree related to both reports and recordings of clicking. Each year, significant relationships were found between reports of TMJ sounds and symptom indices. Recorded sounds were significantly related to a clinical index in the two oldest age groups. The prevalence of TMJ clicking sounds increases with age, and girls are more prone to have them than boys. In view of the natural longitudinal fluctuations, most clickings only need to be supervised, and when there is a demand for treatment, reversible methods are advocated in adolescents.\r"

The majority of the tumors (92.8%) were located in the parotid gland. Two thirds of the patients were female; one third were male. Mean age at primary diagnosis was 55.4 years. The tumors were graded into highly differentiated (76%) or less differentiated forms (24%) according to classic histologic and cytologic criteria. The clinical course was characterized by no recurrence in 15 cases; in 17 cases, recurrences developed, and 12 patients died of their tumor, some as late as 240 months after primary diagnosis. Differentiation showed a weak correlation with the clinical course. In 35 cases, nuclear DNA content of tumor cells was assessed cytochemically. The tumors were \"diploid\" or \"near-diploid\" in 34 cases; DNA content showed no correlation to the clinical course. As a result of long-term follow-up, it becomes evident that acinic cell carcinoma is prone to develop recurrences and metastases. Complete tumor removal during the primary operation seems to be important for controlling the disease inasmuch as the ostensible prognostic predictors evaluated here proved to be unreliable.\r"

Ten of the sixteen patients were dead because of their disease within 4 1/2 years of histologic diagnosis. Cell size and ultrastructural features have little bearing on prognosis. The single most important clinicopathologic factor relating to patient outcome is size of the primary neoplasm. All patients with carcinomas larger than 4 cm died, and these carcinomas had nearly two times the incidence of perineural invasion, extrasalivary extension, and locoregional failure of control.\r"

Recently, a new composition resin (TERM) has been introduced as an interim restoration in endodontics. The purpose of this investigation was to evaluate the efficacy of this resin as an interim restoration and possible effect of access cavity design with respect to its sealing ability compared with other temporary restorative materials. Sixty human teeth were divided into two categories, and two types of access cavities were prepared, namely tapered access with walls divergent toward the occlusal surface and straight access with parallel walls. The prepared teeth from each category were divided into three subgroups of ten each to receive Cavit (group I), IRM (group II), or TERM (group III). After the fillings were placed, the teeth were transferred into a humidor where they stayed for 24 hours. The teeth were then thermocycled. Each group was thermocycled for 2 hours at 1 minute intervals at 60 degrees C and 4 degrees C. Then the teeth were sealed with a compound and coated with two layers of clear varnish, with the exception of cavity margins. Each occlusal surface was immersed in a vial containing silver nitrate. The teeth were sectioned longitudinally, and the degree of dye penetration was evaluated under a dissection microscope according to set criteria. Our findings demonstrated that design of cavity preparation was not a functional parameter in leakage pattern. Results indicated that Cavit had the best sealing ability whereas IRM showed the maximum dye penetration.\r"

Osteoporosis affects approximately 20 million Americans and has been estimated by the National Osteoporosis Foundation to equal $7 to $10 billion in health care costs and productivity annually. Osteoporosis represents a major health problem. Clearly, a screening and bone maintenance program can be managed by nurses in a cost-effective manner and serves as an efficient facilitator in the education and care of patients. Furthermore, an osteoporosis center can provide invaluable support for professionals in various disciplines of medicine. In our experience at The Hospital for Special Surgery most of our patients come to our center as a result of a physician referral. An average of 600 to 800 patients are seen annually and about 15 per cent of these patients are referred from the screening program to a metabolic bone treatment source. Approximately 5 per cent of patients referred for treatment are hospitalized for an extensive evaluation which includes an iliac crest-bone biopsy. As the patient population in the Osteoporosis Center has grown there has been a recognition of special patient groups who have specific needs. This has resulted in the establishment of clinics which address the problems associated with patients who are renal stone formers, anorexic, and amenorheic (many of this latter group are athletes or dancers).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Osteopenia is a significant problem in both thalassemia and sickle cell anemia and may result in vertebral and long bone fractures. Growth disturbances are frequently seen but are not often appreciated until adolescence because of improved hematologic management. The cause of the growth problems is multifactorial and may be related to hormonal deficiencies, iron overload, hypoxia, or local trauma to the growth plate secondary to significant osteopenia.\r"

Our experimental findings implicate TGF-beta as an important regulator of cell proliferation, differentiation, and synthesis of extracellular matrix. Further elucidation of how TGF-beta regulates bone physiology is necessary to improve therapy in pathologic conditions.\r"

Overall, the 326 respondents found the program to have been effective in the areas they deemed appropriate to be taught in residency years. In decreasing order, the chief resident, fellow house officers, and full-time faculty were rated to have had the greatest teaching effectiveness. The women respondents were less likely to be married (76% vs 89%), had fewer children on average (1.2 vs 2.31), missed more work, and were more likely to enter postresidency training (89% vs 78%) than the men. Of all respondents, 73% reported being certain of their career goals during residency and 77% of those reported a reasonable similarity with current positions. More than 93% reported being satisfied with their current careers, and 87% would still choose pediatrics. They are generally well reimbursed financially, with academician salaries matching those of private practitioners 10 years after completing residency and surpassing them, slightly, thereafter. This information provides much food for thought in preparing tomorrow's pediatricians.\r"

The process of care was defined by existing sets of explicit criteria developed for quality assessment. The study was conducted in an urban teaching hospital pediatric primary care clinic. Housestaff were encouraged, but not required, to use the clinic's structured, age-specific forms for recording well-child care. Performance and recording were compared during required well-child visits using the structured form and those using the basic clinic form. Study data from 1031 visits to 68 housestaff during a 14-month period were collected using medical record abstracting of all visits and direct observation of 243 of them. Twenty-three of the providers were assigned randomly to an unobserved control group to assess the effect of observation on recording. Use of the structured form was associated with significantly higher levels of both recorded and observed performance. When performance could be merely checked off to document performance, overdocumentation was found. Record-based estimates of performance were more accurate during visits when the structured form was used. Record format can improve provider performance and recording of the process of care.\r"

This reduction has been termed the \"offset\" effect. Almost all published research concerning offset after mental health treatment concerns adults, and the few studies in pediatric populations are limited by methodologic problems. A study of health care utilization after mental health treatment for children was conducted. Mental health treatment for psychosocial problems was significantly associated with decreased use of medical care only for older children, after potentially confounding variables were controlled for. Furthermore, this decreased use was found only for nonmental health specialty care visits. No reduction in primary care visits occurred. Other factors such as previous patterns of use and the presence of other morbidity were stronger predictors of subsequent primary health care use than was mental health treatment. Mental health treatment does not have a major impact on the high utilization of most children with psychosocial problems in pediatric settings. Because the reasons for this may be particular morbidity patterns in these children, future studies should include some measure of case mix as a potentially important variable in assessment of mental health treatment effects.\r"

Jitteriness was seen in 44% of this sample: 23% were classified as mildly jittery, 8% as moderately jittery, and 13% as extremely jittery. Jitteriness was seen most commonly in infants who were sleepy or active and least commonly in infants who were quietly wakeful during the neonatal examination. Jittery infants were more likely to be difficult to console when crying (P less than .01) and less visually alert (P less than .001) than were nonjittery infants. Jitteriness was seen more commonly in slightly smaller (P less than .05) and shorter (P less than .001) infants, in those more than 12 hours old (P less than .01), and in those not exposed to general anesthesia (P less than .05). In an expanded sample of 1054 healthy and sick full-term infants, jitteriness was observed more commonly in neonates who had been exposed prenatally to maternal marijuana use (P less than .01), but not to cocaine use (P = .1), and whose mothers had a positive postpartum urine assay for marijuana (P less than .05) or cocaine (P = .06). The magnitude of these drug effects, however, was small. These findings have important implications for the early parent-infant relationship, pediatric practice, and future research.\r"

  ".W": "Despite substantial progress, adolescents remain at high risk for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Two independent random digit dial statewide Massachusetts surveys of 16- to 19-year-old persons conducted August through September 1986 and 1988 revealed that the proportion of teenagers who had discussed acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) in schools increased from 52% to 82%. Knowledge about how AIDS is transmitted was also significantly higher in 1988. The proportion of teenagers using drugs other than alcohol and marijuana declined from 13% to 9%, and intravenous drug use declined from 1% to 0.1%. At the same time, among sexually active teenagers, the proportion who reported changes in sexual behavior to avoid AIDS increased from 16% to 34%. The proportion who adopted condom use to avoid AIDS increased from 2% to 19%. However, the overall proportion of teenagers who reported sexual intercourse in the past year increased significantly from 55% to 61%. In 1988, among sexually active teenagers, 37% never used condoms and 33% used them only some of the time. Of all respondents, 18% reported unprotected sex with more than one partner in the previous year, and 3% reported unprotected sex with intravenous drug users. Although mass media and school education may increase knowledge and stimulate some teenagers to change behavior, for others more personal forms of counseling may be needed. The effects of increasing physician counseling warrant special study. Teenagers who had spoken to physicians about AIDS were much more likely to have adopted condom use to avoid HIV exposure. However, although 80% of adolescents saw a physician in the past year, only 13% were counseled about AIDS.\r"

The effect of intrauterine cocaine exposure on cardiac output was studied in 15 full-term newborn infants whose mothers used cocaine during pregnancy. A total of 22 healthy nonexposed full-term infants served as a control group. On the first day of life, cardiac output (183 +/- 12 vs 235 +/- 13 mL/kg per minute, mean +/- SD; P less than .05) and stroke volume (1.3 +/- 0.1 vs 1.9 +/- 0.1 mL/kg, mean +/- SD; P less than .005) were lower and arterial blood pressure (60 +/- 2 vs 41 +/- 2 mmHg, mean +/- SD; P less than .001) higher in the infants exposed to cocaine. On day 2, cardiac output, stroke volume, and mean arterial blood pressure were similar, probably because of the gradual excretion of cocaine and its metabolites by the infant. It was speculated that an increase in plasma norepinephrine levels is responsible for the cardiovascular effects of intrauterine cocaine exposure.\r"

Of 67 children screened before entrance, 13% [corrected] had Giardia lamblia detected in the stool. In addition to carriage of enteric pathogens, the range of pediatric problems encountered included a variety of acute and chronic medical conditions, unmet primary care needs, and developmental and school difficulties. Fifty-eight percent of shelter residents were found to be \"medically homeless.\" Formal liaison between a hospital-based clinic and a family shelter was found to be an effective way to promote a healthy environment in the family shelter and to provide needed medical services to shelter families.\r"

Although the Department of Health and Human Services Regulations for the Protection of Human Subjects require the presentation of specific study information at a level that is easily understood, according to research concerning adult biomedical consent forms, the typical form is not readily comprehensible. Unfortunately, no data exist concerning the readability of informed consent forms that are used in the context of pediatric biomedical research. In the present study, readability analyses were conducted on a large sample (N = 238) of pediatric biomedical informed consent forms obtained during a 10-year period from a large midwestern children's hospital. For the entire sample, results derived from two readability estimates (Fry grade equivalent and Flesch Reading Ease methods) indicated that the consent forms were written at the college graduate level. Although there was a linear increase in the length of the consent document during the 10-year period evaluated, expanded length was not associated with improved readability. According to analyses, a differential pattern of reading difficulty was associated with specific sections of the informed consent document. Findings are highly consistent with those from studies of adult biomedical consent form and document that the purpose of the informed consent form is being compromised, in part, by a readability factor. Suggestions for solving this critical problem are advanced.\r"

To measure this support, an equal probability sample of 795 Sacramento County households with pools was surveyed. An 80% response rate was achieved. A large majority (86%) favored voluntary cardiopulmonary resuscitation training, and a plurality (40%) favored required cardiopulmonary resuscitation certification for pool owners. However, 61% opposed a universal barrier requirement, and 49% objected to a barrier requirement for new pools only. Respondents with small children at home were more likely (P = .0001) to support a required barrier. The previous occurrence of a significant immersion event had surprisingly little effect. The results suggest some specific directions for programs to prevent swimming pool drownings.\r"

Ten animals were assigned to HFFI with a strategy of continuous pulsations at a frequency of 10 Hz and a mean airway pressure of 16 cm H2O. Ten piglets were treated at identical settings except for 10 one-second baseline pauses per minute to a positive end-expiratory pressure of 5 cm H2O. A semiquantitative scoring system was used to grade light microscopic tissue alterations in the trachea, carina, and mainstem bronchi. Ultrastructural changes were evaluated with scanning electron microscopy. The HFFI-continuous-treated piglets had significantly more damage in all areas than the HFFI-baseline pause group (P less than .001). The upper tracheas of animals in both groups were altered to a greater extent than the lower tracheas (P less than .007). In addition, numerous \"skip\" areas of injury were noted throughout the tracheas. High-frequency ventilator strategy is a determinant of the severity of airway histologic changes. Factors that adversely affect tissue oxygenation or cause direct mechanical trauma may also influence the degree of injury. Optimal operating characteristics and limitations of different high-frequency devices must be assessed before their use in human neonates.\r"

Interest in this therapy continues despite a lack of empirical support for its use and its illegality in the United States. In this study, 190 subjects of whom 21 had received cell therapy (from sources external to this study) were studied for 18 variables in the areas of growth, motor development, cognitive development, and adaptive/social status. Comparing the cell-treated group with a control group matched for sex, age, socioeconomic status, and cardiac history showed no statistically significant differences for any of the developmental or growth variables measured. These findings fail to support continued claims of improved functioning following cell therapy in persons with Down syndrome.\r"

Ten recovering malnourished children (ages 13 to 29 months, height-ages 5 to 15 months, weight-ages 3 to 11 months) have now received 90% of their diet energy and 100% of protein and fat from QPM. Energy intake was adjusted to allow them to reach the 50th centile of weight-for-length (according to the National Center for Health Statistics) in 90 days (two completed 60 days only). Growth was compared with that of 10 children receiving modified cow's milk formula (CMF). Energy intakes (QPM 110 +/- 15, CMF 106 +/- 12, corrected for absorption to 94 and 97 kcal/kg.d), crude energy costs of gain (43 +/- 9 and 40 +/- 10, corrected to 37 and 37 kcal/g), linear growth (1.23 +/- 0.24 and 1.33 +/- 0.26 cm/mo), gains in height-age (3.1 +/- 0.7 and 3.3 +/- 1.2 mo), weight gain (2.6 +/- 0.6 and 2.6 +/- 0.8 g/kg.d), and final sums of fat folds (24.3 +/- 3.5 and 27.2 +/- 2.9 mm) were not different. Gains in weight-age were greater (7.5 +/- 2.3 vs 5.4 +/- 1.6 months, P less than .05) and serum albumin decreased (4.10 +/- 0.24 to 3.77 +/- 0.31 g/dL, P less than .01) during QPM feeding. Plasma-free total essential amino acids and ratio of these to total essential amino acids were less after QPM than after CMF diets. Equal growth rates with QPM and CMF diets offer great potential for developing- and developed-country children.\r"

The collections have a variable shape and size and rarely may produce a tension phenomenon elevating the posterior, inferior portion of the heart off of the diaphragm. There was a strong association of retrocardiac pneumomediastinum with other manifestations of extraalveolar air, including pulmonary interstitial emphysema (13 of 14 infants), pneumothorax (10 of 14 infants), dissection of air into the soft tissues of the neck (10 of 14 infants), and pneumoperitoneum (5 of 14 infants).\r"

The knowledge, attitudes, and dietary behavior of parents of compliant patients were compared with those of noncompliant patients. Parents of compliant patients are better educated and from a higher social class. Although objective knowledge of the disease is similar in both groups, parents of compliant patients consider themselves adequately informed about the disease and are better able to choose gluten-free items from a menu. Parents of compliant patients are less worried about health in general but are more concerned with possible adverse effects celiac disease might have on the future of their children. Parents of both groups are not significantly different with regard to their understanding of the diet, the tendency to use medical care, and the perception of barriers to compliance or social support. It was concluded that to increase dietary compliance in celiac patients, parents should be guided mainly by the following three purposes: (1) enhancing their subjective evaluation of their own knowledge of celiac disease; (2) improving their practical ability to handle a menu; (3) increasing their anxiety regarding possible long-term adverse effects.\r"

The critical incident technique, a method widely accepted in industrial settings, was used in this study to determine attitudes and behaviors deemed critical for successful performance of residents in a pediatric training program. Structured interviews with 17 senior teaching faculty produced descriptions of resident behavior that were classified into the following mutually exclusive categories: commitment to learning, clinical judgment, communicating medical information, recognition of limits, professional behavior, interpersonal skills with patients, and dealing with emergency situations. Only 30% of the critical incidents obtained from the faculty were related to criteria traditionally used to select and evaluate residents, such as knowledge and technical skills, while the remaining incidents were noncognitive in nature. The results of this study have implications for the evaluation and selection of residents and suggest that pediatric program directors and faculty must give attention to the means by which noncognitive skills are fostered in residents.\r"

To determine the possible effects of these cutbacks on pediatric manpower, a country-wide study was conducted to assess the practice patterns and productivity of Canadian pediatricians. Of the 1960 pediatricians in Canada, 69% completed and returned our questionnaire. Practice descriptions were as follows: 37% practice primary, 25% secondary, and 38% tertiary care. A total of 70% of Canadian pediatricians are men, although this will change with time because 49% of pediatricians younger than 35 years of age are women. Clinical productivity was assessed by five indices: number of clinical hours, patients seen, consultations provided, and hours on call per week, and number of hospital admissions per year. Younger pediatricians were significantly less clinically productive than older pediatricians. Age-matched groups of female pediatricians were significantly less clinically productive than their male counterparts in three of the five indices assessed. Overall, female pediatricians were significantly more likely to work part-time than were male pediatricians (22% vs 16%, P less than .05). When the clinical productivity of part-time pediatricians was assessed, there was no male to female difference noted. However, among full-time pediatricians, men worked significantly more clinical hours per week and saw significantly more patients than did women (P less than .05). According to results, women pediatricians were more satisfied with their practice now than when starting practice than were men (47% vs 41%).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

All of these smoking-associated changes are in the same direction as those found in adults, with the exception of total cholesterol levels, which are significantly increased in adult smokers. The extent to which mean triglyceride, LDL-cholesterol, and HDL-cholesterol levels are shifted is significantly greater in the 8- to 19-year-old smokers than in adult smokers. The changes in mean total cholesterol levels among smokers in both age groups represent only the net shifts in the lipoprotein fractions and are therefore likely to be a less sensitive indicator of the possible lipid-related excess coronary artery disease risk in smokers.\r"

  ".W": "Forty-six (92%) outborn and four (8%) inborn term or near-term neonates were admitted for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) treatment to a neonatal intensive care unit between July 1, 1985, and November 1, 1987. All infants had PAO2-PaO2 greater than or equal to 600 mm Hg in spite of aggressive conventional ventilatory and pharmacologic therapy. All patients were offered rescue treatment with high-frequency oscillatory ventilation (HFOV), and only if there was no improvement in PAO2-PaO2 with HFOV were infants treated using ECMO. Four patients died before receiving an adequate trial of HFOV and before emergency ECMO support could be initiated; 21 patients, all of whom survived to hospital discharge, responded to HFOV; 25 patients ultimately required ECMO therapy for cardiopulmonary support, with 22 (88%) surviving to discharge. Neonates responding to HFOV were of slightly younger gestational age (38 +/- 2 weeks vs 40 +/- 2 weeks, mean +/- SD; P less than .001) and more frequently had clinical evidence of pneumonia (11 of 21 vs 2 of 25; P less than .002). There was no statistically significant difference in outcome with respect to the number of ventilator days, hospital days, or survival between patients responding to HFOV and patients who required ECMO. Morbidity was increased in ECMO patients, with bleeding abnormalities, seizures, and renal failure occurring more frequently than in HFOV-treated infants. Overall, 92% (46 of 50) of the patients were treated with a staged protocol using HFOV before ECMO. A total of 46% (21 of 46) responded to HFOV treatment alone and did not require ECMO therapy.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Cerebral blood flow, plasma epinephrine, and plasma norepinephrine were measured in 25 spontaneously breathing, preterm neonates (mean gestational age 30.4 weeks) 2 hours after birth, during a routine screening for low blood glucose levels. Increased cerebral blood flow and plasma epinephrine values were observed when blood glucose levels were low, whereas plasma norepinephrine was constant throughout the blood glucose range. Hypoglycemia (defined as blood glucose concentration less than 30 mg/dL) was found in 13 neonates who were treated with intravenous glucose and milk enterally. Blood glucose levels were normal in the remaining 12 control neonates who received milk by a gastric line. Approximately 30 minutes after treatment with intravenous glucose and/or milk, cerebral blood flow had decreased by a mean of 11.3% in the 13 hypoglycemic neonates but was still 37.5% higher than cerebral blood flow in the control neonates despite normalization of plasma epinephrine concentration. Mean arterial blood pressure and blood gas values were identical between groups throughout the investigation. It is suggested that a normal coupling between cerebral metabolic demands and flow is present in very preterm neonates and that epinephrine may play a role in the cerebral hyperperfusion. Although none of the neonates had clinical signs of hypoglycemia, the data suggest that counterregulatory mechanisms are invoked when blood glucose values are less than 30 to 45 mg/dL.\r"

A total of 172 girls who were examined by three techniques during their evaluation in a clinic for suspected child sexual abuse victims were studied. Their ages ranged from 10 months to 11 years with a mean of 5 years, 8 months. The examination techniques used were the supine position with labial separation, the supine position with labial traction, and the knee-chest position. The knee-chest position (98%) and the supine traction method (96%) proved to be superior to the supine separation technique (86%) in opening the vaginal introitus. The largest vertical transhymenal diameters were produced in the knee-chest position, whereas the greatest transverse horizontal spans were generated by the supine traction procedure. Other soft tissue changes were noted but not quantified. A multimethod approach to the examination of the sexually abused child is recommended to take advantage of the strengths of each technique.\r"

  ".W": "To evaluate the impact of measles vaccination on survival of children residing in a periurban slum in Haiti, a total-population survey was conducted 2.5 years after completion of a one-time study of the serologic response to measles vaccine administered in the same population. Pregnancy histories from the 16,400 women in the population revealed that 1499 children had been born during a 7-month interval that would have made them eligible for participation in the measles vaccine program. Of these children, 1381 (92.1%) survived to 9 months of age, the median age that measles vaccine had been administered. Seventy-three infants had died between 9 and 39 months of age. Mortality of infants who were seronegative before receiving measles vaccine was significantly lower (P = .0013) than that of unvaccinated infants (3/235 vs 70/1056, respectively). Other factors positively associated with survival between 9 and 39 months of age included socioeconomic status (P = .0002), maternal literacy (P = .0020), maternal knowledge and use of oral rehydration solution (P = .0002), and an interval of greater than 24 months to the birth of the next younger sibling (P = .0012). Multivariate stepwise logistic regression analysis was used to evaluate the independent association of measles vaccination by adjusting for other factors that also correlated with survival and that might have been associated with maternal seeking of vaccinations.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The value of prenatal care has been obscured by multiple factors, including the limitations of birth certificate data, large socioeconomic disparities between women who seek prenatal care and those who do not, and the \"preterm delivery bias\", ie, the reduced pregnancy duration and opportunity for prenatal care among women who give birth prematurely. Perinatal mortality and morbidity (neonatal intensive care unit admission; ventilator therapy) were carefully assessed in an indigent population (28,838 deliveries at Parkland Memorial Hospital). To avoid the preterm delivery bias, a cohort of all women whose pregnancy reached a specific week of gestation was identified and their prenatal care status (zero vs one or more visits) by that week was related to pregnancy outcome. Separate cohorts were defined at 26, 30, 34, 38, and 42 weeks. Prenatal care was associated with improved pregnancy outcomes in only the 34-, 38-, and 42-week cohorts (P less than .01). Findings suggest substantial benefit from prenatal care after 30 weeks' gestation but not from early prenatal care. Unfortunately, it may not be possible to assess prenatal care accurately in observational studies even if cohort analyses are used. Clinical trials are needed to assess the effects of strategies for increasing or improving prenatal care, especially in early pregnancy.\r"

  ".W": "Narcolepsy is rarely diagnosed in preteenaged children. Its clinical and polysomnographic manifestations, some of which are unusual, are described in four children who were observed prospectively. The mean age at onset of hypersomnia was 10.2 years (range 8.4 to 11.2 years). Daytime naps among these children were lengthy, ranging from 20 to 120 minutes, and generally were considered unrefreshing. Cataplexy was present at the onset in all four children. Three of the four children were obese, with the concurrent nocturnal snoring prompting a misleading concern about obstructive sleep apnea syndrome in two children. The histocompatibility DR2 antigen was present in all four children. Significant behavioral manifestations appeared in all of them. The response to stimulant medications was, at best, modest. Narcolepsy may be difficult to diagnose in this age group. However, a careful history eliciting sleep/wake dysfunction (including cataplexy), leukocyte assays for the histocompatibility DR2 antigen, and serial polysomnographic studies may enable early recognition and treatment of this disease.\r"

  ".W": "The possibility of transmission of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) from infected children to their contacts has been confronted in households, schools, day-care centers, and other child care settings. Cases reported to the Centers for Disease Control and several studies of close contacts of HIV-infected patients suggested that the risk of transmission in these settings is extremely low. However, most of these studies involved infected adults or older children. Younger children, who drool, bite, mouth toys, and are incontinent, may be more likely to transmit HIV in these settings. To assess this possibility, the authors tested 89 members of households in which 25 children with HIV infection, most of whom were preschool-aged, resided. Household members had close personal contact with the infected children. They shared many items likely to be soiled with blood and body fluids, such as toys, toothbrushes, eating utensils, toilets, and bathtubs. Hugging, kissing, sharing a bed, and bathing together were common. Household members were tested no sooner than 4 months after initial contact with the infected child, to allow adequate time for sero-conversion. All 89 participating household members were anti-HIV seronegative, and 78 who were tested were serum p24 antigen negative. It was concluded from this study and other evidence that the risk of transmission from children to their contacts is extremely low and has not been clearly documented in the household setting.\r"
