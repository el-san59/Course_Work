Forty women, at a mean (+/- SD) of 37 +/- 2 weeks' gestation, were randomized to receive (N = 10 each) placebo or 20, 60, or 80 mg of aspirin per day until delivery. Maternal serum 6-keto-PGF1 alpha levels were not affected by these doses of aspirin, whereas thromboxane B2 generated during clotting of maternal blood was decreased significantly by 60 and 80 mg of aspirin by 1 week of therapy. Maternal platelet thromboxane B2 production in response to adenosine diphosphate or collagen was reduced 98% by the 80-mg dose after 1 week of aspirin therapy. The 60-mg dose reduced maternal platelet thromboxane B2 production in response to adenosine diphosphate (50% decrease) or collagen (60% decrease) after 1 week of treatment, a nonsignificant difference. After 2 weeks of treatment with 60 mg of aspirin, platelet thromboxane B2 production induced by both collagen and adenosine diphosphate was inhibited significantly (P less than .01). Neonatal serum levels of 6-keto-PGF1 alpha and thromboxane B2 were not affected by any doses of aspirin. Further, neonatal platelet aggregation in response to platelet stimulation by collagen and adenosine diphosphate was not inhibited. All neonates had echocardiographic evidence of a patent ductus arteriosus, and noninvasive estimates of pulmonary arterial pressure were similar among the groups of infants.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

After educational counseling regarding HIV infection, 349 clinic patients (34%) requested non-anonymous HIV testing (group I). Risk factor histories were recorded from these women. Simultaneously, 849 women admitted to labor and delivery were queried with regard to the same risk factors but without preliminary counseling, and then tested anonymously (group II). Nineteen percent (63 of 349) of group I reported risk factors, whereas only 9.6% (82 of 849) of group II reported similar risks (P less than .0001). Two HIV-positive patients were identified in group I, both of whom reported risk factors (seroprevalence 0.6%). Nine HIV-positive patients were detected in group II, but only four reported risk factors (seroprevalence 1.1%). We conclude that methodical counseling may elicit increased reporting of HIV risk factors as compared with questioning without preliminary counseling. Because many HIV-positive patients may be unable or unwilling to report risk factors, selective voluntary testing will not identify all HIV-positive gravidas.\r"

  ".U": "90015963\r", 
  ".W": "The etiology of postpartum eclampsia and hypertension remains controversial. Recent reports have suggested a possible idiosyncratic hypertensive reaction associated with the use of bromocriptine mesylate. The purpose of this study was to determine whether bromocriptine, used for lactation suppression, is a risk factor for postpartum hypertension. In 1813 consecutively delivered staff patients, blood pressures at three separate home visits were obtained between 3-21 days postpartum. Postpartum hypertension, defined for the purposes of this study as systolic pressure of 140 mmHg or greater and/or diastolic pressure of 90 mmHg or greater on any of the three home visits, was the dependent variable; bromocriptine exposure was the independent variable. Covariates included age, race, chronic hypertension, pregnancy-induced hypertension, and antihypertensive medication. Discriminant analysis, including the first-order interactions, revealed that race, history of chronic hypertension, pregnancy-induced hypertension, and antihypertensive medication contributed significantly to postpartum hypertension (F (7, 1803) = 107.9; P less than .001, explained variance 30%). Of all the interaction terms, only the bromocriptine by pregnancy-induced hypertension interaction was significant. These findings support the contention that patients with antepartum pregnancy-induced hypertension who receive bromocriptine for lactation suppression are at increased risk for postpartum hypertension. Avoiding the elective use of this drug in patients with pregnancy-induced hypertension might constitute a reasonable clinical response to these findings.\r"

Women with a low rate of gain were more than twice as likely to experience a preterm delivery as those with a high gain (higher than 0.52 kg/week); the odds ratio was 2.54 and 95% confidence interval was 1.49, 4.88.

The only predictions consistently correct before monitoring information was available were those regarding infant survival (88% correct, kappa [kappa] = 0.40, P less than .001 for the electronic fetal monitoring group; 80% correct, kappa = 0.35, P less than .01 for the periodic auscultation group). After monitoring, predictions of 5-minute Apgar scores and arterial cord pH were significantly more accurate, and clinicians' confidence in their predictions increased significantly in both the electronic fetal monitoring and the auscultation groups. Predictions of 5-minute Apgar scores were significantly more accurate in the electronic fetal monitoring group (92% correct, kappa = 0.80) than in the periodic auscultation group (61% correct, kappa = 0.28) (Z difference = 3.04; P less than .01). We conclude that clinicians gain information during intrapartum monitoring that generally leads to improved predictions and increased confidence in predictions. In this study, they made more accurate predictions about 5-minute Apgar scores with electronic fetal monitoring, suggesting that electronic fetal monitoring may provide better information about neonatal well-being than does periodic auscultation. Improved information, as measured by clinical predictions, is probably highly valued by patients and clinicians and may be an important determinant of acceptance of this diagnostic technology.\r"

The serum concentration of placental isoferritin in women with preterm contractions (15.3 +/- 6.2 U/mL) was significantly lower than that in normal pregnant women (87.6 +/- 22.6 U/mL) (P = .005). The level of normal ferritin in women with preterm contractions (30.6 +/- 4.16 ng/ml) was lower than that in women with normal pregnancies (67 +/- 9.6 ng/mL) (P = .01); however, both were within the normal range. Serum placental isoferritin levels correlated with pregnancy outcome; low placental isoferritin (up to 10 U/mL) was a sensitive (71.5%) indicator of preterm labor. Low placental isoferritin had a positive predictive value of 59% and a negative predictive value of 71%. These results suggest that placental isoferritin may serve as a predictive marker for the prognosis of preterm contractions.\r"

The analgesics were rated equivalent in efficacy. Maternal nausea, vomiting, and prolonged sedation occurred more frequently in the meperidine group. Naloxone use was significantly less in fentanyl- than in meperidine-exposed infants (one of 49 versus seven of 56; P less than .05). Neuroadaptive testing at approximately 2 hours and 24 hours postnatally revealed similar averaged scores in the two groups. Using the described intravenous dosing schedule, fentanyl was preferable to meperidine during labor because there was no prolonged maternal sedation or vomiting necessitating therapy and the requirement for neonatal naloxone was reduced.\r"

In four of the five cases, the ratio of acetylcholinesterase to pseudocholinesterase was compatible with that observed in association with open neural tube defects in later gestation. In contrast, no false-positive results were noted among 951 acetylcholinesterase determinations performed on samples from women at 15-20 weeks' gestation. Repeat amniocentesis was performed several weeks after the first procedure in four of the five cases of early amniocentesis and false-positive results; in each case, the acetylcholinesterase was negative on the second sample. All four pregnancies had a normal outcome. In the remaining case, trisomy 21 was diagnosed in the fetus and the pregnancy was terminated. Positive acetylcholinesterase results should be interpreted cautiously in samples from early amniocentesis, especially when the amniotic fluid alpha-fetoprotein level is not markedly elevated. The acetylcholinesterase-to-pseudocholinesterase ratio is not useful in identifying fetal neural tube defects before 15 weeks' gestation. Repeat amniocentesis may help in determining the significance of a positive acetylcholinesterase result from early amniocentesis when no fetal defect is identified by ultrasonography.\r"

It included probable, suspected, unknown, and probably negative teratogenic or embryotoxic drugs and chemical compounds. For each of 175 substances, we recorded the results of any developmental toxicity testing in up to 14 animal species and any reports of mutagenicity or carcinogenicity. Logistic regression and discriminant analysis were used to predict a compound's effect in humans. A measure of the number of positive animal studies and bacterial mutagenicity were important predictors in both models, as were the specific results in hamsters and subhuman primates. The fact that a compound had been tested at all in subhuman primates was more important in predicting human risk than was the result itself. The methods used correctly classified the study compounds 63-91% of the time, depending upon how the suspicious and unknown compounds were treated. The models had a sensitivity of 62-75%, a positive predictive value of 75-100%, and a negative predictive value of 64-91%. These findings imply that studies in laboratory animals carry weight in predicting human developmental toxicity. The more animal species in which a compound is positive, the more likely it is to have a human effect, albeit not the same effect as in the animals. Clinicians should not ignore developmental toxicity tests in animals \"because laboratory rats are not like humans.\"\r"

  ".W": "To study the usefulness of mifepristone for outpatient abortion induction, we administered 600 mg of mifepristone in a single dose to 50 women exhibiting delay of menses of between 4-15 days. All but two started to bleed within 1-3 days after mifepristone. This treatment resulted in complete abortion (uterine cavity empty by ultrasonography; hCG levels less than 30 IU/L) in 36 women. Pregnancy was terminated but the uterus retained placental fragments in eight women, and pregnancy continued normally in five women (10%). One woman with a fibromyoma required emergency curettage 2 days after mifepristone. Necrotic decidua was seen on histopathologic examination of the endometrial samples. In the whole series, we saw no changes in blood hemoglobin or hematocrit values, and all the women could continue their routine activities during the procedure. Thus, although a single dose of mifepristone is an effective abortifacient, it is not potent enough to be used in routine clinical practice for outpatient pregnancy termination.\r"

In addition, the content of soluble insulin-like growth factor binding protein (IGF-BP/PP12) was measured in the tissue cytosols. Cell membrane preparations of myoma tissue bound significantly more insulin-like growth factor I than did those of adjacent normal myometrium, whereas myoma tissue bound less epidermal growth factor than did the normal myometrium. The differences in both insulin-like growth factor I and epidermal growth factor binding were due to changes in receptor concentration rather than to alterations in receptor affinity. Neither myoma nor myometrial tissue contained detectable levels of insulin-like growth factor binding protein. The changes in epidermal growth factor and insulin-like growth factor I binding to the myometrium may play a role in the pathogenesis of uterine leiomyomata.\r"

We used a murine ovarian teratocarcinoma in C3HeB/FeJ mice to evaluate these drugs for synergy in vivo. Several dose-response schedules and various sequences were tested to determine the optimal delivery schedule. Survival of control mice injected with 10(4) murine ovarian teratocarcinoma was 28 days. Tumor-bearing mice treated with intraperitoneal cisplatin alone had significantly prolonged survival, whereas intraperitoneal cytosine arabinoside alone did not prolong survival. Repeated doses of cytosine arabinoside every 24 hours for 4 days resulted in minimal prolongation of survival. Simultaneous one-time administration of cisplatin and cytosine arabinoside resulted in synergy as measured by survival, with 50% of mice surviving at 80 days. Combined simultaneous administration of cisplatin and cytosine arabinoside daily for 3 days resulted in 100% survival at 120 days. Both cisplatin and cytosine arabinoside have an outstanding pharmacokinetic advantage when given intraperitoneally. A clinical trial of these drugs with a 3-day schedule is warranted.\r"

  ".W": "Genital tract lesions were analyzed for human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA by in situ hybridization using probes of HPVs 6/11, 16/18, and 31/33/35. All of the HPVs detected in vulvar and perianal condylomata by in situ hybridization were HPV 6/11-related, whereas the majority of HPVs detected in cervical intraepithelial grade I lesions were types 16/18- and 31/33/35-related. None of the lesions with histologic features equivocal for HPV infection had detectable HPV DNA by in situ hybridization, though some did contain HPV DNA sequences as ascertained by filter hybridization analysis. The sensitivity of in situ hybridization was compared with that of filter hybridization (slot blot and/or Southern blot). The correlation was high (28 of 30) for cases that contained HPVs 6/11 or 16, as deduced by filter hybridization, and was much less (ten of 29) for cases that contained HPVs distinct from types in the filter hybridization probe cocktail (HPVs 6/11, 16, 18, 31, 35 and 51). There was a high concordance between the results of Southern blot hybridization and slot blot hybridization analyses, especially with cases that contained HPVs 6/11 and 16. In situ hybridization, slot blot, and Southern blot hybridization analyses are all very effective in detecting the common HPV types (HPVs 6/11 or 16). In situ hybridization is useful in differentiating cervical lesions that contain HPV 6/11 from those that contain HPV 16 or other types with oncogenic potential. However, filter hybridization is superior to in situ hybridization when analyzing cases with histologic findings equivocal for HPV infection or cases that contain HPV types related to, but distinct from, the types included in the probe.\r"

Further analysis showed no increased ER risk to the first eye after the second eye's PK in the bilateral PK group.

After PKP, all patients had clear grafts and 20/40 or better visual acuity. Average follow-up was 17 months. Three of the 22 patients (13.6%) had graft reaction episodes, all of which were treated successfully, resulting in clear grafts.

In group 1 (10 eyes), the central epithelium was removed by mechanical scrubbing to ablate the anterior stroma. In group 2 (10 eyes), a central anterior corneal cap was removed to ablate the midstroma. In group 1, epithelial wound healing occurred in 2 to 3 days. A mild anterior haze was observed with the slit lamp, but it gradually cleared in most eyes of both groups. Histologic specimens were obtained immediately and at 2 and 6 months after ablation for light and transmission and scanning electron microscopy. This acute histopathologic study did not show any endothelial damage even after ablations at 300-microns depth, although there was thermal damage more prominent at the borders of the ablated area for an extension of 40 microns. After 2 months, in the group 1 eyes, the regenerated epithelium appeared normal except for a thickening at the margins of the ablated area. Six months postoperatively there was still epithelial thickening at the margins of the remodeled zone. The basement membrane was present with anchoring filaments and hemidesmosomes. The healing of the anterior (group 1) and midstroma (group 2) occurred with some degree of disorganization of the lamellae and an increase in the population of keratocytes. The density of keratocytes at the ablated areas at 6 months was reduced in comparison with the 2-month observation. By photokeratoscopy, the corneas were smooth and slightly flattened. The authors conclude that corneal ablation using an ER: YAG laser at 2.9 microns may meet the criteria for photorefractive keratectomy (PRK).\r"

Tear film osmolarity was increased throughout the observation period. Conjunctival goblet cell density and corneal epithelial glycogen levels declined progressively.

Corneal scrapings from 18 patients with culture-proven keratomycosis and deparaffinized histopathologic specimens from five culture-proven cases of acanthamoebic keratitis were evaluated. The F-ConA provided consistently bright staining of the mycotic structures in each of the corneal scrapings. Both F-ConA and F-WGA stained acanthamoebic trophozoites and cysts in the histopathologic specimens. In both the corneal scrapings and the histopathologic specimens, the microorganisms were easily differentiated from background corneal cells and tissue. These staining patterns correlate well with the results from experimental studies, and with the known cell wall carbohydrate compositions for fungi and acanthamoebae. This study provides further evidence that FCLs (particularly F-ConA) may eventually become effective first-line stains for the visualization of microorganisms in specimens from ocular infections.\r"

Advanced stages of trachoma were present in all individuals. Climatic droplet keratopathy (CDK) was also observed clinically in 19 patients. Histopathologically, the Congo red-positive, birefringent and dichroic amyloid deposits in the stroma were similar to that of lattice corneal dystrophy. Bowman's membrane was mostly absent, and peculiar microcystoid degeneration of the stroma was noted. Electron microscopic studies not only confirmed the diagnosis of amyloid but also showed a more diffuse amyloid pattern than did light microscopy. Trachoma is probably the cause of this corneal degeneration with secondary amyloidosis. The environmental conditions associated with CDK may be contributing factors in some cases.\r"

To assess the etiology and epidemiology of acute conjunctivitis in this population, conjunctival scrapings were sampled from 45 patients presenting to an ocular emergency room; and replicate chlamydial, viral, and bacterial cultures and cytology tests were done. No cases of chlamydial conjunctivitis were diagnosed, although a viral etiology was established in 36% of the cases and a bacterial etiology in 40%. Twenty-four percent of the cases were not diagnosed. The authors recommend limiting the initial laboratory workup of patients with acute conjunctivitis to obtaining conjunctival smears for Gram and Giemsa staining. Chlamydial direct immunofluorescent monoclonal antibody (DFA) should be done if the patient is sexually active. Hyperacute conjunctivitis or acute conjunctivitis refractory to treatment mandates a more complete set of laboratory tests.\r"

Taking into account the size of the optic nerve, the common 38-mm (1.5-in) retrobulbar needle could perforate the optic nerve where it is fixed in front of the foramen in over 11% of the population. The authors recommend that needles be placed less than 31 mm (1.25 in) behind the orbital rim for both retro- and peribulbar anesthesia.\r"

  ".W": "Vitreous loss is a serious complication of cataract surgery. It has been suggested that high rates of vitreous loss may be an inevitable consequence when residents are learning extracapsular cataract extraction (ECCE). The authors retrospectively analyzed all (n = 936) cataract operations done by second- and third-year residents in a single Veterans Administration hospital from 1982 through 1988. Between 1982 and 1985, the incidence of vitreous loss was 10.3%. In 1985, a new program of resident surgical education was introduced, and the incidence from 1985 through 1988 declined to 3.2% (P less than 0.001). Statistical analysis confirms that this decrease cannot be attributed to any individual surgeon, class of residents, or year of surgery. The authors believe that an educational program including practice surgery, graded responsibility, and experienced assistance may be responsible in part for dramatically reducing the rate of this serious complication during surgery done by the beginning resident.\r"

  ".U": "90016097\r", 
  ".W": "The incidence of pupillary fibrin membrane formation, a relatively frequent complication of cataract surgery in Japan even for experienced surgeons, was noted in 2038 consecutive cases of senile cataract removal and primary posterior chamber intraocular lens (PC IOL) implantation. The overall incidence was 4.4%. Comparisons among cases showed the incidence to be significantly higher among: (1) patients who received dry- versus wet-sterilized lenses (P less than 0.001), (2) eyes with premature, subcapsular, or nuclear cataracts than among those with mature cataracts (P less than 0.05), (3) patients with systemic hypertension (P less than 0.01), (4) eyes not treated postsurgically with topical antiprostaglandins (P less than 0.001), and (5) patients who had undergone previous PC IOL implantation in the fellow eye (P less than 0.001). These findings suggest that the formation of the fibrin membrane is a kind of immunologic reaction. Accordingly, use of antiprostaglandin agents and complete removal of lens material and epithelial cells are recommended, especially for patients undergoing second-eye operations or those with a predisposition to breakdown of the blood-aqueous barrier.\r"

These IOLs were implanted as exchange procedures. In most instances, the loops were not situated in the ciliary sulcus but rather were suspended behind the iris and ciliary body. Therefore, the primary mechanism of fixation of iris-sutured PC IOLs appears to be the sutures themselves rather than adherence to the ciliary tissues. This report of four eyes is preliminary, but the pathologic analysis, showing few significant lesions attributable to the IOL, provides a reason for optimism for using this technique. A long-term clinical study comparing the results of sutured PC IOLs with those of anterior chamber IOLs (AC IOLs) used in secondary or exchange implantation, as well as collection and analysis of more pathologic specimens, should provide a more definitive answer as to the preferred procedure.\r"

Although rare in children, it is the most common \"malignant\" salivary gland tumor, having been reported in major and minor (intraoral) salivary gland sites as well as in the maxilla and the mandible. In children, as in adults, it most often occurs in the parotid gland, but a significant percentage is found in the palate and retromolar pad area. Presently, there is no unanimity of opinion about whether to consider all mucoepidermoid tumors malignant or what the most appropriate treatment regimen is. The following is a case report of a mucoepidermoid tumor presumably arising from the reduced enamel epithelium in soft tissue overlying an erupting mandibular second molar in an 11-year-old boy. Theoretical origins of intraoral soft tissue mucoepidermoid tumors are discussed, as well as treatment philosophy. The importance of submitting, for microscopic diagnosis, all tissue removed during surgical procedure is illustrated in this case report.\r"

It was observed that dry throat, blurred vision, dry eyes, dry skin, and vaginal itching and fungal infections are prominently associated with oral dryness. These nonoral symptoms were positively correlated with the oral symptoms cited in part I of this study and were inversely related to the flow of resting, but not stimulated, whole saliva. Several classes of drugs were associated with dry mouth. In addition, diabetes mellitus and hypertension were significantly associated with it. Approximately half of the diabetic and hypertensive patients complained of dry mouth. Although a majority of them were taking medications, the association between xerostomia and these diseases cannot be completely attributed to drugs, since many of these patients did not take any xerogenic medicaments. The data show that xerostomia and several other oral symptoms are valid indicators of salivary gland hypofunction. They suggest, moreover, that select nonoral symptoms are an indicator of generalized xerosis.\r"

A complete lack of closure of the calcified tissues along the groove, allowing for direct connection of the pulp and the periodontium, was not found in these specimens. Therefore, it is suggested that accessory canals are the main way of communication between the pulp and the periodontium of the incisors with a radicular lingual groove. Because the accessory canals could be found either in the crown part or in the root part of the groove, infectious materials may get into the pulp cavity when there are pathologic conditions either through accessory foramina in the crown part or through accessory foramina exposed by localized periodontitis around the groove.\r"

Use of the minimum irradiated volume technique resulted in a significantly decreased absorbed dose over the entire thyroid region ranging from 100% to 350% (p less than 0.05).

  ".U": "90016175\r", 
  ".W": "A three-dimensional computer simulation of the basilar crescentic osteotomy has been presented. The bunion deformity consists of hallux valgus, an increased first and second intermetatarsal angle, pronation of the great toe, and elevation of the first metatarsal head. Every foot is different and some may have more or less of each of the above noted components. Because the deformity is multiplanar, at least two roentgenograms are needed to evaluate the deformity. The weight-bearing, anterior-posterior roentgenogram is the principle radiograph used in preoperative planning. The use of a weight-bearing, sesamoid roentgenogram is recommended to quantify the anterior-posterior deflection and rotation of the first metatarsal head. A computer model (based on a cylinder) of the first metatarsal has been formulated. The osteotomy then was performed in a variety of scenarios in order to simulate the surgical correction. A great deal of flexibility is afforded by this osteotomy. The surgeon needs to be aware of the coupled motions that occur. That is, closure of the intermetatarsal angle may also cause head rotation, depression, or elevation. If the osteotomy is performed in an oblique multiplanar direction, then it is possible for the metatarsal head to elevate, pronate, and significantly shorten as the intermetatarsal angle is closed. If this scenario should occur, a poor surgical outcome will result. Excision of the medial eminence is recommended after the osteotomy has been completed and secured with stable fixation because of these rotational changes. The basilar crescentic osteotomy is an excellent method for correction of a marked metatarsus primus varus. It is important to pay close attention to a variety of anatomic considerations. The osteotomy must not be made in the diaphysis because of potential nonunion. There should be little dissection of the periosteum because of possible delayed union. As in any bunion surgery, it is essential to perform an adequate, distal, soft-tissue repair. Three dimensional preoperative planning is essential in obtaining correction of all components of a bunion. Specific guidelines, based on a three-dimensional computer model, are now available. An interactive computer program also is available to aid the surgeon in preoperative planning. We hope there will be better understanding of this technically difficult but highly versatile osteotomy.\r"

When the vascular status cannot be improved, however, amputation is preferable to continued conservative care. Neuropathic ulceration is the product of decreased sensation, deformity, and increased pressure at the site of the ulcer. Pressure relief by conservative or surgical means is required for healing. Neuroarthropathy is increasing in frequency and results primarily from autonomic denervation. Protection from weight bearing and orthotic control usually minimize deformity and ultimately restore the patient to an ambulatory status. Surgical intervention in neuroarthropathy may be effective when conservative means fail. All efforts at treatment may be undermined by poor compliance. Patient education, reinforced at each clinic visit, makes the patient a part of the treatment team.\r"

Coverage can be difficult because of the special weight-bearing properties of the foot, the lack of intervening muscle between the skeletal elements and the integument, and the limited mobility of the overlying integument. Sorting out the 40 to 50 flap options for the foot and ankle requires a classification that describes the wound, the patient, and the available surgical options. The wound is classified based on size, anatomic location, and the presence or absence of infection. The anatomic location also describes the weight-bearing characteristics of the wound. Associated arterial, nerve and skeletal injuries are noted. A very small wound is less than 2 X 2 cm. A small wound is from 2 X 2 to 4 X 5 cm. A medium wound is from 4 X 5 to 7 X 7 cm. A large wound is from 7 X 7 to 10 X 20 cm, and a very large wound is from 10 X 20 up to 15 X 40 cm. Does the wound involve weight-bearing skin? Patient considerations include age and the presence of systemic or local compromise. Tobacco use, cosmetic concerns, occupation, rehabilitation potential, and amputee prejudices should be ascertained. Flap options can be classified as local transpositional, island pedicle, distant pedicle, and free-tissue transfers. The flaps may or may not incorporate muscle that may be needed for revascularization and dead space management in osteomyelitis. Some flaps are inappropriate because of local artery or nerve injuries. Some flaps will provide sensate coverage, and others can provide reinnervation potential. The potential to create new neuromas, ease of dissection, flap reliability, and cosmesis of the donor site are all important considerations.\r"

Orthotic devices are divided into the following types: (1) those that reduce impact and cushion the foot, such as nitrogen-filled rubber or thermoplastic foam; (2) those that release pressure, as relief areas or support adjacent to an area of pressure by adhesive felt or foam, custom innersoles, or combinations of pads and innersoles; and (3) those that reduce abnormal pressures and strains on the foot, thereby allowing the foot to function more normally and relieving pressure areas and foot strain. \"Posting\" generally is used to allow the subtalar joint to function in the neutral position. Shoes now are being used not only to cover and protect the foot, but also to correct abnormalities and improve foot function. It is important to realize that a shoe is made over a last, which is a concept of the shape of a foot, and the shoe should be made the same shape as the foot. Bracing of the foot should take into account the shape of the foot; it should relieve the abnormality and allow the lower extremity to function during gait.\r"

Eighty-seven of the children had been previously well. Their mean duration of hospitalization was 3.4 days. Previously well infants younger than 6 weeks of age experienced significantly longer hospitalizations and more days of supplemental oxygen and were more likely to require intensive care than were older children. Children older than 12 weeks of age were hospitalized for a mean of 2.5 days and did not require intensive care. Oxygen saturation was measured in the emergency room for 67 of the previously well infants; in 42 oxygen saturation was at least 90% whereas in 25 saturation was less than 90% or infants were receiving supplemental oxygen at the time of measurement. Decreased initial oxygen saturation was associated with a prolonged hospitalization (5.3 vs. 3.2 days, P less than 0.01) and with more days of supplemental oxygen (4.4 vs. 1.5 days, P less than 0.01). We conclude that among previously well infants admitted to the hospital with respiratory syncytial virus infection, infants younger than 6 weeks of age are at increased risk for a prolonged and more severe hospital course than are older children.\r"

One hundred thirty-eight of the 185 double reflectivity tracings were associated with abnormal impedance tympanometry. The double reflectivity phenomenon may be important in helping to explain the false negative results occasionally seen with this technology in low and intermediate reflectometry scores. Future clinical research involving acoustic reflectometry should utilize the recording device and single and double reflectivity tracings should be handled separately in any analysis of data. Use of the recorder will also prevent false positive errors in the interpretation of some intermediate reflectivities.\r"

  ".W": "Korean adoptees placed by Associated Catholic Charities of Baltimore between January, 1985, and December, 1988 (N = 873), underwent surveillance for tuberculosis (TB). Overall tuberculin reactivity or active TB was documented in nine placements. Two children had active disease; both were skin test-negative and one died of tuberculous meningitis. The median age of the seven asymptomatic tuberculin reactors, none of whom had received Bacillus Calmette-Guerin vaccination, was 1 year. This reactivity rate is approximately 50 times greater than that of age-matched United States-born children. We conclude that high risk pediatric groups for TB, in addition to refugees, displaced persons and black and Hispanic minorities, include children involved in international adoption. Total reliance cannot be placed on screening tuberculin skin tests, and TB must be included in the differential diagnosis of high risk children presenting with recurrent pneumonia, fever of unknown origin, failure to thrive and altered mental status.\r"

Positive routines involved changing the child's bedtime to coincide with when he naturally fell asleep, as well as parent and child engaging in a series of four to seven enjoyable activities before the child being placed in bed. During the treatment period, bedtimes were systematically scheduled earlier such that the child went to bed at the time parents had originally used. Graduated extinction consisted of the parent putting the child to bed and ignoring the tantrum activity for increasingly longer amounts of time throughout the treatment. Children in these two treatment groups had tantrums less frequently and for shorter periods than control subjects during 6 weeks of treatment and during two follow-up observations 3 and 6 weeks after treatment. Although both treatments were more effective than waiting for the child to outgrow this problem, parents of the positive routine group reported significantly improved marital satisfaction, suggesting additional benefits of this treatment strategy.\r"

The present study was designed to determine whether data collected directly from adolescents can be used to develop a simple model for differentiating suicidal from nonsuicidal adolescents. Patients aged 13 to 19 years hospitalized for medical complications of serious suicide attempts (n = 56) or for acute illnesses unrelated to injuries or ingestions (n = 248) completed self-administered questionnaires pertaining to psychosocial function, recent stress, alcohol and drug use, and health care use. Compared with ill adolescents, suicidal adolescents had poorer mental health, impulse control, family relationships, and school performance; higher 3-month stress scores and alcohol-use scores; and more use of 7 of 12 drugs (P less than .05). Compared with ill adolescents, suicidal adolescents were more likely to report previous suicide attempts (39% vs 10%, P less than .001) and previous mental health care (27% vs 8%, P less than .001) but were less likely to identify a primary care site (61% vs 87%, P less than .001). In a logistic regression model based on previous suicide attempts, previous mental health care, poor school performance, marijuana use, and dependence on the emergency room for primary care, 84% of the suicidal and 55% of the ill adolescents were correctly identified. If validated prospectively, these five self-administered questions may constitute a helpful screen for the rapid identification of suicidal adolescents.\r"

Although recommended treatments are thought to be safe and effective, the impact of jaundice and therapy on maternal attitudes and behavior is unknown. It was hypothesized that, in contrast to comparison mothers, mothers of jaundiced infants would be more likely to stop breast-feeding in the first month of life, have more separation difficulties with their infant, and be greater users of health care. Both groups of mothers were surveyed in the hospital and 1 month after discharge. Mothers were eligible if their infants were born at Yale-New Haven Hospital after February 1987 and were in the regular nursery. Jaundiced infants had a total serum bilirubin concentration greater than or equal to 205 mmol/L (12 mg/dL); control infants were not jaundiced. Of those who agreed to participate, 84% (85/101) of mothers of jaundiced infants and 80% (124/155) of control mothers completed the 1-month questionnaire. There were no substantial differences between the control and jaundiced groups, respectively, with regard to maternal age (29.1 years vs 29 years) education (66% vs 60% some college), or race (86% vs 82% white). Breast-feeding was more common in the jaundiced group (61% vs 79%, P less than .05). By 1 month, more mothers of jaundiced infants had completely stopped breast-feeding (19% vs 42%, P less than .01). They were more likely to have never left the baby with anyone else (including the father) or left the baby at most one time for less than 1 hour (15% vs 31%, P less than .05).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The reported incidence of mumps has declined dramatically since licensure of the live attenuated mumps vaccine in the United States in 1967, particularly in young children. Because administration of the vaccine was not widely practiced during the first decade it was available, there is now a cohort of teenagers and young adults who are relatively underimmunized. Reported mumps cases in this cohort increased substantially during 1986 to 1987. Mumps outbreaks at three Illinois universities, from which 123 clinical cases were reported between September 1986 and May 1987, were investigated. Meningeal involvement was reported in 17% of case-patients, orchitis occurred in 19% of 64 men, 6% of patients were hospitalized, and direct health care costs were estimated at $264 per case and more than $32,000 for the three outbreaks combined. The risk of mumps illness was greater for students less than 20 years of age (relative risk [RR] = 2.1, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.4, 3.1); students residing in dormitories (RR = 2.7, 95% CI = 1.6, 4.6); and out-of-state students (RR = 1.8, 95% CI = 1.0, 3.0). Because the available data suggest that mumps in college-aged persons is due chiefly to a failure to vaccinate susceptible persons, colleges and universities should become one major focus of mumps prevention activities to reduce susceptibility in this high-risk population.\r"

Four periodic breathing parameters (percentage of periodic breathing per quiet time, number of episodes of periodic breathing per 100 minutes of quiet time, mean duration of periodic breathing, and longest episode of periodic breathing) were compared to data available from healthy term infants and from term infants who subsequently died of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). Periodic breathing was found in all preterm infants studied and mean periodic breathing parameter values (12.0%, 8.6 episodes, 1.2 minutes, and 7.3 minutes, respectively) in our preterm population were substantially higher than values from healthy term infants and SIDS victims. Most periodic breathing parameters decreased significantly in infants studied at 39 to 41 weeks' postconceptional age compared with earlier postconceptional age groups. No relationship was found between central apneas of greater than or equal to 15 seconds' duration and postconceptional age or any periodic breathing parameter. Periodic breathing is a common respiratory pattern in preterm infants that is usually not of pathologic significance. Associations between elevated levels of periodic breathing and respiratory dysfunction or SIDS should be made with caution.\r"

The extracorporeal membrane oxygenation procedure requires surgical dissection in the carotid sheath on the right side of the neck, an area immediately adjacent to both the vagus and recurrent laryngeal nerve. It is speculated that vocal cord paralysis in these infants was acquired as a result of the extracorporeal membrane oxygenation cannulation. Although the vocal cord paralysis resolved in all cases, two patients had difficult courses after extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. Therefore, laryngoscopic examination should be considered for patients after extracorporeal membrane oxygenation.\r"

To examine the influence of disease severity on outcome, the growth and neurodevelopment of survivors of necrotizing enterocolitis were evaluated when the babies were 20 months' corrected age. Between 1975 and 1983, 1506 VLBW infants were admitted to the hospital, and necrotizing enterocolitis developed in 84 (5.6%). Forty infants (48%) survived to be 20 months' corrected age, and complete follow-up data were available for 36. Survivors were classified by modified Bell's criteria into four groups by increasing severity of disease; 13 had mild necrotizing enterocolitis (stage IIA, IIB), and 23 had severe necrotizing enterocolitis (stage IIIA, IIIB). The 36 survivors were compared with 766 surviving VLBW infants without necrotizing enterocolitis. There were no perinatal or socioeconomic differences between groups. Compared with infants with stage II necrotizing enterocolitis at 20 months, infants with stage III necrotizing enterocolitis had a higher rate of subnormal body weight (39% vs 15%) and subnormal head circumference (30% vs 0%). Thirty-three percent of necrotizing enterocolitis survivors had significant neurodevelopmental impairment; the majority of impaired infants (10 of 12) were survivors of stage III necrotizing enterocolitis. These findings highlight the importance of continued evaluations for medical and neurodevelopmental sequelae.\r"

This has been correlated with structural abnormalities in the carotid body and respiratory nuclei of the brainstem. In recent studies, the denervating effect of asphyxial brainstem dysfunction on the pulmonary neuroendocrine cells, which probably function as chemoreceptors, was demonstrated and prompted the following study. The pulmonary neuroendocrine system was evaluated in 25 victims of SIDS and 20 control infants, ranging in age from 3 weeks to 7 months and 1 to 12 months, respectively. The pulmonary neuroendocrine cells were stained by the Churukian-Schenk method and the neuroendocrine cell-positive airway values expressed as a percentage of the total number of airways. The range of positive airway values for victims of SIDS was 2% to 97% with a median of 73%. In contrast, the range for the control infants was 1% to 44% with a median of 25.5%. The SIDS victims' percentage was significantly greater than the control infants' percentage (P less than .0001). The number of pulmonary neuroendocrine cells in positive airway was also increased among SIDS victims compared with control infants. The altered pulmonary neuroendocrine cell pattern could be attributable to either brainstem dysfunction or chronic hypoxia. These explanations are not, however, mutually exclusive of one another; in fact, it is possible that both mechanisms may be operative.\r"

Frequent users as children and young adults had a greater prevalence of headaches and stomachaches, but at both ages boys were less likely to seek care when faced with complaints or perceived health problems. A significant association was found between consistently frequent care use as a child and subsequent academic problems as a young adult. The importance of identifying children with chronic complaints (unrelated to physical causes) and helping them to deal with the true sources of their distress are emphasized by the data.\r"

Of the nonanemic infants, 22% became anemic. Serum iron and percentage saturation of transferrin decreased, whereas serum ferritin increased significantly. Mean cell volume, iron-binding capacity, protoporphyrin, and haptoglobin did not show changes. Reticulocyte index and erythropoietin increased significantly at 30 days. Leukocyte counts, Zetacrit, and C-reactive protein did not help to predict the hemoglobin decrease. These results suggest that a mild viral infection in infants induces a significant decrease in hemoglobin that may persist for 14 to 30 days and may be difficult to distinguish from iron deficiency.\r"

Following orthopedic surgery, they may also be immobilized at a time when they are hypercoagulable. In addition, as with patients with spinal cord injury, patients with myelomeningocele are prone to urinary tract infection, which may cause local inflammation in the pelvic veins. For the first time, three patients with myelomeningocele complicated by deep venous thrombosis are described. The differential diagnosis (deep venous thrombosis vs osteomyelitis vs fracture) is also discussed in a child with myelomeningocele and a warm, swollen leg, as are the diagnostic methods available. Finally, the issue of antithrombotic prophylaxis in patients with myelomeningocele who are to undergo extensive orthopedic surgery is discussed.\r"

  ".W": "Height and weight data from the Mexican-American portion of the Hispanic Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (HHANES) are shown for children of ages 2 to 17 years and compared with data for non-Hispanic white children from the second National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey and with the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) reference curves. Differences in stature between the Hispanic Health and Nutrition Examination Survey and the reference populations were minor prior to adolescence and could be entirely attributed to the greater poverty of Mexican-Americans. However, differences increased during adolescence (ie, median stature was less than the 25th percentile of the NCHS reference population at 17 years of age) and, in contrast with earlier ages, were independent of poverty. Similar growth patterns were observed in samples of upper-class subjects from Mexico and Guatemala. Nonetheless, the extent to which the short stature of Mexican-American adolescents is genetic is unclear because there is an apparent time trend toward greater stature in the Mexican-American population. In conclusion, the NCHS reference curves are appropriate growth standards for preadolescent Mexican-American children. Whether they are valid for Mexican-American adolescents remains unclear.\r"

More than 6% of adolescents, or nearly 2 million nationwide, suffered some degree of disability or limitation in their usual activities in 1984. The leading causes of disability were mental disorders and respiratory diseases. Adolescents living in poverty and in households where the adult members had completed little formal education exhibited increased risk of disability. Disabled adolescents were shown to have three times as many physician contacts annually and spend nine times as many days hospitalized as their nondisabled counter-parts. One in every seven adolescents with a disability was found to be uninsured--exposing their families to extreme financial risks. The great cost of insurance was cited as the primary reason for absence of coverage for 70% of all adolescents without coverage. Public policy implications of these results are discussed.\r"

Staphylococcus aureus was cultured from the ear canal and tissues of one patient and Streptococcus faecalis from the ear canal of another patient. Necrotizing otitis externa resolved in two patients after 2 weeks of intravenous antibiotics, debridement, and resolution of neutropenia. One patient required prolonged intravenous antibiotics and several surgical procedures. The occurrence of necrotizing otitis externa in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia and severe neutropenia, the association of Gram-positive cocci with necrotizing otitis externa, and the importance of protecting anatomic barriers like the external ear canal in immunocompromised patients are emphasized.\r"

The contractures developed in early childhood and usually did not improve or worsen with time. Large and small joints were affected and usually were symmetrical. Their occurrence did not correlate with vascular disease. The contractures could not be attributed to a neurologic cause.\r"

The dolls were used in 60 cases (72%). When the dolls were used, children provided significantly more information than by interview alone about what had happened and about the identity of the suspected perpetrator. Children less than 3 years of age, however, were unable to provide details about the abuse despite the use of the dolls. The ratings of the likelihood that sexual abuse had occurred were based on all of the information in the case including that obtained through the diagnostic interview with the dolls. When these ratings were compared with the ratings based on evidence obtained solely from noninterview data, the likelihood of abuse was higher in 35% of the cases. It was concluded that substantially more information is provided by young children when anatomically correct dolls are used and that the likelihood of detection of abuse is increased when information from the child is included in the assessment.\r"

It did not stimulate the proliferation of other cell types such as bovine vascular smooth muscle cells, corneal endothelial cells, adrenal cortex cells, granulosa cells, BALB/MK cells, or BHK-21 cells. Microsequencing revealed an N-terminal sequence having no significant homology to any known protein. The release of FSdGF by pituitary cells and its target cell specificity raise the possibility that FSdGF may play a role in angiogenesis.\r"

  ".W": "An approximate geometry of a stable, four-way DNA junction has been determined in free solution by applying the technique of transient electric birefringence. The current approach consists of (i) construction of a set of six molecules in which two of the four arms of a synthetic junction are elongated by approximately 9-fold (in each of the six possible two-arm combinations), (ii) determination of the ratios of the longest birefringence decay time of each elongated junction to the decay time of a linear control molecule, and (iii) comparison of the experimental ratios with corresponding ratios computed as a function of the junction interarm angle. The result is a set of six angles that define the geometry of the junction. In the presence of magnesium ions, the junction adopts a geometry in which particular pairs of arms approach colinearity. Furthermore, the geometry of the junction is significantly altered in the absence of magnesium, adopting a more uniform structure, although such an effect is not apparent on gels. The application of transient electric birefringence, as described in the current study, should be useful for the characterization of a broad range of tertiary structures in both DNA and RNA.\r"

This transcription factor, designated delta, was purified more than 3000-fold from extracts of crude rat liver nuclei and has a native molecular mass of approximately 230 kDa. DNA-dependent ATPase (dATPase) and transcription activities copurify when delta is analyzed by hydrophobic interaction and ion-exchange HPLC, arguing that transcription factor delta possesses an ATPase (dATPase) activity. ATPase (dATPase) is specific for adenine nucleotides; ATP and dATP, but not CTP, UTP, or GTP, are hydrolyzed. ATPase (dATPase) is stimulated by both double-stranded and single-stranded DNAs, including pUC18, ssM13, and poly(dT); however, DNA fragments containing the TATA region of either the adenovirus 2 major late or mouse interleukin 3 promoters stimulate ATPase as much as 10-fold more effectively than DNA fragments containing nonpromoter sequences. These data suggest the intriguing possibility that delta plays a critical role in the ATP (dATP)-dependent activation of run-off transcription through a direct interaction with the TATA region of promoters.\r"

We report that activator II isolated from HeLa cell extracts is a PCNA-dependent DNA polymerase delta that is required for efficient replication of DNA containing the SV40 origin of replication. PCNA-dependent DNA polymerase delta on a DNA singly primed phi X174 single-stranded circular DNA template required PCNA, a complex of the elongation inhibitor and activator I, and the single-stranded DNA-binding protein essential for SV40 DNA replication. DNA polymerase delta, in contrast to DNA polymerase alpha, hardly used RNA-primed DNA templates.

The cytosolic form of DAHP synthase, DS-Co, was unaffected by fungal elicitor. In the same experiments, phenylalanine ammonia-lyase activity (EC 4.3.1.5) increased, while no effect on isoforms of chorismate mutase (EC 5.4.99.5) was observed. The subcellular localization of the two DAHP synthase isoforms in parsley was confirmed by differential centrifugation. Prior treatment of cultures with actinomycin D or cycloheximide prevented the increase in DS-Mn activity, indicating transcriptional regulation.\r"

  ".W": "Prolyl 4-hydroxylase (EC 1.14.11.2) is a key enzyme required for the posttranslational hydroxylation of proline residues in collagen. The enzyme is a tetramer composed of two pairs of nonidentical subunits (alpha 2 beta 2). The beta subunit is protein disulfide-isomerase, a ubiquitous enzyme found in the endoplasmic reticulum of many cell types. We report here the amino acid sequence of the alpha subunit. One cDNA clone (alpha 1) was isolated from a chicken embryo cDNA expression library in lambda gt11 by screening with anti-alpha-subunit polyclonal immunoglobulins. This alpha 1 cDNA contains an open reading frame of 1401 base pairs. A comparison of the translation of the nucleotide sequence with protein sequences obtained from the purified chicken alpha-subunit polypeptide verified that alpha 1 cDNA encoded the alpha subunit. Polymerase chain reactions were used to extend the sequence of alpha 1 cDNA toward the 5' end of alpha-subunit mRNA. The mature alpha subunit is composed of 516 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 59,373 Da. The compiled amino acid sequence contains two potential glycosylation sites, an observation that agrees with a previous demonstration that the alpha subunit contains two N-linked oligosaccharide chains. Blot hybridization analysis of total chicken embryo RNA detected an mRNA of 3.5 kilobases, a size that closely resembles the size of the cloned cDNA. Since the expression of the alpha subunit is confined to cell types that synthesize and secrete collagens, the regulation of the synthesis of the alpha subunit may play a central role in determining the expression of prolyl 4-hydroxylase activity.\r"

Phosphorylation was maximal at 2 hr of phorbol 12-O-tetradecanoate 13-acetate treatment and returned to basal levels by 24 hr. In contrast, using a p80-specific antibody, we found that phorbol 12-O-tetradecanoate 13-acetate treatment produced no increase in p80 concentration. p80 showed a progressive decrease in JB6 cells during progression from a preneoplastic to neoplastic phenotype. The lack of p80 expression in neoplastic cells was not attributable to lack of protein kinase C; the protein kinase activity and protein concentration were similar in cells of all three phenotypes. When p80 mRNA was analyzed by hybridization to a putative p80 cDNA clone, its relative concentration paralleled that of p80 protein, with high levels present in preneoplastic JB6 cells, and little or no evidence for p80-hybridizing RNA in transformed cells. Thus, p80 appears to be regulated pretranslationally at the level of mRNA concentration during preneoplastic progression in mouse epidermal JB6 cells.\r"

Competitive reconstitution experiments showed the superiority in histone octamer binding of DNA molecules in which segments consisting exclusively of A and T or G and C, separated by 2 base pairs (bp), are repeated with a 10-bp period. These repeated (A/T)3NN(G/C)3NN motifs are superior in nucleosome formation to natural positioning sequences and to other repeated motifs such as AANNNTTNNN and GGNNNCCNNN. Studies of different lengths of repetitive anisotropically flexible DNA showed that a segment of approximately 40 bp embedded in a 160-bp fragment is sufficient to generate nucleosome binding equivalent to that of natural nucleosome positioning sequences from 5S RNA genes. Bending requirements along the surface of the nucleosome seem to be quite constant, with no large jumps in binding free energy attributable to protein-induced kinks. The most favorable sequences incorporate into nucleosomes more strongly by 100-fold than bulk nucleosomal DNA, but differential bending free energies are small when normalized to the number of bends: a free energy difference of only about 100 cal/mol per bend (1 cal = 4.184 J) distinguishes the best bending sequences and bulk DNA. We infer that the distortion energy of DNA bending in the nucleosome is only weakly dependent on DNA sequence.\r"

HBGF-1 alone (half-maximal effect at 60 pM) stimulated hepatocyte DNA synthesis and bound to a high-affinity receptor (Kd = 62 pM; 5000 per cell). Epidermal growth factor (EGF) neutralized or masked the mitogenic effect of HBGF-1 concurrent with appearance of low-affinity HBGF-1 binding sites. HBGF-1 reduced the inhibitory effect of transforming growth factor type beta (TGF-beta) on the EGF stimulus. Nanomolar levels of HBGF-1 decreased the EGF stimulus. An increase in hepatic HBGF-1 gene expression after partial hepatectomy precedes increases in expression of the EGF homolog, TGF-alpha, and nonparenchymal-cell-derived TGF-beta in the regenerating liver. Expression of HBGF-1 mRNA occurs in both hepatocytes and nonparenchymal cells and persists for 7 days in liver tissue after partial hepatectomy. HBGF-1 acting through a high-affinity receptor is a candidate for the early autocrine stimulus that drives hepatocyte DNA synthesis prior to or concurrent with the EGF/TGF-alpha stimulus. It may allow hepatocyte proliferation to proceed in the presence of low levels of TGF-beta. An EGF/TGF-alpha-dependent change in HBGF-1 receptor phenotype and increasing levels of nonparenchymal-cell-derived HBGF-1 and TGF-beta may serve to limit hepatocyte proliferation.\r"

In adults it reappears in malignant tumors and during inflammation and tissue repair. Extracellular matrix proteins can alter cell morphology, adhesion, motility, differentiation, and growth. Since cells of the immune system can express receptors for extracellular matrix, we investigated the effects of tenascin on human monocytes and T and B lymphocytes. Tenascin inhibited monocyte adhesion to fibronectin and enhanced the LFA-1 (lymphocyte function-associated antigen 1)-dependent clustering of Epstein-Barr virus-transformed B cells. The physiological consequences of the effects of tenascin were studied in several T-cell activation models. Tenascin inhibited T-cell activation induced by a soluble antigen (tetanus toxoid), alloantigens, or the mitogen concanavalin A. However, T-cell activation with phytohemagglutinin, crosslinked anti-CD3 antibody, or a mixture of ionomycin and phorbol ester was not inhibited by tenascin. Tenascin did not prevent interleukin 2-dependent T-cell growth or the cytolytic activity of an antigen-specific CD4+ T-cell clone. These results suggest that tenascin alters the adhesion properties of human monocytes, B cells, and T cells. The in vitro immunosuppressive activity of tenascin might be due to abrogation of an accessory cell function at an early stage of the interaction between antigen-presenting cells and T cells.\r"

The specific cDNA clone used in these studies encoded the putative signal peptide and the first 53 amino acids of the alpha subunit and was approximately 94% homologous to its human counterpart. IGF-I receptor gene expression was studied during the perinatal period and at various intervals until early adulthood. Overall, steady-state IGF-I receptor mRNA levels decreased dramatically during postnatal development; however, the extent of the decrease differed among the various tissues studied. In contrast to receptor mRNA levels, IGF-I mRNA levels increased in some of the same tissues. The molecular mechanisms underlying this apparent divergent transcriptional control of the IGF-I and IGF-I receptor genes warrant further study.\r"

In a small proportion of the recipient animals examined after birth, long-term repopulation by the embryonic donor hemopoietic cells was observed. The donor hemopoietic stem cells proliferated and differentiated in the hosts as evidenced by the presence of donor hemoglobins in the growing recipient host animals. Some mothers of the pups were also repopulated by the donor stem cells. These results provide direct evidence that, during early murine embryogenesis, there are functional hemopoietic stem cells which are capable of colonizing the adult hemopoietic organs and probably the fetal liver and spleen to initiate hemopoiesis in these tissues.\r"

This conservation is localized to sequences encoding framework regions 1 and 3 of the antibody variable region and is exerted at the nucleotide level. Because selection acting at the amino acid level alone cannot explain the conservation of these sequences, these sequences must have a noncoding function. The preferential rearrangement of VH7183 and VH III genes, together with the similarity of the conserved sequences to elements implicated in recombination in other systems, suggest that these sequences function to target the series of rearrangements that assemble complete immunoglobulin genes.\r"

Common to all mutants described has been the deletion of the most-5' sequences of the beta-globin complex. We have used the techniques of pulsed-field gel electrophoresis and polymerase chain reaction to study a patient with a clinical gamma delta beta-thalassemia phenotype. This subject developed a de novo deletion on a maternally inherited beta-globin gene chromosome involving approximately 30 kb of sequences 5' to the epsilon gene; the deletion extends from -9.5 kb to -39 kb 5' of epsilon and includes three of the four DNase I hypersensitive sites (at -10.9 kb, -14.7 kb, and -18 kb 5' of epsilon). The remaining sequences of the beta-globin complex, including the DNase I hypersensitive sites at -6.1 kb and all structural genes in cis to the deletion are physically intact, but presumably nonfunctional, as evidenced by the presence of a beta S-globin gene that is not expressed as a sickle hemoglobin.

For example, Prn-pb I/Ln mice inoculated with scrapie isolate passaged through Prn-pa NZW mice had incubation times of 283 +/- 21 days compared with a 193 +/- 6 day incubation time seen with isolate passaged once through isologous I/Ln mice. No further shortening of incubation time was observed following further isologous passage. NZW incubation times were prolonged by inoculation with prions from I/Ln mice. Results from (NZW x I/Ln)F2 mice and from using inocula from donors isologous for Prn-p but otherwise allogeneic with respect to the recipient suggest that the primary structure of PrPSc is responsible for these incubation time results. Incubation times in (NZW x I/Ln)F1 mice were constant regardless of the passage histories of the scrapie isolates and were equivalent to those of I/Ln mice inoculated with I/Ln prions, contending that prolongation of scrapie incubation time by the prion incubation time gene Prn-i is fully dominant. I/Ln incubation times longer than those in F1 hybrids may reflect a reduced efficiency of allogeneic PrPSc in initiating disease. Although some investigators propose that differences in behavior among scrapie isolates reflect host selection and argue for a nucleic acid genome, we suggest that the variation observed among our scrapie isolates is epigenetic, reflecting host-directed differences in the amino acid sequence of PrPSc.\r"

  ".U": "90017504\r", 
  ".W": "The mouse adipsin gene encodes a member of the serine protease family that is expressed predominantly in adipose tissue and is secreted into the bloodstream. Adipsin expression is sharply down-regulated in several models of genetic and acquired obesity, representing the first example of an adipocyte gene whose expression is greatly altered in this disorder. In this study, we have asked whether a DNA fragment from the adipsin gene can direct tissue-specific expression of a heterologous gene and mediate the suppression of this expression in genetic and chemically induced obesity. Transgenic mice have been constructed with 950 bases of DNA from the 5' flanking region of the adipsin gene linked to the bacterial chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) gene in a mouse strain bearing a recessive obesity gene (diabetes, db). By crossing db/+ transgenic mice with nontransgenic db/+ mice, we obtained progeny that allowed a direct comparison of CAT expression in the tissues of lean and obese littermates. The lean mice express CAT activity predominantly in adipose tissue, while the obese mice show a marked reduction in CAT expression relative to the lean controls. When similar experiments are performed with an adipsin-CAT fusion gene containing a heterologous AKV (AKR mouse leukemia virus) enhancer, the tissue specificity of CAT expression in lean mice is broadened to include the thymus, spleen, brain, and other tissues; down-regulation occurs in all of these tissues in mice homozygous for the obesity gene or in mice that have been injected with monosodium glutamate (MSG), which induces obesity. These results indicate that 950 bases of the 5' flanking region of the adipsin gene carry information that specifies both expression in adipose tissue and a response to a gene or chemical that induces obesity. These results also suggest that the trans-acting factors that are regulated aberrantly in these forms of obesity are not restricted to adipose tissue and could play a role in obesity-linked dysfunctions observed in other tissues as well.\r"

  ".W": "T-cell lymphomas induced in rats by Moloney murine leukemia virus acquire increasing numbers of proviruses in their genome during tumor progression in vivo and passage of tumor cells in vitro. To determine whether the proviruses progressively acquired during tumor progression play a causal role in this process, we cloned one of them from a cell line derived from the primary tumor 2772. A probe from the cellular DNA flanking the provirus was used to analyze 79 DNA samples from primary tumor tissues of 28 tumor-bearing rats and 80 DNA samples from 30 independent tumor cell lines. This analysis revealed a rearrangement in this region in the primary tumor derived from the thymus of one animal but not in a clone of the same tumor segregating in the spleen. Of the cell line DNA samples, three carried a provirus in this region. Two of these integration events had occurred independently in two clonally related sublines derived from tumor 2772, and they were followed by rapid selection in culture. On the basis of these findings this locus was named Tpl-1 (tumor progression locus 1). The Tpl-1 locus was mapped to rat chromosome 8 and to mouse chromosome 9 at a genetic distance of 1.2 +/- 0.9 centimorgans from the Ets-1 protooncogene. Although the genetic distance between Tpl-1 and Ets-1 indicates that they are different genes, analysis of Tpl-1 cDNA clones revealed that the two are closely related.\r"

  ".W": "Tfm (testicular feminization) mutant mice lack functional androgen receptors. By studying liver tumor development in Tfm mice, we have shown that the greater susceptibility of male mice relative to female mice for liver tumor induction by N,N-diethylnitrosamine is androgen receptor-dependent. C57BL/6J normal and Tfm mutant mice were injected at 12 days of age with N,N-diethylnitrosamine (0.2 mumol/g, i.p.), and liver tumors were enumerated in 50-week-old animals. Normal males averaged 20 liver tumors per animal; Tfm males, 0.7; normal females, 0.6; and Tfm/+ heterozygous females, 1.5. The androgen receptor gene and the Tfm mutation are X chromosome linked. Because of random X chromosome inactivation, hepatocytes from Tfm/+ heterozygous female mice are mosaic with respect to the expression of mutant or wild-type receptors. To determine if testosterone acts directly as a liver tumor promoter, through the androgen receptor in preneoplastic hepatocytes, or by an indirect mechanism, we chronically treated these mosaic female mice with testosterone and measured the androgen receptor content of the resulting tumors. B6C3F1 Tfm/+ mosaic and +/+ wild-type female mice were injected i.p. at 12 days of age with N,N-diethylnitrosamine (0.1 mumol/g) and ovariectomized at 8 weeks of age. Half of the mice of each group subsequently received biweekly s.c. injections of testosterone (0.15 mg per mouse) for 30 weeks. Tumor multiplicity was the same for wild-type and Tfm/+ mosaic females treated with testosterone (31-32 tumors per animal at 38 weeks of age) and was increased relative to females not treated with testosterone (13-17 tumors per animal at 50 weeks of age). Testosterone treatment did not significantly increase the percentage of androgen receptor-positive tumors in Tfm/+ mosaic females: 58% of the tumors from Tfm/+ mosaic females treated with testosterone were receptor positive compared to 48% in Tfm/+ females not treated with testosterone and 92% in wild-type females treated with testosterone. Finally, the number of androgen receptors in the majority of liver tumors examined was greatly decreased relative to the surrounding normal liver tissue. We conclude that liver tumor promotion by testosterone requires a functional androgen receptor in the intact animal. However, this promotion is not cell autonomous; that is, the response of the preneoplastic hepatocyte is not dependent on the expression of functional receptor in the target cell.\r"

Recently, we have been able to map the TCD gene to a small region of overlap between five different, male-viable Xq21 deletions that were found in patients with TCD and other clinical features. Two families were identified in which classical, nonsyndromic TCD is associated with small interstitial deletions that are only detectable with probe p1bD5 (DXS165). To characterize these and two other deletions that were identified more recently, we have used the chromosome walking and jumping techniques to generate a set of five chromosomal-jumping clones flanking the DXS165 locus at various distances. With these clones, we could localize four of the eight deletion endpoints and the breakpoint on the X chromosome of a female with a de novo X/13 translocation and choroideremia. These studies assign the TCD gene, or part of it, to a DNA segment of only 15-20 kilobases.\r"

USA 83, 7438-7442] reported that LC are deficient in surface expression of MHC class I antigens, implying a specialization of these cells to class II-restricted antigen presentation. To readdress this obviously important issue, we have studied murine epidermal sheets prepared from B6 X BALB/c----B6 bone marrow chimeras 5 months after irradiation and bone marrow reconstitution. This enabled us to distinguish class I of LC from that of surrounding keratinocytes. When sheets were analyzed by immunofluorescence microscopy with monoclonal antibodies specific for donor class I antigens, donor-derived LC but not LC of recipient origin were stained. Appropriate controls for antibody isotype and MHC haplotype were negative. LC in epidermal cell suspensions, prepared from normal BALB/c and BALB/cBy mice (MHC haplotype d), were analyzed by flow cytometry as well as immunofluorescence microscopy. LC were stained by monoclonal antibodies to class I antigens of haplotype d, but not by isotype-matched control antibodies to class I antigens of haplotype k. We also found that LC were virtually depleted from epidermal cell suspensions by treatment with monoclonal antibodies to class I antigens of haplotype d and complement but not by treatment with control monoclonal antibodies and complement. Our data, therefore, show that LC express MHC class I molecules on their surface.\r"

Cultures of peripheral blood lymphocytes were established with medium alone or with medium containing Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) or pokeweed mitogen. HIV antibodies were determined by an ELISA performed with commercial kits in which a whole virus extract served as antigen. Optimal antibody secretion was detected in 7-day peripheral blood lymphocyte cultures to which EBV had been added to provide polyclonal B-cell activation. Pokeweed mitogen-induced antibody secretion and spontaneous antibody secretion were less consistent. With EBV as a stimulus, the sensitivity and specificity of this assay for determining HIV infection status were each 100% in adults. When the assay was applied to infants and children, 23 of 24 symptomatic HIV-seropositive children (class P-2) and 11 of 33 asymptomatic seropositive infants aged less than or equal to 15 months (class P-0) tested positive for EBV-induced antibody secretion. Six of the 11 P-0 patients who tested positive have progressed to develop symptomatic disease, while the remainder are still seropositive at ages 2-15 months. Of the infants who were negative in this assay, all have remained asymptomatic. Treatment with 3'-azido-3'-deoxythymidine in infected adults and children has resulted in transient suppression of the in vitro antibody response in some instances. Thus EBV-induced synthesis of HIV-specific antibodies in vitro is a sensitive and specific indicator of HIV infection and is of help in determining infection status of asymptomatic seropositive infants who are classified as having \"indeterminate\" infection.\r"

  ".W": "The strategy chosen for cloning potential vaccine antigens of Toxoplasma gondii was based on the hypothesis that the definitive protection observed in natural infection is due to the presence of encysted bradyzoite forms in host tissues throughout life. The antigens released by the bradyzoites would maintain an immune response against the invading tachyzoites. This led us to identify in tachyzoite in vitro translation products a polypeptide of 24 kDa that is an excreted-secreted antigen (ESA) and is cross-reactive with bradyzoites. In addition, the detection of anti-P24 IgG antibodies is correlated with the chronic infection in man. The gene encoding P24 has been isolated, sequenced, and expressed in Escherichia coli and eukaryotic cells. The recombinant proteins were immunogenic in mice, producing anti-native P23 antibodies. Immunocytochemical analysis located the native antigen in the dense granules of both tachyzoite and bradyzoite forms and showed that it is secreted within host-cell-modified phagosome. Moreover 45Ca2+ labeling as well as regional homologies indicate that this protein has Ca2+-binding properties, suggesting its physiological importance in host-cell invasion. P23 is of diagnostic interest as a marker of chronic toxoplasmosis and is proposed as a vaccine component.\r"

To address this possibility, transgenic mice carrying the human IL-6 genomic gene fused with a human immunoglobulin heavy chain enhancer were generated. High concentrations of human IL-6 and polyclonal increase in IgG1 (120- to 400-fold) in sera of all transgenic mice were observed. A massive plasmacytosis in thymus, lymph node, and spleen and an infiltration of plasma cells in lung, liver, and kidney were observed. However, the plasma cells were not transplantable to syngeneic mice and were found not to contain chromosomal aberrations including c-myc gene rearrangements. The evidence indicates that deregulated gene expression of IL-6 can trigger polyclonal plasmacytosis but cannot induce plasmacytoma. It is suggested that additional genetic changes may be required for the generation of plasma cell neoplasia. Other interesting findings in these transgenic mice were the development of mesangio-proliferative glomerulonephritis and an increase in megakaryocytes in bone marrow.\r"

Previous results from studying [(NZB x NZW)F1 x NZB] backcross mice indicated that the NZW major histocompatibility complex (MHC) or gene(s) closely linked to this locus provides the major dominant NZW genetic contribution to the F1 disease. A surprising feature of the results was the 12% frequency of discordance between the autoimmune phenotype and the presence of the NZW H-2z haplotype. In the current study, we attempted to precisely define the position of the NZW gene(s) required for lupus-like renal disease by mapping genes in individual backcross mice that are both centromeric and telomeric to the MHC and then correlating genotypes for each locus with disease. The data indicate that an adjacent NZW locus does not provide a more accurate correlation with the autoimmune phenotype compared with MHC genes themselves. Thus, the imperfect association of MHC haplotype with disease in this murine model is not explained by genetic recombination with linked genes. These data may provide insight into the mechanisms by which MHC antigens increase the probability of developing autoimmune disease and may help explain the difficulty of defining MHC relationships in human systemic lupus erythematosus.\r"

We have demonstrated a similar role in antigen focusing for the low-affinity Fc epsilon receptor (Fc epsilon RII) on mouse B lymphocytes. B cells treated with an IgE monoclonal antibody to 2,4,6-trinitrophenyl (TNP) (IgE-B cells) were 100-fold more effective than were untreated B cells in presenting low concentrations of TNP-antigen to T cells. Blocking the binding of IgE to Fc epsilon RII on IgE-B cells with a monoclonal antibody to Fc epsilon RII completely eliminated this increased effectiveness. Preformed complexes of IgE anti-TNP and TNP-antigen were more effectively presented (approximately 100-fold) than TNP-antigen in the presence of nonspecific IgE. In contrast, complexes of IgG1 anti-TNP and TNP-antigen, capable of binding to Fc gamma receptors on B cells, were presented less effectively than TNP-antigen in the presence of nonspecific IgG1. Antigens focused by means of Fc epsilon RII or by means of B-cell surface immunoglobulin receptors were presented at comparably low concentrations. For several reasons, Fc epsilon RII on B lymphocytes seems to be particularly effective in efficiently focusing IgE-antigen complexes.\r"

It encodes a 37-kDa protein of 331 amino acids with two potential N-linked glycosylation sites. Analogous to its human counterpart, there is no signal sequence and the putative transmembrane region is close to the amino terminus, indicating an inverse membrane orientation with the carboxyl terminus at the cell exterior. The predicted murine Fc epsilon RII amino acid sequence demonstrates a 57% identity with its human counterpart. The murine sequence has an additional internal repeat motif of 21 amino acids giving four repeats as compared to three in the human sequence. Furthermore, the murine Fc epsilon RII is truncated at the carboxyl terminus and the Arg-Gly-Asp sequence, a common recognition site of integrin receptors, which is found in the reverse configuration in human Fc epsilon RII, is missing. B cells activated with interleukin 4 and lipopolysaccharide have an increased amount of Fc epsilon RII mRNA as compared with resting or lipopolysaccharide-stimulated B cells. Con A-activated normal T cells, the TH-2 cell line D10, as well as the macrophage cell line J774 have no detectable Fc epsilon RII mRNA. Expression analysis using transiently transfected COS cells revealed that recombinant murine Fc epsilon RII binds anti-Fc epsilon RII as well as mouse and rat IgE but does not bind human IgE or mouse IgG. Fc epsilon RII expressed in COS cells has a molecular mass of 45 kDa whereas the Fc epsilon RII from B-cell lines is a 49-kDa protein.\r"

  ".U": "90017525\r", 
  ".W": "During latent infection by herpes simplex virus (HSV), an abundant latency-associated transcript (LAT) that is antisense to a predominant viral alpha gene (ICP0) is found localized in the nucleus of sensory neurons. We disrupted both copies of the LAT gene in the HSV-1 genome by insertion of the Escherichia coli lacZ gene under LAT promoter control. The resulting recombinant virus, RH142, does not express any detectable LAT in either latently or productively infected cells, although beta-galactosidase expression is readily detectable in sensory neurons of latently infected mice. Expression was first detectable 3 days postinoculation and continued at approximately the same level for the entire experimental period (56 days). beta-Galactosidase expression was not detectable at any time during RH142 replication in Vero cells. Thus, the kinetics of expression and cell-type specificity of the LAT gene are distinct from other HSV-1 genes that are expressed during productive growth. When latently infected trigeminal ganglia were explanted, RH142 reactivated from latency with the kinetics and an efficiency indistinguishable from the parental wild-type virus. These studies argue against any possible antisense regulatory mechanism of LAT in the regulation of viral gene expression or any role of LAT-encoded protein during the establishment or maintenance of latency in the mouse.\r"

  ".W": "A semi-intact preparation was used to study the effects of classical conditioning on the type of siphon response elicited by a conditioned stimulus to the mantle of Aplysia. Five pairings of the conditioned stimulus with an unconditioned stimulus to nerves from the tail transformed the constricting alpha response of the siphon into a conditioned flaring response resembling the unconditioned response to stimulation of the tail nerves. Although some pseudoconditioning occurred, an associative component was indicated by the significantly greater incidence of flaring responses after paired training than after unpaired presentations of the conditioned and unconditioned stimulus or the unconditioned stimulus alone. Previously described cellular plasticity in the underlying neural circuits suggests a testable model based on cell-wide rather than synapse-specific mechanisms, which can account for specific conditioned responses. In this model, effective stimulus-response associations are produced by a concatenation of stimulus-specific facilitation of sensory neurons (a mechanism for alpha conditioning) and response-specific facilitation of motor neurons (a mechanism for pseudoconditioning).\r"

  ".W": "The gill- and siphon-withdrawal reflex of Aplysia undergoes classical conditioning of its amplitude and duration when siphon stimulation (the conditioned stimulus, CS) is paired with tail or mantle shock (the unconditioned stimulus, US). This conditioning of a preexisting response exhibits both temporal and stimulus specificities, which can be accounted for by activity-dependent enhancement of presynaptic facilitation of the siphon sensory neurons. To test whether conditioning of the reflex also exhibits response specificity (development of a new type of response to the CS that often resembles the response to the US), we measured the direction of siphon withdrawal in response to siphon stimulation (the CS) with tail or mantle shock as the US. The unlearned response to siphon stimulation is straight contraction, the response to tail shock is backward bending, and the response to mantle shock is forward bending. In the first experiment, we trained different animals with the tail or mantle US paired or unpaired with the CS; in a second experiment, we trained each animal with two CSs, one of which was paired with the US; in a third experiment, we varied US intensity; and in a fourth experiment, we trained each animal with two USs, one of which was paired with the CS. There was a significant, pairing-specific tendency for the direction of the response to the CS to resemble the response to the US after training in each experiment, demonstrating response specificity in conditioning of the withdrawal reflex. This feature of conditioning could in principle be accounted for by an elaboration of activity-dependent facilitation.\r"

D2 mRNA was found both in dopamine projection fields and in regions associated with dopamine-containing cell bodies, suggesting both postsynaptic and presynaptic autoreceptor localization. Highest concentrations of D2 mRNA were found in neostriatum, olfactory tubercle, substantia nigra, ventral tegmental area, and the nucleus accumbens. This distribution is consistent with those reported with D2 receptor autoradiography.\r"

In teleosts, horizontal cell coupling is modulated by the neurotransmitter dopamine. Using voltage-clamped pairs of teleost horizontal cells, we have examined the effects of dopamine on the conductance and gating properties of the cell-to-cell channels that mediate electrical synaptic transmission. Variance analysis of the junctional current noise showed that dopamine substantially reduced the open probability of gap junction channels, from 0.75 to 0.14. Direct observation of unitary junctional gating events in poorly coupled cell pairs indicated that these channels have a unitary conductance of 50-60 pS. The elementary conductance of channels in cell pairs treated with dopamine (48.7 +/- 6.6 pS) was statistically indistinguishable from channels in untreated cells (53.2 +/- 7.2 pS). Uncoupling with octanol also yielded a similar unitary conductance (61.1 +/- 11.1 pS). Our results suggest that dopamine reduces the open probability of gap junctional channels by decreasing their open duration.\r"

In streptozotocin-treated diabetic mice, they were reduced to 18% and 20% of controls, respectively, 5 weeks after the drug injection. Furthermore, levels of submandibular prepro-EGF mRNA in these diabetic mice were decreased almost in parallel with the glandular EGF concentrations, while there was no change in the levels of submandibular beta-actin mRNA and kidney prepro-EGF mRNA. In addition, histological examination of the submandibular glands indicated that the size of the granular convoluted tubules, which produce EGF, was substantially reduced in the diabetic mice. Insulin administration to streptozotocin-treated mice almost completely reversed the decrease in EGF content in the submandibular gland, substantially elevated the level of the glandular prepro-EGF mRNA and plasma EGF concentration, and increased the size of the granular convoluted tubules in the gland. These results indicate that EGF deficiency occurs in diabetes mellitus and that insulin may be important in maintaining the normal level of EGF in the submandibular gland and plasma.\r"

Repetitive parenteral administration of small doses of this synthetic heme analogue resulted in dose-related diminutions of carcass fat content without changes in carcass protein content. Direct injection of the compound into the third ventricle of the brain produced changes in food intake and body weight that were quantitatively similar to those observed after parenteral treatment but required only 1-2% of the parenteral dose. The effects of intracerebroventricularly administered cobalt protoporphyrin on body weight were dose-related and were not produced by inorganic cobalt, heme, and a number of other metal-substituted protoporphyrins. Differential body weights between control and treated animals persisted for at least 300 days after intracerebroventricular injections of a single dose (0.2 or 0.4 mumol/kg of body weight) of the compound. Similar effects were observed after subcutaneous administration of the metalloporphyrin to genetically obese Zucker (fa/fa) rats and normal and genetically obese (ob/ob) mice as well as chickens and dogs. Cobalt-substituted mesoporphyrin elicited comparable effects on food intake and body weight. The results of these studies define a new biological action of cobalt protoporphyrin and demonstrate that this and certain other cobalt porphyrins can act, at least in part, in the central nervous system to regulate appetite and to produce long-sustained diminutions in body weight and carcass content of fat in animals.\r"

Field data from Mexico were used to classify a subset of the neotropical migrants as using forest or scrub habitats during winter. Population declines during 1978-1987 were significantly greater among the forest-wintering species, while populations of scrub-wintering species increased. The same subset of neotropical migrants also showed overall declines in forest-breeding species, but no significant differences existed between species breeding in forest and scrub habitats. Neotropical migrant species that primarily use forested habitats in either wintering or breeding areas are declining, but a statistically significant association between habitat and population declines was detected only in the tropics.\r"

Morphology of the normal portions of each labrum was categorized according to length, width, and tip shape. Correlation between morphology and age was weak, but abnormal labra were more common in younger patients. Conventional radiography was more accurate for detecting bony glenoid margin fractures, but CT was more accurate for detecting Hill-Sach fractures. CT was also more reliable than conventional arthrography in the detection of rotator cuff tears. Hence, few if any conventional radiographs are necessary between contrast material injection and CT imaging. A reduction in the number of images obtained will result in decreased radiation dose, less cost, and shorter examination time without loss of diagnostic accuracy.\r"

Focal or diffuse decreased signal intensity, representing dense bone, was seen on images obtained with short and long repetition times (TRs) and echo times (TEs); high-signal foci, representing fat collections, were seen on short TR/TE images; and high-signal foci, representing fibrovascular marrow in active Paget disease, were seen on long TR/TE images. Complications of Paget disease-including basilar invagination, spinal stenosis, and sarcoma--were well identified on MR images. Although MR imaging is not generally used in diagnosis of Paget disease, the disease will be encountered more frequently as more MR imaging examinations are performed. An awareness of the range of findings in Paget disease is useful in evaluating MR images of the musculoskeletal and other systems.\r"

All patients underwent tenography. Arthrography was performed if results of tenography were negative. All patients with positive tenographic or arthrographic results underwent surgery. Tenography proved to be reliable in the diagnosis of injuries of the calcaneofibular ligament (sensitivity, 88%; specificity, 87%-94%). The positive predictive value of tenography in combination with arthrography was 100% for the diagnosis of lateral ligament ruptures. The authors conclude that a combination of arthrography and tenography is a reliable method for diagnosing recent ruptures of the lateral ankle ligaments and for differentiating between isolated ruptures of the talofibular ligament and combined lesions of both the talofibular and the calcaneofibular ligaments.\r"

A discoid meniscus was said to be present if three or more 5-mm-thick contiguous sagittal images demonstrated continuity of the meniscus between the anterior and posterior horns. High-resolution coronal images allowed more graphic depiction of the abnormally wide meniscus. In approximately one-third of the cases in which coronal images were obtained, the measurable height difference between the discoid and the opposite meniscus was greater than or equal to 2 mm. Arthroscopic correlation (obtained in 10 cases) revealed that six cases of discoid meniscus were diagnosed correctly with MR imaging, although one meniscus was considered discoid at MR imaging but was not considered discoid at arthroscopy. Of three discoid menisci seen to be torn at arthroscopy, two were seen to be torn at MR imaging.\r"

Of the 14 MR imaging examinations, 11 were true-positive, two were true-negative, one was false-positive, and none was false-negative. In the indium scans obtained in this group of patients, five were true-positive, three were true-negative, none was false-positive, and three were false-negative. In two amputated extremities, close correlation was found between the extent of disease seen on surgical and pathologic examination and that demonstrated by MR imaging, which could delineate the course of sinus tracts. MR imaging was therefore helpful in assessing the activity of chronic complicated osteomyelitis and beneficial in surgical planning for these patients.\r"

A hydrogen-1 MR image-guided localization technique (ISIS) was used to acquire P-31 spectra selectively from a volume of interest within the liver. Spectra were analyzed to yield absolute molar concentrations of hepatic phosphomonoesters, phosphodiesters, inorganic phosphate, and adenosine triphosphate. It was found that (a) hepatic metabolite ratios in alcoholic liver disease were not significantly different from those in healthy subjects, (b) absolute hepatic metabolite concentrations were decreased by 25%-46% in alcoholic hepatitis and 13%-50% in alcoholic cirrhosis compared with those in healthy subjects, and (c) hepatic intracellular pH was 7.4 in healthy subjects, more acidic in alcoholic cirrhosis, and more alkaline in alcoholic hepatitis. The findings indicate that hepatic metabolite ratios are not a sensitive measure of alcoholic liver disease, that quantitative P-31 MR spectroscopy is able to noninvasively show metabolic changes associated with alcoholic liver disease, and that alcoholic hepatitis and cirrhosis may be distinguished by means of hepatic intracellular pH measured with MR spectroscopy.\r"

PS images were compared subjectively with T1- and T2-weighted spin-echo (SE) images for hepatic lesion detection and conspicuity. For hepatic metastases (n = 27), PS images were equal to T1-weighted images in lesion detection in 17 patients but showed fewer lesions in five patients and false-negative results in two. When compared with T2-weighted images, PS images depicted more lesions in six patients, an equal number of lesions in 18, and fewer lesions in two. Hepatomas (n = 8) were detected with each sequence in all patients. Hepatomas were often more conspicuous on PS images than on T2-weighted images; they were of equal conspicuity on PS and T1-weighted images in most cases. Whereas fatty infiltration (n = 16) appeared on PS images as areas of low signal intensity similar to that of paraspinal muscle, it produced no detectable abnormality on either T1- or T2-weighted images. PS imaging is inferior to T1-weighted SE imaging in the detection of hepatic metastases. The major role of PS imaging at intermediate field strength is to differentiate focal fatty infiltration from hepatic metastases.\r"

Enlargement of the affected kidney, present initially in 12 patients, persisted up to 6 weeks and resolved by 10-16 weeks. Abnormalities of parenchymal contrast material enhancement persisted for 1-2 months. New cortical scars appeared in six of 12 patients with an initially normal renal contour and in one of five patients who had scars initially. Three patients with a renal abscess developed a new calyceal diverticulum, presumably by rupture of the abscess into the collecting system. The present study shows that abnormalities of renal size and enhancement persist for weeks to months after clinical signs of infection resolve and that scarring in adults with urinary tract infection occurs more frequently than was previously realized.\r"

The MR examinations of two patients were of undiagnostic quality and therefore considered to be technical failures. Each technique resulted in five false-positive and one false-negative examination for the diagnosis of extravesical tumor spread. In 28 patients the integrity of the bladder wall was assessed with MR imaging. In 22 patients the bladder wall was disrupted, and 18 of these patients had deep muscle invasion. In six patients the bladder wall was intact, and none of these patients had evidence of deep muscle invasion at pathologic examination. In this study MR imaging was slightly inferior to CT in the delineation of invasive tumors beyond the bladder wall. However, if one excludes from analysis the two patients with undiagnostic studies, there is no significant difference in accuracy between the two techniques.\r"

The nine patients with subacute hypersensitivity pneumonitis showed small, rounded opacities and patchy air-space opacification on CT scans. These findings reflected the histologic findings, which consisted of interstitial pneumonitis, cellular bronchiolitis, and small, noncaseating granulomas. The six patients with symptoms for 12 months or longer also showed irregular linear opacities on CT scans, corresponding to areas of fibrosis.

VC images of a chest phantom were generated with various weightings of the beam-profile image. Edge artifacts were substantially reduced with a weighting of greater than 0.5 and eliminated with a weighting of 1.0. The S/N properties of VC images were measured with a series of plastic squares placed over various regions of the chest phantom. The S/N of the squares in the dense sub-diaphragm were improved twofold compared with the S/N on unequalized radiographs, whereas the S/N in the lung was reduced by 30%. Studies of a volunteer revealed the ability to render images with aggressive equalization (for improved mediastinal visualization) and images with the appearance of traditional chest radiographs.\r"

Computer analysis of catheter-flow models revealed that placement of larger side holes proximally and smaller side holes distally produces more uniform flow rates out of the holes. This decreases the risk of potentially hazardous delivery of high-pressure jets of contrast material from the end hole. The flow pattern is so uniform that it resembles a cloud of contrast material on injection. This catheter design is particularly applicable for 3-5-F catheters, which require high-pressure injections. Clinical testing in 50 cases revealed no extravasations or unintentional selective injections with use of this catheter.\r"

In all 11 patients all stones were successfully removed from the gallbladder and cystic duct.

The recurrence rate in the remaining 38 patients (41 pseudocysts) was 23.7% (nine of 38 patients). Since 1986, seven patients have been treated with percutaneous pseudocystogastrostomy (one also underwent external drainage and is thus included in the previous series, too) after placement of a transgastric drainage catheter, with no recurrence (follow-up, 2-26 months). It is concluded that transgastric drainage should be performed whenever the anatomic situation is favorable and that a pseudocystogastric stent should be placed in these patients whenever secretions are still abundant after 7-10 days.\r"

A satisfactory echocardiographic examination of the isthmus was achieved in 28 patients. Comparison with data from gradient measurements at catheterization and Doppler ultrasound shows that the reduction of lumen diameter correlates well with the gradient and that restenosis at the site of the repair can be suspected when the percentage of stenosis at the isthmus is greater than 50%. MR imaging showed a Dacron patch aneurysm in three patients. Cine MR imaging showed systolic signal loss in the ascending aorta that was presumed to be due, among other factors, to turbulent flow generated from a bicuspid valve. Similar signal loss was seen in the descending aorta distal to the site of the coarctation repair, but this was not related to the presence or absence of a gradient. Aortic compliance measured from transverse MR systolic and diastolic images was abnormally low, suggesting it may be a factor causing systolic hypertension after coarctation repair. MR imaging is a reliable and accurate noninvasive method likely to supersede other methods of assessing the aorta and isthmus following coarctation repair.\r"

All patients had asymmetric cerebral involvement. Lesions were distributed throughout the brain, including the brain stem and basal ganglia. White matter was affected in all 10 patients; gray matter was also involved in five. In one patient the lesion enlarged and crossed the corpus callosum and contained focal hemorrhage.

These volume data are then submitted to a raytracing projection program, which retrospectively yields multiple arbitrary projection angles rotating through any plane. Venous structures are suppressed with a presaturation slab superior to the current section. The slab location is advanced in concert with advancement of each new section location. The acquisition time varies from 6 to 13 minutes, depending on the number of sections acquired for three-dimensional display. This method obviates the subtraction of image data sets to suppress signals from stationary spins, is more sensitive to slow blood flow than three-dimensional methods of acquisition, and shows special promise for the study of extracranial vascular disease.\r"

Both prostheses created a chemical shift artifact on all imaging sequences owing to the difference in chemical composition of the prostheses and the surrounding tissue.\r"

The structure of this enzyme was elucidated by isolating clones from a bovine brain complementary DNA library through the use of oligonucleotide probes derived from partial amino acid sequence. The beta-ARK cDNA codes for a protein of 689 amino acids (79.7 kilodaltons) with a protein kinase catalytic domain that bears greatest sequence similarity to protein kinase C and the cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cyclic AMP)--dependent protein kinase. When this clone was inserted into a mammalian expression vector and transfected into COS-7 cells, a protein that specifically phosphorylated the agonist-occupied form of the beta 2-adrenergic receptor and phosphorylated, much more weakly, the light-bleached form of rhodopsin was expressed. RNA blot analysis revealed a messenger RNA of four kilobases with highest amounts in brain and spleen. Genomic DNA blot analysis also suggests that beta-ARK may be the first sequenced member of a multigene family of receptor kinases.\r"

An IL-1-responsive element in the promoter region of the human IL-2 gene was similar to the binding site for the transcription factor AP-1. IL-1 enhanced expression of c-jun messenger RNA, whereas the antigenic signal enhanced messenger RNA expression of c-fos. Thus, the two components of the AP-1 factor are independently regulated and the AP-1 factor may serve as a nuclear mediator for the many actions of IL-1 on cells.\r"

The majority of t(1;19)(q23;p13)-carrying leukemias and cell lines studied contained rearrangements of E2A as determined by DNA blot analyses. The rearrangements altered the E2A transcriptional unit, resulting in the synthesis of a transcript larger than the normal-sized E2A mRNAs in one of the cell lines with this translocation.

  ".W": "The basal ganglia, of which the striatum is the major component, process inputs from virtually all cerebral cortical areas to affect motor, emotional, and cognitive behaviors. Insights into how these seemingly disparate functions may be integrated have emerged from studies that have demonstrated that the mammalian striatum is composed of two compartments arranged as a mosaic, the patches and the matrix, which differ in their neurochemical and neuroanatomical properties. In this study, projections from prefrontal, cingulate, and motor cortical areas to the striatal compartments were examined with the Phaseolus vulgaris-leucoagglutinin (PHA-L) anterograde axonal tracer in rats. Each cortical area projects to both the patches and the matrix of the striatum; however, deep layer V and layer VI corticostriatal neurons project principally to the patches, whereas superficial layer V and layer III and II corticostriatal neurons project principally to the matrix. The relative contribution of patch and matrix corticostriatal projections varies among the cortical areas examined such that allocortical areas provide a greater number of inputs to the patches than to the matrix, whereas the reverse obtains for neocortical areas. These results demonstrate that the compartmental organization of corticostriatal inputs is related to their laminar origin and secondarily to the cytoarchitectonic area of origin.\r"

  ".W": "We analyzed all cases of tuberculosis reported in North Carolina between 1966 and 1986, and related the incidence rate of tuberculosis (per 100,000 population) to age (0 to 4 years, 7.59; 5 to 14 years, 3.44; 15 to 24 years, 6.30; 25 to 44 years, 15.92; 45 to 64 years, 33.85; greater than 65 years, 51.54), race (white 9.03, nonwhite 47.40), and gender (male 25.49, female 11.25). Over the 21-year study period the annual number of cases declined from 1,248 to 711 (43%), and the incidence rate from 25.56 to 11.25 (56%). Although the incidence rate of tuberculosis fell for all subgroups, nonwhites continued to have an incidence rate 3.2 to 22.5 times higher than whites, depending on age. The standardized morbidity ratio (SMR) (by age, race, and gender) of tuberculosis in the eastern region of North Carolina was nearly twice that of the western region and unexplainable by its demographics. Between 1983 and 1986 only a small percentage of cases of tuberculosis in North Carolina were accounted for by migrant farm workers (1.7% to 2.7%) and patients with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (less than 1%). Tuberculosis is increasingly a disease of the elderly, especially nonwhite men. Tuberculosis is a geographically and demographically focal disease in North Carolina, and preventive strategies should be appropriately targeted.\r"

In the blunt trauma group, 16 laparotomies (8%) showed no injury and 24 (12%) showed that no repair was needed. Physical examination (68 cases) and diagnostic peritoneal lavage (DPL) (121) were used as the primary indication for laparotomy. In the stab wound group, there was a high incidence of negative or nontherapeutic operation when proximity to the abdomen or deep fascial penetration was the indication for operation. Patients sustaining gunshot wounds had a 27% incidence of negative laparotomy, with proximity being the primary indication for operation. Two deaths in the negative laparotomy group occurred due to associated injuries. Complications were minimal. DPL has decreased the number of negative operations but has increased the nontherapeutic operations. The high incidence of negative laparotomy for stab wounds shows the need for selective management rather than routine exploration.\r"

  ".U": "90019659\r", 
  ".W": "From January 1986 to December 1987, 32 patients with recurrent colorectal cancer had second-look radioimmunoguided surgery (RIGS system). All patients had pathologic confirmation of recurrence. The RIGS system identified 81% of recurrences, and in six patients recurrent tumor was identified only by RIGS. All patients had physical examination, carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) assay, and computerized tomography of the abdomen and pelvis. Detection of recurrence was based on symptoms in six, elevated CEA value in 25, and physical examination in one. The CEA was elevated preoperatively in 30 patients; two false-negative results occurred in symptomatic patients who had pelvic recurrence. The median CEA value in those with liver recurrence was 30 ng/ml (range 5.2 to 298) and for pelvic recurrence 13 ng/ml (range 1.9 to 31) (P less than .05). The overall sensitivity of CT was 41% (abdomen other than liver 37%, liver 56%, and pelvis 22%). The combination of elevated CEA, symptoms, and physical findings identified 100% of recurrences. We conclude that a rising CEA remains the most accurate indicator of recurrence. CT should not be done routinely to detect recurrent colorectal cancer unless CEA is elevated or the patient is symptomatic. In our study the intraoperative use of the RIGS system aided the surgeon in identifying occult tumors.\r"

Mammography was the sole detection modality in 76 (56%) patients. The combination of mammography and physical examination revealed 41 (30%) cancers, whereas 19 (14%) were detected on physical examination alone. There were 26 (19%) noninvasive and 110 (81%) invasive neoplastic lesions. Positive axillary nodes were found in 34 (25%) patients, and 102 (75%) patients had negative nodes. For the entire group 5- and 10-year survival rates were 84.5% and 75%, respectively. After a minimum follow-up of 10 years and a median of 13.5 years, 102 patients are alive; one of these has a recurrence of cancer. Among the 34 patients who are no longer living, 14 died of causes unrelated to breast cancer. Two patients in the group in which diagnosis was based on mammography alone died of breast cancer, for a breast cancer-related fatality rate of 2.6% (2/76). By contrast, the breast cancer-related mortality of patients whose tumors were palpable at the time of detection was 30% (18/60) (p = 0.00001). This study suggests that long-term survival of patients whose breast cancer is detected by screening is, in large measure, dependent on the ability to detect malignant lesions before they become palpable.\r"

This approach potentially avoids invasive angiography and unnecessary treatment delays in multiply injured patients but risks missed aortic transections if the CT or its interpretation is not accurate. We prospectively evaluated 153 consecutive trauma patients in whom we suspected blunt aortic injury between September 1985 and August 1988. All hemodynamically stable patients underwent contrast-enhanced chest CT followed by immediate aortic arch angiography. Forty-nine unstable patients underwent immediate angiography without chest CT, and 11 (22%) had major thoracic arterial injuries. Data from the remaining 104 stable patients indicate that the sensitivity of chest CT for diagnosis of major thoracic injury is 55%; specificity, 65%. If the chest CT had been used as a screening modality to perform aortic angiography, two transected aortas and three major aortic branch injuries would have been missed. We conclude that chest CT has no screening role in the evaluation of blunt trauma patients with possible major vascular injury.\r"

  ".U": "90019955\r", 
  ".W": "Because absorption of cyclosporine (CyA) given orally immediately after liver transplantation is unreliable, the drug is usually given intravenously until external biliary drainage is discontinued. Intravenous CyA, however, is associated with serious side effects, making its use potentially hazardous. We report the results of a new strategy in which we used oral CyA exclusively and refed bile to enhance oral CyA absorption. Thirty-two liver transplant recipients with indwelling T tubes were studied. All were given sequential quadruple drug immunosuppression with antilymphoblast globulin, azathioprine, and steroids. Oral CyA and refeeding of bile was started when renal function was stable. By the second posttransplant week, satisfactory CyA levels were achieved, and antilymphoblast globulin therapy was stopped. There were significant associations between oral CyA dose and CyA level and between quantity of refed bile and CyA level (p less than 0.001). CyA dose and quantity of bile refed were covariates, however, and in multiple regression analysis, only the quantity of refed bile was significant (p = 0.001). CyA levels did not correlate with rejection. The incidence of rejection was 63%. At a mean follow-up of 9 months, 28/32 (88%) patients were alive, and actuarial 1-year patient survival was 84%. Current graft and renal function are excellent (serum bilirubin, 1.0 +/- 0.1 mg/dl; serum creatinine, 1.2 +/- 0.1 mg/dl). We conclude that intravenous CyA can be avoided in virtually all liver-transplant recipients by administration of oral CyA with bile in the early posttransplant period.\r"

  ".W": "Despite advances made in the care of infants with congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH), survival remains poor. New therapy, such as extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), is controversial but may improve survival. Thirty-two newborns with CDH were treated. Thirteen infants were treated with jugular vein-carotid artery ECMO after CDH repair elsewhere; six (46%) survived. Three of the remaining 19 were moribund shortly after birth and first received ECMO, then underwent repair; two (67%) survived. The other 16 underwent CDH repair; 8 of 9 (89%) recovered with conventional therapy, and 4 of 7 (57%) survived when ECMO was used after conventional therapy failed. Overall survival was 63%. Parameters with which physicians may attempt to predict survival or the need for ECMO after repair--such as A-aDO2, ventilatory index versus PCO2, presence of a \"honeymoon period\" (PaO2 greater than 100 mm Hg after repair), or oxygenation index--were unreliable. ECMO can improve survival in infants with CDH, probably through reversal of pulmonary hypertension. Presently available methods of predicting survival after CDH repair with or without ECMO are not accurate, and thus no infant should be excluded from repair or ECMO support.\r"

We assessed the effect of the selective calcium channel blocker verapamil on the performance of rat hyperemic island skin flaps. Pretreatment with verapamil markedly improved survival of skin flaps after 6 hours of venous cross-clamping compared with animals receiving placebo only (99% vs 53.3%; p less than 0.01). Verapamil also prevented the formation of lipid peroxidation products and the depletion of the endogenous antioxidant glutathione, suggesting that the beneficial effect of verapamil is the result of protection against oxygen radical injury. After 12 hours of venous cross-clamping, verapamil did not improve survival of skin flaps despite protection against lipid peroxidation. Oxygen radical release is therefore a crucial event in the pathogenesis of skin flap necrosis after short-term ischemia but is of less significance in long-term ischemia.\r"

Mean operative time and intraoperative blood loss were significantly reduced for SCT (p less than 0.05). After CSB a continuous deterioration of the hemodynamic status of the reconstruction was noted, whereas there were no significant changes after SCT (p less than 0.05). Whenever feasible, SCT should be considered the operation of choice for patients with symptomatic severe subclavian artery disease.\r"

  ".W": "In August 1983 we began routinely studying the inferior vena cava (IVC) before placement of a Greenfield filter. We have performed 83 caval interruptions since that time, but six patients were excluded from this study because an IVC clip had been placed in three patients during other abdominal surgery, and the medical records of three others could not be retrieved. Of the remaining 77 patients, 65 (84%) had IVC venograms taken before placement of their filter. We personally reviewed 63 of these cavograms but had to accept the radiologist's reports for two studies that could not be retrieved. Ten (15%) cavograms showed abnormalities that significantly affected the placement of the filter. The most frequent abnormality was intracaval clot extending above the L3-4 interspace. Other important abnormalities were severe narrowing of the diaphragmatic IVC (two patients) and a tortuous IVC in a patient with severe scliosis. Seven (11%) additional cavograms showed unilateral iliac thrombus that would have influenced the surgical approach had a femoral approach been required. Formal preoperative cavography expedited filter placement and reduced operating time by obviating the need for intraoperative angiograms. Because 26% of the cavograms showed clinically important information, we recommend that routine IVC angiograms be taken before filter placement.\r"

Twenty-five consecutive cases were followed up for 12 months to 10 years after treatment of disease associated with pancreas divisum, diagnosed by endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography. Thirteen patients had no recurrence of acute pancreatitis after dorsal duct sphincterotomy alone, during long-term follow-up (mean, 54 months); one patient had recurrent pancreatitis during 33 months after failed sphincterotomy. Eight patients had variable results 12 months to 8 years (mean, 49 months) after dorsal duct sphincterotomy for pancreatic pain syndrome (without amylase elevation), three were pain free, and one had recurrent pancreatitis. For 10 years after dorsal duct sphincterotomy for chronic pancreatitis, one patient had no pain relief; after subtotal pancreatectomy and pancreaticojejunostomy of the dorsal duct, both for chronic pancreatitis, one patient each was pain free and normoglycemic after 54 and 12 months, respectively. Dorsal duct sphincterotomy alone is successful in achieving long-term freedom from recurrence of acute pancreatitis associated with pancreas divisum. Pancreatic pain syndrome is not consistently improved by dorsal duct sphincterotomy. Chronic pancreatitis associated with pancreas divisum should be treated by resection or drainage procedures, not by dorsal duct sphincterotomy.\r"

This study reviews our experience with intravenous morphine sulfate as an adjunct to promote gallbladder filling in 18 critically ill patients who demonstrated nonvisualization of the gallbladder during cholescintigraphy performed as part of a diagnostic workup for occult sepsis. Findings suggestive of a biliary source included fever, leukocytosis, abdominal tenderness, abnormal liver function test results, fasting, and total parenteral nutrition. Morphine was administered to all 18 patients after nonvisualization of the gallbladder; in 17 cases prompt visualization was noted, thus excluding cystic duct obstruction. The remaining patient underwent operation for acalculous cholecystitis. None of the 17 patients whose gallbladders were visualized had a subsequent clinical course consistent with untreated biliary sepsis. Radionuclide cholescintigraphy with morphine appears to be useful in the evaluation of critically ill patients with suspected biliary sepsis. It is particularly helpful in confirming or excluding the diagnosis of acute acalculous cholecystitis in patients who are fasting or receiving total parenteral nutrition and initially demonstrate nonvisualization of the gallbladder and in patients who have previously documented gallstones.\r"

  ".W": "Biliary tract complications are a continuing source of morbidity after liver transplantation. In a 3.5-year period we performed 264 liver transplants in 226 patients (132 adults, 94 children). Biliary tract reconstruction was via Roux limb choledochojejunostomy (n = 144) or choledochocholedochostomy (n = 118). Fifty (19.1%) biliary complications occurred, and 35 (13.4%) necessitated operative repair. The incidence was similar in adults and children and after each method of reconstruction. Risk factors were vascular thrombosis and reduced-sized transplants. Diagnosis was based on the algorithmic use of multiple modalities with early biliary visualization. Roux limb complications usually occurred in the first month after transplant and necessitated operative intervention, whereas duct-to-duct problems appeared later and were more accessible to percutaneous or endoscopic manipulations. Eight (6.8%) patients required conversion to a Roux limb, whereas 8/15 (53.3%) cases of biliary stricture were successfully managed nonoperatively. Three (1.3%) patients and four (1.5%) grafts were lost as a result of biliary complications. One-year actuarial patient survival is 76.4% with a mean follow-up of 13.2 months. Early recognition of biliary complications and prompt interventional therapy can effectively prevent long-term sequelae. Although choledochocholedochostomy is more physiologic and expeditious, Roux-en-Y choledochojejunostomy remains a safe and versatile alternative and is the preferred method of reconstruction in select cases.\r"

Graft survival of the organs transplanted at the University of Wisconsin was 100% for kidney and pancreas, 93.3% for the isolated kidney, and 78.5% for the liver.

Three patients were awake and asymptomatic. The initial diagnosis could be made from lateral cervical spine x-ray film in only three of the 22 patients. In the remaining patients, the diagnosis was made by either swimmer's view (7 of 8 positive), oblique views (1 of 1 positive), flexion-extension views (2 of 3 positive), or computed tomography (CT) scan (7 of 7 positive).

The data support the advanced trauma life support recommendation for liberal use of cervical spine radiologic screening. We recommend that the screening examination consist of a lateral cervical spine film, and a swimmer's view, if necessary, to visualize C-7 and the C7-T1 interspace. We further recommend that strong consideration be given to the use of a five-view trauma series. CT scan should be viewed as complementary to conventional film techniques.\r"

In a preliminary report using the Nd:YAG laser as a pre-resectional treatment for functionally obstructing colorectal carcinoma we showed that this modality accomplished good decompression, allowing for formal bowel preparation, a definitive one-stage operation with no increased mortality or morbidity, and that the use of the Nd:YAG laser was significantly cost-effective. Our cumulative experience from 1985 to 1988 includes 11 patients; nine underwent pre-resection laser therapy followed by primary resection and anastomosis, and two underwent abdominoperineal resection. Tumors were located above the peritoneal reflection in nine patients and below in two patients. All patients had orthograde bowel preparation with Golytley the day after laser therapy and underwent definitive surgery. There were no wound or intra-abdominal infections or postoperative fatalities. These 11 laser-treated patients were compared with age-matched controls who had undergone earlier colonic diversion. No significant differences were noted for age, sex, tumor location or differentiation, stage, or overall survival. Comparisons between laser-treated patients and controls for the preoperative length of stay and total length of stay were significantly different (p = 0.002 and p = 0.001, respectively). When comparing laser-treated patients and controls, preoperative and total hospital costs were significantly different (p = 0.003 and p = 0.01). We have found that pre-resectional laser recanalization has allowed for primary resection and anastomosis in patients who have obstructing left colon and rectal carcinomas without compromising patient safety.\r"

Patients were also stratified by the delayed-type hypersensitivity response to five ubiquitous antigens. PMN adherence and PMN chemotaxis were not different in preoperative reactive or anergic patients and were equal to the control values, whereas both reactive patients and anergic patients showed altered PMN function after trauma or sepsis. There was no difference in PMN adherence or chemotaxis between patients who died and those who lived. Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that patient age, delayed-type hypersensitivity, and admission serum albumin level, not PMN adherence or chemotaxis, were significantly related to septic mortality. We concluded that altered circulating PMN adherence and chemotaxis is seen in all patients after an \"activation\" event such as trauma or sepsis. This is a nonspecific immune alteration not related to specific immune events such as delayed-type hypersensitivity; it does not correlate with patient outcome and should not be used as a predictive variable.\r"

Leiomyosarcomas, liposarcomas, and malignant fibrous histiocytomas represented 93% of the tumors. The primary tumor was completely excised in 54% of patients. Recurrent tumor developed in 68% of patients (median time to recurrence, 1.3 years). Tumor fixation to adjacent structures (T3 tumor) or a high-grade tumor (G2-4) identified patients at increased risk for recurrent disease. Five-year and 10-year survival rates were 40% and 22%, respectively. Survival was significantly better for patients who had (1) complete surgical excision of their tumors, (2) low-grade tumors (G1), (3) tumors not fixed to adjacent retroperitoneal structures (T1 and T2 sarcomas), and (4) tumors without metastases when initially seen. Complete surgical excision offers patients with retroperitoneal sarcomas the best chance for long-term survival, but recurrent disease remains a vexing problem. The therapeutic challenges in the treatment of retroperitoneal sarcomas continue to be the development of therapy that will increase the rate of complete resection, decrease the rate of local recurrence, and enhance patient survival.\r"

  ".U": "90019972\r", 
  ".W": "A reliable preoperative method to distinguish benign from malignant peripheral solitary pulmonary nodules (SPNs) would be clinically valuable. New techniques using epoxy resin plastic models of the thorax combined with calcium carbonate (phantom) nodules to determine the density of SPN have been proposed as a partial solution to this problem. During the first 3 years that phantom computed tomography (CT) has been available, 50 consecutive patients in whom SPN was discovered on screening chest x-ray film and who were considered to be candidates for surgery were evaluated by this technique. Twenty patients (40%) clearly met the phantom CT criteria for benign nodules (more dense than the phantom nodule, at least 10% of the surface area uniformly calcified, round or oval lesions without spicules, and lesions less than 3.0 cm in diameter) and have been followed up without surgery (no change on periodic screening chest x-ray film or CT for as many as 36 months). Only one of these 20 patients would have met standard x-ray criteria for benign nodules. Thirty patients who had lesions with densities less than the phantom nodule underwent thoracotomy, and in 17 (57%) of these, the lesions were malignant. No patient in this study who had a benign reading on the phantom CT scan had a malignancy at surgery or during follow-up. We conclude that phantom CT scanning is a useful adjunct to standard technique (review of prior screening chest x-ray film) and may prevent unnecessary thoracotomy in a significant percentage of patients with SPN.\r"

Presenting signs of symptoms were pain (57%), fatigue (48%), abdominal mass (40%), and weight loss (33%). Twenty-six percent of patients had a history of hepatitis or cirrhosis. Histopathologically, tumors were hepatocarcinoma (72%), fibrolamellar variant (7%), cholangiocarcinoma (9%), mixed (7%), and other (5%). Resectability rate with curative intention was 67%. Exploration and biopsy alone was performed in 27% and palliative resection in 6%. Hospital mortality was 9%, and serious morbidity was 22%. Perioperative morbidity and mortality were significantly associated with operative blood loss. Median survival was 12.6 months, with a 5-year survival of 18%. Median survival after curative resection was 22.8 months, and 5-year survival was 27%. Univariate analysis showed that female sex, normal performance status, well-differentiated tumor, and curative resection were associated with increased survival; cholangiocarcinoma, nodal metastases, cirrhosis, hypocalcemia, prolonged prothrombin time, and increased serum transaminase and alkaline phosphatase were associated with decreased survival. Cox multivariate analysis showed that curative resection, normal performance status, and well-differentiated tumors were associated with increased survival, and prolonged prothrombin time and hypocalcemia were associated with decreased survival.\r"

Both groups received 1 gm of cefazolin intramuscularly before surgery was performed. We hypothesized that this regimen of prophylaxis did not provide adequate tissue levels in the morbidly obese. Morbidly obese patients who were undergoing gastroplasty were randomly selected to receive 1 gm cefazolin in the buttock fat, buttock muscle, or by intravenous injection. A fourth group of morbidly obese patients received 2 gm of cefazolin intravenously. Normal-weight patients who were undergoing upper abdominal surgery received 1 gm of cefazolin intravenously. At incision and closure, both blood and tissue levels of cefazolin were significantly (p less than 0.001) lower for all morbidly obese patients who received 1 gm cefazolin when compared with the blood and tissue levels of the drug found in normal-weight patients. The cefazolin levels obtained were below the minimal inhibitory concentrations of greater than 2 micrograms/ml for gram-positive cocci and of greater than 4 micrograms/ml for gram-negative rods. Only when the morbidly obese patient received 2 gm cefazolin were both the serum and adipose tissue levels adequate. For a 4-month period, all morbidly obese patients received 2 gm cefazolin prophylaxis, and the wound infection rate dropped to 5.6% compared with the previous rate of 16.5% (p less than 0.03). We conclude that antibiotic prophylaxis must be specially tailored to the needs of these obese patients.\r"

There was one postoperative death in each group. In group II morbidity consisted of an anastomotic leak in one, pancreatic fistula in two, and pancreatitis in one patient. Mean survival of group I patients was 6.6 months. The mean survival of group II patients was 7.2 months. Patients who underwent total gastrectomy in the presence of peritoneal or liver metastasis lived 4 months. Those who underwent total gastrectomy in the presence of pancreatic involvement lived 4 months. Patients who underwent total gastrectomy for disease limited to the stomach and regional lymph nodes lived 13.6 months. Total gastrectomy for linitis plastica should be performed in those patients who have disease limited to the stomach or regional lymph nodes. Other patients should be offered alternative forms of treatment, including chemotherapy and radiation therapy.\r"

  ".U": "90019976\r", 
  ".W": "Barrett's esophagus is a common finding in patients with gastroesophageal reflux and is associated with a high incidence of serious complications (stricture, ulceration, and carcinoma). The reason that only a portion of patients with reflux develop Barrett's esophagus and why some are prone to develop complications is unknown. Twenty-three patients with Barrett's esophagus underwent endoscopy, 24-hour esophageal pH monitoring, and manometry. Nine of these patients with gastritis underwent 24-hour gastric pH monitoring, and three with symptoms of duodenogastric reflux underwent 99mTc-labeled hepato-iminodiacetic acid scanning. Patients with complicated (n = 12) and uncomplicated (n = 11) Barrett's esophagus were compared with each other and with patients with reflux esophagitis (n = 53) and normal volunteers (n = 50). Patients with Barrett's esophagus showed an increased exposure to acid and alkaline gastric juice compared with patients with esophagitis and normal volunteers. In the patients with Barrett's esophagus with and without complications, there was no significant difference in age, incidence of defective lower esophageal sphincter, incidence of defective peristalsis, extent of the Barrett's epithelium, or percent time the esophageal pH was less than 4. In contrast, the percent time the esophageal pH was greater than 7 was significantly greater in patients with complications. This alkaline exposure is likely to be related to duodenogastric reflux. This was supported by positive gastric pH scores for duodenogastric reflux and 99mTc-labeled hepato-iminodiacetic acid scans in patients with Barrett's complications. These findings suggest that the development of complications in Barrett's esophagus is the result of the damaging effect of refluxed duodenal juice.\r"

  ".W": "Clinically and endoscopically proved ischemia of the colon complicates elective aortic reconstruction in 1% to 2% and 6% to 7% of cases, respectively. Operative mortality exceeds 60% when transmural infarction occurs. A prospective study of colonic ischemia was undertaken in 100 male patients (mean age, 62.4 +/- 7.9 years) undergoing operation for aortic aneurysms (58) or aortoiliac occlusive disease (42). Conventional aortic surgery was undertaken in 88 patients, and in 12 patients adjunctive procedures to enhance colonic perfusion were performed 14 times, including IMA reimplantation (8), direct bypass to the internal iliac artery (4), and anastomosis of an aortofemoral bypass limb to adjacent common iliac artery (2). Colonoscopy was performed within 24 to 48 hours of aortic reconstruction. Three patients had endoscopic evidence of colonic ischemia. Transmural infarction did not develop in any patient, and bowel resections or diverting colostomies were not necessary. Three patients died, none manifesting colonic ischemia. The 12% utilization of adjunctive procedures to enhance blood flow in the colon was substantially greater than the 4% frequency of an earlier experience from our institution in which nearly half of the 5.7% operative mortality was attributed to colonic infarction. Attention to factors contributing to ischemia of the colon, and more frequent adjunctive revascularization of the colon, may lessen this complication of aortic reconstructive surgery.\r"

  ".W": "Nonoperative management of blunt trauma involving the liver and spleen has been accepted in stable pediatric patients but has been controversial in adult patients. The purpose of this study was to compare nonoperative management of blunt liver and spleen injuries in adult patients with a similar group of adult patients treated operatively and with a group of pediatric patients treated nonoperatively. A 5-year retrospective study was carried out on all hemodynamically stable patients who came to our institution with blunt abdominal trauma. There were 20 adults treated operatively (group I), 25 adults treated nonoperatively (group II), and 34 pediatric patients treated nonoperatively (group III). The mean acute physiology and chronic health evaluation score for group I was 5.1; group II, 3.1; and group III, 7.9. Delayed splenectomy was required in four adult patients in group I and in one patient in group III. There were no deaths. The mean total blood requirement was 6.0 units for group I, 2.8 units for group II, and 1.7 units for group III. The average hospital stay was 19.1 days for group I, 12.6 days for group II, and 9.2 days for group III. These data suggest that the outcome of adult patients whose blunt liver and spleen injuries are managed nonoperatively is comparable with that of pediatric patients treated nonoperatively and is as good as that of adults undergoing early laparotomy.\r"

In the pre-CT era 1977 to 1980 (group 1; 365 patients), DPL was the diagnostic procedure of choice. In the CT era 1983 to 1986 (group 2; 282 patients), DPL was used for unstable, polytraumatized patients, and CT was reserved for stable patients. The rate of delayed recognition of documented visceral injury (7%) was similar for groups 1 and 2. Celiotomy was nontherapeutic in 21 (14%) patients in group 1 and in 5 (5%) in group 2 (p less than 0.02). Despite immediate availability of abdominal CT, clinical examination alone or in combination with DPL was the diagnostic procedure of choice in 41% of those with blunt abdominal trauma in group 2. The complementary use of abdominal CT and DPL in those with blunt abdominal trauma decreased the rate of nontherapeutic celiotomy, did not result in a significant increase in missed injuries, and allowed identification of candidates for nonoperative management of solid organ injury.\r"

Ingested agents included hydrochloric acid in four patients, sulfuric acid in one patient, a strong alkali such as sodium hydroxide or Drano in 15 patients, liquid bleach in eight patients, detergents in four patients, and ammonia in two patients. Each patient underwent early fiberoptic endoscopic evaluation. The extent and severity of the injury varied according to the ingested agent. Seven patients who had second- or third-degree injury had surgery. One patient who ingested sulfuric acid required hemigastrectomy for pyloric stenosis. Two patients with Drano ingestion had necrosis of the stomach and required total gastrectomy. Five patients with strong alkali ingestion had esophageal strictures, and colonic interposition was performed on four of these patients. No patient who had ingested bleach, ammonia, or detergent required surgery. Panendoscopy after caustic ingestion can be performed safely and provides an accurate guide for therapy. The ingestion of strong acid or alkali may produce profound pathologic changes, which may require surgery for perforation or stricture. Bleach, detergent, and ammonia usually cause mild injuries that will respond with medical treatment.\r"

The 14 men and one woman ranged in age from 49 to 74 years. Indications for cholecystectomy included acute cholecystitis in nine patients and chronic cholecystitis in six patients. All patients had prior myocardial infarction, and in two patients this had occurred within 2 months of operation. All patients were Goldman's Class IV. Eight had severe cardiomyopathy. Mean ventricular ejection fraction was 21% +/- 3%. Cardiac index was 2.2 +/- 0.2 L/m/m2, and pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) was 51 +/- 5/23 +/- 2 mm Hg. After IABP placement, pulmonary wedge pressure decreased in all patients, from 24 +/- 3 mm Hg to 16 +/- 2 mm Hg (p less than 0.01). PAP systolic pressure decreased to 38 +/- 3 mm Hg (p less than 0.01), and PAP diastolic pressure decreased to 18 +/- 2 mm Hg (p less than 0.05). All patients had cholecystectomy. Five patients had intraoperative cholangiography. One of these five patients had a common bile duct exploration, and another underwent cystgastrostomy. Two patients died postoperatively of arrhythmias. Thirteen patients are alive 3 months to 7 years after operation, without biliary symptoms. Three patients have had orthotopic heart transplants. We conclude that IABP significantly improves cardiac performance so that many patients who have severe cardiac disease can undergo definitive biliary surgery.\r"

  ".U": "90020121\r", 
  ".W": "Admissions to hospital for childhood asthma have continued to increase, but the reasons are unknown. Because the incidence of acute asthmatic attacks in the community greatly exceeds the admission rate, this increase could be a result of changes in medical practice shifting the balance of care towards the hospital without there being any underlying change in morbidity. In the South West Thames Region (population 2.9 million) over the eight years 1978-85 the number of hospital admissions among those aged 0-4 and 5-14 rose by 186% and 56%. A random sample of case notes from all hospitals in the region was examined for evidence of changes in mode of referral, severity on admission (duration of episode, vital signs on admission), and readmission ratio. The findings indicate that there has been no reduction in severity on admission or increase in readmission rate since 1978. The findings for the 5-14 age group contrast with those from an earlier study (1970-8) in the same region, in which a substantial increase in self referral was observed together with an increase in readmissions and a reduction in the duration of the attack; pulse and respiration rates on admission have, however, remained unchanged over the 16 year period. Overall, these findings indicate that the increase in admissions cannot be satisfactorily explained by changes in medical practice alone and may be due to an increase in the number of asthmatic children experiencing severe attacks. This points to a change in the epidemiology of childhood asthma.\r"

Recurrent attenders (n = 145) had more severe asthma than control subjects (n = 118), with greater airway obstruction at rest (FEV1 79% v 85% predicted) and bronchial lability (47% v 38%). Significantly more of the \"emergency\" group used pressurised aerosols and fewer dry powder inhalers to administer bronchodilators. There were no differences in prophylactic treatment. Seventy one per cent of parents in the emergency group had feared that their child would die during an attack, compared with 56% of control subjects. Eighty one per cent of children were self referred to the accident and emergency department. Most parents had found hospital to be the quickest means of obtaining treatment in an emergency. There were no differences between the two groups in parents' knowledge about asthma, home conditions, or social disadvantage. Although children who repeatedly attend hospital accident and emergency departments for treatment of acute attacks have more severe asthma than controls and show some deficiencies in treatment, the major determinant of attendance appeared to be the parents' conviction that appropriate treatment could not be obtained elsewhere.\r"

There were 58 men and 38 women, aged 18-88 years. There was no significant difference between the three groups in the mean time in hospital or the period for which the drains were retained. The incidence of infection, persistent pneumothorax, and relapse while in hospital was also similar for the three groups. At follow-up in 1987-89 patients could be accounted for, with an average follow-up period of 4.6 years. The incidence of recurrence was 36% in the simple drainage group, 13% in the tetracycline pleurodesis group, and 8% in the talc pleurodesis group. The difference between the talc and simple drainage groups was significant. None of the methods caused severe short or long term side effects or changes in the follow-up chest radiograph. Thoracoscopy, performed on admission in 85 patients, showed normal appearances in 73 patients and small cysts in 12. The thoracoscopic findings were of no value in predicting recurrence. Talc pleurodesis resulted in a significantly lower recurrence rate than simple drainage, tetracycline pleurodesis having intermediate efficacy.\r"

After surgery patients developed a severe restrictive ventilatory defect and profound arterial hypoxaemia. There were no differences between the three groups. Mean FRC on day 2 was 1.90 litres (61% of the preoperative value), increasing to 2.32 1 by day 5 (76% of the preoperative value). The mean arterial oxygen tension was 7.37 kPa on day 2 and 8.58 kPa on day 4. Four patients in group 1, two in group 2, and five in group 3 developed a chest infection. It is concluded that the addition of breathing exercises or incentive spirometry to a regimen of early mobilisation and huffing and coughing confers no extra benefit after uncomplicated coronary artery bypass grafting.\r"

  ".W": "The purpose of this study was to evaluate the prevalence and type of lung function disorders in Danish farmers. Three samples of farmers were drawn from a group of unselected farmers who had participated in an epidemiological study. Group I (47 persons) was a sample of the 8% of all farmers who had reported that they had asthma; group II (63 persons) was a sample of the 28% of farmers who had had wheezing, shortness of breath, or cough without phlegm; and group III (34 persons) a sample of the farmers (64% of the total) who had no asthma and no respiratory symptoms. The farmers with symptoms (groups I and II) had low mean levels of FEV1 and high values for residual volume, whereas the symptomless farmers had normal lung function and no airways obstruction. The proportion of farmers with an FEV1 below the 95% confidence limit for predicted values was 43% in group I and 23% in group II; there were none in group III. Bronchial hyperreactivity to histamine occurred in 96% of asthmatic farmers, 67% of farmers with wheezing or shortness of breath, and 59% of symptomless farmers. A low level of FEV1 was associated with the number of years in pig farming and bronchial hyperreactivity in group II but not group I or III. Most of the bronchial hyperreactivity was explained in the multiple regression analysis by a low FEV1, though this was significant only for farmers in group II. Thus farmers who reported asthma, wheezing, shortness of breath, or a dry cough in general had airways obstruction with an increased residual volume, whereas symptomless farmers had normal lung function. Severe bronchial hyperreactivity was mostly explained by a diagnosis of asthma and poor lung function, though some farmers with normal lung function and no respiratory symptoms had increased bronchial reactivity.\r"
