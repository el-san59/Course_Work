  ".W": "Nonanastomotic hilar bile duct strictures developed in 16 of 152 patients who underwent liver transplantation. The type of pretransplantation liver disease did not significantly affect the likelihood of hilar stricture formation. Possible causes of hilar biliary strictures include hepatic artery occlusion, ductopenic arteriopathic rejection, and cytomegalovirus infection; however, five of the 16 patients had hilar strictures without these complications. Hilar strictures developed within 3 months after transplantation in 11 of the 16 patients. Strictures began as a slight common hepatic duct irregularity and progressed to mucosal cast formation and later to firm strictures. Fifteen of the 16 patients underwent percutaneous stricture dilation. Of 12 patients who no longer have stents, four have had no stricture recurrence for 12-30 months. Eight patients have had to undergo retransplantation or have died. Percutaneous dilations were most likely to result in patient bile ducts if strictures developed within 3 months after transplantation and in the absence of pretransplantation primary sclerosing cholangitis, ductopenic arteriopathic rejection, cytomegalovirus infection, or hepatic artery thrombosis.\r"

Nineteen patients who received external beam radiation as a salvage procedure after recurrence following surgery alone for pituitary adenomas were studied. At recurrence, nine patients underwent reexcision. All 19 patients underwent external beam irradiation for salvage. Within a median follow-up time of 11.8 years from the time of surgical failure, two patients have died of progressive adenoma, two are alive with disease progression, eight are alive without disease progression, and seven have died of intercurrent disease. The 5-, 10-, 15-, and 20-year overall actuarial (and progression-free) survival rates were 79% (90%), 62% (90%), 44% (80%), and 44% (53%), respectively. Dose of radiation, suprasellar extension at the time of surgical failure, and histologic findings had no bearing on prognosis. One patient developed a radiation-induced brain necrosis that was successfully resected. Radiation therapy can be an effective salvage modality for recurrent pituitary adenomas after surgical failure.\r"

  ".W": "A dynamic study of magnetic resonance (MR) imaging was used to obtain successive heavily T1-weighted coronal images (spin-echo [SE] 100/15 [repetition time msec/echo time msec]) of normal pituitary glands and pituitary adenoma immediately after patients were given an intravenous bolus injection of gadopentetate dimeglumine. The images were obtained every minute for 5-8 minutes at 1.5 T. Usual T1-weighted images (SE 600/15) were also obtained before and after the dynamic study was performed. The study group consisted of 18 patients, 10 with normal pituitary glands, and eight with pituitary adenoma. Normal pituitary glands showed maximum enhancement on the first or second image following the administration of gadopentetate dimeglumine, followed by gradual signal reduction through the later images, whereas pituitary adenomas reached a peak of enhancement later and showed slower signal reduction than normal pituitaries. The difference of enhancement patterns between the normal pituitary gland and the pituitary adenoma produced prominent image contrast on the first or second image after administration of gadopentetate dimeglumine, which improved the visualization of one microadenoma and four normal pituitary glands that had been displaced by large adenomas. Dynamic MR imaging is a useful diagnostic procedure not only for detection of microadenomas, but also for visualization of pituitary glands that have been displaced by large pituitary adenomas.\r"

PET complemented MR imaging, in the sense that five of the positive PET readings were negative or questionable at MR imaging.

Two- and three-dimensional flow-compensated gradient-echo sequences were employed to create \"bright blood\" images. A thin-section spin-echo sequence with flow presaturation allowed the creation of black blood images. Projection angiograms were made from bright and black blood images with application of a maximum- or minimum-intensity projection algorithm, respectively. These methods were used in 13 healthy volunteers and 17 patients, and a prospective blinded comparison of MR angiography and conventional angiography was performed. Normal carotid arteries were well shown with both bright and black blood methods; in patients, both methods were sensitive for detecting carotid disease. However, bright blood angiography exaggerated the severity of carotid lesions in 13 of 33 arteries, mostly in severe disease; this problem was not encountered with black blood angiography. The authors conclude that bright blood angiography is a sensitive method for screening carotid disease; when a significant abnormality is found, black blood angiography should be performed for more precise delineation of the lesion.\r"

Advanced techniques were used for embolization, including real-time digital subtraction angiofluoroscopy; directable microcatheters; and a mixture of microfibrillar collagen, polyvinyl alcohol sponge microparticles, and ethanol, in addition to acrylic glue. Embolization caused a permanent deficit in four patients (10.5%) (quadrantanopia [n = 3], cerebellar ataxia [n = 1]). Thirty-two patients (84%) underwent surgery after embolization, and 28 (74%) were completely cured, as assessed with postsurgical angiography. Twenty-five patients (66%) had either no deficit or no change in deficit after treatment. Two patients had worsening of a previous deficit after postembolization resection, two patients had mild weakness not previously present, and five patients had visual field defects. One patient developed Gerstmann syndrome after resection, and one patient with ataxia after embolization also had ataxia after surgical resection. Two patients died of complications due to surgical resection. Most of the AVMs in this series were large and complex. Embolization used predominantly as a preoperative procedure enabled complete resection, as achieved in the majority of these cases.\r"

T2-weighted MR imaging was done at 0.5, 1.5, 2.0, and 4.7 T. Relative assessment of iron concentration was made from the optical density of brain sections stained with the Perls' method intensified with diaminobenzidine. MR imaging and optical density measurements were made in the centrum semiovale (white matter) and in four gray matter areas: the insular cortex, caudate nucleus, putamen, and globus pallidus, the latter three of which accumulate significant iron deposits with age. High optical density and decreased signal intensity were found in these areas, and the inverse correlation between gray matter/white matter signal ratio and optical density was in good agreement with the theory of T2 shortening caused by diffusion of water through magnetic inhomogeneities. However, the dependence of T2 shortening on field strength was not quadratic, as expected for paramagnetic iron, but instead showed a marked leveling off at higher field strengths. This magnetic \"saturation\" is explainable by antiferromagnetism and superparamagnetism of the ferritin core and has been observed in ferritin solutions at low temperatures. Similar observations at body temperature are needed before the iron-ferritin explanation for T2 shortening can be considered proved.\r"

A method was devised to quantify meniscus displacement in terms of the number of degrees from a 12 o'clock or vertical position (relative to the condyle). The distribution of meniscus positions defined two groups in this asymptomatic study group. A strong correlation between abnormal joints and a history of orthodontics led to the exclusion of subjects with a history of orthodontics, and those with mouth trauma were also excluded, leaving a better \"normal control\" group. The junction of the posterior band of the meniscus and the bilaminar zone should fall within 10 degrees of vertical to be within the 95th percentile of normal.\r"

However, significant differences in tissue characteristics within the meniscus itself may cause a confusing appearance that is not easily reconciled with available anatomic references. Six cadaveric TMJ specimens were imaged sagittally at 1.5 T with various combinations of repetition time and echo time and with use of both standard surface coils and a specially developed solenoidal specimen coil. Corresponding histologic sections were correlated with the in vitro MR images to identify the anatomic structure and tissue characteristics. Comparison of these in vitro images with in vivo images of 100 joints identified a vertical, linear, low-signal-intensity band as an important landmark of the junction of the posterior band and bilaminar zone. Recognition of the signal-intensity characteristics of the center and the surfaces of the posterior band as well as the appearance of the insertion of the bilaminar zone also increased confidence of visualization and helped avoid possible false-positive diagnoses.\r"

Antibiotic therapy leads to the resolution of both cutaneous and systemic manifestations. Of 17 HIV-infected patients with cutaneous lesions of bacillary angiomatosis, six (35%) had symptomatic osteolytic bone lesions that improved following antibiotic therapy. The authors describe the appearance of the bone lesions on radiographs, computed tomographic (CT) scans, magnetic resonance (MR) images, and radionuclide studies. Osteolytic lesions are a relatively common feature of bacillary angiomatosis in patients with HIV infection. The presence of bone lesions aids in differentiation of bacillary angiomatosis from acquired immunodeficiency syndrome-related Kaposi sarcoma, which has similar cutaneous abnormalities but no associated bone lesions.\r"

Two to four distinct patterns were identified in each anatomic area on spin-echo images obtained with a short repetition time and a short echo time. The relative frequency of the patterns for different age groups is consistent with the known physiologic conversion from cellular to fatty marrow with advancing age. Knowledge of these patterns should help in the interpretation of MR images of the axial skeleton.\r"

Before surgery, every patient was evaluated with plain radiography; after surgery, every patient was evaluated at weekly or biweekly intervals with standard plain anteroposterior and lateral radiography, with acquisition of additional radiographs centered over the distraction site. Every patient had complete bone healing, which took 3-14 months. In all patients, new bone formation was evident within 15 weeks after surgery. Complications associated with the Ilizarov technique were minimal (delayed formation in two cases and cyst formation within the distraction site in two cases), but success relies heavily on radiographic evaluation. Radiographs of the whole bone or joint must be obtained for overall assessment of bone alignment; specific views of the distraction site, with the x-ray beam centered over this site, may be required.\r"

The average duration of each infusion was 10.4 days. There were eight procedure-related complications, but none precluded completion of intraarterial chemotherapy. Limb-sparing surgery was performed on 25 patients. At a mean follow-up of over 2 years, there was one local recurrence. Among limb-salvage patients with stage II disease, 90% (18 of 20) survived and 75% (15 of 20) are disease-free. Compared with patients from previous studies, this technique permits a high percentage of patients with osteosarcoma to undergo limb-sparing resection without compromise of local disease control or survival.\r"

  ".W": "Fusion of the DNA-binding domain of yeast GAL4 protein to the amino terminus of bacteriophage T7 RNA polymerase yields a chimera that retains the characteristics of its components. The presence of the GAL4 peptide allows the chimeric enzyme to anchor itself on the DNA template, and this anchoring in turn drives the formation of a supercoiled DNA loop, in linear or circular templates, when RNA synthesis at the polymerase site forces a translocation of the DNA relative to the site. Nonspecific interaction between the chimeric enzyme and DNA appears to be sufficient to effect supercoiling during transcription. Transcription by the chimeric polymerase is strictly dependent on the presence of a T7 promoter; thus it provides a tool in vitro and in vivo for specifically supercoiling DNA segments containing T7 promoter sequences.\r"

NK cells are able to recognize and lyse various virally infected or neoplastic target cells without previous sensitization or major histocompatibility complex restriction. A 60-kD disulfide-linked dimer, highly expressed on NK cells, was found capable of mediating transmembrane signaling. The gene encoding this signal transduction molecule was cloned and its nucleotide sequence determined. The encoded protein showed significant homology with a number of lectin-related membrane proteins that share receptor characteristics. This protein may function as a receptor able to selectively trigger NK cell activity.\r"

It is therefore thought that these proteins function in development through the stable activation of genes that define specific developmental pathways. Evidence is provided here for an alternative mode of action. The primary structure of SCIP, a POU protein expressed by developing Schwann cells of the peripheral nervous system, was deduced and SCIP activity was studied. Both in normal development and in response to nerve transection, SCIP expression was transiently activated only during the period of rapid cell division that separates the premyelinating and myelinating phases of Schwann cell differentiation. In cotransfection assays, SCIP acted as a transcriptional repressor of myelin-specific genes.\r"

Oocytes injected with GAT-1 synthetic messenger RNA accumulated [3H]GABA to levels above control values. The transporter encoded by GAT-1 has a high affinity for GABA, is sodium-and chloride-dependent, and is pharmacologically similar to neuronal GABA transporters. The GAT-1 protein shares antigenic determinants with a native rat brain GABA transporter. The nucleotide sequence of GAT-1 predicts a protein of 599 amino acids with a molecular weight of 67 kilodaltons. Hydropathy analysis of the deduced protein suggests multiple transmembrane regions, a feature shared by several cloned transporters; however, database searches indicate that GAT-1 is not homologous to any previously identified proteins. Therefore, GAT-1 appears to be a member of a previously uncharacterized family of transport molecules.\r"

The growth characteristics and associated symptomatology of these tumors are variable, and often they do not give rise to a typical jugular foramen syndrome, making differentiation from other low cerebellopontine angle tumors difficult and occasionally impossible. One tumor presented mainly in the neck, but the remaining 13 were predominantly intracranial and their anatomical relationships as defined radiologically determined the surgical approach used. Nine tumors were resected using a posterior fossa approach, three required a combined posterior fossa and neck dissection, and one a combined supratentorial and infratentorial craniotomy. The aim of operation was total excision of the tumor, which was achieved in 10 patients; the remaining three all suffered recurrence. There was no operative mortality and little long-term disability.\r"

In our patients, only part of the frontal corpus callosum needed to be sectioned to interrupt the bilateral synchrony of epileptic discharge. Of the 35 patients, operated on, 28 have had an adequate long-term follow up and are presented herein. All had significant improvement in seizure frequency and psychosocial functioning.\r"

On the speech-dominant side, electrical stimulation was given to demarcate the speech-related areas in the lateral temporal cortex. Based on these data, the extent of surgical resections was tailored to include as much of the epileptogenic areas as possible while preserving the functionally essential zones of the lateral cortex. According to the range of resection, three different approaches were employed for en bloc ablation of the lateral cortex and opening of the inferior ventricle. The results thus acquired have been satisfactory in terms of seizure control and the preservation of speech function.\r"

When the aneurysm is small, the bifurcation of the internal carotid artery can be exposed by dissecting along the internal carotid artery from a proximal-to-distal direction. The aneurysm and the perforating vessels adjacent to it are identified before the aneurysm is clipped. When the aneurysm is not small or if the intracranial segment of the internal carotid artery is long, the sylvian fissure has to be dissected open before dissection of the aneurysm and perforators is undertaken. Using this dissection strategy, 18 bifurcations of internal carotid artery aneurysms were clipped with 16 excellent, one good, and one fair result. There was no mortality.\r"

Studies conducted across treatment centers would help ensure that the sample is representative of the population to which the predictor measure is to be applied in the future. The criterion by which functional outcome has been measured has varied. Many studies have measured function on discharge, while others have measured improvement in function. If interest lies with improvement in function, it is important to identify factors that predict which patients have greater (or less) than predicted recovery. If interest lies with the prediction of function at a particular point after the stroke, function should not be measured at discharge (since length of hospital stay varies enormously) but at a set time poststroke. Future studies should use scales whose reliability and validity is well established.\r"

Survival studies have shown that stroke patients who live through the acute phase after onset survive long enough to warrant rehabilitation. The most important overall conclusion from scientific studies of predictors of stroke rehabilitation outcome is that the identified predictors were not accurate enough to predict gains in the rehabilitation process or the disposition of the individuals at discharge. Instead, these predictors can only be used in a statistical sample to describe the general criteria of those patients who would do better versus those who would do worse in rehabilitation. Some of these general indicators include those that seem to have no effect on rehabilitation outcomes--age, sex, amount of paralysis, side of brain involved, and place of residence at the time of the stroke. Those factors for which the effects are still unknown are race and prolonged specialized training period in either proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation or percent-concept organization and motor output training. Factors that positively affect rehabilitation outcomes are good family support and financial status, higher socioeconomic and educational levels, early referral to rehabilitation, and the type of rehabilitation center (comprehensive rehabilitation center versus nursing home).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The determinants of outcome depend to a great extent on factors other than the nature and extent of the impairment. It seems that the patient's subjective perception of himself as either well or ill may be a major determinant of subsequent behavior in terms of functional dependence (disability). 2. What people are able to do at 6 months or more after the completion of formal rehabilitation is the real measure of its effectiveness. 3. An index of \"quality of life\" based on, for example, the concepts of the Frenchay index is needed to evaluate the role and function of people in community living.\r"

Ninety-two percent of the patients who underwent exercise testing had abnormal (greater than 1 mm ST) depression and/or positive results on scintigraphy. Long coronary arteriotomy (5 to 12 cm), endarterectomy and reconstruction of the left anterior descending artery and its branches, were performed in 121 patients; of the left circumflex artery and its branches in 13 patients; and of the right coronary artery and its branches beyond the crux in 18 patients. Single endarterectomy and reconstruction was performed in 109 patients, double in 20 and triple in 1. The operative mortality was 2.3% and the perioperative infarction was 1.5%. Twenty-four patients (among them 38% who had undergone greater than 1 previous bypass operation) were randomly selected and studied within 20 days after surgery. This group comprised a total of 69 coronary conduits of which 68 (99%) were patent, and a total of 206 coronary anastomoses of which 202 (98%) were patent. Thirty-two of 33 conduits (97%) to endarterectomized and reconstructed arteries were patent. One hundred and twenty-six of 127 patients were followed up for a mean of 20 months; 120 of the 121 patients (99%) were in angina class I by Canadian Cardiovascular Society classification, and 63 of 71 patients (89%) had a normal treadmill exercise stress test.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Fifty-two patients (50%) had anterior infarctions, 70 (67%) had significant narrowing in greater than 1 vessel, and 12 (11%) were in cardiogenic shock. Primary success was achieved in 91% of the infarct-related arteries. Four patients with failed PTCA underwent emergency bypass surgery; 10 had early symptomatic reocclusion of the dilated vessel. There was 1 death acutely in the catheterization laboratory. The overall in-hospital mortality was 18%. Three-vessel coronary artery disease and cardiogenic shock on presentation were the strongest predictors of in-hospital death. Global ejection fraction improved from 54 +/- 13 to 61 +/- 15% (p less than 0.001). The 1- and 5-year survival rates, including in-hospital deaths, were 73 and 67%, respectively. It is concluded that direct PTCA is an effective means of salvaging ischemic myocardium during acute myocardial infarction in the elderly patient. It is associated with a high success rate and low complication rate. The short- and long-term survival in this high-risk group of patients are improved compared with survival rates in historical controls.\r"

During 24 hours of ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring, 101 symptomatic and 298 asymptomatic ischemic episodes (ST-segment depression greater than 1 mm, duration greater than 1 minute) were observed. The number of ischemic episodes and the cumulative duration of ischemia showed a circadian variation with the highest values between 8 and 10 A.M. and between 4 and 5 P.M. associated with a similar circadian variation of heart rate. Mean duration of ischemic episodes, maximal amplitude of ST-segment depression during ischemic episodes and increase in heart rate before the onset of ischemic episodes showed no significant circadian variation. Heart rate at the onset of ischemic episodes and maximal heart rate during ischemic episodes were lower between midnight and A.M. than during other times of the day. The morning and afternoon increase in ischemic activity is not paralleled by changes reflecting a decrease in myocardial oxygen supply during these periods (heart rate at onset of ischemia, heart rate increase before onset of ischemia), but is paralleled by a similar circadian variation of heart rate. The circadian variation in ischemic activity is predominantly based on a comparable variation in myocardial oxygen requirements.\r"

Eleven patients (33%) died, 5 suddenly (15%) and 6 from nonarrhythmic causes. Five patients (15%) had nonfatal recurrences of VT.

Transient dilation ratio was calculated from planar anterior images by dividing the computer-derived left ventricular area on the initial image by that of the 4-hour image. In 11 patients with normal coronary arteriograms or less than 50% coronary stenosis, the transient dilation ratio was 0.98 +/- 0.046. An abnormal transient dilation ratio was defined as greater than or equal to 1.12, representing greater than or equal to 3 standard deviations above the mean normal value. When the 15 patients with an abnormal ratio were compared with the 58 with a normal ratio, the former group had a significantly higher frequency of 3 critical (greater than or equal to 90%) coronary stenoses (33 vs 5%), higher prevalence of collaterals (67 vs 24%), more extensive myocardial reversible defects by planar (71 vs 10%) or by single-photon emission computed tomography (87.5 vs 35%) imaging and a higher incidence of dipyridamole-induced anginal chest pain (53 vs 22%). No significant difference between the 2 groups was noted with respect to age, gender, prior myocardial infarction, single or double critical coronary stenosis, dipyridamole-induced ischemic electrocardiographic response and increased lung uptake. An abnormal transient dilation ratio of greater than or equal to 1.12 was a specific marker of multivessel (87%) or 3-vessel (85%) critical coronary artery disease.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Angiographic findings related to presence of ST-T-wave abnormalities included severe coronary obstruction (less than 70%), higher number of diseased vessels, and the presence of obstruction in the left anterior descending coronary artery. In a multivariate model, the most significant correlates of ST-T-wave abnormalities were presence of left ventricular contraction abnormality, followed by age, gender, presence of left anterior descending coronary artery disease, elevated end-systolic volume index, and a diagnosis of hypertension.

We found a significant correlation (p less than 0.01) between VT cycle-lengths on the 2 agents as well as the percent change in cycle length from baseline. Only 60% of the patients exhibited VT rates within 10% between the 2 agents. Importantly, less than 20% of patients had further slowing of the VT rate (greater than 10% slowing) during amiodarone therapy as compared to procainamide. Thus, although the cycle-length response of VT to procainamide correlates with the cycle-length response to amiodarone, 40% of patients have a disparate response (greater than 10% difference in cycle length) to the 2 agents; additional slowing of VT rates in response to amiodarone beyond that seen with procainamide is unlikely. These results have important implications regarding the institution of amiodarone therapy and the need for repeat electrophysiologic testing during amiodarone therapy.\r"

In 5 of the 7 cases rare AF direction was clockwise (craniocaudal in the septum and posterior wall and caudocranial on the lateral and anterior walls). In 2 cases rare AF direction was counterclockwise (caudocranial in the septum and posterior wall and craniocaudal in the lateral and anterior walls). Both common AF rotated counterclockwise. A \"line\" of conduction delay or block was present in both clockwise and counterclockwise circuits between the posterior and lateral walls, in the probable location of the crista terminalis. This line of block extended the central obstacle made by the inferior vena cava toward, but perhaps not all the way to, the superior vena cava, making activation rotate roughly around the tricuspid ring. The ridge between the inferior vena cava and the tricuspid ring was a critical anatomic \"closing\" point in all clockwise and counterclockwise circuits. Right atrial macroreentry underlies rare AF. Direction of activation tends to be opposite to that in common AF. The cause of the positive deflection is unclear.\r"

Reviewers who were blinded to echocardiographic and Doppler data classified 51 patients (59%) as unstable because of the development of angina, congestive heart failure, syncope or hypotension with the onset of AF. Echocardiographic and Doppler data on transmitral blood flow velocity were analyzed by a single reviewer who was blinded to other clinical data. Multiple logistic regression analysis identified 3 variables as independent predictors of clinical instability with the onset of AF: (1) history of prior myocardial infarction (p less than 0.02); (2) echocardiographic evidence of left ventricular dysfunction (p less than 0.03); and (3) Doppler evidence of increased atrial filling fraction (p less than 0.0001). An atrial filling fraction threshold of 0.40 had a sensitivity for predicting clinical instability of 80% and a specificity of 72%. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that patients who are more dependent on the atrial contribution to ventricular filling are at increased risk of instability with AF due to the loss of atrial systole.\r"

Induced ventricular arrhythmias were not reproducible in 45% of group I patients, despite restudy at nearly identical therapeutic plasma concentrations of an identical antiarrhythmic agent. Induced arrhythmias were also not reproducible in 16% of group II patients. This variability could not be attributed to the electrophysiologic characteristics of the patients studied.

This study compared cardiovascular responses to exercise in normotensive men (aged 28 +/- 0.8 years [mean +/- standard error of the mean]) at high risk (positive parental history and high normal resting blood pressure [BP], n = 20) and at low risk (negative history, low normal BP, n = 15) of hypertension. All men had normal body weight and exercise tolerance. During graded supine bicycle exercise, 35% (7 of 20) of high-risk men had exaggerated BP responses (greater than or equal to 230/100 mm Hg) versus 0% of low-risk men, thus forming 3 groups (low risk, high-risk normal BP response, high-risk exaggerated response). Cardiac function was measured by nuclear cardiography. Cardiac index, peripheral resistance index, left ventricular ejection fraction and contractility index were measured at rest and during each exercise work load. High-risk exaggerated responders could not be distinguished from their high-risk normal-responding counterparts using resting BP or other cardiovascular variables. During exercise all 3 groups had equivalent increases in cardiac output. However, the high-risk exaggerated responders had blunting in peripheral resistance decline, resulting in excessive BP increases. This finding suggests an impaired capacity for exercise-induced vasodilation, indicating that the exaggerated response group may be at highest risk for future hypertension in these 3 groups.\r"

  ".W": "This study analyzes the clinical, echocardiographic and hemodynamic factors affecting progression of mitral regurgitation (MR) after transarterial balloon valvuloplasty in 200 consecutive patients with rheumatic mitral stenosis. After valvuloplasty, the mitral valve area increased in all patients, from 1.03 +/- 0.36 to 2.06 +/- 0.71 cm2 (p less than 0.0001). With regard to the basal stage, the mitral valve was competent in 139 patients and there was mild MR in 61 (grade I in 53, and grade II in 8). Three patients had progression of MR induced by a technical deficiency and they were excluded from analysis. Patients were classified into 2 groups on the basis of the degree of MR before and after valvuloplasty: group A--no progression of MR (n = 167; 85%) when the degree of MR did not change, disappeared after valvuloplasty, or increased from grade 0 to I; group B--progression of MR (n = 30; 15%) when the degree of MR increased to greater than or equal to grade II. Progression of MR was observed more frequently in older patients with presence of chronic atrial fibrillation, larger left atrial size and left ventricular volumes, baseline MR, more severe stenosis and a lower ejection fraction. Multivariate analysis selected age, left ventricular volumes and ejection fraction as independent predictors of progression of MR. All these factors suggest that progression of MR after balloon valvuloplasty could be related to a more advanced degree of disease.\r"

In patients with arrhythmogenic RV cardiomyopathy and biventricular dilated cardiomyopathy, the diagnosis was confirmed by endomyocardial biopsy. All RV values overlapped for the diagnosis of atrial septal defect and arrhythmogenic RV cardiomyopathy; overlapping extended to dilated cardiomyopathy for end-diastolic volume and infundibular dimensions. RV ejection fraction appeared reduced in all the diseases; in particular, mean values in dilated cardiomyopathy and arrhythmogenic RV cardiomyopathy were 38 and 53%, respectively (p less than 0.05). Left ventricular quantitative studies showed a significant difference between dilated and arrhythmogenic RV cardiomyopathy, both in terms of pumping indexes (mean end-diastolic volumes 180 vs 91 ml/m2 and mean ejection fraction 33 vs 60%), and indexes of contractility (stress/end-diastolic volume 3.7 vs 6.7). Multivariate analysis disclosed that transversally arranged hypertrophic trabeculae, separated by deep fissures, were associated with the highest probability of arrhythmogenic RV cardiomyopathy (p less than 0.001). Posterior subtricuspid and anterior infundibular wall bulgings were the only other independently significant variables. Coexistence of these signs was associated with 96% specificity and 87.5% sensitivity. Thus, arrhythmogenic RV cardiomyopathy presents quantitative volumetric and hemodynamic as well as qualitative features that clearly distinguish it from dilated cardiomyopathy and confirm its nosographic autonomy among the primary diseases of the myocardium.\r"

After Swan-Ganz and radial arterial cannulation, 13 patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy performed maximal exercise tests after diuretic (frusemide 20 mg intravenously) and after fluid loading (0.9% saline at 10 ml/kg body weight intravenously) on different days. At rest, right atrial and pulmonary capillary wedge pressures increased with volume loading and decreased with a diuretic. There were no significant changes in the resting, supine cardiac or stroke indexes but in the upright position, the cardiac index and stroke index were higher after volume loading (2.5 +/- 0.7 vs 2.2 +/- 0.5 liters/min/m2, p less than 0.05; 33 +/- 11 vs 27 +/- 9 ml/m2, p less than 0.005, respectively). Although the right atrial, pulmonary arterial and pulmonary capillary wedge pressures were higher during exercise after volume loading, there were no significant differences in exercise heart rate, systemic blood pressure, cardiac index, stroke index, systemic vascular resistance index or overall exercise capacity compared to exercise after diuresis. The data show that the cardiac index and stroke index, at supine rest and during upright exercise, were not influenced by the preload changes induced in these patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. The results suggest that these patients are operating on the plateau of left ventricular Frank-Starling function (filling pressure/output) curve.\r"

The study population was predominantly female (86%) and young (mean age, 27.4 years), and they were observed for a mean of 6.5 years from the inception of dialysis. At the time dialysis was initiated, only 21 patients (35.6%) had clinically active systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). The remaining patients progressed to ESRD despite the absence of clinical lupus activity. Lupus activity was clinically apparent in 55.4% of patients in the first year, 6.5% in the fifth, and none in the tenth year. In 45% of patients, lupus activity was clinically inactive at entry to ESRD and remained inactive throughout the observation period. Serological activity declined proportionally, but to a lesser extent than clinical activity. Cumulative patient survival was 81.1% and 74.6% at the fifth and tenth year, respectively, from the inception of dialysis treatment; similarly it was 78% at the fifth and tenth year after the transplantation. Graft survival was 60.4% at the fifth and 45.5% at the tenth year. No one had recurrence of clinical lupus nephritis in the graft for up to 16 years of follow-up. Fourteen patients died from either infectious or cardiovascular complications, but none from SLE per se. This long-term study with a large number of lupus patients confirms our previous findings that the progression of renal disease to ESRD may be mediated by nonimmunologic mechanisms, as well as immunologic insults.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

However, there was no difference in the proliferation of cells incubated with sera from IgA-CIC-positive patients and negative controls. IgA-CIC-positive and negative IgA isolates both stimulated proliferation of mesangial cells at 24 hours' incubation. Our data do not support the hypothesis that IgA-CIC are directly responsible for mesangial cell proliferation.\r"

  ".W": "We evaluated our experience over a 4-year period with a silicone dual-lumen catheter with a Dacron cuff (SDLCDC) to determine if the catheter represents an alternative to the polytetrafluoroethylene graft for long-term vascular access for hemodialysis patients. Records of 131 patients who used 168 catheters were reviewed for catheter function, duration of use, and occurrence and response to treatment of complications. Eighty-five percent of catheters functioned adequately until their use was no longer required or the end of the study. One-year catheter survival estimate was 65% and median survival estimate was 18.5 months. Mean blood flow rate achieved was 243 mL/min and recirculation was 7.5%. Exit-site infection occurred in 21% of patients and bacteremia in 12%. There were significantly more exit-site infections in diabetics than nondiabetics (33% v 11%, P less than 0.02). Exit-site infections resolved with parenteral antibiotic therapy in 90% and bacteremia in 25% of cases without catheter removal. Unresolved bacteremia was the most common cause of catheter removal and led to the loss of 7% of catheters. Thrombotic complications occurred in 46% of catheters. Urokinase instillation successfully treated catheter occlusion in 81% of cases. When urokinase instillation failed, streptokinase infusion restored catheter patency 97% of the time. The literature on the polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) graft was reviewed, and the SDLCDC was found to be similar to the graft in function, duration of use, and frequency of infectious and thrombotic complications. We conclude that the catheter represents an alternative to the graft for long-term vascular access in hemodialysis patients. Because of the frequent complications with both accesses, neither should be considered optimal. Further research is required to improve vascular access for patients in whom placement of an arteriovenous fistula is not possible.\r"

Continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) was the preferred mode of chronic dialysis in all the patients. Survival after diagnosis was 32.2 +/- 23.9 months. Survival after starting dialysis was 24.6 +/- 20.6 months. All patients on CAPD were adequately dialyzed and in good fluid control. Peritonitis was the main problem on CAPD (one episode per 5.6 patient-months). The majority of peritonitis episodes responded to intraperitoneal antibiotic therapy. One patient with Staphylococcus aureus peritonitis, septicemia, and neutropenia secondary to chemotherapy, died. Recommendations for prophylaxis and treatment of peritonitis are given. Three patients were transferred to hemodialysis. The use of subclavian vein catheters during hemodialysis was associated with a high incidence of gram-positive septicemia. Alkylating agent-based chemotherapy resulted in hematological responses in five patients. Survival after diagnosis in those responders was 47.4 +/- 25.6 months, compared with 17.0 +/- 7.2 months in the nonresponders (P less than 0.05). All responders subsequently relapsed. Four patients died with progressive myeloma. Bone marrow suppression resulted in a high blood transfusion requirement, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia associated with bleeding into the gastrointestinal tract and central nervous system. Uremic myeloma patients can be adequately dialyzed using CAPD. Those patients who do not have an initial hematological response have a poor prognosis.\r"

Diabetes was induced by intravenous injection of streptozotocin (SZ), 65 mg/kg. Rats were divided in four groups fed diets containing 11% fat for 38 weeks. Dietary fat derived from four sources: beef tallow (BT; rich in saturated fatty acids), evening primrose oil (EPO; rich in gamma linolenic [GLA] and linoleic acids [LA]), safflower oil (SO; rich in LA), and fish oil (FO; rich in eicosapentaenoic [EPA] and docosahexaenoic [DHA] acids). Ultralente insulin was administered every other day to maintain the blood glucose levels between 11.1 and 22.2 mmol/L (200 and 400 mg/dL). The diets prepared with EPO and SO had a clear beneficial effect on proteinuria, glomerular sclerosis, and tubular abnormalities, as compared with BT. Both diets also increased the ratio of renal cortical production of 6-keto-PGF1 alpha to thromboxane B2 (TXB2), the stable metabolites of PGI2 and TXA2, respectively. They did not induce significant changes in plasma lipid composition. The FO diet did not have an effect on renal disease, but decreased plasma lipids and inhibited eicosanoid synthesis by platelets and kidney cortex. FO feeding was associated with a lowered 6-keto-PGF1 alpha/TXB2 ratio. It is concluded that high LA diets are protective in this model of diabetic nephropathy. The effect may be secondary to modifications of the eicosanoid balance. Diets containing FO have a beneficial effect on plasma lipids in this model.\r"

B95-8 EBV was inoculated intraperitoneally and intravenously to the mice 6 weeks after transfer of seronegative PBMC. Three of four mice transferred with PBMC from two EBV-seropositive donors and two of four mice from two EBV-seronegative donors inoculated with EBV developed fatal EBV-induced lymphoproliferative disease within 6 to 10 weeks. These tumors were oligoclonal or polyclonal by cytoplasmic immunoglobulin expression. Furthermore no consistent clonal chromosomal abnormalities were shown. Cell lines established from these tumors showed low cloning efficiency in soft agarose. In addition, latent membrane protein, B-lymphocyte activation antigen (CD23), and cell-adhesion molecules (ICAM-1, CD18) all were expressed in the EBV-positive infiltrating lymphoproliferative lesions in each mouse. These results suggest that lymphoid tumors are comparable to lymphoblastoid cell lines immortalized by EBV and are not malignant lymphomas such as Burkitt's lymphoma. This model may be useful for investigating mechanisms responsible for the growing numbers of lymphoproliferative diseases that are occurring in patients with inherited or acquired immunodeficiencies.\r"

A pure sample of 1 mg long crocidolite (greater than 2.5 mu) induced pulmonary fibrosis in 8 weeks, but secretions of lavaged AM from these lungs did not enhance growth or collagen synthesis in cultured rat lung fibroblasts. In contrast, the same dose of short fibers did not produce pulmonary fibrosis, although AM lavaged from these lungs were increased in number, had more phagocytized fibers, and when incubated, secreted factors that stimulated fibroblasts in culture. When normal AM were exposed to these fiber samples for 24 hours in vitro, greater phagocytosis of particles occurred and each asbestos fiber sample induced secretion of an AM-derived growth factor for cultured fibroblasts. The results indicate that both long and short fibers are capable of inducing AM to secrete fibrogenic factors in vitro, but in vivo, cytokine secretion by AM into the alveolar spaces in response to short fibers is not associated with stimulation of the interstitial fibroblast. In contrast, pulmonary fibrosis after long fiber administration appears unrelated to an AM secretion and is probably caused by fiber penetration into the peribronchiolar tissue, where interstitial macrophage activation may occur over several weeks.\r"

The modified lipidic pattern is characterized by a significant increase in the total amounts of cholesterol, phospholipids, and triglycerides, despite a normal lipidic plasma profile. Histochemical studies showed that lipid droplets are accumulated in the cytoplasm of deeply situated cells and in the extracellular matrix. These findings support the idea that lipids may be trapped within the pseudo-intima of synthetic vascular grafts, even in the absence of a major plasma lipid disorder, and contribute to the prosthesis failure.\r"

Glomerular size correlated with mesangial sclerosis and the urine albumin/creatinine ratio. The glomerular lesions consisted of mesangial proliferation (4 to 5 weeks) followed by progressive mesangial sclerosis (19 weeks), resulting in complete glomerulosclerosis at 30 to 37 weeks. Albuminuria paralleled the glomerulosclerosis. In contrast, mice transgenic for insulinlike growth factor-I (IGF-I mice) did not develop glomerulosclerosis, even though glomerular size significantly increased. Glomerular hypertrophy, however, did not reach that in GH mice. These data suggest that high levels of circulating GH lead to a disproportionate increase in glomerular cellularity and volume, as well as glomerulosclerosis. This does not appear to be the result of high levels of circulating IGF-I stimulated by GH, as the serum IGF-I level in GH mice was lower than that in IGF-I mice.\r"

However, examples of polyclonal carcinomas or adenomas raise the possibility that histologically similar lesions may arise through different pathogenetic mechanisms. The authors have performed a clonal analysis of histologically benign and malignant thyroid nodules in seven women using HPRT (hypoxanthine phosphoribosyl transferase) and PGK (phosphoglycerate kinase) restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs) on the X chromosome. These RFLPs used in concert with methylation-sensitive restriction endonucleases HpaII and HhaI permit distinction of active and inactive X chromosomes. DNA from a multinodular goiter showed equal sensitivity of both X chromosome RFLP alleles to a methylation-sensitive restriction endonuclease, consistent with a polyclonal origin. In contrast, three solitary follicular nodules and three carcinomas displayed predominant sensitivity of a single RFLP allele, consistent with a monoclonal origin. Although further detailed studies will be necessary to understand polyclonal origins reported for some adenomas, our data from a limited number of samples supports a predominantly monoclonal origin, and possible neoplastic pathogenesis, for many solitary adenomatous nodules in the thyroid.\r"

On cellular DNA transfection, a series of cell lines have been isolated that grow in drug-selective medium. Representative transfected cell lines all yield tumors in rats that consist predominantly of spindle cells, but two also contain epithelial-like cells and glandlike elements (C18P, C19P). Immunocytochemical staining for milk fat globule membrane antigens, human callus keratin, and laminin confirms the identity of the epithelial cells and suggests a (myo)epithelial origin for the spindle cells. Some of the transfected cell lines also generate well-differentiated metaplastic elements in their tumors. One cell line (CT4-41) produces rhabdomyoblastic and possibly smooth-muscle-related elements; two (C18P, C19P) produce squamous metaplasia and sebaceous elements; and two (CL1-31, C11P) produce cartilaginous elements. The identities of the heterologous elements are confirmed by immunocytochemical staining for myoglobin, actin (CT4-41), keratin (C18P, C19P), type II collagen, and type II keratan sulfate (CL1-31). Those cell lines that have acquired the ability to metastasize from subcutaneous sites (CT4-41, C18P) reproduce the same metaplastic elements in their metastases. Thus, a cloned mammary epithelial cell line can be made to generate many of the well-differentiated, heterologous elements observed in human breast carcinomas, and this change is often associated with the rat cells acquiring metastatic properties.\r"

Previously we suggested that the site of entry of lymphocytes into rejecting kidney allografts is the peritubular but not other capillary endothelium. Here we confirm this observation in a frozen section ex vivo binding assay and further characterize the peritubular capillary endothelium during acute kidney allograft rejection. The increase in lymphocyte binding to peritubular capillaries precede the peak of inflammation (leukocyte accumulation) in the graft. Pretreatment of lymphocytes with antibodies against CD 11a and CD 18 (LFA-1 alpha and beta chain, respectively) could decrease the lymphocyte binding, whereas ICAM-1 pretreatment of tissue sections was ineffective. Light- and electromicroscopy revealed a marked activation of peritubular capillary endothelial cells in allografts, whereas these alterations were less severe or absent in syngeneic controls and normal kidneys. Finally our data suggest that the ligand responsible for the binding of lymphocytes to kidney peritubular areas is organ specific. Only mannose-1 phosphate, but not mannose-6 phosphate, could decrease the lymphocyte binding. Y-1, an antibody staining rat lymph node high endothelial venules (HEV), did not react with allograft peritubular capillaries having functional and morphologic similarities to HEV.\r"

Biopsies were categorized as hairy leukoplakia (HL) (n = 12), candidiasis (n = 3), oral warts (n = 2), and clinically normal epithelium (n = 4). For HPV detection a modified general primer-mediated PCR method (GP-PCR), which detects a broad spectrum of HPV genotypes at sub-picogram levels, was used. Human papillomavirus DNA was only found in two oral warts and was identified as HPV type 32. Epstein-Barr virus DNA was detected in 16 biopsy specimens, including the 12 HLs, 2 cases of candidiasis, and 2 samples of normal epithelium. Epstein-Barr virus positivity in HL could be confirmed by Southern blot analysis and DNA in situ hybridization using biotinylated DNA probes (bio-DISH). Epstein-Barr virus bio-DISH was also positive in one sample of normal epithelium from a patient with HL. The results indicate that HL is strongly associated with EBV and not with any of the common HPV types that react with general HPV primers in the PCR. However the detection of EBV in normal oral epithelium by PCR and bio-DISH suggests that the presence of this virus is not exclusively related to HL.\r"

  ".U": "90379244\r", 
  ".W": "The morphologic evolution of hepatitis B virus (HBV) liver disease in 45 hepatic allograft recipients who were HBV surface-antigen positive (HBs-Ag+) at the time of liver replacement and who survived for more than 60 days was studied by routine histologic and immunocytochemical analysis of serial pathology specimens. The findings in these patients were compared to a control group of 30 individuals who were immune to the HBV (anti-HBs antibody positive), but required hepatic replacement for other reasons. Eight of the forty-five (18%) HBsAg-positive patients have no serologic evidence of HBV reinfection after transplantation. All 37 remaining patients are reinfected; 21 (47%) developed chronic active hepatitis and/or cirrhosis, 3 (7%) developed submassive necrosis, and 6 (14%) developed chronic lobular hepatitis. One patient lost her graft to chronic rejection, despite reinfection with the B virus. Four other patients (9%) developed a chronic carrier state. No long-term follow-up biopsies were available in the remaining two patients. The histologic features associated with dysfunction related to recurrent HBV infection evolved from an acute to chronic phase and were similar to hepatitis B seen in nonallografted livers. Furthermore HBV-related lesions could be separated from rejection using routine histology alone. The only exception to this conclusion was the occurrence of a peculiar HBV-related lesion in two recipients, described herein. Immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated the presence of viral antigens in almost all cases. Hepatic inflammation also was commonly present during HBV disease and consisted mostly of accessory cells and T lymphocytes. Analysis of the effect of major histocompatibility complex matching revealed no clear association between the number of class I or II matches or mismatches and the development, or pattern, of active hepatitis in the allograft. Peculiar pathologic alterations in several of the biopsies and failed allografts after HBV reinfection suggests that, under special circumstances, the B virus may be cytopathic.\r"

The response was characterized by 1) dense perivascular aggregates composed largely of mononuclear cells; 2) endothelial cell hypertrophy and subendothelial inflammatory cell collections in vessels of a variety of sizes; 3) variable degrees of focal, reversible vascular injury (angiopathy) of both muscular arteries and small veins; and 4) increased cellularity of alveolar walls. Inflammatory cells appeared to emanate from small veins and venules and from minute thin-walled vessels adjacent to large arteries. The reaction peaked at 3 to 4 days and then gradually declined over a period of 6 weeks, never quite reaching baseline. We believe that this experimental model will be an important means of further defining both the mechanisms of lymphocyte entry to the lungs in response to antigen and the factors controlling the pathogenesis of related angiopathies.\r"

These findings raise the possibility of specific corticosteroid-related cognitive impairments.\r"

The three groups did not differ in overall impairment as measured by the Global Assessment Scale and the Social Behavior Rating Schedule. However, the group with command hallucinations differed in the content of their hallucinations (more aggression, dependency, and self-punishment themes), and nearly one-half did not report or denied their command hallucinations to the assessment team. Many patients (N = 11, 44%) reported that they frequently responded to hallucinatory commands with unquestioning obedience.\r"

The authors compared 20 Vietnam combat veterans with PTSD and 18 combat veterans without PTSD on the eyeblink reflex electromyographic response of the startle reaction. Subjects in both groups who failed to show an eyeblink response to the startle stimuli were eliminated from further analyses. Among the remaining subjects, the 13 with PTSD had a significantly greater startle response amplitude than the 12 control subjects at intermediate intensities of acoustic stimuli. The relationship between startle responsivity and both negative and positive symptoms was also investigated.\r"

Significant left-right prefrontal asymmetry was present in the patients before but not after successful treatment, suggesting that medication can reduce this asymmetry. Also, significant hypofrontality and whole-cortex hypometabolism were found in the patients in the depressed state and persisted in the treated state, despite clinical improvement, suggesting that these abnormalities are not state dependent.\r"

Overall, they found high levels of hope and low levels of current syndromal disorder or depressive symptoms. While the sample was a selected group of successful and well-educated homosexual men, it nevertheless remains noteworthy that they were able to preserve a sense of faith in their future despite HIV infection.\r"

Although Gender by Diagnosis effects were not demonstrated, in three of the four studies male schizophrenic subjects had significantly larger ventricles than their control counterparts; there were no differences among the female subjects. One study suggested the opposite effect, but this may be attributable to a non-representative control group.\r"

The model also predicts that life stress will affect utilization through its influence on depression. Data from 783 subjects generally supported the model's predictions. A multifactorial approach to the causes of mental health problems and utilization behavior in the Mexican-American population is suggested.\r"

The dropout rate for patients in brief psychotherapy in which the length of therapy was specified at the outset of treatment (time-limited psychotherapy) (32%) was about one-half the dropout rate for patients in brief (67%) and long-term (61%) individual psychotherapy. The difference in dropout rates could not be explained by patient demographic or diagnostic variables or by therapist characteristics measured in the study. The results suggest that setting a specific time limit on individual psychotherapy at the outset of treatment can reduce the patient dropout rate in a public mental health clinic.\r"

There was marked hypothalamic noradrenaline depletion in all three patients, severe brain choline acetyltransferase deficiency with nucleus basalis cell loss in two patients, and mild to moderate brain choline acetyltransferase loss in one patient. Striatal dopamine metabolite/dopamine ratio was below normal in two patients and not elevated, as would be expected after short-term neuroleptic administration, in the third. This suggests that reduced capability (aggravated by the cholinergic deficit) of the nigrostriatal dopamine system to respond adequately to stress and/or neuroleptic-induced receptor blockade may be important in the development and course of fatal hyperthermia syndrome.\r"

This attitude/behavior discrepancy is more apparent than real. Six methodological problems in the study are discussed in detail in order to demonstrate how the overly simplified treatment of a complex behavior can lead to invalid conclusions.\r"

These improvements may be attributed to three types of change: 1) socio-economic development with decolonization, increased industrialization, growth of gross domestic product, urbanization, the gains of women, and enhanced education; 2) cross-national influences due to greater international trade, the spread of technology, and widespread affirmation of human rights; and 3) national health system development through expanded governmental health programs. Further improvements will depend on greater strength in public sector health services rather than private sector services which aggravate inequities.\r"

A reanalysis was performed of six studies meeting specific eligibility criteria, combining published data with unpublished information obtained from study authors. Five eligible studies were from the United Kingdom, and one was from Denmark. Standardized categories of building ventilation type were created to allow comparison of effects across studies. Within each study, prevalence odds ratios (PORs) were calculated for symptoms in each ventilation category relative to a baseline category of naturally ventilated buildings. Air-conditioned buildings were consistently associated with increased prevalence of work-related headache (POR = 1.3-3.1), lethargy (POR = 1.4-5.1), and upper respiratory/mucus membrane symptoms (POR = 1.3-4.8). Humidification was not a necessary factor for the higher symptom prevalence associated with air-conditioning. Mechanical ventilation without air-conditioning was not associated with higher symptom prevalence. The consistent associations found between type of building ventilation and reported symptom prevalence have potentially important public health and economic implications.\r"

After excluding those with clinically manifest CHD at baseline, corneal arcus was strongly associated with CHD and CVD mortality only in hyperlipidemic men ages 30-49 years, for whom the relative risk for CHD and CVD death was 3.7 and 4.0, respectively, after adjusting for age, total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, and smoking status using a Cox proportional hazards model. Among 30-49 year old males, corneal arcus appears to be a prognostic factor for CHD, independent of its association with hyperlipidemia in this age-group, of about the same magnitude as other common risk factors, underscoring the usefulness of corneal arcus as a prognostic factor to the practicing clinician.\r"

Eight percent of the infant urine cotinine values fell at or above 10 micrograms/L in the 305 households where no smoking was reported. Corresponding rates were 44 percent in the 96 households where a member other than the mother smoked, 91 percent in the 43 households where only the mother smoked, and 96 percent in the 74 households where both the mother and another household member smoked. In households where the mother smoked, infant urine cotinine levels were lower in the summer, and higher when the infant was breast-fed. A screening question about family smoking habits in conjunction with well child care could effectively define a group of infants exposed to environmental tobacco smoke and thus be at greater risk for respiratory diseases.\r"

Populations served by community water supplies were classified into exposure categories according to VOC contamination status based on 1984-85 sampling data. Leukemia incidence data (1979-84) were collected from a population-based cancer registry. For females, the standardized incidence ratio was elevated only in towns in the highest of three exposure categories. No association was observed in males in any of the exposure categories. A Poisson regression analysis of the data, using finer exposure strata, indicated an increase in risk among females with increasing level of contamination which appeared to be distributed evenly across all age strata. The rate ratio for females at the highest exposure stratum for total non-THM VOCs compared to the least exposed stratum was 1.68. The observed association appears to suggest that drinking water contaminated with VOCs may increase the incidence of leukemia among exposed females, but caution is advised in the interpretation of these results because of the uncertainties inherent in ecologic studies.\r"

Paternal military service history among 857 congenital anomaly cases, 61 stillbirth cases, and 48 neonatal death cases were compared with that of 998 normal controls. Military service veterans were identified by crossmatching identifying information from obstetric records with state and national military records. After controlling for confounding variables, we found that the Vietnam veterans' relative risk of fathering an infant with one or more major malformations was 1.7 (95% CI = 0.8, 3.5) compared to non-Vietnam veterans. The increased risk was present in several organ systems and did not seem to be related to a particular type of defect. No associations or highly unstable associations were found between paternal military service in Vietnam and the occurrence of congenital anomalies overall, minor malformations, normal variants, stillbirths, and neonatal deaths. These findings should be viewed with caution since maternal and delivery characteristics appear to have contributed to the etiology of several of the major malformations among the Vietnam veterans' children.\r"

Of the 689 employees who participated in the study, 39 (5.7 percent) were positive for antibody to B. burgdorferi, the causative agent of Lyme disease. Seroprevalence varied markedly by county; unexpectedly high seroprevalence rates were found in several northern counties (Sussex, Hudson, and Hunterdon). Furthermore, some southern counties (Atlantic, Cape May, and Ocean) with large tick populations (as measured by self-reported exposure to ticks) had low seroprevalence rates which were inversely correlated with self-reported preventive practices. These data suggest that lyme disease, as measured by seroprevalence of antibody to B. burgdorferi, may be spreading beyond the southern portion of the state where it had been previously well documented and that preventive behaviors may play an important role in minimizing the risk of the disease.\r"

  ".W": "Although highly beneficial for dental health, low concentrations of fluoride in environmental waters may be toxic to several organisms. In an era of heightened public awareness about the environment, this may lead city officials to withhold implementing water fluoridation for environmental reasons. This paper presents a mass balance approach to evaluate this perceived risk. Generally speaking, fluoridated water loss during use, dilution of sewage by rain and ground water infiltrate, fluoride removal during secondary sewage treatment, and diffusion dynamics at effluent outfall combine to eliminate fluoridation-related environmental effects. In Montreal, water fluoridation would raise average aquatic fluoride levels in the waste water plume immediately below effluent outfall by only 0.05-0.09 mg/l. Downstream, these changes would be only 0.02-0.05 mg/l at 1 km, and 0.01-0.03 mg/l at 2 km below outfall. Overall river fluoride concentrations theoretically would be raised by 0.001-0.002 mg/l, a value not measurable by current analytical techniques. All resulting concentrations would be well below those recommended for environmental safety and would not exceed natural levels found elsewhere in Quebec. A literature review did not reveal any examples of municipal water fluoridation causing recommended environmental concentrations to be exceeded, although excesses occurred in several cases of severe industrial water pollution.\r"

Risk factors for low cholinesterase included recent hire and recent poisoning. Workers did not use protective equipment, nor were there facilities for bathing on site. As a result of this survey, the government has prohibited the mixing and loading of pesticides at this airport and requires the washing of planes prior to maintenance work; coveralls and thin, pesticide impermeable gloves are to be issued to mechanics handling pesticide-contaminated parts.

Traditional abatement resulted in acute increases in: 1) lead contaminated house dust (generally 3 to 6-fold over pre-abatement levels, but at abated sites typically 10 to 100-fold); and 2) the PbBs of nearly half of the occupant children. Modified practices represented modest short-term improvement compared to traditional practices but were also inadequate. By six months, it was clear that neither form of abatement resulted in long-term reductions of PbB or house dust lead levels, leaving children at continued risk of excessive exposure to lead and permanent adverse neurobehavioral effects. Windows were found to be high sources of lead contaminated house dust. Recommendations are made for improved abatement practices including more complete abatement of window units and more effective clean-up to remove lead-bearing dust. Thirteen million US children live in lead-painted dwellings. Research is needed to identify abatement strategies that will be practical and well suited to the current understanding of low-level lead toxicity.\r"

If consensus was defined as agreement by 12 or more panelists, only 1.4 percent of the case scenarios showed consensus on a single rating. Dividing the scale into three broad clinical categories (revascularize promptly, place on a waiting list, or no intervention), 11.4 percent of scenarios showed all 16 panelists agreeing on a single category, rising to 59.4 percent of scenarios if agreement by 12 panelists was accepted as a consensus. The mean difference between the panelists' highest and lowest urgency ratings yielded waiting time differences of two weeks for scenarios of very unstable angina, and more than three months for those with stable angina. However, in a regression model, individual panelist factors on average had less effect than clinical features such as severity and stability of angina, or stenosis of major coronary arteries. These findings strongly support the need for consensus criteria to ensure that triage practices are consistent and fair, and also suggest that widespread adoption of a standardized approach to revascularization priorities may be feasible.\r"

Twenty-seven percent of admissions attended by physicians licensed for more than 15 years were judged inappropriate, compared to 20 percent for younger physicians. Admissions were more likely to be inappropriate if the patient was female (27 percent compared with 18 percent). Controlling for patient and provider characteristics reduces but does not eliminate the differences in the appropriateness of inpatient care across the study's six sites.

Current use of hormones was reported by 32 percent; 26 percent took estrogens alone while 6 percent used estrogen + progestin. Comparisons pointed to significant social network and medical care utilization differences. Women who used estrogen therapy were younger, thinner, lived in smaller household units, and were less likely to be widowed.\r"

The increase in systolic and diastolic arterial pressures and heart rate after treatment were significantly higher with thiopentone. Apnoea was significantly longer with propofol. The times to sitting up unaided and opening the eyes on command were the same for both drugs.

All under-read systolic pressure (by 13%, 21%, 19% and 13% respectively) and over-read diastolic pressure (by 15%, 5%, 27% and 15% respectively) in comparison to direct pressure measurement. The limits of agreement for 95% of comparisons were broad. The systematic difference between direct and oscillotonometric measurements and the variability between and within patients show that direct oscillotonometric measurements are not interchangeable in these patients.

The total number of patients who had one or more complaints was 107 (82.9%). More than a third of the patients were afraid of the anaesthetic, as distinct from the operation. Most had received a pre-operative visit from the anaesthetist which was greatly appreciated. A few patients believed they could have been better informed of possible sequelae. More than 30% were not visited by the surgeon before the operation. A routine postoperative interview, using a preformulated questionnaire, is a good way to assess and maintain a high quality of anaesthesia.\r"

Direct recordings of MSNA were obtained from a 5-micron-tipped, epoxy-coated needle percutaneously placed into the common peroneal nerve. Induction of anesthesia with sodium thiopental (4 mg/kg) significantly decreased R-R interval duration an average of 157 +/- 44 ms (mean +/- SEM) decreased systolic pressure (radial artery) an average of 11 +/- 4 mm Hg, and reduced tonic MSNA from 38 +/- 11 to 18 +/- 5 bursts/100 cardiac cycles (P less than 0.01). Baroreceptor reflex regulation of cardiac intervals and MSNA were determined by sequential boluses of nipride (100 micrograms) and phenylephrine (150 micrograms). Awake baroreceptor slopes relating R-R interval to systolic pressure were 9.5 +/- 2.9 ms/mm Hg and decreased 61% to 2.4 +/- 0.5 ms/mm Hg (P less than 0.01) during sodium thiopental infusions (0.25 mg.kg-1.min-1). Moreover baroreceptor slopes relating MSNA to diastolic pressure in awake patients were -4.0 +/- 0.9 bursts/mm Hg and were reduced by 95% to -0.3 +/- 0.18 bursts/mm Hg (P less than 0.01). Despite the fact that hypotension did not elicit increases in MSNA in anesthetized patients, laryngoscopy and tracheal intubation produced profound augmentations in MSNA. Thus, sodium thiopental reduces tonic levels of MSNA and markedly attenuates baroreceptor reflex control mechanisms. However, profound augmentations in sympathetic activity occurred in response to laryngoscopy and tracheal intubation during thiopental anesthesia.\r"

  ".W": "The aim of this study was to examine the effect of an inotropic intervention on regional myocardial function in the presence of a significant stenosis in a coronary artery. During 0.5% halothane anesthesia, intravenous dobutamine (2.5 and 5 micrograms.kg-1.min-1) was administered to eight pigs. A critical constriction was applied to the left anterior descending (LAD) coronary artery and regional myocardial function was determined with the end-systolic pressure-length relationship in the area of distribution of the LAD and left circumflex coronary artery. Infusion of dobutamine was associated with an increase in the end-systolic pressure-length relationship in the left circumflex coronary artery region from 31.81 +/- 7.87 to 81.03 +/- 21.43 mm Hg.mm-1 (X +/- SEM, P = 0.005), whereas function in the LAD coronary artery region did not change significantly (21.78 +/- 3.97 to 21.97 +/- 6.91 mm Hg.mm-1, P = 0.124). Regional stroke work in the left circumflex coronary artery distribution area increased from 124.38 +/- 24.04 to 222.00 +/- 37.83 mm Hg.mm during the administration of 5 micrograms.kg-1.min-1 dobutamine (P = 0.0125). In the LAD coronary artery area, regional stroke work remained at baseline values. Once the constriction was released, the end-systolic pressure-length relationship in the LAD artery segment increased from 21.97 +/- 2.45 to 35.36 +/- 4.55 mm Hg.mm-1 (P = 0.121). These results suggest that hibernation develops in the myocardial segment supplied by a stenotic coronary artery.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

We concurrently administered approximately one-third the MAC of each of these anesthetics to five young female swine and determined (separately) their solubilities in pig blood and tissues. The blood/gas partition coefficient of desflurane (0.35 +/- 0.02) was significantly smaller (P less than 0.01) than that of sevoflurane (0.45 +/- 0.02), isoflurane (0.94 +/- 0.05), and halothane (2.54 +/- 0.21). Tissue/blood partition coefficients of desflurane and halothane were smaller than those for the other two anesthetics (P less than 0.05) for all tissue groups. As predicted from their blood solubilities, the order of washin and washout was desflurane, sevoflurane, isoflurane, and halothane (most to least rapid). As predicted from tissue solubilities, the tissue time constants for desflurane were smaller than those for sevoflurane, isoflurane, and halothane. Recovery (normalized to that of isoflurane) of the volume of anesthetic taken up was significantly greater (P less than 0.05) for desflurane (93% +/- 7% [mean +/- SD]) than for halothane (77% +/- 6%), was not different from that of isoflurane (100%), but was less than that for sevoflurane (111% +/- 17%). The lower value for halothane is consistent with its known metabolism, but the lower (than sevoflurane) value for desflurane is at variance with other presently available data for their respective biodegradations.\r"

Induction of anesthesia decreased HBF and cardiac index. Before administration of volatile anesthetics, both groups had similar values of HBF, cardiac index, and hepatic venous oxygen saturation. During anesthesia cardiac index remained stable in both groups, whereas HBF increased significantly with isoflurane but did not change significantly with halothane. Hepatic venous oxygen saturation was also significantly greater during isoflurane than during halothane anesthesia. We conclude that isoflurane increases HBF in anesthetized patients and is associated with a higher hepatic venous oxygen saturation than is halothane.\r"

We indirectly measured the mental workload of nine anesthesia residents during 19 cases using a secondary (subsidiary) task paradigm in which performance on an extra task (problems in mathematical addition occurring approximately every 45 s) was used as a probe of a subject's \"spare capacity.\" Excess response time (above baseline) correlated with activities like \"manual task\" and \"speaking with the attending anesthesiologist.\" The addition problem was either skipped or had a high excess response time (greater than 30 s) in 40% of presentations. The complexity of a case and the experience level of the resident interacted in determining the workload. Subjective workload ratings confirmed that induction of and emergence from anesthesia were periods of highest workload, with \"attention\" as the dominant cognitive requirement. The anesthesiologist's spare capacity may often be limited during anesthesia. These types of workload measurement techniques should be applied in controlled studies to better define the factors that increase workload.\r"

In the present study, we used splenectomized mice as an experimental model to investigate the direct effect on bone marrow function of prolonged nitrous oxide inhalation. All of the experimental mice were splenectomized at the age of 4 wk. Half of the experimental mice were continuously exposed to 50% nitrous oxide, and the remainder were continuously exposed to air as controls, starting 3 wk after splenectomy and lasting 14 days, and the numbers of pluripotent hemopoietic stem cells (CFU-S) and granulocyte-macrophage progenitor cells (GM-CFC) in bone marrow were counted. The numbers of pluripotent hemopoietic stem cells and granulocyte-macrophage progenitor cells in the bone marrow of mice exposed to air showed no significant change. The numbers of these two types of cells found in nitrous oxide-exposed mice were approximately 60% of control levels. These data are almost the same as our previously reported bone marrow data obtained in nonsplenectomized mice exposed to nitrous oxide for 14 days. The present results suggest that the marked decrease in the number of splenic hemopoietic stem cells in our previous data is not a result of migration of the cells to bone marrow, and that nitrous oxide directly affects murine bone marrow hemopoiesis.\r"

  ".W": "To determine whether concentrations of diethylaminoethanol (DEAE) and procaine below those that reduce the amplitude of action potentials might alter the excitability of brain cells, a single microelectrode intracellular recording technique was used to measure firing threshold and action potential amplitude of pyramidal cells in rat hippocampal slices. At low concentrations of both DEAE (less than or equal to 5 mM) and procaine (less than or equal to 0.5 mM), firing threshold was significantly increased (P less than 0.01), whereas action potential spike amplitude was minimally altered. At higher concentrations, both drugs significantly decreased action potential spike amplitude (P less than 0.025) as well as increased firing threshold (P less than 0.001). Diethylaminoethanol tended to increase threshold relatively more than procaine, when drug concentrations that similarly reduced action potential amplitude were compared. All actions of DEAE and procaine were reversible. Inhibition of action potentials by DEAE and procaine was clearly concentration-dependent (P less than or equal to 0.015). Diethylaminoethanol effects on threshold were marginally concentration-dependent (P = 0.08); procaine did not demonstrate clear concentration-dependent effects (P = 0.33) over the concentrations tested in this study. These similar actions of procaine and DEAE on brain cells suggest a mechanism by which intravenous local anesthetics may contribute to the general anesthetic state. Moreover, it appears possible that procaine metabolism and DEAE accumulation may underlie the prolonged effects sometimes seen after intravenous procaine administration.\r"

Filters (Humid-Vent Filter, Humid-Vent 1, Pall Conserve, Siemens 150, and ThermoVent 600) were placed between the Y-piece of the anesthesia circle system and the endotracheal tube for 40 min each. Airway temperature, esophageal temperature, and water loss (determined by weighing expired water collected in CaSO4) were measured every 10 min. All of the filters reached near-maximum efficiency in reducing water losses within 10 min. The Humid-Vent Filter and Siemens 150 filters were most efficient, the Pall Conserve and ThermoVent 600 less efficient. Airway temperature rapidly increased 2 degrees-8 degrees C during each trial. The more efficient the filter in conserving water, the greater the airway temperature. The respiratory heat conserved by these filters represents 5.5%-7.2% of the estimated total metabolic heat production during anesthesia in adults.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE: To assess the relative value of invasive and noninvasive predictors of outcome in patients after unstable angina. DESIGN: Cohort of 54 patients with unstable angina who had 6-month follow-up after stabilization on medical therapy. SETTING: University-based hospital, tertiary referral center. PATIENTS: Consecutive patients with unstable angina whose symptoms resolved while receiving medical therapy. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: We prospectively compared 24-hour Holter ST-segment monitoring at admission, quantitative exercise thallium tomography, and cardiac catheterization 5 +/- 2 days after admission and analyzed their value for predicting a cardiac event in patients with unstable angina within 6 months. When patients with a favorable outcome (n = 40) were compared with patients with an unfavorable outcome (n = 11) no statistical difference was found in duration of ST shift of 1 mm or more on Holter monitoring (51 +/- 119 min compared with 37 +/- 43 min), exercise duration by the standard Bruce protocol (8.0 +/- 3.6 min compared with 7.9 +/- 3.1 min), exercise-induced ST depression (0.6 +/- 0.9 mm compared with 1.0 +/- 1.0 mm), and contrast left ventricular ejection fraction (70% +/- 10% compared with 69% +/- 15%). Patients with a favorable outcome were distinguished from those with an unfavorable outcome by a higher maximum rate-pressure product (24 x 10(3) +/- 6 x 10(3) compared with 18 x 10(3) +/- 7 x 10(3), P = 0.0025), smaller size of the reversible scintigraphic perfusion defect expressed as a percentage of total myocardium imaged (6% +/- 11% compared with 17% +/- 18%, P = 0.05) and a smaller number of vessels with stenosis of 50% or more (1.1 +/- 1.2 compared with 2.1 +/- 1.0, P = 0.01). On multiple logistic regression analysis, a history of previous myocardial infarction was the most powerful predictor of outcome. In patients without myocardial infarction, reversible exercise thallium perfusion defect size was the only predictor. CONCLUSION: After stabilization of an episode of unstable angina, quantitative tomographic exercise thallium scintigraphy has greater value for risk stratification than Holter ST-segment monitoring, particularly in patients who have not had a previous infarction.\r"

SETTING: Emergency room and medical and surgical inpatient wards at a university-affiliated hospital. PATIENTS: Twenty-three patients with lactic acidosis, 19 with alcoholic ketoacidosis, and 10 randomly selected controls. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Calculated and measured serum osmolality was determined in all study participants. The osmolal gap was increased in patients with lactic acidosis (17.4 +/- 5.4 mmol/kg) and alcoholic ketoacidosis (26.9 +/- 7.6 mmol/kg) when compared with controls (-1.7 +/- 1.7 mmol/kg, P less than 0.05 for both comparisons). When ethanol was included in the calculation, the osmolal gap remained elevated in the lactic acidosis (10.3 +/- 2.0 mmol/kg) and alcoholic ketoacidosis (11.1 +/- 3.2 mmol/kg) groups (P less than 0.05 for both comparisons). CONCLUSIONS: The osmolal gap is often used as a screen for toxic alcohol ingestion. When calculating the osmolal gap, the contribution of ethanol should be considered. An elevated osmolal gap is not specific for toxic alcohol ingestion, as the osmolal gap was elevated in patients with lactic acidosis and alcoholic ketoacidosis. These two conditions should be considered when using the osmolal gap to design therapy (for example, hemodialysis) in the setting of anion gap metabolic acidosis and suspected toxic alcohol ingestion.\r"

SETTING: Referral hospital. PATIENTS: Eighteen trauma patients with long-bone fractures, including 5 with definite fat embolism syndrome, 5 in whom the diagnosis had been clinically suspected but was impossible to confirm or exclude before bronchoscopy, and 8 with no clinical evidence of the syndrome. Control groups included 9 patients without previous trauma who developed the adult respiratory distress syndrome for various reasons and 15 normal volunteers. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Each patient had fiber-optic bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage, and the percentage of lavage cells containing intracellular fat droplets stained with oil red 0 were determined. In the five patients with definite fat embolism syndrome, light microscopic study of bronchoalveolar cells stained with oil red 0 showed many large intracellular fat droplets (mean percentage of cells containing fat droplets, 63%; range, 31% to 82%), whereas less than 2% of cells recovered by lavage from trauma patients with no clinical evidence of the syndrome, from patients with the adult respiratory distress syndrome, or from normal volunteers contained such inclusions. Use of the same technique in the five patients with possible fat embolism syndrome permitted the immediate identification of three patients in whom this diagnosis was later confirmed by subsequent autopsy or clinical follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: The identification of fat droplets within cells recovered by bronchoalveolar lavage in trauma patients may be a rapid and specific method for establishing the diagnosis of the fat embolism syndrome.\r"

SETTING: Urban medical center, central receiving county hospital. PARTICIPANTS: Sixteen inpatients or outpatients seen by gastroenterology consultants at a single hospital. INTERVENTIONS: Endoscopy with multiple mucosal biopsies and viral culture of all esophageal mucosal lesions. Proven or suspected cyclomegalovirus disease was verified in patients using immunohistochemical antibody staining of mucosal biopsy specimens. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Odynophagia was the most prominent esophageal symptom, seen in 14 of 16 patients with cytomegalovirus esophagitis confirmed by immunohistochemical staining. Ulcerations of the esophagus were identified in all but 1 patient and typically appeared as large, solitary, shallow lesions. Routine hematoxylin and eosin staining of esophageal mucosal and submucosal specimens showed intranuclear inclusions in all patients, whereas cytomegalovirus culture was positive in only 8 of 14 patients. Cytomegalovirus esophagitis was associated with a poor long-term prognosis. CONCLUSION: Cytomegalovirus esophagitis in patients with AIDS is a well-defined entity with characteristic clinical symptoms and endoscopic findings, as well as histopathologic abnormalities.\r"

DESIGN: Survey of all allopathic medical schools in the United States and Canada. PARTICIPANTS: One hundred and fifteen medical schools. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Twenty-eight percent of medical schools had no immunization requirements for matriculating medical students. Thirty-one percent of the schools had no rubella immunity requirement, 40% had no measles immunity requirement, and 44% had no polio immunity requirement for matriculating students. For students beginning clinical clerkships, 18%, 35%, and 40% of schools did not require rubella, measles, and polio immunity, respectively. Only 19% and 4% of schools required hepatitis B and influenza immunizations, respectively, at any time during training. Between 20% and 30% of schools accepted student self-report as evidence of rubella and measles immunity. CONCLUSIONS: Despite expert guidelines, current medical school immunization policies for matriculating medical students are inadequate. Methods to assess, monitor compliance with, and facilitate student immunization are needed. Medical schools should review their immunization policies to comply with published guidelines.\r"

Each received a single intravenous dose (5 mg/m2) followed by oral doses (2-4 mg depending on surface area) every eight hours for five days. Chemotherapy regimens comprised: carboplatin alone, carboplatin plus etoposide, cisplatin plus etoposide; adriamycin (doxorubicin) plus cyclophosphamide, or ifosfamide. Twelve patients received ondansetron with their first course of chemotherapy and the other patients were poor responders to previous antiemetic treatment. Efficacy was assessed by a questionnaire documenting the incidence of vomiting and severity of nausea. In a 24 hour period after starting chemotherapy a complete or major response (less than two vomiting episodes) was achieved in 87% of children. Although ondansetron was effective for early antiemesis after cisplatin or ifosfamide, delayed vomiting, retching, or nausea reduced responses to 50% and 20%, respectively. We conclude that in children ondansetron is an effective, well tolerated, oral antiemetic enabling simple administration in the outpatient setting. In the present schedule it was of limited efficacy against cisplatin or ifosfamide induced emesis.\r"

To find out if the use of aspirin and paracetamol in children had altered, and whether the incidence of Reye's syndrome had changed since a previous study, parents were interviewed in Belfast and London, and the British Reye's Syndrome Surveillance System data were reviewed. Children with febrile illnesses were 17 times more likely to have received aspirin before admission to hospital in 1985/6 compared with 1988/9. Only 21 Belfast parents (40%) and 13 London parents (27%) had heard of Reye's syndrome and only 12 in Belfast (23%) and seven in London (15%) knew of its association with aspirin, suggesting a continuing need for public education. Cases of Reye's syndrome declined both in numbers (from a peak of 79 in 1983/4 to 19 in 1988/9) and in median age. Of the 418 reported cases, the diagnosis was subsequently revised in 89, most often (in 31 of 89, 36%) to 'inborn errors of metabolism'.\r"

Postneonatal mortality rates were 4.22 for whites, 5.91 for Asians (relative risk 1.26, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.04 to 1.53) and 8.20 for Afro-Caribbeans (relative risk 1.78, 95% CI 1.25 to 2.55). Among Asians malformations were common (3.36) and sudden infant death syndrome rare (1.18), in contrast to Afro-Caribbeans among whom the rates were 0.66 and 5.25, respectively. Logistic regression analysis demonstrated a significantly lower risk of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) in Asians and significantly raised risks of SIDS in very low birthweight babies and those with unemployed parent(s). Ethnic differences persisted after controlling for maternal age, social class, and birth weight. Studies of sociocultural differences in child rearing practices are needed and may uncover important aetiological factors of sudden infant death syndrome.\r"

Androgen excretion below the normal range was apparent in asthmatic children aged 8-13 years regardless of whether they were receiving inhaled steroids. This may be the reason for growth delay often seen in asthmatic children. These side effects of beclomethasone are not enough reason to discourage its prescription for the treatment of asthma, but endocrine assessment is desirable when the dose exceeds 400 micrograms/m2/day.\r"

We have evaluated the screening procedure used routinely in one health region in a population of infants at increased risk of sensorineural deafness. They were infants who weighed less than 2000 g at birth or infants who weighed 2000 g or more at birth and who spent more than 24 hours in a special care nursery. The infants' responses to a distraction test were recorded by health visitors and sent to the project office. The results were compared with information from a regional register of early childhood impairment that included children in whom sensorineural deafness had been diagnosed before the age of 3 years. The register had been compiled using information from a wide range of sources. When used in this high risk population the distraction test was sensitive (91%), but nonspecific (82%). The effectiveness of the screening programme was limited, however, because there was an increased risk of deafness among infants who missed being screened by health visitors. In addition, 71% of the deaf infants on the register were not in the high risk population.\r"

Only a quarter of the children with permanent hearing loss were identified as a result of parental concern. The presence of parental suspicion preceding the audiological diagnosis was also measured. Of the children with severe or profound deafness, the parents only suspected the presence of hearing loss in 44%. Parental suspicion was even lower for those with a mild or moderate permanent hearing loss, and for those with an otherwise symptomless conductive hearing loss caused by otitis media with effusion. Some parents did identify hearing impairment in their children, and parental suspicion should never be professionally disregarded. Most parents, however, experienced initial difficulty in recognising their children's hearing loss, even when the children were comparatively old. The study confirms the need to continue to identify deafness early by both parental vigilance and sensitive hearing screening programmes.\r"

The mean duration from the onset of symptoms to diagnosis was 13.8 months. In seven patients the history of pain and abnormalities on examination suggested a possible neurological disorder. Fourteen of 29 patients (48%) with femoral or tibial osteomas had localised muscle atrophy, and 10 patients (34%) had diminished or absent deep tendon reflexes in the affected limb. Two patients had painless lesions. Six patients had normal plain radiographs. Delay in the diagnosis of osteoid osteoma may be prevented by the knowledge that pain may be referred or radicular, that the concomitant occurrence of muscle atrophy and depressed deep tendon reflexes are relatively common findings, and that the characteristic radiological features may only appear late in the course of the disease.\r"

Nineteen were also catheterised, and oxygen consumption was measured so that pulmonary and systemic flow could be calculated. Compared with 20 age and size matched controls, seven of the patients had normal exercise tolerance (as judged by a maximal oxygen consumption of greater than 40 ml/kg/min), 10 showed a moderate reduction (30-39 ml/kg/min), and three were more seriously limited. None of the patients with normal exercise tolerance had obstruction of venous return but six of those with mild impairment of exercise ability had partial or complete obstruction of one or both of the vena cavas. More severe limitation was associated with pulmonary vascular disease and fixed ventricular outflow tract obstruction. Formal exercise testing of apparently well children who have undergone Mustard's operation identifies those with haemodynamic abnormalities that may require intervention.\r"

The length of history, vomiting, rectal bleeding, small bowel obstruction, ileoileocolic intussusception, and the presence of a leading point were all significantly related to failure of hydrostatic reduction. Only 'rectal bleeding' and 'duration of symptoms of more than 48 hours' contributed significantly to the prediction of failure of hydrostatic reduction by logistic regression analysis. We believe that as well as the generally accepted contraindications--signs of peritonitis or bowel perforation--the presence of rectal bleeding when symptoms have lasted more than 48 hours is a contraindication to hydrostatic reduction.\r"

  ".W": "Twenty one surviving infants of pregnancies complicated by rupture of the membranes during the second trimester that lasted at least one week have been followed up for a median of 15 months. Five infants (24%) had recurrent respiratory problems (episodes of wheezing and coughing occurring at least once a week) which related significantly to the use of neonatal ventilation and to very preterm delivery. Five of the 18 infants who were born preterm and with birth weights of less than 2500 g had recurrent respiratory symptoms (28%). This compares favourably with an incidence of symptoms of 67% among surviving low birthweight infants born at this hospital after pregnancies not complicated by premature rupture of the membranes. Neither recurrent respiratory symptoms nor admission to hospital for chest related disorders were associated with the timing of onset or duration of rupture of the membranes. We conclude that, among survivors of premature rupture of the membranes, chronic respiratory morbidity would best be prevented by avoiding very preterm delivery, regardless of the duration of the rupture.\r"

The other two children failed to thrive because of unrecognised hypertension and subsequently presented with heart failure. All three underwent unilateral nephrectomy which cured their hypertension, and all were thriving at the time of writing. The benefits of nephrectomy outweighed the operative risks and loss of renal function. Blood pressure should be measured in children who are failing to thrive as part of routine clinical practice.\r"

Average coal mine dust concentrations were usually well below the MSHA Permissible Exposure Limit (PEL) for all job categories, but at least 10% of the samples obtained from some coal preparation plant job areas and most drilling job areas had concentrations that exceeded the 2.0 mg/m3 limit. In contrast, a very high proportion of samples from surface mine driller areas exceeded the quartz PEL. Of all samples collected for highwall drill operators and helpers, 78% and 77%, respectively, were greater than the 0.1 mg/m3 quartz exposure limit (average concentrations were .32 and .36 mg/m3, respectively). Although MSHA compliance data may not be entirely adequate for assessing chronic exposure to quartz, these data and the results of other NIOSH studies nonetheless indicate excessive exposure to silica in a group of surface coal miners.\r"

The validity of this conclusion depends on the assumption that the two areas had comparable exposure. Using quantitative methods to model movement of the solvent leak plume and water flow within the distribution system, we estimated that women with adverse outcomes were no more likely to have received contaminated water than women with normal live births. These results strengthen the conclusion that exposures to water from the contaminated well were not responsible for the excess of adverse outcomes observed in the Los Paseos area.\r"

Sulfhemoglobinemia was present in six subjects after the period of pollution, but it was not present in any student prior to this period. Significant increases in erythrocyte deformability indexes were observed after the period of pollution, i.e., from 1.13 +/- 0.01 to 1.21 +/0 0.02, implying that erythrocytes were less flexible, which might impair tissue perfusion.\r"

  ".W": "Aldicarb, a carbamate pesticide, is the most potent pesticide in the market and has a LD50 of 1 mg/kg. In the United States it is illegal to use aldicarb on certain crops, e.g., watermelons, because it is incorporated into the flesh of the fruit. Once an accidental or illegal use of such a potent pesticide occurs, there is no easy way for the agricultural or public health system to protect the populace. This paper describes the impact of one such event upon the health of individuals and the institutions of California. On July 4, 1985, California and other western states experienced the largest known outbreak of food-borne pesticide illness ever to occur in North America. This was attributed to watermelons contaminated through the illegal or accidental use of aldicarb by a few farmers in one part of the state. Within California, a total of 1,376 illnesses resulting from consumption of watermelons was reported to the California Department of Health Services (CDHS). Of the 1,376 illnesses, 77% were classified as being probable or possible carbamate illnesses. Many of the case reports involved multiple illnesses associated with the same melon among unrelated individuals. Seventeen individuals required hospitalization. There were 47 reports of illness involving pregnant women, two of whom reported having subsequent stillbirths. Thirty-five of the remaining pregnant women were followed-up 9 mo after the epidemic; no additional stillbirths were found.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "A series of 16 low-tar cigarettes, yielding from 1 to 10 mg of tar, were smoked on a modified cigarette smoking machine that collected both mainstream (MS, inhaled) smoke and sidestream (SS, between puffs) smoke. The SS smoke is the major contributor to environmental tobacco smoke. The collected MS and SS smoke condensates were evaluated for mutagenicity by the Ames test and compared with MS and SS smoke condensates from a high-tar cigarette. Both MS and SS condensates of low-tar cigarettes (LTCs) were tested with the Salmonella strains TA1538 and TA100. Except for three cigarettes, the MS smoke mutagenicities of the LTC smoke condensates were significantly reduced (about 30%) when compared with a control, high-tar (23-mg) cigarette. Opposite results were obtained for the SS smoke condensates, which were more mutagenic (about 20%) than the SS smoke condensate of the high-tar cigarette. Thus, LTC mainstream smoke may be less hazardous to the LTC smoker, whereas LTC sidestream may emit more mutagenic compounds into environmental tobacco smoke, which, through passive inhalation, could affect both smokers and nonsmokers.\r"

A survey of 109 transplant programs yielded 62 replies with 42% of respondents using variations of extracellular solution and 45% using the dextrose and mannitol-based Stanford solution. These two commonly used clinical solutions and University of Wisconsin (UW) solution, which has had success in clinical hepatic and renal transplantation, were compared in a canine model of cardiac transplantation. After antegrade hypothermic cardioplegic arrest, the experimental hearts were excised and stored at 4 degrees C for 6 hours (n = 29). An oxygenated, blood-primed isolated heart preparation was used for reperfusion. After a rest of 45 minutes, cardiac output was increased against constant afterload until a left atrial pressure of 15 mm Hg was reached. The maximum cardiac performance measured by cardiac index, minute work, and stroke work was highly significantly better with Stanford or UW solution protection than with the extracellular solutions (p less than 0.0001). Assuming a cardiac index of 50 mL.kg-1.min-1 is necessary for successful separation from cardiopulmonary bypass, only 1 of 14 extracellular and 15 of 15 Stanford and UW animals would have survived (p less than 0.0001). This study strongly suggests that extracellular cardioplegia is inferior for cardiac transplantation and that programs using this solution should reevaluate their method of myocardial protection for donor hearts.\r"

In the postpneumonic group, infection resulted from a single aerobic organism in 41%, multiple aerobic organisms in 9%, single anaerobic organisms in 12%, and mixed aerobic-anaerobic organisms in 18%. Peptostreptococcus, Streptococcus viridans, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Peptococcus, Staphylococcus aureus, and diphtheroids were the most common organisms, accounting for 55% of bacterial isolates. All 34 patients with postpneumonic empyema were initially treated with drainage, which was successful in two thirds. The remainder, 12 patients, ultimately required thoracotomy. Decortication was combined with intrathoracic transposition of extrathoracic skeletal muscles in 9 patients. There was no reoperation or recurrence of infection, and thoracoplasty was avoided; residual spaces were filled by the transposed muscle.\r"

Arterial pressure and free flow were measured in the proximal and distal IMA as well as in the superior epigastric and musculophrenic arteries. Systolic and mean arterial pressure were significantly higher in the proximal IMA than in any other site, but diastolic pressure was comparable. Overall and diastolic antegrade IMA flows (77 +/- 6 and 44 +/- 3 mL/min) were significantly greater than the retrograde flows through the distal IMA (18.5 +/- 2 and 11.5 +/- 1 mL/min), musculophrenic artery (13.3 +/- 1 and 7.9 +/- 1 mL/min), and superior epigastric artery (5.3 +/- 0.4 and 3.1 +/- 0.2 mL/min). Only patient-size-related variables correlated significantly with retrograde IMA flow. Diastolic retrograde IMA flow represented 8.5% +/- 0.6% of the expected left ventricle coronary flow and in 12 patients (40%) was greater than the expected flow of at least one posteroinferior coronary artery. Based on these data, the retrograde IMA may adequately perfuse the posterior descending or other posterolateral coronary branches in select patients. Previous measuring of the retrograde flow is mandatory.\r"

Expanded polytetrafluoroethylene sutures were used to replace anterior leaflet mitral valve chordae in 8 animals (hypertensive dogs and growing sheep). After the positive results obtained during a 13-month follow-up, 5-0 sutures of the same material were introduced in clinical practice to replace mitral valve chordae. Twelve patients had two to six anterior leaflet chordae replaced for degenerative or rheumatic disease. In 3 patients, the intraoperative result was not acceptable and a prosthetic valve was inserted during the same operation. One case of late failure has been recorded so far (18 months after the procedure), owing to rupture of a natural chorda shortened at operation. Since that event, we have implanted supportive artificial chordae in case of diffuse alteration of natural chordae. The remaining patients show satisfactory hemodynamic results, and no valve-related events have been recognized up to 30 months after operation. We suggest use of 5-0 polytetrafluoroethylene sutures in replacing anterior leaflet chordae in degenerative, rheumatic, and congenital mitral valve diseases.\r"

  ".W": "Organ blood flow distribution was studied in dogs subjected to a left ventricular assist device (LVAD). In normal hearts (group 1), left ventricular work was reduced by 25% when 35% of cardiac output was performed by the LVAD. Organ perfusion, measured with tracer microspheres, remained normal or slightly increased. After induction of cardiogenic shock (group 2), perfusion deteriorated in all organs, but first in the brain, kidney, and intestinum. All animals died within 1 hour. When maximal inotropic support was administered after shock (group 3), hemodynamics improved but perfusion to most organs decreased progressively and 83% of animals died within 2 hours. When the LVAD was inserted after shock but without inotropic support (group 4), perfusion of all organs became normal during LVAD except for kidney flow, which remained severely depressed (56% of preshock value). After LVAD insertion, hemodynamics did not recover completely, and 33% of the animals died within 3 hours. When use of the LVAD was combined with 5 micrograms.kg-1.min-1 of dopamine after shock (group 5), organ blood flow distribution became normal during and after LVAD use except for renal flow, which was significantly impaired (83% of preshock value). Hemodynamics recovered after LVAD use, and all animals survived in this group. We conclude that use of the LVAD combined with low-dose positive inotropic support can prevent deterioration of organ perfusion after cardiogenic shock except for kidney.\r"

The concentration-response relation of both internal mammary artery and gastroepiploic artery to ergonovine, serotonin, and phenylephrine showed similar sigmoid curves. There were no significant differences in developed tension between internal mammary artery and gastroepiploic artery at any concentration for any agent. There were no significant differences in the 50% effective dose value for any agent between internal mammary artery and gastroepiploic artery.

Follow-up totaled 4,072 patient-years. A variety of prosthetic valves, mainly mechanical, were used. The Cox regression model was used to identify independent risk factors and to estimate predicted event-freedoms relative to combinations of these risk factors. There were no risk factors for endocarditis (0.5 +/- 0.1 [number of events per 100 patient-years +/- the standard error]). Except for \"other\" prosthesis-related complications (0.4 +/- 0.1), adversely influenced by porcine bioprostheses (n = 15) and by the Lillehei-Kaster prosthesis (n = 25), only factors underlying diseased preoperative patient/cardiac status had predictive influence. Predicted 10-year event-freedoms for low-risk versus high-risk estimate were 86% versus 73% for thromboembolism (1.7 +/- 0.2), 95% versus 32% for anticoagulant-related hemorrhage (2.4 +/- 0.2), 69% versus 36% for all prosthesis-related complications (5.0 +/- 0.4), 93% versus 0% for sudden cardiac-related events (myocardial infarction and arrhythmia) (1.8 +/- 0.2), and 66% versus 0.5% for combined prosthesis-related and sudden cardiac-related morbidity and mortality (6.8 +/- 0.4). In 193 patients with coronary arteriography, coronary artery disease was a significant risk factor for each of the complication modalities examined except other prosthesis-related complications, prosthesis replacement, and endocarditis. Deciding to operate early in the course of aortic stenosis might \"actively\" reduce the rate of these complications.\r"

Ventricular septal defect was closed through the right atrium using a single polytetrafluoroethylene patch with ample anterior extension to avoid subaortic obstruction. The atrial septal defect was closed with a separate patch. Undivided atrioventricular valve leaflets were sandwiched between the two patches. Right ventricular outflow tract stenosis was relieved by pulmonary valvotomy and an infundibular patch in 7, a supravalvar patch (none transannular) in 6, and right ventricle-to-pulmonary artery conduit in 2. There was one hospital death (1/9, 11%) in a patient with persistent clinically significant postoperative pulmonary stenosis and low cardiac output requiring reoperation and right ventricle-to-pulmonary artery conduit insertion. There was no late mortality. All patients are asymptomatic 0.3 to 5.6 years after operation. Follow-up right ventricular outflow tract gradient ranged from 11 to 43 mm Hg and was 70 mm Hg in 1 patient who later had successful relief of obstruction. Three patients had mitral valve insufficiency; 1 needed reoperation. Aggressive relief of right ventricular outflow tract stenosis with maintenance of pulmonary valve competence and use of two separate patches for closure of the septal defects contribute to optimum immediate and long-term results after repair of this lesion.\r"

Specimens were obtained from 35 patients who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting with simultaneous use of these two kinds of arterial grafts. Degree of arteriosclerosis was classified in five categories: 0, normal; 1, luminal narrowing less than 25%; 2, luminal narrowing between 25% and 50%; 3, luminal narrowing greater than 50%; and 4, overt atherosclerosis with ulceration or calcification. The number of arteries with degree 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 was 16 (46%), 15 (43%), 3 (9%), 0, and 1 (3%) in GEA and 27 (77%), 8 (23%), 0, 0, and 0 in ITA, respectively. Incidence of degree 0 was higher in ITA, but differences were not significant. The mean wall thickness was 0.30 +/- 0.13 mm in GEA and 0.21 +/- 0.07 mm in ITA (p less than 0.05). In 23 patients who underwent postoperative angiography, all 46 arterial grafts were patent without focal stenosis. We conclude that GEA has slightly more intimal thickening than ITA, but significant luminal narrowing caused by arteriosclerosis is rare. Gastroepiploic artery can be expected to be a suitable conduit for coronary artery bypass grafting.\r"

Six patients in group 2 with chronic tuberculous or Aspergillus empyema with multiple fistulas initially underwent open-window thoracostomy or cavernostomy and secondarily had omental transposition. In all patients, the right gastroepiploic vessels were used to provide the blood supply for the flap. Successful closure of the bronchial stump was obtained in all patients in group 1, but 2 of them died of recurrence of their underlying lung carcinoma within 1 year. Five of the 7 patients in group 2 had a favorable outcome, but 2 patients had partial recurrence after omental plombage. From our experience with these patients, we believe that the omental flap is effective for closing fistulas due to postoperative or chronic empyema but has only limited success in patients whose lungs are severely damaged by persistent infection.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of three low-dose regimens of preoperative aspirin therapy on postoperative blood loss, transfusion requirements, and length of hospital stay were recorded in a prospective cohort study of 202 patients undergoing elective coronary artery bypass grafting. One hundred one patients had been prescribed daily aspirin by the referring cardiologist (44 at 75 mg, 28 at 150 mg, and 29 at 300 mg); the remaining 101 patients who had not been prescribed aspirin acted as a control group. A median postoperative blood loss of 870 mL in the control group was increased by 280 mL in the 75-mg aspirin group (p less than 0.001), by 490 mL in the 150-mg aspirin group (p less than 0.001), and by 230 mL in the 300-mg aspirin group (p = 0.03). The median requirement for blood transfusion of 2 U red blood cell concentrates in the control group was increased by 2 U in the 75-mg aspirin group (p less than 0.001), 2 U in the 150-mg aspirin group (p less than 0.001), and 1 U in the 300-mg aspirin group (p = 0.05). Hemostatic \"packs\" (fresh frozen plasma, platelets, and cryoprecipitate) were required in 20 patients in the aspirin groups as compared with 5 in the control group (p less than 0.01 by chi 2 test). The mean postoperative hospital stay was 8 days for all groups. Regular daily low-dose aspirin therapy produces significant increases in postoperative blood loss, resulting in a substantial increase in blood transfusion and hemostatic pack requirements, but does not prolong postoperative hospital stay.\r"

  ".U": "90379750\r", 
  ".W": "During the period January 1981 to September 1986, 444 Medtronic-Hall heart valve prostheses were implanted in 351 patients (mean age, 45 +/- 10 years) mainly for rheumatic valve disease (63.2%). Most of the patients were in New York Heart Association functional class III. Concomitant surgical procedures, mainly conservative tricuspid or mitral procedures or coronary artery bypass grafting, were performed in 101 patients (28.7%). Single-valve replacement was performed in 262 patients (74.6%) (aortic in 117 patients, mitral in 143, and tricuspid in 2), double-valve replacement in 85 (24.2%) (mitral and aortic in 83 and mitral and tricuspid in 2), and triple-valve replacement in 4 (1.1%). Hospital mortality was 6.2%. Follow-up was 97.7% complete. The overall actuarial 8-year survival rate was 77.2%. The linearized incidence of valve-related complications was as follows: thromboembolism, 1.5%/patient-year; reoperation, 1.5%/patient-year; endocarditis, 1.25%/patient-year; hemolysis, 0.52%/patient-year; anticoagulant-related hemorrhage, 0.39%/patient-year; and noninfection-related paraprosthetic leak, 0.33%/patient-year. There were no instances of structural failure. We conclude that after 8 years of follow-up, the Medtronic-Hall valve prosthesis has an excellent clinical performance and a low range of valve-related complications.\r"

  ".W": "To evaluate the use of portable cardiopulmonary bypass as a resuscitative tool and its impact on long-term survival of patients in cardiac arrest, we reviewed the results of 32 consecutive patients resuscitated by cardiopulmonary bypass for cardiac arrest or severe hemodynamic compromise at Northwestern Memorial Hospital over a 2-year period. Overall survival was 12.5%. Only 1 (3.4%) of the 29 patients who had cardiac arrest survived and left the hospital. All 3 patients who had severe hemodynamic compromise but not cardiac arrest were long-term survivors. Our study suggests that portable cardiopulmonary support systems used as a resuscitative tool do not prolong the survival of most cardiac arrest patients but may be useful for patients with shock due to mechanical causes and for those with profound hemodynamic compromise due to ischemia or myocardial infarction. Portable heart-lung machines can provide patients with excellent hemodynamic support; however, neurological or cardiac recovery is unlikely once cardiac arrest occurs.\r"

Thirteen patients had hernias that were identified as being iatrogenic in origin, a prevalence of 13%. Ten hernias were secondary to antireflux procedures, and esophagomyotomy, esophagogastrectomy, and placement of an Angelchik prosthesis accounted for one case each. Symptoms did not differ substantially from those of patients with primary hernias. Incarceration occurred in 2 patients, but neither sustained strangulation. The pathogenesis was most frequently disruption of a previous hiatal closure. Other etiological factors included disruption of the phreno-esophageal membrane by operative dissection, postoperative gastric dilatation, and failure to recognize esophageal shortening or an existing hiatal defect. Abdominal repair was usually possible, but 3 patients required thoracotomy for reduction. There has been one known recurrence during a median follow-up of 41 months.\r"

  ".W": "We studied 20 hearts with tetralogy of Fallot with particular reference to the morphology of the fibrous continuity between the aortic and atrioventricular valves and of the ventricular outflow tracts. The extent of valvar fibrous continuity varied with the degree of aortic override, with the extent of the perimembranous ventricular septal defect opening between the ventricular inlets, and with the development of the ventriculoinfundibular fold. This, when fused with the septomarginal trabeculation, produced discontinuity between the leaflets of the tricuspid valve and the continuous leaflets of the aortic and mitral valves, as well as a muscular posteroinferior rim to the defect. Rotation of the aortic root ranged through 119 degrees. Aortic override varied from 33% to 94%, with 35% of these hearts having more than half of the aortic circumference connected to the right ventricle. The pulmonary valves had three leaflets in 50%, two leaflets in 45%, and four leaflets in one (5%). All hearts had two main coronary arterial orifices, 45% of which were atypical in location. One heart displayed a transmural course of the left coronary artery arising from the nonfacing sinus. By measurement, the subpulmonary length was, on average, roughly 50% greater than the subaortic length, and, when the selected hearts were sectioned, much of the subpulmonary infundibulum was found to be composed of free-standing musculature rather than true outlet septum. The proportion of total right ventricular length represented by the infundibulum was 0.31 +/- 0.07, confirming that, compared with that of normal hearts, the narrowed infundibulum in tetralogy is longer rather than shorter.\r"
