  ".W": "Increasing numbers of medical schools are using Objective Structured Clinical Examinations (OSCEs) to evaluate students. An Objective Structured Clinical Examination employs a multiple-station format and standardized patients to document students' clinical skills. A lengthy format is necessary; testing an entire class often necessitates multiple repetitions of the same examination. This dictates a need to minimize sharing of information among students. We studied six administrations of an Objective Structured Clinical Examination designed to measure skills. Analyses were conducted to detect changes in scores over the administrations as well as over the 8.5 hours of each day of testing. An increase in either might indicate information sharing had occurred. No significant increase occurred. If information was shared, it had no significant effect on scores. Skills a student uses to approach a patient should not change even if the patient's complaints are known.\r"

  ".W": "An American Medical Association committee recently recommended that physicians routinely screen patients for behaviors that put patients at risk for human immunodeficiency virus infection, yet there is evidence that this screening does not occur routinely. Faculty, fellows, and residents at a teaching hospital in a midwestern state with a low prevalence of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome were surveyed regarding their experience in screening for human immunodeficiency virus, their training related to substance abuse and human sexuality, and their confidence and ease in addressing such topics with their patients. Results indicated that only 11% routinely screened patients for high-risk behaviors. While most physicians had received training in human sexuality, most had not received training in substance abuse screening. Those trained felt more confident in addressing substance abuse and human sexuality and felt more comfortable in caring for patients known to be infected with human immunodeficiency virus. A concerted effort to encourage human immunodeficiency virus risk assessment by physicians is needed. This should include training opportunities in screening and counseling patients about sexual activities and substance abuse.\r"

  ".W": "Ideally, physicians and patients should discuss patient preferences for life-sustaining treatment before the onset of cognitive impairment or a life-threatening illness; however, these conversations often do not occur. We developed an educational program in which residents practiced discussing advance directives with volunteer simulated outpatients and then received feedback from the patient, an observing resident, and a faculty member. Residents found the training sessions to be realistic, relevant, and useful. Resident self-ratings improved significantly on eight items representing knowledge, skills, and attitudes about discussing advance directives with patients. Resident learning occurred in four major areas: technical knowledge about advance directives; introducing the topic to patients; giving patients information; and eliciting patients' values and feelings. We conclude that residents need and want training in this area and that simulated patients act as a catalyst for their learning.\r"

At 0, 1, and 6 months, 20 micrograms of vaccine was given in the deltoid to these patients, of whom 17 had no serum HBV markers, 15 had only the antibody to core antigen (anti-HBc), and 23 had anti-HBc and antibody to the surface antigen (anti-HBs) values lower than the allegedly \"protective\" value of 10 mIU/mL. Forty-one healthy controls were vaccinated in parallel. At month 7 (ie, 1 month after the third dose of vaccine), in 76% (13/17) of drug users with no HBV markers, 6% (1/15) of those with isolated anti-HBc, and 69% (16/23) of those with anti-HBc and nonprotective anti-HBs, protective anti-HBs titers (greater than or equal to 10 mIU/mL) developed, compared with 97% (40/41) of controls. At month 24, these rates fell to 43% for drug users with no HBV marker, 0% for those with anti-HBc, 31% for those with anti-HBc and anti-HBs, and 86% for controls. The drug users who did not respond to vaccination were more likely to be those with evidence of prior HBV infection and anergy to skin tests. This indicates that unresponsiveness to hepatitis B vaccine in drug users may be due to altered immunity.\r"

Most patients are persistently bacteremic. Previously published studies have noted a poor response to antimycobacterial chemotherapy. We describe successful treatment of MAC disease in an AIDS patient with a multiple drug regimen, including amikacin, clofazimine, rifampin, ethambutol, and ciprofloxacin. This patient, whose presentation and MAC disease course distinctly differ from most published experience, remains clinically and microbiologically MAC-disease free 25 months after initiation of therapy. We describe four additional AIDS patients with MAC disease who had a favorable clinical and microbiological response to this regimen without developing serious adverse effects after periods ranging from 4 to 12 months. We suggest a prospective, controlled clinical trial using this regimen for treatment of MAC disease in patients with AIDS may be warranted.\r"

The patient presented with encephalopathy and subsequently developed hypoglycemia refractory to infusions of large amounts of glucose. A serum salicylate concentration was elevated at 3.2 mmol/L. Emergent hemodialysis was accompanied by rapid lowering of serum salicylate concentration and resolution of refractory hypoglycemia. Salicylate is well absorbed across normal and diseased skin. Salicylate markedly impairs gluconeogenesis and increases glucose utilization, resulting in hypoglycemia. To our knowledge, this is the first article on hypoglycemia due to the application of topical salicylate.\r"

  ".W": "The central nervous system concentration of magnesium (Mg++) appears to have a critical level below which neurologic dysfunction occurs. Observations presented suggest that the interchange of the Mg++ ion between the cerebrospinal fluid, extracellular fluid, and bone is more rapid and dynamic than is usually believed. This is especially so when the hypertrophied parathyroid gland is associated with significant skeletal depletion of Mg++ as judged by history rather than serum level. Magnesium, much like calcium, has a large presence in bone and has a negative feedback relationship with the parathyroid gland. A decline in central nervous system Mg++ may occur when the skeletal buffer system orchestrated largely by the parathyroid glands is activated by an increase in serum calcium. Observations in veterinary medicine and obstetrics suggest that the transfer of Mg++ from the extracellular fluid into bone during mineralization processes may be extensive. If the inhibition of the hypertrophied parathyroid gland is prolonged and the skeletal depletion of Mg++ extreme, serious neurologic symptoms, including seizures, coma, and death, may occur. Noise, excitement, and bodily contact appear to precipitate neurologic symptoms in Mg+(+)-deficient human subjects as it has been documented to occur in Mg+(+)-deficient experimental animals. The similarity of the acute central nervous system demyelinating syndromes with reactive central nervous system Mg++ deficiency is reviewed.\r"

Three other cases of hematoma of the rectus sheath resulting from prophylactic use of heparin are reviewed. The development of hematoma in these patients may have resulted from intramuscular abdominal injection of heparin and from strain of the rectus abdominis muscle caused by coughing. When prophylactic administration of heparin is necessary in patients with a tendency to paroxysmal cough, subcutaneous injections of heparin in the thigh may be preferable to subcutaneous injections in the abdomen.\r"

To our knowledge, only seven cases of human infection caused by this organism have been reported; they involved four patients with bacteremia and three patients with peritonitis who were receiving continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis. In this report, we describe three immunocompromised patients with catheter-associated bacteremia: a patient with cancer, a patient with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, and a patient with sickle cell disease. There is emerging clinical evidence that F oryzihabitans should be recognized as an organism that is capable of causing human disease, particularly in immunocompromised patients and with the increased usage of permanent catheters.\r"

Diagnosis, however, has been missed or delayed because of lack of familiarity with this disease. We present a case of recrudescent melioidosis that illustrates the difficulties encountered in diagnosis and treatment. This case involves a 76-year-old Vietnam veteran who presented with melioidosis of the bone 18 years after exposure to the organism and 10 years after a missed diagnosis of latent pulmonary disease. This case illustrates the protean nature of latent infection and the difficulty of selecting successful antibiotic therapy.\r"

It has been suggested that these areas may represent attempted differentiation toward either uterine glands or smooth muscle. To investigate these two possibilities, we examined the histologic and immunohistochemical features of 26 low-grade endometrial stromal sarcomas. Eight tumors had epithelial-like differentiation, which in some tumors was so prominent as to suggest a purely epithelial neoplasm. Areas typical of endometrial stromal sarcoma were vimentin positive, whereas epithelial-like differentiation expressed vimentin and the muscle markers muscle-specific actin and desmin, as well as cytokeratin, but not the epithelial marker epithelial membrane antigen. Epithelial-like differentiation in low-grade endometrial stromal sarcoma is not uncommon and, based on our immunohistochemical results after comparison with normal controls, epithelial-like differentiation has a myogenous rather than an epithelial phenotype.\r"

Although benign histopathologically, it is invasive, destructive, and locally recurrent, leading to uncertainty regarding its proper management; as the disease is rare, determining optimal treatment is difficult, given the anecdotal nature of reports. We report the first case of a tumefactive fibroinflammatory lesion occurring outside the head and neck region. Our patient was treated with corticosteroids and had a favorable response, supporting this approach as initial treatment. Immunohistochemical studies performed on a pretreatment specimen were consistent with a secondary inflammatory component because no monoclonal nor aberrant phenotypes were detected. The tumefactive fibroinflammatory lesion appears to be indistinguishable from the other known idiopathic fibroinflammatory processes; patients presenting with any one of these should be evaluated for the others.\r"

Long-term outcome (measured as half-life) is also markedly improved, from an average of 7 years for cadaveric donor transplants to as much as 19 years in the six-antigen-matched recipients. One of the major factors influencing long-term survival is histocompatibility matching, as shown by the survival differences among HLA-identical siblings (25-year half-life), one-haplotype-mismatched parental donors (12-year half-life), and two-haplotype-mismatched cadaveric donors (7-year half-life). For the past 25 years of kidney transplant experience, cadaveric donor half-life has remained stable at 7 years, despite many improvements in immunosuppression protocols. Histocompatibility matching unquestionably offers the best approach to prevention of chronic rejection.\r"

In this boundary position, endothelial cells may play important roles in the afferent and efferent phases of allograft rejection, in the response of the allograft to pretransplant perfusion and to drug therapy, and in the response to viral infection of the host. The expression by endothelial cells of granule membrane protein-140 (GMP-140) and endothelial leukocyte adhesion molecule-1 (ELAM-1), increased tissue factor activity, increased secretion of plasminogen activator inhibitor, and decreased thrombomodulin may all contribute to hyperacute rejection. Similarly, endothelial cells may actively participate in acute cellular rejection and in the development of transplant-associated arteriopathy as a result of induction of antigen-presenting function (ie, HLA class II expression), upregulation of adhesion molecules for lymphocytes and monocytes, and release of platelet-derived growth factors. Endothelial cell functions, which are important for normal inflammatory responses and vessel behavior, may be pathogenic in the allograft.\r"

While noninvasive methods have been tried experimentally, the endomyocardial biopsy remains the gold standard in monitoring the rejection status of the heart allograft. The diagnosis of rejection, however, is complicated by a variety of other histologic findings, which may be procedural or processing related, due to sampling, or specifically related to transplantation. Failed allografts, whether from autopsy or explantation, provide the opportunity to study short- and long-term changes in the transplanted heart. Allograft arteriopathy, or graft atherosclerosis, is the major limiting factor in long-term recipient survival. While the morphological features of graft arteriopathy have been well described, the mechanism and factors contributing to its development remain unclear.\r"

The immunologic mechanisms that underlie renal allograft rejection are heterogeneous and involve the humoral and cellular limbs of the immune response. Antibody-mediated hyperacute rejection is now rare owing to improved prospective cross-matching. Chronic rejection, characterized by intrarenal arterial fibrosis, is still poorly understood. Knowledge of the afferent and efferent processes involved in rejection has led to effective therapeutic and experimental strategies that employ monoclonal antibodies and other pharmacologic agents to reverse, or prevent, acute allograft rejection. In addition, allospecific tolerance has been achieved experimentally and clinically in a variety of manners. Preliminary studies on the mechanism of allograft tolerance induced by donor-specific blood transfusions before transplantation suggest a role for an immunoregulatory cell population that specifically down regulates cytotoxic lymphocyte responses to donor antigens in some recipients. A role for noninherited maternal antigens and anti-idiotypic antibodies in down regulating immune responses to allografts have also been reported by several studies. An improved understanding of allograft rejection and tolerance may identify approaches to prolong allograft survival without the morbidity and mortality associated with present-day immunosuppression.\r"

Unfortunately, less than 30% of patients in the United States have an HLA-identical sibling; therefore, many are denied the opportunity for potentially curative treatment for otherwise fatal conditions. The results of marrow transplantation from haploidentical family members who were partially compatible for nonshared haplotypes with the patients demonstrated the relevance of HLA compatibility for engraftment and graft-vs-host disease. These results have provided the rationale for using HLA-identical unrelated volunteers as marrow donors. The recent development of a national registry of volunteer bone marrow donors (the National Marrow Donor Program in the United States) has made it possible to access a centralized file of more than 260,000 HLA-typed volunteers. Marrow transplants from an unrelated donor have become feasible. However, our preliminary clinical experience clearly demonstrated an increase in the incidence and severity of graft-vs-host disease. It is likely that standard HLA typing techniques are not adequate to provide data for sufficient donor and recipient matching. It is possible that currently available molecular technology could be applied to HLA typing and donor matching to improve on clinical results.\r"

Allogeneic transplantation may require red blood cell or plasma removal if the transplant is ABO incompatible, or T-cell depletion if there is a high risk of graft-vs-host disease. Autologous marrow must be preserved, either in the liquid or frozen state. If there is a chance of neoplastic cell involvement, these cells need to be killed or removed. Initial processing generally involves production of a buffy coat. Automated means using blood cell processors are available. Further purification of the desired progenitor cells may include discontinuous density gradient centrifugation. Depletion techniques can be physical (eg, elutriation or sheep red blood cell rosette removal) or chemical (eg, treatment with 4-hydroperoxycyclophosphamide). Monoclonal antibodies can be used covalently bound to toxin molecules, attached to magnetic beads, or with an exogenous source of complement. Antibodies to the CD34 human hematopoietic marker allow positive selection of desired progenitor cells. Quality control of marrow processing involves measurement of various hematologic parameters, careful process monitoring, bacterial/fungal and hematopoietic progenitor cultures, quantification of residual contaminating cells, and observation of clinical effect. Alternate sources of progenitors for transplant include peripheral blood, cord blood, fetal liver, and cadavers.\r"

  ".W": "A retrospective analysis of all organs that were preserved with University of Wisconsin solution was undertaken to assess the impact of this solution on early allograft function. From May 1987 until June 1990, 181 livers, 92 pancreata, and 92 kidneys were preserved with University of Wisconsin solution for extended periods of time. The mean (+/- SD) preservation times were as follows: liver, 12.6 +/- 4.5 hours; pancreas, 16.7 +/- 4.4 hours; and kidney, 18.3 +/- 4.3 hours. The overall rate of primary nonfunction and hepatic artery thrombosis were 6.1% and 3.9%, respectively. No differences in the rates of primary nonfunction and hepatic artery thrombosis were noted for combined liver-pancreas procurement vs isolated liver retrievals or when reduced-size liver transplants were compared with nonreduced liver transplants. Likewise, no difference in primary nonfunction or hepatic artery thrombosis was seen in livers that were preserved for less than 6, 6 to 12, and greater than 12 hours. However, serum aminotransferase levels and prothrombin times were lower on the first postoperative day in livers that were preserved for less than 6 hours when compared with 6 to 12 or greater than 12 hours. Early pancreatic allograft function was also excellent for up to 24 hours of cold-storage preservation. All patients were immediately insulin independent, and there were no cases of initial nonfunction or graft pancreatitis. There were only two cases (2.2%) of pancreatic vascular thrombosis in this series. No difference in pancreatic function was noted for organs that were preserved for less than 6, 6 to 12, or greater than 12 hours. Likewise, renal allograft function was excellent, with only two patients (2.2%) requiring postoperative hemodialysis. The actuarial 1-month patient survival for liver and pancreas-kidney transplant recipients was 91.5% and 98.9%, respectively. Actuarial 1-month allograft survival for liver, pancreas, and kidney transplants was 83.0%, 96.7%, and 97.8%, respectively. In conclusion, University of Wisconsin solution represents a significant advancement in cold-storage organ preservation and is ideally suited as a universal intra-abdominal aortic-flush and cold-storage solution.\r"

In addition, subjects were characterized immunologically at the time of neurologic and neuropsychologic assessment via determination of circulating lymphocyte counts (total lymphocytes, helper T cells, suppressor T cells, total T cells, activated T cells) and markers of HIV type 1 (HIV-1) infection. At the first cycle of testing, the results of asymptomatic HIV-positive men were indistinguishable from those of HIV-negative men, while persons with AIDS-related complex or AIDS tended to have lower mean performance. These differences did not achieve statistical significance on any single test, but the group with AIDS-related complex or AIDS had the worst mean performance on 12 of 13 individual performance tests. Thirty-seven men underwent repeated testing after a mean interval of approximately 4.5 months. There was little change in mean neurobehavioral performance and vibratory thresholds among all three groups. Measures of neurobehavioral performance and vibrotactile thresholds were not correlated with measures of immunological status. These results are consistent with the concept that asymptomatic infection with HIV-1 does not imply the presence of measurable or significant neurologic or neurobehavioral impairment.\r"

This may indicate that the risk of dementia in these relatives is not specific to AD or that these studies are biased. We obtained a family history and vital status information on each first-degree relative of patients attending a clinic and in a group of recruited healthy elderly subjects. Patients formed two groups: probable AD and other forms of dementia or cognitive disorders without dementia. The odds of dementia in first-degree relatives did not differ between patient groups. The odds of dementia in relatives of patients with probable AD or other forms of dementia was six times that in the relatives of the healthy elderly subjects. The cumulative incidence of dementia increased with age in the first-degree relatives of all subjects. Approximately 50% of the first-degree relatives of patients with AD were demented by age 91 years, but almost the same number of the other patient group's relatives were demented as well. That figure was never reached in the healthy elderly subject's relatives. Because the risk of dementia in first-degree relatives of patients with AD was similar to that for patients with other disorders, we cannot exclude the possibility that this is the result of selection and information biases. Our investigation implies that the increased risk of dementia may not be specific to relatives of patients with AD; the risk may also be increased in first-degree relatives of patients with other neurologic disorders.\r"

  ".W": "In dementia there is cognitive impairment, disability in daily life, and sometimes behavioral disturbance. These changes are a burden for the caregivers of patients with dementia. Few studies are available that examine all these aspects and their interrelationships in a single patient group. In our study we selected detailed methods for assessment of all these aspects. Interrelationships were studied in 30 mild to moderately impaired patients with dementia and their caregivers. Although the relations of cognitive deterioration to disability in daily life and of burden experienced by the caregiver to patient's condition were stronger than often reported, it was impossible to deduce the overall severity of dementia from one single aspect. Thus, for effective management of patients and caregivers, for evaluation of individual treatment or of clinical trials, attention should be paid to all the different aspects of patients' condition and caregivers' burden. Outcome measurements will then be more valid.\r"

A sample of CERAD patients with Alzheimer's disease was stratified by disease severity into those with mild, moderate, or severe dementia and matched with control subjects for sex, age, and education. Using multivariate procedures and cutting scores, the efficacy of each memory measure in distinguishing between these groups and control subjects was determined. The test for delayed recall was found to be the best overall discriminatory measure. The other tests of memory, ie, immediate recall, intrusion errors, and recognition memory, had poor overall discriminability. None of the CERAD memory measures were found to be particularly powerful in staging the severity of dementia. These findings suggest that tests for delayed recall may be particularly useful in the early detection of Alzheimer's disease and should be considered in screening batteries for dementia in community surveys.\r"

Hypertension occurred less frequently in male patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (4%) than in control subjects (30%; OR = .10). Because of small population size, no conclusions can be drawn with respect to the following antecedent conditions: thyroid disease (OR = 1.61), coronary artery disease (OR = .58), obesity (OR = .52), diabetes (OR = 1.00), cerebrovascular disease (OR = .21), and peripheral vascular disease (OR = 1.23). The heterogeneity of antecedent thyroid disease makes it highly unlikely that any specific thyroid lesion is causally associated with most cases of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Hypertension may be a marker for protective factors against the development of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis in men.\r"

Demographic data were collected, including lifetime histories of places of residence; sources of drinking water; occupations, such as farming; and exposure to herbicides and pesticides. Rural living and drinking well water, but not farming and herbicide exposure, were significantly increased in 38 parkinsonians compared with 38 normal control subjects. A comparison of parkinsonian siblings with siblings with essential tremor revealed no differences in any risk factors for the years of shared environment. These data suggest that living in a rural environment and drinking well water are risk factors for Parkinson's disease and that the total life exposure to an environmental toxin may be more important than exposure in early life.\r"

One is located in the immediate periventricular region; the other, in the deep subcortical white matter (centrum semiovale). The diagnostic implications of this second type continue to be uncertain. To determine the neuropathologic correlates of these lesions, the brains from seven elderly patients were fixed in buffered formaldehyde solution, subjected to MRI scanning, and examined neuropathologically. Variable degrees of bilateral periventricular (subependymal) sharply defined areas of high-signal intensity were found in all the brains, and the larger of these showed corresponding areas of myelin pallor with gliosis and dilated perivascular spaces. Discrete bilateral patches of high-signal intensity were found in the centrum semiovale in five patients. Myelin and axon stains showed varying degrees of diffuse white matter pallor in many areas examined, both with and without these areas of high-signal intensity on MRI scans. Neither the myelin nor the axon stains showed discrete white matter abnormalities that corresponded to the MRI findings. We believe that these changes, so commonly found on MRI scans in the elderly, reflect actual changes in the white matter but that their nature and clinical significance need to be elucidated.\r"

Lower extremity findings were frequent. Abnormalities were bilateral. Spasmodic dysphonia severity was related to age. Type, severity, and duration of vocal symptoms were not different for subjects with or without neurologic abnormalities. Vocal tremor was more frequent in neurologically abnormal subjects. Involvement of a pallidothalamic-supplementary motor area system could account for neurologic findings, brain imaging findings, and clinical heterogeneity. The view emerging is that spasmodic dysphonia is a manifestation of disordered motor control involving systems of neurons rather than single anatomical sites.\r"

Over 70% of patients had contralateral ocular deviation (Cogan's \"spasticity of conjugate gaze\"), 20% had ipsilateral deviation, and less than 9% of the patients had no deviation. Lateral ocular deviation was as sensitive, but not as specific, as a unilateral Babinski plantar response in determining the side with the lesion. Contralateral deviation was more common with parietotemporal localization, suggesting that the phenomenon reflects an underlying disturbance of attentional mechanisms.\r"

With regard to the onset of seizures, a bimodal distribution was noted: 40% of patients began having seizures before the age of 1 year, and another 40% started with seizure activity in the third decade of life. In the younger age group, primarily infantile spasms and tonic-clonic seizures with myoclonus were observed, and the older patients often had partial simplex or partial complex seizures as well as tonic-clonic seizures.\r"

There was no other evidence of recurrent lymphoma despite extensive investigation, including bone marrow, lumbar puncture, magnetic resonance imaging of the spine, and computed tomography of the abdomen and pelvis. Intensive systemic chemotherapy was accompanied by nearly complete recovery. Biopsy of a symptomatic nerve is preferable to routine sural nerve biopsy in this condition because of its patchy distribution. Treatment with systematic chemotherapy can be effective.\r"

  ".U": "91137828\r", 
  ".W": "It is known that at 37 degrees C plasmin may have two opposite effects on platelets: at high concentrations (greater than 1.5 caseinolytic units [CU]/mL), plasmin activates platelets; at lower concentrations (0.1 to 1.0 CU/mL) it inhibits platelet activation induced by thrombin, collagen, or calcium ionophore A23187. In this study, we report that when lowering the incubation temperature to 22 degrees C, plasmin at low concentrations (0.1 to 0.5 CU/mL) fully activated platelets. When platelets were treated with 0.2 CU/mL of plasmin, lowering the incubation temperature from 37 degrees C to 22 degrees C resulted in an increase in the expression of fibrinogen receptors, in platelet release and aggregation. Thromboxane A2 was not generated by plasmin treatment at either temperature. Ultrastructural studies showed that platelets responded to low-dose plasmin at 37 degrees C by forming pseudopods, centralizing granules without fibrinogen release, whereas at 22 degrees C the same dose of plasmin caused platelet degranulation with the appearance of alpha-granule fibrinogen within the lumen of the surface connected canalicular system. In addition, at 22 degrees C plasmin at doses insufficient to induce platelet aggregation potentiated platelet response to thrombin. Thus, we suggest that plasmin may initiate both activating and inhibitory processes within platelets and that the change of temperature could influence this balance. These results may be of clinical relevance, because the fibrinolytic system was found activated during cardiopulmonary bypass in which the temperature of patient's blood circulation was reduced. This temperature-dependent behavior is also an interesting model for a further study on platelet response to serine proteinases.\r"

  ".W": "Exposure to hypoxic-ischemic events in fetal or neonatal life may lead to permanent brain damage and subsequent neurodevelopmental deficits. Clinical and diagnostic tools have been somewhat helpful in identifying an at-risk group, particularly those patients sustaining significant neurologic sequelae. In this prospective study, the prognostic significance of multimodality evoked responses in high-risk newborns was examined. A group of 44 high-risk newborns, as well as 14 healthy newborns, were tested during the newborn period with auditory brainstem responses and somatosensory evoked responses; these tests were repeated at 2 and 6 months corrected age. A neonatal neurologic examination, the Einstein Neonatal Neurobehavioral Assessment Scale, was also conducted. At 1 year corrected age, both groups were assessed in a blind fashion by a pediatric neurologist and a psychologist to determine neurodevelopmental outcome. Results indicated that somatosensory evoked response abnormalities in particular predict an abnormal neurologic status at 1 year of age. Abnormalities that persisted or worsened correlated with severe neurologic impairment, whereas an abnormal somatosensory evoked response that improved or normalized in infancy was associated with mild to moderate neurologic sequelae. Increased brainstem conduction in the auditory brainstem responses was also associated with neurologic sequelae. Normal findings from auditory brainstem responses and somatosensory evoked responses predicted normal developmental scores in all areas, as well as a normal neurologic outcome at 1 year with negative predictive powers ranging from 85-100%. Evoked response testing appears to be an important adjunct to the neurologic investigation of high-risk newborns.\r"

Five patients also had neurodevelopmental abnormalities (2 with neonatal epileptic seizures, 2 with chromosomal abnormalities, and 1 with lissencephaly). The remaining 10 patients had normal psychomotor development. The incidence of congenital viral infection was statistically correlated with a poor neurodevelopmental outcome. A correlation did not exist between the short-term prognosis and each of the other clinical factors or cranial sonographic findings.

Two patients underwent transplantation after neurologic improvement was produced by plasmapheresis; however, despite plasmapheresis, 4 patients progressed to brain death. Our data demonstrate that plasmapheresis may transiently improve the encephalopathy of acute hepatic failure but is not curative alone. Therefore, plasmapheresis may be a useful adjunct in the treatment of liver failure, potentially improving the pretransplantation status of the patient.\r"

Electroencephalography (EEG) revealed frequent focal discharges in 1 patient, while a nearly continuous burst suppression pattern over the malformed hemisphere was recorded in the other. IMP-SPECT demonstrated a good correlation with neuroimaging studies. In spite of the different EEG patterns, which had been proposed to predict contrasting clinical outcomes, both IMP-SPECT scans disclosed a similar decrease in tracer uptake in the malformed hemisphere. These results are consistent with the pattern of decreased tracer uptake found in other interictal studies of focal seizures without cerebral malformations. In view of recent recommendations for hemispherectomy in these patients, we suggest that the IMP-SPECT scan be used to compliment EEG as a method to define the extent of abnormality which may be more relevant to long-term prognosis than EEG alone.\r"

At 8 years of age, he developed severe respiratory failure and required respiratory support during sleep. Because of recurrent pneumothorax, he underwent thoracic surgery, at which time biopsy specimens were obtained from the respiratory and truncal muscles. The histologic findings of the respiratory muscles included marked variation in fiber size with a notable increase in fibrous tissue, type 2 fiber deficiency, elevated acid phosphatase activity, and a disorganized intermyofibrillar network. The findings from the truncal muscles were similar to those of the biceps brachii muscle: little variation in fiber size, numerous nemaline bodies in all fibers, and type 1 fiber predominance. The preferential damage to the respiratory muscles was probably responsible for the sudden onset of severe respiratory failure.\r"

  ".W": "Neonates with Down's syndrome occasionally show an excess of blasts in their peripheral blood. This disorder spontaneously resolves within several months and is called transient abnormal myelopoiesis (TAM) or transient myeloproliferative disorder. It has been uncertain whether the excess of blasts in TAM is a result of a clonal proliferation or a polyclonal reactive condition. The clonality of cells in females can be examined by analysis of the methylation patterns of the X chromosomes of proliferating cells using restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP). Using this strategy, we studied three females with Down's syndrome accompanied by TAM who showed heterozygosity in RFLP of either the hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase or phosphoglycerate kinase gene. Analysis of the methylation patterns of these genes demonstrated a clonal nature for blasts in three patients. Thus, TAM is a clonal proliferative disorder. In addition, lymphocytes with a normal appearance contained in analyzed samples from these patients also showed a monoclonal pattern, suggesting that TAM may be a disorder of multipotent stem cells.\r"

All mature erythroid (reticulocytes, erythrocytes) and in vitro erythropoietic precursors (CFU-E, erythroid burst-forming unit [BFU-E]) are severely reduced, if not eradicated. Transient repopulation of the pure BFU-E and CFU-E populations on days 6 and 7, respectively, produces a marked reticulocytosis after day 9. Circulating Epo increases to above normal values by day 2. However, whereas biologically active Epo remains constant at this level until day 9, immunologically active Epo continually increases; by day 12, however, both assays detect circulating Epo levels of about 400 mU/mL. In vitro multipotential stem cells (BFU-E mix) are reduced to 32% on day 1, 7.6% on day 2, and return to normal values between days 4 and 5. The survival and repopulation kinetics of the BFU-E mix imply a stem cell population more mature than the high proliferative potential colony-forming cells. However, the BFU-E mix may be responsible for erythropoiesis repopulating ability.\r"

  ".U": "91159620\r", 
  ".W": "These studies aimed to determine the expression and functional role of c-myb in erythroid progenitors with different cycling activities. In the first series of experiments the erythroid burst-forming unit (BFU-E) and colony-forming unit (CFU-E) populations from adult peripheral blood (PB), bone marrow (BM), and embryonic-fetal liver (FL) were treated with either c-myb antisense oligomers or 3H-thymidine (3H-TdR). A direct correlation was always observed between the inhibitory effect of anti-myb oligomers and the level of cycling activity. Thus, the inhibitory effect of antisense c-myb on the number of BFU-E colonies was 28.3% +/- 15.8% in PB, 53.4% +/- 9.3% in BM, and 68.2% +/- 24.5% in FL. Both adult and embryonic CFU-E were markedly inhibited (73.2% +/- 10.4% and 74.2% +/- 12.7%). Using highly purified PB progenitors, we observed a similar pattern, although with slightly lower inhibitory effects. In the 3H-TdR suicide assay the killing index of BFU-E was 8.9% +/- 4.2% in PB, 29.4% +/- 6.5% in BM, and 40.1% +/- 9.6% in FL. The values for adult and embryonic CFU-E were 55.7% +/- 7.9% and 60.98% +/- 6.6%, respectively. We then investigated the kinetics of c-myb mRNA level during the erythroid differentiation of highly purified adult PB and FL BFU-E, as evaluated in liquid-phase culture by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Adult erythroid precursors showed a gradual increase of c-myb mRNA from day 4 through day 8 of culture and a sharp decrease at later times, whereas the expression of c-myb mRNA and protein in differentiation embryonic precursors peaked 2 days earlier. In both cases, c-myb mRNA level peaked at the CFU-E stage of differentiation. Finally, highly purified adult PB BFU-E were stimulated into cycling by a 3-day treatment with interleukin-3 in liquid phase: both the sensitivity to c-myb antisense oligomers and the 3H-TdR suicide index showed a gradual, strictly parallel increase. Under the same experimental conditions a progressive increase of the mRNA level of DNA polymerase alpha was observed. These observations suggest that in early erythroid differentiation c-myb activation is associated with the progression of progenitors into the S phase of the cell cycle, as well as to the synthesis of DNA polymerase alpha.\r"

Three findings indicated that GM-CSF plays a role in megakaryocytopoiesis. During treatment with GM-CSF (recombinant mammalian, glycosylated; Sandoz/Schering-Plough, 5.5 micrograms protein/kg/d, subcutaneously for 3 days) the percentage of megakaryocyte progenitors (megakaryocyte colony forming unit [CFU-Mk]) in S phase (evaluated by the suicide technique with high 3H-Tdr doses) increased from 31% +/- 16% to 88% +/- 11%; and the maturation profile of megakaryocytes was modified, with a relative increase in more immature stage I-III forms. Moreover, by autoradiography (after incubation of marrow cells with 125I-labeled GM-CSF) specific GM-CSF receptors were detectable on megakaryocytes. Nevertheless, the proliferative stimulus induced on the progenitors was not accompanied by enhanced platelet production (by contrast with the marked granulomonocytosis). It may be suggested that other cytokines are involved in the regulation of the intermediate and terminal stages of megakaryocytopoiesis in vivo and that their intervention is an essential prerequisite to turn the GM-CSF-induced proliferative stimulus into enhanced platelet production.\r"

The expression of human IL-3 appears to be restricted to stimulated T lymphocytes. We have investigated the kinetics and mechanisms involved in the induction of IL-3 expression in the human T lymphocytic tumor cell line Jurkat. We show that accumulation of IL-3 mRNA is controlled at both the transcriptional and posttranscriptional level. Transcription of the IL-3 gene in these cells appears to be constitutive but no IL-3 mRNA was detected in unstimulated cells, indicating that in resting cells IL-3 mRNA is highly unstable. Treatment with phytohemagglutinin (PHA) induced a small and transient increase in the IL-3 gene transcription rate and led to the production of detectable levels of IL-3 mRNA and protein. Optimal induction of IL-3 expression required a second stimulus. Costimulation of Jurkat cells with both phorbol myristate acetate and PHA caused both a transient increase in IL-3 gene transcription, which is dependent on new protein synthesis, and also a transient increase in mRNA stability.\r"

All peptides were able to induce high titers of peptide-specific antibodies in rabbits. Antisera from rabbits induced by recombinant huEpo (rhuEpo) contained a relatively high amount of antibodies preferentially directed against three peptides (P2, P4, and P5), of which P4 comprised the amino-terminal region, P2 the carboxyl-terminus, and P5 an interior region previously described as the receptor-binding site. The same three peptides were able to induce rhuEpo-specific antibodies, whereas P1 and P3 lacked this activity. Only peptide-P2-induced antisera inhibited the biologic activity of rhuEpo in a cell proliferation assay, indicating that the carboxyl-terminal region of the molecule is essentially involved in the biologic function of rhuEpo.\r"

Without growth factor, the spherical bodies produced mainly lymphocytes and macrophages. Addition of interleukin-3 enhanced their granulocyte formation, and this enhancement was observed even after a prolonged maintenance without growth factors. The spherical bodies were composed of a uniform mixture of endothelial cells and fibroblasts within the body, and cell-cell contacts between lymphocytes and fibroblasts were notable in the periphery. With prolonged culture, the spherical bodies showed a definite change in their structure by sorting two cell types and the blood cell production gradually decreased. These results suggested that a three-dimensional structure was required for the maintenance, growth, and differentiation of blood cell progenitors in the long-term spleen culture.\r"

  ".W": "Multiparameter flow cytometry was applied on normal human bone marrow (BM) cells to study the lineage commitment of progenitor cells ie, CD34+ cells. Lineage commitment of the CD34+ cells into the erythroid lineage was assessed by the coexpression of high levels of the CD71 antigen, the myeloid lineage by coexpression of the CD33 antigen and the B-lymphoid lineage by the CD10 antigen. Three color immunofluorescence experiments showed that all CD34+ BM cells that expressed the CD71, CD33, and CD10 antigens, concurrently stained brightly with anti-CD38 monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs). In addition, the CD38 antigen was brightly expressed on early T lymphocytes in human thymus, characterized by CD34, CD5, and CD7 expression. Only 1% of the CD34+ cells, 0.01% of nucleated cells in normal BM, did not express the CD38 antigen. The CD34+, CD38- cell population lacked differentiation markers and were homogeneous primitive blast cells by morphology. In contrast the CD34+, CD38 bright cell populations were heterogeneous in morphology and contained myeloblasts and erythroblasts, as well as lymphoblasts. These features are in agreement with properties expected from putative pluripotent hematopoietic stem cells; indeed, the CD34 antigen density decreased concurrently with increasing CD38 antigen density suggesting an upregulation of the CD38 antigen on differentiation of the CD34+ cells. Further evidence for a strong enrichment of early hematopoietic precursors in the CD34+, CD38- cell fraction was obtained from culture experiments in which CD34+ cell fractions with increasing density of the CD38 antigen were sorted singularly and assayed for blast colony formation. On day 14 of incubation, interleukin-3 (IL-3), IL-6, and GM-CSF, G-CSF, and erythropoietin (Epo) were added in each well. Twenty-five percent of the single sorted cells that expressed CD34 but lacked CD38 antigen gave rise to primitive colonies 28 to 34 days after cell sorting. The ability to form primitive colonies decreased rapidly with increasing density of the CD38 antigen. During 120 days of culture, up to five sequential generations of colonies were obtained after replating of the first-generation primitive colonies. This study provides direct evidence for the existence of a single class of progenitors with extensive proliferative capacity in human BM and provides an experimental approach for their purification, manipulation, and further characterization.\r"

Because late erythroid progenitor cells (CFU-E) are largely in cell cycle, we examined this issue by using an Ep-dependent, murine erythroleukemia cell line, HCD-57. In the presence of human Ep and fetal calf serum, HCD-57 cells had a doubling time of approximately 24 hours, and during log-phase growth approximately 36% of the cells were in G1, 45% in S, and 19% in G2/M. With Ep deprivation, there was a gradual loss of viability and an arrest of proliferation with a 44% increase in the G0/G1 population, which could be reversed by reexposure to Ep even after 72 hours of hormone withdrawal. As little as 2 hours of exposure to Ep was sufficient to stimulate DNA synthesis, and the lag time for initiation of DNA synthesis after exposure to the hormone was approximately 10 hours as measured by either incorporation of labeled thymidine into DNA or cell cycle analysis by flow cytometry. RNA synthesis, by contrast, was initiated within 2 hours after exposure to Ep and did not require DNA synthesis. Total cell DNA content increased after exposure to Ep, indicating that it was acting as mitogen in HCD-57 cells. Ep was also able to stimulate DNA synthesis in the absence of serum as well as in its presence, indicating that the hormone could act as both a competence and a progression factor. Qualitative analysis of the integrity of HCD-57 DNA by electrophoresis in agar as well as direct measurement of DNA fragmentation after metabolic labeling with radioactive thymidine indicated that programmed cell death was occurring that could be reduced but not completely prevented by Ep. These data indicate that Ep acts as both a mitogen and a survival factor for HCD-57 cells.\r"

Little is known of expression of 1,25(OH)2D3 receptor RNA in hematopoietic cells. We examined the expression and modulation of expression of 1,25(OH)2D3 receptor RNA in various proliferating and nonproliferating hematopoietic cells. Constitutive expression of 1,25(OH)2D3 receptor RNA was detected in various kinds of hematopoietic cells, including macrophages and activated T lymphocytes, as well as in cell lines KG-1 (myeloblasts), HL-60 (promyelocytes), ML-3 (myelomonoblasts), U937, THP-1 (monoblasts), K562 (erythroblasts), and S-LB1 (HTLV-1-transfected T lymphocytes). Receptor transcripts were 4.6 kilobases (kb), and no variant sizes were observed. All cell lines examined in this group also expressed 1,25(OH)2D3 receptors. Most B lymphocyte lines expressed negligible levels of 1,25(OH)2D3 receptor RNA and protein; however; analysis of a lymphoid/myeloid somatic hybrid suggested that suppression of expression of 1,25(OH)2D3 receptor RNA in B lymphocytes may be a dominant characteristic. HL-60 cells were cultured with 10(-7) mol/L 1,25(OH)2D3 for 24 to 72 hours, and levels of expression of 1,25(OH)2D3 receptor and its RNA were examined. Levels of RNA coding for the receptor were not modulated by exposure to high levels of ligand. Levels of occupied 1,25(OH)2D3 receptor protein increased in these HL-60 cells; but the total number of 1,25(OH)2D3 receptors decreased about 50% at 24 hours and returned toward normal at 72 hours. Steady-state levels of 1,25(OH)2D3 receptor RNA were not affected by terminal differentiation of HL-60 toward either granulocytes or macrophages. Nondividing macrophages from normal individuals also expressed 1,25(OH)2D3 receptor RNA. In contrast, nondividing peripheral blood lymphocytes from normal individuals did not express 1,25(OH)2D3 receptor RNA; with stimulation of proliferation of these cells, accumulation of 1,25(OH)2D3 receptor RNA increased markedly. Half-life (t1/2) of 1,25(OH)2D3 receptor RNA in T lymphocytes was short (1 hour) as determined by measuring decay of the message after addition of actinomycin D. Consistent with this short t1/2, accumulation of 1,25(OH)2D3 receptor RNA increased in cells as their protein synthesis was inhibited. Further studies are required to understand the physiologic role of 1,25(OH)2D3 receptors in myeloid cells and proliferating T lymphocytes.\r"

  ".W": "Treatment of HL-60 cells, a human promyelocytic leukemia cell line, with the vitamin A derivative retinoic acid (RA) for 7 days resulted in a dose-dependent decrease in proliferation and increase in granulocytic differentiation. The role of transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-beta 1), a protein with pleiotropic effects on the proliferation and differentiation of various cell types, was examined during RA-induced differentiation of HL-60 cells. Although TGF-beta 1 alone had little effect on proliferation or differentiation of HL-60 cells, addition of TGF-beta 1 to HL-60 cells treated with a suboptimum concentration of RA (1.0 nmol/L) resulted in a marked decrease in proliferation with no effect on granulocytic differentiation. Studies of the mechanism of RA-induced TGF-beta sensitivity showed that although untreated HL-60 cells expressed low levels of TGF-beta 1 binding proteins on the cell surface, the levels were increased in a dose-dependent manner after RA treatment. Maximum induction was achieved after treatment with 10 nmol/L RA and consisted predominantly of the 65-Kd TGF-beta 1 receptor type. Moreover, RA treatment also resulted in a dose-dependent increase in both TGF-beta 1 steady-state mRNA expression and production of active TGF-beta with maximum induction at 10 nmol/LRA. RA treatment of HL-60 cells had no effect on TGF-beta 2 and TGF-beta 3 mRNA expression. These data suggest that the effects of RA may be mediated by a TGF-beta 1-mediated autocrine antiproliferative loop during differentiation of HL-60 cells.\r"

TF activity was measured as the ability of monolayers or cell lysates to support FVIIa-catalyzed activation peptide release from 3H-FX. TF antigen in HUVEC extracts was measured in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) that uses a double-antibody sandwich technique with rabbit and goat antibodies to human TF. TF-mRNA was measured by Northern blot hybridization with a 32P-TF cDNA probe. Cells growth with HBGF-1/heparin had both decreased surface and total TF activity as compared with HUVEC from the same endothelial cell pool grown without HBGF-1/heparin. Means +/- SD for TF antigen for four primary cultures were 4.4 +/- 0.9 ng/10(6) cells without HBGF-1/heparin and 0.6 +/- 0.3 ng/10(6) cells with HBGF-1/heparin. TF mRNA 4 hours after incubation with thrombin of HUVEC grown without HBGF-1/heparin was about sevenfold higher than TF mRNA of HUVEC grown with HBGF-1/heparin. These data establish that growing primary cultures of HUVEC with HBGF-1/heparin impairs their ability to synthesize TF apoprotein after perturbation. This may be part of a generalized response of endothelial cells to HBGF-1/heparin facilitating migration during angiogenesis.\r"

  ".W": "Iron-transferrin (FeTF) is an essential growth factor required for proliferation of lymphoid cells. FeTF activates protein kinase C (PKC) in the lymphoblastoid T-cell line, CCRF-CEM. We have treated CEM cells with human FeTF, then examined levels of PKC mRNA by hybridization analysis using cDNA probes specific for alpha-, beta-, and gamma-PKC subspecies. CEM cell mRNA hybridized with the beta-subspecies probe but not with probes for alpha- or gamma-subspecies. After exposure to FeTF an increase in PKC-beta mRNA was detectable at 10 minutes, peaked at 12 hours, and was sustained for 72 hours. Nuclear transcription assays demonstrated that rates of PKC-beta mRNA transcription were increased in FeTF-treated cells. By contrast, steady state levels of PKC-beta mRNA did not increase after treatment of cells with apotransferrin or gallium TF. Similarly, treatment with soluble iron as ferric ammonium citrate did not increase steady state levels of PKC-beta mRNA, despite producing a marked increase in cellular ferritin content. Ferritin increased from a baseline value of 63 ng/10(6) cells to 98 and 100 ng/10(6) cells in CEM cells treated for 1 hour with ferric ammonium citrate or FeTF, respectively. FeTF did not increase cytoplasmic-free calcium in CEM cells loaded with fura-2, indicating that binding of FeTF to transferrin receptors did not open membrane Ca2+ channels or release intracellular Ca2+. In addition, pretreatment of cells with desferrioxamine, but not ferrioxamine, blocked the FeTF-induced increase in PKC-beta transcripts. Therefore, iron as FeTF (not soluble iron or nonferric TF) stimulates transcription of the CEM cell PKC-beta gene. Transcriptional rate of the PKC-beta gene does not correlate with cellular iron content as judged by ferritin measurements. Furthermore, the requirement for FeTF does not appear to reflect activation of a classic agonist pathway as judged by stable cellular Ca2+. These data suggest that delivery of iron by FeTF to one or more specific cellular compartments may stimulate PKC-beta gene transcription in CEM cells.\r"

  ".W": "Very little data have been published on cytogenetic abnormalities in Hodgkin's disease (HD) and their correlation with clinicopathologic features are scanty. We have performed chromosomal analysis of lymph nodes from 60 previously untreated HD patients and obtained analyzable metaphases in 49 patients (82%). Chromosomal abnormalities were found in 33 patients (55%) but only 31 karyotypes could be, at least partially, described. Twenty-nine cases showed numerical abnormalities that involved all chromosomes with the exception of chromosomes 13 and Y, which were gained less frequently and lost more frequently than other chromosomes. Structural abnormalities were found in 30 cases, involving all chromosomes except Y. Chromosomal regions 12p11-13, 13p11-13, 3q26-28, 6q15-16, and 7q31-35 were rearranged in more than 20% of the analyzable cases. No correlation was found between cytogenetic findings and initial characteristics. When compared with diffuse B-cell lymphomas, defects in regions 2p25 (P less than .01), 12p11-13 (P less than .01), 13p11-13 (P less than .01), 14p11 (P less than .01), 15p11-13 (P less than .02), and 20q12-13 (P less than .05) were more frequent in HD. When compared with T-cell lymphomas, only defects in regions 12p12-13 (P less than .01) and 13p11-13 (P less than .01) were more frequent in HD. Failure to obtain analyzable metaphases was correlated with stage IV of the disease (P less than .05) and with a poor survival (P less than .01), but cytogenetic results showed no other correlation with clinical outcome. We conclude that molecular studies in HD should be focused on the short arms of chromosomes 12 and 13. Determination of the clinical significance of cytogenetic findings will require a larger number of patients and a longer follow-up period.\r"

  ".W": "The lineage affinity of 57 cases of acute unclassified leukemias (AUL) was reevaluated by ultrastructural analysis of peroxidase expression (POEM) in combination with immunophenotyping and analysis of immunoglobulin gene configuration. Twenty-three cases of myeloid and three cases of megakaryocytic differentiation were identified by detection of ultrastructural myeloperoxidase (UMPO) and platelet peroxidase (UPPO). No significant correlation was noted between myeloid marker expression and POEM positivity, whereas presence of CD 19 or CD 24 antigen significantly correlated with POEM negativity (P = .001 and .023, respectively). Ig gene rearrangements including oligoclonal patterns were also recorded in 8 of 14 UMPO+ patients tested. Fourteen UMPO+ patients responded poorly to an ALL/AUL chemotherapy regimen with a low complete remission (CR) rate of 29% and a short median remission duration (MRD) of 5 months. The POEM- patients proved very heterogenous with respect to immunophenotype and Ig gene rearrangement. Seventeen of 21 patients tested had Ig gene rearrangements, including oligoclonal patterns. Combined data suggest that a proportion of these cases probably derive from a very immature lymphoid progenitor cell, particularly because 15 POEM- AUL patients showed a response to ALL/AUL chemotherapy comparable to that observed in patients with definitive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) (CR rate 80%, MRD 20 months). Thus, ultrastructural analysis of peroxidase expression can provide decisive prognostic information in AUL patients.\r"

  ".U": "91159637\r", 
  ".W": "We have previously shown that the synthetic peptide pGlu-Glu-Asp-Cys-Lys (pEEDCK monomer) inhibits the cytostatic drug-induced proliferation of hematopoietic stem cells CFU-S. Keeping CFU-S quiescent by pEEDCK treatment renders them insensitive to cycle-specific cytostatic drugs and leads to reduced toxicity. Here we show that pEEDCK application during repeated (twice) administration of clinically relevant (nonlethal) 1-beta-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine (Ara-C) doses reduced the percentage of CFU-S in S-phase from 60%-70% to 25%-30% and led to a sustained stem cell number in the bone marrow (BM), whereas unprotected mice had lost about 75% of their CFU-S population. Owing to its cysteine content, the pEEDCK monomer is easily oxidized. The resulting dimer (pEEDCK)2 is a potent stimulator of hematopoiesis. As we show, it can be used for postchemotherapy acceleration of hematologic recovery, similar to the use of recombinant hematopoietic growth factors. A single injection of 30 micrograms/kg pEEDCK monomer to mice 2 hours before the second Ara-C injection retarded onset of neutropenia (by 2 to 3 days) and improved recovery after depression. The quantitative degree of neutropenia was not changed. Postchemotherapy (Ara-C administered twice, followed by N-mustard) infusion of the stimulatory (pEEDCK)2 dimer (1.4 micrograms/kg/d) produced a 4.6-fold increase of progenitor levels (6.7 CFU-GM/1,000 BM cells v 1.45 CFU-GM/1,000 in normal mice) 2 days after the end of the cytostatic treatment when CFU-GM were not detectable in unprotected mice. This increase was followed after several days by strongly elevated granulocyte counts, which remained high for approximately 1 week. Up to 75% of the peripheral leukocytes were mature polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) during this phase. Ara-C (twice) and monomer treatment as above followed by dimer infusion resulted in the complete protection of hematopoiesis. Mice treated with the protective pEEDCK monomer plus stimulatory dimer did not develop the leukocyte depression noted in unprotected animals. The inhibitory monomer appears to keep the stem cell population numerically and qualitatively intact, thus providing optimum target cell conditions for the subsequent stimulator (dimer) treatment. Our results show that the hemoregulatory peptide monomer and dimer can be used for improving the hematologic status of mice treated with clinically relevant doses of cytostatic drugs (antimetabolite and alkylating, alone and in combination). Combining both peptides can prevent occurrence of neutropenia completely. Both peptides can be obtained easily by chemical synthesis and are also active on human cells. They are thus highly promising candidates for application as multilevel hemoprotectors in cancer chemotherapy.\r"

NGF enhanced the viability of neutrophils isolated from peripheral blood and peritoneal cavity in a dose-dependent way. IL-3 50 U/mL had no effect. rGM-CSF 50 U/mL had an effect similar to that of 50 ng/mL NGF. NGF also enhanced the phagocytosis of hydrophilic microspheres by peritoneal neutrophils, and the activity of NGF was greater than that of IL-3 or rGM-CSF. NGF enhanced the superoxide production induced by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), which acts at postreceptor sites, and that induced by opsonized zymosan, a receptor-mediated ligand. The stimulating activity of NGF was largely comparable to that of rGM-CSF. The present data show that NGF bound to neutrophils enhances their survival, phagocytosis, and superoxide production. Thus, we postulate that NGF plays an important role in the inflammatory processes.\r"

We tested whether transgenic mice carrying human fetal (gamma) globin genes provide a model for studying the pharmacologic induction of HbF in the adult. In initial studies, phenylhydrazine-induced hemolytic anemia, 5-azacytidine, butyrate, or combinations of these treatments failed to activate the human gamma-globin gene in a transgenic mouse line carrying a 4.4-kb G gamma globin gene construct that is expressed only in the embryonic stage of mouse development. Subsequently, adult mice carrying the human A gamma gene linked to the locus control region (LCR) regulatory sequences and expressing heterocellularly HbF (about 25%, gamma-positive cells) were used. Treatments with erythropoietin, 5-azacytidine, hydroxyurea, or butyrate resulted in induction of gamma gene expression as documented by measurement of F-reticulocytes, the gamma/gamma + beta biosynthetic ratio and the level of steady state gamma mRNA. Administration of erythropoietin or butyrate to transgenic mice carrying a muLCR-beta (human) globin construct, failed to increase human beta-globin expression. These results suggest that the muLCR-A gamma transgenic mice provide a new model for studying the induction of fetal Hb in the adult.\r"

  ".W": "Vanillin, a food additive, has been evaluated as a potential agent to treat sickle cell anemia. Earlier studies indicated that vanillin had moderate antisickling activity when compared with other aldehydes. We have determined by high performance liquid chromatography that vanillin reacts covalently with sickle hemoglobin (HbS) both in solution and in intact red blood cells. Hemoscan oxygen equilibrium curves show a dose-dependent left shift, particularly at low oxygen tensions. Rheologic evaluation (pO2 scan Ektacytometry) of vanillin-reacted HbS erythrocytes shows a dose-dependent inhibition of deoxygenation-induced cell sickling. Ektacytometry also suggests that vanillin may have a direct inhibitory effect on HbS polymer formation. Vanillin has no adverse effects on cell ion or water content. X-ray crystallographic studies with deoxyhemoglobin (HbA)-vanillin demonstrate that vanillin binds near His 103 alpha, Cys 104 alpha, and Gln 131 beta in the central water cavity. A secondary binding site is located between His 116 beta and His 117 beta. His 116 beta has been implicated as a polymer contact residue. Oxygen equilibrium, ektacytometry, and x-ray studies indicate that vanillin may be acting to decrease HbS polymerization by a dual mechanism of action; allosteric modulation to a high-affinity HbS molecule and by stereospecific inhibition of T state HbS polymerization. Because vanillin is a food additive on the GRAS (generally regarded as safe) list, and because it has little or no adverse effects at high dosages in animals, vanillin is a candidate for further evaluation as an agent for the treatment of sickle cell disease.\r"

These patients had one parent with either the silent beta-thalassemia carrier phenotype or borderline-normal hemoglobin A2 (HbA2) levels (2.5% to 3.5%). Nearly all were genetic compounds for a severe beta-thalassemia mutation and a beta-thalassemia mutation associated with high residual output of beta-globin chains (beta + intervening sequence [IVS]-I-nt6, beta -87, beta -101), indicating that inheritance of a mild beta-thalassemia allele, even in a single dose, is the most common molecular mechanism producing thalassemia intermedia in the Italian population. In three cases, in whom we failed to define by dot-blot analysis the mutations, we sequenced the beta + globin gene and found three novel beta-thalassemia mutations, which are certainly very rare because they have been hitherto detected solely in a single patient. These mutations consist of: (1) a T-A substitution at position 2 of IVS-I, in a patient compound heterozygote for this mutation and the -87 promoter mutation; (2) a G-C substitution at position 844 of IVS-II, in a patient heterozygous for this mutation who showed normal sequences at the in trans beta-globin gene (The reason for the presence of clinical manifestations in a beta-thalassemia heterozygote has not been defined.); and (3) a deletion of one nucleotide (-T) at codon 126, resulting in a frameshift and readthrough of the 5' untranslated region and most likely producing an elongated Hb molecule of 156 amino acid residues, in a patient heterozygous for this mutation with normal beta-globin gene sequences at the other locus.\r"

Nucleotide sequencing of the variant cDNA showed a point mutation, a T/A----C/G transition in exon 3 of the variant gene. No other mutation was found in all coding regions of PGK-Matsue. The nucleotide change created an additional NciI cleavage site in the variant gene; thus, the NciI fragment types detected by Southern blot hybridization differ in the variant DNA and normal DNA. The mutation should cause Leu----Pro substitution at the 88th position from the NH2-terminal Ser of PGK. Because the Leu----Pro substitution is expected to induce serious perturbation and instability in the protein structure, the severe enzyme deficiency is mainly caused by more rapid in vivo denaturation and degradation of the variant enzyme.\r"

  ".W": "To understand the relationship between deoxygenation rate, rheologic behavior, and red blood cell (RBC) morphologic characteristics of blood in sickle (SS) cell anemia, washed oxy SS RBC suspensions (hematocrit, 40%) were subjected to relatively fast and gradual deoxygenation procedures. Relatively fast deoxygenation resulted in 50% decline in percent hemoglobin oxygen saturation (%HbO2) within 1 minute. The SS suspensions following relatively fast deoxygenation showed two distinct phases in viscosity profiles. First, there was a sharp increase in individual viscosities to a peak value at 7 minutes of deoxygenation. Second, prolonged deoxygenation resulted in a 27% to 37% decrease in individual viscosities at 30 minutes as compared with the respective peak values at 7 minutes. Most of the viscosity increase (ie, about fourfold) occurred within the first 3 minutes of relatively fast deoxygenation. Scanning electron microscopy and differential morphologic analysis of deoxy cells showed that at 7 minutes a majority of cells had a granular appearance that was characterized by a bumpy irregular surface and the presence of small spicule-like projections. Prolonged deoxygenation resulted in the appearance of a large percentage of elongated cells that were unlike typical sickle cells. Transmission electron microscopy showed that the elongated shape resulted from the alignment of HbS polymers into long projections. In contrast, gradual deoxygenation over a period of 30 minutes resulted in a progressive increase in viscosity and in the formation of typical sickle shapes and holly leaf cells. The results show that at matching %HbO2, the SS suspensions containing mainly granular shaped cells after 7 minutes of relatively fast deoxygenation are as viscous as the gradually deoxygenated suspensions that contain classic sickle shapes and holly leaf forms, while the suspensions having a large percentage of elongated cells (30 minutes after relatively fast deoxygenation) are the least viscous. The two distinct time-dependent viscosity phases observed after relatively fast deoxygenation probably result from differences in the RBC shape characteristics reflecting physical attributes of the polymer, which could affect cell orientation in the viscometric flow.\r"

  ".W": "Murine erythroleukemia (MEL) cells are a useful model for studying the processes that regulate erythroid differentiation because exposure of these cells to a variety of chemical inducing agents results in expression of erythroid-specific genes and the resultant loss of cellular immortality. Previously it has been suggested that the calcium ionophore, A23187, has effects on the early cellular events that lead to the commitment of these cells to differentiation, but was not in itself sufficient to induce differentiation. We demonstrate here that A23187, as well as another calcium ionophore, ionomycin, are capable of inducing commitment to differentiation. Unlike other inducing agents, continual exposure to A23187 inhibits transcription of the erythroid-specific genes, beta-globin and Band 3. This effect is not attributable to an increase in cytosolic calcium concentration, because cells induced by ionomycin produce normal amounts of hemoglobin. These effects of A23187 on MEL cells confirm that commitment to differentiation is a distinct event from the subsequent transcriptional activation of erythroid genes. The ability of both ionophores to induce commitment to differentiation suggests that an increase in cytosolic calcium can trigger commitment to differentiation. These agents should prove useful in investigating the cellular processes that are responsible for commitment to differentiation.\r"

  ".W": "We have previously determined that in African sickle cell anemia (SS) patients three different beta-like globin gene cluster haplotypes are associated with different percent G gamma (one of the two types of non-alpha chains comprising hemoglobin F [HbF]), mean percent HbF, and percent dense cells. We report now that in adult New York SS patients, the presence of at least one chromosome with the Senegal haplotype is associated with higher Hb levels (1.2 g/dL higher) than is found for any other non-Senegal haplotype (P less than .004). The percent reticulocytes and the serum bilirubin levels were lower in these patients. When the effect of alpha-gene number was analyzed by examining a sample of SS patients with concomitant alpha-thalassemia, the same results were obtained. Because the HbF level is significantly higher among the Senegal haplotype carriers in this sample, the inhibitory effect on sickling of this Hb variant may be one of the reasons for the haplotype effect. We conclude that the Senegal beta-like globin gene cluster haplotype is associated with an amelioration of the hemolytic anemia that characterizes sickle cell disease.\r"

The effect on neutrophil recovery rate, graft-v-host disease (GVHD), and survival was assessed. Four reagents were used: granulocyte-colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), granulocyte-macrophage CSF (GM-CSF), interleukin-1 (IL-1) and IL-4, both alone and in combination. The most effective combination for increasing the circulating absolute neutrophil account (ANC) above the control value at day 7 posttransplant was the combination of G-CSF and IL-1 (mean ANC 2.4 +/- 1.6 x 10(9)/L as compared with control value of 0.07 +/- 0.05, P less than .02), followed by G-CSF alone (mean ANC 1.1 +/- 0.2, P less than .0001), the combination of GM-CSF plus IL-1 (mean ANC 0.8 +/- 0.3, P less than .002), and the combination of G-CSF plus GM-CSF (mean ANC 0.8 +/- 0.3, p less than .005). At day 10 posttransplant, the most effective combination in raising the ANC was the combination of G-CSF plus GM-CSF (mean ANC 7.5 +/- 2.3 as compared with control value of 3.5 +/- 1.1, P less than .01), followed by G-CSF alone (mean ANC 6.9 +/- 2.1, P less than .02). At the doses used, neither G-CSF nor GM-CSF had a deleterious effect on the incidence or severity of GVHD; indeed, GM-CSF was associated with improved survival. In contrast, IL-1 at doses greater than or equal to 100 ng twice daily caused marked early mortality, and there was a suggestion that IL-4 at doses of 500 ng twice daily resulted in increased late mortality, possibly owing to exacerbation of GVHD. This model appears to be of value for exploring the use of hematopoietic growth factors before they are used clinically in marrow allograft recipients.\r"

These results confirm our earlier findings describing ECO RBC in vitro viability and normal in vivo survival time after small-volume infusions. No significant increase in pretransfusion anti-B titer or score is observed in either group O or A subjects provided that sufficient enzyme is used to treat the cells: Cells transfused to group O recipients require higher levels of enzyme (185 to 200 U/mL RBC) than those infused to group A (90 U/mL RBC). Two separate single-unit transfusions of ECO RBC to one group O recipient (4.5 months apart) also survived normally (24-hour survival 96% and 92%, T50 40 and 36 days) and did not increase preexisting anti-B levels in this subject. ECO RBC were not agglutinated or lysed by recipient sera before or after transfusion. Similarly, no antibody development to the alpha-galactosidase used in cell treatment (and washed from the product before transfusion) could be detected in any subject. The sustained increase in hemoglobin levels after transfusion of ECO RBC suggests that this product will be useful in treatment of acute and chronic anemia.\r"

  ".U": "91159648\r", 
  ".W": "The Lewis blood group system comprises two main carbohydrate antigens, Le(a) and Le(b). Lewis typing has traditionally been based on serologic determinations using erythrocytes and saliva. Several recent studies have demonstrated that erythrocyte Lewis phenotype may change during pregnancy or disease, and inappropriate Lewis antigens have been found in both normal and neoplastic tissue. To evaluate whether these observations are in conflict with the presently proposed genetic and biosynthetic basis of the Lewis blood group system, we performed a combined enzymatic, immunohistologic, and immunochemical study of Lewis antigen expression in normal and neoplastic tissues, as well as erythrocytes, plasma, and saliva of Le(a-b-)-typed individuals. Of six cancer-bearing patients typed Le(a-b-), three were identified as nongenuine owing to the presence of alpha 1----4fucosyltransferase activity (alpha 1----4FT) and Lewis antigens in saliva and three were identified as genuine (lacking alpha 1----4FT and Lewis antigens in saliva). These genuine Le(a-b-) individuals were shown to express significant alpha 1----4FT in tissues, and Lewis antigens were detected in tissues by immunohistology as well as immunochemistry. We conclude that the Lewis phenotype obtained by serologic determination of erythrocytes and saliva does not apply to all tissues. We discuss biosynthetic and genetic consequences of this finding.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE--To determine the efficacy of hepatitis B vaccine when added to the routine expanded programme on immunisation under field conditions in rural Africa. DESIGN--Infants were immunised according to two schedules--an early schedule at birth, 3 months, and 6 months and a later schedule to correspond with routine vaccination in the expanded programme on immunisation at 3 months, 4 1/2 months, and 6 months. SETTING--Venda, northern Transvaal, South Africa, a self governing region of 7460 square kilometers varying from rural villages to small towns. SUBJECTS--The 1989 birth cohort of Venda. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Coverage for hepatitis B vaccine at first, second, and third doses; serological assessment of vaccine efficacy by prevalence of antibodies to hepatitis B surface antigen in infants who had completed the three dose course of immunisation; antibodies to hepatitis B core antigen to determine if natural infection occurred. RESULTS--Vaccine coverage for hepatitis B dropped sharply from 99% to 53% to 39% for the first, second, and third dose respectively. In contrast, vaccine coverage was maintained at 97-99% for the three doses of poliomyelitis vaccine. Serological evaluation of vaccine efficacy showed that only 3.5% of recipients of all three doses failed to develop antibodies to hepatitis B surface antigen. Only 6.6% of vaccine recipients were vaccinated according to either the early or later schedules whereas 93.4% received their doses of vaccine at intervals beyond the limits of either of the planned schedules. There was, however, no significant difference in seroconversion to the surface antigen between the \"unscheduled\" or scheduled groups of those who were vaccinated according to the early or late schedules. The pattern of prevalence of antibodies to hepatitis B core antigen, which showed a sharp fall in children aged over 7 months, suggested that the antibodies were acquired passively rather than by active infection. CONCLUSIONS--Supplementation of the present expanded programme on immunisation with hepatitis B vaccine in rural Africa is fraught with difficulties. However, the vaccine was effective within a fairly wide spacing of dosage. Adding hepatitis B vaccine to diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis as a tetravalent vaccine is proposed as a means of effectively integrating it into the expanded programme on immunisation in Third World settings.\r"

Assessment of the methodological quality of 107 controlled trials in 96 published reports found after an extensive search. Trials were scored using a list of predefined criteria of good methodology, and the outcome of the trials was interpreted in relation to their quality. SETTING--Controlled trials published world wide. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Results of the trials with the best methodological quality. Trials of classical homoeopathy and several modern varieties were considered separately. RESULTS--In 14 trials some form of classical homoeopathy was tested and in 58 trials the same single homoeopathic treatment was given to patients with comparable conventional diagnosis. Combinations of several homoeopathic treatments were tested in 26 trials; isopathy was tested in nine trials. Most trials seemed to be of very low quality, but there were many exceptions. The results showed a positive trend regardless of the quality of the trial or the variety of homeopathy used. Overall, of the 105 trials with interpretable results, 81 trials indicated positive results whereas in 24 trials no positive effects of homoeopathy were found. The results of the review may be complicated by publication bias, especially in such a controversial subject as homoeopathy. CONCLUSIONS--At the moment the evidence of clinical trials is positive but not sufficient to draw definitive conclusions because most trials are of low methodological quality and because of the unknown role of publication bias. This indicates that there is a legitimate case for further evaluation of homoeopathy, but only by means of well performed trials.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE--To survey the extent of abuse and violence directed towards general practitioners during the course of their professional duties and to categorize the characteristics of such aggression. DESIGN--Retrospective survey of the views of a large sample of general practitioners by using a piloted postal questionnaire. SETTING--All medical practices in the west midlands. SUBJECTS--A total of 1093 general practitioners (40.6% of the total sample) who responded to the questionnaire. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE--Number of incidents of aggression experienced by the general practitioners during a period of 12 months and the incidence of various precipitating factors. RESULTS--Although the response was low at 40.6%, this study is the largest published database on aggression towards family doctors. In all, 687 (62.9%) of the responders had experienced abuse or violence during the previous 12 months, and 191 (17.5%) had experienced some sort of abuse at least once a month and 11 (1%) had experienced verbal abuse every day. Even assuming that all of the non-responders did not experience any violence, then aggression in patients affects 25.5% of general practitioners in the west midlands. For those practitioners who had experienced aggression in patients the annual incidence of an event per general practitioner was 2.42. In all, 96 (14%) of these general practitioners thought that aggression was increasing. A total of 1520 (91.3%) of all incidents comprised verbal abuse or threats with no direct physical act. The surgery was the commonest location for aggression, with 942 (56.6%) incidents; however, 90 (62.5%) of the incidents involving assault or injury occurred during domiciliary visits and 22 (66%) of the injuries were received during night calls. Relatives were the aggressors in 668 (37.6%) cases, anxiety was a precipitant in 435 (25.7%) cases, and a long wait in 183 (10.8%). CONCLUSIONS--Violence towards general practitioners is common and may be increasing. Some of the precipitants of aggression are potentially avoidable and practices should make strenuous attempts to identify such factors and remedy them. Staff training in interpersonal skills and recognising anxious or intoxicated patients is essential and should be supplemented by consideration of surgery layout and repair. Doctors should avoid delays for patients by rearranging booking policies or surgery times and lengths. Victims of aggression must be followed up. A prospective study or centralised recording of incidents should be funded.\r"

  ".U": "91159912\r", 
  ".W": "The two primary therapeutic strategies in cancer have been to give either chemotherapy and radiation therapy together or give a complete course of one treatment modality before starting the second. Clinical studies show that toxicity has been one of the major deterrents to substantial improvements in cancer management when the two modalities are administered together. On the other hand, the prolonged time necessary to administer all of one modality followed by the other makes it likely that repopulation of the tumor during sequential treatment will diminish therapeutic effectiveness. A third strategy of giving chemotherapy and radiation therapy has been developed. This new regimen was designed to give chemotherapy initially, maintain the chemotherapy schedule to avoid any reduction in its effectiveness, and add radiation therapy as early as possible in between courses of chemotherapy to minimize the development of cross resistance. One of the primary objectives of alternating chemotherapy and radiation therapy is to increase the therapeutic index by reducing toxicity without a significant reduction in therapeutic effectiveness. Recent clinical, experimental, and theoretic results with radiation therapy and chemotherapy for cancer management emphasize the necessity of giving both modalities with the greatest intensity possible in the initial phase of induction therapy. Cancer treatment scheduling determines the toxicity and thereby limits the dose intensity that can be tolerated. Scheduling may also govern the antitumor effect directly; however, normal host tissue makes the determination of the direct effects on the tumor difficult, if not impossible, in clinical studies. Well-defined experimental solid-tumor systems provide the means for determining directly the relationship between toxicity and antitumor effects in relation to tumor burden and total therapeutic dose. In addition, its relationship to dose intensity and scheduling can be determined by the using more sophisticated research techniques, such as response surface methods. Well-defined clinical protocols to determine how to interact chemotherapy with radiation therapy more effectively hold considerable potential for rapid improvement in treatment of radiosensitive and chemosensitive cancers.\r"

The authors conducted a Phase II study to evaluate the effectiveness and toxicity of 13-cis-retinoic acid (CRA) in the therapy of elderly patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Patients presenting with leukocyte counts less than 20,000/microliters were treated with CRA alone. Those with leukocyte counts of 20,000/microliters or greater were pretreated with hydroxyurea, followed by CRA. Twelve of 18 patients received at least 4 weeks of CRA and were thus considered evaluable for toxicity and response. No objective responses were observed. Cis-retinoic acid administration was well tolerated; only modest dermatologic, musculoskeletal, and gastrointestinal toxicity was observed. Alternative therapeutic strategies should be investigated in this subpopulation of AML patients.\r"

  ".W": "Curative combination chemotherapy is available for many patients with aggressive non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL); however, treatment of elderly patients with these regimens is difficult due to excessive toxicity. From 1983 to 1988 the authors treated 26 patients 65 years and older with aggressive NHL with a novel 8-week chemotherapy regimen containing bleomycin, etoposide, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, methotrexate with leucovorin, and prednisone (BECALM), designed to preserve dose intensity and minimize toxicity. Median age was 75 years. Histologic types included the following: 20 intermediate grade (16 large noncleaved cell; two large cleaved cell; one intermediate grade, unspecified); six high grade (four small noncleaved cell; one immunoblastic sarcoma B-cell; one high grade, unspecified). Twenty-one patients were Stage III or IV. Twenty-two of 26 patients had one or more of the following: tumor greater than 10 cm; multiple extranodal sites; lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) 400 IU/l or greater; small noncleaved cell histologic type. Chemotherapy consisted of bleomycin 20 U intravenously (IV) weeks 1 and 7; etoposide 75 mg/m2 IV every day x 3 days on week 4; cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m2 IV weeks 1, 4, 7; doxorubicin 40 mg/m2 IV weeks 1, 7; methotrexate 50 mg/m2 IV weeks 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8 with oral leucovorin rescue; prednisone 60 mg orally for 10 days on weeks 1, 4, 7. Eighteen patients completed the 8-week treatment course. There were 13 complete responses (CR); seven patients remain in continuous CR at a median follow-up of 37.5 months. There have been five relapses, including one late relapse; and one patient died of an intercurrent illness in CR. Overall and actual event-free survivals are 38% and 27%, respectively. The major toxicities were neutropenic fever and mucositis. There were four treatment-related deaths. The authors conclude that BECALM chemotherapy can be administered to elderly patients with aggressive NHL. Although neurotoxicity and cumulative toxicity from bleomycin and anthracycline are avoided, the regimen remains moderately toxic, particularly with respect to myelosuppression. Treatment results compare favorably with other reported regimens in this group of patients with multiple poor prognostic features.\r"

  ".W": "Before the advent of multiagent chemotherapy, the prognosis for patients with Stage IV neuroblastoma of all ages was dismal. More recently, marked improvement in infants with Stage IV neuroblastoma has been reported. Twenty-four infants with Stage IV neuroblastoma have been treated at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute/The Children's Hospital, and the Joint Center For Radiation Therapy, Boston, Massachusetts, between 1970 and 1988. Twenty-three of these patients were treated with multiagent chemotherapy and one with a single drug. In the initial report, ten of 11 patients were alive without evidence of disease after intensive therapy. In this report the authors update their initial series of patients and include 13 additional patients who subsequently presented to our institutions with Stage IV neuroblastoma younger than 1 year of age. The 5-year actuarial event-free survival for the 24 patients is 75%. No patient without bone metastases died from neuroblastoma, and 12 of 16 patients with bone metastases remained disease free. These results confirm that infants with Stage IV neuroblastoma have a very good prognosis when treated with intensive multiagent chemotherapy.\r"

  ".W": "Of 408 negative axillary node (NAN) patients surgically treated at Roswell Park Cancer Institute (Buffalo, NY, 1976 through 1987), 36 (8.8%) presented with ductal carcinoma in situ with microinvasion (DCISM). In more than 50% of the patients (20/36) the disease was detected solely by mammography (microcalcifications and/or radiological density less than 1.5 cm). Thirty-three patients underwent modified radical mastectomy; three had wide excision +/- axillary dissection. Residual disease after excisional biopsy was found in 22 of 33 mastectomy specimens (67%): 11 (33%) pure ductal carcinoma in situ, five (15%) DCISM, and six (18%) frankly invasive. Of the 22 incidents of residual disease, 50% (11) were multicentric (one third of all specimens). These findings imply a high likelihood of residual cancer after excisional biopsy in these patients. All patients were free of disease for a mean follow-up of 57 months (range, 16 to 137). These findings indicate that DCISM is an entirely curable disease when treated by mastectomy alone, without the need for adjuvant therapy, regardless of the status of other prognostic factors such as tumor size, histologic differentiation, age, or steroid receptor status.\r"

  ".W": "A multimodality approach of moderate-dose to high-dose preoperative radiation therapy, surgical resection, and intraoperative electron beam radiation therapy (IORT) has been used for patients with locally recurrent rectal or rectosigmoid carcinoma. The 5-year actuarial local control and disease-free survival for 30 patients undergoing this treatment program were 26% and 19%, respectively. The most important factor predicting a favorable outcome was complete resection with negative pathologic resection margins. The determinant local control and disease-free survival for 13 patients undergoing complete resection were 62% and 54%, respectively, whereas for 17 patients undergoing partial resection these figures were 18% and 6%, respectively. There did not appear to be a difference in local control or survival based on the original surgical resection (abdominoperineal resection versus low anterior resection). However, the likelihood of obtaining a complete resection after preoperative radiation therapy was higher in patients who had previously undergone a low anterior resection than patients undergoing prior abdominoperineal resection. For the 30 patients undergoing external beam irradiation, resection, and IORT, the most significant toxicities were soft tissue or sacral injury and pelvic neuropathy. Efforts to further improve local control are directed toward the concurrent use of chemotherapy (5-fluorouracil with and without leucovorin) as radiation dose modifiers during external beam irradiation and the use of additional postoperative radiation therapy.\r"

Recently, in view of its ability to bind and disrupt the function of multiple growth factors and cellular enzyme systems, the authors have been evaluating the role of suramin as an antitumor agent. In this study, 12 patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma received parenteral suramin by continuous infusion to a peak plasma suramin level greater than 200 micrograms/ml. No objective radiographic responses were observed, although greater than 90% necrosis of multiple tumor sites was documented at autopsy in one patient and normalization of tumor-related hypercalcemia occurred in another patient. Two patients had stable disease of 10 and 28 weeks' duration, respectively. Significant toxicities included hypotension related to sepsis and resulting in renal insufficiency (one patient), development of liver function abnormalities (one patient) marked thrombocytopenia (one patient), prothrombin time prolongation (all patients), vortex keratopathy (two patients), and Grade 1 sensory neuropathy (two patients). On the basis of the current results, suramin does not appear to be an active single agent against metastatic renal cell carcinoma when administered by this dosing schedule.\r"

Eight patients received cisplatin 100 mg/m2 on days 1 and 8 combined with DTIC 300 mg/m2 on days 1, 2, 8 and 9 (regimen A). Because of excessive toxicity, the protocol was modified so that cisplatin was given at 50 mg/m2 per day and DTIC 350 mg/m2 per day on days 1 through 3 (regimen B). The overall response rate was 32% and consisted of four partial and three complete responses (CR). The median duration of response was 6 months. Two of the CR remain in sustained, unmaintained remission in excess of 1.5 years. All seven patients that responded were treated on regimen B. High-dose cisplatin plus DTIC on a 3-day schedule represents an effective, well-tolerated therapy for metastatic melanoma.\r"

The authors conducted a Phase I trial of escalating doses of CP using probenecid as a chemoprotector. Fifty-four courses of CP at doses ranging from 100 to 160 mg/m2 were given by 24-hour infusion to 36 patients. There was no renal impairment at any dose. Ototoxicity, however, became the dose-limiting toxicity; 14 patients experienced a 20 or greater decibel (dB) loss. Seven percent of courses were associated with a leukocyte count of less than 1.5 x 10/microliters, and 19% with a platelet count of less than 50 x 10(3)/microliters. Only three patients developed neurotoxicity. Correlating pharmacokinetic data and toxicity, the authors found that high cumulative dose, area under the curve (AUC) for unbound platinum, and cumulative AUC were associated with ototoxicity and peripheral neuropathy. It was concluded that probenecid may protect against CP nephrotoxicity and warrants further investigation. Its unique mechanism of action and lack of toxicity make it ideal to combine with other chemoprotectors.\r"

Normal alkaline phosphatase and high Karnofsky performance status (KPS) were predominant for long survival. Patients 60 years or older at initiation of therapy were likely to survive longer than younger patients, perhaps indicating physician selectivity of older patients for this therapy, and those with initial hemoglobin in the normal range were also likely to survive longer.

Distribution according to the TNM system 1978 International Union Against Cancer (UICC) was the following: 22 T1 lesions, 47 T2 lesions, 64 T3 lesions, and 33 T4 lesions. Regional nodes were not palpable in 50 cases, 35 had N1 nodes, 12 had N2 nodes, and 69 had N3 nodes. All patients received external beam radiation. The 2-year, 3-year, and 5-year overall survival rates for all patients were, respectively, 45%, 37%, and 27%. Local control was significantly related to the initial status of the primary, to the tumor regression at the end of the radiation therapy, and to the histologic differentiation. The 2-year local control was 96% for T1 lesions, 57% for T2 lesions, 45% for T3 lesions, and 23% for T4 lesions. Local control was 70% if the tumor regression was complete at the end of the treatment and 27% if the tumor regression was partial. No significant differences were found in primary local control with respect to degree of infiltration, age, and dose of radiation therapy over a dose of 60 Gy in 6 weeks. The 3-year regional control was 86% for N0, 78% for N1, and 60% for N2 and N3. Among the tumor characteristics analyzed, the most useful ones for predicting local control and survival were clinical tumor staging parameters and tumor radiation-induced regression. A new therapeutic approach based on the evaluation of the tumor regression at 50/55 Gy is under discussion.\r"

Serous acini of salivary and lacrimal glands have similar developmental, morphologic, and functional characteristics. Serous acinar cells are functionally mature, secretory epithelial cells that normally do not divide and are long lived. Irradiation of the salivary and lacrimal glands of rhesus monkeys resulted in selective death of serous acinar cells within 24 hours. The paradigm for acute radiation seroadenosis is intermitotic or interphase cell death caused by apoptosis.\r"

Two hours postinjection, tumor uptakes ranged from 0.027 (colon cancer) to 0.125% kg injected dose/g (melanoma); and was greater than 0.085 in the Namalwa lymphomas and the renal cell carcinomas. Tumor-blood ratios of up to 23:1 were seen 2 hours postinjection (melanoma) with a mean tumor-blood ratio for all tumors of 12.3 +/- 1.8. Uptake in the other tumors was intermediate. When evaluated, tumor uptake was slightly greater at 1 than at 2 hours postinjection, although target-background ratios were generally higher at 2 hours postinjection. This compound, FDG, may have broad applicability as a tracer for positron-emission tomographic imaging of many human malignancies.\r"

  ".W": "The M13 phage single-strand DNA probe which recognizes highly polymorphic loci was applied to HinfI-digested DNA isolated from tumor tissue and peripheral leukocytes from 20 patients with ovarian cancer. An average of 22 minisatellite-containing DNA fragments were observed per individual. DNA fingerprint analysis revealed a change in restriction-fragment-length patterns in the DNA from 12 of 20 (60%) tumors compared with the patient's constitutional DNA. Deletion of one or more bands from the tumor was recognized by the probe in seven cases, new bands were identified in two, and intensity shift was demonstrated in eight. The authors conclude that the unmapped M13 minisatellite probe is a useful method for identifying cancer-related somatic DNA alterations.\r"

  ".W": "Deficiency of vitamin A and/or its precursors has been associated with increased cancer risk in animals and humans. Therapeutic trials of vitamin A and related compounds have demonstrated activity in several cancerous and precancerous conditions. The authors measured the effects of a retinoid, 13-cis-retinoic acid, and a carotenoid, beta-carotene, on the human immune system in vivo in conjunction with their use in ongoing clinical trials. Immune cell subpopulations were analyzed by quantifying the expression of markers using flow cytometric study. Both compounds produced significant effects on immune cell populations. 13-cis-Retinoic acid resulted in an increase in the percentage of peripheral blood lymphoid cells expressing surface markers for T-helper cells with only minimal effect on natural killer cell marker expression. In contrast, beta-carotene produced an increase in the percentage of cells expressing natural killer cell markers with smaller effect on T-helper markers. Modest increases in the percentage of cells expressing Ia antigen, transferrin, and interleukin-2 receptors were produced by both drugs. These results suggest that retinoids and carotenoids can produce major changes in immune cellular marker expression in vivo in humans at doses relevant to their potential clinical use.\r"

  ".W": "One characteristic of Philadelphia chromosome (Ph')-positive acute leukemia is the occasional presence of both lymphoid and myeloid features in the same leukemia. This phenomenon supports the theory that this subtype of acute leukemia arises from lymphoid-myeloid stem cell, pluripotent progenitors. Very few reports, however, describe the immunophenotype, especially CD34 antigen, of Ph'-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). It has been shown that CD34, the human progenitor cell antigen, is found on 1% or less of normal human bone marrow cells, approximately 30% of acute leukemias, and multipotent progenitor cells; CD34 is not found on normal peripheral blood cells. A high frequency of CD34 expression was found in children with Ph'-positive ALL: CD34 was positive for all six patients tested, and one had an acute mixed-lineage leukemia. These findings suggest the involvement of a pluripotent stem cell in Ph'-positive ALL.\r"

Over a 1-year period, 16 patients underwent leukapheresis for PSCH in preparation for autologous bone marrow transplantation (ABMT). The original catheters remained in place an average of 20 days without any documented infections. Seventeen patients underwent leukapheresis as part of a low-dose interleukin-2 (IL-2) treatment for LAK cell generation, and their catheters remained in place an average of 20.2 days with three documented episodes of bacteremia (18%). Eight patients treated with high-dose IL-2 also underwent leukapheresis for LAK cell generation and their catheters remained in place an average of 12 days with three documented episodes of bacteremia (38%). In all cases of bacteremia, Staphylococcus species were isolated from the blood. The IL-2 exposure level was associated with the risk of bacteremia (P = 0.01). Other potential risk factors (e.g., number of pheresis procedures, complement level, serum immunoglobulin levels, absolute neutrophil count) were not related to this risk.\r"

  ".U": "91159930\r", 
  ".W": "The authors investigated the tissue distribution of two kinds of sialylated derivatives of Lewis A (Le(a)) antigen in patients with cancers of the digestive system using specific monoclonal antibodies, and evaluated the significance of determining the 2-3 and 2-6 sialylated Le(a) antigen levels for the diagnosis of cancer. In most specimens from patients with cancers of the pancreas, biliary tract, stomach, and colon, the 2-3 sialylated Le(a) antigen was strongly expressed in cancer cells. However, 2-6 sialylated Le(a) antigen was less frequently expressed in cancer cells. The former is therefore more specific to cancer than the latter. Also, the serum level of the 2-3 sialylated Le(a) antigen was significantly higher than that of the 2-6 counterpart in patients with cancers of pancreas, biliary tract, stomach, and colon. The resulting ratio of serum 2-3/2-6 sialylated Le(a) antigens was frequently high in patients with malignancy and was low in patients with benign disorders of these digestive organs. Therefore, the 2-3/2-6 sialylated Le(a) antigen ratio is a useful for the differential diagnosis of malignant disorders in these organs. However, liver disorders were found to be exceptional in that both antigens were mostly absent in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells in immunohistologic examination, as well as in nonmalignant parenchymal liver cells. Only the epithelial cells of the intrahepatic bile ducts expressed the 2-6 sialylated Le(a) antigen strongly, and expressed the 2-3 sialylated Le(a) antigen moderately. The levels of both antigens were sometimes high in patients with liver disorders, but the ratio always remained low in patients with HCC as well as benign liver disorders such as cirrhosis or chronic hepatitis. The sialylated Le(a) antigens, which sometimes accumulate in the sera of patients with HCC, were concluded to originate from the epithelial cells of the proliferating small bile ducts, and those serum antigens cannot be considered as evidence for the presence of liver cancer cells.\r"

  ".W": "Human endometrial adenocarcinoma cell lines (KCC-1a and KCC-1b) were established from a resected endometrial carcinoma of a 67-year-old woman. The original tumor showed the bimorphic patterns of tubular adenocarcinoma and clear cell carcinoma. The cell lines have been maintained for 50 months through 100 passages. The doubling time of KCC-1a was 87 hours, whereas that of KCC-1b was 144 hours. The number of chromosomes of KCC-1a distributed in a range from 33 to 79, whereas that of KCC-1b distributed in a range from 64 to 82 (mode, 76). Functionally, both KCC-1a and KCC-1b cells showed the productions of estrone (E1) and estradiol (E2) but not estriol (E3) or progesterone (P). These cells grown in a serum-free medium secreted E1 (KCC-1a, 13.6 pg/ml; KCC-1b, 9.5 pg/ml) and E2 (10.5 pg/ml, 9.5 pg/ml) at passage 40. Neither KCC-1a nor KCC-1b cells contained estrogen or progesterone receptors. Tumor markers--alpha-fetoprotein, carcinoembryonic antigen, CA 125, and CA 19-9--were not detected. Both KCC-1a and KCC-1b cells produced tumors in nude mice xenografts. Histologically, the tumors of KCC-1a cells were clear cell carcinoma, whereas those of KCC-1b cells were tubular adenocarcinoma. These findings suggest that KCC-1a and KCC-1b cells will provide useful information to clarify the histogenesis of endometrial carcinoma combined with clear cell carcinoma.\r"

  ".W": "A correlated histopathologic and molecular virologic study of 30 cases of vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia Grade 3 (VIN 3) and six associated invasive vulvar carcinomas was performed. Paraffin sections were examined for human papillomavirus (HPV) types 6, 11, 16, and 18 by in situ hybridization for viral transcripts and by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for amplification of HPV and of the beta-globin gene. Vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia Grade 3 was histologically subclassified into warty (bowenoid) (20 cases) and basaloid (undifferentiated) (ten cases) types. Warty VIN characteristically was composed of squamous cells displaying abnormal proliferation and maturation and an undulating or spiked surface creating a \"condylomatous\" appearance whereas basaloid VIN had a smooth surface and was composed of undifferentiated basaloid cells resembling carcinoma in situ of the cervix. Human papillomavirus-16 was the only type detected in 16 of 30 VIN 3 and in five of six invasive carcinomas. The HPV-positive women were younger than HPV-negative women (mean age at diagnosis, 49 versus 60 years), their lesions more frequently demonstrated koilocytotic atypia (94% versus 43%), and they were more likely to have warty compared with basaloid VIN lesions (65% versus 30%). These findings suggest that there are at least two different types of VIN which have differing clinical, pathologic, and viral profiles.\r"

The pi GSH S-T are present in relative abundance in ductular, as opposed to parenchymal cells in the liver, pancreas, salivary glands, and kidney. The presence of mu GSH S-T in the tissues of certain patients and its absence in the same tissues from other patients has been demonstrated. The pi GSH S-T seems to be most persistently and strongly expressed in tumors but alpha GSH S-T are also found in some neoplasms whereas the mu GSH S-T are occasionally present when the other two transferases are weak or absent.\r"

  ".W": "Hodgkin's disease (HD) was diagnosed in 24 patients who were either seropositive for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) (21) or members of a high-risk group (three), but had not developed acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). Clinical presentation of the disease was characterized by constitutional symptoms in all, especially fever (23/24) and disseminated disease (22/24) at diagnosis. Mediastinal adenopathy was rare. Bone marrow involvement was particularly frequent (12/24), and a positive bone marrow biopsy preceded lymph node biopsy in 5 of the 12. Histopathologic features of these tumors included an increased number of nonlymphoid stromal cells, i.e., histiocytic and/or fibroblastoid. In some tumors these fibrohistiocytoid stromal cells were arranged in bundles, but distinct nodule with birefringent collagen band formation was not observed. Twenty-two patients were treated, most with combination chemotherapy; one was untreated; one, unknown. Sixteen, including the one untreated, died with disease at 3 to 25 months; one died of an unrelated cause; four were alive at 3 to 24 months; three were lost to follow-up. Frequent bone marrow involvement at presentation suggests the usefulness of the bone marrow biopsy for diagnosis in subjects at risk, especially when they present with spiking fever of unknown origin. Contrary to most previous series, virtually all of our cases were of mixed cellularity type, characterized by increased fibrohistiocytoid stromal cells in place of depleting lymphocytes. The classic nodular sclerosing feature with birefringent collagen band formation was not observed. In conclusion, HIV-associated HD was characterized by advanced stage with fever at presentation, preponderance of mixed cellularity histologic type with increased fibrohistiocytoid stromal cells, and poor outcome. Hodgkin's disease in AIDS patients presents an intriguing biological model to study the role of stromal histiocytes in immunodeficient patients.\r"

The HTLV-I DNA was detected by southern blot analysis and/or polymerase chain reaction in the lymph nodes of all cases. The nodal architecture was preserved. Some scattered or aggregated highly lobular, cerebriform, or Reed-Sternberg-like giant cells were observed, with occasional mitoses and diffuse infiltration of small to medium-sized lymphocytes, with no or minimal nuclear abnormalities in the enlarged paracortex. The giant cells were usually positive for Ki-1 and also for UCHL-1 and other T-cell markers but negative for Ber-H2. Rearrangement and/or deletion of T-cell receptors were found in three of four patients. All patients died within 2 years, with transformation to overt leukemia-lymphoma occurring in three patients, and pulmonary carcinoma in one. The incipient or prelymphomatous phase of ATLL should be differentiated from Hodgkin's disease because of the distinctly different prognoses of these two diseases.\r"

In this study, BUdR LI and the clinical course of 50 cerebral astrocytic tumors in adults were analyzed. The obtained LI distributed continuously in a broad range from 0% to 19%. The mean LI of 28 glioblastomas, 12 anaplastic astrocytomas, and ten astrocytomas were 8.5%, 4.2%, and 1.2%, respectively, and these differences were statistically significant (P = 0.05). In the analysis of LI and the recurrence-free period (RFP), regardless of the histologic findings, 23 patients with LI more than 5% had a median RFP of 9.0 months; the median RFP of nine patients with LI of 3% to 5% was 14.7 months. Nine of 13 patients with LI less than 3% have not yet recurred after a median follow-up of 36 months. These differences were also statistically significant by the generalized Wilcoxon test (P = 0.05). The proliferative potential reflected by the BUdR LI is a good clinical indicator for predicting the rate of tumor growth in cerebral astrocytic tumors. In combination with histologic diagnosis, BUdR LI could help in determining a patient's prognosis more precisely.\r"

Sixty-one percent of the carcinomas had a distinct aneuploid DNA pattern. The proportion of aneuploid carcinomas was significantly higher in the advanced Dukes' stages than in the localized ones. A highly significant association was found between DNA ploidy pattern and degree of cellular atypia, whereas no association was demonstrated between DNA ploidy pattern and histologic grade. This finding might indicate that cellular atypia has a stronger prognostic impact than the growth pattern of the tumor. The authors suggest that flow cytometric DNA quantification may replace assessment of cellular atypia in the histologic evaluation. Furthermore, together with earlier findings by others, these results indicate that the degree of cellular atypia may be conserved during the development from adenomas to carcinomas.\r"

This disease may involve the vulva, vagina, cervix, endometrium, and ovary. Four distinct patient groups, segregated on the basis of initial presentation and subsequent anatomic extent of disease, were categorized as follows: (1) \"pure\" genital LCH, (2) genital LCH with subsequent multi-organ involvement, (3) oral or cutaneous LCH with subsequent genital and multi-organ involvement, and (4) diabetes insipidus with subsequent genital and multi-organ disease. Although involvement of the genital tract can occur at any age, it is most common in young adulthood. Clinically, LCH may mimic either primary neoplasia or various inflammatory lesions; the major pathologic differential diagnosis is venereal and other inflammatory diseases. The pure genital form may have a distinct nosologic position in the spectrum of LCH similar to the \"pure,\" self-limited cutaneous histiocytosis seen in infants. There is no correlation between histologic findings and the outcome of the genital lesions. There is also no correlation between clinical presentation and/or the extent of involvement and outcome of genital lesions; complete regression, partial improvement, persistent lesions, and recurrences were seen in all four groups of patients. The treatment of genital LCH is not well defined and is highly individualized. Therapy has included surgery, radiation, topical corticosteroids, topical nitrogen mustard, systemic chemotherapy, and combination therapy; mixed results were obtained with all treatment modalities. Although no modality has been shown to yield a superior outcome, complete surgical excision is advocated as initial therapy.\r"

  ".W": "Paraffin-embedded, giant-step sections of 13 bladders with transitional cell carcinomas were stained with monoclonal anti-A or anti-B antibodies to investigate whether intraepithelial dysplastic lesions are related to obvious tumors. Normal and/or hyperplastic lesions were retained in only eight bladders; severe dysplasia and/or carcinoma in situ were found in all bladders except two. AB-antigen expression was retained in intraepithelial lesions of bladders with invasive carcinoma. Most intraepithelial lesions were AB-antigen negative in bladders with frequently recurrent tumors. In bladders with initially multiple tumors, AB-antigen expression was negative in almost one half of the intraepithelial lesions. Therefore, it appears likely that most multiple or recurrent bladder carcinomas arise from dysplastic cells in intraepithelial lesions which have acquired malignant potential; initially invasive tumors quickly develop from a limited lesion acquiring a high malignant potential without changes of cell phenotype in most intraepithelial lesions.\r"

  ".W": "Of 49 cases of synovial sarcoma, which represent 5.8% of all soft tissue sarcomas with confirmed diagnosis in the files of the Kiel Pediatric Tumor Registry (Kiel, Germany), 35 occurred in patients up to the age of 18 years. The lower extremities were the most common. The 35 cases included 21 biphasic and 14 monophasic fibrous synovial sarcomas. The different cell types constituting synovial sarcoma could be demonstrated by conventional light microscopic study, but more readily so by immunohistochemical study, particularly when antibodies against cytoskeletal components were applied. Aberrant antigen expression was noticed for the neural markers, protein S-100, and neuron-specific enolase. Moreover, four tumors were positive for Ki M7. Collagen type IV was found in all tumors tested. For the 20 patients enrolled in the Cooperative Soft Tissue Sarcoma Study of the German Society of Pediatric Oncology (GPO) the survival rate at 7 years is 63%. When five patients with initial recurrence are excluded, the survival rate is 72%. It is concluded that immunohistochemical study is useful in the diagnosis and differential diagnosis of synovial sarcomas despite certain limitations. Multimodality treatment approach has improved the overall prognosis. There is no relationship between histologic subtype and prognosis according to the classification scheme employed in this study.\r"

One hundred twenty-one patients who had primary carcinomas of the nasopharynx who were treated solely by ionizing radiation (according to the specifications of a Radiation Therapy Oncology Group protocol) were identified and their subsequent well-being was reviewed. Overall there was a 4.1% incidence of second malignancies (2% after 3 years, 5% after 5 years, and 8% after 8 years) with most arising in the upper aerodigestive tract. This rate is significantly less than the rate associated with other head and neck sites. It is not significantly different from the rate of first malignancies observed in an age-matched and sex-matched population. When only those patients who were free of all evidence of neoplastic disease 6 months after the completion of radiotherapy are considered, similar analysis leads to similar outcomes. The authors conclude that the risk of second malignancies after the successful irradiation of carcinomas of the nasopharynx is substantially less than after treatment of tumors at other head and neck sites.\r"

Breast cancers demonstrating such a thermographic abnormality have been reported to be associated with decreased survival when compared with patients with no such change. In a study of 214 patients confirmed to have breast cancer without distant metastases, 121 were found to have a thermographic abnormality. Patients whose tumors were thermographically abnormal had significantly larger primary lesions and a higher proportion of metastatic axillary lymph nodes. However, both the 5-year survival and the 5-year disease-free survival were not significantly different from patients who had no thermographic abnormality.\r"

Circadian rhythms were detected in all groups with acrophases around 2 AM for melatonin and around 3 AM for 6-sulfatoxymelatonin. The nocturnal melatonin and 6-sulfatoxymelatonin concentrations were significantly depressed in the group of patients with primary breast cancer compared with controls (P less than 0.01, P less than 0.025). The circadian amplitudes of melatonin and 6-sulfatoxymelatonin were also depressed by 81% (P less than 0.01) and 63% (P less than 0.01). In contrast, patients with secondary BC had nocturnal melatonin and 6-sulfatoxymelatonin concentrations and amplitudes similar to controls. These results demonstrate that the depression of circulating melatonin in patients with primary BC is not due to an enhanced degradation to 6-sulfatoxymelatonin in the liver but must be due to a reduced activity of the pineal gland.\r"

  ".U": "91159945\r", 
  ".W": "In 58 breast cancer patients with meningeal carcinomatosis (MC) pretreatment characteristics, clinical course, and response to treatment were evaluated. Forty-four patients were uniformly treated with intraventricular chemotherapy. Fourteen patients did not receive intraventricular treatment. In the intraventricularly treated group the median survival was 12 weeks. Multivariate analysis of the pretreatment characteristics of the intraventricularly treated patients demonstrated a prognostic significance with respect to survival for age older than 55 years, lung metastases, cranial nerve involvement, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) glucose less than 2.5 mmol/l, and CSF protein 0.51 to 1.0 g/l. Based on the significance of these predicting factors a prognostic index (PI) identified four groups of patients with a median survival of 43 weeks, 22 weeks, 11 weeks, and 3 weeks, respectively. After 6 weeks of intraventricular treatment 22 patients showed a neurologic improvement or stabilization, and nine patients showed a worsening of the neurologic signs, whereas 13 patients (30%) had already died. The responders had a median additional survival of 5 months versus 1 month for nonresponders. No relation was found between survival and intensity of the intraventricular treatment after the first 6 weeks of treatment. Almost all long survivors had also received systemic treatment for systemic disease, whereas most patients who died within 6 months did not receive systemic therapy. Radiation therapy had no influence on the survival time. Early death due to the intensive treatment occurred in three patients. In 11 of the 17 patients who survived more than 4 months an often seriously debilitating late neurotoxicity developed. The survival curve of the nonintraventricularly treated patients appeared to be essentially the same as the curve of the intraventricularly treated patients. Using the same PI the predicted survival time was also the same as in the intraventricularly treated group. It is concluded that survival in MC from breast carcinoma may be more dependent on some pretreatment characteristics than on treatment intensity. On the basis of these pretreatment characteristics the survival time seems to be predictable. Finally, late neurotoxicity due to aggressive treatment leads to impairment of the quality of life in more than 50% of the long survivors. The exact value of intraventricular and systemic therapy in patients with MC still has to be determined.\r"

Of colorectal cancer cases, 33 cases with multiple carcinomas had a significantly higher gallstone incidence than cases with a solitary carcinoma--24.2% and 5.5%, respectively. The mean age was 5 years older in gallstone cases than in those without gallstones in both cancer groups, and it was 4 years older in multiple-carcinoma cases than in solitary-carcinoma cases in the colorectal cancer group. These results suggest that the higher levels of same causative factors (i.e., dietary fat) are associated with a longer duration of gallstone formation and colorectal cancer development as demonstrated by multiple colorectal-carcinoma cases.\r"

The authors compared the responses of 132 consecutive cases of DN, 186 consecutive cases of cutaneous melanoma, and 239 controls attending the same subspecialty clinic to questions regarding sun sensitivity, sun exposure, and other possible risk factors. Dysplastic nevus cases were younger than controls and were of a higher social class, as indicated by more years of formal education. Sun sensitivity (assessed by reported depth of tan after multiple exposures) was associated with both DN risk and melanoma risk after controlling for age and education in logistic regression analysis (P = 0.009 and 0.03, respectively), but for DN risk this association was nonlinear: the relative risks (versus deep tan) were 2.3 for average tanners, 2.8 for light tanners, and 1.6 for those who reported practically no tan. Sun exposure measures were not associated with DN risk after controlling for age and education, whether or not depth of tan was controlled in the analysis. These observations suggest a role for either sunlight or a trait linked with sun sensitivity in the development of dysplastic nevi.\r"

An elevated stomach cancer risk was associated with low antecedent serum ferritin levels, with more than a threefold excess among those in the lowest compared with the highest ferritin quintile. The risk did not vary with the time between blood collection and stomach cancer onset, remaining high among those with low ferritin levels 5 or more years before cancer diagnosis. Achlorhydria, diagnosed in a sample of the population about 10 years before the 1970-to-1972 blood collection and up to 25 years before cancer, was an independent marker of stomach cancer risk. In combination, low serum ferritin and achlorhydria were associated with a tenfold increase in the subsequent risk. No effect of transferrin or ceruloplasmin, independent of ferritin, was observed in the gastric cancer risk, and the risk of lung cancer was not related to these three serum proteins. These prospective findings indicate that biologic markers of an increased risk of stomach cancer can be detected long before cancer onset.\r"

  ".W": "Progress in cancer research in the 1980s has led to predictions of a technologic explosion in the 1990s. Yet, with this progress there has been a groundswell of protest at the rapidly escalating costs of health care. More than $600 billion was spent on health care in 1989 and estimates of $1.5 trillion are made for the year 2000. Repeated attempts at cost containment have failed. It has been suggested that only by retarding technologic advances will we be able to control costs. Many observers believe that rationing of health care is the only solution, but new technology not only improves cancer care, it often decreases cost. It is not rational to retard advances that may later reduce costs, nor is it humane to retard advances that improve care, even if they cost more. In identifying priorities we should begin with the principle that treatments be restricted to clinical trials unless they have been demonstrated to prolong survival or improve the quality of life. If the payers reimburse procedures in an investigative setting, they will be on firm ground when they deny support for those same procedures outside an investigative setting. This is both an ethical and a fiscally responsible position for the third parties to take. It will not be easy for the profession or for the payers to deal with these problems. Public education and patient education will be key elements of any solution. Shifting the blame from politician to payer to professional will only make the problems worse.\r"

  ".W": "Dramatic changes will occur in the health care system during the 1990s which will profoundly affect the delivery of care for cancer. Perhaps the most important factor is the aging of the population. As the proportion of people who achieve old age increases, the absolute prevalence and incidence of cancer will increase despite improved treatment techniques. This phenomenon will increase health care expenditures despite ongoing efforts to control costs. Second, there will be continuing efforts at cost control and increased emphasis on quality assurance and outcomes by third party payers. Providers will be scrutinized and compared with one another. The large payers of the nation's health care bills will demand proof of outcome and cost leading to bidding by providers and payment only to those who have the best outcome for the least money. Third, there will be an increasing emphasis on prevention and screening, in public health policy, an approach that may conflict with personal freedom. Fourth, there will be increasing deliberations and questions about the ethics of the health care system and treatment decisions. There will be continuing debate about the need for a rationing of health care and the right of individual privacy versus the states' right to preserve life. These changes will impact on all health care professionals whose practice includes patients with cancer.\r"

Less sweeping but significant proposals affecting cancer care were considered by Congress. For example, positive actions were taken on anti-smoking and food labeling proposals.

Overall, however, 20% to 35% will experience recurrence with local therapy only. Adjuvant chemotherapy or tamoxifen have prolonged disease-free survival (DFS), but not overall survival (OS). Unanswered questions of optimal end point (DFS or OS) and the risk of treating many to benefit few have prompted clinicians to use prognostic indicators to facilitate treatment recommendations. Currently, the most readily available and accurate information comes from TNM staging, pathologic features, and hormone receptors. Ploidy, S-phase fraction, HER-2-neu amplification or over-expression, and cathepsin-D may be useful prognostic indices. Until a more precise system of weighing several prognostic variables is developed, the decision to recommend adjuvant systemic therapy in this generally good prognosis group will have to be thoughtfully considered by patient and physician. Whenever possible, patients should be encouraged to enter clinical trials.\r"

  ".W": "Approximately 25% of women with early stage breast cancer and negative axillary nodes will eventually die of metastatic disease. Some studies have shown a recurrence rate of 40% or more at 10 years in this relatively good prognostic group. The incidence of breast cancer continues to increase approximately 1% per year with a great increase in the frequency of early stage disease (particularly in situ carcinoma). The increased use of mammography and physical examination with appropriate follow-up will increase the frequency of diagnosis of node-negative patients compared with those with more advanced stages. Women with positive axillary nodes who are premenopausal benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy, whereas those who are postmenopausal have shown a clear reduction in mortality when treated with tamoxifen. It is even more reasonable to speculate that women with node-negative disease could have an even greater benefit from adjuvant therapy because they have a lower tumor burden at the time of diagnosis. Compared with earlier clinical adjuvant trials, more recent studies (1981-89) have shown a disease-free survival advantage for node-negative breast cancer patients treated with adjuvant chemotherapy. Hopefully, the differences noticed in disease-free survival will show a similar survival advantage with further observations. The results of these clinical trials suggest that adjuvant chemotherapy may be of benefit to patients with node-negative disease but do not support the contention that all node-negative patients with breast cancer should receive adjuvant chemotherapy. Some prognostic subgroups (tumor size greater than 2 cm) have shown an overall 10-year survival rate of 92% for women who have not received adjuvant therapy. The benefits versus toxicities of adjuvant therapy should be carefully evaluated before the initiation of adjuvant therapy.\r"

  ".W": "Access to health care has always been limited by personal and social economics. Poverty remains one element that correlates with poor prognosis in all varieties of cancer. Prior to becoming standard therapy, elements of high-tech health care are often widely available as research protocols, participation in which is generally available without considerations of insurance coverage or personal wealth. Any person may still volunteer participation in research protocols and thereby partake in high-tech advances even before these become standard therapy. However, recent developments in the conduct of research now may limit participation. Medicare and third party insurance payers proscribe payment for research project care and always have. Recently, more than ever before, reimbursements to physicians and health care institutions have been more closely scrutinized to reject all payment in research settings. In situations in which cost and availability of the new technology, whether machine or drug, limit participation, research entrepreneurs have made research participation available to only those who can pay for it. These and similar developments threaten to limit access to high-tech health care and to actually impede cancer research.\r"

These efforts raise three questions: (1) Why attempt to measure quality? (2) What is the best way to measure quality of care of the cancer patient? and (3) What must be done to achieve this? Three main reasons for measuring quality of patient care are to describe the current state, plan strategies for improvement, and implement and monitor improvements. To measure quality, both the definition of quality and the tools available for measurement must be addressed. The difficulty in developing a measurable definition of quality is achieving agreement on the measurable components of quality. The tools to measure quality have evolved to focus on monitoring of key indicators for comparative use. The utility of indicators lies in demonstrating that they have the capacity to identify opportunities for improving care. The Joint Commission is improving measurement tools through the development and testing of oncology indicators for reliability and the capacity to identify opportunities for improving care. The development and teaching of new quality improvement methods to health care professionals also is necessary.\r"

The author advocates an increased focus on prepaid delivery systems like Kaiser Permanente as the best vehicle to achieve the full promise of health screening, health education, and life-style modification. Because these systems have brought the proper incentives into alignment, prevention and health promotion have become effective tools to achieve cost containment goals. A number of Kaiser Permanente projects are highlighted that demonstrate integration of public health preventive medicine and curative medicine: the Northern California Region's uniform health appraisal examination, which is linked with health education and counseling; the Colorado Region's breast cancer screening program, which is expected to show a higher rate of early breast cancer detection than in the general population; cooperative efforts with two Northern California towns to reduce smoking through a community-wide project; educational theatre programs aimed at early intervention and education of children before high-risk behaviors have become established life-style; and research projects that are possible because of an integrated program. Also, several forces that could endanger integrated systems including cost control practices of employers and insurers, and public policy such as mandating specific benefits, are noted.\r"

Changes in immigration laws, illegal and legal immigration into this country, and the aging of the \"baby boomers\" will all result in profound changes in the demographics of this country. These demographic changes will necessitate alterations in all aspects of the health care system. This article focuses on the projected changes that will occur in relation to the elderly, Hispanics, Asian Americans, and the economically disadvantaged, and on the related implications for health care professionals. The cancer incidence and mortality rates for each discussed minority group differ from the rates presently reported for white Americans. Thus, health professionals will have to be aware of the differences among these groups and tailor their primary and secondary prevention efforts accordingly. The future task for all health care providers serving minorities and the elderly will be to familiarize themselves with the special health problems of the population with whom they work and with the ethnocultural barriers that deter proper use and delivery of health services.\r"

Access to clinical trials has been enhanced by the adoption by the NCI of a promotional campaign that involves seminars, dissemination of information to national and local news media, and assisting in making information about clinical trials available to patients and physicians. Factors that hinder accrual of patients to clinical trials include: (1) physicians' concern about losing contact with patients, (2) physicians who feel that \"experimental therapy\" is not as good as \"standard therapy,\" and (3) the time it takes to discuss and implement clinical trials. Reimbursement for clinical trials has also become a major concern. Who should pay for clinical research? Many insurance companies have been reluctant to pay for \"experimental therapy\" but will pay for \"standard therapy.\" If this trend continues, the whole concept and organization of clinical trials, i.e., Phase I, II, and III trials, will be greatly hindered. Solutions must be found, and third party payers need to realize that an investment in clinical trials today will decrease the long term costs of state-of-the-art care.\r"

  ".W": "The availability of alternative therapies for many health problems is a well-documented historical fact. Alternative therapies are generally understood to be those therapies outside of the usually accepted medical therapies for disease processes, such as cancer, arthritis, diabetes, psoriasis, lupus, and AIDS. Some other descriptive terms utilized include questionable, unproven, dubious, unorthodox, and unconventional. These alternative therapies vary from active involvement in promotion of one's own health (exercise, diet) to quackery. In today's society, with emphasis on self-involvement with individual health, metabolic therapies have become the most widely practiced alternative therapy. In an antiestablishment, anti-intellectual climate, with an increasingly mobile, rootless population, alternative therapies are in somewhat of a renaissance. Some confusion exists regarding clinical trials and alternative therapies in the general population and in the noninvolved health profession. Various studies indicate that from 10% to 50% of cancer patients use some alternative therapy, with national expenditures ranging as high as $10 billion annually. Better-educated patients with higher-than-average income are more likely to choose alternative therapies and are frequently supported by a physician in this choice. Most cancer patients continue under a physician's care and continue usual therapy while pursuing alternative methods. Approximately 5% of cancer patients abandon appropriate therapy and pursue potentially harmful alternative methods. A variety of sociomedical questions are brought forth by studies of the use of alternative therapies. A great need for public and professional education regarding this subject is evident.\r"

The reluctance of third party payers to reimburse for experimental therapy and the growing practice of providers to limit resources allocated for the care of cancer patients undergoing such therapies seriously curtail the ability of investigators to test new cancer treatments clinically. In addition, certain beliefs, attitudes, and perceptions held by the public may interfere with patient case accrual. Nurses can help facilitate both accrual to and conduct of clinical research. This article addresses selected consumer- and provider-centered factors that inhibit clinical research. The expanding role of the nurse in the areas of public education, informed consent, direct care, and collaborative research is also described.\r"

Oncologists may or may not be consulted depending on tumor type and past experiences of the physician, patient, and patient's family. Many primary care physicians think that chemotherapy regimens given empirically have little if any scientific evidence to support their use. Side effects of cancer treatment regimens often cause suffering and profoundly effect quality of life. There is a lack of communication between oncologists and primary care physicians. Dialogue between oncologists and primary care doctors may help solve communication problems. Clinical trials help determine which treatments are effective. Many clinical trials are conducted at the community hospital level. Most primary care physicians support clinical trials once they know about them. Education activities should be directed at promoting patient referral for participation in clinical trials.\r"

With the selection of Miami by the American Cancer Society as one of three sites for conducting a screening demonstration project for the socioeconomically disadvantaged, this program has recently been expanded to include pelvic screening for women, aged 40 and older, and prostate screening for men, aged 65 and older.\r"

Another issue is that although the articles quoted refer mainly to secondary and tertiary prevention, they do apply equally to primary prevention and health promotion. Furthermore, the twin issues of priority and ethnic/cultural differences need to be addressed insofar as they affect health risks, risk reduction efforts, early diagnosis, treatment, and rehabilitation/disability reduction. Finally, the point is made that social and structural change of this magnitude cannot occur in the health care system and society at large without the allocation of discrete private and public sector resources.\r"

For patients who fail to achieve those results and for those with tumors that are rarely amenable to specific therapy, the choice of less surely effective therapy is an option; the patient must participate in the decision, armed with as much information and insight as possible, for conventional and experimental treatment. A distinction must be made between specific antitumor therapy and palliative measures for which cessation is never an option. Happily, cessation of treatment must also be considered when therapy has been so successful that the patient has achieved complete remission. At what point may treatment be discontinued without the danger of relapse? These issues are rarely crisply defined, but primary concern for the patient and careful analysis of the available data can lead to appropriate value judgements.\r"

These lead to maximum output figures for the device ranging from 15 dB HL at 250 Hz to 60 dB HL at 6000 Hz for the body-worn amplifier, and from 6 dB HL at 250 Hz to 42 dB HL at 6000 Hz for the ear-level amplifier.

Prosthesis-related complications, which were encountered in 28%, were all of a minor nature and mainly consisted of granulation formation and hypertrophic scarring; these appeared to be easily treatable. The complications found were few and insignificant in comparison with reports in the literature. This may be attributed to the uncomplicated surgical procedure for the insertion of the Groningen button. Moreover, the prosthesis is self-retaining and requires hardly any care from the patient. Permanent removal of the prosthesis usually requires surgical closure, which is a simple procedure performed under local anaesthesia.\r"

In spite of complete control of attacks a disabling ablation type of unsteadiness and dizziness affected 7 patients. Two patients required additional treatment after 5-8 months remission.

It is, however, a possible alternative to surgical labyrinthectomy with a fair chance of residual hearing preservation.\r"

Staining of type I and III collagens was not observed in glomeruli from normal individuals or patients with mild glomerulonephritis. In the advanced stages of glomerulonephritis, the staining of type IV and VI collagens, laminin and fibronectin was marked in the glomerular mesangium, and the distribution of fibronectin extended to the glomerular capillary walls in the sclerotic lesions of glomeruli. However, the staining intensity of type IV collagen, laminin and fibronectin was gradually decreased during the progression of glomerular sclerosis. On the other hand, the staining of type I and III collagens was observed focally in sclerotic or hyalinotic glomeruli and around such glomeruli in those patients. Light microscopic examination revealed that patients who showed marked staining of type I and III collagens by immunofluorescence had severe damage of Bowman's capsules. These results suggest that the hyperproduction and/or invasion of interstitial collagens, i.e., types I and III, are closely linked to the progression of glomerular sclerosis and hyalinosis in patients with various types of glomerulonephritis.\r"

The patients were allocated to group 1, consisting of 27 patients who died within one year and to group 2, consisting of 10 patients who survived for more than 36 months. Renal failure was severe enough to require dialysis in 28 patients, 16 of whom were oliguric. Renal biopsy was performed in 23 cases, whereas light chain isoelectric point and serum beta 2-microglobulin levels were evaluated in each patient. All the patients underwent chemotherapy, which was associated with plasma exchange in 16 patients. Statistical analysis of the potential prognostic factors in the 2 groups showed that the incidence of hypercalcemia, infection, irreversible renal failure and severe tubulo-interstitial damage was significantly higher in group 1. Sex, tumor load, severity of renal failure and light chain isoelectric point had no prognostic significance. Finally, the number of patients treated by plasma exchange was significantly higher in group 2. Our results underline the prognostic role of both hypercalcemia and infection and justify aggressive treatment consisting of chemotherapy, plasma exchange and dialysis, even in cases of severe renal failure and high tumor load.\r"

Plasma paracetamol concentration was unaffected by age and GFR, whereas the sulphate and glucuronide metabolites of paracetamol accumulated substantially in patients with renal failure, and to a lesser degree in elderly controls. Serum TXB2 was significantly reduced 1 and 4 hours after oral ingestion of a single dose of paracetamol (18 mg/kg), but the values were normalized after 12 hours. Urinary sodium excretion was reduced by 23.4% on the first treatment day in elderly controls, but unchanged in young controls and in patients with renal failure. Urinary excretion of PGE2 was unchanged in young controls, but reduced by 35.9% on the first day on paracetamol treatment in elderly controls and from 22-29% on the 3 days on paracetamol in patients with impaired renal function. Paracetamol was without effect on potassium homeostasis or on the excretion of glandular kallikrein or proteins in urine. Our study indicates that oral treatment with paracetamol in therapeutic doses reversibly reduces serum TXB2 for at least 4 hours after ingestion both in healthy controls and in patients with impaired renal function. Our data also suggest that paracetamol effects renal PGE2 excretion, especially in patients with impaired renal function. Renal glomerular and tubular function parameters were unchanged by paracetamol.\r"

Patients at the University of Oklahoma Teaching Hospitals scheduled for elective cardiac catheterization had their creatinine clearance measured on the day preceding and the day following their procedure. All patients had a serum creatinine concentration lower than 175 mumol/l. The creatinine clearance was calculated from the mean of four consecutive 30-minute renal clearance periods obtained in the fasted state during water loading. The change in renal function following the catheterization was evaluated. There was no significant change in the creatinine clearance after the cardiac catheterization (Ccr 101.5 +/- 6.4 ml/min before and 111.6 +/- 7.4 ml/min after the procedure). A decrease in Ccr exceeding 25% occurred in 1 of 23 subjects (4.3%. Patient age, presence of diabetes, and volume of contrast agent were not adverse risk factors. The results suggest a low risk of nephrotoxicity in low-risk patients undergoing elective cardiac catheterization, even when very sensitive measures of glomerular filtration rate are utilized.\r"

In addition, some experimental evidence suggests that hyperlipidemia may accelerate progression of renal disease. We have studied 65 patients with CRF (S-creatinine 1.5-9.0 mg/dl), 52.3% of whom were hypertensive. Patients were divided in 2 groups matched for age, sex and degree of renal failure: group 1 was kept for 36 +/- 8 months on a free diet; group 2 was kept for 39 +/- 6 months on a low-protein diet with an elevated polyunsaturated/saturated fatty acid (PUFA/SFA) ratio. We found significantly higher levels of triglycerides (TG) and lower levels of esterified cholesterol in high density lipoprotein (HDL-C) in group 1 than in group 2. Patients on the diet had a lower percentage of membrane SFA and a higher percentage of PUFA than patients on free diet. Only in group 1 a direct correlation between cholesterol/phospholipid (Chol/P) ratio and age was observed; in group 2, a negative correlation between levels of PUFA and TG and between linoleic/oleic (Lin/Ol) ratio and serum Chol was shown. S-creatinine levels were directly correlated with Chol/P ratio in group 1 and indirectly with Lin/Ol ratio and PUFA in group 2. These data show that a low-protein diet, containing an elevated PUFA/SFA ratio, is able to counteract lipid abnormalities in patients with CRF and the normalization of this pattern is associated with significant improvement of membrane lipid composition and, presumably, of \"functional\" activity of cell membranes with a better control of supposed \"renal lipoprotein toxicity\".\r"

  ".W": "To obtain information on the effects of the correction of uremic anemia on cardiac function and size, nine normotensive dialyzed patients were studied before, during and six months after the start of i.v. treatment with recombinant human erythropoietin (rHuEPO). Pulsed-doppler echocardiographic determinations of the cardiac index (CI) and M-Mode echocardiographic estimations of the indexed left ventricular end diastolic diameter (LVEDDi), interventricular septum (IVSi), left ventricular posterior wall (LVPWi), with calculations of the left ventricular mass index (LVMi), were made on every occasion. Mean (+/- SD) hemoglobin (Hb) concentration before rHuEPO was 5.9 +/- 1.3 g/dl and rose significantly (p less than 0.0001) up to the third month, then remained constant. Baseline CI (3.4 +/- 0.6 l/min/m2bsa) was significantly higher (p less than 0.0001) than in healthy subjects (2.5 +/- 0.5 l), and decreased after the third month to a value (2.8 +/- 0.5 l) no longer different from that of controls. From pooled baseline and third month data, an inverse relationship between Hb and CI was found (p less than 0.0001). Baseline LVEDDi (32.7 +/- 4.3 mm/m2bsa), IVSi (6 +/- 1.1 mm/m2bsa) and LVPWi (5 +/- 0.8 mm/m2bsa) were all significantly higher than in controls. After three months of therapy, the only change was a decrease in LVPWi while after six months all indices, including the LVMi, decreased to values no longer higher than in controls. From pooled baseline and six months data, an inverse relationship between Hb and LVMi was found (p less than 0.0001). We conclude that treatment of uremic patients by rHuEPO is able to renormalize their already increased cardiac output soon after correction of the anemia.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In the present study the binding characteristics of platelet thromboxane A2 receptors have been investigated in nine diabetic patients (type I) and in 15 healthy control subjects by a radioligand-binding method using 9,11-dimethylmethane-11,12-methane-16-[3-125I-4-hydroxyphenyl]-13, 14- dihydro-13-aza-15-tetranor-thromboxane A2 as the radiolabelled ligand. 3. The maximum concentration of binding sites was 163 (SD 35) fmol/10(8) platelets (n = 15) with 987 (SD 209) receptors/platelet in controls, whereas in diabetic patients the maximum concentration of binding sites was 74.2 (SD 28) fmol/10(8) (n = 9) with 447 (SD 172) receptors/platelet (P less than 0.001). The dissociation constants were 18 (SD 4) nmol/l and 21 (SD 6) nmol/l (not significant) in control subjects and in diabetic patients, respectively. Glycated haemoglobin, which is reported to reduce membrane fluidity, was found to be negatively correlated (r = 0.60, P less than 0.05) with thromboxane A2 receptor number in the diabetic patient group. On the contrary, a positive linear correlation between the equilibrium dissociation constant and glycated haemoglobin was found in diabetic patients (r = 0.75, P less than 0.01).\r"

Recent evidence has suggested that the impairment of endothelium-dependent cholinergic relaxation in vitro, which is seen in atherosclerotic large arteries of animals and man, could be part of a general deleterious effect to the endothelium of hypercholesterolaemia. 2. This possibility has been investigated in vitro by measuring the response to acetylcholine, sodium nitroprusside, 5-hydroxytryptamine and noradrenaline in segments of aorta and of femoral, mesenteric and cerebral small arteries (internal diameter approximately 200 microns) from control rabbits (n = 12) and from rabbits fed a 1% (w/w) cholesterol and 3% (w/w) coconut oil diet (n = 12) for 12 weeks. 3. Thoracic aorta segments from the control rabbits exhibited a maximal relaxation in response to acetylcholine of 64 +/- 11% compared with 10 +/- 5% (P less than 0.01) for thoracic segments from cholesterol-fed animals. Cerebral, femoral and mesenteric small arteries exposed to acetylcholine (10(-9)-10(-4) mol/l) relaxed to the same degree as arteries from control rabbits. The responses to sodium nitroprusside and bradykinin of the small arteries from the cholesterol-fed rabbits remained unaffected. 5-Hydroxytryptamine evoked comparable contractions in the small arteries, while the sensitivity to noradrenaline of the femoral small arteries was significantly decreased and the response of cerebral small arteries to noradrenaline in cholesterol-fed rabbits slightly increased compared with control rabbits. 4. Aorta from the cholesterol-fed rabbits had extensive atheromatous lesions. Morphological measurements and histological examination showed unchanged thickness and light microscopic appearance of intima and media of small arteries from cholesterol-fed animals compared with control animals. 5. The present study indicates that hypercholesterolaemia in this rabbit model is followed by atherosclerotic lesions and changed function of large arteries, but that both function and structure of systemic small arteries are largely unaffected.\r"

The increase in choline flux in patients on haemodialysis and patients on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis compared with control subjects was highly significant (P less than 0.001). 3. Renal transplant patients showed variable values for the Vmax. of choline influx (range 17.7-71.7 mumol h-1 l-1 cells). The values showed a significant negative correlation with creatinine clearance and this correlation correctly extrapolated to the maximum choline flux in normal subjects and in patients on dialysis. 4.

In addition, angiotensin II binding and the contractile response to angiotensin II were studied in glomeruli isolated from cirrhotic and control rats. 2. Cirrhotic rats had a higher glomerular filtration rate and a higher renal plasma flow than control animals. A non-pressor dose of angiotensin II induced small but significant decreases in glomerular filtration rate and renal plasma flow in both control and cirrhotic rats, the effect on renal plasma flow being the most pronounced. 3. Plasma renin and aldosterone concentrations were similar in control and cirrhotic rats. 4. The cross-sectional area of glomeruli from cirrhotic rats was 42% greater than that of glomeruli from control animals. Angiotensin II (10(-9) mol/l) decreased the cross-sectional area of glomeruli from control animals by 6.4 +/- 0.9% and of glomeruli from cirrhotic rats by 6.6 +/- 0.8% (P = not significant for comparison between control and cirrhotic animals). 5. There were no differences between control and cirrhotic rats in the affinity of angiotensin II for its glomerular receptors. However, the angiotensin II receptor density was higher in cirrhotic than in control rats, thereby producing an increased total angiotensin II binding in cirrhotic rats. 6. Since no functional differences between control and cirrhotic animals were present in the response to angiotensin II, even though angiotensin II binding was increased, a post-receptor blockade of the angiotensin II signal could be present in cirrhotic rats.\r"

Subjects received an infusion of angiotensin II at two doses (0.5 and 1.0 ng min-1 kg-1) on two occasions. Before one study they took a single dose of carbidopa (100 mg) by mouth. 3. The plasma concentrations of angiotensin II produced by the infusion were similar on both study days. Angiotensin II infusion reduced urinary dopamine excretion on the control day. Urinary dopamine excretion was undetectable at all times after carbidopa, but carbidopa did not change the basal excretion rate of sodium. Despite inhibition of renal dopamine synthesis, the reductions in both absolute and fractional sodium excretion during the angiotensin II infusion were not different from those seen in the control study. 4. The reductions in glomerular filtration rate and effective renal plasma flow which occurred during angiotensin II infusion were not modified by pretreatment with carbidopa. 5. The renal response to angiotensin II is not modulated either wholly or in part by endogenous intrarenal dopamine levels. The fall in urinary dopamine excretion which occurs during angiotensin II infusion is consistent with a modulatory role for tubular reabsorptive capacity in the regulation of proximal tubular dopamine synthesis.\r"

To investigate the reasons for the failure of the model, an extended sampling period was used to define the time course of Indocyanine Green in plasma in six healthy subjects and in six patients with cirrhosis of the liver after a bolus injection of the dye. 4. Indocyanine Green was measurable in the plasma for up to 10 h after injection in healthy subjects, and up to 48 h after injection in the patients. The plasma elimination curve in both groups was best described by a triexponential function. 5. The clearance of Indocyanine Green calculated using data collected in the first 20 min after injection overestimated that calculated using data collected for as long as Indocyanine Green was measurable in the plasma. In the patients with cirrhosis the mean overestimate was 87%. 6. Thus, a two-compartment pharmacokinetic model was inappropriate for the description of the disposition of Indocyanine Green and estimates of the hepatic extraction ratio obtained using this model in patients with cirrhosis were inaccurate.\r"

Factors influencing the total body and renal clearances of inulin were investigated in a total of 37 healthy adult volunteers and 10 patients with stable chronic renal failure after the single intravenous injection of a dose of 70 mg/kg given over 5 min. 2. The elimination of inulin was highly concentration-dependent, and in healthy volunteers the renal clearance fell from 103.7 +/- 14.4 ml min-1 1.73 m-2 during the first hour after administration to 49.1 +/- 20.9 ml min-1 1.73 m-2 over the period 6-8 h. In the patients with renal failure the renal clearance fell correspondingly from 39.7 +/- 16.5 to 26.6 +/- 8.6 ml min-1 1.73 m-2. There were no changes in the simultaneously measured clearances of creatinine. 3. The values obtained for the total body clearance of inulin after a single injection depend critically on dose, the number and timing of blood samples, the choice of pharmacokinetic model, the number of data points chosen for estimation of the slope of the terminal elimination phase for analysis by the methods of residuals, and the weighting used for curve fitting by non-linear regression analysis. 4. With standardized conditions of sampling from 0 to 2 h and weighted non-linear regression analysis of the plasma concentration-time data, the total body and renal clearances of inulin were almost identical in subjects with normal renal function at 105.2 +/- 10.2 and 102.9 +/- 13.0 ml min-1 1.73 m-2. In the patients with chronic renal failure sampling was continued for 3 h and the corresponding clearances were 40.4 +/- 15.3 and 38.9 +/- 15.7 ml min-1 1.73 m-2. 5. The 0-2 h total body and renal clearances of inulin were measured by the single injection method and the renal clearance was measured by the standard constant infusion method on different occasions in 10 healthy volunteers. The respective clearances were similar at 101.4 +/- 6.6, 94.9 +/- 11.9 and 88.4 +/- 12.1 ml min-1 1.73 m-2. 6. The reproducibility of the single injection and constant infusion methods was compared by measuring the inulin clearance with both techniques on three occasions in separate groups of eight and nine healthy volunteers. The mean coefficient of variation for the total body clearance with the single injection method was only 3.9% compared with 9.5% for the renal clearance determined the same way and 12.0% for the renal clearance during constant infusion.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

Fasting plasma acetate levels were measured in 10 ileostomy patients and compared with those in 21 control subjects. Values in ileostomy patients (21.3 +/- 0.8 mumol/l) were significantly lower than in control subjects (48.0 +/- 4.2 mumol/l). 3. Plasma acetate concentration was estimated in eight healthy volunteers during 108 h of continuous fasting. Acetate concentrations rose significantly from 12 h (43.9 +/- 4.4 mumol/l) to 108 h of starvation (114.0 +/- 15.6 mumol/l) and fell back to normal fasting values on refeeding and another 12 h fast (44.3 +/- 4.7 mumol/l). 4. When colonic fermentation was stimulated after oral ingestion of 10 g of lactulose, the plasma acetate concentration increased significantly (from 44.0 +/- 7.4 to 114.4 +/- 16.2 mumol/l) in seven healthy control subjects. This rise was not affected by concomitant dosage of metronidazole. 5. These data suggest that there are at least two major sources of acetate in man, an endogenous source and the colon which probably becomes more important when fermentation of carbohydrate is occurring.\r"

Sera from 11 highly sensitized multiparous dialysis patients were studied in order to define the target antigens, antibody class and relationship with paternal HLA class I antigens of the underlying lymphocytotoxic antibodies. All sera contained lymphocytotoxic antibodies to over 70% of a panel of lymphocytes from 24 donors (panel reactivity greater than 70%). 2. Inhibition of cytotoxic activity against paternal lymphocytes by monoclonal antibodies to HLA framework determinants indicated that all 11 sera contained lymphocytotoxic antibodies to paternal class I antigens. In addition, five sera contained lymphocytotoxic antibodies to paternal class II antigens. 3. In order to determine the extent to which lymphocytotoxic antibodies were directed to paternal antigens, the panel reactivity of sera was compared before and after absorption with paternal peripheral blood lymphocytes. Over 50% of panel reactivity was absorbed from eight out of 11 sera, and in three of these 11 over 80% was absorbed. In the majority of patients this change in panel reactivity could be ascribed to binding of lymphocytotoxic antibodies to specific paternal class I antigens. 4. Digestion of sera with dithiothreitol had no significant effect on panel reactivity, indicating that the lymphocytotoxic antibodies were of immunoglobulin G class. 5. No sera reacted with either autologous lymphocytes or K562 cells, indicating an absence of autoantibodies. 6. These studies imply that panel-reactive lymphocytotoxic antibodies in the sera of highly sensitized multiparous patients are those which mediate hyperacute renal allograft rejection. Their development may be related to secondary humoral responses to antigens in blood transfusions from donors who share paternal class I specificities.\r"

The change in external Na+ concentrations for all pH measurements was similar in both cell types. 2. A significant difference between the two types of cells was found, the polymorphonuclear leucocytes having a higher Na+/H+ antiport activity than the lymphocytes. Cellular intrinsic buffering capacity measured in the absence of HCO3- was also higher in the polymorphonuclear cells than in the lymphocytes. 3. These differences may be associated with a difference in the role of the Na+/H+ exchanger in these two types of cells, although in vivo the presence of HCO3-/Cl- exchangers may also contribute to intracellular pH homoeostasis.\r"

The illness may be indolent or fulminant, depending on the degree of colonic spillage and its containment. Most patients require hospitalization, and medical therapy suffices in about three fourths. Those who fail aggressive medical management and those with recurrent acute attacks, diffuse peritonitis, abscess, persistent obstruction, or fistulization require surgical intervention. Abdominal CT scanning has supplanted the contrast enema as the acute diagnostic procedure of choice and allows guided percutaneous drainage of large abscesses in selected cases. This approach helps realize the surgical ideal of a single elective operation without a temporary colostomy. For those patients still requiring emergency surgery, the two-stage approach employing resection of the diseased colon at the initial operation is far superior to the older three-stage approach.\r"

  ".W": "The arena of cellular immunotherapy is an emerging field of study. The field has strong foundations in numerous animal tumor models, which provide avenues of research for refinements in human immunotherapy. Experience from a number of research centers can be generalized: LAK cell trials in humans have demonstrated that PBMCs activated with IL-2 possess reproducible antitumor activity in vitro. Exogenous IL-2 administration to patients is required to maintain the biologic activity of the activated cells, although the requirement for LAK cells in tumors like melanoma is not clear-cut. Overall, the response rate to immunotherapy in humans is approximately 30%. The toxicity of immunotherapy, which is related to the dose of systemic IL-2, can be significantly reduced. The next generation of trials of cellular immunotherapy in humans will use TILs. Murine experiments indicate that this population of cells is more powerful and potentially more specific for tumor than LAK cells. Like LAK cells, TILs also require exogenous IL-2 for optimum performance in vivo. The difficulty in reproducible TIL growth can be overcome by the use of monoclonal antibody activation and IL-2. Improvements in TIL therapy are anticipated from the use of TILs combined with hybrid antibodies, the addition of other biologic response modifiers, and the implementation of genetically engineered cells and cell products.\r"

Dysphoric mood, vegetative symptoms, and negative perceptions of oneself, the environment, and the future are characteristic of depression. Often, the patient is unaware of the depression and presents with a variety of somatic complaints, chronic fatigue, or pain syndromes. In these instances, the physician must consider the diagnosis of depression and ask the patient about any history of depressive symptoms. In all depressed patients, a careful history and physical examination are needed to identify any drugs or concurrent medical illnesses which might cause or exacerbate the depression. If depression is suspected or if the patient presents after a suicide attempt, then a thorough evaluation of suicide potential is mandatory. Several risk factors for completed suicide exist. Male sex, age under 19 or over 45, few social supports, and a history of previous suicide attempts are all factors associated with increased suicide rates. Concurrent chronic or severe medical illnesses and certain psychiatric illnesses, notably depression, schizophrenia, and substance abuse, also increase an individual's risk for suicide. The method of suicide attempt and the chance for rescue must also be considered when determining risk as well as the presence of an organized plan. Acute psychosis in the suicidal patient is an ominous finding and these patients should be admitted to the hospital. The physician must adopt an empathetic and nonjudgmental attitude when caring for potentially suicidal patients. Disposition can be determined after careful evaluation of risk factors, circumstances surrounding the attempt, and the patient's current feelings. Consultation with a psychiatrist or another mental health professional is desirable for any potentially suicidal patient. Many such patients can be safely treated as outpatients with proper referral; certain high-risk individuals will need to be admitted to the hospital. The decision to either hospitalize or discharge can be difficult and the emergency physician should admit the patient if doubt exists.\r"

The emergency medicine physician's role in dealing with the acutely psychotic patient is to control the patient's behavior, to delineate the etiology of the psychosis, and to provide appropriate initial treatment and disposition. When making initial contact with the psychotic patient, behavioral control can be accomplished through supportive, physical, or pharmacologic interventions. Judicious use of rapid tranquilization permits rapid control of these patients when supportive and other nonpharmacologic therapies fail. Initial examination is directed at identifying immediate life-threatening organic disorders and promptly treating them. Historical data, mental status examination, physical examination, and appropriate radiologic and laboratory investigations give information that assist in delineating functional from organic psychosis. Most acute organic psychoses, with the exception of some drug intoxications that clear in the Emergency Department, require medical or surgical admission. Acute functional psychotic patients who are a danger to themselves or others, who are without a reliable social support system, or who present with their first psychotic episode require admission to the psychiatric service for further evaluation and treatment.\r"

The somatoform disorders include (1) somatization disorder (characterized by a chronic history of numerous and widely divergent somatic complaints), (2) psychogenic pain disorder (somatization expressed in terms of persistent pain), (3) hypochondriasis (a conviction that one is diseased and disabled in conjunction with a well-focused constellation of supporting symptoms), and (4) conversion disorder (a single, usually nonpainful neurologic symptom, often with identifiable coping value for the patient). The first three disorders have been aggregately termed the \"common somatization syndrome.\" Management of the somatically focused patient includes the communication of a caring attitude to the patient in conjunction with a cautious and diligent search for treatable medical or psychiatric illness. Resocialization and development of patient links with ongoing, nurturing nonmedical as well as medical support systems is of benefit.\r"

Establish rapid contact because anxious patients should not be left waiting. Expedite talking to reduce tension because putting thoughts and emotions into words invariably reduces initial tension. Make a quick first assessment of the anxious patient's general appearance, level of consciousness, level of tension, and leading affect or mood. Choose a private and relaxed setting for the interview if possible. Allow for a slow final evaluation because many initially overwhelmed anxious people may reconstitute within a matter of hours when allowed to talk, rest, or even sleep. Take the anxious patient's chief complaint seriously. A brief physical examination should be performed routinely in almost all cases, especially when there is a physical complaint. Every attempt should be made to rule out an organic etiology for the anxiety. Listening is an active but demanding process. Most of the time it means sitting down and giving all of one's attention to the patient, even if it is for just a few minutes. What patients find most comforting is the feeling of being understood. The emergency medicine physician should be careful to avoid a judgmental or punitive approach. Every attempt should be made to engage the family in caring for the patient while in the Emergency Department. It is equally important to recognize that relatives and friends may need assistance to help cope with the anxious patient once discharged. The emergency medicine physician needs to assess the degree of social support available in the patient's environment because a sensible disposition will depend on it.\r"

Without the benefit of establishing prior rapport with the family, the emergency physician must anticipate the family's grief response so that he or she can intervene to avoid an unnecessarily prolonged or morbid grief reaction. Factors predisposing to a pathologic grief response in the death of a spouse or of an infant or child must be recognized, and the physician's power to assuage survivor guilt should be used. Certain key actions in the process of notifying survivors, viewing the body, concluding the emergency department visit, and following up after the patient's death help facilitate survivor grief in the least traumatic way possible. Emergency Departments can improve their dealing with death by instituting a team approach using doctors, nurses, social workers, and clergy to better support family members in their emergency department experience and to provide a link with community service organizations helpful to the family after they leave the hospital.\r"

  ".W": "Each personality type presents with different methods of coping. Physicians should be aware of the impact on a patient's psychological functioning and ability to cope with illness and hospitalization, to understand and more effectively manage the patient. The physician must try to assess the patient's baseline personality from their past and present behavior. Establishing a good physician-patient relationship is important as a source of information about behavior of patients and how they will respond to their illness. Depending on the specific personality type, each patient will respond differently to the stress of illness. The effort of the emergency physician to identify personality types will aid in medical management of the patient and enable the physician to help each patient cope effectively with the illness and the hospitalization. The specific issues that seem to be threatening to traumatized patients include the following: helplessness, humiliation, blurring of body image, and gaps in memory filled with distortions. The traumatized patient experiences an altered state of consciousness which is either due to a physiologic cause or an emotional cause. Emotional causes are usually based on defensive dissociation. People who have been in an auto accident characteristically report loss of memory of the intense pain that the accident produces initially. Oftentimes, the core experience for the traumatic patient is not somatic, it is unconscious. The interesting feature is that so many patients do not remember the accident. The mind seems to be filled with all kinds of distortions and irrelevant and perhaps totally inconsistent fantasies, such as imprisonment, confinement, or deathlike experiences. Some report that they are being incarcerated, others recall being in a featureless cubicle with no contact with the normal world in which there are no windows, no pictures, no flowers. Others remember only being surrounded by masked, hatted, uniformed wardens who are standing over them with nasogastric tubes, intravenous lines, Foley catheters, arterial blood gases, subclavians, and dermal cut-downs. This is an overwhelming nightmare that can be relieved only by the empathic and caring physician and emergency department staff. The stress of medical illness and/or hospitalization can be overwhelming for some patients and is usually followed by some form of psychological response. Current understanding of the psychological impact of illness is based upon psychological defenses, coping mechanisms, and individual personality. It is the ability of the emergency physician to identify defenses, coping skills and personality types that will aid him or her in the medical management of the patients in their time of illness and hospitalization.\r"

It has long been recognized that mastery of a crisis can result in an enrichment of the personality, which then acquires resources to deal with similar events in the future. Failure to meet the challenge results not infrequently in a maladaptive response, which, too, is likely to be applied to similar challenges in the future--thereby burdening the personality with a handicap. Intervention in crisis aims at assisting the individual toward meeting his or her crisis successfully, and at times entails little more than guidance, advice, or education. When analyzed more adequately, intervention implies an evaluation of the resources within the individual, an evaluation of the resources among those who surround the individual in the family and the community, and an assessment of his or her past personal history. This takes into account how the individual has handled previous crises in his life; educational, vocational, marital, and social achievements; preferences; values; and what he or she expects from professional help. The individual is then invited, with those around him and involved with him, to examine the strengths that are available to him and to participate where possible in planning the steps immediately necessary for the successful resolution of the crisis.\r"

Similarly, there has been no comparative cost analysis of the utility of controlled ovarian hyperstimulation and IUI in the management of the same condition. Significant PRs in untreated couples with subfertility mandate the design and execution of controlled trials to ascertain the role of controlled ovarian hyperstimulation and IUI in infertility therapy. Various disorders of subfertility have been treated with controlled ovarian hyperstimulation and IUI. The rationale for this therapy is the increase in gamete density at the site of fertilization, as with GIFT and IVF when used for management of the same problems. The live birth rate per initiated cycle and risk of complications are similar to results recently reported for GIFT and IVF. The utility of controlled ovarian hyperstimulation and IUI still remains controversial. When the relatively low direct and indirect costs of controlled ovarian hyperstimulation and IUI are considered, acknowledging the lack of prospective, controlled studies, this procedure appears to be at least as cost-effective as GIFT and IVF.\r"

Deoxyribonucleic acid samples from controls and study subjects were examined with probes specific for the AR gene domains (hAR1, hAR2, hAR3). In one subject with complete androgen insensitivity syndrome, a reduction in size of the 2.4 kilobase band hybridizing to hAR1 was noted. Southern blot analysis of these subjects, however, did not detect deletions or gene rearrangement. These results suggest that deletions detectable by Southern method are infrequent mutants of the AR gene in patients with androgen insensitivity syndrome.\r"

In an attempt to distinguish between these causes of poor CM, we obtained progesterone (P) levels at the time of postcoital tests (PCTs) in infertile women during spontaneous or clomiphene citrate (CC)-stimulated cycles. The amount of CM, viscosity, ferning, spinnbarkeit, and cellularity were each scored from 0 to 3 points on the day after detection of the urinary luteinizing hormone surge (luteal day 1). The charts of 46 such patients were retrospectively reviewed. Eleven control patients with good CM scores (greater than 10) had low P levels (less than 2.5 ng/mL). Of the remaining 35 cycles, 19 were marked by low P levels, and 16 were accompanied by P levels of greater than 2.5 ng/mL. Overall, 94.4% of CC-stimulated cycles versus 64.3% of spontaneous cycles had abnormal CM scores (less than 9). On the basis of these inappropriately elevated P levels, premature luteinization can be cited as the cause of poor mucus quality. In fact, premature luteinization may be responsible for some of the purported antiestrogenic effects of CC. Therefore, it is appropriate to draw a P level at the time of a poor PCT, particularly in cycles stimulated by CC.\r"

The initial fall in P levels and the remaining level of P 3 hours after abortion were taken to represent the removal of P that originated from the trophoblast and the continuing P contribution by the corpus luteum (CL), respectively.

There was no significant correlation between any measure of maternal nutritional status and the duration of anovulation or amenorrhea. Neither the time of first supplement introduction to the baby nor the amount of supplement given was an accurate predictor of the return of ovulation or menstruation.

Hologic bone mineral density was 104.8 +/- 11.0 and Lunar bone mineral density was 103.4% +/- 7.8% of normal values for age. To conclude, in a population based cross-sectional study of patients with endometriosis, we do not observe low bone mineral density of the lumbar spine by techniques that measure a combination of cortical and trabecular bone.\r"

  ".W": "The progestin-induced withdrawal bleeding test has often been used in patients with amenorrhea to assess endogenous estrogen (E) production. The endometrial thickness measured by vaginal ultrasonography with a 5 MHz transducer is also dependent on E stimulation of the endometrium. In this study, 70 consecutive patients were evaluated with both the progestin-induced withdrawal bleeding test and a measurement of the endometrial thickness by vaginosonography. An endometrial thickness of 1.5 mm or less was selected to predict absence of bleeding after a progesterone (P) challenge test. This resulted in a sensitivity of 94% with a 95% confidence interval (CI) of 0.70 to 1.00 and a specificity of 93% with a 95% CI of 0.82 and 0.98. The positive and negative predictive values were 79% and 98%, respectively. This study shows that the endometrial thickness measured by vaginosonography can predict the results of the P challenge test in patients with amenorrhea.\r"

This paper reports an assessment of the outcome of this program. Neither pregnancy rates, nor any other measurable result of the program differed between patients managed in the satellites and those cared for at UNC Hospitals.\r"

Forty-nine had previously failed treatment with inseminated frozen donor sperm and 10 had unexplained infertility. All procedures were carried out under ultrasound direction on an outpatient basis without general anesthetic by the transabdominal or vaginal route. Eighteen (24%) procedures resulted in pregnancy. Of these patients, 16 have delivered live infants (1 set of triplets, 2 twins, and 13 singletons) and 2 miscarried. Peritoneal oocyte and sperm transfer offers an outpatient-based alternative to gamete intrafallopian transfer (GIFT) for in vivo conception. It can also be used in patients scheduled for intrauterine insemination where stimulation is excessive because the number of oocytes replaced can be limited.\r"

  ".W": "We have demonstrated that the polymerase chain reaction is a valid and sensitive technique for the detection of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) proviral deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) in human semen. The combination of extraction, polymerase chain reaction, and liquid hybridization techniques used in this study was sensitive to a level of detection of one HIV-1 infected cell in 100,000 (or 3 infected cells/test sample). In a series of matched peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and semen cells from 25 HIV-1 seropositive homosexual men, HIV-1 DNA was detected by polymerase chain reaction in 23 of 25 PBMC samples and 1 of 25 semen samples. By coculture on mitogen-activated peripheral blood leukocyte target cells, 19 of 24 PBMC and 4 of 24 semen samples were positive for infectious HIV-1. Of the four culture-positive semen samples, three were negative for the proviral form of the virus in the polymerase chain reaction assay. These data indicate that HIV-1 infected cells are not as prevalent in semen as in the peripheral blood. Furthermore, they indicate that the classical polymerase chain reaction approach, which only detects HIV-1 proviral DNA (infected cells), is not sufficient for clinical screening programs whose goal is the detection of HIV-1-infected semen samples. Accurate semen analysis by polymerase chain reaction may require enrichment of the infected cell population and/or a reverse transcriptase step to enable detection of the infectious ribonucleic acid form of the virus.\r"

The origin of these FcRIII antigens within the male reproductive tract was not known. By using polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies directed against different epitopes on FcRIII molecules, we demonstrated FcRIII reactivity in human prostate and seminal vesicle epithelial cells as well as in their glandular secretions. The FcRIII monoclonal antibody reactivity was removed by absorption with either seminal plasma or polymorphonuclear leukocytes that express FcRIII. Absorption of FcRIII monoclonal antibody with polymorphonuclear leukocytes also removed the reactivity with seminal plasma and vice versa. These data show for the first time that male accessory glands are a source of soluble FcRIII antigens.\r"

The treatment suppressed menstrual activity in all patients. Serum T and estrone were significantly elevated after treatment with oral T undecanoate. The parameters of the pulsatile secretion of LH were not affected by androgen administration. Levels of FSH, estradiol, and progesterone also did not change significantly.\r"

Both the proportion of motile sperm and the velocity distribution patterns were evaluated as function of time by multiple-exposure photography technique. At the various incubation periods considered, all FFs maintained or then enhanced sperm motility as compared with the paired control suspension incubated with a sperm survival medium. The results of the sperm contact test for FFs from women who achieved pregnancy versus FFs from women who remained infertile were not significantly different for both parameters measured. Comparing these with our previously reported results, we may hypothesize that FF released at ovulation into the peritoneal cavity may counteract some sperm-immobilizing effect of peritoneal fluid, thereby increasing the fertility potential of the male gametes.\r"
