The alternative technique of endoscopically placing similar-sized stents requires special instruments and skills, and may fail in passing very tight stenoses. We report a simpler combined percutaneous-endoscopic biliary stent (PEBS) placement technique with a high placement rate used in 11 patients with advanced malignant obstruction. In all 11 patients, 10 and 11.5 French stents were easily placed. Three patients developed sepsis but responded to antibiotics. One clogged stent required replacement. Two stents needed later endoscopic adjustment. Results of liver function test improved in 10 patients, and 8 patients showed improved quality of life.\r"

Certain biostatistical principles relevant to this analysis include the concepts of regression to the mean, the meaning of biochemical \"normality\" (particularly as it relates to multiple testing), and the effects of disease prevalence on the post-test probability of disease for individual test results. Applying these principles to a typical 12-test battery in asymptomatic adults, one would expect a low yield of unanticipated diagnoses and a high proportion of false-positive results. For the typical test battery, the empirical evidence supports these expectations in ambulatory care screening. In addition, routine preadmission use of biochemical profiles is not supported by studies examining their impact on patient care, hospital costs, or lengths of stay. Whereas components of these profiles can be endorsed for screening or preadmission testing, we recommend that the routine use of the entire profile be abandoned in these settings.\r"

The joints of the lower extremities were affected in 54 patients; the hip was the most commonly affected joint. There was little evidence of synovitis. Osteoporosis was diagnosed on the basis of characteristic clinical findings and the results of roentgenograms and bone scans. The osteoporosis resolved spontaneously over several months. Treatment consisted of joint protection, initiation of gradual ambulation, and administration of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents. Although its cause is unknown, osteoporosis appears to be a regional rather than a systemic process.\r"

Of the 50 articles, 17 satisfied three of the eight criteria; 32 satisfied four or five criteria; and 1 satisfied six criteria. Most reviews had clearly specified purposes (n = 40) and conclusions (n = 37). Only one had clearly specified methods of identifying, selecting, and validating included information. Qualitative synthesis was often used to integrate information included in the review (n = 43); quantitative synthesis was rarely used (n = 3). Future research directives were mentioned in 21. These results indicate that current medical reviews do not routinely use scientific methods to identify, assess, and synthesize information. The methods used in this systematic assessment of reviews are proposed to improve the quality of future review articles.\r"

Treatment with antibiotics and steroids gave relief. Use of unipolar electrocautery to excise the middle turbinate probably caused acute inflammation of the frontonasal duct. We recommend simple excision without electrocautery in those cases requiring removal of turbinate for successful lacrimal surgery.\r"

We followed five patients in two groups who combine these mechanisms. The first group presented with spontaneous alternation between nystagmus and a head turn with orthotropia (NCS), and a large-angle esotropia with a variable head position that persisted even when patched (NBS). The second group of patients presented with a constant large-angle esotropia that lessened their nystagmus and variable head posture (NBS). Following recession of both medial rectus muscles with or without placement of posterior fixation sutures, they developed an abnormal head posture with orthotropia (NCS). The presence of mild amblyopia may contribute to the alternation between the two compensatory mechanisms.\r"

Persistent poor wound healing can lead to death. A series of eight patients with advanced (grades III and IV, Chandler classification) radionecrosis of the larynx treated with adjunctive hyperbaric oxygen therapy is presented. Signs and symptoms of radionecrosis were dramatically ameliorated in seven of eight patients, while one patient, despite subjective improvement, eventually required laryngectomy. There were no deaths. These results are compared to previous series on radionecrosis of the larynx in which hyperbaric oxygen was not used. This series indicates that hyperbaric oxygen therapy is a useful and effective adjunctive treatment modality in the management of laryngeal radionecrosis.\r"

Forty-seven (90%) of the patients were followed for at least 18 months from the time diagnosis was made. Twenty-three (66%) of the patients followed for at least 18 months were successfully decannulated or had an adequate airway without tracheotomy. To compare efficacy of management of SGS at the CHNMC with management outcomes previously reported, a review of medical literature was undertaken and data from the most significant reports on management of SGS were collated and tabulated. Since analysis of published reports did not yield a consensus regarding optimal methods for management, and statistics in many published reports were absent or unclear, authors of the previously published reports were contacted personally by means of a letter and survey questionnaire. Results of the survey show that many authors have not performed a statistical review of their case data to determine relative efficacy of different surgical procedures. Thus, retrospective review of cases managed at the CHNMC as well as information obtained from leading experts in management of SGS indicate that there is no single optimal procedure or technique for management of all cases of SGS. Further, the way in which surgical procedures for management of SGS are being reported makes difficult the process of meaningfully comparing results reported by different surgeons. A reporting system is proposed that uses specific terms and objective parameters.\r"

One of the frontiers now being explored is neurogenic abnormalities within the pediatric larynx. At present, no uniform method of evaluation is being used other than observation of laryngeal motion. The use of electromyography in combination with still and motion photography should allow proper evaluation of the results of surgery or observation.\r"

The drawbacks of standard methods include inadequate airways, inadequate visualization, and operating room contamination from inspired gases. Since 1984, we have developed a technique utilizing jet ventilation delivered through a metal delivery system providing a relatively safe, ignition-free environment. A total intravenous anesthetic technique is used to avoid any environmental contamination. The newer short acting, high potency narcotic, sufentanil citrate, combined with a short acting muscle relaxant, atracurium besylate or vecuronium bromide, have made this technique an ideal one for our needs. The pulse oximeter provides an invaluable margin of safety. This technique has been employed in 36 microlaryngeal procedures performed on 21 patients with a uniformly smooth perioperative course and only one complication. The technique, possible pitfalls, and applications are discussed.\r"

This technique has two major advantages: 1) it provides rapid access to the airway during acute emergencies; and 2) it provides control of the airway where tissue distortion from head and neck trauma or tumor surgery makes standard anesthetic techniques difficult. Complications including catheter displacement, total expiratory obstruction, pneumothorax, and subcutaneous emphysema have been encountered. The authors conclude that percutaneous transtracheal jet ventilation is effective. However, potential problems exist and an in-depth understanding of the technique is necessary for its appropriate application and successful use.\r"

Conservative phoniatric therapy has been the primary modality of treatment for dysphonias resulting from ventricular fold hypertrophy, with surgical intervention being reserved for those patients not responding to speech therapy.

Twenty-three preterm infants had birth weight greater than or equal to 1,500 g (PT), and 18 of the preterm infants had gestational age less than or equal to 32 weeks and birth weight less than or equal to 1,500 g (PT-VLBW). Early complications (day 0 to 7) occurred in over 50% of the PT-VLBW compared to only 24% of the FT infants. Late complication rates were similar for all three groups. This higher early complication rate for PT-VLBW infants may be related to gestational age, low birth weight, and medical condition rather than surgical technique.\r"

The results suggest that removal of the arytenoid cartilage and asymmetrical removal of the false folds contribute to deglutition problems. We conclude that the standard supraglottic horizontal laryngectomy associated with surgical approximation of the larynx to the base of the tongue and cricopharyngeal myotomy does not usually cause serious deglutition problems. When the arytenoid cartilage is removed, reconstruction of the structure is required for the prevention of severe aspiration.\r"

Ten patients have undergone this procedure with good results. Epiglottoplasty represents an alternative to tracheotomy in severe laryngomalacia.

Memory impairment is a clinical hallmark of the dementing disorder, Alzheimer's disease. We have examined AVP concentrations in postmortem brain tissue from 12 patients with histologically confirmed Alzheimer's disease and 13 control subjects. AVP was measured by a highly specific and sensitive radioimmunoassay, validated by parallel inhibition curves and high-performance liquid chromatography. Alzheimer brains had either normal or slightly increased AVP levels in the neocortex, which does not have AVP cell bodies. Significant reductions in AVP content were found in the hippocampus, nucleus accumbens, and globus pallidus interna. Levels were normal in all other regions studied. Abnormalities of the brain vasopressin system may contribute to the memory deficit associated with Alzheimer's disease.\r"

The smooth disjunctive eye movements cycled with a frequency of 0.8 to 1.2 Hz. An analysis of peak velocities (15 to 200 degrees/sec) with respect to peak amplitudes (5 to 25 degrees) revealed dynamics characteristic of normal vergence movements. The pathological alterations resulting in pendular vergence oscillations implicate a separately functioning, physiologically normal vergence system within the brainstem. In addition to paralysis of vertical gaze, each patient also experienced progressive somnolence and intellectual deterioration. An intestinal biopsy in 1 patient established a diagnosis of Whipple's disease, which led to appropriate treatment and amelioration of the OMM. A pathological diagnosis of Whipple's disease of the central nervous system was made in the other 2 patients; results of an intestinal biopsy in one of these patients were normal. No patient had palatal myoclonus, and olivary pseudohypertrophy was not found in two autopsy examinations. Thus, OMM is a distinct movement disorder and has been recognized only in Whipple's disease. We conclude that patients with OMM should be treated presumptively for Whipple's disease of the central nervous system, even if a jejunal biopsy is normal.\r"

Myelograms were performed in 127 patients to diagnose the 75 with epidural disease. To try to reduce the number of myelograms needed, we attempted to design radiotherapy ports based on clinical symptoms and the plain spine films alone. A port could not be designed for 64 of the 127 patients, either because of diffuse vertebral metastases or a normal plain roentgenogram. A port could be designed for 63 patients, and all epidural disease would have been encompassed in 50 of the 54 patients who had spinal epidural metastases (93%). Most patients with cancer and back pain require myelography for accurate treatment planning. There are, however, situations in which treatment can be determined based on symptoms and plain films alone, with a low risk of missing epidural cancer.\r"

Structural and clinical features studied were lesion size, density, mass effect, location, tissue involvement, deep structure involvement, level of consciousness, and outcome. The data were analyzed using computer sorting and the chi 2 test. The field, amplitude, and frequency of focal slow-wave abnormalities generally failed to show a specific association with structural details. Continuous focal abnormalities correlated with large lesions (p less than 0.05), mass effect (p less than 0.05), and altered state of consciousness (p less than 0.05). Reactive focal abnormalities were associated with small lesions (p less than 0.05) and the absence of mass effect (p less than 0.02). Ipsilateral background activity abnormalities correlated with lesion size (p less than 0.001) and mass effect (p less than 0.01). Attenuation of ipsilateral background activity was more important than irregularity. Abnormal background activity contralateral to the lesion side was associated with alteration of consciousness (p less than 0.05).\r"

To examine the correlation between erythrocyte Zn levels and disease activity, we measured erythrocyte Zn levels longitudinally. Levels were dramatically decreased during a clinically documented exacerbation of MS. To determine the localization of increased Zn levels in MS erythrocytes, we employed standard techniques for the isolation of nonhemoglobin erythrocyte membrane ghosts. Patients with MS had three times more Zn in ghost material than did controls. Chloroform-methanol extraction in erythrocyte ghosts followed by determination of Zn levels indicated that most of the membrane-bound Zn was associated with the lipid-soluble fraction. Non-lipid-associated Zn and total membrane protein concentration were similar in MS and control samples. Results suggest that mechanisms which govern cellular availability, compartmentalization of Zn, or the binding of Zn to cell surface membranes may be altered in patients with MS, and that these mechanisms vary with disease activity.\r"

The Shoulson-Fahn functional capacity rating scale measures independence in such daily activities as eating, dressing, and managing personal finances, and is used to stage the illness and follow its progression. To determine which problems contribute most to reduced functional capacity as the disease evolves, we reviewed the records of 48 consecutive patients who were evaluated for intellectual and emotional status and motor disability. Each patient was staged and rated for functional capacity at the time of the examinations. Thirty-three of these patients were followed over several years with repeat evaluations at 6-month intervals. Intellectual impairment and depression correlated significantly with reduced functional capacity. However, when the somatic symptoms of depression were eliminated from the analysis, its relationship to functional capacity was no longer significant. Duration of illness, motor disability, and age at onset also had little impact. Neuropsychological test performance and functional capacity deteriorated over time. Our data suggest that intellectual impairment is a major factor in reducing functional capacity in the early stages of Huntington's disease.\r"

An initial severe reduction in junctional AChRs was reversed and the patient recovered, both within 8 months of stopping penicillamine.

Pentavalent antimony is the drug of choice for leishmaniasis chemotherapy; amphotericin B (AmB) is active but is rarely used, because of drug toxicity. AmB encapsulated within macrophage-directed carriers (liposomes) has been used to treat humans with systemic mycoses complicating neoplastic diseases; dosages of up to 5 mg of encapsulated AmB per kg per day for greater than 14 days are without apparent kidney or liver toxicity. In the present work, greater than 99% of L. donovani parasites were eliminated from the liver and spleen of infected hamsters by one administration of 1.5 to 11 mg of liposome-encapsulated AmB (L-Amb) per kg. A total of 98 to 99% of hepatosplenic parasites were eliminated from squirrel monkeys by three administrations of 4 mg of L-AmB per kg. L-AmB was 170 to 750 times as active as antimony in hamsters, and approximately 60 times as active as antimony in monkeys. The demonstration that apparently nontoxic human dosages of L-AmB eliminate essentially all hepatosplenic parasites in hamster and primate models suggests that this preparation should be considered for clinical trial against kala-azar.\r"

Because cefoperazone has a dual excretory pattern, primarily via the biliary system and secondarily via the kidney, pregnancy-induced physiologic alterations can influence its deposition and clearance. Twelve term parturients receiving cefoperazone prophylaxis after cesarean section were selected for study. After 2 g of cefoperazone was administered for 1 h intravenously, serial blood samples were assayed by high-pressure liquid chromatography. Plasma protein binding of cefoperazone was studied in vitro. The mean peak cefoperazone concentration +/- standard deviation was 169.9 +/- 60.4 micrograms/ml. The mean half-life was 152 min. Total serum clearance was 80.8 +/- 30.8 ml/min. The steady-state volume of distribution was 14.2 +/- 6.0 liters. All subjects had detectable trough levels at the end of the dosage interval, with a mean value of 6.5 +/- 5.2 micrograms/ml. Protein binding of cefoperazone for parturients was 74.3 +/- 10.9%, compared with 87.7 +/- 3.2% in nonpregnant controls (P less than 0.05). These data suggest that cefoperazone deposition can be greatly influenced by pregnancy. However, unlike several other new antimicrobial agents whose excretions are mainly renal, the cefoperazone half-life and thus trough concentration for the parturient more closely resemble that for the nonpregnant subject.\r"

Incremental decreases in ribavirin concentration made while maintaining the 2-h intermittent schedule provided progressively less protection of mice. Mice exposed to the 60-mg/ml doses had significantly increased pulmonary and serum drug levels when compared with mice given 20 mg of drug per ml, these increases were transient, and no evidence of pulmonary intolerance was detected. These studies suggest that protective effects of ribavirin against influenza virus infection can be achieved without untoward effects if higher doses and shorter periods of administration are used.\r"

Exposure to plants of the Compositae family, tanning history, and chronic sun exposure were also investigated, as were smoking history, drug ingestion history, and other skin disease. Personal and family histories of other malignancies were also investigated. The only statistically significant difference to emerge was that the patients with mycosis fungoides had significantly more family history of atopic dermatitis. In view of the absence of any significant difference between patients and controls with regard to personal history of atopic dermatitis, this difference may be the result of multiple statistical testing rather than a phenomenon of true biological significance.\r"

The total number of cells increased in the papillary dermis of grade 1 and 2 skin of scleroderma and decreased in the grade 3 skin of scleroderma. In morphea a reduced number of mast cells was noted in grade 3 lesions. It is suggested that mast cells play an important role in fibrotic process of scleroderma skin.\r"

  ".W": "The relationship in women between mild hirsutism or acne to androgen levels has not been well-defined. We investigated this in 62 Caucasian women, aged 18 to 21 years, by relating these pilosebaceous signs to plasma free testosterone (fT), the main circulating determinant of plasma androgenicity. Women with mild hirsutism (n = 13) had a significantly elevated fT (12.7 +/- 5.5, SD, pg/mL [44.1 +/- 19.1 pmol/L]) compared to normal controls (7.4 +/- 2.7 pg/mL [25.7 +/- 9.4 pmol/L]), as did subjects with minor acne (10.7 +/- 4.25 pg/mL [37.1 +/- 14.7 pmol/L]). The most important finding was the striking variability in the relationship between pilosebaceous overactivity and fT levels. In mildly hirsute subjects plasma fT was normal in half of the subjects, and the coefficient of variation of plasma fT was about twice what one would expect from individual variability. We could not demonstrate correlations among the variables of hirsutism, acne, and plasma fT. On the other hand, among 15 women with modest elevations of plasma fT levels (up to twofold), 27% had moderate hirsutism, 40% had mild hirsutism, and 33% had none. However, four of five of the latter patients (without hirsutism) had acne. The relationship of fT to acne severity varied similarly. To define the interactions between androgens and the pilosebaceous apparatus, we propose a model in which variation in apparent skin sensitivity and the level of androgen seem to contribute about equally to the pathogenesis of mild hirsutism and acne. The clinician should suspect that hyperandrogenemia will be found in about half the women with mild cases of hirsutism, and one third with minor acne.\r"

Of 35 patients undergoing surgery on eroded, but not clinically infected, cutaneous tumors, one developed a transient bacteremia, whereas none of 15 patients developed bacteremia during surgery on cutaneous neoplasms with intact skin surfaces. The low incidence of bacteremia associated with surgery on eroded skin neoplasms suggests that, for this commonly performed surgery, prophylactic antibiotics be administered perioperatively only to patients with prosthetic heart valves and not to other patients at risk for endocarditis. This recommendation would be in keeping with the American Heart Association guidelines for prophylaxis for other surgical procedures associated with low incidences of transient bacteremia.\r"

Three of the melanomas on the oral mucosa occurred on the lip and the other two on the gingiva. A striking prevalence of melanomas was observed in women, the male-to-female ratio being 0.08. Histologic examination revealed that 58% of the melanomas were characterized by lentiginous, 23% by nodular, and 15% by superficial spreading proliferation. Most of the melanomas were Clark's level IV or V at the time of diagnosis. Except for three who have been under observation for a short time, all the patients have died. There appear to be some clinical and histologic similarities between mucosal melanoma and melanoma of the volar skin, but the difference in biological behavior warrants that the two be classified separately.\r"

The angiogenesis-enhancing effect was most marked in the serum samples from patients with plaquelike and peripherally spreading lesions lasting for one to two months, and tended to disappear in patients with long-lasting and/or stationary lesions. Serum samples from patients with psoriasis were also capable of modulating the proliferation of normal human endothelial cells in vitro, and this modulation was correlated with the duration of relapse. The effects of psoriatic sera on normal human MNC function and on endothelial cell growth may be of importance for vascular proliferation in psoriasis.\r"

Fibroblast cultures from the affected and unaffected skin were studied for collagen metabolism. Procollagen synthesis was elevated about sixfold on fibroblasts derived from the affected skin. A similar increase was detected in messenger RNA (mRNA) levels using a complementary DNA clone specific for human pro alpha 1(l) collagen mRNA. The elevated mRNA level could be the result of increased transcriptional activity of collagen genes or decreased degradation of collagen mRNAs. Our findings suggest that increased collagen deposition may account for the marked dermal fibrosis that we observed in this patient.\r"

Therefore, the goal of surgical therapy must be to eradicate both the clinically apparent tumor and its microscopic extension into the surrounding normal-appearing skin. This entails excising the tumor along with a margin of clinically normal skin. Unfortunately, there is no agreement as to the optimal width of surgical margins. We therefore studied 117 cases of previously untreated, well-demarcated basal cell carcinoma. Prior to excision, the normal-appearing skin surrounding the tumor was marked in 2-mm increments. The tumor was then excised using Mohs micrographic surgery. The extent of the subclinical tumor invasion was calculated from the presurgical skin markings. For tumors with a diameter less than 2 cm, a minimum margin of 4 mm was necessary to totally eradicate the tumor in more than 95% of cases.\r"

A case of a 22-year-old woman with a severe ulcerative process predominantly affecting the head and neck is described. A review of the literature indicates that malignant pyoderma and pyoderma gangrenosum are almost certainly identical disorders.\r"

Common histologic features included extensive, dense hyaline fibrosis and perineural invasion. Because of the extensive soft-tissue and osseous involvement, all patients required composite resection of the orbit, the ethmoidal sinus, the orbital contents, and the soft tissue of the eyelids, brow, and temporal region. This required an intracranial approach utilizing a frontal craniotomy and distant flap coverage of the resultant defect. Emphasis is placed on the early, aggressive, and complete surgical resection of such lesions, before orbital invasion has occurred, so subsequent mutilating surgery may be avoided.\r"

Healthy mothers (n = 49) delivering in January received daily either 2000 IU (group 1), 1000 IU (group 2), or no (group 3) vitamin D. Their infants were exclusively breast fed, and those in group 3 received 400 IU of vitamin D a day. After eight weeks of lactation the infantile vitamin D concentrations were similar in groups 1 and 3 but significantly lower in group 2. The serum 24,25-dihydroxyvitamin D and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D concentrations were also lower in group 2. The mean mineral, parathyroid hormone, and alkaline phosphatase values showed no intergroup differences at any point. No infants showed any clinical or biochemical signs of rickets, and their growth was equal. In conclusion, a daily postpartum maternal supplementation with 2000 IU of vitamin D, but not with 1000 IU, seems to normalise the vitamin D metabolites of breast fed infants in winter. Maternal safety with such supplementation over prolonged periods, however, should be examined.\r"

Verbal IQ was, however, significantly higher than performance IQ, which had an inverse relation with age at diagnosis. Furthermore, scores for deviant behaviour were found to correlate with age at diagnosis. Thus the characteristic psychological profile of this syndrome may be in part a function of hypercalcaemia during infancy.\r"

Patients were classified according to the level of respiratory resistance by reference to a population of 36 babies studied over the first two days of life before airway secretions had become apparent. There was a highly significant fall in both the resistance and time constant measurements after tracheobronchial suction or lavage for infants whose pretreatment values of resistance were greater than the reference mean. When tracheobronchial toilet was effective in removing secretions the changes in resistance and time constant values were again significant. No changes in compliance values were noted. Severe but clinically inapparent mucous obstruction of the airways was revealed in two infants by a progressively rising respiratory system resistance during continuous monitoring. The need for and efficacy of tracheobronchial suction and lavage could be determined by such techniques for monitoring the resistance of the respiratory system during mechanical ventilation.\r"

  ".W": "Plasma electrolyte, intermediary metabolite, and hormone concentrations were measured in samples of 110 units of citrate phosphate dextrose blood being used for clinical transfusions. The most important changes from the physiological range were in sodium, potassium, glucose, and lactate concentrations. Mean sodium concentrations fell from 170 mmol/l at the beginning of storage to 156 mmol/l at the end and mean potassium concentrations rose from 7 mmol/l to 25 mmol/l. Glucose had a mean concentration of 20 mmol/l at the beginning of storage and had only fallen to 15 mmol/l at the end. Mean lactate concentrations increased from 7 mmol/l at the beginning of storage to 25 mmol/l at the end. Many samples had cortisol, insulin, and growth hormone concentrations within the physiological range. Citrate phosphate dextrose blood contains a large substrate load that changes during storage and that should be taken into account when infants are transfused large volumes of blood. The strong correlation coefficients with duration of storage for sodium, potassium, and lactate (-0.71, 0.91, and 0.90, respectively) indicate that concentrations of these substrates can be predicted within a narrow range if the duration of blood storage is known.\r"

Ninety per cent of the mothers boiled water to prepare a powdered milk formula, but only 15% boiled water for drinking. Thirty nine infants (19%) were admitted more than once. Better family state in terms of socioeconomic class, maternal education, and breast feeding gave some protection against re-admission, though this was not significant. It seems that the condition of drinking water is an important cause of diarrhoea and hence of re-admission. The number of re-admissions was twice as high among infants drinking unboiled (unfiltered or mineral) water than among those drinking boiled or unboiled but filtered water. Breast feeding is protective if no extra water is given.\r"

The neonatal cancers included neuroblastoma (47%), retinoblastoma (17%), soft tissue sarcoma (12%), central nervous system tumours (9%), leukaemia (8%), and a few cases of Wilms' tumour, liver tumour, and miscellaneous tumours. The overall mortality from disease was 41%. Patients with retinoblastoma, Wilms' tumour, and neuroblastoma had the best prognosis. Forty three patients (42%) survived their neonatal cancers; all were treated with surgery or radiochemotherapy, or both, but none suffered long term major handicaps as a result of treatment. There was one instance of second malignancy of the thyroid gland induced by radiation. We conclude that although neonatal cancers are difficult management problems, many patients can be cured. Physicians should discuss with parents the possible risks associated with treatment before treatment is begun.\r"

Among the 803 babies born at or before 34 weeks' gestation, 28% were delivered electively for fetal problems; they were considerably lighter than babies born after spontaneous preterm labour. In contrast, they showed only a small deficit in head circumference, possibly due to a brain sparing effect in growth retarded infants. Electively delivered preterm infants cause a bias in birthweight and head circumference centiles and we recommend that these babies should be excluded when these centiles are calculated.\r"

A retrospective study was performed over a 12 year period to assess the incidence, aetiology, mode of presentation, disease, and management of scrotal swellings in boys under 5. Although most of the causes of these swellings were easily elucidated from a history and clinical examination, it was apparent that a high level of suspicion was also necessary to ensure that more serious problems did not go undetected.\r"

Results of GH are expressed as mean (SEM). The pre-exercise GH was similar in the three groups (group 1, 8.0 (2.3) mU/l, group 2, 8.5 (2.5) mU/l, and group 3, 8.3 (2.3) mU/l). There was a significant rise in GH after exercise in all three groups. GH after exercise was higher in group 2 (35.1 (2.5) mU/l) compared with groups 1 and 3 (17.8 (3.0) and (20.8 (3.2) mU/l). Post-exercise GH was less than 10 mU/l in 29 children (34% total; 49% group 1, 6% group 2, and 34% group 3). There was a positive relation between post-exercise GH and both bone age and public hair stage. Multiple regression analysis revealed that relevant predictors of a rise in GH with exercise were different for the sexes in these children with varying stature: for boys, bone age and pubic hair stage; for girls, height and height SDS. All the tall girls were in puberty.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Both sexes were tall at onset, whereas at the last observation boys alone showed significant growth retardation. Height standard deviation score (SDS), however, showed no significant fall either in 32 subjects reassessed after five years of disease or in 18 subjects examined at full stature. Skeletal maturity was not significantly impaired after treatment. Pubertal growth spurt was reduced, especially in girls and in subjects with onset of disease at or around puberty. We found no significant correlation between height and height velocity SDS and glycosylated haemoglobin values or secretion of growth hormone during the arginine test. Somatomedin C values were correlated with height velocity SDS in prepubertal boys. The results of this study suggest that there are interferences in the growth of children with diabetes but that they do not seem to have a significant influence on adult height.\r"

History of asthma was found in 2252 boys and 1158 girls, who were then categorised according to three grades of severity. Analysis of their growth was made separately for each sex and for each grade of severity of clinical disease. Boys who suffered from mild asthma that subsided before adolescence were significantly taller, heavier, and fatter than their respective controls. There was a slight decrement in all three growth variables in correlation with increased severity. The most severely affected patients had retarded height and weight in comparison with the mildly affected children, but the differences were not significant. The same tendency was found in the girls. Children with asthma will ultimately reach normal height and weight. Those who are mildly affected tend to be even taller and heavier than adolescents without asthma. The severity of the asthma influences final growth.\r"

As offspring of deletion carriers have a 50% risk of inheriting the predisposition locus it is important to identify deletion carriers. The site of the esterase D gene to the often deleted region offers an objective means of deletion identification. The chromosomes of a patient with unilateral retinoblastoma, previously supposed to have a normal karyotype, were reexamined after the discovery that his red blood cells contained reduced activities of esterase D. A small sub-band deletion was found in chromosome region 13q14. These findings emphasise the importance of measurements of esterase D in all patients with retinoblastoma, even those with an apparently normal karyotype.\r"

Eighty-nine patients were divided into three treatment groups: Group I, curative resection (29 patients); Group II, palliative resection (13 patients) and bypasses (8 patients); and Group III, operative intubation (39 patients). Two patients died before operation and six patients were treated without operation by percutaneous biliary decompression. High morbidity rate (53.8%) and mortality rate (69.2%) were encountered in 13 patients who had hepatic resection. Survival rates of the three treatment groups were comparable. For the 64 patients closely monitored after discharge, quality of survival was assessed according to six parameters: frequency of hospitalization for cholangitis; catheter-related problems; the percentage of days hospitalized; duration of jaundice; antibiotic requirements; and analgesic needs. Group I patients had the best qualitative survival, whereas Group II patients had the worst result when compared with either Group I (p less than 0.001) or Group III (p less than 0.005). Curative resection is recommended when it can be done without a concomitant hepatic resection. When noncurable disease is found on examination, operative intubation after dilatation is the preferred palliative measure.\r"

Patients ranged in age from 21-73 years (mean: 51 years) and all had prolonged, complex hospitalizations extending 25-122 days (mean: 63 days). The only complication associated with the procedure was the identification of transhepatic placement of the catheter, which caused no adverse effects. Two of the nine patients died during hospitalization of causes unrelated to the gastrostomy construction. The goals of gastric decompression and elimination of nasogastric intubation were achieved in all patients. In one patient with gastric intestinal disconnection, the percutaneous gastrostomy was effective as the sole means for elimination of swallowed saliva and gastric output. Three patients continued to use the gastrostomies for chronic decompression after discharge for the remainder of their lives (2 months, 6 months, and 2 years, respectively). Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy may provide a safe, secure, and comfortable method of long-term gastric decompression in a select group of high-risk patients with complex intra-abdominal processes.\r"

Sixty-seven per cent of patients with gallstone pancreatitis had a common channel present on intraoperative cholangiography versus 32% of patients with cholelithiasis or choledocholithiasis without pancreatitis (p less than 0.005). Common channel length was greater than the diameter of the smallest stone in nine of 27 patients with gallstone pancreatitis and in 13 of 109 patients with cholelithiasis or choledocholithiasis without pancreatitis (p less than 0.025). In conclusion, common channels are more frequent in patients with gallstone pancreatitis than in patients with other biliary tract disease. Furthermore, gallstone pancreatitis is associated with stones that are smaller than the common channel, which favors obstruction of both pancreatic and bile ducts while allowing reflux of contents between them.\r"

Three hundred and forty-five patients (53%) had symptoms of an acute abdomen on admission and were operated on immediately. The remaining 306 patients (47%) were managed conservatively with serial clinical examinations. This group included 26 patients with omental or intestinal evisceration, 18 patients with air under the diaphragm, 12 patients with blood found on abdominal paracentesis, and 18 patients with shock on admission. Only 11 patients (3.6%) needed subsequent operation, and there was no mortality. The overall incidence of unnecessary laparotomies was 5% (completely negative, 3%). Of the 467 patients with proven peritoneal penetration, 27.6% had no significant intra-abdominal injury. It is concluded that many abdominal stab wounds can safely be managed without operation. The decision to operate or observe can be made exclusively on clinical criteria. Peritoneal penetration, air under the diaphragm, evisceration of omentum or bowel, blood found on abdominal paracentesis, and shock on admission are not absolute indications for surgery. Alcohol consumption by the patient does not interfere with the clinical assessment.\r"

Portal blood flow was measured by an ultrasonic Doppler duplex system, and portal venous pressure was measured by portal catheterization before, during, and after operation. The portal blood flow, and especially the splenic venous blood flow, was less during operation than before operation. Blood flow through the IMCS was greater than that through the DSRS, and the shunt flow had a tendency to increase after operation. The portal venous pressure measured during operation was slightly higher than that measured percutaneously before operation. In the patients who had the shunt operation, the portal venous pressure tended to decrease after operation. Study of portal hemodynamics, especially with the ultrasonic Doppler method, is useful in analysis and follow-up of patients who have shunt operations since the same method can be used before, during, and after operation.\r"

Lesions of the aortic arch were the most common (29 patients, 69 lesions) and frequently were associated with lesions in another site as well. However, in this group of patients, the infrequent presence of signs of cerebral vascular insufficiency limited the number of suitable surgical candidates to 14 patients. Lesions of the renal arteries were noted in 25 patients (37 lesions) and were associated with coarctation of the thoracoabdominal aorta in 12 patients. In contrast to lesions of the aortic arch, the presence of severe hypertension was a frequent indication for surgery in Takayasu's disease. Twenty-one patients had operation. Twenty of 21 patients were considered cured or improved of hypertension. The one patient who received no benefit was the only operative death of the study. In conclusion, although Takayasu's disease is progressive and the life expectancy is foreshortened, hypertension secondary to aortic and renal artery lesions is a frequent and important indication for aggressive operative treatment.\r"

In addition, the compliance characteristics in a series of human INS vein grafts were recorded as a function of time after operation. At 6 months after implantation, all experimental grafts displayed well-developed intimal hyperplasia. There was no significant difference in either absolute intimal thickness (INS 0.133 +/- 0.09 mm vs. RV 0.085 +/- 0.06 mm; NS) nor in the percentage of the total wall thickness occupied by the intima when experimental INS grafts were compared with RV grafts after 6 months. Similarly, compliance values of INS and RV vein grafts were similar at all time intervals examined up to 6 months after operation. Thirty-three human INS vein grafts had a mean compliance value of 1.74 +/- 0.72 (percent radial changes per mmHg X 10(-2) at a median postoperative interval of 14 weeks. This value did not differ significantly from those measured in the INS vein grafts. Although all vein grafts examined retained their native viscoelastic properties, this study suggests that functioning human INS vein grafts are less compliant than previously suspected on the basis of prior ex-vivo and clinical studies of RV saphenous vein grafts. The purported clinical superiority of the INS vein graft cannot be explained on the basis of superior biomechanical performance or failure to develop intimal hyperplasia.\r"

With local warming of the arm skin to 34 C, the bleeding time was 2.4 minutes. In normothermic baboons with arm skin temperature of 34.6 C, the bleeding time was 3.1 minutes. Local cooling of the arm skin to 27.6 C produced a bleeding time of 6.9 minutes. Increasing the skin temperature of the arm in hypothermic baboons to 38.9 C and in normothermic baboons to 40.1 C reduced bleeding times to 2.1 and 2.3 minutes, respectively. In both hypothermic and normothermic baboons there was a negative and significant correlation between the bleeding time and the arm skin temperature and the thromboxane B2 level in the shed blood obtained at the template bleeding time site. There was a significant positive correlation between the thromboxane B2 level in the shed blood and the arm skin temperature. Both in-vivo and in-vitro studies have shown that the production of thromboxane B2 by platelets is temperature-dependent, and that a cooling of skin temperature produces a reversible platelet dysfunction. Data also suggest that when a hypothermic patient bleeds without surgical cause, skin and wound temperature should be restored to normal before the administration of blood products that are not only expensive but may also transmit disease.\r"

  ".W": "From July 1982 to June 1985, 100 patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the thoracic esophagus had esophageal resection and reconstruction using an abdominal and right thoracotomy approach (Lewis-Tanner operation). Five patients died within 30 days. The remaining 95 patients were studied prospectively for evidence of local recurrences. It was found that anastomotic recurrences occurred in eight patients, and mediastinal recurrences involving the intrathoracic stomach occurred in seven patients over a mean follow-up period of 13 months. The total local recurrence rate was 16% (15 of 95 patients). The incidence of anastomotic recurrence was shown to be related only to the length of the proximal resection margin and not related to tumor differentiation or lymph node metastases. A proximal resection margin of less than 5 cm measured at operation had a 20% risk of developing an anastomotic recurrence, and a margin of between 5 to 10 cm had an 8% risk. Mediastinal recurrences that encroached on the intrathoracic stomach were found to be related more to the extent of lateral spread of the primary tumor in the mediastinum than to the length of the resection margins. Postoperative radiotherapy in patients with palliative resections decreased the incidence of local recurrences. To reduce the incidence and consequences of local recurrence after esophagectomy, it is suggested that in patients with tumors in the upper thorax, a more complete esophagectomy is warranted, postoperative radiotherapy should be given to patients with short resection margins, and in patients with extensive mediastinal spread, use of the retrosternal route for reconstruction is preferred.\r"

This study directly tests that vasodilating PG protect against the consequences of renal ischemia. Anesthetized, 500-g rats had right nephrectomy and 45 minutes of left renal pedicle clamping or sham clamping. The rats were treated with intravenous (I.V.) saline 1.9 mL/h starting 40 minutes after clamping or sham clamping. All rats except the sham group (N = 8) were pretreated 1 hour before ischemia with ibuprofen (12 mg/kg) to prevent prostanoid synthesis. Beginning 5 minutes before clamp release, the rats were treated intravenously for 2 hours with: saline vehicle (N = 9), PGE1 400 ng/kg/min (N = 6), nitroprusside 4 micrograms/kg/min (N = 8), or dopamine 3 micrograms/kg/min (N = 11). After 24 hours, sham rat creatinine level was 0.5 mg/dL and weight of the left kidney was 86.5% of the previously removed right kidney. Compared with sham rats, ischemia and saline treatment resulted in a rise in creatinine level to 2.7 mg/dL (p less than 0.05) and a rise in kidney weight to 101.9% (p less than 0.05); PGE1 led to a creatinine level of 1.1 mg/dL, a value lower than that of the rats treated with saline (p less than 0.05), and a kidney weight of 92.0%, a value similar to that of sham rats; nitroprusside and dopamine led to a rise in creatinine levels to 3.2 mg/dL (p less than 0.05) and 2.3 mg/dL (p less than 0.05), respectively, as well as a rise in kidney weight to 108.0% (p less than 0.05) and 105.4% (p less than 0.05), respectively. Histologic examination showed ATN in rats treated with saline, nitroprusside, and dopamine, but not in rats treated with PGE1. These results indicate that PGE1 protects the cyclo-oxygenase-treated kidney against ischemia-induced ATN.\r"

Knowledge of Level 1 (entry) residents is then compared with Level 5 (exit) residents. Each ABSITE question can thus be categorized on entry versus exit as known-known, unknown-unknown, unknown-known, and known-unknown. Only about half of unknown knowledge on entry appears to become known on exit. Very little knowledge known on entry becomes unknown on exit. Weaknesses in specific subject areas can be readily identified by ranking questions according to the number of exiting residents who answer incorrectly. Use of this technique to quantitate cognitive learning in a residency program may allow objective assessment of changes in curriculum.\r"

Cryoablation was successful in abolishing tachycardia in 93.7% (15 of 16). Six patients (100%) with permanent junctional reciprocating tachycardia were cured by cryoablation. Eighteen of 19 patients with atrial ectopic tachycardia were treated by cryoablation alone or in combination with excision of the atrial appendage, with success in 15 (83.3%). Five of these were left atrial foci cured by cryoablation. Fourteen right atrial foci were treated by excision of the appendage only (1 patient), excision of the appendage and local cryoablation (8 patients), and cryoablation alone (5 patients). Three of these underwent partial (2 patients) or complete (1 patient) atrial disconnection after excisional and cryoablative techniques failed to control the tachycardia. Multiple ectopic atrial foci were common (9 patients), and successful cryoablation was accomplished in 100% of the patients with a single atrial ectopic focus (10 patients) but in only 66% of those with multiple foci. Thirteen of 19 infants with critical ventricular tachycardia were treated by cryoablation at the site of the ectopic focus, either alone or in combination with excision of the area. Elimination of tachycardia was accomplished in 13 patients (100%). Myocardial hamartoma (Purkinje cell tumor) was the histological diagnosis in 11 of the infants with ventricular tachycardia.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The non-drug-addicted patients (33%) were elderly and debilitated with advanced illness that preceded the endocarditis. The drug-addicted patients (67%) were young and were infected with multiple kinds of microorganisms. The blood cultures grew strains of Staphylococcus aureus resistant to methicillin sodium and nafcillin sodium in a majority of patients. Gram-negative microorganisms and fungi were cultured almost exclusively from samples from the drug-addicted patients. The high mortality among the non-drug-addicted patients (28%) was related to their advanced age and debilitating illness. The high mortality among the drug-addicted patients (21%) was related to the complex bacteriology of their infections and the severe anatomical disruption of the valvular complexes of the heart. When cured of their disease after treatment with intravenously administered antibiotics or a valve procedure or both, their long-term survival was related to whether or not they abstained from their habit. If the patient abstained from the use of drugs, the chances of survival were good; if not, death invariably ensued. This experience strongly supports our contention that if a patient returns to the use of drugs and reinfects the valve after initial cure, a second valve operation is contraindicated.\r"

Only 3 of the injuries resulted from blunt trauma, and 1 of these patients had a total transection of both the trachea and esophagus; the remaining injuries were due to penetrating trauma (20 gunshot wounds; 1 stab wound). The combined lesions involved the cervical region in 20 patients and the thoracic esophagus and trachea or bronchus in 4. All patients underwent bronchoscopy; in recent years all have had esophagoscopy, because our experience indicates that esophagrams, which patients also underwent, have a high rate (12.5%) of false negative results. Operative techniques included a two-layer closure of all esophageal injuries, closure of the trachea with non-absorbable monofilament suture, and transthoracic or cervical drainage. Muscle flaps were used for suture line reinforcement. Associated operative procedures included tracheostomy (5), laparotomy (4), vascular procedures (5), neurologic procedures (2), and closed-tube thoracostomy (6). Five patients (21%) died in the perioperative period, 4 of 20 with combined cervical injuries, and 1 of the 4 with combined thoracic injuries. Deaths resulted from missed injuries to the esophagus (2 patients), a missed tracheal injury (1), associated vascular injury (1), and associated thoracoabdominal injury (1). Two patients experienced cervical esophageal suture line leaks, both of which sealed with conservative therapy. Clinical follow-up showed good results in 90% of the patients who survived.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Forty-three patients had been treated with surgical techniques, chemotherapy, or radiotherapy, or all three, while 27 patients were untreated before laser therapy because of acute respiratory distress. Laser treatment produced palliative improvement in 81% of the treated group (35 of 43), with survival of 4.3 +/- 3.9 months. Unsuccessfully laser-treated patients survived 0.7 +/- 0.4 month (p less than .05). Eighty-five percent of the untreated patients (23 of 27) showed postlaser improvement, with survival of 8.5 +/- 6.9 months. Unsuccessfully laser-treated patients survived 1.4 +/- 0.6 months (p less than .05). Twenty-three of the 27 previously untreated patients underwent radiation therapy after laser treatment. Laser treatments also were administered to 23 patients aged 61 +/- 13 years with complete obstruction of the main bronchi. Of this group, 17 patients had been treated and 6 had not been treated before the laser therapy.

We compared the effects of various concentrations of CC in a cardioplegic solution on the survival and hemodynamic and metabolic recovery of 23 isolated, working rat hearts subjected to 60 minutes of hypothermic (23 degrees C) ischemic arrest. Group 1 (N = 6) consisted of hearts infused with the basic cardioplegic solution (Tyers' solution with glucose), to which no CC was added. In group 2 (N = 6) CC was added at 0.1 ml/L to the cardioplegic solution. In group 3 (N = 5) CC was added at 1 ml/L, and in group 4 (N = 6) CC was added at 10 ml/L. The cardioplegic infusions were performed at a pressure of 40 mm Hg for 2 minutes just before arrest; 30 minutes later they were performed again for 1 minute. Only two hearts (33.3%) recovered in group 1 whereas five recovered in group 2, five (100%) in group 3, and five (83.3%) in group 4. The recovery of hemodynamic performance as a percentage of preischemic control values showed marked improvement in the CC groups, especially group 3, when compared with group 1. The metabolic variables in the CC groups were also markedly improved, with significantly (p less than .05) decreased levels of tissue lactate and increased levels of creatine phosphate compared with those in group 1.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The linearized incidences of reoperations for thrombotic obstructions were 0.33 +/- 0.08% for mitral valve replacement, 0.36 +/- 0.1% for aortic valve replacement, and 0.42 +/- 0.1% for double valve replacement (p = not significant). Forty-one patients (16 mitral, 12 aortic, and 13 double valve replacements) underwent a total of 44 reoperations with a mean interval of 36 +/- 29 months (range, 0.25-85 months) between operations. Diagnosis was established invasively only in 13 patients (30%). Hospital mortality at reoperation was 18% (8 patients); 28 patients (63%) required emergency surgery. The choice surgical procedures were thrombectomy for clotted aortic prostheses (18 of 24) and valve replacement for obstructed mitral valves (22 of 25; p less than .001). Rethrombosis occurred in 3 patients (1 aortic and 2 double valve replacements). At hospital admission 17 patients (38%) had prothrombin times outside therapeutic ranges (between 20 to 30% of the normal value). The incidence of reoperations for thrombosis in low-profile mechanical prostheses was unaffected by valvar position and number of prostheses implanted. Rethrombosis occurred only in previously cleaned valves, although its occurrence was not significant. The present results indicate that, as experience is gained in the diagnosis and surgical management of this complication, hospital mortality can be reduced significantly (from 37% to 4%).\r"

None of the late deaths was related to the tricuspid annuloplasty. Three patients required tricuspid valve replacement for recurrence of tricuspid regurgitation (0.68% per annum). Eleven asymptomatic patients studied hemodynamically at a mean period of 53 months after the operation showed maintenance of the hemodynamic improvement. We recommend DeVega annuloplasty as the method of choice for moderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation in the absence of an organically diseased or deformed valve.\r"

The 2 patients in Group 1 underwent early repair of TAPVD (1 at 7 days, the other at 1 1/2 months of age) before any subsequent operation and are now doing well at 18 months of age. The 6 patients in Group 2 underwent repeat cardiac catheterization because of persistent severe cyanosis with faint or absent continuous murmur and were found to have patent shunts and obstructed TAPVD (1 mild, 5 severe). One patient who underwent repair of TAPVD at 2 1/2 months of age survived and is well at 2 years of age, whereas 4 patients who underwent repair at an average age of 6 months (age range, 3-16 months) subsequently died. The sixth patient, who did not undergo repair, remained severely cyanotic with hypoplastic pulmonary arteries in spite of repeated shunts. We feel that increased awareness of the possible association of TAPVD and reduced pulmonary blood flow in infants with complex cardiac defects, in combination with echocardiography, oxygen saturation studies, and angiography with prostaglandin E1 challenge, should lead to early diagnosis, avoidance of unnecessary systemic-pulmonary artery shunts, and increased survival rates in these infants.\r"

This technique permitted accurate resection of the web, thorough removal of thrombus from the IVC and the hepatic veins, and repair of the atriocaval junction with an autologous pericardial patch. Postoperative angiographic study showed unobstructed flow through the IVC with filling of the hepatic veins. We believe this is the first report of use of this technique to treat Budd-Chiari syndrome resulting from a congenital web obstructing the IVC and hepatic veins.\r"

A retrospective medical chart review compared 93 patients with cerebral infarctions treated before CT scanning was available with 92 patients who had undergone scanning. The two groups showed no difference in type of treatment given or in subsequent severity of disability, mortality, or discharge destination. However, the post-CT group had a significant reduction in the total number of neurodiagnostic procedures, but estimated total charges for all diagnostic procedures were not significantly reduced. Computed tomographic scanning may not be beneficial for stroke patients who have a clear history of acute onset, are alert, and have no findings indicating an intracranial mass.\r"

We examined seven maturity-onset diabetic patients with rarely reported hypouricemia due to renal tubular abnormality to better understand the renal handling of urate by the diabetic kidney. The results of studies indicate that the increase in urate clearance was entirely accounted for by increased pyrazinamide-suppressible urate clearance. The maximal uricosuric response to probenecid administration was exaggerated. The effects of drugs on urate clearance were similar to those we have previously reported in the syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone. In four patients, the family survey did not reveal anyone with hypouricemia. These observations suggest that hypouricemia due to hyperuricosuria, which responds markedly to pyrazinamide and probenecid, is actually an indicator of renal tubular abnormality in diabetics.\r"

  ".W": "Fifty-one successive patients treated with intravenous streptokinase 1.7 +/- 0.8 (mean +/- SD) hours after onset of symptoms of acute myocardial infarction were evaluated during a three-month posthospital follow-up period. Coronary angiography was performed four to nine days after the initial hospital admission. Twenty-eight patients had a second late angiogram. Forty-one patients had successful reperfusion but only 25% of all patients were without significant clinical cardiovascular manifestations during this period. Postmyocardial infarction angina pectoris occurred in 21 patients, an abnormal stress test result was present in 28 patients, eight patients developed congestive heart failure, and five patients had reinfarction. An intervention with percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty or coronary artery bypass graft was performed in 15 (37%) of 41 reperfused patients. A significantly higher intervention rate was present in patients treated with streptokinase within one hour following the onset of symptoms. Early reocclusion (within three months of the infarct) was noted in patients with 60% or more residual stenosis in their infarct-related coronary artery. These patients also had a significantly greater incidence of angina pectoris. Our findings indicate that early thrombolytic therapy of acute myocardial infarction preserves myocardium, and since the infarct-related artery is patent, but narrowed, the jeopardized area is responsible for a high-risk syndrome with an increased likelihood of ischemic symptoms. An early aggressive approach may be indicated, especially for patients with greater than 60% residual stenosis in their infarct-related coronary artery.\r"

In a previous study, patients with pulmonary embolism, as assessed by pulmonary angiography, were at significantly increased risk of occult cancer with a comparison group of patients without pulmonary embolism. This nonconcurrent prospective epidemiologic study extends these findings by demonstrating a significantly increased risk of occult cancer in patients with deep venous thrombosis (DVT) confirmed by impedance plethysmography as compared with those with suspected DVT in whom the diagnosis was ruled out. Differences in the incidence of malignant neoplasms were greatest within the first two years after the diagnosis of DVT, and patients younger than 50 years with venous thrombosis were at particularly increased risk of occult cancer (relative risk, 19.0). These findings indicate that all patients with DVT or pulmonary embolism should have an appropriate diagnostic workup and careful follow-up, particularly with regard to the risk of occult cancer.\r"

To assess the predictive value of ST segment elevation and ST segment depression (both greater than or equal to 0.1 mV) for the diagnosis of evolving myocardial infarction, we studied 100 consecutive patients admitted to the coronary care unit of The New York Hospital with at least 30 minutes of chest pain. Of 31 patients with ST segment elevation, 26 patients (84%) evolved myocardial infarction (positive test results for serum creatine phosphokinase-MB isoenzyme fraction), while only 13 (48%) of 27 patients with ST segment depression had myocardial infarctions. Among patients with ST segment elevations with a history of prior myocardial infarction, only five (50%) of ten evolved myocardial infarction, compared with 21 of 21 with no prior infarction. False-positive diagnoses of acute injury were due to ST elevation in the area of prior Q wave infarction. Prior myocardial infarction did not alter the lower predictive value of ST segment depression for evolving infarction. We conclude that patients presenting with chest pain and ST segment elevation have approximately twice the likelihood of myocardial infarction than patients with ST segment depression; incorporation of historic information regarding prior myocardial infarction can improve the predictive value of ST segment elevations to 100% but does not improve prediction with ST segment depressions.\r"

Most of the patients were men between the ages of 35 and 45 years, who presented with ulceroglandular tularemia. Twelve patients had the anticipated rapid response to therapy, with resolution of their presenting symptoms within one week (group A). Surprisingly, the majority (16 [58%] of 28) had a more prolonged or fatal illness (group B). Group B patients more often had a serious underlying medical disorder, and waited longer before seeking medical attention. Only patients in group B presented with electrolyte or renal function abnormalities (31%), pneumonia and pleural effusions (25%), elevated serum creatine phosphokinase levels (25%), and Francisella tularensis bacteremia (12.5%). Sterile pyuria, however, was an unexpectedly frequent finding in both groups. Group B patients more often experienced a prolonged delay from the time of physician contact to therapy, and were not treated with an aminoglycoside; relapse (12.5%) and death (6.2%) occurred only in group B. Thus, earlier and more appropriate intervention by the physician may have prevented some of the increased morbidity in our patients. These findings suggest that rapid presumptive aminoglycoside therapy (gentamicin sulfate or streptomycin sulfate) should be considered soon after tularemia is suspected, especially for patients with serious underlying medical disorders.\r"

Prior to our initial consultation, these 73 patients had required 115 emergency room visits and 37 hospitalizations. No deaths have occurred in 224 patient years of follow-up from initial presentation. Thirty-eight (52%) patients have infrequent reactions (defined as one episode only or mild episodes less than six times per year) requiring acute treatment alone. Thirty-five (48%) patients have severe or frequent life-threatening reactions (defined as episodes that include syncope, documented hypotension, and airway compromise as major manifestations) requiring maintenance antihistamines and prednisone. Laboratory studies were not helpful in finding a cause of anaphylaxis in any of the 73 patients. Associated atopic conditions were present in 45 patients. Twenty-three patients had chronic idiopathic angioedema, urticaria, or both prior to developing idiopathic anaphylaxis. Sixteen patients only treated acutely for each episode of anaphylaxis and seven patients previously receiving maintenance medication are now asymptomatic without medication for longer than one year.\r"

The 25-hydroxyvitamin D or 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D levels were normal or low in the 11 patients in whom determinations were made. Hypercalcemia that is not due to hyperparathyroidism or hypervitaminosis D is a potential complication of advanced chronic liver disease.\r"

The most striking difference between these two groups of patients was a significantly lower mortality rate for the nonbacteremic patients. These findings suggest that ecthyma gangrenosum can occur as a primary skin lesion in the absence of bacteremia.

The finding of metastatic disease on FNA was totally unexpected in four patients. The possibility of metastasis was not mentioned before FNA in six patients with a known history of nonthyroidal cancer. Only six patients underwent a thyroid operation after FNA.

During follow-up (up to 36 months), there were 12 cardiac events; four patients died of cardiac causes and eight had nonfatal acute myocardial infarction. Univariate and multivariate survival analysis identified two independent predictors of cardiac events: the event rate was significantly less in patients with normal images and exercise heart rate over 120 beats per minute than in patients with abnormal images and exercise heart rate of 120 beats per minute or less (0% vs 22%). The patients with abnormal images or exercise heart rate of 120 beats per minute or less had an intermediate event rate (11.5%). Furthermore, two of the 54 patients with normal images and ten of 69 patients with abnormal images had subsequent cardiac events. Thus, exercise thallium imaging is useful in risk stratification in patients with diabetes mellitus.\r"

Nine patients (69%) achieved normocalcemia after treatment with cisplatin; and mean duration of benefit was 38 days in these patients. No reduction in tumor size was seen.

It was then demonstrated that therapeutic concentrations of a variety of antibiotics (cefazolin sodium, gentamicin sulfate, tobramycin sulfate, ticarcillin disodium, penicillin G potassium, vancomycin hydrochloride, metronidazole hydrochloride, piperacillin sodium, and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole) did not interfere with the LAL assay. Together, these data indicate that the LAL assay is useful for identifying patients at high risk for gram-negative peritonitis and for excluding from possible aminoglycoside exposure the majority of patients with peritonitis undergoing CAPD, most of whom will have gram-positive infections. Furthermore, lack of antibiotic interference allows the possibility of monitoring treatment efficacy.\r"

Four of the patients in the outbreak required hospitalization for two to five weeks; there were no fatalities. Eight of the cases had documented Q fever hepatitis, and one had pneumonia. All 18 of the 1984 cases for whom information was available were epidemiologically linked to visiting or working at a sheep research station and/or being exposed to animals from this research station. In this outbreak, patients typically had a hepatitislike illness associated with fever and severe headache. Severity of illness ranged from asymptomatic to life threatening. Cases of pneumonia and hepatitis due to Q fever continue to occur in the United States, especially among persons exposed to livestock.\r"

Primary care physicians identified 17 (40%) of these patients, as well as another patient identified during a six-month follow-up period, as having a substance abuse problem at initial clinical evaluation. Clinically identified substance abusers were older, more likely to be married, and more often used multiple drugs. They more frequently had antisocial personality disorders, while patients not clinically recognized were often depressed. Logistic regression analysis indicated that the presence of antisocial personality, the absence of a coexisting depressive disorder, and better social functioning scores were the factors most strongly associated with clinical recognition. The study suggests clinical judgment issues, which may be useful to physicians in training to improve their recognition and treatment of substance abuse disorders.\r"

This study compares the relative frequency with which individual symptom criteria from each system discriminate across study cohorts. Findings suggest that for SPD, the most characteristic (core) DSM-III symptoms are odd communication, suspiciousness/paranoid ideation, and social isolation, while the least discriminating symptom is illusions/depersonalization/derealization; the core DSM-III symptoms for BPD are unstable relationships, impulsivity, and self-damaging acts, while the least discriminating symptoms are inappropriate anger and intolerance of aloneness; depression as a symptom does not discriminate between SPD and BPD; and transient psychoses and brief paranoid experiences and/or regression in treatment discriminate for SPD but against BPD and therefore fit better as SPD criteria. Results support the retention of some, but the elimination of other, DSM-III symptom criteria for the diagnosis of SPD and BPD.\r"

  ".W": "The prune belly syndrome is a well-recognized entity consisting of deficient abdominal musculature, cryptorchid testes, and urinary tract abnormalities most consistent with an obstructive phenomenon. However, an obstructive lesion has not been consistently identified in previously reported cases. Retrospective review of the autopsy files of The Johns Hopkins Hospital, Baltimore, identified 18 cases of prune belly syndrome occurring since 1945. In 13 cases, obstructive lesions in the lower urinary tract had been described grossly. A single case, in which the lower urinary tract had been preserved intact and subsequently serially sectioned as 8-micron sections taken at every 120 micron, demonstrated an obstruction consisting of two overriding urethral lumens connected only by a narrow channel. Reconstruction of the sections suggested that this represented a \"kink\" in a short segment of the prostatic urethra just above the membranous urethra, leading to the obstructive changes of bladder hypertrophy and dilatation, hydroureter, hydronephrosis, and renal dysplasia seen higher in the urinary tract. The results suggest that examination of the lower urinary tract in cases of prune belly syndrome by serial histologic sectioning of the intact unopened prostatic and penile urethra may be required to demonstrate the presence or absence of an obstructive lesion.\r"

The product was also observed in the rough endoplasmic reticulum, nuclear envelope, and Golgi apparatus of the ganglion cells. Acetylcholinesterase activity in the aganglionic segment was observed in and between the plasma membranes of nerve fibers and nerve terminals, which terminated in proximity to smooth muscle cells.

The main features included the following: absence of collagen staining inside the tumor with Sirius red; decrease of collagen types I and III and the increase of collagen type IV, laminin, and fibronectin; widening of Disse's spaces containing numerous, discontinuous, and thick fragments of basement membrane-like material piled up beneath endothelial cells and around perisinusoidal cells; transformation of perisinusoidal cells into cells with the characteristics of fibroblasts and myofibroblasts; decreased numbers of fenestrae for endothelial cells with processes often overlapping and attached with tight junctions; and rarefaction of Kupffer's cells. Expression of cellular and extracellular material abnormalities are related to the tumor differentiation. The study of these abnormalities may have implications in prognosis.\r"

Five of the 45 patients with SLE had HBs antigenemia, and the prevalence was not significantly different from that of the general population in Hong Kong. The renal biopsy findings of these five patients showed lupus nephritis in two and features suggestive of hepatitis-induced glomerulonephritis in three. Our findings do not support an increased prevalence of HBsAg in sera or kidney of patients with SLE, and hepatitis B virus is unlikely to have a pathogenetic role in SLE in areas where both SLE and HBs antigenemia are common.\r"

Intraglomerular tubular epithelial cells did not occur in four patients with drug-induced interstitial nephritis and microscopic hematuria, or in 11 normal controls. The pathogenesis of ITEC is not known, but our data indicate that the phenomenon is almost constantly found in association with glomerular hematuria. Identification of ITEC, therefore, should help to confirm the glomerular origin of hematuria when histologic alterations are minimal.\r"

The lesions were identical in location and morphology to those previously described in patients who received chemotherapy and central nervous system radiotherapy for various malignancies, and (except for their restricted anatomic location) resembled the disseminated necrotizing leukoencephalopathy that complicates central nervous system leukemia and lymphoma. The lesions are to be distinguished from central pontine myelinolysis, are confined to pontocerebellar tracts, and are not specific for the immunodeficient state, but may reflect preterminal metabolic derangements, since they seem unrelated in this clinical setting to malignancy and/or its treatment. Alternatively, they may be a consequence of the immunosuppressed state. The presence of this morphologic abnormality in two AIDS patients is especially intriguing, in view of the frequency with which white matter lesions are seen in the AIDS population.\r"

Our results suggest that a reader familiar with 12 fundamental statistical concepts can evaluate knowledgeably over 95% of the quantitative findings reported in these journals. With the exception of survival analysis and pharmacologic modeling, these techniques are typically encountered in many introductory statistical texts. In numerous articles, failure to identify the statistical methodology used made it impossible to identify the analytic procedures used and, hence, judge the scientific validity of results.\r"

Based on work that relates frequency spectral shift in myoelectric signals to muscular fatigue at other body sites, a study was carried out to investigate and evaluate strategies for application of these techniques to the lumbar musculature. Through evolution of test administration procedures to reduce test time and discomfort as well as data interpretation methods to account for interindividual variability observed in data, an approach was developed for objective measurement of fatigue rate. While abdominal and lumbar muscle groups were assessed in 40 healthy subjects with results presented for 50% and 100% maximum voluntary contraction load levels, the methodology is discussed with emphasis on erector spinae results. The approach involves a normal function fatigue plot. The plot relates fatigue rate as measured by myoelectric spectral characteristics to muscle load normalized by body weight and is independent of the maximum voluntary contraction concept. This relationship forms the basis of comparison of the measured fatigue rate for a subject with questionable function to expected normal values determined from the plot, given the measured load level.\r"

Intervention consisted of a self-instructional procedure that required him to verbalize a plan of behavior before and during execution of the training task and gradually faded overt verbalization. There was systematic reduction of off-task behaviors and problem-solving errors over the eight weeks of training. Pre- and postmeasures showed significant changes consistent with increased planning ability. Self-control ratings of everyday behaviors improved with explicit training to promote generalization. Training of plan-ahead and self-verbalization strategies appears effective for remediation of executive functioning after traumatic brain injury. Generalization to real-life situations can be observed with extended training.\r"

No complications were observed, and all three cases are now symptom free. Daily ultrasound treatments are time-consuming and costly but are safe and may be useful for patients who refuse surgical sympathectomy. We hypothesize that ultrasound may have affected peripheral sympathetic nerve fibers. However, more indirect effects of ultrasound, such as increased blood flow to the limb, may be part of the action mechanism as well.\r"

This quality is appreciated at present only by the subjective method of palpation. Use of the TCM therefore offers a method to quantify palpation of tissue consistency and to document findings objectively. The handheld instrument allows immediate and simple reading of the depth of penetration of a rubber disc at a known pressure. The relation between the achieved penetration and employed pressure expresses the compliance. The TCM consists of a rubber disc with the surface of 1 cm2 attached to a force gauge. The depth of penetration of the rubber tip is indicated by a disc which slides on the shaft of the force gauge. Normal values were established for men and women over muscles which are frequently affected by spasm. Tissue compliance measurement can document changes in soft tissue consistency which occur in muscle spasm, spasticity, swelling, tumors, lumps, hematomas, etc. Use of the TCM provides the most sensitive and earliest objective indication of either healing and resolution in soft tissue pathology or occurrence of complications. Changes in muscle tone such as reduction of spasm, tension, or spasticity can be recorded. The effects of different types of physical therapy can thus be documented objectively.\r"

Multivariate analyses revealed significant interaction effect with posthoc comparisons, indicating that spouses in distressed SCI marriages engaged in significantly fewer activities alone and with their spouse and requested the greatest degree of change in the marital relationship in comparison with the other groups. There was a significant main effect for marital satisfaction, with distressed couples expressing more dissatisfaction in sexual relations and more negative communications during conflict resolution tasks. Although the results do not indicate that substantive differences exist in quantitative and qualitative aspects of marital relations between SCI and AB couples, several trends were observed which suggest the need for further research.\r"

Laryngeal disorders and cricopharyngeal dysfunction occurred in a small number of patients. The average head trauma patient exhibited more than one swallowing motility problem. Twenty patients aspirated, with delayed or absent swallowing reflex as the most common etiology for the aspiration. Many of these patients did not produce a reflexive cough during or after they had aspirated material into their airway. For this reason, and since the pharyngeal stage of the swallow is extremely difficult to assess with presently available bedside techniques, videofluorographic evaluation becomes an invaluable tool for identification of the precise nature of the swallowing disturbance, the presence of aspiration, and the etiology of the aspiration.\r"

Minimally sighted subjects balanced for longer than fully blind subjects, but no differences in balance were found between subjects blind from birth versus those with acquired vision loss.

Reasons for disuse and problems with braces were examined. Wheelchairs were rated significantly higher than long leg braces on value, potency and activity level permitted. A needs assessment revealed that transportation and mobility concerns were more prevalent than other areas of concern. Differences between KAFO users and former users were examined by discriminant analyses. Former users tended to have complete lesions and to be older; current users tended to have incomplete lesions and to be younger. Despite the problems associated with KAFOs, it is clear that this technology will continue to be useful to some degree for about 10% of individuals.\r"

Forty head-injured inpatients were evaluated with the DRS and LCFS four times weekly throughout their rehabilitation hospitalization. The DRS and LCFS were compared in terms of how consistently ratings could be made by different raters, how stable those ratings were from day to day, their relative correlation with Stover Zeiger (S-Z) ratings collected concurrently at admission, and with S-Z, Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS), and Expanded GOS (EGOS) ratings collected concurrently at discharge, and finally in the ability of admission DRS and LCFS scores to predict discharge ratings on the S-Z, GOS, and EGOS. Results suggest that both scales possess significant degrees of test-retest and interrater reliabilities, and of concurrent and predictive validities, but the DRS surpasses the LCFS in nearly every regard. These results offer psychometric justification favoring the use of the DRS for monitoring recovery from head injury.\r"

Using control scores to determine the cutoff point between visual inattention and noninattention, 14 patients (50%) showed evidence of visuospatial neglect on the RBIT. Correlation between the two forms of the test was 0.83. The RBIT also correlated well with five of the conventional tests. Interrater reliability was 100%. The RBIT appears to be a valid and reliable test of visuospatial neglect and one which is likely to provide more information about everyday problems than existing measures of neglect.\r"

The series in which the disposable spun-laced fiber system was used had a significantly lower overall infection rate (2.83% vs 6.5%) as well as better rates in clean (1.8% vs 3.8%) and clean-contaminated (4.8% vs 11.4%) procedures. This effect was independent of all other factors. The odds of developing a wound infection was 2 1/2 times higher with a cotton system than with a disposable system. Actual cost analysis from three types of hospitals showed lower costs with utilization of disposable gown and drape systems. Hospital charges were significantly higher for those patients developing wound infections. The results of the study demonstrated not only significant reduction in wound infection rates but also major cost savings when a disposable gown and drape system was used in the operating room.\r"

These issues are fundamental in designing studies with an acceptable likelihood of finding differences among those antimicrobial regimens at least risk to the study subjects. The importance of stratifying patients on the basis of background condition, disease, and severity of illness is stressed. The inclusion in a study of variables that enhance the statistical power and, therefore, the believability of this study is stressed as an important means of clarifying substantial differences between therapies.\r"

In part 1 of this study, we measured the following variables in 404 preoperative patients: cutaneous delayed-type hypersensitivity, age, serum albumin level, contamination status at the time of surgery, and the duration of surgery. Patients were examined daily postoperatively for the presence of an operative site infection (culture-positive drainage or infected tissue; overall rate, 17.3%). The above variables, plus previously defined risk factors, were examined by logistic regression analysis using the development of an operative site infection as the dependent variable. An equation to calculate the probability of developing a postoperative wound infection was thus derived. In part 2 of the study, a separate, matched group of 404 preoperative patients was used to test the validity of this predictive equation. A good fit of the model was obtained, with 70.3 wound infections predicted and 67 obtained (chi 2 = 0.8; not significant, ie, no difference between expected and observed wound infections at all probability deciles). We conclude that there are three determinants of an operative site infection, host defense (delayed-type hypersensitivity), acute and chronic physiologic derangement (albumin and age) and bacterial contamination risk at surgery (contamination status and duration of surgery).\r"

Hepatic injury with carbon tetrachloride resulted in significant suppression of the DTH score (5.5 +/- 0.7 vs 8.8 +/- 0.8 mm). Kupffer cell activation with intraportal Escherichia coli was likewise suppressive (DTH score, 4.4 +/- 0.5 vs 6.1 +/- 0.4 mm for animals receiving systemic E coli); the magnitude of this suppression correlated with the numbers of organisms extracted by the liver. Conversely, Kupffer cell ablation with carrageenan lessened the immunosuppressive effects of anesthesia and surgery (DTH score, 8.5 +/- 0.9 vs 6.8 +/- 0.6 mm for controls; S aureus abscess, 4.1 +/- 0.4 vs 5.7 +/- 0.4 mm for controls). These results indicate that Kupffer cells can modulate the systemic immune response and suggest that gram-negative portal bacteremia with resultant Kupffer cell activation may contribute to the immunologic derangements characteristic of trauma and critical surgical illness.\r"

Following loading or maintenance doses, carefully timed blood samples were collected for measurements of serum concentrations by fluorescence polarization immunoassay. The Vd, determined by linear regression analysis of a one-compartment model using the Sawchuk-Zaske method, was 0.34 +/- 0.121 L/kg and was larger than the normal Vd of 0.20 to 0.25 L/kg, suggesting a 36% to 70% increase in extracellular fluid volume. Since there is a predictable increase in aminoglycoside Vd in the septic surgical patient, a proportionately larger aminoglycoside dosage is required initially to achieve desirable peak serum levels. Close monitoring of blood levels during maintenance dosing is suggested since dynamic changes in renal function and aminoglycoside Vd occur in the critically ill.\r"

Measurement of lymphocyte subpopulations is difficult in burned patients because gradient-purified cells are contaminated by nonlymphoid cells. The accuracy of flow cytometric subpopulation analysis was improved by restricting (gating) the analysis to cells with light-scatter intensity typical of lymphocytes. Blood was obtained 48 hours after burn from rats receiving no burns, 30% scald burns, or burns seeded with Pseudomonas aeruginosa to induce infection. Subpopulations were identified by monoclonal antibodies to T-lymphocyte antigens. Gating increased the values obtained for most subpopulations, but the relative differences between groups were unchanged. Burned and infected animals, but not animals burned only, had a decreased ratio of helper to suppressor lymphocytes (HSR) relative to control. A decreased HSR correlated with sepsis, but not with infection susceptibility. This suggests that a decrease in HSR may be a result of infection rather than a cause of susceptibility to infection.\r"

The corresponding mean subcutaneous temperature increased 4.0 degrees C. A significant linear correlation was found between the change in Psqo2 and subcutaneous temperature. There was an average threefold increase in local perfusion estimated by using the Fick principle. The data reaffirm the value of local hyperthermia in treating contaminated wounds and suggest a mechanism for its ability to ameliorate infections. The mechanism implies that local heat may have prophylactic value as well.\r"

In the absence of monocytes (macrophages), there was insignificant inhibition by C3b of lymphocyte proliferation, and thus the observed inhibition appeared to be due to the effect of C3b on the monocytes/macrophages present in the mixed lymphocyte preparations.\r"

A suggestive picture with ipsilateral headache and oculosympathetic paresis was uncommon (17%), so that diagnosis was uncertain before angiography. Seven patients died within one week. During follow-up (mean, 3.2 years) with sequential Doppler ultrasonographic testing, 12 survivors had a good recovery and early reopening of the occluded ICA, and 11 had a poor recovery usually without reopening of the ICA. Recurrence of a dissection occurred in only one patient. Large infarcts causing death or a severe disability were associated with an ICA thrombus and distal emboli; the organization of this intraluminal thrombosis may explain the absence of reopening in these cases while resorption of the intramural hematoma developed. Early heparin sodium therapy may help prevent intraluminal clotting without carrying an important risk of extending the dissection, but its clinical benefit remains unproven. Contrary to current opinions, ICA dissection with occlusion causing cerebral infarction may often carry a severe prognosis.\r"

In general, the levels of agreement were as high as previously reported for the diagnosis of the mechanism of the stroke, and much higher than on many stroke history items and items of neurologic examination. Excellent agreement was obtained for the detection of infarcts and intracerebral hemorrhage, and substantial agreement was obtained on whether the computed tomographic images were normal or indicative of small deep infarcts, superficial and deep infarcts, and aneurysms. The level of agreement on anatomy of the lesions was best for the frontal, parietal, and temporal lobes, putamen, cerebellum, and subarachnoid space. Implications for clinical research and diagnosis are discussed.\r"

Regional cerebral blood flow measured with the xenon 133 intracarotid injection technique was analyzed in 11 patients in whom a low-flow area developed during attacks of classic migraine. When measured with this technique, regional cerebral blood flow in focal low-flow areas will be overestimated because of the effect of scattered radiation (Compton scatter) on the recordings. In this study, this effect was particularly taken into account when evaluating the degree of blood flow reduction. During attacks of classic migraine, cerebral blood flow reductions averaging 52% were observed focally in the 11 patients. Cerebral blood flow levels known to be insufficient for normal cortical function (less than 16 to 23 mL/100 g/min) were measured in seven patients during the attacks. This was probably also the case in the remaining four patients, but the effect of scattered radiation made a reliable evaluation of blood flow impossible. It is concluded that the blood flow reduction that occurs during attacks of classic migraine is sufficient to cause ischemia and neurologic deficits. Hence, this study suggests a vascular origin of the prodromal neurologic deficits that may accompany attacks of classic migraine.\r"

This incidence of visual loss is 50% greater than any previously reported series. All major defects detected were present with both types of perimetry. Both strategies were more sensitive for documenting visual loss than previously described strategies.

A low error group performed like controls, while a high error group had a learning impairment comparable to that of AD patients.

The recovery of autonomic function was slower than that of neuromuscular transmission in three patients. Monitoring autonomic derangement in botulism adds further information on the course of the disease and may identify patients at risk for cardiac or respiratory arrest.

  ".W": "The epidermal nevus syndrome is a neurocutaneous disorder characterized by distinctive skin lesions and often serious somatic and central nervous system (CNS) abnormalities. We observed four cases of this disorder with epidermal nevi and neurologic manifestations, including mental retardation, seizures, ophthalmologic abnormalities, intracranial aneurysm, and porencephalic cyst. A review of 60 reported cases of the epidermal syndrome and our experience suggest that CNS complications are more likely to be associated with epidermal nevi on the head and that the CNS abnormalities are most often ipsilateral to the skin lesion.\r"

  ".W": "A 4-month-old child with a very rare association of primary (congenital) left cerebral hypoplasia, hypoplasia of the left internal carotid artery, and giant anterior communicating artery aneurysm was seen. The aneurysm was detected and treated before rupture. We briefly reviewed the literature on agenesis (hypoplasia) of the internal carotid artery, intracranial aneurysms in childhood, and primary cerebral hypoplasia. It is proposed that cerebral arteriography, cranial computed tomography, or magnetic resonance imaging be performed in all children with primary cerebral hemihypoplasia to establish an etiologic diagnosis and, more importantly, to detect and treat possible associated intracranial aneurysms before they become symptomatic.\r"
