This study included 578 patients and 6363 cardiotocographs ranging from 20 to 42 weeks of gestation. The small wave was observed in 7.5% of the cardiotocographs examined, and the rate of small-wave appearance in each gestational week tended to decrease gradually as the pregnancy progressed. This was not observed after 41 weeks of gestation. The small wave-positive group had relatively poor obstetric parameters and fetal outcome, and the small wave was frequently observed in cases of effective beta 2-stimulant intravenous infusion for the treatment of preterm labor. These results suggest that the small wave represents some degree of contractility and is ominous in general; however, the appearance of the wave does not lead to a poor prognosis in preterm labor if large phasic contractions can be abolished by beta 2-stimulant treatment.\r"

Each subject completed the trials during the fifteenth, twenty-fifth, and thirty-fifth weeks of pregnancy, as well as a control period 8 to 10 weeks post partum. Resting oxygen uptake increased with advancing pregnancy. Resting oxygen uptake was higher in the water than on land but was not altered by pregnancy. Exercise oxygen uptakes were similar for all trials, but the work load required to elicit the VO2 decreased during the thirty-fifth week of pregnancy. Exercise heart rates followed the same pattern as oxygen uptake. Lactate concentrations declined with advancing pregnancy after exercise. Blood glucose levels were normal for pregnancy but declined slightly during exercise. Blood triglyceride levels were elevated with exercise, with a tendency to increase with advancing pregnancy. Resting plasma cortisol concentrations increased with pregnancy but remained lower during immersion and exercise. These results suggest that pregnancy significantly alters metabolic responses to exercise in the water.\r"

In 223 cases the results of hysteroscopy and curettage were in agreement. Hysteroscopy revealed more information than curettage in 44 patients, whereas curettage revealed more information than hysteroscopy in only nine patients. When the results of this study are combined with those of previous studies, there is little doubt that panoramic hysteroscopy is superior to curettage in making an accurate diagnosis of pathologic conditions in the uterine cavity.\r"

Systolic aortic flow velocity waveforms were obtained by pulsed Doppler ultrasound from the apical five-chamber echocardiographic window. Aortic diameters were obtained by two-dimensional echocardiography from the left parasternal long axis view. The mean (+/- SEM) aortic diameter averaged 2.1 +/- 0.1 cm, with a mean calculated aortic valve area of 3.6 +/- 0.2 cm2. The mean aortic flow velocity integral was 21.8 +/- 0.8 cm. This information was used to calculate aortic stroke volume and cardiac output. Thermodilution- and Doppler-derived estimations for maternal stroke volume (r = 0.86) and cardiac output (r = 0.94) were significantly correlated when aortic diameter measurements based on a leading vessel edge method were used. Our findings verify the accuracy of an important noninvasive technique for quantitating maternal stroke volume and cardiac output by pulsed Doppler echocardiography. This methodology should provide an alternative approach to invasive monitoring in the study of normal and abnormal maternal circulatory hemodynamics.\r"

These women could not be easily categorized into one specific hemodynamic pattern. Most patients had high-normal to elevated systemic vascular resistance indices (mean 2726 +/- 120 dynes.sec.cm-5.m2). The mean cardiac index was 4.14 +/- 0.13 L.min-1.m2. The severity of hypertension was largely attributable to a disproportionate rise in the systolic component (mean 193 +/- 3 mm Hg) compared with diastolic blood pressure (mean 110 +/- 3 mm Hg). Women with eclampsia had significantly lower arterial blood pressure and systemic vascular resistance indices when compared with those of the rest of the study group. Analysis of Starling curves indicated that all patients had normal or hyperdynamic left ventricular function. A modest correlation was observed between central venous pressure and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (r = 0.59). This disparity most likely results from the maintenance of normal to high cardiac output in the presence of an increased left ventricular afterload. The majority of patients with severe pregnancy-induced hypertension do have normal to high cardiac indices and pulmonary capillary wedge pressures accompanied by normal or hyperdynamic left ventricular function. This is true despite the presence of severe hypertension.\r"

Immature levels of 35 kD protein (less than 0.6 micrograms/ml) predicted 59% of all cases of respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) with an accuracy of 91%, and mature levels of 35 kD protein (greater than 3.0 micrograms/ml) predicted 68% of all infants who did not have RDS with an accuracy of 100%. The overall accuracy of the 35 kD protein in predicting the risk of developing respiratory distress syndrome was similar to that of the lung profile. In addition, testing with 35 kD protein improved the predictive value of an indeterminate lung profile (lecithin/sphingomyelin ratio of 1:1.9 and no phosphatidylglycerol) from 52% to 74%.

Among these, 23 were terminated by induced abortions, 26 as miscarriages, two as ectopic gestations, two as intrauterine deaths, and three as stillbirths. Among 303 livebirths (including four sets of twins), six infants died neonatally, three of whom were found to have congenital anomalies incompatible with life, and two died during infancy. All the remaining 295 children had normal growth and development, the oldest now being 25 years of age. The rates of fetal wastage, malformations, twin pregnancies, and neonatal and infantile deaths did not deviate from the normal. Cytogenetic study of the peripheral lymphocytes of 94 of the children revealed no increase of chromosomal aberrations. The rates of recurrence of disease and of death caused by recurrence of disease in these were not increased in comparison with those in patients who underwent hysterectomy. These data indicate that treatment of malignant trophoblastic neoplasms with chemotherapy alone is compatible with the preservation of fertility in most women.\r"

The activity of thymidine kinase isozymes in plasma of preterm and term newborns has been previously reported to be related to gestational age, and fetal thymidine kinase activity was reported to be undetectable after the thirty-ninth week of gestation. Our purpose was to determine if similar changes in the activity levels of the thymidine kinase isozymes could be demonstrated in late third trimester maternal plasma. A cross-sectional sample of 35 patients was studied from week 34 of pregnancy to delivery. Significant differences between fetal and adult thymidine kinase activity patterns were observed. Adult thymidine kinase activity remained relatively constant throughout the evaluation interval, while fetal thymidine kinase activity decreased with advancing gestational age. Regression analysis of gestational age by neonatal examination (GAPED) and fetal thymidine kinase revealed a linear relationship (fetal thymidine kinase = 0.380 - 0.00745 GAPED; R2 = 0.2944; standard estimate of error = 0.0350; p less than 0.0008). Comparison of fetal thymidine kinase activity in term and postterm pregnancy plasma revealed a significant difference (p less than 0.0159). Our findings indicate that deoxythymidine kinase activity can be measured in maternal plasma, may relate to the fetoplacental growth rate, and may be useful in differentiating between term and postterm gestations.\r"

Endogenous concentrations of K vitamins (phylloquinone and menaquinones) in human placentas and in paired specimens of maternal and umbilical cord plasma were detected by high-performance liquid chromatography with fluorometric detection and postcolumn reduction. Phylloquinone (K1) and menaquinones (MK-4, MK-6, and MK-7) were found in placentas and maternal plasma. K1 and MK-4 were found in umbilical cord plasma. The experimental subjects were 13 pregnant women with normal diets (group A) and two pregnant women with diets supplemented with fermented soybeans (group B), in which MK-7 is abundant. Samples from their placentas and maternal and umbilical cord plasma were collected just after delivery. The placentas and maternal plasma of group B contained higher concentrations of MK-7 (placentas = 10.82 ng/gm and maternal plasma = 3.55 ng/ml) than did group A (placentas = 1.08 ng/gm, maternal plasma = 0.70 ng/ml).

The fetal pharmacokinetics were calculated from fetal blood samples obtained by cordocentesis. No clear evidence of placental transfer of digoxin administered to the mother could be found despite a digoxin concentration in the mother that ranged from 1.8 to 2.6 ng/ml for 4 days. After direct fetal digitalization we calculated that the coefficient of elimination for digoxin from the fetus was 0.0463 h-1, and digoxin elimination half-life was 15.9 hours. The latter time span is substantially less than the 50-hour half-life previously reported in newborn infants with low birth weight. The fetal/maternal concentration ratio of procainamide was 0.914. However, maternal clearance of procainamide (9.7 ml/kg-1/min-1) was twice as long as the clearance reported for nonpregnant patients undergoing fast acetylation. We conclude first, that at least in the dose of this ill fetus, little digoxin administered to the mother crossed the placentae; and second, that while direct fetal therapy with digoxin is effective, the necessary frequent number of injections render this therapy impractical. Direct fetal digitalization should probably be reserved for the preterm fetus who has evidence of heart failure and has not responded to maternally administered therapy other than digoxin.\r"

Among 47 women reexamined after starting therapy, three rapidly became worse and were hospitalized, nine (20%) discontinued therapy because of gastrointestinal side effects, and all of the remaining 35 women who completed therapy were either cured or improved.\r"

  ".W": "The concentrations of prolactin in the milk of nine postpartum lactating mothers were determined by radioimmunoassay between days 3 to 280 of the puerperium (n = 324 samples). In addition, prolactin in milk was also determined at the beginning and the end of suckling in three of the same women, who provided 21 paired samples of foremilk and hindmilk between days 7 and 88 of the puerperium. Prolactin content was highest at 43.1 +/- 4 ng/ml (mean +/- SEM) in the early transition milk immediately after the colostrum phase during the first postpartum week, decreasing to 11.0 +/- 1.4 ng/ml in the mature milk (p less than 0.01) when weaning occurred in those mothers who breastfed for up to 40 weeks post partum. During suckling, the foremilk contained significantly more prolactin as compared with the hindmilk (29.5 +/- 2.7 versus 21.0 +/- 3.2 ng/ml; p less than 0.01). These findings, taken together with the known biologic potency of prolactin in breast milk, the osmoregulatory influence of the hormone in mammary and intestinal function, and its absorption by the newborn experimental animal, suggest that the presence of prolactin in milk may play some role in both lactation and the intestinal absorptive function of the suckling newborn.\r"

  ".W": "Antisperm antibodies have been implicated as a causative factor of infertility and pregnancy wastage. Since concomitant autoimmune phenomena were reported in men with antisperm antibodies, we investigated known antisperm antibody-positive sera from 25 women, 27 men, and the respective seminal plasma samples. The investigated autoimmune panel included a search for antinuclear antibodies, autoantibodies (in IgG, IgM and IgA isotypes) to seven phospholipids (cardiolipin, phosphatidylserine, phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylinositol, and phosphatidic acid), to four histone subfractions (H1, H2A, H3, H4), and to four polynucleotides [ssDNA, dsDNA, poly(I), and poly(dT)], total immunoglobulin levels, and sperm antibody titers. The sera were also evaluated for the presence of a common anti-deoxyribonucleic acid antibody, and anticardiolipin antibody idiotypes. Levels of sperm antibody titers were significantly lower in women than in men. Both men and women with antisperm antibodies demonstrated elevated total IgG levels compared with those of normal control subjects. Only women showed elevated levels of total IgM. Sera from 24% of women and 11% of men with antisperm antibodies demonstrated antinuclear antibody titers greater than 1:40. The most striking autoantibody abnormalities were found among antiphospholipid antibodies. Sera from women with antisperm antibodies demonstrated higher autoantibody production than was found in their male counterparts. A significant correlation was found between antisperm antibodies and IgM anticardiolipin and IgA anti-phosphatidylinositol in women and between sperm antibodies and IgA phosphatidylserine antibodies in men. The presence of anticardiolipin and anti-deoxyribonucleic acid antibody idiotypes was significantly more frequent in women than in men. By means of discriminant analysis and variables selected by this mathematical model, the identification of 24 of 25 women and 26 of 27 men with antisperm antibodies was correctly predicted. These results suggest that women and men respond differently to sperm antigens. The apparent cross-reactivity between sperm antibodies and other autoantibodies, usually associated with autoimmune disease, suggests that a polyclonal B cell activation, similar to that seen in autoimmune diseases, occurs in patients with sperm antibodies.\r"

Ten fertile donors to an artificial insemination clinic provided semen samples at randomly assigned intervals of 12, 24, 72, and 120 hours. All specimens were produced on site, immediately incubated at 37 degrees C, and processed in triplicate. In comparing ejaculates obtained after 12 hours' abstinence with those after 120 hours, semen volume and sperm concentration demonstrated a significant increase with increasing abstinence time (p = 0.03). However, no correlation between abstinence time and percentage of motility, lateral head amplitude, cross-beat frequency, mean velocity, and mean linearity was found. We conclude that motility does not change with ejaculatory frequency and that in normal men prescribed abstinence before analysis of semen for motility characterization may not be necessary.\r"

There was 99.5% concordance between the two methods when performed on 871 simultaneous urine and serum specimens. Although the serum radioimmunoassay can detect levels of human chorionic gonadotropin as low as 10 IU/L, in this study the majority of patients with serum levels between 10 and 30 IU/L were not pregnant on clinical follow-up. Of nine patients with adequate clinical follow-up, a negative urine pregnancy test result, and a serum human chorionic gonadotropin level between 10 and 30 IU/L, only one proved to be pregnant. The Tandem Icon human chorionic gonadotropin urine test is sufficient for routine pregnancy testing and to rule out the need for immediate intervention in cases of ectopic pregnancy.\r"

The suppressive activities of supernatants from the proliferative endometria were significantly increased by the addition of progesterone into their explant cultures. The addition of both progesterone and estrogen was also effective in increasing the inhibitory degree of proliferative endometria but that of estrogen alone showed no influence. Supernatants from the secretory endometria had higher suppressive activities than those from proliferative ones and showed no change in suppressive activity by the addition of ovarian steroids. The concentrations of progesterone in supernatants were too low to inhibit immune reactivity. These findings suggest that exogenous or endogenous progesterone may indirectly play an important role in the release of immunosuppressive factor(s) from human endometrium.\r"

  ".U": "88161249\r", 
  ".W": "It is believed that progestins and glucocorticoids block estrogen-induced growth of the uterus by perturbing the mechanism of estrogen stimulation. We have examined the effect of progesterone or dexamethasone on two rodent models of estrogen-independent proliferation of uterine epithelium. Tissues of the neonatal mouse uterus exhibit high rates of deoxyribonucleic acid synthesis in the absence of endogenous steroids. Progesterone and dexamethasone inhibit deoxyribonucleic acid synthesis in the uterine epithelium of 4-day-old mice. When grafted beneath the kidney capsule of an ovariectomized adult, the tissues of the neonatal uterus continue to grow without the addition of estrogen. Both progesterone and dexamethasone blocked uterine epithelial mitotic activity in these allografts. A true growth response can be stimulated in the uterus of an ovariectomized rat by intraluminal instillation of cholera toxin. In the present study, autoradiographic analysis showed that cholera toxin stimulation of deoxyribonucleic acid synthesis was confined to the epithelial compartment in ovariectomized, vehicle-treated rats. When ovariectomized rats were pretreated with progesterone, cholera toxin induced deoxyribonucleic acid synthesis in the stroma but not in the epithelium. Thus progesterone and dexamethasone inhibit uterine epithelial proliferation that is not driven by estrogen stimulation. Therefore in these estrogen-independent model systems, the inhibitory effects of these steroids cannot be due to antagonism of estrogen receptor--mediated events. These observations suggest that inhibition in estrogen-induced uterine epithelial proliferation may also work through a mechanism unrelated to antagonism of estrogen receptor action.\r"

Temperature changes in both the uterus and the vagina correlated well with blood flow changes measured by both techniques after intravenous administration of estradiol or norepinephrine. Thermal clearance did not correlate well with blood flow in the vagina or uterus. These methods may have value in the investigation of blood flow patterns in various clinical situations such as the pelvic pain syndrome and early pregnancy.\r"

This insult caused developmental anomalies and growth retardation that were apparent in the embryos 2 days later. We now report the long-range effects on intrauterine development of such a circumscribed metabolic insult during organogenesis. Ten pregnant animals were infused with D-mannose for 12 hours during early neurulation (day 9.5 to 10 of development). Ten control animals were infused with equimolar D-glucose during this same time interval. Mannose infusions produced maternal plasma mananose concentrations in the embryotoxic range; glucose infusions caused only slight and transient hyperglycemia. Fetuses were removed at term and examined for evidence of developmental anomalies and growth retardation. None of 137 fetuses from the mannose group or 138 fetuses from the glucose group exhibited gross anomalies. However, an excess of resorbed conceptions in the mannose group (21 versus six in the glucose group; p less than 0.01) suggested some lethal toxicity from mannose exposure during embryogenesis. Among viable fetuses, the mean body weight of those from the mannose group was significantly reduced compared with those from the glucose group (5.62 +/- 0.04 versus 5.89 +/- 0.03 gm, respectively; p less than 0.001). Reductions of a similar magnitude were noted in the mean wet weight and protein content of fetal brains, hearts, livers, and kidneys from the mannose group (range, 3.4% to 7.1% below the glucose group), indicating a symmetric pattern of fetal growth retardation. In addition, analysis of fetal ossification sites after Alizarin Red S staining revealed a significant delay of skeletal development in the mannose group. These results indicate that a relatively brief metabolic insult to embryos during early organogenesis may cause lethal developmental anomalies as well as growth retardation and delayed skeletal development that are manifested in the fetus at term.\r"

Untreated cells were found to colonize the liver, whereas treated cells colonized the lungs. This pattern held true when metastases were scored after spontaneous death or after a careful microscopic search for micrometastases. Histologic examination revealed that both the tumor nodules produced by the untreated and the treated cells had the characteristics of EC devoid of any evidence of differentiation. The immunohistochemical study of the expression of markers typical of embryonal carcinoma cells or of the extracellular matrix components laminin and collagen type IV, typical of differentiated cells, confirmed these results. However, the lack of expression of stage-specific embryonal antigen 1 (SSEA-1), a marker generally associated with the undifferentiated state, observed only in the tumors obtained after injection of treated cells, indicates that the lung nodules probably derive from cells that have responded to the induction in vitro but have dedifferentiated in vivo.\r"

Fields were selected that had large numbers of neurofibrillary tangles, also counted on the basis of green birefringence. The vascular involvement by amyloid was expressed as the ratio of amyloid positive to amyloid negative profiles. A negative correlation was found between Congophilic plaques or tangles on the one hand and vascular amyloid content on the other. In other words, cases with large numbers of Congophilic plaques had fewer Congophilic vessels, and vice versa: congophilic plaques = -3 (vessel amyloid) + 2.2, Spearman correlation coefficient, -0.61, P less than 0.01; tangles = -3.7 (vessel amyloid) + 15.6, Spearman correlation coefficient, -0.05, P greater than 0.05. When the slides were reexamined, using only fields with at least one Congophilic vessel, the negative correlation for plaque versus vessel amyloid remained highly significant, whereas that for tangles versus vessel amyloid became highly significant: Congophilic plaques = -1.2 (vessel amyloid) + 2.3, Spearman correlation coefficient, -0.48, P less than 0.01; tangles = -5 (vessel amyloid) + 19, Spearman correlation coefficient, -0.48, P less than 0.01. These data are most compatible with the hypothesis that amyloid is first produced in the parenchyma and is somehow cleared by the vessels. It is least compatible with the hypothesis that the amyloid precursor protein first enters the vessel wall to produce amyloid there, and then moves into the brain to produce amyloid in parenchymal sites.\r"

  ".W": "Oxygen-derived free radicals, particularly superoxide anion, are considered important mediators of intestinal injury induced by ischemia/reperfusion based on the protective effects of superoxide dismutase and allopurinol. A role for free radicals was investigated in a model of necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) which was initiated by a luminal, as opposed to a vascular, insult. Intestinal loops of weanling rabbits received either saline (control loops) or a solution of 10 mg/ml casein and 50 mg/ml calcium gluconate acidified to pH 4 with proprionic acid (treated loops). When the animals were sacrificed 3 hours later, severe damage was noted in the treated loops, which included blunting of villi and edema, with all animals surviving. At 16 hours only 5 of 8 rabbits survived, and 3 had hemorrhagic necrosis. Control loops were normal in each case. Intravenous infusion of superoxide dismutase (4 mg/kg/hr), commencing 15 minutes after NEC induction, totally prevented intestinal injury. On the other hand, pretreatment with allopurinol, an inhibitor of xanthine oxidase, for 2 days (30 and 60 mg/kg by mouth) was not protective against intestinal damage. A cellular infiltration in treated loops was not histologically evident in the majority of animals at 3 hours after treatment, a finding confirmed by the minimal accumulation of 111In-labeled leukocytes in damaged and intact intestinal tissue. These results suggest that superoxide generated locally from sources other than xanthine oxidase play a critical and early role in experimental NEC and that superoxide dismutase may prove to be an effective therapy in this devastating neonatal disease.\r"

Antibodies were raised to this protein and shown to react with it on nitrocellulose blots and to bind to RFs in tissue sections. Small amounts of this protein were detected in normal brain and in cultured rat astrocytes. Charge heterogeneity was inferred because several species were separated by isoelectric focusing.\r"

  ".W": "The authors probed the vascular endothelial cell cytoskeleton in strains of pigeons that are atherosclerosis-susceptible and disease-resistant, namely, the White Carneau and Show Racer pigeons. Endothelial cell actin and myosin were localized with the use of affinity-purified antibodies in conjunction with indirect immunofluorescence microscopy. The endothelial cell cytoskeleton was characterized in a site-specific and time-dependent manner by examination of arterial segments from each strain of pigeons. Anti-actin and anti-myosin fluorescence staining patterns of endothelial cells lining the ascending aorta, aortic arch, and thoracic aorta from the White Carneau and Show Racer pigeons sacrificed at 1 and 12 months of age were compared and analyzed. In the Show Racer, irrespective of arterial site or chronologic age, endothelial cell cytoskeletal organization is similar. Actin and myosin fluorescence is brightest at the cortex, where endothelial cells meet their neighbors. There is also an amorphous (diffuse) fluorescence throughout the cytoplasm. In addition to the diffuse and cortical cytoskeletal fluorescence in the endothelial cells of the Show Racers, the White Carneau also possess a unique cytoskeletal array of linear fluorescence, ie, the endothelial cell ridge. At 1 month of age, anti-actin staining of endothelial cell ridges averages 28.5 mu in length in the ascending aorta, 28.0 mu in the aortic arch, and 40.0 mu in the thoracic aorta. At the same time, anti-myosin fluorescence extends past both ends of the anti-actin-stained endothelial cell ridge fluorescence. In the ascending aorta, anti-myosin labeling of endothelial cell ridges is 3.5 times longer than anti-actin staining. This staining is absent in the aortic arch, whereas the thoracic aorta possesses endothelial cell ridges that extend over the entire length of the vessel segment. At 12 months of age, actin-stained endothelial cell ridges increase 1.6- and 1.4-fold in the ascending aorta and aortic arch, respectively. The thoracic aorta possesses endothelial cell ridges that cover its entire length. At 12 months of age, the length of myosin-stained endothelial cell ridges does not increase in the ascending or thoracic aorta. In contrast, the aortic arch expresses endothelial cell ridges that exceed 150 mu in length. It is proposed that the endothelial cell ridge assembles from cytoskeletal components as a focal endothelial cell response to injury, perhaps promoting endothelial cell adhesion to the underlying basal lamina through a transmembrane linkage.\r"

  ".W": "Certain inhaled toxicants are known to induce mucous hypersecretion in the respiratory epithelium. This secretory change may be a direct effect of the toxicant or an indirect effect of the concomitant inflammatory response. The present study was designed to determine by quantitative histochemistry whether the influx of neutrophils through the nasal respiratory epithelium would induce significant quantitative changes in the amount of intraepithelially stored mucosubstance. F344/N rats were intranasally instilled with endotoxin to elicit a transient influx of neutrophils into the nasal epithelium. Peak intraepithelial infiltration of neutrophils was evident 6 hours after instillation. There was a concurrent quantitative decrease in stored epithelial mucosubstance at the same time after instillation. Amounts of epithelial mucosubstance returned to that measured prior to neutrophil infiltration by 24 hours after instillation, when intraepithelial neutrophils were diminishing. Rats in which circulating neutrophils were sequestered in the lungs and prevented from migrating into endotoxin-exposed nasal epithelium had no change in the quantity of stored mucosubstance 6 hours after instillation. Therefore, it is concluded that a transepithelial migration of neutrophils elicits a transient depletion of stored mucosubstances in the nasal respiratory epithelium. Whether this is due to the release of secretagogues from the migrating leukocytes or another neutrophil-related method of stimulating mucous secretion is not known.\r"

Antioxidant enzyme activities were very different in cultured cells than in parent glomeruli. The possible effect of culture substrates (tissue culture plastic, bovine corneal endothelial [BCE] cell basement membrane, and PF-HR-9 endodermal cell basement membrane) on antioxidant enzyme status, cell morphology, and lipid peroxidation was also assessed. Glomerular epithelial cells cultured on the BCE cell basement membrane substrate survived longer and showed less lipid peroxidation than cells cultured on plastic or the HR-9 substrate. Cells cultured on a plastic substrate had substantially less glutathione peroxidase activity than cells cultured on either BCE or HR-9 basement membranes.\r"

  ".W": "Owing to large differences in the incidence of AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome) and in public health resources and priorities, the impact of AIDS on state and local health departments has been variable. Nonetheless, health departments everywhere are being held responsible for surveillance and control of the HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) epidemic which we believe requires, at minimum, convenient, free HIV testing and counseling; expanded HIV services in sexually transmitted diseases clinics and substance treatment centers; locally oriented AIDS information/education; notification of persons unknowingly exposed to HIV; restrictive measures for HIV-infected persons who, after counseling, persist in exposing others; regulation or closure of public establishments in which HIV transmission is likely to result; and confidential reporting of all HIV test results to public health departments. In Colorado new legislation was passed to require reporting of HIV test results, to provide the reports with near absolute protections against unauthorized disclosure, and to modify quarantine statues to incorporate rights to due process, appeals, and confidentially. States in which there is a legal basis for discrimination against gay men will need to rectify this problem first. There is no evidence that reporting of HIV infections in Colorado has adversely affected the rate at which persons with HIV risk behaviors volunteer to be tested. For Denver and Colorado Departments of Health, more than 70 per cent of the estimated $2,796,000 expended in AIDS activities during 1987 was federal.\r"

  ".W": "Current debates concerning appropriate policy to combat the epidemic of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) have raised critical questions regarding the role that schools of public health and individual public health professionals should play, if any, in AIDS-related policy analysis and social advocacy. In the summer of 1986, the School of Public Health at the University of California at Berkeley initiated a telegram sent by the Deans of all 23 schools of public health to protest US Department of Justice AIDS policy and, in the subsequent fall, the school expanded its public educational role in an unprecedented manner by initiating and issuing, with California's other three schools of public health, a policy analysis of Proposition 64, the LaRouche AIDS Quarantine Initiative. That analysis exposed the proposition's fallacious claims regarding casual transmission of AIDS and served to educate the electorate on the likely public health impact of this deleterious legislation. Based on these experiences, and in light of ongoing national controversy regarding AIDS, we believe schools of public health have an important role to play in policy analysis, and individual public health professionals have a role to play in social advocacy.\r"

  ".W": "Drug abuse treatment programs in six regions of the United States collaborated in a study aimed at monitoring trends in the seroprevalence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antibodies. The wide disparities in HIV seroprevalence in the face of similarities in drug using behavior have important implications for prevention. In the New York City area (Harlem, Brooklyn), 61 per cent of samples (N = 280) obtained in late 1986 were positive, up from 50 per cent of samples (N = 585) in early 1985. In Baltimore, Maryland, 29 per cent of samples (N = 184) representing 11 programs were positive. In contrast, samples from programs distant from the Northeast corridor had far lower rates: Denver, Colorado 5 per cent (N = 100); San Antonio, Texas 2 per cent (N = 106); Southern California, 1.5 per cent (N = 413); and Tampa, Florida, 0 per cent (N = 102). Contrary to expectations, there was no corresponding difference in reported lifetime needle sharing experiences, which ranged from 70 per cent in New York to 99 per cent in San Antonio. HIV seropositivity was associated only with geographic location and ethnicity; however, because needle sharing is practiced by parenteral drug abusers in areas where seroprevalence is still relatively low, these areas are potentially vulnerable to the same catastrophic spread seen in the Northeast. A window of opportunity exists where prompt, vigorous, and aggressive efforts at prevention could have major impact.\r"

Thirty-six per cent of medical and 17 per cent of pediatric house officers reported percutaneous exposures to needles contaminated with blood of AIDS patients. Forty-eight per cent of medical and 30 per cent of pediatric house officers reported a moderate to major concern about acquiring AIDS from their patients. Greater concern about personal risk was noted in those house officers who were earlier in their residency training, who reported having treated a greater number of AIDS patients, and who were in medicine rather than pediatrics programs. Twenty-five per cent of all respondents reported that they would not continue to care for AIDS patients if given a choice. The results demonstrate a substantial degree of concern about acquiring AIDS among house officers caring for AIDS patients and suggest the need for housestaff program administrators for formally address these concerns.\r"

  ".W": "Blood may provide superior cardioplegia compared with crystalloid cardioplegic solution. However, the results are controversial. This may be due to a leftward shift of the hemoglobin (Hb)-O2 dissociation curve induced by hypothermia, increasing the oxygen affinity for Hb. This effect may negate the potential benefit of blood cardioplegia. The oxygen affinity for Hb can be decreased by increasing the red cell 2,3-diphosphoglycerate (2,3-DPG), and hence, more oxygen can be delivered to the myocardium. The present investigation was undertaken to study the effects of 2,3-DPG-enriched blood cardioplegia on the functional recovery of the myocardium and changes in the coronary sinus red blood cell (RBC) adenosine-triphosphate (ATP), lactate, and RBC DPG after one and a half hours of reperfusion following one hour of ischemic cardiac arrest in dogs. The dogs were divided into three groups: crystalloid (CR); stored blood (SB), and high 2,3-DPG blood (HDPG) cardioplegic groups. Incubation of canine RBC in phosphoenal pyruvate (PEP) led to a 36% increase in DPG and a rightward shift in the Hb-O2 dissociation curve. There was a 4 mm Hg shift in the P50. When compared with the CR group, there was a significant decrease in the cardiac index (CI) and left ventricular work index (LVWI) and a significant increase in the total systemic vascular resistance (TSVR) in the SB group. The CI and LVWI of the HDPG group were similar to those of the CR group, but the TSVR was significantly greater in the former group. The LVWI was significantly greater and the TSVR smaller in the HDPG group as compared with those in the SB group.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Several workers have used histochemical, enzymatic, and fluorescent methods to diagnose early myocardial ischemia, but the problem of unequivocal detection of early ischemia still remains an enigma to pathologists. In the present study, the left coronary artery was ligated in an animal model, rat, in order to produce myocardial ischemia at different time intervals, from five minutes to six hours. Fluorescent techniques and tetrazolium staining of myocardial succinic dehydrogenases have been used to detect onset of ischemia with the purpose of identifying a sensitive technique for use in routine pathologic specimens. Nitroso-blue tetrazolium and triphenyl tetrazolium chloride staining of myocardium showed loss of dehydrogenases within five to twenty minutes of ligation of the coronary artery. This loss was consistent and progressively increased at longer time intervals, the mean ischemic area mapped being 25.74 mm2 and 66.87 mm2 at five to twenty minutes and six hours respectively. Such comparison of ischemic area of myocardium at different time intervals has not been reported earlier. Autofluorescence in formalin-fixed, hematoxylin and eosin-stained sections showed positive fluorescence only after fifty to seventy-five minutes of ischemia and was patchy in distribution in the left ventricular wall even up to six hours of ligation. Examination of myocardium under fluorescent light after acridine orange staining proved to be more sensitive than autofluorescence for detecting ischemia. At five to twenty minutes, the mean ischemic area was 18.67 mm2 and by six hours it increased to 27.48 mm2.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In the acute stage of the illness, the coronary arteries were evaluated for aneurysms by two-dimensional echocardiography. After the acute stage of the illness, selective coronary cineangiographies were performed by Seldinger's method under general anesthesia before and after intravenous administration of 0.6 mg/kg of dipyridamole for four minutes. The calibers of aneurysms and normal appearing segments of coronary arteries, at most 7 segments in 1 patient, were measured before and after dipyridamole administration on the high-quality cineangioanalyzer and percentages of coronary arterial dilatation were calculated. In 14 cases without evidence of coronary arterial lesions, the distensibility was 10.2 +/- 4.7% (mean +/- SD). The distensibility of 32 aneurysms in 16 cases was 0.6 +/- 1.1% and was significantly decreased (p less than 0.001). In 24 cases with coronary arterial lesions, aneurysms, stenosis, or obstruction, the distensibility of normal appearing segments of coronary arteries was 4.5 +/- 4.9% and was significantly decreased (p less than 0.001). This method is useful in evaluating distensibility and appears to be effective in detecting pathologic changes of the coronary arterial wall, even if it appears normal in shape. The patient with previously diseased coronary arteries should be kept under careful longterm surveillance.\r"

  ".W": "A pneumatic massage apparatus has been developed for the treatment of peripheral lymphedema. The stagnant lymph and venous blood are displaced toward the heart by this pneumatic massage. It has been applied to more than 650 patients with edematous limbs in the authors' Hadomer clinic over the last ten years. Satisfactory results were obtained, including decrease in swelling, pain, and induration. The authors' clinical experiences and statistical analysis of the patients are reported here. Statistical analysis: 9 primary (4 males and 5 females) and 646 secondary (28 males and 618 females) patients with lymphatic edema of extremities have been treated. The majority of the patients had postmastectomy edema of the upper extremity. Clinical studies: The circumference of the edematous limb was measured before and after pneumatic massage treatment of forty to sixty minutes, daily or every second day. (Formula: see text). The rate of swelling was calculated by the formula described above. Twenty-six cases, treated with pneumatic massage for more than fifteen months, have been investigated. A decrease in the rate of swelling was observed in 14 cases (54%), there was no change in 7 (27%), and an increase was seen in 5 (19%). Electric impedance plethysmographic analysis of peripheral lymph volume and blood flow indicated that pneumatic massage was effective in the treatment of edema of the limbs, and its effectiveness was confirmed also by core temperature measurement of the hand during pneumatic massage. The decreased circumference of the edematous limb was kept constant for a long period of time by daily repeated pneumatic massage and ordinary conservative treatments. In conclusion, most lymphedema is of a secondary type. Pneumatic massage was effective in the treatment of peripheral lymph edema, and the improvement was maintained by repeated daily pneumatic massage and ordinary conservative treatment. Therefore, before it becomes worse, lymphedema of the limb should be treated by use of conservative treatments, including pneumatic massage continued as a long-term schedule.\r"

Restenosis of the graft due to neointimal hyperplasia was subsequently treated by PTA, with resultant long-term patency. This approach is an attractive alternative to surgical thrombectomy and graft revision, especially in patients who are poor surgical risks owing to concurrent medical problems.\r"

Urokinase is emerging as a safer and more effective thrombolytic agent when applied either to definitively lyse spontaneous thrombosis where no underlying structural lesion is present or to serve as an adjunct prior to surgical reconstruction or transluminal angioplasty. The authors report a case of a high-risk cardiac patient in whom an embolic occlusion of the distal popliteal artery was completely recanalized by using a localized catheter infusion of urokinase. The source of the embolus was a left ventricular thrombus. No serious bleeding or proximal or distal embolic complications occurred. The potential hazards of fragmentation of the embolic source in the presence of systemic thrombolysis, distal trifurcation embolization, and concomitant use of heparin are reviewed.\r"

He died of hemorrhage of the liver on the third postoperative day. Autopsy revealed a congenital fibrotic obstruction of all suprahepatic veins, with a wide, round ligament containing a functional umbilical vein, which had been routinely ligated during surgery. An extensive review of the literature showed no similar report. The authors speculate that the inadvertent interruption of the round ligament, which until then had served as a pathway for venous draining of the liver, followed by ligation of the anastomoses between the portal and azygous systems, was the factor that triggered the lethal outcome. Thus, this appears to be the first case of congenital Budd-Chiari syndrome predominantly maintained at the expense of the round ligament of the liver, with a patent vascular branch.\r"

During the week following each treatment, every patient recorded his or her subjective response on a daily symptom score card. Nasal patency was determined before and after each treatment by measuring peak nasal inspiratory and expiratory air flow and by measuring the area covered with vapor formed by the exhaled air on a plate. Highly reproducible results were obtained by using these three objective methods. Inhalation of humidified warm air resulted in amelioration of allergic rhinitis symptoms and in increased nasal patency in a high proportion of patients. There were no adverse side effects. This form of therapy seemed effective in the 2-week period in which it was used and would be an additional form of therapy available for those suffering discomfort from allergic rhinitis.\r"

Thirty one patients (1.2%) suffered deficits that were permanent while 25 patients (0.9%) cleared to be discharged normal. In the last 5 years of the study, an aggressive approach was taken in cases where the patient was noted to have a postoperative neurologic change. It is routine to allow the patient to awaken in the operating room and to perform a simple neurologic examination prior to transport to the recovery room. If a neurologic change occurs during the postoperative period, immediate exploration is undertaken without preliminary testing. With this policy, 20 patients underwent exploration of the operated carotid artery and six of these patients recovered completely. To reduce the stroke rate from carotid endarterectomy (CE), technical errors must be kept to a minimum. Prevention of hypoperfusion with a shunt and careful mobilization of the artery to prevent microembolization should be practiced. Postoperative thrombosis can be decreased by the routine use of platelet antiaggregates and the avoidance of perioperative hypotension. Reperfusion of injury can be minimized by control of postoperative hypertension and proper preoperative selection of patients. Postoperative neurologic deficit following CE remains a relatively rare event and consequently sufficient experience in the treatment of this problem is difficult to acquire.\r"

In an effort to overcome these problems, a collagen-impregnated double-velour knitted Dacron graft has been developed. This graft is impervious to blood, does not require preclotting, and maintains its pliability. During a 2 and one half year period, 590 of these grafts have been used at our institution for abdominal aortic replacement in both emergent and elective cases. Indications have included aneurysmal disease (67%), occlusive disease (30%), and failed previous aortic graft (3%). A bifurcated graft has been used in most cases (68%). The patient population has included 449 men and 141 women. Their median age is 68 years, with a range from 15 to 91 years. Seventy nine per cent of the patients experienced no perioperative complications. The remaining twenty one per cent have had a variety of complications, most of them cardiac or pulmonary, but none related directly to the graft. Twenty nine patients died in the perioperative period, for a mortality of 4.9 per cent. Late complications have been infrequent and in no cases directly related to the graft. There have been no graft-related late deaths. It is concluded that, at least in this early experience, there are no problems inherent in the use of this graft. Its pliability and the fact that it does not require preclotting are distinct advantages over previous Dacron grafts.\r"

Complications, including asymptomatic loss of pedal pulse, vascular-symptomatic, infection, or balloon rupture occurred in 22.8 per cent of patients. Of the 54 complications, 13 (24%) were asymptomatic loss of pedal pulse, 36 (66.7%) were vascular symptomatic, three (5.5%) were infection, and two (3.7%) were balloon malfunctions. The overall complication rates were 16/103 (15.5%) and 38/99 (38.3%) for the surgical and percutaneous methods, respectively (P = 0.007). Thirty two per cent (33/103) of the patients receiving IABP surgically and 24 per cent (24/99) of those receiving IABP percutaneously died in the hospital (P = 0.34); no death was directly attributable to IABP. The number of patients requiring surgical intervention or removal was not significantly different between the surgical and percutaneous methods (9 versus 18%, P = .06). While the method of IABP insertion did not significantly alter hospital mortality, a significantly greater complication rate was observed with percutaneous insertion (P = .007). This was particularly relevant to complications occurring at the time of removal of IABP.\r"

Two cases are reported where the etiology of profound early postoperative ischemia and graft failure were not due to technical aspects of graft reconstruction itself but rather to vascular clamp injury to a severely atherosclerotic common femoral artery with early postoperative common femoral artery, profunda femoris artery and graft thrombosis. This event requires immediate recognition and common femoral artery reconstruction for limb salvage.\r"

More recently Berne et al. applied this procedure to treat patients with complex pancreaticoduodenal trauma and modified it to include antrectomy with Billroth II reconstruction and tube duodenostomy. Over time the indications for duodenal exclusion have gradually been expanded to include management of actual or anticipated duodenal fistulas arising from operative injury or as a complication of inflammatory or neoplastic diseases. Our recent success using duodenal exclusion and/or diverticularization to manage one patient with duodenal trauma and two patients with nontraumatic forms of duodenal injury resulting in lateral duodenal fistulas caused us to reevaluate the efficacy of this procedure and forms the basis for this report.\r"

The patient had symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux for many years and Barrett's esophagus beginning 21 cm from the incisor teeth was documented by endoscopy one year earlier. Hospitalization was necessitated by an upper gastrointestinal bleed which was found to be due to an ulcer at 29 cm from the incisors. There was no inflammation of the surrounding columnar epithelium nor was there any esophagitis within the squamous epithelium. This case documents that ulcers in Barrett's esophagus can arise de novo within the columnar epithelium despite the hypothesis that this epithelium is present because it is more resistant to acid/peptic damage than squamous epithelium. This suggests that some ulcers in Barrett's epithelium may be due to spontaneous degeneration of the epithelium as this patient had no esophagitis, suggesting that gastroesophageal reflux was not causing diffuse damage.\r"

DESIGN: Nonrandomized prospective clinical trial of chemotherapy in a cohort of patients with advanced seminoma. SETTING: Referral cancer hospital. PATIENTS: Consecutive sample of 62 patients with primary extragonadal, stage IIC (greater than 5-cm retroperitoneal adenopathy) and stage III seminoma; 45 patients were previously untreated, 13 had received radiotherapy, and 4 had previously received radiotherapy and chemotherapy. INTERVENTION: Cisplatin-based chemotherapy (100 to 120 mg/m2 body surface area per cycle of treatment); 45 patients received vinblastine, bleomycin, cisplatin, dactinomycin, and cyclophosphamide; 15, etoposide and cisplatin; and 2, both regimens. MEASUREMENTS and MAIN RESULTS: Fifty-three of the sixty (88%) evaluable patients achieved a complete remission, and only 6 patients had relapses. Fifty-three of the sixty-two patients (85%) remain alive and disease-free. The regimen of etoposide and cisplatin was equivalent to regimens using more drugs. An elevated level of human chorionic gonadotropin at the initiation of treatment was associated with a worse prognosis. CONCLUSIONS: Cisplatin-based chemotherapy is effective treatment for patients with extragonadal, stage IIC, and stage III seminoma and should be considered as initial therapy.\r"

DESIGN: Survey, with hormone levels measured weekly for 1 month and patients followed clinically for 6 months. SETTING: Volunteers were recruited through media advertisements and fliers. PARTICIPANTS: Ninety-two women were enrolled; 71 (77%) completed the study. Subjects were grouped by menstrual and activity histories reported by a self-administered questionnaire. After 6 months, final groups were assigned: amenorrheic athletes, 19; eumenorrheic athletes, 35; a transition group of amenorrheic athletes who had resumed menses after entering the study, 7; and normal cyclic nonathletes, 10. INTERVENTIONS: Four weekly resting blood samples (0800 to 1000 hours) were obtained and measured for cortisol, estradiol, progesterone, and prolactin levels. Lumbar bone mineral density was measured by dual-photon densitometry. MEASUREMENTS and MAIN RESULTS: Mean (+/- SE) cortisol levels were higher in amenorrheic athletes (585 +/- 33 nmol/L) than in eumenorrheic athletes (411 +/- 14 nmol/L), transition athletes (378 +/- 33 nmol/L), or nonathletic women (397 +/- 30 nmol/L) (P less than 0.01). Of nine women with abnormally high cortisol levels (greater than 579 nmol/L), eight were amenorrheic athletes, and one was a eumenorrheic athlete. Bone mineral density was lower in amenorrheic athletes than in the other three groups (P less than 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Increased glucocorticoid levels may be an etiologic factor in exercise-associated amenorrhea. High cortisol levels could also contribute to decreased bone density. The failure of amenorrheic athletes with hypercortisolemia to regain menses within 6 months suggests that they are at risk for a prolonged acyclic state.\r"

Multiple isolates obtained from each patient had the same biochemical and serotypic characteristics, indicating recurrent infection rather than reinfection with unrelated strains. Serum antibody responses to C. jejuni group antigens by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay were markedly impaired in the three patients with persistent infection compared with forty-two immunocompetent C. jejuni-infected controls and with the HIV-infected patient who readily cleared the organism. One patient was bacteremic; his blood isolate was killed by normal serum but was resistant to his own serum, whereas a simultaneous stool isolate of a different serotype was sensitive. Failure of two patients to eradicate the organism and long-term administration of erythromycin therapy led to the in-vivo development of resistance to this antibiotic, which is most frequently used to treat C. jejuni infections.\r"

We studied the basic mechanism of clogging to find ways to prevent it. We did light and electron microscopy studies of blocked and functioning stents, which were prepared so that organic structures would be preserved. The material blocking the lumina was composed of a matrix of bacterial cells and their fibrillar anionic extracellular products. Crystals of calcium bilirubinate, calcium palmitate, and cholesterol were embedded within this matrix. Bacterial cells were attached to the stent surface by a fibrillar matrix, suggesting that the initial event in stent clogging is the development of an adherent bacterial biofilm. Bacterial enzyme activity (beta-glucuronidase and phospholipase) leads to the deposition of crystals. The use of antibacterial plastics in the manufacture of stents may reduce bacterial adhesion and stent clogging.\r"

DESIGN: Prospective, consecutive case series before and after balloon valvuloplasty. SETTING: Referral center hospital and cardiac catheterization laboratory. PATIENTS: Consecutive sample of 32 patients having balloon valvuloplasty for critical symptomatic stenosis of the mitral or aortic valve. Twenty-six patients had aortic stenosis; 6 had mitral stenosis. INTERVENTION: Computed tomography of the head, funduscopy, and electrocardiography were done in all patients before and after valvuloplasty. Cardiac isoenzymes were measured serially in 19 patients. MEASUREMENTS and MAIN RESULTS: Previous cerebral infarction was seen in nine patients, with three showing a new abnormality after aortic valvuloplasty. In one of these patients a funduscopic hemorrhage was detected by photography. Total creatinine kinase and MB fraction were elevated in 1 of 19 patients. Serial electrocardiograms were unchanged in all patients. CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of cerebral neurologic events and myocardial injury are acceptably low after balloon valvuloplasty of calcific aortic and mitral stenosis. Both episodes of symptomatic cerebral infarction occurred in patients with apparent bicuspid aortic valvular stenosis, suggesting that calcific bicuspid aortic stenosis may be associated with more neurologic events after aortic valvuloplasty.\r"

We sought to describe how patients have contended with this awkward step, to study artifact caused by toilet water, and to construct a collection device that prevents sampling problems. A survey of 250 patients showed that most (56%) had retrieved stools from the toilet basin, 17% used a pan or other household receptacle, 10% used newspaper or tissue paper, and 17% had been unable or unwilling. Sampling stool from the toilet basin introduces error because 4% to 75% of blood leaches from the fecal surface into surrounding water after only 4 to 12 minutes, and many toilet sanitizers cause false-positive guaiac reactions. We describe an inexpensive, disposable stool collector; outpatient compliance has been 97% using this device. To avoid biochemical artifact and facilitate stool sampling, we advocate that a collection device be incorporated into the occult blood testing process.\r"

More important, SIV and HIV are both primate lentiviruses that cause transmissible immunodeficiency and encephalitis, with an apparently increased virulence in the immature host. The neuropathological features in common between SIV encephalitis in juvenile macaque monkeys and HIV encephalitis in children include the invasion of brain with virus-laden macrophages, the formation of multinucleated (syncytial) giant cells, and white matter lesions and subtle white matter astrocytosis. Important differences include giant cell leptomeningitis and evidence of necrosis and karyorrhexis in brain macrophage infiltrates in SIV-infected monkeys. These changes probably represent a more acute inflammatory process. The importance of future studies to define pathogenetic features of SIV encephalitis, using molecularly characterized isolates with varying neurovirulence and host range, are emphasized.\r"

Patients' signs, symptoms, and radiographic studies are not specific for this lesion; brain biopsy usually is necessary to make a definitive diagnosis. Most tumors are high-grade lymphomas and are pathologically similar to the primary central nervous system lymphomas observed before the AIDS epidemic. AIDS-associated tumors respond readily to radiation therapy. However, patient survival remains limited owing to other manifestations of the syndrome.\r"

These include clearer definition of the clinical syndrome and its variants; development of instrumentation for diagnosis and monitoring the disorder; definition of the epidemiology and natural history of both central nervous system HIV infection and ADC, which may seemingly be discordant; and understanding of both the viral pathogenesis and the biology of resultant brain dysfunction.

Only 1 had acquired immunodeficiency syndrome-related complex, and none had the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome when initially studied. There was a high rate of cerebrospinal fluid abnormalities in men with neuropsychiatric findings, including pleocytosis (41%), elevated IgG and IgG index (47%), and oligoclonal bands (18%). Even in the absence of neuropsychiatric findings, the asymptomatic HIV-seropositive subjects frequently had spinal fluid abnormalities. Of those with neuropsychiatric findings, HIV p24 antigen was detectable in cerebrospinal fluid in only 1 individual, yet HIV was isolated in 11 of 16 (69%) compared to 2 of 7 (29%) of those without neuropsychiatric findings. The identification of cerebrospinal fluid abnormalities in individuals known to have become infected within 6 to 24 months supports the hypothesis that the nervous system is an early target for HIV.\r"

Whether brain disease related to this virus will respond to antiretroviral drugs will be a major focus of future research.

Acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy, sensory ganglioneuritis, and acute cranial nerve palsy all may occur 2 to 3 weeks after acute HIV infection. Acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy, chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy, and polyradiculopathy may occur with otherwise asymptomatic HIV virus infection. Neuropathy is one of the most common neurological manifestations of the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)-related complex, occurring in as many as 20% of these patients. Acute or chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (38%) and mononeuropathy multiplex (29%) are most frequently seen, and usually there is a good prognosis, with the neuropathy resolving spontaneously or with steroids or plasmapheresis. Neuropathy occurring with AIDS is reportedly uncommon but probably is underreported, especially in seriously ill patients. By contrast with AIDS-related complex, the neuropathy associated with AIDS is usually a distal symmetrical polyneuropathy (72%), with inflammatory neuropathy, mononeuropathy multiplex, and polyradiculopathy occurring rarely. The pathogenesis of acute or chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy and possibly of mononeuropathy multiplex is probably autoimmune. The pathogenesis of distal symmetrical polyneuropathy is less clearly established and may be infectious, toxic, or nutritional. Polyradiculopathy most likely is infectious; cytomegalovirus is a leading contender for infectious agent, but herpes simplex virus and HIV are other possibilities.\r"

The HIV-IBR LTR showed marked homology with the LTR sequences of the other HIV-I isolates. The predicted amino acid sequence of the external glycoprotein (gp120) of HIV-IBR revealed a pattern of conserved and variable regions similar to that of other HIV isolates.

During these interactions, both direct effects from HIV-I infection of brain cells as well as indirect mechanisms (namely the response of brain cells to the presence of virus-infected cells, particularly monocytes and macrophages) should be considered. In addition, the genomic variability of HIV-I could play a role in increasing the tropism of the virus for certain cell types.\r"

The enzyme from Citrobacter freundii IID976 was purified by affinity chromatography on novobiocin-Sepharose and heparin-Sepharose. It had two subunits, designated A and B, which closely resembled those of the enzyme from Escherichia coli and Micrococcus luteus in enzymatic requirements. The inhibitory effects of the quinolones on the supercoiling activities of the enzyme correlated with their antibacterial activities. New quinolones were better inhibitors of DNA gyrase than nalidixic acid and pipemidic acid. We also purified DNA gyrase from a spontaneous nalidixic acid-resistant mutant (M2-5). The gyrases from IID976 and M2-5 were defined as mixtures of subunits As+Bs (s, susceptible) and Ar+Br (r, resistant), respectively. The supercoiling activities of reconstituted Ar+Br and Ar+Bs were more resistant to quinolones than As+Bs and As+Br. These findings indicate that one mechanism of C. freundii resistance against quinolones is resistance modification of the A subunit protein.\r"

A marked synergism between DHMP A and INH was demonstrated by the checkerboard technique against M. tuberculosis, M. intracellulare, and M. smegmatis, and the synergistic effect was observed by treatment of the culture of M. smegmatis with DHMP A for at least 3 h prior to treatment with INH. It was also shown that both absorption and excretion of INH in mice were faster than those of DHMP A. On the basis of these results, combination therapy with DHMP A and INH was successfully carried out in experimental tuberculosis in mice infected with M. bovis Ravenel. After a single intravenous administration of 10 mg of DHMP A per kg, its half-life in serum in mice was about 0.5 h and in dogs it was 5.5 h. A single oral administration to dogs of 12.5 mg/kg gave a peak of 5.0 micrograms/ml at 3 h. In these experiments, urinary recoveries within 48 h were 21.0% in mice and 25.2% in dogs. The tissue distribution level of DHMP A in mice after oral administration was in the order of liver greater than kidney greater than serum greater than spleen = lung. The 50% lethal doses of DHMP A for mice were more than 6,000 mg/kg orally and 1,840 mg/kg intraperitoneally.\r"

After single or 3-day treatments, ribavirin rapidly accumulated in the lungs at concentrations sufficient to inhibit influenza virus or respiratory syncytial virus (1 to 5 mM). While peak levels of ribavirin in the lungs after the high-dose administration were about three times those found with the standard dose, ribavirin was rapidly cleared from the lungs. There was no accumulation of drug in the lungs after multiple treatments. Ribavirin cleared from the lungs was detected in the blood within 15 min. Concentrations in the serum were similar (20 to 30 microM) for standard- and high-dose treatments with either single or multiple treatments. Ribavirin clearance from the serum after treatment was similar for each regimen. Ribavirin also rapidly accumulated in the brain to a similar level (ca. 6 nmol per brain) after standard- or high-dose treatment for 3 days. In contrast to ribavirin in the serum, ribavirin in the brain appeared to be slowly cleared, allowing levels to remain relatively constant during and after treatment. With the interest in viral encephalopathies, further evaluation of the possible advantages of this method of drug administration is warranted.\r"

A general feature of slow accumulation and elimination of drugs from extravascular sites having low surface area/volume ratios has also been observed in this study. The capsular concentration-time profiles were well expressed by the following equation: C(CF) = A(CF)[e-kel(CF)(t-to)-e-kp(CF)(t-to)], where C(CF), A(CF), kp(CF), kel(CF), and to indicate capsular concentration at time t, constant for the dimension of concentration, capsule penetration rate constant, capsule elimination rate constant, and lag time before penetration occurs, respectively. The kp(CF), kel(CF), and to were 0.139 h-1, 0.059 h-1, and 0.45 h, respectively, for cefpiramide, and 0.448 h-1, 0.0145 h-1, and 0.14 h, respectively, for cefazolin. A(CF) was 22.7 micrograms/ml for cefpiramide and 4.53 micrograms/ml for cefazolin, being parallel to the area under the plasma concentration-time curve for free drug from to to infinity (20.1 micrograms.h/ml for cefpiramide and 3.43 micrograms.h/ml for cefazolin). In conclusion, it is suggested that as well as kp(CF) and kel(CF), the area under the plasma concentration-time curve for free drug from to to infinity may play an important role regarding the circulating reservoir of drugs in determining capsular concentration-time profiles in experimental models for particular extravascular sites of infection, like abscesses into which drugs cannot easily penetrate.\r"

Because of the need to design optimal dosing regimens in experimental models of ovine and murine septicemia, the pharmacokinetic profile of lipid X was investigated in sheep and in two strains of mice by using 32P-labeled lipid X. In sheep, peak whole blood lipid X levels after a bolus injection of 100 micrograms of lipid X per kg were 900 ng/ml. An initial rapid distribution phase of 7.98 +/- 0.1 min was observed, followed by a prolonged elimination phase of 3.0 +/- 0.5 h; the area under the curve from time zero to infinity was 428 +/- 27 ng.h/ml. The serum half-lives of lipid X were slightly shorter than whole blood half-lives, suggesting that lipid X associates with cellular elements. Metabolites of lipid X could not be detected in serum over a 4-h period. Lipid X appears to accumulate mainly in the liver, and the tissue distribution of lipid X resembles that of lipopolysaccharide. The elimination rate of lipid X in mice was approximately four times as rapid as that seen in sheep. Lipid X pharmacokinetics in lipopolysaccharide-sensitive DBA/2J mice were virtually identical with those seen in endotoxin-resistant C3H/HeJ mice. The pharmacokinetics described here should greatly aid in the design and interpretation of animal studies investigating the therapeutic applications of lipid X in gram-negative septicemia.\r"

Fourteen male volunteers participated in an open, three-way crossover study of Latin Square design with a 1-week washout period between phases. On days 1 and 7 of each phase, serial serum samples and urine were collected for drug assay over a 12-h period. Hematological and clinical chemistry determinations were made within 10 days before the first antibiotic dose and for each treatment phase just before the first dose, on day 4 of treatment, and within 24 h of the last dose. For cefoperazone as a single agent on days 1 and 7, the average maximal concentration in serum (Cmax) was approximately 430 micrograms/ml, the terminal elimination half-life (t1/2) was 1.8 h, and the average percentage of dose excreted unchanged in the urine (%Ur) was 30%. For sulbactam as a single agent, the Cmax was approximately 90 micrograms/ml, the t1/2 was 1 h, and the %Ur was 89% on days 1 and 7. When comparing individual versus simultaneous drug administration, the only pharmacokinetic alteration observed was a statistically significant but minor (about 10%) decrease in sulbactam renal clearance, on both days 1 and 7, resulting in a similar decrease in total body clearance (CL). The area under the curve, apparent volume of distribution by the area method (V), t1/2, and Cmax were not significantly altered.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The first study was conducted during a period of transmission of type A (H1N1) and type B influenza. At 2.5 x 10(6) IU per day, no effect on influenza infection could be detected, but there appeared to be an effect on rhinovirus isolation. During the subsequent autumn 1.7 x 10(6) IU per day was found to have only a minimal effect on rhinovirus infection (efficacy from 22 to 27%). Under similar circumstances the preceding year, but with a daily dose of 3.0 x 10(6) IU, efficacy had been 76%. Since there was no evidence of change in rhinovirus strains circulating or their interferon susceptibility, this represented a dose-response relationship. It was possible to evaluate side effects in the 1,200 individuals involved. A lower dose was associated with lower frequency of symptoms of blood-tinged mucus. Persons using a placebo spray had a higher frequency of this side effect than an observed control. Using the spray 5 days a week was no less likely to produce symptoms than everyday use. Once-daily use was less likely to produce side effects than twice-daily use. There was no indication of sensitization when interferon was used for two separate periods of 4 weeks.\r"

In addition, the pharmacodynamic profile of this combination was determined by the use of mean bactericidal titers against selected bacterial strains. Six noninfected CAPD patients were given a fixed dose of cefoperazone (2 g) and sulbactam (1 g) either intravenously or intraperitoneally over 10 min in a randomized, two-way crossover fashion. The mean peak cefoperazone concentration in serum after intravenous administration was 280.9 micrograms/ml. The mean peak concentration in serum after intraperitoneal cefoperazone administration was 38.9 micrograms/ml and occurred 2 to 4 h postdose. The mean peak sulbactam concentration in serum after intravenous administration was 82.2 micrograms/ml. The mean peak concentration in serum after intraperitoneal sulbactam administration was 24.4 micrograms/ml and occurred at 6 h. The absolute bioavailability of the intraperitoneal dose was 61% for cefoperazone and 70% for sulbactam. Cefoperazone total body and renal clearances were unaffected by renal failure and dialysis. However, both clearance values for sulbactam were reduced markedly. Only intraperitoneal dosing provided peak inhibitory and bactericidal titers in dialysate for all organisms tested. Intravenous dosing provided satisfactory dialysate titers only for very susceptible bacterial strains. End-stage renal disease and CAPD do not alter cefoperazone pharmacokinetics; however, sulbactam dosing may need to be adjusted.\r"

For the first strain, which was highly susceptible to methicillin and cephalosporins, vegetations grew S. epidermidis for all 15 untreated rabbits compared with 1 of 20 rabbits receiving cefazolin, 3 of 20 receiving cefamandole, none of 20 receiving vancomycin, and none of 20 receiving LY146032. For the second strain, which was methicillin resistant but cephalosporin susceptible, vegetations were positive for 14 of 15 untreated controls, 4 of 20 receiving cefazolin, 5 of 22 receiving cefamandole, none of 20 receiving vancomycin, and none of 20 receiving LY146032. For the third strain, which was methicillin resistant and only intermediately susceptible to cephalosporin antibiotics, vegetation cultures were positive for 15 of 17 untreated controls, 14 of 21 receiving cefazolin, 11 of 20 receiving cefamandole, 5 of 20 receiving vancomycin, and 0 of 22 receiving LY146032. In conclusion, these studies in the endocarditis model indicate that cefazolin and cefamandole have some protective value against certain strains of S. epidermidis. Vancomycin and LY146032, however, were more active than cephalosporins for all three strains included in this analysis. These findings support the need for trials of vancomycin and LY146032 prophylaxis in patients undergoing placement of prosthetic heart valves.\r"

  ".W": "The effect of a multiple-dose regimen of oral ciprofloxacin (750 mg every 12 h for 11 doses) on the clearance and steady-state concentrations of theophylline in trough (predose) serum was evaluated in nine healthy male subjects, each serving as his own control. Theophylline was taken as a sustained release tablet per os in a dose of 200 mg every 12 h for 19 doses. Theophylline concentrations in serum were measured immediately before each theophylline dose. Ciprofloxacin was administered on study day 4 through the first dose of study day 8. Theophylline concentrations in serum were also measured on study days 3, 6, 8, and 10 at the following times after the first dose of each day: 0, 0.25, 0.50, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 h. Steady-state theophylline concentrations in trough serum were significantly higher during ciprofloxacin treatment (day 8) than before (day 3) or after (day 10) ciprofloxacin administration (P less than 0.01). Likewise, theophylline clearance was significantly slower (P less than 0.01) during ciprofloxacin treatment (day 8) than before it (day 3) or after it (day 10). The magnitude of ciprofloxacin-induced changes was approximately 30%. These results suggest that a multidose regimen of ciprofloxacin significantly slows the clearance of theophylline and elevates theophylline concentrations in serum.\r"

In vitro antibiotic susceptibility testing of eight strains with a Schaedler broth dilution technique revealed DF-2 to be susceptible to all of the antibiotics tested except aztreonam. Previous reports that DF-2 is aminoglycoside resistant were based on disk diffusion or agar dilution assays that may be less reliable given the slow growth of the organism and its requirement for CO2 incubation. Penicillin is commonly used as prophylaxis after dog bites and has excellent activity against DF-2.\r"

Of the group with PVL, 25 had the appearances of prolonged flare without cavitation. Prospective assessments of up to 50 potential clinical risk factors were made wherever possible on each infant including stratification of all blood gas and systolic blood pressure data. Multivariate logistic regression analyses confirmed a strong correlation between immaturity and PVH but this was not found in cases of PVL. Independent variables associated with PVL included pneumothorax, maximum bilirubin concentration, surgery, and the proportion of time the infant's PaCO2 remained above 7 kPa. There was a very strong inverse correlation between anaemia and PVL. Systolic blood pressure data were carefully analysed and there was no relation between either hypotension or antepartum haemorrhage and the development of PVL.\r"

Evidence from the five centres suggested that hospital staff have little influence on a mother's choice of feeding method. The major differences between the populations of babies whose mothers do or do not choose to provide milk, raise important issues concerning the interpretation of data from non-randomised clinical trials of feeding premature infants.\r"

Twelve patients, at onset of clinical diabetes, presented with an asymptomatic glycosuria, 13 with ketosis, and four with ketoacidosis. All were diagnosed after 1979, at a mean age of 17 years. Mean age at diagnosis of diabetes was lower in patients born in the last two decades. In these patients transfusions were started at a younger age and pre-transfusion haemoglobin concentration, serum ferritin concentration, incidence of liver disease, and the presence of a family history of diabetes were higher than in patients born previously. Although 27 (93%) cases had iron chelating treatment the mean serum ferritin concentration was 5600 micrograms/l; 25 (92%) of these patients had signs of liver impairment. The determination of C peptide in 10 patients showed a wide variation in pancreatic beta cell function, and insulin requirements ranged between 0.15 and 1.72 U/kg body weight. Metabolic control was generally poor. The onset of diabetes mellitus was followed in most patients by the appearance of other endocrine or cardiac complications, or both. Fourteen patients died within three years of presenting with overt diabetes. Haemosiderosis, liver infections, and genetic factors seemed to be crucial in diabetes development. Thalassaemic patients developing clinical diabetes mellitus are at high risk for other complications and should be strictly monitored, especially for thyroid impairment.\r"

In order to minimise any stress factors no other procedures--for example, taking of blood specimens--were performed during the duration of the tests, which were carried out in a relatively dust free room with no curtains and minimal furniture. Fifteen non-asthmatic children acted as controls. The results showed a significant drop in the PEFR readings in the supine position in asthmatic children compared with the controls; this reverted back to baseline levels on assuming an upright posture at the end of the test without any medication. It is concluded that airflow obstruction can be induced by supine posture per se in asthmatic children; this may be a major factor contributing to nocturnal wheeze or cough.\r"

The glands were composed of well formed lobules surrounded by dense interlobular stroma, while within the lobules there was looser connective tissue. The lobules contained ducts, many of which were dilated and contained secretions. Foci of extramedullary haematopoiesis were found, and in the older infants, fat was prominent within the connective tissue of the breast. Myoepithelial cells were regularly present. No sex differences in breast development at this time were noted. Newborn breast development did not regress rapidly after birth and secretory activity continued for many months in both sexes. This study shows that the human mammary gland remains active for many months after birth and may continue to grow and secrete. The findings are not consistent with the current view that breast development in infancy results from stimulation from 'pregnancy hormones.' It is more likely that the infant's own gonadal secretions are responsible.\r"

The activities of lipoprotein and hepatic lipase in plasma taken 15 minutes after a heparin bolus of 100 IU/kg had been given and the concentrations of carnitine in serum and urine were measured. The mean gestational age was 31 weeks (range 26-35 weeks) and birth weight 1580 g (range 840-2280 g). Thirteen infants weighed under 1500 g at birth (very low birth weight), 20 were of appropriate weight for gestational age and six were small for gestational age. Lipoprotein lipase activity was higher in the preterm infants of appropriate weight than in the infants of very low birth weight and those who were small for gestational age. At the age of 2 or 7 days the activity of lipoprotein lipase in the preterm infants (mean (SEM) 46.2 (4.3) mumol free fatty acid/ml/hour) was, however, higher than in term infants and adults. Multivariate regression analyses showed that weight and relative birth weight together explained 58% of the variance of lipoprotein lipase activity but only 3% of the variance of hepatic lipase activity. Serum carnitine concentration was lower in the preterm infants than in term infants. Urinary excretion of carnitine increased progressively with age but was independent of serum concentration and carnitine intake.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

This latter form of malignant phenylketonuria, whose relative frequency seems to be higher in the Italian population, possibly has a worse prognosis. The earlier onset and the greater severity of clinical symptoms are associated with a more pronounced hydroxylation defect, as shown by higher degree of neonatal hyperphenylalaninaemia, unresponsiveness to an oral tetrahydrobiopterin load, lower concentrations of neurotransmitter metabolites, and reduced tyrosine production after an oral phenylalanine load.\r"

Seven joints were evaluated for mobility, and each infant underwent a physical and neurological examination. Parents were given a Denver Developmental Parents' Questionnaire. All subjects with a general developmental delay, systemic illness or syndrome were excluded. The infants were classified as having normal or delayed motor development with normal or delayed joint mobility. They were re-examined six months later. Multivariate statistical techniques was used for categorical analysis, and three joints were found to be significantly associated with motor delay at the first examination--hip abduction, elbow hyperextension, and foot dorsiflexion. Of the 715 infants, 126 had joint hypermobility and of these 38 (30.2%) had motor delay. Sixty four of 589 (10.9%) with normal joints had delayed motor development. Six months later 23 out of 35 of the group with joint hypermobility and 42 out of 53 of the group with normal joints had normal motor function. Joint hypermobility is associated with an increased incidence of motor delay in infancy. Over the ensuing six months most of the subjects will catch up. These findings, indicating a favourable prognosis, have implications regarding clinical assessment and parental counselling.\r"

The increase was principally due to bruises, scalds, and neglect. The numbers of serious fractures and brain injuries did not increase. The first case of sexual abuse was reported in 1981 and this was followed by a subsequent rise in the detection rate. The combination of increased reporting, increased incidence of proved abuse, and the necessity for increased supervision of families and intervention has created a serious burden on the child health services that may necessitate a reduction in services to other children. Alternative ways of tackling the problems of child abuse may have to be introduced, but they may have unwelcome consequences.\r"

  ".W": "Young age, low weight, and the requirement for transannular patch reconstruction of the right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT) are thought to adversely affect intracardiac repair of tetralogy of Fallot. Forty patients underwent complete repair between January, 1984, and January, 1987. Only infants with pulmonary atresia, complete atrioventricular canal, or coronary artery anomalies were shunted initially. The malalignment ventricular septal defect was closed with a Dacron patch. Infundibular resection was minimized. All atrial communications were left open. Thirty-four patients (85%) had a transannular RVOT patch, and 2 patients (5%) had a nontransannular patch. All 10 infants weighing 3.4 to 9.6 kg had a transannular RVOT patch at 7 weeks to 12 months of age. An RVOT patch was used in 26 of 30 children operated on between 1 and 6 years of age (median age, 24 months). No patient undergoing intracardiac repair died. Postoperative RVOT pullback gradients were between 0 and 35 mm Hg (mean, 18.5 mm Hg). Postoperative pulmonary artery saturation (mean, 73%) did not reveal any residual ventricular septal defect. The right ventricular/arterial pressure ratio was always less than 0.6 (mean, 0.4). All children are doing well at follow-up from two to 37 months. Serial echocardiograms reveal no residual ventricular septal defect and only 1 moderate RVOT gradient. Follow-up cardiac catheterization in 15 patients revealed no residual ventricular septal defect and RVOT gradients between 5 and 35 mm Hg. The right ventricular/left ventricular pressure ratio was always less than 0.6 (mean, 0.48). The early and late results justify continued primary repair of tetralogy of Fallot in symptomatic children, regardless of age or weight.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

For the past eight years we have used an improved technique for the transcervical approach, employing a specially designed sternal retractor that permits improved visualization of the anterior mediastinum. We have reviewed 65 patients operated on between 1977 and 1986. Patients were assessed using a modified Osserman classification (0 = asymptomatic; 1 = ocular signs and symptoms; 2 = mild generalized weakness; 3 = moderate generalized weakness; 4 = severe generalized weakness, respiratory dysfunction, or both). The mean grade for all patients at the time of thymectomy was 2.7. At most recent follow-up, the mean clinical grade was 0.5. In addition, 85% of patients were free of generalized weakness, 95% had improved by at least one grade, and 86% had improved by two or more grades. Comparing these results with those reported following thymectomy through a sternotomy reveals that the transcervical approach gives equivalent results.\r"

There were 268 mitral valve replacements (MVR), 227 aortic valve replacements (AVR), 65 double-valve replacements, and 225 \"combined\" procedures. A 97.2% follow-up (mean, 12 years) was achieved. With an operative mortality of 4.1% for MVR, 8.4% for AVR, 15.4% for double-valve replacement, and 12.4% for combined procedures, the 12-year survival was most closely related to age at valve replacement: age less than 50 years, 70%; age 50 through 59 years, 52%; and age 60 years or more, 38%. Twenty-four patients (3.1%) (6 who had MVR, 5 who had AVR, 1 who had double-valve replacement, and 12 who had combined procedures) had a thrombosed valve 1 to 134 months postoperatively; this is equal to 0.36 thrombosed valve per 100 patient-years. One hundred eighteen embolic episodes occurred in 94 (13%) of the operative survivors or 1.8 emboli per 100 patient-years.

  ".W": "The pulmonary valve homograft (PH) has been reported to have potential advantages over the aortic valve homograft, including a larger diameter, a thinner wall, and decreased intrinsic calcification. From January 16, 1986, to July 14, 1987, eight consecutive patients underwent repair of congenital cardiac anomalies using a cryopreserved PH. Patients ranged in age from 18 months to 32 years. Diagnoses included tetralogy of Fallot with pulmonary atresia (3 patients); tetralogy with absent pulmonary valve (1 patient); corrected transposition with pulmonic stenosis (1 patient); transposition of the great arteries, ventricular septal defect, and pulmonic stenosis (2 patients); and double-outlet right ventricle with pulmonic stenosis (1 patient). The PH was implanted orthotopically in the patient with absent pulmonary valve, and in the other 7 it was placed as a valved extracardiac conduit. Two of the tetralogy patients with severe bifurcational pulmonary stenosis and another with nonconfluent pulmonary arteries and origin of the left pulmonary artery from a patent ductus arteriosus had their repairs facilitated using the branching pulmonary arterial portion of the PH. There were no hospital or posthospital deaths. Postrepair right ventricular to left ventricular systolic pressure ratios were a mean of 0.35 at 18 hours postoperatively (range, 0.21-0.61). All patients were studied with Doppler and echocardiography after repair. The mean gradient across the PH was 9 mm Hg (range, 2-27 mm Hg), and no pulmonary valve incompetence was present. One patient (12.5%) required reoperation seven months after repair for conduit revision due to compression by the sternum and is now well.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Hearts were subjected to 90 minutes of hypothermic arrest (20 degrees C) followed by 15 minutes of reperfusion at 20, 28, or 37 degrees C with a reperfusate containing various concentrations of Ca (0.1-2.55 mM). When reperfusion was started at 37 degrees C, the Ca concentration in the reperfusate significantly affected both postischemic functional recovery and creatine kinase leakage. Bell-shaped dose-response curves were observed. The optimal Ca concentration for 37 degrees C reperfusion was between 0.3 and 0.7 mM. When reperfusion was started at 20 degrees C, neither functional recovery nor creatine kinase leakage was dependent on the Ca concentration in the reperfusate. At 28 degrees C, functional recovery was not dependent on the Ca concentration, however, creatine kinase leakage was. These results indicate that Ca-induced reperfusion injury depends on the temperature of the reperfusate and that the boundary temperature of the reperfusate at which Ca-induced reperfusion injury becomes manifest seems to be near 28 degrees C.\r"

  ".W": "To evaluate the effect of repeated induction of ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation, or both, in patients with poor left ventricular function, we performed intraoperative two-dimensional echocardiography in 6 patients undergoing implantation of the automatic implantable cardioverter/defibrillator. Changes in left ventricular ejection fraction in sinus rhythm were assessed before the first inducible ventricular arrhythmia and after a mean of 6 +/- 1.9 (SD) episodes of ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation. During the procedure no significant change in mean ejection fraction was observed (28 +/- 14 versus 27 +/- 17%). Only 1 of the 6 patients studied had a change in ejection fraction greater than 3% (a decrease from 20 to 11%). In an overall clinical series of 38 primary implants or generator changes (including electrophysiological testing) in 29 patients, 1 patient recovered after postoperative inotropic support and 1 died of acute postoperative ischemic heart failure. We conclude that ventricular arrhythmias induced during automatic implantable cardioverter/defibrillator implantation have no immediate deleterious effects on ejection fraction in most patients with compromised left ventricular function and without ongoing ischemia.\r"

  ".U": "88162406\r", 
  ".W": "Myocellular injury mediated by oxygen radicals potentially limits myocardial protection in ischemically damaged hearts. This damage may be greater with oxygen-carrying blood cardioplegic solutions. A major mechanism of oxygen radical production is the conversion of hypoxanthine to uric acid by xanthine oxidase. In 16 anesthetized dogs, we studied whether adding allopurinol, a xanthine oxidase inhibitor, to blood cardioplegia would improve recovery of left ventricular (LV) performance and oxygen consumption. Millar transducer-tipped catheters and minor axis ultrasonic crystals were placed to assess LV performance by the slope of the end-systolic pressure-minor axis diameter relationships (Emax). Following total vented bypass, the hearts underwent 30 minutes of normothermic ischemia and then hypothermic blood cardioplegia with 1 mM allopurinol (N = 8) or without allopurinol (N = 8). Postischemic LV performance was significantly better with allopurinol than without (49.5 +/- 8.0 versus 17.4 +/- 4.1% of preischemic Emax; p less than 0.004). Postischemic LV oxygen consumption in the beating working state, calculated from LV blood flow (15 microm microspheres) and oxygen extraction, was comparable to preischemic values with and without allopurinol (10.2 +/- 1.2 versus 8.6 +/- 1.2 ml O2/100 gm/min). We conclude that allopurinol enhancement of blood cardioplegia increases myocardial protection in severely ischemic ventricles.\r"

  ".W": "This study was designed to explore new ways of predicting the functional outcomes of stroke and brain injury patients. Upon admission and initial assessment of functional performance, we used an on-line computer program to indicate the most important and subjective judgment items to set rehabilitation goals for patients. The functional performance and discharge outcomes of patients from an inpatient program were measured by using five nonmedical functional items from the patient evaluation conference system (PECS). For stroke patients we most frequently selected motor loss, perceptual/cognitive deficit, spasticity, sensory deficit (PECS medical items), and comprehension (subjective cue). For traumatic brain injury patients, however, we selected motor loss, perceptual/cognitive deficit, spasticity (PECS medical items), communication, and comprehension (subjective cues). Data were statistically analyzed using the Fisher Exact Test. Of the medical function items, a level of independence in the sensory deficit function in stroke patients at admission was associated with a patient achieving independence in ambulation at discharge. Demonstrating a moderate or maximum level of attention, concentration, and realism was positively related to a patient achieving a level of independence in ambulation at discharge. Independence in the function items of behavior and interaction was associated with moderate or maximum levels of comprehension at admission. In traumatic brain injury patients, none of the subjective cues were associated with achieving independence at discharge in any of the functional levels. This paper demonstrates the value of developing a way to assess subjective measures that are based on their ability to predict outcomes. Using such a method, new predictive measures can be developed.\r"

Impedance plethysmography was performed on 105 consecutive stroke patients within one week of admission to our hospital. It was found that 34 out of 100 patients with adequate studies had abnormal IPG, two out of the 34 had known DVT, leaving 32 out of 98 with undiagnosed DVT (19 on the paretic side alone, nine bilateral, and four on the nonparetic side). Using logistic regression analysis, it was determined that profound weakness, male gender, interval between the stroke and IPG, edema, and leg hyperpigmentation were independently associated with positive IPG. Since IPG has a high positive predictive value for proximal DVT, one must assume that most of our patients with positive IPG have proximal DVT. Routine screening of stroke patients for DVT seems indicated and probably should include noninvasive venous studies such as serial IPG. The most efficient screening protocol needs to be determined.\r"

Differences found between the two groups suggest that the ratio of interstitial body fluids to total body fluids in quadriplegic patients is higher than in healthy subjects.

Strength of the hip adductors was determined isometrically. The average (+/- standard error) maximal oxygen consumption (VO2max) for all players was 53.4 +/- 0.8 ml x kg-1 x min-1. When players were grouped by their usual playing positions (Goalies = G, n = 4; Forwards = F, n = 15; and Defensemen = D, n = 8) there were no differences in VO2 max, resting or maximal heart rate, and exercise test duration.

Nineteen adolescents (four males, 15 females) between the ages of 10 and 17 years (means = 13.4), with idiopathic thoracic scoliosis, served as subjects. The mean scoliotic curve was 21.5 degrees. Each subject had his/her height, weight, and percent body fat (Lange caliper) recorded. Resting vital capacity and forced expiratory volume were evaluated using standardized clinical spirometry techniques. Work capacity was measured via a continuous graded incremental exercise tolerance test, using a treadmill. A running protocol was used. Heart rate was continuously monitored by an ECG, and a Beckman Metabolic Cart analyzed ventilation (VE), breathing rate (f), and oxygen uptake (VO2) every minute. Twelve of the subjects had vital capacity measures that were one or more standard deviations below normal and also had VO2max scores below 40ml/kg/min. Subjects with curves of 25 degrees or higher had a mean VO2max of 32.6ml/kg/min, while subjects with curves of less than 25 degrees had a mean VO2max of 42.6ml/kg/min. It appears that some pulmonary limitations begin even in mild curves. Curves greater than 25 degrees also appear to affect work capacity.\r"

Residual deficits included moderate-to-severe dysarthria with a significant palatopharyngeal valving disorder, higher level cognitive impairments, and long-term memory deficits. Speech intelligibility was maximized via the fitting of an intraoral speech prosthesis. Sensory perceptual changes created by the appliance resulted in prosthesis retention problems.

As the number of carriers of this infection increases, so does the expected incidence of this population for acquiring disabilities that require rehabilitative services. We report a traumatic spinal cord injured patient with resultant quadriplegia who has HTLV-III/LAV infection. Presented are the difficulties in classifying the manifestations of the HTLV-III/LAV infection in such a patient. Many of the symptoms of AIDS may be attributed to complications of recently acquired quadriplegia. This is added to the psychologic and social strains on a patient who has already lost permanent function due to quadriplegia. Implementation of educational programs to meet staff, family, and patient needs regarding their concerns and questions significantly reduced anxiety on the rehabilitation unit. Because the possible life expectancy can still be quite long, AIDS patients warrant rehabilitation programs. This necessitates that health care professionals in rehabilitation become familiar with AIDS, as they are likely to be involved in the care of patients with AIDS in the future.\r"

Computerized body tomograms demonstrated a large psoas abscess with fistulous connections to the bowel as well as extending into the capsule of the left hip joint. X-ray examination revealed evidence of acute septic arthritis. Electromyographic studies demonstrated lumbosacral plexus involvement bilaterally. The patient subsequently underwent ileocolectomy with drainage of the left psoas abscess, followed by extensive inpatient rehabilitation. Some immediate strength improvement was noted bilaterally. At discharge, the patient remained paraparetic. In patients with known history of Crohn disease, a psoas abscess should be considered when there are symptoms of lower extremity pain, hip flexion contractures, and progressive weakness.\r"

Therefore, a case-control study of 72 diabetics requiring urgent operation for acute cholecystitis was undertaken. Patients were matched for age, gender, and date of surgery with nondiabetic controls. Review of patient records revealed no significant difference in hospital stay or severity of operative and pathologic findings. However, diabetics suffered significantly more morbidity (38.9%) than nondiabetics (20.8%). Moreover, diabetic infection-related complications occurred at a rate nearly three times that of controls (19.4% vs 6.9%). The only mortalities were experienced by diabetics (4.2%) and were the direct result of the effects of sepsis. These findings suggest that acute cholecystitis in diabetics is associated with a higher incidence of infection-related complications and supports the need for expeditious operative therapy in symptomatic patients.\r"

Perhaps the single most important determinant of hepatic function is nutrient hepatic perfusion. This study compares systemic and hepatic blood flow in rats that have sustained femur fractures with or without associated soft-tissue injury. Femur fracture without soft-tissue trauma resulted in a hyperdynamic state with normal blood flow distribution at 24 hours after injury and normal hemodynamics at 48 hours. When femur fracture was associated with soft-tissue trauma, the elevated cardiac output at 24 hours was not matched by a proportionately elevated hepatic blood flow. In this latter group, the cardiac output was normal at 48 hours, but the hepatic perfusion defect remained. Retained fracture fragments, hematoma, and injured and necrotic soft tissue may serve as a stimulus leading to a pathologic reduction in hepatic perfusion.\r"

Our data indicate that DS (2.5 x 10(-2)% to 2.5 x 10(-4)%) results in greater than 90% inhibition of the migration of both stimulated and nonstimulated neutrophils. Electron microscopy and trypan blue evaluation of neutrophils exposed to DS at these concentrations revealed normal structural features, which indicates that the observed reduction in neutrophil migration is not a result of cell death. In contrast to neutrophils, cultured fibroblasts and endothelial cells exposed to DS (2.5 x 10(-2)% or 2.5 x 10(-3)%) for 30 minutes show marked cell injury characterized by convoluted nuclei, cytoplasmic vacuolization, dilated endoplasmic reticulum, and swollen mitochondria on electron microscopy. These data suggest that DS, even at very dilute concentrations, is toxic to cells of the wound module. We therefore recommend abandonment of the use of DS in open wounds.\r"

Hepatic blood flow in septic rats decreased as early as two hours after sepsis when compared with sham-operated rats (3.8 +/- 1.4 vs 8.7 +/- 3.1 mL/min/100 g body weight). Intracellular sodium and potassium levels and glucose production in septic rats were not significantly different when compared with controls at two hours.

We examined the effect of splenectomy, splenic autotransplantation, and splenic preservation on the induction and growth of 1,2-dimethylhydrazine (DMH)-induced murine colon cancer. Following splenectomy there was a significant increase in malignant tumors but no increase in benign tumors. To rule out the possibility that splenectomy increased the carcinogenicity of DMH by decreasing the capacity for DNA repair in colon cells, the units of 06-alkylguanine DNA alkyltransferase were measured in tumor-free and malignant colon tissue from both splenectomized and control rats. This repair protein was chosen because it is known to protect cells from the mutagenic effects of methylating agents. There was no significant difference in the alkyltransferase activity of tumor-free colon vs malignant tumor or between treatment regimens. Thus, the ability of the spleen to protect rats from the induction of malignant colon tumors induced by DMH is most likely due to preservation of immunologic surveillance in the host.\r"

  ".W": "The mechanisms of ischemia-reperfusion injury in skeletal muscle remain controversial. Some investigators have demonstrated that heparin can ameliorate ischemic injury to heart, brain, and renal tissue. We investigated the ability of heparin sodium to decrease ischemia-reperfusion injury in an isolated gracilis muscle model in ten anesthetized mongrel dogs. One gracilis muscle was perfused normally while the contralateral muscle was subjected to six hours of ischemia followed by one hour of reperfusion. Five dogs were given a preischemic bolus of heparin sodium (200 U/kg, intravenously followed by a continuous infusion (15 U/kg/h, intravenously), and five control dogs received no heparin. Quantitation of skeletal muscle ischemia-reperfusion injury was determined by histochemical staining with triphenyl tetrazolium-chloride and computerized planimetry of the infarct size. Results from the ischemic muscle demonstrate a significant beneficial effect of heparinization. The nonheparinized dogs had a 72% +/- 5% infarct size, which was significantly reduced to 24% +/- 8% in the heparinized dogs. The mechanism of this protective effect may be due to heparin's anticoagulant, antiplatelet, or anti-inflammatory action.\r"

Only two (8%) of 24 pseudoaneurysms treated surgically before 1977 were infected, whereas 17 (30%) of 57 treated during the past decade were infected. There were four deaths among 12 patients (33%) with infected pseudoaneurysms compared with only one death among 45 patients (2%) with noninfected pseudoaneurysms. All five amputations were consequences of infected pseudoaneurysms. We conclude that (1) infection as a cause of pseudoaneurysm is increasing, (2) mortality and limb loss are now confined almost exclusively to cases involving infection, and (3) the current approach to pseudoaneurysm should include a high index of suspicion in patients at risk for infection, increased use of newer diagnostic scans, and an aggressive surgical attack on infected pseudoaneurysms that may require complete graft excision and extra-anatomic bypass.\r"

  ".W": "Doppler-derived blood flow velocity and limb blood pressure measurements were used to characterize the hemodynamics of 128 in situ saphenous vein arterial bypasses. The magnitude and configuration of the graft velocity waveform was the best predictor of clinical outcome. Successful bypasses had antegrade flow throughout the pulse cycle and a blood flow velocity above 40 cm/s. A low graft blood flow velocity (less than 40 cm/s) was associated with technical error or early graft failure due to poor runoff. The return of normal limb blood pressure correlated with a technically satisfactory bypass but was measured in only 50% of limbs on the first day after surgery. In 28 bypasses with high blood flow velocity (mean +/- SD) in systole (102 +/- 20 cm/s) and diastole (35 +/- 11 cm/s), postoperative limb blood pressure was initially low (mean ankle-brachial pressure index = 0.68) due to restriction of blood flow through small-diameter (less than 4-mm) venous conduits. As revascularization hyperemia abated, diastolic blood flow velocity decreased and limb blood pressure normalized. Despite the high blood flow velocity and pressure gradient associated with flow-restrictive venous conduits, limb ischemic symptoms resolved, and graft patency was not decreased. An understanding of graft and limb hemodynamics after in situ bypass grafting is critical when noninvasive diagnostic techniques are used to document technical adequacy and for postoperative surveillance.\r"

The total cost of uncomplicated bypass surgery averaged +20,300, compared with +14,000 for uncomplicated below-knee amputation. However, including the cost of prosthesis and rehabilitation, the total cost of primary amputation was +20,400, equivalent to that of the bypass operation. Complications requiring revision of a bypass graft increased hospitalization by 4.5 days with the total cost rising to +28,700; complications that ended with major amputation added 15 hospitalization days and had an average cost of +42,200. In contrast, complicated below-knee amputation cost +40,600 and added 12.5 hospitalization days. There is therefore no cost-benefit in primary amputation when compared with arterial reconstruction, and cost should not be used to deny a patient the opportunity for limb salvage.\r"

Twenty-two patients underwent a total of 27 ECA revascularizations. There were no perioperative strokes or deaths. During a mean follow-up period of 46 months, no strokes occurred and only two patients suffered transient ischemic attacks. Revascularization of the ECA is an effective means of treating the patient with ipsilateral internal carotid artery occlusion and may be performed with minimal morbidity and mortality.\r"

A fibrillar matrix that morphologically resembled elastin was demonstrated in these same specimens under ultraviolet light. The phenomenon of substantial preservation of features of medial architecture suggests that, if the pathogenetic mechanism is enzymatic destruction, the process is highly selective. Comparisons with differences in human fetal vs newborn aortas and in Blotchy mouse vs normal mouse aortas suggest superficial similarities. These latter observations suggest that a hypothesis of maturation arrest might be considered as an alternative to enzymatic destruction. Definitive experiments to test the relative importance of maturation arrest vs enzymatic destruction in the pathogenesis of aneurysmal disease will require further studies.\r"

Six patients were considered to be at high risk for bleeding, as their varices were large and had \"red color signs\" endoscopically. Liver cirrhosis was associated with all cases. The grade of hepatic dysfunction was Child A in seven and Child B in three patients. As the HCCs were relatively small, partial wedge hepatectomy was carried out in all patients. Five patients underwent the original Warren shunt, but the remaining five had modified shunts with expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (Gore-Tex) interposition. There was no operative mortality within one month. Nine patients with patent shunts had no variceal bleeding despite the fact that three of them had tumor recurrence in the liver. Hepatic encephalopathy occurred transiently in only one instance. Six patients were alive at the time this report was written, eight to 49 months after operation. Five were free of cancer and one had tumor recurrence. This result may indicate that relatively small HCCs and esophageal varices can be simultaneously treated by limited hepatic resection and distal splenorenal shunt in patients with Child A or B liver disease.\r"

No patient had both autoantibodies. Weak associations with HLA-DR5 and HLA-DR1 were detected with anti-Scl-70 and ACA, respectively. ACA was found almost exclusively (96%) in patients with limited cutaneous scleroderma (the CREST syndrome variant), but the majority (57%) of patients with limited scleroderma did not have this antibody. Among patients with limited scleroderma, those with ACA more often had calcinosis and telangiectasias and less often had pulmonary interstitial fibrosis and restrictive lung disease. However, the frequency of pulmonary hypertension and the survival rates were similar in the ACA+ and ACA- limited scleroderma patients. Two-thirds of patients with anti-Scl-70 had diffuse scleroderma, but only 33% of all diffuse scleroderma patients had this antibody. Within the subset of diffuse scleroderma, anti-Scl-70 was associated with peripheral vascular disease (digital pitting scars) and pulmonary interstitial fibrosis, but was not predictive of cardiac or renal involvement or survival. ACA and anti-Scl-70 are useful in diagnosing and classifying systemic sclerosis variants and in predicting the natural course of the disease. Their mutually exclusive occurrence suggests either 2 separate clinical entities or important host factors determining their production.\r"

Most of the anti-Ro (SS-A) antibodies bound to both human and bovine Ro (SS-A) in the solid phase, but only one of the monoclonal antibodies selectively bound to human Ro (SS-A); this suggests that there are species differences between the bovine and human Ro (SS-A) antigens. Indirect immunofluorescence studies demonstrated that most anti-Ro (SS-A) antibodies bound to cytoplasmic or nuclear HEp-2 cellular antigens, whereas others did not bind to fixed HEp-2 tissue culture cells.
