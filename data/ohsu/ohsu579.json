Soon after administration of morphine as well as of sufentanil, ventilation was more profoundly depressed when rats had been pretreated with chlordiazepoxide. With chlordiazepoxide, respiratory depression after epidural injection of the longer acting and poorly lipid-soluble morphine could still be observed when analgesic activity had disappeared. The data are explained most parsimoniously by assuming that stress counteracts the respiratory effects of epidural opiates, and that late respiratory depression can occur in as much as the opiate continues to act at points of time when the effects of stress have disappeared.\r"

Doses were adjusted to individual patient needs and varied from 75 micrograms/h to 350 micrograms/h (median = 225 micrograms/h). Plasma fentanyl levels reflected the administered dose and remained constant throughout the treatment. Transdermal delivery of narcotics provides a new option for the cancer patient unable to achieve satisfactory analgesia with oral medications.\r"

  ".W": "This paper presents a new approach to the measurement and understanding of clinical pain. A multidimensional scaling (MDS) procedure was used to analyze pairwise similarity judgments made to 9 pain descriptors by 24 cancer pain patients and 24 healthy volunteers. The question was whether the dimensions of the global pain space differed between the 2 groups. The Pain Intensity dimension was found to be primary for the patients, but much less important for the volunteers. Otherwise, the group stimulus space revealed broadly similar 3-dimensional solutions. The Pain Intensity dimension placed Mild Pain and Annoying at one pole and Intense and Unbearable Pain at the other. The Emotional Quality dimension grouped the descriptors Sickening and Miserable (and, in part, Intense Pain and Unbearable Pain) at the strong negative affect pole for both groups; they differed, however, with respect to the moderate affect pole. The Somatosensory dimension ranged from Burning to Cramping. The subject weight space revealed that the Pain Intensity dimension was the most important dimension for the patients, while Emotional Quality was more salient for the volunteers. Wide differences were found in the salience of the various dimensions to different individuals; this information may prove useful for tailoring patient treatment. The study demonstrates that MDS procedures such as INDSCAL, in which the subjects (rather than the researcher) determine the number and characteristics of the global pain dimensions, will improve our understanding and treatment of pain.\r"

On the 2 occasions 65% and 70% of patients were able to scale intensity words with an internal consistency of r greater than or equal to 0.90. Eleven (55%) patients met this criterion on both occasions. The percentage of patients meeting the internal consistency criterion for unpleasantness descriptors was much lower, 25% and 40% on the 2 occasions. For patients who met the internal consistency criterion for intensity words there was very high test-retest stability for the group scale values of the intensity words. There was no evidence that the level of psychological distress was associated with ability to scale unpleasantness words. Intelligence was positively related to the ability to scale intensity descriptors.\r"

In the third part of the study subjects completed a cross-modal matching task to scale the intensity and affect words. Data from the first 2 parts of the study were examined with multidimensional scaling (MDS) and hierarchical cluster analyses. Free-sorting the descriptors did not produce 2 groups corresponding to the intensity and affect descriptors described in the Tursky PPP. The descriptors were arranged in 6 groups described by subjects as reflecting increasing painfulness. An MDS analysis showed that the groups could be located in 2-dimensional space in which the dimensions of intensity and affective distress could be easily discerned. When the descriptors from the intensity and affect scales were rated within each scale, a second MDS analysis showed that, whereas the intensity descriptors could be fitted by a 1-dimensional representation, the affect descriptors required a 3-dimensional model. There was evidence that subjects with extensive pain experience placed greater weight on the second and third affective dimensions compared with relatively pain-free subjects.\r"

Each patient completed the Catastrophizing scale of the Coping Strategies Questionnaire (CSQ) on 2 occasions separated by 6 months (time 1, time 2). The Catastrophizing scale is designed to measure negative self-statements, castastrophizing thoughts and ideation (sample items = 'I worry all the time about whether it will end,' 'It is awful and I feel that it overwhelms me'). Data analysis revealed that the Catastrophizing scale was internally reliable (alpha = 0.91) and had high test-retest reliability (r = 0.81) over a 6 month period. Correlational analyses revealed that catastrophizing recorded at time 1 was related to pain intensity ratings, functional impairment on the Arthritis Impact Measurement scale (AIMS), and depression at time 2. Predictive findings regarding catastrophizing while modest were obtained after controlling for initial scores on the dependent variables, demographic variables (age, sex, socioeconomic status), duration of pain, and disability support status. Taken together, these findings suggest that catastrophizing is a maladaptive coping strategy in RA patients. Further research is needed to determine whether cognitive-behavioral interventions designed to decrease catastrophizing can reduce pain and improve the physical and psychological functioning of RA patients.\r"

Results of both individual and group analyses revealed a significant main effect of diagnosis. Post hoc analyses (Duncan's) revealed controls to have significantly lower overall EMG levels than the intervertebral disk disorders and unspecified musculoskeletal backache groups. A significant diagnosis by position interaction was observed. Analysis of simple main effects revealed this to be due primarily to control subjects during the standing position having lower EMG levels than all other groups, and intervertebral disk disorder subjects having higher EMG levels than all other groups during the supported sitting position. The importance of clearly defined diagnostic categories in low back pain research and the utility of measuring subjects in various positions are discussed.\r"

On objective measures, 56% of patients reported themselves working or work ready, 58% no longer received compensation, 62% were taking no prescription medications and 65% had no or brief medical treatment since evaluations. Perceived disability, however, suggested a bleaker outcome picture with only 29% of patients perceiving themselves as improving. There was a strong relationship between perceived disability and objective circumstances with 63% of the patients unable to work and 61% still on disability payments reporting their disability as increasing. Of the 48 patients reporting back surgery at some point after evaluation only 17% perceived themselves as improved while 58% considered themselves worse.

The patients rated the combination significantly better than ibuprofen alone, and the combination was preferred by 16 of the 22 patients expressing a preference. There was no significant increase in side-effect incidence with the combination. The 30% increase in analgesic effect may be of clinical benefit, and this trial design, cross-over with multiple dosing in out-patients, may be a sensitive test for analgesics, potentially more predictive of side-effect problems than single-dose studies.\r"

Each mother was asked to rate how anxious she and her child were immediately prior to the immunization. Both mother and child behaviors were observed and rated using separate 5-point behavior scales. The results of this study indicate that although child behavior during an immunization varied a great deal, most mothers reassured and very few admonished their children during the immunization procedure. Children with extremely reassuring parents fell into 2 distinct groups with half responding distressed and half non-distressed during the immunization. Mothers of these children who rated their children as highly anxious prior to the procedure had children who were most likely to be observed to be distressed during the procedure.\r"

The etiologic viral diagnosis was based on serologic tests and the isolation of virus from cell cultures which distinguished between attenuated and \"virulent\" mumps virus. The incidence of mumps vaccine-associated meningitis was 1/1000 vaccine recipients. In 92% of children the incubation period was 11 to 25 days and 28% had associated swelling of the salivary glands. Sixteen cases (13.9%) had a positive cerebrospinal fluid culture (attenuated mumps virus, 6 cases; \"virulent\" mumps virus, 7 cases; echoviruses, 3 cases). Clustering of cases, seasonal occurrence and age of the patients suggested causal relationship with the vaccination in the majority of children. In 4 patients with attenuated virus isolation from cerebrospinal fluid the incubation period ranged from 17 to 20 days. Clinical findings did not differ from natural mumps meningitis. The course was uncomplicated and at discharge the patients had no sequelae. Measles virus was never found as a cause of the meningitis. The mumps vaccine virus should be recognized as one of the causative agents of aseptic meningitis in countries where less attenuated mumps vaccine is used.\r"

There are always patients to call the next day, laboratory data to check, consultants to contact, clinical subjects to review, etc. It is not easy to remember all of these items, especially those that require action in the distant future. In this article TRAKIT, a computer-assisted system with which to organize all of these things to do, is described. The use of the system conserves office time, improves the quality of clinical care, fosters positive doctor-patient relationships, and might help prevent malpractice suits. The system is simple, inexpensive, easy to use, flexible enough to meet the needs of any individual practice, and does not require the physician to modify established work habits. TRAKIT has been found to be an invaluable aide in a primary care pediatric practice.\r"

For 100,157 circumcised boys, there were 193 complications (0.19%). These included 62 local infections, eight cases of bacteremia, 83 incidences of hemorrhage (31 requiring ligature and three requiring transfusion), 25 instances of surgical trauma, and 20 urinary tract infections. There were no deaths or reported losses of the glans or entire penis. By contrast, the complications in the 35,929 uncircumcised infants were all related to urinary tract infections. Of the 88 boys with such infections (0.24%), 32 had concomitant bacteremia, three had meningitis, two had renal failure, and two died. The frequencies of urinary tract infection (P less than .0001) and bacteremia (P less than .0002) were significantly higher in the uncircumcised boys. Serious complications from routine prepuce removal are rare and relatively minor. Circumcision may be beneficial in reducing the occurrence of urinary tract infections and their associated sequelae.\r"

  ".W": "The management of children with severe acute asthma who required admission to the intensive care (ICU) of this hospital during 1982 to 1988 was reviewed retrospectively. A total of 89 children were admitted to the ICU on 125 occasions. During the study period, 24% of the patients were admitted to the ICU on more than one occasion. Prior to admission to this hospital, patients had been symptomatic for a mean of 48 hours. Although all patients had received bronchodilators before admission to hospital, only 23% of patients had received oral corticosteroids. According to initial arterial blood gas values determined in the ICU, 77% of the patients had hypercapnia (PaCO2 greater than 45 mm Hg). The pharmacologic agents used in the ICU included nebulized beta 2-agonists (100% of admissions), theophylline (99%), steroids (94%), nebulized ipratropium bromide (10%), IV albuterol (38%), and IV isoproterenol (10%). Mechanical ventilation was necessary in 33% of admissions; the mean duration of ventilation was 32 hours. Ten patients had pneumothorax; in six cases, these were related to mechanical ventilation. Three of the patients who received mechanical ventilation died, representing a mortality of 7.5%. In each of these patients, sudden, severe asthma episodes had developed at home, resulting in respiratory arrest. They had evidence of hypoxic encephalopathy at the time of admission to the ICU and eventually were declared brain dead. It was concluded that delay in seeking medical care and underuse of oral corticosteroids at home may have contributed to the need for ICU admission.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The purpose of the present study was to evaluate factors affecting the rate of macrosomia and related complications in a population of infants of insulin-dependent diabetic mothers. The following factors were hypothesized to be predisposing to macrosomia: increased maternal weight gain during gestation, increased number of births until infant No. 3, white race, increased maternal age, poor glycemic control from the 20th week of gestation, and increased insulin dose. Advance White classification and increased duration of diabetes were predicted to be inversely related. In addition, macrosomia was hypothesized to predispose to selected adverse perinatal outcomes including premature labor, birth asphyxia, birth injury, hypoglycemia, polycythemia, and respiratory distress syndrome. From 1978 to 1986, 127 pregnancies were prospectively studied, 86 of the total number of women were entered prior to 10 weeks' gestation, and 41 were entered after 10 weeks' gestation. Patients monitored blood glucose at least twice daily with glycemic control achieved by \"split-dosage\" regimens of insulin. Glycohemoglobin was measured monthly. Pregnancy dating was based on the date of the last menstrual period and the Ballard score of the infant at birth. Macrosomia was defined as a birth weight greater than the 90th percentile of the intrauterine growth curves of Lubchenco. Of the babies born to mothers with insulin-dependent diabetes, 43% were large for gestational age and 57% were appropriate for gestational age.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Near-drowning (n = 103) and drowning (n = 96) victims were identified from medical examiners' reports, paramedics' reports, and hospital discharge registers. Annual incidence was 5.5; the mortality rate was 2.6 per 100,000 children. Although preschool-aged children had the largest incidence (12.8), followed by older adolescents (4.9), adolescents had the largest case fatality rate, 77%. Lake and river victims had the largest incidence, mortality, and case fatality rate; swimming pools, the smallest case fatality rate (25%). A total of 89% of all victims had absent or no supervision; victims supervised by lifeguards had a 42% case fatality rate. Prior seizures were part of the history of 7.5% of all victims; 25% of fatal submersions by adolescents were associated with alcohol. Bathtub submersions were associated with child abuse in three of 16 preschool-aged children and epilepsy in four of five older children. Certain age groups and sites combined had the greatest incidence: preschool-aged children in swimming pools, infants in bathtubs, teenagers in lakes and rivers. Incidence decreased in public and semipublic pools coincident with fencing regulations. These findings suggest prevention strategies: extending fencing requirements to private pools, discouraging alcohol consumption during water sports, changing bathing practices of epileptics, and improving lifeguard efficacy.\r"

  ".W": "Beginning in 1982 all pregnant women undergoing prenatal routine blood analysis in three large city hospitals and one large rural area were tested for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg). Infants of all HBsAg-positive mothers received hepatitis B immunoglobulin (HBIg), 0.5 mL/kg of body weight within two hours of birth and, after randomization, 10 micrograms of hepatitis B vaccine either at 0, 1, 2, and 11 months of age (schedule A) or at 3, 4, 5, and 11 months of age (schedule B). A second injection of HBIg (1 mL) was given to infants on schedule B at 3 months of age. Blood samples were obtained at 3, 6, 11, 12, 24, and 36 months. In a two-year period, 28,412 pregnant women were tested for HBsAg; screening efficiency varied between 85% and 98%. The overall prevalence of HBsAg was 0.8%, with a marked variation between urban centers (2.2%) and the rural area (0.3%). Vaccinations were received by 180 of 193 infants of HBsAg-positive mothers (90 on schedule A and 90 on schedule B). Concentrations of hepatitis B surface antibody less than 10 IU/L were observed in nine instances in five children from group A and in seven instances in six children from group B. Four hepatitis B viral infections (two HBsAg carriers, two who underwent antihepatitis B core seroconversions) were recorded in group A v one infection (antihepatitis B core seroconversion) in group B. The protective efficacy of the program (screening plus passive immunization and delayed vaccination) was 94%. The estimated cost of preventing one cae of hepatitis B infection in neonates was $3,000 (US currency).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

A self-report questionnaire, which allowed multiple answers for each question, was administered to 853 male students in six high schools. Results indicated that an average of 11% had used or were using anabolic steroids. The following were assessed: the reasons for steroid use, the sources from which the students received information about steroids, their familiarity with the physiologic effects and complications of steroid use, and the extent of their involvement in sports. The results suggest that a segment of male adolescents are using anabolic steroids without fully understanding the risks of such behavior. Health care providers need to become knowledgeable about steroids so that they may better educate adolescents about the potential deleterious effects of these agents.\r"

Six PL-I residents (treatment group) participated in a role play curriculum during their first month of rotation through the outpatient department; seven PL-I residents (control group) received no formal instruction in telephone management. Baseline performance was measured on entry into the study using telephone calls made by a \"simulated\" mother using standardized scripts. Follow-up calls were made approximately 3 months later. Transcripts of these calls were rated by examiners who were unaware of group assignment using a standardized instrument that measured three aspects of performance: general history taking, specific history taking, and general management. Results were as follows: Mean posttest scores for the combined groups were: 59.4% (general history taking), 75.9% (specific history taking), and 77.7% (general management). By analysis of covariance, treatment group residents had significantly higher posttest scores in general history taking than control group residents (67.1% v 53.6%, P = .004). This difference occurred without a significant increase in the time spent answering the call. These data indicate that a role play curriculum results in improved performance in at least one aspect of telephone management.\r"

  ".W": "Because of a nationally apparent increased interest in emergency medical services for children and the need for a greater understanding of the relationship between office pediatric and emergency department care of children, a questionnaire was mailed to practitioners to (1) describe office physician involvement with emergent conditions, and (2) evaluate physician office preparedness for pediatric emergencies. Responses were received from 280 pediatricians and family practitioners, including information regarding the availability of equipment and medication, physician training, and practice characteristics. Of the responding physicians, 62% reported that they assessed in their offices more than one child each week who required hospitalization or urgent treatment. A preparedness score was developed and multiple regression analysis was used to investigate the relationship between this score and physician and practice characteristics. The mean overall preparedness score was 53.7 of a possible 156 (range 5 to 136, SD = 31.3). Characteristics related to this score were type of practice and advanced cardiac life support certification. Large multispecialty practices and practices with physicians trained in advanced cardiac life support tended to have better preparedness scores. Family practitioners tended to have more complete stock of medications than pediatricians. The data presented suggested that critically ill children who enter the medical system via the office setting may have a better than even chance of finding the office unprepared to treat the emergency: in fewer than one third of the offices in which it was reported that at least one patient was seen weekly with asthma, anaphylaxis, sickle cell vasoocclusive crisis, status epilepticus, and sepsis were they fully equipped to treat emergencies related to these conditions.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Privileges were graded from 1 to 6 with category 1 allowing the private attending pediatrician to care for all newborns and category 6 not allowing the private attending pediatrician to care for any newborns. Nurseries were classified (per New York State Department of Health) as regional, nonregional intensive care, intermediate care, and continuing care centers. A total of 97% (88/90) of institutions responded, representing 2,040 private attending pediatricians. In 95% (79/83) of the New York state institutions with staff private attending pediatricians, the pediatricians' privileges were limited. In 18% (15/83), the private attending pediatrician does not supervise any newborns receiving special care, whereas in an additional 77%, pediatricians' privileges have been limited. Despite this, the majority of institutions encourage the private attending pediatrician to continue communication with the family. Limited hospital privileges coupled with continued family communication may be the future trend for private attending pediatricians in the hospital setting.\r"

  ".W": "A thin and semipermeable polyurethane membrane adherently applied to premature neonates as an artificial skin was investigated as an atraumatic surface barrier sufficient to reduce transepidermal water loss without inhibiting natural infant skin development during the first few days of life. A sample group of 18 neonates (birth weight [mean +/- SEM] 1.39 +/- 0.12 kg, gestation [mean +/- SEM] 31 +/- 1 weeks) received two 3 X 3-cm polyurethane patches adherent over the chest and abdomen. Transepidermal water loss was measured before and after application and after membrane removal. During longitudinal study, seven infants were treated day 1 through day 4 of life and were evaluated for skin integrity 24 hours after patch removal on day 5. Polyurethane membranes produced an acute and significant reduction in transepidermal water loss for the 18 subjects: 21.1 +/- 2.0 g/m2/h before application v 10.5 +/- 1.4 g/m2/h with membranes in place (P less than .001). Immediately after patch removal, transepidermal loss returned to 22.8 +/- 3.0 g/m2/h. Throughout the first four days of life, daily measurements of water loss were significantly less: 53% to as much as 72% reduction from polyurethane-covered sites when compared with adjacent naked skin. After polyurethane membrane removal, skin development of transepidermal barrier function was comparable over both sites. Dressings did not lose adhesive or plastic properties during an extended time in either radiant warmer or incubator environments, electronic monitoring through membranes was not impeded, and adhesive injuries were not observed. An adherent, semipermeable polyurethane membrane may be effective as an atraumatic artificial barrier to prevent large transepidermal water loss and protect the skin of the premature neonate.\r"

(2) What problems do black pediatricians face in starting their careers? (3) Are the problems black pediatricians face similar to those other pediatricians face? Results show black pediatricians to be generally satisfied with their careers. They are more likely than other pediatricians to experience problems in the financing and business aspects of launching careers, however, and in peer support and role models. A finding that career satisfaction is related to a belief that organizational membership is important to careers is explored. Black pediatricians are still severely underrepresented in the profession compared with the number of blacks in the population.\r"

Consequently, the routine clinical management in the intensive care nursery at Yale-New Haven Hospital was modified to include shielding each premature infant's isolette, thereby decreasing the intensity of the nursery lights on an infant's eyes from a median light level of 55 foot-candles to 15 foot-candles. The effect of this reduction of light level on the incidence of retinopathy of prematurity in 161 premature infants was prospectively investigated. This group was then compared with a historic control group of 129 premature infants with similar characteristics who had been exposed to standard nursery lighting. There was no difference in the incidence and severity of retinopathy of prematurity between the two groups.\r"

Eight (47%) of the patients had been referred for ophthalmologic examination by their pediatrician for evaluation of this symptom. All were in excellent health with no associated symptoms or signs of systemic or ocular disease. None of the children were taking topical ocular or systemic medications. The parents of seven (41%) of these children were able to identify a temporally related stressful event that coincided with the onset of blinking. Durations of the symptom prior to examination ranged from 1 week to 4 months. Spontaneous resolution occurred from one day to 5 months after the first ophthalmologic examination. Recurrence occurred in only one child, but resolution was still completed within 5 months. Excessive eye blinking unassociated with other systemic or ocular findings appears to be a medically benign, self-limited functional disorder.\r"

Massive hepatomegaly and steatosis developed in the baby at a time of severe viral respiratory illness, prolonged fasting, hypoglycemia, and hypoketonuria. The infant was found to have secondary plasma carnitine deficiency and excessive loss of carnitine in the urine as part of a more generalized renal tubular dysfunction accompanying vitamin D deficiency and secondary hyperparathyroidism. With correction of the metabolic abnormalities and institution of a high carnitine diet, the hepatomegaly disappeared, plasma carnitine returned to normal levels, and the renal carnitine loss ceased. The findings suggest that secondary carnitine deficiency may play a role in fatty infiltration of the liver in patients with cystic fibrosis, especially during times of severe fasting stress.\r"

To be prepared to act as a moral agent in clinical practice, a terminal goal upon completion of the baccalaureate program is the student's ability to develop and consistently use a systematic approach/framework when confronted by an ethical dilemma. Eleven skill steps not necessarily exclusive or in sequence were outlined as selected activities that can be considered for the ethical decision process. Specific ethical issues that are germane and applicable to many patient care situations were investigated and identified as frequently occurring in clinical practice. Course work about these issues prior to completion of their nursing programs may be beneficial in preparing students with basic knowledge and skill about them as they enter or return to clinical practice.\r"

  ".W": "Competency in ethical decision making is an identified expectation of the baccalaureate degree graduate. Values, both personal and professional, do not provide a systematic foundation for ethical decision making. The nurse is a unique health care provider and as such is faced with ethical decision of practice that are derived from and are relevant to that role. An understanding of ethical principles and theories as well as application of them to the role of the professional nurse is essential to ethical decision making in nursing practice. Seventy four per cent of recent graduates stated that the ethical content in their nursing programs most influenced their ethical decision-making skills, yet, only 23% used an ethical model or framework in analyzing and resolving the ethical dilemma of practice. The usual format for presentation of this content is a course in ethics. The content of such courses should include ethical theories and principles and their application to the practice of nursing. Teaching methodologies include guided case analysis and written responses to cases and current issues. Placement of separate required ethics courses remains a problem because of the overwhelming amount of content in baccalaureate degree curricula. Research has tentatively validated the need for a separate required course in nursing ethics. Further studies are necessary. If ethics content is integrated throughout the curriculum, it should be presented early with continual reinforcement and with the use of a specific ethics textbook. Research indicates that students who have completed a nursing ethics course not only know the correct ethical action but are more likely to implement it.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

With silent patients, however, advocacy involves more: the nurse speaking with the patient's voice. That dimension of advocacy represents its greatest challenge as a moral position. Other positions offer easier approaches to moral issues with silent patients. Utilitarianism and beneficence require little, if any, access to patient subjectivity. For the nurse committed to regard for patient self-determination, access to the subjective world of silent patients is crucial. That access is possible only when the nurse's voice, like the patient's, arises from the experience of embodiment. Silent patients cannot be represented by the words of bodiless advocates. Embodiment--of nurse and patient--is the avenue to subjectivity and the essential basis for a moral commitment to advocacy.\r"

Advocacy exhibits a sensitivity to personal values, hopes, and even unspoken prayer that shape an atmosphere of caring. Patient advocacy enhances all that is life giving.\r"

  ".W": "The current nursing shortage is a supply-and-demand problem. Factors contributing to the shortage include increased hospital use of RNs; decreased nursing school enrollment; increased demand for RNs outside of hospitals in skilled nursing facilities, health maintenance organizations, and home health care programs; noncompetitive salaries; and lack of autonomy. The nursing shortage has triggered the development and implementation of programs to prepare non-nurse bedside technicians to work in partnership with RNs. The functions of these unlicensed persons range from housekeeping, stocking, and clerical responsibilities to several technical treatments that once fell within the role responsibilities of registered or practical nurses. The partnerships between unlicensed persons and RNs in patient care settings have given rise to several administrative, policy, and ethical issues for nurse leaders. An ethical analysis, based on the application of ethical principles and moral dilemmas found in \"The Parable of the Sadhu,\" offers some guidelines to nursing leaders in the administrative and policy decisions inherent in the development and retention of licensed persons in patient care settings. Some conclusions drawn from the ethically based questions are: The acquisition and retention of RNs and other licensed caregivers should take precedence over the development of programs for non-nurse bedside technicians. RNs in partnership with unlicensed persons in patient care settings must know what they can legitimately delegate. The RN has personal responsibility for ensuring optimal standards of nursing practice in the delegation of duties. The partnership between professional nurses and unlicensed persons must be a participative effort, not a manipulative or coercive one. In putting the organizational principle of subsidiarity into practice, decision makers will be able to maintain respect for human dignity and the uniqueness of patients and caregivers as well. The development and retention of unlicensed persons in patient care settings depends on a well-developed personal ethic that needs to be congruent with the mission, philosophy, and codes of ethics of national and local health care organizations.\r"

It acknowledges the larger context within which nurses practice by focusing on selected issues involved in resource allocation and death and dying, cross-culturally. The questions raised about universally shared moral principles reflects the larger questions of cultural and ethical relativism. The discussions of new developments in international nursing ethics focuses on international conferences, the teaching of nursing ethics, national nursing associations, and other professional groups that are actively involved in health care or nursing ethics. Finally, the development of international nursing ethics research studies is providing new knowledge about the scope of ethics within nursing and the nature of nursing care worldwide. Nurses are involved in some aspects of these new developments in nursing ethics in all countries. As they examine and reflect on ethical principles, virtues, and on an ethics of caring, they bring a new dimension to their work as nurses. This new dimension stands as one of the oldest and most central foundations in professional nursing.\r"

It has been most commonly linked to succinylcholine chloride (Anectine, Quelicin, Sucostrin) and halothane (Fluothane). The most important treatment method, after discontinuation of the triggering agent(s), is immediate administration of dantrolene sodium (Dantrium). Diagnostic testing of susceptibility is available but has significant limitations. If the new phosphorus nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy proves to be an accurate test for susceptibility and becomes more readily available, decreases in the current case-fatality rate of 10% may follow.\r"

The pharmacologic properties, cost, and side-effect profiles of these drugs differ considerably, and the effectiveness of certain agents appears to vary according to the patient's age and race.

However, no single definition of incest is widely accepted, as the degree of kinship in which marriage is allowed and the age of consent vary. Fueled in part by the current emphasis on child abuse prevention, the reporting of incest is increasing. The perpetrator in the majority of reported cases is a male adult, and most often the victim is a young girl. Other dyads do occur and are probably under-estimated in frequency. Disturbed family relationships generate a shift in individual responsibilities and expectations that can lead to incest. A lack of spousal sexual activity is a common preceding factor. The sequelae of this breach of family integrity are significant. Frequently, the family itself is destroyed; the destruction often begins before incest occurs. The victim faces a future characterized by emotional turmoil, diminished self-esteem, impaired interpersonal relationships, and impulsive acting-out behavior. Family and individual therapy, participation in support groups, and referral for chemical dependency treatment are essential if future problems in the lives of everyone involved are to be avoided.\r"

We previously isolated cDNAs encoding two different mammalian thyroid hormone receptors, one from human placenta (hTR beta) and the other from rat brain (rTR alpha), and showed that their in vitro translation products bind thyroid hormones with the characteritistic affinities of the native thyroid hormone receptor. We now demonstrate that both of the cloned receptors activate transcription from a thyroid hormone-responsive promoter in a hormone-dependent manner, with rTR alpha eliciting a greater response than hTR beta. The putative functional domains of the thyroid hormone receptors were examined by creating chimeric thyroid hormone/glucocorticoid receptors, producing receptors with hybrid functional properties. These experiments support the proposal that the thyroid hormone receptors are composed of interchangeable functional domains, and indicate that the mechanism of hormone-inducible gene regulation has been conserved in steroid and thyroid hormone receptors.\r"

Modified histones carrying different numbers of ADP-ribose groups form a ladder of bands above each variant histone. Cellular lysates containing unfragmented DNA mainly synthesize mono(ADP-ribosylated) histones. Cleavage of the DNA with either DNase I or micrococcal nuclease to fragments of an average size of 10-20 kilobases (kb) dramatically induces the formation of poly(ADP-ribosylated) species of histones in nuclei. As the number of DNA strand breaks produced by either DNase I or micrococcal nuclease increases and a great number of DNA cuts is introduced (fragments of 0.4-0.2 kb), the size of the poly(ADP-ribose) chains on the histones decreases. Finally, in the presence of 10 mM cAMP as an inhibitor of poly(ADP-ribose) glycohydrolase, human lymphoid nuclei synthesize hyper(ADP-ribosylated) histone H2B with at least 40 ADP-ribose groups attached to it. Lateral ladders emanating at precise points of the linear ladder on hypermodified H2B can arise from branching of poly(ADP-ribose) or from multiple monomodifications of glutamic (or aspartic) acid residues. Branching or de novo monomodifications occur after a precise number of ADP-ribose groups have been added to a histone molecule. Poly(ADP-ribosylated) histones thus appear to be intermediates in nuclear processes involving DNA strand breaks.\r"

  ".W": "We have isolated and analyzed the structure of the genes coding for the alpha and beta forms of the human cardiac myosin heavy chain (MYHC). Detailed analysis of four overlapping MYHC genomic clones shows that the alpha-MYHC and beta-MYHC genes constitute a total length of 51 kilobases and are tandemly linked. The beta-MYHC-encoding gene, predominantly expressed in the normal human ventricle and also in slow-twitch skeletal muscle, is located 4.5 kilobases upstream of the alpha-MYHC-encoding gene, which is predominantly expressed in normal human atrium. We have determined the nucleotide sequences of the beta form of the MYHC gene, which is 100% homologous to the cardiac MYHC cDNA clone (pHMC3). It is unlikely that the divergence of a few nucleotide sequences from the cardiac beta-MYHC cDNA clone (pHMC3) reported in a MYHC cDNA clone (pSMHCZ) from skeletal muscle is due to a splicing mechanism. This finding suggests that the same beta form of the cardiac MYHC gene is expressed in both ventricular and slow-twitch skeletal muscle. The promoter regions of both alpha- and beta-MYHC genes, as well as the first four coding regions in the respective genes, have also been sequenced. The sequences in the 5'-flanking region of the alpha- and beta-MYHC-encoding genes diverge extensively from one another, suggesting that expression of the alpha- and beta-MYHC genes is independently regulated.\r"

Introduction of transcripts from either plasmid into tobacco mesophyll protoplasts resulted in the accumulation of TVMV coat protein and RNA. Neither coat protein nor viral RNA accumulated in protoplasts inoculated with linearized cDNA or with in vitro transcripts synthesized in the absence of 7-methylguanosine(5')triphospho(5')guanosine (m7GpppG).

  ".U": "89264455\r", 
  ".W": "This study describes a type of retroviral vector called double-copy (DC) vector that was designed to improve the expression of transduced genes. The unique feature of DC vectors is that the transduced gene is inserted within the U3 region of the 3' long terminal repeat (LTR). Consequently, in the infected cell the gene is duplicated and transferred to the 5' LTR. The important result is that in its new position the gene is placed outside the retroviral transcriptional unit, eliminating or at least reducing the negative effects of the retroviral transcriptional unit. The utility of the DC vector design was tested by using a 2.1-kilobase-pair (kbp)-long adenosine deaminase (ADA; EC 3.5.4.4) minigene that was inserted into the 3' LTR of the N2 retroviral vector, generating a 2.7-kbp-long chimeric LTR. DNA blot analysis was used to show that the chimeric LTR was faithfully duplicated in cells infected with the corresponding virus, generating two copies of the ADA minigene, one copy in each LTR. Insertion of the ADA minigene into the 3' LTR of the N2 vector led to a 10- to 20-fold increase in ADA transcripts and human ADA isozyme synthesized in NIH 3T3 cells as compared to cells harboring the same vector in which the ADA minigene was inserted between the two LTRs. A similar increase in ADA expression was observed in two human lymphoid cell lines tested, HUT 78 and Raji. These results are consistent with previous observations that upstream promoters exert an inhibitory effect on promoters placed downstream and bear out the predictions used in the design of DC vectors. The use of DC vectors may contribute to the solution of the problems encountered in expressing retrovirally transduced genes in cultured cells and, in particular, when introduced into the live animal.\r"

  ".U": "89264456\r", 
  ".W": "The tyrosine-67 to phenylalanine mutated rat cytochrome c is similar to the unmutated protein in its spectral, reduction potential, and enzymic electron-transfer properties. However, the loss of the 695-nm band, characteristic of the ferric form of the normal low-spin physiologically active configuration, occurs 1.2 pH units higher on the alkaline side and 0.7 pH unit lower on the acid side. Similarly, the heme iron-methionine-80 sulfur bond is more stable to temperature, with the midpoint of the transition being 30 degrees C higher, corresponding to an increase in delta H of 5 kcal/mol (1 cal = 4.184 J), partially mitigated by an increase of 11 entropy units in delta S. Urea has only slightly different effects on the two proteins. These phenomena are best explained by considering that the loss of one of the three hydrogen-bonding side chains, tyrosine-67, asparagine-52, and threonine-78, which hold an internal water molecule on the \"left, lower front\" side of the protein [Takano, T. & Dickerson, R. E. (1981) J. Mol. Biol. 153, 95-115], is sufficient to prevent its inclusion in the mutant protein, leading to a more stable structure, and, as indicated by preliminary proton NMR two-dimensional phase-sensitive nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy analyses, a reorganization of this area. This hypothesis predicts that elimination of the hydrogen-bonding ability of residue 52 or 78 would also result in cytochromes c having similar properties. It is not obvious why the space-filling structure involving the internalized water molecule that leads to a destabilization energy of about 3 kcal/mol should be subject to extreme evolutionary conservation, when a more stable and apparently fully functional structure is readily available.\r"

This protein is encoded by the angR gene and maps in a 3.6-kilobase-pair pJM1 DNA region located downstream of the iron transport genes. Full expression of this gene occurs under iron-limiting conditions and requires a 2.9-kilobase-pair upstream region in cis that maps within the coding region of the OM2 outer membrane protein, essential for the transport of iron into the cell cytosol. Determination of the siderophore anguibactin levels as well as analysis of specific transcripts for anguibactin biosynthetic genes demonstrated that AngR and another transcriptional activator, Taf, regulate in a synergistic fashion the level of anguibactin production by activation of transcription of the anguibactin biosynthetic genes under iron-limiting conditions.\r"

The undeleted and deleted proteins were synthetically produced by transcription and translation in vitro. Undeleted preSOD-3 is translocated into isolated maize mitochondria with an efficiency of approximately 30%. Mature SOD-3 subunits are recovered from the matrix but not the membranes of subfractionated mitochondria. These subunits are assembled into the tetrameric holoenzyme. The modified SOD-3 precursors are imported into mitochondria at lower efficiencies than undeleted preSOD-3. The relative import efficiency appears to be dependent upon the deletion size. To our knowledge such analysis of a plant mitochondrial precursor protein has not been reported previously.\r"

The larger one, corresponding to a predicted polypeptide of 727 amino acid residues, is necessary and sufficient for expression of cadmium resistance. Comparison of the CadA amino acid sequence with known protein sequences suggested that CadA is a member of the E1E2 cation-translocating ATPases, similar to the K+-uptake ATPases of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. The sequence homology is lower but significant with other E1E2-type ATPases, including the H+-efflux ATPases of eukaryotic microbes and the Ca2+- and Na+/K+-ATPases of animals. A frame-shift mutation in the middle of the gene destroys the Cd2+-resistance phenotype. A detailed model for the putative CadA ATPase based on homologies to other E1E2 ATPases is presented and discussed.\r"

The cleavage reaction introduces the carbon atom of 14CN into the carboxyl-terminal fragment produced at each cleavage of the polypeptide chain. Peptides containing the amino terminus of the intact protein are not labeled; all other peptides are labeled at their amino termini. Partial cleavage of a protein followed by gel electrophoresis and autoradiography identifies a ladder of unlabeled peptides that maps positions of the cysteine residues relative to the protein amino terminus. To map individual proteins present in a complex mixture, the polypeptides are cyanolated in solution with 14CN, and the modified proteins are separated by discontinuous SDS/PAGE. The gel is stained, and the desired protein is excised, cleaved at cysteine within the gel slice, and mapped in the second dimension by gel electrophoresis. These techniques are demonstrated with proteins of known sequence containing from zero to five cysteine residues. The cysteine \"landmark map\" should be particularly useful in locating protein modifications, in questions of protein similarity, and in mapping functional domains. A strategy is also presented for locating other residues in the polypeptide, for which specific cleavage methods exist.\r"

The mature ABP, composed of 163 residues with a molecular weight of 18,352, contains a potential N-glycosylation site (Asn-Thr-Thr), and the COOH-terminal tetrapeptide (Lys-Asp-Glu-Leu) may be a signal for retention of the ABP in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum.\r"

To define the required cellular proteins, we have made use of a cell-free system that supports the replication of plasmid DNA molecules containing the SV40 origin of replication. We report here the purification from HeLa cell extracts of replication protein C (RP-C), a previously undescribed protein that is required to reconstitute efficient DNA replication in vitro. Highly purified preparations of RP-C contain two closely related polypeptides of 32 and 34 kDa. Preincubation of purified RP-C with T antigen and the DNA template largely eliminates the delay normally observed before the onset of rapid DNA synthesis. In addition, RP-C stimulates the unwinding of duplex DNA molecules containing the SV40 replication origin in a reaction that requires T antigen and a single-stranded DNA binding protein. These observations suggest that RP-C is involved in the initial steps of SV40 DNA replication in vitro.\r"

  ".U": "89264474\r", 
  ".W": "We report a complete thermodynamic characterization of the impact of abasic and anucleosidic lesions on the stability, conformation, and melting behavior of a DNA duplex. The requisite thermodynamic data were obtained by using a combination of spectroscopic and calorimetric techniques to investigate helix-to-coil transitions in a family of DNA duplexes of the form d(CGCATGAGTACGC).d(GCGTACXCATGCG), where X corresponds to a thymidine residue in the parent Watson-Crick duplex and to an abasic or anucleosidic site in the modified duplexes. The data derived from these studies reveal that incorporation of an abasic site into a DNA duplex dramatically reduces the duplex stability, transition enthalpy, and transition entropy. The magnitudes of these lesion-induced effects are greater than one would expect based on simple nearest-neighbor considerations. Nearly identical thermodynamic data are obtained when the modified duplex contains an anucleosidic site rather than an abasic site. This observation suggests that the thermodynamic impact of these lesions primarily results from removal of the base rather than the sugar ring. Significantly, the melting cooperativities of the abasic and anucleosidic derivatives are identical with each other and with the corresponding unmodified Watson-Crick parent duplex. This result suggests that the phosphodiester backbone, rather than the base-sugar network, serves as the primary propagation path for the communication of cooperative melting effects. We propose molecular interpretations for the thermodynamic data based on the structural picture that has emerged from the NMR studies of Patel and coworkers on the same family of modified and unmodified DNA duplexes [Kalnik, M.W., Chang, C.-N., Grollman, A.P. & Patel, D.J.

Fibrin II monomer minimally affected the uncatalyzed rate of thrombin inactivation showing a reduction in the second-order rate constant by a factor of only 1.6. Fibrinogen and the product of plasmin degradation of fibrinogen, fragment E, at 6 microM concentrations also decreased the second-order rate constant for heparin-catalyzed thrombin inactivation, but by factors of only 2.7 and 1.9, respectively. On the basis of these observations it is proposed that protection of thrombin from inactivation by heparin-antithrombin III by fibrin II monomer can explain the limited efficacy of heparin in preventing coronary reocclusion in patients treated with tissue plasminogen activator and other fibrinolytic agents.\r"

We have shown that the first 248 base pairs of the 422(aP2) gene promoter (which lacks a consensus cAMP response element) are sufficient to confer inducibility of a reporter gene by cAMP in preadipocytes. We now demonstrate by deletion analysis that this DNA segment contains overlapping negative and positive regulatory elements. The positive regulatory element contains a consensus activator protein 1 (AP-1) binding sequence. The effect of the negative regulatory element is observed in preadipocytes but not in fully differentiated adipocytes, suggesting that it is an important component of the regulatory mechanism governing expression of the 422(aP2) gene during differentiation. cAMP activates the 422(aP2) promoter in confluent preadipocytes but not in proliferating preadipocytes or fully differentiated adipocytes. The stimulatory effect of cAMP is abolished by deletions that enter the negative element, suggesting that cAMP increases expression by relieving the inhibitory effect of the negative regulatory element.\r"

Three changes in the amino acid sequence were found to be unique to the potato calmodulin sequence. In our earlier studies we showed the involvement of calcium and calmodulin in potato tuberization. The pPCM-1 clone was used as a probe to study the expression of calmodulin mRNA during tuberization and to monitor calmodulin mRNA level in various parts of the potato plant. Stolon tips showed the highest levels of calmodulin mRNA, suggesting a role for calmodulin in the tuberization process. In addition, pPCM-1 was used to investigate the effect of auxin and light on calmodulin gene expression in auxin-responsive strawberry fruit and light-responsive Merit corn roots, respectively. Both auxin and light signals were found to increase the level of mRNA for calmodulin. These results suggest that the altered calmodulin gene expression could be one of the molecular events involved in the signal transduction process in plants.\r"

These sublines represent a model system for study of the processes leading to hormonal autonomy. The cells form growing tumors in ovariectomized athymic nude mice in the absence of estrogen supplementation but retain some responsivity to estrogen as determined by stimulation of the rate of tumor growth in vivo and by induction of progesterone receptor. An ovarian-independent but hormone-responsive phenotype may occur early in the natural progression to hormone-independent and unresponsive growth in breast cancer. We observed no change in the affinity or decrease in the level of expression of estrogen receptors and progesterone receptors among the sublines and the parental cells. Epidermal growth factor receptors are not overexpressed in ovarian-independent cells. Thus, altered hormone receptor expression may be a late event in the acquisition of a hormone-independent and unresponsive phenotype. Sublines isolated by in vivo but not in vitro selection are more invasive than the parental cells both in vivo and across an artificial basement membrane in vitro. Thus, as yet unknown tumor-host interactions may be important in the development of an invasive phenotype. Furthermore, acquisition of the ovarian-independent and invasive phenotypes can occur independently.\r"

  ".W": "The malignant growth potential of embryonal carcinoma cells may be controlled by environmental factors. For example, embryonal carcinoma cells placed into normal blastocysts may not exhibit the continued growth expected of malignant cells but rather may lose all aspects of the malignant phenotype and become apparently normal embryonic cells. Loss of the malignant phenotype of embryonal carcinoma cells occurs early in these injected blastocysts and has been used as the basis of assays to study the mechanisms of regulation of embryonal carcinoma by the blastocyst. In this regard, P19, an embryonal carcinoma that makes midgestation chimeras, was regulated by blastocele fluid plus contact with trophectoderm but not by blastocele fluid plus contact with inner cell mass (ICM). In contrast, ECa 247, which makes trophectoderm, was regulated by exposure to blastocele fluid plus contact with trophectoderm or ICM. During the course of these experiments, dead embryonal carcinoma and ICM cells were observed, and blastocele fluid was then shown to kill ECa 247 and normal ICM cells of early blastocysts with trophectodermal potential. P19 cells and ICM cells with potential to make the embryo were not killed by blastocele fluid. Programmed cell death occurs in the ICM of the blastocyst during the transition from early (when ICM has the potential to make trophectoderm) to late (when the ICM lacks the potential to make trophectoderm). It is postulated that this programmed cell death is designed to eliminate redundant ICM cells with trophectodermal potential, and its mechanism of action is mediated by epigenetic factors in blastocele fluid.\r"

In addition, approximately to 8 hr after PLC injection, NIH 3T3 fibroblasts appeared spindle-shaped, refractile, and highly vacuolated, displaying a morphology similar to transformed cells. The morphologic transformation was apparent for 26-30 hr after which the injected cells reverted back to a normal phenotype. Microinjected PLC at a high concentration (1 mg/ml) was cytotoxic, dissolving the cytoplasmic membrane and leaving behind cellular ghosts. PLC is a key regulatory enzyme involved in cellular membrane signal transduction. Introduction of exogenous PLC into NIH 3T3 cells by microinjection induced a growth and oncogenic potential, as demonstrated by the ability of microinjected PLC (approximately 10,000 molecules per cell) to override the cellular G0 block, inducing DNA synthesis and morphologic transformation of growth-arrested fibroblast cells.\r"

Treatment of animal blastomeres with LiCl caused them to display a morphology resembling that of isolated vegetal blastomeres. The effects of separation of animal and vegetal blastomeres and of treatment of animal blastomeres with LiCl were examined at the molecular level using gut alkaline phosphatase and a spicule matrix protein RNA as markers of differentiation.

Prestalk cells are distinguished from prespore cells by a low level of expression of a glycoantigen on their surfaces and by reduced intercellular cohesion. We examined the possible significance of these differences, using the modB mutation, which eliminates this glycoantigen genetically, leading to reduced intercellular cohesion, modB mutant cells were allowed to develop together with normal cells to form chimeric slugs. Mutant cells labeled by feeding with fluorescent bacteria were highly enriched in the prestalk cell zone at the anterior end of the slug. In contrast, normal cells, if in a minority, were concentrated in the rear part of the prespore cell zone. Immunoblot analysis and cell-by-cell double-label immunofluorescence of these mixtures showed that mutant cells underproduced several prespore cell markers. Mutant cells tended not to form spores in chimeras unless they exceeded a threshold proportion of ca. 30%. However, mutant cells showed no tendency to produce excess prestalk cells when allowed to develop alone. These findings are most simply explained by postulating that reduced glycoantigen expression and intercellular adhesion encourage a more anterior cell localization, which in turn causes differentiation into a prestalk cell. Since normal prestalk cells also show reduced glycoantigen expression and intercellular adhesion, this suggests that a similar mechanism may contribute to pattern formation during normal development.\r"

  ".W": "We have previously reported that anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH), also known as Mullerian-inhibiting substance, the testicular glycoprotein involved in regression of the Mullerian ducts of the male fetus, induces the formation of seminiferous cord-like structures in fetal ovaries exposed to it in organ culture. We have now investigated the effect of bovine AMH, purified to homogeneity, on ovarian endocrine differentiation. Ovine fetal ovaries exposed to AMH release testosterone instead of estradiol, an endocrine sex reversal due to suppression of aromatase activity. AMH dramatically decreases the conversion rate of testosterone to estradiol and also decreases total aromatase activity, as measured by the tritiated water technique. AMH acts by decreasing aromatase biosynthesis rather than by blocking enzyme activity, as suggested by the relatively long period of AMH exposure required to produce an effect. In the rabbit fetal ovary, aromatase activity is AMH-responsive during the whole gestational period. The basal steroidogenic activity of rat fetal ovaries is extremely low but can be markedly increased by cAMP. AMH completely blocks the effect of cAMP. Taken together, our results suggest that AMH plays a pivotal role in both morphological and endocrine gonadal sex differentiation.\r"

  ".W": "The chemotherapeutic agent chlorambucil was found to be more effective than x-rays or any chemical investigated to date in inducing high yields of mouse germ-line mutations that appear to be deletions or other structural changes. Induction of mutations involving seven specific loci was studied after exposures of various male germ-cell stages to chlorambucil at 10-25 mg/kg. A total of 60,750 offspring was scored. Mutation rates in spermatogonial stem cells were not significantly increased over control values; this negative result is not attributable to selective elimination of mutant cells. Mutations were, however, clearly induced in treated post-stem-cell stages, among which marked variations in mutational response were found. Maximum yield occurred after exposure of early spermatids, with approximately 1% of all offspring carrying a specific-locus mutation in the 10 mg/kg group. The stage-response pattern for chlorambucil differs from that of all other chemicals investigated to date in the specific-locus test. Thus far, all but one of the tested mutations induced by chlorambucil in post-stem-cell stages have been proved deletions or other structural changes by genetic, cytogenetic, and/or molecular criteria. Deletion mutations have recently been useful for molecular mapping and for structure-function correlations of genomic regions. For generating presumed large-lesion germ-line mutations at highest frequencies, chlorambucil may be the mutagen of choice.\r"

The cloning of one or more of these loci would contribute significantly to our understanding of the genetic control of development and maintenance of affected cell types. We report here identification of a transgenic mouse line with an insertional mutation that is allelic with pcd and manifests histopathologic features indistinguishable from those of the spontaneous mutation.

Equally precise hybrids were formed with human and mandrill DNA (Old World monkey) but not with spider monkey DNA (New World). These measurements as well as reassociation kinetics show the presence in mandrill DNA of many precise class Alu sequences that are very similar or identical in quantity and sequence to those in human DNA. Human and mandrill are moderately distant species with a single-copy DNA divergence of about 6%. Nevertheless, their recently inserted Alu sequences arise by retroposition of transcripts of source genes with nearly identical sequences. Apparently a gene present in our common ancestor at the time of branching was inherited and highly conserved in sequence in both the lineage of Old World monkeys and the lineage of apes and man.\r"

In the study presented here, we used the genomic sequencing method to detect 5-methyl-2'-deoxycytidine (m5dC) residues in 5'-CG-3' sequences other than the 5'-CCGG-3' (Hpa II) sites. The patterns of methylation in all 5'-CG-3' sequences over a region of about 180 base pairs required for gene activity in the late E2A promoter of integrated Ad2 DNA were determined in cell lines that carry this promoter in an active or inactive state. In cell lines HE1 and uc2, the late E2A promoter is active and all thirteen 5'-CG-3' sequences between positions +24 and -160 are unmethylated. In cell line HE2, the same promoter is permanently shut off and all 5'-CG-3' sequences are methylated in both strands. Thus, the inverse correlation is perfect in these cell lines over a region of about 180 base pairs in the late E2A promoter. The same promoter segment was analyzed in cell lines mc23 and mc40, in which a late E2A promoter-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) gene construct had been genomically fixed after in vitro 5'-CCGG-3' methylation and subsequent transfection. In cell line mc23, the preimposed methylation pattern was stable and the CAT gene was inactive. Genomic sequencing confirmed the presence of m5dC in the 5'-CCGG-3' sequences and revealed the spreading of methylation to neighboring 5'-CG-3' sequences along the entire promoter. Some of these sites were hemimethylated. In cell line mc40, several of the 120 integrated copies became demethylated in positions +24 and +6, but the promoter was methylated in some of the copies upstream of position -50. Cell line mc40 expressed the CAT gene.\r"

Degenerate oligonucleotide mutagenesis provided single base substitutions at every position in the element and a number of multiple base substitutions. The effects of these changes were determined in transient expression assays with tobacco and maize protoplasts. The majority of single and double base changes had little effect on the activity of the octopine synthase enhancer, but nearly all mutants with more than two base changes had low to essentially no activity. There were five positions where particular single base changes resulted in a 4- to 10-fold loss in enhancer activity. The distribution of these positions within the palindrome was asymmetric. Single base deletions had essentially no activity, demonstrating that the octopine synthase enhancer cannot tolerate internal changes in spacing. We find a strong correlation between mutant phenotype and reduced binding of a protein factor, suggesting that the DNA-protein complex is responsible for the transcriptional enhancement; the functionally active form of the DNA-protein complex probably involves more than a single protein molecule. The mutants exhibit similar phenotypes in protoplasts of both tobacco and maize, implying conservation of the DNA-protein interactions of the ocs enhancer sequence in monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous plants.\r"

The SA11-4F variant formed large plaques in the presence of protease, formed small clear plaques in the absence of protease, and grew to high titer in the presence of protease when compared to our standard wild type (SA11 clone 3). To determine the genome segment of the rotavirus SA11 variant 4F that encoded the unique protease-associated phenotypes of the variant, reassortants were generated that segregated the outer capsid genes of 4F onto a genetic background derived from either the bovine rotavirus B223 or our standard SA11 wild type (clone 3), both of which have contrasting protease-associated phenotypes. The parental and reassortant viruses were examined to determine which genes from the 4F variant encoded the ability (i) to form large plaques in the presence of protease, (ii) to form small clear plaques in the absence of exogenous protease, and (iii) to grow to significantly higher titer in the presence of protease. These phenotypes could be transferred to a clone 3 genetic background by a single genome segment from the 4F variant segment 4. However, in the 4F/B223 reassortants a different and unexpected situation was found. On a B223 genetic background the same phenotypes segregated with a combination of a minimum of two 4F genome segments, segments 4 and 9. These results indicate that the recipient genetic background onto which the genes of a donor rotavirus are reassorted can affect the phenotypes conferred by the presence of the donor segments. Thus, the results of segregation mapping experiments using reassortant viruses should be interpreted with caution.\r"

Based on the consensus nucleotide sequence and deduced amino acid sequence of the cDNA, the mouse BMMC proteoglycan peptide core is 16.7 kDa and contains a 21-amino acid glycosaminoglycan attachment region consisting of alternating serine and glycine residues. When the predicted amino acid sequence of the mouse BMMC proteoglycan peptide core was compared with the predicted amino acid sequences of the homologous molecules expressed in RBL-1 cells and in human promyelocytic leukemia HL-60 cells, the mouse-derived sequence was more closely homologous to the rat sequence than the human sequence except for the length of the serine-glycine repeat region. The N terminus was found to be a highly conserved region of the molecule in the three species, suggesting that this region is important for the structure, function, and/or metabolism of this family of proteoglycans. Nucleotide sequences within the 5' and 3' untranslated regions of the mouse, rat, and human proteoglycan cDNA were conserved. That similar sequences were also present in the corresponding regions of a cDNA that encodes a rat mast cell protease suggests that particular nucleotide sequences may be important for regulation of expression of those proteins that are destined to reside in secretory granules.\r"

  ".W": "A thymic stromal cell clone, MRL104.8a, expresses class I as well as class II H-2k antigens after exposure to gamma-interferon. This clone also produces thymic stroma-derived T-cell growth factor (TSTGF), which is distinct from other known interleukins and is capable of promoting the growth of various antigen-specific helper T cell (Th) clones without requiring a specific antigen or interleukin 2. When the keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH)-specific, I-Ek-restricted Th clone 9-16 was cultured on an Ia (I-Ak and I-Ek)-expressing MRL104.8a monolayer, potent proliferation of the 9-16 cells was induced by TSTGF produced by the monolayer. In contrast, the addition of KLH resulted in lethal growth inhibition of Th clone 9-16 cells. Another Th clone that is KLH-specific but I-Ab-restricted was capable of proliferating on the Iak-expressing MRL104.8a monolayer whether or not KLH was present. More importantly, death of Th clone 9-16 cells cultured on a MRL104.8a monolayer in the presence of KLH was almost completely prevented by the addition of anti-I-Ek or anti-CD3 monoclonal antibodies, which are capable of blocking antigen recognition by the T-cell receptor. However, when Th clone 9-16 cells were cultured in the presence of KLH but on a monolayer of MRL28.8a cells, another thymic stromal clone that expresses a comparable amount of I-Ek antigen but produces a marginal amount of TSTGF, cells did not die; a lethal effect was induced by adding TSTGF. These results indicate that the TSTGF-producing and Ia-expressing thymic stromal cells induce the continuous proliferation or selective elimination of each T-cell clone, depending on whether the T-cell receptor is stimulated by the relevant antigen associated with Ia molecules expressed on the stromal cell surface.\r"

We have isolated and sequenced a set of overlapping cDNA clones for human synexin. The derived amino acid sequence of synexin reveals strong homology in the C-terminal domain with a previously identified class of calcium-dependent membrane binding proteins. These include endonexin II, lipocortin I, calpactin I heavy chain (p36), protein II, and calelectrin 67K. The Mr 51,000 synexin molecule can be divided into a unique, highly hydrophobic N-terminal domain of 167 amino acids and a conserved C-terminal region of 299 amino acids. The latter domain is composed of alternating hydrophobic and hydrophilic segments. Analysis of the entire structure reveals possible insights into such diverse properties as voltage-sensitive calcium channel activity, ion selectivity, affinity for phospholipids, and membrane fusion.\r"

  ".W": "We have developed an animal model to elucidate the acute effects of perfusion abnormalities on muscle metabolism induced by different density-defined classes of erythrocytes isolated from sickle cell anemia patients. Technetium-99m (99mTc)-labeled, saline-washed normal (AA), homozygous sickle (SS), or high-density SS (SS4) erythrocytes were injected into the femoral artery of the rat and quantitative 99mTc imaging, 31P magnetic resonance spectroscopy by surface coil at 2 teslas, and 1H magnetic resonance imaging at 0.15 tesla were performed. Between 5 and 25 microliters of SS4 cells was trapped in the microcirculation of the thigh (or 1-6 x 10(7) cells per cubic centimeter of tissue). In contrast, fewer SS discocytes (SS2) or AA cells were trapped (an equivalent packed cell volume of less than 6.7 microliters and 0.3 microliters, respectively). After injection of SS4 cells an initial increase in inorganic phosphate was observed in the region of the thigh served by the femoral artery, intracellular pH decreased, and subsequently the proton relaxation time T1 reached a broad maximum at 18-28 hr. When T1 obtained at this time was plotted against the volume of cells trapped, an increase of T1 over the control value of 411 +/- 48 msec was found that was proportional to the number of cells trapped. We conclude that the densest SS cells are most effective at producing vasoocclusion. The extent of the change detected by 1H magnetic resonance imaging is dependent on the amount of cells trapped in the microcirculation and the magnitude of the initial increase of inorganic phosphate.\r"

  ".W": "The cotton rat Sigmodon hispidus has provided an animal model of adenovirus pneumonia that permits investigation of the viral gene products required to produce the disease and the molecular mechanisms effecting the damage. This study was carried out to test the hypothesis that early region 3 (E3) of the adenovirus genome plays a critical role in pathogenesis of the virus's disease process even though none of its gene products are essential for its replication. Mutants whose E3 region is largely deleted (i.e., H2dl801 and H5dl327) replicated like wild-type virus in the cotton rats' lungs, but the lymphocyte and macrophage/monocyte inflammatory response was markedly increased. Viruses containing mutations that ablated production of the 19-kDa glycoprotein had the same effect as H2dl801 and H5dl327. However, mutants with deletions in the other E3 open reading frames, some of which encode known proteins, did not differ from wild-type virus in their pathogenic properties. The 19-kDa glycoprotein markedly reduces expression of the class I major histocompatibility complex antigens on the surface of infected cells. A complete correlation was found between those mutants that had increased pathogenic effects and those that lost the ability to reduce transport of the class I major histocompatibility complex antigens to surface of infected cells (i.e., all mutants unable to express the 19-kDa glycoprotein). H5sub304, which has a deletion between 83.2 and 85.1 map units in the E3B region and expresses the 19-kDa glycoprotein, did not increase the extent of pneumonia but qualitatively changed the inflammatory response in that increased numbers of polymorphonuclear leukocytes accumulated, often in small foci.\r"

In this study we have characterized vesicular GABA and glycine uptakes in the cerebrum and spinal cord, respectively. We present evidence that GABA and glycine are each taken up into isolated synaptic vesicles in an ATP-dependent manner and that the uptake is driven by an electrochemical proton gradient. Uptake for both amino acids exhibited kinetics with low affinity (Km in the millimolar range) similar to vesicular glutamate uptake. The ATP-dependent GABA uptake was not inhibited by the putative amino acid neurotransmitters glycine, taurine, glutamate, or aspartate or by GABA analogs, agonists, and antagonists. Similarly, ATP-dependent glycine uptake was hardly affected by GABA, taurine, glutamate, or aspartate or by glycine analogs or antagonists. The GABA uptake was not affected by chloride, which is in contrast to the uptake of the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate, whereas the glycine uptake was slightly stimulated by low concentrations of chloride. Tissue distribution studies indicate that the vesicular uptake systems for GABA, glycine, and glutamate are distributed in different proportions in the cerebrum and spinal cord. These results suggest that the vesicular uptake systems for GABA, glycine, and glutamate are distinct from each other.\r"

This chronic treatment resulted in a clinically mild hypervitaminosis that did not affect the content of calmodulin, the 28-kDa calbindin-D, and S-100. Also the concentration of parvalbumin in the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, and kidney remained unchanged. On the other hand, parvalbumin was increased about 50% in the caudate putamen of hypervitaminotic animals as compared to controls. Our results indicate that the metabolism of parvalbumin in the caudate putamen can be influenced by variations of the blood level of this steroid hormone.\r"

To map the viral DNA sequences encoding the determinant of neurological degeneration, we constructed chimeric viruses in vitro with parental genomes from Cas-Br-E MuLV and from nonparalytogenic MuLVs. We found that a 1.5-kilobase-pair env Cas-Br-E fragment was sufficient to confer the full paralysis-inducing potential to chimeric viruses. This region encodes the 19 carboxyl-terminal residues of the leader sequence, all of gp70, and the 45 amino-terminal residues of the transmembrane protein (p15E). Within this env region, we identified a 372-base-pair fragment which was necessary for the full paralysis-inducing potential of the virus and which influenced the development of the disease in a strain-dependent manner. This domain encodes the 19 carboxyl-terminal residues of the leader peptide and the first 67 amino-terminal residues of gp70. We propose that Cas-Br-E MuLV induces spongiform degeneration through binding of its gp70 to a specific cellular receptor.\r"

The isolated protein reacts strongly with the mouse monoclonal antibody G2-09 and has a molecular weight of approximately 17,000 and an isoelectric point of pH 4.9. The N terminus is blocked, but tryptic digestion releases 28 peptides, 8 of which have been sequenced. The total known residues add up to more than two-thirds of the entire 140-residue protein, estimated from amino acid composition, and show no sequence homology with any known protein. Reversible thermal renaturation greatly enhances its biological activity. The purified protein stimulates differentiation of normal neurons as well as glial cells. It inhibits the proliferation of the N-18 neuroblastoma line and the C6 glioma line while promoting their phenotypic expression. We designate this protein glia maturation factor beta.\r"

In confirmation of our previous work on relay cells, we found them to be electronically compact; thus a postsynaptic potential generated anywhere in a relay cell's dendritic arbor spreads with relatively little attenuation throughout the arbor and to its soma. An interneuron is very different. Its arbor is much more extensive electronically with the result that a postsynaptic potential significantly affects only local areas of the dendritic arbor, and only inputs to proximal dendrites or to the soma will much affect the soma. Since much of the interneuron's synaptic output derives from dendritic terminals that are both presynaptic and postsynaptic, its dendritic arbor may contain many local circuits that perform neuronal computations independently of each other, and this processing might be invisible to the soma. Furthermore, these interneurons possess conventional axonal outputs, and these contact postsynaptic profiles that are quite different from the postsynaptic targets of the dendritic terminals. Presumably, the axonal output reflects the integrated computations performed on proximal synaptic inputs, and it uses conventional action potentials to convey this output. We suggest that the interneuron does double duty: its dendritic arbor is used for many independent local circuits that perform one set of neuronal computations, and its axonal output represents conventional neuronal integration of proximal synaptic inputs.\r"

Shortly thereafter, and roughly coincident with the onset of RVD, two types of voltage-dependent channels open at the new resting potential; these are (i) a delayed-rectifier type K+ [K+(DR)] channel and (ii) a large-conductance anion channel. We suggest that opening of the C+(SA) channel may contribute to the volume \"sensor\" mechanism, while the depolarization-induced opening of the K+(DR) and anion channels may constitute a significant K+ salt exit pathway, operating in RVD.\r"

The average virulence of isolates collected from the more resistant host population was greater than the average virulence of the isolates collected from the less resistant host population; also the least virulent haplotype, which made up 19% of the pathogen population collected from the less resistant host population, accounted for only 0.3% of the isolates collected from the more resistant host population. It was concluded that the genetic systems of the barley host and fungal pathogen interacted in a complementary fashion and that the genetic structures of both the host and pathogen populations were shaped by coevolutionary processes featuring interactions among loci affecting many different traits, including interactions among host resistance genes and pathogen virulence genes.\r"

T-antigen-induced changes in origin DNA conformation can be visualized as specific and discrete topologic changes in origin DNA minicircles. We discovered three origin-T-antigen complexes defined by changes in DNA linking number. These complexes probably reflected essential early steps in the initiation of DNA replication since their formation required DNA sequences that are necessary for DNA replication but do not affect T-antigen binding. There are striking parallels between the T antigen-origin interactions uncovered by this assay and the interactions between the DnaA, -B, and -C proteins and the Escherichia coli replication origin, suggesting a significant evolutionary conservation in the mechanisms that initiate DNA replication.\r"

This species, termed form UR, comigrates on chloroquine-containing agarose gels with the upper part of the previously described heterogeneous highly unwound circular DNA, form U. As with form U, formation of form UR is dependent upon the SV40 tumor (T) antigen. Pulse-chase experiments demonstrate that the first species to incorporate labeled deoxyribonucleotides comigrates with form UR. Restriction analyses of the products of the pulse-chase experiments show that initiation occurs at the SV40 origin and then proceeds outward in a bidirectional manner. These experiments establish form UR as the earliest detectable substrate for SV40 DNA replication and suggest that SV40 DNA replication initiates on an unwound species.\r"

Glucagon gene expression is regulated by a protein kinase C-dependent pathway in rat islet cell lines, whereas activation of the adenylate cyclase pathway in islet cell lines is without effect. To elucidate the factors important for the control of proglucagon biosynthesis in the intestine, we have studied proglucagon gene expression and proglucagon biosynthesis in rat intestine. Analysis of intestinal cDNA clones encoding preproglucagon indicated that pancreatic and intestinal glucagon mRNA transcripts were identical. The regulation of proglucagon gene expression in rat intestine differed markedly from that previously observed in islet cell lines. Phorbol esters increased the secretion of glucagon-like immunoreactive peptides (GLI) but had no effect on proglucagon mRNA levels in rat intestinal cells. Bombesin also increased the secretion of GLI without affecting proglucagon mRNA levels or biosynthesis. In contrast, dibutyryl cyclic AMP, forskolin, and cholera toxin increased both proglucagon mRNA levels and GLI biosynthesis and secretion, suggesting that proglucagon gene expression in the intestine is regulated by a cyclic AMP-dependent pathway. These observations suggest that tissue-specific differences in both the regulation of proglucagon gene expression and the posttranslational processing of proglucagon contribute to the diversity of glucagon gene expression.\r"

Phenobarbitone treatment of the animal strikingly increases this transcription, and the increase is blocked by cycloheximide (protein synthesis inhibitor) or CoCl2 (heme biosynthetic inhibitor) treatment of animals. This picture correlates very well with the reported cytochrome P-450b/e mRNA levels in vivo and run-on transcription rates in vitro under these conditions. The upstream region (from position -179) was assessed for protein binding with nuclear extracts by nitrocellulose filter binding, gel retardation, DNase I treatment (\"footprinting\"), and Western blot analysis. Phenobarbitone treatment dramatically increases protein binding to the upstream region, an increase once again blocked by cycloheximide or CoCl2 treatments. Addition of heme in vitro to heme-deficient nuclei and nuclear extracts restores the induced levels of transcription and protein binding to the upstream fragment, respectively. Thus, drug-mediated synthesis and heme-modulated binding of a transcription factor(s) appear involved in the transcriptional activation of the cytochrome P-450b/e genes, and an 85-kDa protein may be a major factor in this regard.\r"

We present evidence that this non-GpC-containing duplex binds two actinomycin D molecules in an apparently cooperative manner to form a complex that exhibits aberrant spectroscopic and calorimetric behavior. We propose that these observations are consistent with actinomycin D exhibiting a high-affinity, sequence-dependent DNA-binding mode distinct from its classic binding to isolated GpC sites.\r"

When the mutant genes were tested in the vector pi SVHSplac, which contains a short segment of the oriregion of simian virus 40, maximum expression was observed with as little as 36 base pairs of 5' flanking sequence, and the mutant bearing the exon I deletion was expressed very efficiently. However, when the genes were tested in a simple prokaryotic (pUC) vector, the expression was increased 3- to 4-fold by sequences between -36 and -159, and the exon I segment was absolutely required for expression. Gel mobility-shift and methylation interference analyses revealed that a nuclear factor specifically binds to a GGCTGCCATC sequence within this exon I segment. These results, taken together with other recent findings, indicate that the elements involved in transcriptional regulation of the rpL32 gene are distributed over a 200-base-pair region that spans the cap site. The contributions of some of these elements are apparently masked in the presence of simian virus 40 ori-region elements.\r"

It was highly enriched in alanine (28.4 mol %), contained an amino-terminal myristoylation consensus sequence, and included a 25-residue basic domain containing the known protein kinase C phosphorylation sites. Two mRNA species (2.6 and 4.4 kilobases) were most highly expressed in brain, spinal cord, spleen, and lung, in parallel with the distribution of immuno-reactive protein.

In the final step, air oxidation of the octahydroderivative was found to be optimal at pH 8. The synthetic product was shown to be physically and biologically indistinguishable from native material. It inhibits fibrinogen-dependent platelet aggregation stimulated by ADP with IC50 = 3.3 x 10(-8) M and also prevents aggregation initiated by thrombin, epinephrine, collagen, or platelet-activating factor. Reduction of purified synthetic echistatin to octahydroechistatin with dithiothreitol followed by air oxidation regenerated homogeneous echistatin in quantitative yield. This highly specific refolding strongly suggests that the linear sequence of octahydroechistatin contains all of the information that is required for the proper folding of the peptide. The sequence Arg24-Gly-Asp of echistatin occurs also in adhesive glycoproteins that bind to the platelet fibrinogen receptor--a heterodimeric complex composed of glycoproteins IIb and IIIa. In an effort to evaluate the role of this putative binding site we have synthesized analogs of echistatin with substitution of Arg-24. Replacement with ornithine-24 (Orn-24) resulted in an analog having a platelet aggregation inhibitory activity with IC50 = 1.05 x 10(-7) M. Substitution with Ala-24 gave IC50 = 6.1 x 10(-7) M. The inhibitory activity of the corresponding short sequence analogs Arg-Gly-Asp-Phe (IC50 = 6 x 10(-6) M), Orn-Gly-Asp-Phe (IC50 = 1.3 x 10(-4) M), and Ala-Gly-Asp-Phe (IC50 = 5.0 x 10(-4) M) was also determined. These results suggest that arginine plays a more important role in the binding of the tetrapeptide than in that of echistatin.\r"

The polypeptide encoded by the cDNA was synthesized by in vitro transcription and translation and identified by its comigration with authentic plakoglobin in two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. The identity was further confirmed by comparison of the deduced sequence with the directly determined amino acid sequence of two fragments from bovine plakoglobin. Analysis of the plakoglobin sequence showed the protein (744 amino acids; 81,750 Da) to be unrelated to any other known proteins, highly conserved between human and bovine tissues, and characterized by numerous changes between hydrophilic and hydrophobic sections. Only one kind of plakoglobin mRNA (3.4 kilobases) was found in most tissues, but an additional mRNA (3.7 kilobases) was detected in certain human tumor cell lines. This longer mRNA may be represented by a second type of plakoglobin cDNA, which contains an insertion of 297 nucleotides in the 3' non-coding region.\r"

By measuring the variation with temperature of the coupling free energy between the allosteric ligand and the substrate, it is possible to determine the enthalpic and entropic components that give rise to the coupling free energy. We have performed this analysis on two different K-type allosteric systems: the allosteric inhibition of rat liver phosphofructokinase by MgATP, and the allosteric activation of beef heart NAD+-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase by ADP. In both cases the coupling free energy arises as the net result of opposing enthalpic and entropic components, with the coupling enthalpy (delta Hax) favoring activation and the coupling entropy (delta Sax) favoring inhibition. For phosphofructokinase at 25 degrees C, the absolute value of T delta Sax is greater than the absolute value of delta Hax, and net inhibition of rat liver phosphofructokinase by MgATP is realized. For isocitrate dehydrogenase, delta Hax dominates; however, the net activation is substantially mitigated by the magnitude of T delta Sax. Hence, the coupling entropy plays an important role in establishing both the nature and magnitude of the allosteric response. We hypothesize that the negative coupling entropy arises from the particular constraint placed upon the internal dynamical properties of the enzyme by the simultaneous binding of both allosteric and substrate ligands.\r"

The distribution of detected counts is the convolution of a Poissonian continuous background with bursts arising from the passage of individual fluorophores through the focused laser beam. The autocorrelation function reveals single-molecule events and provides a criterion for optimizing experimental parameters. The transit time of fluorescent molecules through the 120-fl imaged volume was 800 microseconds. The optimal laser power (32 mW at 514.5 nm) gave an incident intensity of 1.8 x 10(23) photons.cm-2.s-1, corresponding to a mean time of 1.1 ns between absorptions. The mean incremental count rate was 1.5 per 100 microseconds for PE monomers and 3.0 for PE dimers above a background count rate of 1.0. The distribution of counts and the autocorrelation function for 200 fM monomer and 100 fM dimer demonstrate that single-molecule detection was achieved. At this concentration, the mean occupancy was 0.014 monomer molecules in the probed volume. A hard-wired version of this detection system was used to measure the concentration of PE down to 1 fM. This single-molecule counter is 3 orders of magnitude more sensitive than conventional fluorescence detection systems.\r"

The transformants appear to have an unlimited growth potential, and they form a disorganized epidermis when they are grafted as an epithelium onto athymic mice. These experiments clearly show that, in order to be transformed by a viral oncogene, the target cell need not be a stem cell.\r"

  ".W": "The mRNA encoding the mouse homolog of C/EBP, a rat DNA-binding protein that participates in activating a number of genes in hepatocytes, is present in liver cells at a far higher concentration than in most other cells, including spleen, kidney, muscle, and the majority of the brain. However, fat cells and intestinal cells contain 25-50% as much mRNA as liver cells. \"Run-on\" experiments show that the basis for the restricted cellular distribution of the mouse C/EBP mRNA is transcriptional regulation of the gene. We also show that disruption of cell-cell contacts incident to liver cell dispersion results in a prompt and extensive reduction in mouse C/EBP transcription as we had earlier shown to be the case for a group of 10 genes transcribed in a hepatocyte-specific fashion. In contrast, breaking cell contacts and plating the hepatocytes in culture leads to a prolonged increase in transcription of the Jun-B gene that encodes a widely distributed transcription factor. These results illustrate that the regulation of expression of a mammalian regulatory protein with limited tissue distribution is controlled at the level of transcription and depends on cell contacts.\r"

  ".W": "The coding region of the low density lipoprotein (LDL)-receptor gene from a patient (MM) with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) has been sequenced from six overlapping 500-base-pair amplified fragments of the cDNA from cultured skin fibroblasts. Two separate single nucleotide base changes from the normal sequence were detected. The first involved substitution of guanine for adenine in the third position of the codon for amino acid residue Cys-27 and did not affect the protein sequence. The second mutation was substitution of thymine for cytosine in the DNA for the codon for amino acid residue 664, changing the codon from CCG (proline) to CTG (leucine) and introducing a new site for the restriction enzyme PstI. MM is a true homozygote with two identical genes, and the mutation cosegregated with clinically diagnosed FH in his family in which first cousin marriages occurred frequently. The amino acid change occurs in the center of growth factor repeat C in the epidermal growth factor precursor-homology domain of the protein, a region of highly conserved sequence between bovine and human LDL receptors, and results in slowed, but complete, maturation of the precursor to the mature form of the receptor and, despite its remoteness from the ligand-binding domain, in impaired binding of LDL. LDL receptors in MM's skin fibroblasts bind less LDL than normal and with reduced affinity. Thus this naturally occurring single point mutation affects both intracellular transport of the protein and ligand binding and occurs in growth factor-like repeat C, a region that has not previously been found to influence LDL binding.\r"

Lp(a) represents a continuous quantitative genetic trait, the genetics of which are only poorly understood. Genetic variation at the apo(a) locus affects plasma Lp(a) levels and explains at least 40% of the variability of this trait. Lp(a) levels were found to be elevated 3-fold in the plasma from patients with the heterozygous form of familial hypercholesterolemia who have one mutant low density lipoprotein receptor gene. This elevation was not due to a higher frequency of those apo(a) types that are associated with high Lp(a) levels in familial hypercholesterolemia patients. Rather Lp(a) levels were elevated for each of the apo(a) phenotypes examined. The effects of the apo(a) and low density lipoprotein receptor genes on Lp(a) levels are not additive but multiplicative. This is a situation not commonly considered in quantitative human genetics. We conclude that Lp(a) levels in plasma may be determined by variation at more than one gene locus.\r"

In this paper, a general method is described for randomly generating genotypes at one or more marker loci, given observed phenotypes at loci linked among themselves and with the markers. The method is based on a well-known expansion of the multivariate probability of genotypes, given phenotypes, into a product of conditional univariate probabilities that may be viewed as corresponding to conditionally independent univariate random variables. This representation allows a recursive evaluation of the univariate probabilities that can be implemented in a surprisingly simple manner by carrying out successive \"risk calculations\" with respect to marker genotypes, given observed phenotypes and marker genotypes already generated. Potential applications to various unresolved problems are discussed. The method is applied to 28 published families analyzed for genetic linkage between hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy I and the Duffy (FY) blood group locus and confirms heterogeneity of hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy I. An implementation of the simulation methods developed in the LINKAGE program package will be available later in 1989.\r"

  ".W": "To study the origin of and the degree of T-cell antigen receptor (TCR) diversity of Thy-1+ dendritic epidermal cells (Thy-1+ dECs) in mice, we have developed a monoclonal antibody (mAb 536) to the gamma delta TCR. mAb 536 binds to and stimulates interleukin 2 secretion from Thy-1+ dEC but not cells that express TCR composed of alpha and beta chains. mAb 536 precipitates CD3-associated gamma and delta chains from lysates of radioiodinated Thy-1+ dECs. Analysis of a panel of hybridomas that express gamma delta TCR indicated that mAb 536 defines an epitope of the variable region (V gamma 3) gene product. Flow cytometric analysis revealed that expression of V gamma 3 in the adult mouse is restricted to cells in the epidermis, where essentially all Thy-1+ cells are V gamma 3+. The majority of CD3+ cells in the 14-day fetal thymus also express V gamma 3. These results indicate that the T-cell complement in epidermis are cells that express gamma delta TCR and that the diversity of antigens recognized by the cells might be restricted by the use of a single V gamma gene segment. Finally, the data raise the intriguing possibility that Thy-1+ dECs may arise from precursors that are among the first to emerge from the developing thymus. This suggests that V gene usage during thymocyte development is highly regulated and has important consequences on the tissue localization and function of the emerging cells. As in other developing tissues, it appears that programmed and transient gene expression determines the fate of the emerging cells.\r"

Four patients received single infusion of 10 mg (n = 2) or 40 mg (n = 2). Six patients received three infusion of 10 mg (n = 3) or 40 mg (n = 3) at 2-week intervals. The pharmacokinetics were similar at both dose levels and at the second and third infusions. The plasma disappearance curves were best fit by a two-compartment model having a mean alpha T1/2 of 17.5 hr (range 13-23 hr) and a mean beta T1/2 of 100.5 hr (range 65-139 hr). One patient who received three 40-mg doses of chimeric IgG-1K 17-1A mAb (day 0, 14, and 28) was the only patient to exhibit a detectable but modest antibody reactivity to chimera on days 63 and 84. The antibody reactivity was inhibited by murine 17-1A mAb, indicating that the antibody response was directed to the murine variable region of the chimera. The patients had no toxic or allergic reactions. This chimeric form of 17-1A mAb has an approximate 6-fold longer circulation time and appears to be substantially less immunogenic than its murine counterpart. These characteristics may provide an advantage in the clinical application of such chimeric molecules in therapeutic trials in humans.\r"

One of the amino acids thought to be important in mediating retinal information flow is gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). The findings of this study indicate that enzymatically isolated skate Muller cells are depolarized by GABA and the GABAA agonist muscimol and that the actions of these agents are reduced by bicuculline and picrotoxin. Membrane currents induced by GABA under voltage clamp were dose dependent, were associated with an increase in membrane conductance, and showed marked desensitization when the concentration of GABA exceeded 2.5 microM. The responses had a reversal potential close to that calculated for chloride, indicating that the currents were generated by ions passing through channels. These data support the view that skate Muller cells possess functional GABAA receptors. The presence of such receptors on retinal glia may have important implications for the role of Muller cells in maintaining the constancy of the extracellular milieu, for neuron-glia interactions within the retina, and for theories concerning the generation of the electroretinogram.\r"

Anti-Sm antibodies, the diagnostic hallmark of systemic lupus erythematosus, target the B'/B and D polypeptides of these snRNPs. We have used patient autoantibodies to clone a cDNA from a human fibroblast cDNA library that encodes the full length of a polypeptide identical with, or closely related to, polypeptide B. This cDNA is comprised of 1139 bases and contains an open reading frame of 855 nucleotides that is capable of encoding 285 amino acids. The first 223 amino acids at the NH2 terminus exhibit nearly complete homology with polypeptide N, a newly recognized brain- and heart-specific component of Sm snRNPs. The derived amino acid sequence for B differs from that of the N polypeptide primarily by a 50-amino acid insert 12 residues upstream from the homologous COOH termini of these polypeptides. The structural differences in these cDNAs for B and N may regulate tissue-specific alternative splicing mechanisms for mRNA. In addition, these clones make it possible to map in fine detail the most characteristic autoimmune responses of systemic lupus erythematosus.\r"

In sickle cells, an abnormal activation of this K+Cl- cotransport system was proposed to be involved in cell K+ loss and dehydration. We found that DIOA inhibited the abnormal sickle cell K+ loss and specifically reduced sickle cell density upon stimulation of the net outward K+Cl- cotransport--i.e., low pH, hypoosmolarity, and activation by N-ethylmaleimide. DIOA opens another therapeutic approach to sickle cell disease by inhibiting cell dehydration, which favors HbS polymerization and reduces erythrocyte deformability.\r"

Fetuses were delivered by caesarean section 3 weeks before term, exposed to normal light intensity and day/night cycles, and killed within the first postnatal month, together with age-matched controls that were delivered at term. We found that premature visual stimulation does not affect the rate of synaptic accretion and overproduction. Both of these processes proceed in relation to the time of conception rather than to the time of delivery. In contrast, the size, type, and laminar distribution of synapses were significantly different between preterm and control infants. The changes and differences in these parameters correlate with the duration of visual stimulation and become less pronounced with age. If visual experience in infancy influences the maturation of the visual cortex, it must do so predominantly by strengthening, modifying, and/or eliminating synapses that have already been formed, rather than by regulating the rate of synapse production.\r"

  ".W": "Although the total concentration of cGMP in rod outer segments is thought to be substantially greater than the free concentration, no quantitatively relevant site for the bound cGMP has been described in mammalian photoreceptors. We have found that preparations of purified bovine rod photoreceptor cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase (PDE) contain 1.8 +/- 0.3 mol of tightly bound cGMP per mol of PDE. When subunits of the purified PDE were separated by reverse-phase HPLC in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and acetonitrile, a peak of material having spectral properties characteristic of a guanine ring was seen. This material was identified as cGMP by comigration with authentic cGMP on HPLC, conversion to 5-GMP by trypsin-activated rod PDE, and conversion to guanosine by a combination of trypsin-activated PDE and 5'-nucleotidase-containing snake venom. When incubated with 1 microM [3H]cGMP, only 0.1 mol of [3H]cGMP bound per mol of purified PDE, presumably because nearly all binding sites were occupied by tightly bound endogenous cGMP carried through the purification. Scatchard plots of [3H]cGMP binding have indicated that two classes of binding sites are present on the rod PDE. The off-rate of cGMP from the slowly dissociating site is extremely slow; it has a t1/2 of approximately 4 hr at 37 degrees C. At lower temperatures, very little cGMP dissociates; the amount of [3H]cGMP bound to rod PDE after 2 hr at 4 degrees C was essentially the same as at the beginning of the incubation. The observation that stoichiometric amounts of cGMP are tightly bound to PDE accounts for the inability to purify the bovine rod PDE on cGMP affinity columns or to demonstrate stoichiometric high-affinity binding sites with [3H]cGMP. More significantly, the tightly bound cGMP may resolve the apparent discrepancy between the free and total cGMP concentrations of photoreceptor outer segments.\r"

The infusion of 1.2 mumol of Gly-Gln per 24 hr resulted in a significant increase in the acetylcholinesterase (AcChoEase; acetylcholine acetylhydrolase, EC 3.1.1.7) activity of the gastrocnemius muscles over that of rats that received DFP only. At a total dose of 3.6 mumol per 24 hr, a diminished result was obtained; at 0.36 mumol per 24 hr, no effect was detectable. These findings, together with earlier ones, suggest that the neurotrophic effect of Gly-Gln or a similar endogenous factor on AcChoEase synthesis is a general phenomenon at sites of cholinergic transmission.\r"

The purposes of this study were to assess isometric hip abduction torque in a sample of 40 healthy right-handed persons and to compare side differences in the HA muscles' neural drive index across a wide range of hip abduction angles. The neural drive index was defined as the magnitude of the normalized surface electromyographic activity divided by the absolute magnitude of a submaximal (20% of maximal) isometric HA muscle torque. Data were collected while subjects were positioned supine with trunk and pelvis stabilized. Statistical analysis of the data did not support earlier research on right HA muscle stretch-weakness; however, trends in the data suggest the need for further research.

  ".W": "The purpose of this study was to determine whether differences in sensation, ankle dorsiflexion (DF), and subtalar joint (STJ) motion exist between 1) diabetic patients with a history of plantar ulcer (DMW Group), 2) diabetic patients without a history of plantar ulcer (DMWO Group), and 3) a nondiabetic control group (NDC Group). There were 23, 23, and 24 subjects in the respective groups. The mean age for each group was 58, 63, and 60 years, respectively. The mean DF for each group was 2, 5, and 7 degrees, respectively, and the mean STJ motion was 26, 31, and 35 degrees, respectively. Mode values for sensation with Semmes-Weinstein monofilaments were 6.10, 5.07, and 4.17. The results indicate the DMW Group had significantly less sensation, DF, and STJ motion than the NDC Group (p less than .05). In the DWM Group, the ulceration was seen more often on the side with least motion. Limited DF and STJ motion may restrict the foot's ability to absorb shock and transverse rotation, contributing to the pathogenesis of plantar ulceration in the insensitive foot. Although these results demonstrate an association, not a causative relationship, we believe diabetic patients should be screened routinely for insensitivity and limited joint mobility at the feet and appropriate preventive measures should be taken.\r"

After treatment, the patient showed reduced TMJ pain, no jaw locking, and improved TMJ mobility. The patient also showed improved postural awareness. The results of treatment and the relatively minor cost of the appliance make the sharing of this case study potentially worthwhile for those clinicians treating patients with TMJ dysfunction.\r"

Treatment consisted of six one-minute activities that were equally divided between the side-lying and supported-sitting positions. The order of position and activities was randomly varied. A one-way analysis of variance for repeated measures revealed no significant changes in mean SaO2 as a function of the position or duration of intervention. Mean heart rate increased significantly as a result of intervention (p less than .0001), but there was no significant difference between the baseline and recovery phases. Further analysis indicated that the change in heart rate was not a function of duration of intervention. The results indicate that the preterm infants were able to tolerate the intervention without desaturation. The return of heart rate to baseline values during the recovery phase suggested a normal physiologic response to exercise. Despite some technical limitations, pulse oximetry is recommended to monitor preterm infants during physical therapy.\r"

The exercise program was designed to be performed by groups of subjects without using expensive equipment, large gymnasiums, or outdoor facilities. Fourteen women with an average age of 75.7 years trained for eight weeks. Five women with an average age of 71.8 years served as the control group. Submaximal graded exercise tolerance (GXT) step tests were performed before and after training. Significant decreases in submaximal GXT heart rate (HR), systolic blood pressure (SBP), and rate-pressure product (RPP) were observed in the exercise group. Predicted maximal aerobic power (MAP) increased 12.4% in the exercise group. The control group demonstrated significant decreases for submaximal GXT SBP and RPP, but not for HR. Predicted MAP for the control group decreased 3.3%. We concluded that this particular training regimen could be used safely and effectively with elderly subjects. The decrease in submaximal GXT HR, SBP, and RPP and the increase in predicted MAP indicate that a training effect can be expected when this exercise regimen is performed by sedentary elderly women.\r"

  ".W": "This study was undertaken to evaluate the influence of weight shift over the affected leg of standing hemiplegic patients on the electromyographic responses of the medial gastrocnemius and tibialis anterior muscles during continuous anterior-posterior movements of the base of support. Recordings were taken from 10 hemiplegic subjects and from 9 healthy subjects of comparable age. Each subject was first tested standing with both feet on a level surface and then with either leg (in healthy subjects) or the unaffected leg (in hemiplegic subjects) raised on a step. The second testing position caused unloading of the elevated leg and weight shift, that is, loading of the other leg. The measured variables were modulation of muscular activity, determined by a modulation index formulated for that purpose, and the relative amount of integrated electromyographic activity in each muscle. Changes in both variables in the uneven stance position as compared with even stance, occurred primarily in the unaffected (unloaded) leg in the hemiplegic subjects. These changes were comparable to changes in the unloaded leg of the healthy subjects. Thus, imposed loading on the affected leg of the hemiplegic subjects did not significantly improve either the reduced modulation or the relatively low IEMG activity of the investigated muscles. Further studies are required to evaluate the contribution of weight shift to recovery of postural responses in the affected leg of hemiplegic patients.\r"

This article presents an overview of the philosophy underlying qualitative research, a discussion of the application of qualitative methods, and a brief analysis of how to address reliability and validity concerns in qualitative research.

  ".W": "The primary purpose of this study was to compare the Caltrac accelerometer output with measured energy expenditure (Ee). Twenty-five volunteers (10 men, 15 women) walked on a level motor-driven treadmill at four different speeds (54, 81, 104, and 130 m.min-1) with the Caltrac device affixed to the waistline. Each of the four experimental trials lasted eight minutes, and the testing was completed within an hour. During the test, oxygen consumption (VO2) (in L.min-1 and in mL.kg-1.min-1) and nonprotein respiratory exchange ratio were monitored by the Beckman Horizon metabolic cart. The accelerometer output at the end of each exercise bout was also monitored and subsequently divided by 8 to convert the readings to counts.min-1. The mean VO2 (L.min-1) at steady state (ie, 6th-8th minutes of exercise) was converted to a caloric value. We obtained a moderate correlation coefficient (r) of .76 between the accelerometer output and the VO2 (mL.kg-1.min-1) and a high correlation coefficient of .92 between the Ee and the accelerometer readings. The Caltrac accelerometer output (counts.min-1) was significantly higher (p less than .01) than the Ee (kcal.min-1) at the four walking speeds. The difference between the accelerometer output and the Ee ranged from 13.3% to 52.9%. The data were further analyzed with linear, polynomial, multiple, and stepwise regression models. The results of the analyses revealed that the Caltrac accelerometer output is a valid predictor of Ee during level walking when the appropriate regression equation is used to adjust the values.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The operation is straightforward, quick, and safe. Thirty consecutive patients suffering from congenital absence of vagina have been treated. All flaps in the group, which were less bulky, survived completely. The follow-up survey was carried out from 6 months to more than 4 years postoperatively. There was no occurrence of hernia after surgery. The reconstructed vaginas in all patients were clean, soft, elastic, and expansible. Married patients indicated satisfaction with their sexual life.\r"

In addition, a greater number of primary sensory and motor neurons extended axons through the nerve guide in animals treated with aFGF. Thus the effect of aFGF on peripheral nerve regeneration is not simply an increase in axonal branching within the nerve guide tube. This is the first highly purified growth factor since nerve growth factor that has been shown to promote nerve regeneration in vivo. This experimental model provides a convenient and quantitative means to assess the effects of putative neuronotropic factors on peripheral nerve regeneration in vivo.\r"

Despite these measures, it was not possible to produce lymphedema in every case, possibly because of the presence of lymphaticovenous shunts and panvascular compensation mechanisms.\r"

This flap can reconstruct a large ptotic breast mound and fill the infraclavicular and axillary areas. The operative technique and a discussion of the method are presented. There are several advantages to the extended vertical rectus abdominis myocutaneous flap. First, the main advantage of this flap is its reliable vascular supply, which can reach to the infraclavicular and axillary areas. Second, the large volume of this flap can reconstruct the large ptotic breast, fill the infraclavicular hollow, and create an axillary fold. Third, no lower abdominal wall hernias have developed, and use of alloplastic abdominal wall reinforcement is not necessary. Finally, the simultaneous beneficial effect of horizontal abdominoplasty, which further enhances the patient's body image by narrowing the waist, is unique to this vertical abdominal flap. The disadvantages of this flap include (1) the midline abdominal scar, (2) an umbilical scar on the reconstructed breast, and (3) in principle, inappropriateness for the patient who desires pregnancy postoperatively.\r"

The smallest numbers of the dermal capillary density were noted in the calf and shin areas. These data support the hypothesis that random-pattern skin flaps can be safely raised longer in the face and neck than in other parts of the body.\r"

A surgical approach based on a new idea is described. The concept is that the musculature of the floor of the mouth is under increased tension and pushes the tongue upward and backward with secondary respiratory obstruction. The surgical approach consists of a subperiosteal release of the musculature of the floor of the mouth through a 2-cm submental incision. So far this procedure has been used in four patients with severe obstruction, and marked improvement has occurred postoperatively in all cases. This surgical technique is simple and is associated with little morbidity. It should lessen the need for tracheostomy, which carries a greater morbidity, especially in newborns. We think that this new surgical approach can significantly improve the outcome of the severe form of Pierre Robin anomalad.\r"

This series is comprised of 8 patients representing 7 bilateral reductions and 1 unilateral reduction for a total of 15 ears. Historically, surgery for macrotia consisted of resections of full-thickness wedges from the periphery of the ear. The surgical defect was repaired by directly approximating the wound edges. Additional removal of triangular or crescent-shaped segments from adjacent sides of the wound prevented the cupping of the reconstructed ear. Secondary deformities were not uncommon consequences. The most distressing were cruciform scars that defaced the lateral surface of the ear. These were frequently exacerbated by the uneven coaptation of the underlying cartilages. The current technique places the incisions at strategic locations where the scars that form are less conspicuous. The initial steps are essentially identical with the lateral transhelical approach to otoplasty for protruding ears. In some patients, both procedures have been combined during the same operative session.\r"

Surgical procedures included inferior repositioning of the maxilla (7) and chin (12), maxillary advancements in cleft (4) and noncleft individuals (13), and transverse maxillary expansions (12). Patients included in this study were only those in whom bone grafts would have been harvested had hydroxyapatite not been available. A total of 93 anatomic sites were implanted. The complication rate attributable to the use of the implant was 4.3 percent. Follow-up period ranged from 6 to 20 months, with a mean of 9.3 months. At this time, osseous stability was confirmed cephalometrically in all but two patients undergoing maxillary expansions. The biologic behavior and mechanical properties of coralline-derived, porous, block hydroxyapatite are discussed. These implant characteristics make it a feasible bone graft substitute for interpositional use in orthognathic surgery. Proper indications for its use as well as technical details to minimize complications are stressed.\r"

Also examined were morbidity factors such as length of hospital stay and the need for blood transfusion.

All valves were of Bjork-Shiley type, and all but six patients received maintenance oral anticoagulant therapy. The 100% follow-up comprised 744 patient-years (mean 4.0 years). The early mortality was 9.6% and was related to the complexity and urgency of surgery: After elective AVR for pure aortic stenosis the rate was 3.9%. Actuarial survival (early mortality excluded) was 79% at 5 years and 73% at 8 years overall, and 87% and 80% after AVR for stenosis. In the AVR group the relative (age- and -sex-adjusted) survival rate indicated a normalized survival pattern after the first year, with 87%, 'cure' rate (early mortality included), and the incidence of thromboembolism and of fatal bleeding complications equalled figures for younger patients. Mechanical heart valve implantation and maintenance anticoagulation thus seems to be safe treatment even in elderly patients, and eliminates need for valve re-replacement due to bioprosthetic degeneration.\r"

Pulse rate was set at 70 beats/min, stroke volume at 70 ml and mean 'aortic' pressure at 100 mmHg. Despite the controlled conditions, there was great variability of the closing sound, in both intensity and spectral composition, making noise comparisons and spectral characterization ('sonoprint') difficult. In general, bileaflet mechanical valves produced less noise than did tilting disc valves, particularly those with large opening angles. One small-size (23 mm) tilting disc valve produced 50% less noise than large types. The plastic ball valve, the porcine and the polyurethane trileaflet valve all were very quiet.\r"

IABP was used preoperatively in 13 cases, to assist weaning from cardiopulmonary bypass in 64, postoperatively in nine, and without cardiac surgery in five cases. Complications arose from IABP in 24/90 patients (27%). The overall short-term survival rate following IABP was 61%, and the long-term (mean 23 months) rate was 51%. Early recovery of cardiac function was the main determinant of survival. Female sex, renal failure and postinfarction ventricular septal defect and mitral incompetence were over-represented among the nonsurvivors. IABP therefore is useful in reversible left ventricular dysfunction, whereas inadequate perfusion of vital organs with potential for failure of more than one organ system implies diminished likelihood of survival.\r"

Analyses were made of myoglobin (MG), the enzymes lactate dehydrogenase (LD) with its isoenzymes, glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), phosphofructokinase (PFK), citrate synthase (CS) and creatine kinase (CK) with its isoenzymes MB (CK-MB) and mitochondrial CK (CK-MIT). Myocardial function was assessed with left ventricular angiography. Positive and significant correlations were found between enzymes of oxidative metabolism, i.e. CS on the one hand and MG (r = 0.76), LD1 (r = 0.68), CK-MIT (r = 0.86) and CK-MB (r = 0.65) on the other. Indicators of glycolysis--PFK, GAPDH and LD3--varied independently of CS. LD3% was directly related to GAPDH (r = 0.66). In a sub-group of 12 patients with isolated mitral regurgitation due to myxomatous valve degeneration, LD3% rose (r = 0.72) with increasing myocardial derangement which, however, showed no relationship with any other marker. Thus the capacities of oxidative and glycolytic pathways did not co-vary. Volume load appeared not to affect oxidative capacity, while the anaerobic fraction of glycolysis was increased.\r"

This resistance to reversal of depth has traditionally been attributed to familiarity with the shape of objects and the presence of monocular depth cues. However, when texture disparity is neutralized by making the texture perspective of surfaces identical for both eyes, even a highly familiar object, like a monocularly recognizable human face, appears as concave (nose pointing inwards) when viewed pseudoscopically.\r"

  ".U": "89266903\r", 
  ".W": "The eye needs to biosynthesize 11-cis-retinoids because the chromophore of rhodopsin is 11-cis-retinal. The critical metabolic step is the endergonic isomerization of free all-trans-retinol (vitamin A) into 11-cis-retinol. This isomerization process can take place in isolated membranes from the retinal pigment epithelium in the absence of added energy sources. Specific binding proteins probably do not serve as an energy source, and since all of the reactions in the visual cycle are shown here to be reversible, trapping reactions also do not participate in the isomerization reaction. One previously unexplored possibility is that the chemical energy in the bonds of the membrane itself may drive the isomerization reaction. A group transfer reaction is proposed that forms a retinyl ester from a lipid acyl donor and vitamin A. This transfer can drive the isomerization reaction because the all-trans-retinyl ester is isomerized directly to 11-cis-retinol. Thus, the free energy of hydrolysis of the ester is coupled to the thermodynamically uphill trans to cis isomerization. The prediction of an obligate C-O bond cleavage in the vitamin A moiety during isomerization is borne out. Although the natural substrate for isomerization is not known, all-trans-retinyl palmitate is processed in vitro to 11-cis-retinol by pigment epithelial membranes.\r"

Xanthine oxidase, which is responsible for the generation of oxygen free radicals, was elevated in serum and lung tissue of mice infected with influenza virus. To test the theory that oxygen-free radicals are involved in pathogenesis, free radicals were removed by injecting superoxide dismutase (SOD), a specific superoxide radical scavenger, which was conjugated with a pyran copolymer. The conjugate protected mice against a potentially lethal influenza virus infection if administered 5 to 8 days after infection. These findings indicate that oxygen radicals are important in the pathogenesis of influenza virus infection, and that a polymer-conjugated SOD has therapeutic potential for this virus infection and other diseases associated with free radicals.\r"

This current could be recorded when sodium, calcium, and potassium currents were eliminated by channel antagonists or by ion substitution. Alteration of the chloride equilibrium potential produced changes in the reversal potential expected for a chloride current. Activation of this chloride current modulated action potential duration and altered the resting membrane potential in a chloride gradient-dependent manner.\r"

The functional consequences of activating a brain-specific neurotransmitter receptor, the serotonin 5HT1c receptor, in the unnatural environment of a fibroblast were examined. Introduction of functional 5HT1c receptors into NIH 3T3 cells results, at high frequency, in the generation of transformed foci. Moreover, the generation and maintenance of transformed foci requires continued activation of the serotonin receptor. In addition, the injection of cells derived from transformed foci into nude mice results in the generation of tumors. The serotonin 5HT1c receptor therefore functions as a protooncogene when expressed in NIH 3T3 fibroblasts.\r"

Since the overall free energy change is only -5.5 kcal/mole (versus the experimental value of -3.4 kcal/mole), essential elements of the thermodynamics are hidden in the measured results. By exposing the individual contributions, the free energy simulation provides new insights into the origin of thermodynamic changes in mutant proteins and demonstrates the role of effects beyond those usually considered in structural analyses.\r"

Single alanine mutations (62 in total) were introduced at every residue contained within the three discontinuous segments of hGH (residues 2 to 19, 54 to 74, and 167 to 191) that have been implicated in receptor recognition. The alanine scan revealed a cluster of a dozen large side chains that when mutated to alanine each showed more than a four times lower binding affinity to the hGH receptor. Many of these residues that promote binding to the hGH receptor are altered in homologs of hGH (such as placental lactogens and prolactins) that do not bind tightly to the hGH receptor. The overall folding of these mutant proteins was indistinguishable from that of the wild-type hGH, as determined by strong cross-reactivities with seven different conformationally sensitive monoclonal antibodies. The alanine scan also identified at least one side chain, Glu174, that hindered binding because when it was mutated to alanine the receptor affinity increased by more than a factor of four.\r"

Concomitant with the induction of IFN in chicken embryo cells was the induction of a novel double-stranded ribonuclease (dsRNase), which was released into the medium and continued to accumulate long after IFN production ceased. Only avian cells (chicken, quail, turkey, or duck) expressed high levels of this dsRNase; mammalian, turtle, or fish cells did not. Production of the nuclease was inducer dose-dependent. Optimum pH and cation requirements distinguished it from other dsRNase activities. Degradation of dsRNA was endonucleolytic. Activity resided in a molecule of an Mr of approximately 34,500. Low levels of a single-stranded (ss) RNase activity were inseparable from the dsRNase. The role for a dsRNA-inducible dsRNase released from cells is unknown.\r"

  ".W": "Vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) labeled with 125I, [Tyr10-125I]VIP, can be hydrolyzed by immunoglobulin G (IgG) purified from a human subject, as judged by trichloroacetic acid precipitation and reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The hydrolytic activity was precipitated by antibody to human IgG, it was bound by immobilized protein G and showed a molecular mass close to 150 kilodaltons by gel filtration chromatography, properties similar to those of authentic IgG. The Fab fragment, prepared from IgG by papain treatment, retained the VIP hydrolytic activity of the IgG. Peptide fragments produced by treatment of VIP with the antibody fraction were purified by reversed-phase HPLC and identified by fast atom bombardment-mass spectrometry and peptide sequencing. The scissile bond in VIP deduced from these experiments was Gln16-Met17. The antibody concentration (73.4 fmol per milligram of IgG) and the Kd (0.4 nM) were computed from analysis of VIP binding under conditions that did not result in peptide hydrolysis. Analysis of the antibody-mediated VIP hydrolysis at varying concentrations of substrate suggested conformity with Michaelis-Menton kinetics (Km). The values for Km (37.9 X 10(-9) M) and the turnover number kcat (15.6 min-1) suggested relatively tight VIP binding and a moderate catalytic efficiency of the antibody.\r"

  ".W": "Two types of potassium-selective channels activated by intracellular arachidonic acid or phosphatidylcholine have been found in neonatal rat atrial cells. In inside-out patches, arachidonic acid and phosphatidylcholine each opened outwardly rectifying potassium-selective channels with conductances of 160 picosiemens (IK.AA) and 68 picosiemens (IK.PC), respectively. These potassium channels were not sensitive to internally applied adenosine triphosphate (ATP), magnesium, or calcium. Lowering the intracellular pH from 7.2 to 6.8 or 6.4 reversibly increased IK.AA channel activity three- or tenfold, respectively. A number of fatty acid derivatives were tested for their ability to activate IK.AA. These potassium-selective channels may help explain the increase in potassium conductance observed in ischemic cells and raise the possibility that fatty acid derivatives act as second messengers.\r"

The GSS estimates for the distribution of homicide victims replicate the official statistics quite well. The GSS estimates for AIDS cases suggest that the data provided to the Centers for Disease Control may underestimate by a substantial margin the prevalence of AIDS in the white population of higher socioeconomic status, overstate the relative prevalence of the disease in the minority populations, underestimate the prevalence of the disease in the Midwest, and overstate it for the East.\r"

The distribution and lateral mobility of VDCCs on CA1 hippocampal neurons have been determined with biologically active fluorescent and biotinylated derivatives of the selective probe omega-conotoxin in conjunction with circular dityndallism, digital fluorescence imaging, and photobleach recovery microscopy. On noninnervated cell bodies, VDCCs were found to be organized in multiple clusters, whereas after innervation the VDCCs were concentrated and immobilized at synaptic contact sites. On dendrites, VDCC distribution was punctate and was interrupted by extensive bare regions or abruptly terminated. More than 85% of the dendritic VDCCs were found to be immobile by fluorescence photobleach recovery. Thus, before synaptic contact, specific mechanisms target, segregate, and immobilize VDCCs to neuronal cell bodies and to specialized dendritic sites. Regulation of this distribution may be critical in determining the firing activity and integrative properties of hippocampal CA1 neurons.\r"

A multifactorial analysis showed that only the vital capacity (VC) was significantly lowered to 81% of predicted value (P less than 0.05). All of the other parameters of pulmonary volumes, flow, and gas exchanges, where corrected for the loss of lung volume, were within normal limits, showing pure restrictive changes in this population. Double-major curves were more severe, but no significant difference in PFTs were found with single thoracic curves. Curves over 50 degrees had significantly lower VC. The surgical correction of 40% is permanent and the functional improvement in postoperative vital capacity (VC) of 12% is significant (P less than 0.05). Other factors, such as the time between the two evaluations, the age of the patient, pelvic obliquity, trunk imbalance, and degree of kyphosis did not have any correlation with the observed changed on any of the PFT results. Therefore, early correction by spinal fusion in idiopathic scoliosis brings on some improvement of the vital capacity at rest and may prevent deterioration with progression of the curve.\r"

Group II had 15 patients with flexible curves who underwent instrumentation and fusion alone. Preoperative side bending curve reduction averaged 23% in Group I and 49% in Group II. Postoperative correction was similar in both groups with Group I achieving 60% (+/- 10%) overall correction and Group II, 57% (+/- 8%). Group I underwent 56% further reduction from side bending compared with Group II's 12% reduction. It was concluded that if preoperative side bending correction was below 35% of standing curve, curve correction comparable to flexible cases could be achieved through multiple concave rib osteotomies. Neurologic risk was not increased, but there was increased pulmonary morbidity of 30%.\r"

It was hoped that this questionnaire would help predict therapeutic responses for back pain patients. The reliability, validity, and predictive characteristics of this scale were tested among 97 patients with chronic low-back pain enrolled in a clinical trial of transcutaneous nerve stimulation and stretching exercises. Internal consistency was good (alpha = 0.78), and correlations with the Zung depression scale and certain MMPI scales were significant. Correlations with a baseline functional scale (the Sickness Impact Profile) were stronger than those with the MMPI. Unfortunately, the MSPQ did not correlate with functional outcomes, and was only weakly associated with pain outcomes. Thus, the MSPQ appears to be reliable and valid, but the somatic perceptions it measures may have little relation to patient outcomes.\r"

Results of the DPQ's statistical properties suggest that the DPQ is an externally reliable instrument as well as internally consistent. Two factors emerged from factor structure analysis. Factor 1 represents functional activities and Factor 2 represents emotional capacities. A correlation analysis suggests the concurrent validity of the psychological functional factors of the DPQ. A t test demonstrated that chronic pain patients have significantly higher DPQ scores than normals. Because these findings support its statistical properties, the DPQ appears to have utility for clinical and research purposes. The findings, limitations, and implications of this study are detailed, as are suggestions for future research.\r"

A study of spinal capacity in flexion-extension of ten cadaver specimens on the lumbar spine was done and measurements were obtained from the flexion-extension lateral myelograms. There proved to be a larger capacity of dural sac of 3.5 to 6.0 ml (4.85 +/- 0.75 ml) in flexion than in extension, and the differences were highly significant (P less than 0.001). In addition, the sagittal diameter of the dural sac and the length of the spinal canal increased from extension to flexion. Because of the effect of flexion-extension motion of the lumbar spine on the spinal capacity, we suggest that maintaining the lumbar spine in flexion is more suitable since spinal canal capacity is enlarged and symptoms may be mitigated.\r"

Twenty-four patients with an average follow-up of 34 months (range, 18 to 71 months) are reported. The average preoperative slip measured 7 mm (17%; range, 4-12 mm). Sixteen patients, including all patients less than 60 years of age, underwent preoperative supine lateral flexion-extension radiographs for evaluation of instability. No patient had greater than 2 mm of increase in slip on flexion-extension testing. During decompression, the structural integrity of the pars interarticularis and facet joints are preserved. There were 20 good, three fair, and one poor results. The average postoperative slip measured 8 mm (20%; range, 4-11 mm), and no patient had an increase in slip of greater than 4 mm. In the absence of objective instability on preoperative flexion-extension lateral radiographs in L4-5 degenerative spondylolisthesis, decompressive laminectomy with preservation of the structural integrity of the pars interarticularis and articular processes does not require routine spinal fusion and produced satisfactory clinical results.\r"

There were two delayed complications, both partial small intestinal obstructions. One occurred just after the conclusion of radiation treatment and the other occurred five months after the conclusion of radiation therapy. Both obstructions responded to conservative management. None of the common acute radiation effects occurred during radiotherapy. One patient with delayed partial small intestinal obstruction had possible late radiation effects. The median follow-up period after radiation therapy was 12.5 months. Despite the complications described in this report, the use of a polyglactin mesh sling as an adjunct to resection of carcinoma of the pelvis has merit and should be studied further.\r"

For 17 of the benign aldosteronomas, the DNA histograms were similar to those for samples of normal adrenal cortical parenchyma of adult humans. The three DNA histograms from benign (histologically and clinically) aldosteronomas and all six malignant aldosterone-producing neoplasms were abnormal. Tissue from the adrenal gland from three of the patients with malignant aldosterone-producing tumors exhibited a DNA tetraploid and polyploid pattern; adrenal tissue from three other patients with malignant tumors were classified as having DNA aneuploid histogram patterns. Only patients with DNA aneuploid histogram patterns subsequently died of the disease. Flow cytometry may have an important role prognostically, rather than diagnostically, in the evaluation of aldosterone-producing malignant neoplasms, because the DNA histograms from three benign adenomas were abnormal.\r"

Deficits in temperature and pain sensations (the small sensory nerve fibers) were related to abnormal sympathetic nervous function (temperature sensation, p less than 0.001; pain sensation, p less than 0.05). The deficits in temperature sensation, in particular, predicted abnormal sympathetic nervous function reliably and vice versa. There was no relationship between deficits in touch and vibration sensations (the large sensory nerve fibers) and abnormal sympathetic nervous function. There was a relationship between skin galvanic response and RR-variation (p less than 0.01). However, abnormality in RR-variation was not related to the deficits in any of the four sensory modalities.\r"

  ".W": "The frequency of maternal death is decreasing in Iowa, particularly in the category of direct obstetric causes, such as hemorrhage, infection, pre-eclampsia and eclampsia. Unfortunately, concurrent linkage of vital statistics records was not performed during the study period, precluding any certain conclusion that all maternal deaths were actually identified (29). In addition, there has been, at best, only a modest decrease in the proportion of direct obstetric deaths that are preventable, suggesting that the educational goals of the maternal mortality review process are as yet far from fulfilled. In particular, the number of embolic deaths, both from pulmonary emboli and amniotic fluid emboli, has remained constant. We now appreciate many predisposing risk factors for pulmonary embolization and must seriously consider prophylactic anticoagulation in pregnant or puerperal women at increased risk. We also need further studies in the pathogenesis, treatment and prevention of amniotic fluid emboli. Although associated with lower proportions of preventability than with direct causes of obstetric deaths, the indirect and nonobstetric categories of maternal deaths have also been associated with a less dramatic decline in numbers. In particular, trauma remains a persistent cause of preventable maternal death. Continued public education as well as legislation for mandatory safety restraints in automobiles may reverse this trend. This suggests that considerable room for improvement exists in the field of education of patients and of health care professionals who routinely care for patients with complicated obstetric problems.\r"

  ".W": "Little or no acute medical care or evacuation capability was available to resistance forces in the Afghanistan War. We examined the effects of these constraints through a review of 1373 patients admitted to a Pakistani border hospital from 1985 to 1987. Most wounds were to the extremities (92%). Serious complications from injuries were found in 41% of cases, of which the leading causes were soft-tissue infections (36%), chronic osteomyelitis (25%), and marked restriction of joint movement (18%). For 201 patients with known cause of injury, the distribution of responsible weapons was similar to the wars in Korea, Vietnam, and the Falkland Islands. The ratio of critical-area wounds (trunk, head and neck)/extremity wounds was low (0.07) compared with most other wars (about 0.50), indicating that the most seriously injured patients died before treatment was obtained. These early deaths and the many complications from injuries reflect the lack of appropriate surgical attention and evacuation facilities in the field. It is proposed that the ratio of wounds in critical areas to wounds in the extremities might be useful in monitoring the efficiency of evacuation in similar conflicts. Early surgical management and evacuation of battle casualties could have greatly reduced mortality from the war and subsequent disabilities.\r"
