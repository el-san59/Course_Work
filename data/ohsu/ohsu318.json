The concentration-time profile of the drug in serum and renal clearance were characterized pre-CPB, during CPB, and post-CPB. Vancomycin and netilmicin exhibited initial decreases in mean concentrations in serum of 4.0 mg/liter (16.8%) and 2.2 mg/liter (29.1%), respectively, upon initiation of CPB. Netilmicin concentrations in serum rebounded to a mean of 0.6 mg/liter (15.4%) within 90 min on CPB and then continuously decreased. Vancomycin concentrations in serum demonstrated a rebound increase of 2.3 mg/liter (23.5%) at the end of CPB when the aorta was unclamped. Mean renal clearance throughout CPB was decreased for vancomycin (58.4 to 43.4 ml/min per m2) and netilmicin (53.4 to 31.5 ml/min per m2). The rebound in vancomycin concentration in serum strongly correlated with the length of time between unclamping the aorta and coming off CPB (r = 0.94), as well as with the increase in temperature upon rewarming (r = 0.92).\r"

As part of a clinical-microbiological study, 89 strains of Bacillus spp. isolated from clinical blood cultures between 1981 and 1985 had their species determined and were tested for antimicrobial agent susceptibility to 18 antibiotics. Species of isolates were determined by the API 50CH and API 20E systems. Bacillus cereus (54 strains) was the most common species isolated, followed by B. megaterium (13 strains), B. polymyxa (5 strains), B. pumilus (4 strains), B. subtilis (4 strains), B. circulans (3 strains), B. amyloliquefaciens (2 strains), B. licheniformis (1 strain), and Bacillus spp. (3 strains). Microdilution MIC susceptibility tests revealed all B. cereus strains to be susceptible to imipenem, vancomycin, chloramphenicol, gentamicin, and ciprofloxacin. Non-B. cereus strains were most susceptible to imipenem, vancomycin, LY146032, and ciprofloxacin. Disk susceptibility testing suggested that B. cereus was rarely susceptible to penicillins, semisynthetic penicillins, or cephalosporins with the exception of mezlocillin. In contrast, many non-B. cereus strains were susceptible to penicillins, semisynthetic penicillins, and cephalosporins, but marked variability was noted among species.\r"

Similarly, in studies with rat Leydig cells in vitro, fluconazole at concentrations up to 10 micrograms/ml was found to be only a weak inhibitor of testosterone production, whereas ketoconazole caused more than 50% inhibition at 0.1 microgram/ml. It is concluded that fluconazole, in contrast to ketoconazole, has little effect on the biosynthesis of testosterone by mammalian cells.\r"

  ".W": "Prophylactic use of antiviral agents against cytomegalovirus (CMV) is particularly indicated for the immunocompromised host because morbidity and mortality due to CMV occur most frequently following immunosuppression. We have evaluated the new Riker compound S26308 for its therapeutic and prophylactic antiviral activity against CMV in guinea pigs. The efficacy of the compound was assessed in vitro in guinea pig embryo cells and in vivo in both immunocompetent and immunocompromised guinea pigs. Guinea pig CMV plaque formation was reduced only in cells treated with S26308 prior to virus infection. The antiviral activity remained even when the compound was removed after virus absorption and was due to neither virus destruction nor inhibition of cell growth. The frequency of viremia was reduced in guinea pigs for which S26308 therapy was initiated 24 h prior to virus inoculation compared with sham-treated animals. This reduction in the frequency of viremia did not prevent virus spread to target tissues but did result in a reduction of the severity of CMV-induced disease in immunocompromised guinea pigs. Low levels of interferon were detected in supernatants of S26308-treated cells, and interferon was detected in the serum of guinea pigs given S26308. These results indicate that S26308 can induce interferon and reduce CMV infectivity in vivo and in vitro when used prophylactically. This antiviral activity, although modest, was accompanied by beneficial effects on CMV-induced morbidity and mortality. Prophylactic use of S26308 in combination with other therapeutic agents may be a useful strategy against CMV infections.\r"

Antibody was administered by single intravenous infusion of 1 to 4 h duration at doses ranging from 0.1 to 15 mg/kg. Five patients had positive blood cultures for gram-negative bacteria, one patient had Torulopsis septicemia, one patient had gram-negative bacterial meningitis, and two patients were culture negative. No evidence of antibody-mediated toxicity was observed at any dose level. The serum half-life of the antibody was approximately 10 h at doses of 0.1 to 7.5 mg/kg and approximately 18 h at a dose of 15 mg/kg. No apparent difference in clearance of antibody was observed between bacteremic and nonbacteremic patients. Human anti-mouse antibodies were detected in the sera of three evaluable patients that received doses equal to or greater than 2.0 mg/kg but not in patients that received lower doses of antibody. This study demonstrates that XMMEN-0E5 is well tolerated at doses from 0.1 to 15 mg/kg and may be immunogenic at doses of 2.0 mg/kg and above. Controlled trials to establish the efficacy of this antibody in the treatment of gram-negative bacteremia are indicated.\r"

The most active beta-lactam drugs were imipenem and ticarcillin-clavulanic acid (Timentin), which had a less than 1% resistance rate. No metronidazole- or chloramphenicol-resistant isolates were found during the 5 years of the study. Isolates obtained from blood, perinatal, and bone sites of infection were more resistant to a variety of antimicrobial agents. Susceptibility patterns of the members of the B. fragilis group varied at the eight hospitals and among species. These data indicate the need for determining the susceptibility patterns for the B. fragilis group of organisms at each hospital.\r"

After giving informed consent, three males and three females aged 63.5 to 77.5 (mean 67.9) years and weighing 54.5 to 86.8 (mean, 67.6) kg were treated with cefoperazone (2.0 g) and sulbactam (1.0 g) infused intravenously every 12 h for at least 5 days. Cefoperazone and sulbactam pharmacokinetics were characterized on both days 1 and 5 of treatment. Eleven serial blood samples were obtained just prior to and following dose 1 on days 1 and 5 of treatment. Mean estimates of cefoperazone maximal concentration in plasma (Cmax), area under the curve of drug concentration in plasma versus time (AUC), half-life (t 1/2), apparent volume of distribution by the area method (Varea), apparent volume of distribution at steady state (Vss), and total body clearance (CL) for day 1 (day 5) were 297.5 237.5) micrograms/ml, 1,247 (1,063) micrograms.h/ml, 7.0 (4.9) h, 16.1 (13.4) liter, 13.1 (14.4) liter, and 28.9 (34.2) ml/min, respectively. Day 1 (day 5) mean values for sulbactam Cmax, AUC, t 1/2, Varea, Vss, and CL were 110.3 (78.0) micrograms/ml, 228 (217) micrograms.h/ml, 3.4 (2.5) h, 26.1 (18.5) liter, 18.9 (15.4) liter, and 97 (94) ml/min, respectively. Both drugs evidenced slower elimination and greater pharmacokinetic variability in these patients compared with values previously reported for normal volunteers. As patients improved during the course of therapy, the only pharmacokinetic parameter significantly changed between days 1 and 5 was a shortened sulbactam t 1/2.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Forty-five percent of the depressed patients excreted markedly elevated levels of urinary epinephrine (E) and metanephrine (MET), while only 5% of healthy controls did so. Using gaussian mixture distributions, we identified two subgroups of depressed patients: one excreting normal levels and the other excreting high levels of urinary E, MET, norepinephrine, and normetanephrine. Cerebrospinal fluid homovanillic acid levels were low in a subgroup of depressed patients. When analyzed by subgroup, the elevated E + MET group had markedly lower cerebrospinal fluid homovanillic acid levels than controls, whereas depressed patients with normal catecholamine levels did not. Since it has been postulated that there are two subgroups of depressed patients, those with low 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol (MHPG) levels and normal 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) levels and those with normal MHPG levels and low 5-HIAA levels, several analyses were performed to see if such a group could be identified. Our analysis failed to find evidence of a subgroup of depressives with low MHPG and normal 5-HIAA levels or normal MHPG and low 5-HIAA levels.\r"

To assess the function of these receptors relative to possible abnormalities in noradrenergic function in depression, responses to the alpha 2-antagonist yohimbine hydrochloride were investigated in 45 depressed patients and 20 healthy control subjects. Plasma 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol (MHPG), blood pressure (BP), pulse, subjective mood, and somatic symptoms were measured before and during yohimbine and placebo administration. The 25% increase in plasma MHPG levels produced by yohimbine did not differ between patients and controls. Mood responses also tended to be similar between groups, with patients reporting only minor improvement in depression following yohimbine. However, yohimbine caused significantly greater increases in somatic symptoms and tended to produce a greater increase in BP in patients than in controls. Evaluation of patient subgroups divided by the presence or absence of melancholia, psychosis, prominent anxiety, or personality disorder did not demonstrate consistent differences. In contrast, comparison of these findings with a prior study showed that patients with panic disorder and agoraphobia who received yohimbine manifested significantly greater increases in MHPG levels and ratings of anxiety, nervousness, and depression than depressed patients. These findings suggest that patients with major depression do not demonstrate marked abnormalities in alpha 2-adrenergic autoreceptor function.\r"

Informants reported more pathologic conditions than the patients, such that PDs were diagnosed in 57.6% (38/66) of the patients, based on the informant interview, and in 36.4% (24/66), based on the patient interview. We also examined dimensional scores. In general, we found only modest correlations between the patient and informant dimensional scores and that the ratings based on the informant interviews were higher. These results varied by specific PD diagnoses. Consensus ratings, which were based on both sources of information, were sometimes more strongly associated with patient information and sometimes with informant information, and this, too, varied among the different PDs.\r"

Despite extensive study of the reliability and validity of the total scale score, the psychometric characteristics of the individual items have not been well studied. In the only reliability study to report agreement on individual items using a test-retest interview method, most of the items had only fair or poor agreement. Because this is due in part to variability in the way the information is obtained to make the various rating distinctions, the Structured Interview Guide for the HDRS (SIGH-D) was developed to standardize the manner of administration of the scale. A test-retest reliability study conducted on a series of psychiatric inpatients demonstrated that the use of the SIGH-D results in a substantially improved level of agreement for most of the HDRS items.\r"

A second comparison of only those patients who refused treatment yielded similar findings--52 patients were committable according to the Stone criteria compared with 80 under the Massachusetts statute. The greater restrictiveness of the Stone criteria in each comparison was in large part the result of the requirement that the treatment decisions of the patient be incompetent; in the broader sample, the criterion of major patient distress had a comparable impact. A comparison of patients committable under both standards with those patients currently committable who would be excluded under the Stone standard revealed significant differences. The dually committable patients were more likely to be psychotic, to meet statutory criteria for grave disability, and to be diagnosed as manic. The implications of the findings are discussed.\r"

Polyclonal antibodies produced in laboratory animals in response to injection of specific antigens have been the cornerstone of immunoassay because of their high affinities and wide range of specificities. Recently, monoclonal antibodies have begun to replace polyclonal antibodies because of improved specificity, ease of use, production of an unlimited supply, and advantages of worldwide assay standardization.

Immunoblotting has distinct versatility in immunochemical test applications. Immunoblotting combines the power of gel electrophoresis for resolving the electrophoretic variants of immunologically cross-reacting proteins with the ease and sensitivity of immunodetection on a solid-phase immunoassay. The potential for diagnostic applications includes: assay of antigens from pathologic serum samples, body fluids, and tissue; assay of patient serum samples for antibody against known antigen; and separation and assay of patient immunoglobulin. The usefulness of these applications is enhanced by the possibility of simultaneous use of nonantibody ligand, reversible protein staining, or, in the case of enzyme proteins, the use of substrate to detect activity. Dot immunobinding, in a similar fashion, permits assays of multiple specimens simultaneously on single strips of blotting media using sample sizes as small as 0.1 microL. Also, both immunoblotting and dot immunobinding techniques permit sequential probing of antigens with different antisera, with subsequent elution and recovery of specific antibody probes.\r"

  ".W": "Four instances (8%) of inflammatory fibroid polyp (IFP) with concomitant adenocarcinoma or adenoma, in the same area, were noted among 50 cases of IFP of the stomach. Adding two cases from other sources, four cases of gastric IFP concomitant with an adenocarcinoma and two of gastric IFP concomitant with an adenoma were studied histopathologically and immunohistochemically. All lesions were located in the gastric antrum and they were restricted to the mucosa in three, and they involved both mucosa and submucosa in the other three. Neither S100 protein nor factor VIII-associated antigen was recognized in the principal component cells, using an immunoperoxidase technique. This finding suggests the conventional view that the proliferating cells were neither neurogenic nor angioblastic, but rather, were fibroblastic in origin. The four concomitant carcinomas were early adenocarcinomas restricted to within the mucosa, and the two concomitant adenomas were tubular adenomas with a moderate epithelial atypia. All these neoplasms were present in or adjacent to the IFP. We emphasize that the IFP, albeit benign, may carry an adenocarcinoma or an adenoma.\r"

Extrahepatic tumor deposits were misdiagnosed in all but one of these cases. The roentgenographic characteristics that can assist in the differentiation of intrahepatic and extrahepatic metastases are a lens-shaped defect, a defect adjacent to the hemidiaphragm, and a halo around the liver suggesting peritoneal carcinomatosis. A high index of suspicion for extra-hepatic tumor masses causing intrahepatic filling defects may help prevent unnecessary exploratory surgery for treatment of hepatic metastases. Angiography may occasionally be helpful in distinguishing intrahepatic from extrahepatic disease.\r"

We have successfully treated four patients with perforated esophageal neoplasms by transhiatal esophagectomy and cervical esophagogastrostomy, thus avoiding thoracotomy in high-risk patients.

In 356 (18.5%) of the readings, the PAWP exceeded the PADP, indicating that the PAWP reading might be erroneous. In 106 (5.5%) of these readings, the PAWP was 6.0 mm Hg or more higher than the PADP, indicating that the PAWP was almost certainly erroneous. In virtually all instances in which this discrepancy was recognized, changing the position of the catheter tip provided a PAWP value equal to or lower than the PADP. On the other extreme, in 49 (30%) of the patients, the PADP was 6.0 mm Hg or more higher than the PAWP. The pulmonary vascular resistance in these patients averaged (+/- SD) 257 +/- 145 dyne/s/cm-5 (normal, 80 to 160 dyne/s/cm-5). The mean pulmonary vascular resistance in the other 74 patients was significantly lower (158 +/- 72 dyne/s/cm-5). The mortality rate with the increased PADP-PAWP gradients was 59% (24/49). This was significantly higher than the mortality rate (34%, or 27/79) seen with lower PAWP-PADP gradients. Thus, the relationship between the PADP and PAWP should be examined closely in critically ill patients. A PAWP higher than the PADP indicates that the PAWP measurement may be erroneous. On the other hand, if the PADP exceeds the PAWP by 6.0 mm Hg or more, the patient has probably developed pulmonary hypertension and has a much poorer prognosis.\r"

Arteriography in the asymptomatic patient with a penetrating extremity wound is reported to identify arterial injuries in 6% to 21% of patients; however, some injuries may have little clinical importance. This study attempted to determine the value of proximity as an indication for angiography. Five hundred seven asymptomatic patients with 534 penetrating extremity injuries underwent arteriography due to proximity to major vascular structures. Thirty-six arteriograms (6.7%) were positive. Seven patients did not undergo operative exploration, 19 patients (3.6%) had arteriograms, and ten (1.9%) had false-positive arteriograms. The remaining 498 patients had true-negative examination results. Arteriography was associated with 13 complications (2.6%). Proved vascular injury in the clinically asymptomatic patients in our series was extremely low (3.6%). These data make it difficult to justify arteriography due to proximity of injury to major vascular structures. However, it is difficult to abandon exclusion arteriography based on these retrospective data. These observations do suggest that better criteria to define proximity need to be identified.\r"

The total cost of NLB was $775 in group 1 and $1960 in group 2. The difference in cost represented by the use of general anesthesia was $1260.

Nine patients received postoperative radiation therapy. The mean follow-up was 34 months. Greater than 50% reduction in tumor size was achieved in 72% of patients after three cycles of chemotherapy. Overall, local control was achieved in 85% of patients with 59% survival and 53% disease-free survival, while 10% of patients developed local recurrences. Excluding lymphedema of the upper extremity (n = 2) and inflammatory carcinomas (n = 4), local control was achieved in 96% of patients, with 75% survival and 68% disease-free survival, while 4% of patients developed local recurrences. The rate of disease-free survival was 71% in patients with partial response to chemotherapy, contrasted with 43% in patients who did not respond or only minimally responded to chemotherapy. Actuarial five-year survival, based on life-table analysis, was calculated to be 46% for the group overall, 58% for the group excluding lymphedema of the upper extremity and inflammatory carcinoma, and 56% for the 28 patients undergoing mastectomy.\r"

Although urgent medical therapy achieved blood pressure control in all three patients, the other manifestations of PMC progressed rapidly in spite of alpha and even beta blockade. The first patient died during attempts to localize a septic focus. The other two patients underwent urgent adrenalectomy and had postoperative improvement in their multiple organ system failure. All three tumors were large and produced markedly elevated levels of epinephrine. In conclusion (1) PMC is an unusual presentation of pheochromocytoma; (2) its manifestations include multiple organ system failure, high fever, encephalopathy, and vascular lability; (3) it may result from increased epinephrine secretion; and (4) successful treatment of PMC demands prompt diagnosis, vigorous medical preparation, and emergency tumor removal if the patient's condition continues to deteriorate.\r"

Atrial septal defect closure can be safely performed in older patients with excellent results, provided the ratio of systemic to pulmonary blood flow is greater than or equal to 1.5 to 1.0, the pulmonary vascular resistance is low, and the shunt remains left to right. Primary closure should be discouraged, and postoperative anticoagulation therapy appears unwarranted.\r"

  ".W": "Four hundred five consecutive cases of low anterior colon resection were studied to determine the best treatment of anastomotic leak. The triad of fever, leukocytosis, and pelvic pain was present in 15 of the 16 cases with leaks. Four (25%) of the 16 patients died. Eleven were managed by proximal decompression and drainage; four died (36%). Three patients underwent takedown of the anastomosis, end colostomy, and distal closure or exteriorization; none died. Neither of the two patients who had drainage alone died. Anastomotic leakage accounted for two thirds of the deaths in this series. Recognition of the clinical triad of fever, leukocytosis, and pelvic pain could lead to earlier diagnosis and improved outcome. Our data suggest that a procedure that includes takedown of the anastomosis, end colostomy, and closure of the rectum is the most efficacious treatment of anastomotic leakage after low anterior colon resection.\r"

The first 89 esophagojejunostomies were hand sewn, and thereafter 161 were stapled with an end-to-end anastomosis device. Overall mortality was 27% and 10%, respectively. Death due to surgical causes occurred in 19% of the cases in the first group and 6.8% in the second. No statistical difference was observed in the esophageal anastomosis leakage rate, but the mortality due to such fistula was significantly higher in the group of hand-sewn anastomoses. Surprisingly, esophageal end invasion (at the anastomotic site) was 14% in the manual group vs 3.9% in the stapled one. The operator's experience had no effect on the incidence of esophageal fistula when the stapler was used. Thus, staplers are safe and useful when total gastrectomy is undertaken, provided that sound experience has been acquired.\r"

Forty-six patients were in Pugh's class B and 11 were in class C. There were three operative deaths (5.3%). Fifty-three (98.2%) of the 54 survivors were cleared of ascites. In one patient, ascites persisted because of postshunt heart failure that resulted in a marked increase of caval pressure. Twenty-seven patients (50%) had late encephalopathy, which was severe and disabling in 12 (22%). One- and three-year survival rates were 72% and 36%, respectively. These results suggest that although portosystemic shunts are remarkably effective in dealing with ascites, the high rate of postoperative encephalopathy is a strong argument against their routine use in the management of intractable ascites in cirrhosis.\r"

Small but statistically significant abnormalities of transketolase, but not of 2-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase complex, were identified in red blood cells and cultured fibroblasts. Previous studies have shown deficiencies in the brain and variable effects in peripheral tissues on another TPP-dependent enzyme--the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex. Activities of TPP-dependent enzymes appear to be deficient in the brain and perhaps in some peripheral tissues in patients with Alzheimer's disease.\r"

To assess this risk, we reviewed the charts of 142 patients with migraine. A total of 149 angiograms were performed for acute headache (55), new focal symptoms (40), exertional (including coital) headaches (nine), hemiplegic migraine (three), ophthalmoplegic migraine (five), vertebrobasilar migraine (six), migraine accompaniments (three), and other causes (14). Transient events were seen in six patients and these were transient amnesia (one), hemisensory changes (two), hemiparesis (one), global confusion (one), and angina (one). One patient with a history of severe ischemic heart disease developed a myocardial infarction two hours after angiography. Focal cerebral events occurred in 2.6% of cases. This compares with a rate of complications of 2.8% caused by angiography in a prospective study of 1002 patients from our center. According to our findings, it appears that a history of migraine does not increase the risk of complications caused by angiography. Angiography during episodes of acute headaches would also appear to be a safe procedure. Transient focal neurologic symptoms, however, are not infrequent, especially in cases of classic migraine.\r"

We have previously introduced this as a specific diagnostic and confirmatory test for recurrent hereditary polyserositis. The possibility that the two conditions represent different manifestations of a single disease is therefore strengthened.\r"

Both spinal and radial density were useful measurements when performed on patients with medical indications; spine and radius densities in these patients averaged 10-20% below those of age-matched controls. However, patients younger than 60 years of age had deficits of spine density that were twice as large as those in the radius, and twice as many of these patients had spinal osteopenia, compared with those with radial osteopenia. After age 70, loss of density in the radius approximated that in the spine and the prevalence of osteopenia was similar at both sites. The poorer sensitivity of the radius measurement reflected the fact that it did not predict spine density. The standard error of the estimate was 0.12 gm/cm2 in normal subjects and 0.15 gm/cm2 in patients. At any given radial density, the spinal density of patients averaged 0.18 gm/cm2 (15-20%) below that in normal subjects. Predictions of spinal density from body weight were as accurate as predictions from radial density. Preferential spinal osteopenia occurring without radial osteopenia precluded radial densitometry as a screening method for individuals with osteoporosis before age 60. However, measurement of the radius was more effective than body weight for defining groups at risk, even though the radius did not reliably predict individual spine density. A radius shaft density less than 0.55 gm/cm2 occurring with a body weight less than 55 kg was associated with a high prevalence of spinal osteopenia.\r"

  ".W": "The development of osteoarthrotic cartilage lesions in the knee joints of male STR/IN mice was studied with respect to their histologic appearance and their various localizations in the joint. Spontaneous articular cartilage degeneration on the medial portion of the tibial plateau was considered to be the initial event. Continued loss of cartilage subsequently led to a pronounced instability of the knee joint, with a varus deformity. This was followed by medial patellar luxation with corresponding osteoarthrotic lesions at the facies patellaris femoris. The most marked osteoarthrotic cartilage degeneration developed on the medial tibial condyle and at the facies patellaris femoris of the femoropatellar joint. Histologic examination of the osteoarthrotic defects in these two regions revealed distinct morphologic differences with respect to formation of chondrocyte clusters, tendency to regeneration, and proliferation reactions. Lectin binding experiments in normal articular cartilage revealed regional differences regarding the presence or absence of keratan sulfate in the extracellular matrix. The lack of keratan sulfate in tibial cartilage might reflect its tendency to degenerate spontaneously. It is therefore suggested that male STR/IN mice are particularly useful for studying two different types of osteoarthrosis, one due to a biomechanically induced instability (patellar luxation) and one due to biochemical changes (absence of keratan sulfate) of still unknown pathogenesis.\r"

The antibody recognized a region of the polypeptide backbone previously described as an important neutralizing epitope. This region lies 307-330 residues from amino terminus of the glycoprotein. We have compared the biologic and physical properties of this antibody to those of the recently described 0.5 beta monoclonal antibody to gp120. The 0.5 beta antibody was biologically more potent and bound an epitope slightly downstream to that of the 9284 antibody. The antibodies did not differ significantly in their affinity for gp120.

Our results showed that 27.8% (5 of 18) of the female partners of bisexuals, 33.3% (2 of 6) of intravenous drug abusers (IVDA), and 100% (4 of 4) of those who had lived for a long time in Africa were found anti-HIV positive. In contrast, only 4% (1 of 25) of the studied sexual partners of hemophiliac carriers were found to be HIV seropositive. The use of condoms seemed to be the most important factor in reducing HIV transmission. According to our results the duration of sexual relationships and the practice of anal intercourse did not increase the possibility of seroconversion. These results confirm the heterosexual transmission of HIV. However, further studies should be conducted to evaluate the relative role of various risk factors and the overall importance of heterosexual spread of HIV infections.\r"

With this approach variance caused by individual factors in the measurement procedure is estimated to allow calculation of confidence intervals based on single measurements and the detection limits for changes. Six study groups made up of a total of 143 subjects were examined by both multigated equilibrium and first pass imaging. Under favourable conditions (with an updated gamma camera and experienced observer) the 95% confidence interval with a single measurement of left ventricular ejection fraction by equilibrium imaging was +/- 3 ejection fraction units, compared with +/- 6 units with the first pass technique (one ejection fraction unit = 1/100 of the possible values from 0.00 to 1.00). The minimal significant changes (at the 5% level) in measured equilibrium left ventricular ejection fraction at intervals of 15 min, 3 days, 1, 3, and 4 weeks were +/- 4, +/- 4, +/- 5, +/- 5, and +/- 6 units, respectively. The corresponding minimal detectable changes in a subject's \"true\" left ventricular ejection fraction for the same intervals were +/- 7, +/- 7, +/- 10, +/- 10, and +/- 12 units respectively. With first pass imaging, only average values for the variation at repeat determination could be calculated. The minimal significant change in measured first pass left ventricular ejection fraction was +/- 7 units, and the minimal detectable change in \"true\" left ventricular ejection fraction was +/- 14 units. Measurements of left ventricular ejection fraction by equilibrium technique were generally more reproducible than first pass determinations because the variability caused by study acquisition, observer analysis, and residual errors was smaller. The method of variance components appears to be well suited to the evaluation of quantitative biological measurements in clinical use. The popularity of established procedures may obscure the lack of basic information about method evaluation.\r"

Five of the six indices showed a linear relation with age. Duration of isovolumic relaxation and maximal late diastolic (atrial) flow velocity increased significantly with age (r = 0.34 and r = 0.69), respectively). Conversely, maximal early diastolic flow velocity, the rate of decrease (deceleration) of flow velocity in early diastole, and the ratio between maximal early and late diastolic flow velocities decreased significantly with age (r = -0.30, r = -0.40, and r = -0.63, respectively). Duration of the early diastolic flow velocity peak did not show a linear relation with age (r = 0.04). Comparison of Doppler indices of diastolic performance among different age groups (20 to 29 years, 30 to 49 years, and 50 to 74 years) also showed an influence of aging on these diastolic variables. Isovolumic relaxation was significantly longer in older subjects than in either the intermediate or the younger age groups. In addition, both the rate of decrease of flow velocity in early diastole and the ratio between maximal early and late diastolic flow velocities were significantly reduced in older subjects. Multivariate linear regression analysis showed that after adjustment for left ventricular wall thickness and cavity dimension, percentage systolic shortening, and heart rate, age continued to correlate significantly with most Doppler indices of diastolic function. The isovolumic relaxation phase and the early and late filling phases of diastole, as assessed by Doppler echocardiography, are importantly and independently affected by aging.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The variability of Doppler echocardiographic estimation of cardiac output at the aortic orifice was investigated in eight healthy subjects. Cross sectional echocardiograms of the aortic orifice and aortic Doppler velocities were recorded and measured by four echocardiographers. Between subject variability was significantly larger than within subject variability for all variables. Variability owing to different echocardiographers and different measurement times was small compared with total variability. Coefficients of variation for aortic annular diameter, aortic velocity integral, and heart rate were 4.1%, 6.4%, and 5.0% respectively. The coefficient of variation for cardiac output was 8.8% and the 95% confidence interval for measurement of cardiac output by the Doppler method was 4.45 to 6.35 l/min. One echocardiographer reanalysed all the recordings and the results showed that recording the echocardiograms introduces a significantly larger source of error than measuring them. Thus serial measurements of cardiac output by the Doppler method can be performed with acceptable reproducibility; this indicates that the technique can be accurately applied in clinical practice.\r"

The indices of systolic function of the two ventricles and those of diastolic function of the right ventricle were generally normal. But in patients with Friedreich's ataxia the time to peak filling rate divided by the diastolic time of the left ventricle was significantly larger than normal. The increase correlated with the heart rate (r = 0.79) and this suggests an alteration in the timing of ventricle filling that is more evident at high heart rates. Movement of the left ventricle was little impaired; however, in 48% of the patients with Friedreich's ataxia the right ventricle showed evidence of hypokinetic segments. Because there is a tendency for congestive heart failure to develop in patients with Friedreich's ataxia, this hypokinesis of the right ventricle should be monitored at follow up.\r"

Ten to twenty-nine months after the procedure the abnormal septal motion had disappeared spontaneously. The cross section of the left ventricular cavity was circular both when septal motion was abnormal and when it was normal. Cross sectional echocardiography showed that there was an exaggerated anterior swinging motion of the heart in systole in patients with abnormal septal motion on the M mode recordings. The left ventricular end diastolic diameter before closure was significantly larger, and its reduction after closure was more pronounced in those with abnormal septal motion than in those without. This suggested that the abnormal septal motion was associated with relief of long standing left ventricular volume overload. It is suggested that acute shrinkage of the heart caused temporary laxity of the pericardium, and consequently more movement of the heart within the thorax. The return of normal septal motion suggests that the pericardium gradually shrank to accommodate the smaller heart.\r"

The suggestion that a variant of this arrangement termed \"disjunction\" was associated with prolapse of the leaflets prompted examination of the mitral atrioventricular junctions in seven normal hearts and six with prolapse owing to floppy mitral valves. A complete cord-like ring of connective tissue that encircled the atrioventricular junction and into which the three components were inserted at the same point was found in only one heart. The remaining hearts all showed a mixture of segments in which either the three components were inserted into a cord or simply met. Disjunction, defined as a separation of the atrial wall-mitral valve junction from the other component, the left ventricular wall, can occur both with and without a cord-like annulus. There was no significant difference in the number of segments around the left atrioventricular junction which showed disjunction in hearts with normal or prolapsing leaflets. The feature termed disjunction is an anatomical variation of the normal morphological characteristics of the left atrioventricular junction.\r"

Analysis from the microelectrodes in the most hypoxic areas of the myocardium revealed significant decreases in myocardial oxygen tension (PmO2) in the control group 15 min after occlusion in the FDA-diluted group. Analysis of other electrodes suggested greater hyperaemic compensatory response in ischaemic border areas in the FDA-treated group.\r"

The coronary reserve, estimated by the hyperaemic response to short periods (10 s) of coronary occlusion was reduced by the stepped increases in isoflurane concentration. Linear relationships were observed between peak hyperaemic flow, volume repayment, repayment: deficit ratio and coronary perfusion pressure. The vasodilation induced by isoflurane was of such magnitude that, at 1.5 MAC, the repayment: deficit ratio was close to unity, indicating that the vasodilatory reserve was almost exhausted.\r"

Anaesthesia was with isoflurane 2.0 MAC (in oxygen) in one group and with a fentanyl-nitrous oxide-atracurium regimen in the other group. In the group receiving fentanyl, anaesthesia caused a significant decrease (63%) in intrinsic clearance from the day 1 value (P less than 0.05) and a 45% decrease in systemic clearance (P less than 0.05). Hepatic plasma flow decreased by 27% (ns). A similar pattern was found with isoflurane: intrinsic clearance decreased by 53% (P less than 0.05) and systemic clearance by 40% (P less than 0.05). Hepatic plasma flow decreased by 40% (ns). In both groups, the values 24 h after anaesthesia were not significantly different from those obtained on day 1. Anaesthesia with either fentanyl-nitrous oxide-atracurium or isoflurane has a marked, but short-lasting effect on the disposition of propranolol, in part as a result of a decrease in intrinsic clearance.\r"

This study investigated its properties and compared them with those of sodium nitroprusside (SNP) in anaesthetized greyhounds. The mean dose response to TNP was obtained by measuring haemodynamic changes in five dogs. With increasing doses, stepwise decreases in mean arterial pressure and progressive increases in heart rate occurred: cardiac index did not change significantly. In a further six greyhounds, SNP and TNP were alternately infused to induce and maintain a 30% reduction in arterial pressure for 30 min. Both drugs were short-acting, decreased systemic vascular resistance and caused tachycardia. Infusion of TNP produced lower plasma and red cell cyanide concentrations; SNP maintained hypotension with significantly less tachycardia. We conclude that there was no outstanding advantage of TNP over SNP when given as a short-term infusion in greyhounds.\r"

The present study has attempted to resolve this paradox. The interaction between helium pressure to 10.1 MPa and anaesthetic agents (pentobarbitone, halothane, methoxyflurane) was investigated at a crustacean glutaminergic excitatory neuromuscular junction which can be modulated by GABA inhibition. Both pressure and the anaesthetics depressed the singly evoked excitatory junctional potential (EJP). During repetitive stimulation, both pressure and pentobarbitone antagonized their own depressant effects by enhancing tetanic potentiation. The additive enhancement at 10.1 MPa was sufficient to increase the pentobarbitone-depressed response above the corresponding normobaric level. No significant antagonism between pressure and any of the anaesthetics was observed on the properties of EJP amplitude and time course, facilitation, potentiation or inhibition. Additivity rather than antagonism is the basis for pressure reversal of anaesthetic depression at this model synapse. The functional antagonism is therefore indirect, and probably involves multiple sites of action for both pressure and anaesthetics.\r"

ED50 concentrations and the relationships between In ED50 and chain length are given for each compound and series. For the n-alkanols, this relationship is well fit by a straight line (r2 = 1.000), with no evidence for a plateau between hexanol and heptanol. The standard free energy of transfer of a methylene group from water to a site of action in Gammarus is given for each series. The value for the esters is significantly smaller than that for the n-alkanols and ketones. These free energies are compared with those from other model systems, with the conclusion that further investigation of the differences between n-alkanols and esters will increase our understanding of the physico-chemical nature of the site(s) of action of general anaesthetics.\r"

Hyoscine delayed morphine absorption. Before operation no fewer than 50% of patients were sedated after MST alone, but this increased to 85% after MST and diazepam. Similarly, only the combination MST and diazepam produced anxiolysis. Postoperative mood was unhappier after MST and hyoscine. Emesis occurred in 40-57% of patients, and was not reduced by hyoscine. Therefore premedication with MST alone did not produce reliable sedation or anxiolysis.

Contamination decreased in an exponential manner. Machines fitted with Selectatec vaporizer mounting systems and with the vaporizer removed showed contamination less than 0.02 parts per million (p.p.m.) of halothane after 12 h flushing. Machines with cage-mounted vaporizers or with vaporizers left connected to the Selectatec block demonstrated persisting contamination. The Fluotec Mk.4 vaporizer showed an improvement on earlier designs in this respect. Background contamination concentrations of greater than 0.05 p.p.m. were measured in a patient-free recovery area of an operating theatre suite. Concentrations increased to 1 p.p.m. when patients were admitted following halothane anaesthesia. Decontamination of anaesthetic machines to concentrations of halothane below those detected as background contamination within recovery areas may allow such machines to be used safely to anaesthetize patients at risk from halothane.\r"

Uninvolved perilesional skin from Darier's patients showed a normal profile of keratin expression, whereas in lesional skin there was apparent delay in the expression of the suprabasal skin specific keratins. Suprabasal keratins were not detected in basal cells, thus there was no true premature keratinization. The presence of hyperproliferative keratins was restricted to suprabasal cells in lesional skin. Four patients were receiving treatment with etretinate at the time of biopsy, but results in these patients did not differ from patients using topical treatments. Etretinate did not influence the profile of keratin expression in uninvolved or involved skin. The expression of type VII collagen was examined and was normal throughout uninvolved and lesional skin in Darier's disease.\r"

The principal advantages of IGSS are the avoidance of toxic reagents and the production of a silver precipitate that is permanent, clearly visible and of sufficient contrast with the reaction products of alternative immunolocalizing techniques to be of value in double-labelling procedures. It seems to localize antigenic determinants well, but does not appear to be particularly sensitive, especially for the demonstration of antibodies to extracellular constituents. Limitations of IGSS include the propensity to non-specific staining, and the need to vary the duration of the development stage during silver enhancement.\r"

The concomitant use of a contraceptive pill gave a lower incidence of menstrual abnormalities. Only seven patients (13%) had to stop the drug. In a further eight patients, a reduction in dose to between 125 and 175 mg daily achieved a compromise of controlling the disease and the side-effects. Side-effects tended to occur early and so regular review during the initial 3 months of treatment is advised.

Clinical features and iris fluorescein angiographic (IFA) findings were analysed with respect to these groups in an attempt to identify features predictive of malignant or locally invasive behaviour. Very small tumours were more likely to be benign (p = 0.029). Glaucoma and episcleral vascular dilatation occurred in ciliary body tumours only. Tumours involving the anterior chamber angle proved more likely to be malignant (p = 0.019). IFA showed a disorganised vasculature and gross late leakage in 4/7 (56%) malignant melanomas as well as in 2/6 (33%) tumours with intermediate cytology. No benign tumours showed these features. Four out of nine (44%) benign tumours, but no tumours with malignant or intermediate cytology, showed complete masking of fluorescence. Early leakage of dye from tumour vessels and a geometric tumour vasculature were not specific features of any tumour category. IFA correlated with the cytology and behaviour of anterior uveal melanocytic tumours in 11/22 (50%) of our cases.\r"

The modified needle has a 45 degrees bend 10 mm from its tip. The tip is rendered slightly bulbous, thus eliminating the step between the outer sleeve and the coaxial portion. This prevents snagging of the posterior capsule and eliminates sleeve slide. The needle has been found especially helpful in deeply recessed eyes, and, when it was rotated, cortical cleaning from the equatorial and superior portions of the capsular bag was easier than with a straight needle. There were no posterior capsular breakages in 54 consecutive cases of the use of this needle.\r"

She had been admitted to hospital for symptoms of abdominal pain and bleeding from multiple sites a few hours earlier. Five days previously she had some proptosis of the other eye and had been treated with antibiotics for suspected orbital cellulitis at another hospital. The oedema and proptosis resolved on high-dose intravenous corticosteroid therapy. Despite attempts to relieve the orbital oedema and raised intraocular pressure with a lateral canthotomy and antiglaucoma medications, the patient lost all perception of light in the right eye and has subsequently developed an optic nerve atrophy.\r"

The differences in calcium excretion before and after loading clearly distinguished absorptive from renal hypercalciuria. A difference higher than 0.035 mmol/kg indicated absorptive hypercalciuria in 6 of 21 patients, whereas in the remaining 15 much lower differences indicated renal hypercalciuria. Resorptive hypercalciuria caused by low serum values of 25-hydroxyvitamin D was considered in 6 of the 15 patients with renal hypercalciuria. These patients had low values of phosphate reabsorption (TmP/GFR) and could be clearly separated by high values of calcium reabsorption (TmCa/GFR), in contrast to patients with renal hypercalciuria who had normal values of TmP/GFR and low values of TmCa/GFR. The correct treatment and prevention of nephrolithiasis caused by hypercalciuria in children should be based on accurate diagnosis; this can be achieved by using the calcium loading test described in this report.\r"

In appropriate cases this less complex technique allows prolonged access to the inferior vena cava whilst providing equal protection from pulmonary embolisation and tumour dissemination; it also reduces morbidity, operating time, difficulty and cost when compared with cardiopulmonary bypass.\r"

The commonest complication was sphincter-weakness incontinence, found in 18%, mainly in patients having a cystoplasty for interstitial cystitis; it was rare for the patient to complain of this incontinence. Ten per cent suffered incontinence due to colonic overactivity and this occurred in patients with neuropathic sphincter-weakness incontinence or an artificial sphincter; all of these patients complained of their incontinence. This was corrected by \"patching\" in all cases. Voiding difficulties requiring clean intermittent self-catheterisation occurred in 15%. More worrying was the universal finding, when looked for by blood gas analysis, of a metabolic acidosis with respiratory compensation. It was concluded that in the absence of neuropathy, sphincter weakness or an artificial sphincter, an unmodified ileocaecal segment substitution cystoplasty is adequate; in the presence of neuropathy, sphincter weakness or an artificial sphincter, a \"pouch\" type of substitution cystoplasty should be performed. All patients should have blood gas analyses from time to time as part of their routine post-operative follow-up.\r"

  ".W": "This retrospective study analyses the fate and associated risk factors of 99 patients who underwent laparotomy for hepatic trauma from 1977 to 1986. Blunt trauma (88 patients) and stab wounds (7 patients) had mortality rates of 36 and 14 per cent respectively. The overall death rate was 35 per cent. Multiple trauma patients had a significantly higher mortality for each additional system that was seriously injured. Pre-operative shock raised the mortality from 20 to 58 per cent (P less than 0.001). For patients over 50 years of age, the mortality rate increased from 30 (younger patients) to 63 per cent (P = 0.028). Minor hepatic wounds required relatively simple surgical measures in 60 patients, yet 13 died (22 per cent) of other causes. More sophisticated surgical management was applied to 27 major hepatic lesions, with 10 deaths (37 per cent). Twelve patients (seven with minor and five with major hepatic wounds) died before surgical treatment of the liver injury could be undertaken. The overall mortality rate of major hepatic wounds was 47 per cent and for minor wounds 30 per cent. However, the difference was not significant (P = 0.152). Resection was resorted to in 15 patients, 5 of whom subsequently died (33 per cent). Classical hepatic lobectomy led to 4 deaths (50 per cent). Among the 35 deaths, 6 were due to the hepatic trauma itself (5 exsanguinations and 1 intra-abdominal sepsis). Isolated hepatic injury was fatal in three patients. We believe that conservative surgical measures should be used whenever possible in patients with hepatic trauma, especially when risk factors are encountered.\r"

Patients with irresectable liver metastases from colorectal cancers were treated with occlusions of the hepatic artery for 1 h twice daily, in combination with intraperitoneal cyclic administration of 5-fluorouracil. The first three patients treated are presented. They all exhibited massive tumour calcifications in the liver reflecting tumour necrosis and resorption. This therapeutic principle must undergo further clinical trials.\r"

Although more extensive lymphadenectomies were performed from 1984, the mortality rate caused by the postoperative pulmonary complications was zero in the later period (1984-1986) compared with a rate of 16 per cent in the earlier period (1981-1983). The incidence of postoperative pulmonary complications was lower in the later series but the difference was not statistically significant. Factors which may have contributed to the decrease in critical pulmonary complications after surgery during the later period were the selection of the posterior mediastinal route for reconstruction, the introduction of selective endobronchial intubation by a double lumen tube with combined epidural anaesthesia, fluid restriction during and after surgery, postoperative mobilization and the administration of an expectorant.\r"

Only one of these eleven lesions was diagnosed preoperatively, and only three of the eleven lesions were detected macroscopically on the resected specimens. The high incidence of such coexisting independent lesions may indicate a possible increased multicentric carcinogenic potential in the non-cancerous epithelium of patients who have had an antecedent oesophageal cancer. These results emphasize the need for careful attention to the choice of margins during surgical resection of the oesophagus.\r"

The series was not homogeneous, 25 of the children having reflux as a complication of a serious congenital abnormality (48 per cent incidence of intestinal malrotation), and 49 presenting with 'idiopathic' reflux (57 per cent incidence of intestinal malrotation). Intestinal malrotation is best detected pre-operatively by careful barium radiology, requiring clinicians to be aware of the association. In our experience, in children over the age of 3 months, both an antireflux operation and Ladd's procedure are often necessary to stop gastro-oesophageal reflux when an intestinal malrotation is present.\r"

Clinical presenting features were abdominal pain (100 per cent), peritonitis (57 per cent), shock (34 per cent) and hypothermia (26 per cent). A third-space syndrome with metabolic acidosis and uraemia was the most common physiological derangement. Age was the only factor that appeared to have influenced the surgeon's decision to perform massive bowel resection (71 years in non-resected versus 64 years in resected patients, P less than 0.006). The overall mortality rate was 71 per cent. Forty-four patients underwent massive bowel resection (mean length of remaining small bowel 60 +/- 40 cm) and twenty-four (54 per cent) survived the procedure. Axillary temperature was higher in survivors (36.7 degrees C versus 36.1 degrees C, P less than 0.03). Early postoperative total plasma protein and albumin concentrations were also higher in survivors (57 versus 46 g/l, P less than 0.005; 27 versus 22 g/l, P less than 0.02). Patients with previous symptoms of atherosclerotic disease and high pre-operative blood urea levels also had a bad prognosis. Survivors had a mean hospital stay of 57 days and parenteral nutrition had to be maintained for a mean of 34 days. The survival rate achieved with massive resection justifies this surgical approach in selected patients with massive bowel infarction.\r"

Any positive information from these radiographs was less likely to be helpful than incidental or inconsistent (and hence potentially misleading). Because of this high 'false positive' rate it is suggested that if the initial diagnosis is suspected appendicitis, urinary tract infection, or non-specific abdominal pain, there is little value in the routine use of abdominal radiographs.\r"

Two of them were on maintenance haemodialysis. All were severely hypertensive in spite of antihypertensive drugs. Atherosclerosis was the cause of renal stenosis in 14 cases and fibromuscular dysplasia in 3. Operative procedures included splenorenal shunt (5), autotransplantation (3), aortorenal bypass (3), hepatorenal bypass (1), bilateral renal endarterectomy (1), renal ostial closure (1) and nephrectomy (3). Mean serum creatinine showed a decrease from 3.76 to 1.65 mg/dl (P less than 0.005). Mean arterial pressure dropped from 161 mmHg to 103 mmHg (P less than 0.001). Systolic and diastolic pressures also showed significant decreases. Two patients died. Four patients required a second operation and the renal function and blood pressure then improved. Renovascular disease must be ruled out in patients with renal insufficiency associated with hypertension, including those patients on haemodialysis. We conclude that renal revascularization surgery is a reliable and efficient form of treatment in selected cases of renal failure of renovascular origin.\r"

To determine the bile acid composition of oesophageal refluxate, 45 patients with abnormal acid gastro-oesophageal reflux with oesophagitis and 10 controls had a size 14 Fr Salem sump tube positioned 5 cm above the lower oesophageal sphincter. Oesophageal contents were continuously aspirated and collected in aliquots every 2 h over 16 h. Fasting, postprandial, upright and supine (nocturnal) periods were assessed and total conjugated bile acids were measured by high pressure liquid chromatography with a sensitivity of 8 mumol/l. Conjugated bile acids were detected in 2 of 10 controls (maximum 40 mumol/l) and in 39 of 45 patients (87 per cent). Eleven patients had peak conjugated bile acid levels greater than 200 mumol/l, and these levels occurred exclusively during the supine (nocturnal) period. Median conjugated bile acid levels during daytime reflux were less than 20 mumol/l which was significantly lower than during nocturnal reflux (median 51 mumol/l, P less than 0.001). Conjugated bile acids are detected in the oesophagus of most patients with oesophagitis and may play a role in the pathogenesis of oesophagitis in some patients with nocturnal gastro-oesophageal reflux.\r"

  ".W": "To determine the reliability of results obtained in preschool children by school nurses with a new device for testing vision, the Scolatest, 153 children aged 4 to 5 years were presented with the Snellen E on the standard American Optical projector and with five letters of the Sheridan test (H, O, V, T and X) on the Scolatest. Another 212 children aged 3 to 4 years were presented with the Allen symbols on the projector and with the Pigassou symbols on the Scolatest. The tests with the projector were given at 6 m by an experienced pediatric orthoptist, those with the Scolatest at 2.5 m by a school nurse. The proportion of good responses was higher with the Pigassou symbols than with the Allen symbols. The results with the Sheridan letters and the Snellen E were similar up to 20/30; beyond 20/30 the Snellen E appeared unreliable. The four vision-testing systems were also presented by a school nurse at 2.5 m on the Scolatest to 102 children aged 4 to 5 years (Snellen E and the five Sheridan letters) and 80 children aged 3 to 4 years (Allen and Pigassou symbols). The proportions of good responses were more comparable. The results suggest that a working distance of 2.5 m should be used in testing vision in preschool children. Visual screening at this distance should test acuity beyond the 20/30 equivalence if results comparable to those at 20 feet with the 20/30 standard requirement are to be obtained.\r"

The cause of the complications may have been inadvertent direct infiltration of the anesthetic into the levator palpebrae superioris, the horizontal rectus muscles and the orbicularis oculi respectively. All the patients recovered spontaneously in 8 to 12 weeks. The clinical course was compatible with myotoxic effects of local anesthetics.\r"

The patients were examined before treatment and after each of two trials with both products. A significant reduction in the mean score for dry-eye-induced keratitis (p = 0.001) and for mucous strands (p = 0.03) was observed following the second of two trials with sodium hyaluronate. A significant reduction in the mean score for burning and irritation was observed with both solutions (p = 0.009). We believe that the elimination of preservatives from artificial tear preparations may substantially reduce the iatrogenic effects of these frequently applied medications.\r"

Forty-three hospitals with 5 to 126 house staff in all eight provinces with medical schools were surveyed; 36 PCs (84%) and 29 CMRs (67%) returned a completed questionnaire. Compared with the CMRs the PCs preferred more prior training (p less than 0.03), estimated as significantly less the time spent by CMRs in required duties (p less than 0.05) and rated as more important the responsibilities of faculty-house staff liaison, house staff leader, house staff role model and teaching house staff (p less than 0.05) and the attributes of clinical judgement, medical knowledge, clinician model and research interests (p less than 0.03). All of the PCs and 97% of the CMRs rated the position as somewhat to very necessary; 83% of the PCs and 66% of the CMRs would not alter the present CMR roles. A total of 92% of the PCs felt that the position was very or somewhat advantageous with respect to a future private practice, compared with 67% of the CMRs (p less than 0.02). Increased administrative and committee duties, decreased teaching and future reductions in house staff were identified as major but reversible threats to the unique quality of the CMR position. We conclude that the CMR has a necessary, important and highly regarded role in Canadian university hospitals that could possibly be improved by regular review by the PC and CMR at each hospital to avoid the identified problems.\r"

The response rates among the two groups were 62% and 39% respectively; groups of 82 and 94 people were obtained. Data were collected by chart review, interview and body measurement. The prevalence rate of ischemic heart disease was 48% for the subjects with diabetes and 22% for those without diabetes. The adjusted odds ratio for development of ischemic heart disease in a person with diabetes was 3.56, for development of cerebrovascular disease 4.57 and for development of peripheral vascular disease 5.51. Logistic regression for macrovascular disease showed that age, sex, smoking, hypertension and obesity could not explain the high rates of complications in the subjects with diabetes. The prevalence rates of ischemic heart disease in adults with and without diabetes are the highest reported in a North American Indian population.\r"

Although the number of surviving infants of very low birth weight (1250 g or less) increased over the study period, the incidence rate of neurologic impairment fell significantly, from 19% to 13% (p less than 0.01), so that there was no significant increase in the absolute number of disabled children. This finding remained valid when two other groups of infants at high risk (those weighing more than 1250 g at birth and having a positive neurologic history and those born at term with asphyxial encephalopathy) were included in the analysis, so that over the decade there was a significant decrease in the incidence of disability among the total group of neonates (p less than 0.01) and no increase in the absolute number of disabled children (23 in 1975 and 19 in 1984). We conclude that neonatal intensive care has contributed to improved survival of neonates at high risk without increasing the burden of major neurologic disability.\r"

  ".W": "Eight hematopathologists independently reviewed 56 consecutive cases of benign and malignant lymphoproliferative disorders (LPD) to determine: (1) the degree of interobserver agreement on the interpretation of immunologic findings on fresh-frozen sections alone and on that of the immunologic findings in conjunction with corresponding hematoxylin and eosin (H & E)-stained histologic sections; (2) whether prior knowledge of morphologic characteristics influences the interpretation of immunohistologic sections; (3) whether immunologic phenotype could be predicted reliably based solely on study of histologic sections; and (4) the significance of immunologic data as an aid in the interpretation of histologic sections. The study was carried out in three independent review sessions consisting of (1) review of immunohistologic sections only, (2) review of the same immunohistologic sections together with histologic sections, and (3) review of the histologic sections alone. A consensus diagnosis was defined as agreement of five or more pathologists on the final diagnosis and identification of the immunophenotype. When the authors compared the total number of major disagreements in the first review session with those in the second, the accuracy of the determination of immunophenotype in the second session was clearly superior (P less than 0.05). Similarly, the total number of major disagreements in the second review session was significantly lower than that in the third review session (P less than 0.001). When histologic diagnoses in the second session were compared with those in the third session, it became apparent that the immunologic data helped the pathologist to correct major misinterpretations in 14 cases (25%). This study is the first to demonstrate quantitatively that (1) knowledge of morphologic features influences and greatly enhances the accuracy of the interpretation of immunologic findings, (2) the immunophenotype of LPD cannot be predicted based on morphologic findings alone, and (3) immunologic findings improve the accuracy of interpretation of histologic findings in situations in which a diagnosis cannot be made from morphologic features only.\r"

After sensitization with the intravenous hematoporphyrin derivative (HpD) or its more purified form of dihematoporphyrin ether (DHE), 630 nm of light from a tunable sensitizer argon light system was delivered to the tumor site through the biopsy channel of a flexible bronchoscope. All patients had received, refused, or were ineligible for conventional surgery, ionizing radiation therapy, or chemotherapy. Before or at 1 month after each treatment, tumor response was evaluated according to the following categories: (1) complete response (CR) (no visible abnormality, and negative biopsy specimen and cytology); (2) partial response (PR) (degree of obstruction or size of tumor reduced more than 50%); (3) some response (SR) (degree of obstruction or size of tumor reduced 20% to 50%); and (4) progression (PROG) (degree of obstruction or size of tumor reduced by less than 20%). Results were as follows: (1) 37% of the tumors treated achieved CR; (2) 55% achieved PR; (3) 4% achieved SR; and (4) 4% were categorized as PROG. Complete follow-up was achieved in all patients. Clinical effect was evaluated 1 month after treatment by comparing the Karnofsky performance status (KPS), dyspnea level, oxygen requirement, and presence of symptoms. Sixty-eight percent had clinical improvement in at least one variable and 48% in two or more variables. The results of this study suggest that PDT can play a useful role in the treatment of endobronchial malignancies.\r"

Metastatic adenocarcinoma of the prostate gland is a malignant entity which often can be palliated effectively by hormonally based therapeutic strategies. In cases of metastatic prostate cancer presenting with typical clinical features, the correct diagnosis can be readily achieved, but in patients with less obvious presentations the diagnosis of prostatic carcinoma may be overlooked. In the current report, a group of elderly men presenting with a clinical syndrome resembling either metastatic primary adenocarcinoma of the lung or primary adenocarcinoma of the lung coexisting with prostate cancer were found in fact to have metastatic prostatic carcinoma as their sole disease process. In each case, cytologic characterization of clinically involved tissue specimens by the prostate specific antigen and prostatic acid phosphatase immunohistochemical markers enabled clinical investigators to arrive at the correct diagnosis. Other clinical features, such as a positive bone scan and an enlarged prostate gland on physical exam and/or radiographic studies were noted to be present in these patients. All the patients in the current series responded to hormonal treatment regimens once the diagnosis of metastatic prostate cancer had been established. In elderly male patients presenting with what appears to be primary adenocarcinoma of the lung, the diagnosis of metastatic prostate cancer should be considered and when necessary evaluated by the use of appropriate clinical and immunohistochemical studies.\r"

The presence of N-myc amplification also has been found to be an independent prognostic factor in neuroblastoma. Patients with multicopy N-myc tumors have rapid tumor progression whereas those with single-copy tumors have a significantly better progression-free survival. The authors examined four primary, untreated neuroblastomas for the N-myc copy number from patients who presented with opsoclonus and myoclonus. All four tumors had single copies of N-myc, and all four patients are alive with no evidence of recurrent disease with 6+ to 54+ months' follow-up. This appears to be the only report of N-myc analysis in this group of children. It would be interesting to analyze more neuroblastomas from patients who present with opsoclonus and myoclonus to determine how many of these patients have single N-myc copy tumors.\r"

From each diet group, 50% of the mice had a cholecystectomy and the other 50% had a sham operation. Two weeks after surgery, each mouse received weekly subcutaneous injections of a carcinogen (dimethylhydrazine, 20 mg/kg) for 12 weeks. After the treatment period, the mice were killed and their large bowels were examined. Evaluation of the results demonstrated that the mice that had a cholecystectomy and a high fat diet had the highest incidence (P less than 0.05) of colonic adenocarcinomas.\r"

The mean serum level of TA-4 in patients with lung SCC was 3.6 times higher than that in healthy controls and even higher in the advanced stages of disease (III, IV). In patients with benign diseases or other types of lung cancer, however, the TA-4 serum level was not different from the controls regardless of the clinical stage. During radiation therapy, the TA-4 levels in patients with lung SCC decreased with reduction in tumor size. It increased again markedly during recurrence. Similarly, patients with SCC of the esophagus and head and neck also showed elevated TA-4 levels but only at advanced stages and in recurrence. It was concluded that TA-4 is highly related to SCC not only of the uterine cervix but also of other organs and that serum level determinations are useful for monitoring therapeutic effects and recurrence of these diseases, despite some limitations.\r"

Eight patients had primary central nervous system (CNS) lymphoma: two of them were diagnosed antemortem; CNS lymphoma was suspected in three others by computerized tomographic (CT) scan and was confirmed at autopsy. The remaining three were diagnosed incidentally at autopsy. All had concurrent infections at autopsy, including opportunistic infection in six and pyogenic infections in two. Opportunistic infections at autopsy in these patients outnumbered those diagnosed clinically. Twelve patients had systemic lymphoma. Three were diagnosed only at autopsy, two of whom had extensive Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) as well. Eight patients were treated with chemotherapy, but died with disseminated disease. Opportunistic infections were found at autopsy in five patients. Secondary involvement of the CNS by lymphoma was frequent (66%) and was not related to previous bone marrow involvement. The authors conclude that the incidence of lymphoma occurring in AIDS may be more frequent than diagnosed clinically. Similarly, multiple opportunistic infections occur in these patients which are not diagnosed premortem and may contribute to early death.\r"

In the neuroblastoma patients, nuclear DNA content was found to be a stable tumor marker irrespective of site (primary versus metastatic) and despite changes with time in tumor progression, maturation, or therapy. The occurrence of DNA aneuploidy, which was detected in 60% of the neuroblastoma patients, paralleled other favorable indicators and was highly associated with survival (P less than 0.001). Of clinical stage, age, primary site, sex, and DNA content, only stage and DNA content correlated with survival. Those patients with favorable stage and DNA aneuploidy had higher survival rates. Further, favorable stage and the presence of DNA aneuploidy were independent prognostic indicators. Abnormal DNA content was also detected in samples from ganglioneuromas in which significant numbers of ganglion cell nuclei were recovered. These results indicate a striking difference between neuroblastoma and adult tumors in which DNA aneuploidy is generally a poor prognostic sign and provide a molecular link between ganglioneuromas and their malignant counterparts.\r"

The DNA pattern was grouped into two types, low ploidy or high ploidy, and results achieved by each method were compared. The coincidence rate was 88.9% (16 in 18). Among the 14 with no or slight pleomorphism the coincidence rate was 100%, while it was only 50% (two in four) in those with moderate or marked nuclear pleomorphism. Therefore, when measuring the nuclear DNA content of cancer cells, the possibility of considerable differences between results of absorption and fluorescence cytophotometry in cases of a moderate or marked pleomorphism has to be considered.\r"

The groups were matched for age and severity of liver disease using Child-Pugh scoring. Patients of both groups had evidence of hypogonadism with a decrease in plasma T levels (P less than 0.02) and of hyperestrogenemia with an increase in E1 (P less than 0.001), E2 (P less than 0.01), and SHBG (P less than 0.01) plasma levels compared with ten healthy age-matched controls. Cirrhotic patients with HCC had significantly lower plasma concentrations of T (P less than 0.02), DHT (P less than 0.01), and DHA (P less than 0.001) than patients with cirrhosis alone. However, the plasma concentrations of A, E1, E2, and SHBG did not significantly differ between these two groups. These results suggest a possible alteration of the estrogen-to-androgen ratio during carcinogenesis of the cirrhotic liver. This is shown by a greater reduction of circulating androgens and a similar elevation of estrogens in the group of cirrhotics with HCC.\r"

Histopathology, certain immunohistochemical markers, and DNA ploidy were evaluated along with clinical variables such as tumor stage, primary site, and patient's age at diagnosis. Children under 1.5 years of age at diagnosis had a much better prognosis than did older ones, and this variable was the best prognostic indicator. Tumor Stages I to II and IVS, primary tumor site above the diaphragm, and tumor differentiation were also related to a better prognosis. The Shimada classification was of no additional prognostic value in our study. Neither was the immunohistochemical marker pattern, but it was sometimes helpful in establishing the tumor diagnosis. Tumor-cell ploidy, however, seemed to afford additional prognostic information because the 11 patients with aneuploid tumors under the age of 1.5 years at diagnosis all survived in contrast to only five of nine patients with diploid tumors in the same age group. It is possible that this was due to a better response to treatment in the aneuploid group. Our results suggest that patients with diploid neuroblastomas of undifferentiated histology and those over the age of 1.5 years at diagnosis might be selected for more intense treatment.\r"

Twenty-one patients were treated after emergency tracheostomy with a course of radiation that usually consisted of 20 Gy in five fractions followed by laryngectomy 1 or 2 days later. Most patients also received postoperative radiotherapy of some type. The follow-up of 18 evaluable patients revealed only two (11%) stomal recurrences--a quite acceptable rate for this high-risk population. Overall, however, local recurrences were seen in ten patients (56%), which is higher than reported in most series of similar tumors. The most likely explanation for this seems to be that the short course preoperative radiation prevented the administration of adequate postoperative radiation for residual disease, which was usually present. An alternative treatment policy would be a planned course of moderate- to high-dose postoperative radiation, which could sterilize tumor in the entire locoregional area including the stoma.\r"

With current treatment since more than 50% of children with PNET/MB can be expected to survive for at least 5 years after diagnosis, determining the evidence of \"late\" recurrence is of increasing concern. Collins has stated that patients with embryonal tumors who survive, disease free, for a period of time equal to the age at diagnosis plus 9 months can be declared cured. This, so-called Collins' law has been applied to patients with PNET/MB. To determine the incidence of \"late\" recurrence, factors which impact on recurrence and applicability of Collins' law, the authors studied all patients diagnosed with PNET/MB at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, and Geisinger Medical Center, Danville, Pennsylvania, between 1970 and 1984. For the 44 patients in this study, the disease-free survival at 5, 10, and 12 years was 54%, 41% and 30%, respectively. For children surviving 5 years, the actuarial survival at 10 years was 75% and at 12 years, 51%. Age, sex, dose of radiotherapy, chemotherapy, or extent of surgery were not predictive of late relapse. Recurrence in three of seven patients (43%) occurred outside the \"period of risk\" as predicted by Collins. It appears that the \"period of risk\" for recurrent central nervous system tumors after PNET/MB is as yet undefined and probably indefinite.\r"

  ".W": "Cutaneous malignant melanomas of the head and neck are prognostically engimatic. In addition to known prognostic determinants of stage and lesion microstage, lesion location also appears to have prognostic importance. The authors have reviewed a series of 83 microstaged head and neck melanoma patients in order to analyze the relative importance of these factors. There were 36 males and 47 females with a median age of 56 years. Eighty-one percent had pathologic Stage I disease, 7% were Stage II, and 12% were Stage III. The primary location was face in 32 patients, neck in 18, ear in 12, and scalp in 21 patients. The actuarial 5-year survival according to lesion thickness was 86% for melanoma less than 1.0 mm, 56% for 1 to 2 mm thick lesions, 47% for 2.1 to 4 mm thick lesions, and 25% for melanomas greater than 4.0 mm. The 5-year survival according to lesion location was 78% for facial and 58% for neck melanomas; for ear and scalp, the respective survivals were 33% and 37%. Median thickness was 2.0 mm for facial and 1.85 mm for neck lesions. It was 2.7 mm for ear and 2.0 mm for scalp lesions (differences not significant). There were no microstage factors that correlated with the adverse prognosis seen with scalp and ear melanomas. Multivariate analysis in the entire series (all clinical stages) showed the following to be significant: stage, thickness, and location of the primary melanoma (all less than 0.0002). In clinical Stage I melanoma, the significant prognostic factors were location (P = 0.035), thickness (P = 0.008), level (P = 0.024), and ulceration (P = 0.035). The prognosis of head and neck melanoma is uniquely influenced by location of the primary lesions in addition to stage, thickness, level, and ulceration, as observed with other cutaneous melanomas at other sites. Ear and scalp melanomas are high-risk lesions whose poor prognosis is not readily explained by any of the microstage factors reviewed.\r"

  ".W": "To quantitatively analyze a coronary arterial segment from a cineangiogram, an end-diastolic or neighboring cineframe is usually selected, such that a possibly existing coronary lesion is visualized optimally, as judged by the cardiologist. However, different cardiologists may select different (although usually neighboring) frames, even when following the same selection criteria. It is also possible that the frames are selected from different cardiac cycles. In this study the effects of such phase shifts on the reproducibility of the quantitative measurements were studied. In a total of 38 consecutive patient films obtained at a filmspeed of 25 frames/sec, the frame 0 demonstrating the severity of a lesion optimally, as judged by a senior cardiologist, the three preceding frames, the three following frames and one frame exactly one cycle prior to or following frame 0 were selected; frame 0 was always chosen in the end-diastolic phase of the cardiac cycle. In each film one coronary arterial segment with a focal lesion was analyzed quantitatively in these eight frames with the Cardiovascular Angiography Analysis System (CAAS). No significant differences were found in the mean difference and the standard deviations of the differences (variabilities) in the obstruction diameter, interpolated reference diameter, percent diameter stenosis, extent of the obstruction and area of atherosclerotic plaque obtained in the various frames with respect to frame 0. Therefore, it may be concluded that the selection of a cineframe for quantitative analysis in the end-diastolic phase of the cardiac cycle is not very critical; in other words, the obstruction measurements are not time-dependent for frames in the end-diastolic phase.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Between February 1985 and May 1987, 72 patients with mitral stenosis (MS) underwent percutaneous transluminal mitral valvuloplasty (PTMV). The retrograde transarterial double-balloon technique was used on 54/72 patients (75%); 16 males, 38 females; mean age: 39 +/- 11 years. Transseptal catheterization was used to place two 0.035\", 350-cm exchange wires into the ascending aorta in order to be snared, retrieved, and exteriorized, each through a femoral artery. Over these wires, the balloon dilation catheters were advanced through the femoral artery, retrogradely, across the mitral valve, for PTMV. The transmitral mean gradient fell [18 +/- 4 to 9 +/- 5 mmHg (P less than 0.001)]; the cardiac output increased [5.1 +/- 0.8 6.1 +/- 0.8 L/min (P less than 0.001)]; the hemodynamically calculated valve area increased [1.2 +/- 0.2 to 2.3 +/- 0.6 cm2 (P less than 0.001)]; and the short axis two-dimensional echocardiographic valve area increased [1.1 +/- 0.3 to 2.2 +/- 0.7 (P less than 0.001)]. PTMV was unsuccessful in two patients (4%), due to the inability to maintain the inflated balloons in the mitral position. Significant complications were encountered in two patients: two strokes (3.7%) and one mortality from the stroke (1.4%). Significant mitral regurgitation occurred in two patients (3.7%); no post-PTMV hemodynamically significant atrial septal defects were detected. Follow-up (mean time: 11 +/- 6 months) of 43 patients showed a persistent improvement in echocardiographic findings in 27 (63%) and hemodynamically measured mitral valve area in the 16 patients in which cardiac catheterization was repeated. The retrograde, transarterial double-balloon technique can successfully accomplish PTMV with good results and an acceptable low morbidity and mortality.\r"

Pulsed Doppler ultrasound was found to have only a 20% sensitivity in detecting prosthetic mitral valve regurgitation documented by left ventriculography. Possible reasons for this poor sensitivity include 1) an eccentric jet not identified by the small pulsed Doppler sample volume; 2) prosthesis interference with the Doppler signal in the apical four chamber view; and 3) the large angle of incidence between the pulsed Doppler signal and the regurgitant jet. Mitral insufficiency, especially when not severe, may be missed by this technique. Care must be taken in interpreting negative results from a pulsed Doppler ultrasound evaluation of a prosthetic mitral valve.\r"

Imaging was R wave-triggered at 58-msec intervals (13/level). Left ventriculography was performed in 30 degrees right anterior oblique (RAO) and 60 degrees left anterior oblique (LAO) caudal 12 degrees. CT left ventricular ejection fraction was measured using a modified Simpson's reconstruction of end-systolic and end-diastolic slices. Catheterization left ventricular ejection fraction was measured by area-length method. Six left ventricular segments (septal, apex, anterior, lateral, inferior, and posterior) were scored by different paired observers as follows: dyskinesis (-1), akinesis (0), moderate-severe hypokinesis (1), mild hypokinesis (2), and normal (3). Correlations of left ventricular ejection fraction for catheterization vs. long-axis CT and short-axis CT were r = .83 and r = .86, respectively. Seven of eight patients with transmural myocardial infarction were identified on CT by akinetic/dyskinetic segments. Eighty-four segments were scored. There was agreement (normal vs. abnormal) in 76 (90%). CT detected 47 normal segments vs. 51 by catheterization (92%), 11 akinetic/dyskinetic segments (92%), and 14 hypokinetic segments vs. 21 (67%). Wall motion scores between CT and catheterization differed by greater than 1 in 6 of 84 segments (7%). Therefore, ultrafast CT can accurately assess global and regional left ventricular function.\r"

The diagnostic features of this mass as imaged by these two methods are compared. This case was complicated in that the patient had a history of right atrial myxoma that had been successfully removed three years previously, and a history of several prior pulmonary emboli. Gated MRI depicted the size, shape, and surface characteristics of the mass more clearly than 2-D echocardiography because MRI provided better contrast and spatial resolution. Both techniques were useful in localizing the mass and showing if it was fixed or mobile. Depiction of tumor attachment was unclear with echocardiography but very clear with MRI. MRI also showed a left pulmonary artery thrombus that was not visualized by 2-D echocardiography. Both techniques provided chamber dimension measurements showing enlargement of the right atrium and ventricle. This case demonstrates that gated MRI provides high-quality images of cardiac anatomy and masses. Gated cardiac MRI should be considered at least complementary and potentially superior to two-dimensional echocardiography in the evaluation of intracardiac masses in certain patients.\r"

  ".W": "We have previously reported that a potent new beta-blocker, tertatolol, when given at therapeutic doses to healthy volunteers, rapidly reduced the number of human mononuclear leukocyte beta-receptors. In the present study, the mechanism of receptor regulation by beta-antagonists incubated with target cells in vitro was investigated. Two different cell types (human mononuclear leukocytes and S49 murine lymphoma cells) were used, and beta-adrenergic receptors were measured using either the hydrophilic ligand 3H-CGP 12177 (specific for surface receptors) or lipophilic 125I-pindolol (which measures total receptors). In a comparison between beta-blockers, tertatolol and bopindolol, but not propranolol and pindolol, were found to rapidly (1 hour at 37 degrees C) reduce the number of beta-adrenergic receptors. This was paralleled by a reduction in isoproterenol-stimulated cyclic AMP accumulation. The reduction in receptors was the same whether surface or total receptors were measured; thus, it was not due to receptor sequestration. This effect was not caused by partial agonist activity (bopindolol is a weak partial agonist); in parallel experiments, tertatolol and bopindolol, but not pindolol (potent partial agonist) and isoproterenol (full agonist), reduced beta-adrenergic receptors. Finally, this effect was not due to irreversible binding: the receptor reduction induced by the irreversible blocker bromo-acetyl-alprenolol-methane (BAAM) was stable for several hours, while the effect of tertatolol and bopindolol was slowly reversed over the same time course. We suggest that tertatolol and bopindolol have two effects on beta-adrenergic receptors: they bind competitively, and then they modify the receptors so that they are no longer available for binding by ligands or catecholamines.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "We have used two different cultured cell lines--S49 lymphoma cells and BC3H-1 muscle cells--to examine the regulation of beta-adrenergic receptors by receptor antagonists. Rather than an increase (\"up-regulation\") of receptor number that such antagonists often produce, we found that certain beta-blockers elicit a decrease (\"down-regulation\") of beta-adrenergic receptors. Alprenolol and propranolol, but not sotalol or ICI 118,551, at concentrations of 10-100 nM down-regulated beta-adrenergic receptors 20-70% following 16-20 hours of treatment of S49 or BC3H-1 cells. Several observations suggest that this phenomenon depends upon beta-receptor interaction, including stereoselectivity [(-)-enantiomers more potent than (+)-enantiomers], blockade of the effect by ICI 118,551, absence of down-regulation of alpha-adrenergic receptors in BC3H-1 cells, and lack of a decrease in beta-adrenergic receptor-independent (forskolin-stimulated) cyclic AMP accumulation in S49 cells. The possibility of retained antagonist interfering with receptor measurement was precluded by the fact that the antagonist-induced decrease in receptor number required several hours incubation and occurred without a prominent change in receptor affinity. The ability of the beta-blockers to elicit down-regulation did not correlate with hydrophobicity of the drugs. Antagonist-induced down regulation of beta-adrenergic receptors did not occur in S49 lymphoma cells that lack the alpha-subunit of Gs, the guanine nucleotide-binding regulatory protein, thus implying a requirement for receptor-alpha s interaction in eliciting beta-receptor down-regulation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The arrhythmia was investigated in in vitro and in vivo experiments. In in vitro experiments, AP-A (50 micrograms/l) produced bradycardia-dependent prolongation of action potential duration that was more pronounced in Purkinje than in muscle fibers. Only Purkinje fibers developed early afterdepolarizations (EAD) and triggered activity. These effects could be abolished by rapid pacing, lidocaine (4 mg/l), or tetrodotoxin (1 mg/l). In vivo experiments were conducted in anesthetized healthy dogs with simultaneous recording of surface ECG, monophasic action potentials from the endocardial and epicardial surface of the left ventricle by contact electrode catheter technique, and transmembrane action potentials from the epicardial surface of the left ventricle with a floating microelectrode technique. AP-A in a dose comparable to that used in vitro (4 micrograms/kg, i.v. bolus) resulted in bradycardia-dependent marked prolongation of both monophasic and transmembrane action potentials. An EAD gradually appeared on both recordings but was more marked in endocardial monophasic action potentials. Eventually, a premature ventricular depolarization arose from or very close to the peak of the EAD. The prolongation of action potentials was associated with similar prolongation of the QTU interval in surface ECG, and in some experiments, the EAD corresponded to a distinct prominent U wave. A ventricular premature depolarization arose from the U or TU complex and initiated polymorphic ventricular tachyarrhythmias that terminated spontaneously or degenerated into ventricular fibrillation. These effects were reversed by rapid pacing or lidocaine (1 mg/kg). The present study provides evidence in support of the hypothesis that AP-A-induced ventricular tachyarrhythmias are due to bradycardia-dependent EAD and triggered activity.\r"

Perfusion of hearts with Ca2+-free medium for 5 minutes did not affect the Na+-dependent Ca2+ uptake, ATP-dependent Ca2+ uptake, or Ca2+-stimulated ATPase activities in sarcolemma. Reperfusion of the Ca2+-deprived hearts with medium containing Ca2+ for 1-2 minutes increased Na+-dependent Ca2+ uptake, whereas reperfusion for 5-10 minutes decreased Na+-dependent Ca2+ uptake in sarcolemmal vesicles. Both ATP-dependent Ca2+ uptake and Ca2+-stimulated ATPase activities in sarcolemma were depressed on reperfusion of Ca2+-deprived hearts for 2-10 minutes. Reperfusion of Ca2+-deprived hearts for 5 minutes, which failed to generate contractile force, resulted in contracture without any recovery of the contractile force development. These changes in sarcolemmal Ca2+ transport and contractile function were prevented when hearts were perfused with Ca2+-free medium either in the presence of low sodium (35 mM) or at a low temperature (21 degrees C) before starting the reperfusion. No alterations in the purity of the preparation or permeability of sarcolemmal vesicles with respect to Na+ or Ca2+ were detected in hearts perfused with Ca2+-free medium or on reperfusion with medium containing calcium. The results indicate abnormalities in sarcolemmal Na+-Ca2+ exchange and Ca2+-pump mechanisms on reperfusion of Ca2+-deprived hearts with medium containing Ca2+, and such changes may partly account for the occurrence of intracellular Ca2+ overload during the development of calcium paradox.\r"

An acute open-chest procedure was performed in nine pigs 27 +/- 2 days (mean +/- SEM) after surgical placement of the ameroid occluder, and in eight nonoperated control pigs. Coronary vascular resistances were measured during maximal coronary vasodilation with adenosine. Minimal coronary resistance was assessed before and after cannulation and extracorporeal perfusion of the left circumflex coronary artery distal to the site of the ameroid occluder in pigs from the ameroid group and in a similar site in control pigs. Minimal coronary resistance to antegrade reflow in the left circumflex region was decreased significantly in ameroid pigs compared with control pigs (0.06 +/- 0.01 vs. 0.26 +/- 0.03 mm Hg.min.100 g/ml, p less than 0.001, respectively). Decreased minimal coronary vascular resistance was present transmurally in the left circumflex region of ameroid pigs. Altered vascular resistance occurred only in myocardium distal to the ameroid occluder since the nonoccluded left anterior descending region in ameroid pigs had minimal coronary resistance similar to that of the same region from control pigs (0.23 +/- 0.03 vs. 0.19 +/- 0.02 mm Hg.min.100 g/ml). Thus altered minimal coronary vascular resistance occurs and probably reflects vascular proliferation and/or vascular alterations which result in an increased total cross-sectional area of the vasculature in the myocardium distal to the occlusion.\r"

  ".W": "One component of muscarinic receptor inhibition of the function of cardiac ventricles is mediated by the inhibition of activated adenylate cyclase activity in sarcolemma. We have shown previously that muscarinic agonists inhibit GTP- but not Gpp(NH)p-activated adenylate cyclase activity, and various studies in other tissues indicate that nonhydrolyzable GTP analogues prevent inactivation of the enzyme. These data have suggested a role for GTP hydrolysis in the mechanism of inhibition of adenylate cyclase. The present study demonstrates that purified canine cardiac sarcolemma displays high-affinity GTPase activity that is reciprocally related to adenylate cyclase activity. The high-affinity GTPase activity was stimulated by muscarinic agonists and blocked by atropine. Furthermore, the one-half maximal effects of oxotremorine for binding to muscarinic receptors, stimulation of high-affinity GTPase activity, and inhibition of adenylate cyclase activity were similar. Muscarinic stimulation of GTPase activity and inhibition of adenylate cyclase activity required functional activity of the pertussis toxin (IAP) substrate(s). Treatment of sarcolemmal membranes with IAP attenuated the ability of oxotremorine to both stimulate high-affinity GTPase activity and inhibit adenylate cyclase activity. These studies indicate that muscarinic receptor stimulation of high-affinity GTPase activity dependent on functional IAP substrate(s) is closely linked to the mechanism of muscarinic inhibition of adenylate cyclase activity.\r"

  ".W": "Brief (15-minute) coronary occlusion and subsequent reperfusion lead to prolonged functional and metabolic abnormalities (stunned myocardium). Previous work suggests that one factor responsible for this phenomenon is oxygen-derived free radicals. The formation of the highly reactive hydroxyl radical requires the presence of metal ions, most importantly iron. In the present study, the effect of the iron-chelator deferoxamine on the recovery of segment shortening (%SS) in the stunned myocardium was compared with a control group in barbital anesthetized dogs. Deferoxamine (500 mg intra-atrially) was administered 15 minutes prior to and throughout 15 minutes of coronary occlusion. %SS, regional myocardial blood flow, hemodynamics, and myocardial high-energy phosphates were measured. Areas at risk, collateral blood flow, and all hemodynamic parameters were similar between control and deferoxamine-treated animals. While deferoxamine did not prevent the loss of systolic wall function that occurred during ischemia, deferoxamine significantly improved the recovery of %SS at all times throughout reperfusion (3-hour %SS of pretreatment: control, 12 +/- 11; deferoxamine, 65 +/- 12), normalized endocardial ATP (percent of nonischemic area: control, 79 +/- 3%, deferoxamine, 93 +/- 6%), attenuated the reperfusion-induced rebound increase in phosphocreatine and prevented the increase in tissue edema at 3 hours after reperfusion. Thus, deferoxamine exhibited a cardioprotective action both metabolically and functionally in the stunned myocardium presumably by decreasing the redox cycling, and hence, the availability of catalytic iron for use in hydroxyl radical formation and for the initiation of lipid peroxidation. These data suggest a possible role for the hydroxyl radical as a mediator of postischemic abnormalities in reversibly injured tissue.\r"

Left ventricles of isolated cross-circulated dog hearts were connected to a large air tank through the mitral annulus. The volume of the air space was changed with a volume servo pump to oscillate the transmural pressure (P) around zero. Instantaneous LV volume (V) was computed from P by Boyle's law (P.V = constant) to draw the PV trajectories of the isobaric contractions. The end-systolic PV relation (ESPVR) and end-diastolic PV relation (EDPVR) curves intercepted the volume axis at two different volumes (Vo and Vu, respectively). The slopes of both ESPVR and EDPVR curves as well as Vo and Vu were variably influenced by positive and negative inotropic states, heart rate changes, arrhythmias, ischemia, and rigor. In control before any interventions, LV stroke and suction volume (delta V = Vu - Vo) at zero P was 7.5 +/- 2.5 (SD) ml/100 g left ventricle, which changed with the changes in Vo and Vu. delta V decreased with decreases in P from zero and virtually vanished at a pressure (Pn) of -9.5 +/- 2.0 mm Hg. Directly measured LV dead volume (Vd) at Pn was 4.1 +/- 1.3 ml/100 g. The results seem essential for evaluation of LV filling and suction during diastole.\r"

We determined the effects of arginine vasopressin on blood flow (microspheres) to the choroid plexus in anesthetized and awake rabbits. In anesthetized rabbits, blood flow to the choroid plexus was 342 +/- 31 (mean +/- SEM) ml/min/100 g under control conditions. Intravenous infusion of vasopressin at 4 and 40 mU/kg increased plasma vasopressin levels from 11 +/- 1 to 55 +/- 15 and 441 +/- 120 pg/ml, respectively, and blood flow to the choroid plexus decreased by 48 +/- 6% and 70 +/- 4%. Cerebral blood flow was not affected by infusion of vasopressin. Similar responses to infusion of vasopressin were observed in awake rabbits. The V1 antagonist [d(CH2)5Tyr(Me)AVP] (10 micrograms/kg i.v.) had no effect on resting blood flow, but abolished the effect of vasopressin on blood flow to the choroid plexus. Vasoconstrictor responses of the choroid plexus to intravenous infusion of phenylephrine were not attenuated by the V1 antagonist. Thus, circulating vasopressin, at plasma levels that are observed under physiological and pathophysiological conditions, has marked effects on blood flow to the choroid plexus. These effects appear to be mediated through a V1 receptor. We speculate that vasopressin may play an important role in regulation of blood flow to the choroid plexus and perhaps in the regulation of cerebrospinal fluid production.\r"

This interaction is dependent upon intracellular ionized calcium and is controlled by the troponin-tropomyosin regulatory proteins situated along the actin filament. In this study, we compared the myofibrillar content and myofibrillar Mg-ATPase activity of normal human ventricular muscle with that of ventricular muscle from patients in end-stage failure caused by coronary artery disease or cardiomyopathy and ventricular muscle from patients with heart failure due to mitral valve insufficiency. The results show that the amount of myofibrillar protein (mg/g wet wt ventricle) in hearts in end-stage failure (coronary artery disease and cardiomyopathy) is significantly lower compared with normal hearts and hearts in failure due to mitral valve insufficiency. However, the Mg-ATPase activity of myofibrils from hearts in both end-stage failure and failure due to mitral valve insufficiency is significantly lower compared with myofibrils from normal hearts. The data suggest that the reduction in the amount of myofibrillar protein in ventricular tissue is a pivotal event that may be responsible for the progression of heart disease to the point of end-stage failure.\r"

  ".W": "We studied the relation of the maximal upstroke velocity (Vmax) of action potentials to the peak sodium current (INa) under voltage clamp in single, internally perfused, canine cardiac Purkinje cells under conditions that ensured membrane action potentials due only to INa. Three different methods of altering sodium channel availability were investigated: voltage-dependent inactivation, tetrodotoxin (TTX) block, and use-dependent block by quinidine. Under all three conditions, the relation of Vmax to INa was nonlinear, and no relation was found that would allow prediction of INa results from Vmax measurements. With voltage-dependent inactivation or TTX block, sodium channel availability measured by Vmax was reduced less than availability measured by peak INa, so that Vmax overestimated sodium channel availability. This overestimation of sodium channel availability by Vmax could be attributed to greater sodium channel mobilization during the slowed action potential upstrokes. The overestimation varied with experimental temperature as a consequence of changes in sodium channel kinetics. Vmax also overestimated sodium channel availability during TTX exposure so that the Kd for TTX block was 4.5 micron from Vmax measurements but only 1.6 microM from INa measurements. Use-dependent block of INa by quinidine had a striking voltage-dependent component under voltage clamp that could not be appreciated from action potentials. Consequently, block could be underestimated or overestimated by Vmax measurements. We conclude that Vmax measurements represent a convenient index for INa, but Vmax is not a reliable method for quantitative studies of sodium channel behavior.\r"

Animals with volume-overload hypertrophy were killed at a time when left ventricular end-diastolic pressure and stiffness were increased. The collagens were characterized by solubility properties, sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The percentage of collagen obtained from canine left ventricles was decreased from 32.4% in normal hearts to 15.0% in hypertrophied hearts. We attribute this to a diminution in the extractability of types I and III collagen, which fell from 199.5 mg type I/g collagen and 76.4 mg type III/g collagen in normal hearts to 83.5 mg type I/g collagen and 26.4 mg type III/g collagen in hypertrophied hearts. The amount of types IV and V collagen isolated remained constant in both the control and arteriovenous shunt hearts averaging 15.7 mg type IV/g collagen and 32.1 mg type V/g collagen in control hearts and 12.5 mg type IV/g collagen and 28.9 mg type V/g collagen in hypertrophied hearts. The reduction in quantity of types I and III collagen probably reflects a greater degree of cross-linking in these two types of collagen. Cyanogen bromide peptide analysis confirmed that there was an increase of high molecular weight cross-linked peptides from 3.96% in normal samples to 8.88% in hypertrophied samples. We conclude that cross-linking of types I and III collagen increases in volume-overload hypertrophy and that this is associated with a rise in diastolic stiffness.\r"

The purpose of this investigation was to avoid barotrauma by defining, in vitro, the limits of pulse amplitude and pulse width for rectangular constant-current pulses that do not result in voltage breakdown and subsequently to determine what pulsing frequency is safe for use when high-energy trains of pulses are used. Electric pulses were delivered with a variable waveform modulator with a wide dynamic range and bandwidth capable of delivering pulses of 30-10,000-mu sec duration with amplitudes of up to 25 A. Cathodal pulses were delivered to a 6F catheter immersed in fresh anticoagulated bovine blood warmed to 37 degrees C to stimulate the milieu of a catheter in the chambers of the human heart. The maximum pulse amplitude that could be delivered without incurring voltage waveform breakdown varied inversely with pulse duration. Pulses of 30 mu sec broke down at currents above 24 A (2,500 V). Pulses of 10,000-mu sec duration broke down at 1 A (250 V). The maximum safely delivered energy for a single pulse was 2.5 J for pulses of 80-120 mu sec. Peak power for single pulses was maximum at 50-55 kW with 30-50-mu sec pulses. Charge delivery for single pulses was maximized at 9 mC with long, 10,000-mu sec duration pulses. To deliver an electrical pulse with energy significantly greater than 2.5 J without incurring voltage breakdown, trains of pulses were delivered where each pulse in the train had previously been shown to be free of voltage breakdown.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Diabetes was induced by streptozotocin after the first observation period and the plasma glucose concentration exceeded 500 mg% by the age of 10-11 weeks. Microvascular growth was quantitated by measurements of the number, length, and maximally dilated inner diameters of specific arterioles and by intercapillary distances in the marked intestinal region at both ages. Although intestinal enlargement was much greater in diabetics, there was no change in the number of arterioles during maturation and intercapillary distances were equivalent in diabetic and normal rats. In normal and diabetic animals, the arteriolar length increased to match bowel elongation, however, increases in bowel and arteriolar lengths in diabetic animals were about twice that of normal rats. During juvenile maturation, the maximally dilated inner diameters of the small arterioles in diabetic animals were increased compared with their normal counterparts. Thus, arteriolar growth during maturation is characterized by changes in the length but not in the number of vessels in intestine of both normal and diabetic rats. The perfusion of about 90% more tissue by mass for each arteriole in diabetic rats is facilitated by arteriolar dilation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

We investigated two aspects of the problem in a Wiggers hemorrhagic shock model of the rat: the survival rate and the microvascular no-reflow phenomenon. A conventional group of rats with normal blood cells and a neutropenic group of rats pretreated with intraperitoneal antigranulocyte antibody were used to evaluate the effects of granulocytes. Two hemorrhagic shock protocols (HSP) were carried out. In HSP-1, the rats were subjected to 40 mm Hg mean arterial pressure for 3 hours. The conventional group (n = 11) showed a 36% survival rate compared with 100% in the neutropenic group (n = 6). In HSP-2, the hypotension was more severe, 30 mm Hg mean arterial pressure for 7 hours. There were no survivors in the conventional group (n = 8), compared with a 100% survival rate in the neutropenic group (n = 6). The extent, location, and mechanism of the no-reflow phenomenon was investigated by examining histological sections from several organs after infusion of a contrast medium to mark vessels with flow in a control group without shock and in the HSP-2 model 2 hours after blood replacement. The arterioles and venules uniformly contained contrast medium in all three groups; only capillaries showed no-reflow. A significantly higher percentage of no-reflow was observed in the capillaries of the conventional shock group than in the neutropenic shock group. We concluded that the obstruction of capillaries was largely due to trapped granulocytes, suggesting that these leukocytes play a key role in the capillary no-reflow phenomenon and survival from hemorrhagic shock.\r"

We have identified specific messenger RNAs that change in predominance with the induction of pressure-overload-stimulated cardiac hypertrophy. Total cardiac RNA was isolated from rats either undergoing cardiac hypertrophy secondary to subdiaphragmatic aortic constriction or subjected to sham surgery. The products translated in vitro were separated by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and quantitated. The translation of four proteins decreased while the translation of four others increased in preparations from hypertrophied hearts compared with those from sham-treated rats. Two isoforms of creatine kinase M were translated in vitro. Only one of these isoforms decreased with cardiac hypertrophy, suggesting that the transcriptional or translational control for creatine kinase is much more complex than previously believed. Finally, since only eight of over 700 different translation products changed in relative predominance with cardiac hypertrophy, we conclude that the accumulation of existing RNA and protein products is the primary adaptive process responsible for cardiac hypertrophy.\r"

  ".U": "88282754\r", 
  ".W": "Myocardial ischemia causes both systolic and diastolic dysfunction. A variety of positive inotropic agents with different subcellular mechanisms may be used clinically in an attempt to reverse ischemic contractile failure. We tested the hypothesis that two inotropic agents, isoproterenol (a beta-adrenergic agonist) and ouabain (a sodium pump inhibitor), might have different effects on left ventricular (LV) diastolic function during ischemic failure despite an equivalent inotropic effect. Isolated isovolumic (balloon-in-LV) blood perfused rabbit hearts were paced at constant physiological heart rate (4 Hz), given either no drug (controls, n = 7), isoproterenol (n = 7), or ouabain (n = 7), and then subjected to 6 minutes of low flow ischemia (75% reduction of baseline coronary flow). The doses of isoproterenol and ouabain were selected to produce equivalent modest inotropic effects (15% increase in LV + dP/dt) in each heart during baseline perfusion conditions. During the ischemic period, there was a marked decrease in contractility, and neither isoproterenol nor ouabain demonstrated a positive inotropic effect relative to the control group. However, these agents had markedly different effects on diastolic chamber distensibility (assessed by end-diastolic pressure at constant LV volume) during ischemia. In the control and isoproterenol groups, diastolic chamber distensibility did not change during the ischemic period. In contrast, ouabain treatment resulted in a marked decrease in diastolic chamber distensibility during ischemia; this change was not completely reversible during the 10-minute reperfusion period. The mechanism by which ouabain decreased diastolic chamber distensibility relative to isoproterenol was assessed indirectly. The ouabain and isoproterenol groups were subjected to equivalent degrees of ischemia as assessed by oxygen supply/demand imbalance; during ischemia, each drug group did not differ with regard to myocardial perfusion rates, determinants of myocardial oxygen demand (heart rate, LV developed pressure, LV + dP/dt), myocardial oxygen consumption, lactate production, and ATP and creatine phosphate content. We therefore inferred that the greater decrease in diastolic distensibility in the ouabain group was not due to a greater metabolic severity of ischemia. These observations are consistent with a mechanism of cytosolic calcium overload induced by ouabain, resulting in persistent active myofilament tension development throughout diastole, to cause the observed decrease in diastolic chamber distensibility during ischemia in the ouabain group.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

Whole-cell ICa free of other overlapping currents was recorded with a suction pipette. The intracellular environment was varied by intracellular dialysis. The properties of ICa were similar in dog and guinea pig ventricular myocytes, except that the amplitude of ICa was larger in the latter (2.2 +/- 0.5 nA in guinea pig cells and 0.9 +/- 0.2 nA in dog cells, n = 8 for both). In both types of cells during restitution a holding voltage (Vh) negative to -50 mV induced a transient increase in ICa above the control level (ICa overshoot). This overshoot was inhibited by substituting barium for calcium, lowering [Ca]0, increasing intracellular calcium buffering capacity, ryanodine (1-2 microM), or caffeine (10 mM). The overshoot peaked 30-100 msec after repolarization from the conditioning depolarization and gradually declined over the following 2-3 seconds. During the overshoot, although the amplitude of ICa was larger its half-time of decay was longer than the control. The maximum overshoot occurred following a conditioning step to plateau voltages and it was decreased by prolonging the conditioning step from 50 to 100 or 500 msec. It is concluded that intracellular calcium regulates restitution of the L-type calcium channels in mammalian ventricular myocytes and that the sarcoplasmic reticulum is involved in this process.\r"

Nine open-chest, anesthetized pigs were instrumented to monitor regional coronary blood flow and segment shortening, left ventricular dP/dt, heart rate, and pulmonary artery and aortic blood pressures and to sample arterial and regional coronary venous blood for oxygen content and complete blood counts. Intracoronary infusion of human or porcine C5a in doses ranging from 10 to 500 ng produced a significant reduction in regional coronary blood flow and myocardial function. Although perfusion pressure and heart rate remained constant, venous oxygen content fell, indicating an imbalance between myocardial oxygen supply and demand. In addition, the arteriovenous difference of white blood cells was increased significantly after anaphylatoxin infusion, indicating intravascular trapping in the myocardium. Granulocytes accounted entirely for the differences in leukocyte counts because no significant changes in platelet, lymphocyte, or hematocrit levels were observed.

Seven patients presented with syncopal episodes, and six of the seven had documented episodes of ventricular tachycardia. All patients had depressed left ventricular ejection fraction with cardiomegaly. Six of the seven had dilated cardiomyopathy in the absence of significant coronary disease. Twelve-lead electrocardiograms in all seven patients during sinus rhythm were remarkably similar; six demonstrated intraventricular conduction defect resembling left bundle branch block, and one showed left anterior fascicular block. All patients showed prolonged His-to-ventricle intervals during sinus rhythm. Sustained ventricular tachycardia (with atrioventricular dissociation) because of bundle branch reentry was induced in all patients during baseline electrophysiological study. The His-to-ventricle intervals during tachycardia were similar to those seen during sinus rhythm. Electrical ablation of the right bundle branch was accomplished in each patient with delivery of two electrical shocks (170-310 J) through electrode catheters. Right bundle branch block developed on their surface electrocardiogram immediately after the ablation. Follow-up electrophysiological studies showed no inducible ventricular tachycardia. Clinical follow-up showed no recurrence of syncope or ventricular tachycardia. From the data presented, the following can be concluded. First, right bundle branch ablation is a safe and promising means of treating ventricular tachycardia because of bundle branch reentry and can obviate the need for antiarrhythmic drug therapy and its frequent undesirable side effects. Second, there are common clinical and electrophysiological characteristics that are frequently seen in patients with this tachycardia, and the recognition of these common characteristics should alert the physician to a bundle branch reentrant mechanism of ventricular tachycardia.\r"

The ventriculograms and coronary angiograms obtained in 170 patients 10.4 +/- 7.4 days after infarction were analyzed to evaluate the effects of thrombolytic therapy on global and regional systolic function. Streptokinase treatment resulted in a higher patency rate of the infarct-related artery (68.5%) than did standard therapy (44.8%) (p = 0.003). Ejection fraction was higher in streptokinase-treated patients (54% vs. 51%, p = 0.056), and the difference was most marked in patients with anterior myocardial infarction (53% vs. 44%, p = 0.03). Regional wall motion was measured by the centerline method and expressed in mean +/- SD motion in 52 normal subjects. There was a trend toward better function of the infarct zone in streptokinase-treated patients (SD, -2.48 vs. -2.70, p = 0.24). Additionally, streptokinase-treated patients had significantly better wall motion of noninfarct areas (SD, 0.36 vs. -0.08, p = 0.02). Treatment effects on function of noninfarct regions were most apparent in the subset of patients with multivessel disease. Thus, intravenous streptokinase preserves left ventricular function in patients with acute myocardial infarction. This benefit includes favorable effects on the function of regions remote from the site of infarction.\r"

Thus, cardiac catheterization for the assessment of valve lesion severity may be unnecessary in selected patients. We prospectively evaluated 75 consecutive patients, ages 20-74 years (mean, 52 years), with clinically suspected valvular heart disease. Specific clinical and Doppler echocardiographic criteria were used to categorize each valve lesion as absent, insignificant, or significant. Criteria for a significant lesion at cardiac catheterization was an aortic or mitral valve area less than 1.1 or 1.5 cm2, respectively, or equal to or greater than 3+ cm2 aortic or mitral regurgitation at angiography. In all valve lesions, Doppler echocardiography had a higher overall accuracy than clinical evaluation. Increases in accuracies of 28%, 19%, 15%, and 7% occurred for mitral stenosis, aortic stenosis, aortic regurgitation, and mitral regurgitation, respectively, resulting in overall accuracies of 97%, 100%, 95%, and 96%. Clinical evaluation alone made 28 errors (37% of patients and 19% of valve lesions assessed), and 17 of these errors (23% of patients and 12% of valve lesions) would have resulted in inappropriate management. In only four (24%) of these 17 patients, the attending cardiologist would not have proceeded to assess the valve at cardiac catheterization.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Previous determinations of spontaneous variability in ventricular arrhythmia have often been based on measurements from consecutive days in small patient populations, whereas clinical determinations of drug efficacy typically compare measurements at intervals of 1 week and longer to baseline. We, therefore, sought to determine whether spontaneous arrhythmia variability changes as a function of time during periods ranging from 1 day to 1 year or longer. The percent reduction in the frequency of total premature ventricular complexes (PVCs) and repetitive ventricular beats required to show true drug effect rather than spontaneous variability in PVCs was determined in 47 consecutive patients with chronic ventricular arrhythmias who underwent multiple ambulatory monitor recordings while off active drug treatment (during placebo therapy). The variability in PVC rate was determined during the intervals of 1 day, 1 week, 2 weeks, 3 weeks, 4 weeks, and 1 year or longer. The percent reductions in total PVCs required to exceed the 95% confidence limits of spontaneous variability at these intervals were 55%, 85%, 86%, 93%, 96%, and 96%, respectively. Corresponding values for repetitive beats were 75%, 95%, 92%, 95%, 94%, and 98%, respectively. The percent increase in total PVCs and repetitive beats required to establish \"arrhythmia aggravation\" caused by an antiarrhythmic drug with a 95% confidence limit also was calculated for this study population and was 124% and 303%, respectively, at 1-day intervals and 2,269% and 4,091%, respectively, at 1-year (or longer) intervals for the 24-hour monitor recordings. Variability was not substantially affected by underlying heart disease or ejection fraction. PVC rate showed a modest negative correlation with variability (r = 0.3). Thus, variability is substantially greater at 1 week, the usual time for clinical assessment of antiarrhythmic drug efficacy, than at 1 day (p less than 0.01). Suppression of more than 85% of total PVCs and more than 95% of repetitive beats appears to be necessary after 1-2 weeks to be confident of a true drug effect. Even greater variability is observed after 1 month and up to 1 year so that reductions of up to 95% in total PVCs and 98% in repetitive beats may represent spontaneous change.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Calculations of the spontaneous variability of ventricular arrhythmias are usually based upon the results of Holter electrocardiograms recorded either successively or separated by a short time interval. Only recently was it shown that the variability of ventricular premature contractions increases with longer intervals. This study was undertaken to investigate the variability of simple and complex ventricular arrhythmias over long periods to derive efficacy criteria for long-term antiarrhythmic therapy. In a prospective study, the influence of the length of the time interval on spontaneous variability was investigated in 100 patients with coronary artery disease or idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy and untreated ventricular arrhythmia Lown grade IV. Patient follow-up was carried out for 260 +/- 387 days. In each of the 498 ambulatory Holter tapes, the mean hourly arrhythmia count (AC) of ventricular premature contractions, couplets, and salvos was verified. The variability of arrhythmia counts between two Holter electrocardiograms was defined as the logarithm of the ratio of (ACday 2 + 0.01) to (ACday 1 + 0.01). The 95% intervals for these ratios were calculated as +/- 2 SD, considering the fact that all mean values did not differ significantly from zero. The lower limit of these intervals refers to the reduction that is required for assuming drug efficacy, whereas the upper limit refers to an aggravation. The 95% intervals were calculated for each of four ranges of control intervals (0-6, 7-89, 90-364, and greater than or equal to 365 days). They increased significantly with longer control intervals.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Death certificate data were used in combination with population estimates based on the censuses of 1960, 1970, and 1980. Age-adjusted mortality rates for ischemic heart disease among Hispanics, American Indians, and non-Hispanic white men were consistent with nationwide patterns of rising mortality rates during the 1960s followed by declining rates. Mortality rates from ischemic heart disease in all three ethnic groups in New Mexico were lower than national rates for whites. Rates for Hispanics in New Mexico were lower than for non-Hispanic whites; rates for American Indians were the lowest among the three groups. These data support previous observations that Hispanics and American Indians in the Southwest are at decreased risk for mortality from ischemic heart disease in comparison with U.S. whites.\r"

  ".W": "Stimulation of left ventricular stretch receptors has been proposed as a possible mechanism for the occurrence of cardiac pain. Changes in left ventricular volume were continuously assessed in 12 patients during 11 spontaneous (two painful) and 12 ergometrine-induced (nine painful) ischemic attacks with a precordial scintillation probe and blood pool labeling with technetium-99m. In all ischemic episodes, spontaneous or induced, painful or painless, severe dilatation of the left ventricle was consistently observed. These changes always preceded the onset of ST segment shifts and occurred long before pain, when present. The maximum increase in end-diastolic volume was slightly greater in painful than in painless episodes, 38 +/- 8.0% versus 28 +/- 12.4%, but no significant difference was observed in the rate of volume change or in the maximum increase of end-systolic volume (133 +/- 50% and 110 +/- 27.3%), stroke volume (-28 +/- 15% and -25 +/- 12.4%), or ejection fraction (-32 +/- 8.7% and -26 +/- 6.0%). Although the maximum end-diastolic volume achieved is greater in painful episodes, this effect cannot be separated from that of duration, and, furthermore, there was no significant difference in end-diastolic volume at the moment chest pain began. Thus, in patients with angina at rest, transient asymptomatic ST segment shifts are consistently associated with large changes in left ventricular volume, similar to those observed during painful episodes. The rate and extent of acute left ventricular dilatation do not appear to be factors directly causing anginal pain.\r"

  ".W": "Previous studies with 31P nuclear magnetic resonance have demonstrated that patients with chronic congestive heart failure often exhibit increased glycolytic metabolism and impaired oxidative phosphorylation in exercising skeletal muscle, but the mechanism for these changes remains unresolved. This study was conducted to determine whether these abnormalities result from impaired blood flow or oxygen delivery. Nine patients with mild-to-moderate congestive heart failure and nine age- and size-matched, healthy control volunteers were studied during repetitive submaximal finger flexion exercise under aerobic and ischemic conditions. Skeletal muscle metabolism was assessed by 31P nuclear magnetic resonance of the flexor digitorum superficialis muscle. During steady-state aerobic exercise at 33% of each subject's predetermined maximum workload, the patients with congestive heart failure exhibited significantly lower pH values (6.65 +/- 0.22 vs. 6.97 +/- 0.09, p less than 0.002) and phosphocreatine concentrations, expressed as [phosphocreatine]/([phosphocreatine] + [inorganic phosphate]) (0.59 +/- 0.14 vs. 0.79 +/- 0.08, p less than 0.002). Similar differences were also present throughout ischemic exercise at the same workload. Based upon these measurements, calculated lactate production and adenosine 5'-triphosphate consumption rates were significantly higher in the patients with congestive heart failure. These results indicate that in many patients with congestive heart failure exercising muscle exhibits increased glycolytic metabolism and appears to be metabolically less efficient in relation to external work performed. These changes cannot be explained by impaired blood flow or oxygen delivery alone.\r"

  ".W": "Echocardiographic findings in cardiac echinococcosis have been previously described in isolated cases, but no detailed account of the various echocardiographic aspects and their clinical and surgical implications have ever been reported. We present a retrospective analysis of the two-dimensional echocardiograms of 15 patients with hydatid cysts affecting the heart or great blood vessels. Two-dimensional echocardiogram features were compared with the main clinical syndromes. Surgical confirmation of the echocardiogram findings was available in 12 patients. The cyst sizes ranged from 0.5 to 12 cm in diameter. Eleven patients had single cysts, three patients had two cysts, and one patient had multiple cysts. Cysts were located in the intramyocardial region in nine patients, the pericardial in three, and the paracardial in another three. All intramyocardial cysts protruded into the adjacent cardiac chamber, but in only two patients was there significant tricuspid valvular dysfunction. Pericardial and mediastinal cysts showed compression of cardiac chambers or great blood vessels, and two cysts had ruptured into the descendent thoracic aorta or inferior vena cava. In most patients, two-dimensional echocardiographic images of hydatid cysts were those of a cystic mass having well-defined edges and internal trabeculations corresponding to daughter membranes. However, in four patients, two-dimensional echocardiographic images showed a \"solid\" mass instead of a cystic mass, and in one patient with the multivesicular variety of echinococcosis, the images showed a large mass with poorly defined edges having a honeycombed appearance causing lysis of the anterior arch of the second and third left ribs. The two-dimensional echocardiographic finding showed good correlation with main clinical syndromes, but anaphylactic reactions occurred in every cyst location. In one patient, postoperative two-dimensional echocardiography showed two small intramyocardial cysts that had not been noticed during preoperative two-dimensional echocardiography or during surgical examination. Pathological examination in the four patients with a solid mass showed replacement of the hydatid liquid by necrotic matter containing membrane residues with a foreign-body inflammatory reaction of a granulomatous type. In conclusion, two-dimensional echocardiography is a very useful tool for diagnosis and management of patients with cardiac echinococcosis, but the great diversity of findings regarding number, size, location, and appearance of cysts must be borne in mind to interpret correctly the two-dimensional echocardiograms.\r"

Microscopy and microspectrophotometry demonstrated that plaque from beta carotene-treated patients had higher carotenoid levels and higher absorption (450-500 nm) compared with control specimens, but normal media was unaffected. This demonstration of increased preferential absorption by plaque suggests that selective ablation of atherosclerotic plaque may be enhanced by pretreating patients with oral beta carotene.\r"

Patients' age (9 +/- 9 years; range, 1 day-39 years) and a history of surgical valvotomy did not influence outcome. The number of dilating balloons (one vs. two) and balloon: annulus ratio based on the largest balloon used in each case (97 +/- 12%; range, 71-133%) did not demonstrably influence the percent reduction in valvar gradient. In contrast, with a balloon: annulus ratio greater than 100%, the incidence (26%) of significant, dilation-induced aortic regurgitation was higher than occurred when the ratio was equal to or less than 100% (11%). Fifty bicommissural and eight unicommissural valves were identified echocardiographically. Relief of obstruction was associated with apparent commissural division in 24 of 32 patients with suitable postdilation studies. The sites of fusion and stenosis relief did not influence percent reduction in valvar gradient. Substantial increases in aortic regurgitation (greater than three of five grades) occurred in three of eight unicommissural and one of 50 bicommissural valves. The presence of a thick valve was associated with a slightly lower gradient reduction (53 +/- 12%) than thin and pliant valves (63 +/- 24%) (p greater than 0.05). Unlike all other congenital lesions we have studied, dilation technique and balloon size appeared to have a lesser influence on percent reduction in valvar gradient in congenital aortic stenosis, although balloon: annulus ratio influences the increase in aortic regurgitation. Valve morphology appears to assist with predicting the outcome of dilation.\r"

Patients' ages ranged from 8 months to 82 years (6.0-70 kg); diagnoses included postinfarction VSD (n = 4), congenital VSD (n = 1), and postoperative congenital VSD (n = 2). Indications for VSD closure were shock or respiratory failure (n = 5) or multiple episodes of endocarditis (n = 1). Closure was attempted with a Rashkind double umbrella: VSDs were crossed via the left ventricle and a guide wire was advanced to the right heart, snared with a venous catheter, and used to direct a long sheath (and ultimately the double umbrella) across the VSD. We crossed the VSD in all seven attempts, and a 17-mm double umbrella was successfully placed in each VSD. In the first (postinfarction) patient with the largest (12 mm) VSD, the umbrella embolized after 20 seconds to the pulmonary artery (without reducing flow). The other six umbrellas remained in position, either diminishing or abolishing the left-to-right shunts. Postinfarction patients had increasing VSD shunting over the next several days and died; at postmortem, the umbrellas remained well positioned in the septum, with other VSDs present. All three congenital VSDs had absent or diminished shunts after umbrella closure. These preliminary data indicate that transcatheter VSD closure is feasible in selected cases.\r"

Plastic, embedded, longitudinal and cross sections of septum (1 micron thick) were prepared for morphometric measurements. In untreated rats, infarction was followed by myocardial hypertrophy, as shown by significant increases in septal area (23%), myocyte length (19%), cross-sectional area (20%), and volume (43%) (p less than or equal to 0.05). In rats with and without infarction, beta-blockade resulted in decreased myocyte dimensions and increased left ventricular cavity dimensions. Propranolol had special effects in rats with infarction, resulting in significant blunting of increased cross-sectional area (15% less, p = 0.04) and a greater increase in left ventricular cavity dimensions (38% more, p = 0.04). Thus, propranolol blunts myocardial hypertrophy and increases left ventricular cavity dimensions in rats with myocardial infarction.\r"

To test the hypothesis that epinephrine improves the balance between myocardial oxygen supply and demand during cardiopulmonary resuscitation, myocardial adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP) and lactate concentrations were measured before and immediately after 10 minutes of cardiopulmonary resuscitation in 10 control dogs and 10 dogs given intravenous epinephrine (1-mg bolus followed by 0.2 mg/min). Left ventricular myocardial blood flow during cardiopulmonary resuscitation was measured with radioactive microspheres and was significantly higher in the epinephrine group (48 +/- 11 vs. 21 +/- 4 ml/min/100 g, p less than 0.05). However, myocardial lactate concentration increased significantly (p less than 0.01) after cardiopulmonary resuscitation in both groups and tended to increase more in epinephrine-treated animals. Myocardial ATP concentration decreased significantly (p less than 0.05) and by comparable amounts in the two groups. These findings suggest that large doses of epinephrine may fail to improve the balance between myocardial oxygen supply and demand during cardiopulmonary resuscitation, even when they result in a substantial increase in coronary blood flow.\r"

The mechanisms that allow augmented diastolic filling are not fully defined. Accordingly, the left ventricle of five dogs was instrumented with a micromanometer and sonomicrometers and studied during the conscious state before (control) and after the creation of significant mitral regurgitation. Serial measurements were made at control and up to 4 weeks after the creation of the volume overload. Heart rate, peak systolic wall stress, and peak positive dP/dt showed no significant changes between control and subsequent observations. End-diastolic volume and total stroke volume progressively and significantly increased during the 4-week course. When compared with the control state (51 +/- 4, mean +/- SD), the filling fraction during the first 40% of diastolic time was increased at 4 days (67 +/- 10%, p less than 0.001), 2 weeks (72 +/- 6%, p less than 0.001), and 4 weeks (76 +/- 10%, p less than 0.001).

Compared with the control state (0.81 +/- 0.04), eccentricity of the left ventricle at end systole decreased at 4 weeks (0.79 +/- 0.06, p less than 0.05); the absolute change in this ratio during the first 40% of diastolic time was significantly augmented at 2 weeks (0.09 +/- 0.02, p less than 0.05) and 4 weeks (0.11 +/- 0.04, p less than 0.005) compared with control (0.05 +/- 0.02). Ventricular elastance (pressure/volume) at end systole (minimum volume) was 1.70 +/- 0.50 mm Hg/ml at control, 1.09 +/- 0.46 at 4 days (p less than 0.05), 0.96 +/- 0.42 at 2 weeks (p less than 0.01), and 0.99 +/- 0.22 at 4 weeks (p less than 0.01). Moreover, the elastance change during the rapid-filling phase was significantly diminished after creation of mitral regurgitation. Thus, during the volume overload of mitral regurgitation, the left ventricle accommodates a higher percentage of its total stroke volume during early diastole; this adaptation can be correlated with augmented systolic shortening, and thereby with increased restorative forces or elastic recoil, and with reduced chamber elastance and eccentricity during the early part of diastole. Other potential mechanisms include altered systolic and relaxation loading, augmented elastic recoil of the left atrium, left atrium and left ventricular pressure gradient, accelerated myocardial inactivation, and increased adrenergic stimulation.\r"
