  ".W": "The pain drawings of 54 low-back-pain patients were examined to find out if it is possible to use them as a brief screening test in order to assess the psychological impairment of the patients. We were using the scoring system of Ransford et al, which we slightly changed, and chose as a criterion variable the ERMSS (Erweiterte Revidierte Mehrdimensionale Schmerzskala) of Cziske. This test originates in the McGill Pain Questionnaire of Melzack and Torgerson; its scales describe four dimensions of pain perception: pain intensity, the sensory-discriminative dimension reflecting the somatic aspect of pain; the affective-motivational dimension, and the total number of words, both representing the psychological involvement of a pain patient. A correlation was found between pain drawing score and the sensory-discriminative dimension of pain perception, whereas there was no such correlation between drawing score and the affective dimension. These results indicate that the pain drawing score might not be a sufficiently valid instrument for assessing psychological disturbances in pain patients to allow it to be used for individual diagnosis without hesitation.\r"

Also, Watkins removed a flake of the iliac crest with muscles attached, which he swung cranially and medially. This article also describes several refinements not mentioned in the original article and gives several new uses for the approach. Specifically, its use for removing a far lateral disc, decompressing a far out syndrome, inserting pedicle screws, and for decompressing the opposite side from inside the vertebral canal is described.\r"

As expected, at 2 weeks, all injected discs exhibited marked loss of height (mean: 50% of original height) indicative of severe proteoglycan depletion. The appearance of keratan sulfate-bearing fragments in plasma was monitored by an ELISA-inhibition assay which uses a monoclonal antibody (1/20/5-D-4) specific for an epitope present only in the longest keratan sulfate chains. Levels of plasma keratan sulfate rose within 30 minutes and reached a maximum between 24 and 72 hours later. Levels then declined progressively but were still elevated at 2 weeks postinjection. Keratan sulfate-bearing fragments in plasma were purified by ion exchange chromatography on DEAE-Sephacryl and fractionated by sieve chromatography on Sepharose CL-6B. These plasma keratan sulfate-bearing fragments were found to be similar in size to keratan sulfate-bearing fragments generated by chymopapain digestion of dog nucleus pulposus proteoglycans, but slightly larger than single keratan sulfate chains obtained by alkaline borohydride treatment of dog nucleus pulposus proteoglycans. The results of this study show that measurements of blood levels of keratan sulfate could prove useful in monitoring effective degradation of disc proteoglycans in chemonucleolysis in man and help discriminate between ineffective enzyme placement, and alternative mechanisms of treatment failure.\r"

Thirty of the procedures were near the pancreas. Pancreatitis was detected within seven days of the operation in 26 of the patients. Sixteen patients had complications related to the pancreas, 12 had other nonlethal complications and nine died. Fourteen patients had severe pancreatitis (greater than or equal to 3 Ranson's criteria) and were more likely to have a complicated course (p less than 0.05). Complications related to the pancreas included pancreatic pseudocyst (n = 9), abscess (n = 4), fistula (n = 2) and arterial hemorrhage (n = 1). Age, operation performed, serum amylase level and frequency of hypotension, renal failure and other complications were similar in patients with and without complications related to the pancreas. A high index of suspicion must remain throughout the postoperative period to recognize inflammation of the pancreas and its complications so that prompt diagnosis and management can be undertaken.\r"

  ".W": "Eighty-eight consecutive patients with invasive, but potentially curable, carcinoma of the abdominal colon were operated upon between January 1970 through June 1974 at the University of Chicago Medical Center by a small group of senior surgeons, all of whom utilized extensive lymphadenectomy. Pathologic stage of the disease, lymph node involvement, contiguous organ involvement and degree of differentiation of the primary tumor affected survival rates. Five and ten year absolute survival rates were 71.2 and 50.0 per cent, and the relative survival rates were 78.1 and 60.9 per cent. By five years, 30.0 per cent of the patients had recurrence, and by ten years, 33.3 per cent had recurrence. The majority of recurrences occurred within three years of operation. Only 12 per cent of the recurrences were local or regional. We conclude that operation using wide anatomic resection and extended lymphadenectomy improves survival rates and limits local and regional recurrences in patients with carcinoma of the abdominal colon. Furthermore, surveillance of patients after operation for invasive carcinoma of the abdominal colon should be aggressive for at least the first three years because of the frequency of recurrence within this period.\r"

Different investigators have used quite different criteria to define patients at high risk. This study was done to evaluate these different approaches to selecting patients who should be monitored with electrocardiograms (ECG) or enzymes, or both, postoperatively, as well as different strategies for the timing of follow-up evaluation. A total of 232 patients, mostly hypertensive or diabetic, were evaluated before undergoing elective operations and were observed serially from the day of the operation until discharge or the sixth postoperative day with daily clinical evaluations, ECG and creatine kinase isoenzymes. Several follow-up strategies used in recent studies were evaluated for sensitivity and specificity in identifying the patient who had postoperative infarctions or ischemia. The most sensitive strategies would obtain ECG in asymptomatic patients on the day of the operation and the first two postoperative days. Several criteria for defining a high risk population were evaluated, including type of operation, age, history of cardiac disease, Goldman's cardiac risk classification and the results of the preoperative ECG. Monitoring of patients with an abnormal preoperative ECG would have identified 88 per cent of the patients with postoperative myocardial infarction and 63 per cent of the patients with definite ischemia. Goldman's risk class identified patients with a normal ECG who were at higher risk for postoperative ischemia.\r"

  ".W": "The problem of hypergastrinemia in patients with the syndrome of multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN type 1) has become increasingly controversial since the introduction of the antisecretory H2 antagonists for the treatment of the Zollinger-Ellison syndrome (ZES). One of the questions in the management of ZES is whether the malignant potential of the gastrinomas or the recurrent complications of ulcer will be the ultimate cause of death. Another problem is whether the association of MEN is a favorable or unfavorable factor to the prognosis of patients with ZES. Hypercalcemia contributes to excessive gastrin secretion, thereby casting doubt on the diagnosis of ZES in the presence of MEN. Patients with MEN are also more likely than patients with ZES not to have gastrinoma on an exploratory laparotomy. The existing controversy concerns the choices of therapy in instances of progressive ZES associated with MEN or when there is a failure to detect a primary gastrinoma when exploration is performed. To highlight the debate, the clinical courses of two patients, observed during two and three decades, respectively, are presented. These patients were receiving high doses of cimetidine; in addition, conventional surgical treatment for ulcer and repeated biopsies for gastrinoma were performed. After total gastrectomies (as life saving procedures), both patients are well.\r"

Many implications can be derived from these figures.\r"

Patients were required to have (a) tumors confined primarily to the brainstem; (b) positive findings in two of three groups of neurologic signs (cranial nerve deficits and long-tract and cerebellar signs), and (c) symptom duration of less than 6 months. The 18-month survival of only 1 of 33 evaluable patients suggests that these criteria did in fact select tumors of poor prognosis. Such noninvasive predictors provide a valuable means of selecting for experimental treatment those children who would not be expected to benefit from standard therapies for malignant brainstem tumors. These criteria do not require routine biopsy for prognostic purposes, and avoid exposing the children to unnecessary risk.\r"

There was a low incidence of seizures (2%) in the nonshunted patients in spite of a high incidence of ventriculomegaly, whereas the overall frequency of seizures in shunted patients was 22%. Further analysis indicated factors accountable for the increase. Only 9% of patients with shunts that had never required subsequent modification had seizures; however, 22% of the patients had seizures if they had required at least one modification for malfunction alone. Patients with a history of a shunt infection had a further increase in their likelihood of developing seizures to 47%. Information concerning the incidence of seizures by location of the shunt indicated no statistical difference between frontal and parietal entry points, with a frequency of 20% and 26%, respectively; however, there was a higher incidence of seizures in a small group of patients with shunts aberrantly placed in the posterior frontal lobe.\r"

Releasing the watery cyst contents resulted in disappearance of such clinical manifestations. Immunohistochemically, the epithelial cytoplasm of the cyst was strongly positive for glial fibrillary acidic protein. Electron-microscopically, the cells that lined the cysts had microvilli which were coated with finely granular material to represent \"fuzzy\" coat, intercellular junctions linking the plasma membranes of adjacent cells, and numerous cytoplasmic glial filaments. The strong positivity for glial fibrillary acidic protein, then, is well correlated with an abundance of the latter. Cilia were also identified. Thus, the cysts were unequivocally neuroepithelial (ependymal) cysts. Only nine cases of neuroepithelial cysts in the posterior cranial fossa, including the current one, have been reported. Three patients were children; six were adults. The age of the patients ranged from 7 months to 60 years. The average age was 21.7 years The sex was known in eight patients with a male to female ratio of 3:5. The pathogenesis of these neuroepithelial cysts was proposed as related to developmental anomalies.\r"

Nonoperative extraction via the T tube tract or endoscopic sphincterotomy is successful in 85% to 95% of patients; however, the remainder require reoperation. This study evaluates the efficacy of electrohydraulic shock wave lithotripsy therapy of common duct stones too large to be extracted endoscopically or by T tube. Six patients were entered into the study. Ages ranged from 62 to 93 years. All patients either had severe preexisting systemic disorders or were of an advanced age. Stones ranged in size from 10 to 41 mm, with a mean largest dimension of 22 mm. In all patients either extraction by traditional nonoperative means failed or there was a stone that was considered to be too large to be extracted successfully. Patients were treated with 1200 to 2400 shocks at 16 to 20 kV. Five of six patients were treated with local anesthesia and sedation. Stones were successfully fragmented in all but one patient. Five patients required extraction of the remaining fragments either through the T tube tract (one patient) or via endoscopic sphincterotomy. All patients were free of stones at discharge, with the exception of one patient with severe cirrhosis who had an intrahepatic stone behind a right hepatic duct stricture. This stone had been successfully fragmented but an endoscopic retrograde cholangio-pancreatogram revealed some residual fragments despite normal alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin values. There were no hospital deaths, although the patient with the intrahepatic stone died of bleeding varices several months later. Electrohydraulic shock wave lithotripsy seems to be an effective adjuvant treatment in clearing the bile duct of stones that would otherwise require reoperation.\r"

To delineate more clearly the influence of the timing of surgery in the treatment of the disease, a prospective randomized clinical study of early surgery (less than 48 hours after admission) and delayed surgery (more than 48 hours after admission) was conducted in 165 patients. Ranson's prognostic signs of severity of disease were used to classify the patients into two risk groups: mild pancreatitis (three or fewer positive signs) and severe pancreatitis (more than three positive signs). In patients with three or fewer positive Ranson's signs, the time of surgery appeared to have little effect on the outcome, whereas in patients with more than three positive signs, early surgery resulted in a significant increase in rates of morbidity and mortality. Controlled randomization showed that in patients with gallstone pancreatitis, edematous or hemorrhagic necrotizing pancreatitis can develop, with or without impacted stones, early or late in the progression of the disease, during early or delayed surgery. These findings suggest that (1) although a gallstone initiates a bout of pancreatitis, it does not cause the progression of the disease; (2) the fate of the progression of pancreatitis is decided early by the amount of digestive enzymes being activated; (3) early removal of an impacted stone does not ameliorate the progression of pancreatitis; and (4) surgery should be performed during the initial hospital admission after the pancreatitis has subsided.\r"

The use of direct (e.g., 5-year) survival analysis, has led to the concept that these stages reflect a \"delay\" in diagnosis. Controlled clinical trials and demographic cancer registries, in which life table analysis of survival is used, provide data that require that this concept be reconsidered and perhaps discarded. Survival data published by NSABP B04 and the Connecticut Tumor Registry show that deaths in both stages start shortly after diagnosis but show different annual rates of dying. The anticipated \"delay\" (lead time bias) is not seen. These rates are permanently and consistently different. The local recurrence rates occurring in the two stages are different. The clinical response to tamoxifen citrate in postmenopausal women and chemotherapy in premenopausal women has been shown to be different between the two stages. Histopathologic examination of the primary tumor shows the two stages to be different with respect to size of tumor at time of diagnosis and the presence of lymphatic and vascular invasion. The conclusion must be reached that the two stages represent variants of breast cancer disease; stage II is not simply a late diagnosis of stage I.\r"

Urinalyses (U/As) were abnormal in 83 patients (39%); CBCs were abnormal in 19 patients (9%), and ECGs were abnormal in 140 patients (66%). The mean age of the patients was 64 plus or minus 12 years. The majority of patients with abnormalities determined by laboratory tests could have been predicted to have abnormalities on the basis of their histories and physical examinations. In this study, abnormalities indicated by laboratory tests did not influence preoperative cancellations, intraoperative or postoperative complications, or admissions to the hospital from the ambulatory unit after the surgical procedures. We conclude that routine preoperative screening laboratory tests have only a limited value in ambulatory surgical patients and recommend that they be either eliminated or replaced with less costly studies; for example, dipstick urinalyses for urinalyses, spun hematocrits for CBCs, and ECGs should be performed only if indicated by history and physical examination findings or if requested by an anesthesiologist.\r"

Mortality was not influenced by such risk factors as diabetes mellitus, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, renal failure, quantity of blood loss, duration of procedure, or total number of hospital days. However, patients with heart disease had a significantly higher mortality rate (78%). Overall, 39% of the patients experienced a subjective deterioration in their mental status after surgery. Of those patients who were ambulatory before surgery, 73% were ambulatory after surgery. Although this study indicates that the perioperative mortality is high and mental status changes frequent in this very elderly age group, the quality of life and longevity of the majority of these patients are good, and vigorous surgical intervention appears warranted.\r"

Other causes of infection included ischemic gangrene, trauma, and web space fissures. Advanced ischemia was infrequent; only 21 (32.3%) had ankle-brachial indices (ABI) less than 0.5. Eight (23.5%) deaths and 12 (35.3%) stump failures followed 34 amputations where the stump was closed, compared with no deaths and 4 (12.9%) stump failures when open amputations were done (p less than 0.02). Partial foot amputations with aggressive local debridement resulted in healing in 10 (71.4%) of 14 cases with revision or grafting. Guillotine transmalleolar amputation is advised when foot salvage is not possible, because only 1 (5.9%) of 17 such procedures could not be revised to the below-knee (B-K) level, whereas 8 (33.3%) of 24 definitive, closed B-K amputations were unsuccessful (p less than 0.02). Infections were polymicrobial, with 5.8 bacterial isolates and 2.3 anaerobes recovered per patient. Anaerobic antibiotic coverage, however, failed to alter outcome. Sepsis, often without advanced ischemia, is an important cause of limb loss in patients with diabetes. Open amputations are recommended, with foot salvage possible in many cases.\r"

Below-knee amputation was elected in 158 patients and infrainguinal revascularization in 204 patients. Patients were excluded from the study if amputation was chosen on the basis of arteriographic findings, diffuse infection, or extensive tissue loss. In an effort to compare the two treatment modalities in a minimally biased fashion, patients were stratified into three classes on the basis of the Goldman Multifactorial Index of Cardiac Risk and the American Society of Anesthesiology classification. Within each class, patients treated with amputation and with bypass were comparable with respect to age, sex, severity of ischemia, and anesthetic technique. Patients who underwent revascularization had a lower perioperative mortality rate (p less than 0.05), a shorter length of hospital stay (p less than 0.05), and an increased long-term survival rate (p less than 0.05) than the medically matched subgroup of patients who underwent amputation. Patients in the revascularization group were more successful in regaining ambulatory abilities than patients in the amputation group (p less than 0.01). These differences were most significant as the degree of medical compromise increased. Although medically compromised patients have frequently been denied revascularization on the basis of presumed increases in surgical risk and decreased long-term survival, the data appear to suggest that it is precisely the patients of this group who appear to benefit the most from attempts at limb salvage.\r"

Preoperative angiography is useful in stable patients to rule out associated vascular injuries, and it is crucial for operative planning in cases of blunt trauma. Not unexpectedly, the results of carotid artery repair in neurologically stable patients have been excellent, as have been the results of revascularization in patients with equivocal or less-severe neurologic deficits. This has led us to be aggressive in repair of carotid artery injuries in patients with questionable neurologic deficits. In the eight patients with severe preoperative deficits, one death each followed both ligation and repair, but neurologic improvement was noted in several patients. Distal internal carotid injuries at the base of the skull that were not amenable to direct repair were observed with serial angiograms in four patients with either stabilization or improvement in the intimal injury.\r"

This series is divided into 326 primary procedures and 173 secondary procedures. Of the primary procedures, there were 160 autogenous fistulas and 166 expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) fistulas. The 156 secondary procedures consisted of 124 thrombectomies, 20 repairs of pseudoaneurysm, 12 fistula ligations, and 17 fistula excisions. The infectious complication rate (29/482) was 6%. Mean length of patency was 3.1 years for autogenous wrist fistula, 2.6 years for elbow fistula, 1.9 years for forearm loop PTFE, 2.1 years for straight forearm PTFE, 1.6 years for femoral popliteal PTFE, and 1.4 years for femoral arteriovenous loop PTFE. A vascular steal syndrome occurred in 8% of patients with autogenous elbow fistulas (4/48), compared with 1.7% (2/112) of patients with wrist fistulas and 1.8% (3/166) of those with PTFE fistulas. All infected fistulas required excision, and all fistulas associated with the steal syndrome required ligation. Use of PTFE to construct permanent hemodialysis vascular access has a significantly higher incidence of thrombosis, infection, pseudoaneurysm formation, and limb loss (p less than 0.01 for all complications) and a significantly lower mean length of patency (p less than 0.0001) when compared with autogenous fistulas. Age, sex, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and the use of perioperative antibiotics were not found to be related significantly to access complications.\r"

  ".W": "Optimal protection from pulmonary thromboembolism (PE) by a mechanical device requires long-term freedom from complications as well as from recurrent PE. From 1974 to 1986 the Greenfield filter was implanted surgically in 469 patients, most commonly when anticoagulation was contraindicated (38%) or failed to prevent recurrent PE (27%). The jugular vein was used for access in 83% and the femoral vein in 16%; in the remainder the filter was inserted via the right atrium or the left axillary vein. Technical complications included air embolism in 4 patients (0.9%) and misplacement in 19 (4%), with no sequelae. There were 7 deaths from PE within 48 hours postoperatively, primarily in patients with pulmonary hypertension. An additional 9 later deaths were attributed to PE, 5 confirmed by autopsy, but in only 1 of these was there trapped thrombus in the filter. An additional 9 patients had nonfatal PE, suspected and confirmed in 2 by angiogram, for an overall recurrent PE rate of 4% over 12 years. During this follow-up there were 133 deaths, and 146 patients were followed up for an average of 43 months (190 were lost to follow-up). Ten patients had thrombosed inferior venae cavae at the time of insertion of the Greenfield filter, and 3 were recanalized late to a caval patency rate of 96%. Three initially patent filters occluded, for a long-term filter patency rate of 98%, which was independent of anticoagulation. Clinically silent embolism into the Greenfield filter was seen in 18 patients, half of whom had dissolution on subsequent cavogram. Venous stasis sequelae developed in 44% of the patients, compared with 52% with preoperative edema, and ulceration was seen in 3%. Of 32 patients who had suprarenal filters, 11 died and 12 returned for follow-up study, which showed that all were patent. Favorable results with suprarenal filter placement have made this an appropriate choice in pregnant women and in young women anticipating pregnancy.\r"

Twenty-eight patients (23%) were found to have HAPC, including 16 males and 12 females with a median age of 54 years. Barium esophograms yielded no evidence of motility disorders, while 35% of those tested had pathologic gastroesophageal acid reflux. Twenty (71%) were initially referred for evaluation of angina-like chest pain, and 8 were referred with other symptoms. Of those with chest pain, 19 initially underwent extensive evaluation for coronary artery disease before the diagnosis of HAPC. Symptoms of heartburn, regurgitation, and dysphagia were absent or minimal in most patients. Lower esophageal sphincter pressure was normal in 27 patients, and lower esophageal sphincter relaxation was normal in all patients. Mean distal esophageal peak peristaltic pressure was 147.8 mm Hg, while the highest peak peristaltic pressure for each patient averaged 193.2 mm Hg. Seven patients had mean peristaltic wave durations of more than 7 seconds. Patients with atypical chest pain or those with typical angina in whom coronary artery disease is eliminated as a possible cause should be evaluated for HAPC with esophageal manometry. Patients with symptoms are usually successfully treated with smooth muscle relaxants, and surgical intervention is rarely necessary.\r"

  ".W": "Chylothorax is an unusual complication after transhiatal esophagectomy (THE) and in the past 10 years has occurred in 11 of 320 patients (3%) undergoing this operation for diseases of the intrathoracic esophagus. Four patients had benign esophageal disease: scleroderma reflux esophagitis (1), caustic stricture (1), and achalasia (2), and each had undergone at least one previous esophageal operation. Seven patients had intrathoracic esophageal carcinoma--two upper-third, two middle-third, and three distal-third lesions. Excessive chest tube drainage more than 72 hours after THE was the standard presentation, and the diagnosis of chylothorax was confirmed by the administration of cream through the jejunostomy feeding tube placed routinely at operation. The character of the chest tube drainage changed from serous to opalescent. Aggressive treatment of this complication was the rule, and every patient underwent a thoracotomy between 2 to 14 days (average, 6 days) after the diagnosis was established. Cream was administered through the jejunostomy tube before operation, and in each case the thoracic duct injury was readily identified and controlled with suture ligatures. There were no deaths in this group, and there was one recurrence of the fistula that required reoperation; all patients were discharged from the hospital within 3 to 29 days (average, 10 days) after thoracic duct ligation. It is concluded that early recognition of a chylothorax after transhiatal esophagectomy with prompt transthoracic ligation of the injured duct results in a shorter overall hospitalization and lower morbidity and mortality from this complication. The traditional conservative management of chylothorax with intravenous hyperalimentation and no or low-residue enteral feedings has little place in this nutritionally depleted patient population.\r"

From January 1981 through May 1987, 66 adults were identified with blunt hepatic trauma that had been confirmed by abdominal exploration or abdominal computed tomography (CT): 46 underwent immediate operation, and 20 were initially managed nonoperatively. Patients were considered for nonoperative management only if they were hemodynamically stable and had no significant peritoneal irritation. CT criteria for nonoperative management included contained subcapsular or intrahepatic hematoma, unilobar fracture, absence of devitalized liver, minimal intraperitoneal blood, and absence of other significant intra-abdominal organ injuries. The predominant CT pattern in the 17 patients successfully managed nonoperatively included unilobar right-lobe fracture or intrahepatic hematoma. A small amount of blood in either gutter or in the pelvis did not portend failure of nonoperative management. No delayed complications were noted during an average follow-up of 27 months. Nonoperative management of blunt hepatic injury based on abdominal CT findings is a useful alternative in a select group of hemodynamically stable patients.\r"

Impressed with the theoretic advantages of PGV with drainage as a primary treatment for this problem, we have treated 37 suitable patients by this approach. All patients underwent endoscopic examination and barium meal study that proved the diagnosis. PGV, including division of the gastroepiploic nerves as indicated by intraoperative testing, was followed by Jaboulay gastroduodenostomy (18), Finney pyloroplasty (12), Heineke-Mikulicz pyloroplasty (3), anterior hemipylorectomy (2), duodenoplasty (1), and gastroenterostomy (1). No recurrent ulcers were seen during a mean follow-up of 4.6 years. Three patients had mild early dumping at infrequent intervals. Bilious vomiting, alkaline gastritis, and other postgastrectomy complaints were recorded infrequently. PGV with drainage is a good treatment for the obstructing ulcer and does not have as many morbid risks as alternative operative procedures.\r"

Seventeen patients were free of symptoms, 11 vomited occasionally (less than 5 times weekly), and 18 were severely incapacitated with daily vomiting, weight loss, and bezoar formation. Patients with occasional vomiting had early rapid emptying similar to that seen in the patients who were without symptoms and responded satisfactorily to nonsurgical therapy. The 18 patients with severe vomiting showed a marked delay in the emptying of the solid meal (p less than 0.01) but normal emptying of the liquid. There was no difference between those with and those without stomal ulceration or stomal stenosis. The stasis occurred in the stomach and not in the Roux limb. All 18 patients had a further extensive gastric resection, leaving a 50 to 75 ml upper gastric remnant drained by Roux-en-Y gastroenterostomy. Fifteen of these patients showed improvement and gained weight, and the gastric emptying of both the solid and liquid test meals is now faster than in any of the other groups (p less than 0.03). We conclude that extensive gastric resection is an effective means to reduce symptoms and improve gastric emptying in selected patients with severe gastric stasis of solid food after the Roux-en-Y procedure.\r"

Thirty-six instances of POI in children (aged 1 month to 18 years) were treated between 1970 and 1987. POI followed Nissen fundoplication in 9 patients, neuroblastoma resection in 5, small-bowel procedures in 4, inguinal herniorrhaphy in 3, pull-through procedures in 3, ureterostomy in 2, thoracic procedures in 2, ventral hernia in 1, nephrectomy in 1, hepatic resection in 1, Heller myotomy in 1, ventriculo-atrial shunt in 1, and gastrocystoplasty in 1. Initial symptoms included bilious vomiting or increased nasogastric drainage (after initial return of gut function) in 26 patients, abdominal distension in 24, irritability in 10, intermittent pain in 7, palpable abdominal mass in 2, rectal bleeding in 2, and lethargy in 1. The symptoms occurred 1 to 24 days (mean, 8 days) after the initial surgery. Plain abdominal radiographs revealed multiple air-fluid levels in 31 and an \"adynamic ileus\" in five patients. Barium contrast techniques could successfully reduce two ileocolic and one distal ileo-ileal lesions. The remainder necessitated operative management. Manual reduction was possible in 29 cases, and four children with diagnostic delay required bowel resection and an anastomosis for intestinal necrosis. The site of intussusception was ileo-ileal in 23 patients, jejunojejunal in 6, ileocolic in 5, and jejuno-ileal in 2. The diagnosis of POI should be considered in children with signs of bowel dysfunction in the early postoperative period. Contrast studies are of limited value, since most cases are confined to the small bowel. A high index of suspicion and prompt laparotomy will usually allow manual reduction of the lesion. Diagnostic delay may result in bowel necrosis.\r"

Thereafter, 6 control and 6 study rats were killed on days 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9, 14, and 21 for assessment of the temporal nature of adhesion formation. No peritoneal reaction or adhesions occurred from saline solution. Carrageenan induced a generalized peritonitis between days 2 and 7. The frequency of adhesions from day 5 onward was 66%. The effects of celiotomy and of systemic indomethacin on carrageenan-induced adhesion formation were then examined. Rats underwent a standardized celiotomy and, on closure of the abdomen, received either an intraperitoneal injection of saline solution (n = 72) or an intraperitoneal injection of carrageenan solution (n = 96). Both groups were then randomized to receive either no indomethacin (IND-0), a single preoperative dose of indomethacin (IND-1), or four perioperative doses of indomethacin (IND-4). Then, 2, 5, 14, and 21 days later, rats from each group were killed, the extent of intraperitoneal adhesions was assessed, and the nature of any adhesions was histologically examined. Celiotomy plus intraperitoneal saline solution produced no adhesions. Celiotomy plus intraperitoneal carrageenan solution (IND-0) significantly increased adhesions to 83%. Preoperatively and perioperatively administered indomethacin significantly decreased the adhesion formation rate to 49%.\r"

  ".W": "Partial ileal bypass (PIB) lowers the plasma total cholesterol (C) level, thereby increasing hepatic C synthesis to replenish bile acid and C stores. Lovastatin, a C synthesis inhibitor, may act as a potential adjuvant to PIB for lipid lowering. In this study, the effects of PIB and lovastatin, alone and in combination, were examined in plasma and tissue. For 14 weeks, 32 New Zealand White rabbits received a C-free, alfalfa-free, natural-ingredients diet previously shown to induce hypercholesterolemia. The rabbits were divided into control, lovastatin, PIB, and PIB plus lovastatin groups. Lovastatin was administered at a dose of 0.35 mg/kg twice daily. Compared with the control group, PIB alone decreased the plasma total C level by 75% (p less than 0.005), the low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-C level by 79% (p less than 0.025), and hepatic C content by 50% (p less than 0.05), while increasing hepatic C synthesis by 176% (p less than 0.05). Compared with the control group, lovastatin alone decreased the plasma total C value by 36% (p = NS), the LDL-C level by 35% (p = NS), hepatic C content by 29% (p = NS), and hepatic C synthesis by 52% (p = NS). Compared with the control group, the combination of PIB and lovastatin decreased the plasma total C level by 78% (p less than 0.005), the LDL-C level by 74% (p less than 0.025), and hepatic C content by 58% (p less than 0.05); however, the hepatic C synthesis increased by 490% (p less than 0.005) compared with the control group and by 110% (p less than 0.05) compared with PIB alone. This is the first demonstration of a metabolic reversal of the cholesterol synthesis inhibition engendered by lovastatin. We conclude that both PIB and lovastatin lower plasma total C and lipoprotein C fractions. Their combination has an additive C-lowering effect in plasma and decreases tissue C content by increasing cellular C demand. This latter effect overcomes the inhibitory effect of lovastatin on hepatic C synthesis, resulting in an augmented compensatory increase in hepatic C synthesis.\r"

  ".W": "Bronchial hyperresponsiveness to inhaled histamine in smokers is associated with an accelerated annual decline in FEV1 and low baseline FEV1 values. The evolution of bronchial hyperresponsiveness and whether it precedes or follows the accelerated decline in FEV1 and reduction in FEV1 is unknown. Measurements of the provocative concentration of inhaled histamine required to reduce FEV1 by 20% (PC20) were repeated after a four year interval in 27 male smokers (mean age 59 years, smoking on average 27 cigarettes a day in 1986) and 16 men who were ex-smokers in 1982 and who remained non-smokers until 1986 (mean age 53 years in 1986). These men were originally recruited to a prospective study in 1974 and had their first PC20 measurement in 1982. PC20 was positively related to baseline FEV1 in both smokers and ex-smokers in both 1982 and 1986 (r ranging from 0.56 to 0.76, p less than 0.01). In smokers mean FEV1 fell from 83% to 77% predicted (p less than 0.001) and geometric mean PC20 from 7.11 to 3.27 mg/ml (p less than 0.001) between 1982 and 1986. The change in PC20 in individual smokers over the four years was related to change in FEV1 (p = 0.012). In ex-smokers mean FEV1 was 93% predicted both in 1982 and in 1986 and there was no significant difference in geometric mean PC20 between 1982 (6.68 mg/ml) and 1986 (5.98 mg/ml). Thus in smokers there was an accelerated annual decline in FEV1 and an increase in bronchial hyperresponsiveness as FEV1 fell. The ex-smokers had comparable levels of bronchial hyperresponsiveness in 1982. Mean PC20 values were unchanged in 1986 in these men, who showed a normal age related decline in FEV1. These longitudinal results emphasise the importance of baseline airway geometry in influencing bronchial hyperresponsiveness to histamine in middle aged smokers and ex-smokers.\r"

Right ventricular ejection fraction was related to survival, but the relationship was weak (p = 0.03) by comparison with the association between the arterial oxygen and carbon dioxide tensions and survival (both p less than 0.0001).

  ".W": "The medical records of 118 patients (86 male, 32 female, age 10-50 (mean 27) years) who underwent pericardiectomy for constrictive pericarditis at the Christian Medical College Hospital, Vellore, from 1954 to 1985 were reviewed. All had appreciable pericardial constriction. Preoperatively 97 of the 118 were in class III or IV of the New York Heart Association classification and 100 had peripheral oedema or ascites. Tuberculosis was proved as the cause in 72 patients. Pericardiectomy was accomplished through a standard anterolateral thoracotomy (107 cases), median sternotomy (3 cases), or bilateral thoracotomy (8 cases). Postoperatively an apparent low cardiac output state was seen in 34 patients, 12 of whom died. Hospital mortality in the last 12 years was 11%. Mortality was higher in NYHA class III and IV patients. The improved surgical results recently may be related to increased use of inotropic support and prolonged ventilation. At follow up there were 72 patients in whom functional capacity could be assessed; 63 were in class I or II. The poor results of pericardiectomy in some patients are likely to be related to advanced preoperative disability and early pericardiectomy is therefore recommended.\r"

None of the 10 patients in group A had strictures and only two presented late. After drainage of the neck and mediastinum the outcome was successful in all patients. Thirteen of the 29 in group B were treated early and four of these died; nine of the 16 treated late died, the total mortality for thoracic perforation being 48%. An oesophageal stricture was present in 23 patients. Twelve of these underwent various forms of conservative surgery and there were 10 deaths. This contrasts with the 11 who received radical treatment with resection and reconstruction, only two of whom died. The six patients with no pre-existing stricture were treated with conservative forms of surgery, with one death.\r"

We analyzed the data with respect to cerebral artery occlusion patterns, posttreatment arterial recanalization, and the clinical categories of favorable/unfavorable outcome and survival/death. In subgroup analyses, recanalization in patients who received thrombolytic therapy correlated significantly with clinical outcome; in 19 of 43 patients, recanalization was demonstrated angiographically, while in 24 patients the occlusion persisted. All patients without recanalization died, but 14 of the 19 patients displaying recanalization survived (p = 0.000007), 10 with a favorable clinical outcome. Only three of the 22 patients who received conventional therapy survived, all with a moderate clinical deficit. When we compared the treatment groups, highly significant differences in both outcome quality (p = 0.017) and survival (p = 0.0005) were found to depend on establishing recanalization. Our data support the concept that technically successful thrombolysis of vertebrobasilar artery occlusions is associated with beneficial clinical outcome.\r"

All but one patient had a follow-up interview in early 1987; that patient had died of an unrelated cause (lung cancer) 18 months after the presenting TIA. The diagnosis was changed at the follow-up interview in three patients (multiple sclerosis, meningioma, migraine). Among the 64 remaining patients, at admission cranial computed tomography had shown cerebral infarction in 11 of 64, two-dimensional echocardiography had been abnormal in nine of 61, Holter monitoring had been abnormal in eight of 45, and twelve-lead electrocardiography had been abnormal in three of 64. Two patients had abnormalities on both echocardiography and Holter monitoring. At the follow-up interview of the 64 remaining patients, TIAs had recurred in nine and three had developed a completed stroke; cardiac disease (angina in seven, myocardial infarction in four) was noted in 11 patients. Findings from cardiac investigations on admission in the nine patients with recurrent TIAs had been abnormal in six and normal in three; all three patients who developed a stroke had had abnormal cardiac findings. Overall, further neurologic or cardiac events occurred in 12 of 46 patients (26%) with normal and in 10 of 18 patients (55.5%) with abnormal findings on admission (p less than 0.01). In the presence of normal angiograms, extensive cardiac investigations may help predict the outcome of patients with TIAs.\r"

Compared with controls, baseline [Cai2+] was higher in untreated patients (p less than 0.002), maximal 36-72 hours after the onset of neurologic dysfunction (p less than 0.0001), in those patients with as well as those without major stroke risk factors. The increase in [Cai2+] after stimulation with 0.5 and 1.0 unit/ml thrombin (p less than 0.05), 2 and 4 micrograms/ml collagen (p less than 0.02), and 0.5 and 1.0 mM platelet activating factor (p less than 0.05) were also greater in untreated patients, but the profiles of these changes were parallel to those in controls. Even though the platelets of stroke patients are more sensitive to activation, they are functionally similar to those of controls. Aspirin treatment reduced baseline [Cai2+] as well as thrombin- and collagen-induced [Cai2+] changes. Platelet activating factor-induced increase in [Cai2+] was not altered by aspirin treatment. Our results suggest that the usefulness of aspirin in stroke is limited because aspirin does not suppress platelet responsiveness to all in vivo thrombogenic stimuli. Specific platelet activating factor antagonists may prove to be useful therapeutic agents in stroke.\r"

No clinical features were significantly associated with a flow-limiting carotid stenosis of greater than 60%. Contrary to previous reports, the type of retinal artery occlusion, whether branch or central artery occlusion, was not predictive of severe underlying carotid stenosis or occlusion. Likely mechanisms of retinal artery occlusion include in situ thrombosis and emboli from carotid, and possibly cardiac, sources. Extension of thrombus from an occluded carotid artery into the ophthalmic artery did not appear to be a mechanism of retinal artery occlusion.\r"

The entry variables were clinical condition on admission (grades on the Glasgow Coma Scale, Hunt and Hess system), the amount of subarachnoid and intraventricular blood and the presence of hydrocephalus on the admission computed tomogram, and antifibrinolytic treatment with tranexamic acid. We used data from a prospectively studied population of 176 patients admitted within 72 hours after subarachnoid hemorrhage. The risk of delayed cerebral ischemia was best predicted by the amount of subarachnoid blood, intraventricular blood, and antifibrinolytic treatment irrespective of clinical condition and hydrocephalus. The site of delayed cerebral ischemia was not related to the location of the subarachnoid hemorrhage. Antifibrinolytic treatment was the only entry variable (negatively) predicting the risk of rebleeding. Death or severe disability after 3 months was best predicted by the amount of subarachnoid blood and the initial clinical condition reflected by the grade on the Glasgow Coma Scale.\r"

Measurements of available oxygen (aO2) in the ischemic core (the ventral part of the temporal area) followed by histologic examination verified the embolization. Electroencephalographic power spectra and steady (direct current) potentials were recorded bilaterally on the convexity remote from the actual lesion but still supplied by the MCA. Local cerebral blood flow and aO2 in the border zone between the anterior cerebral artery and the occluded MCA were measured. Embolization caused typical ischemic changes ipsilaterally and alterations characteristic of diaschisis contralaterally. Extreme border zone hyperemia developed without significant aO2 changes in the same region. Restoration of circulation via the circle of Willis induced gradual normalization. Our model for controlled embolization and recirculation proved suitable for detailed studies of the complex changes in brain function caused by transient ischemia.\r"

Forty-one cats were subjected to 1 hour of middle cerebral artery occlusion and were killed after 3 hours, 3 days, or 14 days of recirculation; one half of the cats received 0.916 ml/kg of a 25 mg/ml solution of aminophylline by infusion at a constant rate via the femoral vein starting 10 minutes before release of the occlusion and continuing for 5 minutes after initiation of recirculation; the other half received saline. Regional cerebral blood flow was monitored by the hydrogen clearance method and water content was evaluated by specific gravity measurements after 3 hours of recirculation; the status of the blood-brain barrier was assessed with Evans blue tracer. Morphologic observations were carried out in cats killed after 3 or 14 days of recirculation. Aminophylline-treated cats killed after 3 hours of recirculation showed significantly reduced hyperemia and edema and no leakage of Evans blue, which was present in all untreated cats killed after 3 hours or 3 days of recirculation. Morphologic observations revealed conspicuously more severe ischemic brain tissue damage in the untreated than in the aminophylline-treated cats after 3 and 14 days of recirculation. Our studies indicate the beneficial effect of administration of aminophylline in the amelioration of postischemic edema and brain tissue injury, which is presumably achieved by reduction of reactive hyperemia.\r"

  ".W": "The daily variation of serum levels of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and prostatic acid phosphatase (PAP) was investigated simultaneously in 10 patients with osseous metastatic prostatic cancer, 10 patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia, and 10 volunteers without prostatic disease. Duplicate serum samples were obtained from all patients on the same day at 8 AM, 12 PM, 4 PM, and 8 PM. Statistical analysis (two-factor analysis of variance comparing time period to disease group) of the mean PSA and PAP levels at the four sampling times on all patient groups demonstrated no evidence of circadian rhythmic variation or any other distinct pattern for the observed sample times. Overall, the variability in PSA levels was significantly less than that observed for PAP. There was no significant difference in mean percent variation between patient groups (cancer, benign, and normal prostate glands) for both the PSA and PAP assays. Our data reveal that serum PSA measurements fluctuate unpredictably over the course of a day in patients with and without prostatic disease, but to a lesser extent than that seen for serum PAP values. These findings illustrate the potential inaccuracy of single determinations of serum PAP or PSA levels for monitoring disease recurrence and treatment response in patients with prostate cancer.\r"

The subgroups were compared with each other and with a reference group of males apparently free of any prostatic disorder. In addition, clinical sensitivities, specificities, and predictive values were calculated to assess the diagnostic value of the different assays. The main results were: (1) Serum PAP concentration measured by immunologic methods best reflected the tumor mass, the presence or absence of metastases, the histologic grade, and the therapeutic efficiency (response) in the patients. (2) The differences in biochemically determined serum TP concentrations were less clear-cut. (3) The serum concentrations of the nonspecific phosphatases AcP and AP were highly elevated in patients with progressed PCA; AP was the highest in patients with palpable tumors and metastases. (4) The sensitivities of each phosphatase were too low for detection of early PCA stages. In conclusion, immunoassayable PAP appears to be the best parameter to monitor advanced PCA disease, and AP may be a useful auxiliary parameter in metastatic PCA.\r"

In fact, 5 of 12 patients (42%) who received radiation therapy prior to effective hormonal therapy suffered significant morbidity and mortality. The case is made for the use of ketoconazole for initial empirical therapy for these patients.\r"

Histologically, the tumor of the older brother consisted predominantly of embryonal carcinoma with minor components of seminoma and adult teratoma; the tumor of the younger brother consisted entirely of embryonal carcinoma. Since previous reports suggest the possibility that the HLA genotype may be a factor in the etiology of testicular cancer, we typed the parents and four children of this family. The two affected brothers shared a paternal HLA-A3, Cw-,B7,DR2 haplotype that had not been transmitted to the two other living siblings. Analysis of the distribution of HLA haplotypes of the affected non-twin brothers of this family and those of three other non-twin pairs of brothers that have been reported showed that the affected pairs in each family shared one HLA haplotype. The differences between the expected and the observed distribution of HLA haplotypes in the four sibling pairs is not statistically significant, perhaps because of the small number of patients typed. Two of the four pairs shared a common haplotype. Additional family studies are required to establish a genetic origin of testicular tumors and to determine whether or not a \"testicular carcinoma disease\" gene is linked to the HLA complex. A large number of multicase families will be required for linkage analysis.\r"

The EMG wave form measurements varied with the type of surface electrode used and placement of the electrode. Surface electrodes for external anal sphincter EMG resulting in optimum signal response require a small metallic recording surface with an adhesive that will secure the electrode to the skin, proper anatomic placement of the electrode, appropriate preparation of the skin surface at the site of application of the electrode, and capabilities for oscilloscope monitoring of the sphincter EMG signal wave form. If properly used, surface electrodes result in a signal amplitude and frequency that approach the quality of concentric needle electrodes.\r"

Normocapnic hyperventilation for three minutes at 40% maximal voluntary ventilation was carried out for each condition. A constant-volume body plethysmograph measured the functional residual capacity and specific airway conductance (SGaw), followed by two forced expiratory manuevers. Measurements were taken before and 1, 5, 10, and 20 minutes after each challenge. Air conditions with 100% relative humidity caused a fall in the SGaw that was maximal in 1 minute. Air conditions at 100% relative humidity caused a greater fall in both the forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) (P<.05) and the SGaw (P<.005) than did conditions of the same temperature but less water content. At 44 degrees C and 100% relative humidity, the mean percent change in FEV1 and SGaw was -2% and -40%, respectively, at 1 minute after challenge. Of the conditions examined, the optimal temperature was 44 degrees C, and we speculate that the optimal water content is less than 44 mg H2O per liter. Inhaled water concentrations exceeding 44 mg H2O per liter should probably not be used in patients with asthma.\r"

Of 394 respondents, about $51,000 per physician practice was written off as uncompensated care or services not billed for in 1985. An average of 7% of each physician's patients was estimated to be \"no-pay\" or charity patients, accounting for $19,000 of this total. Almost $32,000 was reported as being uncompensated care, or that which is billed but not paid. In addition to these amounts, an average of $32,000 was reported as being discounted from the usual fee levels by government insurance programs. Extrapolating these results to the physician membership of the local medical society indicates that physicians in San Francisco may be providing as much as $81 million in uncompensated or charity care annually. These results emphasize that private practitioners are providing a significant amount of medical care at reduced or charity rates, an amount that can be expected to increase given present trends. Substantial changes are needed if the burden of providing medical care to poor and uninsured Americans is not to fall disproportionately on private providers.\r"

No differences in delivery type, length of gestation, birth weight, or nursery care were found. An Apgar score of less than 7 at 1 minute or less than 8 at 5 minutes was 2.17 and 2.31 times more likely at RU and 2.48 and 2.60 times more likely at UU, respectively, than at RR. The overall Cesarean section rate was 9.6 percent, forceps rate was 7.2 percent, and nonroutine nursery care rate was 7.9 percent. Neonatal and perinatal mortality rates were 3.5 and 4.6 per 1,000 live births. There is no evidence that on-site perinatal subspecialists improve perinatal outcome when care is provided by board-certified family physicians. Small obstetric centers provide quality perinatal care with outcome dependent on physician's skill rather than on technology.\r"

  ".W": "In this study, the relation of white-collar work on the outcomes of low-risk pregnancies was investigated. The medical records of 300 primiparous women whose pregnancy outcomes were known were selected sequentially from prenatal care log books over a 6-month period in three private, group obstetric practices in a university community. The majority of these women worked outside the home and included 220 white-collar workers (73 percent) and 28 blue-collar workers (9 percent). Thirty-four women (11 percent) were homemakers. Within this sample, 197 women (66 percent) met the selection criteria for low-risk pregnancies based on known sociodemographic, medical, and health risk factors. Although the sample numbers were small, comparison of low-risk white-collar workers (n = 141) with low-risk homemakers (n = 24) showed significant differences for rates of Cesarean section for failure to progress (16 percent versus 0 percent, P less than 0.05) and a summary index of poor delivery and/or infant outcome (21 percent versus 4 percent, P less than 0.05). No other adverse outcomes were significantly associated with occupation. This study suggests that increased pregnancy risks may be associated with white-collar work in otherwise low-risk women.\r"

Biocompatibility data were compared to those obtained from 11 calves (group B) that received a total artificial heart (TAH) and were electively terminated 50.0 +/- 19.5 days after implantation. The hematocrit values in the first week were 20.9 +/- 11.5% and 39.8 +/- 11.5% below control values for group A and group B, respectively (p less than 0.02); in the sixth week they were 5.1 +/- 14.6% above control values (group A) and 22.6 +/- 9.0% below control values (group B) (p less than 0.05). LDH did not change in group A, while in group B it was constantly about 100% above control values. Autopsy revealed one to three infarcts 1 to 3 mm in diameter in 63% of the kidneys in group A, while in all of group B kidneys there were multiple infarcts of more than 10 mm.

However, reduction in pulmonary capillary wedge pressure tended to be less with dobutamine, 15.7 +/- 7.9 vs 12.5 +/- 6.4 mm Hg (NS). Hemodynamic benefits of oral CI-930 were equivalent to that of the parenteral drug. Duration of action was 9 to 12 hours. Chronic therapy resulted in subjective improvement in approximately 50% of patients.

In addition, in a comparison patients with LVEDP greater than or equal to 20 mm Hg to those with LVEDP less than 20 mm Hg, peak early filling velocity (R) was significantly higher, peak late filling velocity (A) was lower, and hence R/A and area under the early filling curve/area under the late diastolic filling curve (E/L) ratios were significantly higher in patients with markedly elevated filling pressures (LVEDP 20 mm Hg: R = 41 +/- 12, A = 56 +/- 16, R/A = 0.75 +/- 0.23, E/L = 1.0 +/- 0.4, n = 54, and LVEDP greater than or equal to 20 mm Hg: R = 49 +/- 18, A = 46 +/- 12, R/A = 1.23 +/- 0.9, E/L = 1.94 +/- 1.2, n = 34.

Since preoperative volume-to-mass indices have been shown to be important predictors of postoperative course, the L/D ratio should be a useful and simple parameter to follow in asymptomatic patients.\r"

Seventy-seven patients were studied, 47 control subjects and 30 patients with ventricular septal defect (VSD). LVOV was calculated from the left ventricular ejection flow velocity and left ventricular outflow tract diameter; LVIV was calculated from the transmitral flow velocity and mitral valve motion as traced by M-mode echocardiography. Cardiac input (COin) and cardiac output (COout) were calculated as the product of LVIV or LVOV and heart rate. Cardiac output was also determined by the dye dilution method (COdye) in control subjects. A close correlation was observed between COdye and COin (y = 1.18x - 243, r = 0.85, p less than 0.005, SEE = 1026 ml/min) and COdye and COout (y = 1.16x - 323, r = 0.90, p less than 0.005, SEE = 639 ml/min). LVIV and LVOV were highly correlated in control subjects (y = 0.95x + 5.3, r = 0.94, p less than 0.005, SEE = 6.6 ml). LVIV/LVOV was 0.97 +/- 0.1 (mean +/- SD) in control subjects, whereas LVIV/LVOV (1.87 +/- 0.88) was significantly higher in patients with VSD (p less than 0.01). In patients with VSD, LVIV/LVOV correlated with Qp/Qs determined invasively (y = 0.97, SEE = 0.23, n = 16). Thus with our method LVIV and COin can be accurately determined, and we suggest that Doppler-determined LVIV/LVOV is clinically useful for evaluating the shunt flow magnitude in VSD.\r"

This arrangement produces mechanical obstruction to both vertical vein flow and pulmonary venous drainage. Early detection and surgical correction of obstructed pulmonary venous return are necessary to prevent severe right-sided heart failure and death. Doppler echocardiography is recommended when evaluating infants with TAPVC for possible anatomic or mechanical obstruction to pulmonary venous return.\r"

In order to determine if echocardiographic left atrial enlargement is an early sign of hypertensive heart disease, we evaluated 10 normal and 14 hypertensive patients undergoing routine diagnostic cardiac catheterization for echocardiographic left atrial enlargement. All patients had normal coronary arteriography, sinus rhythm, normal left ventricular volumes and function, no valvular disease, and no echocardiographic or ECG left ventricular hypertrophy. No patient met ECG criteria for left atrial abnormality. The mean left atrial dimension was 3.46 +/- 0.3 cm in normal individuals versus 4.04 +/- 0.3 cm in the hypertensive patients (p less than 0.01). The left atrial index was also higher in the hypertensive group, 2.18 +/- 0.45 versus 1.88 +/- 0.10 cm/m2 (p less than 0.05), and the left atrial-to-aortic root dimension ratio was significantly higher in the hypertensive group, 1.36 +/- 0.20 versus 1.17 +/- 0.07 (p less than 0.01).

The group having induced \"cardiac\" pain differed from the group without induced pain only in their higher incidence of induced ischemic ST changes, the \"marked\" hemodynamic response, and their lower incidence of an \"absent\" hemodynamic response (all p less than 0.01). Induced ST depression was found only in patients with coronary disease. In this population, dipyridamole-induced pain was a moderately specific marker and induced ST abnormalities a more highly specific marker for coronary disease. However, both were insensitive for coronary disease diagnosis. If induced pain or ST abnormalities in the presence of significant coronary disease were accepted as indicators of ischemia, then scintigraphic abnormalities appeared to be produced by dipyridamole in roughly equal incidence by ischemic and nonischemic mechanisms. Induced ischemia related frequently to an exaggerated hypotensive response with no change in double product, suggesting its cause to be an induced increase in myocardial oxygen demand. Dipyridamole-induced image defects were noted even in the absence of a peripheral hemodynamic response. This indicates that the peripheral response does not always correlate with its central coronary effect and an absent peripheral hemodynamic response does not necessarily invalidate scintigraphic results.\r"

Refractory periods and conduction times of patients with apparently normal atria were compared to those of patients with a history of persistent sinus bradycardia, atrial fibrillation, or other forms of primary atrial tachyarrhythmia. Refractory periods and thresholds were derived from strength-interval curves. Conduction times were measured for all premature beats induced. Threshold, refractory periods, and conduction times of premature beats induced late in the cardiac cycle did not distinguish patients with normal atria from patients with bradycardia or tachycardia. In contrast, increases in conduction time of early cycle premature beats separated patients with these abnormalities from patients with normal atria. The increases in interatrial and intraatrial conduction time of early cycle premature beats were the strongest correlates of primary atrial tachyarrhythmia (r = 0.52, p = 0.0065 and r = 0.274, p = 0.041, respectively) and induction of repetitive atrial firing (r = 0.65, p = 0.002, and r = 0.59, p = 0.0001, respectively). This increase in conduction time of early cycle premature beats may predispose these patients to primary atrial tachyarrhythmias.\r"

  ".W": "The technique of automated whole-day blood pressure monitoring by noninvasive, lightweight portable devices has recently become available for clinical use. This article, together with the six that follow it, comprise the proceedings of a symposium on the diagnostic and prognostic use of this new approach. There is a growing belief that standard clinical methods may overdiagnose hypertension (the phenomenon of \"white coat\" or \"office\" hypertension), subjecting some patients to unnecessary long-term treatment. The automated blood pressure monitoring procedure may be especially helpful in evaluating patients whose office-diagnosed hypertension is not associated with confirmatory clinical findings or history. Data derived from whole-day blood pressure measurements appear to be more reproducible than conventional blood pressure values and correlate more closely with evidence for cardiovascular changes. This symposium has addressed some of the issues associated with the monitoring techniques, including the accuracy of values obtained with noninvasive equipment, interpretation of the data, and costs of the procedure. The evidence and arguments presented by these papers suggest that automated blood pressure monitoring is becoming a justified and desirable procedure in selected patients with a preliminary clinical diagnosis of mild to moderate hypertension.\r"

  ".W": "Traditional sphygmomanometric blood pressure measurements may lead to errors in the diagnosis of arterial hypertension due to a number of factors, among which are the alerting reaction and pressor response induced in patients by the doctor's visit. This phenomenon, as quantified in our laboratory by continuous intraarterial recordings, is responsible for an average rise in systolic and diastolic blood pressure of 27/15 mm Hg, a rise that does not seem to be reduced by simply desensitizing the patient by means of more frequent physician visits. Twenty-four hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring may theoretically improve the diagnostic approach to hypertensive patients by overcoming some limitations of isolated cuff measurements. In recording intraarterial blood pressure in 108 ambulant hypertensive subjects, we have found that 24-hour blood pressure values are able to discriminate among patients with different degrees of target organ damage better than isolated sphygmomanometric readings. Moreover, these studies have indicated that 24-hour blood pressure variability may be as important as blood pressure mean values in the assessment of cardiovascular complications. In clinical practice, however, intraarterial blood pressure monitoring is not feasible, and only noninvasive recorders can be used. Use of these devices does not induce any alerting reaction in the patients and does not interfere with day-night blood pressure changes. Although it is characterized by intermittent readings, this approach is not incompatible with a precise estimate of 24-hour blood pressure mean values.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Many of the variations in blood pressure that are observed during a normal day are predictable and can be attributed to factors such as physical activity, the sleep-wakefulness cycle, eating and drinking, and mental stress. In general, hypertensive persons show patterns of change similar to those of normotensive persons, but their diurnal profiles of pressure are reset at a higher level.\r"

  ".W": "Detection of mild hypertension by a small number of casual blood pressures may be inaccurate for the determination of average blood pressure. Nonetheless, casual pressures remain the basis for the diagnosis and treatment of hypertensive patients. We compared casual and noninvasive ambulatory blood pressure monitoring in a consecutive series of 60 subjects evaluated for possible mild hypertension on the basis of casual pressures. Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring was performed on days of usual activity. Correlations between casual systolic and average ambulatory systolic pressures or casual diastolic and average ambulatory diastolic pressures were not significant. Nearly half of the subjects had average ambulatory systolic pressures less than 130 mm Hg. Sixty percent had average ambulatory diastolic pressures less than 85 mm Hg. Nearly 40% had both systolic and diastolic pressures less than those limits. A preliminary analysis of the effects of these results on the short-term cost of antihypertensive treatment was made, assuming that treatment could be withheld from those with average ambulatory pressures less than 130/85 mm Hg. This approach suggests that ambulatory blood pressure monitoring need not increase overall cost, if the results of this evaluation are used in the decision to treat.\r"

Systolic blood pressure values with portable devices that use auscultatory or oscillometric methods of measurement correlated significantly with intra-arterial values (r = 0.74 and 0.89; p less than 0.001 for both); similarly, diastolic values correlated significantly (r = 0.86 and 0.81; p less than 0.001 for both). Compared with intra-arterial measurements, there was a slight tendency for the portable devices to underestimate systolic blood pressure and overestimate diastolic blood pressure. Correlations between auscultatory or oscillometric measurements and sphygmomanometer measurements in these patients were also significant; moreover, the absolute blood pressure values obtained with the portable devices were almost identical to those with the sphymomanometer. In a further group of 12 volunteers, auscultatory and oscillometric values correlated very closely with simultaneously measured sphygmomanometer values for both systolic (r = 0.99 and 0.98) and diastolic (r = 0.96 and 0.94) blood pressures. An auscultatory device that uses continuous ECG R wave gating for Korotkoff sounds was also found to be highly accurate. Thus we have found that automated portable devices that use either auscultatory or oscillometric methods of measurement provide reliable blood pressure values.\r"

With the use of multivarate analysis of variables observed at hospital discharge in patients with a first MI, age was the most important predictor, followed by left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) (determined in 56%) and other variables. Based on this finding, age subsets (less than or equal to 50, 51 to 70, greater than 70 years) were related to LVEF groups (less than or equal to 0.40, 0.41 to 0.50, greater than 0.50). Patients with a first MI who were less than 50 years of age with LVEF greater than 0.40 and patients between 51 and 70 years of age with LVEF greater than 0.50 had a very low risk for 1-year cardiac death, 1.2 +/- 1.1% (95% confidence interval). Such patients comprised 47% of individuals with a first MI having an LVEF determination. Mortality in the remaining patients less than 70 years was 7.4 +/- 3.5%. Mortality for patients greater than 70 years was high, 22.2 +/- 6.6%. Thus with LVEF as the only predischarge test, a sizable low risk group can be identified among patients with a first MI.\r"

Patients were divided into two groups: group A included 21 patients with horizontal or downward-sloping ST depression with peaked positive T waves, and group B comprised 11 patients with peaked negative T waves and downward or horizontal ST depression. The incidence of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) was similar (group A 38.1% vs group B 36.4%; p greater than 0.05). In-hospital mortality was much more significant in group B (p = 0.03). Coronary arteriography was performed in 31 patients. Of the 10 patients in group B who were catheterized, seven (70%) had left main occlusion. Of the 21 patients in group A, none had a significant left main lesion (p = 0.001), although eight (38.1%) had single-vessel disease (p = 0.05). Thus the ECG pattern of horizontal or downward-sloping ST depression passing into a peaked negative T wave identifies a subgroup of high-risk patients in whom the prognosis is poor once AMI occurs. Early catheterization is recommended when this ischemic pattern is apparent on the ECG.\r"

  ".W": "In the setting of acute myocardial infarction, pharmacologic intervention resulting in afterload changes are common but the effect of these changes on regional left ventricular function, and specifically the functional border zone, has not been fully investigated. Accordingly, we studied the effects of afterload manipulation on circumferential flow-function relationships and the functional border zone in 16 open-chest, anesthetized dogs. During left circumflex coronary artery occlusion, eight animals were infused with phenylephrine to increase afterload; eight others received nitroprusside for afterload reduction. Following coronary artery occlusion, subendocardial blood flow and wall thickening decreased in the ischemic zone (p less than 0.001). The circumferential extent of hypoperfusion did not differ when coronary artery occlusion alone was compared to occlusion in combination with phenylephrine or nitroprusside, but in both groups the circumferential extent of the wall thickening abnormality was consistently greater than the extent of hypoperfusion. When blood pressure was decreased by 33%, the extent of the functional border zone did not change relative to that during coronary artery occlusion (22 +/- 11 degrees vs 36 +/- 16 degrees, p = ns). Similarly, when blood pressure was increased by 47%, the extent of the functional border zone did not change (32 +/- 10 degrees vs 37 +/- 10 degrees). Therefore circumferential flow-function relations and the spatial extent of the functional border zone are not altered by changing afterload during acute left circumflex coronary artery occlusion in this model.\r"

  ".W": "Doppler echocardiographic indexes of ascending aortic blood flow velocity have been found to be an effective method of assessing changes in left ventricular performance induced by myocardial ischemia in both experimental animal preparations and in patients. In eight opened-chest anesthetized dogs, we investigated the influence of heart rate, aortic blood pressure, and size of the ischemic zone on Doppler indexes during regional myocardial ischemia. With control of mean aortic blood pressure and heart rate, transient coronary artery occlusion resulted in a statistically significant decline in peak velocity and mean velocity when as little as 24% of left ventricular myocardium was rendered ischemic. However, when heart rate and mean aortic blood pressure were not controlled, significant declines in peak velocity and mean velocity occurred only with simultaneous two-vessel occlusions involving greater than 47% of left ventricular myocardium. Although transient coronary artery occlusions generally produced no significant change in heart rate in the absence of atrial pacing, significant declines in aortic blood pressure were observed. We conclude that Doppler indexes of left ventricular performance obtained during myocardial ischemia are influenced not only by the extent of myocardium rendered ischemic, but also by changes in mean aortic blood pressure.\r"

All patients had severe chronic stable angina of at least 6 months' duration despite medical treatment, and exhibited coronary artery stenosis of 75% in one or more coronary arteries. Metoprolol reduced the frequency of total (p less than 0.01) and asymptomatic ischemic episodes (p less than 0.05), the duration of ischemia (p less than 0.05), and the ischemic burden (p less than 0.05), which contrasted to the lack of any similar significant effect during nifedipine monotherapy. During combination therapy, there was a tendency to further improvement, which did not reach statistical significance compared with metoprolol monotherapy. Heart rate at the onset of ischemia was reduced by metoprolol therapy (p less than 0.01), indicating that metoprolol acts by reducing myocardial oxygen demand even during ischemic episodes observed in daily life, where impairments of myocardial oxygen supply are suspected. No change in heart rate at the onset of ischemia could be detected during nifedipine monotherapy. It is concluded that metoprolol monotherapy, as well as its combination with nifedipine, effectively reduces total ischemic activity compared with placebo and nifedipine monotherapy. Control of ischemic activity in chronic stable angina may have prognostic implications.\r"

Dipyridamole was then infused intravenously over 4 minutes, creating hyperemic flows in the anterior descending (LAD) coronary system. Tc-TBI was administered, then LAD and LCX regional myocardial Tc-TBI activities were continuously monitored with miniature detectors and gamma camera imaging over 3 hours. Microsphere-determined regional myocardial blood flows demonstrated an LCX/LAD flow ratio of 0.81 +/- 0.21 at rest and 0.45 +/- 0.24 (SD) during dipyridamole infusion. Three-hour fractional Tc-TBI clearance rates were minimal and were equal in the LAD (0.14 +/- 0.11) and LCX (0.13 +/- 0.12) zones (p = ns). Excellent gamma camera images, demonstrating the LCX defect, were obtained in all dogs. The correlation coefficient was 0.98 for regional myocardial blood flow vs initial Tc-TBI distribution. In conclusion: (1) Dipyridamole vasodilation unmasked coronary stenoses despite no flow disparities at rest. (2) The initial distribution of Tc-TBI is proportional to regional myocardial blood flow. (3) There is minimal washout and no redistribution into the initial defect over time, and thus image quality is stable over time. (4) Tc-TBI myocardial kinetics may be applicable to closely related agents currently being developed.\r"

Twenty-one patients (28%) were found to have carotid sinus hypersensitivity. Of these 21 patients, 11 (52%) had coronary artery disease, two (10%) had hypertensive heart disease, and eight (38%) had no organic heart disease. During electrophysiologic studies, abnormal sinus node function was found in three patients (14%), abnormal atrioventricular (AV) node function was noted in four (19%), and combined abnormal sinus node and AV node functions were seen in three (14%). Eleven patients (53%) had a normal electrophysiologic study. During carotid sinus massage, sinus arrest alone was observed in 12 patients (57%), and combined sinus arrest and AV nodal block was seen in nine (43%). Thirteen patients were treated with a permanent pacemaker, in whom either carotid sinus massage reproduced the symptom or concomitant sinus node or AV node abnormality, or organic heart disease was present. With a mean follow-up of 42 +/- 19 months, none of these 13 patients had recurrent syncope. However, one of eight patients (13%) who did not receive a pacemaker had recurrence of syncope. Subsequently, this patient has done well after implantation of a pacemaker. These observations suggest that there is a significant incidence of carotid sinus hypersensitivity in patients with unexplained syncope. Permanent pacing appears to be beneficial in selected patients based on clinical and electrophysiologic findings.\r"

  ".W": "The results of exercise treadmill stress testing were analyzed in 64 consecutive patients presenting with either ventricular fibrillation (42%) or hemodynamically significant ventricular tachycardia (58%). Underlying diseases included coronary artery disease (55%), dilated cardiomyopathy (16%), and miscellaneous disorders (29%). Patients were additionally studied with ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring and programmed stimulation. During exercise testing, 22 patients (34%) had nonsustained and five (8%) had sustained ventricular tachycardia. No patient experienced ventricular fibrillation or a major complication during exercise testing. Patients with a history of ventricular fibrillation were significantly less likely to have exercise-induced ventricular tachycardia than those with a history of ventricular tachycardia. Other clinical factors were not associated with the results of exercise testing. The results of programmed stimulation did not correlate with the results of exercise testing. Ventricular tachycardia was commonly documented during ambulatory monitoring (72%), but this was not predictive of ventricular tachycardia during exercise. However, patients who did not have ventricular tachycardia during ambulatory monitoring were predictably unlikely to have it during exercise testing (p less than 0.002). Thus exercise testing is safe and can provoke ventricular tachycardia in a significant proportion of patients with life-threatening arrhythmias.\r"

  ".W": "Twenty-three patients with essential hypertension and diabetes mellitus type II were treated with the calcium antagonist diltiazem (120 to 180 mg twice daily). The mean dose was 307 mg/day. The study was a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover design. All measurements were performed 12 to 14 hours after drug intake. Blood pressure, heart rate and forearm blood flow were measured noninvasively. Platelet function was studied by measuring adenosine diphosphate-induced platelet aggregation and the platelet specific proteins, beta thromboglobulin and platelet factor 4. Thromboxane B2 formation in serum and the plasma concentration of diltiazem and its metabolites N-demethyldiltiazem, deacetyldiltiazem and N-demethyldeacetyldiltiazem were measured both during placebo and diltiazem treatment. Diabetic control was evaluated by following HbA1C, fasting blood glucose and urinary glucose. Diltiazem reduced both systolic and diastolic (supine and standing) blood pressure significantly. Forearm blood flow was significantly increased by 32%, p less than 0.05. Supine heart rate decreased significantly, while no such change was seen in the standing position. No significant changes were observed in platelet function during diltiazem treatment. There was no relation between the observed blood pressure reduction and the plasma concentration of diltiazem or its metabolites. A positive correlation between the change in heart rate and the metabolite N-demethyldeacetyldiltiazem was observed (r = 0.647, p = 0.005). Three patients were excluded during diltiazem treatment (skin exanthema, headache and atrial fibrillation) and 1 during placebo treatment (angina pectoris). No negative effect on diabetes control was observed. Thus, diltiazem could be used for treatment of hypertension in diabetic patients.\r"

  ".W": "Catecholamine excess has been shown to produce 2 distinct forms of irreversible myocardial necrosis termed contraction band lesions. Calcium channel blocking agents provided a variable protective effect from these contraction band lesions. The purpose of this study was to determine the temporal responses of the most effective of these blocking agents, diltiazem, when given before, simultaneous with or after an initial exposure to a necrogenic infusion of norepinephrine (NE). Forty-one adult mongrel dogs were anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital (32 mg/kg) and infused with saline solution or NE (4 micrograms/kg/min) for 60 minutes or diltiazem at a rate of 20 micrograms/kg/min for the first 5 minutes and 10 micrograms/kg/min for the remaining 70 minutes. Diltiazem was infused as pretreatment 15 minutes before continued infusion with NE for 60 minutes, simultaneously infused with NE for 60 minutes or delayed 30 minutes after the start of NE infusion. Diltiazem alone exhibited no significant effect on hemodynamics, but pretreatment with diltiazem was able to moderate the rapid NE-induced increases in heart rate. NE infusion produced significant numbers of the 2 forms of contraction band lesions: (1) paradiscal contraction band lesions involving a small portion of the cell adjacent to the disc, and (2) holocytic contraction band lesions involving the entire cell. Diltiazem reduced the number of contraction band lesions, particularly the holocytic contraction band lesions, provided diltiazem was available before the insult and massive influx of calcium with a pharmacologic dose of NE. Although the exact mechanism of diltiazem's cardioprotective properties is not known, the timing of drug administration does appear to affect the degree of protection.\r"

  ".W": "Systemic and regional hemodynamic effects of 2 benzothiazepine derivatives, diltiazem and its congener TA-3090, were studied both acutely and chronically in spontaneously hypertensive (SHR) and normotensive Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats. All hemodynamic data were obtained in the conscious state using the reference sample radiomicrosphere method. Mean arterial pressure was reduced significantly with both immediate and more long-term treatment with both drugs in the SHR. The hypotensive action of TA-3090 was about 3 times as potent as diltiazem. The pressure reduction with both drugs was associated with a decrease in total peripheral resistance. TA-3090 seemed to have lesser effect on heart rate than diltiazem, although its net effect on cardiac output was similar, remaining unchanged in each study group. After intravenous injection, both diltiazem and TA-3090 significantly reduced vascular resistances of the major target organs of hypertension: heart, brain and kidneys in SHR. However, with prolonged treatment, organ vascular resistances seemed to be nonuniformly distributed. Intrarenal hemodynamics revealed significant differences between SHR and WKY rats after intravenous diltiazem and prolonged treatment with TA-3090. Thus, efferent as well as afferent arteriolar resistance decreased and therefore calculated glomerular capillary hydrostatic pressure decreased in SHR; however, efferent resistance and glomerular pressure remained unchanged in WKY rats. In contrast, intravenous TA-3090 evoked no such differences. Thus, diltiazem as well as TA-3090 dilated efferent as well as afferent arterioles in the SHR but not in the WKY rats. This effect was associated with a reduction in glomerular capillary pressure, preventing glomerular hyperfiltration through efferent arteriolar dilation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Accordingly, 56 patients (50 men and 6 women, ages 58 +/- 10 years [mean +/- standard deviation]) with evolving acute myocardial infarction and chest pain less than or equal to 5 hours in duration were assigned to receive varying doses of streptokinase. Twenty were administered 500,000 units during 145 minutes, 18 were given 750,000 units during 30 minutes and 18 received 1.5 million units in 60 minutes of streptokinase. Serum creatine kinase was measured on admission and 6, 12, 18 and 24 hours after the initiation of streptokinase. The time intervals from onset of pain to peak creatine kinase and from streptokinase administration to peak creatine kinase were used to determine the occurrence of reperfusion. The plasma fibrinogen concentration was measured 30, 60, 90 and 120 minutes after the initiation of streptokinase. For the 3 groups, the time from onset of pain to peak creatine kinase was less than 17 hours and the time from streptokinase to peak creatine kinase was 6 or 12 hours in 15 (75%), 16 (89%) and 12 patients (67%), respectively (differences not significant). The plasma fibrinogen concentration decreased to 45 +/- 34 mg/dl, 19 +/- 14 mg/dl and 29 +/- 43 mg/dl, respectively, during the 2 hours after streptokinase was begun (p less than 0.05 for the first versus the second and third values).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Although the number of elderly patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) has steadily increased and these patients are known to have a higher early subsequent mortality than younger patients, the reasons for this adverse prognosis are poorly understood. We compared the clinical courses of 217 patients, ages 65 to 75 years, with 631 patients younger than 65 years of age enrolled in the Multicenter Investigation of the Limitation of Infarct Size (MILIS). The older group had a higher prevalence of adverse baseline risk factors, including history of congestive heart failure (14 vs 7%, p less than 0.001), previous AMI (28 vs 22%, p less than 0.05), angina pectoris (42 vs 34%, p less than 0.05), systemic hypertension (64 vs 52%, p less than 0.01), diabetes mellitus (24 vs 17%, p less than 0.05) and female gender (37 vs 24%, p less than 0.001). Despite having a smaller infarct size index than younger patients (15 +/- 1 vs 18 +/- 1 CK-MB g-Eq/m2, p less than 0.002), the elderly patients had a lower admission left ventricular ejection fraction (43 +/- 1 vs 47 +/- 1%, p less than 0.01) and a higher frequency of clinical congestive heart failure (44 vs 28%, p less than 0.001) and in-hospital death (14 vs 7%, p less than 0.01). The 1-year mortality for elderly hospital survivors was also markedly greater (19 vs 5%, p less than 0.001) as was the 4-year mortality (35 vs 13%, p less than 0.001). Adjustment for 7 adverse baseline characteristics in the elderly could account for their increased in-hospital mortality. However, these and 12 additional in-hospital characteristics did not account for the increased 1- and 4-year mortalities of the elderly hospital survivors, which are presumably affected by variables not included in the present age-associated study.\r"

Patients were divided into 3 groups according to the severity of ventricular arrhythmia: no or mild (unifocal, maximal hourly ventricular premature complex rate less than 30, n = 6), moderate (maximal hourly ventricular premature complex rate greater than or equal to 30 or multifocal, n = 6) or severe (R on T, greater than or equal to 2 consecutive ventricular premature complexes or ventricular fibrillation, n = 9). Polymorphonuclear leukocyte count and its leukotriene B4 production were increased with the increase in severity of ventricular arrhythmia among 3 groups. Polymorphonuclear leukocyte count (13,300 +/- 900/microliter, mean +/- standard error of the mean) and its leukotriene B4 production (194 +/- 24 ng/10(7) cells) in patients exhibiting severe ventricular arrhythmia were significantly increased compared with those in patients exhibiting no or mild ventricular arrhythmia (10,300 +/- 1,000/microliter, p less than 0.05 and 120 +/- 21 ng/10(7) cells, p less than 0.05, respectively). Enzymatically estimated infarct size in the latter patient group was significantly smaller than those of the other 2 groups, between which there was no difference in infarct size. These results suggest that polymorphonuclear leukocyte activity is closely related to the incidence and severity of ventricular arrhythmia during the early phase of myocardial infarction.\r"

Primary success was achieved in 2,479 (93%) patients. The primary success rate was significantly lower during the first period, when nonsteerable systems were used (73%), than in later periods (94%) (p less than 0.0001), when steerable and low-profile systems became available. Univariate analysis revealed the following variables as predictors of lower primary success: totally obstructed arteries (p less than 0.0001), presence of calcium in the narrowing (p = 0.002), prior myocardial infarction (p = 0.005), stenoses located in the right coronary artery (p = 0.02), narrowings between 90 and 99% in diameter (p = 0.02) and patients older than 60 years of age (p = 0.07). Multivariate analysis revealed the following 4 independent predictors of lower primary success: 100% obstruction (p less than 0.0001), calcium (p = 0.005), previous myocardial infarction (p = 0.029) and patients older than 60 years of age (p = 0.036). With present technology, single-narrowing elective PTCA can be performed with a high success rate in most patients. Although total occlusion, presence of calcium, older age and history of myocardial infarction influence the outcome unfavorably, PTCA can still be performed with acceptable primary success rates.\r"

Doppler echocardiographic recordings were also performed in 14 age- and heart rate-matched normal subjects. Statistically significant differences (p less than 0.05) in acceleration half-time (55.3 +/- 8.2 vs 70.4 +/- 14.9 ms), deceleration half-time (83.1 +/- 17.9 vs 109.5 +/- 18.1 ms), deceleration rate (4.9 +/- 0.9 vs 3.1 +/- 0.9 m/s2), peak velocity of early diastolic left ventricular inflow (E wave) (0.78 +/- 0.13 vs 0.61 +/- 0.13 m/s) and A/E ratio (0.74 +/- 0.20 vs 0.98 +/- 0.31) between normal subjects and patients were noted. There was no significant difference in peak velocity of atrial systolic flow (A wave) between normal subjects and patients. Correlation between transmitral flow indexes and hemodynamic indexes of left ventricular diastolic properties were poor, with r values ranging from 0.02 to 0.65. Significant correlations between deceleration rate versus maximal isovolumic left ventricular pressure decrease (maximum -dP/dt) and A wave versus maximum -dP/dt (p less than 0.05) were found (0.53 and 0.65, respectively). Deceleration rate was the most sensitive index of isovolumic relaxation assessed by hemodynamic methods, whereas the A/E ratio was a poor indicator of hemodynamic measurements of isovolumic relaxation. An abnormal deceleration rate had 100% specificity for detecting abnormal maximum -dP/dt, while abnormal acceleration half-time, deceleration half-time and A/E ratio had 80% specificity for detecting abnormal time constant. The deceleration rate, acceleration half-time, deceleration half-time and A/E ratio had a predictive value of 60 to 100% for the detection of abnormal maximum -dP/dt and time constant.\r"

Patients with angina pectoris, myocardial infarction and severe cardiac diseases were excluded. Temporary right ventricular pacing was set at a rate of 60 beats/min to prevent transient bradyarrhythmias during intracoronary injection of acetylcholine. Measurements of coronary sinus blood flow and coronary vascular resistance and quantification of coronary arterial diameters using a computer-assisted technique were performed before and after each injection of 20, 50 and 100 micrograms of acetylcholine. Significant increase in coronary sinus blood flow and significant decrease in coronary vascular resistance occurred after intracoronary injection of acetylcholine. In contrast, mean diameter of normal epicardial coronary artery tended to decrease and that of irregular epicardial coronary artery decreased significantly after intracoronary injection of acetylcholine. Intracoronary injection of acetylcholine increases coronary blood flow, suggesting vasodilation in the coronary arteriolar bed, while it induces vasoconstriction in most of epicardial coronary arteries in adult humans.\r"

Discriminant accuracy (quantified in terms of the area under a receiver-operating characteristic curve for each variable) ranged from 50 to 73% for diagnosis, and from 54 to 77% for prognosis. Although there was a great deal of variability from test to test, variables representing direct or indirect manifestations of myocardial ischemia tended to correlate better with prognosis. Thus, variables derived from radionuclide angiography and thallium scintigraphy tended to have more prognostic accuracy than diagnostic accuracy, while fluoroscopy tended to have more diagnostic accuracy than prognostic accuracy. The pattern associated with clinical evaluation and exercise electrocardiography was less discernable. Accordingly, the accuracy of noninvasive tests with respect to diagnosis and prognosis of CAD should be separately determined based on individual empiric observation.\r"

  ".W": "A noninvasive procedure has been developed to assess effectiveness of activity-sensing rate response ventricular (VVIR) pacing systems in patients with implanted conventional fixed-rate ventricular (VVI) pacemakers capable of triggered mode operation (VVT). A VVIR pacemaker (activity threshold medium or low, rate response 6 to 10, upper rate 125 or 150 beats/min) was strapped to the chest wall (prepectoral area) of patients with previously implanted fixed-rate VVI pacemakers. In 17 of the 18 patients included in the study, the implanted pacemaker was capable of triggered mode operation (VVT). Triggering of the conventional pacemaker was achieved by reprogramming it to the VVT mode (high sensitivity, short refractory) and connecting the output of the \"strapped-on\" VVIR pacemaker (5 volts, 1.5-ms pulse width) to 2 standard cutaneous electrodes positioned so as to be in proximity to the implanted intracardiac electrode system. Patients underwent symptom-limited treadmill exercise tests during both VVI and VVIR pacing. Triggering conventional VVI pulse generators by a \"strapped-on\" VVIR pacing system proved feasible in 16 of 17 cases and improved overall heart rate response (fixed rate 86 +/- 22 vs VVIR 118 +/- 7 beats/min) and exercise duration (fixed rate 6.6 +/- 4.9 vs VVIR 10.1 +/- 4.8 minutes) (mean values for all patients studied during exercise testing). Triggering of a previously implanted permanent pacemaker by a strapped-on activity-triggered device may be useful to assess rate response pacing before implantation of a VVIR device in patients in whom elective pulse generator replacement is planned.\r"

  ".W": "Cardiac hemodynamics were studied in 22 patients (mean age 55 +/- 2 years, range 22 to 73) with rate-responsive pacemakers using the continuous-wave Doppler method to assess ascending aortic blood flow. Compared with constant rate ventricular (VVI) pacing, rate-responsive pacing conferred improvements in exercise capacity (39 +/- 9%, p less than 0.001) and cardiac output (41 +/- 8%, p less than 0.001). Cardiac output increased by 141 +/- 21% over the resting value and 56% of this increase was mediated by the ability of these pacemakers to increase their pacing rate. Doppler-derived peak aortic flow velocity, acceleration and stroke distance were lower during maximal exercise in the rate-responsive mode and there was a trend toward a higher systolic blood pressure response. Neither age nor echocardiographic and Doppler-derived variables (at rest and during peak exercise in the VVI mode) could predict the hemodynamic and functional benefits conferred by rate-responsive pacing during exercise, although left ventricular function had a weak correlation. It was concluded that rate-responsive pacing significantly benefits patients with bradycardia, although the extent of the benefit is not predictable, and that advanced age alone should not be a barrier to the use of a rate-responsive pacemaker.\r"

  ".W": "The immediate and short-term effects of lisinopril, a new converting enzyme inhibitor, on systemic and regional hemodynamics, cardiac structure and function and humoral indexes were evaluated in 10 patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension. A single oral dose of 5 mg lisinopril reduced mean arterial pressure from 118 to 104 mm Hg (p less than 0.01) and significantly increased (p less than 0.05) all load-dependent indexes of ventricular function (i.e., ejection fraction, velocity of circumferential fiber shortening and fractional fiber shortening rate). After 10 to 12 weeks of once-daily administration of lisinopril, mean arterial pressure remained reduced over a full 24-hour period (p less than 0.01), and was mediated through arteriolar dilation as expressed by the close correlation (r = 0.93, p less than 0.01) between changes in mean arterial pressure and changes in total peripheral resistance. Cardiac index decreased from 3.06 to 2.68 liters/min/m2 (p less than 0.01) without correlation to the decrease in arterial pressure (r = 0.06). Despite this reduction in cardiac index, renal blood flow increased from 861 to 1,053 ml/min (p less than 0.05) and renal vascular resistance decreased from 14 to 9 units (p less than 0.01). Left ventricular mass index decreased from 124 to 109 g/m2 (p less than 0.05), and left ventricular function remained unchanged. Thus, the decrease in arterial pressure produced by lisinopril was associated with improved renal hemodynamics and reduced left ventricular mass.\r"

Systemic arterial pressure was normal before ECMO (67 +/- 12 mm Hg), increased during ECMO (78 +/- 13 mm Hg) and decreased to baseline after ECMO (p less than or equal to 0.01). Heart rate was normal before ECMO and did not change during or after ECMO. The left ventricular shortening fraction was normal before ECMO (37 +/- 11%), decreased after beginning ECMO (25 +/- 11%) and returned to baseline 72 hours after beginning ECMO (p less than or equal to 0.01). Pulmonary arterial and aortic blood flow velocities were normal before ECMO, decreased 30 to 50% during ECMO and increased to baseline 72 hours after beginning ECMO (p less than or equal to 0.01). Stroke volume had an identical trend (p less than or equal to 0.01). Left ventricular velocity of circumferential shortening--an index of contractility--decreased after beginning ECMO (p less than or equal to 0.05). Left ventricular systolic wall stress--an index of systemic afterload--increased after beginning ECMO (p less than or equal to 0.01). A patent ductus arteriosus was present in 13 of 19 infants before ECMO, 16 of 19 infants during ECMO and in none of 19 infants after ECMO. Pulmonary arterial systolic pressure was high before ECMO (72 +/- 25 mm Hg), began to decrease after 48 hours on ECMO (59 +/- 24 mm Hg) and was normal after ECMO (38 +/- 18 mm Hg), p less than or equal to 0.05.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "After experimental investigation using postmortem human arteries, 19 patients with chronic peripheral artery occlusions were treated with a new angioplasty technique between December 1986 and October 1987. In 17 patients the superficial femoral artery and in 2 patients the popliteal artery were completely occluded. The length of the occlusions ranged between 5 and 25 cm (mean 11). The duration--estimated according to patients' history--was 5 to 48 months (mean 17). In 5 patients, durations of up to 30 months had been documented by angiography. A flexible, blunt, motor-driven rotating catheter was introduced through an 8 or 9Fr sheath and rotational angioplasty was performed at low speeds (up to 200 rpm). In 11 of 14 patients in whom this new technique was used as the primary intervention, the occlusions could be successfully reopened. In 2 patients after failure of conventional techniques the rotating catheter could not bypass the preexisting dissections in the same intervention. In 2 of 3 further patients after failure of conventional techniques the occlusions could be successfully reopened in a second intervention after several weeks. In none of the 19 patients did a perforation occur. It is concluded that with the new technique chronic peripheral artery occlusions can be reopened with a high success rate and without the danger of arterial wall perforation. The method can also be used in patients in whom conventional techniques have failed.\r"

Balloon flotation temporary pacemaker leads were placed in 193 (12%) of 1,609 patients undergoing diagnostic catheterization, 641 (65%) of 993 patients undergoing coronary angioplasty and 199 (100%) of 199 patients undergoing aortic or mitral valvuloplasty. There were no perforations or significant arrhythmic complications related to pacemaker placement in these 1,033 cases, and pacing was initiated promptly when required by withdrawal of the catheter tip into the right ventricle. Significant bradycardia or new conduction defects developed in 17 patients (1%) during diagnostic catheterization, 10 patients (1%) during angioplasty and 20 patients (10%) during valvuloplasty, but were severe enough to require initiation of temporary pacing in only 1 (0.06%), 4 (0.4%) and 5 (2.5%) patients, respectively. No patient undergoing diagnostic catheterization or angioplasty (but 5 patients undergoing valvuloplasty) required immediate pacing support to treat a life-threatening bradycardia. The total cost of prophylactic pacemakers was $103,300, with a cost per actual use of $19,300 for diagnostic cases, $16,025 for angioplasty and $3,980 for balloon valvuloplasty. These data suggest that prophylactic temporary pacing is not indicated during either diagnostic catheterization or coronary angioplasty, but should be used routinely during balloon valvuloplasty.\r"

However, computer-assisted analysis of dipyridamole-thallium-201 myocardial perfusion scanning demonstrated more homogeneous myocardial perfusion in idiopathic cardiomyopathy (mean perfusion defect 25 +/- 11 vs 6 +/- 6%, p less than 0.001) and successfully predicted the correct etiology of LV dysfunction in 20 of 22 (91%) patients.\r"

OV632 was demonstrated in 47 of 59 ovarian carcinomas, 11 of 20 uterine carcinomas, and only 7 of 111 nongynecologic tumors. With OV632 no reactivity was found in carcinomas of the breast or the gastrointestinal tract. Cytologic preparations of malignant effusions of patients with ovarian cancer showed reactivity with OC125 in 32 of 35 cases, and OV632 with positivity in 34 of 35 cases. Mesothelial cells in reactive effusions were OC125 positive in 16 of 20 cases but never showed positivity with OV632. The authors conclude that for histopathology a combination of OC125 and OV632 offers high sensitivity (0.86) and specificity (0.89) for ovarian cancer.

However, immunohistochemical and ultrastructural examinations of these neoplasms have been scarce. The authors examined immunohistochemically the immature neural elements in nine immature teratomas. Using modified peroxidase-antiperoxidase (PAP) immunoperoxidase (IP) techniques, they evaluated the immunoreactivity to glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), neuron-specific enolase (NSE), neurofilament (NF), chromogranin (CG), and vimentin (VM). All nine teratomas were immunoreactive for both GFAP and NSE, one was reactive for NF, and five (56%) were immunoreactive for vimentin. All cases were nonreactive for chromogranin. In addition, ultrastructural examination (electron microscopic [EM]) was performed on eight of these tumors. By EM examination, both astrocytes and oligodendroglia were identified in varying stages of development. Astrocytes often displayed abundant intermediate filaments. However, primitive undifferentiated cells were also found. Neuronal differentiation included long cell processes with tubules and filaments, vesicles, rare dense-core granules, and synapses. Ependymal differentiation (cilia, microvilli, prominent junctions) was observed in two cases. Pigmented retinal epithelium was seen in one tumor. No ambiguous (hybrid) cells were identified. Cellular interactions usually resembled the relationships found in normal adult brain tissue.\r"

  ".W": "The classification of acute leukemia is essential for proper therapy and may be based on morphologic, cytochemical, immunologic, or even ultrastructural studies. Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) is expressed in most patients with acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) and a minority of patients with acute nonlymphocytic leukemia (ANLL). Thirteen patients with ANLL and greater than 30% blasts positive for TdT were studied to establish the clinical, light microscopic, cytochemical, immunologic, and ultrastructural correlates of this phenomenon. Most patients demonstrated some morphologic and cytochemical features of monocytic differentiation. On cytochemical stains, nine had greater than 3% Sudan black-positive blasts. Diffuse alpha naphthyl acetate esterase (ANAE) staining of leukemic cells was present in nine cases, though extremely weak in seven. Blasts in ten patients did not express any other markers of lymphoid differentiation except TdT. However, two patient's immature cells bore CD10 common ALL antigen (CALLA) and CD19 (B4). Ultrastructural studies confirmed nonlymphoid differentiation in all ten patients studied, with a prominent monocytic component present in nine. In no case was a second population of lymphoblasts identified to account for TdT positivity. These patients responded poorly to conventional therapy for ANLL, with complete remissions in 3 of 13 (23%). With conventional therapy for ALL, complete remission was achieved in only two of nine (22%) patients. However, four of seven (57%) patients had a complete remission with high-dose cytosine arabinoside regimens. The authors' studies suggest that patients with TdT-positive ANLL represent a distinct subset that usually displays ultrastructural evidence for monocytic differentiation and is clinically significant in that these patients respond poorly to conventional therapy for both ALL and ANLL. Recognition of the monocytic lineage of these cases by light microscopic examination is difficult because they are often poorly differentiated morphologically and express only weak nonspecific esterase positivity.\r"

A platelet volume distribution width (PDW) greater than or equal to 10.5 was found in 50%, 21%, and 14% of the three groups, respectively (P = 0.01 between patients with ET and patients with RT; P = 0.02 between patients with RT and controls), reflecting an excess of extreme values at both ends of the distribution. Compared with controls, the increase in platelet number in patients with RT was about twofold throughout the platelet volume range, whereas ET was characterized by a fivefold increase in small platelets less than 7.5 fL and threefold increase in larger size platelets. Mean platelet volume (MPV) was significantly lower in patients with ET versus patients with RT and in patients with RT versus controls (mean +/- SD 7.5 +/- 1.2 vs. 8.8 +/- 0.1 and 10.2 +/- 1.8 fL, respectively, P less than 0.01). Rate of in vitro platelet aggregation greater than or equal to 50% was significantly lower in patients with ET versus patients with RT and in patients with RT versus controls (0%, 23%, and 45%, respectively, P less than 0.01). Aggregation rate was positively correlated with MPV (r = 0.54; P less than 0.0001). Aggregation rate in patients with ET was significantly lower (P = 0.01) than expected from their reduced MPV alone. Despite these group differences, the overlap of individual platelet characteristics between the three groups precludes their usefulness for diagnostic purposes.\r"

PG I values less than 30 micrograms/L were found in 92% of cases and PG I to PG II ratios less than 3.0 in 82% of cases. At least one of these two results was abnormal in 97% of all patients with pernicious anemia. In comparison, results of other blood tests used in the investigation of pernicious anemia were less often abnormal. Serum gastrin level exceeded 200 ng/L in 90% of patients with pernicious anemia and was second to pepsinogen abnormality in diagnostic sensitivity. Results for anti-intrinsic factor antibody were positive in 73% of cases and anti-parietal cell antibody in only 52%. Although its specificity is limited, the presence of low PG I level and/or low PG I-PG II ratio is currently the most sensitive serum indicator for pernicious anemia, and absence of both can be taken as a strong argument against the diagnosis. This highly sensitive test can be combined further with the highly specific serum anti-intrinsic factor antibody test for the presumptive diagnosis of pernicious anemia when definitive tests (the Schilling test or gastric analysis for intrinsic factor) cannot be done or results are inconclusive.\r"

The modifications included a commerical source for the AdoHcy hydrolase, adenosine labeled with either 14C or 3H, and separation of the AdoHcy by thin layer chromatography. The assay was sensitive to 25 pmol. Hcy levels in sera from 18 controls ranged from 6.9 to 12.1 mumol/L with a mean of 9.1 and a SD of 1.5 mumol/L. The total serum Hcy was increased in vitamin B12 and folate deficiency. The level was high in congenital defects of vitamin B12 metabolism, blocking the methylation of Hcy regardless of the serum vitamin B12 levels, but was normal in the absence of tissue deficiency even if the serum vitamin B12 levels were low. The procedure has been found practical in two years of use and requires only 0.1 mL of serum.\r"

The rapid identification of this organism may depend upon histologic diagnosis, because culture methods are complex and require a minimum of seven days in order to identify a negative specimen. The purpose of this study was to determine which stain used to identify this organism was the most cost-effective and easiest to perform and interpret on a routine basis. Sixty-one consecutive gastric antral biopsies were stained with hematoxylin and eosin, Giemsa, Brown-Brenn, and Warthin-Starry, with 23 of the cases stained by Brown-Hopps. Of the stains tested, the Wright-Giemsa was the easiest to perform. The organisms on the Wright-Giemsa showed a smooth, uniform purple color, whereas the Warthin-Starry gave the organism a granular appearance that at times could be confused for silver precipitate. Both the Wright-Giemsa and Brown-Hopps stain had the highest degree of identification of the organism (defined by percent positivity). The routine use of the Wright-Giemsa stain for identification of C. pylori in antral biopsies is recommended.\r"

Elevated leukocyte beta-glucocerebrosidase levels ruled out the diagnosis of classic Gaucher's disease.

Eight SCC specimens from six patients, including four with hypercalcemia, were examined by electron microscopy to determine if certain ultrastructural features were consistently present to be of diagnostic value and to assess histogenesis. Each tumor had epithelial features with frequent desmosome-like junctions and partial investment with basal lamina. The most consistent and prominent finding was abundant dilated rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER) forming large vesicles filled with homogeneous granular (proteinaceous) material of variable density. RER vesicles were identified in all six primary tumors and in both recurrent and metastatic lesions. Dense-core granules of neurosecretory type were absent. None showed immunohistochemical reactivity for parathyroid hormone. The ultrastructural features of SCC are sufficiently constant to be of diagnostic value in the differential diagnosis of ovarian neoplasms. Histogenesis remains obscure.\r"

The melanin in epithelial cells consisted only of mature melanosomes. Immunohistochemically, the stromal cells that contained melanin stained with S-100 protein. The evidence suggests that the pigmented cells in the prostatic stroma are melanocytes and the melanin in the glandular epithelium is a result of the transfer of pigment from the stromal melanocytes.\r"

They were not specific for sarcoidosis. Organisms could not be certainly identified in them. Their origin is discussed in relation to activated macrophages, calcium, and oxalate metabolism, and the role of calcium oxalate in granulomas is considered.

Philadelphia chromosome was absent in two cases studied. The bone marrow showed myeloid hyperplasia with increased monocytoid cells and blasts. Biopsy or postmortem material available in two cases revealed malignant infiltration of lymph nodes, liver, spleen, lungs, intestines, and skin. The neoplastic cells ranged from cells with irregular nuclei possessing nuclear grooves to large blastic cells with round to lobulated nuclei and prominent nucleoli. They showed weak staining for acid phosphatase and nonspecific esterase and exhibited the immunophenotype EBM11+KiM1+KiM6+KiM8+CD4+HLADR+ S-100 protein+. The neoplastic cells of JCML therefore share features of dendritic cells and mononuclear phagocytes.

A high level of agreement (85%) was noted between the biochemical assay and ERICA. The ERICA-processed slides showed minimal background staining and were easy to interpret. Compared with the biochemical assay, ERICA achieved a positive predictive value of 86% and a negative predictive value of 82%. In contrast, results from the polyclonal antiestradiol histologic technique did not correlate with biochemical results and showed positive and negative predictive values of 61% and 25%, respectively. The authors conclude that the ERICA technique should prove to be a valuable adjunct to traditional biochemical ER assays.\r"

Quadruplicate 100-microliters serum samples diluted 1:20 for ACA-IgG and 1:40 for ACA-IgM were incubated for two hours, after which alkaline phosphatase-conjugated antihuman IgG or IgM was added. A standard serum was used on each plate to provide reproducibility of the assay. Upper limits of normal for ACA-IgG and IgM were established by testing 161 sera from normal persons. Sixty-one selected patients with SLE were tested; and, from these results, categories of positivity were defined from negative to 4+. All screen-positive sera (greater than or equal to 1+) were assayed in a quantitative ELISA assay for ACAs, using multiple dilutions of the unknowns. These data were fit on a standard curve generated with dilutions of a reference serum on each plate using a computerized data reduction system based on the 2 Plus 2 model. The standard curves were compared with the international standards for IgG and IgM anticardiolipin. The ability to quantitate ACA concentrations allows better definition of positive sera, as well as the opportunity to accurately evaluate and follow this antibody in a variety of patient groups.\r"

The authors found no specific staining of the metaplastic or neoplastic cells for PSA and only focal single cell PAcP positivity in three cases of squamous metaplasia. All cases showed strong staining of surrounding normal glandular epithelium for both antigens. In all but one case, both the metaplastic and glandular epithelium had positive results for MAK 6 and CK-KES. EMA was expressed strongly in ten cases, was weak or variable in two, and had negative results in two cases of squamous metaplasia. In only four cases did the glandular epithelium have positive results for EMA. The remaining cases showed no staining. PSA and PAcP marking, therefore, may not be useful for separating atypical squamous metaplasia from well-differentiated squamous cell carcinoma or even primary prostatic from metastatic squamous cell carcinoma. These findings suggest that although prostatic glandular epithelial cells retain their ability to express some prostate-associated antigens, this ability is greatly reduced, lost, or not developed in cells that undergo metaplasia into squamous cells or that develop into squamous cell carcinoma.\r"

At endoscopic examination, two mucosal biopsies were taken from the gastric antrum and two from the fundus of each subject. One biopsy from each site was Gram's stained and cultured and the other submitted for H and E and WS. Fifty of the 112 subjects had positive results for CP by at least two of the tests (44.6%). Histologically, 48 (96%) of the CP-positive subjects showed the presence of gastritis. Of 55 subjects who had gastritis, 50 had CP (91%). If both sites in the stomach were taken into account, the sensitivity and specificity of Gram's staining in detecting CP were 92% and 100%, respectively. These results are comparable to H and E and WS and slightly better than culture. The diagnosis of CP can be made accurately, rapidly, and inexpensively by Gram's stained touch preparations of mucosal biopsies.\r"

Aliquots of blood plasma spun at either 1,800 X g (low speed [LS]) or 20,000 X g (high speed [HS]) were assayed by radioimmunoassay fresh and after storage at 4 degrees C or -26 degrees C. Storage at -26 degrees C increased mean beta-TG values of fresh or 4 degrees C stored LS samples from 0.78 to 1.94 nmol/L (28-70 ng/mL), whereas all HS mean values were +/- 0.51 nmol/L (between 18 and 19 ng/mL). The authors believe that in addition to the accepted precautions regarding blood sampling and handling, it is essential to stress that for accurate measurement of beta-TG in plasma, samples should be centrifuged at HS or, if this is not feasible, that they be assayed as soon as possible without prior freezing.\r"

  ".W": "Two divergent laboratory approaches to the measurement of lactate dehydrogenase (LD) isoenzymes (LDIs) were evaluated. Abnormal values for total creatine kinase (CK), CK-MB, total LD, and LDIs were greater than 250 U/L, greater than or equal to 5% total CK, greater than 180 U/L, and LD1/LD2 ratio greater than 1.0, respectively. The first approach, measuring LDI on all requests regardless of total LD activity, showed the following results: 161 LDI specimens, 63 CK-MB + (LD1 greater than LD2, 6; LD1/LD2 normal, 57); 98 CK-MB - (LD1 greater than LD2, 5, LD1/LD2 normal, 93). Medical chart review of the 98 CK-MB negative specimens, representing 44 patients, showed that in seven patients with acute myocardial infarction (MI), none would have been missed clinically even if LDIs had not been done, and in only one case did LDIs play a confirmatory role in a patient who persistently had CK-MB-negative results but who had a strong clinical suspicion of MI. None of the 42 patient specimens with normal total LD activity had an LD1 greater than LD2. The second approach, measuring LDIs only if requested, only if total CK was abnormal, only if results for CK-MB were negative, and only if total LD was abnormal, showed the following results: 71 LDI specimens were not done (46 with normal total LD, 25 CK-MB + specimens). Medical chart review of the 71 LDIs not determined, representing 38 patients, showed that none of the 14 patients with the final diagnosis of MI would have been clinically missed, even if LDI had not been done, and in only one instance did LDIs confirm the clinical suspicion of MI in a patient with previously negative results for CK-MB. The LDI protocol represented by the second approach has been shown to be an effective means of identifying those occasional patients who require this confirmatory test, in whom the CK-MB results are negative but in whom there is a strong clinical suspicion of MI.\r"

It is often impossible to determine by cytogenetic analysis if the marker chromosome has derived from the X or Y chromosome. The origin of these marker chromosomes was elucidated by the use of DNA probe (pDP34) for male-specific sequences of the Y chromosome. The presence of Y-specific fragments in the patient's DNA led to surgical exploration and the detection of a gonadoblastoma.\r"

At least six and probably eight of these ten families were noncompliant with appropriate monitoring technique. The main comparison group consisted of 211 patients for whom care with home cardiorespiratory monitors was initiated and continued. Bronchopulmonary dysplasia and severe, apparent life-threatening events were significantly increased in the subjects, as were the following characteristics: black race; lack of private medical insurance; unmarried mother; maternal age of less than 25 years; cigarette smoking by mother during pregnancy; and low Apgar scores. These diagnostic and demographic factors may be useful in predicting the infant at highest risk for sudden and unexpected death when a home monitor is prescribed. Noncompliance with proper monitoring technique patients; methods of educating parents of infants at high risk of sudden infant death syndrome with the necessity for compliance need to be developed.\r"

During 407 patient-years of follow-up (5.2 years per patient), these 78 children had 227 episodes of respiratory failure (2.9 episodes per patient). Fifty-three patients (68%) have had two or more of such episodes. Second episodes usually followed the initial episodes within two years, but some were delayed for over six years. Seven of the 78 children died, and two others have incurred hypoxic brain damage, compared with two deaths among 2892 children with asthma--seen at this hospital during that interval--but without a documented previous episode of respiratory failure. We conclude that children whose asthma has caused even one episode of respiratory failure constitute a special group of asthmatic patients, members of which are at high risk for repeated episodes of respiratory failure and its catastrophic complications. This recognition allows special attention to be focused on them in designing both clinical and research strategies.\r"

Thirty-seven patients (84%) with severe head trauma had a brain injury identified on CT scan. Six patients with severe head trauma had a Glasgow Coma Scale score of 12 or greater and an abnormal CT scan. All patients with mild or moderate head trauma had normal CT scans. Severe head trauma, as defined in this study, accurately identified all patients with abnormal CT scan findings. We conclude that a classification based on objective clinical findings accurately identifies the severity of head trauma. This is particularly important in evaluating patients with a Glasgow Coma Scale score of 12 or greater. A prospective study including larger numbers of patients is needed to further evaluate such a classification.\r"

Results indicated that immediately after injury, patients with CHI performed poorer than their counterparts on measures of intelligence, cognitive flexibility, memory (particularly verbal recall), and verbal fluency. Thus, the findings indicate that adolescents who sustain CHI experience pervasive cognitive deficits immediately after injury that potentially interfere with reentry into their home, school, and peer activities.\r"

The parents of 918 children (82% of an eligible birth cohort) completed a telephone interview to document injury histories. The occurrence of injury was then linked to previously obtained information characterizing early childhood. Several determinant associations were found for injuries seen by a physician and for those requiring treatment. Maternal factors (single, unemployed, smoking) were dominant in both instances. From these factors, logistic regression models were developed from which adjusted relative risk estimates were derived. The presence of all three maternal factors, as well as the absence of a younger sibling, increases the probability of an injury from 20% to over 60%. These findings may be used to assist in the development of preventive programs by targeting children at increased risk. They also provide a basis for further studies that will permit a better understanding of the causal mechanisms linking maternal factors to preschool injury.\r"

The study population included 580 sibships with one infant, 679 with two, and 410 with three or more. Hospital of birth medical records were abstracted on these children. Neonatal hyperbilirubinemia was defined as present if the recorded peak bilirubin level was greater than 205 mumol/L in the absence of hemolytic disease of the newborn. The risk of NHB in newborns who have one or more prior sibs with NHB was 3.1 times higher than that of newborns who have prior sibs without NHB (10.3% vs 3.6%). Simultaneous adjustment for risk factors for NHB, such as feeding patterns, year of birth, maternal obstetric events, and infant health variables, did not explain the excess risk of NHB in sibs. Moreover, the risk of severe NHB (peak bilirubin level, greater than 257 mumol/L) in newborns who have one or more prior sibs with severe NHB was 12.5 times higher than that of newborns who have prior sibs without severe NHB (10.5% vs 0.9%). Separate analyses in sibships where all sibs were breast-fed and in sibships where all sibs were bottle-fed gave similar results. These data clearly suggest the familial nature of NHB. The higher risk of recurrence of NHB in sibs does not seem to be due to known environmental risk factors for NHB.\r"

Fourteen of the 17 children developed seizures as neonates. Most of these children who developed seizures were neurologically abnormal as neonates, became seizure free and neurologically normal early in the first year of life, and their anticonvulsant therapies were discontinued. After a seizure-free period of one to eight years, three of the 14 patients again required anticonvulsant therapy for seizure control. Two of the 16 surviving children continue to be severely handicapped while 11 of the 16 are making apparently normal developmental progress. One of the two children presently attending school has cognitive deficits appropriate to the site affected by the original infarction. Most children with neonatally diagnosed strokes appear to have a good short-term outcome, but later onset of seizures and subsequent recognition of cognitive deficits may not be uncommon.\r"

All study patients received treatment prior to the development of high-frequency ventilator jet, oscillator, or interruption. The site and submucosal depth of airway involvement was variable. The most commonly affected anatomic site was the middle or thoracic trachea (56%). The common cause identified was severe ischemia to the airway mucosa and submucosa, occurring with profound birth asphyxia and/or shock.

In addition, length of stay declined for children hospitalized secondary to motor vehicle crashes. This study confirms the effectiveness of the child restraint law in Michigan, previously demonstrated by analyses of police records. Current hospital databases may be able to serve as one component for the implementation of comprehensive injury surveillance systems.\r"

  ".W": "Combined residency training in internal medicine and pediatrics has proliferated greatly in the last ten years. This survey of program directors (N = 55) of such residency programs reports their personal and professional demographic characteristics as well as their perceptions about aspects of combined training. The directors were more often affiliated with Internal medicine (33 directors [60%]), 47 (85%) were men, their mean age was 44 years, they had been out of medical school for a mean of 19 years, the mean time served as program director was 2.6 years, and 32 (58%) had completed a fellowship. The programs had existed for an average of 4.2 years, the mean entering class size was 2.8 persons, and the mean number of graduates per program was 4.2. We report directors' perceptions of why students choose combined training, why the programs have proliferated, and how these residents differ from family medicine residents. We comment on curriculum design and the goals of combined internal medicine-pediatrics residency training programs.\r"

  ".W": "Very-low-birth-weight (VLBW) infants are at high risk of mortality, morbidity, and rehospitalization in the first years of life, but little information is available to predict which VLBW infants are likely to require rehospitalization. This study describes a sample of 79 VLBW infants cared for in a charity hospital. The sample was predominantly black, and the majority of the mothers were young and unmarried. Some of the infants were followed up by a multidisciplinary High-Risk Follow-up Clinic, and all were tracked until their second birthdays to determine the rate of rehospitalization. Using multiple regression, we present herein a model that accounts for 51% of the variance in rehospitalization; the model includes mother's age, education, and marital status; infant birth weight and gestational age; the use of prenatal care and the High-Risk Follow-up Clinic; and three quadratic terms. Although the significance of the quadratic factors in the model makes explanation of these results difficult, results suggest that the model can be used to predict whether infants will require rehospitalization in the first two years of life.\r"

  ".W": "To determine attitudes toward body weight and shape and eating and weight control practices among adolescent girls, an anonymous questionnaire was administered to 854 adolescent girls and young women aged 12 through 23 years who were seen in a military adolescent outpatient clinic. Overall, 67% were dissatisfied with their weight, and 54% were dissatisfied with their body shape. Dissatisfaction with weight and shape varied positively with increasing body weight but not with increasing age. Binge eating had occurred in 30.4%, and weight control behavior, such as dieting, fasting, vomiting, and stimulant, laxative, and diuretic use, had occurred in 38.2%, 30.7%, 8.5%, 9.5%, 3.3%, and 6.2%, respectively, varying positively with increasing weight. Thirty-six percent of those adolescent girls who saw themselves as overweight desired an inappropriate weight loss, and 61% of these, who desired an excessive loss, exhibited an increased prevalence of weight control behaviors and were less likely to believe that they had an eating problem. Dissatisfaction with body weight and shape, and eating behaviors, such as dieting, binge eating, fasting, and vomiting, are common in adolescent girls, many of whom are attempting weight control without an accurate perception of what is normal.\r"

Of 98 patients who underwent antral biopsy (the most reliably colonized site in the stomach), 40 had chronic gastritis histologically. Of those 40 patients, 22 (55%) had CP present on the gastric surface. None of the 58 patients without gastritis present in biopsy specimens had CP. The gastritis in children with CP was more severe than in those without the organism: 86% of those with moderate gastritis and 92% of those with severe gastritis had CP. Eight patients with duodenal ulcers and one patient with a gastric ulcer had CP on biopsy. Among those patients without CP, only one had a duodenal ulcer and eight had gastric ulcers. An additional nine patients found to have CP on gastric fundic biopsy were identified, for a total of 31 patients with CP identified by either antral (22) or fundic (nine) biopsy. Initial resolution of symptoms with standard acid-antagonist therapy was noted in the 25 of 31 CP(+) patients so treated, but a high relapse rate was noted within one to two years in the patients who also had gastritis and duodenal ulcer. These findings support a strong association between CP colonization of the stomach and the presence of chronic gastritis and duodenal ulcer disease in children.\r"

However, despite the high prevalence of psychiatric disorders, there is no psychosocial screening procedure available. We present the Pediatric Symptom Checklist (PSC), a one-page, 35-item, parent-completed questionnaire that screens school-age children for psychosocial dysfunction. The PSC is administered in the waiting room and can be completed and scored in under five minutes. The PSC is not diagnostic of specific psychiatric disorders but is designed to help the pediatrician select which children may benefit from further clinical evaluation.\r"

In 37 patients (97%), an underlying condition was identified that was considered a predisposing factor for polymicrobial bacteremia--18 patients (42%) had lesions of the gastrointestinal tract, 13 patients (34%) had an indwelling central venous catheter, nine patients (24%) had a malignant neoplasm or were receiving chemotherapy, and nine patients (24%) had neutropenia. A total of 98 pathogenic organisms were isolated; 52 were gram-negative and 46 were gram-positive, and 18 patients (47%) had more than two organisms isolated. Polymicrobial bacteremia was usually clinically indistinguishable from monomicrobial septicemia. Overall mortality was 32%. Polymicrobial bacteremia continues to be a rare, but serious, infectious disease that usually affects children with underlying medical problems and is associated with a high rate of mortality.\r"

We prospectively identified 119 episodes of neutropenia in 87 infants (6% of admissions). Less than half of the episodes could be attributed to infections. The majority of noninfectious neutropenia episodes were related to specific perinatal events or were of unknown cause. Infants weighing less than 2500 g were more likely to have neutropenia than term infants (13% vs 3%, respectively) and less likely to have neutropenia related to bacterial infections. Short-term survival (89% vs 95%) and long-term survival (74% vs 77%) were not different in infants with infectious diseases compared with those with noninfectious diseases. Mortality was highly correlated with the need for assisted ventilation (20%) or with an absolute neutrophil count of 0.5 x 10(9)/L (24%). We conclude that the cause of neutropenia and the clinical condition must be carefully evaluated before instituting aggressive therapy for infection.\r"

In patients with CRMO, lymphocyte subpopulations, the responses to mitogens, and the chemotactic and chemokinetic responses showed no consistent abnormalities. After a mean follow-up of 4.5 years (range, one to ten years), all four patients with osteomyelitis of Garre were symptomatic, and two had complications. Only two of the eight patients with CRMO had active disease. The course had been complicated by growth disturbances in one patient and by thoracic outlet syndrome in another.
