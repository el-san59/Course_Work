For slide centrifuge Gram staining, each urine sample was mixed well. Thereafter, 0.2 mL of each sample was placed, using a pipette, into a slide centrifuge chamber and centrifuged at 2,000 rpm for 5 minutes. The slides were heat fixed, Gram stained, and read by laboratory personnel who scanned 12 consecutive oil-immersion fields using a set pattern. The presence of the same organism in six or more fields was defined as a positive urine screen. Urine samples were cultured using a 0.001-mL loop and a comparison of culture growth with slide centrifuge screening was made. When growth of 100,000 or more colony-forming units per milliliter (CFU/mL) was the reference for comparison, the screen had a sensitivity rate of 98%, a specificity rate of 90%, a negative predictive value of 99%, and a positive predictive value of 65%. When a lower colony count of 10,000 or more CFU/mL was the reference for comparison, the screen had a sensitivity rate of 88%, a specificity rate of 95%, a negative predictive value of 96%, and a positive predictive value of 84%. The slide centrifuge Gram stain is a very sensitive screening method to detect bacteriuria in an adult male population.\r"

Identification data obtained with these systems were compared with those indicated by conventional biochemical procedures. API, Baxter MicroScan, BBL, IDS, and Vitek corresponded with conventional biochemical identification in 74%, 66%, 65%, 50%, and 61% of the isolates, respectively; using recommended supplemental tests, agreement was augmented in 9%, 11%, 20%, 11%, and 21% of the isolates, respectively. Disagreement with conventional biochemical methods occurred in 14%, 17%, 14%, 32%, and 10% of the commercial techniques, respectively; no identification was possible in 2%, 5%, fewer than 1%, 6%, and 8% of specimens, respectively. BBL, API, and Baxter MicroScan systems provided the most reliable rapid identification, although supplemental testing often was required. Until a higher percentage of correct identification data can be obtained without supplemental procedures, conventional biochemical techniques will remain the methods of choice for identification of viridans streptococci.\r"

In evaluating the electrophoretic LD isoenzyme patterns of these patients, three criteria were used. In criterion-1 elevations, the LD-3/total LD ratio, expressed as a fraction of serum total LD, and LD-3 value, expressed in absolute units, were greater than the upper limit of the reference range. In criterion-2 elevations, only the LD-3/total LD ratio was greater than the upper limit of the reference range. In criterion-3 elevations, only the absolute LD-3 activity exceeded the upper limit of the reference range, and these specimens showed isomorphic elevation of all five LD isoenzymes. Use of the last of these criteria increased the clinical sensitivity of serum LD-3 elevations in active CGL from 82% to 92%. The mean serum LD-3 absolute value and serum total LD activity usually showed statistically significant differences (P less than 0.05) among patients with active CGL, those in partial remission, and those in complete remission, but did not distinguish between subgroups of individuals with active CGL. Elevation of the serum LD-5/total LD ratio in 16 of 58 patients was due to hepatic injury or methodologic imprecision, showing analytically insignificant, borderline abnormalities in all cases of active CGL. In 10 of 62 patients in complete remission or partial remission, however, such elevation was unexplained. Our results indicate that the evaluation of serum LD-3 values in both absolute and relative terms slightly increases the clinical sensitivity of LD-3, and, therefore, suggest that LD-3 might be a useful marker for CGL.\r"

  ".W": "Partially purified high-molecular-weight alkaline phosphatase from serum was compared with two other forms of the enzyme from the human liver, enzyme in native plasma membranes and purified alkaline phosphatase as a hydrophilic dimer. In a high-molecular-weight form from serum and plasma membranes, and when treated with 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, alkaline phosphatase showed a major band on gradient gel electrophoresis with a mobility equivalent to 400 kD. Nondetergent-treated material from both sources did not enter the gel and was in the voided volume of a gel permeation column. Stimulation of catalytic activity by four different phospholipids and by albumin yielded similar results for high-molecular-weight alkaline phosphatase and for the enzyme in plasma membranes, but these were different from the hydrophilic form. Inhibitors of alkaline phosphatase had similar effects on all forms. Of the three forms of the enzyme, only the hydrophilic dimer did not become incorporated into liposomes or adsorb to octyl-Sepharose after solubilization with Triton X-100 and removal of the detergent. Km (substrate concentration to give half maximal velocity) values with p-nitrophenylphosphate and heat and sodium dodecyl sulfate stabilities were similar for all forms. In the high-molecular-weight form from serum and in plasma membranes, alkaline phosphatase and 5'-nucleotidase showed similar rates of release by phosphatidylinositol phospholipase C. Three preparations of phospholipase D failed to release alkaline phosphatase from either the high-molecular-weight form or from plasma membranes. Based on these similarities, it is probable that the complex of high-molecular-weight alkaline phosphatase in serum most often originates from fragments of hepatic plasma membranes.\r"

  ".W": "To assess the efficacy of performing genotyping in addition to immunophenotyping as an adjunct to cytologic diagnosis, 63 consecutive patients with fine-needle aspirates of lymphoproliferative lesions who had concurrent immunophenotyping and genotyping performed on fine-needle aspirate cell suspensions were studied. Thirty-nine of 63 specimens (62%) that appeared to contain non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and that proved to be of B-cell lineage by genotyping were accurately phenotyped and shown to be monotypic for immunoglobulin light chains by cell suspension immunocytochemistry. Genotyping facilitated lineage assignment and/or confirmed clonality in 17 of 63 specimens (27%) that were difficult to determine based on morphologic data. These include cases of atypical lymphoid proliferations with polyclonal or inconclusive markers (n = 6), peripheral T-cell lymphoma (n = 3), extracutaneous mycosis fungoides (n = 1), lymphoblastic lymphoma (n = 4), null cell lymphoma (n = 1), and specimens with equivocal or technically unsatisfactory markers (n = 2). Based on these results, it is proposed that genotyping for lineage assignment and/or clonality be performed to include cases of atypical lymphoid proliferations, T-cell malignant neoplasms, lymphoid malignant neoplasms with equivocal markers, and differentiation of lymphoid from nonlymphoid neoplasms. Genotyping by antigen-receptor gene rearrangement appears to be redundant in cases with mature B-cell phenotypes that demonstrate monoclonality by immunophenotyping.\r"

The mass in the spleen measured 12.7 cm in greatest dimension. The second case was of a 46-year-old woman with a palpable, left upper quadrant mass. A computed tomography scan revealed a splenic mass and the spleen was removed. The mass measured 12 cm in greatest dimension. In a review of the literature, 13 examples of splenic inflammatory pseudotumor were reported. The age range was 19 to 75 years, with a median age of 50 years. The splenic lesions were either discovered incidentally or manifested by left upper quadrant discomfort and/or mass. Inflammatory pseudotumor of the spleen, although rare, is being increasingly recognized and should be considered in the differential diagnosis of mass lesions of the spleen.\r"

Many findings in these patients are identical to those with immune thrombocytopenic purpura. However, recent findings in acquired immune deficiency syndrome patients including the effect of zidovudine on platelet count and the demonstration of ultrastructural changes and viral RNA in megakaryocytes, have suggested that the human immunodeficiency virus may directly infect megakaryocytes, and play a role in acquired immune deficiency syndrome-related thrombocytopenia. To investigate further the mechanism of decreased platelet counts in human immunodeficiency virus-infected patients, the platelet volume-number relationship and corresponding bone marrow findings in 34 patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus were studied. Parameters evaluated included platelet count and mean platelet volume; bone marrow cellularity, megakaryocyte number, and number and percentage of denuded megakaryocyte nuclei. Two thirds of the platelet counts were low, and of these 92% had an inappropriately low mean platelet volume. These individuals had a platelet-volume number relationship that is very similar to that seen in myelosuppressive disorders. In addition, more than 90% of the bone marrows from thrombocytopenic patients had either normal or decreased numbers of megakaryocytes. These observations provide additional evidence to support the hypothesis that the pathophysiology of human immunodeficiency virus-associated thrombocytopenia may be due, at least in part, to a direct effect on the megakaryocytes.\r"

These indices of platelet function were correlated with plasma total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), and triglyceride (TG) concentrations. When compared with controls, intraplatelet 5-HT was significantly reduced in all patient groups studied and beta-TG was diminished in all patient groups except CAPD. Total platelet TXA2 synthesizing capacity was increased in ESRF and HD groups. Intraplatelet histamine content was not altered in any of the patient groups studied. There was a significant inverse correlation between intraplatelet 5-HT content on the one hand and plasma TC, LDL-C, and TG on the other. The depletion of intraplatelet 5-HT and beta-TG and the increase in total TXA2 synthesizing capacity are consistent with platelet activation in chronic renal disease. The correlation between these indices of platelet activation and TC, LDL-C, HDL-C, and TG suggests that changes in the concentrations of these lipids may contribute to the activation of platelets in these conditions.\r"

A method for its determination that is practical, accurate, and reproducible is still being sought. In this comparative study of techniques, TPF values were determined in mirror-image samples of 126 consecutive solid malignant neoplasms using flow cytometry and immunostaining with Ki-67, a monoclonal antibody that recognizes an unknown nuclear antigen expressed during the entire cell proliferation cycle but not in resting cells. The mean TPF values for all cases were 19.5 +/- 15.6% (percentage of tumor cells stained) by Ki-67 (range, 1-86%) and 15.7 +/- 9.6% (S + G2M) by flow cytometry (range, 3-60%), which correlated significantly at r = 0.53 and P = 0.005. The correlation was less strong in tumors with low S-phase values (less than or equal to 10%, r = 0.28) than in tumors with intermediate and high S-phase values (r = 0.66). Ki-67 staining percentages did not correlate with patient age, sex, or tissue origin of the tumor. Ki-67 staining appears comparable to flow cytometry determination of TPF in solid malignancies with intermediate and high S-phase values. In tumors with low S-phase values, Ki-67 immunostaining shows higher TPF values, which perhaps reflect an increase in the proportion of G1-phase cells or dilutional effect of nonneoplastic cells in the tumors with low proliferative fraction.\r"

In three cases examined ultrastructurally, GCFs correlated with many cytoplasmic polyribosomes and abundant rough endoplasmic reticulum, but Golgi complexes and tonofilaments were scant and intracytoplasmic lumina were absent. Intracellular mucin was present in the areas showing GCFs of four ADSQs with predominant GCFs and six ADSQs with focal GCFs. Two of three cases examined ultrastructurally showed intracellular electron-dense material that corresponded to mucin secretory material. Immunohistochemical studies of the six ADSQs with predominant GCF cases showed the following pattern of reactivity: monoclonal carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), 2 of 6 cases; polyclonal CEA, 3 of 6; CA 125, 0 of 6; CA 19-9, 0 of 6; placental alkaline phosphatase, 0 of 6; and vimentin, 1 of 6. Focal GCF areas showed monoclonal CEA, 4 of 9 cases; polyclonal CEA, 3 of 9; vimentin, 4 of 9; while CA 125, CA 19-9, and placental alkaline phosphatase were negative in areas of GCFs. One of three patients with ADSQ with predominant GCFs and five of nine patients with ADSQ with focal GCFs with at least 1 year of follow-up were disease free. No association between GCFs (combined focal and predominant) and recurrent disease was present when compared to the other 29 AC and ADSQ patients with follow-up. Recurrent disease in our series of AC and ADSQ was only associated with stage III or IV disease at presentation (P less than 0.001). There was no association with adenosquamous histology, histologic grade, lymphatic invasion, or age. There were insufficient cases of ADSQ with predominant GCFs with follow-up to evaluate fully prognostic significance of this subgroup. Our study suggests that GCFs are part of the spectrum of differentiation in ADSQ of the cervix rather than a distinct histologic type of carcinoma with unique clinical significance.\r"

However, two mesenchymal proliferations of lung, lymphangioleiomyomatosis and epithelioid hemangioendothelioma (EHE), and one epithelial tumor, sclerosing hemangioma (SH), have a significant female predilection and may benefit from such hormonal therapy. The authors investigated five cases each of EHE and lymphangioleiomyomatosis and four cases of SH for expression of estrogen and progesterone receptors and 17-beta estradiol in paraffin-embedded tissue. Only one case each of lymphangioleiomyomatosis and EHE expressed 17-beta estradiol. All of the other cases were negative. These findings are contrary to the viewpoint held in published literature, especially in case reports of lymphangioleiomyomatosis, describing patients with positive estrogen and progesterone receptor results. Consequently, a number of issues must be considered in the clinical and immunohistochemical evaluation of the estrogen and progesterone receptor status of these rare pulmonary neoplasms.\r"

Infection by HPV 6 or 11 was associated with a simultaneous normal Papanicolaou smear in 4 of 29 (14%) cases. This result was significantly greater (P less than 0.05) than that found in cases of infection by an oncogenic HPV type (types 16, 31, 33, 35, and others), in which the rate of a concurrent normal Papanicolaou smear was 5 of 88 (5%). Infection by one of these oncogenic types was associated with a Papanicolaou smear diagnostic of SIL in 55 of 88 (63%) cases, whereas infection by HPV 6 or 11 was associated with a Papanicolaou smear diagnostic of SIL significantly (P less than 0.05) less frequently (6 of 29, 18%). It is concluded that, for women with SILs, the likelihood of a Papanicolaou smear diagnostic of the lesion is greater for women with HPV types of known oncogenic potential.\r"

  ".W": "PURPOSE: The most prevalent serious drug toxicity in the United States is increasingly recognized as gastrointestinal (GI) pathology associated with the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). The incidence of serious GI events (hospitalization or death) associated with NSAID use was therefore prospectively analyzed in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and patients with osteoarthritis. PATIENTS, METHODS, AND RESULTS: The study consisted of 2,747 patients with RA and 1,091 patients with osteoarthritis. The yearly hospitalization incidence during NSAID treatment was 1.58% in RA patients and was similar in all five populations studied. The hazard ratio of patients taking NSAIDs to those not taking NSAIDs was 5.2. The incidence in osteoarthritis may be less. The risk of GI-related death in RA patients was 0.19% per year with NSAIDs. Multivariate analyses assessing risk factors for serious GI events were performed in the 1,694 (98 with an event) RA patients taking NSAIDs at the predictive visit. The main risk factors were higher age, use of prednisone, previous NSAID GI side effects, prior GI hospitalization, level of disability, and NSAID dose. A rule is presented that allows estimation of the risk for the individual patient with RA. CONCLUSION: Knowledge of the risk factors for NSAID-associated gastropathy and their inter-relationships provides a tool for identification of the patient at high risk and for initiation of appropriate therapeutic action.\r"

PATIENTS AND METHODS: The incidence of upper gastrointestinal tract bleeding was assessed in a cohort of 19,880 patients from the Michigan Medicaid billing database with dermatitis and/or asthma treated with corticosteroids during 1980 to 1984. The frequency of upper gastrointestinal bleeding was assessed within 60 days after each corticosteroid prescription. RESULTS: The incidence of upper gastrointestinal bleeding in patients without a past history of upper gastrointestinal bleeding who were exposed to corticosteroids was only 2.8 cases per 10,000 person-months. The rate of upper gastrointestinal bleeding was notably higher in patients receiving anticoagulants and those with a prior history of upper gastrointestinal bleeding (23.0 and 15.9 cases per 10,000 person-months, respectively). CONCLUSION: Because the incidence of upper gastrointestinal bleeding in ambulatory patients treated with corticosteroids is so low, prophylactic therapy should be restricted to high-risk patients, if it is to be used at all.\r"

PATIENTS AND METHODS: All anemic patients with progressive renal failure (12 predialysis and seven home peritoneal dialysis) in whom subcutaneous rHuEPO therapy was begun at, or was reduced to, a weekly dose were studied retrospectively. Patients were not selected for, nor excluded from, these observations for any other reason. Hematocrit and endogenous creatinine clearance were monitored regularly, and no other new treatment for anemia was given except oral iron. Iron-deficiency anemia was considered improbable because of normal red blood cell mean corpuscular volume. Unfortunately, iron parameters were not monitored. RESULTS: The hematocrit increased 4 to 9 percentage points in 4 to 13 weeks in all but two patients who were initially treated with weekly doses, and a hematocrit of 31% was achieved in these patients within 6 to 12 weeks. The mean effective dose to accomplish this was 150 U/kg. All but three patients could be maintained on weekly doses at a hematocrit of 31% or higher. The mean effective dose was 75 U/kg. CONCLUSION: It is concluded that subcutaneous rHuEPO administered weekly can correct the anemia of predialysis and peritoneal dialysis patients. Weekly dosing is more convenient for patients and may be less costly for Medicare providers.\r"

  ".W": "STUDY OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy and side effects of niacin therapy in dyslipidemic individuals. DESIGN: A retrospective analysis of patients' charts. SETTING: An outpatient referral-based clinic specializing in the treatment of lipid disorders. PATIENTS: All patients with dyslipidemia treated by niacin (n = 82) at the Atherosclerosis Detection and Prevention Clinic during 1987 to 1990, including a subgroup of 17 dyslipidemic heart transplant recipients. RESULTS: Niacin was well tolerated in 83% of the nontransplant group (n = 65) at an average dose of 2.5 +/- 0.9 g/day. Similar beneficial lipoprotein effects were found in the transplant and nontransplant patients. The high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) response to niacin therapy was independent of the baseline (HDL-C level. In the transplant group, 11 patients (65%) discontinued treatment, primarily because of hyperglycemia; this was especially prominent in those patients with pretreatment diabetes mellitus. Of the 15 patients using sustained-release niacin, eight cases of hepatitis were recorded, some during therapy with relatively low niacin doses. Several different sustained-release preparations were responsible for this phenomenon, suggesting that the cause was not a contaminant in the preparation. No cases of hepatitis were documented in the 67 patients using regular niacin. One case of hepatitis was recently observed in a patient who switched from one type to regular niacin to another; however, we have data to suggest that the substituted preparation was not an immediate-release niacin. A familial predisposition to hepatitis is suggested by the occurrence of this side effect in identical twin brothers and two sisters. A pharmacy survey disclosed that most pharmacists are unaware of the relationship of sustained-release niacin to hepatitis, have a negative impression of regular niacin, and do not stock this formulation. Finally, we found that in this small sample of patients, niacin used with lovastatin is a particularly effective drug combination and appears to have few side effects beyond those seen with niacin alone. CONCLUSIONS: Our experience supports the fact that regular niacin is a useful lipid-modifying drug. When used appropriately, patients can usually tolerate adequate doses for prolonged periods and achieve meaningful results. However, this requires a certain amount of physician skill and patient motivation. The use of sustained-release preparations to overcome this problem can lead to harmful consequences and should only be done under strict medical supervision. In our opinion, the availability of sustained-release niacin as a nonprescription drug is unjustified and should be reexamined. Finally, we have observed that reduction of very-low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (VLDL-C) with niacin alone leads to an elevation in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol in many patients; this indicates to us that the mechanism whereby niacin lowers VLDL-C and total cholesterol is not solely the result of a decreased synthesis of VLDL-C.\r"

  ".W": "PURPOSE: To ascertain whether the diagonal earlobe crease (ELC) is associated prospectively with future death or cardiac events over 8 years of follow-up in two sets of patients: those with known coronary artery disease (CAD) and those without evidence for CAD. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We performed a prospective, observational study of 108 patients in four cohorts (each matched for age, sex, and race, but differing in the presence or absence of both a diagonal ELC and CAD in 1979 to 1982). Follow-up information was gathered by telephone interviews, and dates and causes of death were determined by reference to death certificates (n = 48), hospital records (n = 9), or attending physician statements (n = 1). RESULTS: During 8 to 10 years of follow-up, 58 of the patients had died. Patients with ELCs had poorer survival rates than those without creases, by stratified log-rank test (p = 0.006 for the cohorts thought not to have CAD, and p = 0.058 for those with CAD). Cardiac death rates (due to acute myocardial infarction, \"sudden cardiac death,\" or heart failure) were also higher for patients with ELCs: 8.0 versus 0.9 cardiac deaths per 100 patient-years (p less than 0.001) in patients without CAD at entry, and 11.7 versus 3.7 cardiac deaths per 100 patient-years (p = 0.008) in patients with CAD in 1979 to 1982. Cardiac event rates (cardiac death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or coronary artery bypass surgery) were also higher in those with ELCs: 10.4 versus 1.4 events per 100 patient-years (p less than 0.001) for those without known CAD, and 15.8 versus 5.7 events per 100 patient-years (p = 0.009) for those with CAD. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that a diagonal ELC is associated with increased all-cause and cardiac morbidity and mortality. Patients with ELCs may be at higher risk for coronary events, and might be especially cautioned to control or reduce other cardiac risk factors, even if currently without diagnostic evidence of CAD.\r"

  ".W": "PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to compare the decision-making and preferences regarding do-not-resuscitate (DNR) orders of a group of family physicians with a group of out-patients from a family practice center. Complete results of the outpatient questionnaire were published in a previous study by the authors. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: A random sample of 202 members of the Michigan Academy of Family Practice and all 32 members of the University of Michigan Department of Family Practice were surveyed by a mailed questionnaire. The questionnaire was divided into five parts: demographics, past experiences with DNR orders, who should be involved in DNR decision-making, values clarification, and a series of scenarios matched by a variety of biomedical and non-biomedical factors. RESULTS: After eliminating physicians who had left no forwarding address or who had retired or died, the overall response rate was 61.8%. Most physicians (97%) had at some time written a DNR order for one of their patients; discussions most commonly took place in the hospital room. Physicians, like patients, thought that in addition to the patient, DNR decisions should involve the spouse, the physician, and the patient's children, respectively. Value clarification revealed that both groups most highly value \"being able to think clearly\" and \"being treated with dignity.\" The presence of a number of quality-of-life issues (age, drug or alcohol use, wheelchair use, dementia, and severe pain) in a series of scenarios negatively affected the decision of both family physicians and patients to resuscitate. CONCLUSION: There are significant similarities and differences in the way physicians and patients make DNR decisions. It is important that physicians and their patients communicate in a timely manner about prognosis, values, and quality-of-life issues in order to make effective DNR decisions.\r"

  ".U": "91368809\r", 
  ".W": "PURPOSE: This multicenter study was designed to compare an exclusively oral regimen with \"usual care\" in patients hospitalized with acute bacterial pneumonia. PATIENTS AND METHODS: One hundred forty-seven patients were enrolled. All patients presented with a clinical picture consistent with pneumonia: (1) clinical symptoms of a lower respiratory tract infection, such as chest pain, cough, and production of purulent sputum; (2) roentgenographic infiltrate compatible with acute infection; and (3) Gram's stain of purulent sputum or other appropriate bronchopulmonary specimen containing gram-negative organisms, staphylococci, or pneumococci. All patients required hospitalization. The design was a parallel-group, open-label study with randomization in blocks of four. Ofloxacin, a new fluoroquinolone antimicrobial agent, was administered orally or by nasogastric tube, 400 mg every 12 hours. This was compared with the individual investigator's best selection of therapy that was administered parenterally, at least initially. RESULTS: One hundred thirty-three patients were evaluable after exclusions for deviation from protocol, early death due to unrelated causes, incorrect diagnosis, or early adverse drug reactions. All 69 patients treated with ofloxacin and 61 of 64 control patients had favorable clinical and microbiologic responses. There were no statistically significant differences between the groups in terms of demographics, therapeutic outcome, and duration of therapy. There were few side effects overall and rates were similar for the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: An exclusively oral regimen, in this case ofloxacin, may be substituted for parenteral therapy in selected patients with pneumonia. This might significantly reduce costs and risks to the patient.\r"

Whereas most attention of clinicians is presently focused on optimizing the antifungal regimen, so as to improve on high failure rates in cryptococcal meningitis in AIDS, little attention has been paid to the problem of intracranial hypertension. We argue that visual loss and some of the cases of death early after the onset of chemotherapy may be related to high cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pressure, regardless of antifungal therapy. The possible pathophysiologic mechanisms are discussed, and we postulate that the mechanism is reduced CSF outflow possibly due to increased outflow resistance, not necessarily accompanied by prominent cerebral edema. Optimal therapy of this complication is not yet established, but some measures that may be helpful are ventricular shunting, frequent high-volume lumbar punctures, and possibly glucocorticoids.\r"

Aspirin and ticlopidine are two antiplatelet drugs that reduce the risk of recurrent stroke by 25% to 30%. In some stroke prevention trials, aspirin has been shown to be more effective for men than for women. In contrast, major stroke prevention trials using ticlopidine have demonstrated equal benefit in women and in men. The overall incidence of adverse effects seen with ticlopidine is not significantly different from that observed with aspirin.

As new tables are produced, only through better understanding of the anatomy of early embryos can we realize what we are actually seeing and measuring (or at least attempting to measure). Furthermore, as we try to correlate early embryonic size with gestational age, we realize that the crown-rump measurement is not applicable in principle or in nomenclature when the embryo is less than 18 mm long. When first seen, the embryo is relatively straight; a measurement of its size is best described as \"greatest length.\" As the embryo curves into a C-shaped, tadpolelike structure, the greatest measurement along the long axis is actually a neck-rump measurement. Further unfolding of the head and regression of the tail finally allow an accurate crown-rump measurement (at about 18 mm) as we have used it for almost two decades. Early embryonic stages and characteristics are reviewed and methods of measurement of early embryonic size are explained.\r"

Data from the United States on ovarian cancer incidence and survival were used to estimate the potential benefit on ovarian cancer mortality from screening tests of various sensitivities. A test with 80% sensitivity could reduce ovarian cancer mortality by 50% if all screening-detected cases were to experience current stage I survival rates; the benefit would be greatest among women aged 45 or older. For each cancer detected there would be at least 50 false-positive screening tests unless test specificity is greater than 98%. If our most optimistic assumptions about screening could be met, then universal periodic screening of women aged 45 to 74 would result in about 5000 additional 5-year survivors of ovarian cancer annually. Uptake of existing screening tests is far less than universal; thus we would expect the impact of any ovarian cancer screening program to fall short of these projections.\r"

Identification and treatment of pregnant women with these risk factors require obtaining complete and accurate psychosocial histories. The purpose of this study was to determine whether a computer interview developed by our staff is appropriate for assessing behavioral risk factors for adverse pregnancy outcomes and for educating pregnant women about healthy behaviors during pregnancy. This computer interview asks about pregnant patients' perceived life stressors, diet, use of cigarettes and alcohol, and abuse of drugs. The study population consisted of 201 medically insured Hispanic and non-Hispanic white women attending a health maintenance organization--based prenatal clinic. Almost all subjects rated the computer interview favorably. Medical record reviews were conducted to compare participants' reports of cigarette, alcohol, and drug use obtained from paper-and-pencil interviews with behaviors reported during the computer interview. Although self-reported rates of smoking did not differ between the two interview techniques, a much higher percentage of women reported alcohol and drug use during the computer interview. Study participants scored significantly higher on a test measuring knowledge of the effects of stress, diet, and substances of abuse on pregnancy than did a control group. Results demonstrated the potential value of computer-interactive software programs for assessing high-risk behaviors among pregnant women in this population and educating them about healthy behaviors during pregnancy.\r"

Between 1983 and 1987, 78 pregnancies were identified in which at least one record of the fetal heart rate had very low long-term variation. The outcome was analyzed to determine the numeric criteria of fetal heart rate variation that most efficiently detect a fetus that will die (preterminal) or is dying (terminal). Because fetal compromise was found on occasion to be associated with a slow sinusoidal fetal heart rate rhythm that increased measures of long-term variation. It was necessary to define a new index of short-term fetal heart rate variation (the 1/16 minute epoch-epoch variation). This was closely related to long-term variation (r = 0.9) but provided better detection of preterminal records as judged by metabolic acidemia at delivery or intrauterine death.\r"

The maturation process was repeated every 48 hours. Forty-nine patients were delivered of infants after the first maturation and 51 patients required between two and nine instillations. In patients requiring multiple instillations, the mean delay between the first procedure and delivery was 9 +/- 4 days (range, 2.4 to 16 days). Among the 59 nulliparous women, only 23 were delivered of infants after a single maturation and 36 required multiple maturations (p less than 0.02). When the group of patients who were delivered of infants after a single maturation process was compared with the group requiring multiple maturations, no difference could be seen with regard to age, term of pregnancy, or Bishop cervical score at the time of inclusion in the study. The myometrial activity and the onset labor induced by prostaglandin E2, were similar in both groups. Fetal heart rate decelerations occurred in 16.3% (8/49) of the patients with single maturations and in 17.6% (9/51) of the patients who required multiple maturations. The outcome of the pregnancy and the rate of cesarean sections (24% and 27%) were similar in both groups. No patients required cesarean sections because of failed induction of labor. Cervical ripening after repeated applications of 0.25 mg of prostaglandin E2 seems to be safe for the fetus, providing that the patient is closely supervised.\r"

The clinical profile, management, and outcome of these pregnancies were reviewed. We found a 40% association of karyotype and extracardiac malformations. Elective abortion was performed in nine pregnancies. Two of seven live-born babies had early neonatal assessment and intervention as a result of in utero diagnosis and counseling. Prolonged survival was achieved in both infants. We conclude that prenatal diagnosis of the hypoplastic left heart syndrome necessitates complete evaluation of the fetus for associated genetic and extracardiac malformations. Prenatal diagnosis of this defect provides opportunities for in depth counseling of parents and obtaining informed consent for either postnatal intervention or nonintervention before the medical and emotional complexities associated with the neonatal intensive care setting are encountered.\r"

  ".W": "Between January 1985 and November 1990, 128 pregnancies complicated by maternal red blood cell alloimmunization were referred to our Fetal Diagnosis and Treatment Unit. We examined the premise that an evaluation of fetal blood would accurately identify fetuses at risk of requiring antenatal transfusion therapy. Two hundred seventy-two diagnostic cordocenteses were performed. Criteria for the timing of repeat cordocenteses were developed retrospectively on the basis of the fetal hematocrit values, reticulocyte counts, and direct Coombs' test results of the first 84 pregnancies. These criteria were tested and confirmed prospectively on the next 44 pregnancies. On the basis of the first blood sample, four hematologic patterns (and their distributions) were identified in the 98 antigen-positive fetuses. Pattern 1: fetuses at low risk of having significant antenatal anemia (hematocrit less than 30%) (n = 11, 11%). These fetuses had normal hematocrit values and reticulocyte counts coupled with negative or trace-positive direct Coombs' test. No fetus in this group had significant antenatal anemia. Pattern 2: fetuses at intermediate risk of having anemia (n = 29, 31%). Pattern 2 fetuses had normal hematocrit values and either direct Coombs' titers of more than trace less than or equal to 2+ and normal reticulocyte counts or low reticulocyte counts (less than 2.5th percentile for gestation). Twenty-one percent (n = 6) of fetuses in pattern 2 had significant antenatal anemia. Patterns 3 and 4: fetuses at greatest risk of having severe anemia. These fetuses had normal hematocrit values associated with either reticulocyte counts greater than 97.5th percentile for gestation or a direct Coombs' test greater than or equal to 3+ (pattern 3, n = 49, 50%) or both, or a mild anemia (greater than 30% but less than 2.5th percentile for gestation) (pattern 4, n = 9, 10%). Eighty percent (n = 39) of fetuses with pattern 3 and 90% (n = 8) with pattern 4 developed a hematocrit value less than 30%. We conclude that evaluation of fetal hemolytic disease with a fetal blood specimen permits the identification of fetuses at high risk of having antenatal anemia.\r"

Cervical dilatation at time of surgery, number of previous spontaneous losses, and gestational age at placement were key determinants of outcome. The most frequent complication, premature rupture of the membranes, ultimately occurred in 38% of patients. The 6.6% infection rate was increased in patients undergoing emergent versus elective surgery (12.7% vs 4.7%, p less than 0.005) and in patients at increased dilatation at time of surgery (5.7% for less than or equal to 2 cm vs 41.7% for greater than 2 cm, p less than 0.005). McDonald and Shirodkar procedures had similar obstetric outcomes in patients undergoing their first cerclage. The subgroup of patients with prior cerclage surgery showed improved birth weight when the Shirodkar procedure was performed instead of the McDonald cerclage (mean birth weight 3020 vs 2470 gm, p less than 0.005). An increased rate of primary cesarean section was found in the Shirodkar group (31% vs 17%, p less than 0.005). Complication rates and pregnancy outcome appear to reflect cervical dilatation more than gestational age at time of surgery.\r"

  ".W": "Polyhydramnios associated with congenital anomalies was studied over nine years in 118,265 consecutive pregnancies. The prevalence of this association was 1.32% (156 cases). A case-control study allowed the examination of genetic and environmental factors for the origin of polyhydramnios associated with congenital malformations. Diagnosis of polyhydramnios associated with congenital malformations was performed prenatally in 41% of the cases; 16% of the infants were stillborn. Fifty-five percent of the cases had more than one malformation, 13.4% of them had a chromosomal aberration, and 32% had multiple malformations that do not constitute a syndrome. There was an increase of consanguinity in the parents of our patients. The incidence of polyhydramnios and congenital anomalies in first-degree relatives was 3.8%, and first-degree relatives had more malformations than the controls had (8.3% vs 3.2%). Our study demonstrated the low capacity of a general prenatal screening program because the diagnosis of malformations associated with polyhydramnios was made in only 41% of the cases and only six of 21 chromosomal abnormalities were diagnosed prenatally. We recommend the use of fetal chromosome analysis and careful ultrasonographic examination in every pregnancy complicated by polyhydramnios.\r"

  ".W": "Ethinyl estradiol is part of almost every combined oral contraceptive, and its pharmacokinetic characteristics have been thoroughly investigated in numerous studies. However, little is known about its pharmacokinetics during long-term administration, as compared with single-dose administration. In this study 10 women received a triphasic formulation that contained ethinyl estradiol together with the progestin gestodene over one treatment cycle. Mean area under the curve values of ethinyl estradiol were significantly higher on the last treatment day, as compared with the corresponding values obtained from the same women after single-dose administration. However, the observed increase in area under the curve was within the range of pharmacokinetic accumulation, to be expected on the basis of dosing interval and terminal half-life. Another point of interest was the effect of the triphasic preparation on testosterone concentrations in serum. Both total and free testosterone levels were suppressed by about 60% as compared with pretreatment values, and there was no correlation with corresponding sex hormone-binding globulin levels in the serum.\r"

Seventy-five patients between 24 and 34 weeks' gestation who were treated with intravenous magnesium sulfate for a first episode of preterm labor were enrolled. After a 12-hour contraction-free period on intravenous therapy, patients were randomized by sealed envelope to one of three groups: group 1, SLOW MAG (535 mg every 4 hours); group 2, oral ritodrine (20 mg every 4 hours); or group 3, no therapy (control). Patients receiving oral therapy were treated until delivery or completion of 36 weeks' gestation. No difference was found between groups with respect to time gained with the use of oral therapy or number completing 36 weeks' gestation. Therapy with enteric-coated magnesium chloride was associated with significantly fewer side effects (20%) as compared with ritodrine (48%) (p less than 0.01). Our results suggest that compared with ritodrine, enteric-coated magnesium chloride is as effective in prolonging pregnancy and preventing recurrent preterm labor. However, neither enteric-coated magnesium chloride nor ritodrine appeared to be any more effective in the prevention of preterm delivery than observation alone.\r"

  ".W": "Antenatal administration of glucocorticoids is often used to facilitate fetal lung maturation in cases of prematurity; however, the effects of betamethasone on maternal immune function have not been established. Therefore maternal immune function was assessed with the use of in vitro techniques. Transient and incomplete suppression of the proliferative response to the T-cell mitogen phytohemagglutinin was demonstrated as early as 24 hours after administration of betamethasone. The magnitude and duration of suppression showed a corresponding increase with advancing gestational age, but these effects were not cumulative and were always short-lived (less than 72 hours). No such suppression of the B-cell mitogen lipopolysaccharide was detected. The nonspecific cellular resistance to infection of maternal monocytes was determined through coincubation with the facultative intracellular pathogen Listeria monocytogenes. Increased phagocytic activity with a normal bactericidal effect was measured in the cell preparations obtained from recipients versus nonrecipients of betamethasone. Taken together, these findings clearly show that both specific and nonspecific immune function are intact in the preterm gravid woman after administration of betamethasone and should allay concerns over its use for reasons of infection control alone.\r"

It was decided in both cases to try to slow the bleeding by injection of vasopressin paracervically and then performance of operative hysteroscopy. In both cases, the injection of dilute vasopressin paracervically when coupled with operative hysteroscopy was quite effective in determining the cause of the bleeding and was instrumental in avoiding major operative procedures.\r"

  ".W": "Fetal heart rate variation in early labor was measured by computerized analysis in cyclic episodes of low or high variation in 136 women at 37 to 42 weeks' gestation. The amplitude (mean +/- SE) in episodes of low variation was 20.6 +/- 0.4 milliseconds; in high variation it was 57.3 +/- 1.1 milliseconds. The duration (mean +/- SE) of low episodes (24.3 +/- 1.3 minutes) was less than that of high episodes (45.1 +/- 2.7 minutes) but was sometimes greater than 1 hour. In episodes of low variation the amplitude was less than 5 beats/min long term in 11% and less than 2.5 milliseconds (pulse intervals) short term in 8%; these measures would be predictive of intrauterine death if persistent before birth. We conclude that the use of decreased fetal heart rate variation as a diagnostic sign of acute fetal hypoxemia in labor is incorrect, because changes of this size occur randomly as a consequence of fetal sleep states. There was no significant correlation between fetal heart rate variation over the last hour of labor and umbilical arterial base deficit on delivery.\r"

A preferential pattern of proximal left-sided iliac or femoral vein involvement was common to both cohorts, being seen in five of the seven cases diagnosed by ultrasonography and eight of the eleven cases diagnosed by venography. We conclude that ultrasonography, consisting of compression ultrasonography and color flow imaging, can replace venography in the diagnosis and evaluation of the extent of symptomatic deep vein thrombosis during pregnancy.\r"

Sixty-five women were randomly assigned to receive double-blind treatment with either erythromycin base or an identical-appearing placebo three times daily for 7 days. Only women between 23 and 34 completed weeks' gestation who did not have an indication for delivery were enrolled in the study. Pretreatment microbiologic tests were obtained and women were followed expectantly. Fifty-five women and their newborns completed the protocol and were fully evaluated. Overall, time from rupture of membranes to onset of labor and to delivery was longer, although not significantly, for erythromycin-treated women. Similarly, there was a trend for reduced neonatal intensive care (level II, p = 0.07). When gestational age at enrollment was controlled, erythromycin treatment of women between 28 to 32 weeks' gestation was associated with a prolonged interval from enrollment to delivery [erythromycin: 292 hours (5 to 679); placebo: 54 (12 to 323); p less than 0.044]. Fifty percent of erythromycin-treated women between 28 to 32 weeks' gestation continued their pregnancies at least 13 days after premature rupture of membranes, whereas 50% of placebo-treated women were delivered of infants within 4 days (p = 0.02). Erythromycin treatment among women less than 28 and between 33 to 34 weeks' gestation was not associated with prolonged latency or other changes. There were no differences between erythromycin- and placebo-treated women in the occurrence of clinically recognized chorioamnionitis, postpartum endometritis, or neonatal infectious morbidity. In this double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, erythromycin treatment was well tolerated, safe, and associated with prolongation of pregnancy and reduced intensive neonatal care requirements for selected mother-newborn pairs with preterm premature rupture of membranes.\r"

Our study was undertaken to examine whether amplification, rearrangement, or overexpression of c-erbB-2 and other protooncogenes was frequently observed in epithelial ovarian cancers. c-erbB-2 was expressed in 87% of 22 ovarian cancers analyzed, but expression was significantly increased in only one of the 22 tumor specimens. In this case elevated c-erbB-2 expression was associated with dramatic amplification of the gene. In another tumor a 3.8 kb EcoRI fragment was found, in addition to the usual 4.4 and 6.0 kb fragments; this is consistent with a possible gene rearrangement or a restriction fragment length polymorphism. To place these results in perspective, expression of several other protooncogenes has been examined in ovarian carcinomas. The c-fos, c-myc, n-myc, c-fms, and c-Ha-ras protooncogenes were expressed in different fractions of tumors, but expression of l-myc, c-erbB, c-myb, c-sis, and c-mos was not detectable. Aside from c-erbB-2, neither amplification nor rearrangement was observed among the other protooncogenes studied. Expression of c-erbB-2, c-fms, c-myc, n-myc, c-fos, and c-Ha-ras deserves further evaluation as a prognostic factor in ovarian cancer.\r"

Whereas their stable urinary metabolites, 6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha and thromboxane B2, may reflect in part systemic changes, it has been suggested that 2,3-dinor-6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha and 11-dehydro-thromboxane B2 more adequately reflect systemic production. Therefore we report for the first time the simultaneous measurements of 6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha, thromboxane B2, 2,3-dinor-6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha, and 11-dehydro-thromboxane B2 during the menstrual cycle. Timed urine collections were obtained from 18 ovulatory women, aged 22 to 40, during the midfollicular and midluteal phases. Serum estradiol, progesterone, urinary pregnanediol glucuronide, estrone glucuronide, and creatinine also were measured. Prostanoid extraction from urine by C18 and silica Bond Elut columns were then separated by high-performance liquid chromatography before radioimmunoassay. Concentrations of all urinary prostanoids were not significantly different in the follicular phase when compared with the luteal phase. A positive correlation of borderline significance was noted between luteal thromboxane B2 and pregnanediol glucuronide (r = 0.70) and between luteal estrone glucuronide and 2,3-dinor-6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha (r = 0.68). A significant correlation was found between follicular estrone glucuronide and the 6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha/11-dehydro-thromboxane B2 ratio (r = 0.83, p less than 0.04). These novel normative data suggest an influence of sex steroids on prostacyclin and thromboxane metabolism.\r"

Eight cases of umbilical cord prolapse occurred, a frequency of 1 in 277 deliveries (0.37%), all of which had a normal immediate neonatal outcome. Vaginal delivery was accomplished in seven patients (87.5%); diagnosis was made in two of them when delivery was imminent.

This study explores the relationship of cervical cancer screening, positive versus negative Papanicolaou's test results, and psychologic status among lower-income minority women. All patients were interviewed 3 months after they had received initial test results. One hundred six women with normal Papanicolaou's test results were compared with 118 women who were referred for colposcopic examination for follow-up of positive test results. Women with positive Papanicolaou's-test results showed statistically significant elevations in worries about cancer and impairments in mood, daily activities, sexual interest, and sleep patterns. More fine-grained analyses revealed that the effects of positive results were most pronounced among those women who did not comply with colposcopy (n = 53). These findings suggest that lack of compliance with follow-up may maintain high levels of uncertainty about disease and may interfere with successful psychologic adaptation. Health education targeted to psychologically vulnerable individuals may reduce psychologic distress and enhance compliance.\r"

Data included maternal age, human chorionic gonadotropin level, alpha-fetoprotein level, weight, race, and pregnancy outcome of 3428 pregnancies at between 15 and 20 weeks' gestation. The results of the study indicate that human chorionic gonadotropin levels decrease as maternal weight increases, that weight-adjusted human chorionic gonadotropin levels for Oriental and black women are higher than for white or Hispanic women, and that twin pregnancies have higher human chorionic gonadotropin levels than singleton pregnancies. Of 255 pregnancies that did not have normal outcomes, 54 (21.2%) had human chorionic gonadotropin levels greater than 2.0 multiples of the median and 26 (10.2%) had alpha-fetoprotein levels greater than 2.5 multiples of the median. Of 11 pregnancies with fetal aneuploidy, 6 (54.5%) had human chorionic gonadotropin levels greater than 2.0 multiples of the median.

Flow velocity parameters studied were peak systolic and time-averaged velocity and acceleration time at outflow tract level and time-averaged velocity, peak E-wave and peak A-wave velocities, and E/A ratio at atrioventricular level. An increase of all flow parameters with advancing gestational age was found. Aortic parameters were higher than pulmonary ones. Time-averaged, peak E-wave, and peak A-wave velocities were higher at tricuspid level than at mitral level, whereas E/A ratios were higher at mitral level. Outflow tract parameters showed no correlation with period time. A positive correlation for peak E-wave velocity and E/A ratio, and a negative correlation for time-averaged and peak A-wave velocity was found with period time. These results suggest that the normal second half of pregnancy is characterized by rising ventricular stroke volume and output and reduction in ventricular afterload. The left ventricular afterload seems to be lower than the right ventricular afterload. Atrioventricular flow velocities are heart rate dependent.\r"

The groups were comparable in age, height, and weight. All subjects were healthy. Forced vital capacity, forced expiratory volume in 1 second, their ratio, the forced expiratory flow rates between 0.2 and 1.2 L, 25% and 75%, and 75% and 85%, and instantaneous flows at lung volumes of 25%, 50%, and 75% were measured. All spirometric tests were unaffected by gestational age. However, all parameters of spirometry were significantly less in smokers than in nonsmokers when cumulative data during pregnancy were compared. Forced vital capacity, forced expiratory volume in 1 second, and their ratio were minimally reduced (4%, p less than 0.05; 8%, p less than 0.001; and 4%, p less than 0.001; respectively) in smokers as compared with nonsmokers. Larger reductions were noted in forced expiratory flow rates between 0.2 and 1.2 L (14%, p less than 0.001) and between 25% and 75% (16%, p less than 0.001), and in instantaneous maximum flows at lung volumes of 75% (11%, p less than 0.001) and 50% (13%, p less than 0.001). Maximum reduction of forced expiratory flow rates between 75% and 85% (26%, p less than 0.001) and in instantaneous flows at maximum lung volumes of 25% (23%, p less than 0.001) suggests marked increases in small-airway resistance and early small-airway disease in smokers. The progression of small-airway disease is related to the level of cigarette exposure. The results of our study demonstrate that the bronchodilatory effect expected in pregnancy is not sufficient to overcome the deleterious effects of cigarette smoking.\r"

At the time of urodynamic testing, the rate of unsuspected urinary tract infection was 8.1%. There was no statistically significant decrease in postinstrumentation infection rate in the group who received prophylactic antibiotics. We conclude that, given in the fashion described in the study, prophylactic antibiotics are not effective in preventing urinary tract infections caused by urodynamic testing.\r"

The four-chamber view was visualized in 90% of fetuses at 12 weeks' gestation and in 100% of fetuses examined at 13 weeks. The aortic root in short axis projection and the left ventricle in long axis view could be imaged in 70% and 40% of fetuses, respectively, by 12 weeks' gestation. Aortic and pulmonary valves were first visualized at 12 weeks, as were five-chamber, ductus arteriosus, and aortic arch views. The mitral and tricuspid valves were resolved in 60% of fetuses by 11 weeks' gestation. This study of normal cardiac anatomy suggests that there may be significant potential for the diagnosis of many fetal cardiac anomalies during the late first and early second trimesters of pregnancy.\r"

We have used flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry to examine the expression of the cellular markers for proliferation (interleukin-1, epidermal growth factor receptor, and transferrin receptor) and the markers of cellular differentiation (filaggrin and low-molecular-weight cytokeratin) in normal and human papillomavirus--infected human cervical tissues representing the natural range of human papillomavirus--induced disease. The results were correlated with the histologic grade of disease, human papillomavirus type, cellular deoxyribonucleic acid content, and cell cycle status. Interleukin-1 and transferrin receptor were slightly increased in high-grade dysplasias and in squamous cell carcinomas. Filaggrin expression was found to be inversely related and cytokeratin and epidermal growth factor receptor expression directly related to the degree of neoplasia. These findings indicate that cytokeratin and epidermal growth factor receptor are useful markers of cell proliferation in human papillomavirus--infected tissues and that their expression may directly increase as a result of infection.\r"

All positive and negative diagnoses were confirmed and none of the six infected fetuses survived. In this series, the most reliable parameters of infection were the isolation of the virus from amniotic fluid and elevations of total immunoglobulin M and gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase in fetal blood. In the majority of infected fetuses cytomegalovirus-specific immunoglobulin M was not detected in blood. Prenatal diagnosis of fetal cytomegalovirus infection is possible with a combination of amniocentesis and fetal blood sampling.\r"

Unstimulated cells from 7 of 20 women with salpingitis spontaneously released tumor necrosis factor at a concentration greater than 2 SD above the mean value produced by cells from 29 healthy donors. Interferon gamma (200 U/ml) further induced production of tumor necrosis factor from mononuclear cells of 11 women with salpingitis. In contrast, production of tumor necrosis factor by each of 23 other patients who lacked laparoscopic or clinical evidence of salpingitis was similar to that of the controls. In a subset of women whose cells were tested for production of other monokines, three of nine women with salpingitis spontaneously released interleukin-1 but none of the others did so. Four of nine patients with salpingitis also produced interleukin-6, but none of the others did so. None of the monokines were detected in serum from any subject. The results suggest that monocytes from women with salpingitis are primed in vivo and produce inflammatory mediators under conditions where monocytes from other women are poorly responsive. This increased monokine inducibility may contribute to the tubal damage that is the hallmark of salpingitis.\r"

The mean +/- SEM plasma endothelin values were significantly higher in patients with preeclampsia uncomplicated by the hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelet count syndrome (5.48 +/- 0.30 fmol/ml vs 3.86 +/- 0.28, p less than 0.001). In addition, the preeclamptic group with the hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelet count syndrome had significantly higher endothelin levels than those without the syndrome (8.30 +/- 1.62 fmol/ml vs 5.48 +/- 0.30, p less than 0.05). There was no correlation between plasma endothelin values and either systolic or diastolic blood pressure. We conclude that plasma endothelin levels are significantly increased in women with preeclampsia and particularly in those with the hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelet count syndrome, suggesting an association with widespread endothelial damage.\r"

  ".W": "Bacterial vaginosis is one of the most common occurring vaginal conditions among women of reproductive age. A rapid and reliable laboratory test for diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis would be helpful in the clinical detection of this disease. Elevated proline aminopeptidase activity has been identified as a reliable marker enzyme for bacterial vaginosis. A proline aminopeptidase assay has been shown to predict accurately women with a clinical diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis. However, this assay has significant practical disadvantages, the most notable of which is the production of a carcinogenic end product, alpha-naphthylamine. We have developed a modified assay for this bacterial vaginosis marker enzyme with L-proline p-nitroanilide, a substrate that does not yield a carcinogenic end-product. The new proline aminopeptidase assay is a one-step test that is analyzed colorimetrically with microsomal leucine aminopeptidase used as a standard enzyme (linear from 3 to 125 mU per well). We have determined the activity of proline aminopeptidase in vaginal wet preparations from 57 patients with both assay methods. In addition, vaginal smears were examined with Gram's stain and analyzed for bacterial vaginosis with the Spiegel method. When compared with the Spiegel method, the two proline aminopeptidase assay methods were similar with respect to assay sensitivity (93%), specificity (91% to 93%), and the predictive value of a positive result (78% to 82%) or a negative result (97% to 98%). Vaginal wash samples also were assessed for proline aminopeptidase activity. Values for samples identified as bacterial vaginosis positive were significantly different (p less than 0.0001) from those that were negative according to the Spiegel analysis of Gram's stain: negative results, 66 +/- 41 mU/ml; positive results, 704 +/- 145 mU/ml. These findings indicate that this improved proline aminopeptidase assay will offer a rapid, sensitive, and objective laboratory method for the diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis.\r"

In the 1980s the rapid spread of laparoscopic surgery has led to an increasing number of endoscopic denervations in patients with chronic pelvic pain associated with endometriosis. However, an analysis of literature data has failed to prove that presacral neurectomy and amputation of the uterosacral ligaments are effective and did not demonstrate better results with the use of lasers rather than electrocoagulation. Moreover, no valid comparison has yet been made between laparotomy and laparoscopic methods.\r"

Northern blot analysis indicated that inhibin alpha messenger ribonucleic acid is present in placental extracts collected at the early stage of gestation. Hybridization to inhibin beta A messenger ribonucleic acid was detected in the first trimester but in much lower levels. However, the intensity of the hybridization signal for inhibin alpha- and beta A-subunit messenger ribonucleic acids was greater in extracts prepared from term placentas than in those from the first or second trimester of pregnancy. Low levels of inhibin beta B-subunit messenger ribonucleic acid were observed only in extracts prepared from term placenta. At both early stage and term gestation trophoblast cells showed a positive fluorescent signal with the inhibin alpha-, beta A- and beta B-subunit-specific antisera. However, whereas inhibin alpha-subunit was localized in the cytotrophoblast, inhibin beta B-subunit immunoreactivity was observed in the syncytial layer of the villi, and inhibin beta A-subunit was widely distributed. The different distribution of immunoreactive inhibin subunits was confirmed by in situ hybridization, showing the different localizations of the inhibin messenger ribonucleic acids. These results showed that (1) human placenta produces the inhibin alpha- and beta A-subunits as early as the first trimester of pregnancy, (2) messenger ribonucleic acid levels for each of the three inhibin subunits are highest at term, and (3) immunoreactive inhibin subunits are localized differently in placental villi.\r"

Experimental studies in sheep have shown that interruption of the fetal hypothalamohypophyseal-adrenal axis will prolong gestation but no studies have shown prolongation of gestation after destruction of fetal neural structures. In this study we placed bilateral lesions of the paraventricular nucleus in five fetal sheep at 118 to 122 days' gestation. Cortiocotropin-releasing factor staining in the median eminence of the hypothalamus was markedly decreased after fetal paraventricular nucleus lesions. Paraventricular nucleus lesions prevented the fetal adrenocorticotropic hormone rise in response to hypotension and the normal predelivery increase in fetal plasma adrenocorticotropic hormone and cortisol and resulted in impaired fetal adrenal growth relative to the rest of the fetus. Lesioned fetuses had not been delivered at 157 days' gestation when they were removed by cesarian section to obtain tissue for histology. Four control fetuses were delivered at 146.5 +/- 0.9 days' gestation (mean +/- SEM). These findings indicate that a structure in the fetal brain, the fetal hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus, is necessary for parturition to occur.\r"

Cecal abrasion gave a consistently higher adhesion score when compared with sham laparotomy, on the basis of adhesion number, density, and vascularity, and so was chosen for use in further studies. The extent of serosal bleeding during cecal abrasion did not affect adhesion scores. Intraperitoneal injection of 10 micrograms murine recombinant interleukin-1 alpha in cecally abraded animals on the day of surgery and on the following 4 days resulted in a significant increase in adhesion scores when compared with those of cecally abraded animals injected with vehicle alone. Adhesions enhanced with murine recombinant interleukin-1 alpha, which were thicker and more vascular, were equivalently enhanced at doses from 10 to 10,000 ng, implying maximal response over that range. Rats not operated on and receiving recombinant interleukin-1 alpha 2 weeks after injury had increased adhesion formation. These results demonstrate that interleukin-1 alpha may be an important short-term mediator of postsurgical adhesion formation.\r"

Consequently, the aim of this study was to investigate the thermal effects and histologic changes from laser irradiation (Nd:YAG, 1064 nm) on normal and diseased aortic tissue using a novel angioplasty device. During laser emission the coaxially guided optical fiber tip was positioned in reference to the end hole of the metallic capped probe as follows: (1) at the end hole (metal-cap position), (2) protruding 10 mm from that end hole (bare-fiber position), (3) withdrawn 5 mm into the metal cap's lumen (hot-tip position). In total, 96 laser impacts (25 joule: 5 W, 5 s, each) were produced on normal and atherosclerotic aorta in air through a 0.2-mm-core-diameter silica quartz fiber, with direct contact on the intimal surface of the target tissue by both the fiber and the metal cap and by either the fiber or the metal cap (n = 32 each). Tissue temperature was measured by means of special sensors positioned opposite the irradiated intimal spot in direct contact with the adventitial surface. Morphohistologic evaluation of lesions was performed and injury indexes were determined.\r"

Patients either presented for diagnostic catheterization for evaluation of stable coronary disease (79 patients) or for unstable or new onset anginal symptoms (109 patients). Lesions were graded as to whether they were simple or complex; and post angioplasty films were reviewed for success rate, and degree of revascularization. Patients who were referred for stable anginal symptoms had a slightly higher success rate (91%) compared to those who were referred for new onset or more unstable symptomatology (85%, p = ns). Additionally, lesions morphology was judged to be more complex in unstable patients, as 67% had complex lesions with the presence of thrombus or ulcerated plaque in 56% of these stenoses. Angioplasty success was high for simple lesions in all patients, but was most unfavorable for complex stenoses in patients who presented with unstable symptoms (81% success rate). In patients who presented with new onset or unstable symptoms multivessel disease was present in 69% and angioplasty was more often geared at dilating a culprit stenosis leaving only 49% of these patients with complete revascularization. On the other hand, in 76% of those patients who presented with stable angina complete revascularization was a common outcome. Length of hospital stay was considerably shorter at 2.9 +/- 0.8 days in those patients who presented with stable symptoms.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "It has been observed in the present investigation that ischemic myocardium consistently produces bright green fluorescence after Acridine Orange (AO) staining. The area of ischemia in the left ventricular myocardium at different time intervals after onset of experimental ischemia has been calculated by use of this AO fluorescence technique. Zonal distribution of ischemia in the epicardial, middle, and endocardial zones has also been evaluated quantitatively from ten minutes to six hours after ligation of the anterior descending branch of the left coronary artery in the Wistar strain of albino rats. No similar study was available for comparison from the literature reviewed. The total area of left ventricular ischemia showed an increase with the prolongation of duration of coronary ligation from 13.39 +/- 2.69 mm2 at ten to twenty-five minutes to 32.99 +/- 5.69 mm2 at six hours after ligation. Statistical analysis of the zonal area of ischemia has shown that ischemia in the middle and endocardial zones was greater than that in the epicardial zone at all time intervals recorded. Middle zone ischemia extended over a larger area than that over the endocardial zone at all intervals except at intervals II (30-45 min), IV (2-2 1/2 hrs) and V (3-4 hrs). The results of this experimental investigation are significant for these point to the value of Acridine Orange fluorescence in detecting early myocardial ischemia and in demarcating zonal differences in ischemia. The authors have successfully utilized the method in a few human cases of clinically suspected myocardial infarction and recommend the technique for routine use to detect early human myocardial ischemia.\r"

The study did not show a lower use of analgesics in patients with silent ischemia, but this may be due to methodologic problems. Suggestions are given for another study design to overcome these problems.\r"

The two groups were similar in age, sex, predisposing factors, and site of infarction. Intravenous infusion of CLS 2210 was begun within six hours of onset of chest pain and continued for seventy-two hours. Thereafter, it was given, as oral capsules, in a dose of 1,000 mg every eight hours throughout the hospitalization. Before and during the trial, blood samples were drawn for the measurements of serum concentrations of creatine kinase (CK), and twelve-lead electrocardiograms (ECGs) were obtained serially in each patient. All objective data were analyzed on a coded basis without reference to the treatment. In the comparison group, thirty-six to forty-eight hours was required for CK to fall to 50% of the baseline value, whereas in the CLS 2210-treated group it reached 50% of the baseline in eighteen to twenty-four hours. For each infarction site, a statistically significant fall was reached earlier in the CLS 2210 group. CK, the ECG index, and the sum of the ST segments showed earlier and more rapid improvement in the CLS 2210 group than in the comparison group. The consumption of narcotic analgesic agents and nitroglycerin was substantially less in the CLS 2210 group than in the comparison group.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

They found a good correlation between the stroke volume values obtained by the two methods over a range of values from 30 to 130 mL. The coefficient of linear regression was about .95 at each visit. The mean of the differences was -0.73 mL with a standard deviation of 8.46. Given that individual differences are normally distributed, the values corresponding to 2 standard deviations of the mean define a range covering 95% of the observed differences. From the distribution of the data around the mean plot it appears that, in comparison with pulsed Doppler, impedance cardiography tends to slightly underestimate stroke volumes of greater than 90 mL and to overestimate values of less than 50 mL. The results of this study indicate that impedance cardiography may represent a reliable alternative to pulsed Doppler echocardiography for the noninvasive estimation of cardiac output at rest in elderly patients.\r"

HDL-cholesterol levels were significantly lower in patients versus controls (36 +/- 1 and 43 +/- 2 mg/dL, respectively). Serum Lp(a) levels in patients with PVD were 20 +/- 2 mg/dL, whereas in controls they were 16 +/- 3 (p: NS). Serum Lp(a) concentrations were identical in smoker and nonsmoker patients. There was no correlation between Lp(a) concentration and the other lipid parameters.

  ".W": "The overall output from the respiratory centers is regulated by an automatic metabolic control system in the brainstem and by higher neural centers under direct voluntary control. An understanding of the constancy with which respiration is controlled can be obtained by measuring the breath-to-breath variability in breathing pattern. We hypothesized that different forms of mental activity would alter the variability of breathing pattern. To test this hypothesis, we measured breathing pattern on a breath-by-breath basis during resting wakefulness and during four conditions of altered mental activity. Measurements were obtained with a calibrated respiratory inductive plethysmograph, and variability was assessed by calculations of the coefficients of variation. We also examined the effect of the altered states of mental activity on the mean values of the breathing pattern components. We found that noxious stimulation increased the variability of all the breathing pattern indices, audiovisual stimulation tended to increase the variability of tidal volume (VT), and mental arithmetic had no effect. In addition, the variability of breathing pattern was increased during rapid eye movement sleep and decreased during Stage IV sleep. The variability of VT and expiratory time were greater than that of inspiratory time (TI) across the different states of mental activity. Significant correlations were observed between VT and TI and between VT and frequency (f) during Stage IV sleep. With regards to the mean values, mental arithmetic, audiovisual stimulation, and noxious stimulation all increased minute ventilation and mean inspiratory flow.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The purpose of the present study was (1) to examine the relationship between duration of acute fasting and diaphragm contractile performance, and (2) to assess the effects of fasting on diaphragm glycogen stores and the relationship between changes in diaphragm function and alterations in muscle glycogen stores. Studies were performed on four groups of Syrian hamsters (nine animals in each group). One group served as a control and was allowed to feed normally, whereas the other three groups were fasted for either 1, 2, or 3 days. Diaphragm strips from animals were studied in vitro by measuring tension during electrically induced contractions. Two strips from each animal were studied; one strip was examined with a bath glucose equal to the prevailing blood glucose, and the second was preincubated in a high glucose solution (170 mg/dl) for 20 min. Fasting resulted in reductions in body weight, blood glucose concentrations, diaphragm strength, and diaphragm endurance in strips tested at the prevailing blood glucose levels. These effects were pronounced in animals fasted for 3 days, with little or no change in diaphragm contractility observed in animals fasted for shorter periods. Diaphragm weight, thickness, and glycogen content were unchanged in the fasted animals, as was the weight of the soleus muscle. Preincubation of strips from 3-day-fasted animals in a high glucose medium resulted in a significant increase in diaphragm strip strength and endurance.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Previous investigators have demonstrated in patients with obstructive sleep apnea that weight reduction results in a decrease in apnea severity. Although the mechanism for this decrease is not clear, we hypothesize that decreases in upper airway collapsibility account for decreases in apnea severity with weight loss. To determine whether weight loss causes decreases in collapsibility, we measured the upper airway critical pressure (Pcrit) before and after a 17.4 +/- 3.4% (mean +/- SD) reduction in body mass index in 13 patients with obstructive sleep apnea. Thirteen weight-stable control subjects matched for age, body mass index, gender (all men), and non-REM disordered breathing rate (DBR) also were studied before and after usual care intervention. During non-REM sleep, maximal inspiratory airflow was measured by varying the level of nasal pressure and Pcrit was determined by the level of nasal pressure below which maximal inspiratory airflow ceased. In the weight loss group, a significant decrease in DBR from 83.3 +/- 31.0 to 32.5 +/- 35.9 episodes/h and in Pcrit from 3.1 +/- 4.2 to -2.4 +/- 4.4 cm H2O (p less than 0.00001) was demonstrated. Moreover, decreases in Pcrit were associated with nearly complete elimination of apnea in each patient whose Pcrit fell below -4 cm H2O. In contrast, no significant change in DBR and a minimal reduction in Pcrit from 5.2 +/- 2.3 to 4.2 +/- 1.8 cm H2O (p = 0.031) was observed in the \"usual care\" group. We conclude that (1) weight loss is associated with decreases in upper airway collapsibility in obstructive sleep apnea, and that (2) the resolution of sleep apnea depends on the absolute level to which Pcrit falls.\r"

However, no physiologic process has yet been identified as the major contributor to this pattern. Sleep is typically associated with both the supine posture and substantial decrements in lung volume, and both have been proposed to have a role in the pattern of nocturnal worsening. To assess the effects of posture and sleep-associated reductions in functional residual capacity on pulmonary function, eight asthmatic patients were first monitored overnight in a horizontal volume-displacement body plethysmograph to determine mean FRC during sleep for each subject. We then compared, during wakefulness, the effects on FEV1 and methacholine responsiveness from chest wall and abdomen strapping (to maintain FRC at mean sleep levels) for 6 h in the supine and upright postures. FEV1 was significantly decreased after strapping in the supine posture (2.54 +/- 0.36 versus 3.38 +/- 0.29 L on control day, p = 0.0001) but was not affected by strapping in the upright posture (3.07 +/- 0.30 versus 3.34 +/- 0.31 L on control day, not significant, NS). Bronchial responsiveness to methacholine was not altered after strapping in either posture. These observations suggest that the supine posture, in conjunction with the reduction in lung volume associated with sleep, may contribute to the nocturnal worsening of asthma.\r"

  ".W": "The purpose of this investigation was to quantify the effect of cigarette smoking on standard measures of lung function in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). Our study population consisted of 73 patients in whom IPF had been clinically diagnosed; in 67% the diagnosis was confirmed by open lung biopsy. The average age was 63 yr; 62% were men, and 70% were either former or current cigarette smokers. Current cigarette smokers were found to have a greater percent predicted residual volume. Interestingly, in a univariate analysis, pack-years of cigarette smoking was found to be directly associated with increased measures of lung volumes (TLC, FRC, and RV) and diminished gas exchange (DLCO). Linear multivariate regression models demonstrated that current cigarette smokers have greater measures of RV and FRC and that increasing pack-years of cigarette smoking is associated with diminished gas exchange. Importantly, the FEV/FVC ratio was not significantly related to either smoking status or pack-years of cigarette smoking. Results from our study indicated that among patients with IPF, current cigarette smokers will tend to trap air (higher RV and FRC), and that cigarette smoking appears to adversely alter gas exchange. Moreover, IPF appears to reduce the likelihood of developing physiologic correlates of airflow obstruction among cigarette smokers. However, this does not imply that IPF prevents the development of cigarette-induced lung disease. In fact, the association between cigarette smoking and both increased lung volumes and diminished gas exchange suggests the presence of both emphysema and interstitial fibrosis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

To date there are no studies that have examined the changes in EELV in patients with mild to moderate lung disease. We studied the changes in EELV during exercise in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) with a wide range of pulmonary impairment to determine if changes in EELV were related to the severity of lung disease. Twenty-two patients with CF were studied (FEV1 17 to 112% of predicted) during progressive bicycle exercise, and changes in EELV were determined by repeat measures of inspiratory capacity. Changes in EELV at end exercise ranged from an increase of 0.67 L to a decrease of 0.61 L, and significant relationships were found between the changes in EELV and resting lung function (FEV1 percent predicted r = 0.79 and VR/TLC r = 0.58), indices of maximal expiratory flow (FEF50 r = -0.72 and FEF25-75 r = -0.71), and maximal work capacity (W-Max r = -0.76 and W-Max percent predicted r = -0.69). For subsequent analysis, patients were divided into two subgroups. Patients who were able to decrease EELV during exercise (Subgroup A) had significantly better resting lung function and SaO2 and significantly higher W-Max, peak oxygen consumption, and SaO2 at W-Max. Patients in Subgroup A also had a near normal ventilatory pattern during exercise. In contrast, the patients who increased EELV during exercise (Subgroup B) had severe lung disease (mean FEV1 29 +/- 4 percent predicted), limited work capacity, and desaturated during exercise.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".U": "91369017\r", 
  ".W": "A common method for analyzing a multibreath nitrogen washout (MBNW) is to perform moment analysis and derive the mean dilution number (MDN). A homogeneously mixed alveolar space with zero series dead space (VD = 0) will always result in a MDN = 1, regardless of breathing pattern. A higher MDN implies more inhomogeneity. But, if VD greater than 0, the MDN can become sensitive (artificially high) to VD/VT ratios. We present an alveolar-based mean dilution number (AMDN) that uses the cumulative expired alveolar volume. Unlike the MDN, the AMDN for a homogeneously mixed alveolar space is unity, regardless of VD or VT, and hence should be a more appropriate index of inhomogeneity at the alveolar level. Two sets of experiments were used to compare the AMDN with the MDN. First, a MBNW was performed by five healthy subjects at spontaneous VD/VT and at a low VD/VT achieved by a controlled increase in VT. Here, the MDN decreased from 1.98 +/- 0.1 to 1.79 +/- 0.06, whereas the AMDN was essentially unchanged (1.42 +/- 0.04 to 1.38 +/- 0.06). Second, MBNW values from seven healthy subjects, five with cystic fibrosis, and 10 asthmatic subjects (before and after bronchodilation) were analyzed. Compared with the MDN, the AMDN showed a significantly wider separation between clinical groups. Also, the AMDN demonstrated an increased variability within both sick groups versus a decrease in the healthy group. We conclude that the AMDN is superior to the MDN because of its decreased sensitivity to breathing pattern but increased sensitivity to degree of disease.\r"

  ".W": "To investigate whether or not the pathologic features in the lungs of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are related to the gas exchange response during exercise, we studied 17 patients (15 men, two women) with mild-to-moderate airflow obstruction (FEV1/FVC ratio, 59 +/- 3%), undergoing resective lung surgery, at rest and during submaximal exercise (71 +/- 5% predicted VO2max). During exercise, arterial PO2 increased (from 81 +/- 3 to 86 +/- 3 mm Hg, p less than 0.05) as a result of an overall improvement in VA/Q relationships. This improvement included an increase in the mean VA/Q ratios of both ventilation and blood flow distributions, and a more homogeneous ventilation distribution (logSD V, from 0.66 +/- 0.06 to 0.50 +/- 0.03; p less than 0.01; normal value, less than or equal to 0.6). The morphologic evaluation of the resected specimens disclosed a moderate degree of emphysema (emphysema score, 16 +/- 4) and mild abnormalities in membranous bronchioles (total pathology score, 107 +/- 8). At rest, significant correlations were found between the severity of the pathologic findings and both the degree of hypoxemia and the extent of VA/Q mismatching. During exercise, no relationship between bronchiolar abnormalities and gas exchange measurements was observed, whereas the severity of emphysema was correlated with PaO2 (r = -0.54, p less than 0.05). Both the overall increase in and the more efficient distribution of ventilation accounted for the improvement in VA/Q distributions during exercise. These changes were more pronounced in patients with a greater degree of bronchiolar abnormalities.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

We also hypothesized that these variables could be assessed from data readily available at the bedside, including tidal volume (VT) on mv and during spontaneous breathing (sb), ventilator peak inspiratory pressure (Ppk), and patient negative inspiratory pressure (NIP). Ventilatory endurance was evaluated using a modified pressure-time index: PTI = TI/Ttot x Pbreath/NIP, where Pbreath = Ppk x VTsb/VTmv. Defining VE40 as the minute ventilation needed to bring PaCO2 to 40 mm Hg, the efficiency of gas exchange was evaluated by calculating VE40/VTsb = (VE x PaCO2)mv/VTsb x 40. Because high levels of inspiratory effort might cause patients to reduce VTsb and thereby compromise CO2 elimination, we devised a weaning index (WI) that combines ventilatory endurance and the efficiency of gas exchange: WI = PTI x (VE40/VTsb). The study population comprised 38 patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, adult respiratory distress syndrome, pneumonia, neuromuscular disease, and miscellaneous other conditions. They had been mechanically ventilated more than 3 days and were considered by clinical criteria to be ready for weaning. Of 46 weaning trials, 19 were successful, 2 were partially successful, and 25 failed. PTI and VE40/VTsb were higher in patients who failed (p less than 0.05), but neither variable alone had sufficient sensitivity or specificity to predict the outcome of weaning trials accurately.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The effect of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) on airway resistance in ARDS also is unknown. We have used the technique of rapid airway occlusion during constant-flow inflation to measure the interrupter resistance (Rint,rs), which in humans is thought to correspond to airway resistance, in nine patients with ARDS under different inflation flows and volumes. This procedure was carried out at four levels of PEEP (0, 5, 10, and 15 cm H2O). We found that (1) at constant inflation volume, Rint,rs did not change significantly with increasing flow; (2) at constant inflation flow, Rint,rs showed an initial decrease followed by a distinct rise with increasing lung volume; (3) on average, PEEP did not significantly change Rint,rs measured during baseline ventilation; and (4) this latter finding occurred because patients behaved differently with application of PEEP, depending on their degree of lung inflation: Rint,rs measured close to full inflation almost invariably exhibited a rise, but values obtained at lower volumes exhibited the characteristic decrease of Rint,rs with increasing inflation volume.\r"

Alveolar recruitment with PEEP was quantified in terms of recruited volume, i.e., as difference in lung volume between PEEP and zero end-expiratory pressure (ZEEP) for the same static inflation pressure (20 cm H2O) from the V-P curves obtained at the different PEEP levels. In addition, static compliance of the respiratory system at fixed tidal volume (0.7 L) was determined at the different PEEP levels. The results suggest that: (1) in some patients with ARDS the V-P curves determined on ZEEP exhibit an upward concavity reflecting progressive alveolar recruitment with increasing inflation volume, and PEEP results in alveolar recruitment (range of recruited volume at 15 cm H2O of PEEP: 0.11 to 0.36 L); (2) in other patients with ARDS the V-P curves on ZEEP are characterized by an upward convexity, and PEEP results in a volume displacement along this curve without alveolar recruitment and with enhanced risk of barotrauma; (3) the PEEP-induced increase in arterial oxygenation is significantly correlated to the recruited volume but not to the changes in static compliance. The shape of the static inflation V-P curves on ZEEP allows the prediction of alveolar recruitment with PEEP.\r"

The fungus usually affects lung parenchyma and may disseminate from there. We have recently noted tracheobronchitis in six patients with heart-lung and lung transplants, three of whom had deep mucosal ulceration and histologic evidence of invasive aspergillosis. This apparently new form of invasive disease is initially limited to the anastomosis site and large airways. Ulceration, necrosis, cartilage invasion, and formation of a pseudomembrane are the pathologic features. In two patients subsequent disseminated aspergillosis occurred with a fatal outcome. In the two single-lung recipients, disease was limited to the transplanted side emphasizing the importance of abnormal local defense mechanisms in the airways of lung transplant recipients. Routine bronchoscopic examination of the airways is important in early detection of this complication. Oral therapy with the new, antifungal agent itraconazole was successful in five of the six patients, with fatal relapse in one. A classification of the various forms of saprophytic, allergic, and invasive forms of aspergillus tracheobronchitis, to include this new entity, is proposed.\r"

Previous studies that suggested the decreased survival of patients with AIDS and DMAC had incomplete information on patient immunologic status and follow-up. We studied patients with AIDS and DMAC and compared their survival with that of AIDS patients without DMAC but with other comparable risk factors for survival. Case and control subjects were similar in terms of CD4 cell count, prior AIDS status, history of antiretroviral therapy, history of Pneumocystis carinii prophylaxis, and year of diagnosis. A group of 39 patients with untreated DMAC had significantly shorter survival, mean of 5.6 +/- 1.1 months (median 4 months), than 39 matched patients with AIDS but without DMAC, mean 10.8 +/- 1.3 months (median 11 months, p less than 0.0001). The survival of 16 additional patients with DMAC who received antimycobacterial therapy, mean of 9.5 +/- 1.4 months (median 8 months), was not significantly shorter than that of an additional 16 matched control subjects, mean 11.7 +/- 1.9 months (median 11 months, p = 0.58). Patients with treated DMAC survived significantly longer than those with untreated DMAC (p less than 0.01). We conclude that untreated DMAC significantly shortens survival. Moreover, these results indicate that patients with DMAC who receive antimycobacterial therapy do not experience the shortened survival seen in untreated DMAC.\r"

One year after the initial series, each patient had a single repeat skin test. Reversion to a negative test occurred in 98 (26%) of the 380 patients. Decreases in induration of 6 mm or more occurred in 88 (90%) of the reverters. Initially positive tests were more likely (p less than 0.001) to remain stable than tests that were \"boosted\" to positive reactions on the second or third initial administration. Stable responses were found in 96% of those whose tests had greater than or equal to 15 mm induration compared with 61% of those with reactions of 10 to 14 mm induration. Increasing age also was associated with a high rate of reversion. The instability of boosted tuberculin reactions brings into question the clinical significance of these tests.

In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, we measured the ability of clarithromycin to reduce M. avium bacteremia in patients with AIDS and disseminated infection. Of 23 patients initially enrolled, 15 men with late-stage AIDS qualified for the study. One group received clarithromycin alone for 6 wk, then placebo plus rifampin, isoniazid, ethambutol, and clofazimine for 6 wk. The other group received placebo alone, then clarithromycin plus the other four drugs. Colony-forming units (CFU) of M. avium per milliliter of blood were determined by quantitative cultures taken at baseline and every 2 wk thereafter. Minimum inhibitory concentration of clarithromycin for 90% of the strains isolated from patients at baseline, as measured on 7H11 agar at pH 6.6, was 8 micrograms/ml. Eight eligible patients with initial positive cultures who were initially receiving clarithromycin alone had marked declines in blood M. avium CFU; in six cases, CFU decreased to zero. When seven patients were switched to placebo plus the other four drugs, CFU rose in four patients and remained undetectable in three. The five eligible patients initially treated with placebo had progressive CFU increases; when three were switched to clarithromycin plus the four drugs, their CFU declined.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Neutrophil functions were measured before and after 3 h of exposure to cigarette smoke. Passive cigarette smoking was associated with increased leukocyte counts (mean increase 33%, p less than 0.005), chemotaxis (57%, p less than 0.001), and release of reactive oxidants (71%, p less than 0.005) by stimulated neutrophils. These results were confirmed in a second study designed to eliminate the possible complicating effects of serial venepuncture. Plasma concentrations of the proinflammatory cytokines interleukin-1 (IL-1) alpha, IL-1 beta, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha) were not affected by passive smoking. These results indicate that inhalation of sidestream tobacco smoke promotes systemic priming of neutrophils. These potentially proinflammatory events may induce oxidant-mediated tissue damage and carcinogenesis in the lungs of passive smokers.\r"

Liposomal KM injections (once weekly for up to 8 wk) led to a greater reduction in the degree of gross pulmonary lesions and in the growth of the organisms in the visceral organs (lungs, liver, spleen, and kidneys) of infected mice than did either free KM alone or free KM mixed with empty liposomal vesicles. The therapeutic effect of the liposome-encapsulated KM was dose dependent for doses from 50 to 200 micrograms KM/mouse/injection. Liposome encapsulation markedly changed the tissue distribution of KM, in particular in the reticuloendothelial organs, such as liver and spleen. In these organs, accumulation and retention of liposome-entrapped KM was remarkably higher than that of free KM. Moreover, considerably prolonged retention was seen for liposome-encapsulated KM in serum and lungs. Encapsulation of KM into liposomal vesicles increased incorporation of the drug into the host peritoneal macrophages and enhanced the antimicrobial activity of the agent against M. intracellulare phagocytosed into macrophages.\r"

  ".W": "In cystic fibrosis (CF), extracellular lung matrix is progressively damaged, neutrophils invade the air spaces, and activated neutrophils may release large amounts of neutrophil elastase (NE). Although alpha 1-antiprotease (alpha 1-AP) binds and inactivates NE and is the major antielastase of the lower respiratory tract, antielastase defenses may be overwhelmed in CF, leading to progressive lung damage. To determine whether the ability of alpha 1-AP to neutralize NE is impaired in CF, we compared NE activity in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid and human neutrophil elastase/alpha 1-antiprotease (NE/alpha 1-AP) complex in both BAL fluid and peripheral blood serum from patients with CF, normal volunteers, and patients with interstitial lung disease. We detected a considerable amount of NE activity in BAL fluid from all but one patient with CF but none in that from normal volunteers or from patients with interstitial lung disease. Although in interstitial lung disease there was a significant correlation between increased NE/alpha 1-AP complex in BAL or peripheral blood and the degree of neutrophil influx, NE/alpha 1-AP complex was disproportionately low in CF BAL compared with significantly elevated values in serum. These data suggest that in CF, alpha 1-AP-mediated defense against free NE in the lower respiratory tract is significantly impaired, and high levels of uncomplexed, enzymatically active, NE are present in CF respiratory secretions. To determine whether intravenously administered antipseudomonal antibiotic therapy for exacerbations of CF lung disease diminished the amount of free NE in respiratory secretions, we used BAL to investigate the effect of such therapy on neutrophils and NE in patients with CF colonized with pseudomonads.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Previous studies in humans and rabbits demonstrated that methylprednisolone appears in the lung in greater concentration than prednisolone. To ascertain which pharmacokinetic properties of these drugs explain this difference, we gave methylprednisolone and prednisolone, 5 mg/kg intravenous bolus, to 23 adult rabbits. To measure the plasma concentration versus time curves for methylprednisolone and prednisolone, samples were obtained predose through 480 min postdose. To measure the bronchoalveolar lavage glucocorticoid concentration versus time curves, lavage was performed once per experiment at seven separate time points from 5 to 480 min post-dose (two to four experiments per time point). Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) recovery ranged from 50 to 75% and was similar in both groups. Glucocorticoid concentration in plasma and BALF was determined by high performance liquid chromatography. To normalize for the dilutional effects of lavage, epithelial lining fluid (ELF) recovery was quantitated from BALF volume and BALF and plasma urea concentrations. Pharmacokinetic parameters of the two glucocorticoids were calculated both noncompartmentally and by a three-compartment model. The extrapolated plasma glucocorticoid concentrations at time zero of methylprednisolone and prednisolone are similar, but the volume of distribution and plasma half-life of methylprednisolone are significantly greater than those of prednisolone (p less than 0.05). Although the clearance of the two drugs are not significantly different, methylprednisolone appears to have a slower Cl than prednisolone. The mean residence time (the average time drug remained in body) was significantly longer for methylprednisolone than for prednisolone (p less than 0.05), and plasma glucocorticoid concentrations became significantly different in the two groups by 90 min (p less than 0.05).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

We now report that PGE1 does not have a uniform inhibitory effect upon human neutrophil functions in vitro. Cells were first pretreated with PGE1 followed by incubation with either N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (FMLP), phorbol myristate acetate (PMA), or C5a. Lysosomal enzyme release (myeloperoxidase, lysozyme), superoxide anion generation, and chemotaxis were then quantitated. PGE1 alone lacked any appreciable effect on these neutrophil functions. However, neutrophils pretreated with PGE1 (50 to 100 microM) followed by stimulation with FMLP (50 nM) showed as much as 40% inhibition of lysosomal enzyme release compared with control values (p less than 0.0005). In contrast, 0.1 nM to 1 microM PGE1 enhanced FMLP-stimulated enzyme release as much as 50% above baseline control values (p less than 0.05). Preincubation with 0.1 nM PGE1 followed by stimulation with variable doses of FMLP also resulted in enhancement of lysosomal enzyme release by as much as 187 +/- 3% of control values. The enhancing but not inhibitory effects of PGE1 were reversible with serial washing of the neutrophil preparations. Enhancement of enzyme release was not observed when either PMA or C5a was used as a stimulus after PGE1 pretreatment. However, cells pretreated with PGE1 (50 to 100 microM) and subsequently stimulated with C5a showed as much as 40% inhibition of lysosomal enzyme release. Preincubation of neutrophils with PGE1 (1 microM) resulted in a slight (15%) enhancement of chemotaxis to FMLP, but it had no significant effect on C5a-induced chemotaxis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Sheep were prepared for chronic measurement of vascular pressures, cardiac output, gas exchange, and collection of lung lymph. Tracheostomies were made for accurate delivery of gas mixtures. Sheep were placed in one of three experimental groups: those receiving endotoxin (n = 9), those breathing 100% O2 and receiving endotoxin (n = 7), and those exposed to 100% O2 alone (n = 6). Sheep had daily measurements of hypoxic vasoconstriction (FIO2 = 0.12), gas exchange, circulating white blood cell counts, lymph flow, and lymph and plasma protein concentrations. Lung neutrophils were counted, and copper-zinc superoxide dismutase and manganous superoxide dismutase were measured in lung samples from some sheep biopsies taken at baseline surgery and postmortem. Endotoxin markedly prolonged survival time and partially protected against the increased lung vascular permeability in sheep breathing 100% oxygen, but impairment of gas exchange, loss of hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction, and ultimate progression of respiratory failure were not prevented. Induction of MnSOD occurred in sheep breathing 100% O2, in sheep receiving endotoxin alone, and in those exposed to 100% O2 plus endotoxin. We conclude that endotoxin markedly increases tolerance to O2 toxicity but that some of the pathophysiology of O2 toxicity is unaltered. The role of superoxide dismutase in the observed protection is unclear.\r"

  ".W": "Infection is a major complication of organ transplantation, and the lung is the most common site in recipients of a pulmonary allograft. The generation of an immune response both systemically and in the lungs is a major line of defense against infection. Therefore, we examined the ability of blood monocytes (BM) and alveolar macrophages (AM) recovered from lung transplant recipients without evidence of infection or rejection and from normal subjects to act as accessory cells in mitogen- and antigen-induced proliferation of autologous lymphocytes (Ly) and to stimulate an allogeneic (MLR) and autologous mixed lymphocyte reaction (AMLR). Proliferation of autologous Ly in the presence of mitogen and antigen and of allogeneic Ly stimulated by BM was significantly reduced in the lung recipients when compared with those in the normal subjects. Impaired Ly proliferation may result from inadequate presentation of antigen by recipient BM, heightened suppressive activity of BM, or the inability of recipient Ly to respond to proliferative signals. We believe that our results strongly support a role for inadequate presentation of antigen by BM. Inadequate antigen-driven stimulation could be one reason why transplant recipients have an increased susceptibility to infection. Somewhat unexpected was the finding that AM from lung recipients functioned nearly as well as AM from normal subjects as accessory cells. Although they failed to support mitogen-induced stimulation normally, AM from lung recipients were as efficient as autologous BM and AM from normal subjects in supporting Ly proliferation for soluble antigen and alloantigen.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

We analyzed peripheral blood mononuclear cell subsets in a population-based, stratified, random sample of healthy black adults using monoclonal antibodies and flow cytometry. The study population consisted of 94 men and 79 women, including 73 smokers (CS) and 100 nonsmokers (NS). Cigarette smoking was associated with a significant elevation in leukocyte (WBC) count (CS 7,270 +/- 230 cells/mm3 versus NS 6,260 +/- 160 cells/mm3; p = 0.001), although WBC counts for both groups were substantially lower than those reported for white smokers and nonsmokers. Smokers had a significantly lower proportion of CD4+ cells than nonsmokers (CS 55.4 +/- 0.9% versus NS 58.7 +/- 0.9; p = 0.01), adjusting for age and gender. No significant smoking-related changes were observed for CD8+ cells, the CD4/CD8 ratio, or total T cells (CD3+), monocytes (CD14+), or natural killer cells (CD16+). Among black smokers, a significant dose-related decrease in CD4+ cells was observed as the number of cigarettes smoked per day increased. Among black exsmokers, the level of WBC and CD4+ cells returned to the level observed in never smokers within 2 to 5 yr after smoking cessation. These results contrast sharply with the previously reported increase in CD4+ cells and decrease in natural killer cells associated with cigarette smoking in whites. The data suggest that the immunologic effects of cigarette smoking may be significantly modified by ethnic characteristics.\r"

  ".W": "MK-571 is a novel leukotriene D4/E4 (LTD4/E4) receptor antagonist. The ability of MK-571 to inhibit LTD4-induced bronchoconstriction was examined both in six healthy volunteers and in six asthmatic subjects in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized crossover study design. LTD4 challenges were performed during a constant infusion with placebo or the active compound. The provocative concentration of LTD4 causing a 35% decrease in SGaw (PC35 SGaw) was 4.8 +/- 0.6 x 10(-5) M (mean +/- SEM) in healthy volunteers and 1.8 +/- 0.7 x 10(-6) M in asthmatic subjects during placebo treatment. Intravenous MK-571 (1,500, 86, or 28 mg) inhibited the LTD4-induced bronchoconstriction completely in healthy volunteers, up to an inhaled concentration of 10(-4) M LTD4. In asthmatic subjects, 28 mg MK-571 caused a significant, at least 44-fold, rightward shift of the dose-response curve to LTD4, whereas 277 mg shifted the dose-response curve at least 84-fold to the right. MK-571 is therefore a potent antagonist of LTD4-induced bronchoconstriction in both normal volunteers and asthmatic patients. MK-571 also caused a small but significant increase in baseline airway caliber in asthmatic patients, suggesting the presence of LTD4 in asthmatic airways and thus providing further support to a role for sulfidopeptide leukotrienes in the pathogenesis of asthma.\r"

Patients were allocated in randomized double-blind fashion to maintenance therapy with either formoterol 12 micrograms twice a day or albuterol 200 micrograms four times a day in addition to their other asthma medications. Patients were allowed to use \"rescue\" 100-micrograms albuterol puffs on an as-needed basis.

Measured at each clinic visit, morning predrug FEV1 rose significantly with formoterol treatment and was significantly greater at all visits than in the albuterol group, the greatest difference being in Week 8 (2.40 +/- 0.77 versus 1.92 +/- 0.66 L, p less than 0.001). Morning FEV1 30 min postdrug was significantly higher in the formoterol group at Weeks 2 and 8, the trend not reaching statistical significance at other times.

There was no difference in the mean +/- standard error of the mean maximum increase in FEV1 between salmeterol MDI, salmeterol DPI, or albuterol (0.57 +/- 0.078, 0.54 +/- 0.089, and 0.49 +/- 0.081 L, respectively); the increase following placebo was 0.25 +/- 0.082 L. The area under the 12-h time-response curve for FEV1 was greater for both formulations of salmeterol (MDI and DPI) than for albuterol. The three active drugs protected against histamine-induced bronchoconstriction. The increase in PD20 at 1 and 12 h and the area under the 12-h time-response curve for PD20 were greater following both formulations of salmeterol than after albuterol. The greater change in geometric mean PD20 values at 1 h after both formulations of salmeterol (2.21 and 1.88 mumol) relative to albuterol (0.98 mumol) suggests that despite similar effects on FEV1 the doses used do not have an equivalent effect on the airways.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

They received increasing doses (10 to 80 nmol) of substance P, of neurokinin A, of the N-terminal fragment of substance P, substance P(1-9), and of saline on 4 different days separated by 14 days. Nasal airway resistance (NAR) increased in a dose-dependent manner on substance P. Maximal increase reached 4.5-fold basal NAR. Response to neurokinin A was significantly lower (less than 2-fold basal NAR). No effect was observed on substance P(1-9) and saline. This order of activity [substance P much greater than neurokinin A greater than substance P(1-9) = saline] indicates an NK1 receptor-mediated mechanism inducing local vasodilation. No histamine release was found after any of the four challenges. Proteins significantly increased in nasal lavage fluid on both substance P and neurokinin A, whereas substance P(1-9) and saline had no effect. The percentage of albumin increased in nasal lavage fluid from 30 to 50% of total proteins on substance P and neurokinin A, indicating microvascular leakage. Polymorphonuclear cells significantly increased from 9 to 36% on substance P, from 13 to 49% on neurokinin A, and from 13 to 55% on substance P(1-9).

  ".W": "To study the role of tachykinins and neutral endopeptidase (NEP), an enzyme that degrades tachykinins, in the immune response in the airways of guinea pigs sensitized to ovalbumin (OVA), we examined the bronchial contractile response to OVA by inhibiting NEP in vitro. After incubating bronchial tissues with the NEP inhibitors phosphoramidon and thiorphan, we added 10(-5)% (10 micrograms/ml) OVA. Phosphoramidon and thiorphan (10(-5) M) significantly maintained the contraction that followed the peak contraction. In the next stages of the experiment, when the contraction induced by 10(-5)% OVA reached a plateau and began to relax, we added 10(-5) M phosphoramidon. Phosphoramidon inhibited the relaxation and significantly potentiated the contraction. In tissues treated with 10(-5) M capsaicin to deplete tachykinins, phosphoramidon did not potentiate the OVA-induced contraction, but substance P (10(-6) M) caused contraction. These results suggest that the immune response causes the release of tachykinin-like substances from capsaicin-sensitive nerves to induce bronchial contraction in part. To confirm the mediators that cause the release of the tachykinin-like substances from the bronchus, we also examined whether phosphoramidon potentiates the effect of leukotriene C4 (LTC4), serotonin, histamine, and platelet-activating factor on bronchial contraction. When the contractions induced by these agonists reached a plateau and began to relax, we added phosphoramidon. Phosphoramidon inhibited the relaxation and significantly potentiated the contractile response to 10(-5) M LTC4, and it significantly reduced the relaxing rate of the 10(-6) M serotonin-induced contraction. However, it did not change the effect of histamine and platelet-activating factor.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In the case of antigen, levels of histamine were also measured. In response to histamine, the subjects sneezed and had increased levels of albumin and TAME. The responses to antigen or histamine were unchanged 24 h after histamine provocation. The responses to histamine provocations were increased with respect to symptom scores and to the levels of TAME activity and albumin in nasal lavages compared to baseline challenge, however, 24 h after antigen provocation. Increasing antigen exposure from 1 to 3 days did not further increase the responsiveness to histamine. Histamine reactivity returned to baseline 12 days after antigen exposure. The number of eosinophils, neutrophils, and alcian blue-positive cells in the lavages after antigen challenge and before the histamine challenges correlated with the changes in response to histamine. The increase in sneezing induced by antigen stimulation correlated with the increase in the same parameter after histamine provocation 24 hr after antigen challenge (r = 0.88; p less than 0.01). Surprisingly, the other parameters assessed did not show similar correlations.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

To examine these questions we estimated the deposition of polydisperse MCH droplets by measuring the deposition of surrogate diethylhexyl sebacate (DEHS) droplets that were similar in size (1.5 microns) but monodisperse. Light scattering photometry and flow measurements were used to compute inspired and expired DEHS particle number. Deposition of DEHS during 4 breaths was measured twice at baseline and after every dose of MCH during an abbreviated challenge test in 16 subjects. Deposition was then compared with reactivity. Reactivity to MCH was expressed as the dose-response slope; it was calculated as percent final change in FEV1/cumulative dose MCH inhaled. Dose-response slopes ranged from zero (nonreactive) to -15.0 (very reactive) %/mumol (mean -3.2 +/- 5.3 SD). Seven subjects had a 20% or greater decrement in FEV1 after their highest MCH dose. Baseline DEHS deposition, which ranged from 66 to 84% (mean 77 +/- 5 SD), was not significantly different between responders and nonresponders and was not a significant predictor of the dose-response slope. Reactivity was significantly associated with an increase in deposition produced by MCH (p less than 0.007). This increase was small, however (relative change less than 7%), so that the effect on the deposited dose of MCH was minimal. We conclude that, with the breathing pattern used, individual differences in DEHS (and MCH) deposition were small and contributed little to intersubject variability of responsiveness to inhaled MCH.\r"

The children's histories of outpatient visits for wheezing and nonwheezing LRI during the first 6 yr of life had been documented by physicians in a single pediatric practice. Most children were reported by their parents to have been free of recurrent respiratory symptoms during the 2 yr prior to lung function testing. In sex-specific analyses, average lung function assessed by spirometry was similar in children who had made zero or one physician visit for wheezing LRI during the preschool years. Boys who had experienced two or more episodes of wheezing LRI during the preschool years had lower average FEV1, FEV1/FVC, FEF25-75, Vmax50, and Vmax75 than did boys who had zero or one preschool wheezing illness. The association between recurrent preschool wheezing LRI and later lung function remained after exclusion of data from seven boys who were reported to have wheezed in the 2 yr prior to study. Girls who had experienced two or more preschool wheezing LRI had lower average FEF25-75 and Vmax50 than girls with a history of zero or one such illness, but differences were not statistically significant. Recurrent nonwheezing LRI during the preschool years was not significantly associated with subsequent lung function in either sex, regardless of preschool wheezing LRI history. Detailed information concerning early childhood LRI experience is valuable in epidemiologic studies of factors influencing lung function in children.\r"

  ".W": "To describe bronchial responsiveness in populations, the dose-response slope (DRS), which is the linear slope of the dose-response curve, may be a more useful measure of severity than the provoking dose that causes a 20% fall in FEV1 (PD20 FEV1). To examine the distribution of DRS measurements and their relation to respiratory symptoms in children, we have analyzed data collected during a population study designed to measure the prevalence of bronchial hyper-responsiveness and respiratory symptoms. In this study, respiratory symptom history was measured by a self-administered questionnaire to parents and bronchial responsiveness was measured using the rapid inhalation method. Of 1,217 children studied, DRS values were obtained for 1,203 children who had technically satisfactory bronchial challenge data. In asymptomatic children, DRS values were distributed symmetrically on a logarithmic scale. The geometric mean DRS was reliable measure of the central position of the curve, and 1.96 standard deviations only slightly underestimated the 95% interval. In children with recent wheeze, the distribution was skewed toward larger DRS values. Mean DRS values were significantly different between groups determined according to symptom frequency. It appears that DRS values are more useful than PD20 FEV1 values in epidemiologic studies of respiratory illness in children because a value that relates well to symptom history can be calculated for the entire sample. The major advantages are that the measurement more clearly discriminates between symptom severity groups and that a value that represents abnormal responsiveness can be calculated.\r"

Current day and daily lagged associations between PM10 levels and PEF were observed. Elevated levels of PM10 pollution also were associated with increases in reported symptoms of respiratory disease and use of asthma medication. Associations between compromised respiratory health and elevated PM10 pollution were observed even when PM10 levels were well below the 24-h national ambient air quality standard of 150 micrograms/m3. Associations between elevated PM10 levels, reductions in PEF, and increases in symptoms of respiratory disease and asthma medication use remained statistically significant even when the only pollution episode that exceeded the standard was excluded.

To control for and assess the effect of type of work area on annual change in lung function, we limited the analysis to those 1,817 subjects who, throughout their textile work history at the company, worked exclusively in cotton yarn manufacturing or slashing and weaving, or in synthetic textile mills. The expected effect of smoking on average annual change in lung function was demonstrated for both cotton and synthetic workers. Despite lower overall dust exposure, cotton yarn workers exhibited steeper annual declines in lung function than did workers in slashing and weaving; this difference persisted within each smoking category, indicating a dust potency effect. There were mill differences in annual change in lung function among cotton workers, potentially masking an exposure effect. A smoking-work area interaction persisted after adjusting for mill differences, with the largest annual declines observed in cotton yarn workers who smoke. A significant dose-response relationship was seen in cotton yarn manufacturing between annual declines in FEV1, FVC, and FEF25-75 and average exposure by mill, and the larger declines were found in mills using the highest percentage and lowest grade of cotton. Synthetic textile workers had larger declines than did cotton textile workers, which were not explained by smoking or duration of employment. Unrecognized and unmeasured causative exposures or selection bias could explain this result.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

To assess the clinical relevance of BAL asbestos bodies we compared this bioassay of exposure to other measures of exposure and also indices of lung disease in asbestos-exposed workers (n = 71). The median concentration of asbestos bodies was 0.8 bodies per ml of BAL fluid (range 0 to 34.3). Seven workers or 9.9% had zero asbestos bodies identified in the BAL fluid. The concentration of BAL asbestos bodies was not associated with the duration of exposure (r = -0.02), the time from first exposure to asbestos (r = 0.12), or the time since last exposure to asbestos (r = 0.05). Moreover, radiographic and physiologic measures of asbestos-induced lung disease were not found to be associated with the concentration of BAL asbestos bodies. In fact, of the seven study subjects with zero BAL asbestos bodies, the mean duration of exposure was 32 yr, and six of these subjects had radiographic evidence of asbestos-induced lung disease. To assess the reliability of measuring BAL asbestos bodies, we performed a second bronchoscopy on 54 subjects and directly compared the concentration of BAL asbestos bodies from both the first and second BAL samples. Within these 54 subjects, the concentration of BAL asbestos bodies was found to be a very reliable measure (r = 0.76; p = 0.0001).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Among 176 asbestos-exposed persons for whom lung tissue was available, we found nine with clinical features consistent with asbestosis, but histologic sections failed to demonstrate asbestos bodies, the usual requirement for pathologic diagnosis of asbestosis (Group I). These nine were compared by analytic electron microscopy with nine persons with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (Group II), and with nine persons with all the criteria of asbestosis (Group III). The three groups did not differ significantly with respect to lung burden of chrysotile or tremolite and actinolite, but Group III had a lung burden of amosite and crocidolite that was three orders of magnitude greater than in Groups I and II, with no overlap. We conclude that (1) the American Thoracic Society criterion of \"a reliable history of exposure\" is sometimes difficult to define; (2) asbestos bodies are seen in tissue sections only when exposure has been reasonably high, and given the proper clinical setting, the presence of diffuse fibrosis and asbestos bodies in tissue sections are sensitive and specific criteria for a diagnosis of asbestosis; and (3) the prevalence here of 5.1% nonasbestos-induced interstitial lung disease among asbestos-exposed persons is artefactually high because of atypical case selection. However, because asbestosis is a disappearing disease, such cases will become more frequent. The identification of these other diseases is important because therapy and prognosis may differ from that of asbestosis.\r"

Although occasional pathologic descriptions of open-lung biopsies have recognized the presence of inflammatory cells, suggesting a similarity to \"lone\" cryptogenic fibrosing alveolitis, the two conditions have never been formally compared. In this study we describe the morphologic features of 49 open-lung biopsies from 34 systemic sclerosis patients with interstitial lung disease, many of whom had their lung disease diagnosed at an early stage. None had pulmonary hypertension. Examination of lung tissue by light microscopy showed the earliest changes to include patchy lymphocyte and plasma cell infiltration of the alveolar walls, interstitial fibrosis, and increased macrophages but only occasional polymorphonuclear cells and lymphocytes in the alveolar spaces. Alveolitis was not observed without fibrosis. Comparison of 22 biopsies with a similar number from patients with lone cryptogenic fibrosing alveolitis, matched for age and sex, revealed no qualitative or quantitative differences, other than a higher prevalence of focal lymphoid hyperplasia (follicular bronchiolitis) in the systemic sclerosis patients than in the lone cryptogenic fibrosing alveolitis controls (23 and 5%, respectively). There was an inverse correlation between the extent of interstitial inflammation and patients' age (p less than 0.05), disease duration (p less than 0.05), and age at onset of systemic sclerosis (p less than 0.01). There was also an inverse correlation between DLCO and interstitial fibrosis (p less than 0.01) and loss of lung architecture (p less than 0.05). Ultrastructural studies of eight systemic sclerosis biopsies showed evidence of endothelial and epithelial injury together with interstitial edema and excess collagen deposition. Occasional mast cells were observed, often in close contact with interstitial fibroblasts, but there were no tubuloreticular structures or evidence of immune complexes.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Actively sensitized animals were killed 2, 6, 24, 48, 72, and 144 h after being challenged by an aerosolized solution of ovalbumin. This study was completed by the evaluation of eosinophilic infiltration of bronchi to test the recently proposed hypothesis of the possible eosinophil recruitment by NEC product. Our results confirmed the increase in NEC number in the bronchial wall after sensitization. Originally we demonstrated that, 24 h after challenge, the NEC number decreased significantly, compared to sensitized only animals, suggesting possible product release. Eosinophilic migration was observed in sensitized animals and, more importantly, in all sensitized plus challenged animals. We suggest that bronchial NEC may play a role in immunoallergic events that take place in the lung after challenge, probably by releasing mediators that may influence, among other effects, eosinophilic recruitment.\r"

Pulmonary function testing revealed restrictive lung function with a mild reduction in the total lung capacity (80% of predicted) and a moderate-to-severe reduction in the diffusing capacity of carbon monoxide (50% of predicted). The chest radiogram and high-resolution chest CT scan showed diffuse fibrosis and focal honeycombing involving the upper and lower lung zones bilaterally. Bronchoalveolar lavage revealed 20% neutrophils in the lavage fluid with abundant rectangular flaking crystals. Open-lung biopsy exhibited extensive fibrosis and architectural remodeling with abundant sheets and fragments of engulfed polarizable crystalline material. Energy-dispersive spectroscopy and electron diffraction studies confirmed the material to have the features of mica. Asbestos and other silicates were not identified. The documentation of prolonged exposure to mica, the clinical and radiographic features of severe interstitial fibrosis, and the histopathologic delineation of the interstitial lesion, including spectroscopic and crystallographic verification of crystalline mica, support the causal relationship between mica and interstitial fibrosis.\r"

Methacholine airway responsiveness was analyzed as dose-response slope, a continuous measure of responsiveness that represents the slope of a line connecting the origin to the last point of the dose-response plot. Greater airway responsiveness to methacholine was associated with greater potassium excretion. A significant relationship between methacholine dose-response slope and potassium excretion (p = 0.014) was observed in multivariate analysis that took into account other covariates, including age, percentage of predicted FEV1, cigarette smoking, and skin test reactivity. In contrast, methacholine airway responsiveness did not appear related to urinary sodium excretion.

Apart from this physiologic function, mucins are important in that they are frequently altered in cancer; thus, they have potential usefulness as tumor markers. We have isolated mucins from human LS174T colon cancer cells and small intestine, deglycosylated these highly purified glycoconjugates, produced polyclonal antibodies to the apomucins, and used these antibodies to isolate two different types of cDNA clones that encode different apomucins. The first class of cDNA clones was isolated using antibodies to deglycosylated LS174T mucin. These cDNA, designated SMUC or MUC2, contain 69 nucleotide tandem repeats that encode a repetitive peptide that is extremely rich in threonine and proline. Northern blots using MUC2 cDNA as probes exhibit large (7,600 bases) and polydisperse hybridization bands. This gene is polymorphic within the human population and is located on chromosome 11. The second class of cDNA was isolated using antibodies to deglycosylated small intestinal mucin. These cDNA, designated SIB or MUC3, have 51 nucleotide tandem repeats that encode a threonine- and serine-rich repetitive peptide. This mucin also is encoded by a large, polydisperse message, but it is clearly distinct from MUC2 as it is located on chromosome 7. Both the MUC2 and MUC3 mucins are expressed in colonic tumors; however, the level of their expression is quite variable. Thus, at least two mucins are expressed by the human gastrointestinal tract. Elucidation of the regulation of these two genes will be important in understanding the physiology and pathophysiology of the human intestine.\r"

  ".W": "Tracheobronchial secretions are one of the most important elements of the mucociliary system that protects the respiratory mucosa. They contain bronchial mucus, which is composed of a group of macromolecules secreted by the goblet cells of the epithelium and the submucosal glands. Bronchial mucins are the most characteristic molecules of this mucus. They form a group of complex, polydispersed O-linked glycoproteins containing sugars, which make up 80% of their weight. The protein core of human airway mucin has been difficult to sequence by traditional technologies because of its high content of serine and threonine residues linked to numerous oligosaccharide chains. We therefore prepared a lambda gt11 cDNA library from one sample of human tracheobronchial mucosa and screened this library with a polyclonal antibody directed against the apopeptides of human bronchial mucins. We obtained 20 positive clones that were sequenced. These sequences were classified into three different types. The use of the nucleotide probes from these clones in Northern blot analysis showed that the RNA messages were extremely polydispersed. At the current time, four of these probes allow us to map human tracheobronchial mucins genes to at least three different chromosomes. These results suggest that the peptide moiety of the human airway mucin is very heterogeneous.\r"

  ".W": "Human respiratory mucins consist of a family of glycoproteins with different peptides in which glycosylation, the major post-translational phenomenon, is responsible for about 70 to 80% of the weight of these molecules. This glycosylation generates a remarkable diversity of O-glycosidically linked carbohydrate chains, which are expressed as several hundreds of different chains in a single person. These chains, which can vary from one to about 20 sugars, may be neutral, sialylated, or sulfated. They bear multiple epitopes. Some antigenic determinants such as ABO, Leb antigens in secretor individuals, Lea, or X or Y antigens have been identified. There is increasing evidence that, among other functions, this diversity of chains allows many interactions with microorganisms and may be an important factor in maintaining the sterility of the respiratory tree. In certain pathologic situations such as cystic fibrosis, which is associated with colonization by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the hypothesis of an alteration of this interaction is open.\r"

  ".W": "Mucins produced by goblet cells of the respiratory mucosa are condensed while stored in secretory granules. Mucin condensation and its decondensation upon exocytosis can be explained by the theory of polymer gel phase transition. After the opening of a secretory pore, Ca2+ inside the granule is exchanged for extracellular Na+. Na/Ca exchange triggers a polymer gel phase transition whereby the mucin polymer matrix undergoes massive swelling and thereby changes from a condensed to a hydrated phase. Swelling of the granular content is driven by a Donnan potential and results in the release of secretory product and the formation of small mucin gels, which later anneal to each other to form the respiratory mucus. Because of the tangled rather than cross-linked topology of the mucin network, the rheologic properties of the respiratory mucus depend primarily on hydration. As mucins are polyionic, the hydration of mucus is controlled by a Donnan equilibrium. Hence, mucus hydration and rheology are determined by two factors: the quantity, chain length, and charge density of the secreted mucins, and the amount and the ionic and polyionic composition of the water transported across the respiratory mucosa.\r"

  ".W": "Mucus hypersecretion is a characteristic feature of several human airway diseases, including chronic bronchitis, cystic fibrosis, and asthma. Although its pathogenesis is poorly understood, hypersecretion apparently results from the abnormally large number of mucous cells found in hypersecretory airways. The factors giving rise to these mucous cells are unknown, but experimental evidence supports possible roles for both mitosis (mucous cell hyperplasia) and differentiation (mucous cell metaplasia). On the basis of the hypothesis that differentiation would require activation of mucin mRNA transcription, we have used mucin cDNA to monitor mucin mRNA levels in an animal model of chronic bronchitis. We first showed that a mucin gene (SMUC or MUC-2) cloned from the human intestine is also expressed in the human airways and is the same or homologous to genes expressed in other human mucin-producing organs. We next showed that a homologue of the SMUC gene is expressed in several animal species, including the rat. Finally, we showed that the induction of experimental chronic bronchitis by SO2 in rats is accompanied by the induction (from near zero baseline) of airway mucin mRNA. The induction by irritants of high steady-state levels of mucin mRNA may represent one of the early events in mucous cell differentiation and hypersecretion.\r"

Studies on their polydispersity show them to have an Mr in the range 3 to 32 x 10(6) and a distribution of length from 200 nm to beyond 10 microns. These macromolecules are fragmented by reduction of intermolecular disulfide bonds into subunits, with Mr approximately 2 x 10(6) and length from 200 to 600 nm. Reduction not only cleaves the mucin molecule but opens, presumably by breaking intramolecular disulfide bonds, cryptic \"naked\" protein regions. Trypsin digestion of subunits yields high Mr glycopeptides (Mr, 300 to 500,000), presumably by cleavage of the peptide core within the unfolded \"naked\" protein domains. Respiratory mucus glycoproteins from infected sputum samples are usually heterogeneous in CsCl density gradients, in contrast to those from \"normal\" tracheobronchial secretions. The former are characterized by the presence of a number of different mucin species, and the basis for the separation of these mucins appears to be the variable presence of sialic acid and sulfate moieties in the oligosaccharide clusters. This heterogeneity may reflect a difference in cellular origin of the mucins and also may be clinically significant.\r"

  ".W": "Although mucins have been studied at the biochemical and biophysical level for some time, attempts to define their structures in detail were only partially successful because of their size and complexity. The advent of monoclonal antibodies reactive with these molecules introduced a new approach to structural studies by defining antigenic epitopes, by allowing purification of the mucin molecules by affinity chromatography, and by providing a means to clone genes coding for the core proteins. By their profile of reactivity with the normal and cancer-associated mucin in a particular tissue, the antibodies also defined a difference in the mucin derived from the two sources. It is now clear that this difference lies in the carbohydrate side chains, as the core proteins are identical. Because the mucins are tumor-associated antigens and the cancer mucins can express epitopes that are relatively tumor specific, this family of molecules is now being intensively studied. There is also considerable interest in elucidating the normal function of the mucin and in determining whether, through an altered structure, this function is subverted in malignancy. In the next few years we should expect that the structure of other mucins will be defined in the same detail as the product of the MUC1 gene. We should also expect to see the continued application of mucin-reactive antibodies in the clinic and the investigation of mucins as agents for immunotherapy of some cancers. As to the function(s) of these molecules, perhaps we will learn enough in the future to make a critical reappraisal of the name.\r"

  ".W": "To investigate the hypothesis that mast cell and neutrophil proteases stimulate airway gland secretion, we studied the effects of two mast cell proteases (tryptase and chymase) and two neutrophil enzymes (human neutrophil elastase and cathepsin G) on secretion of 35S-labeled macro-molecules from cultured bovine airway gland serous cells. Tryptase had no effect, but the other three enzymes stimulated secretion. Threshold concentrations of the enzymes (greater than or equal to 10(-10) M) were lower by two orders of magnitude than other agonists (e.g., histamine, prostaglandins, beta-adrenergic agonists). Only proteases induced maximal secretory response (greater than or equal to 80% depletion of 35S-labeled macromolecules), and these responses were greater than 10-fold larger than those of other agonists. The active catalytic sites of the enzymes are required for their secretory activities. These findings suggest a role for these enzymes in the pathogenesis of inflammatory airway diseases associated with hypersecretion, and they suggest that the use of selective site-directed inhibitors of these enzymes may provide a novel strategy for intervention in inflammatory diseases of the airways associated with hypersecretion (e.g., cystic fibrosis, chronic bronchitis).\r"

However, the constituents that are found in mucus and their roles in human health and disease are still in the initial phases of exploration. Human nasal respiratory secretions provide one convenient source of mucous membrane secretions. Nasal secretions include a variety of proteins, which appear to serve important functions in host-defense. Most, if not all, of the antiphlogistic products are synthesized and secreted by serous cells in the submucous glands, and it appears that the serous cell is the resident antimicrobial cell in mucous membranes.\r"

DESIGN: Prospective, observational study of consecutive patients with Enterobacter bacteremia. SETTING: Three university tertiary care centers, one major university-affiliated hospital, and two university-affiliated Veterans Affairs medical centers. PATIENTS: A total of 129 adult patients were studied. MEASUREMENTS: The two main end points were emergence of resistance during antibiotic therapy and death. MAIN RESULTS: Previous administration of third-generation cephalosporins was more likely to be associated with multiresistant Enterobacter isolates in an initial, positive blood culture (22 of 32, 69%) than was administration of antibiotics that did not include a third-generation cephalosporin (14 of 71, 20%; P less than 0.001). Isolation of multiresistant Enterobacter sp. in the initial blood culture was associated with a higher mortality rate (12 of 37, 32%) than was isolation of a more sensitive Enterobacter sp. (14 of 92, 15%; P = 0.03). Emergence of resistance to third-generation cephalosporin therapy (6 of 31, 19%) occurred more often than did emergence of resistance to aminoglycoside (1 of 89, 0.01%; P = 0.001) or other beta-lactam (0 of 50; P = 0.002) therapy. CONCLUSIONS: More judicious use of third-generation cephalosporins may decrease the incidence of nosocomial multiresistant Enterobacter spp., which in turn may result in a lower mortality for Enterobacter bacteremia. When Enterobacter organisms are isolated from blood, it may be prudent to avoid third-generation cephalosporin therapy regardless of in-vitro susceptibility.\r"

This paper briefly reviews the evidence for genetic and other causes of Alzheimer disease, including specifically its typical late-onset variant. Several recent developments in the molecular genetics of early-onset Alzheimer disease are described briefly. These findings, however, may not apply to more typical, late-onset Alzheimer disease. Genetic studies of the latter disorder are complicated by the censorship of any inherited predisposition to disease by death from other causes. Hence, heritable disease may be apparent only in families with large numbers of elderly relatives at risk. Relying on empiric observations of risk among relatives from several recent studies of pooled Alzheimer families, curves are presented describing theoretic age-specific risks in relatives of patients and unaffected controls. Real (current) lifetime risks of Alzheimer disease are then estimated by modification of the theoretic figures with corresponding current age-specific mortality characteristics of the U.S. population. The lifetime incidence among relatives of patients with Alzheimer disease is estimated to be 19%, or three to four times the risk among control relatives. Because both mortality of and risk for Alzheimer disease change rapidly with advancing age, it may be possible to reduce the current morbidity from Alzheimer disease by 50% if onset can be postponed by only 5 years.\r"

DESIGN: Cross sectional, with blinded analysis of all electrocardiographic data. SETTING: Outpatient departments of a Veterans Affairs medical center and a tertiary care private hospital. PARTICIPANTS: Twenty-four patients with myotonic dystrophy. Patients were excluded from the study if they had either a history suggestive of significant ventricular arrhythmias or electrocardiographic evidence of a bundle-branch block. Two comparison groups were also formed; one group included 44 healthy employees at the tertiary hospital and the other, 30 cardiac patients with inducible ventricular tachycardia. MAIN RESULTS: A time-domain analysis of the signal-averaged electrocardiograms showed that 75% of patients with myotonic dystrophy met one criterion for the presence of late potentials, 67% met two criteria, and 29% met all three criteria. Spectrotemporal mapping in these patients showed markedly abnormal spectral peaks with a mean factor of normality that was significantly lower than that of the normal volunteers; the frequency of electrocardiographic abnormalities approached that seen in patients with known ventricular tachycardia. The presence of late potentials correlated directly with the length of the PR interval and inversely with left ventricular fractional shortening. CONCLUSIONS: In our study, the prevalence of late potentials on signal-averaged electrocardiography in patients with myotonic dystrophy approached that seen in cardiac patients with inducible ventricular tachycardia. It is possible that ventricular arrhythmias play a role in the occurrence of sudden death in some patients with myotonic dystrophy.\r"

DESIGN: A prospective, 25-year longitudinal demographic and clinical cohort study. A matched case-control study was conducted to determine risk factors. PATIENTS: A total of 725 patients with sickle cell anemia and 209 patients with sickle C disease who received medical care from the hematology service in a large municipal hospital. Most were observed from birth or early childhood. MEASUREMENTS: Thirty-six patients developed sickle renal failure: 4.2% of patients with sickle cell anemia and 2.4% of patients with sickle C disease. The median age of disease onset for these patients was 23.1 and 49.9 years, respectively. Survival time for patients with sickle cell anemia after the diagnosis of sickle renal failure, despite dialysis, was 4 years, and the median age at the time of death was 27 years. Relative risk for mortality was 1.42 (95% Cl, 1.12 to 1.81; P = 0.02) compared with patients who did not develop renal insufficiency. MAIN RESULTS: Histopathologic studies showed characteristic lesions of glomerular \"drop out\" and glomerulosclerosis. Case-control analysis showed that ineffective erythropoiesis with increasingly severe anemia, hypertension, proteinuria, the nephrotic syndrome, and microscopic hematuria were significant pre-azotemic predictors of chronic renal failure. The risk for sickle renal failure was increased in patients who had inherited the Central African Republic beta s-gene cluster haplotype. CONCLUSIONS: The pre-azotemic manifestations of hypertension, proteinuria, and increasingly severe anemia predict end-stage renal failure in patients with sickle cell disease. The rate of progression of renal insufficiency is genetically determined. Treatment of the uremic phase has been dismal, underscoring the need for the development of useful pre-azotemic therapeutic modalities.\r"

Tumor markers have five potential uses in patient care: They can be used for screening, for diagnosis, for establishing prognosis, for monitoring treatment, and for detecting relapse. The value of a marker in a given setting depends on two marker-related characteristics--sensitivity and specificity. The value of a marker in a particular malignancy also depends on the effectiveness of therapy for the malignancy. Tumor markers have been used to screen for occult cancer but have proved to be valuable only in selected cancers. As diagnostic tools, tumor markers have limitations: Nearly all markers can be elevated in benign disorders, and most markers are not elevated in the early stages of malignancy. Extreme marker elevation often indicates a poor prognosis and in some malignancies can indicate the need for more aggressive treatment. Tumor markers have their greatest value when used to monitor therapy in patients with widespread cancer. Nearly all markers show some correlation with the clinical course of disease, with marker elevation in any stage declining to normal after a curative intervention. Recurrent disease can be accompanied by increased marker levels, but markers can detect an occult recurrence in only a few diseases, thereby facilitating a second attempt at cure. Although it seems unlikely that an ideal tumor marker will be identified for every malignancy, several workable markers are already available. Increasing our knowledge about the capabilities and limitations of existing markers will enable us to use them judiciously in the treatment of cancer.\r"

  ".W": "Living wills and other advance directives currently play a limited role in medical decision making. A new federal law, the Patient Self-Determination Act, will require health care providers in hospitals, nursing homes, and other facilities to inquire about the presence of advance directives, to record patient preferences in the medical record, and to develop institutional policies regarding the implementation of these directives. Unfortunately, the law does little to promote discussion or preparation of advance directives before hospitalization. Additional efforts to promote the use of advance directives can take place in the outpatient medical care system, in attorneys' offices, or through health insurers. Because most people have not yet prepared an advance directive, we suggest that institutions develop treatment policies for situations in which the wishes of patients who lack decisional capacity are not known. These policies should be designed to promote the patients' best interests, as defined by the consensus of the institutions' staff and members of the surrounding community.\r"

We therefore examined these neurons in the normal human medulla and in the brains of patients with Parkinson's disease, using both a melanin stain and immunohistochemical methods with an antiserum against tyrosine hydroxylase. The greatest numbers of catecholaminergic neurons in the ventrolateral reticular formation (A1/C1 group) were located in the far rostral medulla, whereas the largest populations of catecholaminergic cells in the dorsal vagal complex (A2/C2 group) were found at the level of the area postrema. No loss of cells was observed in the A1/C1 group in the parkinsonian brains. In contrast, the A2/C2 group showed moderate loss of neurons, most marked at the level of the area postrema. This difference was entirely due to the loss of neurons in the medial component of the A2 group, a population that normally is only lightly pigmented, while the heavily pigmented neurons in the ventral and intermediate components of the A2 complex were unaffected. Parkinson's disease causes degeneration only of selected populations of medullary catecholaminergic neurons, without apparent relationship to the extent of melanin pigmentation.\r"

Twenty-four children with strokes had combined parenchymal magnetic resonance imaging and magnetic resonance angiography 1 day to 4 years after acute presentation. Eight had had prior intra-arterial angiography. Eighteen magnetic resonance angiographic studies showed arterial stenosis or occlusion in the vascular distribution of magnetic resonance image-defined brain infarction and, in 7 children, in the same location as previously defined abnormalities on intra-arterial angiography. One child had a normal intra-arterial angiogram and magnetic resonance angiogram. The other 5 children with normal magnetic resonance angiographic studies included 3 with presumed embolic disease, 1 with meningitis, and 1 with Crohn's disease-related vasculitis. Collateral flow patterns could be determined in 4 children. Artifact presenting as filling defects in vessels was present in 10 studies, but did not interfere with interpretation of 8 studies. Combined magnetic resonance imaging/magnetic resonance angiography provides a screening technique to evaluate noninvasively brain parenchyma and vasculature in children with suspected large-vessel abnormalities, allowing selection for intra-arterial angiography and serial monitoring of vascular abnormalities over time and during therapeutic intervention.\r"

The patients with vertebrobasilar events at entry comprised one-third of the whole patient population. The overall total incidence of stroke or death (the end points) during the 2-year follow-up in the placebo group was lower in the vertebrobasilar group compared to the carotid group (14% versus 24%, respectively). The combination therapy of dipyridamole and acetylsalicylic acid caused a marked reduction in the incidence of stroke or death in patients with vertebrobasilar (51%) and carotid (30%) events. When only stroke was considered as the end point, dipyridamole and acetylsalicylic acid seemed to be more effective in reducing the risk of transient ischemic attacks than stroke, and more effective in men than in women.\r"

The mean cumulative dose they had received (498 +/- 145 gm) was significantly higher than that of the other 14 zidovudine recipients of the study. They suffered from a progressive, usually painful, proximal myopathy with pronounced wasting, normal-to-moderately elevated creatine kinase levels, and a myopathic electromyographic pattern. The condition usually improved after withdrawal of the drug. Assay of mitochondrial enzymes, including succinate-cytochrome c reductase, cytochrome c oxidase, and citrate synthase, showed a decline in respiratory chain capacity. Southern blot analysis of mitochondrial DNA showed no abnormality. It is likely that mitochondrial dysfunction, probably resulting from drug-induced inhibition of the mitochondrial DNA polymerase, is implicated in the pathogenesis of this complication of zidovudine therapy.\r"

  ".U": "91369170\r", 
  ".W": "Oral administration of proteins is a long-recognized method of inducing antigen-specific peripheral immune tolerance. We previously showed that oral administration of myelin basic protein suppresses monophasic experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis in the Lewis rat when it is given in association with immunization and prior to disease onset. As a potential therapy for human autoimmune disease, it is crucial to determine whether oral tolerance can ameliorate an ongoing immune response. We therefore asked whether oral administration of myelin antigens, after sensitization and disease expression has occurred, could affect immunological, clinical, or pathological features of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. Chronic relapsing experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis was induced in the Lewis rat and strain 13 guinea pig by immunization with whole guinea pig cord homogenate, complete Freund's adjuvant, and Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Following recovery from the first attack, animals were orally given bovine myelin, guinea pig myelin, or guinea pig myelin basic protein three times per week for up to 3 months. Animals receiving myelin products orally had decreased severity and frequency of clinical relapses, decreased delayed-type hypersensitivity responses to myelin antigens, diminished inflammation in the central nervous system (CNS), and decreased areas of CNS demyelination. In the rat, guinea pig myelin basic protein was as effective as guinea pig myelin in ameliorating the disease and also resulted in decreased serum anti-myelin basic protein antibody levels. No exacerbation of disease or worsening of pathological findings occurred in the animals given myelin products. These results demonstrate that oral administration of myelin antigens can suppress chronic relapsing experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis and have direct relevance to therapy of human demyelinating disorders such as multiple sclerosis.\r"

We were able to determine whether chorea was associated with high levodopa concentrations or low levodopa concentrations or both. We found the following patterns of levodopa-associated chorea: chorea due to inadequate levodopa levels, chorea due to biphasic levodopa absorption, chorea associated with either rapid or slow levodopa absorption, and chorea due to long-duration levodopa absorption mimicking a sustained-release preparation. Seven patients benefited after their dosing schedules were rearranged as a result of information gained from monitoring. We conclude that any patient with levodopa-associated chorea who cannot be regulated on the basis of observation alone should be studied with simultaneous plasma levodopa measurements and clinical monitoring to detect an unusual plasma levodopa pattern that may be improved by adjustment of dosing schedule.\r"

Focused magnetic brain stimulation was performed in 1 patient and gave identical results.

The original model, using initial Glasgow Coma Scale score, hemorrhage size, and pulse pressure, accounted for mortality or survival at 30 days in 92% of patients in the Pilot Stroke Data Bank with a sensitivity of 0.84 and a specificity of 0.96. For external validation, the model was used to predict 30-day status for each patient in the Main Phase Stroke Data Bank for whom complete risk factor information was available. Overall, 90% of patients' outcomes were correctly predicted with a sensitivity of 0.85 and a specificity of 0.92. Two factors not collected in the Pilot Stroke Data Bank, hyperglycemia and intraventricular hemorrhage extension, were assessed to determine if they provided additional predictive information on 30-day mortality. Intraventricular hemorrhage extension contributed significant predictive information in a logistic regression, whereas hyperglycemia did not. The resulting four-factor model with an interaction term (intraventricular hemorrhage extension and Glasgow Coma Scale score) correctly classified the survival status of 94% of patients at 30 days. A more general outcome, death or failure to achieve a \"good\" Activities of Daily Living Score by one year, was analyzed with respect to the same four factors. The resulting model correctly classified 95% of the patients in the cohort.\r"

After levodopa (on), patients' motor time normalized, but cognitive processing speed became significantly slower when compared with previous performance in the off condition and with controls. Contrary to previous concepts of bradyphrenia in patients with Parkinson's disease, these results indicate that dopaminergic stimulation can reduce cognitive processing speed.\r"

The mean interval between the scans was 3.3 years for the group with idiopathic parkinsonism and 3.9 years for the control subjects. The scans were analyzed by calculating the ratio of striatal to background radioactivity. Both groups showed statistically significant reductions of striatal uptake over the interval. The rate of decrease was almost identical in each group (p = 0.6). We infer that the usual rate of loss of integrity of the dopaminergic nigrostriatal pathway in patients with idiopathic parkinsonism is slow and the rate of change between the two groups was comparable.\r"

  ".W": "We retrospectively analyzed 63 observations collected in nine French departments of dermatology of an acute pustular dermatosis, recently named in the French literature acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP). Even though 11 of these cases occurred in patients with a history of psoriasis, AGEP appeared distinct from pustular psoriasis based on several slight pathologic differences, drug induction in most cases, and a more acute course of fever and pustulosis, with rapid spontaneous healing. We, therefore, suggest that AGEP is a reaction pattern, perhaps favored by a \"psoriatic background.\" The most frequent causes of AGEP seem to be drug reactions, acute infections with enteroviruses, and hypersensitivity to mercury. With 55 (87%) of 63 cases attributed to drugs in this series, AGEP should be added to the list of cutaneous adverse drug reactions. Among drug-induced skin eruptions, AGEP is remarkable by its short time to onset after the administration of the suspected drug (less than 24 hours in half of our cases) and the great predominance (80%) of antibiotics as causative agents. It is suggested that some cases previously reported as \"drug-induced pustular psoriasis\" were in fact AGEP.\r"

They were classified into four subgroups on the basis of onset and morphologic pattern of disease: acute (von Zumbusch), subacute annular, chronic (acral), and mixed. This division provides a better understanding of the variability of the disease and helps in choosing treatment. OBSERVATIONS--The average age at onset was 50 years; male and female patients were affected about equally. In 11 patients, flares were precipitated by localized infections. Approximately one fourth of the patients had complications; most were superinfections. The average stay in the hospital was 30 days; factors correlating with a long hospitalization were hypocalcemia, female sex, and a previous history of psoriasis vulgaris or pustular psoriasis. CONCLUSIONS--Whereas topical therapy was helpful, systemic medications were often needed. Coal tar, ultraviolet light, and psoralen-ultraviolet A may be effective; however, they must be used with caution, because they may exacerbate the disease.\r"

Seven (13.2%) of 53 parents had clinically recognizable DNS. Twenty-six (36.1%) of the 72 sibs showed dysplastic nevi. The diagnosis of DNS in family members was based on mainly clinical examination; in eight family members--those with only mild manifestation of DNS--a nevus was removed for histologic confirmation. After correction for pedigree size, we found that 60% of patients with \"type A sporadic\" DNS actually had one or more relatives with a DNS phenotype. Only 25% (8/30) of the probands were ultimately true sporadic cases without a DNS-affected first- or second-degree relative. In 15% (5/31) of the probands no conclusions concerning the type of DNS could be made because the pedigree size did not allow such a conclusion. We also found a higher prevalence of dysplastic nevi among the younger generation as compared with the older generation in our probands with DNS and their families as well as in a general population study of 400 individuals. This generation-dependent difference in expression of the DNS phenotype suggests that besides a genetic factor, other factors may play a role in the development of the characteristic phenotype.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND.-The anticonvulsant hypersensitivity syndrome is characterized by the development of fever, rash, lymphadenopathy, and hepatitis, and is associated with leukocytosis and eosinophilia. This article describes the unusual development of a follicular pustular eruption in two patients as a manifestation of this syndrome. OBSERVATIONS.-This pustular eruption most commonly develops on the face and scalp but may subsequently become generalized. While cultures of the pustules are negative, biopsy specimens reveal a dilated follicular infundibulum filled with neutrophils. Recognition of cutaneous pustulation as a potential manifestation of this syndrome is important, as a generalized pustular eruption developing in a febrile patient can easily be confused with an infectious process. CONCLUSIONS.-The anticonvulsant hypersensitivity syndrome may present with a follicular pustular eruption rather than the more commonly associated macular or papular rash or erythroderma. The three most commonly used anticonvulsants, phenytoin, phenobarbital, and carbamazepine, can each produce an identical hypersensitivity reaction. In addition, in vitro testing has demonstrated that approximately 80% of patients tested to all three medications had positive reactions to each. Furthermore, with in vitro testing researchers are able to predict which anticonvulsants are safe to use, thereby allowing for prospective individualization of therapy. However, this technology is not yet available for widespread use.\r"

We describe a 49-year-old female patient with bullae in sites of grafts used in the treatment of toxic epidermal necrolysis. Generalized loss of skin developed 3 weeks after she had ingested phenobarbital. Sixty days after the beginning of the toxic epidermal necrolysis, the reepidermization was only 80% and skin grafts were placed on lower-extremity and abdominal wounds using the first healed sites as donor sites. Several bullae and erosions were noted on grafted areas 3 weeks later. Skin biopsy specimens revealed separation at the dermoepidermal junction, and no autoantibodies were detected by direct and indirect immunofluorescence. Electron microscopy demonstrated that the blister was formed through the basal keratinocytes and that the dermoepidermal junction, including hemidesmosomes and anchoring fibrils, was normal. Immunofluorescence mapping was performed using polyclonal antibodies from the serum of patients with bullous pemphigold and epidermolysis bullosa acquisita and monoclonal antibodies against GB3 antigen and collagen type VII. All but the bullous pemphigold serum gave positive results; only faint and focal staining of the dermoepidermal junction was observed with bullous pemphigold serum. These findings are the same as those encountered in hereditary epidermolysis bullosa simplex. A biopsy performed 1 year later in the same site as the first one revealed that bullous pemphigold antigen was normally expressed. Keratinocytes autografted in the treatment of toxic epidermal necrolysis may become transiently, functionally abnormal because of the alteration of recipient sites.\r"

DESIGN--Prospective postal questionnaire survey of a random one in two sample of general practitioners in the region. SETTING--The nine family practitioner committee areas within the Northern Regional Health Authority. PATIENTS--Patients who had had a myocardial infarction and were discharged to their general practitioner. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE--Whether beta blockers or aspirin, or both, were given on discharge. RESULTS--Of 267 patients, 158 (59%) were treated suboptimally in that they did not receive a secondary prophylactic drug to which they had no contraindication. For most patients this entailed underuse of one drug, but 17 (6%) of patients received no treatment. beta Blockers were 2.5 times less likely to be used than aspirin. Treatment was not associated with the age or sex of the patient, risk of further infarction, or hospital of discharge. CONCLUSIONS--Secondary prophylaxis after myocardial infarction is practised haphazardly. It should be offered to all patients who can tolerate it, after a trial period to assess any side effects of the drugs if necessary.\r"

All MAb were shown to bind to viral antigens on the surface of unfixed SIV-infected cells and to precipitate surface glycoproteins of SIVmac251. In Western blot 11 MAb bound to gp160 and gp120, five bound to gp160 and the transmembrane protein gp41 and two MAb did not react with denatured antigen. Preliminary competition assays identified the existence of six competition groups; two groups were within gp41 and four were within gp120. Of the latter four groups, three contained MAb with neutralizing activity. Two of the neutralizing MAb (KK5 and KK9) did not react with denatured antigen in Western blot suggesting that they may recognize conformational epitopes. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent-assay titres of MAb against SIVmac251 ranged from 10(2.4) to 10(5.6) and although similar titres were obtained with some MAb against other SIV and HIV antigens, the presence of isolate specific and shared group epitopes was demonstrated.\r"

  ".W": "Six men were selected from a large cohort of homosexual men participating in a study on HIV infection that was followed from seroconversion to AIDS. The patients were studied retrospectively for immunological functions of T cells, T-cell subset distribution and biological phenotype of HIV. A severe decrease in anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody (MAb)-induced T-cell proliferation at seroconversion was observed in two out of six men. After this acute phase, CD4+ T-cell numbers were in the normal range in the early asymptomatic period; the proliferative response was subnormal, whereas the capacity to generate cytotoxic T cells (CTL) was normal. From seroconversion on, CD4+CD29+ memory T-cell numbers were decreased to approximately 50% of normal values, which may contribute to loss of T-cell reactivity. In the asymptomatic phase only slow-replicating non-syncytium-inducing HIV variants were observed. The T-cell proliferative response further declined with the depletion of naive CD4+ CD45RA+ T cells and CD4+ T-cell numbers started to decline. This second decrease in T-cell function coincided with the emergence of more rapidly replicating, often (four out of six) syncytium-inducing variants. At diagnosis of AIDS, T-cell proliferation and CD4+ T-cell numbers were extremely low in five out of six patients and CTL function had declined in three out of five individuals tested. Circulating CD8+ cells had gradually shifted to an immature CD38+CD28- phenotype. Our findings support the theory that HIV-induced immune dysfunction allows for the emergence of virulent HIV variants associated with CD4+ cell loss and disease.\r"

  ".W": "During the latter half of 1989, HIV prevalence in South Australian prisoners was 1.4%. The prevalence of HIV infection across the prison system did not change significantly during 1989 but there was clustering of HIV-infected prisoners in some prisons. Almost half the prisoners from all of the South Australian prisons agreed to participate in our studies, from which we estimate that about 42% of prisoners engage in risk behaviours at least once while incarcerated. Prisoners estimated that 36% of all prisoners inject drugs intravenously at some stage during their stay and that 12% engage in anal intercourse at least once. Interviews with former prisoners who had a history of intravenous drug use revealed that about half had injected themselves while in prison, 60% shared needles and most did not clean shared needles adequately. Most of these prisoners injected themselves once a month or less frequently. The conditions for spread of HIV within the prison system exist but at the current prevalence of infection, transmission can be expected to be infrequent. The opportunity exists now to improve and expand preventive measures.\r"

Non-resident patients survived for a shorter period than resident patients (median survival time 10 versus 16 months). Residents had a 1-, 2- and 3-year survival of 56.1, 33.0 and 17.2%, respectively. Heterosexual intravenous drug users tended to have a better survival than homosexual men, although this was not significant. The survival time was longer for AIDS patients less than 30 years of age at diagnosis and varied for the different clinical manifestations leading to AIDS diagnosis. We calculated the 1- and 2-year survival probability by year of diagnosis for patients initially presenting with a Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP). The 1-year survival improved greatly in 1986 and continued to rise in the following years. The 2-year survival was similar in 1986 and 1987 (26.8 versus 28.2%) but increased in 1988 (38.9%). We conclude that besides better clinical experience and diagnostic methods, this improvement in prognosis could be explained by the start of secondary prophylaxis for PCP in 1985 and the introduction of zidovudine therapy in 1987.\r"

Specimens positive on enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for HIV-1 or HIV-2 were further characterized by synthetic peptide-based tests, and tested by HIV-1- and HIV-2-specific Western blots. Dual serologic reactivity on synthetic peptide tests was proportionately more frequent in HIV-positive TB patients than in blood donors, and HIV-2 reactivity less frequent. Positive HIV-1 Western blots were seen in 73-83% of specimens specifically characterized as positive for HIV-2 on synthetic peptide tests. Cross-reactivity to HIV-2 Western blots by HIV-1-positive specimens was significantly more frequent in TB patients (35%) than in asymptomatic donors (9%; P less than 0.001). Using recently recommended criteria for HIV-2 Western blot interpretation (presence of two env bands) reduced the overall proportion of HIV-1-positive specimens having a positive HIV-2 Western blot from 27.5 to 16.4%, suggesting minimal effect on sensitivity in the diagnosis of HIV-2 reactivity on specimens positive on synthetic peptide tests.\r"

In these patients KS was often the first manifestation of AIDS and showed an aggressive course.

Zidovudine concentrations were determined in plasma, unstimulated mixed saliva and citric-acid-stimulated mixed saliva over a period of 3 1/2 hours by high-performance liquid chromatography. Correlation coefficients were r = 0.97 (P less than 0.0001) for stimulated saliva compared with plasma and r = 0.89 (P less than 0.0001) for unstimulated saliva, with average values in unstimulated saliva being 113.8 +/- 44.6% in plasma and 67.8 +/- 25.4% in stimulated saliva. Stimulated saliva values found to be 70% of the total reflected the concentration of the unbound drug in plasma. Except for a shorter half-life time (t1/2) in saliva, pharmacokinetic parameters showed a good correlation in the three types of specimen. These findings and the convenience of sample collection suggest that citric-acid-stimulated saliva might be an appropriate specimen for monitoring zidovudine therapy.\r"

PMN activity in nitroblue tetrazolium reduction (NBT test) and PMN chemiluminescence (CL) was studied. Only one peptide was found to result in a significant increase in NBT test on the whole blood. This was the oligopeptide (G-97) from the CD4-binding site of HIV-1 gp120. The increase of CL response of PMN in the presence of G-97 was revealed after only 15 min preincubation. The same effect in the presence of sera from healthy or infected patients at the persistent generalized lymphadenopathy stage was achieved by increasing the time of preincubation to 30 min. G-97 did not influence the proliferative activity of lymphocytes.\r"

Using panels of serum samples from seronegative and confirmed HIV-1-seropositive individuals, it was shown that all the HIV-1-positive samples in a panel from The Netherlands and 97% of the HIV-1-positive samples from Tanzania were identified by this IEIA. Six per cent of the IEIA-positive samples from Tanzania could not be confirmed in other assays. Testing of serial dilutions of serum samples from African individuals with confirmed HIV-1, HIV-2 or HIV(ANI70) infections in the K14 IEIA, indicated that a HIV-1-specific assay based on this principle may be developed.\r"

  ".W": "Lower-eyelid malposition is one of the more serious complications encountered following lower-lid blepharoplasty, ranging in severity from mild lower-lid retraction to frank ectropion with marked lower-lid eversion. We define a grading system for postblepharoplasty lid malposition based on the severity of lower-lid retraction. In a critical review of 111 patients who underwent lower-lid blepharoplasty between January 1985 and January 1990, 15% were thought to have some degree of lower-lid retraction. Presence of lid laxity preoperatively and increasing amounts of skin excision at surgery were significant factors in the development of malposition. Placement of orbicularis suspension sutures tended to decrease the incidence of lid retraction. No patients had frank ectropion; however, three patients with grade 2 or 3 malposition required a secondary surgical procedure for correction. All three patients had resolution of their symptoms and good cosmetic results using standard treatment methods. A literature review and discussion of the causes, sequelae, and management of post-operative ectropion is presented as a reminder to surgeons performing blepharoplasty. Avoidance of this entity by appropriate preoperative assessment is emphasized, along with conservative operative technique. These factors combined are essential for the successful outcome of lower-lid blepharoplasty.\r"

The number of reports on its applications in the head and neck is limited. The rectus abdominis free flap is one of the most versatile soft-tissue flaps. The deep inferior epigastric artery and vein are long, large-diameter vessels that are ideal for microvascular anastomoses. The area of skin that can be transferred is probably the largest of all flaps presently in use. The versatility of this donor site is due to the ability to transfer large areas of skin with varying thicknesses and varying amounts of underlying muscle. We have successfully used this flap in 15 consecutive patients to reconstruct defects of the neck, face, mouth, pharynx, skull base, and scalp. No major complications involving either the recipient or donor sites occurred. The literature on the use of the rectus abdominis flap in head and neck reconstruction is reviewed in detail. The advantages and disadvantages of this soft-tissue free flap are thoroughly discussed in an effort to better define its proper place among the reconstructive options available to the head and neck surgeon.\r"

To assess the negative pressures needed to generate normal airflows across a narrowed vocal cord aperture, we measured pressure and flow changes across cadaveric larynges while altering aperture size. Best-fit quadratic equations for each aperture area selected were derived and showed that if the aperture were 0.5 cm2 or less, the resistance to normal breathing would be significantly increased. Aperture sizes of 0.67 cm2 or greater are not associated with such an increase in resistance.\r"

We reviewed a total of 210 children with late diagnosis of foreign body aspiration. The causes creating late diagnosis of foreign body aspiration in children were as follows: (1) parental negligence (106/210, 50%); (2) misdiagnosis by the fellow professionals and pediatricians (39/210, 19%); (3) the normal chest roentgenographic findings (29/210, 14%); (4) lack of typical symptoms and signs (26/210, 12%); (5) mismanagement (8/210, 4%); and (6) a negative bronchoscopic finding (2/210, 1%). The most common complications encountered were obstructive emphysema (77/186, 41%), mediastinal shift (63/186, 34%), pneumonia (43/186, 24%), and atelectasis (33/186, 18%) in 186 patients who underwent a chest roentgenographic examination. The incidence of major complications was 64% (48/75) in the children who were diagnosed within 4 to 7 days; however, the complication rate was 70% (39/56) in those with a delay in diagnosis of 15 to 30 days, and 95% (20/21) in the cases with a delay in diagnosis of over 30 days after aspirating the foreign bodies.\r"

The daily leak pressures, length of intubation, and ultimate outcome of attempts at extubation were noted. One hundred percent of patients with a leak pressure of less than 20 cm H2O on the day before extubation were successfully extubated. In contrast, the failure rate was 100% in children extubated with a leak of greater than 30 mm H2O. The difference between these two groups was statistically significant (chi 2, 13.03). Sixty percent of patients with leak pressures in the range of 21 to 30 cm H2O were successfully extubated. The endotracheal tube-leak pressure is a parameter that has prognostic value, and should be considered in determining when to extubate children who have undergone tracheal reconstructive surgery.\r"

Adult Hartley guinea pigs were employed. With intratympanic inoculation of 10(5) and 10(6) live S pneumoniae, the occurrence of pneumococcal otitis media significantly decreased in guinea pigs that received intraduodenal and intragastric immunization by enteric capsules. In these guinea pigs, the values of salivary IgA antibody titers against S pneumoniae were significantly greater, and histologic changes of the middle ear mucosa were also slighter than those of control guinea pigs. These findings indicate that oral vaccination by enteric capsules elicits mucosal IgA responses, as well as intraduodenal immunization, to prevent pneumococcal otitis media. These results suggest the possibility of clinical application of oral vaccination by enteric capsules for the prevention of middle ear infection.\r"

Perforations were found in 34 ears (18.7%) following removal or extrusion of the T tubes; in 13 (7.1%) of these patients, chronic perforations requiring tympanoplasties developed. The literature was screened for additional studies addressing the complications associated with tympanostomy tubes. The documented incidence of perforations between conventional tubes and Goode T tubes was emphasized, and comparisons were made. Our findings indicate that, even with the immediate placement of paper patches following removal of all Goode T tubes, the percentage of tympanic membrane perforations resulting from the use of Goode T tubes is significantly greater than previously reported.\r"

Freshly isolated tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes were deficient in CD4+ T cells in comparison with lymph node lymphocytes (LNL) and peripheral blood lymphocytes. A significantly higher CD4/CD8 ratio observed in LNL vs tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes and peripheral blood lymphocytes was attributable to both a significant enrichment in CD4+ T cells as well as a decrease in CD8+ T cells. The percentage of natural killer cells (CD3-CD56+) was uniformly low in both tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes and LNL. In patients with cervical metastases, LNL contained an increased proportion of CD16+ cells. Tumor-involved lymph nodes were not enriched in the CD8+C11b+ subset of T \"suppressor\" lymphocytes compared with uninvolved lymph nodes. Also, tumor-involved lymph nodes had significantly fewer CD4+ T cells than did uninvolved lymph nodes. In comparison with peripheral blood lymphocytes, freshly isolated tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes and LNL were depleted of cytotoxic effector cells, as indicated by low or absent cytotoxic activity against tumor cell targets. The ability to generate lymphokine-activated killer cells was significantly reduced in LNL in comparison with peripheral blood lymphocytes. In patients with head and neck cancer, depressed local and regional antitumor responses are associated with a deficiency of functional cytotoxic effector cells rather than an increase in suppressor T lymphocytes.\r"

These studies were based on observations of video film taken of patients with varying degrees of facial malfunction. Although the grading systems were evaluated, the use of videotape has never been compared with clinical examination and its suitability for this type of work is, therefore, unknown. We used nine facial grading systems to compare the results of clinical observation with those of photographic methods of presentation. The latter included videotape, photographic slides, and a combination of the two. The correlation between clinical examination findings and findings of any of the photographic methods was poor, suggesting the need for a standard form of presentation when grading patients. The most consistent results were found with either clinical examination or photographic slides; videotape was the least reliable.\r"

We report the first case of antral choanal polyp presenting as OSAS in a 10-year-old boy that initially presented to the child psychiatry service for behavior disturbance, enuresis, and daytime somnolence. Overnight electroencephalogram sleep study revealed events consistent with OSAS. Multiple inhalant allergies, chronic maxillary sinusitis, and obstructive adenoid hypertrophy were diagnosed by the allergy and otolaryngology services. The child was scheduled for adenoidectomy when his sleep apnea symptoms persisted following antimicrobial therapy. Examination under anesthesia revealed a normal adenoid bed and a large left antral choanal polyp. Polypectomy was performed as dictated by parental consent. Postoperatively treatment with an intranasal steroid was begun. However, polypoid nasal mucosa recurred in 2 months and a Caldwell-Luc procedure was performed. Subjective reports following surgery indicated improvement in daytime irritability, attention, and mood. A follow-up overnight electroencephalogram sleep study confirmed resolution of OSAS.\r"

Serial sections through both the decalcified graft and the junction between mandible and graft were evaluated in four patients who required surgical removal of their reconstructed mandibles. A failed scapular bone graft that had been wrapped within a pectoralis major myocutaneous flap for salvage following pedicle thrombosis showed markedly resorbed but viable bone with a fibrous union to the native mandible. Viable vascularized grafts without evidence of ongoing resorption characterized an iliac osteocutaneous bone graft and two scapula osteocutaneous grafts that healed with continuity of healthy bone between graft and mandible. Observations from the evaluation of these specimens are made regarding bone circulation, bone union, and bone graft survival as they occur clinically. Implications regarding the techniques of bone plating and indications for use of vascularized bone in mandible reconstruction are discussed.\r"

In noninflammatory lesions induced by antibody alone or C5b-9, the glomerular epithelial cell appears to be the principal target of injury. Similar mechanisms are probably operative in human diseases such as minimal change nephrotic syndrome and membranous nephropathy. In inflammatory lesions, circulating effector cells including neutrophils, macrophages, platelets, and probably lymphocytes as well as resident glomerular mesangial cells may mediate tissue injury. Human equivalents of these inflammatory lesions include most diseases associated with mesangial and/or subendothelial immune deposits and/or mesangial cell proliferation. Neutrophil-mediated injury appears to be consequent to both proteinases and oxidants, particularly the myeloperoxidase-H2O2-halide system. Platelets may be critically involved in neutrophil mediated injury as well. Platelets also mediate mesangial cell proliferation, probably by a release of platelet growth factors and stimulation of mesangial cell platelet-derived growth factor and platelet-derived growth factor receptor expression. Immunologically induced mesangial cell proliferation is associated with increased production of nephritogenic proteinase in vivo.\r"

In addition, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 is excreted in the bile as polar metabolites, such as glucuronides and, possibly sulfates and neutral polar steroids. These compounds undergo an enterohepatic recirculation in both man and experimental animals. 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 increases the absorption of calcium in the intestine and the reabsorption of calcium in the kidney. It induces the synthesis of several proteins, the most notable of which is calcium binding protein that is thought to play a role in the absorption of calcium. The vitamin D-dependent calcium binding proteins and the calcium-magnesium ATPase calcium pump are co-localized in several tissues that play a role in the absorption of calcium.\r"

  ".W": "Epidemiologic, experimental, and clinical studies suggest that potassium is an important regulator of blood pressure. Surveys conducted in widely divergent geographic locations indicate higher prevalence of hypertension in populations ingesting diets low in potassium. Amelioration of hypokalemia lowers blood pressure in mineralocorticoid-induced hypertension in rats and in essential hypertensive patients receiving thiazide diuretics. We observed that in normotensive subjects ingesting normal amounts of sodium, short-term potassium depletion increases the mean arterial pressure from 90.9 +/- 2.2 mm Hg to 95.0 +/- 2.2 mm Hg (P less than 0.01). Furthermore, acute sodium loading increases blood pressure in potassium-depleted subjects but it had no effect in subjects ingesting normal amounts of potassium. Preliminary studies indicate that short-term potassium depletion also elevates blood pressure in hypertensive patients. Potassium supplementation lowers blood pressure in hypertensive patients ingesting normal amounts of sodium. Blacks appear to be more sensitive to the hypotensive effects of potassium. The mechanism of potassium-induced changes in blood pressure is not well understood. Potassium depletion consistently induces sodium retention. The hypertensive effects of potassium depletion and hypotensive effects of potassium supplementation are not observed when sodium intake is kept low. Direct vasoconstrictive effects of hypokalemia may contribute to the pressor effect of potassium depletion. The role of altered vascular sensitivity to vasoactive hormones and alterations in divalent cation metabolism in mediating the potassium-induced changes in blood pressure require further study.\r"

First, humoral mechanisms may have important effects on cerebral blood vessels and blood flow to choroid plexus. Recent evidence suggests that several vasoactive peptides may have major effects on fluid and ion balance in the brain by altering blood flow to the choroid plexus and possibly the production of cerebrospinal fluid. Second, chronic hypertension produces structural remodeling and hypertrophy of cerebral blood vessels and a shift in the relationship of cerebral blood flow to systemic blood pressure. Third, endothelium-dependent responses of cerebral arterioles to receptor and nonreceptor mediated agonists are impaired during chronic hypertension. Alterations in endothelium-dependent responses of cerebral arterioles during chronic hypertension appears to be due to release of an endothelium-derived contracting factor.\r"

To assess whether chronic renal failure (CRF) impairs the adaptive responses to a low-protein diet, we measured nitrogen balance and the kinetics of infused L-(15N,1-13C)leucine during fasting and feeding. In six adult CRF and four control (C) subjects, 0.6 (LP) and 1.0 (HP) g protein kg-1 day-1 diets were compared. LP reduced feeding stimulated oxidation of leucine by 26% in CRF and 33% in C (P = NS). During fasting, oxidation was unaffected by diet or CRF. For both groups, feeding suppressed protein degradation to the same extent; leucine incorporation into protein did not change. Nitrogen balance during the two diets was the same with C and CRF, as was protein balance estimated from results of measured leucine kinetics. Thus, patients with CRF can activate appropriate adaptive responses to LP inasmuch as reduced amino acid oxidation occurring with feeding and estimates of protein balance did not differ from control.\r"

After control clearance periods, cyclosporine (0.6, 1.2, or 3 mg/min) or vehicle was infused over 5 min period in the renal artery and then four 10-min experimental periods followed. Cyclosporine, but not vehicle caused a dose dependent fall in renal perfusate flow associated with a concomitant increase in renal vascular resistance. Glomerular filtration rate was also decreased in parallel. We also examined whether endogenous endothelin mediates cyclosporine-induced acute renal vasoconstriction. In isolated kidneys pre-exposed to specific anti-endothelin antibody and then challenged with cyclosporine (1.2 mg/min) the renal perfusate flow, renal resistance, and glomerular filtration rate were 22.3 +/- 1.8 ml/min, 4.50 +/- 0.36 mmHg/ml.min-1, 1.06 +/- 0.05 ml/min, respectively, as compared with 12.9 +/- 1.2 ml/min, 7.8 +/- 1.2 mmHg/ml.min-1, 0.55 +/- 0.06 ml/min (P less than 0.01) measured in isolated kidneys pre-exposed to a non-immunized rabbit serum. The effectiveness and specificity of anti-endothelin antibody were confirmed by its capability of preventing the renal function deterioration caused by a single bolus dose (150 pmol) of synthetic endothelin, but not by infusion of angiotensin II, norepinephrine, or thromboxane A2 mimetic U-46619 in isolated kidneys. To test further the relationship between endogenous endothelin and cyclosporine-induced renal vasoconstriction, a second series of in vivo studies was performed in normal rats.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

No definite aneurysm was observed in any of the 96 patients. Small areas (2-4 mm) of contrast enhancement or signal void were detected in 11 patients. These areas are possibly due to vascular tortuosity, but the studies were considered to be indeterminate because a small aneurysm could not be ruled out. Cerebral angiography in two of these 11 patients was normal. Arachnoid cysts were observed more frequently in the patients with polycystic kidney disease than in a control group of patients matched by gender, age, and type and date of examination.\r"

We studied PTHmRNA levels and their regulation in control and subtotal nephrectomized (5/6 NX) rats at 3 wk, as well as levels of the 1,25(OH)2D3 receptor mRNA in parathyroids. Serum 1,25(OH)2D levels were decreased in 5/6 NX, whereas PTHmRNA levels were increased (7 +/- 0.7 OD U, N = 4) compared to controls (2.1 +/- 1.2, P less than 0.01); both decreased after 1,25(OH)2D3 (100 pmol/100 g body weight). Similar results were found in 5/6 NX rats after 3 months. There was no change in actin mRNA levels. PTHmRNA levels were highest in 5/6 NX rats with the most severe renal failure. The parathyroid gland 1,25(OH)2D3 receptor mRNA levels were not different between 5/6 NX rats and controls and were not affected by 1,25(OH)2D3 (100 pmol/100 g body weight daily) at 1 or 3 days. PTHmRNA levels of 5/6 NX rats did not increase when the serum calcium was decreased from 2.8 +/- 0.05 mmol/L to 0.9 +/- 0.15 mmol/L at 3 or 5 h, which contrasted with the marked increase in PTHmRNA in normal rats after hypocalcemia. As in normal rats, after hypercalcemia (4.8 mmol/L at 1 h) there was no change in the 5/6 NX rats' PTHmRNA levels. These results show that 5/6 NX rats have increased PTHmRNA levels that are normally regulated by injected 1,25(OH)2D3 but not by calcium. Parathyroid gland 1,25(OH)2D receptor mRNA levels are not increased in 5/6 NX in contrast to the increased PTHmRNA, which reflects the larger glands of uremia. 1,25(OH)2D receptor mRNA levels were not regulated by 1,25(OH)2D3.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Such studies have greatly expanded our understanding of autoimmune effector mechanisms and the nature of the target antigens recognized by these mediators. Another facet of organ-specific autoimmunity concerns the definition of those factors that determine host susceptibility to disease. This review outlines studies performed in two models of autoimmune interstitial nephritis that focus on issues of susceptibility and tolerance to parenchymal self antigens. In both models, antigen-specific regulatory T cells modulate the effector limb of the nephritogenic immune response and the pattern of interstitial injury. This modulation can be either stimulatory or inhibitory. The dominant regulatory effect is linked to genes in the major histocompatibility locus and is tightly correlated with disease expression. Regulatory T cells which inhibit the nephritogenic immune response can also be cultured in vitro and are highly efficacious as a therapeutic modality. These studies provide both the background and requisite reagents for delineating the mechanism(s) underlying antigen-specific T cell regulation.\r"

Transformation and adsorption of plasma proteins (such as complement) and activation of blood cells (such as neutrophils and monocytes) have been studied most extensively by nephrologists in recent years. There is no consensus on the definition of biocompatibility for dialyzer membranes. An operational definition of biocompatibility is the lack of any perturbation of blood constituents. According to this \"inert surface\" definition, a membrane (for example, one that adsorbs beta 2-microglobulin) can be considered as bioincompatible and yet desirable. Because of the multitude of blood-membrane interactions that may occur during hemodialysis, multiple criteria for biocompatibility needs to be applied in the classification of membranes. A certain bioincompatible phenomenon can be further classified as beneficial or deleterious depending on its biological effects as well as its acute and chronic impacts on the dialysis patient.\r"
