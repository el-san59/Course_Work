The preoperative CD4 lymphocyte count was decreased to an average of 336 x 10(9) per liter (range, 27 to 708 x 10(9) per liter). After twenty-six orthopaedic operations in patients who had no previous bacterial infection, a nosocomial infection (cellulitis in the forearm, at the site of an intravenous catheter) developed in only one patient, but five patients had an abnormal postoperative fever that was not accompanied by the expected increase in the white blood-cell count. The preoperative CD4 lymphocyte count was significantly reduced in the patients who had an abnormal elevation in body temperature (p less than 0.004). The functional result or outcome after operation was similar to that in hemophilic patients treated before 1982. Subsequent progression of infection with the human immunodeficiency virus, as determined by the CD4 lymphocyte count and the Walter Reed classification system, occurred in most patients. Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome was diagnosed in six patients. A more rapid progression to acquired immunodeficiency syndrome was seen in the patients who had a lower CD4 lymphocyte count preoperatively. Preoperative evaluation of the CD4 lymphocyte count and the response to intradermal skin-test antigens in patients who are at risk for infection postoperatively provides additional information concerning immunological competence. With these data, the possible risk of infection in patients who are seropositive for the human immunodeficiency virus can be estimated more accurately.\r"

Of the thirty patients, fifteen had been apprehensive when using the elbow, due to lateral instability, or had had pain in the elbow. In thirteen of these fifteen patients, the non-union was treated by osteosynthesis. Afterward, the pain and apprehension disappeared, but the range of motion of the elbow decreased in all but three patients. Three patients had clicking between the humerus and radius, and the bone failed to unite in three others. Osteosynthesis is indicated for the treatment of non-union of the lateral humeral condyle only if the patient has serious pain in the elbow or apprehension when using the elbow, due to lateral instability.\r"

A prospective study was done of seven additional patients who had continual monitoring of the pressure in the deep posterior compartment during tibial intramedullary nailing with reaming. In five of them, the procedure was performed three weeks or less after injury and in the remaining two, the nailing was performed later for the treatment of non-union. Two pressure peaks in the deep posterior compartment were noted: one after strong longitudinal traction was applied and the fracture was reduced and the other during intramedullary reaming. Intraoperative pressure of thirty millimeters of mercury or more were recorded in three of the seven patients. In the treatment of tibial fractures, operative procedures that involve forceful traction for a long time may predispose the patient to compartment syndrome in the leg. Close clinical observation of such patients is needed. When there is a high risk of compartment syndrome, monitoring of the pressure in the compartment may be prudent.\r"

The predominant indications for conversion were progressively disabling pain in the low back or the hip, or both; loss of function due to immobility or malposition of the hip; and progressive pain and instability of the knee (usually ipsilateral). The postoperative arc of flexion averaged 87 degrees. Limb-length discrepancies improved an average of 2.5 centimeters. Postoperative function of the abductor muscles depended on the preoperative quality of those muscles and on the accuracy of the biomechanical restoration. Postoperative strength of the muscles of the hip improved for two years or more in most patients. There was complete or major relief of pain, improved mobility of the hip, and decreased dependence on supports for walking. There were nine failures: four because of sepsis, four because of loosening of the femoral component, and one because of malposition of the acetabular component. The failures were predominantly in patients who were fifty years old or less at the time of arthroplasty, patients who had had two or more previous operations, and patients who had had an injury to the hip. The quality of the results approached that after primary hip arthroplasty in older patients who have not had multiple previous operations on the hip. Survivorship analysis of the spontaneously fused hips that were treated with conventional hip replacement predicted a probability of survival of the implant of 96 per cent at thirteen years postoperatively (p = 0.048).\r"

The thickened distal fascicle was resected without loss of stability of the ankle. Five patients needed debridement of an area of abraded hyaline cartilage on the anterolateral aspect of the talus. Six patients were followed for a mean of thirty-nine months (range, twenty-four to fifty-nine months). Four of them had no pain in the ankle or limitation in activities, and two reported marked improvement, with only occasional pain in the ankle related to overuse. A separate distal fascicle of the anteroinferior tibiofibular ligament is present in most human ankles and can be a cause of talar impingement, abrasion of the articular cartilage, and pain in the anterior aspect of the ankle. Resection of this ligament usually will alleviate the pain caused by the impingement.\r"

The regimens of preoperative and postoperative chemotherapy varied. The patterns of relapse and long-term survival were studied in relation to the skip lesions, and these patterns were compared with those of 224 patients who had Stage-II osteosarcoma but no skip lesion. Of the twenty-three patients who had a skip lesion, twenty-two had either a local recurrence or a distant metastasis; twenty-two patients died, and one remained disease-free at thirty-eight months. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed significant differences in the rates of local recurrence and distant metastasis (Mantel-Cox test statistic, p less than 0.0001) and in the over-all survival (Mantel-Cox test statistic, p less than 0.0001) between the patients who had and those who did not have skip metastasis. The cases of fourteen patients who had skip metastasis from a lesion in the distal end of the femur were compared with those of eighty-seven patients who had a similarly situated primary lesion but no skip metastasis. The difference was significant, although less so than when lesions in all anatomical sites were analyzed. The follow-up data indicated that the use of adjuvant chemotherapy did not improve the poor prognosis of patients who had skip metastasis. Therefore, we regard a skip lesion, along with regional lymphatic metastasis or metastasis to a distant organ, as another criterion for considering an osteosarcoma to be Stage III.\r"

The most common secondary compression was carpal tunnel syndrome (forty-one cases). Thirteen patients needed an operation at three sites or more. Our results show that proximal compression of a nerve lessens its ability to withstand more distal compression. Once the diagnosis of thoracic-outlet syndrome has been made, the possibility of an additional distal compression neuropathy should be investigated.\r"

The magnetic resonance image did not show avascular necrosis of the femoral head in any of the patients. In eleven patients, there was a decreased signal at the base of the femoral head, immediately adjacent to the fracture. This decreased signal corresponded to a recognized band of necrosis and hemorrhage next to the site of the fracture and was not related to the viability of the femoral head. No other changes were seen on the images. We concluded that this type of magnetic resonance imaging is inadequate to determine the viability of the femoral head within forty-eight hours after a patient sustains an acute intracapsular fracture of the femoral neck.\r"

Experiments with immobilized CETP have shown that upon incubation with plasma or HDL in the presence of Tween (0.05%) apo A-I (but not apo A-II) binds to CETP while TP-2 binding to CETP is concomitantly decreased. With high detergent concentration (0.5% Triton), the interference is eliminated and a specific RIA in which all plasma CETP fractions have the same affinity can be obtained. Plasma levels of CETP, apo A-I, lipids, and lipoproteins were measured in 50 normolipemic, healthy subjects of both sexes. CETP levels varied nearly fourfold with a mean value of 1.7 micrograms/ml. CETP was positively correlated only with apo A-I (r = 0.38) and HDL-triglyceride (r = 0.39). In 29 other normolipemic subjects, where several apolipoproteins were also measured, significant correlations of CETP with apo A-I (0.41), apo E (0.43), and HDL-cholesterol (0.41) were observed, but there was no significant relationship between CETP and either apo A-II, B, or D. In other experiments CETP was shown to be present mostly in HDL3 and VHDL, to display exclusively an alpha 2-electrophoretic migration, and to occur within discrete particles ranging in size from 129 to 154 kD. In conclusion, the association of CETP with apo A-I-containing lipoproteins probably explains the correlation between CETP and apo A-I levels. The relationship between CETP and apo E suggests either a common metabolism or a specific cooperative role in cholesterol ester transport for these proteins.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of beta-adrenergic agonists on ATP utilization and adenine nucleotide breakdown in human adipocytes were examined. The catecholamine-induced increase in cAMP was associated with an enhancement of adenine nucleotide catabolism resulting in an increase in release of inosine and hypoxanthine which can not be reutilized for adenine nucleotide synthesis. Therefore, one-third of total cellular adenine nucleotides were irreversibly lost in the presence of 1 mumol/liter isoproterenol. The catecholamine-induced increase in purine release could be blocked by phosphodiesterase inhibitors, suggesting that cAMP is the main precursor of purines in the presence of beta-adrenergic agonists. However, epinephrine (in the simultaneous presence of the alpha 2-adrenergic blocking agent, yohimbine) and isoproterenol were 10 times more potent in stimulating purine release than in elevating cAMP. In addition, purine release ceased when cAMP was still markedly increased, suggesting a compartmentation of the cyclic nucleotide and/or involvement of the hormone-sensitive, low Km cAMP phosphodiesterase. The results document that white fat cells have an enormous potential for dissipating energy, and demonstrate that the pathway involving cAMP formation and hydrolysis constitutes the principle route of adenine nucleotide catabolism in the presence of beta-adrenergic agonists.\r"

  ".W": "IL-6 is a cytokine with a number of biological functions, including stimulation of immunoglobulin synthesis and proliferation of early hematopoietic stem cells. We showed that lymphotoxin stimulated accumulation of IL-6 mRNA in human fibroblasts (W138) in a dose-responsive fashion; tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) was about threefold more potent than lymphotoxin. Further experiments suggested that stimulation by lymphotoxin was independent of protein kinase C activity, did not require new protein synthesis, and was at least in part a result of increased stabilization of IL-6 mRNA. t1/2 of the IL-6 transcripts increased from 0.3 h in unstimulated cells to 0.85 h in cells stimulated with lymphotoxin. In addition, stimulators of protein kinase C, including phorbol esters and teleocidin, enhanced accumulation of IL-6 mRNA. Cycloheximide (CHX), inhibitor of protein synthesis, also markedly increased levels of IL-6 mRNA. Both CHX and activators of protein kinase C increased by greater than 16-fold the stability of IL-6 mRNA. Further, dose-response studies showed that sodium fluoride (NaF), activator of G-binding proteins, and ouabain, inhibitor of Na+/H+ pump, increased levels of IL-6 mRNA. NaF stimulated IL-6 mRNA levels independent of protein kinase C activity. These results suggest that stimulators of several pathways of signal transduction increase levels of IL-6 mRNA and posttranscriptional stabilization is, in part, the mechanism that many of these signals, including lymphotoxin, use to increase levels of IL-6 RNA.\r"

Stimulation of CD5 allows CD3-mediated production of inositol phosphates to be sustained at a brisk rate for greater than 20 min and augments the initial CD3-mediated increase in inositol trisphosphate and release of intracellular Ca2+. Thus, perturbation of CD5 by monoclonal antibody enhances the ability of the CD3-antigen receptor complex to couple to the inositol phospholipid pathway. This effect of CD5 is independent of any direct effect of the CD5 monoclonal antibody on the levels of inositol phosphates.\r"

Metaphase cells of phytohemagglutinin-stimulated T-lymphocytes from eight individuals who are obligate heterozygotes for XP were compared with those from nine normal controls at 1.3, 2.3, and 3.3 h after x-irradiation (58 R) during the G2 phase of the cell cycle. Lymphocytes from the XP heterozygotes had twofold higher frequencies of chromatid breaks or chromatid gaps than normal (P less than 10(-5)) when fixed at 2.3 or 3.3 h after irradiation. Lymphocytes from six XP homozygotes had frequencies of breaks and gaps threefold higher than normal. Skin fibroblasts from an additional obligate XP heterozygote, when fixed approximately 2 h after x-irradiation (68 R), had a twofold higher frequency of chromatid breaks and a fourfold higher frequency of gaps than fibroblasts from a normal control. This frequency of aberrations in cells from the XP heterozygote was approximately half that observed in the XP homozygote. The elevated frequencies of chromatid breaks and gaps after G2 phase x-irradiation may provide the basis of a test for identifying carriers of the XP gene(s) within known XP families.\r"

Decarboxylated amine derivatives of amino acids have been proposed as the final common mediators of gastrin secretion stimulated by a meal. We explored the cellular basis for this hypothesis using a recently developed isolated canine G-cell model. Both amino acids and, more potently, their corresponding amines, directly stimulated gastrin release. Amino acid-stimulated gastrin secretion was unaffected by decarboxylase inhibitors (alpha methyldopa, aminooxyacetic acid, and 4-deoxypyridoxine) but enhanced by bombesin, isobutylmethylxanthine, and dibutyryl cAMP. Somatostatin inhibited amino acid-stimulated gastrin release via a pertussis toxin-sensitive GTP-binding protein. In contrast, gastrin secretion induced by amines was unaltered by any of the various treatments. Our data indicate that amino acids and amines, either as primary constituents of an ingested meal or as metabolites of dietary proteins, act directly via separate mechanisms to stimulate gastrin secretion from G-cells.\r"

We used sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting to identify immunologically active molecules in the cell wall of B. dermatitidis. A major immunoreactive 120-kD protein (WI-1) was present in all five strains studied and comprised 5% of the protein in the cell wall extract obtained after freezing and thawing yeast cells. WI-1 was recognized by serum from all 10 patients with blastomycosis but by none of those from 5 patients with histoplasmosis. It was purified by electroelution, radiolabeled with 125I, and incorporated into a radioimmunoassay (RIA) for serodiagnosis of blastomycosis. Antibody to WI-1 was detected in 58 (85%) of 68 patients with blastomycosis (geometric mean titer, 1:2,981), in two (3%) of 73 patients with histoplasmosis, coccidioidomycosis, sporotrichosis, or candidiasis (titers, 1:86 and 1:91) and in none of 44 healthy persons. WI-1 was shown to be a surface molecule abundant on B. dermatitidis yeasts that were indirectly stained with serum from a rabbit immunized with WI-1. Approximately 0.93 pg of WI-1 or 4.7 x 10(6) WI-1 molecules were found on the surface of an individual yeast using an antigen-inhibition RIA; none was found on Histoplasma capsulatum or Candida albicans yeasts. We conclude that WI-1 is a novel, immunologically active surface molecule on the invasive form of B. dermatitidis and that WI-1 can be used to reliably detect antibody and study the immunopathogenesis of blastomycosis.\r"

There are at least two enzymes that hydrolyze imidodipeptides in these cells and these two enzymes could be separated by an immunochemical procedure. The specific assay for prolidase showed that the enzyme activity was virtually absent in six cell strains and was markedly reduced in two (less than 3% of controls). The activities of the labile enzyme that did not immunoprecipitate with the anti-prolidase antibody were decreased in the cells (30-60% of controls). Cell strains with residual activities of prolidase had immunological polypeptides crossreacting with a Mr 56,000, similar to findings in the normal enzyme. The polypeptide biosynthesis in these cells and the controls was similar. Northern blot analyses revealed the presence of mRNA in the polypeptide-positive cells, yet it was absent in the polypeptide-negative cells. The substrate specificities analyzed in the partially purified enzymes from the polypeptide-positive cell strains differed, presumably due to different mutations. Thus, there seems to be a molecular heterogeneity in prolidase deficiency. There was no apparent relation between the clinical symptoms and the biochemical phenotypes, except that mental retardation was present in the polypeptide-negative patients. The activities of the labile enzyme may not be a major factor in modifying the clinical symptoms.\r"

Recent studies have suggested that DQB1 of humans and I-A beta of mice are closely associated with susceptibility and resistance to IDDM. For further characterization and localization of the MHC-linked diabetogenic gene, we studied the genomic sequence of the A beta gene of the nonobese diabetic (NOD) mouse, an animal model of IDDM, in comparison with those of its sister strains, nonobese nondiabetic and cataract Shionogi (CTS) mice, and the original strain, outbred Imperial Cancer Research (ICR) mice. Genomic DNAs from these strains were amplified in vitro by the polymerase chain reaction with thermostable Taq polymerase. The amplified sequences were analyzed by restriction endonuclease digestion, hybridization with allele-specific oligonucleotide probes, and direct sequencing. The unique I-A beta sequence of NOD mice was observed in the sister strain, CTS mice, and in one mouse of the original strain, outbred ICR mice. These data together with the results of MAb typing of MHC molecules and restriction mapping of the I-A region suggest that the unique class II MHC of NOD mice is not the result of a recent mutation, but is derived from the original strain. Since class I MHC of CTS mice is different from the MHC of NOD mice at both the K and D loci, CTS mice are a naturally occurring recombinant strain with NOD type class II MHC and non-NOD type class I MHC. Thus, breeding studies in crosses of NOD with CTS mice should provide biological information on whether the unique class II MHC of NOD mice is diabetogenic.\r"

  ".U": "90110478\r", 
  ".W": "A population of circulating mononuclear cells from patients with AIDS was identified which expressed interleukin 2 receptors (IL-2R). By dual-fluorescence flow microfluorometry, the patients' IL-2R+ cells were further identified as Leu M3+ monocytes (29.4 +/- 5.2% of the Leu M3+ cells were IL-2R+, n = 15), whereas Leu M3+ monocytes from normal subjects were IL-2R negative (2.0 +/- 0.42%; P less than 0.001). By Northern analysis, monocytes from AIDS patients, but not control subjects, constitutively expressed steady-state levels of IL-2R mRNA. Functionally, the IL-2R+ monocytes were capable of depleting IL-2 from culture supernatants, suggesting a mechanism for the reduced IL-2 levels commonly seen in AIDS patients. IL-2R+ monocytes also expressed increased levels of surface HLA-DR which may favor monocyte T-cell interactions and the transmission of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). In additional studies, normal monocytes were infected with a macrophage-tropic HIV isolate in vitro and monitored for IL-2R and HLA-DR expression. Within 24-48 h after exposure to HIV in vitro, but before evidence of productive infection, greater than 25% of the monocytes became IL-2R+ with increasing numbers of IL-2R+ cells and HLA-DR levels through day 6. These early signaling effects of HIV could be mimicked by adding purified HIV envelope glycoprotein gp120 to the monocytes. This stimulation of monocytes before or independent of productive infection of the cells by HIV is consistent with in vivo observations of activated and/or abnormal functions by monocytes that do not appear to be infected with HIV in AIDS patients.\r"

In this study, we provide evidence that two polypeptides designated L2 and L4 are structurally related and represent novel markers for common ALL. Partial amino acid sequence analysis did not uncover differences between L2 and L4. The sequences obtained correspond to a previously cloned human gene designated hsp 27 that is expressed, following heat shock treatment, in a variety of cells. 32Pi incorporation studies indicate that L4 is an unphosphorylated form and L2 is a phosphorylated form of hsp27. The two forms were inducible by heat shock in leukemic and nonleukemic lymphoid cells. Thus, in acute leukemia, the common ALL subtype is uniquely characterized by the constitutive expression of a polypeptide that represents a major cellular phosphoprotein.\r"

Since clearance of encapsulated bacteria is determined by phagocytosis of bacteria by fixed tissue macrophages, we studied the interaction of H. influenzae type b with macrophages in vitro. Organisms bound to macrophages in the presence of nonimmune serum. Binding was not evident in heat-treated serum or in serum from complement depleted animals and was inhibited by F(ab')2 fragments of antibody to C3 and by blockade of the macrophage complement receptor type 3. The majority of organisms bound in the presence of complement alone remained extracellular. Antibody in the form of convalescent serum or an IgG1 monoclonal to type b capsule did not increase the total number of organisms associated with macrophages, but did increase the number of organisms ingested. Furthermore, complement enhanced antibody-mediated ingestion. This in vitro study demonstrates that complement largely mediates binding of H. influenzae to macrophages. This binding may be critical in determining the early clearance of these bacteria from blood and may be an important mechanism of defense in the nonimmune, as well as the immune host.\r"

  ".W": "In dietary phosphate (Pi) deprivation and in aging there is an inverse correlation between renal proximal tubular brush border membrane (BBM) cholesterol (Chol) content, BBM fluidity, and BBM sodium gradient-dependent Pi transport activity (Na-Pi cotransport). The purpose of this study was to determine whether in vitro enrichment of renal BBM with Chol has a direct modulating effect on Na-Pi cotransport. 12 and 24 mol % increases in Chol content caused dose-dependent decreases in Na-Pi cotransport activity, 2,000 in control, vs. 1,450 in Chol (+12%), vs. 900 pmol/5 s/mg BBM protein in Chol (+24%), all P less than 0.01, which was paralleled by dose-dependent increases in the fluorescence anisotropy of diphenylhexatriene, rDPH, i.e., decrease in BBM fluidity, 0.203 in control, vs. 0.210 in Chol (+12%), vs. 0.219 in Chol (+24%), all P less than 0.01. We found that increasing ambient temperature, which increases BBM fluidity independent of changes in Chol content, increased Na-Pi cotransport. When Na-Pi cotransport was analyzed as a function of BBM fluidity, 1/rDPH, we found that at an equivalent BBM fluidity BBM Chol enrichment still resulted in a dose-dependent decrease in Na-Pi cotransport. Finally, in BBM isolated from rats fed a low Pi diet in vitro enrichment with Chol completely reversed the adaptive increases in Na-Pi cotransport and fluidity. Our study therefore, indicates that Chol is a direct modulator of renal BBM Na-Pi cotransport activity, and that in vivo alterations in BBM Chol content most likely plays an important role in the regulation of renal tubular Pi transport.\r"

In particular, the role of CD5+ B cells in human SLE, a distinct subpopulation of antibody-secreting cells shown previously to be a source of anti-DNA antibody in murine models of SLE, is unknown. To approach these questions, we developed a sensitive enzyme-linked immunospot (ELIspot) assay to measure spontaneous secretion of antibody to single-stranded (ss) DNA, double-stranded (ds) DNA, tetanus toxoid, and polyclonal immunoglobulin (Ig) by purified CD5+ and CD5- B cells of 15 SLE patients and 15 healthy control subjects. The B cells of only 1 of 15 healthy subjects secreted a significant level of anti-ssDNA antibody, and none secreted anti-dsDNA. By contrast, in the majority of SLE patients both CD5+ and CD5- B cells secreted IgG and/or IgM anti-ssDNA as well as anti-dsDNA antibody. Further analysis of the anti-ssDNA response revealed that the level of IgG and IgM anti-DNA antibody secretion by CD5- B cells correlated closely with the level of polyclonal Ig production by the same subpopulation (r = 0.81 and 0.70, respectively). In contrast, production of anti-DNA by CD5+ B cells occurred independently of polyclonal Ig production by both CD5+ and CD5- B cell subpopulations. These results suggest that in human SLE there exist two anti-DNA antibody-producing B cell subpopulations with distinct induction mechanisms: one (CD5+), which independently secretes anti-DNA, and another (CD5-), which produces anti-DNA as an apparent consequence of polyclonal B cell activation.\r"

Since tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF alpha) is elevated in cachexia-associated diseases, and chronic administration of TNF alpha induces cachexia in animal models, we assessed the regulation of albumin gene expression by TNF alpha in vivo. In this animal model of cachexia, Chinese hamster ovary cells transfected with the functional gene for human TNF alpha were inoculated into nude mice (TNF alpha mice). TNF alpha mice became cachectic and manifested decreased serum albumin levels, albumin synthesis, and albumin mRNA levels. However, even before the TNF alpha mice lost weight, their albumin mRNA steady-state levels were decreased approximately 90%, and in situ hybridization revealed a low level of albumin gene expression throughout the hepatic lobule. The mRNA levels of several other genes were unchanged. Hepatic nuclei from TNF alpha mice before the onset of weight loss were markedly less active in transcribing the albumin gene than hepatic nuclei from control mice. Therefore, TNF alpha selectively inhibits the genetic expression of albumin in this model before weight loss.\r"

  ".W": "Proximal duodenal bicarbonate secretion is an important factor in humans and animals protecting the mucosa against acid-peptic damage. This study examined the mechanisms responsible for the central nervous system regulation of duodenal bicarbonate secretion by calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) in unrestrained rats. Cerebroventricular administration of rat CGRP significantly inhibited basal duodenal bicarbonate secretion as well as the stimulatory effects of vasoactive intestinal peptide, neurotensin, a luminal PGE1 analogue, misoprostol, and hydrochloric acid. The inhibitory effects of cerebroventricular CGRP were abolished by ganglionic blockade with chlorisondamine, significantly attenuated by noradrenergic blockade with bretylium, and enhanced by vagotomy. Inhibition of duodenal bicarbonate secretion induced by CGRP coincided with significant increases in plasma norepinephrine (NE) and vasopressin concentrations. The alpha adrenergic receptor antagonist, phentolamine, and the vasopressin V1 receptor antagonist, (1-deaminopenicillamine, 2-[O-methyl]Tyr, 8-Arg)-vasopressin, given intravenously reversed the central inhibitory effect of CGRP by approximately 50% each. Pretreatment of the animals with both phentolamine and the vasopressin antagonist completely abolished the central inhibitory effect of CGRP. Peripheral vasopressin and NE significantly decreased duodenal bicarbonate secretion, and their inhibitory effects were additive and prevented by phentolamine and the vasopressin antagonist, respectively. We conclude that cerebroventricular CGRP inhibits rat duodenal bicarbonate secretion by activation of sympathetic efferents and subsequent release of NE and vasopressin that act on alpha adrenergic and vasopressin receptors, respectively.\r"

Differential loading characteristics of the pH sensitive dye 2',7'-bis-(2-carboxyethyl)-5(and-6)carboxyfluorescein (BCECF) and basolateral Cl- removal were used to identify and study intracellular pH (pHi) regulation in each of three cell types involved in this transport. Both principal cells and beta-intercalated cells were found to have a basolateral Na+/H+ exchanger based on the Na+ and amiloride sensitivity of pHi recovery from acid loads. Intercalated cells demonstrated abrupt pHi changes with basolateral Cl- removal. alpha-intercalated cells alkalinized; beta-intercalated cells acidified. In the beta-intercalated cells, luminal Cl- removal blocked changes in pHi in response to changes in luminal HCO3- or peritubular Cl-, providing direct evidence for a luminal Cl-/HCO3- exchanger. In principal cells, brief removal of either peritubular or luminal Cl- resulted in no change in pHi; however, return of peritubular Cl- after prolonged removal resulted in a rapid fall in pHi consistent with a basolateral Cl-/HCO3- exchanger, which may be relatively inactive under baseline conditions. Therefore, Cl-/HCO3- exchange is present in all three cell types but varies in location and activity.\r"

  ".U": "90110490\r", 
  ".W": "Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) is a heterogeneous disorder of type I collagen of which OI type I, an autosomal dominant condition, is the mildest and most common form. Affected individuals have blue sclerae, normal stature, bone fragility without significant deformity and osteopenia. Fibroblasts from most affected individuals produce about half the expected amount of structurally normal type I collagen as a result of decreased synthesis of one of its constituent chains, pro alpha 1(I), but the nature of the mutations which result in OI type I are unknown. We describe a three generation family with OI type I in which all affected members have one normal COL1A1 allele and another from which the intragenic Eco RI restriction site near the 3' end of the gene is missing. Amplification by polymerase chain reaction and sequence determination of the normal allele and of the mutant allele in the domain that normally contains the Eco RI site demonstrated a 5-bp deletion from the mutant allele. The deletion changes the translational reading-frame beginning at the Eco RI site and predicts the synthesis of a pro alpha 1(I) chain that extends 84 amino acids beyond the normal termination. Although the mutant pro alpha 1(I) chain is synthesized in an in vitro translation system, we are unable to detect its presence in intact cells, suggesting that it is unstable and rapidly destroyed in one of the cell's degradative pathways. Our analysis of individuals with OI type I from 20 families indicates that this is a unique mutation and suggests that the phenotype can result from multiple mechanisms that decrease the synthesis of normal type I procollagen molecules, including those that alter protein stability.\r"

We have previously shown that the autoantibodies in these patients are pathogenic and restricted mainly to the IgG4 subclass. The purpose of this study was to determine if the Fc domain or the valence of FS autoantibodies were relevant in the induction of epidermal disease in neonatal mice. IgG4 was prepared from sera of FS patients by anion exchange chromatography, and digested with pepsin to yield F(ab')2 fragments. Monovalent FS Fab' were made by reduction and alkylation of FS F(ab')2. Intact FS IgG4, FS F(ab')2, and FS Fab' fragments were injected into neonatal mice. Intact FS IgG4 and both FS IgG fragments were pathogenic. The disease in the animals was dose dependent, and on the molar basis, FS Fab' fragments were more potent and efficient in producing disease than whole FS IgG. These results suggest: (a) simple binding of FS autoantibodies to DG-I may trigger keratinocyte detachment and epidermal disease; (b) DG-I may represent a keratinocyte cell adhesion molecule; and (c) complement activation and surface cross-linking may not be relevant in keratinocyte detachment.\r"

To determine if such a deficit occurs in human end-stage heart failure, we compared the SR Ca2(+)-ATPase mRNA levels in left (LV) and right ventricular (RV) specimens from 13 patients undergoing cardiac transplantation (6 idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathies; 4 coronary artery diseases with myocardial infarctions; 3 diverse etiologies) with control heart samples using a rat cardiac SR Ca2(+)-ATPase cDNA probe. We observed a marked decrease in the mRNA for the Ca2(+)-ATPase relative to both the 18S ribosomal RNA and the myosin heavy chain mRNA in LV specimens of patients with heart failure compared to controls (-48%, P less than 0.01 and -47%, P less than 0.05, respectively). The LV ratio of Ca2(+)-ATPase mRNA to 18S RNA positively correlated with cardiac index (P less than 0.02). The RV ratio correlated negatively with systolic, diastolic and mean pulmonary arterial pressures (P less than 0.02, P less than 0.02, and P less than 0.01, respectively). We suggest that a decrease of the SR Ca2(+)-ATPase mRNA in the myocardium plays an important role in alterations of Ca2+ movements and myocardial relaxation reported during human end-stage heart failure.\r"

Associations between HLA class II antigens and autoantibodies to the ribonucleoproteins Ro(SSA) and La(SSB) have been reported in these patients. Because HLA class II molecules present antigen to T cell receptors (TCRs), we have searched for a TCR gene associated with the production of anti-Ro(SSA) antibodies. A pair of restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs), one of which hybridizes to the TCR constant region C beta 1 and the other to the C beta 2 gene, has been identified, suggesting these may be genotypic markers for an extended region of the TCR beta locus. This RFLP pair occurs in 76% of patients with Ro(SSA) precipitins, 84% of anti-Ro(SSA)-positive patients lacking La(SSB) precipitins, but only 41% of the patients lacking both precipitins (P = 0.0004). This disproportionate occurrence in a subset of lupus patients indicates that these RFLPs are not disease susceptibility markers, but rather are important markers for TCR genes whose products are involved in the production of anti-Ro(SSA) antibodies. The majority of patients who have these RFLPs and HLA class II antigens previously associated with the anti-Ro(SSA) response make this antibody, suggesting that interactions between products of these loci occur in response to Ro(SSA).\r"

Western blot analysis of cytoplasmic extracts from Rauscher murine erythroleukemia cells and phenylhydrazine-treated mouse splenic erythroid cells revealed the presence of several PDGF-like proteins. The presence of PDGF-like proteins in the cytoplasm of these two erythroid cell types was confirmed by immunohistochemical staining. Using a serum-free biologic assay, PDGF-like biological activity was found in cell lysates and conditioned medium of both Rauscher cells and phenylhydrazine-treated mouse erythroid cells. Subcellular localization experiments revealed the biological activity to be concentrated in the cytosolic fraction. Using a series of antibodies to hematopoietic growth factors we demonstrated that PDGF-like biological activity was specifically immunoprecipitated by both monoclonal and polyclonal anti-human PDGF antibodies but not by antibodies to burst-promoting activity, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, IL-3, or erythropoietin. Taken together, the data are consistent with the hypothesis that PDGF-like molecules play a role in the regulation of mammalian erythropoiesis in vivo.\r"

To further investigate the nature of the DAF defect in affected cells, patients' polymorphonuclear and mononuclear leukocytes (PMN and MNC) were biosynthetically labeled and newly synthesized DAF proteins examined. Analyses of greater than 98% surface DAF-negative PMN and MNC from a patient with PNH III erythrocytes showed precursor DAF protein approximately 3 kD smaller in each cell type than in normal cells. The proportion of precursor to mature (O-glycosylated) DAF protein was increased and soluble DAF protein was detected in the medium. Studies of 70-80% surface DAF-negative PMN and MNC from four patients with type II erythrocytes showed mixtures of the 3 kD smaller and normal DAF precursors. Partitioning with Triton X-114 detergent and biosynthetic labeling with the anchor precursor [3H]ethanolamine indicated that the abnormal peptides lacked glycosyl-inositolphospholipid membrane-anchoring structures. Thus, in PNH cells nascent DAF polypeptides are synthesized. Some of the abnormal pro-DAF molecules are processed in the Golgi and some are released extracellularly.\r"

Oxygen saturation was reduced to 65-74% for 2 wk. Eight lambs served as normoxemic controls. beta-receptor density (Bmax) and ligand affinity (KD) were determined with the radio-ligand [125I]iodocyanopindolol and adenylate cyclase activity determined during stimulation with isoproterenol, sodium fluoride (NaF), and forskolin. During chronic hypoxemia, Bmax decreased 45% (hypoxemic, 180.6 +/- 31.5 vs. control, 330.5 +/- 60.1 fmol/mg) in the left ventricle (exposed to hypoxemia alone) but was unchanged in the right ventricle (exposed to hypoxemia and pressure overload). KD was not different from control in either ventricle. Left ventricular isoproterenol-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity was decreased by 39% (30.0 +/- 4.3% increase vs. 44.1 +/- 9.5% increase) whereas right ventricular adenylate cyclase activity was unchanged. Stimulation of adenylate cyclase with NaF or forskolin was not different from control in either ventricle. Circulating epinephrine was increased fourfold whereas circulating and myocardial norepinephrine were unchanged. These data demonstrate a down-regulation of the left ventricular beta-adrenergic receptor/adenylate cyclase system during chronic hypoxemia secondary to an intracardiac right-to-left shunt.\r"

Positive anti-Sm antibody enhancement occurred efficiently only in MRL/lpr mice and not in other systemic lupus erythematosus mice that have little spontaneous anti-Sm production. The enhancement by anti-Sm antibodies was specific for the anti-Sm response. The mechanism of the passive antibody enhancement was apparently not isotype- or idiotype-related. The fine specificity of the anti-Sm monoclonal antibody may be essential to its enhancing or suppressing effects, since both enhancing monoclonals recognized only the D Sm polypeptide, whereas both suppressing monoclonals saw the D and the B polypeptides. Furthermore, analysis of serial bleeds from unmanipulated MRL mice that developed anti-Sm positivity showed that the D specificity almost always appeared first. We hypothesize, therefore, that those animals in which an anti-Sm response is initiated by D-specific B-cell clones can become serologically positive with the aid of a positive feedback loop. In contrast, animals in which the initial specificity is for both B and D peptides would be prevented from developing a full anti-Sm response.\r"

After each examination, the actor/patient completed a questionnaire about his experience and the dentists were interviewed about homosexuality and AIDS. The dentists were then debriefed and told that they were part of an experiment. Despite negative feelings toward homosexuality, only one dentist refused to treat the actor when he was perceived to be homosexual. One dentist also rejected him when he played the part of an intravenous drug user.\r"

In contrast, dipyridamole thallium imaging is not dependent on patients achieving adequate levels of exercise, but no long-term prognostic studies have been reported. Accordingly, imaging results of 516 consecutive patients referred for dipyridamole thallium studies were correlated with subsequent cardiac events, death (n = 23) and myocardial infarction (n = 43) over a mean follow-up period of 21 months. Patients with a history of congestive heart failure, prior myocardial infarction, diabetes mellitus or abnormal scans were significantly more likely to have a cardiac event (p less than 0.03). With use of logistic regression analysis, an abnormal scan was an independent and significant predictor of subsequent myocardial infarction or cardiac death and increased the relative risk of any event more than threefold. The presence of redistribution on thallium scanning further increased the risk of a cardiac event. Survival analysis demonstrated a significant difference between patients with an abnormal or normal thallium scan over a 30 month period. In conclusion, dipyridamole thallium scintigraphy demonstrates prognostic value in a large unselected population and may be an adequate clinical alternative to physiologic exercise testing in the evaluation of coronary heart disease.\r"

The effects of coronary angioplasty on myocardial perfusion and perfusion reserve were delineated with positron emission tomography and oxygen-15-labeled water (H2(15)O) in 13 patients before and after single vessel angioplasty. In 11 patients, angioplasty was successful (minimal cross-sectional area increased from 0.60 +/- 0.59 to 3.45 +/- 1.09 mm2, p less than 0.001). In these patients, regional H2(15)O radioactivity (the ratio of nutritional perfusion in regions distal to the stenosis compared with regions supplied by angiographically normal arteries) at rest before angioplasty was 55 +/- 22% of peak myocardial radioactivity and did not increase significantly afterward (70 +/- 16%, p = NS). However, after administration of intravenous dipyridamole, hyperemic perfusion in regions distal to a stenosis averaged only 39 +/- 18% of peak myocardial counts before angioplasty, but increased to 66 +/- 22% after angioplasty (p less than 0.02). Perfusion reserve in the two patients in whom angioplasty was angiographically unsuccessful showed no change. Quantitative estimates of perfusion in absolute rather than relative terms were obtained with positron emission tomographic data from seven of the patients with successful angioplasty. At rest, perfusion in regions distal to a stenosis was not different from the values in regions supplied by normal coronary arteries (1.54 +/- 0.54 compared with 1.46 +/- 0.38 ml/g per min, p = NS).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Blood flow in bypass grafts and recipient left anterior descending coronary arteries was evaluated with combined two-dimensional and Doppler echocardiography in 15 patients with an internal mammary artery graft and in 24 patients with a saphenous vein graft. Comparative studies of coronary hemodynamics were also performed regarding these two different grafting techniques. The graft vessel was detected in 11 (79%) of 14 patients with an internal mammary artery graft and in 20 (87%) of 23 with a saphenous vein graft. The recipient left anterior descending coronary artery was detected in 10 (67%) of the former group and 17 (71%) of the latter. The blood flow patterns obtained were generally biphasic, consisting of systolic and diastolic phases with higher velocity during diastole. The maximal diastolic flow velocity in internal mammary artery grafts was much higher than that in saphenous vein grafts. In patients with an internal mammary artery graft, the flow pattern characteristics within the recipient coronary artery were quite similar to those within the arterial graft, and flow velocities within the recipient coronary artery and the arterial graft were quantitatively almost identical. This outcome may contribute to the long-term patency seen in internal mammary artery grafts. On the other hand, the flow velocity in saphenous vein grafts was fairly low throughout the cardiac cycle. Flow velocity in the recipient coronary artery in patients with a saphenous vein graft was accelerated only in early diastole. As a result, the recipient coronary artery flow pattern and velocity differed substantially from those in the saphenous vein graft.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

This study was performed to evaluate the capability of NMR imaging in the measurement of infarct size in patients with recent myocardial infarction. Electrocardiographic (ECG)-gated spin-echo NMR imaging was performed in 26 patients a mean of 9 +/- 3 days (range 5 to 20) after infarction. The imaging technique used provided single-slice, spin-echo (time to echo [TE] = 60 ms) images of the left ventricle in its true short axis, allowing direct correlation of NMR infarct location and size with the region of severe hypokinesia on left ventriculography. In all 20 patients with complete NMR studies, infarct location was correctly identified by using specific, objective criteria. The correlation between the mean infarct volume (29 +/- 11 ml) and the quantitated left ventricular hypokinetic segment (7.5 +/- 4.0 cm) was good (r = 0.84, p = 0.0002), suggesting that NMR imaging of the heart may have a role in the noninvasive assessment of myocardial infarct size in patients.\r"

  ".W": "To test the hypothesis that the presence of ventricular late potentials in the highly amplified, averaged and filtered surface electrocardiogram (ECG) can be predicted from the conventional surface ECG, 211 patients with and without previously documented sustained ventricular tachycardia outside the acute phase of myocardial infarction were studied. The presence of left ventricular akinesia or aneurysm was significantly correlated with the ECG score (based on Q wave duration, R wave duration and amplitude ratio). The mean ECG score in patients without ventricular tachycardia was 3.4 +/- 3.5 points compared with 5.5 +/- 3.9 points (p less than 0.001) in patients with ventricular tachycardia. The presence of late potentials was positively correlated with the ECG score in the whole cohort of patients. This was also the case in the subgroup of patients without a history of sustained ventricular tachycardia. In contrast, in patients with ventricular tachycardia, the presence of late potentials was independent of their ECG score. Using linear discriminant function analyses to predict the presence of late potentials, a history of ventricular tachycardia alone and the ECG score alone had a high predictive power (high standardized coefficients). If combinations of variables were analyzed including estimates of left ventricular function (presence of aneurysm or akinesia; ejection fraction), the ECG score and a history of ventricular tachycardia still ranked highest. The influence of ejection fraction if used in combination with other variables for the prediction of late potentials was relatively small (standardized coefficient of 0.4). In conclusion, the surface ECG can be used in patients previously free of sustained ventricular tachycardia to predict the presence of ventricular late potentials.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The effect of this system on reducing actual radiation exposure to physicians and technicians was assessed from 1984 through 1987. During this time, progressive fluoroscopy was added sequentially to all four adult catheterization laboratories; no changes in shielding procedures were made. During this time, the case load per physician increased by 63% and the number of percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty procedures (a high radiation procedure) increased by 244%. Despite these increases in both case load and higher radiation procedures, the average radiation exposure per physician declined by 37%. During the same time, the radiation exposure for technicians decreased by 35%. Pulsed progressive fluoroscopy is effective for reducing radiation exposure to catheterization laboratory physicians and technical staff.\r"

  ".W": "Electrical activation-guided laser photocoagulation was used intraoperatively to terminate ventricular tachycardia in patients with ischemic heart disease. During ventricular tachycardia, laser irradiation was delivered to mapped sites with local diastolic activation. In 30 long-term survivors, 85 ventricular tachycardia configurations were terminated by ablation; 72 (84.7%) were terminated by endocardial photocoagulation. Thirteen (15.3%) required epicardial photocoagulation; however, these 13 ventricular tachycardias occurred in 10 (33%) of the 30 patients. An aneurysm was present in 70% of patients with successful endocardial photocoagulation, but in only 10% of patients requiring epicardial photocoagulation for at least one ventricular tachycardia configuration; 90% of all patients requiring epicardial laser photocoagulation had no aneurysm and had either a right or a left circumflex coronary artery-related infarction. In this group, epicardial activation data were similar to those described for ventricular tachycardia with an \"endocardial\" origin and included 1) delayed potentials during sinus rhythm, 2) presystolic or pandiastolic activation sequences during ventricular tachycardia, and 3) regions of block near the presumed region of reentry during ventricular tachycardia. This study suggests that the critical anatomic substrates supporting reentry in postinfarction ventricular tachycardia may occur at intramural or epicardial sites, particularly in patients with right or circumflex coronary artery-related infarction and no aneurysm.\r"

Ventricular volumes, total ejection fraction and the forward ejection fraction did not change during exercise at baseline. At rest, tailored therapy decreased average pulmonary capillary wedge pressure from 36 to 19 mm Hg (p less than 0.01), systemic vascular resistance from 1,570 to 1,210 dynes.s.cm-5 (p less than 0.05), and left ventricular volume index from 251 to 177 ml/m2 (p less than 0.01), while increasing the forward ejection fraction from 0.53 to 0.85 (p less than 0.01) without change in total ejection fraction (0.18 from 0.17). During steady state exercise at low work load, tailored therapy decreased left ventricular volume index from 279 to 213 (p less than 0.05) and increased forward ejection fraction from 0.52 to 0.79 (p less than 0.01) without change in total ejection fraction (0.20 from 0.19). The total stroke volume during exercise was not increased after therapy; the increase in forward stroke volume after therapy appeared to result instead from the decrease in mitral regurgitant flow. The benefits of tailored afterload reduction are maintained throughout upright exercise.\r"

Cardiac output and iliofemoral blood flow were measured using thermodilution. The patients were exercised to the same work load on a bicycle before and 2 h after oral diltiazem (60 mg in two patients and 120 mg in six). At maximal exercise, diltiazem reduced heart rate from 94 +/- 5 to 88 +/- 6 beats/min (p less than 0.01), mean arterial pressure from 139 +/- 5 to 127 +/- 4 mm Hg (p less than 0.01) and systemic vascular resistance from 9.7 +/- 0.7 to 8.4 +/- 0.4 x 10(2) dynes.s.cm-5 (p less than 0.05) compared with control. During exercise, cardiac output, iliofemoral blood flow, mean pulmonary wedge pressure and mean right atrial pressure were not altered, but stroke volume increased from 119 +/- 11 to 131 +/- 10 ml (p less than 0.05). Maximal ST segment depression during exercise was decreased and angina was less. Diltiazem does not alter the distribution of the cardiac output during exercise but improves ischemia.\r"

Follow-up study ranged from 1 month to 14 years (mean 43 months). There were 12 survivors and 11 nonsurvivors; the 1 year mortality rate was 30% (7 of 23), and the 5 year mortality rate was 44% (10 of 23). Age at onset, gender, cardiothoracic ratio on chest radiograph, pattern of infarction, ST-T changes or arrhythmia on ECG and left ventricular end-diastolic pressure were nonpredictive of outcome. However, low shortening fraction (mean 11.5% in nonsurvivors versus 20.9% in survivors, p less than 0.01), familial cardiomyopathy and endocardial fibroelastosis indicated a very poor prognosis.\r"

No patient had had a coronary bypass operation or coronary angioplasty. The 889 patients were classified into four major groups and each major group was classified into two subgroups: 1) acute myocardial infarct without (306 patients) or with (119 patients) a healed myocardial infarct; 2) sudden out of hospital death without (121 patients) or with (118 patients) a healed myocardial infarct; 3) chronic congestive heart failure with a healed myocardial infarct without (137 patients) or with (33 patients) a left ventricular aneurysm; and 4) sudden in-hospital death without (20 patients) or with (35 patients) unstable angina pectoris. The mean age of the 687 men (77%) was 60 +/- 11 years, and of the 202 women (23%), 68 +/- 13 years (p = 0.0001). Although men included 77% of all patients, they made up approximately 90% of the out of hospital (nonangina) sudden death group. The frequency of systemic hypertension and angina pectoris was similar in each of the four major groups. The frequency of diabetes mellitus was least in the sudden out of hospital death group and similar in the other three major groups. The mean heart weight and the percent of patients with a heart of increased weight were highest in the chronic congestive heart failure group; values were lower and similar in the other three major groups.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Triggered activity due to early afterdepolarizations in the context of prolonged repolarization is believed to cause torsade de pointes. The nature of such triggered activity is not clearly defined. Spontaneous action potentials developing from depolarized membrane potentials were studied in canine Purkinje fibers with use of a standard microelectrode technique. Action potentials due to abnormal automaticity and additional depolarizations developing over the repolarization phase were induced by 5 mM barium superfusion. These action potentials were abolished by 1.0 x 10(-5) M verapamil and by calcium-free solution, whereas action potential amplitude (Vmax) and spontaneous firing frequency were markedly enhanced by 2.0 x 10(-6) M isoproterenol. High calcium solution shortened the action potential duration and precluded additional depolarizations. Quinidine, 1.0 x 10(-5) M, reduced action potential amplitude (6.9 +/- 1.8%: p less than 0.01), Vmax (15.7 +/- 4.0%; p less than 0.05) and spontaneous firing frequency (18.5 +/- 2.1%; p less than 0.01), but it increased action potential duration measured at -40 mV (19.1 +/- 5.9%; p less than 0.01), which produced additional depolarizations. Amiodarone, 5.0 x 10(-5) M, reduced action potential amplitude (23.4 +/- 3.6%; p less than 0.01), Vmax (44.6 +/- 3.9%; p less than 0.01) and spontaneous firing frequency (41.9 +/- 5.1%; p less than 0.01). Amiodarone obviated the development of additional depolarizations without effect on action potential duration.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The increase in PR (p less than 0.0001) and AH (p less than 0.001) intervals was proportional to the energy delivered. After ablation, the PR interval increased from 98 +/- 10 to 154 +/- 33 ms (p less than 0.004) and the AH interval from 59 +/- 8 to 102 +/- 16 ms (p less than 0.004). There was no significant change in QRS, QTc, HV or RR intervals. AH and PR intervals were significantly prolonged at 3, 7 and 14 days after ablation (p less than 0.05). Anterograde conduction was significantly altered in 10 dogs. Anterograde AV node effective refractory period increased from 157 +/- 14 to 214 +/- 45 ms (p less than 0.005). Anterograde AV node Wenckebach cycle length increased from 196 +/- 30 to 244 +/- 44 ms (p less than 0.002). Retrograde conduction was assessed in three dogs. Retrograde AV node effective refractory period increased from 156 +/- 21 to 260 ms in two dogs, with complete retrograde block in the third. These changes persisted for up to 2 weeks. Pathologic changes were limited to the region of the AV node. In four dogs adherent thrombus without pulmonary emboli was noted.

  ".W": "A 62 year old man with previous myocardial infarction, an occluded right coronary artery and a 90% stenosis of the left anterior descending coronary artery underwent angioplasty with the support of coronary venous retroperfusion of arterial blood during the procedure. In two of four angioplasty balloon dilations of the left anterior descending coronary artery, synchronized diastolic retroperfusion of the coronary veins with arterial blood was applied to protect the severely dysfunctioning myocardium from additional ischemia. Two-dimensional echocardiography was used to monitor and quantitate alterations in left ventricular function. Retroperfusion of arterial blood resulted in immediate improvement in ischemic zone wall motion despite the totally occluded artery during balloon dilation. Echocardiographic images recorded after angioplasty showed a marked improvement in contraction of the previously dyskinetic segments, with changes similar to those seen during balloon dilations with synchronized diastolic coronary venous retroperfusion. Thus, in this patient, viability of chronically dysfunctioning myocardium could be demonstrated by the improvement in regional wall motion during retroperfusion. This technique could eventually be of value to elucidate the anatomic location of viable myocardium while maintaining adequate left ventricular systolic function during coronary artery interventions in the catheterization laboratory.\r"

Abnormal vasodilator reserve (ratio less than 3:1) occurred in 50% of the study group and markedly abnormal reserve (less than or equal to 2:1) occurred in 27%. Coronary vasodilator reserve was significantly lower (2.2 +/- 0.8 versus 3.5 +/- 1.3, p = 0.003) and indexed left ventricular mass significantly higher (152.6 +/- 42.2 versus 113.6 +/- 24.0 g, p = 0.0007) in patients with a positive (n = 11) versus a negative (n = 32) thallium perfusion scan. Coronary flow reserve was linearly related in coronary basal flow velocity as follows: y = -0.17x + 4.59; r = -0.57; p = 0.00002. The decrement in flow reserve was not linearly related to the degree of left ventricular hypertrophy. Abnormal vasodilator reserve subsets found in hypertensive patients were defined on the basis of basal flow velocity, indexed left ventricular mass and clinical factors. In this series, diabetes did not cause a detectable additional decrement in flow reserve above that found with hypertension alone. These findings demonstrate that thallium perfusion defects are associated with depressed coronary vasodilator reserve in hypertensive patients without obstructive coronary artery disease. Left ventricular hypertrophy by indexed mass criteria is predictive of which hypertensive patients are likely to have thallium defects.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Nine men (mean age 55 years) with treated chronic heart failure underwent continuous pulmonary artery pressure measurement with use of a micromanometer-tipped catheter with in vivo calibration and frequency-modulated recording. The mean (+/- SD) maximal systolic pulmonary artery pressure (in mm Hg) was 59.4 +/- 26.1 on treadmill exercise, 54.9 +/- 30.6 on bicycle exercise, 52.5 +/- 26.1 walking up and down stairs and 43.5 +/- 23.9 walking on a flat surface. The mean maximal diastolic pressure (in mm Hg) was 27.8 +/- 14.6 on treadmill exercise, 25.5 +/- 14.9 on bicycle exercise, 24.9 +/- 14.8 walking up and down stairs and 20.4 +/- 12.5 walking on a flat surface. The increase in pulmonary artery pressure did not correlate with the severity of the limiting symptoms except during walking on a flat surface. All patients had marked postural changes in pressure, with the systolic pressure difference from lying to standing ranging from 8 to 25 mm Hg and the diastolic pressure difference ranging from 3 to 13 mm Hg. Eating meals caused an increase in pressure in three patients, but less than that when lying flat. There was an increase in pressure during urination in four patients equal to that when walking on a flat surface. None of these activities was associated with symptoms. Neither symptoms nor pulmonary artery pressure during maximal exercise is the same as during daily activities. This may restrict the value of maximal exercise tests in assessing patients with chronic heart failure.\r"

  ".W": "To examine the functional consequences of the greater increase in right ventricular work with exercise, the effects of prolonged exercise on the right and left heart chambers were compared in 41 athletes before, at the finish (13 min) and after recovery (28 h) from the Hawaii Ironman Triathlon (3.9 km swim, 180.2 km bike ride, 42.2 km run). Two-dimensional and Doppler echocardiograms were analyzed for left and right atrial and ventricular areas at end-diastole and end-systole, right and left ventricular inflow velocities and mitral and tricuspid regurgitation. After exercise, left ventricular and left and right atrial sizes were reduced, whereas right ventricular size increased (diastole: 21.4 to 24.2 cm2; systole: 15.8 to 18.2 cm2; p less than 0.01). The emptying fraction of all chambers was unchanged. Left but not right ventricular inflow showed an increase in peak velocity of rapid filling, whereas both atrial systolic velocities increased (26 to 38 cm/s tricuspid; 38 to 54 cm/s mitral; both p less than 0.01). Overall, the right ventricular early to atrial velocity ratio was reduced after exercise (1.56 to 1.17; p less than 0.05) and the left ventricular pattern was unchanged. The prevalence of tricuspid regurgitation was statistically unchanged (86% to 52%), although that of mitral regurgitation was greatly reduced (76% to 0%). Changes in all variables returned toward prerace values during recovery. Thus, in highly trained athletes, prolonged exercise causes differing responses of the right and left ventricles. These differences may be due to changes in right ventricular function, shape or compliance.\r"

  ".W": "Patients with diabetes are prone to silent myocardial infarction and silent exertional ischemia. Although the mechanism is not clear, it may reflect a specific impairment of the sensory innervation of the heart. To test this hypothesis, anginal perceptual threshold was measured in 32 diabetic patients and 36 nondiabetic control patients, all of whom had typical exertional angina. Anginal perceptual threshold was defined as the time from onset of 0.1 mV ST depression to the onset of chest pain during treadmill stress electrocardiography. Although ST depression occurred earlier in the diabetic than in the nondiabetic group (111 +/- 82 versus 216 +/- 162 s, p less than 0.005), the anginal perceptual threshold in the diabetic group was delayed by a mean of 86 s (149 +/- 76 versus 63 +/- 59 s, p less than 0.001), with 95% confidence intervals of 53 to 119 s. Autonomic function tests were abnormal in the diabetic group, and in both groups regression analyses (using a third order polynomial) showed marked prolongations of anginal perceptual threshold as the heart rate responses to the Valsalva maneuver decreased to below the normal range (r = 0.5, p less than 0.001). There was a similar though less pronounced relation between anginal perceptual threshold and the heart rate responses to deep breathing (r = 0.3, p less than 0.02). These data suggest that prolongation of the anginal perceptual threshold may be caused by autonomic neuropathy involving the sensory innervation of the heart. To test sensory function, median nerve conduction studies were performed in 19 patients (10 diabetic and 9 nondiabetic).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Patients undergoing coronary angioplasty have a 2% to 7% risk of requiring emergency coronary artery bypass graft surgery for impending infarction. These patients provide a unique model of early reperfusion because the exact time of compromise to blood flow and the composition of the reperfusion solution are known. However, the amount of myocardium salvaged is unknown. Between December 1981 and September 1985, 859 patients underwent coronary angioplasty. Forty-two patients had emergency surgery for objective evidence of impending infarction. Five patients died. Thirty-six patients were contacted for follow-up; 21 (58%) of 36 had a radionuclide ventriculogram performed at a mean of 39 +/- 13 months after surgery. These radionuclide studies were compared with the patient's preangioplasty contrast ventriculogram. One patient had a myocardial infarction 3 years after surgery. Eleven (55%) of the remaining 20 patients had a normal radionuclide ventriculogram at follow-up study (ejection fraction 65 +/- 9%). Five (25%) of the 20 patients had a depressed ejection fraction (46 +/- 4%) with wall motion abnormalities, but these were unchanged from the preangioplasty studies. Four patients (20%) had a significant decrease in ejection fraction over baseline (37 +/- 10%) with new wall motion abnormalities. In conclusion: 1) there is an 80% chance that left ventricular function will be unchanged at 3 year follow-up study in patients surviving emergency bypass grafting for failed angioplasty; 2) these data suggest that early revascularization for impending infarction in this setting is associated with a good late outcome; and 3) this patient group offers a unique opportunity to study the effects of early reperfusion in a human model.\r"

Presenting symptoms included atypical chest pain (n = 10), typical angina (n = 6), dyspnea (n = 5) and palpitation (n = 8). Ten patients were asymptomatic. At follow-up all patients had inverted precordial T waves, and 14 had the syndrome of \"giant T wave negativity\" (greater than or equal to 10 mm). In six patients with electrocardiographic follow-up of greater than 10 years (mean 13.4), precordial T wave inversion had progressed from -0.8 +/- 3.9 to -11.2 +/- 8.0 mm in lead V4 in association with increased QRS amplitude. Episodic atrial fibrillation occurred in 4 of 10 patients with echocardiographic left atrial enlargement. Although left ventricular systolic function was normal, diastolic relaxation was impaired in comparison with values in 10 healthy control subjects: in all 18 patients studied peak filling rate was decreased (4.44 +/- 0.44 versus 6.13 +/- 1.54 stroke volumes/s); time to peak filling was increased (174 +/- 40 versus 147 +/- 32 ms); and atrial systolic contribution to ventricular end-diastolic volume was increased (21.5 +/- 6.8 versus 11.5 +/- 4.6 stroke volume %). During follow-up, 21 of the 26 patients remained in stable condition or were asymptomatic. One patient with normal coronary arteries had an apical myocardial infarction with development of a discrete apical aneurysm and loss of \"giant T wave negativity.\" This patient was the only one to have documented life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The study was repeated in 10 patients with hypothyroidism 4.0 +/- 0.5 months after thyroid replacement therapy (T4 index 9.9 +/- 2.1 micrograms/100 ml, TSH 3.5 +/- 1.3 microU/ml). In addition, basal, average and maximal heart rates were measured using 24 h ambulatory electrocardiographic (ECG) monitoring, and plasma levels of epinephrine and norepinephrine were determined before and after thyroid replacement. Heart rate increased less after bolus injection of 0.8, 1.6 and 3.2 micrograms of isoproterenol in the hypothyroid (10 +/- 2, 15 +/- 2 and 21 +/- 4 beats/min, respectively) than in the euthyroid (16 +/- 3, 22 +/- 3 and 30 +/- 4 beats/min, respectively) state (p less than 0.05). Control subjects reacted similarly to patients receiving thyroid replacement. Basal heart rate (64 +/- 3 versus 68 +/- 3 beats/min, p less than 0.05) and maximal heart rate (116 +/- 5 versus 133 +/- 5 beats/min, p less than 0.05) were lower on 24 h ambulatory ECG monitoring in the hypothyroid than euthyroid state despite higher basal plasma norepinephrine levels (394 +/- 45 versus 315 +/- 45 pg/ml, p less than 0.05). Thus, patients with hypothyroidism display a decreased cardiac chronotropic response to beta-adrenergic stimulation. This may contribute in part to the decreased basal and maximal daily heart rates seen in patients with hypothyroidism, which occurs despite elevated plasma norepinephrine levels.\r"

Right ventricular diastolic function was abnormal in 31 (76%) of these patients, the major abnormality being a short deceleration time (less than 150 ms) in 21 (68%), suggesting restriction. In contrast, 7 (23%) of the 31 patients had a decreased ratio of early (E) and late (A) diastolic peak flow velocities and a prolonged deceleration time (greater than 240 ms), suggesting abnormal relaxation. The patients were classified into two groups on the basis of right ventricular free wall thickness: group 1, less than 7 mm and group 2, greater than or equal to 7 mm. Compared with normal values, group 1 showed an increased peak late flow velocity (44 +/- 19 versus 39 +/- 6 cm/s; p less than 0.01) and a decreased E/A velocity ratio (1.1 +/- 0.4 versus 1.5 +/- 0.3; p less than 0.01). Group 2 showed a markedly shortened deceleration time (151 +/- 37 versus 225 +/- 28 ms; p less than 0.01), characteristic of restriction. In the overall group, superior vena cava peak flow velocity was decreased in systole and increased in diastole and flow reversals during inspiration were increased compared with normal values. Hepatic venous flow velocities were similar to those in the superior vena cava except for larger flow reversals in the hepatic vein. Thus, in cardiac amyloidosis, right ventricular diastolic function is abnormal. There is a spectrum of right ventricular filling abnormalities and the restrictive filling pattern is seen only in the advanced stages of the disease.\r"

Results indicate significant increase in fasting lipids preoperatively (Table 1). Postoperatively, lipid levels dropped immediately and leveled out to a normal range for this patient and were maintained through the 6-month follow-up blood analysis. As lipids increased, the cardiovascular risk factors remained fairly consistent because of a similar elevation of all lipids. This supports the research that stress releases catecholamines, which raise free fatty acid levels in the blood stream (8,9). This case study does suggest that there is a relationship between elevated serum lipid levels and emotional stress (10). A total liquid diet for 6 to 8 weeks can modify cholesterol intake. This case study is unique because the patient consumed only low-cholesterol, low-saturated fat foods and liquids and nutritional supplements and was acutely aware of meeting nutritional requirements (6). The average patient undergoing oral surgery with mandibular fixation typically selects whole milk products, ice cream, and other high-cholesterol liquids in order to increase total caloric intake.\r"

Differences in beliefs between program directors and other faculty members were compared by t-test analysis. The five major categories of internship selection procedures are presented with information items faculty members believe are derived from each category, and the results are compared with those of previous surveys of dietetic selection practices. Major findings are that the intern selection process has changed significantly since 1978, with greater emphasis on work experience and extracurricular activities; the number of applicants per position has doubled despite a doubling of dietetic internship programs; and program directors and faculty members agree on the major selection practices but not on the information obtained from a given category. In the discussion, the findings are evaluated against a broad background of health profession education literature; implications are raised for intern selection committees and for the applicant.\r"

Role disparity was found between the responses of the dietitians and those of the physicians. Dietitian respondents identified themselves as the primary decision makers more than 50% of the time in all circumstances queried. In contrast, 10% or less of the MDs saw the dietitians as the primary decision makers in any area except selection of caloric supplements. In the ideal setting, the dietitian desired a greater degree of autonomy than the physician was willing to grant. Our findings were not explained by demographic differences. Perhaps faulty communication between the physician and the dietitian or unclear medical-legal issues may explain our findings of perceived role disparity.\r"

In the (homogenized) food groups, the contents of protein, fat, and available carbohydrates were determined as well as the fatty acid composition. The mean daily amounts of the macrocomponents (as a percentage of the mean daily energy value of the total diet) were 14% for protein, 35% for fat, 47% for total available carbohydrates, and 4% for alcohol. The total diet contained 24 gm dietary fiber. The fatty acid composition of the Dutch male adolescents' diet resembles the fatty acid composition of the Dutch \"national diet\" and the typical American diet: approximately 15% of total calories as saturated fatty acids, 5% as polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), and a polyunsaturated to saturated fatty acids ratio of 0.33. The results, as compared with the recommendations for a healthy diet, show that a decreased consumption of saturated fat, a higher consumption of PUFA, a higher dietary fiber intake, and a higher consumption of complex carbohydrates would be advisable for male Dutch adolescents.\r"

Twenty dietitians participated in the audit process, providing 99 client responses to the survey. Sixty-seven percent of clients submitted the charges for nutrition services to their insurance companies, but only 17% received reimbursement for the claims submitted. This audit process raised the level of awareness of the state membership regarding the need to aggressively pursue TPR for nutrition services at all levels, and it provided a model for dietitians to use to conduct periodic audits and assess TPR being received by their clients.\r"

  ".W": "A computerized diet entry system was developed to control entry of diet orders by hospital ward clerks from an established list of items. Three reporting systems were then designed for delivery of the computerized order to the Nutrition Services Department. One report contains only essential information and is printed instantly upon entry for confirmation of a \"stat\" diet order. Another report collates diet orders by time periods and then organizes them by wards and sequentially by room number. That report is then used for diet changes prior to meal service. The third report stores advance diet orders and test diet orders and reports them upon the date they are to be served. Diet orders are also collated and retained in the system, in sequential order for each patient, to allow for an instant report of the patient's diet history upon demand. This computerized diet order system has resolved problems regarding receipt of complete information required for a diet order and receipt of a diet order for all patients. An overview of the information support system used by the Nutrition Services Department, which was created from programs developed for other hospital departments, is also presented.\r"

  ".U": "90110784\r", 
  ".W": "Two different balance testing methods were compared: (1) measurement of spontaneous postural sway during quiet standing, and (2) measurement of induced postural sway in response to an applied postural perturbation. Eyes-open tests were performed in 64 healthy young and elderly adults and in five elderly subjects with a history of falling. In both balance tests, the sway was defined in terms of the displacement of the center of pressure on the feet. Spontaneous sway was quantified using a number of different amplitude- and frequency-based parameters. Induced sway was measured in response to anterior-posterior acceleration of a platform on which the subject stood. The induced-sway test was specially designed to be safe and nonthreatening for elderly subjects; thus, the platform perturbation was confined to small accelerations and a gentle pseudorandom motion was used. To derive a measure of postural stability, the data from this test were fitted with a model that was then used to predict the response to sudden (transient) perturbations, thereby simulating the response in actual falls. Although both induced- and spontaneous-sway measures demonstrated significant aging-related decreases in stability, the differences were more pronounced for the induced-sway data. Conversely, some of the spontaneous-sway measures were much more successful in distinguishing the fallers from the nonfallers. There was a significant correlation between induced-sway and certain spontaneous-sway measures in the normal young adults; however, in the elderly normals and fallers, the data from the two types of balance tests either showed no correlation or, for certain spontaneous-sway measures, tended to show an inverse relationship.\r"

Probucol at 1000 mg/day was administered orally to 37 YM patients and 14 E patients for an average of 10 months. Probucol treatment for this period caused significant reductions in the serum levels of total cholesterol, low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), high density lipoprotein cholesterol, and apoprotein AI, AII, B, and CIII in both groups. The decreases in the levels of total cholesterol, LDL-C, and apoprotein B were greater in the E group than in the YM group (total cholesterol: YM, -19.3%, E, -31.3% [P less than .001]; LDL-C: YM, -17.0%, E, -35.4% [P less than .001]; apoprotein B: YM, -12.3%, E, -28.1% [P less than .01]). The decreases in other parameters in the two groups were not significantly different. The serum probucol concentrations in the YM and E groups were not significantly different. No significant side effects were observed in any patient. Thus probucol reduced the serum level of LDL more in the E group than in the YM group, and did so without any increase in the serum concentration of the drug or in side effects, suggesting that probucol is safe and beneficial for use in elderly patients.\r"

  ".U": "90110788\r", 
  ".W": "Few studies have assessed the prevalence and outcome of acute renal failure (ARF) in the elderly. Among 437 ARF cases prospectively studied during a nine-year period in a nephrology department, 152 (35%) occurred in patients over 70 years of age (Group 1). Patients over 70 account for only 10.5% of all hospital admissions in our country, and prevalence of ARF was 3.5 times higher in these patients than in younger people. Acute tubular necrosis (ATN) was diagnosed in 40% of Group 1 and 52% of the younger patients (Group 2) (P less than .05), whereas prerenal ARF was found in 47% and 32%, respectively (P less than .001). Dehydration was the most frequent cause of prerenal ARF in the elderly (51%). The etiological distribution of ATN was similar in both groups, being of multifactorial origin in most cases. Oliguria was present in 49% of ATN in Group 1 and in 66% of Group 2 (P less than .05). There were no significant differences in dialysis needs. Mortality was higher in the elderly in all types of ARF, although differences did not reach statistical significance. Need for dialysis, mechanical respiration, decreased level of consciousness, and hypotension were associated with poor prognosis in both groups. Total recovery from ARF in older persons was less frequent and slower than in younger patients. It may be concluded that patients over 70 years of age are at high risk for developing ARF; nevertheless, age should not be used as a discriminating factor in therapeutic decisions concerning ARF.\r"

The purpose was to determine the degree to which prescribing practices were in compliance with recent court rulings respecting the right of patients to informed consent to \"exceptional\" medication. The results indicate that physicians in nursing homes do not inform their patients of the risks of neuroleptics, do not seek consent, and do not consider competency to be even an issue. Elderly patients in the acute academic setting were informed of risks and benefits. However, both consent to medication and the competency to give this consent were presumed until or unless the patient failed to acquiesce. The degree to which these practices might be in potential conflict with state law, ignore the benefits of a negotiated doctor/patient partnership, and demonstrate one aspect of poor quality of care are discussed, and policy recommendations are made.\r"

Although adverse effects on quality of life are thought to be considerable, they have not been rigorously evaluated. This study was designed to identify the types and extent of dysfunction experienced by elderly individuals with hearing loss, and to define the most appropriate measures for assessing this dysfunction. Elderly male veterans attending a primary care clinic were screened for hearing loss and had their quality of life assessed with a comprehensive battery of disease-specific and generic measures. Of 472 people who had their hearing tested, 106 had hearing loss. Hearing loss was associated with significant emotional (P = .0001), social (P = .0001), and communication (P = .02) dysfunction. Most individuals (66%) perceived these dysfunctions as severe handicaps even though audiologic loss revealed only mild to moderate impairment (pure tone average loss, 27-55 dB). Adverse effects were best detected with disease-specific rather than generic functional status measures. We conclude that hearing impairment is associated with important adverse effects on the quality of life of elderly individuals, and that these effects are perceived as severe handicaps even by individuals with only mild to moderate degrees of hearing loss.\r"

The extent of glycation of normal human lens proteins was measured by reduction of the protein with [3H]NaBH4, acid hydrolysis and quantitation of radioactive hexitol-amino acids by phenylboronic acid (PBA) affinity chromatography. Hexitollysine (HL) accounted for greater than or equal to 90% of total radioactivity recovered as hexitol-amino acids (HAA). In lenses in the age range (1-79) years (n = 26) there was no significant age-dependent increase in glycation of lens proteins (p greater than .10). The average extent of glycation was 2.3 +/- 0.3 mmol glycated lysine/mol lysine, or approximately 0.8 nmol hexitollysine/mg lens protein. These results indicate that the extent of glycation of lysine residues in lens proteins is comparable to that of lysine residues in soluble proteins, such as hemoglobin and albumin, and that the extent of glycation of lens proteins does not increase with age. Thus, glycation, per se, is not an age-dependent chemical modification of human lens protein.\r"

  ".W": "The serum ACE activity was determined in male Fischer 344 rats at 2, 6, 13, and 25 months of age to determine whether serum angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) activity is a potential biomarker of tissue hypothyroidism in aged rats. Since rodent serum contains an ACE activity inhibitor, the measurements were done in both undiluted and 1:8 diluted sera. The highest serum inhibitor activity was found in the 2-month-old animals. The serum ACE activity measured in the diluted serum of the aged rats (77.6 +/- 2.9 units/ml) was significantly reduced compared to 2-month-old (178.2 +/- 6.4 units/ml), 6-month-old (101.5 +/- 6.1 units/ml) and 13-month-old rats (84.9 +/- 8.6 units/ml); (p less than 0.001). Hyperthyroidism induced by injecting L-triiodothyronine (T3) 15 micrograms/100 gm body weight intraperitoneally for 10 days increased the serum ACE activity in the older rats, but reduced the levels in 2-month-old rats. There was no significant change in 6-month-old rats. The levels of serum ACE activity in hypothyroid 6-month-old rats (95.5 +/- 3.5 units/ml) and in 2-month-old-rats (94.2 +/- 4.0 units/ml) were similar to the level seen in hypothyroid old rats (88.9 +/- 5.8 units/ml). Pair feeding of young rats (8 months old) with old did not alter the baseline ACE level (117.4 +/- 3.7 units/ml) or the T3 stimulated (105.2 +/- 10.2 units/ml) serum ACE activity. It is concluded that the reduced serum ACE activity in aged rats cannot be accounted for by the reduced caloric intake or reduced serum thyroid hormone levels.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The study demonstrates that stride length, walking speed, and the assessment of videotaped gait correlated well with each other and were significantly impaired in fallers compared to controls. Arm swing amplitude, upper-lower extremity synchrony, and guardedness of gait were most impaired in fallers. Although subjects who fell were more often demented than controls, it is likely that this represents a selection bias in nursing homes. Visual rating of gait features in the nursing home population is a simple and useful alternative to established methods of gait analysis.\r"

Only four subjects showed systolic blood pressure drops of at least 15 mmHg in response to standing. Both handgrip and mental arithmetic significantly modified the cardiovascular response from sitting to standing, raising the possibility that individuals with orthostatic hypotension and impaired circulatory reflexes could be trained to utilize behavioral techniques as a means of preventing blood pressure from dropping too far during orthostasis.\r"

Improvements in aerobic capacity were only weakly related to reduced total RT (r = 0.30, p less than .05). Analysis of covariance revealed that there were no differences (p greater than .05) among the three groups after training with respect to PMT, MT, total RT, and SM. These findings indicate that 6 months of aerobic and strength training did not induce significant changes in RT or SM in this group.\r"

  ".W": "Younger and older adults listened to segments of television news under one of three conditions: (a) Listen, in which they heard the auditory portion of the segment without its visual track; (b) Listen + Read, in which they listened to the auditory track only while reading along with a written transcript; and (c) Listen + Television, in which they heard the original televised segment complete with audio and visual track. Younger adults showed better free recall for the spoken information when it was augmented by the written transcript or video track; older adults did not show this benefit of bisensory augmentation. Subjects were also tested on a Daneman and Carpenter (1980) style measure of working memory processing. This measure accounted for virtually all age variance in memory performance in the unaugmented Listen condition. In the Listen + TV condition, however, there was a substantial proportion of age variance in performance which could not be accounted for in terms of working memory processing. Results are discussed in terms of the varying involvement of working memory processing in age differences as a function of input modality.\r"

Following presentation of a narrative in either fable or non-fable form, participants produced written responses under one of four recall conditions: total recall, summary, gist, or gist plus moral. Analysis of the response protocols revealed quantitative and qualitative differences associated with age in the non-fable but not the fable condition. In response to the non-fable, older adults exhibited a style that was more integrative or interpretive than that of the younger adults, whose protocols were highly text-based and literal. Overall, the fable condition produced more text-based responses than did the non-fable condition. In addition, instructions at recall influenced responding. Response patterns could be shifted toward a more text-based style under total recall instructions, while more interpretive responses were obtained under the gist plus moral condition.\r"

Although a number of cluster analytic studies have suggested that this approach can generate meaningful typologies of behavior among psychiatric patients, little attention has been paid to the issue of categorization of psychiatric disorders among older chronic inpatients. This paper presents results of a preliminary study targeted at developing a categorization system with such patients. A six-cluster solution was obtained using K-means clustering. The six clusters were \"Paranoid Symptoms,\" \"Motor Symptoms,\" \"Depressive Symptoms,\" \"Nonsymptomatic,\" \"Positive Symptoms,\" and \"Negative Symptoms.\" Results of this study of patients whose psychiatric disorders arose early in life are contrasted with studies of patients whose disorders occurred late in life.\r"

A cue, occurring between 50 and 183 ms prior to display onset, indicated the location of the target. The results indicated that reaction time (RT) increased as a function of both the distance of the target from fixation and the presence of nontarget letters in the display. These RT effects were more pronounced for older adults than for young adults, in a manner consistent with a generalized age-related slowing of visual processing. The changes in RT associated with the cue indicated that, when nontarget letters were present in the display, the buildup of attention over the cue-target interval was slower for older adults than for young adults. This age difference in the time course of attention was independent of the generalized age-related slowing.\r"

  ".W": "Results from a second empirical test of a theory of intergenerational family relations, as an example of empirically driven theory construction in social gerontology, are presented. The theory we tested reflects an attempt to explain later-life patterns of affection, association, and consensus between parents and children as interdependent components of a meta-construct--family intergenerational solidarity. The theoretical model also identifies variables that are expected to predict variations in levels of solidarity. A recent empirical test (Atkinson, Kivett, and Campbell, 1986) offered little support for the central proposition of the model: that solidarity can be indexed by a linear-additive composite of affection, association, and consensus. The replication analysis reported here is based on a different sample, as well as alternate measures and statistical methods. The convergent results suggest that (a) later-life intergenerational solidarity is not a unidimensional construct, and (b) different variables predict each component. This exercise of theory statement, testing, and retesting leads us to suggest several refinements to the theory acknowledging a more complex relationship between dimensions of intergenerational relations in old age.\r"

The data on which the study is based came from two cross-sectional surveys commissioned by the National Council on the Aging and conducted in 1974 and 1981. Major research questions included: (a) Which cohorts are most active in taking steps to prepare for retirement? and (b) Did Americans increase their retirement preparation activities during the time period studied? Results indicate that retirement preparation is influenced by cohort effects, especially among the more recent cohorts, and that earlier cohorts generally prepare more. Most respondents, especially the earlier cohorts, experienced a decrease in retirement preparation between 1974 and 1981 (i.e., a period effect). Analysis of the separate indicators of a retirement preparation index show that most activities, for instance, savings, decreased during this time while others either increased (will preparation) or remained stable (home ownership). The findings suggest that retirement preparation is influenced by economic climate and provide partial support for this application of Easterlin's thesis. Retirement preparation is also strongly related to education and race.\r"

Given current marriage, divorce, and widowhood rates, the findings indicate a marked decline in the proportion of future elderly women who will be married or widowed, and a dramatic increase in the proportion who will be divorced. Further, the data show that the socioeconomic well-being of divorcees is significantly below that of widowed or married women.\r"

Disproportionally high numbers of women, persons over 84 years of age, those who lived alone, persons with lower incomes, and the less educated made noninstitutional moves. Actual noninstitutional relocation was associated with poorer physical functional status, poorer self-perceived health status, higher levels of depressive symptomatology and anxiety, and poorer life satisfaction at baseline. Death of spouse, marriage of offspring, and having someone move in with the respondent were associated with noninstitutional relocation, but retirement was not. The outcomes are generally consistent with Litwak and Longino's (1987) developmental model of relocation among elderly persons.\r"

In 8 of 13 cases, maternal injuries were either very minor or limited solely to the uterus and placenta. In 4 of these cases, the mother was examined in hospital and discharged having sustained only trivial injuries. In the remaining 5 cases, the mothers sustained serious injuries. The causes of fetal demise were placental abruption, infarction, laceration, or uterine rupture. In 5 of 13 cases, the fetus also suffered significant injuries usually to the head. In only 4 of 13 cases was the mother wearing restraints. Traumatic fetal death is a rare but important consequence of motor vehicle crashes and may occur despite relatively trivial maternal injuries.\r"

Thus, accurately determining body temperature is an integral component of the evaluation of all emergency department (ED) patients. Oral measurements are most commonly obtained but may not reflect core temperatures. Rectal temperatures are considered more reliable but may not reflect fluctuating core temperatures, and are dependent on site placement. The objective of this study was to determine the practicality and comparative accuracy of tympanic thermographic measurements in the ED. Oral, rectal and tympanic readings were compared in 411 patients. There were significant differences when comparing tympanic to oral (R2 = 0.599, P = 0.0001) and rectal to oral (R2 = 0.554, P = 0.0001) temperatures. In contrast, the correlation between tympanic and rectal measurements was R2 = 0.805, with no significant difference between the two, (P = 0.7077). No complications associated with the use of the tympanic probe were detected. Infrared tympanic thermography is an efficient and noninvasive technique for accurately measuring the temperature of ED patients.\r"

Fifteen of these patients required emergency department (ED) thoracotomy and were excluded from the study. In the remaining 120 patients, mechanism was gunshot (GSW) in 20% and stab wound (SW) in 80%; 89% were men, and the mean age was 26 years. For analysis, the posterior chest was further divided into upper and lower at the inferior tip of the scapula line. Overall, 28 patients (23%) with posterior penetrating chest wounds required early surgical intervention; 38% following a GSW compared to 20% due to a SW. Only 9 patients (8%) required thoracotomy while 19 (15%) underwent laparotomy. The most frequent indication for thoracotomy was persistent chest hemorrhage, and for laparotomy, positive diagnostic peritoneal lavage.\r"

  ".W": "Up to 50% of the 36 months of resident training in emergency medicine may be on off-service rotations. The experience on these rotations can lack educational content and opportunity pertinent to emergency medicine. The resident rarely has readily available and structured guidance to optimize training in terms of the anticipated needs of the specialty. In response to this problem, the authors have written curricula containing subject content listings, objectives, and supplied references for 16 off-service rotations. A plan for implementing the materials and an example from the obstetrics-gynecology rotation is given. After 12 months' experience, the authors have subjective responses from residents and off-service program directors that support the value of this information. Positive reports include: Residents having a better understanding of faculty expectations, improved \"consistency of experience,\" residents appreciating the added attention, improved performance, and expanded reading efforts. One expressed concern is \"too much to read.\" The project continues to evolve.\r"

  ".U": "90110992\r", 
  ".W": "The formation of B lymphocytes is abnormal in autoimmune NZB and (NZB x NZW)F1 mice. With age, the proportion of sIg- Ly-5(220)+ pre-B cells and less mature B cell progenitors in the bone marrow progressively declines, reaching only approximately one-third of normal levels in 20-wk-old NZ mice. To determine the mechanisms responsible for the deficiency of NZ B lineage precursors, the mitotic activity of sIg- Ly-5(220)+ bone marrow cells in vivo was determined in NZ and conventional inbred mice as a function of age. The proportion of sIg- Ly-5(220)+ B cell precursors in (S + G2/M) stages of the cell cycle steadily decreased with age in NZ autoimmune mice. Furthermore, upon metaphase arrest, the rate of entry of sIg- Ly-5(220)+ bone marrow cells into G2/M also decreased with age in NZ mice. Therefore, the mitotic activity of sIg- Ly-5(220)+ B cell precursors is substantially decreased in NZ mice greater than or equal to 20 wk of age. The capacity of the bone marrow stromal microenvironment of NZ mice to support B lineage precursor growth was tested in two ways: 1) the capacity of preformed NZ bone marrow stroma to support B lineage cell growth in long term bone marrow cell culture under lymphopoietic conditions was assessed and 2) the capacity of NZ bone marrow B lineage precursors to expand in vivo after sublethal (200 rad) whole body irradiation was determined. Stroma derived from adult NZ mice supported the growth and development of B lineage lymphocytes in long term bone marrow cell culture to a greater extent than did age-matched conventional murine stroma. Furthermore, sublethal irradiation of older adult NZ mice resulted in some expansion of bone marrow sIg- Ly-5(220)+ B cell precursors in vivo. Therefore, the deficiency of B cell progenitors in the bone marrow of older NZ autoimmune mice is associated with diminished mitotic activity. However, this does not result from defects in the capacity of NZ bone marrow stroma to permit B lineage cell expansion as determined by both in vitro and in vivo experiments. In the absence of a detectable stromal cell defect, it is possible that an active inhibitory process within the bone marrow influences the mitotic activity of B cell precursors in NZ mice.\r"

  ".U": "90110996\r", 
  ".W": "We have previously reported that treatment with a streptococcal preparation (OK-432), one of the biologic response modifiers, inhibits insulitis and development of autoimmune diabetes in nonobese diabetic (NOD) mice and Bio-Breeding rats used as animal models of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM). We studied the mechanism by which OK-432 inhibited development of IDDM in NOD mice. In female NOD mice diabetes spontaneously developed from 10 to 15 wk of age and the cumulative incidence of diabetes amounted to 74.7% at 30 wk of age. NOD mice, however, never developed diabetes over the observation period of up to 45 wk of age when they were i.p. injected with 0.1 mg of OK-432 weekly from 4 to 15 wk of age. OK-432 treatment in younger age had a stronger inhibitory effect on the development of diabetes. Diabetes was transferred to young, irradiated mice by spleen cells of nontreated, adult mice, but barely transferred by those of OK-432-treated mice. Furthermore, these spleen cells of OK-432-treated mice did not suppress transfer of diabetes by diabetic mice spleen cells. Treatment with cyclophosphamide promoted development of diabetes in nontreated NOD mice due to removal of suppressor cells. However, cyclophosphamide did not show the promotive effect in OK-432-treated mice. Taken together, these results indicate that OK-432 treatment prevented development of diabetes mainly by suppression in generation of the effector cells for pancreatic B cell destruction. The same OK-432 treatment did not suppress the immune response to exogenous AG such as xenogeneic SRBC and allogeneic tumor cells. The study suggests that BRM in the natural environment such as streptococci may suppress induction and progression of autoimmunity and be useful for the immunotherapy of human IDDM.\r"

  ".U": "90110997\r", 
  ".W": "The present studies were undertaken to determine whether glucocorticoids influence the levels of Ig in serum, saliva, and vaginal secretions. When measured by RIA, IgA levels in serum were elevated when increasing doses of dexamethasone, a potent synthetic glucocorticoid, were administered to intact- and adrenalectomized-ovariectomized rats. In contrast, IgA levels decreased in saliva and vaginal secretions over the same dose range. Time course studies indicated that the decline in salivary IgA, observed at 24 h after a single injection of dexamethasone, preceded a rise in serum IgA detected at 24 h after the second hormone treatment. Both responses were maximal at day 2 and did not change with further hormone exposure. After immunization and boosting with SRBC at two mucosal sites (intestinal Peyer's patch and uterine lumen), dexamethasone increased anti-SRBC IgA antibody levels in serum and reduced their presence in vaginal secretions. In contrast, anti-SRBC IgG-antibody levels in serum and vaginal secretions were reduced with hormone treatment. In the absence of hormone treatment, pooled sera from nonimmunized animals, when analyzed by HPLC, contained polymeric and dimeric IgA that was present in roughly equal proportion. In response to dexamethasone, polymeric IgA increased to a greater extent than did monomeric IgA. In summary, these studies demonstrate that dexamethasone alters the levels of IgA as well as specifically directed IgA and IgG antibodies in secretions and serum. Further, it suggests that glucocorticoid controlled IgA increases in serum and decreases in vaginal and salivary secretions may be due, in part, to a redistribution of polymeric IgA from mucosal surfaces to serum.\r"

  ".U": "90111000\r", 
  ".W": "The effect of stimulating normal type 1 murine T cell clones with anti-CD3 antibody was examined in vitro. In the absence of accessory cells, anti-CD3 antibody immobilized on plastic plates stimulated inositol phosphate production, suboptimal proliferation, IL-2 and IL-3 production, and maximal IFN-gamma production. Addition of accessory cells augmented lymphokine production and proliferation when the effects of \"high-dose suppression\" were relieved by removing the T cells from the antibody-coated plates. Exposure of type 1 T cell clones to immobilized anti-CD3 antibody alone rapidly induced long-lasting proliferative unresponsiveness (anergy) to Ag stimulation that could be prevented by accessory cells. This anergic state was characterized by a lymphokine production defect, not a failure of the T cells to respond to exogenous IL-2 or to express surface Ti/CD3 complexes. In addition, anergy could not be induced in the presence of cyclosporine A. These results suggest that under certain conditions anti-CD3 antibodies may have potent immunosuppressive effects independent of Ti/CD3 modulation. Furthermore, our results support a two-signal model of type 1 T cell activation in which Ti/CD3 occupancy alone (signal 1) induces anergy, whereas Ti/CD3 occupancy in conjunction with a costimulatory signal (signal 2) induces a proliferative response.\r"

  ".W": "TNF-alpha is a small peptide cytokine produced primarily by activated macrophages. One of the many biologic activities of TNF is the killing of diverse types of tumor cells. We considered the possibility that killing was mediated by TNF itself at an intracellular site, subsequent to receptor-mediated endocytosis. To test this hypothesis, we microinjected TNF into various murine normal cells and cell lines, some of which were killed by TNF given by the usual extracellular route, and others that were not. Cytotoxic effects of microinjected TNF were observed in several cell types 2 to 4 h after injection. L929 fibroblasts were killed by either extracellular or intracellular TNF. A TNF-resistant subline of L929 was insensitive to either extracellular or intracellular TNF. L6 fibroblasts were found to be resistant to high doses of TNF given either extracellularly or microinjected. Normal macrophages and the J774 macrophage-like cell line were not killed by extracellular TNF, but were rapidly killed by microinjected TNF. Thus, TNF, an extracellular peptide ligand, has an intracellular activity, suggesting that internalization of this ligand may have important intracellular biochemical roles.\r"

  ".W": "The concept of a membrane form of IL-1 arose from the observation that paraformaldehyde-treated macrophages display IL-1 bioactivity. Thus far, the biochemical characterization of a membrane form of the molecule has not been reported. In a recent publication we demonstrated that murine IL-1 alpha can be detected in the supernatants of paraformaldehyde-treated macrophages. These data indicate that the phenomenon of membrane IL-1 may result from leakage of IL-1 from inadequately fixed cells. In the current report we have extended our studies toward the examination of human IL-1 alpha and IL-1 beta. IL-1 activity can be detected in the supernatants of paraformaldehyde-treated human monocytes. Although anti-IL-1 alpha, but not anti-IL-1 beta, antibodies can efficiently block the IL-1 bioactivity, both IL-1 alpha and IL-1 beta can be found by immunoprecipitation in the supernatants of the fixed monocytes. IL-1 alpha is efficiently processed to the low m.w. form, whereas IL-1 beta remains predominantly as the inactive, precursor molecule. IL-1 is not found in the supernatants of monocyte membrane preparations, demonstrating that the leakage of IL-1 is from an intracellular, rather than membrane-bound source.\r"

  ".U": "90111004\r", 
  ".W": "Both IL-4 and IL-5 demonstrate B cell growth activity. IL-5 can render a cloned neoplastic B cell line, BCL1-CL-3 cells, responsive to IL-2, whereas IL-4 has no such activity. The response to IL-5 and IL-2 proceeds in two phases: the first phase which clearly depends upon IL-5 is the obvious increase in number of high affinity IL-2R (3.1-fold) with modest increase of low affinity IL-2R (1.2-fold) and gain of the ability of facilitated IL-2-binding and internalization of IL-2, and the second phase which is induced by IL-2 in the IL-5-stimulated CL-3 cells comprises the striking increase of low affinity IL-2R (8.5-fold). Kinetic study has revealed that high affinity IL-2R expressed on CL-3 cells begins to increase at 6 h and reaches to maximum at 12 h after stimulation with IL-5 or IL-5 plus IL-2, whereas low affinity IL-2R expression increases at 18 h and becomes maximal at 24 h after stimulation of CL-3 cells with IL-5 and IL-2. However, in the presence of IL-4, IL-5 cannot induce an increase in number of high affinity IL-2R on CL-3 cells. Thus, CL-3 cells stimulated with the mixture of IL-5 and IL-4 cannot respond to IL-2, and fail to show up-regulated expression of low affinity IL-2R. IL-4 also has a capacity to modestly interfere with the action of IL-2 to up-regulate low affinity IL-2R expression on IL-5-pretreated CL-3 cells. Thus, this monoclonal B cell system provides an excellent model system to define the roles of IL-5 and IL-4 involved in the B cell differentiation and to characterize the properties of B cells competent to IL-2 stimulation and the signal transduction mechanism which operates through IL-2/IL-2R system.\r"

  ".W": "We sought to determine whether the activation event which renders the CD11/CD18 leukocyte integrin/Leu-CAM glycoproteins capable of promoting cell to cell adhesion was associated with the induced posttranslational modification of phosphorylation. In neutrophils, two species of alpha-chains, a predominant CD11b 165-kDa subunit and a minor 150-kDa CD11c subunit were found to be constitutively phosphorylated. However, the 95-kDa CD18 common beta-chain was not phosphorylated in resting cells but became strongly phosphorylated in cells incubated with PMA. The beta-chain was phosphorylated in a dose-related manner within 1 min of the addition of PMA, reached maximal intensity between 4 to 10 min, and remained fully phosphorylated at 30 min. The similarities of the kinetics of homotypic aggregation induced by PMA to the time course of phosphorylation suggest that phosporylation may be relevant to at least this type of Leu-CAM-dependent adhesion. In contrast, in the presence of FMLP which induces aggregation with different kinetics than PMA, no phosphorylation of the common beta-chain was observed over a time interval of from 30 s to 10 min further emphasizing the apparent differences in the two modes of activation to an adhesive state. The phosphorylated species on neutrophils were readily detected by immunoprecipitation with each CD18 mAb and most but not all CD11b mAb which otherwise precipitated 125I-labeled CD11b species suggesting that the CD11b alpha-chain labelled with 32P may differ slightly from the 125I-labeled species in terms of its recognition by certain CD11b mAb. In mononuclear cells, similar constitutive phosphorylation of the CD11a and CD11c alpha-chains was observed that remained unchanged in the presence of either FMLP or PMA. As was demonstrated in neutrophils, phosphorylation of the CD18 beta-chains of mononuclear cells was not constitutive but was induced in the presence of PMA and not FMLP. Taken together these data suggest the existence of specific recognition sites on beta-chains for a regulatory kinase-phosphatase system.\r"

After addition of soluble NIP only 4 to 6% of the anti-NIP antibody remained bound to the Ag. C1q showed diminished binding after addition of NIP, whereas C4, C3, and TCC quantitatively remained bound to the Ag.

The supernatants from the solid phase assay were tested for C3 activation and formation of the fluid phase TCC (SC5b-9).

Some of the patients undergoing clinical trials with rIL-2 have developed antibodies to rIL-2. We describe a chemical modification of rIL-2 that reduces its immunogenicity. rIL-2 has been chemically modified with a water soluble polymer, monomethoxy polyethylene glycol (PEG). This covalent conjugate PEG-rIL-2 has enhanced solubility and extended in vivo circulation. Attachment of PEG to rIL-2 reduces its immunogenicity when tested in rabbits and in mice. Ag-specific IgG antibody titers were 100 to 1000-fold lower when PEG-rIL-2 was used as the Ag, compared to rIL-2. In a long term study, 7 of 10 rabbits injected with PEG-rIL-2 had no Ag-specific IgG antibody response. In these seven rabbits, the in vivo behavior of the injected PEG-rIL-2 remained essentially unchanged after repeated immunizations. PEG-rIL-2 injected before rIL-2 injections, immunosuppressed the antibody response to rIL-2 in rabbits. The maintenance of the systemic exposure of PEG-rIL-2 after repetitive dosing is related to its decreased immunogenicity. Thus, the PEGylation (covalent attachment of PEG) of rIL-2-enhances its potential as an anticancer therapeutic.\r"

To directly study whether rT4 interacts with Ig molecules, purified human IgG was added to rT4-coated wells and a dose-dependent interaction between IgG and rT4 was observed by ELISA. Purified myeloma IgG proteins bound to immobilized rT4 with the same avidity as polyclonal IgG that suggests that rT4-IgG binding was not due to the presence of anti-rT4 antibodies in the IgG fraction. IgG from 6 sera bound to rT4 in concentration dependent manner similar to purified IgG. Immobilized rT4 specifically bound IgG, and not IgM, IgA, IgD, or beta 2-microglobulin. The specific interaction of rT4 and IgG was also observed when IgG or IgM were immobilized, demonstrating that IgG binding was not a unique property of immobilized rT4. As with low affinity receptors for IgG, rT4 bound heat aggregated IgG with increased avidity. Neither anti-CD4 mAb nor dextran sulfate inhibited rT4-IgG binding. rT4 bound Fc but not F(ab)2 fragments. Each of the purified IgG subclasses; IgG1, 2, 3, and 4 bound to rT4 with similar avidity. Taken together, these data suggest that rT4 specifically interacts with a public structure on IgG Fc.\r"

  ".W": "A TNF (TNF-alpha and TNF-beta)-sensitive target, L929, and two TNF-resistant targets, P815 and LK were used to compare the cytolytic activity among subsets of CD4+ (Th) clones. Cytolytic activity was induced with either Con A, CD3-mAb, or Ag-pulsed LK cells. Six Th1 clones are strongly cytolytic against all three targets. In contrast, Th2 clones are either noncytolytic or weakly cytolytic. Although there is an apparent correlation between TNF production, killing of L929 cells, and the killing of TNF-resistant targets, an anti-TNF serum (capable of neutralizing both TNF-alpha and TNF-beta) selectively inhibits CD4 clones to lyse L929 cells, whereas the lysis of P815 or LK cells was unaffected. The continuous presence of noncytotoxic levels of Actinomycin D (AcD) and cycloheximide, but not mitomycin C, cyclosporin A (CsA), or cholera toxin (ChT) inhibits the lysis of Ag-pulsed, Ia-bearing LK cells; indicating a requirement for de novo synthesis of RNA and protein for cytolytic activity. Although pretreatment with AcD, CsA, or ChT strongly inhibits production of IL-2, TNF and IFN-gamma, only clones pretreated with AcD lose cytolytic activity against Ag-pulsed, Ia-bearing LK cells. These observations support a model of TNF-independent killing of TNF-resistant targets. The TNF-independent cytolytic activity does not correlate with serine esterase activity released into media upon activation of CD4 clones. Moreover, the effects of metabolic inhibitors on serine esterase release do not correlate with their effects on cytolytic activity. Collectively, the data demonstrate that activated CD4 cells express two distinct cytolytic activities; a TNF (and IFN-gamma)-mediated cytotoxicity and a TNF (and IFN-gamma)-independent cytolytic activity. Both pathways require de novo synthesis of RNA and protein and appear to be independent of granule enzyme release. Only the TNF-independent cytolytic activity is resistant to CsA and ChT inhibition.\r"

We used the rat mAb to murine CR, 8C12, and 7G6, as CR ligands, and soluble Ag-antibody complexes as FcR ligands; and F(ab')2 fragments of rabbit antibodies specific for mouse IgM and IgD as sIg ligands. We have found that: 1) sIg, CR, and Fc gamma R are not directly linked, because capping of any one did not affect the expression of the others; 2) the mAb 8C12 and 7G6 failed by themselves to cross-link CR; 3) soluble Ag-antibody complexes crosslinked some, Fc gamma R on a minority of Fc gamma R+ lymphocytes; 4) once loaded with anti-CR mAb, CR co-capped with sIg when sIg was cross-linked; 5) once loaded with Ag-antibody complexes, Fc gamma R also co-capped with sIg when sIg was sIg was cross-linked; 6) loading of Fc gamma R did not affect the co-capping of surface CR with cross-linked sIg and conversely, loading of CR did not affect the co-capping of Fc gamma R with cross-linked sIg; only loaded CR or Fc gamma R co-capped with sIg regardless of the status of the other surface molecule; 7) neither loaded nor free CR co-capped with cross-linked Fc gamma R, and neither loaded nor free Fc gamma R co-capped with cross-linked CR. These results demonstrate that both Fc gamma R and CR independently become associated with sIg when either receptor is loaded and sIg is cross-linked.\r"

In this study, mAb and monospecific polyclonal antibodies were used to define cross-antigenicity of the OspA and OspB protein to each other and to other lower molecular mass proteins by Western blot analysis. Two mAb studied, 105.5 and 184.1, were directed predominantly against the 31-kDa OspA protein. However, each also reacted with other minor bands, though with different specificities. Using V8 protease digestion and cleavage by cyanogen bromide, we demonstrated that each mAb reacted to the 31-kDa protein differently. Monospecific polyclonal rabbit and human antibodies directed against the 34-, 31-, 22-, and 20-kDa proteins were eluted from blots and used to further corroborate the cross-reactivity among these Ag. Rabbit antibodies to the 31- and 22-kDa Ag gave remarkably similar peptide maps after V8 protease digestion of the 31-kDa OspA protein, as did mAb 184.1, suggesting that this mAb recognized an immunodominant epitope common to the 22- and 31-kDa proteins. It seems likely therefore that the humoral immune response to Borrelia surface Ag may be due to a limited number of cross-reactive epitopes on distinct, but related, gene products.\r"

Kinetic studies with the IL-2-encoding recombinant (VV-HA-IL2) and control (VV-HA-TK) viruses excluded a role for cytotoxic T cells but suggested the possible involvement of NK cells. In athymic nude mice given VV-HA-IL2, NK activity was at least threefold higher than mice infected with VV-HA-TK and this activity persisted for at least 6 days after infection. The effectors mediating the NK-like activity were asialo-GM1+ (as-GM1+), Thy1.2+/-, CD4- and CD8-, the phenotype of conventional NK cells. Elevated NK activity coincided with the rapid clearance of VV-HA-IL2 from ovaries of infected normal CBA/H mice but not from ovaries of CBA beige mice which had no detectable NK activity in spleens or ovaries. The expression of IL-2 in recombinant VV infection probably induces a cascade of immunologic effects of which elevated NK activity is one. We speculate that the chemoattractant and NK activity augmenting effects of IL-2 may contribute to recovery from VV-infection.\r"

The ability of splenic APC from LP-BM5 MuLV-inoculated B10 mice to induce soluble Ag-specific proliferation of cloned Th cells was decreased progressively during the infection. The APC defect was found to be due neither to the decreased expression of Ia Ag nor to the insufficient production of IL-1. It was demonstrated that cloned Th stimulated with virus-infected splenic APC displayed the increased [Ca2+]i with severely decreased inositol phospholipid metabolism, which probably led to the defect of Th proliferative responses. These results suggested that the failure of Th to respond to soluble Ag in MAIDS is at least in part due to a selective defect in signal transduction caused by abnormal APC.\r"

  ".U": "90111027\r", 
  ".W": "We have previously demonstrated that fresh CD8+ T cells proliferate in response to autologous, alloantigen-primed CD4+ T cells, and differentiate into Ts cells, which inhibit the response of fresh T cells to the primary allogeneic stimulator cell but not irrelevant stimulators. Although such Ts do not have discernible cytolytic activity, like classical cytotoxic T cells (Tc) they express CD3 and CD8 on their surface and function in a class I MHC-restricted manner. Our study was an attempt to compare the surface phenotype and mechanism of action of Ts and Tc clones derived from the same individual. Ts clones were generated from donor JK by repeated stimulation of CD8+ T cells with an autologous CD4+ T inducer line specific for an allogeneic lymphoblastoid cell line (LCL). These clones were noncytolytic for either the inducer line or the allogeneic stimulator LCL. Tc clones, generated by direct stimulation of JK CD8+ T cells with the same allogeneic LCL, mediated potent, alloantigen-specific cytolysis. All Tc clones were alpha, beta TCR+, CD3+, CD4-, CD8+, CD11b-, and CD28+. Ts clones were also alpha, beta TCR+, CD3+, and CD8+, but in contrast to Tc clones, Ts clones were CD11b+ and CD28-. When added to MLR both Ts and Tc clones inhibited the response of fresh JK CD4+ T cells to the original but not irrelevant allogeneic LCL. However, Ts inhibited the response of only those CD4+ T cells that shared class I)MHC determinants with the Ts donor, whereas Tc inhibited the response of CD4+ T cells from all responders, regardless of HLA type. Pretreatment of Ts clones with mAb to CD2, CD3, or CD8 blocked suppression, whereas similar pretreatment of Tc clones blocked cytotoxicity in 4-h 51Cr release assays but had no effect on Tc-mediated suppression of the MLR. These results suggest that both Ts and Tc clones can inhibit the MLR but they do so through different mechanisms. Moreover, the maintenance of distinct surface phenotypes on these long term clones suggests that Ts may be a distinct sublineage of CD8+ T cells rather than a variant of CD8+ Tc.\r"

In the present work, we examined whether DNA methylation might control expression of the alpha Fc gamma R gene. We found that, in DNA from a panel of Fc gamma R(+) and (-) cell lines, two MspI sites of the alpha Fc gamma R gene were selectively unmethylated only in the two cell lines containing alpha transcripts. These sites, separated by a distance of 1.2 kb, are located in the 5' region of the gene. All other MspI sites were methylated in all cell lines. Furthermore, 5-azacytidine induced the demethylation and the expression of the alpha Fc gamma R gene in the Fc gamma R(-) thymoma BW5147. Both alpha Fc gamma R gene transcripts and corresponding protein products became detectable in 5-azacytidine-treated cells. The alpha Fc gamma R gene was also demethylated and expressed in mouse spleen cells cultured with human rIL-2. We conclude that a correlation links the unmethylation and the expression of the alpha Fc gamma R gene in murine cell lines as well as in nontransformed lymphoid cells responding to a physiological stimulus.\r"

  ".W": "Three allotypes of murine factor H have been identified serologically in the previous study (denoted H.1, H.2, and H.3). A cDNA clone coding for the entire length of murine factor H was isolated from a library constructed from the livers of STR/N mice which have H.2 allotype and was fully sequenced. The insert of this clone (STR309) contained 4184 nucleotides and consisted of a 47-bp 5' noncoding region, a 54-bp coding for leader peptide, a 3648 bp for the mature factor H protein, and a 435-bp 3' noncoding region. Compared with the previously reported sequence of the cDNA clone (MH8) isolated from B10.WR mice that have H.1 allotype, the size of the protein coding region was exactly the same, but 21 nucleotide substitutions resulting in 15 amino acid replacements were observed. The amino acid replacement/nucleotide substitution ratio (0.71) is far higher than those observed in the allotypic variations of other proteins. Four 15-base oligonucleotide probes specific for either STR309 or MH8 were synthesized and used in Northern blot analysis. The probes specific for STR309 hybridized with mRNA isolated from the livers of STR/N mice but not with mRNA from the livers of BALB/c mice that have H.1 allotype, whereas the reverse pattern was observed with the oligonucleotide probes specific for MH8. These results strongly suggest that the nucleotide sequence of STR309 represents H.2 allotype of factor H protein, providing an example of an unusual allotype with high ratio of amino acid replacements to nucleotide substitutions.\r"

  ".W": "Full length cDNA clones encoding the mouse Fc gamma RI were isolated by using redundant oligonucleotide probes based on previously determined amino acid sequence of protein bound to an IgG2a antibody column. Sequence analysis of cDNA clones indicates that mouse Fc gamma RI is a transmembrane glycoprotein that is composed of three disulfide bonded extracellular Ig binding domains unlike Fc gamma RII of man and mouse. These extracellular domains contain five potential sites of N-linked glycosylation; three sites in the first domain and one in each of the second and third domains. In addition a transmembrane region is present followed by a cytoplasmic tail of 84 amino acids. Analysis of the amino acid sequence of the first two extracellular domains of Fc gamma RI indicate that these are highly homologous to the extracellular domains of Fc gamma RII; the third domain is different and shows a lower level of homology to other FcR domains but is clearly related to the Ig super-family. Transfected cells expressing Fc gamma RI were shown to bind immune complexes of rabbit IgG; and monomeric IgG2a bound to transiently transfected cells with an affinity of approximately 5 x 10(7) M-1, i.e. the receptor was of high affinity and therefore was by definition Fc gamma RI. Northern analysis demonstrated that Fc gamma RI mRNA could be detected in the Fc gamma RI+ myeloid cell lines WEH1 3B and J774. Finally, Southern analysis indicated that Fc gamma RI is likely to be encoded by a single copy gene of approximately 9 kb.\r"

  ".W": "Lethally irradiated (C57BL/6xC3H)F1 mice are able to acutely reject parental C57BL/6 but not C3H marrow grafts, a phenomenon called hybrid resistance (HR). In attempts to inactivate this rejection mechanism we found that parental spleen cells activated with LPS are very potent in inducing tolerance to a subsequent C57BL/6 marrow graft. Tolerance is likely due to elimination of effector cells responsible for graft rejection as adoptive transfer of spleen cells from normal into tolerized mice reconstitutes responsiveness. Evidence is presented that the Ag on LPS-activated spleen cells responsible for induction of unresponsiveness are expressed on both C57BL/6 and (C57BL/6xC3H)F1 cells. This suggests that the HR effector cells recognize autoantigens. In support of this, induction of tolerance to C57BL/6 parental marrow grafts leads to a concomitant dramatic increase in endogenous CFU-spleen after a dose of gamma-irradiation. Moreover, elimination of the cells responsible for HR by injection of anti-ASGM1 antibody results in a similar increase of endogenous CFU-spleen after irradiation. It is concluded that HR is a reflection of autoimmunity, able to limit the proliferation of syngeneic marrow stem cells.\r"

  ".W": "The immune response of BALB/c mice against the so-called thymus-independent bacterial Ag alpha(1----3) dextran (Dex) is restricted to the expression of few major idiotypes (Id). It is furthermore under the control of T lymphocytes which regulate the isotype expression in such a way that they prevent anti-Dex IgG antibody production upon immunization. At the same time these T cells are part of a regulatory system for Dex-specific B cell memory formation. The underlying Ts cell activity has previously been analyzed by using euthymic and athymic congenic animals. Now we have isolated CD4-positive Id-specific T cell lines and clones which by several criteria are representatives of the above Ts cells. They inhibit in vitro proliferation and antibody secretion of Dex-specific hybridoma B cells. They prevent Id-restricted in vivo IgG anti-Dex antibody formation in T cell-reconstituted BALB/c nu/nu mice. At the same time they enforce, again Id-specific, accumulation of Dex-specific B memory cells. As has been shown previously under the influence of splenic Ts cells, these B memory cells are arrested in the original host but can be expanded and activated for anti-Dex IgG antibody formation upon adoptive transfer into X-irradiated allotype congenic nonresponder BALB.Ighb mice. The data show that the regulatory influence of T cells on the anti-Dex response is Id specific. It can now be studied by means of cloned Ts cells.\r"

We have further analyzed human newborns' B cell characteristics and found that approximately half of them express activation Ag, i.e., 4F2 and IL-2R, both associated in significant proportions with CD23 and Bac-1. These membrane Ag were found both on CD5(+) and CD5(-) B cells. Newborns' B cells do not exhibit other activation markers because they express surface IgD, and because their size, RNA, and DNA contents do not differ from those of adults' B cells, indicating that they are in the G0/G1 cell cycle phase. Newborns' B cell proliferation can be induced by rIL-2, rIL-4, low m.w. B cell growth factor, and by Staphylococcus aureus protein A. It is presently difficult to build a hypothesis accounting for all the specific findings made on newborns' B cells. It is not known for instance whether CD5(+) and (-) B cells belong to distinct subsets as suggested by the fluorescence intensity curve obtained with an anti-CD5 antibody or to distinct stages in a unique pattern of B cell maturation during fetal and newborn life. This may indicate that partially activated B cells actually produce natural polyspecific autoantibodies of the IgM isotype found in newborns' human serum.\r"

This subpopulation was not found in scid/scid low density nylon wool nonadherent BM but was present at similar frequency in both nude and normal BM and expressed comparable fluorescence intensity.

Whereas 60% of nude J11d+ CD3+ cells expressed a TCR-alpha/beta and 40% expressed a gamma/delta TCR, almost no TCR-gamma/delta expressing cells were detected in dim CD3+ cells from normal mice in either the J11d+ or J11d- subpopulation. The majority of those cells express a TCR-alpha/beta. We established that nude dim CD3+ CD4- CD8- cells were distinguishable from mature recirculating T cells and developed an in vitro clonal culture system that supported the growth of these cells. When these cells were cocultured in vitro in a limiting dilution system with inactivated anti-CD3 mAb-secreting cells, in the presence of rIL-2 and rIL-4, one in 5 x 10(2) to 1 x 10(3) cells were growth inducible. Most progeny cells expressed a CD3+ CD8+ CD4- surface phenotype. Cultures displayed nonspecific cytolytic reactivity. With the use of a sensitive dot-blot technique, transcripts coding for C alpha, C beta, VC gamma, and C delta TCR genes were detected in these cultures. Rehybridization experiments demonstrated mutually exclusive expression of either C alpha or C delta mRNA transcripts in the majority of clones selected for a high probability of clonality. Most (greater than 95%) of T cell clones derived from normal BM expressed the C alpha transcript with approximately 5% expressing the C delta transcript. In contrast, about 40% of T cell clones derived from nude BM expressed the C delta transcript whereas the remaining 60% expressed 10-fold lower C alpha message than normal BM-derived clones.\r"

  ".W": "Mycoplasma arthritidis produces a soluble protein which is active for murine and human lymphocytes when presented by Ia-bearing accessory cells. By using fibroblasts transfected in vitro with various class II Ag, we demonstrated that presentation of the M. arthritidis mitogen (MAM) to T cells was mediated by E alpha-containing molecules. We also showed that splenocytes from transgenic mice expressing E alpha heterozygously (B10.TRG E alpha+) or homozygously (B10.E alpha TG +/+) underwent a similar proliferation in response to MAM as compared with the failure of control B10.TRG E alpha- splenocytes to respond to MAM. Although splenocytes from inbred C3H and CBA mice exhibited much higher proliferative responses to MAM than did those from B10.TRG.E alpha+ or B10.E alpha TG +/+ mice, flow cytometry showed similar levels of E alpha expression. Furthermore, gamma-irradiated splenocytes from B10.TRG E alpha + mice presented MAM to T hybridoma cells with a similar efficacy as did splenocytes from C3H mice. The lesser response to MAM of lymphocytes from the E alpha transgenic mice as compared with those from C3H and B10.K mice was likewise not due to differential expression of their V beta TCR. We conclude that presentation of MAM to T cells is accomplished by E alpha-containing molecules. The studies also suggest that the conserved, nonpolymorphic regions of class II molecules may play an important role in host immune response to microbial products.\r"

  ".U": "90111052\r", 
  ".W": "Six clonotypically unique T cell hybridomas from Lewis rats were used to study accessory cell activities required for class II MHC restricted T cell responses to the 68-86 encephalitogenic sequence of myelin basic protein (MBP). T cell hybrids which were cultured with GP68-86 68-86 sequence of guinea pig MBP (GPMBP) and naive splenocytes (SPL) were induced to produce IL-2 as measured by the CTLL indicator cell line. The hybrids were categorized into two subsets (designated THYB-1 and THYB-2), because two distinct subset-specific pathways of communication between accessory cells and T cells were involved in GPMBP-induced IL-2 production. These pathways were distinguished by the following six observations. First, when the duration of a pulse of SPL with GPMBP was lengthened from 1 to 4 h, these SPL lost their ability to induce IL-2 production by THYB-2 hybrids yet nevertheless retained full stimulatory activity for THYB-1 hybrids. Second, paraformaldehyde fixation of GPMBP-pulsed SPL abrogated an activity necessary for Ag-induced IL-2 production by THYB-2 hybrids. These fixed SPL were nevertheless able to stimulate THYB-1 hybrids, albeit to a lesser extent than viable unfixed SPL. Third, the addition of either cycloheximide, cytochalasin B, or 2-deoxyglucose to an Ag pulse of SPL with GPMBP dramatically inhibited the subsequent responses of THYB-2 hybrids yet had little or no effect upon the reactivity of THYB-1 hybrids. Fourth, thymocytes lacked necessary activities for GPMBP evoked IL-2 production by THYB-2 hybrids yet strongly promoted THYB-1 hybrid responses. Fifth, exposure of SPL to as little as 500 rad of gamma-irradiation markedly attenuated THYB-2 hybrid response to GPMBP but did not affect THYB-1 responses. Sixth, anti-GPMBP responses by THYB-2 hybrids were observed only in the presence of both radioresistant adherent SPL and a distinct population of radiosensitive nonadherent SPL. Conversely, THYB-1 hybrids exhibited full reactivity to GPMBP in the presence of adherent radioresistant SPL. Together, these observations reveal that two distinct accessory cell-T cell pathways mediate immune recognition of the 68-86 encephalitogenic region of MBP. Furthermore, these results indicate that subsets of Th cells can be defined by the accessory cell type-specific interactions that are necessary for Ag-mediated responses.\r"

  ".W": "Mechanisms of cyclophosphamide (CP)-induced tolerance were studied. When AKR/J Sea (AKR: H-2k) mice were primed i.v. with 5 x 10(7) spleen cells plus 1 x 10(7) bone marrow cells from [C57BL/6 Slc (B6; H-2b) x C3H/He Slc (C3H; H-2k)]F1 (B6C3F1) mice and treated i.p. with 200 mg/kg CP 2 days later, the survival of C3H skin was moderately prolonged, but the survival of either B6 or B6C3F1 skin was not prolonged. By this treatment, however, mixed chimerism of B6C3F1 cells in the AKR mice was not established. When C3H cells were used as the tolerogen, a minimal degree of mixed chimerism associated with profound tolerance to C3H skin was established. Similar results were observed in various donor-recipient combinations. When C3H skin was grafted in the AKR mice 12 wk after the treatment with C3H cells and CP, or B6C3F1 cells and CP, survival of the grafted C3H skin was prolonged remarkably or moderately, respectively, although mixed chimerism was not detectable at the timing of grafting in either of the groups. In this late stage of tolerance, a strong level of tolerogen-specific suppressor cell activity was observed in those tolerant AKR mice. The suppressor activity was mainly attributable to T cells. These results suggest that the role of Ts cells in order to maintain skin tolerance is important in our CP-induced tolerance system, especially in the late stage of tolerance. Moreover, the generation of the Ts cells does not necessarily require the establishment of a long term mixed chimeric state.\r"

Because IL-6 (B cell stimulatory factor 2) plays an essential role in the differentiation of activated B cells to Ig-secreting cells, and because IL-6 production is induced by exposure of human PBMC to HIV, we measured the level of circulating plasma IL-6, spontaneously-produced IL-6, and IL-6 mRNA in HIV-infected donors and in healthy control donors. Elevated levels of plasma IL-6 and IL-6 mRNA were detected in HIV-infected donors. PBMC isolated from the peripheral circulation of HIV-infected donors, and cultured without added exogenous activators of IL-6 production, produced markedly elevated amounts of IL-6 when compared with cells isolated from healthy donors. Interestingly, levels of an acute-phase protein, which is known to be induced by IL-6, was also increased in HIV-infected donors. These results demonstrate that elevated levels of IL-6 are associated with HIV-infection, and suggest that IL-6 over-production may contribute to the polyclonal B cell activation seen in AIDS and HIV infection.\r"

The relative contribution and temporal association of these processes to the genesis of systemic autoimmunity are incompletely understood. To study this relationship, the B cell repertoires of MRL-lpr/lpr mice were analyzed by ELISA spot assay over an 8-mo period. Between 6 and 12 wk of age, the number of splenic lymphocytes producing antibodies reactive with both autoantigens and conventional Ag increased proportionately. The repertoires of MRL-lpr/lpr mice under 12 wk were dominated by IgM-secreting B cells that showed no bias toward the production of specific autoantibodies. From 12 to 38 wk of age, an increasing proportion of animals developed repertoires dominated by IgG-secreting B cells that were skewed toward reactivity against one or very few (auto)antigens. Although there was no single Ag against which all mice developed skewed reactivity, 55% of MRL-lpr/lpr adults had increased numbers of B cells producing antibodies to the Sm Ag and 13 to 16% developed increased reactivity toward DNA, myosin, histone, thyroglobulin, or T cells. These data indicate that generalized (polyclonal) B cell activation dominates early repertoire development whereas (auto)-antigen-specific responses become increasingly important during the latter stages of disease in these autoimmune-prone mice.\r"

We assessed CD4 function by measuring the ability of CD4+ T cells to form conjugates with cell size lipid vesicles, artificial target cells (ATC), bearing the natural ligand for CD4, MHC class II proteins. Conjugate formation was a transient process with the greatest number of specific cell to ATC conjugates found after approximately 30 min of incubation at 37 degrees C. Addition of gp120 specifically blocked conjugates between CD4+ cells and class II ATC in a concentration-dependent manner. These data indicate that T lymphocyte adhesion mediated by CD4 is a dynamic event and that binding of gp120 to CD4 is able to disrupt the normal progression of the interaction between CD4+ T lymphocytes and class II+ APC.\r"

Two mAb that react with the leukocyte adhesion molecule 1 (LAM1) were produced and used to examine the cell-surface expression of LAM1. The anti-LAM1 antibodies were reactive with the majority of blood lymphocytes, NK cells, neutrophils, and monocytes. LAM1 was also expressed by subpopulations of phenotypically immature and mature thymocytes. Blood lymphocytes rapidly modulated LAM1 from the cell surface during PMA exposure for 60 min. Coordinate with the loss of LAM1 from the cell surface, PMA-treated lymphocytes lost the ability to bind to lymph node high endothelial venules, indicating that expression of LAM1 may play a role in lymphocyte homing. Mitogen stimulation of blood T and B lymphocytes also resulted in decreased LAM1 expression, but at a slower rate. LAM1 was only weakly expressed by a minority of spleen lymphocytes. However, culturing spleen lymphocytes in media alone resulted in increased expression of LAM1 by a subpopulation of the cells (40 to 60%). Concomitant mitogen stimulation of spleen lymphocytes resulted initially in down-regulation of LAM1 expression followed by increased expression of LAM1 and then subsequent loss of LAM1 from the cell surface. The pattern of anti-LAM1 antibody reactivity was identical to that reported for the TQ1 and Leu-8 antibodies, and all of these antibodies reacted with cells transfected with the LAM1 cDNA. Thus, LAM1 is broadly expressed by leukocytes, and binding of LAM1 may participate in the process of leukocyte extravasation into lymphoid organs or sites of acute inflammation with subsequent loss of LAM1 from the cell surface.\r"

  ".W": "Antibody responses to recall vaccines can be adoptively transferred after marrow transplantation in man. Transfer of responses to priming Ag has not been successful, although this would broaden the range of organisms to which recipients could be protected. To investigate the importance of T cells and Ag in such transfer we primed marrow donors with keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH) 1 or 3 wk before marrow harvesting. B cells secreting IgM and IgG anti-KLH antibody were present in donor marrow at both 1 and 3 wk after immunization. After T cell depletion, donor marrow was infused into chemo-irradiated recipients, half of whom were immunized pretransplant with KLH. We found no evidence for the transfer of the IgM component of the response. Clonal expansion of the transferred IgG antibody-secreting cells with a corresponding rise in recipient serum IgG antibody levels was seen only when donors were primed 3 wk before marrow harvest and when the recipients were also immunized. IEF and immunoblotting demonstrated that successful transfer coincided with maturation of the IgG primary response from a polyclonal to an oligoclonal pattern and confirmed that donor oligoclonal bands appeared in the recipient serum. We conclude that the immunization protocols required for the transfer of antibody responses to priming Ag reflect the initial dependence of unprimed B cells on T cell help and on prolonged Ag stimulation. Ag-stimulated primary B cells in T cell-depleted marrow respond only to the noncognate growth and differentiation signals available in the chemo-irradiated recipient after an initial period of clonal selection and expansion in the donor which is both T cell and Ag dependent. Even after this initial selection, continued expansion of antibody-secreting clones in recipients retains an absolute dependence on Ag stimulation. Immunization techniques to protect transplant recipients against organisms such as Pseudomonas and CMV may need to be modified accordingly.\r"

IL-6 alone induced minimal incorporation of [3H]thymidine by unstimulated or Staphylococcus aureus (SA)-stimulated B cells and did not augment proliferation induced by SA and IL-2. Similarly, IL-6 alone did not support the generation of Ig-secreting cells (ISC) or induce the secretion of Ig by unstimulated or SA-stimulated B cells. However, IL-6 did augment the generation of ISC and the secretion of all isotypes of Ig induced by SA and IL-2. Maximal enhancement of B cell responsiveness by IL-6 required its presence from the initiation of culture. Delaying the addition of IL-6 to B cells stimulated with SA and IL-2 beyond 24 h diminished its effect on ISC generation. However, increased Ig production but not ISC generation was observed when IL-6 was added to B cells that had been preactivated for 48 h with SA and IL-2. This effect was most marked when the activated B cells were also stimulated with IL-2. IL-6 in combination with other cytokines such as IL-1 and IL-4 did not induce the secretion of Ig or generation of ISC in the absence of IL-2. Moreover, antibody to IL-6 did not inhibit the effect of IL-2 on the growth and differentiation of B cells stimulated with SA, but did inhibit the IL-6-induced augmentation of Ig secretion by B cells stimulated with SA and IL-2. IL-6 alone enhanced T cell dependent induction of B cell differentiation stimulated by PWM. Part of this enhancement was related to its capacity to increase the production of IL-2 in these cultures. These results indicate that IL-6 has several direct enhancing effects on the differentiation of B cells, all of which are at least in part dependent on the presence of IL-2. In addition, IL-6 can indirectly increase B cell differentiation by increasing IL-2 production by T cells.\r"

We studied the expression of FcRIII of cultured monocytes in detail and compared its structure with FcRIII of neutrophils and NK cells. The cell density of FcRIII reached a plateau within 3 days of culturing. During that time, the expression of FcRI and FcRIIa, also present on monocytes, did not change significantly. FcRIII on cultured monocytes lacked, as did NK cell FcRIII, the NA1-allotypic variant of the NA system present on the neutrophil FcRIII. Studies with glycosyl-phosphatidyl-inositol-specific phospholipase C and analysis of cells of patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria revealed that FcRIII on cultured monocytes is not anchored by phosphatidyl-inositol-glycan in the cell membrane. Similarly, FcRIII on NK cells was resistant to glycosyl-phosphatidyl-inositol-specific phospholipase C treatment, suggesting that NK cell FcRIII is also not anchored by a phosphatidyl-inositol-glycan moiety, in contrast to neutrophil FcRIII. Analysis by SDS-PAGE showed that the FcRIII of cultured monocytes had a similar mobility as the FcRIII on NK cells, but was clearly distinct from neutrophil FcRIII. Treatment with N-glycanase showed that the protein backbone of deglycosylated FcRIII of cultured monocytes was similar to that of FcRIII of NK cells, but deglycosylated neutrophil FcRIII was different. Specific blocking of FcRIII of cultured monocytes with an anti-FcRIII mAb did not reduced the lytic action of the cultured monocytes towards sensitized erythrocytes. However, FcRIII was modulated from the cell surface by incubation with sensitized E, whereas non-FcR Ag were not. These findings indicate that FcRIII is involved in binding of immune complexes, but does not act as a trigger molecule for extracellular lysis of sensitized E.\r"

Previous studies in Shreffler's laboratory have shown that the structural difference between the two allotypes lies within a single tryptic peptide of the C4 alpha-chain and that the sequences of this fragment from the two allotypes (determined from nucleic acid sequences of genomic clones) differ only by the substitution of arginine in C4d.2 for glutamine in C4d.1. Hence this single amino acid change apparently is responsible for the rather striking serological difference between the two allotypes. To test this conclusion, we have used site-specific mutagenesis to alter the sequence of a full-length C4 cDNA that was derived from a mouse strain expressing the C4d.2 allotype. We substituted a glutamine codon for the arginine codon at the specified site and expressed both mutant and parent recombinant C4 proteins by transient transfection of COS cells. We found that an alloantiserum specific for C4d.1 reacts with the mutant protein but not the parent whereas an alloantiserum specific for C4d.2 reacts with the parent protein, as expected, but not the mutant. These results confirm that a single amino acid difference specifies the C4d.1 and C4d.2 allotypes.\r"

During amyloidogenesis in mice, the C-terminal portion of SAA that consists of 28 amino acids is cleaved off to produce the 75 amino acid AA. Of three known isotypes of SAA, SAA2 has been identified as amyloidogenic. For differential immunologic recognition of SAA and AA, antisera were generated in rabbits against AA protein and a synthetic peptide corresponding to the C-terminal (amino acids 84 to 103) of murine SAA2. The anti-AA antiserum reacted with AA and SAA, but the anti-peptide antiserum reacted with SAA only. Immunohistochemically anti-peptide antiserum predominantly stained the rims of murine amyloid deposits. In contrast, anti-AA antiserum generated an overall homogeneous staining of amyloid deposits. The data lend support to a view that SAA are concentrated in the vicinity of the surrounding cells (mostly macrophages) where they are processed to AA, or that SAA are deposited initially as components of the amyloid fibrils onto the outside margin of amyloid deposits and the C-terminus is cleaved off as maturation of the amyloid fibril progresses.\r"

  ".W": "We studied the effect of adenosine nucleotides on several aspects of the functional activation of human peripheral blood polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN). Radiolabeled ATP bound to PMN in a manner suggesting the existence of specific binding sites because: 1) binding was reversed (92 +/- 6%) by 100-fold excess concentrations of unlabeled ATP but minimally by either ADP (43 +/- 12%) or GTP (37 +/- 8%); and 2) binding saturation was achieved (i.e., specific binding did not increase) above 250 microM ATP. Binding studies revealed that significant ATP hydrolysis occurred, even at low temperatures and in the presence of phosphatase inhibitors. Adenosine nucleotides activated signal transduction mechanisms in PMN because: 1) 1 to 100 microM ATP and 5'-adenylylimidodiphosphate (AMP-PNP) stimulated increased production of 1,2-diacylglycerols; 2) ATP (0.5 to 500 microM) and ADP (0.1 to 10 mM) induced increased insoluble protein kinase (PKC) activity in a dose-dependent manner when used at concentrations greater than 50 microM; 3) ATP (greater than or equal to 50 microM) induced a shift in the solubility of phorbol receptors from mostly soluble (89% in untreated cells) to mostly insoluble (68%), whereas ADP, GTP, and GDP were effective at higher concentrations; and 4) greater than or equal to 50 microM ATP stimulated increased phosphorylation of endogenous PMN proteins. AMP-PNP induced PKC activity and phosphoprotein changes that were qualitatively similar to those observed when PMN were treated with ATP, suggesting that extracellular ATP hydrolysis is not required for signal transduction to activate PKC. Functionally, ATP stimulated the secretion of specific (but not azurophil) granules because vitamin B12-binding protein and low levels of lysozyme, but not beta-glucuronidase, were released; qualitatively similar results were obtained by using AMP-PNP. These results suggest that certain adenosine nucleotides employed at physiologically relevant concentrations stimulate increased 1,2-diacylglycerol production, PKC activity, granule secretion, and endogenous phosphoprotein formation in a manner that is independent of extracellular ATP hydrolysis.\r"

This Ag is also expressed on mature forms of granulocytes. We studied the effects of CD24 mAb on the function of both lymphocytic and myeloid cell types. We found a clear-cut increase in free cytoplasmic calcium when tonsil B cells or mononuclear cells from B cell chronic lymphatic leukemia patients were preincubated with CD24 mAb and further stimulated with goat F(ab')2 anti-mouse Ig antibodies. The same experimental setting with granulocytes instead of B lymphocytes led to the triggering of hydrogen peroxide production in these cells. CD24 Ag is expressed at higher levels on activated granulocytes and is anchored to the plasma membrane by a phosphoinositol linkage. In conclusion we provide evidence that the CD24 Ag are functional molecules in cells of different lineage, playing a signal transducing role in cell function.\r"

  ".W": "Tyrosine phosphorylation is an early biochemical event associated with surface receptor triggering in many cellular systems. In T lymphocytes, Ag receptor (CD3-Ti) stimulation results in tyrosine phosphorylation of the CD3 zeta subunit. The tyrosine kinase responsible for this modification after CD3-Ti triggering has not been identified. Here we reported that a 68-kDa T cell membrane-associated protein (pp68) in human Jurkat T cells is phosphorylated on tyrosine residues within 1 min after anti-CD3 mAb addition. This induced tyrosine phosphorylation is detected either by in vivo [32P]orthophosphate labeling of the Jurkat T cells or by in vitro [32P]ATP labeling after immunoprecipitation by antiphosphotyrosine antibody. In contrast, mAb stimulation via CD2 and CD4 structures does not induce phosphorylation of pp68. These data are among the first to provide evidence that CD3-Ti and CD2 activation pathways are distinct. Furthermore, they imply that pp68 is itself a tyrosine kinase and/or is a rapidly phosphorylated substrate of a tyrosine kinase.\r"

  ".U": "90111083\r", 
  ".W": "Previous reports demonstrate that cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HEC) treated with TNF and other inflammatory mediators show an increased capacity to adhere human neutrophils. This increase is associated with the up-regulation of intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) and other adhesion molecules on the HEC surface. We have found that 200 microM 3-deazaadenosine (c3Ado) prevented this TNF-induced increase in HEC adhesiveness. This effect resulted from interactions of c3Ado with HEC and not with polymorphonuclear neutrophils. Transport of c3Ado into the HEC was required for its activity, as evidenced by antagonism with the nucleoside transport inhibitor, nitrobenzylthioinosine. Treatment of HEC with c3Ado led to the intracellular buildup of S-adenosylhomocysteine and to the metabolic formation of S-3-deazaadenosylhomocysteine and 3-deazaadenosine 5'-triphosphate, events that appeared not to contribute to c3Ado activity. Exogenous L-homocysteine potentiated c3Ado activity, and this potentiation was prevented by the S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase inhibitor, periodate-oxidized adenosine. By using the mAb RR1/1, we have determined that c3Ado also inhibited the TNF-induced expression of ICAM-1 on the surface of the HEC, as well as cytosol-associated ICAM-1. Northern blot and in vitro translation analyses of poly(A+) RNA from c3Ado-treated HEC revealed that this nucleoside analog selectively decreased steady-state levels of ICAM-1 mRNA. The capacity of c3Ado to selectively inhibit HEC adhesiveness, ICAM-1 production, and steady-state levels of ICAM-1 mRNA may contribute to the drug's activity as an anti-inflammatory agent.\r"

  ".W": "Neutrophil granules contain proteins important in host defense against bacterial pathogens. Granule proteins released from activated neutrophils facilitate opsonization, phagocytosis, tissue digestion, and antimicrobial activity. Three similar, if not identical, neutrophil proteins, bactericidal/permeability-increasing protein (BPI), 57,000 m.w. cationic antimicrobial protein, and bactericidal protein have been described that specifically kill gram negative bacteria. Since LPS is a structure common to all gram-negative bacteria, we investigated whether the microbicidal protein BPI affects biologic activity of LPS in vitro. Human neutrophils can be activated both in vitro and in vivo by LPS. Upon stimulation, surface expression of CR1 and CR3 increases markedly. Using flow microfluorimetry, we analyzed surface expression of CR1 and CR3 as a measure of neutrophil stimulation in response to LPS. CR up-regulation on neutrophils was TNF independent, suggesting direct LPS stimulation of neutrophils in this system. Purified BPI completely inhibited CR up-regulation on neutrophils stimulated with both rough and smooth LPS chemotypes at 1.8 to 3.6 nM (100 to 200 ng/ml). By comparison, the polypeptide antibiotic polymyxin B completely inhibited the same dose of LPS at 0.4 nM. The inhibitory activity of BPI appeared to be specific for LPS because neutrophil stimulation by formylated peptide or TNF was unaffected. The specificity of BPI for LPS was further demonstrated by inhibition of LPS activity in the limulus amebocyte lysate assay. Therefore, the role of BPI in infection may not be limited to its microbicidal activity, but it may also regulate the neutrophil response to LPS.\r"

  ".W": "Degranulation of CTL stimulated by alloantigen-bearing target cells is shown to be inhibited by short term exposure to low concentrations of long chain cis unsaturated free fatty acids (FFA), whereas saturated FFA have no effect. The Ag-specific (TCR mediated) stimulation of cloned murine CTL was monitored by changes in intracellular calcium concentrations [( Ca2+]i) using the fluorescence indicator acetoxymethylester of fura-2 and by degranulation as measured by the release of BLT-esterase. Treatment of the CTL cells with any of the physiologically important FFA; oleic (18:1), linoleic (18:2), linolenic (18:3), or arachidonic (20:4) acid, at concentrations between 1 and 10 microM inhibits the target cell-mediated rise in [Ca2+]i which occurs within seconds of stimulation and the release of BLT-esterase, which occurs over a period of 1 to 3 h. These inhibitory effects are observed within seconds to minutes of FFA addition. Inhibition can be reversed by treating cells with fatty acid free BSA and, in agreement with our previous studies, indicates that the effects of FFA are due to physical perturbations of cellular components. To determine the locus of this perturbation, the effect of FFA on the lipid order of CTL plasma membrane was determined using fluorescence polarization of the membrane impermeable probe trimethylammoniumdiphenylhexatriene. Cis unsaturated FFA were found to disorder the lipid acyl chains and the degree of disorder was found to increase with the degree of cis unsaturation. These results, together with the previous studies, suggest that inhibition results from a physical perturbation of plasma membrane lipid order. Moreover, because degranulation requires elevated levels of [Ca2+]i, it is likely that inhibition of degranulation results from a FFA-induced decrease in Ca2+ permeability through the membrane.\r"

The culture of single CTMC and the serum-free culture of CTMC fractionated by Percoll density gradient centrifugation showed that this synergistic action of IL-3 and TPA required no effects of accessory cells or other humoral factors. Although the populations of CTMC acted on by TPA and IL-4 seemed to be close to each other, the velocity of colony growth induced by the simultaneous stimulation of the combination of TPA and IL-4 was faster than that induced by either TPA or IL-4 in the presence of IL-3. In addition, the addition of anti-IL-4 antibody did not neutralize the effect of TPA on the proliferation of CTMC. These results suggest that TPA and IL-4 act on the proliferation of CTMC synergistically with IL-3 via a different pathway. Beside TPA, other phorbol derivatives capable of activating protein kinase C (PKC) induced the proliferation of CTMC synergistically with IL-3, but phorbol derivatives which were unable to activate PKC did not. These results indicate that the activation of PKC is involved in the process of TPA action on the proliferation of CTMC. Furthermore, the facts that 1-oleoyl-2-acetylglycerol, which activated membrane PKC transiently, and staurosporine, which has been reported to inhibit PKC, did not induce the proliferation of CTMC in the presence of IL-3 and that the effect of TPA was exhibited by the sustained stimulation suggest that the action of TPA on the proliferation of CTMC requires at least two steps. The first one is the primary activation of membrane PKC and the second one is the disappearance of PKC from the cells, \"down-regulation.\"\r"

Antibodies to gp70-2 recognize in promastigotes multiple discrete bands of similar m.w. which are common to several isolates of L. donovani. The total amount of Ag and number of bands observed per isolate is not constant. Lectin blots with Con A show gp70-2 to be a glycoprotein. Dp72 shows pronounced microheterogeneity between isolates of L. donovani. The Brazilian isolates examined appear to possess a lower m.w. form (64,000 or 68,000) of this molecule. No reactions were observed with dp72 and lectins in Western blots; and neither tunicamycin, N-glycanase, endoglycosidase H nor F affected the migration of [35S]-methionine-labeled protein on SDS-PAGE. A mAb against dp72 also cross-reacted in Western blots with a 60-kDa protein in Leishmania major, Leishmania aethiopica, and Leishmania tropica. No reaction was observed between the purified promastigote surface protease (gp63) and either monoclonal or polyclonal antibodies produced to dp72 or gp70-2. The ability of the pure proteins to provide protection against a challenge by L. donovani amastigotes was examined. BALB/c mice were immunized with gp70-2 and/or dp72 by using Corynebacterium parvum as an adjuvant. Mice immunized with gp70-2 were not protected; however, mice receiving dp72 showed a 81.1% reduction in the liver parasitemia compared with the adjuvant controls.\r"

We have isolated and sequenced a HLA class I cDNA clone, which probably corresponds to this molecule, from a library derived from BeWo. The nucleotide sequence shows a high degree of homology with the published sequence of a genomic clone, HLA 6.0, which is the product of a class I locus other than A, B, or C, (provisionally designated \"HLA G\"). The expressed product of this locus has not previously been localized. We have used the polymerase chain reaction to demonstrate the presence of similar HLA class I sequences in cDNA from normal extravillous trophoblast. Although there is some nucleotide sequence polymorphism the amino acid sequence of this molecule is conserved. It is therefore unlikely to provoke immune responses even though it is found at the fetal-maternal interface.\r"

  ".W": "Decay accelerating factor (DAF) is a glycophospholipid-anchored membrane protein that is part of the regulators of complement activation (RCA) gene family located on human chromosome 1, band q32. These proteins, beginning at their amino terminus, consist largely of multiple copies of an approximately 60 amino acid short consensus repeat (SCR). A DAF cDNA clone was used to identify overlapping bacteriophage genomic clones. The human DAF gene spans approximately 40 kb and consists of 11 exons. The length of these exons and introns varies considerably, with the exons ranging from 21 to 956 bp and the introns ranging from approximately 0.5 to 19.8 kb. SCR I, II, and IV are all encoded by single exons; however, SCR III is encoded by two separate exons, with the splice junction occurring after the second nucleotide of the codon for the glycine residue at position 34 of the consensus sequence. This feature has also been found in CR1, CR2, membrane cofactor protein, and murine factor H. Following the SCR in DAF is a 76 amino acid serine/threonine-rich domain encoded on three separate exons. Exon 10 encodes the Alu family sequence that has been found as an insert in a minor class of DAF cDNA, thus indicating that this mRNA arises by standard alternative splicing. The last DAF exon, which comes after the largest intron of 19.8 kb, encodes the hydrophobic carboxy terminus and the 3'UT region. The nature of the signal that directs posttranslational attachment of a glycophospholipid anchor to DAF is not known, but that signal is apparently spread over three exons and greater than 20 kb. An analysis of the DAF gene provides additional evidence for the common evolutionary heritage of the RCA gene family. The exon/intron structure of this gene will facilitate experiments aimed at understanding the functions of the various domains of DAF.\r"

Somatic variation of the Ig genes expressed by B cell tumors can lead to loss of reactivity with anti-Id antibodies and escape of tumors from the therapeutic effects of such antibodies. In our study, we have used anti-Id antibodies to screen for variants within a cell line derived from a patient with a large cell lymphoma of the B cell type. Cells were simultaneously stained on their surface for idiotypic and for isotypic Ig determinants using reagents labeled with different fluorochromes. Tumor cells expressing intact Ig molecules with alteration of their idiotypic determinants were isolated with the fluorescence activated cell sorter. Idiotypic variation was an ongoing process in vitro with Id- variants being generated at a rate of 2.7 x 10(-4)/cell per generation and Ig- cells being produced at a rate of 1.31 x 10(-5)/cell per generation. Subcloned variants expressed subtle differences in reactivity with a panel of three non-cross-blocking anti-Id antibodies. Analysis of Ig gene rearrangements by the Southern blotting technique using a JH probe established that the variants and the original tumor cells were all clonally related. Immunoprecipitation of surface labeled Ig molecules from the variant subclones disclosed major alterations of the lambda-L chains with no gross alterations of the mu-H chains. Related studies have established that the tumor cells undergo rearrangement and expression of new lambda-L chain genes.\r"

In this study we have measured expression of an idiotope which reacts with a tumor-protective anti-idiotypic antibody, 2F10, in the sera of mice bearing the L1210/GZL tumor. The levels of antibodies binding to 2F10, referred to as the \"2F10 idiotope,\" are different in individual mice and also fluctuate over time. A statistical analysis demonstrated a significant correlation between these changes in 2F10 levels in mice with tumors and their survival times. Increasing 2F10 idiotope in sera of tumor mice correlated with long-term survival, whereas a decreasing trend was found in mice which died shortly after tumor transfer. Correlations between the 2F10 idiotope and survival were observed in groups of mice which had received surgery, cyclophosphamide, a combination of cyclophosphamide and anti-idiotype, or no treatment at all. No correlation between a nonrelated idiotope and survival was noted. Although 2F10 is an idiotope expressed by an anti-tumor-associated Ag antibody, the correlation between anti-tumor-associated Ag titers and survival was significantly lower than that between the 2F10 idiotope and survival. This demonstrates that 2F10 is preferentially associated with antibodies which are involved in tumor regression. Thus, the 2F10 idiotope in sera of tumor-bearing mice has predictive value for survival and tumor regression.\r"

These results indicate that stimulation of human T cells via the CD2 Ag with the T11(2) and T11(3) mAb activates not only protein kinase C but also tyrosine kinase(s), resulting in the phosphorylation of the CD3 gamma-chain and the tyrosine phosphorylation of the zeta-chain, respectively.\r"

We have bacterially expressed a Sm-B'/B autoantigen from Raji cells as a fusion with the anthranilate synthase protein from Escherichia coli. The recombinant Sm-B'/B fusion displays comparable immunologic reactivity to the native protein when tested with both monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies. To map Sm-B'/B epitopes, we constructed a series of 12 anthranilate synthase fusions spanning different regions of Sm-B'/B and tested such fusions on immunoblots against a panel of characterized sera. In this manner, we have identified six epitopes, five of which overlap the proline-rich carboxyl-terminus of the protein. Some of these epitopes appear to be conformational. The human sera tested can be divided, according to the epitopes they recognize, into six groups. Finally, we have shown that anti-Sm recognition of the (U1)RNP-specific A protein is attributable to cross-reactivity between the Sm-B'/B and A autoantigens.\r"

  ".W": "Human decay-accelerating factor (DAF) proteins expressed on E and nucleated cells differ in their susceptibility to phosphatidylinositol (PI)-specific phospholipase C (PLC) cleavage/release. To investigate the mechanism of this difference, the glycoinositol-phospholipid anchoring moieties of E DAF, and of HeLa cell, polymorphonuclear cell, and lymphocyte DAF were structurally compared. Labeling of PI-PLC-resistant E DAF with 3-(trifluoromethyl)-3-(m-[125I]-iodophenyl)-diazirine ([125I]TID) and TLC analysis of nitrous acid deamination anchor fragments showed a predominant phospholipid species with less polar migration than the 125I-TID-labeled PI. Gas chromatographic analyses of methanolyzed E protein revealed 2.20 +/- 0.16 mol of fatty acids [16:0, 18:0, 18:1, 20:4, 22:4, and 22:5 (0.76, 0.36, 0.25, 0.15, 0.40, 0.28 mol, respectively)] and 0.86 +/- 0.05 mol of inositol per mol of N-terminal Asp. Gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy demonstrated principally myo-inositol but also variable amounts of the chiro-isomer. Nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of 14C-radiomethylated E protein revealed that pretreatment with hydroxylamine, a reagent which removes ester-linked lipids, rendered it PI-PLC susceptible. In contrast, parallel analyses of 35S-cys-labeled PI-PLC-sensitive HeLa DAF protein revealed only minor amounts of the hydroxylamine-sensitive phospholipid species. Similar results were obtained with 125I-surface-labeled DAF from polymorphonuclear cells, as well as from unstimulated peripheral blood and anti-CD3-activated lymphocytes. These findings demonstrate that, rather than PI, the E DAF anchor contains an inositol alkylacylglycerol-phospholipid which is heterogeneous with respect to acyl groups and inositol isomers, that an ester-linked substitution in this inositolphospholipid underlies the resistance of E DAF protein to PI-PLC cleavage/release, and that this structural modification is cell-specific.\r"

Holoricin conjugates possess efficacy, but display high nonspecific toxicity. A chain conjugates, which appear specific, lack high potency. In developing the diphtheria toxin-based conjugate, we found high potency for target anti-TNP hybridoma cells and for spleen cells isolated from TNP-immunized mice. The similar intoxication of nontarget cells required concentrations approximately three orders of magnitude higher. Additionally, it was found that the TNP-specific agent may have selectively depleted B cells producing high affinity IgG anti-TNP antibodies.\r"

Video intensification microscopy showed that receptors for FL-C5a were homogeneously distributed on the surface of the PMN, but within minutes were mobilized into patches and internalized by the PMN. Internalization of C5a receptors was confirmed in studies in which external FL-C5a fluorescence was quenched by reducing the pH. A similar rapid internalization was observed with FL-FMLPL. This process was inhibited for both fluorescent ligands by monensin. Reexpression of C5a and formyl peptide receptors after internalization occurred with both receptors. By comparison, the rate of reexpression of formyl peptide receptors was much faster than that observed with C5a receptors with the half maximal reexpression time for each being 5 to 10 min and 18 to 60 min, respectively. C5a receptor reexpression was completely blocked by monensin suggesting receptor recycling, whereas monensin had little effect on FMLPL receptor reexpression. The reexpression of both receptors occurred in the presence of cycloheximide indicating that this process occurred independent of protein synthesis. Additional studies on formyl peptide receptor showed that when PMN were treated with ionomycin to fully mobilize the intracellular pool of FMLPL receptors, receptor reexpression failed to occur. These studies show that both C5a and formyl peptide receptors are internalized after binding ligand, but that their reexpression occurs through different mechanisms. C5a receptors appear to be recycled to the cell surface whereas formyl peptide receptors are reexpressed predominantly by translocation from an intracellular pool.\r"

We now describe the isolation and characterization of a T cell clone (9.1-2) that also transfers protective immunity against Leishmania. After Ag or mitogen stimulation, this clone secrets IL-2 and IFN-gamma, but not IL-4 or IL-5. The clone preferentially recognizes L. major fraction 9, and in addition, soluble Ag from Leishmania donovani, Leishmania amazonensis, and Leishmania braziliensis, but not from the related flagellates, Trypanosoma cruzi or Crithidia fasciculata. Besides being contained in fraction 9, the stimulatory Ag is also released from the parasite, because concentrated promastigote culture supernatants induced IFN-gamma production by 9.1-2. By means of T cell immunoblotting, we determined that 9.1-2 recognized a protein with a relative m.w. between 8,000 and 12,000, and within this region is a predominant protein contained in fraction 9 of approximately 10,000 m.w.

The predicted protein sequence of human LSP1 is compared with the predicted mouse LSP1 protein sequence and regions of homology are identified in order to predict structural features of the LSP1 protein that might be important for its function. Both the human and mouse LSP1 proteins consist of two domains, an N-terminal acidic domain and a C-terminal basic domain. The C-terminal domains of the mouse and human LSP1 proteins are highly conserved and include several conserved, putative serine/threonine phosphorylation sites. Immunoprecipitation of LSP1 protein from 32P-orthophosphate-loaded cells show that both the mouse and human LSP1 proteins are phosphoproteins. The sequences of the putative Ca2(+)-binding sites present in the N-terminal domain of the mouse LSP1 protein are not conserved in the human LSP1 protein; however, a different Ca2(+)-binding site may exist in the human protein, indicating a functional conservation rather than a strict sequence conservation of the two proteins. The expression of the human LSP1 gene follows the same pattern as the expression of the mouse LSP1 gene. Southern analysis of human genomic DNA shows multiple LSP1-related fragments of varying intensity in contrast to the simple pattern found after similar analysis of mouse genomic DNA. By using different parts of the human LSP1 cDNA as a probe, we show that most of these multiple bands contain sequences homologous to the conserved C-terminal region of the LSP1 cDNA. This suggests that there are several LSP1-related genes present in the human genome.\r"

Eight of the T cell clones expressed a TCR composed of a unique alpha- and beta-chain amino acid sequence, and concordantly, each of these T cell clones exhibited a unique Ag specificity. This was true for several clones which differed only in TCR V-J junctional regions. Interestingly, for a given clone, the response to some of the peptide analogs depended to a large extent on the allelic form of the presenting MHC molecule. A simple interpretation of these data would suggest that certain positions of the peptide Ag are most important for Ag-MHC molecule interactions, and that these specific interactions can influence the antigenic epitope recognized by the TCR. We suggest that an antigenic peptide binds to an MHC glycoprotein in a distinct way, but may retain a measure of flexibility.\r"

In addition, enhanced TNF production was detected in supernatants of monocyte cultures activated by Jurkat cells. Not only viable tumor cells but also metabolically inactivated tumor cells, cytoblasts, and membrane preparations from Jurkat and K562 cells induced TNF-mRNA expression.

Lymphocyte activation by Ag or mitogen, CTL- and NK-mediated cytolysis, homing to lymphoid-associated tissue, and the attachment of lymphocytes to extracellular matrix proteins are all governed, at least in part, by cell surface adhesion receptors. During the analysis of mAb for the ability to block human cytotoxic T lymphocyte-mediated killing an inhibitory mAb was noted that caused rapid and vigorous aggregation among the CTL. This antibody, mAb L25, also induced aggregation among human T and B tumor cell lines. mAb L25 binds to an epitope on the alpha 4 subunit of the integrin protein VLA-4 and induced an adhesion event requiring divalent cations, energy, a fluid plasma membrane, and an intact cytoskeleton. The Ag-independent homotypic adhesion induced by mAb L25 was not inhibited by mAb to the lymphocyte function associated Ag-1 (CD11a/CD18), CD2, CD4, and CD8, or to their ligands ICAM-1, LFA-3, MHC class I, or MHC class II.

  ".W": "Ag-specific as well as Ia-restricted killing of certain APC by CD4+ T cells was investigated. The CD4-mediated killing is not only a characteristic of in vitro long term cultured T cell lines or clones, but is also manifest after in vivo priming. Thus, CD4+ killer T cells are generated in vivo as well. CD4+ killer T cells are detected in the Th1, but not in the Th2 subset, and they do not appear to lyse Ia+ APC or bystander cells by a pathway mediated by secreted T cell factors. The latter observation is demonstrated by cold target inhibition experiments as well as by the failure of puromycin to inhibit killing, if applied in doses which completely block lymphokine secretion. Ia+ APC differ in their susceptibility to lysis. Transformed APC are usually better lysed than nontransformed APC. Unstimulated B cells are not killed, while LPS-stimulated B cell blasts are killed. The results of cold target inhibition and bystander killing experiments suggest that CD4+ killer T cells are activated by the common pathway, i.e., by Ag presented in the context of Ia, but killing requires the recognition of additional determinant(s) on APC. It is proposed that these killing-inducing determinants are continuously expressed on most transformed Ia+ cells and on nontransformed but stimulated APC.\r"

  ".W": "The relationship between NK cell and T cell progenitors was investigated by using mice with severe combined immune deficiency (scid). Scid mice are devoid of mature T and B cells because they cannot rearrange their Ig and TCR genes. However, they have normal splenic NK cells. Thymus of scid mice, although markedly hypocellular, contains cells that lyse YAC-1, an NK-sensitive tumor cell. By flow cytometry, two populations of cells were identified in the scid thymus. Eighty percent of the cells were Thy-1+, IL-2R(7D4)+, J11d+, CD3-, CD4-, CD8- whereas the remaining were IL-2R-, J11d-, CD3-, CD4-, and CD8-. By cell sorting, all NK activity was found in the latter population, which is phenotypically similar to splenic NK cells. To determine if the thymus contains a bipotential NK/T progenitor cell, J11d+, IL-2R+ cells were cultured and analyzed for the generation of NK cells in vitro. These cells were used because they resemble 15-day fetal and adult CD4- CD8- thymocytes that are capable of giving rise to mature T cells. Cultured J11d+ thymocytes acquired non-MHC-restricted cytotoxicity, but in contrast to mature NK cells, the resulting cells contained mRNA for the gamma, delta, and epsilon-chains of CD3. This suggests that J11d+ cells are early T cells that can acquire the ability to kill in a non-MHC-restricted manner, but which do not give rise to NK cells in vitro. The differentiative potential of scid thymocytes was also tested in vivo. Unlike bone marrow cells, scid thymocytes containing 80% J11d+ cells failed to give rise to NK cells when transferred into irradiated recipients. Together these results suggest that mature NK cells reside in the thymus of scid mice but are not derived from a common NK/T progenitor.\r"

As shown previously, TP67.14 could be induced to generate a significant amount of anti-TNP antibodies when treated with TNP-conjugated protein such as TNP-BSA and TNP-keyhole limpet hemocyanin without T cell help as well as LPS. Our study was undertaken to investigate direct involvement of surface MHC class II molecules on B cells during B cell maturation by analysis with this Ag-specific B cell clone. The data demonstrate that mAb against IAk and IEk molecules, but not IAd and H-2k, markedly inhibited the differentiative effects of LPS on TP67.14. In contrast, both antibodies specifically augmented the secretion of anti-TNP antibodies by TP67.14 treated with TNP-BSA, although these antibodies alone failed to induce the generation of anti-TNP antibodies. Interestingly, TP67.14 significantly differentiated into anti-TNP antibody secreting cells when incubated with TNP-conjugated monoclonal anti-IAk or anti-IEk antibodies alone; this differentiative effect was much greater than that of TNP-conjugated anti-IAd mAb or purified mouse IgG under the same conditions. Our result suggests that surface IA/E molecules on B cells may be directly involved in a transductional signal for B cell maturation mediated by the cross-linkage of receptor molecules on B cells with Ag.\r"

As expected from the known mechanism of action of this drug, it also blocked the accumulation of IL-2 during the MLR. Addition of human rIL-2 did not overcome the inhibition of CTL generation, even when it was added daily to keep its level similar to that produced in a normal MLR. Daily addition was necessary, because the CsA-inhibited MLR consumed IL-2, either by utilization or degradation. The outcome of a 5-day MLR in the presence of CsA (CsA-MLR) depended on whether or not IL-2 was continuously present. In the presence of IL-2, there was no generation of CTL activity, probably because such cultures contained IL-2-dependent suppressive elements described previously. However, when day 5 CsA-MLR cells generated in the absence of IL-2 were washed and recultured with human rIL-2, there was a burst of CTL activity, with a more than 50-fold increase in alloantigen-specific cytotoxicity within 24 to 48 h. This increase is not explainable simply by the proliferation of existing effector CTL. The noncytotoxic cells produced in an MLR in the presence of CsA, and which can be rapidly activated to cytotoxic effector cells by IL-2, are termed \"precursor-effector CTL\" (peCTL). They could be detected by day 3 of a primary CsA-MLR culture. Their conversion to effector CTL by IL-2 was not inhibited by CsA. Exposure of peCTL to IL-4 also generated CTL activity, to a somewhat lesser degree than IL-2, but the IL-4-induced activation was inhibited by CsA, suggesting that it depended on the induction of another CsA-sensitive lymphokine. The intracellular levels of mRNA encoding the CTL-specific serine esterases CCP1 and CCP2 (granzymes B and C, respectively) increased rapidly during the IL-2-driven conversion of peCTL to effector CTL. This study demonstrates that in the presence of CsA precursors for CTL can accumulate, and that these can be rapidly converted to cytotoxic effector cells by IL-2.\r"

  ".W": "Although engagement of the TCR via antibody can be sufficient to trigger T cells, responses to Ag-bearing cells require additional \"accessory\" interactions in many cases. A method has been developed which allows preparation of surfaces bearing both purified class I alloantigen and coimmobilized antibodies. With this approach, it is possible to mimic such \"accessory\" interactions and to examine their quantitative effects on triggering via TCR-Ag interaction. Experiments are described which use this approach to examine triggering of degranulation by cloned, allogeneic CTL lines. Coimmobilization of antibodies specific for any of a variety of CTL surface proteins, including CD8, class I MHC proteins, CD45 (T200) and Thy-1, had the effect of decreasing the critical threshold density of Ag necessary to trigger responses, and decreasing by an order of magnitude the density required to stimulate a half-maximal response. Furthermore, in comparison with the 30-min lag seen with Ag alone, response was initiated immediately when an antibody specific for a CTL surface component was present. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that any CTL surface molecule having sufficient affinity for a component of the target surface can contribute to activation via the Ag-specific TCR; and at low Ag density could determine whether any response occurs.\r"

A small fraction of normal peripheral blood T cells, preferentially CD4+, was also reactive with 10D1 mAb. Biochemical studies revealed that 10D1 mAb recognizes a disulfide-linked homodimeric molecule composed of 90-kDa polypeptide. 10D1 mAb induced a substantial proliferation of peripheral blood T cells when cross-linked with goat anti-mouse Ig antibody. The elimination of CD4+ cells totally abrogated the proliferative response induced by 10D1 mAb, whereas the elimination of CD8+ cells rather enhanced it. The proliferative response of peripheral blood T cells induced by 10D1 mAb was almost completely inhibited after modulation of the CD3/TCR complex with anti-CD3 mAb. In addition, a prompt increase in intracellular [Ca2+] was observed in a CD3+ T cell line, Jurkat but not in its surface CD3- mutant when 10D1 mAb was added. These results indicate that the 10D1 molecule is involved in a novel pathway of human CD4+ T cell activation, which is associated with the CD3/TCR-mediated pathway.\r"

We report that thymic DC express LFA-3 and ICAM-1 adhesion molecules and may spontaneously associate with autologous thymocytes within mitogen-independent clusters. Moreover, the accessory activity of isolated human thymic DC was investigated in Con A-stimulation assays. By proliferation experiments, measured as [3H]TdR incorporation, we demonstrated that irradiated thymic DC strongly increase the mitogen-induced activation of autologous PBL as well as of unfractionated thymocytes. More interestingly, in coculture assays performed with purified thymocyte subsets, we have found that thymic DC greatly enhance the Con A proliferation of CD1- CD3bright thymocytes whereas the accessory activity toward the CD1+ CD3- thymocytes was very weak. Inhibition experiments demonstrated that the DC accessory activity is inhibited by anti-DR-related and anti-IL-2R mAb. However, blocking assays with anti-CD11b, anti-CD11c, anti-LFA-3, and anti-ICAM1 mAb showed that the accessory function obtained is similar to that with untreated cultures. We conclude that isolated human thymic DC may present potent DR- and IL-2-dependent accessory activity mainly directed toward the CD1- CD3bright thymocyte subpopulation, suggesting that thymic DC may be involved in the in vivo proliferation of mature thymocytes.\r"

  ".W": "Neonatally induced tolerance of class II MHC alloantigens in mice of the A/J strain background is achieved without evident clonal deletion, because lymphoid cells from tolerant animals proliferate in mixed lymphocyte reactions against tolerogen-bearing stimulators. However, the pattern of lymphokines produced in bulk cultures by these tolerogen-reactive cells is unusual in that, unlike lymphocytes from nontolerant normal mice, lymphocytes from tolerant mice produce measurable amounts of IL-4 when stimulated with tolerogen. Using limit dilution analysis, we have determined that the ability to detect IL-4 in bulk cultures is caused by a high frequency of precursors of Ag-specific IL-4 secreting (pIL-4) cells among tolerant, but not normal, responder lymphocytes. Moreover, after repeated in vitro exposure to class II alloantigens, and after in vivo grafting with class II-disparate skin, the frequency of pIL-4 cells rises among lymphocytes from normal mice, eventually reaching levels similar to those found in class II tolerant mice. Because in normal mice a high frequency of class II-reactive pIL-4 cells reflects the \"primed\" state, we conclude that a subset of T cells that resemble Th2 cells is similarly primed in neonatally tolerized mice. We propose that this priming is achieved by the neonatal inoculation of semiallogeneic bone marrow cells. Because no expansion in the clone size of tolerogen-specific precursors of Ag-specific IL-2-secreting T cells (pIL-2) is observed among tolerant animals, and because the pIL-2 cells from tolerant mice are incapable of differentiating into cytotoxic and delayed hypersensitivity effector cells, we further propose that the precociously primed pIL-4 cells function as \"suppressor\" cells, helping to maintain the tolerant state.\r"

  ".U": "90111136\r", 
  ".W": "The ability of Th cells, type 1 (TH1), to activate and induce differentiation of B cells into antibody-secreting cells is controversial because 1) some clones of TH1 cells provide help while others do not, and 2) by using the same TH1 clone, different laboratories disagree on whether they provide help to B cells. One possible explanation for the latter is the variability in the activation status of the B cells used in different laboratories. In the present studies, we have used Ag-specific B cells from athymic (nu/nu) mice, or sterilely housed nu/+ mice to study the TH1-mediated activation of B cells that had received little or no prior help from T cells and/or antigen in vivo. These B cells express low levels of surface Ia (sIa) Ag, and fail to secrete IgG2a in response to TH1 cells plus Ag; in contrast, responses to TH2 cells plus Ag are normal. To explore this observation further, we prepared \"surface(s) Ia1o\" B cells from conventionally housed BALB/c mice by sorting spleen cells on the fluorescence-activated cell sorter. This sIalo population also failed to produce IgG2a in response to TH1 cells plus Ag. In contrast, the sIahi, (presumably more mature) B cells, responded to both the TH1 and TH2 cells. The addition of LPS, TH2 cells or the lymphokine, IL-4, to cultures of sIalo B cells from normal or nu/nu mice (plus Ag and TH1 cells), restored IgG2a responses to control levels. Low sIa levels were not the sole cause of nonresponsiveness of the nu/nu B cells because a 24-h pulse with IL-4 restored sIa to control levels without restoring IgG2a production after activation with TH1 cells plus Ag. These data support the conclusion that sIalo B cells are immature and require an activation/maturation signal from IL-4 in vivo in order to respond to TH1 cells and Ag in vitro.\r"

We had selected two typical mAb pairs, D66 + T11(1) and GT2 + T11(1), the former delivering the \"richest\" signal, the latter the poorest. Here we analyzed the cytolytic activities generated within PBL-stimulated by these two pairs. When purified CD2+,3- cells were cultured with either one of these two pairs, no significant lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) activity--namely the activity exerted on NK-resistant malignant cell lines or fresh tumor cells--was detected, thereby demonstrating the inability of CD2 mAb pairs to directly trigger the LAK precursors. By contrast, when purified CD2+,3+ cells were cultured, only D66 + T11(1) was able to trigger a potent CTL activity, as judged by targeting their activity, at the effector phase, with a bridging CD3 mAb on a FcR+ target cell or by using heteroaggregates on FcR- malignant cells. When whole PBL were used, a similar and moderate LAK activity was generated after culture with either one of the 2 CD2 mAb pairs. This, in fact, masked quite different events. The amounts of endogeneous IL-2 released in PBL cultures with GT2 + T11(1) was rather low, although it was sufficiently high in PBL cultures with D66 + T11(1) to generate a potent LAK activity. Yet, PBL stimulated with D66 + T11(1) released concomitantly a high amount of IL-4 which inhibited the development of the LAK activity, as demonstrated by unmasking this activity with an anti-IL4 antiserum and which did not inhibit the T CTL activity; this IL-4 secretion was not seen with GT2 + T11(1). Therefore, stimulation by these two typical CD2 mAb pairs induce a striking different pattern of IL synthesis.\r"

Mice tolerized with splenocytes coupled with MSCH (a complex mixture of neuroantigens) or with purified PLP, but not purified myelin basic protein, were resistant to the development of clinical and histologic R-EAE. In addition, mice rendered tolerant to an encephalitogenic peptide of PLP were significantly protected, whereas mice tolerized to a nonencephalitogenic peptide of PLP were highly susceptible, to the induction of MSCH-induced R-EAE. Thus, immune responses directed against encephalitogenic regions of PLP appear to play a major role in the development of R-EAE induced by MSCH in SJL/J mice. These results also indicate that determinant-specific immune tolerance is a feasible approach to the regulation of a disease that involves autoimmune responses to a variety of Ag.\r"

We have utilized Ia- and Igh-congenic strains to study the immunoregulation of autoantibody-producing B cells in this model. We have found that the autoantibodies are produced almost entirely by the host B cells. The transferred donor B cells contributed neither to the autoimmune response nor to the total serum Ig, with rare exceptions. The donor cell population did, however, exert an Igh allotype-specific immunoregulatory effect on the host B cells. For example, in allotype-heterozygous recipients, the autoantibodies were preferentially made by those host cells that expressed the donor allotype, whereas those host B cells that expressed nondonor allotype were relatively suppressed. In allotype-homozygous recipients, the donor cells frequently suppressed the host IgG2a allotype completely. This suppression sometimes prevented the IgG antichromatin response, although in other cases the response occurred with the use of a different isotype. In a final set of experiments, a chronic GVH reaction was induced in which both the donors and the recipients were Igh allotype heterozygous and yet differed at Ia. In this case, no donor influence on allotype should be expected; yet the IgG2a autoantibodies were clearly skewed toward the b allotype. These results show that host B cells play a unique role in the GVH autoimmune syndrome. In addition, they are immunoregulated in allotype-specific manners, some of which presumably involve interaction with donor T cells.\r"

Purified peripheral blood T cells were stimulated to proliferate in a short-term assay by IL-7 in the presence of CD3 mAb or lectin. This stimulation was accompanied by a significant increase in the expression of IL-2R on both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells over that seen with mitogen alone. The proliferation of these cells in the presence of exogenous IL-7 involved both IL-2-dependent and - independent mechanisms as shown by the ability of neutralizing IL-2 antibody to partially inhibit the response. Anti-IL-4 and anti-IL-6 antibodies had no effect on IL-7-induced T cell growth. These results suggest that the costimulatory effect of IL-7 on human T cells is primarily direct, not involving other intermediate T cell growth factors. IL-7 was also found to be mitogenic in a long-term assay in the absence of any costimulus, with the onset of proliferation occurring later than that seen in the presence of mitogen. These results demonstrate that IL-7 provides a potent T cell stimulus either alone or in the presence of co-mitogen and, although this stimulus is accompanied by an increase in the level of IL-2R expression, it is not dependent on the action of IL-2 for its effect.\r"

Although there is a progression of sIgA- cells to sIgA+ cells and then to IgA-secreting cells, there is not a parallel change in ratio of membrane to secreted form of alpha-mRNA. In fact, the secreted form of alpha-mRNA is always the predominant form even before the expression of sIgA. However, at least some of the secreted alpha-mRNA transcripts are sterile. The increase in sIgA expression and the induction of sterile transcripts indicate that TGF-beta enhances H chain class switching to IgA as opposed to allowing the growth and maturation of cells precommitted to IgA secretion. The addition of IL-2 to cultures with TGF-beta results in a 5- to 10-fold increase in IgA secretion compared to cultures to which only TGF-beta was added. In these cultures IL-2 increases neither the proportion nor the total number of sIgA+ cells suggesting that IL-2 acts to increase IgA secretion. However, IL-2 does not cause a change in the ratio of secreted to membrane form of alpha-mRNA nor does it lead to an increase in the steady state level of alpha-mRNA comparable to the increase in secreted IgA. Thus, it appears that regulation of transcription of IgA as sIgA- cells proliferate and undergo H class switching and maturation does not follow the same sequence as is seen when sIgM+ cells proliferate and mature to Ig-secreting cells. Furthermore, the data suggest that maturation to high level secretion is controlled posttranscriptionally.\r"

Interaction of IL-1 with its receptor leads to the translocation of protein kinase C (PKC) from the cytosol to the membrane, phosphorylation of the 80-kDa protein that is substrate for PKC, as well as an increase in the level of cAMP. In addition, IL-1 induced IL-5 mRNA expression in these cells. We have established that the IL-5 gene is activated in D10.A cells in response to either phorbol esters or 8-Br cAMP, and that the two agents act as cofactors. IL-1 is able to synergize with phorbol esters and is additive with 8-Br cAMP for IL-5 mRNA expression. There are two possibilities to explain these results: 1) D10.A cells express two types of functional IL-1R, each linked to an independent signal transduction pathway; or 2) these cells have only one kind of IL-1R which, upon ligand interaction, mediates the activation of both the PKC and the adenylate cyclase pathway.\r"

This impairment was significant as early as Walter Reed (WR) stage 2; at WR stage 4-5, the production was almost zero. At WR stage 2 of infection, IFN-alpha mRNA was exclusively found in association with polyribosomes, indicating that IFN-alpha gene was transcriptionally inactive under the experimental conditions used. A similar decrease of the level of transcripts as a function of the progression of the disease was also observed for the IFN-gamma mRNA. In contrast, TNF-alpha production was strongly enhanced in PBMC from HIV-1-infected individuals after stimulation with LPS compared to the TNF-alpha production of activated PBMC from healthy donors. Almost parallel with the increase of the level of the transcript for TNF-alpha, the level of TNF-beta increases as well. Data are presented which show that the increased TNF-alpha production is due to a longer half-life of TNF-alpha transcripts in PBMC from infected individuals. These results let us suggest that the up-regulation of TNF-alpha gene expression in PBMC from HIV-infected individuals is controlled predominantly on the posttranscriptional level, whereas transcriptional events regulate the level of IFN-alpha transcripts. This assumption is supported by run-on experiments which revealed that the extent of transcription of TNF-alpha gene is almost identical in nuclei from stimulated PBMC of noninfected and HIV-infected donors, whereas the transcription of IFN-alpha gene is strongly suppressed in nuclei from HIV-infected individuals at WR stages 3 and 6.\r"

The three aromatic amino acids, phenylalanine, tryptophan, and tyrosine, the charged hydrophilic amino acids, aspartic acid and lysine, and the neutral amino acid alanine were found to occur most often in the determinant region of the peptides tested, whereas asparagine, cysteine, and histidine occurred the least often. Alanine substitution analogs provided more information than omission analogs by enabling the determination of which side chain groups of the antigenic determinant residues were not critical for binding to the mAb. Detailed, \"fingerprint\" information about the interaction of the peptide, GASPYPNLSNQQT, and its mAb was obtained by synthesizing a complete series of analogs with individual substitutions for each position of the antigenic determinant, PYPNLS, with the 19 other amino acids. These results suggest that, at the amino acid level, all antigenic determinants of synthetic peptides defined by mAb can be considered discontinuous linear determinants.\r"

  ".W": "The molecules of the MHC are highly polymorphic and involve in Ag presentation; their striking genetic polymorphism allows probable interactions with a large variety of antigenic fragments when these are presented to the TCR. It is therefore of interest to explore the extent of this polymorphism and the mechanisms of its generation. We have studied the class II HLA-DR blank allele DR-BON that has been previously defined by MLR, restriction fragment length polymorphism, and two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. A cDNA library was constructed from a DR-BON homozygous typing cell and cDNA corresponding to DR alpha- and DR beta-chains were sequenced. By comparison with other known alpha- and beta-chain sequences it is shown that the alpha-chain is invariant and the beta-chain differs from DR1 by only six nucleotides, clustered in the third variable region with three amino acid changes at position 67, 70, and 71. The short DNA stretch of sequence encoding the 67-71 region is also present in other DR alleles: DR4/Dw10, DRw13, and some DRw11 specificities. Therefore we propose that a gene conversion-like event has occurred between the DRB1 *0101 (DR1/Dw1) gene and one of these three DRB1 genes. Extensive typing has been performed with a DR-BON-specific 17-mer oligonucleotide. Cross-hybridization with other genes than the ones expected from DNA sequence comparison was not observed. A selected panel of DR-BON reactive T cell clones shows three patterns of reactivity. Some clones are strictly DR-BON specific; some cross-reacted with DRw13 and a few cross-reacted with other haplotypes. The role of different epitopes of the third variable region of HLA-DR beta chain in allo-reaction is discussed.\r"

To examine endocytosis of HLA-DR, we radiolabeled B lymphoblastoid cells, warmed the cells to allow internalization of membrane proteins, and then subjected viable cells to neuraminidase (NANAse)3 digestion. DR complexes were precipitated and analyzed by two-dimensional PAGE for shifts in isoelectric point signifying sensitivity to or protection from NANAse treatment. DR molecules were completely sensitive to the enzyme with or without specific antibody in the medium during the 37 degrees C incubation, suggesting that no detectable endocytosis had occurred. Control transferrin receptors, which readily internalize, showed marked protection. Assay sensitivity was measured by proportionate mixing of mock and NANAse-treated lysates; precipitated sialylated molecules were detectable at the 10% level. Monensin treatment to block recycling also failed to reveal any internally accumulated. NANAse-protected DR molecules. Measurements of turnover for surface-labeled DR complexes revealed a t 1/2 of approximately 36 h. We conclude that no large endocytically-derived pool of HLA-DR molecules exists within cells and suggest that the majority of mature DR molecules do not actively undergo internalization but reside at the cell surface after synthesis/transport for significantly long periods of time.\r"

  ".W": "A single application of a water-miscible cream base containing the recently identified mitosis inhibitory epidermal pentapeptide pyroGlu-Glu-Asp-Ser-GlyOH (EPP) to hairless mouse skin is followed by a long-lasting period of reduced epidermal cell proliferation. To examine if a similar growth inhibition could be achieved in stimulated and rapidly proliferating epidermis, EPP was applied at two different concentrations, 0.005 or 0.02%, to hairless mouse skin immediately after exposure of the left flank to an erythemic dose of ultraviolet B light (UVB). This dose of UVB alone induces a sustained period of rapid epidermal cell proliferation, starting at about 18 h after the irradiation. Epidermal cell proliferation was followed from 18 to 54 h (0.005% cream) or from 18 to 30 h (0.02% cream) after the treatment by estimating the rate of G2-M cell flux (the mitotic rate) by means of Colcemid, and epidermal DNA synthesis by counting labeled cells after pulse-labeling with 3H-thymidine. The unirradiated side of the mice was used as reference. The results showed that topical treatment with a 0.02% EPP cream partially inhibited UVB-induced epidermal hyperproliferation, while the 0.005% EPP cream inhibited as well as stimulated the UVB-induced hyperproliferation. Thus, EPP is effective even in rapidly proliferating epidermal cell populations, but the outcome is obviously dose-dependent in this test system.\r"

Preconfluent and confluent cultures established on 3T3 feeders were steady state labeled with [35S]-sulfate and [3H]-glucosamine after removal of the 3T3 cells. Products in nonionic detergent extracts of keratinocytes and in the medium were analyzed in the presence of protease inhibitors. Glycosaminoglycans as proteoglycans and as free chains were defined by susceptibility or resistance, respectively, to alkaline borohydride reduction. Products associated with the cells were approximately 30% proteoglycans and approximately 70% glycosaminoglycan free chains, whereas in the medium virtually all was proteoglycan. The heparan and chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans were small compared to those of many other cell types. Their Kav on Sepharose CL-4B was 0.56 (estimated 50 kDa), whereas the free chain Kav was 0.74 (estimated 12 kDa). Relative amounts of the sulfated products varied with confluence and differentiation; heparan and chondroitin sulfates were equally represented within the free chains and proteoglycans of the cells in preconfluent, proliferating cultures, whereas in postconfluent, differentiated cultures the major labeling was in the heparan sulfate products, consistent with our prior reports (J Invest Dermatol 88:215-9, 1987 and 91:492-8, 1988). The cellular localization of the products was probed with glycosaminoglycan degrading enzymes added to isotopically prelabeled cultures. The proteoglycans appeared to be located on the external surface of plasma membranes, whereas the glycosaminoglycan free chains resisted digestion and are either intracellular or membrane associated, but otherwise inaccessible. These data establish the distinctive pattern of low Mr proteoglycans and abundant cell-associated glycosaminoglycan free chains synthesized by keratinocytes.\r"

The specific activity of total MAO in the intact skin was 108.0 +/- 15.9 pmol/min/mg protein, and consisted of about 92% of type A activity and 8% of type B. The activity of total MAO was about 10 times greater than that of NAT. Total MAO activity increased to 130%-150% of control levels at 2 h after initiation of the reaction and approximated the control level at 3 to 6 h. Subsequently, the activity decreased linearly to 50% at 12 h and to 20% at 24 h. Although the time-dependent changes of MAO type A activity were similar to those of total MAO activity, MAO type B activity increased to 42% at 30 min, remained at 30%-40% until 6 h, and then decreased to 20% at 12 h and to 5% at 24 h. NAT activity in the reaction sites decreased with time to 50% of the control at 30 min and to 35% at 4 h and was stationary until 24 h. The serotonin concentration decreased linearly with time to 16% of the control level at 1 h, increased sharply to 240% at 6 h, and remained at more than 200% until 24 h. This biphasic change in serotonin concentration seems to be related to the dynamic changes in the activities of serotonin-degrading enzymes. In addition, the accumulation of platelets in the reaction sites may increase serotonin concentration and MAO activity subsequent to 1 h after the initiation.\r"

We have observed that in serum and growth factor free medium (basal medium), epidermal growth factor (EGF) and transforming growth factor alpha (TGF alpha) stimulated DNA synthesis in mouse epidermal keratinocyte cultures (mKC) in a time- and dose-dependent manner. Incubation with all-trans retinoic acid (RA) greatly enhanced the stimulatory effect of EGF. Transforming growth factor beta (TGF beta) inhibited the EGF-induced DNA synthesis in a dose-dependent manner, and the inhibition was greatly enhanced by a low dose of RA. Treatment of growth-factor deprived human keratinocyte cultures (hKC) with RA before incubation in basal medium containing EGF or a mixture of EGF, bovine pituitary extract (BPE), and insulin caused a dose-related increase in DNA synthesis and cell growth (cell number), respectively. A low concentration of RA also enhanced the inhibitory effect of TGF beta on growth-factor-induced DNA synthesis and cell growth in hKC. These findings suggest that the differential effects of retinoids on epidermal keratinocyte proliferation are in part due to an enhancement of the response of keratinocytes to positive and negative peptide growth factors.\r"

  ".W": "Keratinocytes from three different layers of epidermis (stratum basale, stratum spinosum, and stratum granulosum/corneum) were shown by high-performance liquid chromatography to contain retinol, 3,4-didehydroretinol and several fatty acyl esters thereof. The concentration of unesterified congeners increased 1.8-2.8 times from the inner to the outer layers of epidermis, while the corresponding increase in fatty acyl esters was 4.0-6.5 times. Together the esters represented 71% of the total vitamin A content in stratum granulosum/corneum as compared to 54% in stratum basale. The in situ synthesis of fatty acyl esters of retinol and 3,4-didehydroretinol (vitamin A2) was studied by addition of [3H]retinol to organ-cultured human breast skin. The radioactive compounds appearing in the epidermis after 48 h were, in order of abundance, retinyl esters, retinol, 3,4-didehydroretinyl esters, and 3,4-didehydroretinol. Studies at the subcellular level demonstrated the highest esterifying activity in the microsomal fraction. The enzyme catalyzing the reaction, acyl CoA:retinol acyltransferase (ARAT; EC 2.3.1.76), had a pH optimum of 5.5-6.0, which differs from that of ARAT in other tissues. ARAT activities in microsomes from different layers of epidermis were similar, but, owing to a presumed pH gradient in upper epidermis, the in vivo esterification of vitamin A may be enhanced in terminally differentiating keratinocytes. The mean ARAT activities in basal cell carcinomas and squamous cell carcinomas were less than 50% of the control values, and the relative amounts of retinyl esters were significantly lower than normal. We suggest that the esterification of vitamin A may also be of importance in relation to pathologic keratinocyte differentiation.\r"

  ".W": "In various cell culture systems, extracellular matrix components have been demonstrated to be mitogenic and, in some cases, to substitute for growth factors. In order to study the effects of various matrices on keratinocyte growth, we assessed the incorporation of tritiated thymidine and cell number on short-term cultures of human keratinocytes plated on different substrata. For determination of whether thymidine incorporation by keratinocytes was related to the ability of the cells to attach and spread on the substratum, experiments to determine the percentage of attached and spread cells on each matrix surface were performed. High levels of attachment and incorporation of thymidine with no preferential attachment to a given matrix were evident when the cells were cultured in the presence of growth factors. When growth factors were absent, keratinocytes likewise showed no preferential attachment to a given matrix component, but demonstrated enhanced thymidine incorporation when apposed to type IV collagen or fibronectin in comparison with tissue culture plastic or laminin. In the absence of epidermal growth factor (EGF) and bovine pituitary extract (BPE), increased spreading on type IV collagen and fibronectin was associated with enhanced incorporation of thymidine. In agreement with the thymidine incorporation results, when keratinocytes were cultured for 7 d, cell numbers were increased in cultures plated on type IV collagen only if growth factors were excluded from the medium. When attachment of cells to substrata with or without growth factors was compared, either EGF or BPE enhanced attachment to all of the substrata tested. It is concluded that under suboptimal growth conditions extracellular matrix components can modulate keratinocyte growth. Also, under these conditions, spreading, but not attachment, correlates with growth potential.\r"

At a concentration of 0.1 or 1 mM/l 8-MOP and UVA doses of 5-30 J/cm2, PUVA failed to induce any detectable C3-cleavage in NHS. Furthermore, when the complement (C) activation in NHS had been induced before or after PUVA treatment by various methods. PUVA did not modulate the extent of C3-cleavage. PUVA did not affect the viability of isolated PMN, nor did it induce a release of LDH or elastase. No differences between C3-deficient and C-competent guinea pig skin exposed to PUVA were observed in erythema or histologic responses. Immunohistologic examination of specimens from normal guinea pigs revealed C3b and C3d deposits on necrotic keratinocytes, findings restricted to the PUVA-treated areas. Necrosis of keratinocytes was present in skin specimens of C3-deficient animals from PUVA-treated sites to a similar extent. However, deposits of C3-related antigens were completely absent there. From these observations, we suggest that the induction of phototoxic erythema following PUVA treatment is independent of complement.\r"

The monolayer was incubated with 50 nM of [1,2-3H]-testosterone. Steroids were extracted from the medium and analyzed by thin layer chromatography. The major metabolite in the beard dermal papilla cells was dihydrotestosterone (DHT), the most potent androgen in the androgen target tissue. By contrast, the amount of DHT formed was similar to that of androstenedione in reticular dermal fibroblasts. The 5 alpha-reductase activity in beard dermal papilla cells was three to five times as high as that in the reticular dermal fibroblasts from the same skin sample. The apparant Michaelis constant of 5 alpha-reductase in the beard dermal papilla cells was 1.0 X 10(-6) M, which was virtually equivalent to that of genital skin fibroblasts, typical androgen target cells. It was 4.0 X 10(-5) M in reticular dermal fibroblasts. By contrast, the activities of 5 alpha-reductase in dermal papilla cells from occipital scalp hair follicles were similar to those of reticular dermal fibroblasts of the same skin samples. These results strongly suggest that the beard dermal papilla cell is an androgen target cell, and that DHT plays a role in the growth of beards in men.\r"

Densitometric analysis revealed 1.5- to 2.5-fold elevations of c-myc transcript levels in lesional psoriatic relative to normal epidermis. Similar increases in cyclophilin and lipocortin II transcripts were also observed and may reflect characteristic differences in RNA preparations from normal and psoriatic epidermis. C-myc, c-jun, c-erbB, c-fos, and c-Ha-ras transcript levels were not significantly increased in lesional psoriatic epidermis when protooncogene mRNA levels were normalized to those of the cyclophilin or lipocortin genes. In contrast, transforming growth factor-alpha (TGF-alpha) transcripts were significantly increased (10- to 20-fold) with or without prior normalization. C-myc, c-fos, and c-jun transcripts were significantly induced over in vivo levels 2-4 h after organ culture of normal or psoriatic keratome biopsies, demonstrating that these genes can be highly expressed in the context of tissue injury.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the spectrum of immune responses affected following i.v. injection of supernatants obtained from cultures of epidermal cells exposed in vitro to UV radiation. Treatment of primary epidermal cell cultures or transformed keratinocytes (Pam 212 cells) with UVB (280-320 nm) radiation caused the release of factors that suppressed the induction of delayed hypersensitivity to alloantigen and trinitrophenyl-modified self-antigens in syngeneic and allogeneic mice. Contrary to expectations, however, the injection of supernatants from UVB-irradiated epidermal cells had no effect on the induction of contact hypersensitivity to trinitrochlorobenzene. On the other hand, treatment of the keratinocytes with UVA radiation (320-400 nm, filtered to remove wavelengths in the UVB region) resulted in the release of a factor that suppressed contact but not delayed hypersensitivity. Neither the UVA-induced nor the UVB-induced suppressive factor inhibited the generation of an antibody response to sheep erythrocytes, indicating that, like the suppression that occurs after in vivo exposure to UV radiation, the suppression induced by factors from UV-irradiated keratinocytes is selective in nature. These data support the hypothesis that soluble keratinocyte-derived suppressive factors are involved in the induction of systemic immune suppression by UV radiation. In addition, they suggest that multiple suppressive factors, having different immunosuppressive properties, are produced by different wavelengths of UV radiation.\r"

  ".W": "Modulation of ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) gene expression by retinoids was analyzed in human keratinocyte cultures maintained in serum-free medium containing 0.15 mM Ca++. Cells were incubated with all-trans-retinoic acid, 13-cis-retinoic acid or arotinoid Ro15-0778 (10(-10) to 10(-5) M), total RNA was isolated, and mRNA transcripts for ODC were analyzed by Northern and slot blot hybridizations with a human ODC cDNA. Treatment of cells for 24 h resulted in a dose-dependent decrease in ODC mRNA levels, with an estimated IC50 of approximately 1 X 10(-8) M for all-trans- and 13-cis-retinoic acid, while Ro15-0778 was somewhat less effective (IC50 approximately 1-5 X 10(-7) M). The suppression of ODC mRNA levels by retinoids was detectable at approximately 3 h of incubation, with essentially a maximal inhibition at 12 h. Reduced ODC mRNA levels noted after 24 h of incubation with 5 X 10(-7) M all-trans-retinoic acid were accompanied by a reduction in ODC enzyme activity. To determine if all-trans-retinoic acid was regulating ODC gene expression directly, or if protein synthesis was required, ODC expression was analyzed in cultures treated with protein synthesis inhibitors. In the presence of cycloheximide or puromycin, all-trans-retinoic acid did not suppress ODC mRNA levels. These findings suggest that suppression of ODC gene expression is not a direct effect of all-trans-retinoic acid, but depends on ongoing protein synthesis.\r"

In the murine skin, TCR gamma delta+ cells have been reported to form the great majority of epidermal T lymphocytes. We have examined the relative contribution of TCR alpha beta+ and TCR gamma delta+ cells to the T-cell population in normal human skin. Serial sections of freshly frozen skin specimens were acetone fixed, incubated with anti-CD3, beta F1 (anti-TCR alpha beta), anti-TCR gamma delta-1 and anti-TCR delta 1 (anti-TCR gamma delta) monoclonal antibodies (MoAb), and stained with a highly sensitive method. Over 90% of the T cells of normal human skin are localized around the postcapillary venules of the dermis, while less than 5% are present within the epidermis. In papillary dermis, TCR gamma delta+ cells formed on average 7% (anti-TCR gamma delta-1) or 9% (anti-TCR delta 1) of the total number of CD3+ cells, while TCR alpha beta+ cells constituted up to 80%. In epidermis, these percentages were 18% and 29% for TCR gamma delta+ cells, and up to 60% for TCR alpha beta+ cells. It is concluded that there is no preferential immigration or in situ expansion of TCR gamma delta+ T cells in normal human skin, because the relative percentages found for the TCR alpha beta+ and TCR gamma delta+ populations in skin are comparable to those found in lymphoid organs and peripheral blood. However, the percentage of TCR gamma delta+ cells in epidermis seemed on average higher than in papillary dermis. Therefore, there may still be a difference in migration patterns of TCR gamma delta+ v TCR alpha beta+ cells, but this does not result in their preferential localization in human epidermis. The hypothesis that TCR gamma delta+ T cells have a specialized function in immunosurveillance of epithelia may thus not be valid for human epidermis.\r"

  ".W": "Keratinocytes are a rich source of IL-1, a cytokine which stimulates prostaglandin synthesis in many cell types. The effects on arachidonic acid metabolism of this cytokine were therefore studied in cultured adult human keratinocytes. Exogenous IL-1 increased basal cellular prostaglandin synthesis (particularly PGE2) threefold. Increased PGE2 synthesis in response to IL-1 was inhibited by cycloheximide, suggesting a requirement for new protein synthesis. Irradiation of the keratinocytes with low-dose ultraviolet light B (UVB) resulted in the release of increased quantities of both IL-1 and PGE2. The amount of IL-1 released was sufficient to increase PGE2 synthesis when exogenously added to unstimulated cells, suggesting a causal relationship. The time course of accumulation of IL-1 and PGE2 in the medium of irradiated keratinocytes was also consistent with a cause-effect relationship. No feedback inhibition of IL-1 release by the increased PGE2 was detected as demonstrated by the observation that IL-1 production in response to UVB was not augmented by treatment with indomethacin or blunted by the exogenous addition of PGE2. These data suggest that keratinocyte IL-1 may be partially responsible for induction of keratinocyte PGE2 synthesis after UVB irradiation.\r"

The proliferation of Thy 1+ splenic T cells was significantly decreased, and prolonged retention of the response to T-cell mitogen was found in treated mice. Treatment with unmodified cells induced a partial inhibition of disease features which did not prolong survival rates. These results suggest that phototherapy potentiates a normal immunoregulatory process which enables suppression of the development of abnormal cell populations in young MRL/l mice with relatively intact immune systems.\r"

Measurements performed either with whole cell suspensions or Percoll-separated cell subpopulations, indicate a similar membrane microviscosity (eta = 3.37 poise +/- 10%) compared to those microviscosities reported for other cell types. Our findings show that treatment of guinea pig keratinocytes with liposomes composed of phospholipids results in a decreased membrane microviscosity (1.95 poise), whereas treatment of the cells with an emulsion of cholesterol hemisuccinate, or liposomes composed of cerebrosides, causes an increase in membrane microviscosity (3.85 poise and 5.55 poise +/- 10%, respectively). Changes in membrane fluidity had no significant effect on cell viability. A reduced membrane microviscosity resulted in a decrease in the binding of Concanavalin A to keratinocytes, whereas an increased microviscosity resulted in an increased binding of Concanavalin A. Furthermore, endocytosis of Concanavalin A bound to keratinocytes plasma membranes was not significantly affected by a reduced membrane microviscosity, whereas an increased membrane microviscosity completely blocked the endocytosis of Concanavalin A. Another novel observation was that membranes \"fluidified\" by phospholipid liposomes could be \"rigidified\" by treatment with cholesterol hemisuccinate and vice versa. Moreover, these alternate changes in membrane microviscosity resulted in simultaneous alternate changes in the binding of Concanavalin A to the keratinocyte surface.\r"

  ".U": "90111237\r", 
  ".W": "Skin biopsies and scale samples from nine infants and one fetus affected with harlequin ichthyosis (HI) were obtained from eight families. Epidermal differentiation was examined by morphologic and biochemical criteria and cell culture studies. Two striking abnormalities were identified; first, keratin and filaggrin expression were abnormal and varied between cases, and, second, in all cases lamellar granules were absent or abnormal, and intercellular lamellae within the stratum corneum were absent. Three HI phenotypes were distinguished by variable expression of epidermal structural proteins. Cases were classified by the absence (type 1) or presence (types 2 and 3) of keratins K6 and K16 (\"hyperproliferative\" keratins) and by the presence of profilaggrin in the interfollicular epidermis (types 1 and 2 only). Profilaggrin is apparently not converted to filaggrin, but it is retained in the scale. The block in profilaggrin processing may be due to an inactive phosphatase. Siblings in two families (presenting with types 1 and 2) showed the same type classification suggesting that expression of the phenotype is consistent within families but differs between families. Cultured HI keratinocytes were normal by phase microscopy, but abnormal by electron microscopy with no lamellar granules and extensive stacking of the upper layers. We conclude that harlequin ichthyosis is a genetically heterogeneous group of disorders with altered lamellar granules, intercellular lipids, and variation in expression and/or processing of structural protein markers of normal epidermal keratinization. Furthermore, the lamellar granule and structural protein defects may be indirectly related via a mechanism involving phosphorylation/dephosphorylation.\r"

  ".W": "Autoantibodies to the non-histone nucleoprotein antigens SS-A/Ro, SS-B/La, and RNP are highly associated with photosensitive cutaneous lupus erythematosus (LE). In order to better understand the potential mechanisms of ultraviolet (UV) light on photosensitivity in patients with cutaneous LE, we designed immunopathologic in vitro and in vivo experiments to evaluate the effects of UV on the binding of such autoantibodies to the surface of human keratinocytes, one major target of immunologic damage in photosensitive LE. Short-term 2% paraformaldehyde fixation of suspensions of cultured human keratinocytes previously incubated with monospecific antiserum probes enabled the detection of ENA expression on the cell surface by flow-cytometry analysis. UVB light (280-320 nm) induced the binding of monospecific antibody probes for SS-A/Ro and SS-B/La on keratinocytes in a dose-dependent pattern with maximal induction observed at the dose of 200 mJ/cm2 UVB. Binding of SS-A/Ro, SS-B/La, and RNP antibody was augmented strongly, but binding of anti-Sm was very weak. In contrast, UVA (320-400 nm) light had no effect on the induction of binding of these antibody probes. Identical results were seen by standard immunofluorescence techniques. Hydroxyurea-treated keratinocytes showed similar induction of those antigens by UVB irradiation, which suggested that ENA expression on cultured keratinocytes by UVB were cell-cycle independent. Tunicamycin, an inhibitor of glycosylation of proteins, reduced UVB light effect on the SS-A/Ro and SS-B/La antigen's expression. These in vitro FACS analyses revealed that ENA augmentation on the keratinocyte cell surface was dose dependent, UVB dependent, glycosylation dependent, and cell-cycle independent. In vivo ENA augmentation on the keratinocyte surface was examined in suction blister epidermal roofs. Specific antibody probes for SS-A/Ro, SS-B/La, RNP, and Sm bound to human keratinocytes in intact suction blister epidermis following UVL irradiation in vivo. Using three different protocols, we have demonstrated that antibodies to SS-A/Ro, SS-B/La, and U1RNP bind to UVL-irradiated human keratinocytes. We speculate that this antibody binding is an important inducer of antibody dependent keratinocyte damage in photosensitive cutaneous lupus.\r"

  ".W": "Induction of microsomal aryl hydrocarbon hydroxylase and cytochrome P-450 was observed in epidermal cells obtained from the skin of newborn rats exposed to benz(a)anthracene by topical exposure and in submerged cultures exposed to the procarcinogen in vitro. The level of aryl hydrocarbon hydroxylase activity was increased 2.5-fold in vivo and six- to sevenfold in vitro when the measurements were made on the entire epidermis or the entire culture, respectively. However, separate measurement on germinative (basal) and on differentiated cells revealed that AHH was sevenfold higher in differentiated cells as compared with basal cells in the skin of both unexposed animals and animals exposed in vivo. Similar results were obtained in cultured cells exposed in vitro. Immunocytochemical staining of sections of skin from animals exposed to benz(a)anthracene in vivo with a monoclonal antibody generated against cytochrome P-450c showed a higher binding of the antibody in lower spinous cells than in basal cells in the epidermis. Although more stained cells were observed in exposed cultures than in untreated cultures, the antibody, which inhibits at least 85% of the hydroxylase activity in the skin, inhibited only 6%-16% of the activity in culture. These observations support the interpretations that a) differentiated keratinocytes have a higher capacity in the metabolic activation of PAH than do germinative cells, although both types of cell are susceptible to induction of cytochrome P-450 by exposure to BA, and b) the cytochrome P-450 induced by exposure of epidermis to benz(a)anthracene in vivo exhibits some differences from the one induced upon exposure of keratinocytes to this procarcinogen in vitro.\r"

  ".W": "There is evidence for defective DNA repair in xeroderma pigmentosum, Cockayne's syndrome, and trichothiodystrophy, but for increased cancer risk only in xeroderma pigmentosum. Natural and adaptive immune surveillance and mutant frequency to 6-thioguanine resistance in circulating T-lymphocytes were studied in five patients with xeroderma pigmentosum, two with Cockayne's syndrome, and one with trichothiodystrophy. Forty-eight-hour cutaneous hypersensitivity responses to recall antigens excluded anergy and circulating CD3+, CD4+, CD8+, and CD16+ cell numbers were within normal limits in all patients tested, as were proliferative lymphocyte responses to PHA, except in the trichothiodystrophy patient. Proliferative responses to recall antigens (PPD, SKSD, and Candida) showed that all patients responded to one or more antigens. Direct natural killer cytotoxicity measured against the human erythromyeloid leukaemia cell line K562 using a 4-h 51Cr release assay was significantly reduced in xeroderma pigmentosum (specific cytotoxicity less than mean +/- SD greater than 17.4 +/- 9.4 per cent, with effector:target cell ratio of 50:1) compared to normal controls (45.8 +/- 17.8), but normal in Cockayne's syndrome and trichothiodystrophy. Generation of lymphokine activated killer cell activity was normal in the two xeroderma pigmentosum lines tested. The mutant frequency in the xeroderma pigmentosum donors was significantly increased (p less than 0.01) and was elevated in the two Cockayne's syndrome donors, taking age into account. No mutants were observed from the single trichothiodystrophy donor. These findings suggest that reduced natural killer cell activity may contribute to the greatly increased susceptibility to skin cancer in xeroderma pigmentosum.\r"

With an initial virus inoculum of 10(3)-10(4) TCID50/ml, rCD4 completely prevented acute HIV infection of U937 cells at concentrations greater than or equal to 1 microgram/ml and provided substantial but incomplete protection at 0.1 microgram/ml. With an initial virus inoculum of 10(2) TCID50/ml, rCD4 completely prevented acute infection of PAM at concentrations greater than or equal to 0.1 microgram/ml. The transmission of HIV-1 infection to PMNL cocultured with chronically infected PAM was completely inhibited at concentrations greater than or equal to 1 microgram/ml if cell-to-cell contact was prevented. With direct PAM-PMNL contact, substantial inhibition was obtained at an rCD4 concentration of 10 micrograms/ml, and higher concentrations (200 micrograms/ml) could completely block transfer. These results demonstrated that rCD4 can be effective in preventing de novo infection of cells of the monocyte/macrophage lineage, but microenvironments where cell-to-cell contact predominates are likely to pose a formidable challenge to this therapeutic strategy.\r"

Increases in kinins correlated with increased vascular permeability, as monitored by increased concentrations of albumin in lavages. In contrast, histamine levels in nasal lavages were not increased during symptomatic infections, suggesting that mast cell and basophil activation does not occur during rhinovirus colds. These data confirm and extend observations made during experimentally induced rhinovirus infections to the natural disease and are consistent with the hypothesis that kinins may play a role in the pathogenesis of symptomatic rhinovirus infections.\r"

  ".W": "As a first step toward identifying the evolutionary origin of a pathogenic clone of Haemophilus influenzae biogroup aegyptius causing Brazilian purpuric fever, chromosomal variation and genetic relationships were indexed among 17 isolates of biogroup aegyptius and 2209 previously characterized encapsulated H. influenzae strains recovered from 30 countries on six continents. Biogroup aegyptius isolates form three distinct evolutionary lineages of the species H. influenzae and isolates of the case clone are genetically not closely related to other isolates classified as biogroup aegyptius. The Brazilian purpuric fever case clone was found to be genetically allied with H. influenzae isolates producing serotype c polysaccharide capsule. The population genetic evidence suggests that biogroup aegyptius isolates may represent cell lineages occasionally transmitted from nonhuman hosts or spawned from a much larger base population consisting of genetically diverse nonpathogenic precursor clones.\r"

Hydatid cyst fluid isolated from sheep infected with Echinococcus granulosus contains a glycoprotein (P1gp) with a terminal alpha-D-Galp-(1----4)-D-Galp disaccharide. Preparations of P1gp were shown to interact directly with Shiga toxin and to inhibit the binding and cytotoxicity of Shiga toxin to HeLa cells. A sandwich ELISA was developed using preparations of P1gp as the toxin capture molecule, which, with an appropriate polyclonal antibody, was capable of detecting as little as 80 pg/well Shiga toxin and 132 pg/well SLT-II. Thus, the P1gp-toxin interaction forms the basis for a simple antigen-capture ELISA that may be useful clinically for the rapid detection and quantitation of Shiga and Shiga-like toxins.\r"

  ".W": "The prevalence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis B virus in serial unselected hospital admissions was determined to examine the potential efficacy of a system of universal blood and body fluid precautions versus a system based on selected or unselected screening. Serum was obtained from 616 (97%) of the 636 patients admitted during a 1-month period and interviews were completed on 540. Of the 616, 23 (3.7%) were confirmed positive for HIV, and 12 (2.0%) of 612 for hepatitis B surface antigen. Of 33 infected persons, only 8 were known to be positive on admission and only 22 were in \"high-risk\" groups; therefore, selective precautions would not have been effective. Mandatory testing would have required 1216 tests to identify 25 infected persons and would leave in doubt the presence of other transmissible diseases. On the basis of these data, it appears that universal precautions are a logical system of infection control.\r"

All 12 with high (greater than or equal to 1:200) but only 19 of 30 with low (less than 1:100) prechallenge titers experienced illness or a fourfold increase in titer after the first challenge (P less than .025). Only 4 of those challenged twice became ill; all had low initial titers but 3 had high titers before the second challenge. None became ill after a third challenge. Nine (47%) had high titers immediately before the third challenge; 3 had low titers before and after each challenge and remained asymptomatic. Thus, preexisting serum antibody to Norwalk virus does not seem to be associated with protective immunity, but antibody levels become associated with protection after repetitive exposure. Short-term resistance lasts greater than or equal to 6 months after challenge, and a small percentage of resistant individuals maintain low antibody titers even after multiple challenges.\r"

Most volunteers inoculated with 10(6.6)-10(7.6) TCID50 of CRB 87 were infected, but a high frequency of serum antibody responses was seen only at the highest dose (17/29; 59%). The dose of CRB 87 necessary to infect 50% of all human volunteers (1 HID50) was approximately 10(5.4) TCID50. All volunteers given 10(3.9)-10(7.1) TCID50 of the wild-type virus were infected (i.e., 1 HID50 was less than 10(3.9) TCID50). The frequency of mild febrile reactions, mean peak titer of virus in respiratory secretions, and duration of virus shedding were significantly greater in volunteers given 10(7.1) TCID50 of wild-type virus than in those given 10(7.6) TCID50 of CRB 87. Thirteen volunteers were rechallenged with a second 10(7.6) TCID50 dose of CRB 87 3-4 months after vaccination. The frequencies of mild upper respiratory symptoms and signs, virus shedding, and infection were significantly reduced in prior vaccinees compared with volunteers inoculated with a similar dose for the first time. These data suggest that CRB 87 is attenuated, immunogenic, and can confer protection against homotypic virus challenge in this susceptible population.\r"

To this end an infectious human adenovirus type 5 recombinant virus that contains the rabies glycoprotein gene, and which may serve as the prototype for a new class of vaccines against rabies, was constructed and tested. This recombinant, when administered by either the parenteral or oronasal route, was highly effective in eliciting good levels of rabies-neutralizing antibodies in the sera of dogs and mice. Mice immunized by the recombinant virus were protected from lethal intracerebral challenge with rabies virus.\r"

After crude slime was isolated from selected strains of S. epidermidis, phenol and chloroform were used to remove proteins and lipids. The remaining extract contained a polysaccharide that was seen on SDS gels stained with Stains-all. This extract was an inhibitor of the antimicrobial action of vancomycin, raising the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) to vancomycin in all 18 isolates of S. epidermidis. A dose-response curve was seen between the amount of extract added and the degree of resistance, as measured by both MIC and growth curves. A similar effect was noted with MICs of organisms to teicoplanin. Addition of the extract did not change the MIC to LY146032, although a modest effect on growth rate was observed. The extract did not raise the MIC to clindamycin, rifampin, and cefazolin. The extract reversed the synergism seen between vancomycin and gentamicin in the 5 strains tested in time-kill studies. The interference by slime of the antimicrobial effect of vancomycin and teicoplanin may explain why these antibiotics are sometimes ineffective in eradicating foreign body infections due to slime-producing coagulase-negative staphylococci.\r"

Coagulase-negative staphylococcal skin flora of 28 neutropenic patients receiving ciprofloxacin prophylaxis and therapy for gram-negative bacterial infections were compared with those of 31 untreated patients and 33 hospital personnel working in the same unit. In ciprofloxacin-treated patients the flora were almost completely ciprofloxacin-resistant, whereas in the control groups resistant flora were detected only occasionally. Similarities in the plasmid profile patterns were found in 91% of the ciprofloxacin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci, suggesting an epidemiologic relation between these strains.

Results suggested that vancomycin and teicoplanin were ineffective at a concentration of 8 micrograms/ml and growth was seen between 24 and 48 h. Conversely, the lipopeptide antibiotic daptomycin at the same concentration rapidly killed tested strains by 6 h. Various staphylococcal strains were examined to determine if vancomycin resistance could be selected in all strains of staphylococci, was specie(s) restricted, or was unique to this patient's clinical isolates. About 1 x 10(8) colony-forming units were added to melted brain-heart infusion agar plates containing 12 micrograms/ml of vancomycin. Plates were examined after 48 h for presence of resistant clones. Results indicated that selection for vancomycin resistance was restricted to S. haemolyticus strains. Further, all S. haemolyticus isolates that displayed a double zone of growth around imipenem agar diffusion discs (Impdz) contained stably resistant subpopulations. Vancomycin resistance could not be selected in imipenem-sensitive derivative clones. Impdz isolates that were recovered from geographically distinct locations displayed nearly identical SDS-PAGE protein profiles. It appears that a characteristic susceptibility pattern displayed by clinical isolates of S. haemolyticus may provide a marker for those strains that contain subpopulations having increased resistance to vancomycin.\r"

By use of this assay S. typhi flagellar antigen was detected in 95.5% of serum samples from patients with positive hemoculture for S. typhi, in 93.6% of samples from patients with positive serodiagnosis of typhoid fever, in 26% of samples collected from patients who were initially hemoculture-positive for S. typhi and who had undergone 7-8 d of chemotherapy, in 8.5% of samples from healthy persons from an endemic area, and in no samples from healthy persons from a nonendemic area. The presence of high levels of flagellin antibody titers did not interfere with the antigen detection. The detection of S. typhi flagellar antigen in patient serum may have practical value for rapid diagnosis of typhoid fever.\r"

Each developed hepatitis 22-33 days after inoculation. Virus in feces, serum, and liver was quantified by radioimmunofocus assay. Viremia developed 7-11 days after inoculation, in parallel with fecal shedding of virus, and persisted for a mean of 20.5 days. Although the antigenic variant was recovered from feces or liver of three animals, virus in liver at the time of enzyme elevations was predominantly wild-type antigenic phenotype. Virus was not recovered from liver 96 days after challenge. These studies further define virologic events in hepatitis A and show that in vivo replication of an antigenic variant was restricted compared with that of wild-type virus.\r"

In two cases CSD bacilli were demonstrated for the first time in splenic granulomas in a child and in an adult with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)-related complex. In both cases, there was granulomatous hepatitis as well as splenitis. In the third case, the CSD bacillus was present in hepatic granulomas in an adult with granulomatous hepatitis. In all cases, granulomatous inflammation with suppuration in the viscera was identical to that previously described for lymph nodes in CSD. All patients eventually recovered completely. Clinical awareness of the broad spectrum of CSD should avoid the cost and morbidity of prolonged hospitalization, medications, and invasive surgery for a disease that is self-limited and not clearly responsive to antibiotics and that can usually be diagnosed by noninvasive means.\r"

Plasma IL-1 alpha levels were low (40 pg/ml) or undetectable in all situations. In 67% of the healthy subjects, plasma IL-1 beta levels were less than 70 pg/ml. Septic patients had higher plasma IL-1 beta levels (120 +/- 17 pg/ml, P = .001); those of surviving patients were higher than those of patients who died (P = .05). Plasma TNF-alpha concentrations in septic individuals were elevated (119 +/- 30 pg/ml) and correlated with severity of illness (r = .73, P = .003), but no correlation was observed between plasma IL-1 beta and TNF-alpha concentrations in individual samples. Infusion of endotoxin caused a twofold elevation of IL-1 beta, from a baseline of 35 +/- 5 pg/ml to a maximum of 69 +/- 27 pg/ml at 180 min (P less than .05). Peak TNF-alpha levels after endotoxin infusion were 15 times higher than IL-1 beta levels, were attained more rapidly (90 min), and as with the septic patients, did not correlate with IL-1 beta levels. These data support the concept that plasma IL-1 beta and TNF-alpha concentrations are regulated independently and are associated with different clinical outcomes.\r"

Four of the five patients had arteriovenous graft infections, and two died during antimicrobial therapy. Case-patients were more likely than control-patients to have received high-flux dialysis during the 6 mo before their infection (100% vs. 30%, P = .009). MCA was cultured from the hose connected to a water spray device used for manual reprocessing of high-flux but not regular dialyzers. Renalin was the germicide used to manually disinfect dialyzers for reuse and was prepared at a concentration of 2.5%. Laboratory studies documented survival of MCA from two high-flux dialyzers that were reprocessed in a manner similar to that used in the clinic. Early diagnosis with complete rather than partial graft removal in combination with antimicrobial therapy is recommended for MCA graft infections. In addition, 2.5% Renalin did not appear to ensure complete killing of MCA in high-flux dialyzers that were manually reprocessed at this hemodialysis clinic.\r"

The immune response was assessed by an assay of [3H]thymidine uptake by lymphocytes proliferating in response to stimulation with Blastomyces alkali- and water-soluble antigen (B-ASWS) or blastomycin and by skin testing with blastomycin. At 3 months, 36 (84%) of 43 patients demonstrated a proliferative response to B-ASWS (mean value of experimental [E]-control [C] counts, 16,852 +/- 2664, and of E/C, 42.2 +/- 5.3). None of the patients demonstrated a proliferative response to blastomycin, and only 19 (41%) of 45 patients tested had a positive blastomycin skin test. By 21 months, 47 (98%) of the 48 patients demonstrated a proliferative response to B-ASWS on at least one testing date. Of those initially positive, 82% had a persistently positive proliferative response at 21 months; mean E-C and E/C values were comparable to those seen at 3 months. None of the 47 uninfected persons demonstrated a proliferative response to B-ASWS: 7 with positive histoplasmin skin tests had a mean E-C value of 1094 +/- 432, and the 40 others, a mean value of 1139 +/- 212. A proliferative response to B-ASWS in exposed individuals is a reliable marker of specific cellular immunity in blastomycosis and the response persists in most patients for up to at least 2 years.\r"

The mean annual incidence of cholesteatoma during this period was 1.32 cases per 10,000 of population. The results indicate that there has been neither a rise nor a fall in the incidence of cholesteatoma in Tayside despite a considerable increase in the use of ventilation tubes.\r"

This retrospective analysis of 65 patients undergoing aural polypectomy was carried out to identify any predictive factors for underlying cholesteatoma and to determine a correct management strategy for aural polyps. The duration of symptoms, size of polyp, size of conductive component of hearing loss and bacteriology of otorrhoea were unhelpful as predictors of the underlying disease. Radiological evidence of bony erosion of the mastoid is a useful sign of cholesteatoma when present. Aural polypectomy resulted in 58.3 per cent of ears becoming inactive. It is proposed that aural polypectomy and histological assessment should be employed as initial treatment with mastoid exploration reserved for those ears thus identified as high risk for cholesteatoma.\r"

Mastoid ache was not related to tumour size, hydrocephalus, or duration of symptoms. However, there was a significantly higher incidence of facial numbness and diminished facial sensation, but not facial weakness, compared with the whole series. Since motor fibres are more resistant to pressure than sensory fibres, mastoid ache may signify the pressure of an expanding cerebellopontine angle tumour.\r"
