This article examines several systems factors that contribute to hate and conflict in the rehabilitation setting. It is argued that the growth and rapid expansion of rehabilitative services, the incorporation of rehabilitation enterprises along with new career opportunities, and quests for power potentially contribute to the enhancement of hate. Ultimately, this hate can interfere with the quality of care and outcomes in rehabilitation if it is not recognized and addressed.\r"

All disabled subjects were regarded by their referring rehabilitation therapists as potential candidates for driver assessment. Data were analyzed to identify which measures were useful in differentiating among the groups and predicting driving performance. Results indicated that psychometric measures can be useful in predicting driving performance among disabled drivers. Nearly all the measures in the battery were significant predictors of driving ability, and some were highly predictive. The best was the oral version of the Symbol Digit Modalities test, which by itself accounted for 70% of the variance of the full-sized-vehicle driving score. Adding a second variable into a two-step multiple regression further increased the correlation between predictors and driving, accounting for almost 80% of the variance in driving score. These findings support the feasibility of developing a simple test battery to determine which disabled candidates are ready for in-vehicle assessment, and which candidates are not ready without further evaluation of cognitive and performance skills.\r"

Tests were carried out to compare the responses of the two groups to single-leg-stance balance maneuvers. Results suggested that the \"fallers\" required greater support during single-leg stance. It was inferred that the fallers displaced their body mass more laterally during this procedure than was the case with the control group. Fallers applied greater forces to the frame with their eyes closed than with their eyes open; the control group did not show significant differences in this respect. These findings may help to define some of the biomechanical problems associated with idiopathic gait disorders.\r"

Balance during habitual and instructed-even standing, as well as locomotor performance, were measured before and after a three- to four-week treatment period. Two groups of 21 matched subjects participated in physical therapy. One group received standing balance training with a specially designed feedback device that provided dynamic visual information about relative weight distribution over the paretic and nonparetic limb. Subjects trained with the feedback device showed significantly better static standing symmetry than did subjects who did not receive augmented feedback, p less than .05. Although both groups improved significantly in gait velocity, cadence, stride length, and cycle time, p less than .01, the initially identified asymmetrical locomotor pattern appeared to be only minimally affected by the standing balance training. Results indicated that although standing balance and locomotor control mechanisms may be highly interrelated, a reduction in standing balance asymmetry does not necessarily lead to a concomitant reduction in the asymmetrical limb movement patterns associated with hemiparetic locomotion.\r"

Studies of the cardiovascular response during sexual intercourse are few, but those that exist consistently show that there are wide individual variations in heart rate, blood pressure, and oxygen consumption. Recent reports have also identified potentially dangerous arrhythmias during intercourse. Patients who reach 5 to 6 metabolic equivalents (METS) on stress-testing without ischemia or arrhythmias can in all likelihood resume their normal sexual activities without any risk. All other cases have to be considered individually according to the current physiologic knowledge.\r"

  ".W": "This study examined the effect of head rotation on the mechanics of swallowing in healthy subjects, as well as the effects of this postural change on the oropharyngeal swallow of five patients with lateral medullary syndrome (LMS). Videofluoroscopic studies of swallowing in the normal subjects revealed that head rotation to either side increased upper esophageal sphincter (UES) opening diameter by an average of 2mm without affecting the period of UES opening or the oropharyngeal transit time. Maximal rotation of the head to the right or left caused the bolus to lateralize away from the direction of rotation, and also caused a significant (18mmHg or 35%) fall in UES pressure. In the face forward position, the LMS patients exhibited barium residue in the pharynx and pyriform sinuses, as well as diminished UES opening diameter. The fraction of the bolus swallowed and the UES opening diameter increased significantly with the head turned toward the paretic side in the LMS patients. We conclude that head rotation can improve swallowing in patients with unilateral oropharyngeal dysphagia. Two potentially beneficial effects were observed: (1) functional exclusion of the relatively flaccid, weakened pharyngeal wall, and (2) reduced UES tone. Which of these mechanisms is operative probably depends on the dominant mechanisms of dysphagia. In individuals with substantial impairment of UES opening, head turning reduces the resistance of the sphincter that must be overcome by pharyngeal contraction. In individuals with a flaccid hemipharynx, which dissipates pharyngeal pressure, head rotation excludes these structures from the bolus path and allows pharyngeal pressure to be directed at the UES.\r"

To facilitate this investigation, data from an experimental control group (n = 14), using bilateral variable resistance exercise equipment which enables both concentric and eccentric muscle contractions, and a nonexercise control group (n = 17) were incorporated into the study design. Through a random selection process, subjects were assigned to one of three groups that participated in this 10-week study. Analysis, including univariate and multivariate statistical techniques, revealed no significant changes in strength between the two experimental groups. However, compared with the nonexercise group, there were significant increases in strength in the experimental exercise groups; yet, these increases were significant in both groups only on the right legs. In addition, the development of transient knee pain in two subjects engaged in both concentric and eccentric exercise training required their removal from the study. This finding, in concert with previous experimental evidence of an association between eccentric exercise and the development of transient pain, must be integrated into future studies. Results suggest that further investigation is necessary to reveal the neurologic or biomechanical factors which may result in unequal training stimuli to the limbs with bilateral strength training on various types of equipment.\r"

Hospital records of all patients seen in a comprehensive wound-healing clinic from August 1984 through January 1986 were reviewed. Twenty-four patients with 27 lower extremity ulcers were identified. An aggressive clinical wound care protocol, including arterial revascularization, control of infection, wound debridement, protective orthotics, and use of topically applied autologous Platelet-Derived Wound Healing Formula, was used to heal these chronic ulcers. With follow-up time ranging from 12 to 22 months, complete wound healing was obtained in 18 of 24 patients (75%), and limb salvage was obtained in 20 of 24 patients (83%). Of the 24 patients, 18 (75%) achieved wound healing and a functional limb; 16 of the 18 (67%) were ambulatory, and two (8%) had a functional limb for transfers, but were not ambulatory due to preexisting stroke. We conclude that an aggressive, comprehensive amputation intervention program can prevent the emotional, functional, and economic costs of limb loss in most high-risk patients.\r"

A 38-year-old man with FA underwent graded exercise testing with collection of expired gases on a bicycle ergometer before and after training, to determine maximum work capacity and oxygen consumption. Training consisted of 27 electrocardiographically monitored exercise sessions on the ergometer, each for 20 to 25 minutes at a workload adjusted to achieve an exercising heart rate equal to 70% to 85% of his pretest maximum, preceded and followed by a stretching routine. Large increases in cardiorespiratory and work measures demonstrated clinically important physiologic adaptations to aerobic conditioning in this patient. Peak VO2 increased 27% and peak ventilation increased 21%. Total exercise time increased five minutes, reflecting a 50-watt increase in maximum workload. In addition, the patient experienced a 4.75-kg weight loss. A medically supervised endurance training program can increase aerobic work capacity and promote weight loss in patients with FA who can pedal a bicycle at training level intensities.\r"

Negative estrogen receptors also predicted bad prognosis. Both irradiation and surgery used alone had high local failure rates of 83% and 62%, respectively, but combination radiation-surgery treatment failed only in 25%. Combination radiation-surgery treatment should be considered in patients with local recurrence, but further prospective trials with more patients will be needed to prove its effectiveness.

Receptor content of the primary tumor and a pathologically confirmed positive node were measured simultaneously using a dual-isotope, dextran-coated, charcoal-binding assay. A receptor content of greater than or equal to 10 fmol/mg of cytosol protein was considered positive for both the estrogen-receptor and progesterone-receptor assays. Overall concordance between the primary tumors and the nodal metastases was 82% (31/38 patients) for the estrogen-receptor measurements and 84% (31/37 patients) for the progesterone-receptor measurements. Paired receptor levels were significantly correlated: r = .745 for the estrogen-receptor measurements and r = .805 for the progesterone-receptor measurements. Despite this correlation, 6 (25%) of 24 patients with an estrogen receptor-positive primary tumor had an estrogen receptor-negative nodal metastasis. Four (20%) of 20 patients with a progesterone receptor-positive primary tumor had a progesterone receptor-negative nodal metastasis. Six (24%) of 25 patients with tumors labeled as hormonally sensitive on the basis of the receptor content of the primary tumor had receptor-negative nodal disease. In reflecting the hormonal status of the more aggressive elements of the primary tumor, receptor levels of metastatic nodes may provide more useful information than the levels of the primary tumor as a guideline for further therapy.\r"

All patients were treated nonoperatively. At 1 to 12 weeks after the injury, 30 arterial injuries (24 major, 6 minor) were studied by repeated arteriography. Resolution, improvement, or stabilization of the injury occurred in 21 (87%) major artery injuries. Progression occurred in the remaining 3 injuries, including 1 patient who underwent subsequent successful repair. Twenty-one injuries were followed up without repeated arteriography. Delayed arterial thrombosis, hemorrhage, or ischemia did not develop, and no patient required operative management. Eight of 10 additional arterial injuries had successful percutaneous embolization at the time of repeated arteriography. The overwhelming majority of small arterial injuries or intimal fractures do not lead to vascular complications if managed nonoperatively. A routine policy of operative exploration for all such injuries is therefore unwarranted. These injuries are best managed by observation and serial arteriography to document spontaneous healing or progression.\r"

  ".W": "A 4-year experience with 249 consecutive carotid endarter-ectomies performed on 224 patients is reviewed for incidence of perioperative (30-day) myocardial infarction and early survival (mean follow-up, 21 months). Except in cases of unstable angina, coronary arterial disease was evaluated only by routine history, physical examination, and electrocardiogram. By these criteria, 73% of patients had evidence of coronary arterial disease. Patients underwent carotid endarterectomy after appropriate medical management and stabilization of coronary disease symptoms (angina and/or congestive heart failure). One (0.4%) fatal and nine (3.6%) nonfatal perioperative myocardial infarctions Early survival of patients with active symptoms of coronary disease who did not undergo coronary bypass was similar to those patients with preceding or subsequent coronary bypass. The results of this review suggest routine clinical evaluation for coronary arterial disease is sufficient in the large majority of cases prior to carotid endarterectomy. Considering the reported high mortality of coronary bypass among vascular surgical patients, it appears that an aggressive program screening for cardiac surgical candidates either by coronary arteriography or radionuclide studies prior to carotid endarterectomy is not warranted.\r"

  ".W": "To determine if the surgical treatment of peptic ulcer disease within a Veterans Administration hospital has changed over the past decade, we compared two groups of patients. Group 1 (n = 104) had surgery between 1974 and 1977 and group 2 (n = 61) had surgery between 1984 and 1987. In group 1, 49 (47%) ulcer operations were performed for chronic symptoms, while in group 2, 11 (18%) were performed for nonemergent reasons. The remaining 55 (53%) patients in group 1 and 50 (82%) in group 2 had operations for complications of peptic ulcer. When expressed per 1000 admissions, the rates of operations for complications were similar (1.08 vs 1.1). The relative proportions of perforation, bleeding, or obstruction were similar for patients in the two groups, as was the American Society of Anesthesiologist's Physical Status rating (3.1 vs 3.2). The fitness score, a scale for assessing preoperative risk with 10 representing the greatest risk, was also similar (6.7 vs 6.8). An American Society of Anesthesiologist's Physical Status value of greater than 3 and a fitness score of greater than 6 indicate that these patients were at high risk with an expected operative mortality of greater than 25%. In fact, the mortalities in groups 1 and 2 for patients having emergency operations for complications were 29% and 30%, respectively. The marked reduction in elective ulcer operations observed in our institution may be due to several factors, including better nonoperative therapy (eg, histamine receptor antagonists), physician preference for nonoperative treatment of chronic ulcers, or a reduced incidence of chronic ulcer within our population. However, the number of emergency operations for complications of ulcer has remained constant. These complications occur in poor-risk patients with concomitant illness, and the operative mortality for these patients is high.\r"

Of 182 patients in our study, retroperitoneal tumor was recognized preoperatively in only 39% of them. Sarcomas were most common (43% of patients), followed by lymphomas (23%), benign tumors (11%), undifferentiated malignant tumors (11%), carcinomas (8%), and germ cell tumors (4%). In 81 patients since 1960, the resection rate was 50%. Operative determinants of resectability were pathologic category and grade and extent of tumor. Resection included segments of the gastrointestinal tract (30% of the patients), kidney (25%), and pancreas, bladder, spleen, aorta, and vena cava (for each, 5% or less of the patients). The operative mortality was 6%. Tumor caused late death in 95% of the patients. Pathologic findings were a significant determinant of survival in the 81 patients. For sarcomas, 69% of the patients underwent resection, and the 1- and 5-year actuarial survival rates were 80% and 43%, respectively. Sixty percent of these patients underwent multiple operations. For lymphomas, most patients were treated with radiotherapy and chemotherapy; the 1- and 5-year survival rates were 67% and 35%, respectively. Benign tumors, almost all resected, yielded a 5-year survival rate of 100%. Undifferentiated tumors and carcinomas, most treated with radiotherapy and chemotherapy, had a 1-year survival rate of less than 33%. Other determinants of survival were age, weight loss, grade of tumor, and extent of tumor. Patients who underwent palliative resection had the same survival rate as patients who underwent biopsy alone.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

We describe 42 consecutive patients with EA-TEF treated during the past 8 years. Staged repair and preliminary gastrostomy were not routinely employed. Fifteen infants were considered to be at high risk (Waterston class C). Surgical treatment via an extrapleural approach consisted of fistula division and primary single-layer end-to-end esophageal anastomosis. Four patients required proximal esophageal circular myotomy. Four patients early in the series received a gastrostomy at or before definitive repair for various life-threatening indications. One patient had fistula division only and died before esophageal anastomosis was possible. Two neonates died before repair and another died after repair. The deaths in this series of patients were unrelated to EA-TEF. One patient developed a clinically significant anastomotic leak. Four patients required multiple dilatations for anastomotic stricture. Fundoplication was necessary in 3 patients with symptomatic gastroesophageal reflux. Our data demonstrate that excellent overall survival (90%) with low morbidity (15%) can be achieved using primary repair without preliminary gastrostomy in most neonates with EA-TEF. We believe that mortality in high-risk patients with EA-TEF is due to associated life-threatening anomalies.\r"

  ".W": "Postcardiotomy sternal infection occurred in 20 (2%) of 1007 patients undergoing cardiac surgery between September 1985 and December 1987, a 10-fold increase over the preceding 33 months (4 [0.24%] of 1627 patients). Cultures were sterile in 5 patients and yielded staphylococci in 12 and a variety of bowel organisms in 3. The cause for the increased occurrence of sternal wound infection is unclear after multivariate analysis, although infections have precipitously dropped subsequent to changing to cefuroxime sodium antibiotic prophylaxis. Treatment has evolved to appropriate antibiotics and early debridement of involved sternum and cartilage. Rewiring the sternum is not attempted. If gross purulence is not present, primary closure is accomplished using muscle flaps (2 patients) or omental pedicle grafts (17 patients). In the presence of gross purulence, the wound is packed open for 5 days and then closed in the above fashion. Two patients required skin grafts for primary closure. The omental pedicle flap is preferred due to simplicity and improved coverage of the sternal defect inferiorly. Nineteen patients healed primarily. A superficial wound infection was drained in 1 patient. Midline incisional hernias developed in 3 muscular patients. Omentum is now harvested through a left subcostal incision. Hospital stay was under 2 weeks in 13 patients. One death occurred due to multisystem failure prior to completion of wound closure. In our experience, early sternal debridement and omental pedicle grafting with primary closure is appropriate therapy for postcardiotomy sternotomy infections. The presence of gross purulence may require 5 days of open packing prior to omental grafting. No significant complications occurred, and mortality was low. A left subcostal incision for omental harvesting is utilized to avoid the occurrence of delayed incisional hernias.\r"

Good data, however, are not available on what percentage of the 500,000 Americans presently undergoing cholecystectomy annually might be eligible for extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy. Therefore, we studied 100 consecutive adult patients undergoing cholecystectomy and applied present exclusion criteria to determine their suitability for extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy. In each patient, preoperative history and operative findings were reviewed. Gallstone size and number were recorded, and cholesterol content and radiopacity were determined. Cholesterol stones were found in 74 patients, pigment stones in 21, and acalculous cholecystitis in 5. Of the 100 patients, only 19 (19%) had no exclusion criteria and, thus, would have been eligible for extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy. These data suggest that approximately 95,000 Americans a year will be candidates for shock wave biliary lithotripsy.\r"

There were 146 patients with a diagnosis of thyroid malignant neoplasm. All patients who had preoperative fine-needle aspiration cytologic evaluation, intraoperative frozen section analysis, or both were included in the present study. Carcinoma was diagnosed by frozen section in 87 (69%) of 126 cases. Frozen section analysis was incorrect in 39 (31%) of 126 cases. Fine-needle aspiration was performed in 62 patients. A malignant neoplasm was identified by fine-needle preoperative fine-needle aspiration and intraoperative frozen section analysis, and carcinoma was detected by both methods in 32 (57%) of 56 cases. Fine-needle aspiration cytologic evaluation is extremely valuable in the diagnosis of thyroid cancer and is at least as accurate as frozen section analysis with less morbidity and expense. When fine-needle aspiration demonstrates malignant neoplasm, thyroid resection may be planned with confidence.\r"

Mean follow-up was 6.3 years, with actuarial survival of 88% and 78% at 5 and 10 years (22 and 13 patients), respectively. Seven patients died 1.5 to 10 years after the initial operation; all had advanced disease at presentation (6 with distant, 1 with lymph node metastasis). No deaths occurred in patients with familial nonmultiple endocrine neoplasia medullary thyroid carcinoma, C-cell hyperplasia, or medullary thyroid carcinoma limited to the thyroid gland. Nineteen (68%) of 28 patients diagnosed without screening had regional or distant metastases, whereas only 6 (40%) of 15 patients diagnosed by screening had metastases. Twenty-six patients treated initially with total thyroidectomy and central neck clearance required an average of one reoperation, whereas those with lesser initial procedures required an average of two reoperations. We concluded that (1) familial nonmultiple endocrine neoplasia medullary thyroid carcinoma, early medullary thyroid carcinoma or C-cell hyperplasia, and asymptomatic patients have a good prognosis; (2) screening for medullary thyroid carcinoma by measuring serum calcitonin levels results in earlier diagnosis; and (3) total thyroidectomy and central neck clearance is the procedure of choice for medullary thyroid carcinoma.\r"

Esophagograms demonstrated the perforation in 40 (93%) of 43 patients. Treatment delays of more than 24 hours occurred in about half of spontaneous and iatrogenic perforations, but when the perforation was due to external trauma, treatment was delayed infrequently. Operative therapy in 59 (86%) of the patients included primary closure in 44 patients, drainage alone in 9 patients, and Celestin tube placement in 1 patient. Four patients with benign strictures had esophagectomy, and 4 patients with achalasia had Heller myotomy in addition to closure of the perforation. Eight (12%) of the patients were treated nonoperatively. For thoracic perforations, nonoperative treatment was reserved for patients who were diagnosed late but who had minimal evidence of sepsis. Seven (10%) of the patients died. Factors that influenced outcome included cause of perforation, anatomic location, and patient age. Our study shows that a high index of suspicion, aggressive use of esophagography, and individualized treatment are necessary for the best results when treating esophageal perforation.\r"

Encouraged by the success of saphenous vein bypass to the more proximal arteries of the lower leg, we extended this technique to the pedal arteries. Between February 1986 and September 1988, we performed 26 bypasses in 24 men (mean age, 66 years) with critical foot ischemia. Sixty-three percent of the patients had diabetes mellitus, 50% had hypertension, and 71% were actively smoking. Angiography invariably revealed multiple tibial artery occlusions with reconstitution of the pedal arteries. The foot salvage rate was 83% (mean survival, 14 months), primary patency was 83% (mean survival, 9 months), and survival was 86% (mean, 12 months). There were 11 wound complications (42%); two resulted in disruptions of the distal anastomosis and eventual graft failure. Bypass to the pedal arteries yields a high rate of foot salvage and is comparable with more proximal bypass procedures; however, wound complications are common and require special technical considerations.\r"

Plain abdominal roentgenograms with confirmatory contrast studies established the diagnosis. The debilitated condition of the patients at the time of surgery points to the need for operative intervention earlier in the clinical course. Extensive adhesions made surgical dissection difficult in one case and precluded sigmoid resection and diversion in the other.\r"

In five cases, there was paradoxic anal sphincter muscle contraction during simulated defecation straining resembling anismus-type pelvic outlet obstruction. Radiologic studies showed functional improvement of the defecatory mechanism following the administration of the dopamine receptor agonist apomorphine in four patients. Dysfunction of the striated anal sphincter musculature may be a significant cause of constipation in some parkinsonian patients, occurring as part of the generalized extrapyramidal motor disorder.\r"

Suicide attempts occurred with increased seizure activity in one epileptic; otherwise, no relationships were found with seizure-related variables. When matched by age, sex, and race with 44 nonepileptic controls from the same population, the epileptics had more borderline personality disorders with multiple impulsive suicide attempts (45.5% vs 13.6%), more psychotic disturbances, including command hallucinations (31.8% vs 9.1%), fewer adjustment disorders (18.2% vs 45.5%), and a comparable frequency of depression (13.6% vs 25%). We conclude that suicide attempts in epileptics are primarily associated with interictal psychopathologic factors, such as borderline personality disorder and psychosis, rather than with specific psychosocial stressors, seizure variables, or anticonvulsant medications.\r"

  ".W": "Assessment of the importance of interictal epileptiform abnormalities discovered with cassette electroencephalographic (EEG) monitoring requires some appreciation of the frequency with which such abnormalities may be encountered in individuals without epilepsy. From a clinical experience involving more than 2500 patients, we have defined a group of 184 patients referred because of headache, with no additional referral information to suggest seizures. Only one (0.5%) of these patients had epileptiform abnormalities on cassette EEG, yielding 95% and 99% confidence limits for the incidence of epileptiform abnormalities in the unselected nonepileptic headache population of 1.5% and 1.8%. Presuming that the incidence of cassette EEG epileptiform abnormalities in the healthy population would be no higher than in this patient group, we suggest that epileptiform abnormalities are no more likely to be incidental findings on cassette EEG monitoring than on routine EEG. Consequently, the detection of such abnormalities seems a worthwhile aspect of cassette EEG interpretation when the goal of monitoring is the detection of evidence to support a diagnosis of epilepsy.\r"

The groups were comparable in terms of demographic, injury, and medical characteristics at the time of rehabilitation center admission, but the duration from injury to rehabilitation was more than twice as long for noncenter patients. While center patients were discharged from the rehabilitation center at equivalent functional skill levels, their daily rate of functional gains during the rehabilitation center stay was significantly greater than that of noncenter patients although the length of stay at the rehabilitation center was comparable for the two groups. These results support the practice of specialized short-term spinal cord injury care as a means of enhancing rehabilitation outcome.\r"

Like CP patients, RR patients exhibited deficits on tests of information-processing speed, verbal fluency, and problem solving, and on recall measures of anterograde and remote memory. Although a few patients were mildly dysnomic, the RR patients were not generally impaired on visual confrontation naming and they did not exhibit perseverative responding on verbal fluency measures. The pattern of neuropsychological deficits exhibited by RR patients closely approximates the profile observed in other subcortical dementias and does not contain the features of cortical dementia evident in some CP patients. The impairment of RR patients on cognitive tests were less severe than those observed in CP patients in our previous studies. Differences in the age of patients in the CP and RR groups did not account for group differences in the severity of cognitive impairments, but differences in disease duration or severity of disability, as well as disease course, could explain why CP patients exhibit more serious cognitive disturbances than RR patients.\r"

To facilitate research in this area, we developed a fatigue severity scale, subjected it to tests of internal consistency and validity, and used it to compare fatigue in two chronic conditions: systemic lupus erythematosus and multiple sclerosis. Administration of the fatigue severity scale to 25 patients with multiple sclerosis, 29 patients with systemic lupus erythematosus, and 20 healthy adults revealed that the fatigue severity scale was internally consistent, correlated well with visual analogue measures, clearly differentiated controls from patients, and could detect clinically predicted changes in fatigue over time. Fatigue had a greater deleterious impact on daily living in patients with multiple sclerosis and systemic lupus erythematosus compared with controls. The results further showed that fatigue was largely independent of self-reported depressive symptoms and that several characteristics could differentiate fatigue that accompanies multiple sclerosis from fatigue that accompanies systemic lupus erythematosus. This study demonstrates (1) the clinical and research applications of a scale that measures fatigue severity and (2) helps to identify features that distinguish fatigue between two chronic medical disorders.\r"

Two further patients, 1 with Alzheimer's disease and 1 with multi-infarct dementia, proved to have white matter changes on pathologic examination. White matter pallor coexisted with cerebral amyloid angiopathy in the brains of the patients with Alzheimer's disease. The presence of severe white matter pallor in patients with Alzheimer's disease correlated with early death, while the presence of cortical scars was associated with prolonged survival. Because early death in patients with Alzheimer's disease has been linked with severe pathologic and chemical changes, the presence of white matter pallor may be further evidence of a particularly severe process in patients with early onset of Alzheimer's disease.\r"

Of the 102 subjects, 38 were diagnosed as having migraine headaches, 22 had nonmigraine headaches, and 42 were considered to be nonheadache subjects; 82% of those with migraines were stripe sensitive while only 6.2% without migraines were stripe sensitive. We conclude that stripe aversiveness is related to migraine headaches and can assist differentiation of migraine and nonmigraine headaches.\r"

In contrast, we describe a patient with carcinomatous leptomeningeal metastases who presented with clinical signs of meningitis and focal cerebral infarction. Over an 8-month period, multiple cerebral infarctions and cranial neuropathies developed. Postmortem examination of the patient's brain revealed diffuse leptomeningeal infiltration by a signet-ring adenocarcinoma. The extensive involvement of the subarachnoid space with tumor was associated with dense neoplastic infiltration of the Virchow-Robin spaces. These perivascular tumor infiltrates were accompanied by multifocal mural invasion and, less frequently, by intravascular tumor cells obliterating the lumen. Focal hemorrhagic infarcts in the cerebral cortex corresponded to areas of microscopic vasculopathy. This case provides evidence that tumor-associated vasculopathy with resultant ischemia plays a role in the pathogenesis of focal cerebral infarctions in carcinomatous leptomeningeal metastases.\r"

Improvement was seen even in patients with an acuity as good as 20/25 at baseline as well as in patients with macular edema present for more than a decade. A dosage of 500 mg/d was found to be more effective than 250 mg/d. Six patients (50%) showed lessening of their macular edema on fluorescein angiography. This angiographically demonstrated improvement was predominantly due to less detectable leakage from retinal capillaries rather than from choroidal capillaries through the retinal pigment epithelium. Improvement in visual acuity was seen in some patients without a detectable change in the amount of angiographic fluorescein leakage.\r"

After argon blue-green laser treatment sessions, sensitivity was reduced for colors lying along a tritan color-confusion line for several hours. This acute effect is due to specular \"flash-backs\" from the aiming beam off the surface of the contact lens. It is caused only by argon 488-nm light, when the aiming beam intensity is high. In addition, a correlation has been demonstrated between the number of years of laser experience and a chronic reduction in tritan color contrast sensitivity. It is suggested that repeated acute changes caused by the argon lasers may cause cumulative effects and produce a chronic threshold elevation. A simple method of eliminating the acute effect is documented.\r"

Progression of glaucomatous optic disc changes occurred in eight of nine patients. It is possible that asymptomatic miniocclusions are secondary to the changes at the bottom of the optic cup.

To determine whether corneal endothelial photosensitization could occur, rabbit corneas were exposed to physiologic concentrations of protoporphyrin and light (200 microEinsteins [microE]/m2 per second). Experimental corneas demonstrated endothelial swelling with loss of intercellular contact by scanning electron microscopy. Flux chamber experiments demonstrated an increase in the net endothelial inflow, indicating a loss of the endothelial barrier function. Control corneas had normal ultrastructural architecture and flux study results. These studies suggest that patients with long-standing hyphemas who may be exposed to long periods of light are possibly at risk for developing endothelial dysfunction and corneal blood staining. Patching of these patients' affected eyes may be prudent.\r"

Photothrombosis using intravenous rose bengal and argon laser irradiation has shown promise for occluding corneal vessels. It is therefore conceivable that photothrombosis can improve the graft survival in vascularized corneas. Using intracorneal 7-0 silk sutures as the stimuli, corneal neovascularization was induced in 1 eye each of 19 New Zealand white rabbits. Eleven eyes received photothrombosis. Successful occlusion with subsequent regression was verified by corneal fluorescein angiography. Three were assigned for observation. Six of 8 eyes receiving grafts from an outbred rabbit donor after photothrombosis remained clear during 6.5 to 18.5 weeks of follow-up, while vascularization and opacity occurred in 7 of 8 control eyes without photothrombosis. These results indicate that prior photothrombotic occlusion of corneal vessels can significantly improve graft survival in this experimental model and may have clinical applications.\r"

Analyses by an image-processing system indicated that the epithelium, especially the basal epithelium, of corneas with keratoconus had significantly higher levels of acid phosphatase, acid esterase, and acid lipase than those in normal human controls. Such an abnormality was not seen in either scarred corneas or corneas obtained from patients with Fuchs' corneal dystrophy. Our finding is consistent with the hypothesis that tissue degradation processes may be abnormal in keratoconus.

Hydrogen peroxide, at a concentration as low as 30 ppm, caused cell retraction as well as cessation of cell movement and mitotic activity. Formation of membranous vesicles preceded cell death that occurred by 7 to 8 hours after exposure to 30 ppm. With a concentration of 50 ppm, normal cell activity ceased almost instantaneously. Numerous surface vesicles formed by 1.5 hours of exposure, and the cells died by 4 to 5 hours. Higher concentrations of hydrogen peroxide (70 to 100 ppm) caused cell death within a few minutes. Because neutralization of hydrogen peroxide and patient compliance are critical in the proper use of hydrogen peroxide-based contact lens disinfection systems, users will be well served if the long-term effects of residual peroxide on the cornea are subjected to continued study.\r"

We combined iodine 125 seeds with ferromagnetic thermoseeds in a single plaque to simultaneously deliver radiation and heat in a rabbit model of choroidal melanoma. Initially, six ferromagnetic thermoseeds were placed in parallel on a 14-mm episcleral plaque. The plaques were placed on normal rabbit eyes and on eyes containing transvitreally implanted choroidal melanoma. The heating response was assessed in both normal and tumor-containing eyes. Rigid copper-constantan and flexible Baily thermocouples were used to monitor temperature responses. The animals were subjected to an electromagnetic field of 100 kHz, with power of 1100 to 1500 W. The thermoseeds autoregulated at 48.2 degrees C. Scleral temperatures stabilized at 45.8 degrees C +/- 0.4 degrees C (SD), while temperatures at the base of the tumor stabilized at 43.6 degrees C +/- 0.1 degrees C. Ferromagnetic thermoseeds were then combined with iodine 125 seeds. Similar temperature responses were recorded, and autoradiographic findings confirmed a uniform radiation distribution. Varying the amount or type of ferromagnetic material in the thermoseeds allows the delivery of heat at virtually any temperature. Ferromagnetic hyperthermia may provide a more simplified approach over currently available methods of heat delivery.\r"

A technique has been devised for the correction of epicanthal folds that involves an incision on the fold and removes muscle beneath the fold while attaching the skin edges to deep tissues in an attempt to create a crease, which may extend into normal creases.

  ".W": "We used electron microscopy (EM) to analyze 52 biopsy samples from 22 patients who were receiving long-term weekly oral doses of methotrexate (MTX) for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. Forty-eight biopsy samples were obtained after 2-6 years of continuous treatment, and 4 samples were obtained before treatment was begun. Specimens were graded for neutral fat, secondary and tertiary lysosomes, and smooth endoplasmic reticulum (SER) in hepatocytes, and for collagen in the perisinusoidal space (Disse's space). We examined the correlations between the EM findings and the light microscopic (LM) findings in the same biopsy specimens, and between the EM findings and the results of simultaneous monthly measures of aspartate transaminase, alkaline phosphatase, bilirubin, and albumin levels, as well as history of alcohol consumption before MTX treatment and monthly assessments of clinical status during the course of treatment. The presence of collagen was minimally increased in these sequential biopsy samples, whereas fat, lysosomes, and SER were decreased. The SER decrease was statistically significant. EM findings of collagen in the space of Disse did not correlate with early fibrotic changes observed with LM. Thus, after as long as 6 years of weekly oral treatment with MTX, hepatic ultrastructural changes are minimal and are not clinically significant. The use of EM for sequential biopsy studies allows the quantitation of long-term hepatic changes that may be more limited than the impression gained after LM analysis.\r"

Meta-analysis is a statistical process capable of quantitatively combining the results of these reports. This meta-analysis examines the methodologic features of studies investigating age-associated manifestations of SLE, and pools estimates of association between clinical features of SLE and age across these studies. Serositis, interstitial pulmonary disease, anti-La antibodies, and Sjogren's syndrome were most strongly and consistently associated with older-onset SLE, while alopecia, Raynaud's phenomenon, fever, lymphadenopathy, hypocomplementemia, and neuropsychiatric illness were present less frequently in this group. The extent to which information bias, selection bias, and uncontrolled confounding effects potentially influence these results is discussed. The available information in the literature does not describe the spectrum of clinical manifestations of SLE in the elderly sufficiently to allow its categorization as a distinct entity.\r"

The plasma iC3b-NEO level in 40 untreated patients with active SLE was significantly higher than that in 36 normal subjects (mean +/- SD 31.5 +/- 13.9 micrograms/ml versus 12.3 +/- 3.3 micrograms/ml; P less than 0.001). The plasma iC3b-NEO level was highly correlated with clinical disease activity (tau = 0.62, P less than 0.0001), and it was the parameter most closely correlated with renal histologic activity in lupus nephritis (tau = 0.52, P less than 0.0001). Also, patients with diffuse proliferative lupus nephritis had the highest levels of plasma iC3b-NEO among all World Health Organization classes of lupus nephritis (P less than 0.01). We conclude that the plasma iC3b-NEO level is strongly associated with clinical disease activity and renal histologic activity in patients with SLE, and that plasma iC3b-NEO may be a sensitive and useful measure of complement activation in SLE.\r"

DRw52b was positively associated with renal involvement and negatively associated with anti-nuclear RNP antibodies. Antibodies to Ro (SS-A) and La (SS-B) were associated with DR3(DRw17), DQw2.3. Early-onset SLE (less than or equal to 20 years of age) was associated with DRw8, and the frequency of neuropsychiatric involvement correlated negatively with a 3.7-kb Taq I DQ alpha RFLP. This suggests a role for DR and DQ genes in the clinical and serologic expression of SLE in American blacks.\r"

This ribosomal protein was identified as S10 on the basis of two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting, as well as immunoblots of the purified S10 protein. The S10 protein antigen was readily extracted from ribosomes at low salt (300 mM KCl) and low magnesium (0.5 mM) concentrations, consistent with the highly exposed location proposed for this protein on the 40S subunit. Anti-S10 antibodies were observed significantly more frequently in lupus sera containing both anti-Sm and antiribosomal P protein antibodies and in MRL/lpr sera with anti-Sm activity, suggesting a linked pattern of autoantibody response. Together with anti-Sm and antiribosomal P protein antibodies, anti-S10 represents a third autoantibody highly specific for lupus in humans and MLR/lpr mice.\r"

Plasma levels of the fragments C3d, C4d, and Ba were measured in patients with SSc and in matched control subjects. All fragments and ratios were higher in SSc patients than in controls (P less than 0.05), demonstrating that complement activation occurs in SSc. Levels of C3d, C3d:C3, Ba, and Ba:factor B were higher in patients with diffuse cutaneous SSc patients than in controls (P less than 0.01). C3d, C3d:C3, C4d, and C4d:C4 levels were also higher in patients with limited cutaneous SSc than in controls (P less than 0.05). These results show that complement activation occurs in SSc patients and that it reflects clinical severity. Complement activation may therefore have a pathogenetic role in SSc, and its measurement may prove useful in monitoring the disease.\r"

The partial medial meniscectomy produced pathologic changes of OA in the joints of the rabbits, which were seen when the animals were killed at 3, 6, 9, or 12 weeks postsurgery. Tibial or femoral osteophytes were seen in up to 90% of the operated joints; pitting and ulceration of medial femoral condyles were also frequently noted (77% of cases). Rabbits that underwent sham surgery, back-skin-operated rabbits, or nonoperated normal rabbits served as controls; the joints of these animals were normal at the time of killing. A rise in the level of serum KS was recorded in 50% of rabbits following partial meniscectomy, but this was matched by similar changes in the control groups. The mean serum KS level of the OA animals at serial intervals (3, 6, 9, or 12 weeks) following surgery was not significantly different from that in the control groups. When measured with a second MAb, 2-D-3, KS levels showed similar trends as with MAb 5-D-4, although lower assay values were obtained. These findings indicate that experimentally induced OA in rabbits is not associated with a significant rise in serum KS levels. KS levels did not differentiate OA from non-OA animals, nor did they parallel disease progression.\r"

The clinical setting was simulated by permitting 4 weeks ambulation without treatment, following anterior cruciate transection. Animals were then injected with GAGPS, 4 mg/kg intramuscularly, twice weekly during weeks 4-8. Control animals received intramuscular saline. The study was terminated 4 weeks after completion of the GAGPS or saline regimen (i.e., 12 weeks postoperatively). Cartilage from the medial femoral condyle was analyzed for collagen integrity (swelling properties), hydroxyproline, uronic acid, active and total proteoglycan (PG)-degrading metalloproteinase, PG-degrading serine proteinase, and histopathology (Mankin score). Condylar cartilage from animals treated with GAGPS demonstrated less cartilage swelling, less total and active metalloproteinase, and lower histopathologic scores than were found in cartilage from saline-treated animals. GAGPS was able to suppress PG-degrading enzyme activity and maintain a more normal-appearing cartilage. It is proposed that GAGPS suppressed PG breakdown by decreasing synthesis of metalloproteinase or by directly inhibiting metalloproteinase in cartilage, rather than by increasing synthesis of PG by chondrocytes.\r"

A survey of 250 facilities across the United States was performed to gather information about the observation unit phenomenon. Of the 250 hospitals in the survey group, 27% had operational observation or holding units and another 16% planned units within 1 year. A statistically significant increase in the use of these units was noted in nonteaching facilities when compared with their teaching counterparts. A trend toward higher use of observation units in suburban/urban settings was noted when compared with rural locations, although the difference was not statistically significant. Of the units in existence, 93% were located within the ED, staffed by emergency physicians, and administrated by the ED director. Most are staffed by ED nurses and ancillary help. No hospital had both an ED unit and a non-ED unit, and many units functioned as both holding and observation areas. The units are perceived to be beneficial in patient care and in lowering health care casts, although objective documentation to validate these beliefs is lacking. Further prospective research is needed to evaluate these units scientifically before broad recommendations can be made.\r"

Expected findings included a decrease in emergency department visits the day of the storm, followed by a sharp increase the day after. Clean-up activities accounted for a large number of the injuries, most of which were preventable. Unexpected findings include a large number of carbon monoxide poisonings and disposition and staffing problems created by caring for many patients who lost access to customary home health care services. Emergency department staff are encouraged to engage in public education efforts that may reduce serious illness or injury related to severe weather and its aftermath. Moreover, traditional disaster plans may need to be supplemented in anticipation of the disposition and staffing problems created by a growing population of elderly patients who will be cut off from vital home health care services by severe weather.\r"

After the hypoxic episode, 34% of newborn mice survived, 59% manifested cerebral parenchymal hemorrhage. Cortical hemorrhage could be detected in live mice; intracranial hemorrhage was observed through the thin skin and skull. Cortical hemorrhage usually affected the bilateral parietal regions symmetrically and neuronal destruction was observed in the deeper structures, as well as in the cerebral cortex. This pattern of damage was comparable to parasagittal cerebral injury in humans. The onset of cortical hemorrhage and neuropathology in these mice suggested that hemorrhage occurred when cerebral blood flow recovered after the hypoxic event.\r"

The errors in diagnosis resulted in many years of treatment delay with consequent further visual impairment or no improvement in vision and a possible reduced efficacy of treatment. This delay may explain some of the controversy surrounding the role of radiotherapy in the management of these tumors. The diagnosis of optic nerve glioma must be considered in any child who presents with failing vision, optic atrophy, and/or nystagmus, in whom there is no demonstrable intraocular cause.\r"

Fibroblasts contained extremely low pyruvate carboxylase activity. The patient died at 12 weeks of age after recurrent episodes of profound acidosis. At autopsy, the brain manifested cystic degeneration and demyelination. Pyruvate carboxylase deficiency is associated with neonatal onset of acidosis, delayed development, seizures, hypotonia, recurrent profound acidosis, and early death. The dramatic rise in plasma alanine content coincident with ACTH therapy suggest that ACTH played a role in precipitating the catastrophic metabolic acidosis.\r"

Cloned populations from this cell line differed in their ability to produce brain tumors in vivo. In vitro transforming growth factor-beta secretion by each clone correlated with in vivo tumorigenicity. Mitogenic activity like that produced with platelet-derived growth factor was also secreted by each clone and correlated with in vivo tumorigenicity. Epidermal growth factor and transforming growth factor-alpha production was not detected in any of the clones of canine gliosarcoma cells. Although only some of the brain tumor cell clones were able to produce tumors in immunologically normal dogs, brain tumors were produced in all dogs pretreated with cyclosporin and in all \"nude\" mice, suggesting that tumor immunology plays an important role in this brain tumor model. In vitro cloning efficiency of each brain tumor cell clone also correlated with in vivo tumorigenicity. We postulate that transforming growth factor-beta may both stimulate brain tumor cell growth and inhibit host antitumor immune surveillance.\r"

Occasionally, reports are received of neurologic disturbances temporally related to receipt of vaccine. Most of these disturbances are events that regularly occur in the absence of immunization. It is then difficult to determine whether the relationship between the immunization and illness is causal or coincidental. We developed a method to assess causation of serious neurologic events by probability theory. By combining epidemiologic information on disease incidence with specific elements of the patient history, an estimate of the odds of vaccine causation can be derived, based on rational assumptions rather than observer bias. The result is not a diagnosis but an estimate of probability.\r"

Facial weakness was not associated with prenatal-onset hemiparesis, but sometimes occurred with onset of hemiparesis during the first year of life. In contrast, facial weakness was generally present when all patients with postnatal-onset hemiparesis were considered as a group. With double hemiparesis, facial weakness was common, regardless of age at onset. These findings suggest that facial sparing results from plasticity of the developing corticobulbar tract, the critical period ending during the first year of life. Decreased synapse elimination of uninjured, ipsilateral terminals is suggested as the mechanism of facial sparing. Facial weakness accompanying double hemiparesis thus would be a reflection of absence of an uninjured pathway.\r"

The other patient, a 2-year-old female, manifested hypotonia, facial grimacing, and athetosis. Symmetric lesions in the globus pallidus and substantia nigra were demonstrated by imaging studies. The nature and monophasic course of illness in these 2 patients, as well as the symmetric involvement of specific regions of the basal ganglia, may result from an immune-mediated postinfectious demyelinating process.\r"

Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging revealed extensive low-density areas with left-sided predominance in the white matter at age 17 months. The flash visual evoked potential revealed abnormal findings of wave V. At 20 months of age, paraplegia developed; as it receded 3 months later, a left hemiparesis developed. At that time, computed tomography demonstrated a new low-density area in the right centrum semiovale which disappeared at 28 months of age concomitant with the recovery of the left hemiparesis. Overall, he had experienced 3 independent episodes, 2 of which corresponded to each of the lesions depicted by computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging. Multiple sclerosis was diagnosed at 23 months of age which is earlier than in any previously reported patient. Unlike most typical findings of multiple sclerosis on computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging studies, our patient demonstrated extensive white matter lesions.\r"

This report explores (1) the major differences between ambulatory and inpatient educational settings, (2) potential educational outcomes of clinical teaching in the ambulatory setting, (3) instructional models that can be used to meet educational objectives, (4) the potential barriers and critical issues that must be considered when implementing ambulatory educational experiences, and (5) evaluation strategies for measuring the educational outcome.\r"

The case method was used for all teaching in the curriculum, as it is throughout the New Pathway. Students worked together in small groups, addressing the issues raised by each case under the direction of faculty preceptors. The component was taught by clinicians as part of a two-year course in which students learned clinical skills and addressed topics from the social sciences and medical humanities. In addition, issues in health promotion and disease prevention were integrated into the cases used to teach the other components of the New Pathway curriculum.\r"

Data were gathered on the specialty affiliations of the physicians who requested 211 consecutive consultations, on the clinical problems encountered, and on the most likely diagnosis for each problem. In some instances the referral patterns, patient mixes, and clinical diagnoses observed in the community-based practice differed significantly from those often emphasized in training programs in academic medical centers. Such differences may be unintentionally reinforced, because the clinical literature in which new findings are reported and validated largely arises from university-type clinical practices. Specific examples of the differences observed and some suggestions for change are given. Although additional research is needed to confirm the findings of this study, and although these findings may not be applicable to other settings or other internal medicine subspecialties, these findings raise questions about the appropriateness of completely university-based training in preparing physicians for practice in a community setting. The authors suggest that cooperation between community hospitals and established university programs could bring about the best opportunities for clinical training.\r"

The hospital charts of 44 patients who were autologous blood donors undergoing elective orthopedic surgery and a matched group of 44 patients who were not autologous blood donors were analyzed to determine their physicians' transfusion practices. The groups were matched for age and sex distribution and for procedure. The results suggested that the physicians accepted lower hematocrit levels for autologous-donor patients, did not request adequate amounts of autologous blood, overtransfused some patients with their own blood, and did not schedule the elective procedures far enough in advance to allow patients to deposit the requested amounts of autologous blood. A CME program developed to address the latter three problems was given to seven subspecialty groups in a grand rounds lecture format. Follow-up comparisons of the orthopedic surgeons' blood transfusion practices indicate that after the CME program they did significantly less underordering of autologous blood but still did not increase the time for patients to donate the requested amounts of blood.\r"

Dietary calcium intake and urinary and fecal calcium output were measured simultaneously with indices of sodium and phosphate homeostasis in male rats of the Milan hypertensive and normotensive strains. In addition, urinary calcium and creatinine excretion rates, calcium, phosphate and creatinine serum concentrations, and bone calcium content were also measured in these rats after an overnight fast. Under fed steady-state conditions dietary calcium, sodium, and phosphate intakes, were similar in the two groups of rats, but hypertensive rats had twofold higher urinary calcium excretion and normal urinary excretion of sodium and phosphate. Fecal calcium output was slightly but significantly higher in the adult hypertensive rats while fecal sodium and phosphate excretion was normal. Because of increased urinary and fecal calcium loss, net calcium balance was significantly less positive in hypertensive than in control rats. Under fasting conditions hypertensive rats were confirmed to have hypercalciuria despite normal serum calcium concentrations and normal creatinine clearance. In accordance with balance data and fasting hypercalciuria, bone calcium content was found to be significantly reduced in hypertensive rats. These findings confirm that hypercalciuria in the Milan hypertensive rats is explained by an altered renal calcium handling; it is also associated with a slightly increased fecal calcium output and, therefore, with a less positive calcium balance and reduced bone calcium content.\r"

After a 5 day balance study, serum ionized calcium, PTH, and 1,25 dihydroxy vitamin D concentrations were measured in Dahl-S and salt resistant (R) rats that had been maintained on a \"normal\" (1%) or high (7%) NaCl intake. Blood pressure was higher in Dahl-S than R (P less than .01), but was not affected by 5 days of high NaCl. On both NaCl intakes, urine calcium excretion was increased, serum calcium was decreased, and serum PTH and 1,25 dihydroxy vitamin D were increased in Dahl-S compared to Dahl-R (P less than .01). On the high NaCl intake, fecal calcium was greater in Dahl-S than in Dahl-R, and net 5 day calcium balance was less positive in Dahl-S (P less than .05). In contrast to NaCl, a high dietary intake of sodium with anions other than chloride (NaAA) fails to produce hypertension in the Dahl-S rat. NaAA loading resulted in decreased urine calcium excretion (P less than .01), and after 5 days of the high NaAA diet, serum calcium and PTH did not differ in Dahl-S and Dahl-R. Thus, alterations of calcium, PTH, and vitamin D precede NaCl-induced hypertension in Dahl-S. These alterations may contribute to the development of hypertension in this animal model.\r"

  ".W": "Concentrations of sodium-transport inhibitors (STI) which block the sodium-potassium-ATPase pump are increased in the plasma and urine of volume-expanded and low-renin hypertensive humans and animals. To evaluate the physiologic relevance of STI to blood-pressure-raising mechanisms, we have examined the in vitro properties of STI extracted from the urine of human subjects. STI produced a significant (by ANOVA: P less than .01) dose-contraction response in the isolated rabbit femoral artery. Moreover, small noncontractile doses of STI in this in vitro preparation produced a fivefold leftward shift in the contraction dose-response curve of norepinephrine (P less than .01) and a threefold shift for angiotensin II (P less than .01); at lower, physiologic, concentrations of these vasoconstrictor hormones the amplifications in contraction caused by STI ranged from 100% to 500%. In studies in calcium-free tissue bath solutions, the direct contractile action of STI was abolished; however, its amplification of responses to norepinephrine remained, suggesting that this latter effect of STI is not entirely dependent upon calcium influx into vascular smooth muscle cells. The glycoside ouabain produced effects identical to those of STI in arteries, but its actions on a rabbit atrium preparation were different: ouabain stimulated powerful inotropic effects, whereas human STI failed to cause myocardial contractions even though the amounts of STI administered had the same sodium-transport inhibitory capacity as the ouabain. Thus, the actions of human STI are primarily in the peripheral circulation, where they directly produce arterial contractions and also enhance contractile responses to other pressor hormones, suggesting that they may have a role in regulating systemic blood pressure.\r"

Aortic segments (with endothelium) of either WKY or SHR were perfused at different flow rates (1 or 4 mL/min) with modified Krebs-Ringer solution; the relaxing activity of the perfusate from the two types of segments was bioassayed by measuring the isometric force in rings (without endothelium, and contracted with norepinephrine) of aortas of both WKY and SHR. All studies were performed in the presence of indomethacin to prevent endothelial production of prostacyclin and other vasodilator prostanoids. The basal release of endothelium-derived relaxing factor was not significantly affected by the flow rate in either the WKY or the SHR aortas. At the two flow rates, and with both types of bioassay rings, the basal release of endothelium-derived relaxing factor was smaller with SHR than with WKY aortas, but this reached significance only at 4 mL/min using the SHR-aorta as bioassay tissue. Both with WKY and SHR aortas the release of endothelium-derived relaxing factor evoked by acetylcholine was significantly larger at 1 than at 4 mL/min; no significant differences in responsiveness to acetylcholine were noted between WKY and SHR segments. There was also no difference in responsiveness of WKY and SHR bioassay rings to acetylcholine and acetylcholine-induced release of endothelium-derived relaxing factor. These experiments suggest that prolonged exposure to increases in shear stress reduces the ability of the endothelium to release endothelium-derived relaxing factor in responses to muscarinic activation.\r"

The mechanism of the pressor effect of ethanol is not well understood. We studied the in vitro effects of increasing amounts of ethanol on different Na+ transport systems from human erythrocytes. Ethanol at concentrations higher than 32 mmol/L stimulated ouabain-sensitive Na+ efflux, the Na+ efflux depending on the Na+:Li+ countertransport and Na+ leak. At the same concentrations, ethanol inhibited bumetanide-sensitive Na+ efflux. We conclude that, with the exception of Na+-K+ pump, alcohol-induced alterations and those observed in erythrocytes from essential hypertensives may overlap. Therefore, alcohol consumption could potentiate those genetic abnormalities of Na+ transport and contribute to the pathogenesis of essential hypertension.\r"

Two sets of comparisons were made between two trained observers and the monitors on 17 normotensive and 28 hypertensive subjects. The result of the first comparison showed that the average difference between observers and the PIV was 1.2/-2.2 mm Hg for systolic and diastolic BP. Comparisons of both monitors to the observers showed differences of 0.9/1.0 mm Hg for the PIV and 0.3/0.8 mm Hg for the 90202 (systolic/diastolic). Correlations between the average observer reading and the monitors over both sets of comparisons ranged from 0.90 (diastolic 90202 vs observer) to 0.98 (systolic PIV vs observer). The percentage of readings within 5 mm Hg between observer and monitor over all comparisons ranged from a low of 68% (90202, systolic and diastolic) to a high of 83% (PIV, diastolic). In general, both devices are satisfactory and reliable machines for ambulatory BP monitoring, but each has a slightly different bias compared to auscultatory readings.\r"

  ".W": "To determine if a remodeling of the collagen matrix would occur in the absence of hypertrophy and cell necrosis and if such a remodeling could alter active and passive stiffness of the intact myocardium, five rats with genetic hypertension (SHR) were treated (SHRT) with hydralazine for 32 weeks, beginning at four weeks of age, and compared to six age- and sex-matched SHR and seven Wistar-Kyoto genetic control rats (WKY). Left ventricular (LV) weight of SHRT was 17% lower (P less than .001) than that of SHR and 19% higher (P less than .01) than that of WKY. Collagen volume fraction of SHR (13.7 +/- 3.2%) and SHRT (9.9 +/- 1.8%) were greater (P less than .01) than WKY (5.0 +/- 1.9%). Diastolic and systolic stress-strain relations were determined in the isolated heart. A comparison of these relations revealed: 1) a 24% increase in passive stiffness for SHR and SHRT; and 2) a reduced zero-strain intercept (41% to 54%) and slope (36% to 48%) of the developed stress-strain relation for the SHRT. Thus, in SHR, collagen remodeling occurred in the absence of hypertrophy which suggests that the muscular and collagenous compartments of the myocardium are under separate controls. The excess accumulation of collagen in SHR and SHRT leads to abnormal passive stiffness, and the prevention of hypertrophy with hydralazine reduces active stiffness.\r"

The present trial work was undertaken so as to obtain further information concerning the action of a new furopyridine, cicletanine. Forty-six males--SHR-SP/Iffa Credo rats--aged 7 weeks, were divided into three groups. Group 1 was a control group, groups 2 and 3 were orally treated with cicletanine at 30 and 100 mg/kg. Their drinking water contained 1% NaCl. Systolic blood pressure, body weight, and survival were recorded. After 6 weeks, all the rats were sacrificed. Samples of heart, brain, and kidney were fixed for light and ultrastructural examination. We found that cicletanine treatment (30 and 100 mg/kg) had significantly inhibited the incidence of hypertensive cerebral damages as characterized by cerebral infarction and vascular alterations with fibrinoid necrosis. Compared with the control group, the rats treated with the cicletanine had a significantly increased survival rate (P less than .001); the cicletanine also had an important protective effect on tissue. Cicletanine administration prevented the development of hypertensive cerebral vascular damage, probably through direct action on the vascular walls.\r"

  ".U": "90027602\r", 
  ".W": "A highly active angiotensin-producing enzyme (enzyme III) was obtained from the serum of bilaterally nephrectomized dogs by acid treatment and ammonium sulfate fractionation. An inactive precursor (proenzyme III) was converted to enzyme III during prolonged storage (or by treatment with acid or with cathepsin G or by incubation at 38 degrees C as described in the following paper). Enzyme III reacted maximally at pH 7.7 and it produced up to 400 ng of angiotensin II/mL serum/h (i.e., amounts 4000 times higher than that generated by the endogenous renin present in serum after bilateral nephrectomy). Enzyme III produced angiotensin II at identical rates when either dog angiotensinogen or angiotensin I was used as substrate, but the rate was 710 times higher with synthetic tetradecapeptide renin substrate. Enzyme III is not identical to renin, cathepsin G, tonin, enzyme I, enzyme II, the calcium-dependent angiotensin I-converting enzyme, or the calcium-independent carboxy peptidase, which acts by sequential cleavage of angiotensin I. Enzyme III was inhibited by alpha-1-antitrypsin, diisopropyl fluorophosphate, and lima bean trypsin inhibitor (hence it is a serine proteinase). It was not inhibited by Captopril, Teprotide, or Enalapril. It had been reported previously that cathepsin G released from neutrophil granulocytes, by producing high local concentrations of angiotensin II, may provide a mobile means for modulating blood flow in tissue microvasculature during the inflammatory response. The present study offers a new, additional pathway, by enzyme III, for a similar rapid formation of angiotensin II from serum protein substrate or angiotensin I.\r"

  ".W": "Enzyme III and its inactive precursor proenzyme III have been obtained from the acidified serum of bilaterally nephrectomized dogs. Enzyme III occurs in a concentration producing angiotensin at a rate 50 times higher than the residual renin. Much higher concentrations of enzyme III have been obtained by three activation procedures: a) by storage for several months in the frozen state; b) by treatment at 0 degrees C and pH 3.0; or c) by incubation at 38 degrees C and pH 7.7. These procedures yielded levels of enzyme III that produced up to 400 ng angiotensin II/mL serum/h, i.e., 4000 times higher than the endogenous renin. Of further significance, the angiotensin II produced by enzyme III represents the octapeptide with the highest known vasoconstrictor activity. This is in contrast to renin, enzyme I, and enzyme II, all of which produced angiotensin I, the decapeptide without appreciable vasoconstrictor activity. The endogenous activating enzyme has been identified as cathepsin G by the following six experimental observations: both the endogenous activating enzyme and exogenous cathepsin G produced enzyme III from proenzyme III according to the same unusual sigmoid kinetics; they were blocked identically by antibody to human cathepsin G. Also, both were inhibited similarly by alpha-1-antitrypsin, lima bean trypsin inhibitor, diisopropyl fluorophosphate, or by an inhibitor present in dog serum. Thus, removal of this inhibitor and activation of proenzyme III by endogenous or by added cathepsin G are prerequisites to obtaining enzyme III; this provides a novel mechanism for the rapid formation of angiotensin II from serum protein substrate or from angiotensin I.\r"

The increase in plasma noradrenaline significantly correlated with the change in platelet aggregation (3 microM ADP: r = 0.73, P less than .02, 3.0 micrograms/mL epinephrine: r = 0.65, P less than .05), and with mean blood pressure in the warn environment (r = 0.76, P less than .02). These results suggest that the cold-related increase in sympathetic nervous activity may contribute to enhancement of platelet function.

Detailed studies of sensory conduction in various median and ulnar branches and segments indicate that conduction velocities measured and calculated by standard methods are different in the different nerves, segments and branches. In particular, the velocity in the middle digit branch of the median nerve is slower than that in the index, and that in the 3-4 palmar branch is slower than that in the 2-3 palmar branch. Median and ulnar sensory conduction velocities are not well correlated in the same hand in the same individual, so comparison of these nerves for diagnostic purposes is subject to some risk. Palmar and digital conduction velocity in the same nerve may not be identical and the median nerve may have asymptomatic palmar slowing of no clinical significance. The conclusion that abnormality is present must take these factors into account.\r"

Several factors including the age, sex, mental state, the type of operation and the preoperative ambulation level of the patients were studied to predict the ambulation progress of the patients. The most important factors affecting the ambulation progress were the age and the preoperative ambulation level of the patient. Because of the general trend in the aging of the population, an increase in the number of hip fractures is expected.

Statistical programs are then used to locate possible data errors by finding data points (outliers) that are very different from the average. Special graphic output of statistical programs, scatterplots and box and whisker plots can be used to further locate questionable data. Examples of data entry forms and annotated step by step data cleaning with the use of inexpensive programs for personal computers are presented.\r"

Use of Cox regression methods identified five disease-related characteristics significantly associated with survival. These form the basis of the new staging system. A second system including antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity was developed because a high antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity titer correlated with good prognosis. The two new systems are better predictors of outcome than are the traditional staging systems. The unique World Health Organization 2 and 3 morphologic forms of nasopharyngeal carcinoma appear to be chronic diseases, because the risk of death does not level off with time, as it does for most other cancers.\r"

Of all the histopathologic features of the primary lesion studied, vascular invasion had the greatest impact on survival, as confirmed by both univariate and multivariate analysis. In addition, vascular invasion correlated statistically with local recurrence, neck recurrence, and distant metastasis.\r"

This concept, we hoped, would enable us to reconstruct anatomic regions with a special contour that is otherwise difficult to achieve with conventional flaps and grafts. The first stage of this method includes implantation of a preshaped alloplastic material in a donor site of a commonly used myocutaneous flap and waiting 4 to 6 weeks for the implant to \"take.\" The second stage includes raising the pedicled flap with the implant and transferring it to reconstruct the defect. As a model for this approach, tracheal defects in dogs were created and reconstructed. The technique used in this study can be specifically applied to reconstruction of tracheal defects, ie, subglottic stenosis, and also can be used for other defects in the head and neck region.\r"

Major head and neck surgical procedures at three University of Washington (Seattle)-affiliated hospitals during 1987 were reviewed. Seventy-seven patients were identified. Parameters studied included the following: tumor site and stage, prior treatment, surgical procedure, preoperative and postoperative hematocrit values, estimated blood loss, operative and postoperative blood product use, and operative time. Data were grouped by procedure. Maxillectomy/midface procedures showed the highest average estimated blood loss (1037 mL) and the highest average blood use (1.5 units), followed by composite resections (883 mL and 0.8 units) and laryngectomies (724 mL and 0.9 units). When the data were subgrouped, larynogopharyngectomy (1450 mL and 4.0 units) and composite resection with mandibular swing (1300 mL and 1.0 units) showed the highest blood loss and blood product use. In the assessable groups, previous administration of radiation did not make a significant difference in blood loss or procedure time. However, blood loss correlated well with procedure time in all groups. The great majority of patients met all requirements to function as blood donors (84%). Sixty-five percent of patients met all criteria and used less than 2 units of blood, making autologous blood a reasonable option for the majority of patients with head and neck tumors.\r"

Forty-eight patients underwent the procedure and were followed up for at least 2 years or until death. Seventeen underwent the surgery for recurrence after failure of radiation therapy for cure. Complications included one wound infection and one laryngocutaneous fistula. All patients underwent decannulation, with little or no compromise of swallowing. All but 1 now have functional voices. Of 8 patients with recurrence, 6 have been salvaged. Two patients died of disease. The value of near-total laryngectomy with epiglottic reconstruction for management of glottic cancer is reviewed.\r"

Recent evidence for the potential importance of in lymphokine interleukin 2 (IL-2) in patients with cancer prompted a study of the kinetics of IL-2 receptor expression on lymphocytes from patients with untreated advanced head and neck cancer and normal subjects and an evaluation of the in vitro effects of the T-cell immune-reconstituting peptide, thymosin alpha 1. Concanavalin A-stimulated IL-2 receptor expression was maximal after 72 hours and was higher in normal subjects than in patients. This was due to lower levels of helper/inducer (CD4) cells expressing IL-2 receptors in the patients compared with the normal subjects. Thymosin alpha 1 further decreased levels of IL-2 receptor-positive (both CD4 and CD8) cells at 48 and at 72 hours. At 96 hours, levels of IL-2 receptor-positive cells and proportions of cells in G2 and M phases of the cell cycle were similar among both groups of subjects. Simultaneous cell kinetic studies indicated that thymosin alpha 1 down regulation of IL-2 receptors was not due to an effect on proliferation and that differences in IL-2 receptor expression at 72 hours among normal subjects and the patients with cancer were more likely related to differences in cell proliferation kinetics.\r"

We measured, in addition to obstructive apnea, the frequency of sleep-related partial upper airway obstruction in 11 patients with the obstructive sleep apnea syndrome both before and after uvulopalatopharyngoplasty. Partial obstruction was detected indirectly by recording the secondary hemodynamic changes and respiratory stimulation with the static charge sensitive bed. The frequency of obstructive apnea episodes was reduced from 56.3% to 18.4% by the operation, while the episodes of increased respiratory resistance rose from 3.6% to 20.4%. The various breathing anomalies decreased significantly, although they were still present during 75.6% of the recording time. The results suggest that uvulopalatopharyngoplasty substantially reduces the frequency of obstructive apnea, some of which persists as partial obstruction. The persistent partial obstruction may be the key factor contributing to further pharyngeal narrowing and a recurrence of obstructive sleep apnea syndrome.\r"

  ".W": "To assess the potential protective role of collateral vessels 27 patients undergoing angioplasty of the left anterior descending coronary artery were studied by intravenous digital subtraction left ventriculography. Fifteen patients had no collateral vessels (group 1) and 12 had some degree of collateral supply (group 2). During balloon inflation ST segment elevation in group 1 (4.9 mm) was significantly greater than that in group 2 (0.9 mm). Similarly the reduction in left ventricular ejection fraction was significantly greater in group 1 (24%) than in group 2 (12%). Both the size of ST segment elevation and the fall in ejection fraction correlated inversely with the extent of the collateral supply (r = -0.680 and r = -0.446 respectively). During balloon occlusion of the anterior descending coronary artery the percentage shortening of the anterior and apical segments fell in both groups but apical shortening fell to a lesser extent in group 2. An additional reduction in anterobasal contraction was confined to group 1. Electrocardiographic and ventriculographic manifestations of ischaemia produced by balloon inflation during angioplasty are less pronounced when collateral vessels are present. This suggests that the collateral circulation can protect myocardium at risk of ischaemia after coronary occlusion.\r"

  ".W": "A dilated left ventricle with reduced ejection fraction is usually attributed to impaired systolic function. To investigate the possibility that ventricular filling might also be disturbed, M mode echocardiograms, phonocardiograms, and Doppler cardiograms were recorded in 30 patients with ventricular disease of varying cause. All but four had functional mitral regurgitation. The size of the left ventricular cavity was increased in all and peak velocity of circumferential fibre shortening was reduced. Diastolic abnormalities included a short isovolumic relaxation time, and, on digitised M mode, a reduced rate of dimension increase and of posterior wall thinning. Although the timing of aortic valve closure was normal, mitral regurgitation persisted beyond it by 95 (35) ms and beyond mitral valve opening by 60 (40) ms. This reduced the effective filling time (the interval when the mitral valve was open and mitral regurgitation was absent) to less than 200 ms in seven patients. The effective filling time correlated closely with the RR interval, the regression equation indicating a reduction of 80 ms for each 100 ms fall in RR interval. It was also independently shortened by 2 ms a year with increasing age. The effective left ventricular filling time may thus be very short in patients with left ventricular cavity dilatation and functional mitral regurgitation. It is suggested that when diastolic function is also abnormal, this short filling time may physically limit ventricular inflow. Its close relation to heart rate might contribute to the therapeutic effect of beta blockade in such patients.\r"

  ".W": "Respiratory effort during inspiration, expiration, and the Valsalva manoeuvre changes right ventricular preload and afterload. On inspiration these changes should improve systolic emptying of a larger end diastolic volume and so increase the ejection fraction, whereas on expiration the reverse should be true. The resting right ventricular ejection fraction was measured by first pass radionuclide angiography with gold-195m (half life 30.5 s) in 17 individuals at maximal inspiration and expiration and in eight at rest and during the strain phase (phase 2) of the Valsalva manoeuvre. The right ventricular ejection fraction was significantly lower during expiration than during inspiration. There were, however, no significant differences in bolus duration or right ventricular transit time. The Valsalva manoeuvre, in contrast, significantly increased the ejection fraction and also significantly prolonged both the bolus duration and right ventricular transit time. The conformation of the bolus curves during the Valsalva manoeuvre suggested the development of tricuspid regurgitation. These data suggest that relative influences of venous return, pulmonary arterial pressure, pulmonary vascular resistance, and possible functional tricuspid regurgitation vary during inspiration, expiration, and the Valsalva manoeuvre and can affect the right ventricular ejection fraction. Changes in right ventricular function on exercise assessed by first pass radionuclide angiography must be interpreted with caution because maximal respiratory effort may alter the right ventricular ejection fraction independently of ischaemia or other non-ischaemic factors.\r"

Confirmatory cardiac catheterisation was performed in 12 patients. Eighteen patients had surgical repair with inspection of the defect. Six patients in whom recurrent ventricular septal rupture developed were also investigated by Doppler echocardiography and colour flow mapping. Cross sectional echocardiography correctly predicted the infarct territory in all cases but visualised the septal rupture in only seven (35%). Pulsed and continuous wave Doppler detected a disturbance of right ventricular systolic flow that was diagnostic of a ventricular septal rupture in 19 (95%), but this only accurately predicted the site in 14 (70%). Colour flow mapping studies showed a mosaic jet traversing the interventricular septum in all 20 cases, and this accurately predicted the site of rupture. In addition colour flow mapping defined three sites of ventricular septal rupture: apical, posterior, and anterior trabecular. Five of the six patients with recurrent rupture were correctly diagnosed by pulsed and continuous wave Doppler and all six were diagnosed by colour flow mapping. Cross sectional echocardiography with colour flow mapping is a highly sensitive and rapid technique for the assessment of postinfarction ventricular septal rupture before and after operation. It was more informative about the site of the rupture than pulsed and continuous wave Doppler echocardiography.\r"

In the group with ventricular septal rupture there was more left ventricular damage, with aneurysm formation in two thirds, and coronary angiography showed more single than triple vessel disease. In the comparison group there was more triple vessel disease than single vessel disease. Angiographically demonstrable collaterals to the infarct territory were not seen or only very faintly seen in 82% of those with septal rupture. Well developed collaterals were seen in two thirds of the comparison group. These patterns of coronary disease suggest that ventricular septal rupture is more likely in patients with coronary occlusion and little or no collateral support to the infarct territory.\r"

  ".W": "The relation of cigarette smoking to both coronary disease and non-fatal myocardial infarction was examined in a cross sectional study of 1053 women who underwent coronary arteriography. As compared with the 489 women who had never smoked cigarettes, ever-smokers (mean duration of smoking, 25 years) were 1.6 times as likely to have significant stenotic disease and were 1.9 times as likely to have suffered a myocardial infarction. These associations were strongest in women under 50 years of age, with odds ratios of 3.5 for coronary artery disease and 4.5 for myocardial infarction. Although the extent of stenotic disease and prior myocardial infarction were strongly associated, women who smoked cigarettes remained at increased risk of a myocardial infarction even after their increased coronary artery disease had been taken into account. For example, heavy smokers (greater than 30 pack-years) were 2.3 times as likely to have had a myocardial infarction as were non-smokers; controlling for the extent of stenotic disease (in addition to age and other risk factors) reduced the estimated relative risk to only 1.9. Stratified analyses showed that this increased risk for clinical disease among smokers was evident at all levels of occlusion, even among women with minimal stenotic disease. These results, collected at the time of arteriography, suggest that non-atherogenic mechanisms may be important in the aetiology of myocardial infarction among women who smoke cigarettes.\r"

Four flow patterns were obtained: (a) continuous flow, maximum velocity in late systole with gradual fall throughout diastole; (b) continuous flow, high systolic flow with rapid fall to a very low early diastolic velocity maintained throughout diastole; (c) continuous low velocity, maximum in late diastole; and (d) bidirectional flow. Flow pattern (a) was associated with normal or slightly raised pulmonary artery pressure; (b) with raised pulmonary artery pressure; and (c) and (d) with pulmonary artery pressure at systemic values. Comparison of the Doppler and measured pressure differences between the great arteries was reasonably good for peak values but poor for the trough readings. Doppler ultrasound clearly showed ductal flow; the flow pattern gave an indication of the pulmonary artery pressure, but pressure measurement by application of the Bernoulli equation to the flow velocities cannot yet be regarded as reliable.\r"

The remaining four patients had two anterosuperior leaflets. Five patients had hearts with a double inlet right ventricle and all of them had a rudimentary left ventricle. All the commissures were attached to the right ventricle. Five patients showed severe right ventricular dominance. The atrioventricular morphology in these five hearts differed from that in the patients with the usual atrial arrangement, concordant atrioventricular connection, and hypoplasia of the left ventricle. Only the anterosuperior leaflet bridged the rudimentary left ventricle, and the posteroinferior leaflet was tethered to the ventricular septal crest. Six patients had a biventricular atrioventricular connection and two of them showed mild right ventricular dominance. The atrioventricular morphology in these hearts was the same as that seen in the patients with usual atrial arrangement and a concordant atrioventricular connection.

In order to assess its effects on image quantification, frames from a sector scanner with a six bit grey scale were stored and processed off line to identify and smooth the speckle by means of an adaptive filter based on fully developed speckle. In 14 controls, 12 patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and 12 with secondary left ventricular hypertrophy, filtering significantly reduced the standard deviation of echo intensity, which was used as a measure of the scatter of pixel amplitude, in all three groups (by 52%, 46%, and 46% respectively). The mean value of back-scattered echo intensity itself, however, was reduced by only 7%, 5%, and 8% respectively, and median values were not affected at all. Mean (SD) left ventricular cavity areas on the apical four chamber view were significantly increased from 26 (15) to 30 (17) cm2. The valve dimensions in the parasternal minor axis in 10 patients with mitral stenosis were significantly increased by 11% laterally, but were unaffected anteroposteriorly. Subjective image quality was appreciably modified: endocardial boundaries in apical views were enhanced and the septal \"ground glass\" appearance was lost in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Speckle reduction therefore greatly reduced the scatter of pixel values, with little effect on the mean regional back scattered echo amplitude. It also modified the perceived image texture. Improved boundary definition consistently increased the area estimates, particularly when these depended on lateral rather than range resolution.\r"

There were no major practical problems. The morphology of the defects in all 17 hearts was displayed in great detail. In some instances, the interpretation of the images resembled that of equivalent images from cross sectional echocardiography. But this new technique allowed imaging in planes that cannot be obtained by echocardiography. One particularly valuable plane gave a face on view of the inlet and trabecular components of the septum. This allowed very precise localisation of defects in these areas. The relation between the defects and the atrioventricular and arterial valves was exceptionally well shown in various different imaging planes. One patient in the series had multiple trabecular defects that were clearly shown. Magnetic resonance imaging gives detailed morphological information about ventricular septal defects.\r"

There was marked variation in response to paralysis: some infants demonstrated no change in Crs between the two states; others had values of Crs which were significantly higher during paralysis with controlled ventilation than during spontaneous breathing. A possible cause of these differences may be the type of controlled ventilation given during paralysis, with tidal volume directly influencing values of Crs obtained. The results of this study suggest that values of Crs obtained during spontaneous breathing and paralysis should not be used interchangeably until further studies have been performed to assess factors influencing Crs during controlled ventilation.\r"

In one group of six patients (warmed group) heat loss was minimized during surgery and in the recovery period by warming fresh gases, i.v. fluids and wrapping the exposed parts of the body with a warming blanket. In a second group of six patients (cold group), routine care was provided. General anaesthesia consisted of thiopentone, tubocurarine and halothane in both groups. Urinary excretion of urea nitrogen and 3-methylhistidine (3-MeH) after surgery was significantly lower in the warmed group compared with the cold group (P less than 0.05). There was little effect of normothermia on amino acid concentrations in plasma after surgery. Muscle glutamine concentration 4 days after surgery decreased by 50% in the cold group and 18% in the warmed group. Total body potassium (TBK), measured as an index of body cell mass, decreased significantly after surgery in both groups. However, 7 days after surgery the reduction in TBK in the cold group remained significantly lower than that of the warmed group (P less than 0.05). Maintenance of normothermia during hip surgery appeared to attenuate, but not eliminate, protein breakdown and nitrogen loss after surgery.\r"

To assess the interactive effects of these agents on cerebral blood flow (CBF), we have measured CBF by 14C-iodoantipyrine autoradiography, in normocapnic rats receiving either 0.5 or 1.0 MAC of volatile agent alone (halothane or isoflurane) or 0.5 MAC of volatile agent + 0.5 MAC nitrous oxide. CBF (global and regional) was significantly greater at 1.0 MAC compared with 0.5 MAC, regardless of how 1.0 MAC was achieved (agent alone or agent + nitrous oxide) (P less than 0.05). The addition of 0.5 MAC nitrous oxide to 0.5 MAC halothane resulted in flows similar to those produced by 1.0 MAC halothane alone. In contrast, the addition of nitrous oxide to 0.5 MAC isoflurane resulted in flow values significantly greater than those measured during 1.0 MAC isoflurane alone. We conclude that the use of nitrous oxide, as opposed to an increased dose of volatile agent, has no advantage in respect of minimizing anaesthetic-induced increases in cerebral blood flow.\r"

We have investigated the interaction between pharmacologically induced hypotension and distraction on feline spinal cord function. Twelve anaesthetized cats were subjected to hypotension (mean arterial pressure (MAP) 60 mm Hg) using a mixture of sodium nitroprusside and trimetaphan (1:5). No significant changes were observed in somatosensory evoked potentials recorded at T11. In six cats distraction was applied at L2-3 in 2.5-mm increments up to 1 cm, while MAP was maintained at 100 mm Hg (normotensive group). The remaining cats were subjected to the same distraction procedure at an MAP of 60 mm Hg (hypotensive group). In the hypotensive group, a reduction in amplitude of evoked response occurred at significantly less distraction than in the normotensive group. These data indicate that the feline spinal cord is more sensitive to spinal distraction under hypotensive conditions.\r"

We have evaluated the interaction between diltiazem and the inhalation anaesthetics halothane and isoflurane on sinus automaticity in the isolated right atrium (SAIRA). Isoflurane significantly reduced atrial rate at all concentrations tested. However, halothane produced only a small but significant decrease at the higher concentrations used (1-2 v/v%). Diltiazem modified the maximal negative chronotropic response to inhalation anaesthetics. Maximum depression of SAIRA was significantly greater in the presence of two different doses of diltiazem compared with exposure to halothane and isoflurane alone. These results suggest that inhalation anaesthetics may block the influx of extracellular calcium through voltage-dependent calcium channels inhibited by diltiazem.\r"

Significantly stronger reactions to SLS were found during the winter than the summer as indicated by visual scoring and by measurements of transepidermal water loss, whereas no significant seasonal variation was found in the response to nonanoic acid. A decreased hydration state of the epidermis of unexposed skin was found during the winter, and we believe this to be responsible for the increased susceptibility to SLS during this season.\r"

Five patients were treated with dihydralazine before volume expansion and five after volume expansion. Before treatment all patients had a low pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP), low cardiac index (CI) and high systemic vascular resistance (SVR). Following volume expansion the PCWP and CI increased, the SVR decreased but the blood pressure (BP) was unchanged. Administration of dihydralazine following volume expansion led to a decrease in PCWP, an increase in CI and a decrease in SVR and BP. Dihydralazine alone caused an increase in heart rate, PCWP, and CI, and a decrease in SVR and BP. Volume expansion, by increasing CI and decreasing SVR, may be of therapeutic benefit in the severely hypertensive pregnant patient with a low cardiac index.\r"

Stroke volume increased 13% after delivery of the placenta and remained elevated until the end of the operation at which time cardiac output was 11% above pre-operative values. Stroke volume and cardiac output fell during the first postoperative day. Heart rate remained elevated at pre-operative values for 48 h after delivery. There was a fall in heart rate and cardiac output between the second and the sixth days after delivery. By 2 weeks after delivery cardiac output was 28% lower than pre-operative values.

The highest mortality (51.7 per 1000) was found in the group of 1430 infants born after maternal referral during pregnancy to a specialist obstetrician. The perinatal mortality in the group selected during pregnancy as low-risk cases was very low (2.3 per 1000). The caesarean section rate in the total group was 1.4% and 0.4% in the selected low-risk group. Of the 5985 infants born alive under sole care of a midwife, 3.8% were admitted to hospital. Emergency admission because of birth asphyxia occurred in 0.4%. Convulsions within 48 h of birth at term occurred in seven (0.9 per 1000) in the total group and in five infants born in the selected group (0.8 per 1000). Selection of pregnant women into groups with high and with low risk is possible with the relatively modest means available to the midwife.\r"

Asymmetrical growth retardation was diagnosed in 16 fetuses by a head to abdominal circumference ratio above the 95th centile. In the 15 fetuses with symmetrical growth retardation, the distribution of cardiac output was normal. The mean and maximum velocity of blood flow in the pulmonary artery and aorta were similar to values in normal fetuses, and there was a greater calculated output from the right heart than from the left. The right heart flow expressed as a percentage of the combined cardiac output was not statistically significantly different from that in normal fetuses. In contrast, all 16 fetuses with asymmetrical growth retardation had a higher mean and maximum velocity in the aorta than in the pulmonary artery. The calculated volume flow from each side of the heart showed a greater output from the left than the right heart in 15. The right heart flow expressed as a percentage of the combined cardiac output was statistically different from the value in normal fetuses. These findings are consistent with theories of the redistribution of fetal blood flow, where cerebral blood flow is preferentially 'spared'.\r"

There were 12 associated deaths, not all attributable to the procedure, a mortality rate of 4.8 per 100,000; 8 major complications (3.2 per 100,000) required laparotomy or admission to hospital. In a follow-up survey of 84,940 responders to a questionnaire only 90 pregnancies (0.1%) were reported to have been conceived after the cycle of surgery. The results suggest that the rapid 'no exposure' technique as used in this series is safe and acceptable in an Indian context. If others could acquire this skill it could with appropriate adaptation make appreciable inroads into the unmet need for female sterilization in many other developing countries.\r"

A large loop of thin wire forms a diathermy electrode that allows deep excision of the transformation zone with minimal tissue damage. The tissue removed can be examined histologically. The technique was used to investigate and treat 111 women with abnormal smears referred to the Bristol Royal Infirmary during 1986. Microinvasive disease was revealed in one woman where it was not suspected by cytology or colposcopic examination. Of 102 women followed up for at least 1 year by cytology, colposcopy and, where appropriate, histology, two women were found to have residual/recurrent cervical intraepithelial neoplasia.\r"

Repeat cytology identified as severe dyskaryosis all those with large CIN III lesions. Lesion size has been neglected in studies of the natural history of CIN and in the assessment of cytological screening, but offers an explanation for the apparent discrepancies between cytological, colposcopic and histological assessment of progression of CIN.\r"

  ".W": "A special colposcopy clinic was established at the Royal Free Hospital to investigate women whose referral smears showed mild dyskaryosis. Of 200 women in the study, 66 (33%) had histologically proven CIN II or CIN III, 59 (29%) had CIN I or human papillomavirus changes, and 54 (27%) were considered normal. These findings demonstrate the importance of adequate diagnosis of this group of women. Of 143 women who had had a single mildly dyskaryotic smear, 45 (31%) had either CIN II or III. Age was not useful for predicting which women were at high risk of significant disease. Careful repeat cervical cytology correlated closely with the histological grade of the lesion. Repeat cytology was associated with an overall 24% false-negative rate, but most missed lesions were of low grade. Repeat cytology correctly identified 82% of all CIN lesions, and 93% of the most significant lesions (CIN II and III). Women who have a mildly dyskaryotic smear followed by a negative smear should not be considered normal, but careful repeat cytology can be considered a reasonably safe practice.\r"

Three had Turner's syndrome, four a surgical menopause, one a chemotherapy-induced menopause and 21 had idiopathic premature ovarian failure. All donated oocytes were fertilized with frozen-thawed spermatozoa from the recipient's partner, and the resulting zygotes were frozen until transfer had been arranged. Overall, 19 women had intrauterine embryo transfer (ET) and a mean of 2.7 (SD 0.9) embryos were transferred on 20 occasions; 10 women underwent zygote intrafallopian transfer (ZIFT) and a mean of 3.5 (SD 0.5) zygotes were transferred on 10 occasions. Both groups were matched for age. The pregnancy rate per transfer was 20% in the ET group and 40% in the ZIFT group. After excluding the 10 women in the ET group who had fewer than three embryos transferred, the pregnancy rates were similar in the two groups, 30% in the ET group and 40% in the ZIFT group. Cryopreserved embryos may be used for ovum donation to preserve anonymity and still show a high pregnancy rate of at least 30% per transfer.\r"

In the 51 nerves tested common findings were hyperaesthesia (88%), dysaesthesia (53%) and pain pressure at the nerve exit (75%); hypoaesthesia was rare (6%). A prerequisite for an operation was a positive result of a block with local anaesthesia. Good to excellent results of an operative approach, usually transection of the nerve, were noted after 39 procedures (76%). Some improvement was reported after six procedures whereas the operation had no effect in six others. A probable cause of the neuralgia could be found in only six women. Ilioinguinal nerve entrapment should be considered early in the differential diagnosis of lower abdominal and pelvic pain.\r"

The importance of each item to a mother's satisfaction was then rated by a sample of 224 similar women. The same questionnaire was also completed by 28 midwives and 52 obstetricians. The items rated most important concerned the explanation of procedures and the involvement of mothers in administering or choosing them. Second was support from the presence of a partner and qualified hospital staff, third the physical comfort of the postnatal ward. The avoidance of obstetric interventions, such as episiotomy or use of forceps, was less important than the presence of these other features. The mean ranking given to each item by the midwives and obstetricians correlated very highly with that given by the mothers; those caring for obstetric patients are much more sensitive to their preferences than is popularly believed. There was no evidence that midwives perceived patients' needs more accurately than did the obstetricians. Discrepancies between the three groups' ranking of specific items may reflect the defence of their respective roles by each profession.\r"

The prevalence of systemic hypertension was 60.5% in those with glaucoma and 66.6% with ocular hypertension. The prevalence of hyperlipidaemia was 38.1% in those with glaucoma and 37.5% in those with ocular hypertension. These findings were compared with those from a carefully age-sex matched group of patients presenting with a retinal vein occlusion without evidence of glaucoma or ocular hypertension. There were no statistical differences between any of the groups (52.2% had systemic hypertension and 28.8% had hyperlipidaemia). There was also a strikingly high prevalence of systemic hypertension (89%) and hyperlipidaemia (55.5%) in nine of the patients who had evidence of a recurrent retinal vein occlusion associated with glaucoma, and these prevalence rates were strikingly similar to the rates in patients with recurrence but without glaucoma. The data suggest that glaucoma or ocular hypertension has a less prominent aetiological role in the development of a retinal vein occlusion than underlying medical causes and that full medical assessment is worthwhile.\r"
