Ten exclusively breast-fed infants served as controls for the first four months of the study. All infants were studied at 2 weeks, 2 months, and 4 months of age for anthropometric development, biochemical values, and bone mineral content. There were no differences among the three groups in weight, length, or head circumference gains. Serum levels of calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, copper, 25-hydroxycholecalciferol, and alkaline phosphatase were also similar. However, at 4 months of age, the breast-fed group had a higher plasma zinc level than both formula-fed groups, and at 2 and 4 months of age, it had higher bone mineral content and bone density.\r"

Overall, 9.2% of white, 13.4% of black, and 9.2% of Hispanic children weighed less than 2500 g at birth. The mean prevalence of low L/A during the first two years of life was 10.4%, 12.0%, and 11.7% for whites, blacks, and Hispanics, respectively; the mean proportion of L/A less than the fifth percentile attributable to LBW was 28.9%, 27.6%, and 21.3%. Our results demonstrate the need to consider the LBW prevalence in population estimates of malnutrition since 20% to 40% of the prevalence of low L/A in the first two years of life can be attributable to LBW.\r"

Obese children are defined as those with triceps skinfolds greater than or equal to the 85th percentile of children of the same age and sex in 1963 to 1970. Superobese children are those with skinfolds greater than or equal to the 95th percentile. Compared with skinfold data from the 1963 to 1965 National Health Examination Survey, cycle 2, skinfold data from the second National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, conducted from 1976 to 1980, indicate a 54% increase in the prevalence of obesity among children 6 to 11 years old and a 98% increase in the prevalence of superobesity. Compared with skinfold data from the 1966 to 1970 National Health Examination Survey, cycle 3, skinfold data from the second National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey indicate a 39% increase in the prevalence of obesity among children 12 to 17 years old and a 64% increase in the prevalence of superobesity. Increases occurred among children of all ages and both sexes and for both blacks and whites. Blood pressure data from the four surveys suggest that the share of pediatric hypertension associated with obesity has increased. Such rapid increases in obesity indicate that environmental causes are likely responsible.\r"

  ".W": "To examine the effects of \"low-dose\" cranial irradiation on growth and to determine if one can predict patients in whom growth will be most affected, we studied 47 children with acute lymphocytic leukemia who had been treated with 2400 rad (24 Gy), 1800 rad (18 Gy), or no whole-brain irradiation. Serial measurements of height, weight, and weight for height were obtained by retrospective chart review. The effects of 1800 rad (18 Gy) and 2400 rad (24 Gy) treatment were indistinguishable. Height percentiles among irradiated patients decreased by a mean of 12% six months after diagnosis, and growth generally did not catch up. Moreover, although 33 irradiated patients maintained heights within the normal range, In 11 patients (33%) a dramatic falloff occurred such that by three years following diagnosis their height for age was more than 30 percentiles below the original value. These patients were all identifiable at six months since their height percentiles had already decreased by more than 15%. Although weight percentiles did not change following irradiation, the weight-for-height ratio increased and patients were relatively stockier three years after therapy than they had been at diagnosis. In patients who had received chemotherapy alone, the weight-for-height ratio also increased, but this appeared to be due to a disproportionate increase in weight. Longer follow-up and evaluation of larger cohorts of patients treated with 1800 rad (18 Gy) will be needed to confirm these results.\r"

We determined hourly ICGH during 24 hours in 67 children and calculated the 12- and 24-hour values. Nineteen children had normal stature, 13 had classic growth hormone deficiency, four had growth hormone neurosecretory dysfunction, 23 had short stature but no hormonal abnormality could be diagnosed, and eight had miscellaneous disorders. There was a close correlation between the 12- and the 24-hour ICGH. For diagnostic purposes, 12-hour nighttime ICGH is as useful as 24-hour ICGH. Use of the shorter test for determination of physiologic growth hormone secretion will save the patients time, expense, and blood volume.\r"

Growth hormone, thyrotropin, gonadotropins, cortisol, and prolactin levels were sampled over two hours. All patients with appropriate predicted adult heights, delayed bone ages, and normal growth velocities of 4.0 cm/y or greater demonstrated normal pituitary responses. Two of 12 patients with predicted heights 2.5 SDs lower than target height and normal growth velocity demonstrated isolated growth hormone deficiency. Nine of 11 patients had a pathologic growth hormone deficiency or panhypopituitarism. Evaluation of pituitary function by combined sequential hormonal stimulation is fruitful in children with pathologic growth patterns but not in children with normal growth velocities and normal predicted adult height.\r"

  ".W": "Cross-sectional studies from our institutions (Wyler Children's Hospital, Chicago, and Children's Hospital of Philadelphia) and others have shown that plasma somatomedin-C (Sm-C) concentrations rise during puberty. To determine the relationship between rising plasma Sm-C levels and the growth spurt at puberty, we undertook a longitudinal study of 11- to 18-year-old children. Twelve male and eight female subjects were followed up on a yearly basis for two to seven years (mean, 4.4 years). Height velocity, plasma Sm-C concentrations, and stage of sexual development were determined during each visit. All patients progressed normally in puberty during the study. The plasma Sm-C level rose during early puberty in each child and reached a maximal level of at least 2 U/mL In midpuberty, approximately one year after the attainment of peak height velocity. Maximal plasma concentrations of Sm-C were similar in male (3.5 +/- 0.71, mean +/- SEM) and female (3.5 +/- 1.46) subjects. Plasma Sm-C levels subsequently decreased slowly but remained above normal adult values for as long as four years after peak height velocity was reached. Plasma Sm-C concentrations increased steadily with increasing height velocity until peak height velocity was attained with a mean rise of approximately 0.5 U for each centimeter per year increase in height velocity. Since Sm-C levels remained elevated while height velocity decreased, there was no significant correlation between Sm-C levels and height velocity throughout puberty. These results suggest that caution is required in interpreting Sm-C concentrations during puberty; while normal pubertal levels may be in the acromegalic range for adults, a plasma Sm-C level of less than 1 U/mL in early puberty or less than 1.5 U/mL during middle to late puberty must be considered subnormal.\r"

We also created a set of correction tables to be used with these curves to permit the calculation of an adjusted height percentile that compensates for the effects of the differing rates of pubertal maturation. These adjusted height percentiles should remain more constant throughout puberty than height percentiles obtained from traditional growth curves; they may thus be used to estimate final adult height with only data obtained during routine physical examinations, by assuming that subjects maintain their adjusted height percentile through adolescence to adulthood. Height predictions made in this manner compare favorably with predictions made using two clinically tested algorithms.\r"

Choroid plexus hemorrhage and brain calcification had been misdiagnosed as IVH in two infants and in two other infants, IVH was not evident at autopsy. Eleven infants (46%) had choroid plexus hemorrhage. Twenty-two infants (92%) had additional cerebral abnormalities: periventricular leukomalacia, brainstem necrosis, hydrocephalus, or cerebellar necrosis. This study demonstrates that IVH is rarely an isolated abnormality in the preterm infant brain. The associated brain lesions should be considered in attempts to prevent or treat IVH and their presence should be suspected during clinical assessment of survivors.\r"

Late calls (greater than 30 minutes) were significantly associated with higher hospital referral rates when compared with earlier calls in children younger than 5 years (4.6% vs 1.8%) and adults (33% vs 15%). Ipecac was available in 59% of the homes of callers with children younger than 5 years. Hospital referrals were significantly less common among children who had ipecac at home (1%) compared with children who did not (3%). While the availability of ipecac was similar among callers and a matched sample of households who previously called the poison center (58%), ipecac was much less frequently available (24%) among households whose members had not previously called the center. These data infer that educating the public to call the poison center promptly may result in reduction of hospital referrals. Poison education efforts should be targeted to populations with low ipecac availability and low utilization of the poison center.\r"

  ".W": "We reviewed the medical records of nine infants with severe bronchopulmonary dysplasia and gastroesophageal reflux who underwent fundoplication-gastrostomy surgery. All the infants were born prematurely, required preoperative mechanical ventilation, and were failing to thrive. The operative procedure was well tolerated by all the infants. Seven patients were extubated by day 11, and two patients required long-term ventilation. There were two postoperative deaths, both attributed to acute respiratory deterioration followed by cardiorespiratory failure. The postsurgical respiratory response was observed to be a rapid decrease in oxygen requirements and an absence of further aspiration episodes. A mean decrease of 0.14 in fractional inspired oxygen concentration was noted by 30 days postoperatively, and by 180 days the decrease in fractional inspired oxygen concentration was 0.22. All infants were fed by gastrostomy by postoperative day 4, with no evidence of clinical reflux. The nutritional response was noted to be an increase in growth velocity with increasing age (ie, catch-up growth) and ease of feeding. At both 30 and 180 days postoperatively, the mean growth velocity was more than double the preoperative growth velocity. In addition, ease of postoperative feeding reduced the nursing care requirements and allowed earlier discharge from hospital. Fundoplication and gastrostomy is effective in facilitating growth and feeding in addition to decreasing oxygen requirements in infants with severe bronchopulmonary dysplasia and gastroesophageal reflux.\r"

All microcephalic subjects were of normal height, with the exception of one. The head volume was measured directly in at least one adult microcephalic member from five of the six families, and lower values were obtained in these subjects than in control subjects. Psychometric tests were performed on seven children and five adults among the microcephalic subjects. Normal values were found for all but one of the subjects. In the selected families microcephaly seems to be inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. Because some families showing autosomal dominant microcephaly have normal intelligence, psychometric evaluation of microcephalic children and their microcephalic relatives is important for genetic counseling.\r"

Forty-three patients had total plasma carnitine values below 20 mumol/L and an additional eight patients had total values above 20 mumol/L but had low free plasma carnitine levels. The clinical presentation in the patients with total plasma carnitine deficiency included hypotonia (34 of 43), failure to thrive (27 of 43), recurrent infections (27 of 43), encephalopathy (six of 43), nonketotic hypoglycemia (seven of 43), and cardiomyopathy (nine of 43). Of the eight patients with low free and elevated esterified carnitine levels, the signs and symptoms at presentation included hypotonia (six of eight), recurrent infections (six of eight), failure to thrive (six of eight), encephalopathy (three of eight), nonketotic hypoglycemia (one of eight), and cardiomyopathy (one of eight). All patients were treated with L-carnitine. Treatment time varied from one month to 24 months (average, four months). A subjective improvement in muscle tone was seen in 24 of 38 patients, 22 of 33 patients showed acceleration of incremental growth, and infection frequency appeared to decrease in 18 of 33 patients. After therapy, the echocardiograms of all patients with cardiomyopathy normalized. There were no further hypoglycemic episodes. Of the nine patients with encephalopathy, eight showed improvement in their mental status. Three patients died of complications of their primary disorder. In our experience, secondary plasma carnitine deficiency is a common pediatric finding. The presence of failure to thrive, recurrent infections, hypotonia, encephalopathy, cardiomyopathy, or nonketotic hypoglycemia requires investigation of carnitine status.\r"

Five hundred seven questionnaires were mailed, and 292 physicians (58%) responded. One hundred eight (37%) reported performing pelvic examinations without a chaperone present. This was usually done because of patient preference. There was no difference between academic and private practice physicians. There were many categories listed as necessitating the presence of a chaperone. Here again, patient preference was the most frequent. Other reasons for using a chaperone included a patient with emotional problems, a history of rape or sexual abuse, a seductive patient, an uncomfortable patient or physician, a first pelvic examination, and medicolegal issues. Although it has been traditionally recommended that a chaperone be present during a pelvic examination, our data suggest that this is not sometimes the case for about one third of the male physicians in the Society for Adolescent Medicine.\r"

Sixty percent ranked the experience as one of the most difficult in their lives; 56% believed that the infant's death was averted only because they intervened. The psychodynamics are similar to those seen in families who have lost an infant to sudden infant death syndrome, and they are consistent with post-traumatic stress disorder. The affected infants may be regarded as \"vulnerable children.\" Many parents believed that their lives were permanently changed. Home apnea monitoring equipment and support from the family physician and monitoring program are important in reducing the stress associated with apneic emergencies.\r"

Chronic digestive complaints decreased from 27% to 5% of the sample over the study period: constipation from 16% to 3%, chronic diarrhea from 8% to 1%, and abdominal pain from 5% to 1%. Excessive fluid intake (1470 +/- 600 vs 840 +/- 300 mL/d) correlated most strongly for seven children at 22 months experiencing alternating symptoms of chronic diarrhea and constipation or abdominal pain. Many other children tolerated dietary extremes without complaint. All macronutrient categories except dietary fiber intake increased over the study period. Thus, excessive fluid intake may provoke symptoms suggesting the irritable bowel syndrome in a susceptible group of younger children. Failure to increase fiber intake from 22 to 40 months of age leaves children on an immature diet whose effects require further study.\r"

A handwashing break in technique was defined as not washing your hands after direct contact with either patients or support equipment before contact with another patient or departure from the unit. Ninety-four two-hour sessions were monitored by a research nurse during four cross-over periods of gown and no-gown use. Physicians did not wash their hands in 834 (79%) of 1056 contacts, nurses in 1073 (63%) of 1714 cases, occupational therapists in 21 (62%) of 34 cases, respiratory therapists in 269 (78%) of 346 cases, and radiology technicians in 59 (78%) of 76 cases. Nurses used significantly better technique when compared with physicians, respiratory therapists, and radiology technicians. Gown usage overall did not affect these breaks in handwashing technique rates. Physicians did not wash their hands 75% of the time when gowns were not used and 82% of the time when gowns were used. Handwashing rates were unaffected by gown use in all other professionals. Handwashing remains an important but neglected method of interrupting the transmission of hospital pathogens.\r"

Increased urinary thromboxane B2 levels were detected coincidently with the initial signs of necrotizing enterocolitis, and values paralleled the course of the illness. Infants with serious illnesses other than necrotizing enterocolitis had increased urinary thromboxane B2 levels but with lower values than those of infants with necrotizing enterocolitis. Indomethacin therapy appeared to reduce urinary thromboxane B2 levels and reduce their usefulness as a marker of illness. Another product of platelet activation, beta-thromboglobulin, was increased in the urine of infants with necrotizing enterocolitis. Decreased platelet counts in infants with necrotizing enterocolitis correlated inversely with urinary thromboxane. Results of beta-thromboglobulin and platelet studies are consistent with the concept that platelet consumption due to ischemic thrombosis was the source of enhanced thromboxane excretion.\r"

Factors including age, sex, race, and manner of death are examined as well as psychological, sociological, familial, and other environmental influences related to the deaths. In our series, the older white male adolescent dominated the statistics by far, and the most frequent mode of death was by firearm injury to the head. A brief discussion of studies related to suicide in general, and especially to adolescent suicide, is included.\r"

Essentially, one deals with an older white male population, although all age groups can be affected. Members of the population studied frequently died from drowning alone, rather than from additional contributory causes. Most were sober and frequently without drugs detected. Most incidents occurred at home or in a canal, with the victim just \"found floating\". A note was absent approximately half the time. The reason for the act was depression concerning poor health, death of a loved one, financial problems, chronic pain, or being \"tired of life\". A discussion ensues about the approach a forensic scientist should have concerning such cases.\r"

Seventeen had attempted resuscitation with catecholamines and defibrillation; the remainder did not. Sections of myocardium were graded by two observers. For controls, brain-dead heart donors otherwise disease-free and essentially untreated with either defibrillation or beta-active catecholamines were used. Defibrillation alone and catecholamines alone each produced equal amounts of destruction, but using these together resulted in a statistically significant increase in tissue destruction. This suggests that the damaging effects of these agents are synergistic, not additive.\r"

We examined the relationship between the degree of coronary atherosclerosis and the presence of a diagonal earlobe crease in 800 consecutive autopsies performed for medicolegal reasons and thus including a wide spectrum of subjects. Statistical analysis by the chi 2 test demonstrated a positive correlation (p less than 0.01) between the presence of the diagonal earlobe crease and obstructive coronary atherosclerosis narrowing on at least one major coronary artery greater than 75%. We conclude that the autopsy findings support the clinical observations that the diagonal earlobe crease is a cutaneous sign of obstructive coronary atherosclerosis and that the sign should be used accordingly.\r"

It was compared to esophageal perfusion with 0.1 N HCl and saline and intravenous administration of 10 mg edrophonium. Continuous esophageal manometric recordings were performed at the time of testing. The patients' symptoms were monitored every minute. The effect of these solutions and edrophonium on lower esophageal sphincter (LES) pressure and amplitude of esophageal contractions was also evaluated. Esophageal perfusion with hypertonic glucose, saline, or acid had no significant effect on LES pressure or amplitude of esophageal contractions in most patients. Edrophonium, however, resulted in a significant rise in the amplitude of esophageal contractions and the LES pressure in all groups studied. Hypertonic glucose resulted in chest pain in 13.6% of patients with noncardiac chest pain and 20% of those with esophagitis, whereas edrophonium reproduced the pain in 38.7 and 37%, respectively. Our results indicate that hypertonic glucose is not effective as a provocative test for noncardiac chest pain nor does it contribute to the chest pain in esophagitis. They also had no significant effect on the amplitude of esophageal contractions or LES pressure. Edrophonium continues to be a relatively sensitive test for noncardiac chest pain.\r"

The validity of the tissue sampling was confirmed by characteristic and significant differences between gastrin concentrations at the different biopsy sites. Gastrin-releasing polypeptide levels were at their highest in the fundic and duodenal bulb compared to the antrum in controls (p less than 0.01), whereas no differences in gastrin-releasing polypeptide content of the different parts of the stomach were found in duodenal ulcer patients. Compared to controls gastrin-releasing polypeptide in duodenal ulcer patients was reduced in fundic and duodenal bulb mucosa (p less than 0.01). SS levels were highest (p less than 0.05) in the first part of duodenum in controls. Compared to controls duodenal ulcer patients had lower SS concentrations present in fundic (p less than 0.01) and highest SS concentrations present in duodenal bulb mucosa (p less than 0.01).

Four patients are described with iron-deficiency anemia in whom characteristic lesions were found at endoscopy. As in previous reports, lesions are either angioid linear streaking of the antrum with convergence at the pylorus (\"watermelon stomach\") or diffuse, well-demarcated erythematous areas. Biopsy with the electrocautery forceps may show dilated ectatic mucosal vessels often containing fibrin thrombi which will establish a diagnosis. Standard biopsy techniques failed to make a diagnosis in two of the three patients in which it was attempted. Medical therapy consisted of iron replacement and transfusion as needed. In three of the four cases, symptomatic anemia recurred and required antrectomy for management of the anemia. The antrectomy specimens revealed ectatic mucosal and submucosal vessels with a fibrotic pattern involving the lamina propria. This pattern has been previously reported. One patient was treated with corticosteroids transiently with resolution of her anemia. The endoscopic appearance of this entity may mimic antral gastritis and needs to be considered in the differential diagnosis of iron-deficiency anemia from chronic gastrointestinal blood loss.\r"

First, a more sophisticated and better-trained medical community could entertain the diagnosis readily in certain settings and had broader access to diagnostic methods that precisely defined the source of bleeding into the biliary tract. Second, there was wider use of percutaneous techniques of diagnosis and treatment of biliary diseases. Once the diagnosis of hemobilia was made by endoscopic or arteriographic means, physicians and surgeons were quicker to institute proper therapeutic measures. For this reason, the mortality associated with hemobilia decreased compared with that reported earlier. The medical community must be aware that modern treatments are now the most common cause of this problem. Since invasive diagnostic methods are increasingly used by nonsurgeons, it is imperative that these patients are studied in the context of complete consultation with surgeons who can use definitive treatments when required.\r"

Even though local anesthetics could alleviate such a problem, they are not used for fear of interfering with various manometric parameters. In this study, we evaluated the effect of topical pharyngeal local anesthesia on lower esophageal sphincter pressure, amplitude, duration, and velocity of esophageal contractions. We also studied its effects on the patient's tolerance. Esophageal motility was performed before and after topical anesthesia with 20% benzocaine. The baseline tracing and the tracing obtained after topical anesthesia were number coded and separated. They were evaluated blindly as to the pressure in the lower esophageal sphincter, amplitude, duration, and velocity of esophageal contractions. An average of 10 wet swallows was used to determine the above values. There was no significant change in the lower esophageal sphincter pressure or the amplitude of esophageal contractions after benzocaine. Similarly, there was no change in the duration or velocity of peristaltic activity. The patient's tolerance to the tube was unchanged or improved in 12 of 14 patients. Six patients had some difficulty in swallowing, but were able to compensate by sucking on the syringe. Our results indicate that topical pharyngeal anesthesia does not affect the usually measured manometric parameters; and while it may improve the patient's tolerance to the manometric catheter, it interferes with the ability to swallow.\r"

Organisms identified as S. bovis were isolated on fecal culture from 10 of 82 (12%) controls, 19 of 94 (20%) individuals with noncolonic gastrointestinal carcinoma, and 12 of 80 (15%) patients with other gastrointestinal disorders. Subjects with noncolonic gastrointestinal carcinoma did not have a fecal carriage rate of S. bovis significantly different from that in controls. A literature review of 251 patients with S. bovis septicemia identified at least 89 (35%) with neoplasms of the colon. Only nine patients (4%) with gastrointestinal neoplasms of other than colonic origin were noted. At present, the indication for an intensive evaluation of the upper gastrointestinal tract in individuals with S. bovis bacteremia is substantially less than that for the colon.\r"

Our patient underwent celiotomy with a presumptive diagnosis of insulinoma. No adenoma was found and frozen sections suggested hyperplasia. Even when Whipple's triad is met and all biochemical and roentgenographic analyses suggest insulinoma, another etiology may be the cause. Intraoperative ultrasonography may aid in the diagnosis especially after a negative exploration. The diagnosis of nesidioblastosis can be confirmed by frozen section especially if adenomatosis is present. The degree of resection required is problematic because no large series exists. This case is presented with special emphasis given to etiology, pathology, preoperative work-up, and operative strategy.\r"

Nephrosclerotic vascular lesions, however, whether arteriolar, interlobular, or glomerular and resembling focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), signify underlying hypertensive disease.

Our experience with glomerular sclerosis is limited to 28 gestations in 15 patients, but the clinical findings resemble those of women with IgA nephropathy who conceived. Finally, we analyzed 227 pregnancies in 95 women with normal renal function and reflux nephropathy comparing results to 118 gestations in 42 patients with evidence of dysfunction (serum creatinine SCr greater than 1.25 mg/dL). Women with preserved function had good outcomes in general, whereas hypertension (36%) and an accelerated decline in function (8%) were observed in the groups that had moderate renal insufficiency in the initial stage of pregnancy.

  ".U": "87210132\r", 
  ".W": "In an effort to clarify the mode of inheritance of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM), a total of 230 nuclear families with pointers were analyzed using the computer program COMBIN. Each family was ascertained without deliberate selection for multiplex families, and most families were completely typed for HLA-B, HLA-DR, and properdin factor B (Bf). There were 186 families with normal parents, 44 families with one affected parent, and no families with two affected parents. The computer program COMBIN evaluates evidence for a major locus of disease susceptibility, linkage of the major locus to a known genetic marker locus, linkage disequilibrium between the marker haplotypes and disease susceptibility, pleiotropic effects, and presence of an unlinked modifier. The parameters of COMBIN are T, Q, and D, representing the displacement, gene frequency of the IDDM allele, and dominance, respectively, of the major locus--and TM, QM, and DM being the analogous parameters of the modifier. In addition, the recombination fraction, theta, between the IDDM locus and HLA as well as the coupling frequencies are estimated. Finally, COMBIN simultaneously performs segregation and linkage analysis, with the optimal model being adjusted by the fit to the haplotype sharing distribution of IDDM. The results of these analyses indicated that the best-fitting genetic model of diabetic susceptibility appears to be a single major locus with near recessivity on a scale of standardized genetic liability, with gene frequency of the IDDM susceptibility allele of approximately 14%. In addition, the recombination fraction between the major locus and HLA is zero in all models; that is, for the B-BF-DR haplotype, the IDDM locus is tightly linked, probably (according to data from previous studies) to HLA-DR. Information determined by magnitude of coupling frequencies indicated that there is significant positive linkage disequilibrium with the haplotypes B8-BfS-DR4 and B15-BfS-DR4, significant negative linkage disequilibrium with B7-BfS-DR2, and intermediate disequilibrium for B8-BfS-DR3, B18-BfF1-DR3, and B40-BfS-DR4. Significant evidence in favor of an unlinked (to HLA) modifier (either single major locus or polygenes) could not be demonstrated. In conclusion, genetic susceptibility to IDDM appears to be most consistent with a single major locus with near recessivity that is tightly linked to HLA.\r"

  ".W": "A male infant, whose parents were first cousins, presented at 6 mo of age with hypotonia, microcephaly, and delayed development. He was found to have large amounts of fumaric and succinic acids present in the urine. In lysed cultured skin-fibroblast preparations, the activity of fumarase was found to be 22.7% of that in controls. Cell fractionation by homogenization and by digitonin treatment indicated that the residual activity in the cells of the patient was primarily located in the mitochondrial fraction rather than in the cytosolic fraction. Isoelectric focusing of fibroblast extracts showed that six bands of fumarase activity were discernible in control cell lines, two of them cytosolic with pI's of 5.53 and 5.60 and four of them mitochondrial with a pI of 5.65-6.8. In contrast, isoelectric focusing of fibroblast extracts from the fumarase-deficient patient showed only a single band of activity with a pI corresponding to the mitochondrial type seen in the controls. Immunoprecipitation of proteins with rabbit antifumarase antibody in (35S)-methionine-labeled fibroblasts indicated that a protein of correct size (Mr = 44,000 daltons) corresponding to fumarase was synthesized in similar amounts in both the patients and controls. It is proposed that in the patient's cells a single active species of fumarase that is mitochondrial in location is synthesized. Since it is known that mitochondrial and cytosolic fumarases are encoded by the same gene but differ slightly in amino acid sequence, it is possible that a point mutation might explain these findings.\r"

The estimation of the variants' relative mobility at three pH allowed us to distinguish three fast-moving variants (Gent, Vanves, and Reading) and five slow-moving variants (Sondrio, Roma, Christchurch, Lille, and B) in the French population. The frequency of alloalbuminemia in this population is .0004 and is characterized by the high occurrence of albumin B and of the two proalbumin variants, Christchurch and Lille. In order to classify the variants of European origin, the methodology that we developed, owing to its more resolutive possibilities, should be employed as a first step in their identification until establishment of a structural nomenclature making mention of the amino acid substitution characterizing each variant.\r"

This finding implies that the two types of polymorphisms describe variation at the same locus. The plasminogen gene was mapped to chromosomal bands 6q26-q27 using somatic-cell hybrids and in situ hybridization. Linkage disequilibrium between protein and DNA polymorphisms has utility in substituting for protein typing in instances where only DNA samples are available, such as from deceased individuals or extinct species. The technique may be useful when cross-hybridizing sequences make the interpretation of Southern blot patterns difficult and may obviate the need for extensive DNA sequencing. In some cases, disequilibrium may provide information useful for determining the appropriate direction for chromosome walks from a marker locus to a target locus.\r"

Southern transfer analysis using a 0.9-kb genomic fragment encompassing the first exon of the human MBP gene reveals this polymorphism with at least nine restriction enzymes, indicating that insertion, deletion, or both is the basis for the DNA length variation. Double restriction-enzyme digest analysis suggests that this polymorphism is within the region 0.5-2.0 kb upstream of the coding region of the first exon of the human MBP gene. Eleven different allelic RFLPs were identified, differing in size by as many as 450 bp. The distribution of insertion/deletion-size variants from this region is bimodal, with most restriction fragments varying in size over a 0.1-kb range. Pedigree analysis of polymorphism at this site in one three-generation family shows Mendelian assortment of parental haplotypes. The form and frequency of polymorphism generated by this site is similar to that reported for human DNA regions comprised of homologous short tandem repeats.\r"

We found no significant differences in means of growth percentiles and IQ scores between Hartnup and control groups (but all low academic performance scores were found in the Hartnup group, and various skin lesions occurred in five Hartnup subjects), no significant difference between means of the summed plasma values for amino acids affected by the Hartnup gene in Hartnup and control groups, two Hartnup subjects with clinical manifestations--impaired somatic growth and IQ in one, impaired growth and a \"pellagrin\" episode in the other--who had the lowest summed plasma amino acid values in the Hartnup group; the corresponding values for their sibs were the low outliers in the control group, and two tissue-specific forms of the Hartnup (transport) phenotype: renal and intestinal involvement (15 families) and renal involvement alone (one family), both forms having been inherited as autosomal recessives (the symptomatic probands had the usual form). Whereas deficient activity of the \"Hartnup\" transport system is monogenic, the associated plasma amino acid value (measured genotype) is polygenic. The latter describes the parameter of homeostasis and liability to disease. Cause of Hartnup disease is multifactorial.\r"

Criteria for hypopigmentation included the presence of type I or II skin, the lightest skin type in the family by history, and iris translucency on globe transillumination. On the basis of these criteria, 48% of the PWS individuals were hypopigmented. The presence of hypopigmentation correlated with a small interstitial deletion on the proximal long arm of chromosome 15; however, this deletion was also found in individuals who did not meet the full criteria for hypopigmentation. Hairbulb tyrosinase activity and glutathione content, as well as urine cysteinyldopa excretion, were low in PWS individuals with and without hypopigmentation and did not separate these two groups. We conclude that hypopigmentation is found in a significant proportion of individuals with PWS and that the hypopigmentation may be associated with a deletion of the long arm of chromosome 15. The mechanism for the hypopigmentation is unknown.\r"

There was strong evidence of familial aggregation of this progressive dental disease, and the best-fitting model was an autosomal recessive model. Because of the rather limited age range for expression of the disease in this situation, simulations were done, in a model-choice analysis using samples of this size, to assess the chance of mistaking an autosomal dominant disease (with masking of the affected phenotype outside a specified age range) for an autosomal recessive disease. While the rate of Type II error was fairly high (40%) when competing models in these simulations were compared, these data suggest that it is reasonable to infer that juvenile periodontitis is an autosomal recessive disorder.\r"

Twenty of the 33 (61 percent) patients evaluated had increases in serum theophylline levels by a mean value of 10.5 micrograms/ml. In 30 percent of patients who experienced increases, theophylline concentrations were in the toxic range. This occurred more frequently in elderly patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

The acute evaluations were performed within 24 hours of admission (n = 13), whereas the convalescent evaluations were performed at the end of therapy (n = 7). Serum and urine concentrations of ciprofloxacin were measured using high-performance liquid chromatography. Peak serum concentration (Cmax), terminal elimination half-life (t1/2 beta), apparent total body clearance (CL/f), and apparent volume of distribution (Vd/f) of ciprofloxacin were 5.97 +/- 2.95 mg/liter, 5.31 +/- 2.00 hours, 8.12 +/- 3.83 ml/kg/minute, and 3.63 +/- 1.91 liters/kg during the period of acute illness. Cmax and Vd/f values were moderately increased during the convalescent phase (8.56 +/- 3.43 mg/liter versus 5.87 +/- 2.25 mg/liter, p = 0.138, and 5.95 +/- 3.23 liters/kg versus 3.46 +/- 1.40 liters/kg, 0.05 less than p less than 0.1). The CL/f and t1/2 beta (four to 12 hours) values, however, were not significantly altered. The observed pharmacokinetic characteristics, which are consistent with those derived from single-dose studies in healthy elderly subjects, are markedly different from previous observations in young adult volunteers. However, acute illness does not alter the pharmacokinetics of ciprofloxacin in the elderly. Dosage alterations because of the presence of acute illness in the elderly do not appear to be warranted.\r"

Identification of a bacterial etiology as the cause of specific exacerbations should be based on changes in clinical symptoms and documentation of significant bronchial bacterial flora and a neutrophilic inflammatory response. Most acute bacterial exacerbations in patients with bronchitis or asthma are caused by Hemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, or Branhamella catarrhalis. Treatment with ampicillins, synthetic tetracyclines, or trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole is successful in 80 to 90 percent of bacterial exacerbations. Emergence of resistant Hemophilus species and pneumococci motivates development of new orally administered antimicrobial drugs. Appropriate treatment depends on the prompt recognition that bacterial infection is present. Once instituted, antimicrobial therapy should be continued for a minimum of 10 to 14 days, which should increase the duration of the infection-free period until the next bacterial exacerbation. Adequate response should be evaluated by the return of symptoms to pre-infectious levels and by decreased sputum bacterial flora and neutrophilic inflammation.\r"

Ciprofloxacin and vancomycin were also effective anti-staphylococcal drugs (MIC of ciprofloxacin for 90 percent of the strains was 0.5 microgram/ml and of vancomycin was 1.0 microgram/ml). Ciprofloxacin had a more rapid bactericidal effect against staphylococci than did vancomycin. Neither vancomycin nor ciprofloxacin alone had useful bactericidal activity against enterococci. Streptococci were only marginally susceptible to ciprofloxacin (MIC for 90 percent of the strains was 1.0 to 4.0 micrograms/ml for different species). Vancomycin was superior to ciprofloxacin in its anti-streptococcal activity (MIC for 90 percent of the strains was 0.25 to 0.5 microgram/ml). The promising in vitro anti-staphylococcal activity of ciprofloxacin deserves further consideration in clinical trials.\r"

Intravenous infusions of 200 mg over one-half hour result in peak serum concentrations of 3.80 +/- 0.62 micrograms/ml. Dose-ranging studies have revealed a linear increase in the area under the concentration-time curve in the range from 25 to 200 mg. The terminal elimination half-life is four to five hours in normal subjects. Serum clearance in normal subjects averages 23.7 +/- 5.1 liters/hour/1.73 m2, with renal clearance accounting for 66.6 +/- 11.0 percent of the total serum clearance. The renal clearance is far in excess of the glomerular filtration rate, and administration of probenecid decreases the observed renal clearance. Hence, net tubular secretion contributes to renal clearance. There are four metabolites of ciprofloxacin, some with microbiologic activity: desethyl-ciprofloxacin (M1), sulfo-ciprofloxacin (M2), oxo-ciprofloxacin (M3), and formyl-ciprofloxacin (M4). Ciprofloxacin is excreted into bile as the parent compound. Administration of radiolabeled ciprofloxacin has revealed that 74.9 percent was recovered in the urine, as parent compound plus metabolites, with 14 percent of the radiolabel recovered in the feces. Multiple-dosing studies carried out with doses ranging from 25 to 200 mg administered twice daily for a week have shown rapid attainment of steady state and no accumulation. Renal dysfunction causes a decrease in serum clearance, with anephric volunteers having a clearance approximately 50 percent of that of normal subjects. A maximal dose reduction of 50 percent should be initiated when creatinine clearance is reduced to 20 to 30 ml/minute/1.73 m2. Because of the variability in the drug's terminal half-life in patients with renal impairment, the reduced dose should be given on an every-12-hour schedule.\r"

  ".W": "With increasing numbers of patients covered under diagnostic-related group or prospective payment systems, there is mounting pressure to reduce the costs associated with caring for patients while maintaining the quality of care. New, broad-spectrum, parenteral antimicrobial agents are a prime target for cost control. The availability of an orally administered drug that is effective in a variety of serious infections would have a significant impact on cost reduction in hospitals. A significant proportion of the cost of parenteral drug therapy is associated with labor, supplies, and equipment. An orally administered drug would obviate these costs. Additionally, iatrogenic problems associated with parenteral therapy (e.g., phlebitis) would be avoided, the quantities of expensive parenteral drugs purchased might be reduced, and the duration of hospitalization for selected diseases such as osteomyelitis would probably decrease. Finally, the ease of oral administration may allow longer courses of therapy for resistant infections than have heretofore been possible. Oral ciprofloxacin and similar compounds present both opportunities and challenges for pharmacists. The fiscal impact may be beneficial for the hospital in terms of cost reductions for drug purchases and in expediting discharge for prolonged courses of outpatient therapy. The magnitude of cost reductions will vary substantially depending upon the types of patients and infections managed in a given institution. The challenge for pharmacists is to assure that these valuable compounds, as well as all antimicrobial agents, are appropriately utilized to avoid the offsetting costs of adverse effects, superinfection, unnecessary use, and the development of resistance.\r"

  ".W": "Decisions concerning antibiotic administration in the treatment of serious hospital-associated infections present important cost considerations and opportunities for the prescribing physician. There tend to be three distinct stages of therapy for such infections and, especially in the latter two stages, cost containment is enabled by close monitoring of mode, level, and frequency of antibiotic dosing. The first stage of therapy typically lasts about three days, during which time uncertainty exists about what is the cause of the infection. Therapy is given empirically, often with the combination of an aminoglycoside and a beta-lactam antibiotic. The second stage begins about the fourth day, at which time definitive microbiologic and clinical data are available that should allow for streamlining of antibiotic therapy, usually from combination therapy to more cost-effective monotherapy. Unfortunately, even when new data indicate that single, inexpensive therapy is possible, physicians often continue with the initial, expensive empiric drugs. It is at this stage in the patient's hospital stay that routine assessment of antibiotic management would offer the first chance to reduce hospital antibiotic costs without compromising clinical outcome. The third stage of therapy typically begins around the seventh day, when the patient is usually clinically stable and afebrile. At this point, often the only reason for continued hospitalization is so that treatment with parenteral antibiotics may continue. In many of these patients, however, therapy can be switched from the parenteral to the oral drug mode, and thus they can be treated on an outpatient basis. Streamlining antibiotic therapy by changing modes and frequency of administration represents a major step toward effective, responsible cost containment.\r"

  ".W": "The post-antibiotic suppressive effect (PAE) of different antibacterial agents against gram-positive bacteria has been known since the 1940s. Recently, it has been demonstrated that quinolone antimicrobial agents exert a PAE against gram-negative bacteria. In this study, the PAEs of ciprofloxacin against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Serratia marcescens, Staphylococcus aureus, and Streptococcus faecalis were determined. The differences in PAE determined by three different techniques--filtration, centrifugation, and dilution--were assessed for S. aureus and E. coli. Ciprofloxacin had a PAE by all three methods, and filtration was used in the majority of studies. A ciprofloxacin concentration of 3 micrograms/ml in Mueller-Hinton broth, pH 7.4, with two hours of exposure produced a PAE of three to four hours for gram-negative bacilli, and 1.9 hours for S. aureus, but had no effect on S. faecalis. Exposure of organisms in urine to 300 micrograms/ml of ciprofloxacin for two hours produced a two- to six-hour PAE for E. coli, S. marcescens, P. aeruginosa, and K. pneumoniae. Use of Mueller-Hinton broth with a magnesium concentration of 8 mM, pH 5.5, yielded similar results. Using human serum, a four-hour PAE was found for P. aeruginosa. There was a progressive increase in the PAE as the duration of ciprofloxacin exposure was increased from 0.9 hours to three hours. Increasing the ciprofloxacin concentration from two to eight times the minimal bactericidal concentration (MBC) for P. aeruginosa or from four to 16 times the MBC for E. coli did not cause a significant difference in the PAE using a two-hour exposure. Overall, ciprofloxacin produced an excellent PAE for most gram-negative bacteria and for S. aureus, but not for S. faecalis. A PAE caused by ciprofloxacin can be demonstrated in broth supplemented with magnesium, in urine, in serum, and in broth with the pH adjusted to an acidic level and with the increased magnesium concentration found in urine. These results support less frequent dosing programs for ciprofloxacin in the treatment of tissue and urinary infections.\r"

  ".W": "Animal models of infection are very useful tools for identifying those situations in which antibacterial drugs, including the quinolones, may play special roles, i.e., for positioning a drug correctly for its role in the treatment of human disease. Ciprofloxacin has been studied extensively in discriminative animal models of infection, and its efficacy in the treatment of these infections has been compared with that of standard therapy. In a rabbit model of staphylococcal endocarditis, ciprofloxacin was as effective as nafcillin alone, as well as nafcillin and gentamicin in combination, in treating rabbits with methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus endocarditis. Additionally, its activity was equal to that of vancomycin in reducing vegetation titers in rabbits with methicillin-resistant staphylococcal endocarditis. In a rabbit model of pseudomonal meningitis, ciprofloxacin was as effective as the combination of ceftazidime and tobramycin in lowering bacterial titers. However, in this model, serum levels of ciprofloxacin (6 micrograms/ml) necessary to achieve a bactericidal effect in the cerebrospinal fluid were slightly higher than levels targeted for humans. In a model of pseudomonal pneumonia in neutropenic guinea pigs, the efficacy of ciprofloxacin was compared with that of tobramycin and ceftazidime, both alone and in combination: ciprofloxacin was as effective in lowering bacterial counts as was the combination of ceftazidime plus tobramycin and its activity was superior to that of either drug alone. Thus, data from studies of ciprofloxacin in the treatment of endocarditis, meningitis, and pneumonia in animal models of infection suggest that this quinolone may play an important role in the therapy of these difficult-to-manage infections in humans.\r"

There was no significant difference in the results of therapy with rifampin compared with the results obtained with the combination of vancomycin plus rifampin. The combination of ciprofloxacin plus rifampin was the most effective regimen for the treatment of MRSA experimental osteomyelitis and the results of therapy were significantly (p less than 0.01) superior to those following treatment with rifampin alone or the combination of vancomycin and rifampin. Following cessation of antimicrobial therapy, significant (p less than 0.01) regrowth of MRSA in bone occurred in animals treated with rifampin alone or ciprofloxacin plus rifampin.

Serum concentrations were determined by high-pressure liquid chromatography, and urine samples were assayed microbiologically. The peak serum concentrations and the total areas under the serum concentration curves increased in proportion to the size of the oral dose. The pharmacokinetics of ciprofloxacin were described by a dose-independent linear relationship. The apparent oral bioavailability was 85 percent, based on comparison of the total areas under the serum concentration curves of the 100-mg dose. The serum concentrations during steady state were not significantly higher than after the first dose. The serum half-life ranged from 3.0 to 3.4 hours after the oral doses, and was 2.9 hours after the intravenous dose. The elimination-phase apparent distribution volume coefficient, delta d,area, was 2.76 liters/kg, and the total body clearance was 42.0 liters/hour.

Although no primary cardiac or parenchymal lung disease was identified, right heart catheterization revealed marked pulmonary hypertension. The patient was presumed to have pulmonary arteritis. Evaluation of her hyperproteinemia, however, led to the discovery of a polyclonal gammopathy with a marked increase in plasma viscosity. Although the classic clinical findings of the hyperviscosity syndrome were minimal, the patient underwent plasmapheresis, resulting in a marked reduction of pulmonary artery pressures (from 53 +/- 4 mm Hg, mean +/- SD, to 30 +/- 3 mm Hg, p less than 0.05) and pulmonary vascular resistance (from 707 +/- 63 dynes/second/cm5 to 421 +/- 72 dynes/second/cm5, p less than 0.05) concomitant with a return to normal plasma viscosity. Her dyspnea completely resolved. This represents the first successful treatment of pulmonary hypertension by plasmapheresis. Protein evaluation revealed the presence of intermediate complexes of IgG rheumatoid factor. The hyperviscosity syndrome should be considered in the differential diagnosis of pulmonary hypertension in patients with rheumatoid arthritis and other disorders associated with a polyclonal or monoclonal gammopathy. Pulmonary hypertension secondary to the hyperviscosity syndrome is reversible by plasmapheresis. Immunosuppressive therapy that reduces immunoglobulin production may provide a means of long-term treatment.\r"

Periods of observation ranged from two to 25 years (mean, 14.5 years). The analysis focused on clinical evaluation at age 18 years and included information gained at an earlier age. Evaluation at age 18 years was based on Shwachman and Kulczycki's (S-K) scoring system, Brasfield chest roentgenographic scoring system, pulmonary function measurements, height-adjusted weight percentile, sputum bacteriologic results, number of hospitalizations for treatment of pulmonary infections prior to the age of 18 years, time of onset of clubbing, and frequency of complications. There were no significant differences between the sexes in clinical features. Median survival from the time of diagnosis to the conclusion of the study period (1955 to 1984) was 22 years for females and 25 years for males (NS). Median length of survival beyond the age of 18 years was eight years for females and 12 years for males (NS). Stepwise logistic regression and Cox regression analysis applied to 11 variables identified the S-K clinical score at 18 years of age as the best predictor of survival to the age of 23 years. The median durations of survival after the age of 18 years for patients with clinical scores of 30 to 49, 50 to 64, and 65 to 75 at age 18 were five, seven and a half, and 12 years, respectively (p less than 0.0001). Low clinical score, low weight percentile, and Pseudomonas cepacia colonization of the lower respiratory tract at the age of 18 years indicated a poor prognosis. On the other hand, high clinical score, good weight percentile, and colonization with Staphylococcus aureus alone were likely to be found in patients with mild disease and an increased likelihood of long-term survival with preserved pancreatic function.\r"

  ".W": "Both mitral valve prolapse (MVP) and panic attacks have been reported to be associated with autonomic dysfunction, but previous studies have been limited by the lack of clear separation between patients with MVP and those with panic attacks and the use of noncomparable control subjects. Accordingly, heart rate and blood pressure responses to deep breathing, five minutes' quiet standing, and the Valsalva maneuver were studied in age- and cardiac symptom-matched groups of 33 control subjects, 66 patients with MVP, 20 patients with panic attacks, and 17 patients with both MVP and panic attacks. Compared with control subjects, patients with MVP exhibited more syncope (13 of 66, or 20 percent, versus none of 33, or 0 percent; p less than 0.01), more orthostatic hypotension during quiet standing (11 of 66, or 17 percent, versus one of 33, or 3 percent; p less than 0.01), loss of the normal decrease with age in vagally-mediated heart rate variability during deep breathing (r = 0.13, p = NS versus r = -0.44, p = 0.01), and lower 24-hour epinephrine excretion (6.1 +/- 0.7 versus 11.0 +/- 2.7 micrograms; p less than 0.01). In contrast, patients with panic attacks had greater increases than control subjects or patients with MVP without panic attacks in heart rate, mean blood pressure, and the product of heart rate and mean blood pressure during each minute of quiet standing and during the early strain phase of the Valsalva maneuver. These findings indicate that autonomic dysfunction occurs both in patients with MVP and in those with panic attacks in comparison with symptomatic control subjects, but that the patterns of abnormality differ. Patients with MVP exhibit decreased effectiveness of responses to orthostatic stress, reduced epinephrine excretion, and abnormal vagal tone, whereas patients with panic attacks have heightened cardiovascular responses to postural and positive intrathoracic pressure stresses.\r"

Seven patients had eight episodes of nosocomial pneumonia caused by gram-negative bacilli. Twenty-five episodes of community-acquired bacteremia and nine episodes of nosocomial bacteremia were associated with specific sites of infection. Other infections included meningitis (two), urinary tract infection (one), and abscesses involving subcutaneous and deep tissues (12). Sixteen patients had recurrent infections; 11 of these had or eventually had AIDS. Community-acquired bacterial infections in patients with AIDS or AIDS-related complex are common and may be recurrent but have low fatality rates. In comparison, nosocomial bacterial infections occur primarily in patients with AIDS and have high fatality rates.\r"

Sixty-eight histologically confirmed cases of Toxoplasma encephalitis were reported by investigators at 31 medical centers; 61 of the patients received some therapy. Overall prognosis was poor. The median survival following initiation of therapy was four months. Patients described as \"alert\" at initiation of therapy survived significantly longer than those described as \"lethargic\" or \"stuporous.\" No beneficial or harmful effects could be attributed to the use of corticosteroids. Toxicity attributed to pyrimethamine and sulfonamide therapy was reported in 60 percent of patients. Leukopenia, rash, and thrombocytopenia were common during therapy. A clinical relapse of Toxoplasma encephalitis was reported in 50 percent of patients discharged from the hospital.\r"

Nineteen infectious events occurred in 38 patients with 39 biliary devices. Infections consisted of bacteremia, cholangitis with and without documented bacteribilia, and intrahepatic abscesses and were frequently associated with obstruction (66.7 percent of infectious episodes). The most frequent organisms isolated from blood were Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and the most frequent organisms isolated from bile were P. aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Streptococcus faecalis. Trends for more frequent occurrence of neoplasms involving the gallbladder or biliary tract, recent surgical procedures and catheter manipulations in infected as compared with noninfected patients, and a delayed time to infection were noted in patients with an endoprosthesis.\r"

Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis was diagnosed by strict histologic criteria in 103 patients. Exclusion of patients with follow-up of less than 12 months reduced the number to 93 (55 adults and 38 children). Mean length of follow-up from the time of biopsy was 61 months. Ninety percent of children, but only 33 percent of adults received treatment with steroids, with or without cytotoxic drugs (p less than 0.001). Complete remission, defined as daily proteinuria of less than 250 mg, was not different in adults (39 percent) from that in children (44 percent), with a mean remission duration for all patients of 38 months. Chronic renal insufficiency, defined as a creatinine clearance of less than 0.8 ml/second/1.73 m2 for more than 12 months, was similar in adults (40 percent) and children (34 percent). Five-year renal actuarial survival, defined as the absence of chronic renal insufficiency, was 96 percent for patients with a history of complete remission, and 55 percent for those without (p less than 0.0002). Logistic regression analysis showed treatment to be the only significant factor for complete remission (p less than 0.001). Complete remission, in turn, was important for renal preservation, defined as the absence of chronic renal insufficiency (p less than 0.001). Age did not affect the treatment response or long-term renal outcome in focal segmental glomerulosclerosis. yet, the percent of adults treated was much lower than that of children, despite the fact that the majority of the untreated adults had the same clinical parameters as the treated adults and children. Thus, a judicious course of treatment is as much indicated in adults as in children with this disorder.\r"

  ".W": "The natural course of renal function in patients with cirrhosis and ascites but without azotemia is unclear. Therefore, a prospective evaluation of 23 non-azotemic cirrhotic patients with ascites was carried out over a three-year interval. Assessment included evaluation of serum electrolyte values, liver function tests, plasma renin levels, and parathyroid hormone levels. Renal function was determined by measurement of clearances of water and solute excretion, and simultaneous clearances of para-amino hippurate, inulin, and creatinine. The initial mean glomerular filtration rate was 66 ml/minute, serum creatinine level was 1.1 mg/dl, and blood urea nitrogen value was 13 mg/dl. The glomerular filtration rate showed marked variability among patients. On the basis of initial glomerular filtration rate, the patients were divided into three groups. Group I consisted of patients with supranormal filtration rates (mean 183 ml/minute), Group II constituted patients with normal filtration rates (mean 92 ml/minute), and Group III comprised patients with severely impaired filtration rates (mean 32 ml/minute). The serum creatinine level was below 1.5 mg/dl in all three groups. Serial measurement of renal function was performed in 18 patients over a mean of 310 days (range four to 1,176 days). Eighty-six percent of patients studied from Groups I and II maintained a normal or supranormal glomerular filtration rate over one year. However, most patients in Group III showed a progressive decline in filtration rate, despite no change in serum creatinine value. Sixty-seven percent of Group III patients died over a mean of one year. The mean 24-hour solute excretion among Group III patients was only 263 mOsm per day, significantly less than the control value of 874 mOsm per day in other hospitalized non-cirrhotic patients. The serum creatinine level frequently failed to rise above normal even when the glomerular filtration rate was very low (less than 25 ml/minute), and creatinine clearance overestimated inulin clearance by a factor of two in Group III patients. However, the creatinine index was an aid in determining true glomerular filtration rate and may be a useful clinical test in the evaluation of renal insufficiency in cirrhotic patients with normal serum creatinine values. Many patients with cirrhosis and ascites will have a glomerular filtration rate of less than 60 ml/minute but a normal serum creatinine level. These patients may constitute a previously unrecognized large group.\r"

The severity of Paget's disease and cardiac valvular lesions was graded on a scale of 0 to 3, with 3 as the most severe. Two control cases were obtained for each case of Paget's disease. Each was the case either immediately before or after the Paget's case, and was matched for age, race, sex, and extent of autopsy. The incidences of moderate (10.9 percent) and severe (5.4 percent) calcific aortic valve disease were both fourfold greater than in the control group (chi-square analysis, p less than 0.01 and p less than 0.05, respectively). Additionally, the frequency of advancing grades of calcific aortic valve disease was greater in more advanced stages of Paget's disease. In fact, there was a dose-response effect of Paget's disease upon calcific aortic valve disease (trend analysis for proportion, p less than 0.01). These data therefore support the hypothesis that Paget's disease is associated with calcific aortic valve disease in a dose-response manner.\r"

Available information on adequate therapeutic doses and potential toxicity is, however, very fragmentary. This report describes a phase I study of one of the most promising bisphosphonates currently available, aminohydroxypropylidene bisphosphonate (AHPrBP or APD), in tumor-associated hypercalcemia. Only patients remaining hypercalcemic after 48 hours of rehydration were evaluated, and antineoplastic therapy was delayed at least until a normal serum calcium level was reached. AHPrBP was given as two-hour daily infusions for three days, and three different patients were treated at each of the six following dosage levels: 0.01, 0.05, 0.25, 0.75, 1.5, and 3.0 mg/kg per day. The two lowest dosages levels were insufficient to normalize serum and urinary calcium levels, but the efficacy of the four other dosages was very similar. Plasma immunoreactive parathyroid hormone levels increased as a function of calcium levels, whereas urinary hydroxyproline levels did not prove to be a very useful measure of AHPrBP's effects on bone resorption. The drug was generally very well tolerated: only six patients had transient fever and/or decreases in lymphocyte count that were not clearly related to AHPrBP dosage. The only real problem was observed at the highest dosage of 3.0 mg/kg per day in an obese woman in whom high fever and hypotension developed. Efficacy and tolerance in dehydrated patients were verified by treating seven other patients, not previously rehydrated, at 1.0 mg/kg per day for three days. In summary, the therapeutic range of AHPrBP, given for three days as a two-hour infusion daily, lies between 0.25 and 1.5 mg/kg per day. Fasting urinary calcium levels are probably the most reliable and easily measured parameter to monitor AHPrBP's inhibition of bone resorption in normocalcemic patients.\r"

In men with previous myocardial infarction, previous stroke, or current large-vessel peripheral arterial disease, geometric mean serum IgE levels were increased 119 percent, 164 percent, and 78 percent, respectively. These associations were statistically significant (p less than 0.05). Because IgE was positively or inversely correlated with several traditional cardiovascular disease risk factors, logistic regression was used to evaluate the independent association of IgE with any cardiovascular disease (myocardial infarction, stroke, or large-vessel peripheral arterial disease). In a model including age, cigarette smoking, fasting plasma glucose level, diastolic blood pressure, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level as covariates, IgE was positively and independently associated with any cardiovascular disease (p = 0.03). Similar evaluations in women revealed no correlation between IgE and cardiovascular disease by either univariate or multivariable analysis. These data indicate that IgE may be an independent marker for cardiovascular disease in men, and thus suggest IgE-mediated events may play a role in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease.\r"

Since left ventricular hypertrophy may be an important determinant of outcome in hypertension, the long-term effects of arterial vasodilation with hydralazine on left ventricular mass and function were compared with those of an alternative third-line drug, the alpha1 blocker prazosin, in patients still hypertensive despite combined diuretic and beta blocker therapy. A single-blind, randomized, two-group parallel design was employed. Both treatments induced a sustained antihypertensive effect, with hydralazine showing more effect on supine blood pressure, and prazosin having more effect on standing pressure. Heart rate, cardiac output, and volume status showed only minor changes. Plasma norepinephrine showed a sustained increase when measured in both the supine and standing positions, but the increases were similar for the two treatments. Supine and standing plasma renin activity increased only during long-term treatment with hydralazine. Prazosin induced a progressive decrease in left ventricular mass over time (-34 +/- 15 g/m2 at 12 months), but hydralazine did not (-9 +/- 10 g/m2 after 12 months). Stepwise regression indicated that a decrease in systolic blood pressure was associated with a decrease in left ventricular mass with both treatments, but an increase in plasma norepinephrine was associated with an increase in left ventricular mass only with hydralazine, suggesting that increased sympathetic activity may affect left ventricular mass via cardiac alpha1 receptors. Thus, if regression of left ventricular hypertrophy is a worthwhile therapeutic goal, hydralazine and analogous arterial vasodilators are not drugs of choice.\r"

In the absence of adrenergic blockade, fetal heart rate during high-voltage slow activity was significantly higher than that during low-voltage fast activity. Propranolol (2.0 mg/hr) produced a decrease in fetal heart rate, but the decrease was only statistically significant during high-voltage slow activity. Phentolamine (5.0 mg/hr) induced a significant increase in fetal heart rate with a small but statistically significant decrease in mean arterial pressure. The cyclic variability in fetal heart rate between low-voltage fast activity and high-voltage slow activity was abolished by propranolol and enhanced by phentolamine. These results indicate that the cyclic variability in the fetal heart rate associated with electrocortical activity can be accounted for by cyclic fluctuation in sympathetic activity.\r"

Cardiac output, organ blood flows, and vascular resistances, measured with radioactive-labeled microspheres, were compared in three groups: carbohydrate-supplemented (hypertensive) term-pregnant rats, control-fed (normotensive) term-pregnant rats, and control-fed (hypertensive) nonpregnant rats. Blood pressure remained elevated in the carbohydrate-supplemented pregnant rats because the normal decrease in total peripheral resistance did not occur. There were no significant differences in organ blood flows between hypertensive and normotensive pregnant rats, with the exception of a 26% lower placental blood flow in the hypertensive versus the normotensive rats. Carbohydrate overfeeding was associated with reduced litter size but did not affect fetal growth. Both placental blood flow and litter size were inversely related to mean arterial blood pressure at term. This may be a useful model of essential hypertension during pregnancy.\r"

These gave serum nicotine levels of 72.3 +/- 6.6 ng/ml and 315 +/- 32 ng/ml (mean +/- SEM), respectively. During low-dose nicotine infusion there was no significant change in cardiac output, its distribution, or uteroplacental blood flow. During high-dose nicotine infusion, cardiac output fell from 257.8 +/- 30.9 ml/min to 212.7 +/- 19.3 ml/min (p less than 0.05) and uteroplacental blood flow fell from 31.2 +/- 3.1 ml/min to 22.3 +/- 2.4 ml/min (p less than 0.05). During control, low-dose, and high-dose periods, serum epinephrine levels rose from control value of 60.2 +/- 2.6 to 98.9 +/- 35 and 1200 +/- 295 pg/ml (p less than 0.05 low dose versus high dose) and serum norepinephrine levels did not change significantly during nicotine infusion. Hence at nicotine levels 20 times but not at two to five times those seen in smokers, modest reductions in cardiac output and uteroplacental blood flow were observed.\r"

In striking contrast to the pale, washed-out appearance in autoradiographs of most cerebral, cerebellar, and brain stem structures was a relatively high density of entorhinal cortex, hippocampus, lateral olfactory tract, and olfactory bulbs. Local cerebral glucose utilization of most gray and white matter structures was elevated in one ketamine-treated fetus experiencing a marked drop in PO2 during the study.\r"

Peritoneal macrophages from normal patients exhibited diminished cell membrane capping function as compared with that of endometriosis-related macrophages or blood monocytes. On the basis of these findings, a hypothesis is formulated suggesting that endometriosis is associated with an increased influx of macrophages that are allowed to undergo further maturation-activation. The resultant population of large macrophages may contribute to the maintenance of the disease or associated infertility.\r"

All of these women demonstrated a late rise in serum levels of major basic protein characterized by an increase in concentration of 156% +/- 14%. A temporal association between a rise in concentrations of major basic protein and the onset of preterm labor, which was successfully treated with tocolytic agents, was observed in three patients. Increases in major basic protein began 3 to 4 weeks before delivery. The rise in levels of major basic protein was absent in one patient who was delivered of her infant at 30 weeks' gestation after induction of labor with oxytocin. Analysis of these data indicate that a protein marker is associated with the onset of human labor not only at term but also preterm.\r"

Clinical manifestations usually appeared 24 to 48 hours after the patient was admitted and varied from mild respiratory distress to pulmonary failure in three; these three required tracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation. We found no evidence that pulmonary edema was caused by intravenous fluid overload. Oxygen therapy and ventilation were given to maintain the arterial PO2 at 80 mm Hg or greater, and erythrocyte transfusions were given to six women to correct anemia. Women with pulmonary injury were more likely to have multisystem derangement than a control group without respiratory involvement, but there were no clinical risk factors that were predictive at admission. This syndrome was probably caused by permeability pulmonary edema, likely mediated by endotoxin-induced alveolar-capillary membrane injury since other evidence of endotoxemia was common. Thrombocytopenia, hemolysis, intravascular coagulation, renal dysfunction, and transient cardiomegaly concomitant with hyperdynamic ventricular function are all explicable from endotoxin effects.\r"

Segments of rabbit carotid artery were perfused for 3 hours with nutrient medium to which serum from normal pregnant women or patients with preeclampsia was added. After perfusion, ring segments of the vessels were cut and mounted in muscle chambers for force measurement. Sensitivity of the vessels to constrictor agents and endothelium-mediated relaxation was studied. The results indicate that arteries exposed to serum from preeclamptic patients developed a 2.9-fold increase in sensitivity to angiotensin II, 1.6-fold increased sensitivity to norepinephrine, and no change of sensitivity to serotonin. These effects were not accompanied by changes in isometric force. Endothelium-mediated relaxation was not affected by serum from preeclamptic patients. These findings confirm clinical observations of increased angiotensin II sensitivity in preeclampsia. The system used may facilitate identification of factors that cause the difference between the sera of normal pregnant women and those with preeclampsia.\r"

Arterial blood pressure was significantly lower in the pregnant animal (p = 0.0135). An infusion of serotonin, which failed to alter the blood pressure, pulse, or uterine artery flow velocity, significantly increased the pressor response to angiotensin II infused at 3.5, 7.5, 14.5, and 29 ng/kg/min in both the pregnant (p = 0.0001) and, to a lesser degree, the nonpregnant animal (p = 0.004). Pretreatment with indomethacin heightened the angiotensin pressor effect significantly in the pregnant group (p = 0.0001) and to a near-significant degree in the nonpregnant group (p = 0.074). However, indomethacin enhanced the angiotensin II-serotonin synergism only in the pregnant animal (p = 0.0008). The angiotensin II-serotonin synergism persisted after pretreatment with the sympathetic blocking agent bretylium tosylate. We concluded that serotonin augments the pressor effect of angiotensin II in the pregnant and nonpregnant guinea pig; however, this synergism is potentiated by the inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis only in the pregnant animal.\r"

Abnormal umbilical artery waveforms are defined by a systolic/diastolic ratio greater than or equal to 3 in the last 10 weeks of pregnancy. When abnormal waveforms persist, fetal growth retardation and adverse perinatal outcome are likely. Abnormal uterine artery waveforms are also recognized by a systolic/diastolic ratio averaged from both vessels of more than 2.6 after 26 weeks. In addition, the abnormal vessel will usually contain a persistent diastolic notching. Abnormal uterine vessels strongly correlate with the presence or subsequent development of preeclampsia and fetal growth retardation. Doppler velocity flow provides valuable insights into the pathophysiology of various disease states. It provides a basis for new clinical and basic research into disease mechanisms and methods for improving perinatal and maternal morbidity.\r"

The 30 patients who met our criteria for preeclampsia were matched for age, race, and parity with normotensive control subjects. We found that in normal pregnancies, decline in blood pressure occurred before the second trimester and blood pressure remained low throughout gestation, rising insignificantly near term. Both systolic and diastolic blood pressures were significantly higher (p less than 0.05) for patients with preeclampsia than for normal control subjects beginning in the first trimester. This difference persisted throughout pregnancy and was also present at the 6-week postpartum visit (p less than 0.025).\r"

Most women feel pain predominantly in the abdominal area whereas others complain about severe back pain. In addition to the pains associated with contractions, many women report continuous low-back pain. This study used the McGill Pain Questionnaire to examine each type of pain. Women during labor also tracked their perceived pain levels at the same time that contractions were registered on cardiotachographic records. The results show that continuous low-back pain is severe and is reported by about 33% of women during labor. It is described as being qualitatively different from the pains associated with uterine contractions. The pain of contractions felt in the back is often reported as \"riding on\" the continuous low-back pain so that both together may reach \"horrible\" or \"excruciating\" intensities. Continuous low-back pain is probably caused by the distention and pressure on adjacent visceral and neural structures in the peritoneum, in contrast to the rhythmic pains that are clearly related to contractions of the uterus. It is possible that each of these major kinds of pain may be controlled by different anesthesiologic and psychologic procedures.\r"

An oral glucose tolerance test was performed before and after 6 months of treatment; glucose disappearance and insulin response curve were determined. Long-term glucose homeostasis was assessed by the estimation of the extent of glycosylation of plasma proteins and hemoglobin A1. The area under the curve for insulin and glucose did not change during treatment with any of the preparations. In addition the representative variables for long-term glucose control did not increase for any of the preparations during treatment. We conclude from these results that the low-dose pills investigated in this study do not have any adverse effects on glucose metabolism after treatment for 6 months.\r"

  ".W": "In order to evaluate the risks specifically related to arrest disorders of labor, obstetric management and perinatal outcome were studied in 5399 births selected to exclude risks clearly not caused by abnormal labor. Management was primarily medical--among patients with arrest disorders, the cesarean rate was 13% and the midforceps rate was 4%, and among those having cesarean or midforceps delivery, 96% received prior oxytocin stimulation. Perinatal outcome was assessed by the parameters of mortality, low Apgar scores, admission to the nursery intensive care unit, and neurological abnormality. With medical management, arrest disorders were not associated with an increased risk of the adverse perinatal outcome evaluated in this study. It appears possible to reduce operative rates for arrest disorders of labor safely by more extensive use of medical management.\r"

Interstitial colloid osmotic pressure was measured by the \"wick\" method and interstitial hydrostatic pressure by the \"wick-in-needle\" method in subcutaneous tissue on the thorax and ankle. From follicular to luteal phase, the following changes were observed: Colloid osmotic pressures were significantly reduced, both in plasma (mean 2.5 mm Hg) and in the interstitium (thorax mean 1.9 mm Hg and ankle mean 2.0 mm Hg). The interstitial hydrostatic pressures did not change. There were no significant changes in serum albumin, hemoglobin, or hematocrit. A slight, but significant, weight gain was observed (mean 0.7 kg). The reduced plasma and interstitial colloid osmotic pressures in the luteal phase may be due to water retention, but the observed reductions in colloid osmotic pressures are probably not fully explained by simple dilution. A reduction in total protein mass in the luteal phase is suggested.\r"

Enprofylline was shown to be a rather potent smooth muscle relaxant [inhibitory concentration that decreases response by 50% (IC50) = 3 X 10(-5) mol/L] and an almost equally potent cyclic adenosine monophosphate-dependent phosphodiesterase inhibitor (IC50 = 10(-4) mol/L), whereas it was a less potent cyclic guanosine monophosphate-dependent phosphodiesterase inhibitor. Enzyme kinetic studies revealed that enprofylline is a competitive cyclic adenosine monophosphate phosphodiesterase inhibitor. Enprofylline increased the cyclic adenosine monophosphate content in a dose-dependent way with subsequent increased activity of cyclic adenosine monophosphate-dependent protein kinase. It is suggested that enprofylline relaxes myometrial smooth muscles and that this is at least partly the result of interference with the cyclic adenosine monophosphate system.\r"

Complications of the procedure were infrequent and none required surgical treatment. Cumulative pregnancy rates among women with hysterosalpingogram-demonstrated bilateral tubal closure were similar for the one- and two-application procedures that used nonradiopaque methyl cyanoacrylate and were significantly lower (p less than 0.05) compared with a single application of radiopaque methyl cyanoacrylate. The 3-year pregnancy rate for two applications of nonradiopaque methyl cyanoacrylate was 1.7 +/- 1.2 per 100 women.\r"

In radical abdominal operations, a complete resection of parametrial tissue was the goal. Extensive lymphadenectomy of the pelvis was performed. Operative specimens were processed by giant sections comprising cervix, lateral parametria, and vaginal cuff. Lymph nodes were cut by step-serial sections. Exact measurements of tumor sizes were done along with investigations of parametrium and lymph nodes. Tumors were classified according to a ratio of tumor size to size of cervix. Incidence of lymph node involvement increased with tumor size, reaching a maximum of 68.3% in the group with a ratio from 70% to 80%. Direct spread into the parametrium was rarely found, even in larger tumors occupying the entire cervix. parametrial lymph nodes were most often involved; these were scattered over the entire ligament. Five-year survival rates reached 88.1% in patients with no nodal involvement and 60.9% with nodal involvement. In the latter, the results depended on the number of nodal groups involved and the diameter of metastases. Parametrial involvement alone had no influence on healing rates, but when pelvic nodes were simultaneously involved, the results were less satisfactory. Survival rates based on tumor size differed only between the group with a ratio up to 20% and the large-tumor groups, with rates ranging from 97.5% to 70.9%. There was no statistical difference between Stages IB (31.1% positive nodes) and IIB (44.1% positive nodes) with regard to survival rates (82.2% and 76.9%, respectively).\r"

Hysterosalpingography revealing bilateral oviductal patency was followed by hysteroscopic checkup verifying bilateral presence of P-blocks, except in three patients who had expulsion of the P-blocks on one side. All of the 22 patients had retention of the P-blocks 6 to 7 months after insertion. None became pregnant. Thus it is suggested that an intratubal device in the isthmic part of the human fallopian tube acts as an intrauterine contraceptive device, preventing intratubal and intrauterine pregnancies. Endeavors to explain the contraceptive effect of a nonocclusive intratubal device are discussed on the basis of our present knowledge of tubal physiology. Distension of part of the human isthmus is likely to disturb normal gamete transport through the isthmus.\r"

With the recent introduction of Doppler color flow mapping, in which blood flow is displayed in color superimposed on a real-time image, it has been impossible to identify flow disturbances in the pediatric and adult patient. This study was undertaken to determine whether Doppler color flow mapping could be used in the fetus to identify normal and abnormal cardiovascular anatomy. Thirty-five normal and high-risk fetuses were examined between 16 and 40 weeks of gestation. Doppler color flow mapping identified normal and abnormal anatomy (ventricular septal defect, atrial septal defect, endocardial fibroelastosis, dysplastic pulmonary valve, and tricuspid regurgitation). It appears that Doppler color flow mapping will add a new dimension to fetal cardiovascular imaging.\r"

The advantages of this technique, which may be performed eventually on outpatients with paracervical block, are: precise hemostasis; complete and controlled uterine evacuation, avoiding postoperative infections; precise histologic diagnosis; suppression of a good percentage of hysterectomies and open myomectomies; simplicity of follow-up; brevity of hospitalization and convalescence, which are sometimes nil; and conservation, or even restoration, of fertility.\r"

The capillary equivalents for the venous threshold values were calculated by regression analysis. The glucose challenge test predictions of either normal or abnormal agreed in 82%. The sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values for the capillary oral glucose tolerance test were 89%, 90%, 62%, and 98%, respectively. These capillary equivalents were then applied prospectively to 147 women undergoing a glucose challenge test and 141 women undergoing an oral glucose tolerance test. The concurrence rate of the glucose challenge test in the prospective group was 90%. The sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values for the capillary oral glucose tolerance test were 64%, 95%, 75%, and 92%. When the venous threshold recommendations of the American Diabetes Association were used instead of those standard at our institution, these values increased to 75%, 98%, 83%, and 96%, respectively. The recommended capillary values of the American Diabetes Association were 100% sensitive but had a positive predictive value of only 20%. Based on the prospective group, the cost per case of gestational diabetes identified would decline 63% if both a capillary glucose challenge test and an oral glucose tolerance test were used and 25% if the capillary glucose challenge test and venous oral glucose tolerance test were used. Combining the data set for new regression equations, the following venous-capillary threshold sets emerged: glucose challenge test, 140 mg/dl/150 mg/dl; fasting oral glucose tolerance test, 105 mg/dl/114 mg/dl; 1 hour, 190 mg/dl/211 mg/dl; 2 hours, 165 mg/dl/183 mg/dl; 3 hours, 145 mg/dl/157 mg/dl. The sensitivity, specificity, and negative predictive values for the capillary oral glucose tolerance test with these thresholds were 80%, 97%, 80%, and 97%.

  ".W": "The relationship between glycemic control and perinatal outcome was assessed in a relatively uniform population of 75 White Class B through D pregnant diabetic women. All patients used glucose reflectance meter self-monitoring and performed a minimum of four determinations daily. Mean capillary blood glucose was calculated from a minimum of 16 weeks of determinations. Regression analysis confirmed a correlation between these values and third-trimester hemoglobin A1 (p less than 0.001). The study population was divided into two groups on the basis of mean capillary blood glucose values: group I, mean capillary blood glucose less than 110 mg/dl (43 patients) (mean = 96.8 +/- 7.1); group II, mean capillary blood glucose greater than 110 mg/dl (32 patients) (mean = 126 +/- 9.0). Of the 32 patients in group II, eight had mean capillary blood glucose greater than or equal to 130 mg/dl. The degree of maternal glycemic control appeared to affect perinatal outcome. At least one form of infant morbidity was present in 33% of group I infants compared with 53% of group II. Significant differences were observed for the incidence of hypoglycemia (p less than 0.05), macrosomia (p less than 0.05), and respiratory distress syndrome (p less than 0.01). One of six group I infants delivered at 35 to 36 weeks developed respiratory distress syndrome, compared with four of seven group II patients. The appearance of phosphatidylglycerol in amniotic fluid appeared delayed in group II patients at term. These data suggest that maintaining mean capillary blood glucose values less than 110 mg/dl may serve to reduce several major forms of morbidity in the infant of the diabetic mother. This information is helpful in establishing objectives for glycemic control in pregnant women using self-monitoring techniques.\r"

The glucose infusion study group was comprised of nine healthy gravidas between 36 and 40 weeks' gestation, and six patients served as controls. The protocol design included an overnight fast for all patients. Fetal movements were evaluated by external fetal monitoring. A 2-hour preinfusion evaluation of fetal activity served as the baseline control for each patient studied. Study patients then received a glucose infusion by a glucose clamp technique to maintain a sustained hyperglycemia of 120 mg/dl for 3 hours. After the glucose infusion, fetal movements were observed for 1 hour. Control patients received a saline infusion for 2 hours after a 2-hour baseline evaluation. Maternal hyperglycemia was associated with a significant decrease of fetal movements greater than 1 second duration during the first hour of glucose infusion. Fetal movements returned to baseline during the second and third hours of glucose infusion. Saline infusion was not associated with a decrease in fetal activity. We conclude that sustained maternal hyperglycemia is associated with a transient decrease in fetal movement during the first hour of glucose infusion followed by a return to the control (preinfusion) level of fetal activity. These data may have implications in the study of fetal behavior in diabetes mellitus.\r"

This prospective study included follow-up throughout gestation of 249 normal pregnant women (129 nulliparous and 120 multiparous) with a weekly blood pressure control under the same experimental conditions. Our results demonstrate that there is only a low correlation between maternal age and diastolic blood pressure, but no correlation was found with systolic blood pressure; maternal weight gain correlates with blood pressure changes; no correlation was found between gestational age and blood pressure, although an increasing tendency in systolic and diastolic blood pressure was found toward the end of gestation; and a significant correlation was observed between birth weight and average diastolic blood pressure during the third trimester. These findings demonstrate the potential significance of the use of standard blood pressure data from normal pregnant women for the future clinical evaluation of our population.\r"

  ".W": "The obstetric performance of 50 consecutive women with minor mullerian anomalies was compared with that of 141 subjects having a normal uterine cavity on hysterosalpingography. All 191 patients had a history of some years' infertility. Spontaneous abortion was the outcome of the first pregnancy in 27.8% of women with mullerian anomalies (not statistically different from the outcome of the control group). However, the evidence of a greater risk of variously complicated first pregnancies and labors (30.3% versus 12.9%, p less than 0.05) and of emergency cesarean sections (21.2% versus 7.1%, p less than 0.05) in the group of minor mullerian anomalies than in the group with normal uteri confirmed the innate pathologic condition and clinical significance of these mild to moderate malformations present in about 40% to 50% of oligomenorrheic women. The most frequent complications were threatened abortion and abnormal fetal lie. Even the very mildest mullerian anomalies seemed to have gynecologic and obstetric implications, but the clinical impact in this group still remains uncertain. It is concluded that a genital tract anomaly of a certain obstetric significance (ratio between distance from nadir of fundal indentation to line connecting summits of uterine horns and length of this line or H/L ratio greater than 0.15) must be suspected in about one third of women with oligomenorrhea. Consequently a high risk in the event of a future pregnancy is evident, and about half the pregnancies (42.1%) in this group will be complicated in one or more ways.\r"

  ".W": "The relationship between tumor stage and the concentration of circulating heparin achieved after subcutaneous administration and its effect on fibrin generation were studied in 24 women with gynecologic malignancy. A single subcutaneous injection of 5000, 7500, and 10,000/U of sodium heparin was given in random order on different days. Plasma specimens for antithrombin III, fibrinopeptide A, and heparin were obtained serially over an 11-hour interval. Women with a Stage III or IV malignancy had significantly lower circulating heparin after the 5000 and 10,000/U doses. There was a significant decline in fibrinopeptide A as the concentration of circulating heparin increased. Thirty-three percent of women with a Stage III or IV malignancy had no detectable circulating heparin at any point examined over the 11 hours after 5000/U of heparin. Likewise, 16.7% and 8.4% had no detectable circulating heparin after 7500 and 10,000/U, respectively. A similar percentage was noted in a smaller group of women with Stage II malignancy. Next, a known quantity of heparin was added to the plasma from these patients and the concentration of heparin was determined. A significant amount of heparin-neutralizing activity was documented. We conclude that a large percentage of women with an advanced gynecologic malignancy are able to neutralize heparin administered for the prevention of thromboembolic disease. This heparin-neutralizing activity may account for the failure of low-dose heparin to prevent thromboembolic complications in this patient population.\r"

With the same technique, we added polymorphonuclear neutrophils to either the epithelial or stromal surface of the amnion. The lower compartment of the incubation chamber contained 10(-8) mol/L of N-formylmethionyl-leucylphenylalanine. Of 24 amnion tested, only one showed polymorphonuclear neutrophil permeation. Ultrastructural observations indicated that the basal lamina and the zona reticularis of the basement membrane acted as barriers to polymorphonuclear neutrophil invasion. Recent studies indicate that the basal lamina and the zona reticularis of the basement membrane contain collagen type V. No data support the existence of collagenase of polymorphonuclear neutrophil origin that cleaves collagen type V. If enzymatic degradation of extracellular matrix components play a role in polymorphonuclear neutrophil invasion, it is possible that type V collagen acts as a barrier to polymorphonuclear neutrophil invasion in the human amnion.\r"

In the case-control study, 419 pregnant women with hyperemesis gravidarum were matched on medical center, date of study registration, and race with 836 pregnant women who did not vomit during the index pregnancy. Younger age, nulliparity, and high body weight were significantly associated with increased risk of hyperemesis. Women with hyperemesis had significantly reduced risk of fetal loss; however, their infants had higher risk of central nervous system malformations. In the second study, first-trimester pregnancy hormones were measured in the serum of 35 women with hyperemesis and 35 control women who were individually matched to cases on age, parity, and medical center. After adjusting for length of gestation, mean levels of total estradiol were 26% higher and mean levels of sex hormone binding-globulin binding capacity were 37% higher in patients with hyperemesis gravidarum than in control subjects. These differences were statistically significant. Although human chorionic gonadotropin concentrations were higher in control pregnancies, the differences were not statistically significant. The average amount of estradiol that was nonprotein bound (adjusted for length of gestation) was also higher in patients than in control subjects. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that elevated estrogen levels are responsible for excessive vomiting in pregnancy.\r"

Obstetric variables responsible for the birth of 338 live in-born immature neonates in a large single perinatal center were determined. We were unable to affect 65% of these pregnancies because there was no chance for intervention prior to admission in 63% of these mothers, and 66% had nonpreventable obstetric complications responsible for delivery. The median time interval from admission to delivery was 7 hours. Mortality was significantly higher in those delivered within 7 hours. We also found that neonatal mortality was twice as high in infants born to women with a previous perinatal loss. The clinical implications of these results are discussed.\r"

Patients received a median 10 cycles of chemotherapy before chromic phosphate P 32. Disease consisted of microscopic residual only in 10 patients (43%), macroscopic residual that was completely resected in eight (35%), and macroscopic residual disease in which the largest diameter was less than 0.5 cm in five patients (22%). Ten patients are free of disease at 13 to 94 months after chromic phosphate P 32 salvage therapy. Life table survival is 75% at 2 years and 57% at 4 years, with a disease-free survival rate of 54% at 2 years and 27% at 4 years. Patients with no gross residual disease had median disease-free survival of 27 months versus 9 months for patients with macroscopic residual disease (p greater than 0.1). Only three patients (13%) developed surgical bowel complications related to chromic phosphate P 32. Compared with previous studies, intraperitoneal chromic phosphate P 32 as salvage therapy for patients with minimal residual ovarian carcinoma defined at secondary surgical evaluation results in comparable survival and fewer complications than does salvage abdominopelvic irradiation and should be considered as an option to further chemotherapy in selected patients.\r"

The significant predictors of groin node metastases in patients with superficial vulvar cancer are tumor thickness, histologic grade (proportion of undifferentiated tumor pattern), capillary-like space involvement with the tumor, clitoral or perineal location, and clinically suspicious nodes, according to the linear logistic model analysis of clinicopathologic data in 272 women. No lymph node metastases occurred in approximately one fourth of patients with a combination of low-risk factors: no clinically suspicious nodes, negative capillary-like space, and nonmidline vulvar cancers that were either grade 1 and 1 to 5 mm thick or grade 2 and 1 to 2 mm thick. In contrast, all 10 patients with clinically suspicious nodes and grade 4 tumors had positive groin nodes. The risk of lymph node metastases is best determined by simultaneous evaluation of all risk factors rather than a single factor such as tumor thickness.\r"

Medical problems were related to 16.1% of private and 14.9% of public low birth weight births. Since current prematurity prevention methods are most likely to prevent low birth weight births related to idiopathic premature labor, the relative success of such programs in reducing the rate of low birth weight births is likely to depend on the characteristics of the patient population to which the programs are directed.\r"

This study demonstrates that increased red cell turnover with heme catabolism is also common in mild preeclampsia. Heme catabolism results in equimolar production of carboxyhemoglobin, iron, and bilirubin. A concomitant rise in these constituents of venous blood would support this hypothesis. Patients with antepartum preeclampsia had mean carboxyhemoglobin concentrations (2.72% total hemoglobin) greater than those of control patients (0.65%) (p less than 0.001) and serum iron concentrations (98.5 micrograms/dl) greater than those of control patients (66.1 micrograms/dl) (p less than 0.01). Bilirubin concentrations were not different. Post partum, carboxyhemoglobin and iron concentrations returned toward normal (1.38% and 50.2 micrograms/dl, respectively). Disparity in the magnitude of increase of heme catabolites produced in equimolar proportion is explained by differences in the kinetics of clearance. The data are most consistent with increased destruction of maternal red cells, even in mild preeclampsia. Potential implications of elevated carboxyhemoglobin on maternal and fetal oxygenation are discussed.\r"

Review of medical records revealed that 67% of patients with positive hepatitis B surface antigen screens had no risk factors identifiable by routine prenatal history. Although all patients were screened on admission to the hospital, the results of the immunoassay were not available in time for staff to institute isolation procedures for the laboring mother or unwashed neonate. In 82% of the cases, treatment of neonates occurred later than 12 hours after delivery (the current Centers for Disease Control recommendation).

The study established that the magnitude of underregistration of perinatal mortality is considerable (14.3%). Underregistration at the national level is due to underreporting by physicians and not due to errors in statistical bookkeeping. Underreporting is related to birth weight, that is, viability of the infant, and immigrant status of the mother.

  ".W": "The possibility of local ovarian production of beta-endorphin prompted us to measure beta-endorphin levels in 19 follicular fluid samples obtained from normal ovaries and compare them with beta-endorphin plasma levels in 19 women with normal ovulation. beta-Endorphin was extracted through Sepharose-treated chromatography columns and assayed with a specific anti-beta-endorphin antibody. Follicular fluid beta-endorphin levels (21.3 +/- 10.8 pg/ml) were significantly higher (p less than 0.01) than the plasma levels (15.5 +/- 3.35 pg/ml). There was no significant correlation between plasma and follicular fluid beta-endorphin concentrations. Follicles greater than 1 cm in size contained more beta-endorphin than follicles less than 1 cm in size (22.7 +/- 3.5 versus 18.7 +/- 4.4 pg/ml, p less than 0.05). Five follicular fluid samples were obtained from polycystic ovaries. The mean beta-endorphin content (45.1 +/- 7.7 pg/ml) in these follicles was significantly higher than that of normal ovaries (p = 0.001). It is concluded that the ovaries produce beta-endorphin and that polycystic ovaries produce more beta-endorphin than normal ovaries.\r"

Mean pulmonary capillary pressure was within normal limits throughout pregnancy and the puerperium. Cardiac output did not increase significantly by the end of the first or second trimester but became elevated by 31% in the early third trimester. This elevation in cardiac output persisted until delivery and resulted from a comparable increase in heart rate. Stroke volume and ejection fraction did not change significantly, while peripheral vascular resistance fell, although not significantly, reaching a nadir at approximately 28 weeks of gestation. Our findings indicate that maternal cardiac output increases due to an increased heart rate and reduced afterload.\r"

When compared with fetuses with normal and less severely abnormal waveforms, there was a higher incidence of intrauterine growth retardation, pregnancy-induced hypertension, cesarean section for fetal distress, neonatal intensive care unit admission, and low Apgar scores. Average birth weight and gestational age at delivery were lower. Five other fetuses with absence of end-diastolic velocity were identified that were delivered between 27 and 30 weeks, making a total of 15 patients with absence of end-diastolic velocity. Of 12 patients monitored, 11 had an abnormal fetal heart rate pattern. Four fetuses had lethal anomalies. There were eight perinatal deaths. Acute or chronic hypoxia was evident in all fetuses with absence of end-diastolic velocity. Absent end-diastolic velocity represents a unique and severe fetal condition that cannot be identified by present surveillance methods and requires a Doppler study for diagnosis.\r"

The group with an elevated systolic/diastolic ratio had a significantly higher incidence of abnormal fetal heart rate, pregnancy-induced hypertension, oligohydramnios, cesarean section for fetal distress, and admission into the neonatal intensive care unit. One third of the newborns required intermittent positive pressure ventilation. Average birth weight and gestational age at delivery were significantly lower and there were six perinatal deaths in the group with an elevated systolic/diastolic ratio and none in the group with a normal systolic/diastolic ratio. These data suggest that the small for gestational age fetus with normal umbilical artery velocimetry is at significantly lower risk than are those with abnormal ratios. This implies that management of the small for gestational age fetus may now be aided by a functional classification based on the umbilical artery velocity waveform.\r"

Thereafter, heart rate increased further, and by the end of a 30-minute recovery period, heart rate was still 66 bpm above the control value. In fetuses pretreated with either a ganglionic blocker or a parasympathetic blocker, norepinephrine caused a large and sustained rise in heart rate by 124 bpm, which declined rapidly when the infusion was terminated. These results suggest that circulating norepinephrine affects fetal heart rate by several mechanisms: a baroreceptor-mediated suppression, a direct stimulation by norepinephrine, a gradual weakening of the vagal and an increase in cardiac sensitivity to sympathetic stimulation. In addition, there appears to be a long-term positive correlation between fetal heart rate and circulating norepinephrine levels.\r"

The virus, first detected in the placenta during initial maternal viremia, replicated after the time when maternal blood was cleared of virus, although high titers of maternal serum antibodies were present. In the last week of gestation (43 to 48 days after inoculation), the virus was detected in 95% of placentas and was present at high titers. Fetal infection first appeared on day 25 after inoculation and reached an incidence of 37% in the last week of gestation despite the presence of fetal antibody.

Adrenal glands were obtained from seven baboon fetuses at midgestation (days 100 to 105). Adrenal cells were dispersed in medium 199 with 0.2% collagenase for 10 minutes at 37 degrees C. Approximately 10(5) cells/4.0 ml of medium 199 were incubated for 24 hours at 37 degrees C with 10 nmol of adrenocorticotropic hormone or 10 nmol of ovine prolactin in the presence or absence of 10(-5) or 10(-6) mol/L of estradiol. The major steroid formed and secreted into the medium was dehydroepiandrosterone. Mean +/- standard error basal formation of dehydroepiandrosterone was 176 +/- 64 ng/10(5) cells/24 hours. Dehydroepiandrosterone formation was increased (p less than 0.05) 3.5-fold and five-fold by adrenocorticotropic hormone and prolactin, respectively. Estradiol at 10(-5) mol/L prevented the response in dehydroepiandrosterone obtained with adrenocorticotropic hormone alone. Estradiol alone had no effect on dehydroepiandrosterone. The results suggest that estrogen modulates the regulatory effects of adrenocorticotropic hormone on dehydroepiandrosterone formation by the adrenal gland of the baboon fetus.\r"

Four criteria are necessary for endocrinopathy to be present: morphologic changes, functional changes, hormonal changes, and target-tissue changes.

  ".W": "The primary source of estrogen, ovarian 17 beta-estradiol, is normally converted to estrone and estriol, both of which are metabolized to their sulfate and glucuronide forms, as well as oxidated to nonestrogens. In postmenopausal women, the primary sources of estrogen are nonovarian, including the production of androstenedione from the adrenal cortex and its metabolism to estrone by the liver, adipose tissue, skeletal muscle, kidney, brain, and hair follicles. Estrogen circulates bound to sex hormone-binding globulin and albumin. The sulfate form may be a storage form of this hormone and is freely converted back to estrone and estriol. The glucuronide and sulfate forms have limited cell penetration; they are excreted mainly in the kidney, with little tubular reabsorption. Several theories have been advanced to explain the effects of estrogens on the basis of their receptors. A consideration of pharmacologic and pharmacokinetic characteristics reveals specific advantages and disadvantages of the preparations currently available for estrogen replacement therapy. Oral agents have the disadvantage of being subject to a considerable first-pass hepatic effect, resulting in their conversion to estriol, oxidation to nonestrogens, and conjugation to sulfate and glucuronide salts. These preparations can also be associated with poor patient compliance, as can injectable, topical, or suppository preparations. On the other hand, transdermal patches are not subject to a first-pass hepatic effect, provide relatively uniform serum levels, and may help alleviate the problem of noncompliance.\r"

Estrogen effectively reduces the vasomotor, somatic, and associated psychologic components of the menopausal syndrome. Recently, however, the role of estrogen in the prevention of disease, particularly osteoporosis, urogenital atrophy, and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, has prompted consideration of this treatment for a more long-term goat. Bone loss occurring after menopause can be prevented by the use of estrogen; this significantly reduces the morbidity and mortality of associated fractures. Atrophic changes, which can occur earlier in the menopause than previously recognized, also respond to estrogen treatment. Atherosclerotic risk profiles are improved by estrogen replacement: blood pressure is lowered, total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol are reduced, and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol is increased. Most studies have found that the incidence of angina or myocardial infarction is lower in estrogen users than in nonusers, and overall mortality rates from cardiovascular disease appear to be reduced as well.\r"

Other studies indicated that the risk of endometrial malignancy is reduced when a progestogen is added to the estrogen. Not all postmenopausal women need estrogen replacement, since many are symptom free because they continue to produce endogenous estrogens. Within this group may be the women at greatest risk for adenocarcinoma of the endometrium. The progestogen challenge test was devised to identify women at greatest risk for endometrial cancer. The number of endometrial malignancies declined at Wilford Hall U.S. Air Force Medical Center with increasing use of this test from 1975 through 1983. The lowest incidence of endometrial cancer was observed in the estrogen-progestogen users (49.0 per 100,000) and was significantly lower than that found in either the unopposed estrogen users (390.6 per 100,000; p less than or equal to 0.0001) or in the untreated women (245.5 per 100,000; p less than or equal to 0.005). The incidence of breast cancer was also significantly lower in the estrogen-progestogen users (66.8 per 100,000) than in the untreated group (343.5 per 100,000) and lower than that expected from two national cancer surveys (188.3 and 229.2 per 100,000; p less than or equal to 0.01). Progestogens should be added to estrogen replacement therapy in women who have undergone a hysterectomy, as well as in those with an intact uterus.\r"

  ".W": "Several side effects and risks associated with estrogen replacement therapy are known to stem from the hormone's impact on the liver. With oral administration, the enhanced action at hepatic, as compared with nonhepatic, sites is presumably related to the so-called first-pass effect. Attempts have been made to avoid this action by administering estrogen nonorally, but heightened hepatic effects (comparable with those of other preparations) have nonetheless been seen with both ethinyl estradiol and conjugated equine estrogens given vaginally. We conducted a series of investigations aimed at evaluating the effects of estradiol delivered via a transdermal patch. In a 50-patient study of transcutaneous estradiol (25, 50, 100, or 200 micrograms/day) versus placebo, a dose-dependent beneficial effect on objectively measured hot flashes was demonstrated. A second study was designed to compare the effects of these doses with those of 0.625 and 1.25 mg conjugated equine estrogen administered orally. Effects on nonhepatic markers were similar for the 50 micrograms patch and 0.625 mg tablet, as well as for the 100 micrograms patch and 1.25 mg tablet. None of the doses of transdermal estradiol exerted any measurable action on hepatic markers of estrogen action, whereas both doses of conjugated equine estrogen demonstrated actions on both hepatic protein and lipid synthesis. Our data clearly show that the transdermal administration of estradiol circumvents the enhanced hepatic actions of the hormone. Possible explanations for these results are presented.\r"

  ".W": "The analysis of compliance with hormonal replacement therapy in postmenopausal women must take into account the physician's knowledge of and willingness to prescribe such treatment and the patient's acceptance of the risks and benefits. Studies have shown that most women receiving oral therapy take their medication only sporadically, and those who discontinue treatment usually do so because of the fear of endometrial cancer. Both physicians and patients should be made aware that the addition of progestogen can greatly lessen this risk. Estrogen therapy has been shown to offer significant benefits, notably a reduction in the incidence of osteoporosis-related fractures. Epidemiologic models can be useful in showing both physicians and patients that hormonal treatment is safe and effective. Noncompliance, stemming from side effects or the problem of forgetting to take medications, can be improved through the use of the transdermal estrogen formulation. This product has been associated with excellent tolerability; local and systemic adverse reactions have been minimal, and any problems with unscheduled bleeding or hyperplasia can be circumvented through the addition of progestogens.\r"

  ".U": "87210461\r", 
  ".W": "Five major risk factors for osteoporosis have been identified: age, initial bone density, the menopause, bioavailability of calcium, and sporadic factors. Age appears to be the major determinant of bone mass. During a lifetime, a woman will typically lose 50% of her trabecular bone and 35% of her cortical bone. Bone density is affected by the amount of bone developed during growth, as well as by the subsequent rate of loss. Strong evidence has shown that loss of ovarian function leads to an accelerated phase of bone loss. Bone turnover rates increase, but resorption occurs faster than formation. This acceleration slows with time, reaching the level of the underlying slower phase of bone loss approximately 10 years after the onset of menopause. The role of calcium intake in preventing osteoporosis remains a matter of debate. Other factors shown to affect the risk of osteoporosis include low weight, smoking, alcohol intake, and degree of physical activity. The fact that not all postmenopausal women develop osteoporosis suggests that other, as-yet-undetermined factors may play a role in this condition.\r"

  ".W": "Many studies have shown that bone loss accelerates after oophorectomy or the menopause. If estrogen replacement therapy is instituted soon after the onset of these changes, much of this bone loss, and subsequent fractures, can be prevented. Most investigations have evaluated the effects of oral estrogens, but other routes of administration may be equally beneficial. The use of estrogens natural to the human also seems preferential. Several theories have been advanced regarding the mechanism of action of estrogen in this population. The most popular concept holds that estrogen stimulates calcitonin production, but other theories also must be considered since this is controversial and far from proven. A local action of estrogen on the skeleton cannot be ruled out. In addition to estrogen, calcium supplementation and exercise may have roles to play in the prevention and management of osteoporosis.\r"

  ".W": "The authors examined paraffin sections from 85 genital tract tissues from 49 cases for the presence of human papillomavirus (HPV) Types 6/11, 16, and 18 by stringent in situ hybridization using 35S-labeled viral DNA probes, and for viral capsid antigen by the immunoperoxidase test. The cases, selected mostly on the basis of vulvar pathology, were distributed as follows: early neoplasia (Group I, 6 cases); early neoplasia with viral cytopathic effect (CE) (Group II, 24 cases); and papillomavirus infection (PVI) (Group III, 19 cases). Available tissues from all affected sites were examined when the disease was multicentric. One or more viral DNAs were identified in 58% of 77 tissues from Groups II and III and in 2 of 8 tissues from Group I. HPV-6/11, HPV-16 and HPV-18 DNAs were detected, respectively, in 25, 24, and 2 tissues; 3 tissues were infected simultaneously with either two or three viruses. Viral DNA was identified at more than one site in 14 of 30 DNA-positive patients; in 10 of these, a single type was detected at all sites in the same patient. The viral DNA was localized mostly in areas showing viral cytopathology. The presence of HPV-16 correlated with neoplasia. HPV-16 DNA was identified in the 2 virus-positive tissues showing neoplasia, in 17 of 20 (85%) of the DNA-positive tissues showing neoplasia with CE, and in 5 of 25 (20%) of the DNA-positive tissues showing PVI. Conversely, HPV-6/11 was found in 25% of the DNA-positive tissues showing neoplasia with CE and in 80% of the cases of PVI. An HPV genome was identified in neoplastic cells in 14 instances; in all but 1 case, the genome was HPV-16. The association of HPV-16 with neoplasia was seen for both vulvar and cervical lesions. Viral antigen was detected in 83% of lesions associated with HPV 6/11 and in 62% of lesions associated with HPV-16.\r"

  ".W": "The effect of repeated interactions of antibodies with cell surface antigens have been examined in in vitro, but not in in vivo systems. In this study are described the results of multiple antibody-cell surface antigen interactions in vivo. Rabbits were given repeated intravenous injections of goat antibodies to angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE), an antigen expressed on the surface of lung endothelial cells. For prevention of anaphylactic reactions, which would have been induced by multiple injections of heterologous immune or nonimmune IgG, the rabbits were made neonatally tolerant to goat IgG. Divalent immune IgG given daily for 21 days induced chronic antigenic modulation (antigen disappearance) with resistance to antibody-mediated inflammatory lesions. The rabbits, however, developed degenerative changes of alveolar endothelial and epithelial cells. Administration of immune IgG every other day for 43 days allowed partial reexpression of ACE and was associated with intravascular, but not interstitial, inflammatory changes. In contrast, repeated administration of monovalent immune Fab did not induce antigenic modulation but caused severe, lethal, interstitial pneumonitis. Thus, in this experimental model the development of acute interstitial inflammatory changes correlates with persistence of antigen and is abrogated by disappearance of antigen induced by divalent antibodies. Further, repeated endothelial antigen antibody interactions fail to induce chronic inflammatory or sclerosing lung lesions.\r"

Although the MCMV infection had little effect on the survival and development of the embryos during 3 days of cultivation, immunohistochemical analysis of their serial sections using monoclonal antibody showed MCMV-infected cells in various portions of the embryos. This monoclonal antibody, when tested with the use of infected cultured mouse fibroblasts, reacted with nuclear antigen within 2 hours after infection and also reacted with nuclear inclusions in the late phase of infection. The viral antigen-positive cells detected by the monoclonal antibody were present in almost all of the ectoplacental cone and the yolk sac and in about 82% of the embryos. In the embryos, antigen-positive cells were frequently observed in the epithelium of the digestive tracts, endothelial cells of the blood vessels, and the mesodermal cells. In some of the embryos, viral antigen-positive cells were clearly observed in a small percentage of the blood cells. These findings indicate that blood cells, in addition to cell migration during embryogenesis, may play an important role in transmission of infectious virus into the embryos. Mouse whole embryo culture infected with MCMV can provide a model for the study of cellular tropism related to congenital infection by cytomegalovirus.\r"

In all 11 tumors examined vimentin filaments were abundant. A type of plaque-bearing small cell junction, which is common in these tumors but difficult to classify by morphologic criteria, was identified by antibodies to desmoplakins as true desmosomes. These were found in all cases, although in a very variable proportion of cells. Some of these junctions were associated with vimentin IFs. In addition, 9 of the cases examined showed scattered or clustered cells expressing the simple-epithelium type cytokeratins 8 and 18. Moreover, 3 cases displayed dispersed or clustered cells producing neurofilaments. The value of these observations, notably the cell type heterogeneity, for the diagnosis of tumors of this group is discussed. The results further indicate that Ewing's tumors are derived from a primitive, pluripotential cell that may differentiate, in variable proportions, into cells with mesenchymal, epithelial, and, more rarely, even neural features, suggesting that this tumor should be regarded as a blastoma, rather than as a true sarcoma.\r"

Ethanolamine exchange activity was significantly enhanced in both neutrophils and lymphocytes from patients with active Behcet's disease, active systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), and severe bacterial infections and slightly enhanced in those from patients with active rheumatoid arthritis (RA), compared with healthy controls. No abnormal findings were found in CPT, EPT, or serine or choline base exchange activities in the leukocytes from any of the diseased groups tested or in the ethanolamine exchange activity of patients with severe viral infections and inactive SLE, RA, and Behcet's disease. The authors have recently demonstrated the enhancement of transmethylation and phospholipase A2 activity in human leukocyte membranes at the height of inflammatory disease states, as well as the activation of leukocyte ethanolamine exchange by bioactive stimulants. These data postulate that phosphatidylethanolamine synthesis by the base exchange reaction may be the precursor of transmethylation and its subsequent activation of phospholipase A2, leading to the induction of arachidonic acid cascade.\r"

These abnormalities include a pronounced loss of the intrinsic connective tissue skeletal framework around foci of myocytolytic necrosis within the non-necrotic myocardium. These changes were demonstrated by a silver impregnation technique, and they were confirmed by scanning electron microscopy. Quantitation demonstrated more than a twofold increase in the area of ventricular wall affected by pathologic changes, when the connective tissue alterations were included with the myocardial necrosis. In addition, the authors also observed focal, thick \"tethering\" connective tissue fibers at the termini of necrotic lesions, seemingly connecting them to normal muscle. These connective tissue abnormalities may contribute to the progressive loss of ventricular function that occurs in this model of cardiomyopathy. They may permit greater wall thinning than would occur with focal necrosis alone, and they may increase focal mural stiffness in the tethered regions. Further investigation of the pathogenesis of these changes and their mechanical significance is indicated.\r"

  ".W": "The vitiligo mouse C57BL/6J Ler-vit/vit is a new, murine model for vitiligo in humans. It was studied with respect to morphology and fine structure of melanocytes in hair and eyes before and during depigmentation. The coat of vitiligo mice lightens progressively with age because of an increase in the ratio of white to pigmented hairs with each molt. The bulbs of white hairs are devoid of pigment, and they lack melanocytes. In other respects the epithelium is morphologically normal as determined by light and electron microscopy. The bulbs of pigmented hairs are histologically normal. By electron microscopy, however, some of the melanocytes are shown to have undergone degenerative changes. In addition, disruption of the basement membrane underlying the melanocytes and herniation of melanocytes into dermal papillae were observed at various stages of hair growth. Papillary melanophages are prominent in pigmented as well as in white hair bulbs. Newborn vitiligo mice have no uveal pigment. Pigment appears in the iris and ciliary body by Day 4 and in the choroid by Week 3. On Day 4, along with pigmentation, conspicuous spherical amelanotic cells appear over the anterior border of the iris. These cells become numerous in the ensuing weeks and gradually acquire large melanophagosomes. They occur also in the stroma of the iris and the ciliary body, associated with necrotic melanocytes. The spherical cells are identical to the clump cells of Koganei and are far more numerous in vitiligo mice than in controls. Macroscopically, no progressive decrease in iridial pigment is apparent for the life of the vitiligo mouse. In the choroid, an amelanotic patch surrounds the optic nerve. In the pigmented areas, melanocytes show compartmentalization of melanosomes and degeneration. The retinal pigment epithelium generally appeared continuous. In older animals some epithelial cells contained large fat bodies or were devoid of melanin.\r"

  ".W": "Interactions between specific operant conditioning and ongoing treadmill walking have been characterized in several previous investigations of mechanisms that coordinate locomotion. The present study examined a higher walking velocity in which contractile forces and, by inference, reflex behavior, might be more powerful. Two subjects walked on a motor-driven treadmill at 0.90 m/sec. As in past work, at 0.45 m/sec, a conditioning regimen constructed a test operant in the following way. With training, a green light that flashed approximately 200 msec after heel strike on every third step produced, after operant reinforcement, a 100-500 msec electromyographic burst in the rectus femoris (RF) muscle before the end of a 500 msec performance duration. Reinforcement consisted of a tone that sounded after each response and indicated success or failure. Burst durations were shorter than had been typical at a lower treadmill speed, a characteristic that could favor rapid matching of contractile patterns to more rapidly changing conditions. No evidence was gained of interference from stretch reflexes or any other ongoing inborn behavior. The resulting rapid walk was as well coordinated as that seen at lower velocity, to argue for increased emphasis on the role of learning in normal locomotion and to improve pathological walking.\r"

  ".W": "To provide information on the long-debated issue of the value of psychotherapy as an addition to paraprofessional counseling services for opiate addicts receiving methadone maintenance, the authors obtained 12-month follow-up data on 93 such patients randomly assigned to a 6-month course of either paraprofessional drug counseling or counseling plus professional psychotherapy. The psychotherapy patients had a significantly better overall status at 7-month follow-up and also at 12-month follow-up, 6 months after the psychotherapy ended. The authors conclude that psychotherapy can be evaluated by using scientific methods and that it can have measurable and sustained benefits in the treatment of opiate addiction.\r"

Thirty-one (36%) of these subjects had baseline hypercortisolemia, which was significantly correlated with age, symptoms, and \"modified\" DSM-III criteria for major depressive disorder. Twenty (24%) of the 85 subjects were nonsuppressors (5 micrograms/dl) after testing; nonsuppression was significantly related to age, female sex, level of retardation, symptoms, and \"modified\" DSM-III criteria for major depressive disorder (sensitivity 41%, specificity 81%). First-order partial correlations maintained significant relationships between age and severity of retardation but not sex. Mental retardation itself did not appear to invalidate the DST.\r"

He argues that the separation of psychiatry and neurology is no longer justified. He calls instead for a carefully conceived new career path leading to specialization in clinical neuroscience and further urges that psychiatric training programs be restructured to focus on the critical examination of problem solving and validation methods.\r"

The authors compared family histories obtained independently by a research team and by PGY-3 residents on 52 consecutively admitted adult psychiatric inpatients. In contrast to the residents, the research team used a family tree, screening questions, and a structured interview based on diagnostic criteria and identified more than four times as many diagnoses in relatives as did the residents. The results demonstrate that a family history strategy derived from research methodology significantly enhances the gathering of important diagnostic information in a clinical inpatient setting.\r"

The prevalence of arrhythmias within symptomatic intervals was similar during panic, partial panic, and anxiety and was significantly higher than during asymptomatic intervals.

The authors suggest that conflictual material emerging during REM or other sleep stages may contribute to the occurrence of nocturnal attacks but is repressed on awakening.\r"

One-fourth of the victims of both male and female molesters described themselves as sexually dysfunctional, and eight of the victims of male molesters identified themselves as homosexual.

Children with separation anxiety disorder were less likely to exhibit school refusal than children with school phobia. However, they were more likely to meet criteria for an additional DSM-III diagnosis. Finally, their mothers had a rate of affective disorders four times greater than that of mothers of children with school phobia.\r"

Typical of folie a famille were the dominant family member, the threat of violence, and the family's social isolation, frequent crises, and stable membership. Although the veteran's intrusive recollections of his Vietnam experience were typical of posttraumatic stress disorder, he acted on rather than avoided them. Treatment focused on the entire family, partly to minimize future problems in the children.\r"

These results imply that clinicians need specific training to diagnose and treat psychiatric disorders in the mentally retarded patients who now use community mental health facilities, because their presentations may be atypical.\r"
