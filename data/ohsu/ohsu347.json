The clue to the diagnosis of concomitant fibromyalgia lies in the widespread distribution of the pain and in its severity. All patients with this disorder have multiple, symmetrically distributed \"tender points,\" a physical sign which is specific for fibromyalgia. Treatment includes, first, explanation. Aerobic exercise may be helpful in many patients, and administration of tricyclic compounds in very low doses is often effective in treating the associated sleep disorder and in reducing overall disease severity.\r"

HMP shunt activity and glycolysis were significantly lower in intact PMN cells of GSD Ib patients as compared with GSD Ia patients and with controls. These activities were above normal levels in disrupted GSD Ib PMN. HMP shunt activity and glycolytic rates in lymphocytes were similar in all three groups studied. The rate of 2-deoxyglucose transport into GSD Ib PMN was 30% of that into cells of normal controls. In GSD Ib lymphocytes or in GSD Ia PMN and lymphocytes transport was normal. The striking limitation of glucose transport across the cell membrane of the PMN of GSD Ib patients may account for the impairment of leukocyte function that is characteristic of GSD Ib, but not found in GSD Ia patients.\r"

Human blood monocytes cultured for 5-7 d bound apoB- and/or apoE-containing lipoproteins from different species with affinities equivalent to those demonstrated for the receptors on cultured human fibroblasts. Low density lipoproteins competed effectively and completely with 125I-beta-VLDL for binding to and degradation by monocyte-derived macrophages. Specific polyclonal antibodies to bovine apoB,E(LDL) receptors abolished both LDL and beta-VLDL uptake by normal human monocyte-macrophages. Immunoblots of monocyte-macrophage extracts with these antibodies revealed a single protein in human macrophages with an apparent molecular weight identical to that of the apoB,E(LDL) receptor found on human fibroblasts. Like receptors on cultured human fibroblasts, the apoB,E(LDL) receptors on monocyte-macrophages responsible for 125I-beta-VLDL and 125I-LDL uptake were efficiently down regulated by preincubation of the cells with beta-VLDL or LDL. Finally, monocyte-macrophages from seven homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia subjects were unable to metabolize beta-VLDL or LDL, but demonstrated normal uptake of acetoacetylated LDL. The classic apoB,E(LDL) receptors on human monocyte-macrophages thus mediate the uptake of beta-VLDL by these cells.\r"

  ".W": "Tumor necrosis factor (TNF, cachectin) is a macrophage product that has been suggested to signal the loss of body weight, the decrease in adipose tissue and muscle mass, and anorexia during infections or chronic illness. To test this possibility, young growing rats were injected subcutaneously or intraperitoneally with human or murine recombinant TNF. After 3-4 h, these animals developed a 1-2 degrees fever which lasted approximately 4 h. With repeated daily TNF injections for 5 d, the animals developed fevers similarly each day. In contrast, rats injected with endotoxin show a single febrile episode and then are tolerant to subsequent daily injections of endotoxin (but do not develop tolerance to TNF or interleukin-1). On the first day of TNF treatment, the rats did not grow, but on subsequent days, despite their fevers, they grew at similar rates as controls. Although the TNF-treated rats consumed slightly less food than control animals, the ratio of growth per amount of food intake was identical in the two groups. When rats are administered endotoxin, they develop a fever, and their muscles show increased protein degradation and prostaglandin (PG)E2 production. However, when fevers were induced with TNF, there was no change in muscle proteolysis or PGE2 production, and in adipose tissue no increase in basal or catecholamine-induced lipolysis. Also TNF addition in vitro did not enhance lipolysis in epididymal fat pads or proteolysis in soleus muscles. Thus, TNF treatment can induce fever without producing a catabolic state similar to that induced by endotoxin.\r"

In this report we describe the structure of the human beta subunit GPIIIa deduced from an analysis of 4.0 kb of overlapping cDNA sequences isolated from a human erythroleukemia (HEL) cell cDNA expression library. A continuous open reading frame encoding all 788 amino acids for GPIIIa was present. The deduced amino acid sequence included a 26-residue amino-terminal signal peptide, a 29-residue transmembrane domain near the carboxy terminus, and four tandemly repeated cysteine-rich domains of 33-38 residues. An exact correspondence of 128 amino acids from seven human platelet GPIIIa fragments with HEL GPIIIa indicates that HEL and platelet GPIIIa are the same gene product. The HEL GPIIIa sequence was compared with the sequences of the beta subunit for the human LFA-1/Mac-1/p150.95 complex and human endothelial cell GPIIIa, revealing a 38% similarity with the former and virtual identity with the latter. Northern blot analysis using RNA from both HEL and endothelial cells revealed two GPIIIa transcripts of 5.9 and 4.1 kb. However, HEL RNA, but not endothelial cell RNA, contained a transcript for GPIIb. This indicates that the GPIIIa-containing heterodimers in platelets and endothelial cells are not identical structures, but are members of a subfamily within the human family of adhesion protein receptors sharing an identical beta subunit.\r"

From the dilution obtained at the cut-off level, a quotient QHIV was derived as an indicator of intrathecal production of HIV antibodies. Six of a total of eight samples with a QHIV value of greater than or equal to 2 were correlated which the clinical diagnosis of AIDS-related dementia complex (ARDC). However, a QHIV less than 1 did not exclude the development of ARDC, as was shown during follow-up in one case. Different methods are compared for the determination of intrathecal production of IgG and anti-HIV. A quotient QHIV greater than or equal to 2 is suggested to be highly indicative of intrathecal production of anti-HIV as well as of the development of ARDC.\r"

Although the overall incidence of toxic events was similar in both groups, the incidence of severe toxicity was reduced in the group that received the greater hydration and alkalinization, 6% v 16%. This study demonstrated that the amount of hydration and alkalinization can affect MTX plasma concentrations. Optimizing the hydration and alkalinization schedule is important for minimizing the incidence of severe toxicity associated with HDMTX.\r"

Cell measurements were obtained in 37 evaluable patients during their first remission induction treatment with DNR and cytarabine (ara-C) and directly compared with the plasma distribution kinetics of DNR. We show that (1) plasma DNR concentrations do not correlate with DNR concentrations in bone marrow nucleated cells; but (2) plasma area under the curve (AUC) values of DNR correlate inversely (P less than .01) with AUC values of DNR in WBCs; (3) concentrations of DNR in WBCs correlate positively (P less than .01) with DNR concentrations in bone marrow nucleated cells; and (4) the concentrations of DNR in WBCs show a negative correlation (P less than .01) with the numbers of peripheral blast cells at diagnosis. We then tested whether the pharmacokinetic parameters had predictive value for the clinical outcome of therapy, but none of the plasma levels or WBC and bone marrow concentrations of DNR predicted treatment outcome. The inverse correlation between the concentrations of DNR in WBC and the numbers of peripheral blast cells suggests that the effective DNR concentrations achieved intracellularly are mainly a function of the tumor load so that lesser amounts of DNR accumulate intracellularly when the AML cell numbers in blood are higher.\r"

These perceptions approached the normal range at the postsurgical assessment. Patients treated for maxillary hypoplasia, however, rated themselves in the mandibular prognathic range both before and after surgery. These patients were also more likely to perceive other deviations from the ideal in their facial features 2 years after surgical correction. Body image did not differentiate among diagnostic categories, but showed overall improvements for all patients from presurgery to postsurgery. Profile drawings appear to be the most statistically and clinically useful method of determining patients' self-assessments of deviations from normal, and their perceptions of treatment needs.\r"

Twenty men and 24 women were randomly assigned to dilated or nondilated groups. Repeated passage of the nasopharyngeal airway and nasotracheal tube over relatively friable nasal mucosa accounted for increased hemorrhage in the dilated group. For routine nasotracheal intubation of healthy patients, dilation with nasopharyngeal airways needlessly adds time, trauma, and hemorrhage to the induction of anesthesia.\r"

  ".W": "Phenytoin-induced gingival overgrowth (PIGO) is a recognized side effect in many cerebral palsy patients using diphenylhydantoin (Dph) for the control of seizures. Severe degrees of gingival overgrowth can affect the patient's dentition by: 1) interference with normal masticatory function to the point of documented weight loss, 2) producing an ectopically erupting dentition to the point of poor occlusal development, and 3) producing an unattractive appearance, in those patients who appreciate their esthetics, to the point of lessened self-concept. The purpose of this investigation was to evaluate the management of a group of 142 patients, with various cerebral palsy diagnoses, as to the use of diphenylhydantoin for the control of seizures. If diphenylhydantoin was used, the presence, degree, and surgical management of PIGO was documented. Additionally, if surgical treatment was employed for removal of hyperplastic gingiva, the indications for outpatient treatment (no use of general anesthetic) or inpatient (hospital admission and use of a general anesthetic) were identified. A discussion of major indications of surgery and postoperative complications of all surgical procedures is provided.\r"

Levels in semen samples collected 3.0 to 4.5 hours after oral dosing were 1.68 to 6.43 mumol/L. These values are above the in vitro minimum inhibitory concentration for the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). Mean serum concentrations at the early and late times after oral dosing were 0.22 to 3.07 mumol/L and 0.10 to 1.42 mumol/L, respectively. Ratios of semen/serum zidovudine levels ranged from 1.3 to 20.4.

Although most cells from BS patients exhibit high sister-chromatid exchange (SCE), lymphoid cells from some patients exhibit dimorphism for high and low SCE. We addressed the issue of dominance or recessivity of the low-SCE BS phenotype. A high-SCE lymphoblast line, HB1, was mutagenized, and a clone, HB10T, carrying the markers ouabain resistance and thioguanine resistance, was isolated to serve as a fusion parent. Two independent low-SCE BS lines were fused with HB10T, and hybrids were selected in HAT medium supplemented with ouabain. The hybrids, which were tetraploid, exhibited the expected phenotypes when exposed to ouabain and thioguanine. In every case, these hybrids had low SCE levels, establishing dominance of the low-SCE phenotype. The same methodology was also used to assess genetic heterogeneity in BS. A complementation analysis was carried out using high-SCE lymphoblast cell lines derived from BS patients. HB10T was fused with five other high-SCE BS lines. No correction of the high SCE characteristic of BS cells was seen in hybrid lines derived from patients of Ashkenazi Jewish, French-Canadian, Mennonite, or Japanese extraction. Thus, a single gene is responsible for the high-SCE phenotype in BS patients of diverse ethnic origin.\r"

Patients may present with neurologic, hepatic, or hematologic disease at any age between the first and fifth decade of life. Because of clinical heterogeneity, genetic heterogeneity in the etiology of the disease has been proposed. Recently, linkage of the WD locus to loci on 13q has been demonstrated in five Middle-Eastern kindreds. We have used esterase D and several polymorphic markers on 13q to investigate linkage in WD pedigrees from the United States and Canada. Ten kindreds, three with hepatic and seven with neurologic presentations, were informative, yielding a lod score of 2.189 at a recombination fraction of .06 with probe 7F12 at D13S1. Patients were generally of mixed European background, but one particularly informative pedigree was Hispanic. Our data confirm the provisional assignment of the gene for WD to 13q. More specifically, our findings indicate that, irrespective of ethnic background or clinical presentation, the linkage to 13q will be present in most pedigrees. The relative lack of linkage heterogeneity indicates that closely linked polymorphic loci on 13q can be useful in prenatal and presymptomatic diagnosis and in heterozygote detection.\r"

This clone has been used as a probe to determine the chromosomal location of the MCM gene and MUT locus. Southern blot analysis of DNA from human-hamster somatic-cell hybrid cell lines assigned the locus to region q12-p23 of chromosome 6. In situ hybridization further localized the locus to the region 6p12-21.2. A highly informative RFLP was identified at the MCM gene locus which will be useful for genetic diagnostic and linkage studies.\r"

  ".W": "Chromosome-specific DNA markers provide a powerful approach for studying complex problems in human genetics and offer an opportunity to begin understanding the human genome at the molecular level. The approach described here for isolating and characterizing DNA markers specific to human chromosome 15 involved construction of a partial chromosome-15 phage library from a human/Chinese hamster cell hybrid with a single human chromosome 15. Restriction fragments that identified unique- and low-copy loci on chromosome 15 were isolated from the phage inserts. These fragments were regionally mapped to the chromosome by three methods, including Southern analysis with a mapping panel of cell hybrids, in situ hybridization to metaphase chromosomes, and quantitative hybridization or dosage analysis. A total of 42 restriction fragments of unique- and low-copy sequences were identified in 14 phage. The majority of the fragments that have been characterized so far exhibited the hybridization pattern of a unique locus on chromosome 15. Regional mapping assigned these markers to specific locations on chromosome 15, including q24-25, q21-23, q13-14, q11-12, and q11. RFLP analysis revealed that several markers displayed polymorphisms at frequencies useful for genetic linkage analysis. The markers mapped to the proximal long arm of chromosome 15 are particularly valuable for the molecular analysis of Prader-Willi syndrome, which maps to this region. Polymorphic markers in this region may also be useful for definitively establishing linkage with one form of dyslexia. DNA probes in this chromosomal region should facilitate molecular structural analysis for elucidation of the nature of instability in this region, which is frequently associated with chromosomal aberrations.\r"

  ".W": "The X chromosome-linked glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) A(+) variant is found in approximately 20% of blacks. Examination of the structure of the G6PD A(+) gene revealed that AT----GC transition occurred in the variant gene, resulting in the amino acid substitution Asn----Asp at the one hundred forty-second position from the NH2-terminal of the enzyme (Takizawa and Yoshida 1987). The nucleotide change created an additional FokI cleavage site in the variant A(+) gene; thus, the FokI fragment type of the variant A(+) DNA differs from that of the normal B(+) DNA. PvuII fragment type is also found to be polymorphic in blacks, but not in Caucasians. The majority of blacks, as well all nonblacks, have a major hybridization-positive fragment of approximately 4.0 kbp (PvuII type 1), while approximately 20% of blacks have a major fragment of approximately 1.5 kbp (PvuII type 2). The G6PD gene with PvuII type 2 contains an additional PvuII cleavage site approximately 0.7 kbp downstream from the mutation site of the G6PD A(+). Approximately 40% of the G6PD A(+) genes have PvuII type 2, while only approximately 10% of the G6PD B(+) genes are associated with PvuII type 2. The data indicate a statistically significant (X2 = 6.85, P less than .020) linkage disequilibrium between the G6PD types and the PvuII types at the G6PD locus.\r"

  ".W": "In summary, mast cell activation is associated with the release of chemotactic factors, enzymes, proteoglycans, and vasoactive mediators. The vasoactive mediators include the leukotrienes, prostaglandin PGD2, adenosine, PAF, and histamine. Their effects are associated with an early phase reaction. This early reaction in the airways is manifested by cough, wheeze, mucous secretion, and a short-lived bronchospastic response. The release of chemotactic factors perhaps including PAF, eosinophil-directed and neutrophil-directed mediators would be associated with the influx into the airway of a variety of leukocytes although neutrophils and eosinophils predominate. The eosinophil contains a variety of toxic materials including a major basic protein known to kill tracheal epithelial cells. The eosinophil also generates PAF and leukotrienes. It could, therefore, be responsible for a self-sustaining tissue damaging inflammatory infiltrate. And finally, there are the neutral protease enzymes whose function remains unknown. It is tempting to speculate that the vasoactive mediators cause an early phase reaction while the enzymes and chemotactic factors set up the inflammation associated with a late phase response. The clinical pertinence to this has been demonstrated by researchers who studied nonspecific bronchial reactivity in patients who have early phase reactions only as compared with those who have both early and late phase reactions to antigen bronchoprovocation. These individuals with only an early phase reaction following antigen bronchoprovocation have a lesser degree of sensitivity to histamine, ie, it requires more histamine to cause bronchoconstriction, and there is no change in their histamine threshold after their early phase response.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "To investigate whether female sex hormones and pregnancy induce increased gallbladder synthesis of prostaglandin I2 (PGI2) and prostaglandin E (PGE), we used an in vitro incubation chamber to quantitate the effects of progesterone, estrogen, pregnancy, and pregnancy plus a 2%-cholesterol diet on mucosal and serosal PGI2 and PGE production by the rabbit gallbladder. Neither the female sex hormones nor pregnancy alone caused a significant increase in PGI2 or PGE synthesis. The gallbladders of cholesterol-fed, pregnant rabbits demonstrated significant increases only in serosal synthesis of PGI2. This increased production was equivalent to that noted for gallbladders from nonpregnant rabbits fed a high-cholesterol diet. There were no increases in mucosal synthesis of PGE or of PGI2. Thus, neither elevated levels of progesterone or estrogen nor pregnancy is directly responsible for the increased PGI2 activity in the female gallbladder; conversely, this effect seems to be mediated by the increased biliary concentrations of cholesterol.\r"

The retinal pigment epithelium was variably hypopigmented and hyperpigmented. On electron microscopy, osmiophilic, multimembranous, and complex lipofuscin inclusions were present in conjunctival cells, keratocytes, lens epithelium, iris and ciliary body fibrocytes, occasional outer retinal cells, and retinal pigment epithelial cells. The twins' father and an older sister were also affected and had classic neurologic and ophthalmologic abnormalities.

Patient no. 1 was in a typical myeloblastic transformation and patient no. 2 in \"basophilic transformation.\" Both patients exhibited karyotype evolution in blastic phase (BP), so that we could differentiate BP clones with additional chromosomal abnormalities from chronic phase (CP) clones with only Ph1 among single colonies. The number of single colonies yielding two or more analyzable metaphases was 18 in patient no. 1, and 19 in patient no. 2. Among these colonies, only three in patient no. 1 and none in patient no. 2 were from CP clones and 15 in patient no. 1 and 19 in patient no. 2 were from BP clones. Morphological examination revealed that not only blasts but also mature neutrophils, eosinophils, basophils, macrophages, and erythroblasts were derived from BP clones. These results suggested that (1) BP clones developed at the pluripotent stem cell level, (2) additional chromosomal abnormalities were not restricted to occur in a specific cell line representative in BP; and (3) BP clones, if not all, may retain capacity for maturation and differentiation.\r"

Equivalent suppression of CFU-GM committed to monocytic as well as granulocytic differentiation was observed using colony-stimulating factors (CSFs) differing in their lineage specificities and by direct morphological analysis of proliferating clones. Kinetic analysis indicates that suppressive bone marrow cells appear within 2 hours after PGE2 injection, are maximal at 6 hours, and are no longer observed by 24 hours postinjection. Positive and negative selection studies using monoclonal antibodies indicate that the PGE2-induced suppressor cells react positively with anti-GMA 1.2, MAC1, and F4/80 monoclonal antibodies, suggesting a myeloid/monocytic origin. As few as 1,000 positively selected bone marrow or spleen cells were able to inhibit maximally normal CFU-GM proliferation by 50,000 control bone marrow cells. Suppression of normal CFU-GM can be substituted for by 24-hour cell-free supernates from unseparated bone marrow cells or GMA 1.2 or F4/80 positively selected marrow or spleen cells from PGE2-treated but not control mice. These supernates also inhibited BFU-E proliferation. Injection of as few as 2 million bone marrow cells from PGE2-treated mice into steady-state mice or animals hematopoietically rebounding following a sublethal injection of cyclophosphamide significantly suppressed total CFU-GM proliferation in recipient mice within 6 hours. In summary, these studies describe the detection of a novel hematopoietic control network induced by PGE2 in intact mice.\r"

We observed that colony formation by K562 cells in semi-solid medium containing reduced fetal calf serum (FCS) is not directly proportional to the number of cells plated, suggesting production of autostimulatory factors by K562 cells. Using radioimmunoprecipitation and a bioassay for EPA, medium conditioned by K562 cells was found to contain high levels of biologically active EPA; Northern hybridization analysis confirmed the expression of EPA mRNA. Radiolabeled EPA was used to identify cell surface receptors on K562 cells. Together, these results suggest that EPA may act as an autocrine growth factor for K562 cells.\r"

Then, ten animals within each group were stressed by cold restraint. At the end of the stress period, all these animals as well as their unstressed counterparts were killed, the number of gastric ulcers were counted, and mucosal levels of PGE2 were assayed. Fasting alone caused no ulcerations but a decrease in mucosal PGE2 during the initial 24 h (p less than .05). However, there was a subsequent increase in mucosal PGE2, possibly related to the release of free fatty acids during starvation. Starvation and stress caused a marked and consistent reduction of the mucosal PGE2 and an increase in the number of mucosal ulcerations directly related to the duration of starvation (p less than .05).\r"

  ".W": "Enhanced production of arachidonic acid metabolites by colonic mucosa has been reported in ulcerative colitis as well as in experimental models of colitis. However, production of these compounds by colonic smooth muscle from colitis subjects has not been described. To evaluate arachidonic acid metabolism in colonic tissue, we studied the production of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) by mucosa and muscularis propria in two experimental models of acute colitis in which inflammation was virtually confined to the mucosa. Colitis was induced in New Zealand white rabbits by either of two methods, dinitrochlorobenzene (DNCB) sensitization or formalin followed by intravenous soluble immune complexes (F-IC). Arachidonic acid metabolites were identified from in vitro incubations of tissue with [14C] arachidonic acid by thin layer chromatography followed by autoradiography. The major eicosanoid metabolites of colitis mucosa and muscularis were 14C-labeled prostaglandin E2, prostaglandin F2a and 6-keto prostaglandin F1 alpha. PGE2 was quantitated from incubations without labeled arachidonic acid by radio-immunoassay. PGE2, expressed as picograms per milligram protein per 20 min (mean +/- SEM), was increased in F-IC mucosa (1093 +/- 141 vs 645 +/- 189, P less than 0.05) and DNCB mucosa (1354 +/- 487 vs 527 +/- 222, P less than 0.05) compared to normals. PGE2 production by uninflamed colitis muscularis propria was also increased five- to eightfold compared to normals for F-IC muscularis (1594 +/- 329 vs 189 +/- 35, P less than 0.005) and DNCB muscularis (1287 +/- 171 vs 225 +/- 72, P less than 0.005). Thus, the adjacent inflammation in colonic mucosa may induce increased eicosanoid production by the uninflamed smooth muscle.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Retinoic acid has previously been shown to alter 1-25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 [1,25-(OH)2D3] receptors in tumorigenic (ROS 17/2A, UMR 106M) and nontumorigenic (RCJ 1.20) bone-derived cells. The mechanism of this regulation is unclear. In the present series of experiments, we have investigated the mechanism of the retinoic acid-induced increase in 1,25-(OH)2D3 receptors by studying the effects of sodium butyrate on this process. In ROS 17/2A rat osteosarcoma cells, retinoic acid induced a 2-4-fold increase in 1,25-(OH)2D3 receptors in proliferating cells but only a 1.5- to 2-fold increase in nonproliferating cells. The retinoic acid-induced increase in 1,25-(OH)2D3 receptors in proliferating ROS 17/2A cells was inhibited by sodium butyrate, but sodium butyrate had no effect on the retinoic acid-induced increase in 1,25-(OH)2D3 receptors in nonproliferating cells. Pretreatment with hydroxyurea of low density cells decreased the effect of retinoic acid, and abolished the sodium butyrate inhibition, indicating that the differing effects of retinoic acid in high and low density cells are related to cell proliferation and not to cell density or time of exposure to retinoic acid. In low density UMR 106M cells, the effects of retinoic acid and sodium butyrate on the number of 1,25-(OH)2D3 receptors were similar to those in ROS 17/2A cells. However, in RCJ 1.20 cells, a nontumorigenic cell line with some of the characteristics normally attributed to osteoblasts, the effects of retinoic acid and sodium butyrate were opposite: retinoic acid caused a decrease in the number of 1,25-(OH)2D3 receptors, which was inhibited by sodium butyrate. The possibility that the different responses observed between the two osteosarcoma cell lines and the RCJ 1.20 cells constitute differences in response pattern between tumorigenic and nontumorigenic cell lines is of interest, but requires further experimentation to verify.\r"

  ".W": "Conditioned medium from cultured normal human foreskin keratinocytes enhanced the release of calcium from neonatal mouse calvaria in organ culture. Unfractionated keratinocyte-conditioned medium (KCM) stimulated bone resorption in a dose-dependent manner, but it did not increase the concentration of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) in the bone culture medium until a maximal dose of KCM for resorption was used. Furthermore, inhibitors of PGE2 synthesis, indomethacin, ibuprofen, and piroxicam, did not inhibit KCM-induced calcium release. High concentrations of KCM increased cAMP production by calvaria in the presence of isobutylmethylxanthine, but the increase was small compared with that produced by a dose of bovine PTH that caused a similar level of bone resorption. The bone resorption-stimulating activity of KCM was not lost after incubation at 56 C for 60 min, but it was lost after heating at 100 C for 10 min. Fractionation of KCM by gel filtration chromatography revealed two distinct peaks of bone resorption-stimulating activity. One peak, KCMI, caused a significant increase in bone resorption at 2 micrograms protein/ml. KCMI did not increase medium PGE2, and inhibition of PGE2 synthesis in bone had no effect on KCMI-induced bone resorption. KCMI failed to increase cAMP production by human osteosarcoma SaOS-2 cells. Another peak, KCMII, caused a dose-dependent increase in bone resorption, and a significant increase in medium calcium was noted at a 20-fold lower concentration (0.1 microgram protein/ml) than with KCMI. In contrast to KCMI, the increase in bone resorption stimulated by KCMII was accompanied by a parallel increase in the production of PGE2, and inhibition of PGE2 synthesis completely inhibited the bone resorption-stimulating activity of KCMII. KCMII also caused an increase in cAMP production by SaOS-2 cells. We conclude that KCM contains at least two distinct bone resorption-stimulating factors, one of which acts via a PG-mediated mechanism and the other by a PG-independent pathway.\r"

In the first experiment, BK at a concentration of 0.033, 0.33, or 3.3 micrograms/ml was added to the perfusate of one ovary at hourly intervals for the first 10 h of perfusion. The contralateral control ovary was treated with medium alone parallel to the experimental ovary. Ovaries were perfused for a total of 12 h. BK induced ovulation in the absence of gonadotropin in a dose-related fashion, but did not induce maturation of ovulated ova or follicular oocytes. BK significantly stimulated PG production at all concentrations tested, but the effect was not dose related. Prostacyclin, as reflected by the concentration of 6-keto-PGF1 alpha in the perfusate, was the major PG produced. Smaller quantities of PGE2 and PGF2 alpha were present in the perfusate. After a single injection of BK (3.3 micrograms/ml), 6-keto-PGF1 alpha and PGF2 alpha production increased within 15 min and reached a maximum at 60-90 min. PGE2 did not change significantly over this time period. The addition of 1 microgram/ml indomethacin to the perfusate completely inhibited BK-stimulated PG production. However, indomethacin did not significantly affect the ovulatory efficiency of BK-treated ovaries. Neither BK nor indomethacin induced any degenerative changes in ovulated ova or follicular oocytes. The addition of a BK antagonist at 1 microgram/ml every 30 min to the perfusate resulted in an effective blockade of hCG-induced ovulation. These results suggest that BK is involved in the process of follicle rupture, but BK may induce ovulation by a mechanism(s) other than through PG stimulation.\r"

TGF beta increases the synthesis of collagen and enhances the deposition of matrix by almost all cells studied to date. The presence of TGF beta in cartilage suggests an important autocrine function, and the present study was designed to examine its influence on the matrix synthesis of chick epiphyseal chondrocytes. Chondrocytes were plated in serum-free (BSA-supplemented) medium or medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), and after 24 h in monolayer culture were treated with TGF beta in identical medium. A 24-h incubation with TGF beta caused a dose-dependent decrease in collagen synthesis (-14%) and increase in noncollagen protein synthesis (+25%), with greater effects in serum-containing medium (-22% and +58%, respectively). Similarly, the stimulation of sulfate incorporation by TGF beta was greater in FBS-containing medium (+140%) than in serum-free medium (+70%). These changes were present by 6 h, were maximal in the 0.3-3.0 ng/ml dose range, and were found to reflect an alteration in extracellular protein synthesis. The enhancement of TGF beta effects by serum was abolished when chondrocytes were plated and exposed to TGF beta in medium containing dialyzed FBS (12-14K membrane). The present study indicates that TGF beta influences the synthesis of matrix components by growth plate chondrocytes. The effects are enhanced by factors present in serum.\r"

  ".W": "Two independently derived rat hepatoma cell lines, HTC and Fu5-5, differ in their sensitivities to both glucocorticoids and antiglucocorticoids, despite virtually identical number and affinity of glucocorticoid receptors. The present study further examined both receptors for differences that could account for the nonidentical responses of the two cell lines. HTC and Fu5-5 cell receptors that were covalently labeled with [3H] dexamethasone 21-mesylate ([3H]DM) had the same mol wt of about 97,000 on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and the same isoelectric point of about 6.4 by nonequilibrium pH gradient electrophoresis. Limited proteolysis of receptor-[3H]DM complexes with three different proteases generated identical protease-specific digestion patterns regardless of the cellular origin of the receptors. Receptor-[3H]dexamethasone complexes prepared from either Fu5-5 or HTC cells bound calf thymus DNA with the same affinity in vitro. In intact cells, the intracellular distribution of receptor-dexamethasone or receptor-DM complexes at equilibrium was almost identical in the two cell lines. Thus, we detected no differences in the size, sequence, or net charge of Fu5-5 or HTC cell receptors; additionally, there were no significant differences in steroid uptake, receptor binding, or activation, translocation, and nuclear binding of receptor-steroid complexes. However, the DM labeling efficiency, calculated as the percentage of total receptors covalently labeled by DM, was higher in HTC cells (65.9 +/- 12.9%; n = 5) than in Fu5-5 cells (39.3 +/- 7.7%; n = 5). The labeling efficiency of DM correlated inversely with its ability to induce tyrosine aminotransferase activity, suggesting that DM forms noncovalent, as well as covalent, complexes in vivo which mediate the glucocorticoid and antiglucocorticoid activities of DM, respectively. Further research is required to identify the factor(s) that influences DM labeling efficiency, thereby affecting the amount of DM agonist activity and, possibly, the sensitivity of the cells to glucocorticoids.\r"

  ".W": "The N-terminal fragment of human hypercalcemia factor (hHCF), hHCF-(1-34)NH2, has bioactivities similar to PTH in vitro and in vivo. Because it interacts with PTH receptors and is more potent than PTH in some systems, the hHCF sequence may provide interesting leads for the design of potent and selective PTH and hHCF antagonists. Based on the antagonist activity of [Tyr34]bovine PTH-(7-34)NH2 [( Tyr34]bPTH-(7-34)NH2), we synthesized the corresponding fragment of hHCF, hHCF-(7-34)NH2 and examined its properties in vitro. In the bone-derived rat osteosarcoma cell line ROS 17/2.8, hHCF-(7-34)NH2 and [Tyr34]bPTH-(7-34)NH2 were equipotent for inhibition of radiolabeled PTH-binding. In contrast, hHCF-(7-34)NH2 was 8-fold more potent that [Tyr34]bPTH-(7-34)NH2 for inhibiting PTH-stimulated cAMP production. hHCF-(7-34)NH2 also inhibited PTH-binding and PTH-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity in bovine renal cortical membranes: hHCF-(7-34)NH2 and [Tyr34]bPTH-(7-34)NH2 were equipotent in this system. In addition, hHCF-(7-34)NH2 antagonized hHCF-(1-34)NH2 action in both systems with similar inhibition constants. However, unlike the PTH analogue, hHCF-(7-34)NH2 (8 microM) was a weak partial agonist, producing a 2.4-fold increase in cAMP (5% of the maximal response) in ROS cells. This same system also detects agonism for [Nle8, 18Tyr34]bPTH-(3-34)NH2, another PTH partial agonist/antagonist. These results demonstrate that hHCF-(7-34)NH2 interacts with PTH receptors based in large part on the region which is not homologous to PTH, and suggest the utility of the ROS 17/2.8 cell system for identifying weak agonism of PTH and hHCF analogues in vitro.\r"

In the present study, concentrations of PGE-2 were determined by radioimmunoassay in lumbar cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of 17 children shortly after a febrile convulsion. PGE-2 data of these children were compared with those determined in afebrile children and febrile children without convulsions. Duration of storage of CSF samples at -30 degrees C prior to analysis had no influence on PGE-2 levels. Compared with afebrile patients, PGE-2 levels were significantly higher after febrile convulsions. Significantly elevated concentrations of PGE-2 were also found in febrile children without seizures, although the mean PGE-2 level in these patients was somewhat lower than that determined after a febrile convulsion. When body temperature of the patients was compared with their CSF PGE-2 levels, a significant positive correlation was determined between both variables. It is therefore not clear if the increased concentrations of PGE-2 in CSF of patients with febrile convulsions are, at least in part, to be related to increased PG synthesis and release during and after the seizure or are solely to be related to the febrile state of the children.\r"

Comparison with immunoblotting with Ca 19-9 antibody suggests that the epitopes for Ca 19-9 and peanut agglutinin may be variably expressed on different sites of the same mucin. The peanut agglutinin-binding glycoprotein was demonstrated in 12 of 34 pancreatic cancer sera, including four with normal Ca 19-9 assay, and none of 96 control sera, including sera from patients with obstructive jaundice and other cancers. These preliminary results suggest that it may become a useful addition to the current serum markers for pancreatic cancer. The technique of sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and lectin blotting may well prove valuable in the search for other cancer-related glycoprotein markers.\r"

For 8-10 wk rats were fed three dietary regimens supplying 3.5% (control group), 0.3%, and 10% of total calories as linoleic acid. We found that diets deficient in linoleic acid (0.3%) reduced release of prostaglandin E2 into the gastric lumen (-77%) and increased basal (+133%) and pentagastrin-stimulated acid secretion (+93%) and the area of cold restraint-induced gastric mucosal lesions (+280%), when compared with the control group. Diets supplemented with linoleic acid (10%) increased prostaglandin E2 release into the gastric lumen (+106%) and reduced basal (-44%) and pentagastrin-stimulated acid secretion (-78%) and the area of cold restraint-induced mucosal.lesions (-80%). Prevention of these lesions by the 10% linoleic acid diet was confirmed by quantitative histology. Pretreatment with indomethacin (8 mg/kg intraperitoneally) abolished the effects of the 10% linoleic acid diet on prostaglandin formation, acid secretion, and mucosal injury. We conclude that in rats chronic intake of dietary linoleic acid reduces acid secretion and prevents cold restraint-induced mucosal lesions, possibly because of augmented synthesis of endogenous prostaglandins in the gastric mucosa.\r"

Among the group of 88 alcohol abusers, the presence of HLA antigens A1, A9, A28 and Bw35 marked a significant 2.5- to 3-fold increased estimated risk for the development of alcohol-induced cirrhosis, while the presence of HLA B5 was found to be associated with a significantly decreased risk of alcohol-induced cirrhosis. Further, compared to controls, the estimated risk of any stage of alcohol-induced liver disease was significantly increased in alcoholic individuals with HLA A28 and Bw35, and the protective effect of HLA B5 was again observed. The findings of this study suggest that at least in a relatively homogeneous population group such as the Portuguese, the presence of HLA B5 may confer protection against alcohol-induced liver disease, including cirrhosis. The presence of HLA Bw35 and A28 appear to mark susceptibility to all histologic manifestations of alcohol-induced liver disease, while in addition to Bw35 and A28, A1 and A9 may mark increased risk for cirrhosis in particular.\r"

  ".W": "We explored the potential proinflammatory effect of prostaglandins of the E series (PGE's) in a rabbit model of acute pulmonary inflammation. The instillation of fragments of the fifth component of complement (C5f) into the lung resulted in a localized area of inflammation, the extent of which was quantified by the total number of neutrophils and protein recoverable by bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL). Utilizing 111In-labeled neutrophils and serial scintigraphy, neutrophil localization in the area of inflammation was detected as early as 20 min after C5f instillation and reached a maximum between 2 and 4 h. The simultaneous intrabronchial administration of 100 micrograms of PGE2 resulted in a twofold increase in the accumulation of neutrophils in the area of inflammation as determined scintigraphically, a fivefold increase in BAL neutrophils, and a threefold increase in BAL protein. A proinflammatory effect on lavage constituents was also seen with the intravenous administration of PGE2 (100 ng.kg-1.min-1) and PGE1 (50 ng.kg-1.min-1) as well as in animals pretreated with a PGH synthase inhibitor, meclofenamate, and a thromboxane synthase inhibitor, dazmegrel. The effect of intrabronchial PGE2 to potentiate the inflammatory response was attenuated by the intravenous administration of a vasoconstrictor (angiotensin II) and mimicked by a vasodilator (nitroprusside), suggesting an effect of vasodilation per se. Using radiolabeled microspheres, it was determined that in response to the C5f alone, there was a 50% decrease in local blood flow to the area of inflammation, a pattern different from that seen in the systemic circulation. This decrease was prevented by the concomitant administration of PGE2 or nitroprusside. We conclude that vasodilation induced by PGE2 is associated with enhancement of pulmonary inflammation.\r"

  ".W": "There is evidence that prostaglandins (PG), specifically PGE2, participate in the regulation of fetal breathing movements (FBM). During late gestation, when FBM occur intermittently and primarily during low-voltage electrocortical activity, the concentration of PGE2 in fetal plasma ([PGE2]) is high. During the days before delivery [PGE2] increases and FBM decrease. To determine whether the increase in [PGE2] is responsible for the concurrent decrease in FBM, we infused the prostaglandin synthase inhibitor, meclofenamate (0.7 mg.kg-1.h-1), into eight fetal sheep continuously for 5-13 days before delivery; five control fetuses received a continuous infusion of the solvent for 5-11 days before delivery. Compared with control infusion, meclofenamate caused a significant decrease in [PGE 2] until the day of delivery and a significant increase in FBM [overall and during high-voltage electrocortical activity (HVA)] until 2 days before delivery. Although there were significant correlations between [PGE2] and FBM (overall and during HVA), both groups showed similar decreases in FBM during the 2 days before delivery. We conclude that the decrease in FBM before delivery is not dependent on the concurrent increase in [PGE2].\r"

We hypothesized that the free estrogen thus formed may influence the contractility of the adjacent myometrium in late pregnancy. In this study we measured the abilities of various steroids and steroid conjugates to influence the hydrolysis of E1S by the 105,000 x g pellet of chorion tissue obtained from women after spontaneous onset of labor and vaginal delivery and from women delivered by cesarean section before labor onset. No differences were found in tissues obtained before or after the onset of labor. None of the steroids increased the rate of hydrolysis. Several unconjugated steroids caused significant inhibition, but only at concentrations well beyond physiological ranges in maternal or fetal blood. However, conjugated steroids had marked inhibitory effects at circulating concentrations. At equimolar concentrations with the E1S substrate, the sulfoconjugates of dehydroepiandrosterone, pregnenolone, and cholesterol caused 27 +/- 1% (+/- SE), 64 +/- 1%, and 40 +/- 1% inhibition, respectively. These results were confirmed using a tissue explant system. Using enzyme inhibition kinetic analysis, we determined that the inhibition by dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate was non-competitive, with Ki = 8.7 +/- 1.7 mumol/L. The inhibition by pregnenolone sulfate was competitive, with Ki = 1.6 +/- 0.4 mumol/L, and that by cholesterol sulfate was primarily noncompetitive, with Ki = 7.4 +/- 1.2 mumol/L. We conclude that there is significant interaction among sulfurylated steroids that may influence local free estrogen synthesis within human chorion. This interaction may affect the contractility of the late pregnancy myometrium.\r"

These patients have long-term follow-up, and the probability of cure is estimated at approximately 35%. The cause-specific hazard rate analysis found lower rates of achieving complete remission (CR) in patients with WBC greater than 10,000/microL, AUL (undifferentiated) morphology, and older age. Since these patients required additional time to respond, fewer of them actually achieved CR. Characteristics directly associated with a higher rate of death during induction therapy due to severe bone marrow suppression were low serum albumin concentration (less than or equal to 3.5 g/dL), age greater than 50 years, acute undifferentiated leukemia (AUL) morphology, low Karnofsky performance status, and weight loss greater than 5%. Factors associated with a higher rate of relapse were WBC greater than 20,000/microL, non-T cell ALL, age greater than 60 years, Ph' + ALL, and time to achieve CR greater than 5 weeks. These criteria were used to identify patients at high risk of relapse. In addition, the predictive value of high WBC was found to disappear by 18 months of continuous CR. Finally, the rate of death following first relapse was higher in patients with a short first remission duration, high percentage weight loss at initial diagnosis, and older age. In summary, factors associated with a higher rate of death during attempted induction (ie, low albumin, high percent weight loss, and poor performance status) had no association with the patient's ability to remain relapse-free. Conversely, factors correlating with more extensive or resistant disease (ie, high WBC, null or B cell ALL, or Ph' + ALL) showed no association with the ability to tolerate therapy. Thus, a less toxic but more effective induction regimen is needed for patients with a poor clinical status, whereas a more intensive form of therapy appears warranted for patients presenting with more extensive or resistant disease.\r"

  ".W": "To examine whether the results and interpretation of gallium-67 citrate imaging may be adversely influenced by factors present in compromised patients, we reviewed our 1-year experience in 69 patients in intensive care units, renal transplants, and those on hemodialysis. Our results indicate that it is an inappropriate diagnostic procedure for acute pancreatitis since seven of nine had false-negative results. Using loglinear modeling and chi-square analysis we found that treatment with antiinflammatory steroids, severe liver disease, end-stage renal disease, and renal transplantation with immunosuppressive therapy did not interfere with gallium-67 uptake. Increased rate of true-negative results in patients with end-stage renal disease was due to a greater and earlier use of the test in the febrile transplant patient and in hemodialysis patients with infections not amenable to diagnosis with gallium-67 scan (transient bacteremia and bacteriuria). We conclude that gallium-67 imaging is a useful diagnostic tool that, with the exception of acute pancreatitis, has very few false-negative results.\r"

In the first patient, gallium scan showed abnormal localized activity while the computed tomography (CT) scan and the magnetic resonance imaging were negative. Liver function tests and AFP were also normal and the patient was operated upon only on the basis of the gallium scan. The second patient had a follow-up gallium scan 2 mo after the first operation that showed an area of increased activity along the inferior aspect of the right lobe. A CT scan done after that showed no evidence of recurrence, but subsequently became positive when repeated 4 mo later. The third patient had abnormal simultaneous gallium scan and CT scan demonstrating a recurrence in the left adrenal gland while both AFP and carcinoembryonic antigen were normal. This has led us to consider every patient a candidate for a baseline and follow-up gallium scan for evaluation for recurrence following HCC.\r"

Since gallium uptake is dependent on cellular function, autoradiographic techniques can be applied to cells of Paget's lesions to understand better the mechanism of [67Ga]citrate uptake. Bone biopsies were obtained from sites of increased uptake using [67Ga]citrate scintigraphy in two patients with Paget's disease. In both patients electron microscopic autoradiographs demonstrated a high concentration of silver grains over the nuclei of osteoclasts. The cellular mechanism is unknown but may be related to the known inhibitory effect of calcitonin on osteoclast activity. The association of [67Ga]citrate with the nucleus of the osteoclasts is unique and different from tumor cells in which there is a high association of [67Ga]citrate with the lysosome fraction within the cytoplasm.\r"

Cerebral computed tomographic scans at the time of initial examination and 3 months later demonstrated new cerebral lesions consistent with metastatic growths. The abrupt cerebral infarction, other clinical findings, and results of diagnostic studies strongly suggested that the acute cerebrovascular event was the result of metastatic cerebral embolization from the tumor material found in the thorax.

Hyperdiploid stem lines were identified in 25 of 26 tumor samples obtained at diagnosis from patients who did not have clinically overt metastases. Near-diploid tumor stem lines coexisted with hyperdiploid lines in 15 of these 25 cases; an isolated near-diploid line was present in the 26th case. All 26 patients underwent definitive surgery and then were treated uniformly with intensive adjuvant combination chemotherapy. Kaplan-Meier analysis of both relapse-free and overall survival times showed that the presence of a near-diploid tumor stem line was associated with improved outcome (P = 0.003 for each comparison). After a median follow-up time of three years, pulmonary metastases developed in only 2 patients in the group with near-diploid lines, in contrast to 7 of the 10 with hyperdiploid lines exclusively. Near diploidy remained significantly associated with improved relapse-free survival after adjustment for the influence of age, the only clinical variable that showed prognostic strength in this analysis (P less than 0.01; relative risk, 0.08; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.02 to 0.48). Our findings demonstrate the usefulness of flow-cytometric determination of tumor-cell ploidy for predicting the sensitivity of histologically high-grade osteosarcoma to chemotherapeutic agents. Patients with a near-diploid tumor stem line can be expected to respond favorably to adjuvant chemotherapy as used in this study, whereas those with only hyperdiploid lines should be considered as candidates for alternative therapy.\r"

Although 27 patients presented with known symptomatic HIV infection, 92 of the remaining 2275 patients (4.0 percent) had unrecognized HIV infection. The highest seroprevalence rate (11.4 percent) was found among black men 30 to 34 years of age. Blacks, other nonwhites, and patients under the age of 45 had high rates of unrecognized infection. The clinical team established risk-factor status in only 29.0 percent of the patients. Of the 276 patients with identified risk factors, 13.0 percent were seropositive, whereas 3.1 percent of the 1616 patients with unknown risk-factor status were seropositive. None of the 102 patients who reported no risk factors were seropositive. Although penetrating trauma (seroprevalence, 13.6 percent) was the only clinical presentation associated with an increased seroprevalence rate independent of other known predictors of infection (P = 0.02), seropositive patients were found in all categories of clinical condition. These data, although based on observations in one emergency department setting, support the concept of universal blood and body-fluid precautions by all health care workers whether or not HIV infection is known.\r"

We report here the development of a mutation-induced marker in mice heterozygous at the Dlb-1 locus which determines the expression of binding sites for the lectin Dolichos biflorus agglutinin (DBA) in intestinal epithelium. We show that this marker can be used to study the clonal organization of adult intestinal epithelium, and to mark descendent clones arising during development.

Diverse identities have been ascribed to P47 including lipocortin, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate 5-phosphomonoesterase, pyruvate dehydrogenase alpha subunit and an actin regulatory protein. We have isolated human P47 clones by immunological screening of a lambda gt11 complementary DNA library from HL-60 cells, a human promyelocytic leukaemia cell line. P47 recombinants thus identified hybridized to a 3.0 kilobase (kb) messenger RNA in mature white blood cell lines; the same mRNA was induced in HL-60 cells during differentiation. A 1,050 base pair (bp) open reading frame that could encode a protein of Mr40,087 was confirmed by comparison with peptide sequences from platelet P47, and by expression of the putative recombinant P47 in E. coli and in vitro. The P47 sequence appears to have been conserved throughout vertebrate evolution, and is not similar to any other known sequence including human lipocortin and the alpha subunit of pyruvate dehydrogenase. The P47 protein contains a potential Ca2+-binding 'EF-hand' structure and a region that strongly resembles known PKC phosphorylation sites.\r"

All biopsy specimens demonstrated the characteristic histologic lesion associated with TTP. Review of the literature showed an average diagnostic yield of 37% (30/81) for this procedure. The increase in diagnostic correlation in this study may be explained in part by the marked degree of disease expression in the patients who underwent gingival biopsy. Three of the five patients who underwent gingival biopsies ultimately died of their disease. In addition, a persistent search through multiple serial sections for the characteristic lesion, beyond the usual three levels, was performed. Despite the disparity in diagnostic yield, we consider the gingival biopsy to be a safe diagnostic correlate of TTP because of easy access, rich vascularity, and low surgical morbidity. Furthermore, we recommend biopsy, as Goodman and colleagues have, only in areas of the gingiva that appear clinically normal and free of inflammation in order to reduce misinterpretation as a consequence of false-positive intraluminal fibrin thrombi that may occur with inflammation.\r"

Commitment is the capacity to express terminal cell division and characteristics of the differentiated phenotype even after the cells are removed from culture with inducer. Culture of MEL cell line 745A.DS19 (DS19) with HMBA causes commitment to terminal differentiation after a latent period of about 10-12 hr. Previous studies have shown that during this latent period, HMBA causes a number of metabolic changes, including modulation in expression of certain protooncogenes. We now report the development of a MEL cell line (designated V3.17) derived from DS19 that is resistant to vincristine and is (i) markedly more sensitive to HMBA, (ii) induced to commitment without a detectable latent period, and (iii) resistant to the effects of phorbol ester and dexamethasone, which are potent inhibitors of HMBA-mediated DS19 differentiation. We suggest that this V3.17 MEL cell line may express a factor that circumvents HMBA-mediated early events, which prepare the cells for commitment to terminal differentiation.\r"

PGD2 was infused into the lateral or the third ventricle of the cerebrum slowly and continuously for 6 hr in the light period. Infusion of PGD2 into the lateral ventricle at 15-2250 pmol/min induced natural sleep as identified by electroencephalogram, electromyogram, electrooculogram, body temperature, heart rate, and animal behavior. Although sensitivity to PGD2 was slightly different among individual animals, the amount of total sleep time increased maximally up to 3- to 4-fold over the control level. PGD2 infused into the third ventricle induced effects similar to those observed for the lateral ventricular route, but infusion into the third ventricle was about 1000 times more effective than infusion into the lateral ventricle. In three monkeys, PGD2 increased the amount of sleep in a dose-dependent manner. Bell-shaped dose-response curves were observed for the other two monkeys. Infusion of prostaglandin E2 or F2 alpha into the lateral ventricle caused sedation but slightly reduced the amount of slow-wave sleep and produced increases in heart rate and body temperature. These findings suggest that endogenous PGD2 may be involved in the regulation of sleep by acting on the brain structures surrounding the third ventricle in the rhesus monkey.\r"

Nine patients were treated with 9-(1,3-dihydroxy-2-propoxymethyl)guanine (DHPG), one with 3'-azido-3'-deoxythymidine (AZT), and four initially with DHPG directed against cytomegalovirus (CMV) retinitis or encephalitis and subsequently with AZT against human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) encephalopathy. CMV retinitis was a helpful clinical observation indicating neurologic involvement. DHPG produced improvement in two of three cases of acute meningoencephalitis but was ineffective in cases of subacute encephalopathy or neuropathy. AZT therapy resulted in resolution in both of the two treated cases of acute confusional state and in two of the four treated cases of polyradiculoneuropathy with paraparesis but was ineffective in the late stage of subacute encephalopathy. These results suggest that CMV is important in some cases of acute meningoencephalitis, whereas HIV is a dominant pathogen in subacute dementia and polyneuropathy in patients with AIDS. DHPG may be beneficial in the former, whereas AZT appears to be effective in the latter complications.\r"

The maximum likelihood estimate for the proportion of infected homosexual men developing AIDS is 0.99 (90% confidence interval ranging from 0.38 to 1). Furthermore, the maximum likelihood estimate for the mean incubation period for AIDS in homosexual men is 7.8 years (90% confidence interval ranging from 4.2 years to 15.0 years), which is close to the estimate of 8.2 years for adults developing transfusion-associated AIDS.\r"

  ".W": "Likelihood analysis was used to test for evidence that an allele at a major locus elevates rates of sodium-lithium countertransport (SLC) in a sample of 1,989 members of 89 Utah pedigrees. The pedigrees were ascertained through two or three sibs who died of stroke before age 74 years (stroke pedigrees), through hypertensive and normotensive probands of the Salt Lake Center of the Hypertension Detection and Followup Program (HDFP pedigrees), or through men who suffered a myocardial infarction before age 55 years (coronary pedigrees). Major-locus inheritance could be rejected in the total sample; transmission probability estimates of tau1 = .972, tau2 = .520, tau3 = .185 differed significantly from Mendelian transmission specified by tau1 = 1, tau2 = 1/2, tau3 = 0. However, heterogeneity between ascertainment groups was significant (chi2(18) = 40.06, P less than .01) and justified analysis within subsets of the sample. In the stroke pedigrees, evidence of major-locus inheritance was not found; polygenic heritability was estimated as .647. In the HDFP pedigrees, estimates of tau1 = .987, tau2 = .430, tau3 = .506 differed significantly from Mendelian transmission; the inferred model consisted of a mixture of two distributions incompatible with both Mendelian and environmental transmission but compatible with polygenic inheritance within distributions. In the coronary pedigrees, the hypothesis of Mendelian transmission could not be rejected. In the coronary pedigrees, the evidence supported an incompletely recessive allele with a frequency of .227 which elevated the level of SLC to a mean of .530 mmol/liter RBC/h.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

We have studied the linkage disequilibrium between four polymorphic markers from this locus (KM.19, CS.7, XV-2c, and PT-3) and the CF mutation (CF) in 127 Italian families. Strong linkage disequilibrium is found between KM.19, CS.7, and CF, and weaker but significant disequilibrium is found between XV-2c, PT-3, and CF. The disequilibrium between markers and CF for the Italian population provides additional information on the origin and homogeneity of the CF defect. This panel of probes is sufficiently informative to permit accurate prenatal diagnosis of CF in most families with an affected person, and the disequilibrium also allows indirect carrier detection/exclusion in some cases.\r"

Previous studies have incorporated the first effect into genetic models for analyzing multipoint data. An extension to this approach is presented which allows for the second component of interference by modeling the probability density function of the locations of multiple crossovers. Results of reanalyses of multilocus data for the Drosophila X chromosome show that models that incorporate only the first effect give a better fit to these data than do standard mapping functions and that the extended model significantly improved the fit by decreasing the predicted frequency of multiple crossovers in nearby regions. Our results demonstrate that chiasma-based models of multilocus recombination, which are unique in incorporating direct estimates of the frequency of multiple crossovers for a chromosome region, can provide a powerful and realistic means of accounting for genetic interference when applied to the problems of gene localization, locus ordering, and exclusion mapping.\r"

The variant C-band regions measure two to three times the length of their homologues. The centromeric regions of the variant chromosome 6 and its homologue are not significantly elongated by adding 5-azacytidine to culture. We determined that the amount of the alphoid centromeric repeat 308 (DZ61), which is chromosome 6 specific, is amplified two- to threefold in the genomes of individuals with the 6ph+ variants. In situ hybridization localized the increase in 308 repeats to the 6ph+ region. These results suggest an association between amplification of chromosome-specific alphoid sequences and enlargement of specific C-band regions.\r"

  ".U": "88238552\r", 
  ".W": "X-linked hypohidrotic ectodermal dysplasia (H.E.D.) is a disorder of abnormal morphogenesis of ectodermal structures and is of unknown pathogenesis. Neither relatively accurate carrier detection nor prenatal diagnosis has been available. Previous localization of the disorder by linkage analysis utilizing restriction-fragment polymorphisms, by our group and others, has placed the disorder in the general pericentromeric region. We have extended our previous study by analyzing 36 families by means of 10 DNA probes at nine marker loci and have localized the disorder to the region Xq11-Xq21.1, probably Xq12-Xq13. Three loci--DXS159 (theta = .01, z = 14.84), PGK1 (theta = .02, z = 13.44), and DXS72 (theta = .02, z = 11.38)--show very close linkage to the disorder, while five other pericentromeric loci (DXS146, DXS14, DXYS1, DXYS2, and DXS3) display significant but looser linkage. Analysis of the linkage data yields no significant evidence for nonallelic heterogeneity for the X-linked form of the disorder. Both multipoint analysis and examination of multiply informative meioses with known phase establish that the locus for H.E.D. is flanked on one side by the proximal long arm loci DXYS1, DXYS2, and DXS3 and on the other side by the short arm loci DXS146 and DXS14. Multipoint mapping could not resolve the order of H.E.D. and the three tightly linked loci. This order can be inferred from published data on physical mapping of marker loci in the pericentromeric region, which have utilized somatic cell hybrid lines established from a female with severe manifestations of H.E.D., and an X/9 translocation (breakpoint Xq13.1). If one assumes that the breakpoint of the translocation is within the locus for H.E.D. and that there has not been a rearrangement in the hybrid line, then DXS159 would be proximal to the disorder and PGK1 and DXS72 would be distal to the disorder. Both accurate carrier detection and prenatal diagnosis are now feasible in a majority of families at risk for the disorder.\r"

Serum samples were obtained simultaneously with tissue samples. Concentrations of each drug in serum and tissue were measured by high-pressure liquid chromatography. In both experiments, the composite drug concentration profile as a function of time in serum was consistent with that observed in nonsurgical patients; that is, a half-life of approximately 3.5 hours and 0.8 hours for cefotetan and cefoxitin, respectively. This also was true of tissue kinetics, in that tissue profiles appeared parallel to, but somewhat lower than, serum. At 20 minutes after administration, the peak myometrium concentration was 158 micrograms/g for cefotetan, and the corresponding serum concentration was 298 micrograms/ml. For cefoxitin, the corresponding values were 66 micrograms/g and 101 micrograms/ml. At 47 minutes, the cefotetan tissue and serum concentrations were 29 micrograms/g and 235 micrograms/ml respectively, and the corresponding values for cefoxitin were 15 micrograms/g and 43 micrograms/ml. Similar relationships were observed with these drugs in colorectal tissue. Although both antibiotics provide good concentrations during the early phase of surgery, cefotetan's concentrations persisted longer, which may be relevant in the prevention of infection in prolonged surgical procedures.\r"

Unactivated murine peritoneal macrophages were infected with the virulent RH strain of T. gondii. The activity of the macrolides was first measured with [3H]uracil, which is incorporated by the parasite but not the host cell. The 50% inhibitory concentrations (IC50s) and 95% confidence limits were calculated at 54 (38 to 73), 140 (98 to 201), 147 (101 to 214), and 246 (187 to 325) micron for roxithromycin, azithromycin (CP-62,993), A-56268, and spiramycin, respectively. Inhibition of Toxoplasma growth was confirmed by microscopic examination of the infected macrophages after treatment with roxithromycin. Compared with untreated controls, roxithromycin concentrations near the IC50s decreased the number of infected cells, the number of tachyzoites per vacuole, and the number of cells containing rosettes (i.e., clusters of more than eight tachyzoites). After treatment with the four macrolides, tachyzoites were released from the macrophages and subcultured in HeLa cells, which are nonprofessional phagocytes, to assess the viability of the remaining parasites. This showed that the macrolides at concentrations corresponding to four times their 90% inhibitory concentrations (IC90s) had no significant killing effect. At 8 times the IC90, roxithromycin showed an incomplete killing effect, similar to that of the combination of pyrimethamine (0.41 microM)-sulfadiazine (99.42 microM). All macrolides tested showed inhibitory effects against intracellular T. gondii, but amounts of azithromycin and A-56268 corresponding to the IC90 appeared to be toxic against the host macrophages, which might have had nonspecific activity against Toxoplasma metabolism.\r"

  ".W": "This study was designed to determine the role of leukotriene C4 (LTC4) in the formation of acute gastric lesions induced by 100% ethanol, acidified taurocholate (TC), acidified aspirin (ASA), platelet-activating factor (PAF), and water-immersion and restraint stress. Exogenous LTC4 alone administered in gradually increasing doses (5-20 micrograms/kg/hr) caused only mild hemorrhagic lesions in the gastric mucosa but when combined with 100% ethanol, acidified TC, acidified ASA, or stress, it increased significantly the mean lesion area and lesion number as compared to those produced by these ulcerogens alone. FPL 55712, a LTC4 antagonist, given orally (2.5-10 mg/kg) reduced dose-dependently the extent of gastric lesions in all experimental models used and completely prevented the deleterious effects of exogenous LTC4 on gastric mucosa. PAF augmented the mucosal lesions induced by 100% ethanol, and this was also reduced by the pretreatment with FPL 55712. FPL 55712-induced gastroprotection against various ulcerogens was reversed, in part, by indomethacin, indicating that it could be attributed not only to the LTC4 antagonism but also to increased biosynthesis of PGs. This study provides evidence that LTC4 is involved in the formation of acute gastric damage and the antagonism of LTC4 may protect the mucosa against various ulcerogens.\r"

Up to 8 hr following a single oral load of 20% alcohol (v/v; 4 g/kg body weight), the PGE2 synthesis in isolated microsomes from rat stomach remained unchanged as compared with control values. Feeding a liquid alcohol-containing diet (37% of total Joules) for 1, 6, or 12 weeks significantly decreased the rate of PGE2 synthesis (percentage inhibition as compared with control values 39, 27, and 57, respectively). In addition, chronic alcohol feeding led to a drop in the tissue content of PGE2, the decrease being more pronounced after 6 (-49%) and 12 (-58%) weeks than after 1 week (-24%). The results suggest that the inhibition of endogenous PGE2 synthesis in the stomach following ingestion of appreciable quantities of alcohol might play a role in the pathogenesis of alcohol-induced injury of the gastric mucosa.\r"

  ".W": "Leukotrienes have been suggested to play a role in the endotoxin-induced changes of the pulmonary hemodynamics and airway mechanics. Since Ca2+ is necessary for contraction of airway and vascular smooth muscle as well as for activation of phospholipase A2 and 5-lipoxygenase enzymes, we wondered whether the calcium antagonist verapamil would modify the endotoxin-mediated pulmonary effects as well as the generation of circulating eicosanoids. In twelve conscious sheep, measurements of pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR), systemic vascular resistance (SVR), lung resistance (RL), arterial PO2 (PaO2), leukocyte (WBC) count, arterial thromboxane B2 (TxB2), prostaglandin (PG) F2 alpha, and 6-ketoprostaglandin F1 alpha (6-keto-PGF1 alpha) concentrations were obtained before and at predetermined intervals after a 10-min infusion of Escherichia coli endotoxin (0.3 microgram/kg). On separate occasions, the sheep received a bolus injection of verapamil (150 micrograms/kg) before endotoxin, followed by a continuous infusion of verapamil [10 micrograms.kg-1.min-1 (n = 5) or 20 micrograms.kg-1.min-1 (n = 7)] for up to 4 h post-endotoxin. Endotoxin caused a biphasic response with an increase in mean PVR and RL to 326 and 276% of base line during phase I (0-1 h) and lesser increases to 177 and 157% of base line during phase II (1.5-4 h), respectively (P less than 0.05). SVR also showed biphasic increases of 44 and 42% during phase I and II, respectively. Mean PaO2 decreased by 16 Torr and WBC count decreased from 6.4 +/- 1.5 to 3.3 +/- 1.1 thousand/mm3, associated with marked increases in plasma TxB2, PGF2 alpha, and 6-keto-PGF1 alpha.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

When mean plasma GH was elevated above 12.0 +/- 0.6 (+/- SE) micrograms/L, plasma IGF-I/SmC concentrations were uniformly high, but a decline of mean plasma GH below this value was accompanied by a linear decrease in IGF-I/SmC concentrations (r = 0.89; P less than 0.001). Even mildly abnormal mean GH concentrations (greater than 4.6 but less than 10 micrograms/L) were accompanied by high plasma IGF-I/SmC values. The log dose-response interrelation between mean 24-h plasma GH and IGF-I/SmC concentrations was linear (r = 0.86; P less than 0.001). We conclude that 1) an excellent log dose-response correlation between mean 24-h plasma GH and IGF-I/SmC concentrations is present in patients with acromegaly; 2) normalization of plasma IGF-I/SmC occurs only in patients with mean daily GH output within the normal range; and 3) determination of plasma IGF-I/SmC is an accurate indicator of normalcy of GH secretion and should be used in the diagnosis of active acromegaly as well as in monitoring the progress of therapy.\r"

Data for a large (approximately 10,000), homogenous group of subscribers are presented and discussed. Faced with a dual option, at no cost to the employee, 60% of the subscribers chose the fee-for-service plan, and 40% chose the capitation plan. Observed differences in the utilization and mix of services between the two plans cannot be explained solely in terms of dentists' responses. Employee response to altered economic incentives appears to be strong.\r"

Hairy leukoplakia occurs predominantly on the tongue as in the patient described. The typical presentation is easily diagnosed but atypical cases may be diagnosed by their lack of response to antifungal treatment and histological exclusion of other lesions. The natural history of hairy leukoplakia needs further study.

We have recently analyzed the affect of single amino acid substitutions on the I-Ad binding of the immunogenic peptide OVA 323-339. The results obtained demonstrated the very permissive nature of Ag-Ia interaction. We also showed that unrelated peptides that are good I-Ad binders share a common structural motif and speculated that recognition of such motifs could represent a mechanism to achieve a very permissive type of interaction that yet retained some degree of specificity. In the present set of experiments we analyzed the I-Ad binding pattern of a series of overlapping peptides derived from sperm whale myoglobin (residues 102-125) and influenza hemagglutinin (residues 121-146) to determine whether the peptide regions predicted on the basis of structural similarity to be involved in I-Ad binding were in fact involved. In both cases, the I-Ad-interacting determinants were found to contain the sequence motif postulated to be important for I-Ad binding. These data support the hypothesis that I-Ad molecules recognize a large library of Ag by virtue of common structural motifs present in peptides derived from phylogenetically unrelated proteins.\r"

Mean AChE activity was significantly reduced in cerebral (-51% to 65%) and cerebellar (-47%) cortex with a less severe change (-37%) in the hippocampus. The magnitude of the enzyme reduction in cerebral cortex was equal to or greater than that reported in brain of demented Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease patients having loss of AChE-containing nucleus basalis cholinergic neurons. It is concluded that the data provide additional biochemical evidence suggesting a cerebral cortical cholinergic denervation in OPCA.\r"

The fibers of the upper and lower heads were found to be fused in front of the TMJ and to constitute medially a strong muscular wall. The lateral third of the anterior band of the disc was free of any muscle insertions and related anteriorly with loose connective tissue; the middle third showed fibers that run under the anterior band of the disc and attached in the upper part of the condylar fovea. Only the medial portion demonstrated both fibers running into the disc and fibers inserting into the bone. The fibers inserted into the bone run under those attached into the disc and terminated below the medial pole of the condyle binding the disc tightly over the medial pole. This study demonstrates that the main insertions of the superior head are not into the disc but into the condyle. Considering the anatomic organization of the upper head, the explanation of anterior displacement of the disc due to a spastic activity of this muscle alone is not probable. Hypotonicity, not hyperactivity, of the upper head may contribute to an anterior and medial disc displacement.\r"

The major changes in PG levels were increased levels of PGD2 and 6-keto-PGF1 alpha that persisted from 18 hours until 10 days after injury. The ratio between TXB2 and 6-keto-PGF1 alpha, which reflects the vascular tone, increased during the early postinjury period (15 minutes and 1 hour) and decreased later, up to 10 days. Thus, a sustained imbalance in favor of the vasodilator is apparent; this may suggest an improved blood supply to the region. Both PGD2 and PGI2 have protective effects in the brain. We suggest that their endogenous increase may be part of a repair mechanism at the periphery of the injured zone.\r"

The serum CA 125 concentration was also measured in each patient to evaluate its efficacy in the diagnosis of endometriosis recurrence. The patients with stages I and II endometriosis had serum CA 125 levels not significantly higher than in the patients with negative findings, whereas those with stages III and IV endometriosis presented significantly higher levels (P less than .005 and P less than .001, respectively) than the disease-free women. The sensitivity of serum CA 125 measurements in the diagnosis of endometriosis recurrence was 14.8%, the specificity was 100%, and the predictive values of normal (less than 35 U/mL) and elevated levels were 27 and 100%, respectively. In some cases, serum CA 125 measurements may be used instead of follow-up laparoscopy, or to indicate when laparoscopy should be performed or postponed.\r"

  ".W": "Serum CA 125 levels were assayed from 44 normal healthy women, 153 patients with benign pelvic masses, and 58 patients with malignant pelvic masses. CA 125 levels were less than 35 U/mL in 42 of the 44 normal women and were greater than 35 but less than 65 U/mL in the other two women. Among 153 patients with benign pelvic masses, CA 125 levels greater than 35, 65, or 194 U/mL were detected in 61 (39.9%), 31 (20.3%), and eight (5.2%) patients, respectively. Of 58 patients with malignant pelvic masses, CA 125 results were greater than 35, 65, or 194 U/mL in 48 (82.8%), 45 (77.6%), and 38 (65.5%), respectively. Among the latter group, the positivity rates of 30 patients with epithelial ovarian cancers were 100, 93, and 80%, respectively. This study suggests that defining positive serum CA 125 levels as those greater than 35 U/mL is of limited clinical value because there is a 39.9% false-positive rate in patients with benign disease. However, serum CA 125 values greater than 65 U/mL may be considered positive in clinically normal women. Serum CA 125 greater than 194 U/mL, representing the units at the 95th percentile for 153 patients with benign pelvic masses, is defined as a new positivity criterion, and could be used to differentiate malignant tumors from benign pelvic masses.\r"

Furthermore, prodynorphin-derived [Leu]enkephalin-Arg6-containing polypeptides were significantly increased in samples from pregnant women (P less than .05).

  ".W": "Chimpanzees are susceptible to infection by divergent strains of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), none of which cause clinical or immunological abnormalities. Chimpanzees were inoculated with one of four strains of HIV-1: human T-lymphotropic virus (HTLV) type IIIB, lymphadenopathy virus (LAV) type 1, HTLV type IIIRF, or an isolate from the brain of a patient with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. Within 6 months after inoculation with the closely related strains HTLV-IIIB or LAV-1, six chimpanzees developed serum antibodies to the C-terminal half (amino acids 288-467) of the HTLV-IIIB external envelope glycoprotein gp120. Sera from five of those chimpanzees had HTLV-IIIB cell-fusion-inhibiting antibody titers greater than or equal to 20 at that time, indicating that they neutralized the infecting strain of HIV-1 in vitro. No antibodies to the carboxyl terminus of HTLV-IIIB gp120 were observed in sera of chimpanzees inoculated with HTLV-IIIRF or with the brain-tissue strain, and those sera did not neutralize HTLV-IIIB. A rabbit immunized with the C-terminal portion of gp120 acquired neutralizing antibodies that bound to four domains of the HTLV-IIIB external envelope as analyzed by reactivity to 536 overlapping nonapeptides of gp120. One of these domains in the variable region V3, with the amino acid sequence IRIQRGPGRAFVTIG (amino acids 307-321), bound to all chimpanzee sera that neutralized HTLV-IIIB but not to the serum of the HTLV-IIIRF-inoculated chimpanzee that did not neutralize HTLV-IIIB. The HTLV-IIIRF sequence at the same location, ITKGPGRVIYA, was recognized by the serum of the HTLV-IIIRF-inoculated chimpanzee but not by any sera of the HTLV-IIIB-inoculated or LAV-1-inoculated chimpanzees. The HTLV-IIIB residues RIQR and AFV and the HTLV-IIIRF residues lysine and VIYA, flanking a highly conserved beta-turn (GPGR), appear to be critical for antibody binding and subsequent type-specific virus neutralization. This neutralization epitope, putatively consisting of a loop between two cysteine residues (amino acids 296 and 331) connected by a disulfide bond, is immunodominant in HIV-1-infected chimpanzees and induces antibodies restricted to the homologous viral strain.\r"

Our study was designed to determine the delivered volumes of gas using cannulae and oxygen sources recommended in previous reports on translaryngeal jet ventilation. From this, we hope to clarify the proper technique of translaryngeal jet ventilation. Using a variety of oxygen sources and cannulae, peak flow rates were measured using a digital flowmeter. Delivered volumes of gases generated with each combination were then calculated. All of the cannulae tested (standard 16-gauge IV cannulae and larger) provided peak flow rates high enough so that predicted tidal volumes would be adequate to maintain adequate ventilation in apneic adults when a 50-psi source was used. Only a 4-mm tracheal cannula provided comparable values when a bag-valve device was used. No cannulae provided sufficient flow rates to ensure adequate ventilation in apneic adults when a demand-valve mechanism of 60 cm H2O driving pressure served as the source. Our observations were consistent with previous clinical studies and suggest that standard translaryngeal jet ventilation cannulae (12 to 16 gauge) must be connected to an oxygen source of 50 psi in apneic adults. Demand-valve devices do not provide sufficient driving pressures for these cannulae. A cannula of 4 mm ID should be placed if only a bag-valve device is available for ventilation.\r"

PGE binding sites were of high affinity (Kd 1.5 nM) and highly specific for PG of the E series, suggesting that they represent true PGE receptors. The concentration of PGE receptors was higher in non-pregnant than in pregnant uteri at term. In non-pregnant uteri the concentration of PGE receptors was highest in the fundus and decreased towards the cervix; in term pregnant uteri the concentration was constant in all areas. In both non-pregnant and pregnant uteri there was a significantly lower PGE binding affinity in cervix than in myometrium from the fundus-corpus area. The concentrations and affinity of PGE receptors were similar during the proliferative and secretory phases of the menstrual cycle and were not influenced by age of the patient.

All the tumors were located in the head of the pancreas, and the clue to the diagnosis was jaundice in ten patients and abdominal pain in seven. Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and CA 19-9 were not reliable markers for detecting small carcinomas of the pancreas. Ultrasonography (US), computerized tomography (CT), percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography (PTC), and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) were useful diagnostic tools. Lymph node metastases were found in 41% of affected patients, capsular invasion in 24%, retroperitoneal invasion in 24%, and portal system involvement in 29%. In five patients the carcinoma was Stage I; in eight patients, Stage II; in two patients, Stage III, and in two patients, Stage IV. Fifteen patients with Stages I to III and one patient with Stage IV underwent curative pancreaticoduodenectomy or total pancreatectomy, and one patient with liver metastasis and Stage IV underwent noncurative pancreaticoduodenectomy. The cumulative 4-year survival rate was 37%. Although four patients with Stage I disease lived for more than 48 months, the survival period of the 12 patients with Stages II to IV disease was less than 25 months. Thus, small carcinoma of the pancreas is not always curable; however, a small, localized lesion without any extratumoral extension can be resected with a chance of cure.\r"

All patients were previously untreated. Radical surgery, in general ablative when possible, was the primary treatment goal throughout this period. A number of clinical and pathologic variables were tested in the model to elucidate their prognostic importance. Tumors localized to the trunk, pelvis, or femur, and symptom duration of less than 6 months were poor prognostic signs. Tumors dominated by fibroblastic cells and a patient age of approximately 25 to 30 years were associated with an especially good prognosis. The prognosis worsened with advancing age. Children, adolescents, and adults ages 5 to 25 years had significantly poorer prognosis than young adults 25 to 30 years of age. Sex, radiologic appearance, and year of referral had no significant prognostic value in this series. Based on the regression model, a prognostic index is derived and survival is calculated for a good and a poor prognostic case. The overall 10-year survival with one standard deviation was 28.6 +/- 3.5%. Cancer deaths continue to occur 10 years after initial treatment, and the estimated hazard rate is still four times greater than that of a sex- and age-matched group of healthy individuals.\r"

  ".W": "It is well documented that injury to bone marrow is followed by an osteogenic phase that precedes the complete tissue regeneration. We have recently shown that postablation healing of bone marrow in rat tibiae is associated with a systemic increase in osteogenesis. It was hypothesized that a growth factor(s) with an effect on osteogenic cells is produced in the healing limb, is transferred to the blood circulation, and enhances osteogenesis systemically. To test growth factor production, healing bone marrow-conditioned medium was prepared with tissue separated from rat tibias during the osteogenic phase and assayed for enhancement of mitogenic activity in culture of osteogenic rat osteosarcoma cells (ROS 17/2). Partial purification of healing bone marrow-conditioned medium-derived growth factor(s) consisted of gel filtration on Sephadex G-25, boiling, chromatography on heparin-Sepharose, and gel filtration on Sephadex G-75. Mitogenic activity eluted in the void volume of the Sephadex G-25 column (mol wt greater than 5,000). Potent activity resolved from heparin-Sepharose with PBS, and on filtration by Sephadex G-75 this activity recovered in 3 peaks with mol wt estimates of 35,000, 19,000, and less than 10,000. The partially purified factor also showed considerable stimulatory effect on DNA synthesis in osteoblastic fetal rat calvarial cells and on in vitro elongation of fetal long bone; it had only a small effect on nonosteoblastic ROS and fetal rat calvarial cells. These data indicate that healing bone marrow produces growth factor activity with a preferential effect on osteogenic cells. It is suggested that local growth factors have a role as mediators in the sequence of events whereby bone marrow expresses its osteogenic potential. During postablation healing of bone marrow these factors may also function as systemic promoters to osteogenic cells.\r"

Migration of limited amounts of acrosin to the sperm surface was the earliest event characterizing the beginning of the acrosome reaction. The acrosome of such spermatozoa remained morphologically intact, swelled, or showed intraacrosomal vesiculation without any disruption of the plasma and acrosomal membrane integrity. Massive release of acrosin coincided with the fusion of the plasma and outer acrosomal membranes. However, even fully acrosome-reacted spermatozoa always retained some acrosin on the exposed inner acrosomal membrane and in the equatorial segment of the acrosome. This residual acrosin was also detected on spermatozoa within the zona pellucida of human oocytes inseminated in vitro, while the previously released bulk of acrosin remained attached to the surface of the zona pellucida at the site of sperm entry. These findings are compatible with multiple functions of acrosin in human sperm-egg interaction, including sperm-zona pellucida binding, dispersal of acrosomal contents, and facilitation of zona pellucida penetration.\r"

  ".W": "Vascular cell procoagulant activity may be important in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. In previous studies, we described the ability of the atherogenic metabolite homocysteine to activate endothelial cell Factor V, a key coagulation cofactor for thrombin generation. The present study was designed to investigate Factor V activity and Factor Xa-catalyzed prothrombin activation by control and atherosclerotic aorta from normal and hypercholesterolemic rabbits. Factor Xa generated ninefold more thrombin on atherosclerotic aortic segments than on control segments. Atherosclerotic segments activated 125I-prothrombin with Factor Xa in the presence of the thrombin inhibitor dansyl arginine-4-ethylpiperidine amide and cleaved 125I-Factor V. This suggests that increases in vessel-wall Factor V activity and Factor Xa-catalyzed prothrombin activation result from activation of vessel-wall Factor V. 125I-Factor Va peptides generated by atherosclerotic aorta were very similar in molecular weight to those generated by homocysteine-treated cells. When vascular endothelium was mechanically removed by brushing, atherosclerotic vessels still generated four- to fivefold more thrombin than control vessels. These data and results from immunocytochemical studies suggest that Factor V in atherosclerotic vessels is associated with both endothelium and other cells of the lesion. In contrast, Factor V in control vessels is associated primarily with endothelium. The increases in Factor V activity and thrombin formation in the blood vessel wall of hypercholesterolemic rabbits may contribute to the development of atherosclerosis and its complications.\r"

This resulted in no loss of either sensitivity or specificity. Pooling 10 samples resulted in a loss of sensitivity for low antibody titre specimens. Pooling reduced the costs of screening by 70% and time needed for analysis. It is concluded that pooling of five samples for HIV screening may result in a substantial reduction in costs; in countries where the prevalence of HIV is higher than the 2-3% found in Zimbabwean donors, however, savings may not be as great.\r"

Seven patients developed multiple hyperostoses at the spine and extremities. Hyperostoses increased in size and number over the course of therapy, although relatively few sites were symptomatic. Hyperostoses typically developed first in the spine and later in the extremities, where both bilaterally symmetric and asymmetric involvement was observed. After 5 years of therapy one patient did not develop hyperostosis. In a group of nine patients who received a relatively high dose of isotretinoin in 1982 for the treatment of acne, two patients developed tiny, asymptomatic hyperostoses. One patient had hyperostoses 1 year after isotretinoin therapy, which remained unchanged 3 years later, whereas the other patient had one hyperostosis 4 years after therapy had been stopped. Although we suspect that these hyperostoses were retinoid induced, they should not be of concern for the patient needing routine isotretinoin therapy for the treatment of cystic acne.\r"

This TNF-mediated effect is augmented by several substances that raise the intracellular concentration of cAMP, including PGE2, cholera toxin, and dibutyryl-cAMP. TNF also stimulates the endogenous production of PGE2 in cultures of peritoneal macrophages. The addition of the cyclo-oxygenase inhibitor, indomethacin, suppresses the TNF-mediated metabolic activation of macrophages, and this suppressive effect of indomethacin is overcome if exogenous PGE2 or cholera toxin is added to the culture. Taken together, the experiments indicate that the TNF-induced production of PGE2 and the PGE2-induced increase of the intracellular cAMP concentration are essential elements of an auto-regulatory loop that controls the magnitude of the TNF-mediated effect in the macrophage.\r"

  ".W": "This study demonstrates that an inflammatory response caused by the injection of pristane into the peritoneal cavity of mice provides a useful system for rapid induction of myeloid tumors by retroviruses. Two such tumors, which developed in the peritoneal cavity with average latencies of 68 to 71 d and incidences of greater than 50%, are 1) the McML, mature monocyte-macrophage tumors induced by retroviral constructs containing exons 2 and 3 of c-myc cDNA, and 2) the MML, promonocytic tumors induced by Moloney murine leukemia virus infection and its integration into the c-myb locus. Development of both neoplasms is clearly dependent on the intense i.p. inflammatory response, inasmuch as mice given the viruses and not pristane fail to develop these tumors. Although both types of tumors appear in the peritoneal cavity, the MML tumors that arise by i.v. injection of Moloney murine leukemia virus may actually originate via infection, and perhaps transformation, of precursor hemopoietic cells outside the peritoneal cavity, followed by migration of the cells to the peritoneal cavity. This is suggested by the fact that i.v.v but not i.p. injection of virus is an efficient method of producing these particular myeloid tumors. Although both McML and MML tumors require the inflammatory environment for their development, treatment of mice with a nonsteroid anti-inflammatory drug, indomethacin, has no effect on McML monocyte/macrophage tumors but completely prevents the development of the MML promonocyte tumors.\r"

  ".W": "This investigation compares the anticoagulant activities and in vivo disposition characteristics of N-deacetylated heparin and N-desulfated heparin with those of standard heparin in an animal model. The N-deacetylated heparin retained 23% of the anticoagulant activity, 34% of the anti-Xa activity and 23% of the anti-IIa activity of standard heparin, whereas the N-desulfated heparin retained only 1.5% of the anticoagulant activity, 0.095% of the anti-Xa activity and 0.92% of the anti-IIa activity of the original heparin. After i.v. injections of 5 mg/kg of the modified heparins, both N-deacetylated and N-deacetylated heparin concentrations showed monoexponential declines with time. The elimination half-lives were similar, 11.7 +/- 3.8 and 13.5 +/- 5.2 min, respectively (N.S.). There were, however, significant differences in both total clearance (Cl) and apparent volume of distribution (Vd) for these heparins, both parameters being significantly larger for the N-deacetylated heparin (P = .0007). The Cl values were 4.15 +/- 1.11 and 0.58 +/- 0.26 ml/min/kg and the Vd values were 72.1 +/- 38.7 and 9.9 +/- 2.4 ml/kg for the N-deacetylated and N-desulfated heparins, respectively. We have reported previously that after a similar dose of standard heparin the elimination half-life was 69.0 +/- 13.1 min, Cl was 0.64 +/- 0.16 ml/min/kg and Vd was 62.6 +/- 16.7 ml/kg. These studies have thus demonstrated that selective N-deacetylation and N-desulfation of the glucosamine residues of heparin affect markedly both its anticoagulant activity and in vivo disposition characteristics. Although important for full anticoagulant activity of heparin, the N-acetyl groups are apparently not essential.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Distinguishing peritonsillar abscess from cellulitis is an important clinical problem, particularly in children, who may require a general anesthetic for drainage of these abscesses. In order to identify those clinical factors most significant for peritonsillar abscess, we did a prospective study of 21 patients who presented with sore throat, fever, trismus, and tonsillar bulge; all symptoms that are consistent with the diagnosis of peritonsillar abscess. On admission, the following parameters were recorded: patient age, duration of sore throat, fever, white blood cell count, drooling, the degree of trismus (measured exactly as incisor-incisor distance), the degree of pharyngotonsillar bulge, and change in voice. After 24 to 48 hours of parenteral antibiotics, 12 patients (57%) had improved sufficiently and were continued on antibiotics until resolution (cellulitis group). Nine patients (43%) had no improvement and underwent surgery for drainage of the peritonsillar abscess (abscess group). At the end of the 18-month study period, the cellulitis and abscess groups were compared. On admission, no significant difference was found in age, duration of sore throat, fever, or white blood cell count. The pharyngotonsillar bulge was mild in 58% and moderate in 42% of the cellulitis group, while in the abscess group, the pharyngotonsillar bulge was mild in only 33% and moderate in 67%. After 24 to 48 hours of parenteral antibiotics, all patients in the cellulitis group had improvement of at least one symptom; whereas, all patients in the abscess group had no change or worsening of at least one symptom, including trismus, dysphagia, voice change, drooling, or pharyngotonsillar bulge. On admission, the precise measurement of trismus was not significantly different in the two groups (24.7 mm in cellulitis group vs. 22.5 mm in abscess group). However, after 24 hours of antibiotics, trismus averaged 7 mm more in the abscess group versus the cellulitis group (p less than 0.05).\r"

This methylation also prevented expression and induction of the gene in mouse erythroleukemia cells. By using partially methylated hybrid molecules, it was shown that methylation-sensitive negative regulatory elements are located in both the 5' and 3' ends of the beta-globin gene but not in the 90-base-pair region usually associated with promoter activity. To further investigate the role of DNA methylation in the regulation of the beta-globin gene, 50-base-pair poly(dG-dC) tracts were introduced into various sites in a mouse-human hybrid gene, and these inserts were methylated by means of the Hha I methylase. Heavy methylation of these artificially added sites had no effect on either transcription initiation or elongation, suggesting that DNA modification operates through fixed endogenous sites in the gene domain.\r"

However, it has been difficult to exclude the possibility that PrP purified from scrapie tissues might be contaminated with a more conventional viral agent. To obtain PrP uncontaminated by scrapie-infected tissues, PrP cDNA cloned from a scrapie-infected mouse brain was expressed in mouse C127 cells in vitro. mRNA and protein encoded by the cloned PrP gene were identified. The expressed PrP polypeptides appeared to be glycosylated and were released from the cell surface into the medium. Homogenates of the cells expressing the cloned PrP gene were inoculated into susceptible mice but failed to induce clinical signs of scrapie. Thus, either PrP is not the transmissible agent of scrapie or the expressed PrP requires additional modification to be infectious.\r"

The haplotype in question is defined by the restriction fragment length polymorphisms for the D21S1/D21S11 loci. Our results obtained on a sample of Northern Italian families with the occurrence of trisomy 21 (Down syndrome) failed to support this hypothesis, contradicting a previous study [Antonarakis, S. E., Kittur, S. D., Metaxotou, C., Watkins, P. C. & Patel, A. S. (1985) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 82, 3360-3364]. These findings rule out an association between any specific D21S1/D21S11 haplotype (as well as other haplotypes for the D21S13, ETS2, and D21S23 loci) and a putative cis-acting genetic element favoring the meiotic missegregation of chromosome 21. For this reason, no preventive screening for couples at risk for trisomy 21 may be based on any of the haplotypes tested.\r"

The experiments reported here investigate whether submicroscopic amplification units are present in early passages of the human tumor cell lines HL-60 and COLO 320. The results show that such cells do contain submicroscopic, extrachromosomal, supercoiled circular molecules harboring MYC genes. The molecules in HL-60 are approximately 250 kilobase pairs (kbp), while those in COLO 320 are 120-160 kbp. The extrachromosomal molecules in HL-60 are shown to replicate semiconservatively and approximately once in one cell cycle. We propose that these submicroscopic elements are precursors of double-minute chromosomes, the usual extrachromosomal manifestation of gene amplification, since both are structurally similar and replicate autonomously.\r"

The latter are either uncommitted to B- or T-cell lineage or committed to only the earliest stages of B- or T-lymphocyte maturation. To elucidate to homogeneity, obtained the NH2-terminal sequence from both the intact protein and derived tryptic and V8 protease peptides and isolated CALLA cDNAs from a Nalm-6 cell line lambda gt10 library using redundant oligonucleotide probes. The CALLA cDNA sequence predicts a 750-amino acid integral membrane protein with a single 24-amino acid hydrophobic segment that could function as both a transmembrane region and a signal peptide. The COOH-terminal 700 amino acids, including six potential N-linked glycosylation sites compose the extracellular protein segment, whereas the 25 NH2-terminal amino acids remaining after cleavage of the initiation methionine form the cytoplasmic tail. CALLA+ cells contain CALLA transcripts of 2.7 to 5.7 kilobases with the major 5.7- and 3.7-kilobase mRNAs being preferentially expressed in specific cell types.\r"

  ".W": "The association of foreign antigen with Ia molecules on the surface of antigen-presenting cells is necessary for the interaction with the clonally distributed antigen receptor on T cells and is therefore critical in the initiation and regulation of immune responses. Ia polypeptides (alpha and beta) are composed of two extracellular domains, a transmembrane domain and a cytoplasmic domain. Although exon-shuffling experiments have demonstrated that antigen associates with the NH2-terminal alpha 1 and beta 1 domains, the roles that the other domains play in Ia function are still poorly understood. The B-hybridoma cell line 2B1 was selected in a series of positive and negative immunoselection steps for a mutation in the Ek alpha polypeptide. It was found to fortuitously contain a mutation in the Ak alpha polypeptide as well. Sequence analysis of the Ak alpha gene showed that a single base transition (C----T) resulted in a stop codon at amino acid residue 222. This caused the loss of 12 amino acids from the cytoplasmic domain of the mature polypeptide. This mutation results in a decreased level of Ak alpha polypeptide expression on the cell surface (50% of wild-type levels), an increased half-life of Ak alpha polypeptide in the cell, and a specific limited defect in antigen presentation.\r"

The role of polypeptide growth factors in the process of wound contraction was investigated by analyzing the influence of transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta), platelet-derived growth factor on the ability of fibroblasts to contract a collagen matrix in an in vitro system. TGF-beta, but not the other growth factors tested, markedly enhanced the ability of BHK-21,3T3-L1, and human foreskin fibroblasts to contract collagen gels. These results suggest that TGF-beta released from platelets and inflammatory cells at sites of tissue injury stimulates fibroblasts to contract the provisional wound matrix and that this effect contributes to the ability of TGF-beta to accelerate wound healing.\r"

Of the steroids tested, only testosterone exhibited significant cross-reactivity with estrogen binding. RNA blot analysis with a complementary DNA probe to the human estrogen receptor revealed putative receptor transcripts of 6 to 6.2 kilobases in both rat and human osteosarcoma cells. Type I procollagen and transforming growth factor-beta messenger RNA levels were enhanced in cultured human osteoblast-like cells treated with 1 nM estradiol. Thus, estrogen can act directly on osteoblasts by a receptor-mediated mechanism and thereby modulate the extracellular matrix and other proteins involved in the maintenance of skeletal mineralization and remodeling.\r"

This assertion was tested in a computer simulation experiment that used a database of 15,000 actual paternity cases to provide red cell and HLA phenotypes of mothers, children, and putative fathers. Tests had a combined probability of exclusion of 97.3 percent. Equal numbers of true and false fathers were generated from the data by computer to achieve a prior probability of paternity of 0.5. True fathers' phenotypes were those of unexcluded men from actual cases (Group A) or of mothers from actual cases (Group B) in which paternity was not excluded. The false father group was created by assigning the phenotypes of racially identical men who were selected at random from among cases other than their own. Probabilities of paternity were calculated for the men in each group and were classified into descriptive intervals. The frequency of men in each group was compared in each interval. The frequency distributions of probabilities of paternity for true fathers and unexcluded, falsely accused men (false fathers) were markedly dissimilar.\r"

  ".W": "PURPOSE: Human adult T-cell leukemia-lymphoma is a malignant, proliferative disease of CD4+ lymphocytes associated with infection with human T-cell lymphotropic virus type I (HTLV-I). Following the presentation of a patient who was infected with the virus, we undertook a study of his family members and sexual contacts to see if a cluster of infected persons could be identified. CASE REPORT: A black heterosexual North Carolina native with a history of drug abuse presented with jaundice, and pancytopenia subsequently developed. He then became hypercalcemic and leukemic, with high numbers of circulating, morphologically abnormal CD4+ lymphocytes. RESULTS: As determined by radioimmunoassay and immunoblot analyses, the serum of the index case contained antibodies against core proteins (p19 and p24) of HTLV-I. When cultured in vitro with interleukin-2, the lymphocytes expressed HTLV-I specific core proteins. The virus recovered from these T cells was transmitted to cord blood T cells, which became immortalized for continuous growth in vitro, expressed HTLV-I p19 protein, and displayed characteristic C-type particles by electron microscopy. Studies of family members and sexual contacts, all of whom were black, heterosexual central North Carolina natives, revealed five of 28 whose serum had anti-HTLV-I antibodies as determined by radioimmunoassay and immunoblot. Neither the patient nor the seropositive family/contacts had antibodies against human immunodeficiency virus proteins. Four of the six people with HTLV-I infection had no history of intravenous drug abuse. Three of the five seropositive family/contacts had circulating, morphologically abnormal lymphocytes suggestive of \"preleukemic\" or \"smoldering\" human adult T-cell leukemia-lymphoma.\r"

No increase of IOP was observed during the period. The effect of PGD2 was dose-dependent (0.4 microgram to 250 micrograms), and the minimum effective dose was estimated to be 2.0 micrograms. The application of PGD2 did not affect the pupil diameter. No sign of inflammatory response was observed by PGD2 application, that is, no hyperaemia, no flare, no irritation, and no increase of protein content in the aqueous humour. These results suggest that PGD2 or its analogues may be useful for treating glaucoma.\r"

During development of terminal blast crisis, successive blood samples showed a progressive decrease in the amount of germline bcr DNA and its complete loss by full blast crisis. There were also increased amounts of rearranged bcr DNA consistent with acquired homozygosity. A similar result was obtained with an IgV lambda probe and indicated homozygosity of a significant part of chromosome 22. The bcr-abl gene complex behaves as a somatic dominant in CML, and we suggest that its acquired homozygosity is a mechanism of bcr-abl amplification similar to duplication of the Ph chromosome commonly found in the blast crisis of CML.\r"

  ".W": "Chromosome analysis on clinical leukemia material was done by means of flow cytometry (flow karyotyping) to investigate the applicability of this technique in the detection of leukemia-associated abnormalities. Flow karyotyping was performed on blood or bone marrow samples from eight patients with chronic myelocytic leukemia (CML) after a culture period of four days and arresting the cells in metaphase during the last 16 hours. Discontinuous density gradient centrifugation proved to be essential in removing debris and dead cells from the cell suspensions. By this procedure the mitotic index increase ranged from 2 to 80 times initial values. Chromosomes were isolated and stained with two base pair-specific fluorochromes, ie, chromomycin A3 and Hoechst 33258, and run through a specially designed dual-laser beam flow cytometer. Generally, 20,000 chromosomes or more were measured. The data were computer stored in list mode. Besides the clear detection of the specific Philadelphia chromosome, trisomies and other additional chromosomal aberrations [like an i(17q)] were visualized. Quantitative analysis revealed the percentage of subclones containing a certain chromosomal anomaly. Conventional cytogenetic analysis confirmed these findings. In seven of eight cases, CML could be diagnosed on the basis of the presence of a Philadelphia chromosome in the flow karyogram. In one of these seven, the conventional cytogenetic analysis was unknown at that time. The remaining six all matched the standard cytogenetics. The one failure out of eight could be attributed to the specific stimulating conditions in the culture. Although it is impossible by this technique to determine the position of the breakpoint, the involved chromosomes in the translocation event could be identified. In some cases, low percentages of aberrations could not be detected. This study shows that CML can be diagnosed on the basis of flow karyotypic results. Additional chromosomal aberrations can be detected provided that changes in the amount of DNA per chromosome have occurred. Exact quantification of the composition of subclones in the case of mosaicism appear difficult.\r"

Twenty patients had reduplication of the Ph in one or more metaphases. Twenty-one patients with a single Ph exhibited hyperdiploidy in one or more metaphases. Eleven patients had two or more hypodiploid metaphases as their only numerical abnormality. The remaining six patients had a variety of abnormalities. Many patients had more than one type of abnormality. Survival of patients in the different subgroups was similar, but these 58 patients had a shorter course than the 603 patients without additional cytogenetic abnormalities (P less than .02). Survival curves for the two populations did not diverge until the 2-year point, after which the annual death rate among patients with additional cytogenetic abnormalities was approximately 40% higher than that of patients without such abnormalities. The two populations had similar relative risk values according to a hazard ratio formula previously described by the International CGL Prognosis Study Group. Thus, they would have been expected to have essentially identical survival curves. We conclude that the presence of additional cytogenetic abnormalities at the time of diagnosis constitutes an independently significant prognostic feature with an unusually delayed influence on survival.\r"

Extremely high levels of CA125 with low levels of both CEA and CA19-9 were demonstrated in the cervical mucus samples from women without gynecologic disorders and with leiomyoma. The cervical mucus samples from cervical adenocarcinomas showed low CA125 levels with extremely high CEA and/or CA19-9 levels. Therefore, analysis of the levels of these three tumor markers in the cervical mucus possibly helps in the diagnosis of cervical adenocarcinomas if CEA and/or CA19-9 show extremely high levels. When a ratio of (CEA + CA19-9)/CA125 was calculated, all women without gynecologic disorders and with leiomyoma showed a ratio less than 0.5, whereas ten of 11 cases of cervical adenocarcinomas had a ratio greater than or equal to 0.5. Only one case of microinvasive adenocarcinoma showed a ratio less than 0.5. Accordingly, the ratio greater than or equal to 0.5 strongly suggested an existence of cervical adenocarcinoma, although it included some cases of squamous cell carcinomas (four of 17 cases).\r"

Like some studies in other countries, excess risks for both acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) and acute nonlymphocytic leukemia (ANLL) were associated with intrauterine and paternal preconception diagnostic x-ray exposure, and with maternal employment in the chemical and agricultural industries during pregnancy. ANLL was linked to maternal occupational exposure to benzene during pregnancy, whereas both ALL and ANLL were significantly associated with maternal exposure to gasoline and the patient's prior use of chloramphenicol. New findings, previously unsuspected, included an association of ANLL with younger maternal age at menarche (odds ratio [OR] = 4.3; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.3-13.9); a protective effect for long-term (greater than 1 year) use of cod liver oil containing vitamins A and D for both ALL (OR = 0.4; 95% CI = 0.2-0.9) and ANLL (OR = 0.3; 95% CI = 0.1-1.0); and excess risks of ANLL among children whose mothers were employed in metal refining and processing (OR = 4.6; 95% CI = 1.3-17.2) and of ALL associated with maternal occupational exposure to pesticides (OR = 3.5; 95% CI = 1.1-11.2). No relationships were found with late maternal age, certain congenital disorders, or familial occurrence, which have been related to childhood leukemia in other studies. In contrast with other reports, an excess of leukemia, primarily ANLL, occurred among second or later-born rather than firstborn children.\r"

The aim of this study was to determine the effects of acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) on the electrical and mechanical activity of the ileum in anesthetized New Zealand White rabbits. Ileal electromechanical activity was recorded from serosal electrodes and a miniature intraluminal balloon. Thirty minutes after injection of ASA (30, 60 and 100 mg/kg intravenous) significant and dose-dependent increases in the percentage of slow waves with action potentials were observed when compared with saline-infected animals. The onset of action potentials correlated with phasic increases in intraluminal pressure, indicating the onset of circular muscle contractions. Injection of 15 mg/kg ASA, sodium salicylate (100 mg/kg intravenous) or saline had no effect on baseline action potential activity. Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) (5 and 10 micrograms/kg intravenous) significantly increased slow-wave frequency and decreased ASA-induced action potential activity. This study demonstrates that (1) ASA, but not sodium salicylate, stimulates phasic ileal action potential and contractile activity and (2) in ASA-treated animals, PGE2 produces differential effects on in vivo slow-wave frequency and action potential activity.\r"

Hypertension was induced in rats drinking 0.15 M NaCl by infusion of Ang II (125 ng/min i.p.) for 12 days. Relative to values in water-drinking rats without Ang II infusion, Ang II-salt hypertensive rats exhibited augmentation (p less than 0.05) of blood pressure (from 129 +/- 3 to 217 +/- 12 mm Hg), urinary thromboxane B2 excretion (from 5.4 +/- 0.9 to 25.4 +/- 2.1 ng/day), and thromboxane B2 release from renal cortex slices (from 71.3 +/- 6.7 to 121.1 +/- 14.4 pg/mg) and aortic rings (from 28.8 +/- 2.9 to 115.8 +/- 12.8 pg/mg). Treatment with an inhibitor of thromboxane A2 synthetase, UK 38485, had no effect on blood pressure in normotensive and Ang II-salt hypertensive rats. Treatment with a thromboxane A2 receptor blocker, SQ 29548, decreased blood pressure in Ang II-salt hypertensive rats from 191 +/- 9 to 152 +/- 9 mm Hg after 3 hours, but it had no effect on blood pressure in normotensive rats. Since SQ 29548 interfered with the pressor effects of the prostaglandin endoperoxide analogue U-46619, prostaglandin F2 alpha, and 9 alpha,11 beta-prostaglandin F2, we suggest that the SQ 29548-induced blood pressure reduction in Ang II-salt hypertensive rats is the manifestation of blockade of the vascular actions of one or more endogenous prostanoids including thromboxane A2 and prostaglandin endoperoxides. If so, pressor prostanoids may be contributory factors in the pathogenesis of severe Ang II-salt hypertension in rats.\r"

Studies were carried out in the sucrose gap at 29 degrees C and in the muscle bath at 37 degrees C. Leukotriene (LT) B4, LTD4, and prostaglandin (PG) D2 had neither direct nor significant effects on the excitatory junction potentials (EJP's), the secondary membrane potential oscillations, or the associated contractions that followed field stimulation of cholinergic nerves. U 46619, a stable analogue of thromboxane (Tx) A2, enhanced (10(-10)-10(-7) M) the duration and the amplitude of secondary oscillations and associated contractions without affecting the EJP's. In the muscle bath, U 46619 enhanced field-stimulated contractions; this was antagonized competitively by SQ 29548. In both the sucrose gap and the muscle bath, higher concentrations (10(-9) M and higher) caused direct effects, small depolarizations, and contractions. These effects of U 46619 were unaffected by indomethacin or guanethidine but were abolished by SQ 29548, an antagonist selective at TxA2-PGH2 receptors. U 46619 at 10(-9) M did not affect electrical or mechanical responses to acetylcholine and at 10(-9) M did not increase the sensitivity to acetylcholine. Platelet-activating factor (PAF) was inactive in all muscle-bath and most sucrose-gap experiments. In 7 of 20 of the latter, it caused effects qualitatively like those of U 46619, but whether it acted through release of TxA2 could not be tested because of the rapid tachyphylaxis to PAF. We conclude that TxA2 may mediate the hyperresponsiveness found in vitro after O3 treatment.\r"

PGE2 caused significant progressive decreases in ventilation (due to decreased tidal volume and breathing rate), heart rate, blood pressure, and percent of the time spent in low-voltage electrocortical activity (LVA). PGE2 also caused respiratory acidosis, hypoxemia, and increased frequency and duration of apneic events (greater than 3 s). During the infusion there was a dose-related increase in plasma concentration of PGE2. At 30 min postinfusion, all measured variables showed recovery, although arterial pH, CO2 tension, and plasma PGE2 remained significantly different from control values, and the percent time in LVA was even higher than during control. Infusion of the vehicle alone (n = 5) caused no significant changes in any of the measured variables. The results, taken in combination with previous fetal studies, indicate that PGE2 has marked inhibitory effects on breathing movements both before and after birth.\r"

In four of these subjects, additional biopsies were taken 3 cm distal and proximal. A control specimen was also taken from the left leg 2 days after the exercise. Ten days after the exercise, muscle was again sampled from each leg of these four subjects. Analysis of these samples revealed that the initial biopsy impaired glycogen storage in the muscle taken 1 cm medial or lateral to the previous site. This reduction in glycogen storage was most pronounced in the first 2 days after the exercise. Samples taken distal and proximal to the initial biopsy contained, on the average, less glycogen than the contralateral leg, but these differences were only significantly different in the distal muscle sample. Alteration in muscle glycogen storage was seen to persist for 10 days after the first biopsy, suggesting that care must be taken in selecting the site for repeated biopsies from the same muscle.\r"

  ".U": "88273569\r", 
  ".W": "Calcium has been implicated as an important factor in prostaglandin production. Phospholipase A2, the enzyme believed to be rate limiting for prostaglandin synthesis, is stimulated by Ca2+; however, the levels of Ca2+ necessary to stimulate phospholipase A2 in cell-free systems are higher than levels achieved in intact cells in response to agonists that stimulate prostaglandin synthesis. We examined the calcium dependency of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) synthesis in the glomerular mesangial cell. Vasopressin enhanced PGE2 synthesis by mechanisms independent of extracellular Ca2+ concentration. The Ca2+ concentration dependency of PGE2 production was established by rendering cells permeable with digitonin and clamping Ca2+ concentration at various levels. When cytosolic free Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]f) was set at levels equal to those measured after stimulation with vasopressin in the intact cell, the PGE2 production by the Ca2+-clamped permeabilized cells was approximately one-half of that obtained in nonpermeabilized cells stimulated with vasopressin. Since stimulation of mesangial cells with vasopressin increases protein kinase C activation as well as [Ca2+]f the effects on PGE2 production of protein kinase C activation with phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) were examined. When permeabilized cells were exposed to Ca2+ concentrations in the range of [Ca2+]f measured in cells treated with vasopressin the addition of PMA approximately doubled PGE2 production. No increase in PGE2 production was observed with PMA when Ca2+ concentration was fixed at basal levels of less than 100 nM. Ca2+-dependent acylhydrolase activity and PGE2 production were inhibited by calmodulin inhibitors, W-7 and compound 48/80. Thus, vasopressin-induced PGE2 production could be explained by a synergistic effect of protein kinase C activation together with an increase in [Ca2+]f. A synergistic action of Ca2+ and PMA on acylhydrolase activity could also be observed in nonpermeabilized cells where A23187 was used to increase [Ca2+]f. The effect of PMA was mimicked by another stimulant of protein kinase C, 1-oleoyl 2-acetylglycerol, albeit with lower potency. Neither PMA nor 1-oleoyl 2-acetylglycerol alone had any effect on acylhydrolase activity. Vasopressin, in the presence of GTP gamma S, stimulated phospholipase C in permeabilized cells when [Ca2+]f was fixed at less than 100 nM, without an associated increase in acylhydrolase activity. This evidence, together with inhibition of acylhydrolase activity with phospholipase A2 inhibitors, dibucaine and mepacrine, indicates that the primary acylhydrolase activity was due to phospholipase A2.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Since transferrin is required for cellular proliferation, we investigated transferrin synthesis by a small cell lung cancer line (NCI-H510) that survives in serum-free media without added transferrin. Immunoassays for human transferrin demonstrated that these cells contained immunoreactive human transferrin. Immunofluorescence studies showed that the protein is expressed on the surface of cells, presumably bound to transferrin receptor. Media conditioned by NCI-H510 cells support proliferation of human leukemic cells that would not survive in media lacking transferrin. [35S]Methionine incorporation documented transferrin synthesis by NCI-H510 cells as well as three other small cell lines. Transferrin synthesis by NCI-H510 cells increased more than 10-fold when cells entered active phases of the cell cycle, and this increase was seen before large increases in transferrin-receptor expression. Further experiments examining the effects of agents that affect iron metabolism show that the addition of transferrin-iron or hemin to the media is associated with a more rapid initial rate of proliferation and lower rates of transferrin synthesis than control cells. Gallium salts, which inhibit iron uptake, inhibited proliferation of these cells. If the cells recovered from this effect, transferrin synthesis remained greatly increased compared to control. We conclude that transferrin synthesis by these malignant cells is ultimately related to an iron requirement for cellular proliferation. It appears that this synthesized transferrin acts as part of an important autocrine mechanism permitting proliferation of these cells, and perhaps permitting tumor cell growth in vivo in areas not well vascularized.\r"

  ".W": "The first adult case of 11 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (11 beta-OHSD) deficiency is described. The impaired conversion of cortisol to cortisone (indicated by urinary cortisol and cortisone metabolites and failure to metabolize 11 alpha-[3H]cortisol to [3H]H2O), was associated with hypertension, hypokalemia, and suppression of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. When established on a fixed Na+/K+ intake, dexamethasone, given orally, produced a natriuresis and potassium retention. Plasma renin activity became detectable. When hydrocortisone (10 mg daily s.c. for 4 d) was added, there was marked Na+ retention, a kaliuresis (urinary Na+/K+ falling from 1.2 to 0.15), with suppression of plasma renin activity and an increase in blood pressure. These changes were also seen with the subject on no treatment. Conversion of cortisone to cortisol was not affected. These results suggest that cortisol acts as a potent mineralocorticoid in 11 beta-OHSD deficiency. The major site for the oxidation of cortisol to cortisone is the kidney. In this patient congenital deficiency of 11 beta-OHSD results in high intrarenal cortisol levels which then act on renal type I mineralocorticoid receptors. This condition can be treated with dexamethasone, which suppresses cortisol secretion and binds to the type II glucocorticoid receptor. We suggest that 11 beta-OHSD exerts a critical paracrine role in determining the specificity of the type I receptor. In the normal state cortisol is converted by 11 beta-OHSD to cortisone which thus allows aldosterone to bind preferentially to the type I receptors in the kidney and gut. In this patient deficiency of 11 beta-OHSD results in high intrarenal cortisol concentrations that then bind to the type I receptor.\r"
