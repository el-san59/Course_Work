Lysates of human neutrophils inhibited the directed growth of candida pseudohyphae in agarose gel and suppressed the proliferation of candida yeast in broth cultures, but did not kill the organisms or prevent their germination. The growth-inhibitory material released from disrupted neutrophils had an estimated molecular weight of 30 kD and differed from most previously described neutrophil antimicrobial factors in that it was present in cell sap rather than granules, and did not appear in the supernatant after stimulation of the cells. Neutrophil death and dissolution may represent an alternative host defence mechanism against invasive C albicans infection.\r"

In the isolated perfused rat kidney, the concentration of endothelin required to reduce blood-flow by 50% is 200 pmol/l, compared with 1000 pmol/l angiotensin II (previously the most potent known vasoconstrictor). Whereas angiotensin II has little effect on the glomerular filtration rate (GFR), a rise in endothelin from 100 to 800 pmol/l reduces GFR by 90%. Endothelin is probably present in the circulation at low concentrations in vivo; events associated clinically with acute renal failure would tend to increase this concentration. Endothelin may be a mediator in the pathogenesis of acute renal failure.\r"

At 2 weeks, there was no significant difference in outcome between the two groups. Co-trimoxazole is much less expensive than ampicillin or procaine penicillin, requires only twice-daily administration, and can be given by health-care staff with little training. The results support the use of co-trimoxazole as the antibiotic of first choice in outpatient management of young children with pneumonia in developing countries.\r"

By measuring zones of inhibition, we assessed the effectiveness of aqueous Merthiolate, Burow's solution (2%), VoSol HC, VoSol plain, Cortisporin suspension, clotrimazole 1%, Mycostatin, amphotericin B, ethanol 95%, miconazole, tolnaftate 1%, natamycin, and flucytosine. Most otic preparations showed little or no growth inhibition. However, Merthiolate was very effective against all organisms tested, clotrimazole was very effective against most yeast and fungi tested, and nystatin had the widest spectrum of activity among the antifungals. Tolnaftate was ineffective. Vigorous cleaning of the external auditory canal remains the mainstay in treating otymycosis, but proper laboratory identification and suitable topical therapy are also important in dealing with this capricious infection.\r"

From a group of 158 eligible patients, 76 were randomized to conventional treatment (surgery and postoperative radiotherapy), and 82 were assigned to experimental treatment (induction chemotherapy, surgery, postoperative radiotherapy). Median follow-up for living patients was approximately 5 years. These analyses include chemotherapy responses and toxicities, surgical complications, radiotherapy toxicities, patient compliance, survival time, and patterns of treatment failure. Overall chemotherapy response was 0.70 (0.19 CR, 0.51 PR). The median survival time for conventional treatment was longer than the time for patients receiving preoperative chemotherapy, although the survival time differences were not statistically significant. This final analysis demonstrates no benefit in survival using preoperative chemotherapy for advanced stage, resectable head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.\r"

  ".W": "Based on study of 58 histologically proved cases of SMCD, we believe that the prognosis of most SMCD patients can be anticipated at the time of initial diagnosis by using 5 independent significant predictors developed in a multivariate model. Our study confirms the significance of several previously reported poor prognostic factors: absence of skin involvement and the presence of hepatosplenomegaly, cytologic atypia, and a hypercellular bone marrow. However, in contrast to previous reports we did not find a uniform correlation between the presence or absence of skin involvement and prognosis. The observation that anemia was strongly related to so many prognostic variables may be due to the number of patients in our study with associated hematologic disorders. Alternatively, this evidence of ineffective erythropoiesis may support the concept that SMCD is a myeloid stem cell disorder and frequently affects other hematopoietic cell lines. The observation that death occurs within the first 3 years in most fatal cases of SMCD suggests that these patients should be followed carefully for this interval after initial diagnosis, especially if poor prognostic features are present. Currently there is no curative therapy for SMCD.\r"

  ".W": "The clinical and laboratory features of 23 new patients as well as 50 previously reported patients with the syndrome of hematophagic histiocytosis are reviewed. The syndrome occurs more often in men than women but has no age predilection. Common presenting features include fever, hepatic and splenic enlargement, lymphadenopathy, and profound depression of blood counts. The clinical course is generally fulminant and may be complicated by coagulation abnormalities, hepatic dysfunction and renal failure. In the majority of patients, however, the syndrome is self-limited with resolution of the clinical and laboratory abnormalities within several weeks. Hematophagic histiocytosis generally occurs in patients who develop infections in the setting of preexisting immunologic abnormalities or neoplasms. Viral infections are most commonly involved, but virtually any other infectious agent can precipitate this syndrome. The characteristic morphologic feature of the hematophagic histiocytosis is the proliferation of mature histiocytes actively ingesting other blood cells. These hematophagic histiocytes most commonly involve the bone marrow but may also be present in the lymph nodes, spleen and liver. Other bone marrow abnormalities include hypocellularity with preservation of megakaryocytes, and myelofibrosis. The principal features of this syndrome that distinguish it from malignant histiocytosis are the cytologic maturity and degree of hematophagic activity of the histiocytes as well as its more favorable prognosis. In some patients, however, a clear distinction of malignant from reactive histiocytosis will not be possible until a clonal marker for malignant histiocytes is identified. Based in our experience, the syndrome of hematophagic histiocytosis appears to be more common than malignant histiocytosis.\r"

  ".W": "Cholesterol embolization is a puzzling event that may be increasingly iatrogenic in origin. Diagnosis is difficult and requires a high index of suspicion, an appropriate clinical picture, and usually, confirmation by biopsy. Certain laboratory abnormalities may be helpful; the elevated sedimentation rate and relative eosinophilia found in our patients concurs with other cases reported in the literature. Prognosis is related to the extent of systemic involvement, but renal disease is particularly threatening and gangrene and infection can be lethal. Multiple therapeutic regimens have been generally unsuccessful in altering the course of the disease process. The most significant impact on the disease can be made by its prevention. Cholesterol emboli occur spontaneously, but also after invasive aortic procedures such as diagnostic angiography or cardiovascular surgery. In addition, cardiac catheterization and percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty have the potential for arterial trauma and consequent cholesterol embolization. Although the apparent increasing numbers of cholesterol emboli may be a reflection of the increased use of arterial invasive procedures, they are being performed on an older, more severely ill population, with other risk factors for the development of embolic phenomena, i.e., age, smoking history, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and peripheral vascular disease. Our observed cases and review of the literature do not furnish information concerning the comparative incidences of embolization as related to the suggested etiologies. Careful documentation of the clinical situation preceding the event, the type of procedure, the site of arterial entry, and the duration, difficulty, and extent of the intravascular invasion (i.e., above or below the left subclavian artery) are necessary for this purpose. Such data should help to develop guidelines for patient and procedure selection in order to minimize the possibility of cholesterol embolization.\r"

Recent seroprevalence studies in the United States suggest that there are about 50,000 infected individuals. The identification of 5 individuals with HTLV-I-associated leukemia/lymphoma referred to our center with relatively limited screening methods suggests that these disorders are more common than currently appreciated. Though 99% of infected individuals remain asymptomatic, this virus may cause immunosuppression, lymphomas, or myelopathy. The lymphomas have been classified as acute or chronic forms of adult T cell leukemia-lymphoma (ATLL). Acute ATLL is a T cell form of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in an HTLV-I-infected individual with leukemia, skin infiltration, or hypercalcemia. This disorder is poorly responsive to chemotherapy and all patients should be referred for experimental protocols. Chronic ATLL is an insidious disease characterized by lymphadenopathy, skin infiltration of less than 10% of the body surface, and/or atypical lymphocytes with highly convoluted nuclei which include 1 to 10% of the nucleated cells in the peripheral blood, but no visceral involvement or hypercalcemia. The prognosis of these patients is not clearly defined. All individuals with mature T lymphocytic malignancies should be evaluated with HTLV-I-specific assays. The most sensitive and specific assays available include the enzyme linked immunoadsorbent antibody assay (ELISA) and the polymerase chain DNA amplification reaction assay. With improved laboratory techniques and greater awareness of the characteristics of this disease by clinicians, it is likely that the natural history of HTLV-I infection will be better defined, and improvements in therapeutic management will be developed.\r"

  ".W": "To assess the effect of asymptomatic nocturnal hypoglycemia on glycemic control in insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, we studied, on three nights, 10 patients receiving their usual regimens of continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion. During a control night, the patients' mean (+/- SE) plasma glucose level reached a nadir of 4.5 +/- 0.2 mmol per liter at 3 a.m.; the fasting glucose level was 5.9 +/- 0.3 mmol per liter at 7:30 a.m., and a peak glucose level of 8.6 +/- 0.3 mmol per liter was reached at 10 a.m., after breakfast. During nights two and three, supplemental insulin was infused intravenously from 10 p.m. to 2 a.m. to simulate a clinical overdose of insulin. On these nights, either hypoglycemia (2.4 +/- 0.2 mmol per liter) was permitted to occur or a nearly normal glucose level (5.5 mmol per liter) was maintained by infusion of glucose. The subjects were asymptomatic on all three nights. Despite comparable plasma free insulin levels from 4 to 11 a.m., both fasting (7.3 +/- 0.2 mmol per liter) and postbreakfast (12.5 +/- 0.4 mmol per liter) plasma glucose levels were significantly higher after hypoglycemia than when hypoglycemia was prevented (6.2 +/- 0.2 mmol per liter and 8.7 +/- 0.4 mmol per liter, respectively; P less than 0.001 in both cases). Fasting levels of plasma glucose correlated directly with overnight plasma levels of epinephrine (r = 0.78, P less than 0.001), growth hormone (r = 0.57, P less than 0.009), and cortisol (r = 0.52, P less than 0.02) but correlated inversely with the overnight nadir of plasma glucose (r = -0.62, P less than 0.005). We conclude that asymptomatic nocturnal hypoglycemia can cause clinically important deterioration in glycemic control (the Somogyi phenomenon) in patients receiving intensive insulin therapy, and should therefore be considered in the differential diagnosis of unexplained morning hyperglycemia.\r"

We describe a method for the immunohistochemical detection of overexpression of neu protein on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue, with the use of two different monoclonal antibodies. In a group of tumors with a known neu-gene copy number, intense membrane staining of tumor cells was present in all tumors with neu-gene amplification. Of 189 tumors from patients with Stage II breast cancer, 27 (14 percent) had neu-membrane staining. Neu overexpression was associated with larger tumor size (P = 0.006) but not with lymph-node involvement. Neu-protein expression in lymph-node metastases was the same as its expression in primary tumors. Among the patients with neu overexpression (median follow-up, 37 months), disease-free survival was not significantly shorter; overall survival was reduced significantly in these patients (P = 0.042), but this reduction did not remain significant after adjustment for tumor size. Of 45 ductal carcinomas in situ, 19 (42 percent) had neu-membrane staining. These 19 were all of the large-cell, comedo growth type. None of 16 ductal carcinomas in situ of small-cell, papillary, or cribriform growth type had neu overexpression. We conclude that neu overexpression may be an early step in the development of a distinct histologic type of carcinoma of the breast, but we could find no association of overexpression with lymph-node status or tumor recurrence.\r"

An implication of this theory is that prediabetic persons have higher serum insulin levels than normal subjects. We assessed serum insulin concentrations in a cohort of 1497 nondiabetic Mexican Americans, a population at high risk for NIDDM, according to whether their parents or siblings had diabetes. It was assumed that prediabetic persons would be more likely to have strong family histories of diabetes. We found a stepwise increase in fasting insulin levels in nondiabetics with neither, one, or both parents with diabetes (69.8, 77.8, and 94.6 pmol per liter, respectively; P = 0.002). Similar results were observed for insulin sum (the total of insulin concentrations in the fasting state and at 30, 60, and 120 minutes after a 75-g oral glucose load). The differences in insulin sums according to family history remained statistically significant in analyses of covariance, which controlled for variations in body-mass index, body-fat distribution, and level of blood glucose. Subjects without diabetes who had a diabetic sibling had higher fasting concentrations of insulin than subjects without a diabetic sibling (83.2 vs. 69.6 pmol per liter), but the difference was not statistically significant. We conclude that prediabetic persons, who would be expected to be more numerous in kindreds with progressively stronger family histories of diabetes, have hyperinsulinemia. This supports the insulin-resistance hypothesis.\r"

  ".U": "89040073\r", 
  ".W": "Medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (MCAD) deficiency, one of the most common inherited metabolic disorders, is often mistaken for the sudden infant death syndrome or Reye's syndrome. Diagnosing it has been difficult because of a lack of fast and reliable diagnostic methods. We developed a stable-isotope dilution method to measure urinary n-hexanoylglycine, 3-phenylpropionylglycine, and suberylglycine, and we retrospectively tested its accuracy in diagnosing MCAD deficiency. We measured the concentrations of these three acylglycines in 54 urine samples from 21 patients with confirmed MCAD deficiency during the acute and asymptomatic phases of the illness and compared the results with the concentrations in 98 samples from healthy controls and patient controls with various diseases. The levels of urinary hexanoylglycine and phenylpropionylglycine were significantly increased in all samples from the patients with MCAD deficiency, clearly distinguishing them from both groups of controls. Although urinary suberylglycine was increased in the patients, the range of values in the normal controls who were receiving formula containing medium-chain triglycerides was very wide, overlapping somewhat with the values in the patients with asymptomatic MCAD deficiency. These results indicate that the measurement of urinary hexanoylglycine and phenylpropionylglycine by our method is highly specific for the diagnosis of MCAD deficiency. The method is fast and can be applied to random urine specimens, without any pretreatment of patients.\r"

Although prompt treatment with antibiotics may abrogate the antibody response to the infection, symptoms persist in some patients. We studied 17 patients who had presented with acute Lyme disease and received prompt treatment with oral antibiotics, but in whom chronic Lyme disease subsequently developed. Although these patients had clinically active disease, none had diagnostic levels of antibodies to B. burgdorferi on either a standard enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay or immunofluorescence assay. On Western blot analysis, the level of immunoglobulin reactivity against B. burgdorferi in serum from these patients was no greater than that in serum from normal controls. The patients had a vigorous T-cell proliferative response to whole B. burgdorferi, with a mean ( +/- SEM) stimulation index of 17.8 +/- 3.3, similar to that (15.8 +/- 3.2) in 18 patients with chronic Lyme disease who had detectable antibodies. The T-cell response of both groups was greater than that of a control group of healthy subjects (3.1 +/- 0.5; P less than 0.001). We conclude that the presence of chronic Lyme disease cannot be excluded by the absence of antibodies against B. burgdorferi and that a specific T-cell blastogenic response to B. burgdorferi is evidence of infection in seronegative patients with clinical indications of chronic Lyme disease.\r"

  ".W": "Prophylactic blood transfusion has come to be regarded as necessary in the treatment of patients with sickle cell disease during pregnancy. Because of the risks associated with blood products and reports of successful outcomes without the use of blood transfusion, we conducted a prospective randomized controlled study of this issue. Seventy-two pregnant patients with sickle cell anemia were randomly assigned to one of two treatment groups: 36 received prophylactic transfusions of frozen red cells, and 36 received red-cell transfusions only for medical or obstetric emergencies. Twenty-eight patients with sickle cell anemia who did not qualify for randomization (mainly because they had other medical disorders), 66 with sickle cell-hemoglobin C disease, and 23 with sickle cell-beta-thalassemia were also followed and received transfusions only for emergencies. There was no significant difference in perinatal outcome between the offspring of mothers with sickle cell disease who were assigned to treatment with prophylactic transfusions and those who were not (15 vs. 5 percent). The occurrence of a perinatal death in a previous pregnancy and the presence of twins in the present pregnancy were two major risk factors for an unfavorable outcome; when they were present, perinatal mortality was 50 percent. Perinatal mortality was somewhat higher in the two groups that were randomized than in the three groups that were not. Prophylactic transfusion significantly reduced the incidence of painful crises of sickle cell disease (P less than 0.01) and substantially reduced the cumulative incidence of other complications of this disorder (P = 0.07). Other medical and obstetric complications occurred with nearly equal frequency in the two randomized groups. Increases in costs, the number of hospitalizations, and the risk of alloimmunization were disadvantages of prophylactic transfusion. We conclude that the omission of prophylactic red-cell transfusion will not harm pregnant patients with sickle cell disease or their offspring.\r"

We studied prospectively the pharmacokinetics and toxicity of seven chloroquine regimens in 58 Gambian children with severe chloroquine-sensitive falciparum malaria. In all regimens the total cumulative dose was 25 mg of chloroquine base per kilogram of body weight. Chloroquine was rapidly absorbed after either intramuscular or subcutaneous administration (5 mg of base per kilogram every 12 hours), producing high peak blood concentrations but transient hypotension in 5 of 18 patients (28 percent). Intermittent intravenous infusion (5 mg of base per kilogram over 4 hours, repeated every 12 hours) also produced wide fluctuations in chloroquine levels, suggesting incomplete distribution from a small central compartment. Continuous infusion (0.83 mg of base per kilogram per hour for 30 hours) and smaller, more frequent intramuscular or subcutaneous injections of chloroquine (3.5 mg of base per kilogram every 6 hours) produced smoother blood-concentration profiles with lower early peak levels and no adverse cardiovascular or neurologic effects. Chloroquine given by nasogastric tube (initial dose, 10 mg of base per kilogram) was absorbed well, even in comatose children. We conclude that simple alterations in dosage and frequency of administration can give parenteral chloroquine an acceptable therapeutic ratio and reinstate it as the treatment of choice for severe malaria in areas where chloroquine resistance is not a major problem.\r"

The cumulative incidence of NIDDM was 25 and 61 percent at 5 and 10 years, respectively. The risk of development of diabetes was 6.3 times (95 percent confidence interval, 3.8 to 10.6) as high as in a normoglycemic control group (n = 752). Variables predicting deterioration to NIDDM were age up to the age of 40, after which increasing age had a beneficial effect; higher plasma glucose levels during fasting and after carbohydrate loading; and higher serum insulin levels after fasting and lower levels after carbohydrate loading, suggesting that insulin resistance and decreased beta-cell responsiveness are important determinants of the clinical outcome of impaired glucose tolerance. Obese subjects had 2.9 times (95 percent confidence interval, 2.0 to 10.9) the incidence of NIDDM as the nonobese. Obesity was not, however, predictive of progression to NIDDM after an adjustment for plasma glucose and serum insulin levels. We conclude that in this population approximately one fourth of subjects with impaired glucose tolerance have NIDDM at five years and two thirds at 10 years (approximately one third revert to normal) and that age and plasma glucose and insulin levels are the best predictors of clinical outcome.\r"

  ".W": "Auxiliary heterotopic liver transplantation is theoretically attractive because it leaves the recipient's liver in place. The surgical trauma of hepatectomy is avoided, and failure of the graft does not necessarily lead to the death of the patient or a second, emergency transplantation. Another advantage is that matching the body sizes of the donor and the recipient is not mandatory, which increases the number of possible donors. However, previous clinical results of auxiliary liver transplantation have been poor. We performed auxiliary partial liver transplantation in six consecutive patients with end-stage chronic liver disease who were not accepted for orthotopic liver transplantation because they had massive ascites, deficient clotting function, cachexia, or poor pulmonary reserve. The donor liver was transplanted to the right subhepatic region after removal of segments II and III, and it was provided with portal and arterial blood. There were no major changes in hemodynamic measurements during surgery. The mean hospital stay after transplantation was 22.7 days (range, 14 to 29). After a mean follow-up period of 14 months (range, 5 to 23), all patients were alive, with good graft function as demonstrated by scintigraphy, Doppler ultrasonography, and synthesis of clotting factors. From these observations we conclude that auxiliary partial liver transplantation is an attractive alternative to orthotopic liver transplantation in high-risk patients. Its role in other patients who need liver transplants remains to be defined.\r"

  ".W": "Long-term potentiation (LTP) of synaptic transmission in the hippocampus is a much-studied example of synaptic plasticity. Although the role of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors in the induction of LTP is well established, the nature of the persistent signal underlying this synaptic enhancement is unclear. Involvement of protein phosphorylation in LTP has been widely proposed, with protein kinase C (PKC) and calcium-calmodulin kinase type II (CaMKII) as leading candidates. Here we test whether the persistent signal in LTP is an enduring phosphoester bond, a long-lived kinase activator, or a constitutively active protein kinase by using H-7, which inhibits activated protein kinases and sphingosine, which competes with activators of PKC (ref. 17) and CaMKII (ref. 18). H-7 suppressed established LTP, indicating that the synaptic potentiation is sustained by persistent protein kinase activity rather than a stably phosphorylated substrate. In contrast, sphingosine did not inhibit established LTP, although it was effective when applied before tetanic stimulation. This suggests that persistent kinase activity is not maintained by a long-lived activator, but is effectively constitutive. Surprisingly, the H-7 block of LTP was reversible; evidently, the kinase directly underlying LTP remains activated even though its catalytic activity is interrupted indicating that such kinase activity does not sustain itself simply through continual autophosphorylation (see refs 9, 13, 15).\r"

Correlation between human papilloma virus (HPV) infection of the uterine cervix and the development of cervical neoplasia has been established. More recent studies have shown the presence and expression of integrated HPV types 16 and 18 DNA sequences in 70-80% of cervical tumours and tumour cell lines. It has been suggested that, in addition to HPVs, other agents such as hormones and tobacco products act as cofactors in cervical neoplasia (for review see ref. 15). The presence and expression of a glucocorticoid-responsive element in HPV-16 has been reported. Here we provide evidence for the oncogenic transformation of primary cells with a combination of HPV-16 DNA, but not HPV-11 DNA, and the activated form of the human Ha-ras oncogene only in the presence of the glucocorticoid hormone dexamethasone.\r"

These, and some jaw fragments, all from Cameroon, are the only fossil evidence of mammalian evolution from Africa between late Jurassic and Paleocene, a span of at least 85 million years. A triangular upper tooth lacks the principal internal cusp of marsupials and placentals and is therefore of a similar evolutionary grade to most Jurassic and early Cretaceous therian mammals, but more primitive than the metatherian-eutherian grade. Early Cretaceous, or older, therian mammals are now known from all southern continents except Antarctica. The new find from Cameroon is consistent with the hypothesis that marsupials, the dominant living mammals of South America and Australia, were not present on any Gondwana continents until after the early Cretaceous separation of Africa by the opening of the South Atlantic.\r"

We isolated the gene for tRNA(2Ile) (ileX) and found that the anticodon is CAT, which is characteristic of the methionine tRNA gene. Replacement of L(34) of tRNA(2Ile) molecule enzymatically with unmodified C(34) resulted in a marked reduction of the isoleucine-accepting activity and, surprisingly, in the appearance of methionine-accepting activity. Thus, both the codon and amino-acid specificity of this tRNA are converted by a single post-transcriptional modification of the first position of the anticodon during tRNA maturation.\r"

A total of 188 patients (nimodipine (N) = 102, placebo (P) = 86) were enrolled in the study, both pre- and postoperatively, within 24 hours of clinical deterioration connected with vasospasm or within 24 hours of arteriography that identified vasospasm. After 61 patients were excluded for not meeting study criteria or for protocol violation, the results were supported by 127 validated case reports: 73 patients received intravenous treatment with nimodipine, and 54 were given placebo. Analysis of the main criterion of efficacy, the number of deaths and of patients with severe deficit related to vasospasm alone, showed a significant statistical difference (N = 8 (19%), P = 17 (49%), P = 0.01). The risk of death or disability was reduced by 66% in the treated group. Analysis of this criterion by type of inclusion (clinical or angiographic) also showed a significant reduction in the clinical group (P = 0.05), but there was no difference in the angiographic group. The risk of mortality connected with vasospasm was reduced by 82%, but analysis by group showed that there was no significant difference for those patients included on clinical criteria, whereas mortality was reduced to a much greater extent in the angiographic group. These results demonstrate the therapeutic efficacy of nimodipine in reducing secondary ischemic brain damage in patients already suffering from angiographic vasospasm or delayed ischemic deterioration.\r"

Ultrasound examinations were performed in 78 pregnancies complicated by preterm labor before 35 weeks' gestation. Tocolysis was attempted unless contraindicated or unless cervical dilatation was advanced (4 cm or greater). Pregnancies delivering before 36 weeks' gestation were compared with those delivering after this gestational age. Among the 48 pregnancies delivered before 36 weeks' gestation, a significantly greater proportion had ultrasonic growth parameters lower than normal values at corresponding gestational ages. In contrast, those pregnancies that had successful tocolysis and delivered near term demonstrated a normal distribution of ultrasound growth parameters. In pregnancies complicated by preterm labor, ultrasonic documentation of diminished fetal growth may identify the subgroup at increased risk for preterm delivery.\r"

Fifty insulin-dependent diabetics had twice-weekly testing, and 188 gestational diabetics had weekly testing. Intervention was not pursued unless there were maternal or fetal complications. There were no stillbirths and three neonatal deaths, all resulting from congenital anomalies, giving a corrected perinatal mortality rate of 0. The incidence of abnormal biophysical profile scores, eight of 238 (3.3%) overall, was low, with no significant difference between types of diabetics. In those with an abnormal score, intervention was mandated; the cesarean section rate was 50% and the rate of intensive care nursery admissions was high. Of the 230 fetuses with a normal biophysical profile score, 200 (87%) were delivered at term with minimal maternal or neonatal morbidity. Amniocentesis for phospholipid profile was performed in only 33 cases (13.9%). Hyaline membrane disease was confined to five premature neonates (incidence 2.1%).

Secondarily, anencephaly may develop as a result of prolonged exposure of the developing encephalon to amniotic fluid and trauma in utero. As in anencephaly, facial structures and the bony base of the calvarium are often preserved in exencephaly. Sonographically, the outstanding feature of exencephaly is the cerebral mass, with convolutions or \"pseudo\" sulcal patterns present.

To evaluate the relationship more precisely, this study assessed variables of physician-patient interaction, parental mental health in pregnancy and infancy, and 3-month infant and parent behavior. The results show that maternal mental health scores increased as a function of the stress associated with an \"at risk\" pregnancy necessitating ultrasound assessment. As the parent received more definitive information, scores on measures of anxiety, depression, and hostility decreased. There was no significant relationship, however, between definitive information gained through ultrasound and later parent and infant behavior in play interaction. Shifts in fetal and neonatal health status and the positive interaction between physician and parent suggest the need for further analysis.\r"

Vaginal reconstruction plays an integral role in this rehabilitation. The care of these patients at the University of Michigan is reviewed and their treatment is described. Fifty-one patients were treated with split-thickness skin graft vaginoplasty. Seven repeat vaginoplasties were required, for a total of 58 procedures. Fifty patients were assessed postoperatively, and 47 (94%) ultimately had a satisfactory outcome. Three of the 50 patients had an unsatisfactory final outcome; two had recurrent malignancy and the third patient did not comply with the proposed dilator regimen. Four patients developed fistulas. The split-thickness skin graft provides an acceptable outcome when used for vaginal reconstruction in the patient with a gynecologic malignancy.\r"

The mean age was 61.6 years (range 33-78). The bladder wall was found intact in three patients regardless of the diagnostic procedure. A mere displacement of the bladder wall was observed in four cases using cystoscopy. In all of these women, tumor invasion was ascertained by cystosonography alone. Edema of the bladder mucosa was found in 14 women by cystoscopy and in six women by cystosonography. Endosonography detected tumor invasion of the external layers of the bladder in eight of 14 women. In six of 14 patients, edema was caused by bladder displacement without neoplastic infiltration. Tumor invasion of the bladder was ascertained in six women by cystoscopy and intravesical sonography. Both cystoscopy and intravesical sonography demonstrated neoplastic infiltration and edema of the bladder mucosa in eight patients. Compared with cystoscopy, cystosonographic demonstration of the perivesical region provided better evaluation of the extent of bladder invasion. Cystosonography is a diagnostic adjunct to mere cystoscopy for patients with gynecologic malignancies. This modality is an excellent diagnostic tool, especially if cystoscopy reveals pathologic findings such as edema and displacement or invasion of the bladder wall.\r"

  ".W": "Endocervical specimens from 168 asymptomatic women in the second trimester of pregnancy were screened for Chlamydia trachomatis infection with both standard tissue culture methods and a direct fluorescein-conjugated monoclonal antibody assay (MicroTrak). Based on tissue culture results, the prevalence of Chlamydia trachomatis was 26.2% in this population. Compared with tissue culture, the monoclonal antibody assay's sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive value varied depending upon how many elementary bodies were used to define a positive test. Specifically, if a cutoff of ten elementary bodies was used (as per the manufacturer's instructions), the sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive value of this test were 86.3, 98.4, and 95.0%, respectively. At the other extreme, a cutoff of one elementary body produced a more sensitive but less specific test, with parameters of 93.2, 89.5, and 75.9%, respectively. Based on these data and operating characteristic analysis, the cutoff value defining a positive test was appropriately set at two or more elementary bodies, at least for this study population. This resulted in a sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive value of 93.2, 95.2, and 87.2%, respectively. This monoclonal antibody assay appears to be a reasonable substitute for cell culture for Chlamydia trachomatis. However, because of varying magnitudes and implications of false-positive and false-negative tests, clinicians are urged to determine the appropriate breakpoint for their individual laboratories and patient populations before substituting the direct fluorescent antibody test for tissue culture.\r"

Correction was achieved in all six patients after surgery, five with spectacles and one with a contact lens. Keratometric astigmatism decreased from an average of 9.63 diopters preoperatively to 2.17 D postoperatively, a reduction of 7.46 D, or 77%. Up to 13.50 D of correction was obtained. In general, the effect of surgery progressed from 1 week to 3 months postoperatively, and regressed from 3 to 6 months. Complications included perforation in two patients, one requiring suturing and application of tissue adhesive, and graft reaction in two patients. Although the number of patients is small, it appears that this technique can successfully reduce post keratoplasty astigmatism, even in excess of 10 D.\r"

Postoperative systemic therapy with steroids had a negative influence on the clinical manifestations; dendritic lesions which developed on the corneal graft disappeared after interruption of the systemic steroid therapy. This suggests that cortisone treatment after keratoplasty should be avoided in this special metabolic disorder.\r"

Efficacy, ocular drug tolerance, and systemic safety were judged as good to very good in approximately 80% of the patients. This large, postapproval study confirms previous findings of several well-controlled clinical trials indicating that levobunolol is an effective drug for the treatment of elevated IOP and is safe and comfortable for most patients.\r"

A literature review of 17 recent dental publications and their reference citations revealed that the recommendation to avoid local anesthetics of the amide type in dental treatment of MH-susceptible (MHS) patients is based on in vitro muscle investigations, unpublished communications, and a single case report suggestive of MH. Therefore, a survey of members of the Malignant Hyperthermia Association of the United States designed to determine what, if any, MH-like reactions have occurred in patients with MHS receiving dental treatment was conducted. Of a total of 307 MHS respondents, 36 (12%) reported adverse reactions to dental care. Only one respondent, however, reported symptoms suspicious of MH (fever, muscle pain) in which the administration of amide local anesthetics appeared to be closely linked. Fifty-six (18%) of the respondents have had difficulty obtaining routine dental care since being identified as MHS; this includes 27 who have been refused dental treatment or have had to undergo operative procedures without the benefit of local anesthesia. These results support the conclusions that amide local anesthetics may be administered to MHS patients without significant risk and that currently the diagnosis of MH susceptibility can adversely affect the quality of dental care.\r"

  ".U": "89041163\r", 
  ".W": "Many disturbances in oropharyngeal physiology can result in aspiration. Poor tongue movement in chewing or in the oral swallow can cause food to fall into the pharynx and into the open airway before swallowing. A delay in triggering the pharyngeal swallow can result in food falling into the airway during the delay when the airway is open. Reduced peristalsis in the pharynx, whether unilateral or bilateral, will cause residue in the pharynx after the swallow that can fall or be inhaled into the airway. Reduced laryngeal elevation causes food to catch at the top of the airway. This residual food is then easily aspirated during the inhalation after the swallow. Reduced laryngeal closure may result in food penetrating the larynx during the pharyngeal swallow. Cricopharyngeal dysfunction can result in material remaining in the pyriform sinus, with aspiration of material into the airway after the swallow. Aspiration may also occur because food returns or is refluxed from the stomach or esophagus back into the pharynx. Each of these causes of aspiration can occur in a variety of patients, including those with neurologic impairment or structural damage. Each of these causes of aspiration has a different treatment. Thus, accurate and in-depth evaluation of swallowing anatomy and physiology in the oral-pharyngeal region as well as in the esophagus is necessary in successful re-establishment of oral nutrition in the dysphagic patient. Currently, such thorough evaluation requires radiographic graphic techniques, that is, videofluoroscopy and often manometry as well.\r"

In this paper, the social security disability determination process is described, criteria for the proposed listing of 'impairment due primarily to pain' are reviewed, and a multiaxial taxometric system for determining disability due primarily to pain is described. The social implications of the proposed listing as well as a multiaxial taxometric approach for the social security disability system are described. Impediments to solutions to the disability determination problems confronting the Social Security Administration are discussed, and a scientific approach is contrasted with the current legal decision making process, as it relates to the awarding of Social Security disability benefits.\r"

  ".W": "A meta-analysis was conducted on 109 published studies which assessed the outcome of various non-medical treatments for chronic pain. Of these studies, 48 provided sufficient information to calculate effect sizes. The remainder were examined according to proportion of patients rated as improved. Studies were compared as a function of type of treatment, type of pain, and type of outcome variable. In general, effect sizes were positive and of modest magnitude indicating the short-term efficacy of most treatments for most types of pain. This finding suggests that the effectiveness of treatments may be attributable not to the differences between treatments, but to the features they have in common. Mood and number of subjective symptoms consistently showed greater responses to treatment than did pain intensity, pain duration, or frequency of pain, indicating the importance of using a multidimensional framework for pain assessment. This finding also suggests that the benefit of psychological approaches to pain management may lie in reducing the fear and depression associated with pain, rather than relieving the pain itself. The present study also highlights the advantages of meta-analytic reviews.\r"

During the initial episode all had arthritis or arthralgia and a documented streptococcal infection. None had carditis and none received prophylactic antibiotic therapy during an average follow-up of 17 months (range, 6 to 42 months). One patient developed classic ARF with valvulitis 18 months after the initial episode. Two children had later episodes of arthritis and two had at least one additional episode of arthralgia. Poststreptococcal reactive arthritis/arthralgias seems to be part of the disease spectrum of ARF and therefore the use of prophylactic antibiotic therapy to prevent subsequent development of ARF and carditis in these patients should, perhaps, be reconsidered.\r"

Fifty-six patients had evidence of Y. pseudotuberculosis infection bacteriologically and/or serologically. Twenty-six were assigned to placebo and 28 to ampicillin. Ampicillin therapy did not show a significant benefit in shortening the duration of fever, diarrhea and abdominal pain or in preventing rash, erythema nodosum and acute renal failure.

In five fetuses, the diagnosis was made late in pregnancy and was associated with severe abnormalities. Fetuses were handled in a routine obstetric fashion and none survived. Of the other 22 fetuses 19 had stable and two had progressive ventriculomegaly; in one case, ventriculomegaly resolved in utero. Nineteen of these fetuses have survived, 13 with normal intellectual development and six with moderately to severely delayed development. Associated abnormalities were detected with ultrasonography in 74% of fetuses; there was a 20% false-negative rate of detection. Ventriculomegaly was isolated and progressive in two fetuses. In both cases, fetuses were delivered at term, and postnatally a shunting procedure was performed. Both children are neurologically normal. From our results and a review of the literature, which supports our findings, we were unable to define a group of fetuses with in utero ventriculomegaly that would benefit from in utero shunting.\r"

Thirty-four premature infants, 25 to 29 weeks' gestational age, received a preventilatory dose of a calf lung surfactant extract in saline prepared at the University of Rochester. A control group of 31 infants received a preventilatory dose of saline alone. The major finding of this trial is that a single preventilatory dose of calf lung surfactant extract reduces the severity of the respiratory distress syndrome during the first 24 hours of life. The beneficial effects, however, are not sustained in many infants and diminish after 24 hours of life. The survival rate was 71% in both the control and surfactant-treated groups. There was a lower incidence of pneumothorax in the surfactant-treated group. There were no differences in the incidence of bronchopulmonary dysplasia, patent ductus arteriosus, and intraventricular hemorrhage. No adverse effects of surfactant replacement therapy were identified. Results of this study suggest that multiple postventilatory doses of surfactant will be required for optimal therapy.\r"

This essay first delineates the economic circumstances of bone marrow transplantation, comparing it with other organ transplantations. Although children represent a significant proportion of bone marrow transplantation patients, little research has focused on the economic impact for this population. Next, the financial, social, and ethical motivations and controversies that surround bone marrow transplantation are explored, along with current allocation mechanisms. Finally, recommendations are offered for guiding discussions regarding the appropriate use of bone marrow transplantation. In making transplantation decisions, physicians must consider the costs and benefits of bone marrow transplantation for each patient. Such analyses, whether based on medical or socioeconomic criteria, are insufficient to resolve the fundamental cultural dilemmas posed by this procedure and other expensive medical technologies, however. The goal is to foster broader discussion of these issues to achieve more candid decisions in allocating resources among competing health priorities.\r"

With both methods, major malformations can be detected. Ten patients had a horseshoe kidney, 11 had double collecting systems, four had complete absence of one kidney, three had crossed ectopia, and one had a pelvic kidney. Three patients had ureteropelvic junction obstruction; two of these were asymptomatic and the obstructions were detected only because of the routine imaging. Two patients had ureterovesicular junction obstruction, with one studied as part of a routine evaluation for short stature. Four of these five patients required surgery.

These four patients and seven well-described children from the literature with necrotizing fasciitis following surgery form the basis of this review. The ages ranged from six days to 15 years (mean 4.5 years). There were eight boys and three girls. There were five clean, five clean-contaminated, and one contaminated surgical procedures. No patient had evidence of malignancy or diabetes. Two of our four patients had evidence of failure to thrive. Only one patient had an intraabdominal abscess. In ten, the infection started in the abdominal wall; in one, the infection started in the chest wall. In our four patients, three had neutropenia and fever, four had tachycardia, and two had wound crepitation and radiographic evidence of subcutaneous gas. Cultures of all ten wounds were positive for bacteria; six were positive for more than one organism. Blood culture results were positive in five of five patients who died and in only two of five patients who survived. All survivors had wide surgical debridement and were treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics. The mortality rate was 45% in the whole series.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Additional study of the effectiveness of these recommendations is in progress, but the medical community has generally endorsed them and urges their implementation in office practice. To date, chemotherapy is not clearly indicated as adjuvant therapy, but enrollment of patients in cooperative group protocols is recommended. Use of second-look surgery to resect selected recurrent tumors has increased in recent years, in part because of the contribution of the computed tomographic scan and carcinoembryonic antigen assay to follow-up of postoperative patients. For advanced disease, technologic advances have improved the technique of hepatic artery perfusion with chemotherapeutic agents, but evidence of a survival advantage afforded by this method is still lacking. Single-agent chemotherapy with fluorouracil remains the best choice for palliating advanced disease, but hepatic artery perfusion with floxuridine also may relieve liver-dominant disease.\r"

The Micro-Trach diminishes dyspnea because it bypasses the anatomic dead space in the respiratory tract. It eliminates the waste of oxygen that escapes from the nose and mouth when a nasal cannula is used. Therefore, a small oxygen container lasts longer, increasing the patient's mobility. The patient's appetite improves because oxygen is not diverted during deglutition, and the senses of smell and taste are restored. Rehabilitation is enhanced through increased mobility and improved nutrition. Transtracheal instillation of saline solution cleanses the respiratory tract and stimulates coughing, opening occluded air passages. There are fewer lung infections and hospitalizations for infective exacerbations of disease. Prescribed saline solution, mucolytics, and antibiotics can also be instilled through the Micro-Trach to treat cystic fibrosis. This use and others are still being explored.\r"

The major pathophysiologic effect of infection seems to be cessation of erythropoiesis as a result of cytolytic infection of red cell precursors. Erythema infectiosum is a benign disease that usually occurs in childhood. The acute polyarthralgia syndrome is likewise benign, and patients in whom parvovirus infection has been confirmed by serologic testing can be reassured that their joint symptoms are likely to be self-limited. Parvovirus-induced aplastic crisis in a patient with chronic hemolytic anemia is life-threatening but can be reversed with blood transfusions if recognized promptly. Parvovirus infection during pregnancy clearly increases the risk of fetal demise, and parental anxiety is understandably high. An organized approach using a combination of tests to monitor mother and fetus can provide optimal care in these cases.\r"

Once the tumor extends beyond the gland, treatment alternatives are radiation or endocrine therapy. If lymph nodes are negative, radiation therapy may result in a long period without progression. If lymph nodes are positive, the expense and morbidity of radiation therapy may not be worthwhile because the likelihood of cure is low. Androgen deprivation, or endocrine manipulation, is preferred for metastatic disease. Response is varied and may depend on the patient's testosterone level when therapy is initiated. Survival is shorter in those with levels below normal.\r"

The conformation of an in vitro synthesized RNA fragment extending over the thrS regulatory region has been investigated using chemical and enzymatic probes. This study shows that the RNA folds into four well-defined secondary-structure domains, one of them displaying structural similarities to the anticodon arm of tRNAThr. The conformation of three constitutive mutants containing single base changes in the operator region leading to the loss of the regulatory control was also investigated. The replacement of a base in the anticodon-like loop does not induce any conformational change, suggesting that the residue concerned is directly involved in the regulatory process. However, single mutations in or close to the anticodon-like stem result in a partial or complete reorganization of the structure of the operator region. These rearrangements should affect the binding of the ligase to the operator, leading to loss of the regulatory process.\r"

In this report we describe the purification of hepatocyte nuclear factor 1 and demonstrate that it interacts with essential promoter regions of many liver-specific genes, including albumin, alpha-fetoprotein, and transthyretin. This finding suggests that hepatocyte nuclear factor 1 could be one factor necessary for establishing the liver phenotype. We also show that this protein binds to the promoter of the surface-antigen gene of the hepatitis B virus, a virus characterized by a high degree of hepatotropism.\r"

The protein harbors DNA-binding, deoxyribonucleotide-binding, DNA-synthesizing (polymerase) and 3'-exonucleolytic (editing) activities as well as a capacity to interact with several other T4-induced replication enzymes. In addition, the T4 gp43 is a repressor of its own synthesis in vivo. We show here that this protein is an autogenous repressor of translation, and we have localized its RNA-binding sequence (translational operator) to the translation initiation domain of gene 43 mRNA. This mechanism for regulation of T4 DNA polymerase expression underscores the ubiquity of translational repression in the control of T4 DNA replication. Many T4 DNA polymerase accessory proteins and nucleotide biosynthesis enzymes are regulated by the phage-induced translational repressor regA, while the T4 single-stranded DNA-binding protein (T4 gp32) is, like gp43, autogenously regulated at the translational level.\r"

Phosphatidylserine synthase activity in cell extracts was reduced in the bcy1 mutant (which has high cAMP-dependent protein kinase activity) and elevated in the cyr1 mutant (which has low cAMP-dependent protein kinase activity) when compared with wild-type cells. The reduced phosphatidylserine synthase activity in the bcy1 mutant correlated with elevated levels of a phosphorylated form of the phosphatidylserine synthase Mr 23,000 subunit. The elevated phosphatidylserine synthase activity in the cyr1 mutant correlated with reduced levels of the phosphorylated form of the enzyme. There was negligible phosphorylation of the phosphatidylserine synthase Mr 23,000 subunit from stationary-phase cells. Pure phosphatidylserine synthase was phosphorylated by the cAMP-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit, which resulted in a 60-70% reduction in phosphatidylserine synthase activity. The cAMP-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit catalyzed the incorporation of 0.7 mol of phosphate per mol of phosphatidylserine synthase Mr 23,000 subunit. The specific cAMP-dependent protein kinase inhibitor prevented the phosphorylation of phosphatidylserine synthase and the inhibition of its activity by the catalytic subunit. Analysis of peptides derived from protease-treated labeled phosphatidylserine synthase showed only one labeled peptide. Phospho amino acid analysis of labeled phosphatidylserine synthase showed that the enzyme was phosphorylated at a serine residue.\r"

In contrast, E1E2 ATPases--e.g., the K+-dependent (Kdp) ATPase from Escherichia coli, the Na+,K+-ATPase from ox brain, and the Ca2+-ATPase from sarcoplasmic reticulum--are moderately sensitive to this inhibitor. Finally, membrane ATPases from Neurospora vacuoles, chromaffin granules, and plant vacuoles are extremely sensitive. From this we conclude that bafilomycin A1 is a valuable tool for distinguishing among the three different types of ATPases and represents the first relatively specific potent inhibitor of vacuolar ATPases.\r"

The results from the 5' and internal deletion analyses indicate that there are at least three cis-acting elements that are involved in the light-dependent developmental expression of cab1 gene. Two such elements are located at the immediate upstream regulatory region and the other element is located at the further upstream region. The 1120-base-pair (bp) DNA fragment containing the immediate and far upstream region can confer light-inducible organ specificity on the truncated nos promoter. However, deletion of the 39-bp DNA fragment at the immediate upstream regulatory region from this hybrid promoter resulted in a nonfunctional promoter, revealing that the 39-bp region is important for the cab promoter specificity. Further analyses of this region suggest that a potential Z-DNA-forming sequence (ATACGTGT) is involved in light-dependent developmental expression of the cab1 gene. Two additional Z-DNA-forming sequences (ACACATAT) that are inverted repeats of this sequence are also found in the upstream region where the additional regulatory elements are expected.\r"

The enhancement was higher for T. vaginalis than for T. foetus. Addition of anti-laminin antibodies to medium significantly inhibited the adhesion of parasites to polystyrene substrate. Indirect immunofluorescence and transmission electron microscopy of replicas of the parasite's surface labeled with antibody-gold complexes showed laminin-binding sites distributed over the parasite surface. Iodinated P1 fragment of laminin, which retains the laminin-binding site, binds saturably to the parasite surface with a Kd of 19.5 nM, for about 3 X 10(5) binding sites per cell. Immunoblotting analysis of whole parasite extracts showed that a protein of 118 kDa is responsible for laminin binding.\r"

  ".W": "We report the development of two dominant-acting genetic markers useful for monitoring gene transfer in mammalian cells that are based on prokaryotic genes encoding key steps in the synthesis of the essential amino acids, tryptophan and histidine. Under appropriate conditions, expression of these genes obviates the nutritional requirements for their respective amino acid products. Expression of the trpB gene of Escherichia coli, which encodes the beta subunit of tryptophan synthase (EC 4.2.1.20), allows mammalian cell survival and multiplication in medium containing indole in place of tryptophan. The hisD gene of Salmonella typhimurium encodes histidinol dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.23), which catalyzes the two-step NAD+-dependent oxidation of L-histidinol to L-histidine. In medium lacking histidine and containing histidinol, only mammalian cells expressing the hisD product survive. The selection is a double one in that the provided precursor histidinol is itself toxic to animal cells through its inhibition of histidyl-tRNA synthetase; thus, the dehydrogenase both removes an inhibitor and forms a required end product. Alternatively, the his selection may be carried out under conditions in which the dehydrogenase serves mainly to detoxify histidinol. For either the trp or his selections the substitute nutrient (indole or histidinol) is readily available, inexpensive, stable, permeable to cells, and convertible to the end product in a step controlled by a single gene. Vectors based upon murine retrovirus and papovavirus backbones have been successfully employed for both genes, allowing selection in a range of cell types, including 3T3, CV-1, and HeLa. These dominant selective schemes should provide generally useful and inexpensive alternatives to others currently in use, such as the gpt, neo, hygro, dhfr, and tk selections.\r"

CSF-1 stimulated rapid tyrosine phosphorylation of cellular proteins in murine BAC1.2F5 macrophages at 37 degrees C and 4 degrees C. The pattern of CSF-1-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of at least 15 different proteins at both temperatures was similar and unchanged by treatment of the lysate with reducing agent. With the exception of the 185-kDa CSF-1 receptor, a 260-kDa protein and a 133-kDa protein, the proteins were predominantly cytoplasmic. At 37 degrees C, all the proteins were phosphorylated within 30 sec of addition of growth factor. At 4 degrees C, CSF-1 receptor sites were saturated after 2 min of incubation in the presence of high concentrations of CSF-1 and differences in the order of appearance of phosphorylated proteins were observed: 185 kDa (CSF-1 receptor) (by 2 min); 99 kDa (by 4 min); 125 kDa (by 10 min); 61 kDa (by 30 min); and 260 kDa, 84 kDa, and 41 kDa (by 180 min). In addition to stimulating the phosphorylation of these proteins in tyrosine, CSF-1 caused dephosphorylation of phosphorylated serine residues on the receptor. As neither CSF-1 nor its receptor is internalized at 4 degrees C, analysis of these early reactions and the phosphotyrosine-containing proteins in intact cells under these conditions should lead to an understanding of the early events in growth factor receptor-mediated signal transduction.\r"

Polymorphic positions are confined to the central tandemly repeated sequences. Nucleotide substitutions in the tandem repeats produce variants; these substituted positions within the repeat array tend to be conserved between genes. The North Korean CS gene has a short insertion after the repeats encoding a 4-amino acid repeat (Ala-Gly-Gly-Asn) not found in the New World P. vivax genes. This sequence is found both flanking and within the tandem repeats of the CS genes of several strains of the Southeast Asian simian malaria parasite, Plasmodium cynomolgi. The intraspecific conservation of positions of variants within tandem repeat arrays and the interspecific conservation of probably ancestral repeat motifs at the end of these arrays are consistent with the occurrence of nonreciprocal genetic exchanges between the tandem repeats of these genes. However, a striking asymmetry in strand nucleotide composition within the tandem repeats of all CS genes leads us to suggest that biased correction of heteroduplexes formed during recombination plays a role in the evolution of these genes.\r"

Since the mutator strength of this strain depends on the medium in which it grows, mutations were analyzed in both minimal medium (moderate mutator activity) and rich medium (high mutator activity). In either case, 95% of all mutations were base substitutions and 5% were single-base deletions. However, the nature and site distribution of the base substitutions differed dramatically for the two conditions. In minimal medium (mutation frequency, 480-fold above background), a majority (62%) were transversions, notably A.T----T.A at three 5'-GTGG-3' sequences. Most (64%) of the transitions under this condition occurred at specific sequences that are suggestive of a \"dislocation\" type of mutagenesis. In rich medium (mutation frequency, 37,000-fold above background), 90% of the base substitutions were transitions. These observations suggest that different modes of mutagenesis operate under the two conditions. mutD5 cells have been reported to be defective in exonucleolytic proofreading during DNA replication. The present data suggest that mutD cells in rich medium also suffer a defect in mutHLS-encoded mismatch correction. This hypothesis was confirmed by the direct measurement of mismatch repair in mutD5 cells by transfection of M13mp2 heteroduplex DNA.\r"

In the absence of SOS induction, transfection of a uvrA6 mutant of Escherichia coli with this vector gave very few progeny plaques, and the data imply that a single dimer blocks replication in at least 99.5% of the molecules. In vitro photoreactivation completely abolished this inhibition. Transfection of cells irradiated with UV at 4 J.m-2 to induce the SOS response gave 27% of the number of plaques found with a dimer-free control. Nucleotide sequence analysis of 529 progeny phage showed that translesion synthesis was usually accurate: the normal sequence was found in 93% of them. Where mutations occurred, all were targeted single-nucleotide substitutions, with approximately 90% being targeted at the 3' nucleotide of the lesion: of a total of 26 mutations, 15 were 3' T----A, 8 were 3' T----C, and 3 were 5' T----C. No T----G mutations were found. In addition to these results with the normal construct, data were also obtained from vectors in which the M13mp7 cloning site, which forms a hairpin in single-stranded DNA, was present 4 nucleotides on the 3' side of the T-T dimer. These hairpin-containing vectors gave a very similar mutation frequency (8% versus 7%) but altered mutation spectrum: all 12 mutations detected were 3' T----A transversions, a difference from the previous set of data that is significant (P = 0.03).\r"

Data from earlier immunoblotting experiments demonstrated that rabbits inoculated i.v. with purified infectious BK virus produced antibodies not only to the viral structural protein VP1 but also to migrating polypeptides of a molecular mass ranging from 14-16 kDa. These proteins were believed to represent certain histone classes. To examine this hypothesis, sera from five rabbits inoculated with BK virus were analyzed by ELISA for antibodies against polynucleosomes, the individual histone classes, and double-stranded DNA, as well as against antigens carried by the structural viral proteins. Antibodies against polynucleosomes and also against histones H1 and H3 were found in sera from two of five inoculated rabbits. The same sera contained antibodies reacting with double-stranded DNA, whereas no antibodies against H2A, H2B, and H4 were detected. BK virus inoculation may thus lead to a break of tolerance, resulting in autoantibody production against highly conserved antigens that, in this context, may be regarded as \"self-antigens\", irrespective of the species in which they originate.\r"

A particular monoclonal antibody, 3D3, directed to a clonotypic determinant on the T-cell receptor (TCR) of the cloned Th-cell line D10, had previously been shown to be distinctively capable of directly activating D10 cells at low concentrations. We demonstrate here by immunofluorescence experiments that it is also distinctively able itself to produce a clustering (capping) of the TCRs on the D10 cell surface. Simultaneously, by means of double-immunofluorescence experiments, we find that the 3D3-induced clustering of the TCRs distinctively produces a co-clustering of the accessory molecule CD4 with the TCR clusters, although the CD4 and TCR molecules are normally independent of one another in the D10 cell membrane. These results, and related ones previously obtained from studies of the interactions of D10 Th cells with antigen-presenting cells, are analyzed to suggest that the membrane clustering of TCRs and the induced TCR-CD4 interactions are critical to the signaling events in Th-cell activation.\r"

  ".W": "Based on the observation that high levels of renin and angiotensin II (Ang II) are found in the adrenal zona glomerulosa (ZG), it has been postulated that Ang II is formed intracellularly by the renin-converting enzyme cascade in this tissue. To test this hypothesis, we examined renin-angiotensin system components in subcellular fractions of the rat adrenal ZG. Renin activity and immunoreactive-Ang II (IR-Ang II) were observed in vesicular fractions but were not colocalized. In addition, angiotensinogen, angiotensin I, and converting enzyme were not observed in the renin or IR-Ang II-containing vesicular fractions. These data do not support the hypothesis that Ang II is formed intracellularly within the renin-containing vesicles of the ZG. Rather, since modulatable renin release from adrenal ZG slices was observed and renin activity was found in dense vesicular fractions (33-39% sucrose), it is likely that Ang II formation in the ZG is extracellular and initiated by the release of vesicular renin. Receptor-mediated endocytosis and subsequent degradation of Ang II in ZG lysosomes have been shown by others. The presence of IR-Ang II in light vesicular fractions (15% sucrose) and the finding of a high correlation between ZG IR-Ang II and Ang II receptor levels suggest that the primary occurrence of this peptide in the ZG is by receptor-mediated endocytosis. In ZG lysosomal fractions 125I-labeled Ang II was degraded to 125I-labeled des-[Phe8]Ang II. Since Ang II antibodies do not recognize des-[Phe8]Ang II, these findings explain why IR-Ang II in the ZG is due predominantly to Ang II and not to its C-terminal immunoreactive fragments.\r"

Once cleaved from the bacterium by pepsin, the M molecules also underwent conformational changes, which were reflected in their ability to compete. A monoclonal antibody opsonic for M6 streptococci lost its ability to completely opsonize one of the size mutants in this study. Therefore, spontaneous intragenic events between repeats within emm-6, the structural gene for the M6 protein, do result in structural variations within the mutant M molecules. This variation alters the ability of certain antibodies, originally produced in response to sequences in the parental M molecule, to bind to the mutant M molecules or opsonize the mutant organisms. Group A streptococci have evolved a mechanism for generating antigenic diversity that differs from currently known mechanisms in other bacterial species.\r"

  ".W": "A panel of six murine monoclonal antibodies against hepatocellular carcinoma-associated antigens, reactive with PLC/PRF/5 human hepatoma cells, was conjugated to Adriamycin (doxorubicin) via a dextran bridge. This library of antibodies includes three monoclonal antibodies against hepatitis B virus surface antigen, one anti-alpha-fetoprotein, and two other IgG2a antibodies against PLC/PRF/5 hepatoma-associated antigens. The use of dextran for conjugation of Adriamycin to antibodies enabled a 5- to 10-fold amplification of the number of drug molecules linked to antibody. Conjugation of Adriamycin to dextran caused an occasional reduction in the pharmacologic activity of dextran-Adriamycin in [3H]thymidine incorporation assays in hepatoma cells as compared to nonconjugated Adriamycin. This loss of anticellular activity was partially compensated for by conjugation of specific antibodies to the dextran-Adriamycin conjugate. Conjugated compounds completely retained their binding activity to purified hepatitis B virus surface antigen and alpha-fetoprotein fixed to a solid matrix as compared to binding of homologous nonconjugated antibodies. However, some reduction of the binding activity to intact hepatoma cells was observed in three of six conjugates. Binding activity to hepatoma cells and, as a consequence, suppression of tumor cell DNA synthesis by the various conjugates was enhanced as compared to the same effect in treated colorectal carcinoma cells that do not express the relevant hepatoma-associated proteins. Furthermore, two conjugates containing nonspecific antibodies did not bind to hepatoma cells and caused minimal suppression of DNA synthesis. These results suggest that this panel of monoclonal antibody-dextran-Adriamycin conjugates was effective in suppression of PLC/PRF/5 cell growth in vitro.\r"

This protein has the following additional designations (depending on context): B-50 (phospholipid metabolism), F1 (synaptic plasticity), and p57 (calmodulin binding). We show that a protein with the same molecular mass and isoelectric point as GAP-43, which interacts with anti-GAP-43 antibodies on immunoblots, is present in the plasma membranes of cultured neonatal rat cortical astrocytes. Double-immunofluorescence labeling of cells with a serum against glial fibrillary acidic protein and anti-GAP-43 antibody was observed. Furthermore, astrocytic protein was phosphorylated in vitro by protein kinase C and comigrated in two-dimensional PAGE with GAP-43. The data indicate that GAP-43, heretofore believed to be neuron-specific, is present in at least one class of glial cells.\r"

By using both immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization, PNMTase- and NPY-positive cells exhibited a close overlap in bovine medulla and were preferentially localized in the outer two-thirds of the medulla. Although TyrOHase and its mRNA were observed in virtually all medullary gland cells, TyrOHase mRNA levels were much higher in the PNMTase- and NPY-positive cells. After administration of the catecholamine-depleting drug reserpine to rats, a brief increase, followed by a dramatic decrease, in the level of PNMTase mRNA was observed in the adrenal medulla. In contrast, mRNA for both TyrOHase and NPY only exhibited an increase, whereby the TyrOHase mRNA peak preceded that of NPY mRNA. Different regulatory mechanisms may thus operate for these three compounds coexisting in the adrenal medulla.\r"

In sharp contrast, microtubules in the mid-region of the dendrite, approximately 75 microns from the cell body, are not of uniform polarity orientation. Roughly equal proportions of these microtubules are oriented with (+)-ends directed toward the growth cone and (+)-ends directed toward the cell body. At distances within 15 micron of the growth cone, however, microtubule polarity orientation in dendrites is similar to that in axons; (+)-ends are uniformly directed toward the growth cone. These findings indicate a clear difference between axons and dendrites with respect to microtubule organization, a difference that may underlie the differential distribution of organelles within the neuron.\r"

  ".W": "Hepatic elimination of epidermal growth factor (EGF) via receptor-mediated endocytosis was studied by a multiple-indicator dilution method in the isolated perfused rat liver, in which cell polarity and spatial organization are maintained. In this method EGF was given with inulin, an extracellular reference, as a bolus into the portal vein, and dilution curves of both compounds in the hepatic vein effluent were analyzed. Analysis of the dilution curve for EGF, compared with that for somatostatin, which showed no specific binding to isolated liver plasma membranes, resulted as follows: (i) both extraction ratio and distribution volume of 125I-labeled EGF decreased as the injected amount of unlabeled EGF increased; (ii) the ratio plot [ln (inulin/EGF) versus time] of the dilution curve for EGF exhibited an upward straight line initially for a short period of time (approximately equal to 10 sec), whereas the ratio plot [ln (inulin/somatostatin) versus time] of somatostatin gradually decreased. The multiple-indicator dilution method was used for other peptides also. Insulin and glucagon, known to have hepatocyte receptors, behaved similarly to EGF in shape of their ratio plots. Thus, analysis of dilution curves can reveal whether or not the cell surface has receptors for certain peptides. In addition, the dilution curves for EGF at various doses (tracer approximately equal to 30 micrograms) were analyzed simultaneously based on a kinetic model incorporating the perfusion rate, the association rate constant of EGF to surface receptors (kappa on), the dissociation rate constant of EGF from the EGF-receptor complex (kappa off), and the sequestration rate constant of the complex. The kinetic parameters [the dissociation constant (Kd = kappa off/kappa on) and the number of surface receptors] calculated by this analysis were comparable with reported values obtained by in vitro direct binding measurements at equilibrium using liver homogenates. We conclude that the multiple-indicator dilution method is a good tool for analyzing the dynamics of peptide hormones--cell-surface receptor interaction under a condition in which spatial architecture of the liver is maintained.\r"

Transformed mutant yeast grown in galactose, which induces that promoter, were viable and contained active fragment A. In contrast, sensitive, wild-type cells harboring this plasmid grew normally under repressing conditions but were killed when the GAL1 promoter was induced. Additional constructions were also prepared that included sequences encoding either the lymphocyte growth factor interleukin 2 or alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone along with the lipid-associating domains of fragment B and the leader peptide of the Kluyveromyces lactis killer toxin. Resistant mutant strains transformed with these plasmids efficiently expressed and secreted the expected chimeric toxins.\r"

DNA methylation, which is proposed to be a tight mechanism of regulation, may be necessary to turn off these genes. We have investigated the transfectability of HLA class I genes and of the genes for the T-cell differentiation antigens Leu-1 (CD5) and Leu-2 (CD8) in mouse L cells by using human sperm cells and choriocarcinoma cell lines, tumors of trophoblastic origin, as sources of DNA. It was found that DNA from one choriocarcinoma line (JAR) does not transfect genes for HLA, Leu-1, or Leu-2 and that DNA from two other choriocarcinoma lines (BeWo and Ima) transfects only some of the surface markers. Sperm DNA transfects genes for all the surface antigens tested except Leu-1. DNA from control cells and from the line SCH transfects all the markers studied. Southern blots show that all cell types contain apparently intact genes encoding HLA, Leu-1, and Leu-2 and reveal differences in the DNA methylation patterns of genes from different sources of DNA. We treated JAR (the cell line with the lowest transfecting ability) with 5-azacytidine and obtained demethylation of its DNA. This demethylated DNA transfects genes for both HLA class I antigens and Leu-2. Further culture of JAR cells in the absence of 5-azacytidine results in remethylation of their DNA and decreased ability to transfect these surface antigens. These findings indicate that DNA methylation affects the efficiency of transfection of surface antigen genes in L cells.\r"

The gene encoding the large subunit is located on a 5.9-kilobase fragment of the H2-uptake-complementing cosmid pHU52 [Zuber, M., Harker, A.R., Sultana, M.A. & Evans, H.J. (1986) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 83, 7668-7672]. We have now determined that the structural genes for both subunits are present on this fragment. Two open reading frames are present that correspond in size and deduced amino acid sequence to the hydrogenase subunits, except that the small-subunit coding region contains a leader peptide of 46 amino acids. The two genes are separated by a 32-nucleotide intergenic region and likely constitute an operon. Comparison of the deduced amino acid sequences of the B. japonicum genes with those from Desulfovibrio gigas, Desulfovibrio baculatus, and Rhodobacter capsulatus indicates significant sequence identity.\r"

Dissociation of 125I-labeled insulin at a 1:50 dilution was not first order; unlabeled insulin at physiological concentrations accelerated the dissociation rate with a maximal effect at approximately 17 nM. At higher concentrations, the unlabeled insulin slowed the dissociation rate. Maximal acceleration was seen at pH 8.0. The ability to accelerate the dissociation rate was diminished with [LeuB24]insulin and suppressed with desoctapeptide, [LeuB25], [LeuB24,B25], desalanine-desasparagine, and desheptapeptide insulins, all of which slowed the dissociation at high concentrations. Monoclonal antibodies to the insulin receptor alpha subunit (MA-5, MA-10, MA-20, and MA-51) all competed for insulin binding to the purified receptor. MA-10 and MA-51 accelerated the dissociation of 125I-labeled insulin, while MA-5 and MA-20 slowed the off rate. Thus, all the aspects of both negatively and positively cooperative site-site interactions previously described in whole cells are present in solubilized purified receptors, demonstrating that these interactions represent intrinsic properties of the receptor molecule, most likely as a result of ligand-induced conformational changes.\r"

(i) UvrABC endonuclease usually incises a psoralen monoadduct only on the damaged strand. However, for one of the monoadducts we studied, incision on the complementary undamaged strand was also observed at a very low frequency, as though the adduct were on the thymine across from the damaged strand. Although the details of the erroneous incision are not yet known, such erroneous incision is potentially mutagenic. (ii) In cross-link repair, we observed that the UvrABC endonuclease incises the cross-linked DNA on either the furan side strand or the pyrone side strand. The incisions are not equally efficient. These data suggest that the structure of a psoralen cross-link, as seen by a repair enzyme, varies with the DNA sequence.\r"

The increase in receptor number was visualized by indirect immunofluorescence with antiserum specific for the beta AR and was verified by radioligand binding. The steady-state levels of beta AR mRNA were quantified in untreated (control) and glucocorticoid-treated cells by DNA-excess solution hybridization using a single-stranded probe corresponding to nucleotides +12 to 182 of the hamster beta 2AR cDNA coding region. The steady-state level increased from 0.37 pg of beta AR mRNA per microgram of total cellular RNA in untreated cells to 1.05 pg of beta AR mRNA per microgram of RNA in cells treated with dexamethasone (500 nM) for 2-4 hr. After this sharp transient peak, the steady-state level of receptor mRNA declined by 6 hr to a level approximately twice that of the untreated cells. Half-maximal effects were achieved at 20-40 nM dexamethasone. Testosterone (500 nM) and 17 beta-estradiol (500 nM), in contrast, did not alter the steady-state levels of beta AR mRNA. Actinomycin D, a potent inhibitor of transcription, abolished the dexamethasone-induced increase in beta AR mRNA, suggesting that the permissive hormone effect was exerted on gene transcription. The half-life of the receptor mRNA measured in the presence of actinomycin D was found to be 12 hr in both the untreated and the dexamethasone-treated cells. These studies provide a molecular explanation for the well-known regulation of GTP-binding protein (G-protein)-linked cell-surface receptors by permissive hormones.\r"

The aspartate-induced methylation on the serine receptor is absent in a strain that lacks cheA and cheW genes and is not the result of physical interaction, such as the formation of heterodimers between the aspartate and serine receptors, or of alterations in the affinity of the serine receptor for the methyltransferase and the methylesterase. Serine-induced methylation of the serine receptor did not require cheA and cheW. A model is presented in which the receptor methylation level depends on the combination of (i) a ligand-induced conformational change on the receptor substrate of the methylation enzymes and (ii) an indirect cytoplasmic signal that operates through the methylesterase.\r"

Its identity was verified by comparing the deduced amino acid sequence with that obtained by direct sequencing of a complete set of CNBr and proteolytic peptides from the purified protein. The enzyme subunit is composed of 362 amino acids and has N-acetylvaline as the amino-terminal residue. The cDNA, 1255 base pairs (bp) long, consisted of 1086 bp of coding region, 15 bp of 5' untranslated sequence, and 154 bp at the 3' untranslated end. The 3' untranslated sequence contained a polyadenylylation signal (AATAAA) followed after 30 bp by a stretch of 7 adenines at the end of the clone. The deduced amino acid sequence was identical to the primary sequence of the protein and confirmed the alignment of five nonoverlapping peptides. It also confirmed the 27-residue extension, unique to the rat liver subunit, ending with a carboxyl-terminal phenylalanine. RNA blot analyses using the radiolabeled liver cDNA as a probe revealed a single band of fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase mRNA, 1.4 kilobases long, in liver and kidney but not in nongluconeogenic tissues. Fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase mRNA was increased 10-fold in livers from diabetic rats and was reduced to control levels after 24 hr of insulin treatment, suggesting that the changes in enzyme activity observed in diabetes and after insulin treatment are due to alterations in mRNA abundance.\r"

Structural differences between the QA and QB environments that contribute to the function of the quinones (the electron transfer from QA- to QB and the charge recombination of QA-, QB- with the primary donor) are delineated. The protein residues that may be involved in the protonation of QB are identified. A pathway for the doubly reduced QB to dissociate from the RC is proposed. The interactions between QB and the residues that have been changed in herbicide-resistant mutants are described. The environment of the nonheme iron is compared to the environments of metal ions in other proteins.\r"

These procedures were used to examine the subcellular distribution of chitin synthetase (chitin-UDP acetylglucosaminyltransferase; EC 2.4.1.16) in homogenates from exponentially growing walled cells of a wild-type strain of yeast. Chitin synthetase (Chs1) activity was mainly found in two distinct vesicle populations of nearly equal abundance but with markedly different buoyant densities and particle diameters. One population contained 45-65% of the total chitin synthetase and was identified as chitosomes because of microvesicular size (median diameter = 61 nm) and characteristic low buoyant density (1.15 g/ml); it also lacked 1,3-beta-glucan synthetase activity. The second population (35-55%) was identified as plasma membrane because of its high buoyant density (1.22 g/ml), large vesicle size (median diameter = 252 nm), and presence of vanadate-sensitive ATPase. This fraction cosedimented with the main peak of 1,3-beta-glucan synthetase. A third, minor population of chitin synthetase particles was also detected. Essentially all of the chitin synthetase in the two vesicle populations was zymogenic; therefore, we regard these vesicles as precursors of the final active form of chitin synthetase whose location in the cell has yet to be unequivocally determined.\r"

This binding is significantly greater than the binding of 125I-labeled lamin A and is competitively inhibited by unlabeled ligand. We demonstrate that a 58-kDa integral membrane protein (p58) is a lamin B receptor by virtue of its abundance in the nuclear envelope and association with 125I-labeled lamin B in ligand blotting assays. Specific antibodies raised against p58 recognize one protein in isolated nuclei and partially block 125I-labeled lamin B binding to lamin-depleted nuclear membranes. Cell fractionation and indirect immunofluorescence microscopy show that p58 is located in the periphery of the nucleus. This protein may serve as a membrane attachment site for the nuclear lamina by acting as a specific receptor for lamin B.\r"

It was found that freshly isolated PBMC recognize variant envelope proteins of HIV-1 but not a more distantly related envelope protein derived from the simian immunodeficiency virus (SIVmac). Although the effector cells were predominantly CD8+, both MHC-matched and -unmatched target cells were lysed. Cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) clones were found to lyse cells expressing HIV-1 envelope or reverse transcriptase. In contrast to the cytotoxic response detected with PBMC, the cloned CTLs were major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I restricted. Our finding that a cloned CTL line lysed cells expressing highly divergent HIV envelopes strongly suggested that a conserved epitope was recognized. Identification of these shared epitopes may assist in designing a vaccine for HIV-1 that could stimulate MHC-restricted cytotoxic responses.\r"

The addition of a tri- or hexapeptide did not hamper virus viability. The antigenic pattern of insertion mutants was only modified locally: all mutants lost reactivity of neutralization site 1 with the corresponding monoclonal antibodies, while the reactivity of sites 2 and 3 was unaffected by the insertion. We have shown for one of the mutants--vFG68--that the antigenic specificity of the neutralization site 1 was replaced by a new one. Although vFG68 differs from its parental Sabin strain only by the addition of three amino acids within VP1, neutralizing antibodies specific for vFG68 were induced by the native virion as well as by the heat-denatured mutated virions. Our results demonstrate that an oligopeptide of three or six amino acids can lengthen VP1 at the level of antigenic site 1 without affecting virus multiplication and that this foreign peptide is exposed on the virion surface.\r"

This approach was used to study the persistence of EBV in two seropositive recipients of allogeneic bone marrow transplants. The first patient received marrow from her EBV-seronegative brother, became EBV seronegative after grafting, and remained so for greater than 1200 days. Subsequently, she became infected with a new EBV strain that differed from her pretransplant strain but was indistinguishable from the virus isolated from her husband. The second patient received marrow from his EBV-seropositive brother. This patient showed only a transient decrease in IgG antibodies to EBV capsid antigen. His pretransplant strain differed from the virus of his donor. On days 252 and 915 after transplantation, lymphoblastoid cell lines were grown from the peripheral blood of the patient and were found to carry exclusively the virus of the donor. These results suggest that the latently EBV-infected host cells reside in a cellular compartment that can be destroyed by graft-versus-host reactivity, irradiation, or cytotoxic drugs. Hemopoietic tissue is the most likely candidate.\r"

Clusters of strongly DARPP-32-immunoreactive cells were found in brown adipose tissue from the interscapular area and around lymph nodes close to the kidneys, adrenal glands, descending aorta, and great veins in the neck. The DARPP-32-immunoreactive cells contained multilocular lipid droplets, had round, centrally located nuclei, and were polygonal in shape, thus possessing characteristics and location sites typical for brown fat cells. The results indicate that brown adipose tissue from the newborn pig contains DARPP-32, an intracellular third messenger for dopamine. Together with recent functional data, these results strongly suggest that dopaminergic D1 mechanisms--i.e., activation of adenylate cyclase and formation of cyclic AMP--may be involved in cold-induced, nonshivering, and/or diet-induced thermogenesis.\r"

  ".W": "We investigated the effect of various excitatory amino acids on intracellular free Ca2+ concentration ( [Ca2+]i) in single mouse hippocampal neurons in vitro by using the Ca2+-sensitive dye fura-2. In normal physiological solution, glutamate, kainate, N-methyl-D-aspartate, and quisqualate all produced increases in [Ca2+]i. When all extracellular Ca2+ was removed, kainate and N-methyl-D-aspartate were completely ineffective, but quisqualate and glutamate were able to produce a spike-like Ca2+ transient, presumably reflecting the release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores. Ca2+ transients of similar shape could also be produced by the alpha 1-adrenergic agonist phenylephrine. After the production of a Ca2+ transient a second addition of quisqualate was ineffective unless intracellular stores were refilled by loading the cell with Ca2+ following depolarization in Ca2+-containing medium. None of the conventional excitatory amino acid receptor antagonists inhibited the Ca2+-mobilizing effects of quisqualate. Furthermore alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionate (AMPA) was unable to produce Ca2+ mobilization in Ca2+-free medium, although it could produce Ca2+ influx in Ca2+-containing medium. Thus, glutamate can produce mobilization of Ca2+ from intracellular stores in hippocampal neurons by acting on a quisqualate-sensitive but AMPA-insensitive receptor. This receptor is therefore distinct from the quisqualate receptor that produces cell depolarization. The possibility that this Ca2+-mobilizing effect is mediated by inositol triphosphate production is discussed.\r"

Most sexually active women are at \"high risk\" for the development of cervical neoplasia because of early sexual activity for multiple sexual partners. All women at high risk should have annual pap smears. If a woman has a pap smear that suggests the presence of CIN (dysplasia or carcinoma in situ), colposcopy should be performed. This office procedure allows for the detection of the areas causing the abnormal cytology. Colposcopy can often allow outpatient therapy of CIN lesions. Conization should be performed only when the colposcopic examination is unsatisfactory or patient or lesion factors are not favorable for office therapy.

Current treatment of PMS includes education and counseling, dietary changes, regular exercise, and possibly vitamin supplementation, diuretics, prostaglandin inhibitors, or progesterone. More well controlled, prospective placebo-controlled studies are needed to help elucidate the etiology and test the effectiveness of these treatments. With the uncertainties surrounding PMS in the 1980s, the potential for quackery is tremendous. In spite of our limitations in knowledge, there is much that can be done for patients with PMS. To serve our patients better, physicians must become better informed about PMS and spend time discussing it with their patients. By educating patients regarding the current state of knowledge of PMS and discussing rational treatment approaches, physicians may avoid driving their patients away to seek treatment with unproven and potentially harmful fad treatments.\r"

As described by Amsel and colleagues, three of four findings indicate bacterial vaginosis: amine odor, pH greater than 4.5, clue cells, and a thin homogeneous discharge. Because G. vaginalis colonizes the vagina, treatment should not be instituted in an asymptomatic woman on the basis of a positive culture. For symptomatic patients, oral metronidazole 500 mg twice daily for 7 days is the treatment currently recommended. Vulvovaginal pruritus should be equated with candidiasis until proven otherwise. Mycelia or spores on 10 per cent KOH preparation are diagnostic of candidiasis in the presence of symptoms. Imidazole creams or suppositories are the treatment of choice. Trichomoniasis is characterized by malodor and mild pruritus. Demonstration of trichomonads on saline preparation or a positive culture provides the diagnosis. A single 2 gm dose of oral metronidazole is the initial treatment. Recurrences should provoke inquiry regarding predisposing factors and investigation of sexual partners. Vaginitis can recur, but if approached properly, these recurrences can be minimized, allowing the patient to proceed with daily life in comfort.\r"

Although most patients have primary dysmenorrhea, which although creating much discomfort does not lead to significant physical problems, it is very important to rule out secondary dysmenorrhea to prevent problems with health and fertility. Primary dysmenorrhea is seen only in ovulatory cycles, usually developing within 6 to 12 months of menarche and is characterized by lower midabdominal colicky pain that may radiate to the back and upper thighs. The pain of primary dysmenorrhea starts with the onset of menstrual flow or a few hours following onset and may last for a few hours up to 2 days. The pain of secondary dysmenorrhea usually begins several days before the start of menstrual flow and may be present during much of the menstrual cycle. Pain that occurs with the first menses or after the age of 25 or is associated with anovulatory cycles is more likely to be secondary dysmenorrhea. The causes of secondary dysmenorrhea, such as endometriosis, adenomyosis, complications of intrauterine devices, and congenital abnormalities, will often be associated with abnormalities noted on pelvic examination, and whenever dysmenorrheic patients have any abnormalities, further evaluation is necessary.\r"

  ".W": "Dysfunctional uterine bleeding is classified by the character of the menstrual cycle: ovulatory or anovulatory. Anovulation can occur at any age and is physiologic in the first year or two after menarche and for several years before menopause. Anovulatory cycles are characteristically irregular and marked by prolonged episodes of bleeding unassociated with signs or symptoms of ovulation. Specific causes of anovulation such as hyperprolactinemia, thyroid disease, androgen excess, anorexia, obesity, and excess exercise can be treated specifically; otherwise, therapy depends upon patient goals. Cycle regulation can be affected by monthly courses of progestin, such as medroxyprogesterone acetate (Provera), 10 mg daily for 10 days each month. Contraception and cycle regulation can both be accomplished with oral contraceptives. Fertility, on the other hand, will require ovulation induction. Ovulatory dysfunctional uterine bleeding most prevalent in parous women between the ages of 20 and 40 is associated with regular cycle intervals and premenstrual molimina. Midcycle and perimenstrual spotting can often be treated with observation only, but depending upon patient and/or physician concerns, periodic hormonal suppression is effective. The management of menorrhagia should include the following: (1) exclusion of pathology in the genital tract; (2) reduction in activity during days of heavy flow; (3) the avoidance of aspirin in the week before and on days of flow; (4) nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs; (5) cycle suppression--oral contraceptives, danazol (Danocrine), depo-progestin; (6) luteal phase progestin; and (7) surgical intervention.\r"

Based on newer studies, the risks for osteoporosis, cardiovascular morbidity, breast carcinoma, symptomatic vasomotor and anatomic changes occurring postmenopausally outweigh the risks of hormone replacement therapy in the end of the 20th century. Women should be instructed in adequate calcium intake, 1000 mg per day premenopausally and 1500 mg per day postmenopausally. Osteoporotic, breast carcinoma, and cardiovascular risks should be investigated at age 35 with appropriate lab screening, including lipoprotein analysis. Screening mammography should begin at age 40, continuing every 5 years until age 50, and yearly between ages 50 and 65. A diet high in calcium, low in cholesterol and fat, and a weight reduction program should be made available as early as possible and continued indefinitely. HRT should be made available beginning at menopause and continued to age 70. Moderate exercise should be encouraged at all ages. The next 5 to 10 years will answer some of the questions about the benefits of long-term HRT postmenopausally, especially with respect to its influence on cardiovascular risk. New progestational agents will probably be developed that will have fewer adverse effects on lipid profiles, while maintaining the protective effect on the endometrium and breast and further influencing the benefits of HRT postmenopausally. Modern medicine certainly cannot ensure living forever. The body of knowledge now available can modify the major causes for morbidity and mortality as the baby boom population reaches their middle age and golden years.\r"

  ".W": "(1) The normal menstrual cycle depends on hormonal relationships between the hypothalamus, pituitary, and ovary. The mechanisms of hormonal control involve both long-looped feedback control (i.e., E2 feedback to the hypothalamus) and local control (i.e., internal ovary). A hormone may have different effects depending on concentration and timing of appearance during the menstrual cycle. (2) There is a single gonadotropin-releasing hormone that governs both FSH and LH release from the pituitary. FSH and LH release is governed by both the concentration and timing of the hypothalamic-releasing factor, GNRH. (3) The follicular or proliferative phase of the menstrual cycle is characterized by the selective development of a dominant follicle. The follicular phase biochemistry is notable for increasing estradiol production, which inhibits GNRH secretion but increases the gonadotropin pool and prepares the follicle for LH influence by stimulating LH receptors. (4) Ovulation occurs secondary to LH surge triggered by increasing levels of E2 acting in a positive feedback loop on the pituitary. (5) Corpus luteum development is signaled by increasing serum progesterone and is largely an autonomous ovarian phenomenon not subject to a great deal of control by hypothalamic or pituitary hormonal controls, because high levels of progesterone inhibit GNRH and gonadotropins.\r"

  ".W": "Non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus patients are those patients who do not require insulin for survival and do not have gestational, secondary, or malnutrition-related diabetes. They may require insulin to maintain good health. Therapy in NIDDM should attempt to reverse the coexisting defects of insulin deficiency and insulin resistance that lead to hepatic glucose over-production and diminished glucose tissue utilization. Both sulfonylureas and insulin can achieve near normal FPGs and HbA1c concentrations in mild to moderately severe NIDDM. Both can reduce insulin resistance and both increase insulin availability. Evidence exists, however, showing that prevention of post-prandial hyperglycemia, whose significance is unknown, may require soluble preprandial insulin. Treatment goals should be realistic and discussed with the patient. In younger patients, the aim should be to achieve normoglycemia, while in those who have other significant medical or social problems, or who are of advanced age, diabetic control may, out of necessity, need to be relaxed. At presentation a diet and exercise program should be initiated and the patient observed if clinically well. If diet fails to reduce the FPG below 108 mg/dl, additional therapy should be used. In mild to moderate NIDDM, sulfonylurea or basal insulin (given as once daily long- or intermediate-acting insulin) can be equally successful without the need for rigid dietary habits. More severe degrees of NIDDM or patients with sulfonylurea failure not caused by dietary indiscretion will require more complex insulin regimens. The socially dependent patient requiring insulin should have as simple a regimen as possible. The insulin-resistant patient undergoing surgery or with an intercurrent illness is most easily managed with a variable rate insulin infusion that allows prediction of subsequent subcutaneous insulin requirements. Combination insulin-sulfonylurea therapy should be reserved for patients failing to achieve acceptable glycemic control when insulin and sulphonylurea are used separately. It may improve control or lessen insulin requirements.\r"

CT was superior to cholangiography in characterization of the status of the intrahepatic duct system in 11 of 20 cases. In addition, CT demonstrated extrabiliary complications of PSC in 12 cases and superimposed cholangiocarcinoma in three cases.

All four developed biliary obstruction due to malignant stricture at the bile duct anastomosis 9-15 months after transplantation. Diagnosis of recurrent CCA was made by means of transhepatic brush biopsy in two patients. Recognition that the biliary tract, especially the anastomosis, is a site of recurrence of CCA should facilitate prompt diagnosis by means of transhepatic brush biopsy in patients with biliary obstruction due to stricture. In addition, because of an association between CCA and primary sclerosing cholangitis, preoperative bile duct biopsy should be considered for liver transplantation candidates with the latter condition. Positive biopsy findings may preclude transplantation.\r"

Patients were divided into obstructed and unobstructed groups with endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography criteria. Measurements from the liver, duodenum, and bowel curves contributed little to the analysis. The washout phase of the bile duct curve showed intermittent emptying in both obstructed and unobstructed groups. Less than one-third of peak activity remained in both groups at 90 minutes. Retention fell more rapidly in the later portion of the sequence in patients with obstruction. Quantification was essential, since differences were subtle and could not be appreciated visually. In the absence of hepatocellular disease, the most reliable criterion was the time at which maximal bile duct activity occurred. A cutoff level of 29 minutes or more was used in the diagnosis of obstruction. A sensitivity of 93% with an adequate specificity of 64% and an overall accuracy of 80% was achieved in the prediction of obstruction.\r"

Samples obtained from three (3%) patients showed insufficient cell growth; two of these patients elected a repeat procedure, which yielded a normal karyotype in each case. There were five abnormal karyotypes, one of which was a culture artifact; in the latter case, repeat amniocentesis at 15 weeks yielded a normal result. Of the 95 pregnancies with normal karyotypes, 94 were progressing normally at follow-up, and one patient elected pregnancy termination because of maternal indications. It appears that early amniocentesis may be an attractive alternative to traditional amniocentesis, in that it provides results at an earlier gestational age and may avoid certain disadvantages of chorionic villus sampling.\r"

Conversely, all 12 fetuses with demise or an uncertain prognosis demonstrated additional sonographic abnormalities, and six showed stable or progressive ventricular dilatation on follow-up sonograms.

In this study, a group of term neonates whose physical examinations were normal were examined with US on the 1st and 2d days of life. Each hip was imaged in the transverse plane in nonstressed and stressed positions, and movement of the femoral head under stress was quantitated. This displacement under stress was used to establish a normal range of hip instability in neonates. Patterns of hip laxity in boys and girls are identical, and in most infants hip instability diminishes between the 1st and 2d days of life. Our method of quantitating hip instability produces consistent results, with intraobserver 95% confidence intervals of +/- 1.2 mm for each measurement.\r"

All patients were women. Two patients were found at sonography to have normal parotid glands. Four patients had multiple cystic changes in the parotid glands bilaterally. Each of these four patients had a clinical diagnosis of Sjogren syndrome. One of the four underwent sialography, which demonstrated characteristic sialectasia. Pathologic examination of an excised gland in one of the patients with Sjogren syndrome demonstrated typical benign lymphoepithelial aggregates, which cause obstruction and progressive ductal dilatation. While parotid enlargement in these patients may be due to salivary tumor, lymphoma, or sarcoidosis--all of which appear as solid lesions at sonography--this study suggests that bilateral cystic changes may be the rule in uncomplicated cases of Sjogren syndrome.\r"

In disk space infection with osteomyelitis and in retrospinal abscess, MR images showed characteristic findings, whereas in myelitis, MR images demonstrated nonspecific abnormalities. The appearance on MR images of epidural abscesses ranged from clearly identifiable extradural masses with high-intensity signal on spin-echo T2-weighted images to extensive inhomogeneous collections of mixed signal intensities, difficult to distinguish from adjacent meningitis. Myelography with high-resolution computed tomography (CT) and intraoperative spinal US was superior to MR imaging in demonstrating epidural abscesses when there was concomitant meningitis. With intraoperative spinal US, epidural abscesses could be located and their decompression monitored. MR imaging is recommended as the initial screening procedure in spinal infection; in those few patients with nondiagnostic MR images, myelography with high-resolution CT should be the supplementary study. If surgery is planned, intraoperative spinal US should be used.\r"

  ".W": "Accurate use and interpretation of exercise test results depend on an understanding of physiologic principles, meticulous attention to proper methodology, and realization of the appropriate applications and limitations of testing. Understanding the relationship between myocardial and ventilatory oxygen consumption and exercise test variables will aid in the diagnosis and prognostic evaluation. Use of proper methodology in preparing the patient, performing the examination, and interpreting the results is critical to obtaining the maximum information with maximum safety for each individual patient. Improvements in methodology including the use of the Borg scale to estimate individual effort, abandonment of the predicted maximum heart rate, and the increased use of ventilatory oxygen uptake measurements should be applied. Exercise capacity should not be reported in total time but rather as the VO2 or MET equivalent of the workload achieved. This permits the comparison of the results of many different exercise testing protocols. The most useful exercise ECG variable for the diagnosis of coronary artery disease remains the ST segment shift. Unfortunately, it is not as helpful in localizing myocardial ischemia. Diagnostic accuracy can be improved by adjusting ST depressions for exercise-induced heart rate increase. Accuracy can be further increased by combining ECG, clinical, and radionuclide variables in probabilistic formulas that retain the independent diagnostic information from each variable and accurately predict disease probability. To avoid errors in clinical decision making, care must be used to insure that the mathematical formula used was derived from a population of patients that is similar to those being tested. The clinical applications for exercise testing include diagnosis of patients with chest pain syndromes, determination of disease severity, and prognosis in patients with known coronary artery disease, evaluation of arrhythmias, screening of asymptomatic patients, and evaluation of medical, surgical, and angioplastic therapy for coronary disease. In spite of studies involving thousands of patients, controversy exists regarding the diagnostic power of exercise testing. The large differences in reported accuracies are largely due to methodologic problems that have been encountered by various investigators. Clinicians should be made aware of these problems when reading the literature on ECG and radionuclide exercise testing. Such awareness will help them understand the limitations of these noninvasive procedures.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

The use of gene probes for epidemiologic purposes is becoming commoner. A semiempirical classification scheme has been proposed using substrate profiles and inhibition by clavulanic acid and aztreonam as criteria. Class 1 cephalosporinases are potently inhibited by aztreonam but poorly inhibited by clavulanate, whereas class 2 penicillinases and broad-spectrum beta-lactamases have very poor affinities for aztreonam but are inhibited by clavulanic acid. Class 3 beta-lactamases include the metalloenzymes. Resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics can be related to many beta-lactamase-mediated phenomena, including increased frequency of beta-lactamase production in clinical isolates, wider distribution of beta-lactamase-mediating plasmids, production of multiple beta-lactamases, induction of chromosomal class 1 cephalosporinases, selection of depressed mutants for production of class 1 enzymes, leakage of beta-lactamase from gram-negative organisms, functions of penicillin-binding proteins as beta-lactamases, and identification of novel beta-lactamases.\r"

The availability of the amino acid sequences of several low-molecular-weight PBPs, high-molecular-weight PBPs, and active-site serine beta-lactamases has provided evidence that these groups of enzymes have a common, but distant, evolutionary origin. This view is strongly supported by the recent finding of a similarity in the three-dimensional structures of a low-molecular-weight PBP and class A beta-lactamases. The high-molecular-weight PBPs of Escherichia coli are believed to possess an amino-terminal peptidoglycan transglycosylase domain and a carboxy-terminal penicillin-sensitive transpeptidase domain. These enzymes are inserted in the cytoplasmic membrane only at their amino termini, and water-soluble forms have been obtained that should be suitable for crystallization and X-ray analysis. Resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics mediated by alterations of PBPs has been reported in some gram-negative bacteria. In isolates of Neisseria gonorrhoeae with chromosomally mediated resistance, penicillin-resistant PBPs have arisen from the introduction of multiple amino acid substitutions within the transpeptidase domain of the enzymes.\r"

On the basis of known primary and tertiary structures, predictive studies support the view that these proteins or domains form a superfamily of evolutionarily related enzymes. Although--depending on the evolutionary distance--they may have very different amino acid sequences and distinct functional characteristics and specificities, they all would have conserved the same unprecedented type of polypeptide scaffolding. When obtained, complete structural information should provide the necessary tools for the rational design of novel types of inactivators of these important enzyme targets.\r"

  ".W": "The molecular mechanism of the hydrolysis of penicillin by penicillin-binding protein (PBP) 5 was investigated. Cysteine-115 had been previously implicated in the hydrolysis of the acyl-enzyme intermediate in PBP5. In studies with oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis, the role of cysteine-115 in the mechanism of PBP5 was investigated by the mutation of this residue to either a serine or an alanine residue. Genetic truncation of the studied proteins at their carboxyl termini resulted in the production of a soluble form of these proteins (sPBPs). The purified sPBPs were assayed for both their beta-lactamase and their D-alanine carboxypeptidase activities. The results of these assays indicate that the cysteine residue does not directly participate in the enzymatic mechanism. In a further investigation of the catalytic mechanism of beta-lactam hydrolysis, a soluble, naturally occurring mutant was purified in large amounts and crystallized from concentrated polyethylene glycol solutions. This mutant of PBP5 (sPBP5') has a near-normal acylation rate with respect to [14C]penicillin, but shows a drastic increase in the half-life of the acyl-enzyme complex. The crystals of sPBP5' diffract to greater than 3 A resolution and are suitable for detailed crystallographic analysis.\r"

The two cephalosporinase genes were cloned into strains of Escherichia coli. The production of these cephalosporinases in strains of E. coli, as well as in the derepressed mutants of C. freundii and P. vulgaris, caused a decrease in susceptibility to the newer cephalosporins. The difference in the rate of hydrolysis at a 0.1 microM concentration of substrate adequately explains the difference in antibacterial activity between cefotaxime and BMY-28142 against E. coli strains with the two cephalosporinases. The results indicate that hydrolysis rate at low substrate concentration, rather than binding with beta-lactams, would be a limiting factor in resistance. The low affinity of cephalosporinases for BMY-28142 means high stability of the agent to the enzymes at low concentration. Furthermore, outer membrane permeability affects the susceptibility of E. coli to cephalosporins synergistically with hydrolysis by cephalosporinases.\r"

The drug concentrations in the periplasm could be calculated on the basis of parameters obtained experimentally, and the calculated values were in fair agreement with the experimental values. The effect of beta-lactamase activity (Vmax/Km) and the outer membrane barrier on the elevation of MICs was observed to be synergistic, and the contribution of beta-lactamase was more effectively expressed in the bacterial cells with higher outer membrane barrier.\r"

The beta-lactamase is encoded by the chromosomal ampC gene, and its induction is governed by the ampR regulatory gene, which encodes an activator of ampC transcription. The ampD gene acts, probably indirectly, as a repressor of beta-lactamase synthesis, and it is in this gene that mutations leading to enzyme overproduction are located.\r"

Resistance has emerged in 14%-56% of patients infected with these organisms and treated with one of the newer cephalosporins. The emergence of resistance has been associated with clinical failure or relapse in 25%-75% of these patients. Combination therapy appears to have little impact on rates of resistance or its clinical consequences. Multiply resistant organisms have spread widely in some hospitals, and this trend has been correlated closely with the extent of use of the newer cephalosporins. The magnitude of the problem is frequently underestimated because many properly performed susceptibility tests fail to detect resistance when it is actually present and because some methods used to calculate rates minimize the impact of the emergence of resistance among organisms with inducible beta-lactamases.\r"

From 1984 to June 1987, 490 CTX-1-producing strains of Enterobacteriaceae were isolated. The second plasmid-mediated beta-lactamase (CAZ-1) was isolated in 1987 from three K. pneumoniae strains more resistant to ceftazidime than to other third-generation cephalosporins. This broad-spectrum beta-lactamase differed from CTX-1 by its isoelectric point--close to 5.6--and its high hydrolytic activity on ceftazidime and was encoded by a 150-kilobase plasmid. It was demonstrated that these expanded-spectrum beta-lactamases are TEM derivatives.\r"

  ".W": "TEM-7, a novel TEM-type beta-lactamase (pI 5.41) encoded on a plasmid of approximately 85 kilobases, was found in a clinical isolate of Citrobacter freundii. Strains containing this enzyme exhibited decreased susceptibility to ceftazidime (64-fold) and aztreonam (16-fold) but not to other third-generation cephalosporins. Addition of a beta-lactamase inhibitor--clavulanic acid, sulbactam, or YTR 830--restored normal susceptibility to associated compounds such as ampicillin, piperacillin, ceftazidime, and aztreonam. DNA-DNA hybridization of an intragenic probe of TEM-1 occurred with a 19-kilobase EcoRI fragment of the plasmid encoding TEM-7. A TEM-2 derivative, TEM-201, with characteristics similar to those of TEM-7 was selected spontaneously in the presence of ceftazidime in vitro.\r"

  ".W": "Infections due to strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, and Citrobacter freundii resistant to third-generation cephalosporins have been observed recently in France and the Federal Republic of Germany. This resistance phenotype is due to the production of new plasmid-mediated, broad-substrate-range beta-lactamases designated TEM-3 to TEM-7. DNA-DNA hybridization analysis with a probe specific for TEM-1 indicated that the corresponding genes blaT-3 to blaT-7 were variants of the structural genes for TEM-type beta-lactamases. In the present studies, a 2.5-kilobase BamHI plasmid DNA fragment encoding TEM-3 was cloned in E. coli, and the entire nucleotide sequence of blaT-3 was determined. The deduced amino acid sequence of TEM-3 differed in two positions from that of the TEM-2 enzyme: lysine (TEM-3) was substituted for glutamic acid (TEM-2) at residue 104 and serine (TEM-3) for glycine (TEM-2) at residue 238 in the numbering system of Ambler. Spontaneous mutants of TEM penicillinases with increased activity against third-generation cephalosporins were obtained in vitro by selection on cefotaxime or ceftazidime. It therefore appears that mutations in TEM-type beta-lactamases contribute to resistance to new-generation cephalosporins.\r"

All of these enzymes are synthesized constitutively, demonstrate efficient hydrolysis of penicillins, are highly susceptible to the action of clavulanic acid and sulbactam, and have no detectable activity against the cephamycins and imipenem. With the methoxyimino cephalosporins, including those of the third generation, the rates of hydrolysis observed for the SHV-2, CTX-1, and CAZ-1 enzymes are high and show no relation to those observed for the other presently known beta-lactamases. Structure-activity relations suggest that the oxime substituent of these cephalosporins is a major structural factor in the catalytic process observed with the three new beta-lactamases.\r"

The target of this antibiotic is penicillin-binding protein 2 (PBP2), which is active in cell wall elongation and responsible for the rod-like shape of the organism. Several observations indicate that PBP2 remains active in the mutant. For example, cells are small and rod-shaped in the absence of mecillinam but become spherical in its presence; the formation of filaments in the presence of furazlocillin shows that cell wall elongation still takes place. The mutant also has a low growth rate and small cell volume, even in rich medium. In these respects, the mutant resembles cya or crp strains (in which the cyclic adenosine monophosphate-catabolite activator protein [cAMP-CAP] complex is inactive), although its catabolic capacities are unaffected. The mutation, called lov, lies at 41 minutes on the E. coli genetic map. The phenotype is partially suppressed by the P1-mediated transduction of an rpsL ribosomal mutation conferring streptomycin resistance.\r"

First isolated from sera obtained for studies on hepatitis B in 1975, it was not until 1981 that infection with this small, single-stranded DNA virus was related to aplastic crisis associated with hemolytic anemia. A nonspecific viral prodrome, the occurrence in family members, and epidemics of aplastic crisis suggested the infectious etiology. Human parvovirus infection has since been associated with arthritis, erythema infectiosum (fifth disease), fetal death, and hydrops fetalis. Through the use of recently developed serologic tests, epidemics of erythema infectiosum and parvoviral infection have been related not only to aplastic crisis but also to intrauterine infection and hydrops; DNA hybridization studies have allowed the detection of viral DNA in serum and tissue extracts. Studies have been hampered by the lack of an ability to culture the virus, but this is now possible utilizing bone marrow culture and erythropoietin. This article is a historical and clinical review of human parvovirus infection and disease and considers potential questions regarding their consequences.\r"

The case-fatality rate for the 13 cases for which the outcome is known is 61.5%. The majority of known cases have occurred in immunocompromised patients, particularly those with hematologic malignancy or cirrhosis. Host susceptibility is potentially important in this condition. Bacterial products such as a cholera-like toxin and El Tor hemolysin also may play a role in the disease process. The incidence of enteritis due to non-O:1 V. cholerae is unclear because of the methods used for routine stool culture; however, the small number of reported isolates from blood is likely to reflect the infrequency of bacteremia, since Vibrio species are readily identifiable on sheep blood agar. While non-O:1 V. cholerae is sensitive to most antibiotics in vitro, no data are available on antibiotic efficacy.\r"

The most frequently cited estimate of 25,000 to 50,000 cases of legionella pneumonia per year in the United States is based on a single study with a number of methodologic limitations. While numerous studies of the etiology of pneumonia have been published, it is usually not possible to calculate incidence from these investigations. The proportion of pneumonia cases attributable to legionella species has ranged from less than 1% to greater than 30%. Differences in the diagnostic methods employed in various studies and questions concerning the representativeness of the patients studied make it difficult to determine how much of the observed variation is due to true geographic and temporal differences in the incidence of legionella pneumonia. Further studies are needed to define the incidence of acute lower respiratory tract infections due to Legionella.\r"

In Plasmodium falciparum infection, blood smear preparations fall into two categories that are distinguishable at all levels of parasitemia; one type of preparation contains only pigment-deficient trophozoites, and the other type contains only pigment-rich trophozoites. Pigment accumulates in the residual body of the mature schizont and is lost upon rupture of the schizont. In contrast, pigment remains associated with the macrogametocyte and developing oocyst. Certain antimalarial drugs, such as chloroquine, have distinct effects on pigment clumping. These observations raise questions regarding the current idea of pigment as an inert excretory product of hemoglobin metabolism. It is suggested that pigment particles represent stacked utilizable intermediates of hemoglobin digestion that accumulate in the gametocyte to serve as a food reserve during the growth cycle in the mosquito.\r"

Features present in these two cases but not in the four uncomplicated cases were infection caused by Staphylococcus aureus and persistence of systemic signs of infection for more than 2 days after catheter removal. A review of the literature showed that these two features have been noted in almost all adult patients previously reported to develop arterial rupture as a complication and not in patients with uncomplicated arterial catheter-related sepsis.

Precursors of these IgA-producing cells originate in gut-associated lymphoid tissue and, to a lesser extent, in bronchial-associated lymphoid tissue and migrate via the blood not only to gut but also to other mucosal tissues, forming a common mucosal immune system. Oral administration of antigen leads to priming of precursor cells in the gut and subsequent occurrence of specific secretory IgA (S-IgA) antibody in saliva, milk, tears, and the respiratory and genital tracts. On the basis of a review of the world literature, it has been concluded that oral live vaccines elicit higher antibody titers in remote-site secretions and in serum than do oral killed vaccines, which usually stimulate only relatively low levels of local secretory antibody. Oral immunization induces S-IgA in children and adults (including the elderly) without detectable adverse effects. Despite a number of remaining questions, oral immunization against extraintestinal infections is a promising area for future clinical studies.\r"

Patients given gentamicin or sisomicin seemed to run a higher risk of nephrotoxicity than those given amikacin; the risk for patients receiving tobramycin was lower than that for patients given gentamicin but higher than that for those given netilmicin. The only statistically significant difference with regard to auditory toxicity was a lower risk among patients receiving netilmicin than among those given amikacin or tobramycin. Meaningful differences in toxicity may exist for individual aminoglycosides given in efficacious doses. Future trials must include sample sizes sufficient to detect differences of the magnitudes observed in this overview. In the absence of such data, the overview may guide clinicians in determining the risk-to-benefit ratio for a particular aminoglycoside, especially for patients at high risk of toxicity.\r"

The English-language literature on this topic has been summarized and a working hypothesis devised describing a mechanism whereby intestinal bacteria can escape and cause systemic disease. It is postulated that the motile phagocyte ingests intestinal bacteria, transports them to extraintestinal sites, fails to accomplish intracellular killing, and then liberates the bacteria in the extraintestinal site. This hypothesis is consistent with many observations found in the literature: (1) The intestinal bacteria that most readily translocate out of the intestinal tract are classified as facultative intracellular pathogens. (2) Intestinal particles with no intrinsic motility (e.g., yeast, ferritin, starch) can translocate out of the intestinal lumen within hours after their ingestion. (3) The rate of translocation of intestinal bacteria can be altered with agents that modulate immune (including phagocytic) function. In the context of the mechanisms involved in intestinal immune responses, bacterial translocation appears to be a part of the normal antigen-sampling process of gut-associated lymphoid tissue. Systemic disease caused by translocating intestinal bacteria could be due to a maladaptation of the antigen-sampling process that has been designed to regulate the immune response to intestinal antigens.\r"

Taxonomic schemes currently allow for the identification of six Aeromonas species (five mesophilic and one psychrophilic), four of the five mesophilic species having been recovered from infectious processes or isolated from clinical material of human origin. Two major categories of human illness attributed to Aeromonas species have been observed: acute gastroenteritis in both pediatric and adult populations and disseminated disease (e.g., bacteremia) in persons with underlying hematologic malignancies or hepatic dysfunctions. Although the role of mesophilic aeromonads as important agents of bacterial gastroenteritis remains unconfirmed because of the inability to fulfill Koch's postulates (no animal model), several lines of compelling clinical and laboratory evidence indicate that these microorganisms are significant enteric pathogens.\r"

K. kingae is a slow-growing, fastidious, gram-negative microorganism that colonizes mucous membranes of the upper respiratory tract. Infections were predominantly seen in infants and young children (86% of cases) and were preceded by an upper respiratory tract infection in 31% of patients. Low-grade fever (38 degrees C-39 degrees C) and pain or swelling involving the affected limb developed insidiously. However, 76% of the infections were diagnosed within 1 week after the onset of symptoms. The knee was involved in 47% and the hip in 33% of cases of arthritis. Osteomyelitis mainly involved the femur (36%); four cases of osteomyelitis (29%) were diagnosed as diskitis. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate was greater than 20 mm/h in all patients. Gram stains of aspiration fluid were positive in 19% of cases, whereas blood cultures yielded growth in only 5%. Radiographic signs indicating the presence of osteomyelitis were observed in 93% of patients. All patients recovered completely. K. kingae is an important causative agent in indolent bone, joint, and intervertebral disk infections.\r"

The capsule, an alpha-2----8-linked homopolymer of sialic acid (NeuNAc), provides the bacterium with a physical antiphagocytic barrier. Structural similarities between K1 and human tissue components suggest that immune tolerance may also be a factor in pathogenesis of K1 disease. The molecular and genetic events involved in the synthesis and export of the K1 polysaccharide were examined. The cloned K1 genes encode at least 12 proteins involved in capsule biosynthesis. These genes appear to be coordinately regulated and functionally clustered. One cluster is associated with the synthesis and activation of NeuNAc and includes the gene encoding CMP-NeuNAc synthetase. This enzyme catalyzes the activation of NeuNAc to CMP-NeuNAc. A second region, encoding five proteins, is associated with translocation of polysaccharide to the bacterial surface. The K1 polysaccharide is a poor immunogen in humans, and an understanding of the key reactions involved in K1 synthesis may help in providing an alternative to anticapsular immunity.\r"

Different species of Neisseria commonly make lipooligosaccharides of identical Mr and epitope content. Differences in oligosaccharides account for most of the observed physical heterogeneity. Oligosaccharides consist of (1) partially conserved and highly substituted basal oligosaccharides that branch at heptose residues; (2) a linear segment consisting of (hexose)n residues that determines the length of the oligosaccharide; and (3) terminal sequences that are similar to those of glycosphingolipids. Epitope expression is linked to physical heterogeneity and is modified by the molecular environment of the outer membrane. Serotype epitopes are present only on lipooligosaccharides of a certain Mr. Certain lipooligosaccharides regulate complement activation onto the bacterial surface and, hence, immune lysis.\r"

Most E. coli pyelonephritis isolates express pili encoded by the pyelonephritis-associated pili (pap) gene cluster. The pap DNA sequence encodes pilin monomers that are assembled into pili fibers; pap also encodes adhesins that recent results suggest might be located at the tips of the pilus fibers. The study presented here is a status report of work that has two major goals: to determine (1) if any Pap proteins associate with pili and (2) if Pap proteins not required for pili assembly affect levels of pili-cell surface expression. To address the first aim, antisera to pili were used to precipitate pili from detergent extracts containing 35S-labeled Pap proteins. The results suggested that a protein of 16-kilodaltons apparent molecular mass associated with pili. Other interpretations of the data are discussed. The second aim was addressed by constructing E. coli strains that contained different pap regions. With the use of electron microscopy and a pili ELISA, it was found that E. coli containing a 6.5-kilobase-pair region of pap expressed low levels of pili, but no P-adhesin was detected. Transformation of this E. coli strain with a plasmid containing an additional 3.5-kilobase-pair pap DNA sequence resulted in an eightfold increase in pili expression as well as expression of P adhesin. These results indicated that pili expression was affected by Pap proteins not required for pili assembly.\r"

To recover these proteins in outer membranes, it was necessary to transfer the Y. pestis low-Ca++ response plasmid to Yersinia pseudotuberculosis.

Agglutinogens 2 and 3 and filamentous hemagglutinin lie outside the outer membrane, the first two as fimbriae and the last as a microcapsule. Adenylate cyclase and pertussis toxin are present in the outer membrane but may be present transiently or present in small amounts.\r"

The on-and-off genetic regulation of expression, referred to as phase variation, has been found to be regulated at the level of transcription by the inversion of a 314-base-pair segment of DNA. Morphogenesis of the organelles, which depends on the assembly of processed subunits of 17,000-dalton mass, has been found to proceed from the addition of new subunits at the base, rather than at the tip, of the organelle. Although the precise role of type 1 fimbriae in the pathogenesis of E. coli infections is still somewhat obscure, new data indicate that they significantly potentiate the uptake of nutrients from and the delivery of toxins to eukaryotic cells.\r"

The cell wall of Staphylococcus aureus has a pattern of surface proteins; the predominant one is protein A. Virulent S. aureus strains may also produce polysaccharide capsules in vivo that impede opsonization and phagocytosis in the absence of anticapsular antibody. Coagulase-negative staphylococci commonly elaborate an exopolysaccharide slime that may promote adherence to plastic surfaces and interfere with host responses. Structure-function relationships for some antiphagocytic M proteins of group A streptococci are now well understood, and recombinant techniques offer the prospect of multivalent vaccines. The best known surface protein of group B streptococci is the c (Ibc) protein, which stimulates protective antibody in animals and may be an important virulence factor. Monoclonal antibodies to types Ib, II, and III group B streptococci have also confirmed the presence of multiple immunodeterminants on these antiphagocytic polysaccharides. A protein on the surface of pneumococci has been shown to induce protective antibody and to enhance pneumococcal virulence in mice, suggesting a potential alternative or adjunct to pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccines. Listeria also possess a variety of cell surface structures important in pathogenesis. Surface components are, therefore, critical determinants of the interaction of gram-positive bacteria with the host.\r"

From DNA sequencing of the M6 protein gene, it has been determined that the C-terminal end contains a membrane anchor and an adjacent cell wall stabilization domain, both of which are similar to C-terminal regions of surface proteins in other gram-positive organisms. Studies with monoclonal antibodies revealed that the C-terminal half of the protein is conserved among M proteins of different serotypes, whereas the N-terminal half varies. The M protein contains tandem repeats, which, through homologous recombination, are responsible for the observed size variation of the M proteins from different streptococcal strains. M protein size mutants occur in a laboratory-grown culture at a frequency of 1/2,000 colony-forming units. DNA sequence analysis of the M gene in size mutants derived from a single strain suggests that sequence changes which result from homologous recombination may play a role in the antigenic variation of M protein.\r"

The c protein components were immunogenic in mice and rabbits. Polyclonal rabbit antisera were protective in the infant rat model of bacteremia/sepsis and facilitated killing of type II strains bearing the c protein in an in vitro opsonophagocytic bacterial killing assay. The role of the IgA-binding capacity of the c protein in altering the interaction of group B streptococcal strains with host defenses remains undefined at this time.\r"

It is similar to the variable V-1 surface antigen of Mycoplasma pulmonis. Data on U. urealyticum are only preliminary, but the ureaplasma antigen, if it proves to be analogous to V-1, may provide the antigenic determinants for distinguishing among serovars or serogroups and correlating them with pathogenicity. Surface proteins of M. hominis were identified with use of 125I surface labeling, [35S]methionine metabolic labeling, and immunoadsorption of rabbit antiserum. Comparison of M. hominis reference strains PG-21 and 4195 showed little homology between surface proteins, although with metabolic labeling they appeared essentially identical. Immunoblotting with patients' sera, using PG-21 as antigen, showed that most reactions were directed to surface proteins and that a 102K antigen (MH1) was recognized by 94% of the sera. MH1 was one of the few surface proteins of PG-21 that appeared to have counterparts in the other six reference strains, making MH1 a prime candidate for reliable and specific detection of M. hominis infection.\r"

In Borrelia hermsii, an agent of tick-borne relapsing fever, a switch in serotype is associated with a change in the predominant protein on the surface of the cells. The variable major proteins differ from one another in primary structure along their lengths. Genes encoding the different variable major proteins can be found in both \"silent\" and \"active\" environments. At the active site the gene is expressed; at the silent site the gene appears to be in storage. In variant cells, which express the new serotype-specific surface protein in a population, a gene from a silent site has replaced the previously sitting gene at the active site through transposition.\r"

In recent years, several laboratories have begun applying recombinant DNA technology to the study of this organism. Recent work is summarized concerning the expression of T. pallidum DNA in Escherichia coli. A number of E. coli clones expressing treponemal protein antigens have been identified. In one instance, a recombinant protein was purified to homogeneity and shown to be identical to a highly immunogenic, native T. pallidum membrane protein of molecular weight 39,000, which was designated the basic membrane protein (BMP) of this organism. In addition, recent experiments are described that were designed to identify cell-surface proteins that would serve as the primary focus of our cloning efforts. Results obtained with use of several different approaches strongly suggest that the outer membrane of T. pallidum is an antigenically inert structure largely devoid of protein. However, a class of low-molecular-weight protein antigens have been identified that are actively secreted into the extracellular medium. Attempts currently are being made to clone these secreted proteins and investigate their roles in the pathogenesis and immunobiology of syphilis.\r"

  ".W": "The antigenic heterogeneity of Trichomonas vaginalis is due in part to the membrane disposition of immunogens (repertoire A) among some but not all isolates and among subpopulations of trichomonads of certain isolates. Heterogeneous T. vaginalis isolates undergo phenotypic variation for the A repertoire of immunogens. The presence of immunogens on (A+ phenotype) or the absence of them from (A- phenotype) trichomonal surfaces clearly influences the virulence traits of the pathogenic human trichomonads. A- parasites, for example, possess an enhanced ability to cause cytadherence-dependent killing of HeLa cells as compared with A+ parasites. A relation between phenotype of repertoire A and adherence was further substantiated by fractionating parasites of a parent T. vaginalis isolate, yielding adherent and nonadherent subpopulations. Trichomonad proteins were identified as putative adhesin candidates (repertoire B); adhesins were synthesized only by adherent (B+ parasites). Flow cytofluorometry of B+ and B- (nonadherent) subpopulations with antibody to proteins of the A repertoire demonstrated corresponding A- B+ and A+ B- phenotypes, respectively. Data support the hypothesis that trichomonads of some isolates of T. vaginalis undergo alternating expression of at least two classes of surface markers.\r"

More recently, because surface-associated components are known to be elaborated and circulate during serious episodes of candidiasis, investigators have taken interest in the opportunistic fungus Candida albicans. This review emphasizes the immunomodulatory activities of mannan and cell wall-derived glycoproteins from C. albicans. Mannan extracted with hot citrate buffer has been shown in an antibody-forming cell assay to be a heterogeneous mixture with components capable of enhancing or suppressing antibody responses when administered to mice at or near the time of immunization with type III pneumococcal polysaccharide (SSS-III), a T helper cell-independent antigen, or with sheep erythrocytes (SRBC), a T helper cell-dependent antigen. The components responsible for these opposing effects have been separated on the basis of size or charge by column chromatography. Two similar cell wall glycoproteins, removed from isolated cell walls by different procedures, induced enhancement only of the immune response to SSS-III and SRBC. The mechanism(s) by which these polysaccharides effect modulatory activity has not been elucidated. The enhancing property does not appear related to a direct mitogenic effect on lymphocytes or to stimulation of the production of B cell growth factors or interleukin 2.\r"

Mannoprotein fractions from yeast and mycelial forms were obtained by affinity chromatography on concanavalin A and analyzed with use of patient sera or sera from rabbits infected with live wt cells and boosted with whole extracts or rabbits immunized with purified wt cell wall preparations. A spike-formed precipitate was detected only with the wt yeast cells with crossed-electrophoresis and patient and rabbit sera. Otherwise serum from infected rabbits precipitated about equally the wt and m-10 cell wall mannoprotein antigens. The nature of this precipitate, with extremely slow electromobility in the first dimension and the possibility of its relation to some special immunodeterminant of the wt mannan molecule, is discussed. Likewise, when mycelial mannoproteins were analyzed by crossed-immunoelectrophoresis, a precipitate specific for wt cells was observed with rabbit anti-Candida sera. Also, a mannoprotein of approximately 47 kilodaltons was observed by western blotting only for wt mycelial cells. The observed antigenic differences between the virulent and the avirulent derived strain might be related to the greater adherence and infectivity of the wt strain.\r"

For example, inhaled spores or conidia of Rhizopus or Aspergillus lose their surface hydrophobic outer layers, initially swell, and then germinate to form mycelia that may invade tissues. These various fungal forms not only elicit differing response from host phagocytic cells but also differ in their susceptibilities to cellular microbicidal mechanisms. In addition, studies comparing neutrophil activation responses to opsonized and unopsonized Candida hyphae indicate that the presence or absence of antibody or complement on fungal surfaces determines distinct patterns of the early responses of neutrophils to stimulation, such as membrane depolarization, cytosolic increase in calcium, and phosphoinositide turnover. These initial events in the neutrophil activation sequence are followed by release of both fungicidal granule constituents and oxidants from the respiratory burst. The quantity and specificity of delivery of these toxic neutrophil products ultimately determine the relative efficiency of fungicidal activity versus inflammatory cytotoxicity to host cells.\r"

Patients with systemic cyptococcosis generally have cryptococcal antigen in their body fluids; levels of antigen directly correlate with severity of the disease. With use of a murine model, it was documented that cell-mediated immunity is an important protective mechanism and that an epitope(s) on the mannoprotein fraction of the cryptococcal antigen present in a culture filtrate is recognized in cell-mediated immunity. Sera from mice infected with C. neoformans will induce suppressor cells that suppress cell-mediated immunity, as measured by the delayed-type hypersensitivity response, and the level of cryptococcal antigen in the serum directly correlates with the degree of suppression induced. There is no correlation with the amount of anticryptococcal antibody and the ability of the serum to induce suppression. Further, it was demonstrated that cryptococcal antigen, when injected into mice at concentrations similar to those found in human systemic cryptococcosis, induces a complex series of suppressor cells and factors that specifically suppress the delayed-type hypersensitivity response and protective immunity to cryptococci.\r"

Studies in our laboratory have shown that incubation of encapsulated cryptococci in normal human serum leads to deposition of large amounts of C3 fragments at the surface of the yeast and lesser amounts of IgG within the capsule. Thus, the capsule mediates two biologic activities with opposing effects. It is our current view that phagocytosis of the yeast is dependent on a balance between the antiphagocytic action of cryptococcal polysaccharide and the ability of the yeast to focus opsonically active complement fragments and the IgG at the capsular surface.\r"

However, specific induction of SIgA antibodies occurs largely through the common mucosal immune system, whereby antigens presented to the mucosa-associated lymphoid tissues, such as intestinal Peyer's patches, stimulate B lymphocytes committed to IgA synthesis. These cells enter the circulation via lymphatics and finally home to several remote secretory tissues. The regulatory cells and factors that govern the mucosal immune response are beginning to be elucidated. Several bacterial and viral antigens have been used to evoke SIgA antibodies experimentally in humans, but only a few oral vaccines have been developed for clinical application. Considerable scope exists for the identification of appropriate immunogens and their formulation in delivery vehicles with suitable adjuvants to induce protective antibodies against a variety of pathogens that invade through mucosal surfaces. Several mucosal pathogens, however, secrete proteases that specifically cleave human IgA1. The full significance of this evasion mechanism and the ways of circumventing it must be addressed to maximize the effectiveness of mucosal immunity.\r"

Killing and digestion of microorganisms take place within phagolysosomes. Antimicrobial activities in phagolysosomes are divided into two classes. Oxygen (O2)-dependent mechanisms are expressed when PMNs undergo the \"respiratory burst.\" An NADPH oxidase in the phagolysosome membrane is activated and reduces O2 to superoxide (O2-). O2 reduction is the first step in a series of reactions that produce toxic oxidants. For example, .O2- dismutases to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), and the azurophil granule enzyme myeloperoxidase catalyzes the oxidation of Cl- by H2O2 to yield hypochlorous acid (HOCl). The reaction of HOCl with ammonia and amines modulates the toxicity of this oxidant. O2-independent antimicrobial mechanisms include the activities of lysosomal proteases, other hydrolytic enzymes, and proteins and peptides that bind to microorganisms and disrupt essential processes or structural components. For example, the bactericidal/permeability-increasing protein, cathepsin G, and the defensins are released into phagolysosomes from the azurophil granules. Proposed mechanisms of action of neutrophil antimicrobial agents, their range of microbial targets, and their possible interactions within phagolysosomes are discussed.\r"

The importance of cell-mediated immunity against HCMV is exemplified by the occurrence of severe and prolonged HCMV infections in individuals with congenital, iatrogenic, or acquired deficiencies of this arm of host immunity. In contrast, infection in most individuals with primary B cell disorders usually is not severe. The nature of different aspects of cell-mediated immunity, including cytotoxic T cell (CTL) responses and levels of natural killer cell (NKC) and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) during infection, has been characterized in detail in susceptible populations. To a high degree, the presence or absence of CMV-specific CTL responses correlates inversely with the severity of infection, as do levels of NKC and ADCC activity. Clinical correlates of these immune responses will be discussed. In addition, recent observations implicating HCMV as an immunosuppressive virus will be presented.\r"

A positive urine, blood, or genital culture confirms CMV infection but does not prove that CMV is causing a specific clinical syndrome, since excretion of virus may continue for months to years following primary infection and may reoccur when a patient is immunocompromised. Seroconversion from negative to positive for specific IgG antibody is usually diagnostic of primary infection but does not provide a rapid diagnosis. CMV-specific IgM antibody is associated with primary CMV infection in nonimmunocompromised patients but may be present in immunocompromised (e.g., AIDS) patients who are infected by but do not have disease due to CMV. Conversely, tests for IgM may be negative in immunocompromised patients or neonates who are actively infected and may be falsely positive in infants who are not congenitally infected. Lastly, detection of CMV antigen in tissue by monoclonal antibodies or of CMV nucleic acids by genetic probes helps confirm tissue infection. Demonstration of CMV inclusions by cytologic or histologic examination is diagnostic of infection, but this method is not sensitive.\r"

All of these drugs showed potency against herpes simplex virus (HSV) and cytomegalovirus (CMV) in vitro but had a narrow therapeutic margin. Although ribavirin, a nucleoside analogue synthesized in 1972, was much less toxic than earlier drugs, it proved ineffective against CMV. Phosphonoformic acid (PFA), a pyrophosphate analogue, has recently shown encouraging results for CMV infections in bone marrow and renal transplant recipients. Several interferons, alone or in combination with other antiviral agents, have proved clinically ineffective against CMV infections. Antiviral nucleoside analogues synthesized in the late 1970s generated much hope and enthusiasm, and acyclovir (9-[(2-hydroxyethoxy)methyl]guanine; ACV) has emerged as a safe and efficacious anti-HSV agent and has shown some promise in the treatment of CMV infection in transplant recipients. The most recent anti-CMV agent, ganciclovir (9-[(1,3-dihydroxy-2-propoxy)methyl]guanine; DHPG), is an analogue of 2'-deoxyguanosine. It was reported independently in 1982 by four laboratories. DHPG is a potent agent against all five human herpesviruses. Its toxicity, unfortunately, limits its clinical use at present to life- and sight-threatening CMV infections.\r"

The primary mechanism of ganciclovir action against CMV is inhibition of the replication of viral DNA by ganciclovir-5'-triphosphate (ganciclovir-TP). This inhibition includes a selective and potent inhibition of the viral DNA polymerase. Ganciclovir is metabolized to the triphosphate form by primarily three cellular enzymes: (1) a deoxyguanosine kinase induced by CMV-infected cells; (2) guanylate kinase; and (3) phosphoglycerate kinase. Other nucleotide-metabolizing enzymes may be involved as well. The selective antiviral response associated with ganciclovir treatment is achieved because of the much weaker inhibition of cellular DNA polymerases by ganciclovir-TP. Activity and selectivity are also amplified by the accumulation of ganciclovir-TP in CMV-infected cells.\r"

Untreated patients generally experience progressive involvement of the retina, which may result in blindness. Attempts to treat this condition with vidarabine and interferon-alpha have been uniformly unsuccessful. Therapy with ganciclovir (9[(1,3-dihydroxy-2-propoxy)methyl]guanine) (7.5-15 mg/[kg./d] given intravenously in two or three divided doses) has been shown to halt progression of retinitis and may result in limited healing in some cases; viremia and shedding of virus from other sites (such as the urine) are halted or reduced. However, reactivation of infection and retinitis usually occurs when ganciclovir therapy is discontinued. For that reason, most patients have received continued therapy with the drug, most commonly at a dosage of 5-6 mg/(kg.d) administered as a single intravenous infusion 5-7 days per week. Both retrospective and prospective, randomized trials have shown that maintenance therapy delays (but does not prevent) reactivation of infection. Much more limited studies with foscarnet (trisodium phosphonoformate) suggest that this drug will also be useful for treatment of CMV retinitis in AIDS patients. Further research is needed, however, since existing agents have a low therapeutic ratio and cannot be given orally to patients requiring long-term maintenance therapy.\r"

Two additional patients responded to ganciclovir therapy; one survived for 60 days before relapsing with fatal CMV pneumonia, and the other survived 79 days before dying with disseminated aspergillosis. No CMV disease was found in this latter patient at autopsy. The improved survival of patients in this trial may be due to a small number of patients (23%) who developed significant neutropenia during ganciclovir therapy, to the concurrent use of CMV immune globulin in three of the survivors, or to other variables affecting a positive outcome. Data on the use of CMV DNA-DNA hybridization assays to detect CMV DNA directly in patients' blood suggest that this method may be useful in following the clearance of CMV viremia in patients receiving ganciclovir. The results of treatment of CMV pneumonia in bone marrow transplant recipients are compared with those of previous studies, of CMV pneumonia in renal transplant recipients, and of CMV pneumonia in patients with AIDS. Suggestions for further, more definitive, studies of CMV pneumonia are presented.\r"

  ".W": "The efficacy and safety of ganciclovir were evaluated for the treatment of 39 life-threatening or sight-threatening cytomegalovirus (CMV) infections in recipients of bone marrow transplants (15 patients), recipients of liver or renal transplants (8 patients), patients with AIDS (11 patients), and one patient each with lymphoma or systemic lupus erythematosus. Twenty-eight (72%) of 39 CMV infections improved during ganciclovir therapy, which was associated with elimination of CMV from cultures. Improvement occurred more frequently in patients with viremia, fever, and wasting (8 of 8), hepatitis (3 of 4), retinitis (5 of 5), or colitis (1 of 1), than in patients with pneumonia (11 of 21). Only two of nine marrow transplant recipients with CMV pneumonia survived, as compared with nine of 12 other immunosuppressed patients with pneumonia. However, all six marrow transplant recipients who were treated for CMV viremia, fever, and wasting without pneumonia survived. Neutropenia was the only adverse reaction associated with ganciclovir therapy and was more frequent in patients with AIDS (6 [55%] of 11) than in transplant recipients (5 [20%] of 25). These results suggest that ganciclovir is of clinical benefit for immunosuppressed patients with serious CMV infections. For bone marrow transplant recipients, ganciclovir may be more effective when used prophylactically or earlier in the course of CMV infection before the development of pneumonia.\r"

Twelve patients had pneumonia (one with concomitant retinitis), three patients had retinitis, and two patients had generalized disease. Four (36%) of 11 patients with pneumonia due to CMV were cured, including three (30%) of 10 ventilator-dependent patients. The clinical condition of all four patients with retinitis improved when ganciclovir was administered, although three patients relapsed after discontinuation of therapy. Two of these three responded to a repeat course of therapy. Two patients with generalized disease died. A virologic response, with clearing of CMV, was noted in eight of the 17 patients (including seven of 10 patients with a favorable clinical response). Adverse effects of therapy were common and included leukopenia (six patients), thrombocytopenia (four patients), and CNS disturbances (four patients). Ganciclovir holds promise as therapy for life-threatening CMV infection in patients with renal transplants, including those patients with CMV pneumonia who are ventilator-dependent.\r"

Several guidance cues may operate in a coordinated way to generate the distinct axonal trajectories of individual neurons.\r"

It is therefore a central goal of neuroscience to understand the molecular basis for neuronal shape. Neuronal pathfinding during development is one major determinant of neuronal shape: growing nerve axons and dendrites must navigate, branch, and locate targets in response to extracellular cue molecules within the embryo. The leading tips of growing nerve processes, structures known as growth cones, contain especially high concentrations of the ubiquitous mechanochemical protein actin. Force generation involving this cytoskeletal molecule appears to be essential to the ability of growing nerve fibers to respond structurally to extracellular cues. New results from electronically enhanced light microscopy of living growth cones are helping to show how actin-based forces guide neurite growth and synapse formation.\r"

LTP is a persistent increase in synaptic efficacy that can be quickly induced. The biophysical process that controls one type of LTP is formally similar to a synaptic memory mechanism postulated decades ago by the psychologist Donald Hebb. A key aspect of the modification process involves the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor-ionophore complex. This ionophore allows calcium influx only if the endogenous ligand glutamate binds to the NMDA receptor and if the voltage across the associated channel is also sufficiently depolarized to relieve a magnesium block. According to one popular hypothesis, the resulting increase in the intracellular calcium concentration activates protein kinases that enhance the postsynaptic conductance. Further biophysical and molecular understanding of the modification process should facilitate detailed explorations of the mnemonic functions of LTP.\r"

The function of the VOR is to stabilize retinal images by generating smooth eye movements that are equal and opposite to each head movement. Learning occurs whenever image motion occurs persistently during head turns; as a result image stability is gradually restored. A hypothesis is proposed in which the output from the cerebellar cortex of the flocculus guides learning; the locus of learning is in the brain stem, in VOR pathways that are under inhibitory control from the flocculus. Other, parallel VOR pathways do not receive inputs from the flocculus and are not subject to learning. Similarities among the VOR and other motor systems suggest some organizing principles that may apply in many forms of motor learning.\r"

In order to test this, the exon-intron boundaries of the first ten exons of the DMD gene were determined, and 29 patients were analyzed. In a number of BMD patients (mild and severe BMD), the reading frame of messenger RNA was not maintained.

Previous genetic analysis had shown that only one of these mutants exhibited dramatic and pleiotropic phenotypes. This mutant was also the only one that contained disrupted chromatin, suggesting that the original phenotypes were attributable to alterations in chromosome structure. The chromatin disruption in the mutant, however, did not extend over the entire genome, but rather was localized to specific regions. Thus, while the arrangement of nucleosomes over the HIS4 and GAL1 genes, the telomeres, and the long terminal repeats (delta sequences) of Ty retrotransposons appeared essentially normal, nucleosomes over the CYH2 and UBI4 genes and the centromere of chromosome III were dramatically disrupted. The observation that the mutant exhibited localized chromatin disruptions implies that the assembly or maintenance of nucleosomes differs over different parts of the yeast genome.\r"
