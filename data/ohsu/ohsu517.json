  ".W": "The incidence of leukaemia and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in young people (aged under 25) living in a predefined area around the nuclear power station at Hinkley Point, Somerset, was examined for the period 1959-86 by using cancer registry data. During the period since Hinley Point began operations--that is, 1964-86--there were 19 cases in the area compared with 10.4 expected from national rates, giving a standardised registration ratio of 1.82 (95% confidence interval 1.10 to 2.85). The incidence in the rest of Somerset was also high, however (standardised registration ratio 1.18; 95% confidence interval 0.98 to 1.41), and the high rate around Hinkley Point may simply have been reflecting the high local incidence (ratio of the two standardised registration ratio's 1.54; 95% confidence interval 0.90 to 2.52). Analysis of predetermined five year periods showed that the excess cases in the Hinkley Point area were concentrated in the 10 years 1964-73 after commissioning of the station, at a time when rates in the rest of Somerset were close to the national average. In particular the nine cases occurring in the five years 1969-73 were about four times the number expected from national rates (standardised registration ratio 3.96; 95% confidence interval 1.81 to 7.52). Rates in the Hinkley Point area after 1973 were fairly low, especially as compared with the rest of Somerset. In the five years 1959-63 (that is, before Hinkley Point was commissioned) rates throughout Somerset (including the Hinkley Point area) were higher than the national rate. These findings should be interpreted with caution, and further studies are required to test the plausibility of theories relating to radiation and viruses.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE--To define an outbreak of bacteraemia due to coagulase negative staphylococci highly resistant to ciprofloxacin in a leukaemia unit, investigate the source and mode of spread of the outbreak strain, and assess control measures. DESIGN--The outbreak strain was characterised by five different typing methods. Surveillance of patients, staff, and environment was carried out during the outbreak and five months after control measures were introduced. SETTING--A unit with 10 beds for adults with leukaemia and patients receiving bone marrow transplants. The outbreak occurred during a trial of ciprofloxacin for empirical treatment of neutropenic fevers. INTERVENTIONS--Ciprofloxacin was withdrawn from use in the unit and daily bathing with chlorhexidine gluconate solution started. Main outcome measure--The absence of bacteraemia due to the outbreak strain for five months after control measures. RESULTS--During the study 49 patients developed 21 episodes of bacteraemia due to the outbreak strain, which was ciprofloxacin resistant (minimum inhibitory concentration greater than or equal to 128 mg/l), susceptible to phage 155 A9C, and SII biotype and had characteristic immunoblot and DNA fingerprint features. There was a high amount of colonisation of patients but not staff with this strain, which was also wide spread in the environment. The control measures led to rapid resolution of the outbreak and disappearance of the strain from the unit. CONCLUSIONS--In areas where coagulase negative staphylococcal infections are common doctors must be aware of the possibility of cross infection with single strain, and the availability of more discriminatory methods of typing will facilitate the identification and control of such episodes.\r"

Admissions were reduced most for the diagnoses of affective psychosis and neurotic and personality disorders. The average duration of admission fell by 3.6% a year, and use of inpatient beds fell by 37.5%. Integrating hospital and community psychiatric services by creating sectors is a viable and economically feasible way of improving psychiatric services.\r"

This has led to a call to evaluate the appropriateness and effectiveness of referrals. A collaborative audit of referrals to outpatient clinics was conducted by 127 general practitioners in 33 practices in the Oxford region. Records were kept of 18,754 referrals, which included data on diagnoses and reasons for referral. Overall, 6553 (35.4%) of the referrals were for particular treatments or operations and a further 6475 (34.9%) were for specific investigation or diagnosis. Advice on management was the main reason for referral in 2656 (14.3%) cases, and in 1719 (9.3%) cases the general practitioners wanted the consultants to take over managing their patients. Reassurance of either the general practitioner or the patient was recorded as the main reason in only 762 (4.1%) referrals. There seems to be scope for rationalising the referral process. A programme with three stages for evaluating referrals to outpatient clinics is recommended.\r"

Of the 17,601 referrals from practices in Oxford Regional Health Authority, 13,857 (78.7%) were made to NHS outpatient clinics within practices' own districts, 1524 (8.7%) to clinics in other districts in the same region, 420 (2.4%) to NHS clinics in other regions, and 1800 (10.2%) to the private sector; but these proportions varied considerably among the practices. The mean number of different NHS hospitals or clinics that each practice referred patients to was 15.8 (range 4-42).\r"

A total of 109 cases with histologically-proven NPC and cranial nerve involvement treated during 1979-1985 were reviewed and analysed. Definitive radiotherapy (RT) was given to patients with a high upper margin of the RT field at 2.5 cm above the base of the skull to a total dose of 70.2 Gy/39 fractions/8 weeks, with two applications of intranasopharyngeal brachytherapy. There were 37 cases (34%) in Group I (upward invasion only) and 72 cases (66%) in Group II (bidirectional invasion). Abducens, trigeminal, oculomotor and facial were the commonly involved nerves. Headache was the major symptom at diagnosis and was present in 82.6% of the patients, significantly higher than in general NPC cases (p less than 0.005). Fifty per cent (31/62) achieved complete response to definitive RT, but it did not correlate well with survival rate. The residual neurological deficit of each CN ranged from 31 to 57%. The actuarial 5-year survival rates of Groups I and II were similar in spite of neck lymph node metastasis in Group II (33% (I) compared with 24% (II); p greater than 0.05). Cases with single CN deficit did not show better results than those with multiple CN involvements. Five-year survivors were seen only in those who received a complete course of definitive RT.\r"

Of the 7 patients treated with 2 induction courses, 6 showed a complete response during a follow-up period of 24 to 42 months. Although 1 patient initially responded completely, he developed invasive transitional cell carcinoma (TCC) Grade IV 30 months later. Among the 3 patients who underwent 3 induction courses, 2 had a complete response at 42 and 60 months of follow-up and 1 developed TCC Grade IV with muscle invasion 18 months later. Two of the 3 patients treated with 4 induction courses are free of disease at 48 and 57 months; the third developed low grade, low stage TCC. This experience suggests that the majority of patients with CIS who fail initial treatment usually respond to further treatment with the same or a different drug. The question as to whether a second course of intravesical therapy, subsequent to failure of the first course, should be given before cystectomy requires further investigation.\r"

  ".W": "Three hundred and thirty-five patients with high-output enterocutaneous fistulae arising from the small intestine are reported. Median fistula output was 1350 ml/24 h. Eighty-two per cent of patients were referred from other institutions. The fistula opening was associated with evisceration in 165 cases (49 per cent). One or more severity factors were present in 75.5 per cent of the patients. Patients were divided into three groups according to their initial therapy: 21 patients (6 per cent) referred in a moribund state were not operated on (non-intervention); 80 patients (24 per cent) were operated on as an emergency, and the fistula was either exteriorized or defunctioned; 234 patients (70 per cent) were initially managed conservatively. Appropriate local care and nutrition were provided in all cases. Enteral nutrition was the exclusive nutritional support in 285 patients (85 per cent). In 92 cases with proximal fistulae, methods limiting the fistula output or allowing reinfusion of chyme were required. The overall mortality rate was 34 per cent: 100 per cent in the non-intervention group, 55 per cent after emergency surgery, and 19 per cent after conservative treatment. In the latter group, spontaneous closure was obtained in 88 patients (38 per cent). Overall mortality rate was reduced to 19 per cent in patients treated since 1980. Enteral nutrition with appropriate local care may be used in the majority of high-output enterocutaneous fistulae, with an acceptable rate of spontaneous closure. Conservative management is the treatment of choice in the initial period. Emergency surgery should be restricted to the treatment of haemorrhage or intra-abdominal abscesses associated with uncontrolled systemic sepsis.\r"

Their characterization was performed using serial ultrastructural, enzymatic, and immunohistochemical methods on primary tumors and after xenografts. These were subclassified into epithelial (one), neuroendocrine (three), and multidifferenciated (eight) types. The phenotypic characters (cytokeratins, neurofilaments, neurone-specific enolase) and the proliferative rate (Ki 67 labelling) of original tumor were maintained until the last passage studied. Although further acquisition of subsets of cytokeratin or neurofilaments was observed in some cases, the authors could not detect any morphologic and/or biological spontaneous change comparable to those described in in vitro cell lines. In addition, ANE are not quite identical to variant subclasses described in vitro. The authors conclude that the stability of heterotransplanted SCLC is an advantage in further biological studies.\r"

  ".W": "The beta-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol stimulates immunoreactive atrial natriuretic peptide (IR-ANP) secretion by superfused rat atria in vitro. beta-Adrenergic agonists alter the cellular handling of calcium, which culminates in a rise in the systolic calcium concentration. This is achieved by increasing calcium influx through voltage-dependent calcium channels and by increasing the storage pool of calcium in the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR). We therefore asked the question whether isoproterenol-stimulated IR-ANP secretion was dependent on the protein kinase A-induced rise in systolic calcium or was due to a direct effect of protein kinase A activation. Isolated rat left atria paced at 3 Hz were superfused in vitro. IR-ANP secretion was determined by radioimmunoassay of timed collections of the superfusate. Superfusion with 0.1 microM isoproterenol or 0.5 mM dibutyryl cyclic AMP increased IR-ANP secretion twofold. Stimulated IR-ANP secretion was lowered to near baseline by lowering the buffer calcium concentration from 1.8 to 0.2 mM or by adding to the superfusate 10 microM nitrendipine (a calcium-channel blocker) or 1 microM ryanodine (an inhibitor of SR calcium release). Superfusion of nonbeating, electrically quiescent left atria with 0.1 microM isoproterenol failed to stimulate IR-ANP secretion. We conclude: 1) Isoproterenol-stimulated IR-ANP secretion is dependent on calcium influx through voltage-dependent calcium channels and on the release of calcium from the SR. 2) Enhanced calcium influx alone is not adequate to maintain isoproterenol-stimulated IR-ANP secretion. 3) The SR appears to be the primary source of calcium for isoproterenol-stimulated IR-ANP secretion.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Relative to baseline values in rats with remnant kidneys, phosphoramidon led to elevations of plasma ANP levels and concomitant increases in urinary sodium excretion, fractional excretion of sodium, glomerular filtration rate, filtration fraction, and urinary cyclic GMP excretion. Similar changes in renal function and urinary cyclic GMP excretion were obtained with thiorphan, another endopeptidase 24.11 inhibitor. These enhanced ANP levels and renal actions were not observed with phosphoramidon in normal rats. These results show that plasma ANP levels can be modulated in rats with reduced renal mass by inhibition of endopeptidase 24.11.\r"

  ".W": "Metabolites of arachidonic acid (eicosanoids) may have an important role in the healing process after myocardial infarction. We examined the ability of cardiac fibroblasts from normal and from healing infarcted ventricle to metabolize arachidonate. We induced myocardial infarction in dogs and then allowed them to recover for 1 week, at which time they were killed, and the heart was removed. Fibroblasts were harvested from normal and from the healing, infarcted areas of the left ventricle. The cells from each source were morphologically indistinguishable. There were 347 +/- 102-fold more fibroblasts cultured from the infarcted area than from the normal area. Interestingly, the infarct-derived cells had a slower doubling time (37.4 +/- 3.7 hours) than the normal cells (22.0 +/- 3.6 hours). The uptake of exogenous arachidonate and its distribution in complex lipids was the same in the cells from each area. When stimulated with the calcium ionophore, free exogenous arachidonate, bradykinin, or histamine the cells produced prostaglandin E2 and prostaglandin I2. In each case the infarct-derived cells produced from twofold to fivefold more prostaglandin than the normal cells. We also found that prostaglandin synthesis was highly dependent on the growth state of the cells with a marked decrease a confluence. Finally, in experiments designed to mimic the early state of infarction, we confirmed that isolated cardiac myocytes release arachidonate and showed that normal fibroblasts can incorporate it. The production of eicosanoids by cardiac fibroblasts may be substantial during the healing of myocardial infarction due to their dramatic proliferation and the increased prostaglandin production per cell.\r"

  ".W": "The purposes of the present study were to examine the natural course of the impairment of endothelium-dependent relaxations during a regeneration and tissue repair process after balloon endothelium removal and to elucidate the cellular mechanism(s) underlying it. Twenty-three male Yorkshire pigs underwent balloon endothelium removal along the proximal portion of either the left anterior descending or circumflex coronary artery and were then maintained on a regular chow for 4, 8, 16, or 24 weeks. Endothelium-dependent responses were examined in vitro in rings taken from the control and previously denuded arteries studied in parallel. Morphometric analysis revealed that intimal thickening developed only at the previously denuded area. In the previously denuded arteries with regenerated endothelium, the endothelium-dependent relaxations to UK 14304 (a selective alpha 2-adrenergic agonist), serotonin, and aggregating platelets were impaired 4 weeks after endothelium removal and remained so throughout the study. The endothelium-dependent relaxations to thrombin and adenosine diphosphate became depressed 8 weeks after endothelium removal and those to bradykinin became depressed 16 weeks after endothelium removal, while those to the calcium ionophore A23187 were maintained throughout the study. Endothelium-dependent relaxations to all vasoactive agents were unaltered in the control arteries. In the control arteries, pertussis toxin, an inhibitor of certain G proteins, markedly inhibited the endothelium-dependent relaxations to UK 14304 and serotonin and partially inhibited those to thrombin and aggregating platelets. The responses inhibited by the toxin in control arteries were significantly reduced in the reduced in the previously denuded arteries with regenerated endothelium. The inhibitory effect of pertussis toxin was markedly reduced in those arteries with regenerated endothelium. In quiescent rings, the presence of normal endothelium inhibited the contractions caused by serotonin and aggregating platelets; this endothelium-dependent depression was markedly impaired in the previously denuded arteries throughout the study. Direct relaxation of the coronary smooth muscle to nitric oxide or sodium nitroprusside or direct contraction to KCl or serotonin were comparable between the control and previously denuded arteries. These experiments indicate that endothelium-dependent relaxations progressively worsen after regeneration of the endothelium and that the dysfunction of a pertussis toxin-sensitive G protein partly account for the endothelial dysfunction in the chronic regenerated state.\r"

Since platelet aggregates formed in vivo are involved in the initiation of many clinically important occlusive vascular syndromes, we tested the hypothesis that these endothelial products act synergistically to disperse platelet aggregates. Our data reveal that tissue-type plasminogen activator, prostaglandin E1, and nitroglycerin (an organic nitrate activator of guanylate cyclase analogous to endothelium-derived relaxing factor) act synergistically to disaggregate platelets and do so in part by modulation of platelet cyclic nucleotides. These data suggest a potential mechanism by which the endothelium protects against the formation of platelet aggregates in vivo and offer a potential strategy for improving the efficacy of thrombolytic therapy.\r"

  ".W": "Two peptides consisting of amino acids 1-30 and 31-67 of the N-terminus of the prohormone of atrial natriuretic factor (pro-ANF) that have vasodilatory and natriuretic properties were investigated to determine if they circulate in humans. Specific and sensitive radioimmunoassays were developed to amino acids 1-30, 31-67, and 99-126 of pro-ANF. Evaluation of human plasma that had been subjected to reverse-phase high-pressure liquid chromatography suggested that pro-ANFs 1-30 and 31-67 as well as ANF were distinct peaks in human plasma corresponding exactly to pure synthetic peaks of these peptides on high-pressure liquid chromatography. Molecular weight determination of the endogenous immunoreactive peptides measured in plasma by G-50 Sephadex gel permeation chromatography revealed that the pro-ANF 1-30 radioimmunoassay recognized a peptide of 10,000 MW, which is consistent with it measuring the whole N-terminus of pro-ANF (amino acids 1-98) but without ANF (C-terminus) attached to it. The pro-ANF 31-67 radioimmunoassay recognized mainly (more than 95%) a peptide of 3,900-4,000 MW, which corresponds closely with its actual molecular weight of 3,878. Our ANF radioimmunoassay recognizes a peptide in plasma of 3,000 MW with the known molecular weight of ANF being 3,081. The mean circulating concentrations of immunoreactive pro-ANF 1-98, pro-ANF 31-67, and ANF in 54 control subjects were 531 +/- 25, 371 +/- 18, and 22 +/- 1 fmol/ml (+/- SEM), respectively. Thirty patients with varying severity of congestive heart failure were also studied. The N-terminus, C-terminus, and pro-ANF 31-67 increased: twofold for New York Heart Association functional Class II, threefold to ninefold for Class III, and 10- to 20-fold for Class IV patients with congestive heart failure. Thus, the N-terminus and a 4,000-MW peptide from the midportion of the N-terminus of pro-ANF as well as ANF circulate normally and increased proportionately to the increasing severity of congestive heart failure. However, because the pro-ANF 31-67 radioimmunoassay was the only assay that discriminated between patients with Class I congestive heart failure and control subjects, this assay may be the most useful to accurately classify the severity of congestive heart failure.\r"

  ".W": "Studies in animals have suggested that increases in blood flow result in dilation of large arteries by an endothelium-dependent mechanism. Atherosclerosis can impair endothelium-dependent vasodilation to vasoactive agents. The purpose of this study was to determine whether or not large coronary arteries in humans exhibit dilation with increases in blood flow and to test the hypothesis that this response is impaired in the presence of atherosclerosis. Graded concentrations of adenosine were infused into the distal left anterior descending (LAD) coronary artery to test the dilator response of the proximal LAD to increases in blood flow. The proximal LAD was thereby exposed to changes in blood flow, but not directly to adenosine. Ten patients with angiographically smooth proximal LAD segments (group 1) and seven patients with irregularities in the proximal LAD consistent with mild atherosclerosis (group 2) were studied. Infusions of adenosine throughout the range of 0.022 to 2.2 mg/min into the LAD produced a dose-dependent increase in estimated coronary blood flow and a mean increase of 305 +/- 27% at 2.2 mg/min adenosine. At 2.2 mg/min adenosine, a striking difference (p less than 0.001) occurred between the significant flow-mediated dilation of the proximal LAD observed in group 1 (+13.2 +/- 1.3% from 2.63 +/- 0.16 mm, p less than 0.001), and the lack of dilation in group 2 (+1.8 +/- 1.5% from 3.20 +/- 0.17 mm, p = NS), despite a greater increase in coronary blood flow in group 2 (+387 +/- 29%) than in group 1 (+230 +/- 36%).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Thirteen patients (25%) suffered relatively minor but spontaneous bleeding that did not correlate with age, hypertension, smoking, partial thromboplastin time, platelet count, ADP-induced platelet aggregation, steady-state rt-PA level, or extent of fibrinogen degradation. In multivariate analysis, only the 90-minute bleeding time correlated with spontaneous bleeding (p = 0.01). Prolongation of the 90-minute bleeding time to greater than or equal to 9 minutes, which occurred in 21 patients, correlated with spontaneous bleeding with a sensitivity of 69% (95% confidence interval, 39-90%) and a specificity of 69% (95% confidence interval, 52-83%). Retrospective analysis revealed that in 14 patients taking aspirin, the bleeding time at 90 minutes was significantly more prolonged (p less than 0.05) and spontaneous bleeding significantly more frequent (p less than 0.01) than in patients not taking aspirin.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "It remains unclear whether the levels of atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) observed in chronic CHF are appropriate for the magnitude of elevations in atrial pressures. Specifically, it is not known whether acute increases in atrial pressure in CHF can result in further significant increases in circulating ANF. The present study was designed to test the hypothesis that in chronic CHF there is an attenuated relation between circulating ANF and atrial pressure such that the heart is unable to respond to further increases in atrial pressure with appropriate increases in ANF. Cardiovascular hemodynamics and plasma levels of ANF were measured at baseline and after rapid right ventricular pacing (RRVP) to produce acute (n = 10, 25 minutes RRVP) and chronic (n = 7, 14-16 days RRVP) CHF. Acute saline volume expansion was then performed in each group to determine the response of circulating ANF to acute increases in atrial pressure in both acute and chronic CHF. In chronic CHF, right atrial pressure was much higher than in acute CHF (8.5 +/- 0.9 vs. 3.4 +/- 1.3 mm Hg, p less than 0.05); however, circulating ANF was not greater in chronic as compared with acute CHF (385 +/- 73 vs. 500 +/- 89 pg/ml), which is consistent with an attenuated release of ANF in chronic CHF. In response to volume expansion, right atrial pressure increased in both acute (3.4 +/- 1.3 to 12.1 +/- 7 mm Hg) and chronic (8.5 +/- .9 to 13.3 +/- 1.0 mm Hg) CHF.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Previous studies from our institution demonstrated significant hypercarbic acidosis in the mixed venous (pulmonary artery) blood in animals and human patients during cardiac arrest and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). In the present study, the acid-base state of the myocardium during cardiac arrest was investigated. Cardiac arrest was electrically induced in 11 pentobarbital-anesthetized and mechanically ventilated domestic pigs. Precordial compression was begun 3 minutes after onset of ventricular fibrillation and continued for 8 minutes. During CPR, there was rapid onset of profound myocardial acidosis with an increase in intramyocardial [H+] from 54 +/- 5 to 146 +/- 20 nmol/l (7.27 +/- 0.04 to 6.88 +/- 0.20 pH units). Great cardiac vein PCO2 increased from 57 +/- 2 to 158 +/- 12 mm Hg. Profound hypercarbic acidosis in great cardiac vein blood was associated with myocardial lactate production to levels of 8.1 +/- 0.7 mmol/l. Only moderate decreases in cardiac vein bicarbonate concentrations from 31 +/- 1 to 23 +/- 1 mmol/l were observed. These acid-base changes were almost completely reversed over an interval of 60 minutes after the animals were successfully resuscitated by DC countershock. The PCO2 in cardiac vein blood was significantly greater than that of mixed venous blood, demonstrating disproportionate myocardial production of CO2 during CPR. Accordingly, it is CO2 production during ischemia that is implicated as the predominant mechanism accounting for myocardial [H+] increases during cardiac arrest. Important clinical implications for buffer therapy during CPR and, in particular, treatment with bicarbonate emerge from these observations.\r"

Variations of plasma ANF and cGMP were correlated significantly (p less than 0.05) with those of total blood volume. At the early phase of the disease, plasma ANF was also correlated with the excreted fraction of filtered sodium (FENa) (r = 0.95). Moreover, plasma ANF and FENa peaked concomitantly at the onset of the diuretic phase in the five patients who were not treated by diuretics or dialysis and were studied sequentially during the course of the disease. It is suggested that enhanced plasma ANF levels might reflect one of the mechanisms of adaptation controlling body fluid balance in acute renal failure.\r"

Torque versus rotation curves were recorded as each foot was rotated externally to failure. The mean failure torque was 45.3 Nm, the mean rotation to failure was 41.4 degrees, and the mean energy absorbed to failure was 10.6 Nm. Twelve specimens failed by fracture of the fibula, five by failure of lateral ligaments with no fibular fracture, one by a subtalar dislocation, and one by fracture of the calcaneous through a fixation screw hole. There were no statistically significant differences in torque or energy to failure between those specimens that failed by fibular fracture and those with ligamentous failure alone. Rotation to failure was 6 degrees greater in the ligamentous failure group. Ankles with less initial rotatory laxity tended to fail at higher torque levels. The mean ankle fracture torque measured in this study is similar to previously reported mean ligamentous failure torque for the knee flexed to 20 degrees and rotated externally to failure. In a prior in vivo study, approximately 10 Nm of external foot torque and 20 degrees of foot rotation could be tolerated prior to the initiation of pain. The present study indicates that these in vivo pain threshold levels represent approximately 50% of the rotation to failure and 25% of the torque to failure.\r"

Oral infection with small numbers of N. dubius larvae caused villus height, crypt depth and enterocyte migration rate to increase in the mouse jejunum. None of these effects occurred in ileal tissue. 3. Lactase activity also increased in jejunal, but not ileal, tissue of infected mice. This increase was associated with a doubling of the rate at which activity appeared in the brush-border membrane of enterocytes during migration over the basal regions of jejunal villi. Alkaline phosphatase activity in jejunal tissue remained unchanged in infected mice. 4. Attention is drawn to the fact that this is the first occasion when crypt cell hyperplasia has been found to be positively correlated with an increase in lactase activity and a decrease in cytotoxic/suppressor T-cells. Further work is needed to establish the primary cause of these effects.\r"

Diabetic patients were divided prospectively into poor (PGC, n = 14) or moderate (MGC, n = 13) glycaemic control depending on their concurrent plasma glycohaemoglobin (HbA1) levels (greater than 9% or less than 9%, respectively).

Despite end-tidal CO2 monitoring, five children inadvertently developed PaCO2 greater than 50 torr during the study. Increasing and decreasing PaCO2 in these children resulted in significant parallel changes in cardiac index (CI), oxygen delivery, physiologic shunt, mean pulmonary pressure, and right ventricular stroke work index, and inverse changes in systemic vascular resistance index (p less than .01). No significant hemodynamic changes were observed with alterations in PaCO2 in children whose PaCO2 remained less than 50 torr. These findings are partly related to significantly larger reductions in PaCO2 which occurred in the hypercarbic children compared to the others (25 vs. 12 torr; p less than .001). Heart rate, mean arterial BP, and venous filling pressures did not change significantly in either group. We conclude that mean alterations in PaCO2 less than or equal to 12 torr (range 28 to 50) have no significant effect on CI in children after open heart surgery. However, moderate hypercarbia and its correction to a mean PaCO2 of 30 torr are associated with significant effects on central hemodynamics. Moreover, no significant changes in the commonly monitored physiologic variables were observed despite large variations in PaCO2.\r"

A negative correlation between cardiac vein [K+] and myocardial [H+] was observed (r = .88), supporting the concept that H+ extrusion is associated with K+ uptake of myocardial cells. Normal conditions were re-established within 60 min after restoration of spontaneous circulation. The myocardial uptake of K+ during CPR contrasted with increased K+ efflux from other tissues such that there were net increases in the K+ content of arterial and mixed venous blood.

Increasing ionized Ca from 4.1 +/- 0.06 to 4.9 +/- 0.20 and 8.5 +/- 0.52 mg/dl progressively increased endotoxin lethality from 20% to 37% and 80%, respectively. This occurred despite slight improvements in MAP in hypercalcemic rats. Conversely, hypocalcemia (3.6 +/- 0.08 mg/dl) lowered endotoxin-induced mortality to 0 without significant effects on MAP. Ca and EGTA infusions alone were not associated with any mortality. Although Ca administration may improve MAP, it significantly increases mortality associated with endotoxic shock in rats. Based on these observations, we advise caution when using Ca in patients with sepsis.\r"

A greater percentage of prepyloric ulcers healed on enprostil than placebo, but the difference was not significant. Mean antacid use in both groups was identical, averaging only two or less tablets per day in each group throughout the study. Daytime pain was relieved more quickly in the enprostil group, while median time to relief of nighttime pain was essentially identical in both groups. The most common side effect in the enprostil treatment group, diarrhea, was mostly mild to moderate in intensity and was generally self-limiting, requiring no specific therapy; no patient withdrew because of this complaint. Other symptoms and laboratory profiles were similar in the two groups. These results indicate that enprostil 35 micrograms taken twice daily for four weeks is effective and safe for the treatment of prepyloric, pyloric channel, and duodenal ulcers.\r"

  ".W": "To determine whether serum and mucosal DAO activity reflects quantitative changes in the small bowel mucosal mass, we have chosen an experimental model of mucosal hyperplasia which is known to occur in the rat after enterectomy. A 50% proximal enterectomy or a single transection was performed in 20 growing rats weighing 145-160 g. Ten days following surgery, we determined mucosal mass parameters (weight, protein, and DNA content), sucrase activity, and DAO activity in the duodenum (segment A), proximal ileum (segment B), and distal ileum (segment C) of the remaining small intestine. Mucosal hyperplasia was demonstrated by the finding that in each segment, mucosal weight, protein, and DNA content per centimeter of gut length were significantly (P less than 0.01) higher (+38 to + 78%) in the resected group than in transected controls. In segments B and C of resected rats, the changes in DAO activity expressed per gram of mucosa paralleled the changes in mucosal mass, the activity being increased by +69% and +49% (P less than 0.05) compared to the values recorded in transected controls. Expressed per centimeter of gut length, total DAO activity was also enhanced by +141% in segment B (P less than 0.05 vs controls) and by +87% in segment C (P less than 0.01 vs controls) of resected rats. In the duodenum, the changes in DAO activity were small (+36%) and not significant.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Disturbances of prostaglandin I2 (PGI2, prostacyclin) production by adipose tissue contribute to the pathogenesis of diabetic ketoacidosis and may contribute to the pathogenesis of hypertension and vascular disease. We studied the cellular basis of PGI2 production in adipose tissue, measured as release of 6-keto-PGF1 alpha in response to epinephrine. Adipocytes did not produce PGI2 when nonfat cells were removed by repeated washing. The nonadipocyte cellular constituents of adipose tissue (nonfat cells) did not produce PGI2 in the absence of adipocytes. Both adipocytes and nonfat cells were required for PGI2 production in response to epinephrine. Adipocytes pretreated with 0.2 mM aspirin to inhibit PGH synthase nevertheless promoted PGI2 production when mixed with nonfat cells. Nonfat cells preincubated with aspirin did not produce PGI2 when mixed with adipocytes. The nonfat cells converted arachidonic acid to PGI2 but adipocytes did not. Epinephrine stimulated lipolysis and PGI2 production in a dose-dependent parallel manner, but the responses were distinct above 10(-6) M. Characterization of the nonfat cells by fractionation on a Percoll density gradient followed by measurement of angiotensin-converting enzyme activity and 6-keto-PGF1 alpha production indicated that the nonfat cells were predominantly vascular endothelial cells. We conclude that catecholamine-stimulated PGI2 production in adipose tissue results from the cooperation of adipocytes and vascular endothelial cells. The adipocytes provide arachidonic acid, which is converted to PGI2 by the vascular endothelial cells. Because adipose tissue is located near blood vessels throughout the body, adipocytes may be an important source of arachidonic acid for vascular endothelial cells in various circumstances in health and disease. Our findings raise the possibility that adipocytes may, under some circumstances, release arachidonic acid into the systemic circulation where it is used by vascular endothelial cells throughout the body to produce PGI2 and other eicosanoids.\r"

When transplanted with nonimmunogenic islets isolated by nonenzymatic culture, we found that MHC-matched grafts proved to be susceptible to disease recurrence when allowed to remain in situ until ketosis developed in the host. Conversely, the MHC-mismatched grafts did not succumb to the disease process despite the destruction of the beta-cell population of the endogenous pancreas. Four manifestly hyperglycemic BB/Wor rats received sufficient islet mass by allotransplantation to reverse this state. All four animals had ameliorated conditions, and three of the four were restored to a normoglycemic state. Recurrence of diabetes in the BB rat was not observed.\r"

Untreated diabetic animals showed the characteristic capillary basement membrane thickening in both the superficial and deep capillary beds of the retina. Vigorous blood glucose control with insulin therapy was accompanied by a complete prevention of capillary basement membrane thickening in both capillary beds, whereas aldose reductase inhibitor treatment achieved a complete prevention of basement membrane thickening in the deep capillary bed but not in the superficial capillary bed of the diabetic retina. These findings suggest that the mechanisms responsible for capillary basement membrane thickening in diabetes may be varied and modulated by topographical peculiarities in various capillary beds.\r"

  ".W": "The most striking effect of Clostridium difficile infection is its degrading of the intestinal barrier. The aim of this study is to establish whether the cellular or paracellular constituent of the barrier is the initial target of the toxins produced by C difficile. Accordingly, the caecal epithelium of C3H/He mice was challenged under three experimental conditions with the C difficile strain VPI 10463: (1) by in vivo inoculation of axenic mice, (2) by adding the toxins to ligated caeca in vivo, and (3) by adding them to the mucosal side of isolated caeca in Ussing chambers. Under all three conditions, the epithelial barrier was tested in caeca mounted in these chambers. The transepithelial potential difference (PD), electrical conductance (G), and intact and degraded Horseradish peroxidase (HRP) fluxes were used as indexes of permeability. Results were as follows: (1) In axenic mice, C difficile caused severe infection, produced toxins A and B, reduced PD, and enhanced G and intact HRP fluxes without changing degraded HRP fluxes, (2) four hours after the toxins were added to ligated caeca in vivo, PD was relatively unaltered, but G, and intact and degraded HRP fluxes increased, and (3) when toxins were added to caeca during two hours in the Ussing chambers, the only modification observed was an increase in degraded-HRP fluxes. These results indicate that the C difficile toxins gradually cause intestinal lesions. After an apparent resistance, they stimulate the endocytotic process and then increase paracellular permeability and finally cause loss of cell viability.\r"

  ".W": "To ascertain whether small shifts in plasma atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) exerted biological effects in hypertension, we studied the renal, hemodynamic, and hormonal effects of ANF [human ANF-(99-126)] infused at a dose (0.75 pmol/kg/min for 3 hours) that would induce changes in plasma ANF confined to the normal, resting range, in a group of six young men with uncomplicated, mild essential hypertension. During ANF infusions, the patients excreted 11.8 +/- 2.0 mmol (mean +/- SEM) sodium more than during the time-matched placebo phase natriuresis (p less than 0.001, mean increase of 53% above placebo values). Urinary excretion of cyclic guanosine monophosphate rose to more than double (212%, p less than 0.001) placebo values. Plasma renin activity (0.4 +/- 0.05 vs. 0.9 +/- 0.12 nmol/l/hr, p less than 0.0001) and aldosterone concentrations (102 +/- 4 vs. 184 +/- 47 pmol/l, p less than 0.05) were clearly suppressed during administration of ANF. Plasma norepinephrine also fell significantly below placebo values (268 +/- 17 vs. 439 +/- 35 pg/ml, p less than 0.05). Urine volume, the excretion of electrolytes other than sodium, hematocrit, effective renal plasma flow, glomerular filtration rate, and filtration fraction were unaffected by ANF. Similarly, plasma concentrations of epinephrine, arginine vasopressin, adrenocorticotropic hormone, and cortisol were unchanged. Blood pressure and heart rate were unchanged. Minor perturbations in plasma ANF concentrations exert clear biological effects in patients with mild essential hypertension. These data suggest that such minor shifts in plasma ANF are of physiological relevance in mild hypertension and probably contribute to volume homeostasis in this condition.\r"

  ".W": "The mechanism of platelet dysfunctions in stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRSP) was investigated. Platelet aggregation was inversely correlated with blood pressure or heart weight/body weight ratios in various strains of spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR), indicating genetic defects. Thrombin-induced 47 kDa protein phosphorylation was markedly reduced in platelets of SHRSP compared with that in Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rat platelets, accompanying reduced aggregation and secretion, but in 20 kDa protein phosphorylation was unchanged. Ca2+ ionophore A23187-induced responses were also significantly decreased in SHRSP, and the degrees of the changes were greater than those by thrombin. However, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate-induced responses in SHRSP were similar to those in WKY rats, suggesting that protein kinase C activity and its substrate were normally present in SHRSP platelets. Phosphatidylinositol content in platelets of SHRSP was 20% less than that in WKY rat platelets, but the contents of other phospholipids, including phosphatidylinositol-4-monophosphate and phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphates, were unaltered. Thrombin-induced formation of diacylglycerols and phosphatidic acid did not differ from each other at the low concentrations. In the absence of Ca2+, thrombin-induced responses occurred to a similar degree in both platelets, whereas the enhancements by Ca2+ were much greater in WKY rats than in SHRSP. These results suggested that defective Ca2+ functions in receptor-mediated activation of protein kinase C and postkinase-mediated events appear to be an underlying mechanism for the hypofunctions in SHRSP platelets.\r"

Optimal preservation of the antigenicity of BrdU incorporated into the DNA of proliferating cells was seen in tissues fixed in Bouin's fluid, while samples which had been fixed with cross-linking reagents, such as formalin, were usually unreactive. Positivity for BrdU was restored in formalin fixed tissues after digestion with pepsin, but this was usually associated with loss of morphological details. Acid and thermal DNA denaturation techniques gave similar results. It is concluded that Bouin fixation followed by acid or thermal denaturation of DNA is the method of choice for the in situ detection of cells in S-phase using anti-BrdU monoclonal antibody.\r"

  ".W": "Because a previous study utilizing a combination of recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (rt-PA) and urokinase demonstrated reduced reocclusion rates compared with rates obtained with rt-PA alone, this study was conducted to determine whether the combination of rt-PA and streptokinase might achieve similar results at reduced cost. Forty patients with acute myocardial infarction were treated with a 1 h infusion of rt-PA (50 mg) and streptokinase (1.5 million U) administered within 6 h (mean 3.6 +/- 1.2) of symptom onset. Emergency coronary arteriography revealed patency of the infarct-related artery in 30 (75%) of 40 patients. With the addition of coronary angioplasty in those who had unsuccessful thrombolytic reperfusion, the early patency rate was increased to 98%. In-hospital mortality rate (2.5%) and the incidence of significant bleeding requiring transfusion (15%) were low. Angiographically documented reocclusion of the infarct vessel occurred in 3 (8%) of 37 patients by day 7. Regional wall motion of the infarct zone improved by 0.9 +/- 0.9 SD/chord (p less than 0.0005), and ejection fraction increased 3.6 +/- 8% units (p less than 0.05) between immediate and day 7 studies. In contrast to the price of full dose rt-PA ($2,300) or rt-PA with urokinase ($3,500), the cost of this regimen was $1,230. This pilot study demonstrates that at half the cost, a combination of half dose rt-PA with full dose streptokinase offers high infarct vessel patency, recovery of ventricular function, a low rate of reocclusion and few bleeding complications.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The association of increasing serum levels of fibrinogen degradation products after recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (rt-PA) therapy with bleeding and early coronary patency was assessed in 242 patients with acute myocardial infarction. After administration of 5,000 IU heparin, a median of 40 mg (range 35 to 60) of double chain rt-PA was given intravenously in 90 min. Bleeding occurred in 62 patients; in 73% of patients it was observed within the 1st 24 h and 84% of events consisted of hematoma or prolonged bleeding, or both, at puncture sites. Bleeding events occurred 2.12 times as often in patients with serum levels of fibrinogen degradation products greater than 85 mg/liter as in patients with serum levels less than 22 mg/liter (95% confidence interval 1.01 to 4.43). The infarct-related coronary vessel was patent in 65% of patients at 90 min after the start of rt-PA infusion. In patients with high serum levels of fibrin(ogen) degradation products, coronary patency at 90 min after the start of rt-PA infusion was not better (13% less, 95% confidence interval - 33%, 13%) than in patients with low serum levels. This uncoupling of thrombolytic effect in terms of coronary patency and systemic fibrinogenolysis confirms the experimentally demonstrated fibrin specificity of double chain rt-PA in human subjects. Because fibrin specificity of single chain rt-PA is at least similar to that of double chain rt-PA, the observations in this analysis most likely hold also for single chain rt-PA.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "To evaluate determinants of elevated plasma atrial natriuretic factor levels in patients with hypertension, immunoreactive plasma atrial natriuretic factor in 54 normal subjects and 40 untreated hypertensive patients was compared with echocardiographic measurements of cardiac size, function and systemic hemodynamics. In normal subjects, plasma atrial natriuretic factor was related to age, systolic blood pressure and left atrial and ventricular chamber sizes, but only age and ventricular size were independent predictors. In untreated hypertensive patients, atrial natriuretic factor was directly related to age, atrial size, systolic pressure, peripheral resistance and ventricular systolic performance; age, atrial size and peripheral resistance were independent predictors. Eight patients with elevated atrial natriuretic factor values (greater than 25 fmol/ml) were significantly (p less than 0.01) older and had greater atrial and ventricular size and higher systolic pressure and function than normal subjects or patients with normal natriuretic factor levels. Plasma atrial natriuretic factor was inversely related to peak diastolic filling rate in normal subjects (r = -0.59; p less than 0.001), whereas it was positively related to the proportional contribution of atrial systole to left ventricular filling in hypertensive patients (r = 0.77; p less than 0.001). These findings suggest that in normal subjects, impairment of ventricular relaxation with age may contribute to atrial natriuretic factor secretion by increasing left atrial afterload; the correlation with left ventricular size may reflect physiologic fluctuations in plasma volume. In patients with uncomplicated hypertension, left atrial enlargement and consequent stronger atrial contraction contributed to increased atrial natriuretic factor release, whereas no independent relation existed with left ventricular hypertrophy or systolic function. Because ventricular relaxation was normal and ventricular size and systolic performance were increased in hypertensive patients with high atrial natriuretic factor levels, the observed increase in left atrial size and atrial contribution to ventricular filling might reflect a primary increase in venous return in this subset of hypertensive patients.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of flecainide on defibrillation thresholds in 21 open chest, anesthetized dogs were studied. Defibrillation was accomplished using nontruncated exponential pulses delivered through two epicardial patches. Multiple shocks of varying energy were administered after 10 s of ventricular fibrillation in random order. The percent success was plotted against the energy delivered for each dog. A sigmoidal curve was fit to the data and the energy associated with 50% success (E50) calculated. Flecainide (n = 16) or saline solution (n = 5) was then infused and E50 again determined. Flecainide infusion produced mean (+/- standard error of the mean) plasma levels of 610 +/- 111 ng/ml. Defibrillation thresholds were obtainable in 10 of 16 dogs that received flecainide infusion. Flecainide infusion increased E50 by 75% (from 6.5 +/- 1.9 to 11.4 +/- 2.6 J) (P less than 0.05). Infusion of saline solution did not significantly affect defibrillation energy. Of 16 dogs that received flecainide infusion, 12 had one or more complications: 6 had ventricular fibrillation resistant to defibrillation, 6 developed severe hypotension after successful defibrillation and 5 had spontaneous ventricular fibrillation after successful defibrillation. These effects were not seen in any control dogs. Flecainide infusion significantly increases defibrillation threshold and has important adverse arrhythmic and hemodynamic effects in this experimental preparation.\r"

  ".W": "Decision analysis, an analytic approach to making decisions when uncertainty is present, has its foundation in probability and utility theory. It provides insights into the trade-offs that are involved when a selection must be made among patient management strategies. In general, several broad steps are involved. The process begins by formulating the clinical problem as a well focused choice among a limited set of clinical etiologies. These strategies are then structured explicitly in a model that depicts the clinical events that may ensue from each option. By assigning probability values to each outcome, the weighted average outcome or expected utility can be calculated for each alternative strategy. The strategy with the highest expected utility is the optimal one. The methods of decision analysis offer a number of distinct advantages. These include: 1) providing a structure with which to simplify and focus clinical dilemmas; 2) providing a forum for discussing clinical reasoning; and 3) developing a consensus among groups of decision makers.\r"

Policy models deal with populations of individuals, may be static or dynamic and may be descriptive or prescriptive.

Sexual behavior, when paired with unfamiliar males of three age groups, was observed six times in the early follicular phase of two ovarian cycles. Estradiol, LH, and FSH were measured twice during the same time period. Of the behavioral measures, mount, present, and activity were found to be lower in old than in young females. Of the physiological measures, ovarian cyclicity was less regular, estradiol was lower, and FSH and LH were higher in old compared to young females. Correlations between measures suggested two dimensions of reproductive function, a behavioral dimension and a physiological dimension.\r"

Variables such as antibiotic concentration, inoculum of organism, and pharmacokinetic parameters of the drug can be carefully controlled to provide information about the principles of treating infectious diseases as well as an evaluation of specific antimicrobial agents. End points of treatment can be precisely defined (that is, CSF sterility in meningitis, vegetation counts of bacteria in endocarditis) to allow a quantitative evaluation of a new antibiotic. However, it is important to realize that there may be differences in disease pathogenesis and antibiotic pharmacokinetics between experimental infections in animal models and infections in humans. Therefore, results in animal models should be interpreted with caution and compared with results obtained with antimicrobial regimens in clinical studies. Perhaps one of the most useful features of animal models is suggesting which antimicrobials would not be expected to be of therapeutic benefit in man.\r"

Early products of NEG can be measured by various biochemical methods. A method has been developed to localize these early products of glycosylation in vivo in fixed tissue sections of normal and diabetic skin using monoclonal antibodies specific for glucitollysine, which is formed when the early products of NEG are chemically reduced in vitro. Carnoy's-fixed, paraffin-embedded skin samples from six diabetic and 13 nondiabetic subjects were sectioned, mounted on glass slides, and reduced for one h in 100 mM NaBH4. Immunolocalization was by the avidin--biotin immunoperoxidase method. Diabetic skin consistently stained more intensely for glucitollysine than nondiabetic skin. Staining around vessels, in particular, and of the collagenous matrix in general, was markedly enhanced in diabetic skin compared with nondiabetic skin. Antigens present in both the epidermis and the eccrine structures reacted with the antibody in both diabetic and nondiabetic skin but with greater intensity in the diabetic skin. This study has shown that it is possible to localize the early products of NEG in tissue sections using monoclonal antibodies. The findings correlate with biochemical data that show increased NEG in diabetics compared with nondiabetics. This technique should prove valuable for further investigations of the role of NEG in the pathogenesis of diabetes.\r"

The PGD synthetase activity was decreased time dependently, and within 24 h after UVB irradiation it had dropped to 50% of the control level before irradiation. In contrast, the synthesizing activities of PGE2 and PGF2 alpha were unaffected by UVB irradiation. The reduction of PGD synthetase activity after UVB irradiation was much more prominent in the epidermis than in the dermis, which was separated by heat treatment (55 degrees C, 30 sec). Immunohistochemical studies, using anti-(rat spleen PGD synthetase) antibody, revealed that the number of immunopositive cells, which were identified as Langerhans cells, decreased in the basal layer of the epidermis 24 h after UVB irradiation. These results, together with the reduction of ATPase positive cells in the epidermis after UVB irradiation, suggest that the decrease of PGD synthetase activity in rat skin by UVB irradiation is, at least in part, due to the reduced Langerhans cell population in the basal layer of the epidermis.\r"

  ".W": "Cyclosporine A (CsA) is efficacious in the treatment of psoriasis. Although CsA is known to inhibit T-lymphocyte proliferation in vitro, whether this is its mode of action in psoriasis is uncertain. 12-0-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) induces an inflammatory, hyperplastic response in mouse skin, with many of the biochemical and histologic aberrations that occur in psoriatic epidermis. Protein kinase C is the major cellular phorbol ester receptor, and most responses of cells to TPA are mediated by PK-C, which is directly activated by TPA. We therefore have investigated the effects of CsA on pleiotypic responses induced by TPA and whether CsA acts in vivo as a direct inhibitor of PK-C. Simultaneous application of CsA (1.7 mumol) and TPA (10 nmol) to mouse skin significantly reduced inflammatory cell infiltration and increased epidermal thickness induced by TPA treatment alone. CsA had to be applied within 30 min of TPA application in order to have a significant inhibitory effect. Optimal doses of CsA inhibited TPA-induced ODC activity, TGase activity, arachidonic acid release, and interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta) mRNA to the same degree (approximately 80%), despite measurement at widely different times (30 min-12 h) required to obtain maximal induction by TPA. CsA did not, however, directly inhibit activation of PK-C by TPA. These data demonstrate that CsA blocks the pleiotypic responses of mouse skin to TPA treatment involving biochemical events, inflammatory cell infiltration, and epidermal hyperplasia. The molecular site(s) of action of CsA appears to be distal to the initial activation of PK-C by TPA and clearly inhibits PK-C inducible events. Furthermore, the above data suggest that CsA may directly affect keratinocytes in vivo.\r"

Arachidonic acid metabolism was initially studied by radio-high-performance liquid chromatography analysis of incubation media from cells that had been prelabeled with [3H] arachidonic acid. In subsequent experiments with unlabeled cells the eicosanoids were quantified by radioimmunoassay. Prostaglandin (PG)D2 was the major cyclooxygenase product released from purified mast cells challenged with anti-IgE or A23187. In density gradient studies there was a significant correlation between PGD2 and histamine release (r = 0.52, p less than 0.01) and between PGD2 release and the numbers of mast cells (r = 0.42, p less than 0.02). There was no correlation with the total numbers of nucleated cells. Other cyclooxygenase products were also detected, the formation of 6-keto-PGF1 alpha and PGE2 being principally associated with gradient fractions containing endothelial cells. Leukotriene (LT)C4 was the major lipoxygenase product detected, reaching a maximum of 3.87 +/- 0.56 ng/10(6) mast cells upon activation with anti-IgE compared with 35.37 +/- 7.22 ng/10(6) mast cells of PGD2. When normalized to histamine release and expressed in molar terms, skin mast cells released approximately 20-fold more PGD2 than LTC4. Thus, the cutaneous mast cell is one likely source of the PGD2 and LTC4 released during cutaneous immediate hypersensitivity reactions.\r"

  ".W": "The ability of pravastatin, a new hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitor, to lower plasma lipid levels and modify lipoprotein patterns was compared with that of gemfibrozil in 18 patients with familial hypercholesterolemia who participated in a 16-week, double-blind, parallel trial. Pravastatin proved better than gemfibrozil in lowering total and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterolemia: -23.6% and -28.2% versus -18.1% and -21.4%, respectively. A significant positive correlation was found between the starting level of serum cholesterol (both total and LDL) and the gemfibrozil-induced reduction (r = 0.72 and 0.69), whereas the hypocholesterolemic effect of pravastatin was apparently independent from pretreatment levels (r = 0.32 and 0.10). Apolipoprotein B concentrations were lowered by 25.4% (pravastatin) and 22.0% (gemfibrozil). Pravastatin and gemfibrozil reduced triglyceride levels by 13.9% and 49.4%, respectively. Both drugs increased the level of high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, but this change was significant only with gemfibrozil (p less than 0.05). The HDL subfraction structure and distribution were not modified by pravastatin treatment. Gemfibrozil, in contrast, increased HDL3 cholesterol level by 9% because of an enrichment of HDL3 particles in both free cholesterol and cholesteryl esters and lowered the flotation rate of HDL3 (p less than 0.05). LDL particles became smaller after gemfibrozil treatment (diameter: 25.4 +/- 0.3 nm vs 26.1 +/- 0.4 nm, p less than 0.01) and were not modified by pravastatin. This comparison shows a more pronounced efficacy of the HMG CoA reductase inhibitor on total and LDL cholesterol levels, also indicating that pravastatin acts by a single major mechanism, reducing the number of circulating LDL particles. Gemfibrozil may exert additional activities, possibly consequent to the stimulation of very low density lipoprotein catabolism.\r"

We have studied the relevance of the extracellular versus intracellular calcium stores necessary for superoxide generation in neutrophils and neutrophil cytoplasts stimulated by N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (FMLP) and phorbol ester and our findings are as follows. (1) FMLP triggered superoxide anion (O2-) generation only in the presence of extracellular calcium, but phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) activation was independent of extracellular calcium. (2) inhibition of calcium transport channels with verapamil produced a dose-related inhibition of FMLP- and PMA-stimulated O2- production. Verapamil inhibition of FMLP-stimulated but not PMA-stimulated O2- was reversed simply by increasing extracellular calcium concentration. Cytosolic calcium loading with substimulatory concentrations of A23187 (0.3 to 0.6 mumol/L) (only in calcium-replete medium) could reverse the verapamil inhibition of PMA-triggered O2- generation. An inhibitor of intracellular calcium availability, 3,4,5-trimethoxybenzoic acid (TMB-8), similarly inhibited FMLP-stimulated and PMA-stimulated O2- production; this inhibition was reversible with A23187 calcium loading. (3) Verapamil, although it inhibited the functional oxidant response, had no inhibitory effect on fura 2-monitored cytosolic calcium rise induced by FMLP stimulation. (4) No cytosolic calcium increment was observed with PMA. O2- generation from enucleated polymorphonuclear leukocyte (PMN) cytoplasts was sensitive to inhibition by verapamil but was less so than O2- generation from intact PMNs. Cytoplasts, nearly depleted of cytoplasmic organelles and cytoskeleton, the potential sites of intracellular calcium stores, were markedly insensitive to the inhibitory effects of TMB-8.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In this study, we measured the effects of acute exercise and exercise training on the levels of dopa and catecholamines in the plasma of healthy, older individuals. Venous blood was drawn from 19 men, from 52 to 75 years of age, at rest, at a standard submaximal work load, at peak exercise, and 3 minutes after exercise on a cycle ergometer. Ten of 12 men then completed 12 to 16 weeks of supervised training, and seven continued normal activity. All 17 men were then retested. The seven control subjects subsequently underwent exercise training as above and were retested again. Levels of dopa and catecholamines in plasma samples were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection. Dopa levels at rest were considerably higher than free dopamine, epinephrine, and norepinephrine. During short-term exercise, levels of dopa and catecholamines increased. The absolute increase in dopa was greater than the increase in epinephrine or dopamine but was not greater than that in norepinephrine. After the training period, basal dopa levels increased significantly and correlated with the increase in peak oxygen uptake. There was no change in basal conjugated norepinephrine or dopamine levels with exercise or training, but the level of conjugated epinephrine decreased slightly. No changes occurred in levels of dopa or catecholamines in the untrained group. Free dopamine, norepinephrine, and epinephrine levels at peak exercise were increased after exercise training.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Respiratory oxygen, carbon dioxide, and nitrous oxide concentrations were recorded in 20 patients breath-by-breath during general anesthesia and early recovery, using the Cardiocap multiparameter monitor. Several approved maneuvers were performed to demonstrate the usefulness of endtidal oxygen measurement. \"Oxygrams\" provided by the fast paramagnetic oxygen sensor confirmed the capnometric information in the diagnosis of hypoventilation, apnea, and disconnections. In one patient, the alarm for inspiratory oxygen concentration, set at 18%, appeared to prevent alveolar hypoxia and low arterial saturation from occurring when oxygen instead of nitrous oxide was turned off. Low end-tidal oxygen levels revealed inadequate fresh gas oxygen supplementation while low flow circuits were closed. During manual hypoventilation at the end of anesthesia, the inspiratory-expiratory oxygen difference increased almost twofold while end-tidal carbon dioxide increased by only 30%. Changes in nitrous oxide concentration often complemented oxygen-related information obtained in our observations. In the recovery room, a decrease in end-tidal oxygen concentration preceded low pulse oximetry readings. Therefore, it is suggested that all three gases should be monitored continuously to prevent mishaps related to insufficient ventilation and inappropriate gas concentrations during anesthesia and immediate recovery.\r"

  ".W": "In this phase II trial, 105 eligible patients with no prior chemotherapy and advanced sarcoma received doxorubicin, ifosfamide, and dacarbazine (DTIC) with mesna uroprotection (MAID). Starting doses of these drugs were 60, 7,500, and 900 mg/m2 divided over 72 hours by continuous infusion, respectively. Mesna was given for 84 to 96 hours at 2,500 mg/m2/d. Myelosuppression was dose limiting, causing the only toxic death (sepsis). Nonhematologic toxicity consisted predominantly of anorexia and vomiting. Severe mucositis, macroscopic hematuria, renal tubular acidosis, renal failure, and CNS toxicity occurred in less than 5% of cycles. No cardiotoxicity was detected. The overall response rate (10% complete response [CR]) was 47% (95% confidence intervals, 5% to 18% and 37% to 57%, respectively). Most responses (approximately 70%) were observed within two cycles. Median times to progression were 10 and 9 months, respectively. Histologic high tumor grade, lesions less than 5 cm, and less than 1 year from diagnosis to study entry correlated with the probability of response. The median survival was 16 months. Time from diagnosis to study entry, performance status, and extent of disease, but not histologic grade, correlated with survival. Following CR, two patients remain disease-free at 32 and 16 months. Of the 15 additional patients rendered disease-free with surgery, two remain disease-free at 30 and 18 months with no further therapy. While most relapses occurred in sites of prior involvement, death from CNS metastases occurred in 11 of the 80 patients with high-grade sarcomas, of whom seven were still responding systematically (three complete responders). Because of its substantial response in this phase II trial, the MAID regimen is being compared with doxorubicin and DTIC alone in advanced sarcomas and to observation in the adjuvant treatment of high-grade sarcomas in randomized trials.\r"

In four (66.7%) of six patients with metastatic brain tumors, however, both the PBL's and TIL's showed a positive blastogenetic response to their own tumor cells. In these four patients, this lymphocyte blastogenetic response to tumor cells were at a much lower level compared with phytohemagglutinin P or allogeneic lymphocyte stimulation. Furthermore, these responses were increased when the cells were cultured with interferon-gamma (500 U). Other lymphokines had no effect on the response. This method appears to be useful in identifying the tumor-specific immune response in patients with malignant brain tumor.\r"

A linear relationship between measured grain density and isotope concentration was demonstrated with uniformly-labeled standard sources of epoxy-embedded gelatin containing [111In]albumin; half-distance of spatial resolution was 0.6 micron. The technique was illustrated by measuring 24-hr accumulation of diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid-coupled 111In-labeled human polyclonal IgG and human serum albumin (HSA) in a thigh infection model in the rat. Gamma camera images localized the infection and showed target-to-background ratios of 2.5 +/- 0.3 for IgG and 1.4 +/- 0.02 for human serum albumin (mean +/- s.d., n = 3). Using quantitative autoradiography, significantly higher average tissue concentrations were found in the infected thighs at 4 to 4.5% of the initial plasma concentrations as compared to 0.2 to 0.3% of initial plasma concentrations in the noninfected thigh (p less than 0.05); these radiolabeled proteins were not inflammatory cell associated and localized primarily within the edematous interstitial spaces of the infection.\r"

  ".W": "The aim of this study was to assess the hormonal alterations that may mediate the systemic hypertension that develops in patients during the perioperative period of orthotopic liver transplantation. We studied nine pediatric patients without previous hypertension or renal disease during six time points, starting before transplantation and ending at 48 hours after surgery. Hypertension developed in all patients in association with central venous pressures less than 10 mm Hg. Free water clearance was negative in all nine patients. Vasopressin levels increased intraoperatively but fell as hypertension developed. Atrial natriuretic factor levels increased as systemic blood pressure rose. A high level of plasma renin activity was observed in four patients with renal insufficiency. In six patients, postoperative 24-hour urinary norepinephrine excretion was within the normal age-adjusted range. These findings suggest that the combination of cyclosporine, corticosteroids, and, in some patients, an elevated plasma renin activity prevents the kidney from responding to the acute volume and salt overload with an appropriate diuresis and natriuresis, thus leading to systemic hypertension. The treatment of hypertension after liver transplantation may include salt restriction, diuretics, and, in those patients with a low creatinine excretion index, angiotensin coverting enzyme inhibitors.\r"

This study simulated DRG All Payor methods on a sample (N = 298) of rheumatology patients for a 3-year period using both federal and New York DRG reimbursement now in effect. Both Medicare and Medicaid patients had (on average) a longer hospital length of stay and total hospital cost compared to patients from Blue Cross and other commercial payors. All payors (i.e., Medicaid, Blue Cross, Medicare and commercial insurors) generated significant financial risk under the DRG All Payor scheme.

  ".U": "89362589\r", 
  ".W": "Acute cerebrovascular changes which occur following traumatic brain injury represent a highly complex, multifactorial pathophysiologic process which is poorly understood. It is now recognized that, under normal conditions, the brain is a source of a variety of arachidonic acid metabolites which are synthesized by both cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase. The specific cellular source of these highly vasoactive substances remains controversial. Recent work has demonstrated that lipoxygenase products were detected by immunosensitive assay in whole brain samples from a gerbil concussive injury model, yet the production of leukotrienes could not be accounted for by cerebral vessels and their contents alone. It has been theorized that the probable source for these metabolites is the cortical neuron. We sought to elucidate whether cultured human glial cells, obtained from specimens removed at the time of surgery, are a significant source of lipoxygenase products as measured by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). We observed that these cells consistently produced 5, 12, and 15-HETE class eicosanoids despite failure to produce significant cyclooxygenase products. These preliminary findings are of considerable interest because these lipoxygenase products are known to be highly vasoactive as well as potent mediators of increased vascular permeability. Since it is known that mechanical perturbation of cell membranes stimulates the release of arachidonic acid from membrane phospholipids, it is conceivable that the production of these eicosanoids following traumatic brain injury could account for local cerebrovascular changes including both vasospasm and interstitial edema formation.\r"

All enzyme levels were highest on days 1 and 3 after lithotripsy and returned to baseline by day 28. Factors associated with post-treatment enzyme elevation included female sex, a lower pre-treatment creatinine clearance and stone size greater than 1 cm. These findings indicate that there is a transient selective increase in urinary enzyme excretion after extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy.\r"

All four cell lines tested demonstrated a dose dependent sensitivity to the cytotoxic effects of TNF alone. The degree of sensitivity varied for each cell line. IFN gamma alone also mediated a dose dependent antiproliferative effect in three of the four cell lines. Combinations of IFN gamma and TNF produced diverse inhibitory effects. Preincubation of the cells for various time intervals with noninhibitory concentrations of IFN gamma prior to the addition of TNF resulted in distinct effects for each cell line. Pretreatment enhanced the cytotoxic effect of TNF for some cell lines; however, others became less susceptible and some demonstrated enhanced proliferation in the presence of both agents. Optimal pretreament times also varied from cell line to cell line. These results demonstrate variability in responsiveness by renal carcinoma cell lines to combination IFN gamma and TNF treatments and suggest that timing as well as concentration may be important in in vivo therapy.\r"

Two hundred eighty-six alcoholics without depression and 171 alcoholics with depression began the 52-week outpatient study; 172 alcoholics (60.1%) without depression and 108 alcoholics (63.2%) with depression completed the study. Among both all alcoholics who began the study and a subgroup who completed the study, no significant differences between alcoholics who took lithium and those who took placebo were found for the following outcome measures:number of alcoholics abstinent, number of days of drinking, number of alcohol-related hospitalizations, changes in rating of severity of alcoholism, and change in severity of depression. Similarly, no significant differences were found when only the 82 alcoholics compliant in taking lithium and the 89 alcoholics compliant in taking placebo were considered. In our study, lithium treatment did not affect the course of alcoholism in either depressed or nondepressed alcoholics.\r"

  ".W": "Atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) has been shown to reverse experimental models of ischemic acute renal failure (ARF). However, infusion of ANP has been associated with systemic hypotension making its use in clinical ARF impractical. Therefore, in this investigation, dopamine (D) was combined with intravenous (i.v.) atriopeptin III (AP III) to determine if this regimen was effective in reversing ARF while preventing systemic hypotension and maintaining renal blood flow (RBF). Four groups of Munich-Wistar rats were studied. Group 1, sham-ARF; Group 2, renal artery (RA) clamp (55 min) followed by i.v. saline; Group 3, RA clamp followed by i.v. AP III-D; and Group 4, RA clamp followed by i.v. D only. All infusions were begun after RA clamp release and continued for four hour. Mean arterial pressure in Group 3 rats given AP III-D were similar to that in Group 2, slightly less than that in Groups 1 and 4 (P less than 0.05), but consistently greater than 100 mm Hg during the four hour infusion. RBF in Group 3 was elevated above the level in Group 1 at P less than 0.05. Glomerular filtration rate (GFR), depressed by 52% in Group 2, was corrected to control (sham-ARF) levels in Group 3. In Group 4 there was a small but significant increase in GFR compared to Group 2 (P less than 0.05), but it remained less than that in sham-ARF or AP III-D treated ARF rats (P less than 0.01). Urine flow rate and urine sodium excretion rate were more than sixfold higher in Group 3 than any other group.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "There is evidence that cyclooxygenase products of arachidonic acid participate in the control of renin release. In this study we tested the hypothesis that prostaglandin (PG) I2 and/or its metabolite(s), which are synthesized in the afferent arteriole (AF), stimulate renin release by acting directly on the AF while PGE2 stimulates renin release indirectly via the macula densa. AF alone and AF with macula densa attached (AF-MD) were microdissected from rabbit kidneys and incubated in vitro. The renin release rate from a single AF (or an AF-MD) was calculated and expressed as ng AI.hr-1. AF-1/hr (where AI is angiotensin I). When arachidonic acid (0.12 mM) or PGI2 (10 microM) was added to AF, renin release increased significantly (P less than 0.0001) from 1.04 +/- 0.21 to 3.12 +/- 0.86 (x +/- SEM, N = 7), and from 0.45 +/- 0.14 to 1.48 +/- 0.53 (N = 9), respectively. During the recovery period, renin release increased even further, reaching 9.53 +/- 1.76 and 4.50 +/- 1.24, respectively. A PGI2 synthetase inhibitor, 9, 11-azoprosta-5,13-dienoic acid blocked the effect of arachidonic acid. To examine whether the increases in renin release during the recovery period were due to metabolite(s) of PGI2, we tested the effect of both 6-keto-PGE1 (an active metabolite of PGI2) and carba-PGI2 (a synthetic analog that is metabolized differently from PGI2). Six-keto-PGE1 and carba-PGI2 increased renin release only during the experimental period with no further increase during the recovery period.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "A reversible reduction in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is a frequent side effect in patients treated with the immunosuppressant cyclosporin A (CsA). The pathophysiology of acute CsA nephrotoxicity, however, is unclear. Since eicosanoids are local mediators of glomerular hemodynamics, they might be involved in CsA induced changes in GFR. We therefore studied the effect of CsA on prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) production by rat mesangial cells in culture. PGE2 production by mesangial cells following stimulation with angiotensin II (AII) (10(-6) M) or the Ca2+-ionophore A23187 (1 microgram/ml) was significantly inhibited when cells were grown for 24 hours in media which contained CsA (800 to 3200 ng/ml). CsA did not affect viability of mesangial cells as determined by 51Cr release or by cell proliferation measured by 3H-thymidine incorporation. CsA (3200 ng/ml) did not inhibit PGE2 formation by rat MC microsomes incubated with arachidonic acid. However, CsA, in a dose dependent manner, inhibited A23187 and angiotensin II induced release of 3H-labelled arachidonic acid from rat mesangial cells. These data demonstrate that CsA reduces PGE2 formation by rat mesangial cells in culture, probably by inhibiting the release of substrate arachidonic acid from cell membranes rather than by inhibition of cyclooxygenase. This effect may contribute to the reduction in GFR which accompanies CsA therapy.\r"

  ".W": "We report the inter- and intra-individual variability in fractional lithium clearance (CLi), an alleged quantitative index of Na and water delivery from the proximal tubules, in humans (N = 91). The inter-individual variability was large, the variation coefficients at various Na excretion rates ranging between 11% and 19%. The intra-individual variability was small, the relative intra-individual standard deviation for duplicate measurements (N = 33) being 5%. These observations suggest large inter-individual differences in proximal tubular Na reabsorption. To confirm this, we also studied the inter- and intra-individual variability in the maximum urine flow during water diuresis (Vmax), an index of Na delivery to the diluting segment. They were found to be almost identical to the inter- and intra-individual variability in CLi, and fractional CLi and Vmax correlated strongly (r = 0.83, P less than 0.001). In addition, the inter-individual variability in the fractional clearance of uric acid (CUA), a directional marker of Na reabsorption in the proximal tubules, was large, but the intra-individual variability small. The correlation between fractional CUA and CLi, however, was relatively weak (r = 0.40, P less than 0.01). Although our results do not prove the exact, quantitative validity of the lithium clearance concept, we conclude that the variability in CLi reflects large inter-individual differences in Na handling in the proximal segments of the nephron. Our observations also have implications for the use of the lithium clearance method. The large inter-individual variability in CLi makes the method less suitable to detect subtle differences in CLi in small, unpaired groups of subjects.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Twenty-one patients with hepatosplenic schistosomiasis mansoni and biopsy-documented mesangiocapillary glomerulonephritis (MCGN) were studied and compared with 19 patients with the idiopathic form of MCGN. Nephrotic syndrome was the most frequent clinical presentation in both groups. At the time of diagnosis nine patients with hepatosplenomegaly (4 with associated arterial hypertension) and 12 (8 with arterial hypertension) among the patients with idiopathic MCGN had renal insufficiency. At the end of the follow-up period 16 patients with hepatosplenic schistosomiasis and MCGN (75.2 months) and 15 with the idiopathic form (52.1 months) had renal failure. Also, when compared at 48 months of follow-up, no difference in renal function could be detected in both groups. No benefits related to anti-parasitic treatment in the schistosomiasis group and immunosuppression therapy in either group could be documented. The progression of the renal disease, as assessed by the reciprocal of serum creatinine versus time, and the survival curve, were not different between the two groups. It is concluded that MCGN in patients with the hepatosplenic form of schistosomiasis mansoni is a progressive disease not influenced by anti-parasitic or immunosuppressive therapy, and presents a clinical course similar to that of the idiopathic form.\r"

Both purified enzymes were characterized and their properties were compared. Enzyme I showed a lower optimal temperature and was less pH stable. Enzyme II appeared to be homogeneous in charge, in contrast to the heterogeneity observed for enzyme I. Studies on their specificity using natural substrates showed that enzyme I hydrolyzed GM1, asialofetuin and lactose. However, enzyme II was only able to cleave galactose from the disaccharide. Some of the carbohydrates tested acted as activators for enzyme II, suggesting a mechanism of transglycosilation. Using lactose as substrate we confirmed the ability of enzyme II to transfer galactose residues to D-maltose and N-acetylgalactosamine.\r"

Pretreatment of the animals with inhibitors of either thromboxane or angiotensin synthesis for 48 hours prior to and during obstruction eliminated the contribution of these vasoconstrictors. Inhibition of these vasoconstrictors during the period of obstruction results in a greater increase in renal plasma flow and GFR than when inhibition was accomplished after release of the obstruction. These data suggest a greater role for these vasoconstrictors in the decrease in GFR that occurs with obstruction. Simultaneous inhibition of thromboxane and angiotensin production normalized GFR of the postobstructed kidney. Administration of atrial peptide after release of obstruction in the different groups of rats resulted in further increases in GFR, urine flow and absolute sodium excretion. It is suggested that atrial peptide participates in the renal hemodynamic changes that occur in the postobstructed kidney.\r"

Surgical procedures followed the techniques that had been developed in animals. Transplantation of the unoperated contralateral lung made it possible to avoid dissection in the obliterated pleural space and to minimize bleeding, which simplified the procedure considerably. Dramatic reduction in pulmonary artery pressure and improved respiratory function allowed both patients to be weaned from cardiopulmonary bypass without problems. Although the first patient died of liver and renal failure soon after the operation, an intact cough reflex facilitated recovery in the second patient, who has been discharged with essentially normal respiratory function. This report describes heart and unilateral lung transplantation as a procedure of choice for patients with extensive pleural adhesions that made total cardiopulmonary replacement unfeasible.\r"

  ".W": "In previous studies of the antibody response to hepatitis B vaccine in 598 subjects who received a full course of vaccination, we observed a bimodal response, with about 14 percent producing less than approximately 1000 radioimmunoassay (RIA) units. An analysis of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) HLA and complement types of 20 of the subjects with the lowest responses indicated a greater-than-expected number of homozygotes for the extended or fixed MHC haplotype [HLA-B8, SC01, DR3]. This finding suggested that the lack of a normal response was a recessive MHC-linked trait. In this study, we prospectively vaccinated five homozygotes and nine heterozygotes for this haplotype in the expectation that the homozygotes would produce much lower levels of antibody than the heterozygotes. When the antibody response was assessed two months after the third injection, four of the five homozygotes had produced very low levels (approximately 1000 units or less) of antibody (mean, 467 RIA units; range, less than 8 to 1266), whereas all nine heterozygotes produced more than 2500 RIA units (mean, 15,608; range, 2655 to 28,900) (P less than 0.01). We conclude that the usual response to hepatitis B surface antigen is due to the presence of a dominant immune-response gene in the MHC and that a low response is due to the absence of such a gene and the presence on both chromosomes of MHC haplotypes (such as [HLA-B8, SC01, DR3]) that indicate such a response.\r"

The presence of these late potentials is known to be associated with an increase in the risk of ventricular tachycardia and sudden death. Because patients with acute myocardial infarction who receive thrombolytic therapy have a reduced incidence of ventricular tachyarrhythmia and sudden death, we sought to determine whether such patients also have a decreased incidence of late potentials. We studied 106 patients less than 75 years of age who were admitted with a first myocardial infarction and in whom a signal-averaged electrocardiogram was recorded within 48 hours of admission. Within four hours of the onset of chest pain, tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) was given to 44 patients, and 62 were treated conventionally. In the t-PA group, late potentials were recorded in 2 of 44 patients (5 percent), as compared with 14 of 62 (23 percent) in the conventionally treated group (P = 0.01). Furthermore, among the patients treated with t-PA, continued occlusion of the infarct-related artery was related to the presence of late potentials. In the t-PA group, late potentials were recorded within 24 hours of angiography in 2 of the 6 patients with an occluded infarct-related artery, as compared with none of the 38 patients with a patient infarct-related artery. Our data suggest that successful thrombolytic therapy is associated with a marked reduction in the incidence of late potentials on the signal-averaged electrocardiogram. Long-term follow-up will be required to determine whether this finding predicts a reduced incidence of subsequent ventricular tachyarrhythmia and sudden death.\r"

  ".W": "To compare the cost effectiveness of bone marrow transplantation and conventional chemotherapy, we evaluated the resources used in the care of adult patients with acute nonlymphocytic leukemia who were enrolled in a prospective trial and received induction chemotherapy at a single university hospital. Nineteen patients were subsequently treated with chemotherapy and 17 with transplantation. Cost accounting began with induction chemotherapy and extended over a five-year period. Costs were estimated by means of a resource-based, multivariate prediction model. The transplantation and chemotherapy groups had virtually equivalent use of resources (hospital days, laboratory tests, blood products, and radiologic and operative procedures) over five years, except for a 10-fold increase in the use of the intensive care unit for the patients who underwent transplantation (P less than 0.001). The total costs over five years were estimated at $193,000 per patient for transplantation and $136,000 per patient for chemotherapy (P = 0.02). At five years, the costs per year of life saved (\"life-year\") were nearly equal ($62,500 per life-year for transplantation vs. $64,000 per life-year for chemotherapy) because of the better rate of disease-free survival in patients who underwent bone marrow transplantation. We conclude that the cost effectiveness of bone marrow transplantation to treat acute nonlymphocytic leukemia compares favorably with that of chemotherapy and could be further enhanced if intensive care resources were used more selectively.\r"

  ".W": "T-cell differentiation in the thymus is thought to involve a progression from the CD4-CD8- phenotype through CD4+CD8+ intermediates to mature CD4+ or CD8+ cells. There is evidence that during this process T cells bearing receptors potentially reactive to 'self' are deleted by a process termed 'negative selection' One example of this process occurs in mice carrying polymorphic Mls antigens, against which a detectable proportion of T cells are autoreactive. These mice show clonal deletion of thymic and peripheral T-cell subsets that express the autoreactive V beta 3 segment of the T-cell antigen receptor, but at most a two-fold depletion of thymic cells at the CD4+CD8+ stage. By contrast, transgenic mice bearing both alpha and beta chain genes encoding autoreactive receptors recognizing other ligands, show severe depletion of CD4+CD8+ thymocytes as well, suggesting that negative selection occurs much earlier. We report here the Mls 2a/3a mediated elimination of T cells expressing a transgene encoded V beta 3-segment, in T-cell receptor alpha/beta and beta-transgenic mice. Severe depletion of CD4+CD8+ thymocytes is seen only in the alpha/beta chain transgenic mice, whereas both strains delete mature V beta 3 bearing CD4+ and CD8+ T cells efficiently. We conclude that severe CD4+CD8+ thymocyte deletion in alpha/beta transgenic mice results from the premature expression of both receptor chains, and does not reflect a difference in the timing or mechanism of negative selection for Mls antigens as against the allo- and MHC class 1-restricted antigens used in the other studies.\r"

  ".W": "Specific monoclonal antibodies have made possible the identification of two T-cell antigen receptor (TCR) heterodimers, alpha beta TCR and gamma delta TCR. Formation of these receptors is largely separated by the preferential pairing of alpha-TCR with beta and gamma-TCR with delta, the sequential rearrangement and expression of the TCR loci during thymic development and the deletion of the delta-loci either prior to or concomitant with alpha-rearrangement in alpha beta TCR cells. Here we show that delta-TCR can substitute for alpha in pairing with beta to form a beta delta heterodimer. This receptor is expressed on the cell surface of the T-leukaemia cell line DND41 as analysed with beta- and delta-specific monoclonal antibodies. We suggest that a variety of factors including, for example, the deletion of the delta-TCR loci, can now be understood as exclusion mechanisms operating to prevent not only the formation of gamma delta receptors, but also of beta delta T-cell receptors, thereby promoting the numerically dominant alpha beta TCR lineage. Nevertheless, some developing T-cells that do not rearrange the alpha-loci may express the beta delta TCR as described here.\r"

These two proteins, together with the yeast GCN4 protein, belong to a growing family of transcription factors, including FosB, Fra1, JunB and JunD, whose members share a highly conserved DNA-binding domain. This domain is composed of two structures: a basic motif, which is thought to bind directly to DNA; and a leucine zipper, which provides a dimerization interface. Although this domain is highly conserved in Fos, Jun and GCN4, each of these three proteins has very different relative affinities for the TRE. To understand these differences, we used 'domain-swapping' experiments designed to test the relative contributions of the basic motif and the leucine zipper to TRE-binding affinity. Here we show that fos, jun and GCN4 have different affinities for the TRE due to differences in the hetero- or homo-dimerization capacity of their leucine zipper domains; the basic motifs of these three proteins have comparable DNA binding potential. These results indicate that leucine zippers control the types of protein complexes which can associate with a TRE and regulate gene expression.\r"

  ".U": "89365156\r", 
  ".W": "In sympathetic neurons, catecholamines interact with prejunctional alpha-adrenergic receptors to reduce delivery of transmitter to postjunctional target organs. This autoinhibitory feedback is a general phenomenon seen in diverse neurons containing a variety of transmitters. The underlying mechanisms of alpha-adrenergic inhibition are not clear, although decreases in cyclic AMP and cAMP-mediated phosphorylation have been implicated. We have studied depolarization-induced catecholamine release and calcium-channel currents in frog sympathetic neurons. Here we show that alpha-adrenergic inhibition of transmitter release can be explained by inhibition of Ca2+-channel currents and not by modulation of intracellular proteins. Noradrenaline strongly reduces the activity of N-type Ca2+ channels, the dominant calcium entry pathway triggering sympathetic transmitter release, whereas L-type Ca2+ channels are not significantly inhibited. The down-modulation of N-type channels involves changes in rapid gating kinetics but not in unitary flux. This is the first detailed description of inhibition of a high-voltage activated neuronal Ca2+ channel at the single-channel level. The coupling between alpha-adrenergic receptors and N-type channels involves a G protein, but not a readily diffusible cytoplasmic messenger or protein kinase C, and may be well suited for rapid and spatially localized feedback-control of transmitter release.\r"

In general, class I and class II MHC products provide a context for the recognition of foreign antigens by CD8+ and CD4+ T cells, respectively. This recognition seems to be largely dependent on alpha beta TCR heterodimers, whereas the function of the second gamma delta TCR, present on a minor subpopulation of cells, is still unknown. In the mouse, the existence of six cell-surface MHC class I products (K, D, L, Qa-1, Qa-2 and Tla) has been firmly established by serological, biochemical and genetic evidence. So far, only the most polymorphic of them, K, D and L ('classical' class I) have been reported as restriction elements for T-cell recognition of foreign antigens. The function of the relatively invariant Qa and Tla molecules remains unknown. We have made a T-helper cell hybridoma clone (DGT3) that recognizes synthetic copolymer poly(Glu50Tyr50) in the context of Qa-1 cell surface product, and has a CD4-CD8- phenotype. Our studies indicate that DGT3 cells express the gamma delta TCR on the cell surface, implicating its role in Qa-1-restricted antigen recognition. This is the first evidence that T cells can recognize foreign antigen in association with self Qa product, confirming that Qa molecules not only topologically, but also functionally, belong to the MHC.\r"

  ".W": "Many eukaryotic proteins involved in transcriptional regulation contain within their DNA-binding domains a polypeptide loop (the zinc finger) which interacts with DNA. In proteins possessing multiple zinc fingers, including TFIIIA, Sp1, SWI5 and oestrogen/glucocorticoid receptors, the region containing the zinc fingers confers DNA-binding specificity. By contrast, our results demonstrate that all but one of the 28 amino acids encompassing the single zinc-finger region of GAL4, the yeast transcriptional activator, can be replaced with the analogous zinc-finger region from another yeast-activator protein, PPR1, without changing the DNA-binding specificity of GAL4. A 14-amino-acid region adjacent to the zinc finger is necessary for determining specific recognition of DNA sequences.\r"

  ".W": "T lymphocytes are found not only as recirculating cells in the lymphoid system, but also as immobile cells in certain epithelia. T-cell antigen receptors (TCR) of both alpha/beta and gamma/delta-heterodimer subtypes can exhibit an extremely high degree of diversity. The diversity of alpha/beta TCRs derives from the use of a large number of variable (V) gene segments, as well as junctional diversity generated during rearrangement of these segments, whereas the diversity of gamma/delta TCRs derives largely from junctional elements, with a smaller contribution from a limited number of V gene segments. Many T cells in the epidermal and intestinal epithelia of mice express TCR composed of gamma/delta heterodimers. We demonstrate here that gamma/delta TCRs of T cells in both these tissues are restricted in V gene usage, with different elements predominating. The TCR junctional diversity of epidermal T cells, however, is extremely limited, whereas that of intestinal T cells is extremely diverse. The distinctive features of these two populations suggest that they develop or are selected differently for particular tissue-specific functions.\r"

These two natriuretic peptides apparently share common receptors and stimulate the intracellular production of cyclic GMP as a second messenger. Molecular cloning has defined two types of natriuretic peptide receptors: the ANP-C receptor of relative molecular mass (Mr) 60-70,000 (60-70 K), which is not coupled to cGMP production and may function in the clearance of ANP and the ANP-A receptor of Mr 120-140 K, which is a membrane form of guanylate cyclase in which ligand binding to the extracellular domain activates the cytoplasmic domain of the enzyme. Here we report the cloning and expression of a second human natriuretic peptide-receptor guanylate cyclase, the ANP-B receptor. The ANP-B receptor is preferentially activated by porcine brain natriuretic peptide rather than human alpha-ANP, whereas the ANP-A receptor responds similarly to both natriuretic peptides. These observations may have important implications for our understanding of the central and peripheral control of cardiovascular homeostasis.\r"

  ".U": "89365198\r", 
  ".W": "A structural motif for DNA-binding proteins, the 'leucine zipper', has been proposed for the jun, fos and myc gene products, the yeast transcriptional activator GCN4, and the C/EBP enhancer-binding protein. These proteins all contain a region with four or five leucine residues spaced exactly seven amino acid residues apart whose sequence is consistent with the formation of an amphipathic alpha-helix. It has been proposed that the leucine zipper consists of two interdigitated alpha-helices, one from each monomer, that constitute the dimerization function necessary for high-affinity binding to DNA; an adjacent region of basic residues is thought to be responsible for specific protein-DNA contacts. In support of this model, substitution of the leucine residues within the motif can abolish dimerization and DNA-binding, and a synthetic peptide corresponding to the GCN4 leucine zipper forms alpha-helical dimers. Despite the conserved leucine residues, however, each protein has a distinct dimerization specificity. Specifically, GCN4 homodimer, Jun homodimer and Fos-Jun heterodimer proteins bind to the same DNA site, whereas Fos is unable to form homodimers, bind DNA, or interact with GCN4 (refs 8-14). Here, we alter the dimerization specificity of Fos by precisely replacing its leucine zipper with that from GCN4. This Fos-GCN4 chimaeric protein is able to bind to the target site in the absence of Jun, and can form DNA-binding heterodimers with GCN4 but not with Jun. These results indicate that the leucine zipper is sufficient to confer dimerization specificity and strongly suggest that Fos contacts DNA directly.\r"

  ".W": "Arachidonic acid is released from cellular phospholipid membranes after brain injury associated with vasogenic edema. Intracerebral injection of arachidonic acid results in rapid breakdown of the blood-brain barrier, followed by an increase in brain water and sodium content. This effect is diminished by a 5-lipoxygenase inhibitor, but is unaffected by indomethacin, an inhibitor of cyclooxygenase. Leukocytes are rich in 5-lipoxygenase and mediate posttraumatic extracellular edema in other tissues. We sought to determine whether leukocytes are necessary for arachidonic acid-induced vasogenic edema and whether they are the primary source of 5-lipoxygenase activity. Intracerebral injection of arachidonic acid (10 micrograms) was performed in 21 rats divided into three groups. One hour after injection, the area of Evans blue stain extravasation on the corona slice through the needle tract was quantitated by polar planimetry and taken as a measure of blood-brain barrier permeability. Control animals (n = 7) had a 3.44 +/- 0.19 mm2 area of Evans blue cortical stain. Rats (n = 7) pretreated with a lipoxygenase inhibitor (BW755C) had a significant decrease (P less than 0.05) in the area of Evans blue extravasation was not significantly different from that seen in the control animals. Intracerebral injection of saline or eicosapentaenoic acid showed only minimal staining along the needle tract (0.14 +/- 0.08 mm2). We have confirmed the role of the 5-lipoxygenase products in arachidonic acid-induced vasogenic edema. The primary source of cerebral 5-lipoxygenase activity does not appear to be in leukocytes and is most likely within the brain parenchyma.\r"

Alkaline phosphatase activity was also present in early passage. Two weeks after plating, these cells were attached to the culture dishes and had become like cobblestones in appearance. Then, the addition of tumor necrosis factor at a concentration of 1000 U/ml or more suppressed the DNA synthesis activity of endothelial cells by about 70% and induced morphological changes in the cells, which developed a spindle-like form and showed overlapping of cells, indicating loss of contact inhibition. The administration of interferon-tau induced no change. When a similar experiment was performed using culture supernatants of human glioma cells that had been cultured for a few days, DNA synthesis activity was suppressed by approximately 50% or more in 6 of 12 samples. The suppression of activity, however, was abolished by the addition of anti-tumor necrosis factor antibody in these 6 cases, suggesting the presence of activity resembling that of the tumor necrosis factor in the culture supernatants.\r"

  ".U": "89365500\r", 
  ".W": "We have developed a noninvasive method to determine the flow rates necessary to produce hyperosmotic blood-brain barrier disruption in individual animals. The method uses the intracarotid infusion of 0.9% NaCl at increasing flow rates, while concurrently measuring the amplitude of the somatosensory evoked potential (SSEP). For these studies, dogs were prepared with craniotomies to visualize the duration of cortical blanching. Saline (0.9% NaCl) was infused into the internal carotid artery at flow rates of 0.9 to 2.1 ml/s for periods from 2 to 40 seconds while the SSEP was concurrently measured in six 30-second epochs before, during, and after the infusion. There was a linear relationship between the duration of cortical blanching (from 2 to 30 seconds) and amplitude suppression of the major negative deflection of the SSEP. This relationship allowed us to predict the intracarotid infusion rate necessary to achieve cortical blanching for periods of 20 seconds or more. Subsequent infusion of 1.4 or 1.6 osmolar mannitol at the predicted flow rate resulted in more pronounced suppression of the SSEP than did 0.9% NaCl and produced disruption of the blood-brain barrier as documented by computed tomographic scans with contrast enhancement. Intracarotid infusions of 0.9% NaCl that produced partial blanching (partial replacement of blood in cortical vessels) were associated with paradoxical enhancement of SSEP amplitude, thus providing an additional measure of the adequacy of the infusion rate. This technique provides a reliable method to determine intracarotid infusion rates for hyperosmotic disruption of the blood-brain barrier in individual animals, before the intracarotid infusion of hyperosmolar solutions.\r"

All three are noncovalently associated with the protein, two with the FAD cofactor, and one with the molybdenum cofactor. Results of chemical analysis and 31P NMR spectroscopy indicate that enzyme purified by this method contains no phosphoserine residues. Xanthine oxidase preparations purified by chromatography on calcium phosphate gel in place of DEAE-Sephadex yielded higher phosphate-to-protein ratios, which could be reduced to the expected values by additional purification on a folate affinity column. Highly active, highly purified preparations of glucose oxidase are shown to contain only the two phosphate residues of the FAD cofactor. The covalently bound bridging phosphate reported by others may arise in aged or degraded preparations of the enzyme but appears not to be a constituent of functional glucose oxidase. These results suggest that the presence of covalent phosphate residues in other flavoproteins should be rigorously reevaluated as well.\r"

  ".W": "Blood coagulation factor VIII (fVIII) is a plasma protein that is decreased or absent in hemophilia A. It is isolated as a mixture of heterodimers that contain a variably sized heavy chain and a common light chain. Thrombin catalyzes the activation of fVIII in a reaction that is associated with cleavages in both types of chain. We isolated a serine protease from Bothrops jararacussu snake venom that catalyzes thrombin-like heavy-chain cleavage but not light-chain cleavage in porcine fVIII as judged by NaDodSO4/PAGE and N-terminal sequence analysis. Using a plasma-free assay of the ability of activated fVIII to function as a cofactor in the activation of factor X by factor IXa, we found that fVIII is activated by the venom enzyme. The venom enzyme-activated fVIII was isolated in stable form by cation-exchange HPLC. von Willebrand factor inhibited venom enzyme-activated fVIII but not thrombin-activated fVIII. These results suggest that the binding of fVIII to von Willebrand factor depends on the presence of an intact light chain and that activated fVIII must dissociate from von Willebrand factor to exert its cofactor effect. Thus, proteolytic activation of fVIII-von Willebrand factor complex appears to be differentially regulated by light-chain cleavage to dissociate the complex and heavy-chain cleavage to activate the cofactor function.\r"

We report that cellular proteins react with a labeled RNA probe representing the 5' terminus of a subset of this RNA but not with the complementary strand of this RNA. The proteins form two complexes. Complex 2 was formed by all nuclear extracts tested, whereas complex 1 was invariably formed by proteins present only in nuclear extracts of mock-infected cells. Complex 1 protects a contiguous stretch of 40 nucleotides of the labeled RNA probe from nuclease degradation. Formation of complex 1 was competitively inhibited in a sequence-specific fashion by single-stranded RNA and DNA and by double-stranded RNA and DNA. The protein(s) forming complex 1 is, thus, quite distinct from known nucleic acid-binding proteins in that they recognize a specific nucleotide sequence, irrespective of the nature (single- and double-stranded RNA and DNA) of the nucleic acid. We conclude the following: (i) the proteins forming complex 1 and 2 are probably different, (ii) complex 1 is neither required throughout infection for viral replication nor able to hinder viral replication in cells in culture, and (iii) cells susceptible to infection encode one or more proteins that recognize specific sequences in single-stranded nucleic acids; either these proteins impart a compatible conformation on single-stranded nucleic acids with the conformation of the same strand in the double-stranded nucleic acid, or these proteins confer a specific, distinct conformation to both single-stranded and double-stranded nucleic acids.\r"

Antiserum raised against the fusion protein immunoprecipitated a 56-kDa protein from human B lymphocytes. Incubation of the immunoprecipitate with [gamma-32P]ATP resulted in the phosphorylation of this protein at tyrosine residues. Immunohistological and immunoblotting analyses showed that the lyn gene product was expressed in lymphatic tissues (spleen and tonsil) and in adult lung, which contains many macrophages. Furthermore, both the transcripts and the protein products of the lyn gene accumulated in macrophages/monocytes, platelets, and B lymphocytes but were not expressed appreciably in granulocytes, erythrocytes, or T lymphocytes, suggesting that lyn gene products function primarily in certain differentiated cells of lymphoid and myeloid lineages.\r"

  ".W": "The polarity of fucoid eggs is fixed either when tip growth starts or a bit earlier. A steady flow of calcium ions into the incipient tip is thought to establish a high calcium zone that is needed for its localization and formation. To test this hypothesis, we have injected seven different 1,2-bis(o-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid (BAPTA)-type calcium buffers into Pelvetia eggs many hours before tip growth normally starts. Critical final cell concentrations of each buffer prove to block outgrowth (as well as cell division) for up to 2 weeks. This critical inhibitory concentration is lowest for two buffers with dissociation constants or Kd values of 4-5 x 10(-6) M and increases steadily as the buffers' Kd values shift either below or above this optimal value to ones as low as 4 x 10(-7) M or as high as 9.4 x 10(-5) M. To analyze these results, we have derived an equation (based on the concept of facilitated diffusion) for the effects of diffusable calcium buffers on steady-state calcium gradients. The data fit this equation quite well if it is assumed that cytosolic free calcium at the incipient tip is normally kept at about 7 microM and, thus, far above the general cytosolic level.\r"

  ".U": "89367309\r", 
  ".W": "Active transport across the vacuolar components of the eukaryotic endomembrane system is energized by a specific vacuolar H+-ATPase. The amino acid sequences of the 70- and 60-kDa subunits of the vacuolar H+-ATPase are approximately equal to 25% identical to the beta and alpha subunits, respectively, of the eubacterial-type F0F1-ATPases. We now report that the same vacuolar H+-ATPase subunits are approximately equal to 50% identical to the alpha and beta subunits, respectively, of the sulfur-metabolizing Sulfolobus acidocaldarius, an archaebacterium (Archaeobacterium). Moreover, the homologue of an 88-amino acid stretch near the amino-terminal end of the 70-kDa subunit is absent from the F0F1-ATPase beta subunit but is present in the alpha subunit of Sulfolobus. Since the two types of subunits (alpha and beta subunits; 60- and 70-kDa subunits) are homologous to each other, they must have arisen by a gene duplication that occurred prior to the last common ancestor of the eubacteria, eukaryotes, and Sulfolobus. Thus, the phylogenetic tree of the subunits can be rooted at the site where the gene duplication occurred. The inferred evolutionary tree contains two main branches: a eubacterial branch and an eocyte branch that gave rise to Sulfolobus and the eukaryotic host cell. The implication is that the vacuolar H+-ATPase of eukaryotes arose by the internalization of the plasma membrane H+-ATPase of an archaebacterial-like ancestral cell.\r"

We have studied mice with a radiation-induced chromosomal deletion involving the albino locus (c) on chromosome 7 and found that Nmo-1 mRNA levels and the rate of Nmo-1 gene transcription are markedly increased (greater than 100-fold and greater than 12-fold, respectively) in the untreated c14CoS/c14CoS deletion homozygote, compared with the untreated Cch/Cch wild-type and the Cch/C14CoS heterozygote. These data suggest that a gene located on chromosome 7 encodes a trans-acting regulatory factor that might be a negative effector of the Nmo-1 gene, which we show here is located on chromosome 8 approximately 1.4 centimorgans (about 1000 kilobase pairs) from the Es-2 gene. Conversely, there are no detectable basal levels of cytochrome P1450 (Cyp1a1 gene) or cytochrome P3450 (Cyp1a2 gene) mRNA, indicating that the regulation of basal expression of the Cyp1a1 and Cyp1a2 genes is distinct from that of the Nmo-1 gene. Moreover, the Cyp1a1 and Cyp1a2 genes and the Nmo-1 gene are induced by tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin in the cch/cch, cch/c14CoS, and c14CoS/c14CoS mice. The mechanism of tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin inducibility of the Cyp1a1, Cyp1a2, and Nmo-1 genes is, therefore, independent of the mechanism of Nmo-1 gene activation in untreated c14CoS/c14CoS mice.\r"

The brown gene, required for pteridine pigment in the eye, is unusual in that expression of the unrearranged homolog also is affected. This dominant effect can be very strong, as inactivation is detectable when as many as three trans copies of the gene are present. We show that pteridine reductions coincide with similar reductions in the accumulation of brown mRNA. The dominant effect is suppressed by certain altered structural configurations of the brown region, suggesting that somatic pairing is involved in the phenomenon. We propose that direct transmission of the altered chromatin structure characteristic of position-effect variegation (heterochromatinization) occurs between paired homologs in the region of the brown locus.\r"

The gene segments of this minilocus are rearranged in a large proportion of cells in thymus and spleen but not in nonlymphoid tissue. Some 4% of the B lymphocytes synthesize human mu chains resulting in a serum titer of about 50 micrograms of transgenic IgM antibody per ml. Hybridomas were established from the transgenic mice that stably secreted several micrograms of antibodies containing human mu heavy chains per milliliter.\r"

Deletion and substitution mutagenesis of the octamer sequence greatly reduced the activity of the DR alpha promoter in both in vivo and in vitro cell-free transcription systems of B-cell origin. Conversely, these mutations did not affect promoter activity in several non-B-cell lines that express the DR alpha gene. Removal of octamer-binding proteins by in vivo titration with an octamer-containing competitor plasmid reduced DR alpha promoter activity in B-lymphoblastoid cells. These results suggest that a protein-octamer interaction, most likely involving the B-cell-specific octamer binding protein (OTF-2), is required for DR alpha promoter function in B-lymphoblastoid cells but not in non-B cells.\r"

In addition, certain VH gene segments are repeatedly rearranged, suggesting that the DNA sequence or structure surrounding these segments may increase the probability of rearrangement. To determine whether there is similar based rearrangement of kappa variable (V kappa) gene segments, 25 rearrangements were sequenced from murine fetal and neonatal B-cell hybridomas and from subclones of a pre-B cell line that rearranged V kappa genes during in vitro culture. Four gene segments were isolated twice and one gene segment was isolated three times, suggesting that the process that targets individual variable gene segments for repeated rearrangement operates on both the VH and V kappa loci. Based on a current map of the V kappa locus, the rearranged gene segments belong to nine families that are dispersed throughout the locus. Thus, in these cell types, V kappa rearrangements use germ-line gene segments located across the entire locus, whereas the corresponding VH rearrangements use gene segments proximal to the JH gene segments. Heterogeneity of V kappa rearrangements would add diversity to the biased pool of VH rearrangements, producing a broad repertoire of antibodies early in development.\r"

  ".U": "89367328\r", 
  ".W": "The susceptibility of purified protein kinase C to oxidative inactivation by H2O2 was found to be increased by Ca2+ either alone at a high (5 mM) concentration or at a low (approximately 50 microM) concentration along with phosphatidylserine and diacylglycerol and by tumor-promoting phorbol esters even in the absence of Ca2+. This suggested that the membrane-bound and/or catalytically active form of protein kinase C is relatively more susceptible to oxidative inactivation. Although both the regulatory and catalytic domains of protein kinase C were susceptible to oxidative inactivation, a selective modification of the regulatory domain was obtained under mild oxidative conditions by protecting the catalytic site with ATP/Mg2+. Under these conditions there was a loss of both phorbol ester binding and Ca2+/phospholipid-stimulated kinase activity. However, this modified form of enzyme exhibited an increase in Ca2+/phospholipid-independent kinase activity. This suggests that selective oxidative modification of the regulatory domain may negate the requirement for Ca2+ and lipids for activation. Treatment of intact C6 glioma or B16 melanoma cells with H2O2 resulted in a time- and temperature-dependent decrease in Ca2+/phospholipid-dependent protein kinase C activity along with a concomitant transient increase in an oxidatively modified isoform of protein kinase C that exhibited activity in the absence of Ca2+ and phospholipids. Since protein kinase C can initially be activated by mild oxidative modification and subsequently inactivated by further oxidation, this dual activation-inactivation of protein kinase C in response to H2O2 suggests an effective on/off signal mechanism to influence cellular events.\r"

  ".W": "Synergy resulting from the combination of ciprofloxacin and an antipseudomonal penicillin has been reported for 20%-50% of isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. A similar effect has also been reported for the combination of ciprofloxacin and fosfomycin. In contrast, the combination of quinolones and aminoglycosides rarely showed synergy when tested against P. aeruginosa. Most studies have shown that the combination of beta-lactams or aminoglycosides with quinolones is indifferent against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella species, Enterobacter species, Citrobacter species, and Serratia species. The combination of ciprofloxacin and chloramphenicol can be antagonistic against E. coli. In general, the combination of quinolone antibiotics with other drugs tested against staphylococci, enterococci, and anaerobic species has shown indifference. The neutropenic mouse model of infection has demonstrated the synergistic effect of ciprofloxacin plus antipseudomonal penicillins; the combination of ciprofloxacin and rifampin has been superior to single agents in experimental Staphylococcus aureus osteomyelitis. Ciprofloxacin has been the quinolone studied most thoroughly, and few data are available about the combination of other quinolones with other antimicrobial agents. Overall, the occurrence of synergy when quinolones are combined with other antimicrobial agents is infrequent, and clinical studies that demonstrate the clinical relevance of data from in vitro and animal models of infection are not available. However, data from in vitro and animal model studies indicate that the combination of a quinolone with other antimicrobial agents rarely results in antagonism.\r"

The c-raf proto-oncogene and three members of the c-ras gene family were expressed in mitotically active stem cells, throughout the prophase of meiosis and to varying extents in post-meiotic cell types. In contrast, the nuclear proto-oncogenes c-fos, c-jun, and c-myc were specifically expressed at high levels in type B spermatogonia. High levels of c-myc and c-jun RNAs were also detected in spermatocytes early in the prophase of meiosis. The type B spermatogonia represent the last mitotic cell division before entry into meiotic prophase; therefore, these nuclear proto-oncogenes may be involved in altering programs of gene expression at this developmental transition.\r"

Genetic and biochemical studies confirmed that this gene encodes an ecdysteroid UDP-glucosyl transferase (egt). This enzyme catalyzes the transfer of glucose from UDP-glucose to ecdysteroids, which are insect molting hormones. Expression of the egt gene allowed the virus to interfere with normal insect development so that molting was blocked in infected larvae of fall armyworm (Spodoptera frugiperda).\r"

Instead of admission to the coronary care unit, they were placed on observation status (Chest Pain Evaluation Unit) for a period up to 20 hours (average 11.1 hours). Using the results of the cardiac profile, 327 were able to be sent home. Of the 168 patients admitted, only 30 (18%) had subsequent enzyme evidence of myocardial necrosis.

Abscesses yielded Enterococcus faecalis in pure culture. Antimicrobials were delivered by precisely controlled continuous intravenous infusion. After five days of therapy, ampicillin alone or in combination with gentamicin reduced residual bacterial titers from 7.93 +/- 1.05 (untreated) to 3.51 +/- 1.07 and 3.52 +/- 0.81 log10 colony forming units per gram, respectively. Both the clindamycin and gentamicin combination (6.49 +/- 1.33) and metronidazole and gentamicin combination (6.79 +/- 0.90) significantly suppressed the growth of enterococci (p less than 0.01). Combined clindamycin and aztreonam was ineffective, as were any of the agents used alone (except ampicillin). These results may explain, in part, the clinical efficacy of certain drug combinations against the enterococcal component of polymicrobial abscesses despite the apparent lack of in vitro activity of individual agents.\r"

To examine this hypothesis, we have measured oxygen and carbon dioxide tensions (PO2, PCO2) in four patients and pressure within the bullae in three patients immediately before surgery. During spontaneous tidal respiration PO2 in the bulla was higher than arterial PO2 but did not rise as fast during the breathing of oxygen. The intra-bulla pressure during inspiration was negative (-5.5 to -19 cm H2O) and similar to pleural pressure in phase and degree. During intermittent positive pressure ventilation in two patients airway pressures were transmitted to the bulla with the development of a positive end expiratory pressure within the bulla. Histological examination of the walls of the bullae in the four patients and adjacent lung tissue in an additional patient failed to identify any valvular mechanism. The available information suggests that bullae develop after retraction and collapse of surrounding lung away from a region of weakness.\r"

After rubbing off the endothelium, the relaxations induced by both agents were significantly attenuated. Indomethacin (a cyclooxygenase inhibitor) and AA861 (a specific inhibitor of 5-lipoxygenase) did not but SKF525A (an inhibitor of cytochrome P450-dependent monooxygenase) did significantly inhibit the acetylcholine-induced relaxation in human basilar arteries. On the other hand, AA861 inhibited while neither indomethacin nor SKF525A had any effect on the A23187-induced relaxation. Our results suggest that different mechanisms may be involved in acetylcholine and A23187-induced relaxations in human basilar arteries.\r"

  ".W": "We induced brain edema in 72 rats by injecting 5 microliters of 3.0% wt:vol polyvinyl acetate into the left internal carotid artery, producing permanent embolization in the left cerebral hemisphere, which developed ipsilateral brain edema reproducibly. Edema was assessed 24 hours after embolization by determining the brain water content and the sodium and potassium concentrations. In this model, the free radical scavenger MCI-186 at 1.0 and 3.0 mg/kg i.v. prevented brain edema in a dose-dependent manner. At 3.0 mg/kg i.v., MCI-186 significantly reduced water content by 1.5% and improved the sodium-potassium balance to within the normal range in the embolized left hemisphere. Dexamethasone at 1.0 mg/kg i.v. did but at 3.0 mg/kg i.v. did not significantly inhibit the development of brain edema. Indomethacin at 4.0 mg/kg i.p. had no effect on brain edema. We suggest that the cyclooxygenase metabolites of arachidonic acid liberated from neuronal cell membrane phospholipids are not likely to be involved in the pathogenesis of permanent brain edema induced by polyvinyl acetate. Our results suggest that MCI-186 attenuates brain edema by suppressing the production of lipoxygenase metabolites, including free radicals or lipid peroxides, and that it may prove valuable for the treatment of brain edema associated with cerebral ischemia.\r"

  ".W": "We hypothesize that enhanced activity of capillary Na,K-ATPase promotes Na+ influx into the brain and causes early edema formation in focal cerebral ischemia. The pharmacologic suppression of brain capillary Na,K-ATPase as a means to ameliorate edema formation was examined using the middle cerebral artery occlusion model in 36 cats. With the help of a catheter inserted into the middle cerebral artery, the ischemic brain area was directly perfused with 10(-5) M ouabain. Perfusion was maintained as intermittent 15-second pulse injections given every 5 (n = 6) or 2 (n = 6) minutes. By this method, the naturally occurring circulatory conditions during ischemia were not altered. Four hours after ischemia, the cortical specific gravity at each of six locations over the ischemic area was compared with the corresponding ischemic blood flow measured by the H2 clearance technique. The results show that ouabain perfused every 2 minutes significantly ameliorated edema formation compared with six control cats perfused with Krebs-Ringer solution. In a separate series of experiments, the Na+ flux across the blood-brain barrier was studied by injecting 22NaCl together with an intravascular reference (cobalt-57-labeled microspheres 15 microns in diameter) into the ischemic area. The brain uptake index of 22Na was markedly increased in the ischemic cortex of six control cats; ouabain treatment in six cats suppressed the increase of Na+ influx. The results support our hypothesis that brain capillary Na,K-ATPase activity increases during early focal ischemia, leading to enhanced Na+ together with H2O flux across the blood-brain barrier.\r"

In all, 65 filtrations were performed. An automated microprocessor-controlled hydraulic system designed for use with cellulose acetate fiber filters was employed to prepare filtered RBCs before release for transfusion. Studies were also carried out on polyester fiber filters, which are designed to be used in-line during transfusion. Residual WBCs were below the accurate counting range of Coulter counters and of conventional manual chamber counts. An isosmotic ammonium chloride RBC lysis method, plus a modified chamber counting technique, permitted a 270-fold increase over the number of WBCs counted by the conventional manual method. For the polyester fiber-filtered products, residual WBCs per unit were not affected by speed of filtration, prior length of storage, or mechanical tapping during filtration. The effectiveness of WBC removal (mean 99.7%), total residual WBCs (means, 4.8 and 5.5 x 10(6], and RBC recovery (mean, 93%) was the same for both filters. The majority of residual WBCs were lymphocytes. WBC removal and RBC recovery were strikingly superior to results reported with nonfiltration methods.\r"

Platelets in CLX bags were inoculated with 10(1), 10(2), and 10(3) organisms and 10(2) organisms were introduced into PL-732 bags. Test organisms were inoculated into trypticase soy broth as a control. All four bacteria grew rapidly in trypticase soy broth, reaching 10(9) organisms per mL within 48 hours. In both CLX and PL-732 bags, the growth pattern of gram-positive organisms was generally logarithmic during the first few days of storage. A concentration of 10(8) organisms per mL was present by Day 3 or 4, after which further proliferation was inhibited by the high density of bacteria in the platelets. In PL-732 bags, the proliferation of gram-negative organisms followed a pattern similar to that of the gram-positive bacteria. However, gram-negative organisms grew less well in CLX bags.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The coagulation properties of FFP units that were refrozen and then rethawed were therefore studied. Fifty-eight units of plasma were studied, with each experimental unit of FFP paired with an identical control unit. Experimental units were frozen, stored at -65 degrees C, thawed, stored at 1 to 6 degrees C for various periods of time up to 24 hours, and then refrozen, stored at -65 degrees C, rethawed, and stored again in the refrigerator for up to 24 hours. Control units were frozen once at the time the experimental units were first frozen and thawed once at the time of the second thaw of the experimental units. Aliquots of plasma were sampled periodically and were later batch-tested for prothrombin time (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), and factor V and VIII:C activity. The results of coagulation testing of the twice-frozen plasmas were always within the normal range. There was a slight but statistically valid prolongation of the PT and aPTT and a decrease in the factor V and VIII:C levels for twice-frozen plasma compared with control plasma. The greatest decline occurred in the level of factor VIII:C. The measured deterioration in coagulation of twice-frozen FFP is unlikely to be of clinical importance. Refreezing FFP may eventually prove useful for rare donor, autologous, and massive transfusion programs.\r"

Regeneration of 2,3 diphosphoglycerate (2,3 DPG) and adenine nucleotides of stored red cells was dependent on the pH of the incubation medium and the incubation time. In red cells stored for 3 and 5 weeks, the optimal pH and incubation time for regeneration of 2,3 DPG and adenine nucleotides were 5.8 and 90 minutes and 6.1 and 60 minutes, respectively. During the incubation of red cells with PEP, methemoglobin was formed; it increased when the medium pH was below 6.0 and the incubation time exceeded 60 minutes. We conclude that incubation at a medium pH of 6.1 for 60 minutes is optimal for the rejuvenation of stored red cells with PEP. Under such incubation conditions, the concentrations of 2,3 DPG and adenine nucleotides in red cells stored for 5 weeks were restored to normal without methemoglobin formation.\r"

In eight of nine steps, a complete viral clearance was achieved. Estimation of the cumulative infectivity reduction due to these nine steps is in the following range: greater than 12 to 16 log10 HIV-1 and greater than 17 to 19 log10 HIV-2 for Gamma 16, greater than 9 to 13 log10 HIV-1 and greater than 13 to 15 log10 HIV-2 for Veinoglobuline, and greater than 19.7 log10 HIV-1 and greater than 24 log10 HIV-2 for albumin. As many other purification steps were not included in this study, the real infectivity reduction capacity for the whole process probably exceeds these values. Nevertheless, the levels of inactivation measured clearly document a rigorous fractionation process that has a high assurance of killing or eliminating all contaminating virus.\r"

  ".W": "The enthesopathy (bone proliferation at sites of ligament, tendon, joint capsule, and interosseous membrane attachment) that may be present in adults who have longstanding hypophosphatemic osteomalacia, the most common type of osteomalacia, has received little attention in the radiologic literature. These proliferative enthetic changes may be associated with various musculoskeletal symptoms. The spectrum of proliferative enthesopathic changes, involving the axial and appendicular skeleton, is described in six patients 18-63 years old. Proliferative changes at the attachment of the annulus fibrosus were present in six of six patients and ranged in extent from tiny hyperostoses at a few levels to thin marginal symmetric syndesmophytes involving the entire lumbosacral spine and mimicking spondylitis. Thoracic spinal syndesmophytes were present in four patients and cervical hyperostoses of various magnitudes were present in three patients. Changes in the sacroiliac joints were present in four of six patients and varied from mild widening to symmetric intraarticular and anterior paraarticular bony bridging. Proliferative enthesopathy involving the pelvis and proximal femora was present in six of six patients. Appendicular changes included accessory ossicles within the wrist and hands and bony proliferation of the distal radius and metacarpal heads. These were noted in four patients. Ossification of the interosseous membrane of the forearms or the lower extremities was present in six patients and paraarticular bony proliferation about the elbows was noted in four patients. It is apparent that the severity of the enthesopathy that occurs may vary, and that hypophosphatemic osteomalacia should be recognized as a cause of enthesopathy even if other radiographic findings of osteomalacia may not be present on available radiographs.\r"

Three hours after admission, the mean concentration of ANP was significantly lower than that at the time of admission. Thereafter it rose steadily until 15 hours after admission. ANP concentrations measured in each patient at the time of admission and the individual mean ANP concentrations during the first 48 hours after admission correlated weakly but significantly with the size of the infarct and the left ventricular function. Neither the site of the infarct, the occurrence of reperfusion, nor the number of coronary vessels affected influenced the ANP concentration. In 24 patients in whom cardiac catheterization was performed, no relationship between ANP concentrations and left ventricular pressures was observed. Determination of ANP concentrations seems to be of little value in assessing cardiac function after acute myocardial infarction.\r"

Plasma levels of alpha-hANF-like immunoreactivity (LI) and pro-hANF (1-30)-Ll in patients with severe hypertension who were receiving a normal sodium diet were 56 +/- 5 pg/ml and 2710 +/- 118 pg/ml, respectively; these levels were significantly higher than control values. Levels of these peptides in patients with mild hypertension were similar to those of control subjects. Mean blood pressure correlated closely with alpha-hANF-Ll levels (r = 0.56, p less than 0.001) and pro-hANF (1-30)-Ll levels (r = 0.66, p less than 0.001) in patients receiving a normal sodium diet. Plasma alpha-hANF-Ll and pro-hANF (1-30)-Ll levels were significantly decreased 3 days in mild hypertension and 7 days in severe hypertension after initiation of a low-sodium diet with a decrease in blood pressure as compared to the initial values. These results suggest that plasma N-terminal fragment levels are elevated in proportion to the degree of hypertension, and they can be reduced by means of effective antihypertensive treatment.\r"

The average cardiac index before infusion was 1.8 L/min/m2. Severe sodium and water retention was confirmed by high levels of total body water and extracellular liquid, whereas renal blood flow and glomerular filtration rate were reduced. Plasma concentration of ANP, norepinephrine, cortisol, and growth hormone were significantly increased before infusion. The infusion had no significant hemodynamic effect. After 2 hours urine volume had increased significantly from 51 to 76 ml/hr, urinary concentration of sodium from 72 to 90 mmol/L, and sodium excretion from 4.5 to 8.2 mmol/hr. The infusion was accompanied by a significant increase in plasma ir-ANP from 193 to 980 pg/ml. There were no significant effects on the plasma concentrations of norepinephrine, epinephrine, aldosterone, vasopressin, cortisol, growth hormone, or prolactin and no significant change in plasma renin activity. After 2 hours of infusion one patient had a severe sinus tachycardia and another had a sinus bradycardia. Both arrhythmias disappeared without harmful effects soon after the infusion was stopped.\r"

On average, ST segment depression developed at a significantly higher heart rate and rate-pressure product when the standard modified Bruce protocol was preceded by a warm-up period (113 +/- 13 vs 119 +/- 15 beats/min and 18,813 +/- 3682 vs 20,357 +/- 4227 beats/min X mm Hg, respectively; p less than 0.05 and less than 0.01). No significant changes were observed when the exercise was started abruptly. Analysis of results in individual patients showed that changes in rate-pressure product at 1 mm ST segment depression greater than or equal to 2000 beats/min X mm Hg developed with different types of exercise in 11 patients (group I), whereas in 22 patients little or no change occurred (group II). All patients also underwent exercise testing before and after 0.5 mg of sublingual nitroglycerin; improvement induced by nitroglycerin was significantly greater in group I than in group II (22 +/- 8 vs 8 +/- 9 beats/min and 4896 +/- 1998 vs 1064 +/- 2145 beats/min X mm Hg; p less than 0.01). Furthermore, isometric handgrip exercise carried out during angiography resulted in significant reduction of luminal diameter at the site of the stenosis of group I (1.22 +/- 0.39 vs 0.99 +/- 0.35 mm; p less than 0.01) but not in group II (1.12 +/- 0.22 vs 1.16 +/- 0.3 mm, p = NS).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

A single-bolus dose would simplify the therapeutic regimen. Therefore, 20 patients with symptom duration of 125 +/- 58 minutes were given a single bolus of 50 mg of rt-PA over 2 minutes. Coronary angiography 60 minutes after the rt-PA bolus revealed a patent infarct-related artery in 15 of 20 patients (patency rate 75%, 95% confidence limits 51 to 91%). In the remaining patients, reperfusion was achieved by coronary angioplasty and intracoronary fibrinolysis; in 2 patients coronary artery bypass grafting was necessary. Control angiograms at 24 hours showed reocclusions in 4 of 18 patients. One woman died due to an intracranial hemorrhage 48 hours after the rt-PA bolus injection. Circulating fibrinogen decreased from 2.7 +/- 0.5 to 1.5 +/- 0.9 g/liter after 2 to 4 hours and reached the initial value within 24 hours. Pharmacokinetic parameters were obtained in 7 patients by measuring rt-PA antigen levels in multiple plasma samples. Mean peak rt-PA concentration was 9.8 +/- 3.6 micrograms/ml, total plasma clearance 476 +/- 148 ml/min and dominant half-life 4.8 +/- 1.0 minutes. Thus, rt-PA administered as a 50-mg single bolus appears to provide similar patency rates and shows similar kinetics in comparison with the conventional infusion regimen. Assessment of the incidence of bleeding complications requires further studies.\r"

Forty-nine patients were studied; 33 of them had mitral stenosis and 16 had aortic stenosis. The mean age was 52 +/- 17 years. During dilations pressures were monitored from the ascending aorta and left atrium. Plasma levels of ANF, vasopressin and renin were serially determined at baseline, after diagnostic procedures, within 15 to 30 seconds after the first 2 occlusive dilations, and 1 and 7 hours later. There were no significant changes in plasma renin throughout the study stages. ANF and vasopressin significantly increased after the dilations. These hormonal changes were related to the significant hemodynamic changes observed during intracardiac occlusion. The left atrial pressure correlated directly and significantly (r = 0.54, p less than 0.001) with plasma ANF levels throughout the conditions. On the other hand, the plasma vasopressin also correlated (r = 0.76, p less than 0.001) with systemic pressure in an exponential fashion. These findings show that abrupt releases of ANF and vasopressin occur immediately after intracardiac occlusive periods as a response to the acute and transient hemodynamic changes observed.\r"

When survivors were killed no differences were found in body, carcass, or organ weights among the three groups. Serum Fe and percent Fe-binding sites occupied were significantly lower in the None group although total Fe-binding capacity was similar. Mortality was not statistically different (p = 0.29): 18/32 in the None group (56%), 14/24 in the Low group (58%), and 25/34 in the High group (73%). We conclude that although deprivation of dietary sources of Fe does affect available circulating Fe, diet-induced hypoferremia does not alter mortality rates from bacterial peritonitis in the guinea pig.\r"

Although loss of lean tissue may be detrimental to the host, a protective effect is conveyed as cardiac demands are reduced by lower whole-body oxygen consumption (VO2) and circulating fluid volume. The aim of this study was to determine if continuous nasoenteric feeding could promote an anabolic state with increments in lean tissue in moderate-severe CHF patients without adversely effecting cardiac performance. Undernourished CHF patients on a metabolic ward were fed a formula diet infused intragastrically for 2 wk. The energy infusion rate was maintained at 1.4-1.8 X measured resting metabolic rate. During the infusion period, body weight, elemental balances, VO2, and cardiac function (echocardiography) were monitored. Results showed a loss in weight and extracellular fluid, gain in lean body mass (eg, + delta N and delta K), unaltered VO2, and unchanged cardiac function. Cardiac cachexia is therefore safely and effectively manageable by maintenance or repletional levels of nasoenteric feeding.\r"

A similar assay has been developed for urinary-type plasminogen activator (U-PA), also known as urokinase (UK), achieving a sensitivity range of approximately 5-500 X 10(-1) IU/L. The direct sensitive t-PA assay has been demonstrated to be a quantitative alternative to the traditional semiquantitative euglobulin clot lysis time (ECLT) assay, with correlation coefficients of 0.967 and 0.914, depending on the laboratory where the ECLT was carried out. This assay has the added advantages of avoiding loss of t-PA or UK during the formation of the euglobulin fraction and of calibration in terms of International Standards for both t-PA and UK. With both these assays, it has been demonstrated that the enhanced fibrinolytic activity observed after exercise results from increased levels of t-PA while the level of UK in plasma remains unaltered. Free t-PA (10-60 IU/L) has been demonstrated in resting plasma, whereas the level of free UK activity was 50-100 IU/L. Venous occlusion of matched groups of subjects with and without deep venous thrombosis (DVT) showed a wide variation of response in t-PA levels in each group and no change in UK levels. There was no difference between the DVT and non-DVT groups, and this suggests that the notion of the \"nonresponder\" being more prone to thrombosis needs to be reexamined.\r"

Eosinophiluria was seen in all cases of urinary schistosomiasis (median 0.73 [73%] of urinary white blood cells [WBCs]); 13 (65%) of those with acute glomerulonephritis (median 0.03 [3%] of urinary WBCs); and 2 (14%) patients with urinary stones (0.01 [1%] and 0.05 [5%] of urinary WBCs). Other features included the presence of ova and activated macrophages and giant cells in urinary schistosomiasis, an increased number of mononuclear cells and stained cellular casts in acute glomerulonephritis, and an increased number of neutrophils in urinary stones. In schistosomiasis, urine differential leukocyte counts were unrelated to those of the blood. Moreover, urine eosinophil percentages were always higher than those in the blood. Thus, in urinary schistosomiasis, eosinophiluria could be explained by exudation, sloughing of granulomata, as well as bleeding from the urinary tract surface. Electron microscopic examination confirmed that most of the leukocytes were eosinophils. Some of these were adherent and degranulating over ova with variable miracidial damage. Urine eosinophil and egg counts were not correlated to each other. Staining urine deposit smears, with the use of Hansel's stain, is useful in the investigation of hematuria. Heavy eosinophiluria and few mononuclear cells favor the diagnosis of urinary schistosomiasis rather than acute glomerulonephritis or urinary stones. These results diminish the value of eosinophiluria as corroborative evidence of drug-induced interstitial nephritis in areas of endemic urinary schistosomiasis.\r"

These organisms were pale pink with Kinyoun stain, and occasionally one of their poles was periodic acid-Schiff positive. Sporoblasts and spores contained in parasitophorous vacuoles were revealed by electron microscopic examination. These spores were mononucleated, without mitochondria, and had a polar filament with four or five coils. They were identified as Encephalitozoon cuniculi. Peritonitis resulting from this parasite has not been reported previously, however, it should be suspected among rare infections resulting from unusual parasites in patients with AIDS.\r"

Histologically, the tumor is composed of carcinoid-like cells admixed with varying numbers of ganglion cells in a substratum of neuroid spindle cells. The epithelioid cells contain argyrophilic cytoplasmic granules confirmed by electron microscopy to be dense core membrane-bound secretory granules. Review of the literature suggests the tumor described is typical both clinically and pathologically of gangliocytic paraganglioma of the duodenum, except for its unprecedented occurrence in association with a duodenal diverticulum.\r"

  ".W": "PURPOSE: Recombinant interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) is a potent and selective inhibitor of collagen production by dermal fibroblasts in vitro and has numerous immunoregulatory activities. We assessed the effects of recombinant IFN-gamma in the treatment of patients with systemic sclerosis. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Ten patients entered the study and nine completed the six-month study period. Recombinant IFN-gamma was administered once daily for seven days per week by intramuscular injections: 10 micrograms/day for 10 days, 25 micrograms/day for 10 days, 50 micrograms/day for 10 days, and 100 micrograms/day for the next five months. RESULTS: After the six-month treatment period, a significant improvement, as compared with base-line values, was observed in total skin score, maximal oral opening, range of motion of wrists and elbows, grip strength, functional index, dysphagia, and creatinine clearance. No serious side effects were observed; however, a significant decrease in white blood cell counts and in peripheral blood lymphocytes was noted. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that recombinant IFN-gamma may be beneficial in the treatment of patients with systemic sclerosis.\r"

Although they varied in both size and sophistication, the studies all found that when patients and their families were carefully screened, outpatient therapy was a cost-effective, safe method of administering intravenous antibiotics. The methods used to compare the costs of inpatient and outpatient intravenous antibiotic therapy varied widely. Only direct costs were included in the early comparisons of inpatient and outpatient therapy, whereas the more recent studies included both direct and indirect costs and benefits. All studies found cost savings in the outpatient setting. Unfortunately, very few elderly patients were included because of a Medicare requirement that intravenous antibiotic therapy be administered or supervised by a physician. However, beginning in 1990, the Medicare Catastrophic Coverage Act of 1988 will cover intravenous drugs administered at home. Thus, it will be possible to study applicability of this therapy for the elderly population.\r"

IFN-gamma induced increased binding of anti-HLA-DP mAb by 24 hours and a mild-to-moderate accumulation of mononuclear cells. TNF induced increased binding of anti-endothelial leukocyte adhesion molecule (ELAM)-1 mAb by 2 hours that was associated with polymorphonuclear leukocyte accumulation, and increased binding of anti-intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1 mAb by 9 hours that was associated with the onset of progressive mononuclear leukocyte accumulation. TNF also caused endothelial cell hypertrophy and increased vascular permeability. The combination of IFN-gamma and TNF induced a set of changes that qualitatively resemble those of a delayed hypersensitivity reaction to simian agent 8 envelope antigen. These findings are consistent with the concept that cytokine-activated endothelium plays an important role in the adhesion and subsequent extravasation of leukocytes during immune inflammation.\r"

  ".U": "89371930\r", 
  ".W": "It was recently shown that the human atherosclerotic plaque contains significant amounts of T lymphocytes, and also that smooth muscle cells in these plaques express class II MHC (Ia) antigens. These antigens are not normally present on smooth muscle cells but are inducible by interferon-gamma, a secretory product of activated T cells. Therefore, T cell activation in the plaque was analyzed by immunofluorescent detection of activation markers on T cells isolated from the plaques and in cryostat sections of carotid endarterectomy specimens. Of cells isolated from the plaque, 5% exhibited the E rosettes characteristic of T cells. One third of these cells expressed HLA-DR and VLA-1 (very late activation antigen-1), which in T cells are synthesized only in the activated state. T cells were also identified in sections using immunofluorescent detection of the T cell-specific surface protein, CD3 (Leu-4), with rhodamine labeled second-step antibodies. The frequency of activated T cells was then determined by staining the same, or serial, sections with antibodies to HLA-DR or to the interleukin-2 receptor, followed by biotin-avidin-FITC detection. Of the T cells in the plaque, 34% and 6%, respectively, expressed these cell surface proteins. Taken together, these results indicated that a substantial proportion of the T cells in atherosclerotic plaque are in an activated state. The activation pattern, with a high frequency of HLA-DR and VLA-1 expression and a much lower frequency of interleukin-2 receptor expression, was similar to that reported to occur in chronic inflammatory conditions. Interferon-gamma could be detected in and around some of the lymphocytes, suggesting that paracrine secretion of this lymphokine may occur in the plaque. T cells may be activated locally, presumably by antigen(s) presented in the context of class II MHC expressing smooth muscle cells and/or macrophages, in the atherosclerotic lesion. Such activated T cells may in turn modulate the functions of other cells in the plaque.\r"

Histamine and its metabolic derivatives increase the catalytic activity of xanthine oxidase (but not xanthine dehydrogenase) in rat plasma and in rat pulmonary artery endothelial cells. In thermally injured rats levels of plasma histamine and xanthine oxidase rise in parallel, in association with increases in uric acid. Burn edema is greatly attenuated by treatment of rats with the mast cell stabilizer, cromolyn, by complement depletion and by treatment with the H2 receptor antagonist, cimetidine, but is unaffected by neutrophil depletion. These studies suggest the following pathogenesis of burn edema: thermal trauma causes complement activation with anaphylatoxin release and mast cell secretion of histamine, leading to enhancement of xanthine oxidase activity and increased production of oxygen radicals which damage endothelial cells.\r"

Sections were compared with specimens from ten individuals without goiters from the same endemic area, with specimens from ten sporadic nontoxic goiter patients, and with specimens from an area with sufficient iodine supply from nine healthy subjects. Cells were characterized using monoclonal antibodies to the CR3 receptor (CD11b) and the p150/95 antigen (CD11c) present on macrophages, to HLA-DR, to antigen presenting cells (RFD1), to T helper (CD4) and to T suppressor/cytotoxic cells (CD8), and with a polyclonal antibody to human cytokeratin. In iodine deficient goiters, focal aggregates were found of RFD1-positive dendritic cells. Furthermore, RFD1-positive epitheloid cells were seen. In 27% of cases, these epitheloid cells completely filled the thyroid follicles. Within the epitheloid cell clusters, multinucleated giant cells could be detected that carried the macrophage markers. Dendritic cells, epitheloid cells, and giant cells were strongly HLA-DR positive. In nongoitrous thyroids from the endemic area such aggregates could also be seen but they were more sparse and were RFD1 negative. Giant cells were absent there. In normal thyroids with sufficient iodine supply, only a few isolated dendritic cells were seen. All except RFD1, which was negative, showed the same marker pattern. In sporadic nontoxic goiters from an area with sufficient iodine supply, dendritic cells occurred in much higher numbers than in the normal thyroids from that area, and they were RFD1 positive. They never aggregated as in iodine deficiency, and giant cells were not observed. These observations on iodine deficient goiter strongly suggest involvement of active antigen-presenting cells in this disorder. However, the immunohistologic difference between this disease and sporadic goiter suggests different underlying mechanisms.\r"

In general, killing of the parasite with ITR was more efficient than with ITA. Inhibition of protein synthesis after incubation with either ITR or ITA, measured by 3H-leucine incorporation, confirmed the parasite immobilization experiments. The lethal effect was potentiated when the immunotoxins were used in the presence of 2.5 mM ammonium chloride. T. cruzi antibodies specific to cell surface antigens are excellent drug carriers that can be delivered to the target cell. However, ITR and ITA did not reduce parasitemia or increase survival of mice infected with T. cruzi.\r"

  ".W": "Experiments were conducted to evaluate critically, and independently of the immune system, the possible role of hemodynamic mechanisms in resistance to schistosomal reinfection. The effects of a challenge schistosomal infection were compared in groups of mice which were either previously infected with schistosomiasis, vaccinated with irradiated cercariae, or underwent partial portal vein ligation for the induction of portal hypertension and porto-systemic shunting. Following infection with 60 cercariae, the appearance of portal hypertension preceded by approximately 2 weeks the development of porto-systemic shunting, which reached maximal values 11 weeks postinfection. Such a primary infection conferred on C3H mice an estimated 90% protection to a 2nd infection, measured by the reduction of worm burden. Worm burdens were also reduced in vaccinated and ligated animals as compared to normal controls. The protection amounted to 30% and 56%, respectively, in the C3H strain and 63% and 75-85%, respectively, in the C57Bl/6 strain. Reduction in worm burden in the ligated animals is believed to be due to the extrahepatic porto-systemic vascular shunts. Hemodynamic as well as immunological factors may account for the resistance to reinfection observed in chronic murine schistosomiasis.\r"

Water usage was also determined in 2 unaffected neighboring villages not given borehole wells, but having continuous access to piped water from communal taps. Prior to borehole well construction, significantly more high-risk water use occurred in the borehole villages vs. comparison villages in terms of water gathered for cooking, drinking, dish washing, and bathing; residents of both types of villages preferred high-risk sources (marshes and ponds) for clothes washing. Following well introduction, there were significant declines in the use of high-risk water for drinking, cooking, and dish washing, but not for bathing or clothes washing. A higher proportion of individuals from the 3 borehole villages reported some type of continued contact with high-risk water sources. Despite well introduction and a 3 year chemotherapy program among school-aged children, a 21-28% incidence of infection persisted among children in the villages, suggesting minimal impact on transmission. Regular monitoring for S. haematobium infected snail sites showed no decline in the number or proportion of infected snails. Borehole well introduction can significantly alter some forms of water usage, but social and water quality factors may limit the ability of communal wells to reduce S. haematobium transmission.\r"

Evidence from plaque neutralization assay of rodent sera suggested that Seoul virus and Prospect Hill virus circulated concurrently in voles and rats, respectively, at 1 park. No cross infection of virus between these primary reservoir species was observed, as determined by higher specific neutralizing antibody titers to the characteristic virus for each host species.

  ".W": "Thirteen critically ill patients received flumazenil after multiple doses, or an infusion, of midazolam was used as part of a sedation regimen to facilitate intensive care. All patients remained excessively sedated after the midazolam was stopped for 6 hours or longer. An improvement in conscious level occurred in eight patients (61%). In four of these eight patients, the duration of action of flumazenil necessitated its continued administration by an infusion to maintain the improvement in conscious level. The dose of flumazenil required each hour was less than estimated previously; this indicates that it may be subjected to similar alterations of elimination as those described for midazolam. Flumazenil appears to be a useful drug for the reversal of prolonged benzodiazepine sedation but repeated bolus doses or an infusion are needed if significant accumulation of benzodiazepines has occurred.\r"

  ".W": "The aim of this study was to determine the effect of choice of invasive monitoring on cost, morbidity, and mortality in cardiac surgery. Two hundred and twenty-six adults undergoing elective cardiac surgery were initially assigned at random to receive either a central venous pressure monitoring catheter (group I), a conventional pulmonary artery (PA) catheter (group II), or a mixed venous oxygen saturation (SvO2) measuring PA catheter (group III). If the attending anesthesiologist believed that the patient initially randomized to group I should have a PA catheter, that patient was then reassigned to receive either a conventional PA catheter (group IV) or SvO2 measuring PA catheter (group V). The total costs were defined as the total amount billed to the patient for the catheter used; the professional cost of its insertion; and the determinations of cardiac output, arterial blood gas tensions, hemoglobin level, and hematocrit. Mean total monitoring and laboratory costs in Group I ($591 +/- 67) were statistically significantly (P less than 0.05) less than costs in Group II ($856 +/- 231). Further, mean monitoring and laboratory costs in Group II were statistically significantly (P less than 0.05) less than those in Group III ($1128 +/- 759). Patients in group IV incurred mean total costs of $986 +/- 578, while those in group V had mean total costs of $1126 +/- 382 (NS). There were no significant differences between any of the groups with respect to length of stay in the intensive care unit, morbidity, or mortality.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In a cohort of 106 hemophiliacs, the prevalence of HIV-seropositivity increased from 46.7% in 1982 to 74.5% by 1987. There was a persistent gradual decline over time of T helper/inducer (CD4) cells in HIV-seropositive hemophiliacs (P less than .01). This was reflected by an increasing percentage of hemophiliacs with abnormally low CD4 cells (less than 2 standard deviations below the mean of normal individuals) from 6.7% in 1983 to 52.4% in 1987. Function of CD4 cells, as estimated by in vitro lymphoproliferative responses to phytohemagglutinin (PHA) and tetanus toxoid stimulations also demonstrated a decline over the same years. Lymphoproliferative responses to PHA by HIV-seropositive hemophiliacs' mononuclear cells (MNC) declined from a 90.2% normal response in 1983 to a 71.7% normal response in 1987 (P less than .05). Decreased responses to stimulation with the soluble antigen tetanus toxoid were also seen from 1983 compared with 1987 (P less than .05). This was due to an increased percentage of HIV-seropositive hemophiliacs' MNC, which were unresponsive to stimulation to tetanus toxoid (stimulation index less than 3.0) from 20.8% in 1983 to 41.0% in 1987. These findings indicate that HIV-infection was associated over time with a decline of CD4 number and function in a substantial portion of hemophiliacs.\r"

In order to characterize the CRa, the authors partially purified CRa by gel filtration (G-75) and analyzed it by polyacrylamide electrophoresis (PAGE) and allergy skin testing (AST). Hyperimmune serum was produced against CRa in rabbit (R anti-CRa) and used for immunoelectrophoresis (IEP), double immunodiffusion (DID), crossed immunoelectrophoresis (CIE), and crossed radio immunoelectrophoresis (CRIE) to further characterize the CRa. The crude CRa contained 9 and 15 precipitating arcs by IEP and CIE, respectively. Indirect CRIE revealed that CRa contained nine to 15 different allergens. There were no lines of identity between the CRa and housedust mite (D.f.) or between the CRa and commercial housedust by DID or IEP. Autologous housedust of cockroach asthmatic subjects showed lines of identity with the CRa. Fractionation of CRa on a Sephadex G-75 column chromatography showed two distinct peaks (B1 and B2) separated by a broad valley. The high molecular fraction B1 was most allergenic (100%) and contained three antigens of high molecular weight. These three antigens were identifiable by the techniques of IE, CIE, and DID. B2, the low molecular fraction (molecular weight less than 13,000 dalton) contained minor allergen(s). B2 elicited positive AST in 55% of cockroach-sensitive individuals, but it was not detected by IEP, CIE, nor by DID.\r"

Histamine release induced by compound 48/80 or calcium ionophore A23187 was inhibited by staurosporine in a concentration-dependent manner and 0.1 and 1 microM staurosporine inhibited the histamine release significantly. The inhibitory effect of K-252a, another novel protein kinase C-inhibitor, was significantly higher than that of staurosporine on calcium ionophore A23187-induced histamine release. These results suggest that protein kinases will be involved in the process during mediator release from rat serosal mast cells.\r"

He was 1 of 3 affected siblings and the offspring of an affected mother, suggesting maternal transmission. At autopsy, there was neuronal loss and gliosis in the dentate nucleus of the cerebellum and in the inferior olivary nucleus. Skeletal muscle showed ragged-red fibers, and paracrystalline inclusions in mitochondria by electron microscopy. Biochemical analysis showed a generalized partial defect of cytochrome c oxidase (COX) in mitochondria isolated from all tissues, including brain, heart, skeletal muscle, kidney, and liver. The Michaelis constant (Km) for cytochrome c was abnormally low, suggesting a defect of the mitochondrially encoded subunit II of COX. Immunological studies (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, dot-blot, Western blot, and immunohistochemistry) showed that the holoenzyme was decreased but subunit II was decreased more than the holocomplex or the nuclearly encoded subunit IV. However, Northern and Southern blots showed that the gene for subunit II, as well as the genes for subunits I, III, IV, and VIII, were of normal size and were normally transcribed. A point mutation or a small deletion of mitochondrial DNA, probably affecting the COX-II gene, may be responsible for the COX deficiency in this case of MERRF.\r"

The P0.1 occlusion technique was used to assess the central respiratory response to hyperoxic hypercapnia during quiet sleep in 21 normal infants, 13 siblings of SIDS victims, and 17 infants with apparent life threatening events. The slope of P0.1 plotted against carbon dioxide concentration increased exponentially with age, independent of body weight in each group. Birth weight has a significant effect on slope with a lower weight predisposing to a lower slope. Siblings as a group had a significantly lower slope at any given age than normal infants, whereas the infants who had had apparent life threatening events were not significantly different from the controls. As intragroup variation in both siblings and control groups greatly exceeded the significant intergroup differences observed, the technique cannot identify individual infants as belonging to one or other group.\r"

Two weaning regimes were compared: in one (group A) inspiratory time was limited to 0.5 seconds throughout weaning, in the other (group B) ventilator rate was reduced by increasing both inspiratory and expiratory time (inspiration:expiration ratio constant) until inspiratory time reached 1.0 seconds. At ventilator rates of 20 and 40 breaths/minute an acute comparison was made in all 40 infants of the two inspiratory times; despite the lower mean airway pressure associated with the shorter inspiratory time blood gases were maintained. There was no difference in the incidence of pneumothoraces or need for reventilation between the two regimens but infants in group A had a shorter duration of weaning. We conclude limitation of inspiratory time to 0.5 seconds during weaning from HFPPV is advantageous to preterm infants with respiratory distress syndrome.\r"

High concentrations of the other aromatic amino acid (tyrosine) on the other hand, were often encountered and seem to be due to immaturity of an isolated hepatic enzyme as there was no correlation between phenylalanine and tyrosine concentrations. Possible adverse consequences of hypertyrosinaemia are discussed in relation to toxicity and the assessment of hepatic function. We provide reference centiles for plasma amino acid concentrations in this population.\r"

  ".W": "Eighty-five trauma patients between the ages of 18 and 55, with American College of Surgeon's (ACOS) trauma scores greater than or equal to 7 were entered into a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study to assess the efficacy of prophylactic fibronectin (Fn) administration on clinical course, sepsis development, and septic mortality. Patients were randomized on admission to receive purified human virus-inactivated Fn or placebo control (human serum albumin, HSA). Fn or HSA was administered on a daily basis if and when the patient was Fn deficient (less than 75% normal). When a Fn deficiency was not evident, the patient received saline. Seventy one patients developed Fn deficiencies during their initial clinical course: 36 received Fn, 35 received HSA. Fourteen patients did not develop a Fn deficiency after trauma and thus received only saline. Analysis of admission data demonstrated no significant differences between the three groups with respect to extent of injury (injury severity score, ACOS trauma score) or physiologic assessments of organ function (serum creatinine, bilirubin, lactic acid). On day 1 after trauma, Fn levels were shown to correlate with other plasma proteins and cellular components (range of r values, 0.24 to 0.75; all p less than 0.05), but not with organ function parameters. Eighteen of 85 patients became septic as judged by clinical criteria. Ten of these patients had received Fn (10 of 36), five had received HSA (5 of 35), and three had received only saline (3 of 14) before the development of sepsis (differences not significant). When septic, nine of 17 patients developed Fn deficiencies. Six patients received Fn while septic, three received albumin, and eight received saline. Seven patients died: 5 of 6 Fn patients, 1 saline, and 1 HSA recipient. Our data suggest that exogenous Fn repletion in states of deficiency does not alter clinical course, the development of sepsis, or septic mortality.\r"

  ".W": "Physician practice patterns and attitudes about the use of nasogastric (NG) feeding tubes in a group of elderly patients with severe chronic illness were explored in a community-based teaching hospital in Rochester, NY, using a physician questionnaire and a chart review. The physician questionnaire showed considerable divergence in beliefs about whether this treatment is extraordinary (42%), ordinary (21%), or comfort oriented (37%). Physicians who believed it was extraordinary treatment said they would recommend it less often than those who believed it to be ordinary or comfort oriented in the abstract scenario of a chronically ill, elderly patient who was not maintaining adequate nutrition. Most physician-respondents believed that the patient's wishes should guide the decision. Independently, medical records were retrospectively reviewed for all patients admitted to the hospital in the previous year who had an NG feeding tube placed, who were over the age of 70 years, and who had primary diagnoses of cerebrovascular accident, organic brain syndrome, or metastatic cancer. Contrary to the questionnaire responses, oral or written consent was documented in only 2 of 51 insertions of NG tubes. Of the 7 charts where a surrogate gave consent, only one expressed consideration of the patient's actual wishes. The clinical reasoning leading to the decision documented in the chart emphasized biomedical concerns much more than the patient's quality of life (8:1 ratio). Sixty-four percent (35/55) of patients in the study group died in the hospital, including 90% (19/21) of those who were to be treated with a comfort orientation. In only 2 of 55 patients was medical improvement cited as the reason for discontinuing use of the NG feeding tube. Restraints were used in 53% of the patients to keep the tube in. Recommendations are made that emphasize the need for active patient and family participation in the decision to use an NG feeding tube, requiring a balanced presentation of potential benefits, burdens, and limitations in patients with severe irreversible illnesses.\r"

  ".W": "At the national level debate is growing about the effects of the diagnosis related group (DRG) hospital payment system on patient access and quality of care. Recent changes to the DRG system have dropped any stratification by age and have delayed any other major change to improve payment equity. We characterized hospital resource consumption and outcome by age for all medical admissions (N = 31,838) to a large academic medical center (January 1, 1985, through December 31, 1987) using the DRG format. Mean hospital cost per patient, hospital length of stay, percentage of outliers, and mortality increased with age. The mean DRG case-mix index and the number of diagnostic codes per patient also rose with age. The DRG payment for all patients would have produced an aggregate profit of $34,426,951 ($1081 profit per patient); however, patients aged 71 years or older generated loses (the highest with patients aged 85 years or older--a $2177 loss per patient). As the financial position of American hospitals continues to deteriorate, these data suggest that the current DRG payment scheme may be inequitable for the medical patient aged 71 years or older, thus providing financial disincentives to treat the elderly medical patient and perhaps limiting their access and quality of care in the future.\r"

Severe hypertriglyceridemia (levels above 5.65 mmol/L) was found in 14 patients (28%). Plasma high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol and the HDL2 and HDL3 subclasses were measured in 22 episodes. The initial HDL cholesterol levels were usually subnormal in the patients who had not received insulin previously and normal in those who had. Treatment of the ketoacidosis was usually associated with a rapid decrease in plasma lipid levels. At late follow-up (between 1 1/2 and 14 1/2 months), only 2 of the 14 patients with initial plasma triglyceride levels above 5.65 mmol/L still had such high concentrations.\r"

Using data from a variety of sources, we performed a decision analytic-based evaluation of direct medical costs in these patients to determine whether routine prophylactic use of this medication is a preferred strategy over no prophylaxis. The base-case analysis revealed that misoprostol is cost-reducing for the initial 3 months of prophylaxis when the compliance rate is 60%, the silent ulcer rate is 40%, and the medication is priced below $1.74/d (expected costs per patient of approximately $300). The model is highly sensitive to changes in these parameters. Changing the rates of hospitalization and operation have less effect. Reliable estimates of misoprostol's economic impact after the initial 3 months of treatment are impossible to develop with current data. Nonmedical direct costs, patients' out-of-pocket costs, and indirect economic effects, such as work loss, were not considered in the model. All would enhance the economic benefit of the medication. Health care policy makers and payers must consider trade-offs between the clinical and economic implications of preventive medical interventions, such as misoprostol, especially as the call intensifies for more efficient allocation of health care resources.\r"

Gastrointestinal disease was the most prominent manifestation of CMV infection in a population of heart and heart-lung transplant patients, with an incidence of 9.9%, compared with pneumonitis (4.0%) and retinitis (0%), and occurred most frequently in CMV-seronegative recipients of organs from CMV-seropositive donors. Clinical manifestations included gastritis (nine patients), gastric ulceration (four patients), duodenitis (three patients), esophagitis (one patient), pyloric perforation (one patient), and colonic hemorrhage (one patient). Patients with gastrointestinal CMV infection were treated with intravenous ganciclovir sodium therapy, 5 mg/kg twice daily, for 2 to 8 weeks, with positive clinical, endoscopic, histologic, and virologic responses. Relapses occurred in four of nine patients who were followed up for a median period of 18 months. Retreatment resulted in healing of endoscopic lesions and in viral clearing. We conclude that early endoscopic evaluation for CMV is indicated in heart and heart-lung transplant patients with gastrointestinal symptoms. This study further suggests that intravenous ganciclovir therapy is effective for the treatment of gastrointestinal CMV in these patients.\r"

Eight patients (53%) responded with a moderate to marked improvement.

A distinctive pattern of immunoreactivity with a series of monoclonal antibodies (Mabs) was documented in the polar tumor cells forming the reticulin-free pale islands of the desmoplastic variant, denoting overt neuritogenesis. These comprised the following: (1) Mab Tp-NFP1A3 recognizing an epitope in the high-molecular-weight (Mr) isoform of neurofilament protein; (2) Mab AP18 to the high-Mr microtubule-associated protein 2; (3) Mab TUJ1 recognizing the class III beta-tubulin isotype (human h beta 4); and (4) Mab SY38 to synaptophysin. Immunoblot analysis confirmed the expression of h beta 4 in three medulloblastomas, yielding strong single bands in two desmoplastic medulloblastomas and a considerably weaker band in one classic medulloblastoma. Glial fibrillary acidic protein-positive tumor cells frequently formed an integral component of the pale islands. Oligodendrogliallike areas in one classic and in three desmoplastic medulloblastomas were immunopositive for the Mabs to synaptophysin, microtubule-associated protein 2, and h beta 4, indicating a neuroblastic nature. We propose that the reticulin-free structures of desmoplastic medulloblastomas constitute neoplastic foci with features of predominantly neuronal and, to a lesser degree, astroglial differentiation.\r"

Ouabain binds specifically, in a saturable manner, and with a high affinity to a single class of binding sites in all the tissues studied. The density of ouabain binding sites was highest in cerebellum and frontal cortex (approximately 40 pmol/mg of protein); intermediate in temporal cortex, hippocampus, and putamen; and lowest in brain microvessels (approximately 8 pmol/mg of protein). The dissociation constant of binding was about 30 nmol/L in all tissues. In control subjects, there were no age-related alterations in ouabain binding, nor was there any correlation between ouabain binding and postmortem delay. However, there was a marked decrease in brain ouabain binding in subjects with Alzheimer's disease when compared with age-matched controls, especially in the cerebral cortex. Ouabain binding was also significantly decreased in the cerebellum and putamen of subjects with Alzheimer's disease even though these brain regions are not particularly affected in this disease. Ouabain binding to brain microvessels, which constitute the blood-brain barrier, was not significantly decreased in subjects with Alzheimer's disease. The decreased specific ouabain binding in the brain of subjects with Alzheimer's disease probably reflects the loss of neuronal membranes.\r"

  ".W": "Macrophages present in the synovium and synovial fluid of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) express large amounts of HLA-DR molecules on their surface, despite low levels of gamma-interferon (gamma-IFN) in the joint. To determine whether this apparent paradox is the result of increased sensitivity to gamma-IFN in RA, we compared concentrations of gamma-IFN that induced HLA-DR and DQ on peripheral blood monocytes of RA patients and normal donors, using fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis. Among normal donors, highly variable sensitivity to gamma-IFN was observed. Higher amounts of gamma-IFN were required to induce class II major histocompatibility complex molecules on RA monocytes versus normal monocytes. The maximum amount of HLA-DR that could be induced on RA and normal monocytes was similar; however, peak levels of HLA-DQ were significantly less in RA. Monocytes from patients with other forms of chronic inflammatory arthritis had intermediate HLA-DQ expression after gamma-IFN treatment. These data suggest that an increased sensitivity to gamma-IFN in RA does not account for the high level of HLA-DR expression in the joint. Also, a defect in HLA-DQ and HLA-DR induction by gamma-IFN was observed.\r"

To address these questions, we conducted an analysis of pooled raw data from 3 placebo-controlled RA trials: one of methotrexate, another of oral and injectable gold, and the third of low-dose and high-dose D-penicillamine. The results show that the joint tenderness count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, grip strength, and physician assessment of disease activity perform best in RA clinical trials and cover the domain of change measured by traditional outcome measures. Other clinical measures may provide little additional useful information for a standard therapeutic trial of up to 6 months duration, and some measures, such as the proximal interphalangeal joint circumference, hemoglobin level, and 50-foot walking time, can be eliminated from such trials.\r"
