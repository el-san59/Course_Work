Animal models of halothane hepatotoxicity have been described, although their application to humans is of doubtful significance. Two, probably distinct, forms of liver damage associated with halothane have been identified. The much more common mild form may result from reductive biotransformation of halothane, possibly influenced by genetic factors, or reduced liver oxygenation, whereas the rare fulminant form is most likely to be immune-mediated. The role of altered calcium homeostasis has not yet been established. In addition, a common mechanism for liver dysfunction associated with halogenated volatile anaesthetic agents has been proposed. The hepatotoxicity of enflurane cannot be excluded; while hepatic dysfunction after isoflurane or nitrous oxide is considered unlikely, further attention is necessary. It is too soon to comment on the hepatotoxic potential of sevoflurane or desflurane.\r"

  ".W": "The purposes of this study were to examine the biologic effects of the engagement of the interleukin-7 receptor (IL-7R) with recombinant human interleukin-7 (rhIL-7) in immunophenotypically distinct T-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) blasts and to elucidate the biochemical nature of the IL-7R-linked transmembrane signal in rhIL-7-responsive T-lineage ALL blast populations. In the absence of costimulants, rhIL-7 stimulated the in vitro proliferation and colony formation of freshly isolated leukemic blasts from six to eight T-lineage ALL patients with a mean plating efficiency of 196 +/- 53 (background subtracted) colonies/10(5) blasts plated. Stimulation of T-lineage ALL blasts with rhIL-7 resulted in markedly enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation of six distinct phosphoproteins with molecular weights of 57, 72, 98, 123, 150, and 190 Kd, and induced a rapid increase in the production of inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate (Ins-1,4,5-P3), which was inhibitable by the tyrosine-specific protein kinase inhibitor genistein, but not by the serine/threonine-specific protein kinase C inhibitor H7. Similarly, rhIL-7 stimulated Ins-1,4,5-P3 production in CEM-1.3 T-lineage ALL cells and this stimulation was inhibitable by the tyrosine-specific protein kinase inhibitors genistein and herbimycin A, but not by H-7. Thus, the transmembrane signal triggered by engagement of the IL-7R is intimately linked to a functional tyrosine-specific protein kinase pathway and stimulates the phosphoinositide (PI) turnover and proliferation of T-lineage ALL blasts. The presented data confirm and extend previous studies on the expression of functional IL-7R on T-lineage ALL blasts and support the hypothesis that IL-7 may play an important regulatory role in the biology of T-lineage ALL.\r"

To determine if the spontaneous proliferation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from patients infected with HTLV-I and HTLV-II was related to coordinate expression of cytokines, we analyzed the levels of interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta), IL-2, IL-3, IL-4, IL-6, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and interferon-tau (IFN-tau) in culture supernatants derived from spontaneously proliferating cells. Significantly elevated levels of IL-6 and TNF-alpha were present in culture supernatants from HTLV-I/II-infected individuals when compared with normal controls (P less than .01). Kinetic experiments showed that both IL-6 and TNF-alpha were elevated by day 5. None of the other cytokines (IL-1 beta, IL-2, IL-3, IL-4, and IFN-tau) were detectable in any of the culture. These data suggest that release of IL-6 and TNF-alpha may regulate lymphocyte proliferation in HTLV-I/II-infected individuals.\r"

Subpopulations of cells were isolated according to immunophenotype and then analyzed by both a clonogenic assay and molecular genetic methods. Clonal equivalence of the early and late immunophenotypic subpopulations was confirmed for each case by the demonstration of identical lg gene rearrangements. The in vitro colony-forming assay consistently showed a growth advantage for the CD34+ subpopulations over the CD34- subpopulations. CD34 mRNA was detected readily in these isolated precursor cells. When two specimens in which virtually all of the leukemia cells were CD34+ and CD34+CD20+ and CD34+CD22+ subpopulations were also present the CD34 mRNA was limited to the cells without the late-stage differentiation antigens on their surface. Furthermore, the c-myb mRNA was found only in the subpopulations that also contained CD34 mRNA. Our results show that a limited program of differentiation reminiscent of normal B-cell development may be present in this leukemia.\r"

We have examined the antibody specificity of MIgs derived from the tumor cells of 31 different patients with CD5- B-cell lymphomas. Our results indicate that the tumor cells from 8 of these 31 patients (25.8%) express Igs with autoantibody activity. In two cases antibody activity was multispecific. In four cases, antibody activity was exclusively directed against the Fc fragment of IgG, whereas the two other cases bound to both Fc fragment of IgG and nuclear antigens.

  ".W": "Resistance to multiple chemotherapeutic agents has been related to the production of P-glycoprotein, a trans-membrane drug efflux pump that is encoded by the multidrug resistance (MDR) gene mdr1. To investigate whether mdr1 could be involved in clinical resistance to chemotherapy in acute leukemias, we have analyzed retrospectively the RNA from adult acute leukemia cells by slot-blot hybridization with a human mdr1 probe. Units of mdr1 expression were defined by reference to drug-sensitive human sarcoma and K562 leukemia cell lines (1 U) and the highly resistant doxorubicin selected leukemia cells K562/R7 (50 U). We studied 41 adult patients with acute leukemias: 5 acute lymphoblastic leukemias, 23 acute myeloid leukemias, and 13 secondary leukemias or blast crisis of chronic myelogenous leukemia. Expression of 10 U or more of mdr1 was found in 6 of 31 (19%) leukemias at diagnosis, versus 5 of 10 (50%) after relapse from therapy, P = .06. The complete remission rate and in vitro sensitivity to daunorubicin were both correlated with low expression (1 U, v 2 U or more) of mdr1. Among 36 evaluable attempts to induce remission, the complete remission rate was 67% (8 of 12) for patients with undetectable or minimal mdr1 expression (1 U), versus 29% (7 of 24) in patients with 2 U or more of expression, P = .03. In vitro resistance to daunorubicin or other MDR-related drugs was associated with expression of 2 U or more of mdr1 in 11 of 11 cases, while specimens that were sensitive to these agents were negative for mdr1 expression in 5 of 11 cases, P = .03. These data suggest that mdr1 expression contributes to chemoresistance in acute leukemia. Determination of mdr1 gene expression may be useful in designing therapy for patients with leukemia.\r"

  ".W": "Among inducers of myeloid differentiation for leukemic cells, tiazofurin is of special interest because its mechanism of action is known; it inhibits inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase and thus decreases the guanine nucleotide pool. Reported here are three aspects of tiazofurin induction of myeloid differentiation in HL60 human acute promyelocytic leukemia cells. First, inductive efficacy was evaluated for analogues ara-tiazofurin, xylo-tiazofurin, and selenazofurin, for dinucleotide anabolites thiazole-4-carboxamide adenine dinucleotide (TAD) and selenazole-4-carboxamide adenine dinucleotide (SAD), and for a phosphodiesterase-resistant TAD analogue, beta-methylene TAD. The results showed that the parent compounds are more effective inducers than the dinucleotide derivatives and that the selenazole analogues are more effective inducers than the thiazole compounds. Second, HL60 cell induction by tiazofurin was shown to be synergistic with that produced by the antiviral agent ribavirin. Finally, tiazofurin was found to induce expression of a phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C-sensitive Fc gamma-receptor III (FcRIII) on HL60 cells, a feature consistent with neutrophilic, but not monocytic, differentiation.\r"

To determine the relation between erythroid progenitors and clinical status, blood and marrow mononuclear cells were cultured in methyl cellulose with erythropoietin, plus other hematopoietic growth factors, and growth in normal oxygen (20%) was compared with growth in low, physiologic oxygen (5%). Peripheral blood cultures were performed from 24 patients, and marrows from six. Patients were classified into six clinical groups. Group 1: Severe aplasia, transfused; one patient; no erythroid progenitors. Group 2: Severe, transfused, androgen unresponsive; one patient; no blood burst-forming units-erythroid (BFU-E). Group 3: Androgen responsive; eight patients, with decreased blood BFU-E. Group 4: Aplastic, about to start treatment; two patients; below normal numbers of colony-forming units-erythroid (CFU-E) and BFU-E. Group 5: Stable, with mild anemia, and/or thrombocytopenia, and/or macrocytosis; seven patients; with below normal numbers of blood BFU-E. Group 6: Hematologically normal; five patients; blood BFU-E low normal to normal. One marrow had normal numbers of CFU-E and BFU-E. Incubation in 5% oxygen doubled CFU-E and BFU-E only in the patients with close to normal or normal growth in 20% oxygen. Hemin and interleukin-3 increased growth slightly in those cultures where there was some growth with erythropoietin alone. Our data show that there is a correlation between current clinical status and in vitro erythropoiesis. Cultures of erythroid progenitors may also be useful predictors of hematologic prognosis in FA, although our follow-up period is too short to prove this hypothesis.\r"

We previously demonstrated functional human granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) receptors on small cell carcinoma of the lung cell lines, and others have reported that certain solid tumor cell lines respond to GM-CSF in clonogenic assays. In the current study, we examine human melanoma cell lines and fresh specimens of melanoma to determine whether they have functional GM-CSF receptors. Scatchard analyses of 125I-GM-CSF equilibrium binding to melanoma cell lines showed a mean of 542 +/- 67 sites per cell with a kd of 0.72 +/- 0.14 nmol/L. Cross-linking studies in the melanoma cell line, M14, showed a major GM-CSF receptor species of 84,000 daltons. Under the conditions tested, the M14 cells did not have a proliferative response to GM-CSF in vitro, nor was any induction of primary response genes detected by Northern analysis in response to GM-CSF. Studies to determine internal translocation of the receptor-ligand complex indicated less than 10% of the 125I-GM-CSF internalized was specifically bound to receptors. Primary melanoma cells from five surgical specimens had GM-CSF receptors; Scatchard analysis was performed on one sample, showing 555 sites/cell with a kd of 0.23 nmol/L. These results indicate that human tumor cells may express a low-affinity GM-CSF receptor protein that localizes to the cell surface and binds ligand, but lacks functional components or accessory factors needed to transduce a signal.\r"

A cDNA encoding the interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra) was cloned by subtractive hybridization from a CSF-1-stimulated murine macrophage cell line, sequenced, and expressed in mammalian and bacterial cells. Mouse IL-1Ra is a 22-Kd glycoprotein that is 76% identical to its human counterpart, shows considerably less similarity to IL-1 alpha and IL-1 beta, and competes with IL-1 alpha for binding to the type I IL-1 receptor normally expressed on T cells and fibroblasts. CSF-1 treatment of mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages led to a rapid and sustained increase in IL-1Ra mRNA during the G1 phase of the cell cycle as well as to increases in mRNAs encoding IL-1 alpha and IL-1 beta. Cycloheximide inhibited CSF-1-induced IL-1 alpha mRNA synthesis, but augmented IL-1 beta mRNA production and did not affect induction of IL-1Ra mRNA. No IL-1Ra mRNA was observed in CSF-1-stimulated mouse fibroblasts engineered to express CSF-1 receptors, demonstrating that its regulation depends on cell context and can be dissociated from the proliferative response. In agreement, bacterial lipopolysaccharide, a nonmitogenic activator, also induced IL-1Ra and IL-1 mRNAs in macrophages. Unlike IL-1 alpha and beta, IL-1Ra contains a signal peptide. The kinetics of its induction and its ability to gain access to the secretory compartment imply that IL-1Ra may be secreted more efficiently than IL-1, and suggest that macrophages both positively and negatively regulate the IL-1 response.\r"

  ".W": "The ability to transfer new genetic material into human hematopoietic cells provides the foundation for characterizing the organization and developmental program of human hematopoietic stem cells. It also provides a valuable model in which to test gene transfer and long-term expression in human hematopoietic cells as a prelude to human gene therapy. At the present time such studies are limited by the absence of in vivo assays for human stem cells, although recent descriptions of the engraftment of human hematopoietic cells in immune-deficient mice may provide the basis for such an assay. This study focuses on the establishment of conditions required for high efficiency retrovirus-mediated gene transfer into human hematopoietic progenitors that can be assayed in vitro in short-term colony assays and in vivo in immune-deficient mice. Here we report that a 24-hour preincubation of human bone marrow in 5637-conditioned medium, before infection, increases gene transfer efficiency into in vitro colony-forming cells by sixfold; interleukin-6 (IL-6) and leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) provide the same magnitude increase as 5637-conditioned medium. In contrast, incubation in recombinant growth factors IL-1, IL-3, and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor increases gene transfer efficiency by 1.5- to 3-fold. Furthermore, preselection in high concentrations of G418 results in a population of cells significantly enriched for G418-resistant progenitors (up to 100%). These results, obtained using detailed survival curves based on colony formation in G418, have been substantiated by directly detecting the neo gene in individual colonies using the polymerase chain reaction. Using these optimized protocols, human bone marrow cells were genetically manipulated with a neo retrovirus vector and transplanted into immune-deficient bg/nu/xid mice. At 1 month and 4 months after the transplant, the hematopoietic tissues of these animals remained engrafted with genetically manipulated human cells. More importantly, G418-resistant progenitors that contained the neo gene were recovered from the bone marrow and spleen of engrafted animals after 4 months. These experiments establish the feasibility of characterizing human stem cells using the unique retrovirus integration site as a clonal marker, similar to techniques developed to elucidate the murine stem cell hierarchy.\r"

  ".W": "We have previously shown that tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF alpha) strongly potentiates interleukin-3 (IL-3)-induced short-term proliferation of human CD34+ hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPC). Using longer term cultures of CD34+ HPC, we demonstrate here that this initial potentiation ceases after 10 to 12 days; whereupon TNF alpha displays inhibitory effects. Thus, TNF alpha was found to inhibit cells of granulocytic affiliation while it potentiates the development of maturing cells of the monocytic lineage both in liquid and semi-solid (day 14 colony-forming unit) cultures. TNF alpha was demonstrated to reversibly block granulocytic differentiation at the level of uncommitted CD13-, CD15- blast cells that accumulate in IL-3 + TNF alpha cultures. Furthermore, growth of committed granulocytes (CD15+) from IL-3 cultures was also inhibited by TNF alpha through an arrest of cell cycle in G0/G1. Finally, the use of neutralizing anti-TNF alpha monoclonal antibody and limiting dilution studies indicate that the inhibitory effects of TNF alpha are direct. Taken together, our data demonstrate that, following a phase of potentiation of proliferation of early HPC, TNF alpha displays direct inhibitory effects due to negative interference with both granulocytic differentiation and proliferation of granulocytic cells.\r"

Neutrophilia begins at 2 hours, peaks at 4 to 6 hours, and subsides between 12 and 24 hours. Lymphocytosis occurs at 0.5 hours and has subsided by 2 hours. rrSCF-induced neutrophilia and lymphocytosis are abrogated by boiling, demonstrating that endotoxin-contamination of the rrSCF preparation is not responsible for the observed hematologic effects. The bone marrow at 6 hours after injection of rrSCF shows a left-shifted myeloid and erythroid hyperplasia as evidenced by significant increases in the absolute numbers of morphologically recognizable early myeloid and erythroid precursors. A concurrent decrease in the absolute numbers of mature marrow neutrophils is noted, suggesting that the release of marrow neutrophils contributes to the peripheral neutrophilia. After 2 weeks of daily injections of rrSCF, bone marrow smears demonstrate a remarkable mast cell hyperplasia accompanied by a decrease in total marrow cellularity and by a striking erythroid and lymphoid hypoplasia. rrSCF also causes mast cells to appear in the circulation and causes a systemic increase in embryonic connective tissue-type, but not mucosal-type, mast cells. In vitro long-term culture of lineage-depleted mouse bone marrow cells with rrSCF results in an almost pure outgrowth of mast cells.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of recombinant human macrophage colony-stimulating factor (rhCSF-1) in long-term marrow cultures (LTMC) established from normal bone marrow cells were examined. When added during the first 3 weeks of culture (every second day, at 15 ng/mL), rhCSF-1 strongly inhibited the growth of all hematopoietic progenitors analyzed (colony-forming unit-MIX [CFU-MIX], CFU-granulocyte macrophage [CFU-GM], CFU-M, CFU-G, burst-forming unit-erythroid). Paralleling the inhibition of progenitors was the complete loss of adipocytes from the stromal layer of rhCSF-1-treated cultures. The inhibitory effect of rhCSF-1 correlated in all instances with the accumulation in the supernatants of these cultures of an activity (different from CSF-1) that inhibited colony formation in semisolid cultures. When addition of rhCSF-1 was delayed 3 weeks, its inhibitory effects were significantly reduced, which correlated with reduced inhibitory activity detected in the supernatants. Analysis of CSF-1 concentration by radioreceptor assay confirmed that added rhCSF-1 increased culture CSF-1 levels and showed that the decreased inhibition observed when rhCSF-1 is added later in culture was not due to decreased CSF-1 levels at that point. In contrast, the ability of rhCSF-1 to inhibit hematopoiesis and accumulate inhibitory activity in LTMC correlated with its rate of utilization, much higher in the first 2 weeks of culture, when the stromal layer was being established, than later. These observations document the inhibitory effect of rhCSF-1 on all aspects of hematopoiesis conducted in cultures that simulate the hematopoietic microenvironment, demonstrate the importance of accessory/stromal cells in mediating the effects of rhCSF-1 in LTMC, and point to an inhibitory activity as the mediating agent.\r"

  ".U": "91316278\r", 
  ".W": "Colony-stimulating factors (CSF) are important factors in the proliferation and differentiation of hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPC), and in the survival and activation of mature blood cells. Interleukin-1 (IL-1) combined with fetal bovine serum (FBS) strongly induces the expression of macrophage-CSF (M-CSF), granulocyte-CSF (G-CSF), and granulocyte-macrophage-CSF (GM-CSF) in fibroblasts. Here, we report on the regulation of CSF gene expression in murine fibroblasts following IL-1 and FBS stimulation. We demonstrate that 10T1/2 murine fibroblasts induced by FBS or IL-1 accumulate M-CSF messenger RNA (mRNA). G-CSF mRNA expression was induced by IL-1, and not by FBS. For GM-CSF expression, induction with both FBS and IL-1 was required. Blocking studies with actinomycin-D showed that active transcription is essential for accumulation of all three CSF mRNAs. After blocking protein synthesis with cycloheximide, IL-1- or FBS-induced M-CSF expression and IL-1 plus FBS-induced GM-CSF expression still occurred and was increased. IL-1-induced G-CSF expression was completely prevented in these cells by pretreatment with cycloheximide, illustrating that, for this effect, intermediate protein synthesis was required. The half-lives of M-CSF transcripts were not substantially altered by addition of IL-1, FBS, or FBS plus IL-1. Using nuclear run-on assays, we demonstrated that the transcription rate of M-CSF was increased up to 20-fold by the addition of FBS, IL-1, or FBS plus IL-1. After blocking protein synthesis with cycloheximide, IL-1-or FBS-induced increase in M-CSF transcription rate was also observed. GM-CSF transcription increased up to fourfold after induction with FBS or IL-1. G-CSF transcription rate was not altered by FBS or IL-1. Our results indicate that M-CSF expression induced by FBS or IL-1 in these fibroblasts is primarily regulated at the transcriptional level. GM-CSF expression appears to be regulated both transcriptionally and posttranscriptionally, and G-CSF expression is regulated mainly at the posttranscriptional level.\r"

  ".W": "Various growth factors are known to stimulate both early and late stages of human hematopoietic cell development in semisolid assay systems, but their role as microenvironmental regulators is poorly understood. To address this problem, we developed a novel coculture system in which highly purified primitive human hematopoietic cells were seeded onto an irradiated feeder layer of cells from a murine marrow-derived stromal cell line (M2-10B4) previously engineered by retroviral-mediated gene transfer to produce specific human factors. Effects on cells at very early, intermediate, and late stages of hematopoiesis were then evaluated by assessing the number of clonogenic cell precursors (long-term culture initiating cells [LTC-IC]), clonogenic cells, and mature granulocyte and macrophage progeny present in the cultures after 5 weeks. In the absence of any feeders, cells at all stages of hematopoiesis decreased to very low levels. In contrast, maintenance of LTC-IC was found to be supported by control murine stromal cells as effectively as by standard human marrow adherent layers. The presence of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) and interleukin-3-producing M2-10B4 cells in combination was able to further enhance the maintenance and early differentiation of these cells without a decline in their proliferative potential as measured by the clonogenic output per LTC-IC. However, this effect was lost if granulocyte-macrophage CSF (GM-CSF)-producing feeders were also present. On the other hand, in the presence of GM-CSF-producing feeders, the output of mature granulocytes and macrophages increased 20-fold. These findings show that it is possible to selectively improve the maintenance of very primitive human hematopoietic cells in vitro or their output of mature progeny by appropriate manipulation of the long-term marrow culture system. Further exploitation of this approach should facilitate investigation of the mechanisms operative within the human marrow microenvironment in vivo and the design of protocols for in vitro manipulation of human marrow for future therapeutic applications.\r"

  ".W": "The mechanism of platelet thrombus growth on an artificial surface is incompletely understood. While glycoprotein (GP)Ib and GPIIb/IIIa are required for normal attachment and thrombus formation on subendothelium, their roles in platelet deposition to artificial surfaces remain unclear. Using selected platelet inhibitors (aspirin [ASA], low molecular weight dextran, monoclonal antibodies 10E5 [v GPIIb/IIIa], and 6D1 [GPIb]) we examined the mechanism of platelet deposition to polyethylene (PE) surfaces under steady laminar and oscillatory flow conditions. Polyethylene-100 (PE-100) tubes (0.86 mm internal diameter) were perfused under steady laminar flow with citrated human whole blood reconstituted with 111indium-labeled platelets at 312 seconds-1 shear rate in the presence and absence of platelet inhibitors. The effect of oscillatory flow on platelet deposition was examined in a microwell system using 3/16-inch diameter discs of National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute primary reference PE as the test surface. ASA and dextran did not significantly (P greater than .05) inhibit platelet deposition in laminar flow (not tested in oscillatory). Antibody 10E5 was a potent inhibitor (laminar less than 1%, P less than .0001, oscillatory less than 1.6%, P less than .01) of platelet deposition in both systems, and in this case, true adhesion (first attached layer) was blocked. Antibody 6D1 unexpectedly inhibited 70% of platelet deposition (P less than .01) in steady laminar flow and 56.5% in oscillatory flow (P less than .01). Scanning electron microscopy demonstrated platelets atop platelets in the controls, rare platelets in the 10E5 group, and a patchy monolayer of platelets in the 6D1 group. Transmission electron microscopy of cross-sections confirmed these observations. We conclude that the adhesion of the first platelet layer to an artificial surface requires GPIIb/IIIa. The data also suggest that GPIb is required for the development of the second layer in vertical platelet thrombus growth.\r"

Minor changes in the secondary and tertiary structures of platelet membrane glycoproteins (GP) IIb and IIIa encoded by these alleles can result in an alloimmune reaction after transfusion or during pregnancy. To better understand the molecular structure of the PlA alloantigen system, located on GPIIIa, and the Bak alloantigen on GPIIb, we used a heterologous mammalian expression system to express these integrin subunits in their known polymorphic forms. An expression vector containing the PlA1 form of a GPIIIa cDNA, which encodes a leucine at amino acid 33 (Leu33), was modified to express the PlA2-associated form encoding a proline at amino acid 33 (Pro33). Similarly, a Baka GPIIb cDNA expressing an isoleucine at amino acid 843 (IIe843) was modified to express the Bakb form containing a serine at the same position (Ser843). Transfection of these vectors into COS cells resulted in the synthesis of GPIIb and GPIIIa molecules that were identical in size to those present in platelet lysates. Immunoprecipitation of the GPIIIa-transfected COS lysates with PlA)-specific alloantisera indicated that the Leu33 form was recognized only by anti-PIA1 sera while the Pro33 form was bound only by anti-PlA2 sera, showing that single amino acid polymorphisms are necessary and sufficient to direct the formation of the PlA1 and PlA2 alloepitopes. Similar experiments with Bak allele-specific expression vectors indicated that while the amino acid polymorphism (IIe843 in equilibrium Ser843) was necessary, posttranslational processing of pro-IIb was required for efficient exposure of both the Baka and Bakb alloepitopes.\r"

To find out if such an effect results from the blockade of the recognition phase of the classical complement cascade, we investigated the ability of human serum containing high concentrations of IVIg to deposit the recognition subunit of the first complement component (C1q) onto targets. Normal human serum supplemented in vitro with IVIg did not demonstrate reduced C1q binding to targets as determined by radiolabeled antihuman C1q antibody uptake. Similarly, methylamine-treated normal human serum to which IVIg was added was equally effective in terms of C1q binding as the same serum without IVIg. At increasing doses of sensitizing antibody, C1q uptake decreased proportionally; however, at all antibody dilution points C1q uptake was not significantly different in the serum with IVIg in comparison with normal serum. Serum from a patient treated with IVIg did not differ in its capacity to deposit C1q from the same patient's serum before therapy. Our data suggest that IVIg does not interfere with the recognition step of classical complement pathway. This is a US government work. There are no restrictions on its use.\r"

However, its precise role in regulating B lymphopoiesis in bone marrow is not as well defined. We examined whether surface IgM- normal and leukemic human B-cell precursors (BCP) expressed IL-4 receptors using biotinylated IL-4. Constitutive expression of IL-4 receptors was detected on both normal and leukemic BCP. A higher percentage of normal BCP (82% +/- 15%) expressed IL-4 receptors compared with leukemic BCP (44% +/- 8%). Using mean fluorescent intensity as an indicator of receptor level on the IL-4 receptor positive cells, normal (91 +/- 41) and leukemic (44 +/- 37) BCP expressed comparable numbers of receptors. IL-4 induced the expression of CD23 on 30% of the leukemic BCP cases examined. IL-4 induced CD23 on surface IgM+ fetal bone marrow lymphoid cells but not on the surface IgM- normal BCP, despite the presence of detectable receptors on the surface IgM- cells. IL-4 did not stimulate proliferation of normal BCP, nor could it enhance the effect of recombinant IL-7 or low molecular weight B-cell growth factor. However, IL-4 increased the expression of surface IgM and surface Ig kappa on in vitro differentiated pre-B cells. Our collective results identify no role for IL-4 in the proliferation of normal or leukemic BCP, but identify a role in the enhancement of surface Ig expression during pre-B to B-cell differentiation.\r"

  ".W": "The peripheral blood lymphocytes from 42 patients with multiple myeloma (MM) and 13 patients with monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) were studied by three-color immunofluorescence (IF) using antibodies directed to a broad range of B-cell markers (CD19, CD20, CD21, CD24), CALLA (CD10), PCA-1 (a plasma cell marker), and to the high and low molecular weight isoforms of the leukocyte common antigen, CD45RA (p205/220) and CD45RO (p 180). CD45RA is expressed on pre-B and B cells, and a transition from CD45RA to CD45RO defines differentiation towards plasma cells. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from patients with myeloma included a large subset of B-lineage cells (mean of 39% to 45%) that were CALLA+ and PCA-1+ in all patients studied, including newly diagnosed patients and patients undergoing chemotherapy. Southern blot analysis indicated the presence of monoclonal Ig rearrangements in PBMC and a substantial reduction in the germ-line bands consistent with the presence of a large monoclonal B-cell subset. Avoidance of purification methods involving depletion of adherent cells was essential for detection of the abnormal B cells. Phenotypically, this abnormal B-cell population corresponded to late B or early pre-plasma cells (20% to 80% of PBMC), as defined by the concomitant expression of low densities of CD19 and CD20, moderate densities of CALLA and PCA-1, and strong expression of CD45RO on all B cells, with weakly coexpressed CD45RA on a small proportion. Heterogeneity in the expression of CD45RA and CD45RO within the abnormal B-cell population from any given patient suggested multiple differentiation stages. Abnormal B cells similar to those in MM were also detected in MGUS, although as a lower proportion of PBMC (26%). Abnormal B cells from patients with MGUS expressed predominantly the CD45RO isoform, but had a lower proportion of CALLA+ and PCA-1+ cells than were found on B cells from MM. This work indicates that the large subset of circulating monoclonal B lymphocytes from myeloma patients are at a late stage in B-cell differentiation, continuously progressing towards the plasma cell stage.\r"

Our data show that ABM cells lyse the MCMV-infected cells in vitro, at both acute and chronic stages of infection; this lysis is specific for the MCMV-infected cells. ABM cells supplemented with IL-2 therapy virtually eradicated the viral infection and prolonged the survival of MCMV-infected Balb/c mice, whether or not they were immunocompromised by irradiation (P less than .001 in both situations). Efficacy of ABM cells alone or IL-2 alone was less than the combination of ABM cells and IL-2. The efficacy of combination treatment with ABM cells and IL-2 in improving the survival of MCMV-infected mice was comparable, whether used in a preventive or a therapeutic setting. Therapy with ABM plus IL-2 also prevented the reactivation of chronic MCMV infection after irradiation. Preliminary findings indicate that Thy-1+ and asialo GM1+ cells limited the MCMV proliferation by approximately 30% and 80%, respectively, while BM macrophages limited the proliferation of MCMV by 100%. These results suggest that BM transplantation (BMT) with ABM cells followed by IL-2 therapy may constitute a novel strategy to improve the host resistance against cytomegalovirus infection after BMT.\r"

MR scan results were compared with blind posterior iliac crest aspirations and biopsies. Images of vertebral, pelvic, and femoral marrow were obtained using a standard T1-weighted, short repetition time (TR), short time to echo (TE) (TR700/TE22), spin-echo (T1-SE) method in 92 patients and short TI inversion recovery (STIR) technique (TR1,500/TE36/TI100) in all. On standard T1-SE sequence, normal marrow is bright due to the predominance of marrow fat, and tumor is dark. With STIR images, water containing tumor has a very high signal intensity in a dark (fat suppressed) background. Thirteen patients had positive MR scans and marrow biopsies, whereas 49 had negative MR scans and biopsies. Of 36 discordant MR/histology results, 10 had positive biopsies and negative MR exams; eight of these had microscopic infiltration (less than or equal to 5%) with tumor. MR detected marrow tumor either in the crests or elsewhere in 25 of 75 (33%) patients with negative study biopsies. We could confirm marrow involvement in 15 of these 25 (60%) by clinical methods. Therefore, up to one third of the patients evaluated with routine biopsies may have occult marrow tumor detectable by MR exam. In patients with negative marrow biopsies, especially those with Hodgkin's disease or intermediate to high-grade non-Hodgkin's lymphomas, MR scans found focal lesions distant from the crests. Biopsy better detected lower grade microscopic involvement. We conclude that optimal marrow staging of lymphoma patients incorporates both biopsy and MR imaging.\r"

  ".W": "After achieving remission, approximately one-third of patients with T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) relapse due to the resurgence of residual leukemic cells that cannot be detected in remission by morphologic methods. Thus, the early detection of residual disease is highly desirable to monitor the efficacy of therapy, or to institute an alternative mode of therapy. Toward this aim, we have examined the applicability of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification in the detection of minimal residual disease (MRD) in bone marrow samples from patients with T-ALL in morphologic remission. Two different approaches were taken to identify leukemic clone-specific sequences that could be used as targets for PCR amplification. The first technique used T-cell receptor-delta (TCR-delta) gene rearrangements that were sequenced directly after PCR amplification of leukemic DNA. This method was successful in generating clone-specific probes for 76% of T-ALL patients screened. An alternative method was used to clone and sequence a TCR-beta chain gene from leukemic cells to generate a specific probe. The PCR assays that we used were specific for each patient's leukemic clone, and were capable of routinely detecting one leukemic cell in 10(4) normal cells. Using these sensitive PCR-based assays, we found no evidence for persistence of the leukemic clone in any of the bone marrow samples from four T-ALL patients who are in long-term (3.9 + to 8.1 + years) remission. In contrast, we detected residual disease in clinical remission samples from two patients who subsequently relapsed. In one patient, where we had appropriate samples, we observed a dramatic expansion of the leukemic clone 3 months before clinical relapse. These results suggest that PCR-based assays for detection of MRD in T-ALL patients have great potential in predicting impending relapse, and in determining the efficacy of the anti-leukemic therapy. These methods may also allow the identification of long-term survivors.\r"

  ".W": "We report the nonrandom occurrence and frequency of the t(1;22)(p13;q13) in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and its close association with the French-American-British M7 subtype of AML in infants (less than 1 year). This chromosomal abnormality occurred in 6 of 252 (2.4%) children and adolescents with AML (6 of 28 infants, 22%; 6 of 18 M7 AML cases overall, 33%; and 6 of 6 M7 cases in infants). Infants with AML of M7 subtype and the t(1;22) often presented with prominent abdominal masses. Two of these infants were not treated and died early. Three of four treated infants entered complete remission with therapy for AML; the remaining infant died of hemorrhage on day 8. Of the three infants who entered remission, only one remains alive and disease free at 5+ months. The other two infants relapsed in the bone marrow at 5 and 2 months from the start of therapy, respectively. We conclude that M7 AML with the t(1;22) usually presents in infants with extensive infiltration of abdominal organs by leukemic cells and may confer a poor prognosis despite intensive AML-directed treatment. Identification of this nonrandom translocation exclusively in infants with acute megakaryoblastic leukemia (AMkL) implies that it may serve as an additional diagnostic marker for this disease and links it to the pathogenesis of AMkL in infants.\r"

  ".W": "The biologic effects of interleukin-7 (IL-7) and the expression of specific IL-7 membrane receptors on isolated neoplastic cells from previously untreated patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia as well as acute leukemias were investigated in vitro. Leukemic cells were incubated for up to 6 days with various concentrations of IL-7 (0.01 to 2,000 U/mL). Neoplastic cells of the T- or B-phenotype from chronic as well as from acute leukemias proliferated in a dose-dependent manner. Cells from acute myeloid leukemias also proliferated in response to IL-7. An optimal proliferative effect was achieved between 96 and 120 hours with 200 U/mL IL-7. Combinations of IL-7 with IL-2 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha showed an additive effect on [3H]TdR incorporation. IL-7 binding assays gave a value of approximately 33 to 180 high-affinity (kd approximately 20 pmol/L) binding sites/cell and approximately 241 to 3,280 low-affinity (kd approximately 600 pmol/L) binding sites/cell. Receptor expression correlated with the proliferation in response to IL-7. These data indicate that IL-7 can induce proliferation of relatively mature tumor cells, and that this effect is not restricted to the lymphoid lineage.\r"

  ".W": "This study of 52 Swiss patients with Hodgkin's disease (HD), including 17 cases with a high content of Sternberg-Reed (SR) and Hodgkin (H) cells, was performed to determine the percentage of cases harboring Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) DNA and/or clonal rearrangements of Ig and T-cell antigen receptor (TcR) genes in diagnostic lymph node biopsies. Special attention was drawn to the heavily infiltrated cases to detect a possible relationship between clonality and EBV DNA identification. EBV DNA was detected by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using three different sets of specific primers. The viral origin of the amplification products was confirmed by hybridization with a radiolabeled internal probe or demonstration of a specific Sma I restriction site. Genomic rearrangement of Ig and TcR genes was studied by Southern blot analysis. EBV DNA was identified by PCR in 38 of 48 cases (79%). Clonal rearrangements were identified in only 4 of 52 cases (Ig genes) and were independent of the degree of infiltration by SR cells and the presence of EBV DNA. The absence of EBV DNA in three cases with numerous SR cells (only one of them showed clonal rearrangement) and the presence of only a few viral copies in four further cases with numerous SR cells (semiquantitative analysis of viral DNA by PCR was performed in 26 EBV-positive cases) suggests that this virus is modulating rather than an etiologic agent in a considerable proportion of HD cases.\r"

  ".W": "We studied the nature of blast cells in 41 patients with acute leukemia following a previous primary myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) by a combined multiparameter analysis including morphologic, immunophenotypic, and molecular genetic (Igs, T-cell receptor (TCR)-beta, -gamma, and -delta and the major breakpoint cluster region [M-bcr]) investigations. In addition, the clinical and hematologic characteristics according to the immunophenotype of blast cells were analyzed. Our results show that, although the granulocytic and/or monocytic lineages are those most commonly involved in these acute leukemias, other cell components, including the megakaryocytic and lymphoid, may be present (12% and 15% of the cases, respectively). Moreover, both morphologic and phenotypic studies show the frequent coexistence of two or three cell populations. Interestingly, in all cases the lymphoblastic component constantly displayed an early B phenotype (CD19+, CD10-, TdT+). Upon analyzing whether the type of MDS conditioned any differences in the immunophenotype of blast cells, we observed that, although the lymphoid lineage may be involved in all MDS subgroups, some differences emerge within the myeloid leukemic transformations. Thus, the refractory anemias with excess of blasts (RAEB) and RAEB in transformation displayed a significantly higher incidence of myeloblastic and megakaryoblastic transformations, while in the RA, RA with ring sideroblasts and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia, the granulo-monocytic phenotype predominated. In addition, our results show that the clinical and hematologic characteristics of these patients may be partially related to the immunophenotype of the blast cells. Ig heavy chain gene rearrangements were found in two of 19 patients analyzed (11%), one with a hybrid leukemia (lymphoid-myeloid) and the other with a granulo-monocytic phenotype. Two other hybrid transformations analyzed were in germline configuration. Gamma and delta gene rearrangements were found in 21% and 37% of these acute transformation, respectively. The TCR-beta and M-bcr were in germline configuration in all 19 cases studied. In summary, immunophenotype and molecular studies point to a pluripotent stem cell with preferential myeloid commitment as the target cell of leukemias following a primary MDS.\r"

In situ hybridization was performed on methanol/acetic acid fixed cells of conventional cytogenetic preparations from eight patients and on morphologically and immunologically classified cells of cytospin preparations from seven patients. The results show that trisomy 12 is more common than assumed on the basis of karyotype analysis of metaphase chromosomes: 2 of 13 patients with a normal karyotype in G-banding analysis were shown to have trisomy 12 by interphase cytogenetics. Immunophenotyping of the cells of one patient showed that the trisomy was restricted to cells with Ig light chain clonality. For the evaluation of the prognostic, therapeutic, and biologic significance of trisomy 12, in situ hybridization should be used in parallel with karyotype analysis because it allows the study of all cell populations of both interphase and mitotic cells, whether neoplastic or normal.\r"

Two cases showed the presence of mutations or small rearrangements at the 3' end of the first exon. The c-myc gene abnormalities found in these two cases are similar to those observed in the translocation 8;14 of the endemic Burkitt's lymphomas or in its variants t(2;8) and t(8;22). A third case showed a major rearrangement of c-myc gene, with truncation within its first intron, similar to those observed in sporadic Burkitt's and in acquired immunodeficiency-associated lymphomas. None of the cases displayed bcl-2 gene rearrangements or contained viral sequences. Our data suggest a possible role for a translocation-mediated c-myc activation in the pathogenesis of MLCL. Conversely, bcl-2 gene and Epstein-Barr virus do not appear to be involved in the pathogenesis of these peculiar lymphomas. The association between c-myc structural modifications and MLCL also seems to be of relevance in light of the peculiar tendency of this tumor to involve unusual extranodal site (eg, kidney), reminiscent of the spreading attitude of Burkitt's limphomas.\r"

  ".U": "91316295\r", 
  ".W": "The nature of the cooperation between platelets and tumor cells during the process of blood-borne metastasis is essentially unknown. In previous in vitro studies we showed that platelets participated in the formation of gaps in the endothelial cell lining, and that concomitantly heparan sulfate glycosaminoglycans were degraded by the platelet heparitinase, released on activation of platelets. In the current study we show that the ability to degrade proteoheparan sulfate derived from endothelial extracellular matrix is gradually eliminated when the number of human platelets is decreased from 5 x 10(7) to 10(6) cells/mL. When aliquots of conditioned media or lysates of either Eb or heat-inactivated ESb mouse lymphoma cells (both of which showed no heparanase activity) were added to freeze-thawed lysates of 10(6) platelets, a reappearance of platelet heparitinase activity was observed. A similar activation was not elicited by lysates of several normal mammalian cells. These data suggest that in its native form, a fraction of the platelet heparitinase is stored in an inactive form that can be activated by a factor secreted by lymphoma, but not by normal cells. Partial characterization of the heparitinase-activating factor showed that it is a heat-stable polyanionic molecule, devoid of proteolytic activity and resistant to both proteolytic and chondroitinase digestions. Activation of platelet heparitinase was also observed on coincubation with chondroitinases ABC and AC, suggesting that the inactive form of platelet heparitinase could result from a complex formation with a chondroitinase-sensitive proteoglycan. The lymphoma-derived heparitinase activating factor itself is, however, not a chondroitinase, because activity of chondroitinase could not be detected in Eb and ESb cells. A possible mechanism by which tumor cells recruit and regulate the activity of platelet heparitinase, and its relevance to the progression of blood borne metastasis, is discussed.\r"

  ".W": "A patient is described who presented with a chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and later developed a lymphoblastic lymphoma. The cells from the CLL were typical mature B lymphocytes as could be assessed by morphologic, cytochemical, and surface marker analyses. The cells from the lymphoblastic lymphoma were immature B cells that expressed CD10, CD20, and HLA-DR markers, but not surface Ig or cytoplasmic mu chains, and were negative for terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT). The cells of two continuous cell lines, obtained from the bone marrow and the peripheral blood of the patient, had the same phenotype as the lymphoblastic lymphoma cells, did not contain the Epstein-Barr virus genome, and displayed malignant features in vitro, including the capacity to form colonies in agar. The two cell lines also shared identical chromosomal abnormalities, a finding which suggests that they derived from the same malignant cell already present in vivo. Such chromosomal abnormalities were not seen in the karyotype of the peripheral blood cells at the onset of the disease. Analysis of the Ig heavy chain genes using a DJ-specific probe showed the very same monoclonal rearrangement in the cells from the B-CLL, the lymphoblastic lymphoma and the two cell lines, thus demonstrating their common clonal origin. By contrast, a monoclonal rearrangement of the lambda chain gene locus was found in the B-CLL cells only, a finding consistent with their exclusive capacity to express surface IgM lambda. This patient represents a rare case in whom a chronic lymphoproliferative disorder with mature malignant cells transforms into a lymphoblastic lymphoma characterized by cells frozen at a very early maturational stage. The possible mechanisms leading to such transformation within the same cell clone are discussed.\r"

  ".W": "Neutrophil adhesion to interleukin-1 (IL-1)-stimulated human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) involves the CD18 family of leukocyte integrins (lymphocyte function-associated antigen-1 [LFA-1], Mac-1, and p150,95) and LECAM-1 (DREG-56/LEU-8/LAM-1 antigen) on neutrophils and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and endothelial leukocyte adhesion molecule-1 (ELAM-1) on the endothelium. In this study, we compare CD18-independent adhesion pathways mediated by neutrophil LECAM-1 and endothelial ELAM-1 and find that these two pathways overlap in a variety of assays: (1) anti-LECAM-1 and anti-ELAM-1 monoclonal antibody (MoAb) inhibit neutrophil binding to HUVEC, and the inhibitory effect is not additive; (2) anti-LECAM-1 MoAb, like anti-ELAM-1 MoAb, inhibits neutrophil binding to HUVEC stimulated for 3 hours with IL-1, but not to HUVEC stimulated for 8 hours, by which time ELAM-1 expression is downregulated; (3) anti-ELAM-1 MoAb has no effect on transendothelial migration, a CD18-dependent, LECAM-1-independent neutrophil function. Interestingly, anti-ELAM MoAb has a reduced but significant inhibitory effect on the adhesion of activated neutrophils that have shed their cell-surface LECAM-1. We also show that neutrophil binding to ELAM-1-transfected L cells is inhibited not only by anti-ELAM-1 but also by anti-LECAM-1 MoAb. These results suggest that LECAM-1 and ELAM-1 can operate in the same adhesion pathway, possibly as a receptor-counterreceptor pair. LECAM-1 and ELAM-1 are likely to interact with other ligands as well, perhaps through carbohydrate determinants that modify more than one glycoprotein.\r"

  ".W": "The occurrence of rosetting of Plasmodium falciparum-infected human red blood cells (IRBC) with uninfected red blood cells (RBC) and its potential pathophysiologic consequences were investigated under flow conditions using the perfused rat mesocecum vasculature. Perfusion experiments were performed using two knobby (K+) lines of P falciparum, ie, rosetting positive (K+R+) and rosetting negative (K+R-). The infusion of K+R+ IRBC resulted in higher peripheral resistance (PRU) than K+R- IRBC (P less than .0012). Video microscopy showed that under conditions of flow, in addition to cytoadherence of K+R+ IRBC to the venular endothelium, rosette formation was also restricted to venules, especially in the areas of slow flow. Rosettes were absent in arterioles and were presumably dissociated by higher wall shear rates. The presence of rosettes in the venules must therefore reflect their rapid reformation after disruption. Cytoadherence of K+R+ IRBC was characterized by formation of focal clusters along the venular wall. In addition, large aggregates of RBC were frequently observed at venular junctions, probably as a result of interaction between flowing rosettes, free IRBC, and uninfected RBC. In contrast, the infusion of K+R+ IRBC resulted in diffuse cytoadherence of these cells exclusively to the venular endothelium but not in rosetting or large aggregate formation. The cytoadherence of K+R+ IRBC showed strong inverse correlation with the venular diameter (r = -.856, P less than .00001). Incubation of K+R+ IRBC with heparin and with monoclonal antibodies to glycoprotein IV/CD36 abolished the rosette formation and resulted in decreased PRU and microvascular blockage. These findings demonstrate that rosetting of K+R+ IRBC with uninfected RBC enhances vasocclusion, suggesting an important in vivo role for rosetting in the microvascular sequestration of P falciparum-infected RBC.\r"

  ".U": "91316299\r", 
  ".W": "When incubated in acidified serum, the erythrocytes of paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) are hemolyzed through activation of the alternative pathway of complement (APC), but normal erythrocytes are resistant to this process. PNH cells are deficient in decay-accelerating factor (DAF), a complement regulatory protein that inhibits the activity of both the classical and the alternative pathways. However, deficiency of DAF alone does not account entirely for the aberrant effects of acidified serum on PNH cells. Recently, we have shown that PNH erythrocytes are also deficient in another complement control protein called membrane inhibitor of reactive lysis (MIRL) that restricts complement-mediated lysis by blocking formation of the membrane attack complex (MAC). To determine the effects of the DAF and MIRL on susceptibility to acidified serum lysis, PNH cells were repleted with the purified proteins. DAF partially inhibited acidified serum lysis by blocking the activity of the amplification C3 convertase. MIRL inhibited acidified serum lysis both by blocking the activity of the MAC and by inhibiting the activity the C3 convertase. When DAF function was blocked with antibody, normal erythrocytes became partially susceptible to acidified serum lysis. By blocking MIRL, cells were made completely susceptible to lysis, and control of C3 convertase activity was partially lost. When both DAF and MIRL were blocked, the capacity of normal erythrocytes to control the activity of the APC and the MAC was destroyed, and the cells hemolyzed even in unacidified serum. These studies demonstrate that DAF and MIRL act in concert to control susceptibility to acidified serum lysis; of the two proteins, MIRL is the more important. In addition to its regulatory effects on the MAC, MIRL also influences the activity of the C3 convertase of the APC. Further, in the absence of DAF and MIRL, the plasma regulators (factor H and factor I) lack the capacity to control membrane-associated activation of the APC.\r"

  ".W": "Sixteen patients with relapsed non-Hodgkin's lymphoma underwent autologous bone marrow transplantation and infusion of recombinant human granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (rhGM-CSF). Treatment consisted of involved-field radiotherapy, cyclophosphamide 60 mg/kg/d intravenously (IV) for 2 days, and fractionated total body irradiation (1,200 cGy). Autologous bone marrow was thawed and infused IV, followed 3 hours later by the first infusion of IV rhGM-CSF 11 micrograms/kg/d over 4 hours. Infusions of rhGM-CSF were continued daily until either both neutrophil count exceeded 1,500/microL and platelet count exceeded 50,000/microL, or until 30 days after marrow re-infusion. Toxicities encountered were mild and included fever, chills, hypertension, alopecia, rash, diarrhea, stomatitis, myalgias, and synovial (knee) effusions. Neutrophil recovery greater than 500/microL occurred a median of 14 days (range, 9 to 30 days) after marrow infusion, significantly earlier than in a comparable group of historic controls who recovered counts at a median time of 20 days (range, 12 to 51 days) (P = .00002). Median time to self-sustaining platelet counts greater than 20,000/microL was 23.5 days (range, 12 to 100 days), comparable with the historic group (P = .38). One bacteremia (central venous catheter exit site infection with Staphylococcus epidermidis) and one local infection (Giardia lamblia in stool) occurred. Patients received a median of 11.4 (range, 4.4 to 20.2) x 10(4) colony-forming unit granulocyte-macrophage (CFU-GM) progenitors per kg. Stem cell progenitors CFU-GM, CFU-granulocyte, erythroid, monocyte, megakaryocyte (CFU-GEMM), and burst-forming unit-erythroid (BFU-E) were detected in the bone marrow as early as 7 days after marrow re-infusion, and increased in proportion to peripheral blood counts, but by 30 to 60 days still remained much lower than before transplant. Neutrophils transiently decreased in 13 of 16 patients (median decrease, 42%) within 24 to 72 hours of discontinuing rhGM-CSF infusions. These data suggest that rhGM-CSF therapy enhances neutrophil recovery by forcing stem cells to produce mature elements at an enhanced rate but may not affect marrow stem cell and early progenitor population sizes.\r"

For 71 patients in first complete remission, 23 in second complete remission or initial relapse, and 33 patients with primary refractory disease, second or subsequent relapse, or a preceding hematologic disorder, the 3-year leukemia-free survival (LFS) is 63.1%, 32.6%, and 24.2% respectively. The actuarial probability of relapse for each group is 14.1%, 40.6%, and 61.0%. In multivariate analyses, relapse and decreased LFS were associated with advanced disease phase and with M4/M5 French-American-British classification. The LFS of first remission patients was adversely associated with a short time interval from diagnosis to transplantation. This study indicates that BuCy2 is an attractive preparative regimen for marrow transplantation in patients with AML and that prognostic factors for relapse and LFS are similar those described for regimens containing total body irradiation.\r"

  ".W": "The pathogenic effect of cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection on the hematopoietic recovery after bone marrow transplantation (BMT) was retrospectively studied in 87 recipients of (nonpurged) autologous BMT and in 56 recipients of allogeneic BMT from HLA-identical siblings. Indications for autologous BMT were lymphomas or acute leukemias and for allogeneic BMT various malignancies or aplastic anemia. Patients were divided for the study in two groups, CMV-positive and CMV-negative on the basis of the CMV status pretransplant, and CMV-negative patients were kept CMV-negative by the local transfusion policy. In allogeneic BMT recipients, platelet recovery was significantly slower in CMV-positive patients than in CMV-negative patients (platelets greater than 50,000 cells/microL after 41 days v 27 days, P = .007). This difference held true when patients with acute graft-versus-host disease above grade I were excluded (platelets greater than 50,000 cells/microL after 42 days v 24 days, P = .01). In autologous BMT, the negative effect on platelet recovery was present in patients with lymphomas, but absent in patients with acute leukemias. Patients with acute leukemias had a very delayed recovery of platelets and granulocytes after autologous BMT, irrespective of the CMV status, probably due to the original stem cell disorder. Platelet recovery was significantly slower in CMV-positive autologous BMT recipients with lymphomas than in those not infected (platelets greater than 50,000 cells/microL after 36 days v 24 days, P = .0002). The presence of CMV infection had no effect on the recovery of granulocytes in autologous or allogeneic BMT. These data show that CMV infection causes delayed platelet recovery after BMT; however, in autologous BMT, the underlying disease (ie, acute leukemia) is more determinant for hematopoiesis after BMT.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE--To determine if the use of the injectable contraceptive depot medroxyprogesterone (DMPA), which reduces ovarian oestrogen production, is associated with changes in bone density. DESIGN--Population study. DMPA users were compared with two control groups selected from larger population studies and individually matched for several putative determinants of bone density (age, race, body mass index, and years of oestrogen deficiency). Controls and DMPA users were matched without prior knowledge of their bone density measurements. SETTING--Teaching hospital and community family planning clinics. SUBJECTS--30 current users of DMPA with a minimum five years' previous use, 30 premenopausal controls, and 30 postmenopausal controls. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE--Lumbar spine and femoral neck bone mineral density assessed by dual energy x ray absorptiometry. RESULTS--Compared with premenopausal controls matched for age, race, and body mass index, DMPA users had significantly reduced bone density in the lumbar spine (mean difference 7.5% (95% confidence interval 1.9% to 13.1%), p = 0.002) and in the femoral neck (6.6%, (0.8% to 12.3%), p = 0.007). Compared with postmenopausal controls matched for body mass index and duration of oestrogen deficiency, DMPA users had greater bone density in the lumbar spine (8.9% (4.3% to 13.5%), p = 0.001), but in the femoral neck the difference in bone density was less (4.0% (-0.4% to 8.5%), p = 0.04). CONCLUSIONS--Women using DMPA have bone density values intermediate between those of normal premenopausal and postmenopausal controls; thus, the degree of oestrogen deficiency induced by DMPA may have an adverse effect on bone density.\r"

DESIGN--Cross sectional survey of eating habits and attitudes in diabetic and non-diabetic subjects. SETTING--Outpatient clinic catering for young adults with diabetes; community sample of non-diabetic women drawn from the lists of two general practices. SUBJECTS--100 patients with insulin dependent diabetes (54 women and 46 men) aged 17-25 and 67 non-diabetic women of the same age. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Eating habits and eating disorder psychopathology were assessed by standardised research interview adapted for the assessment of patients with diabetes (eating disorder examination). Glycaemic control was assessed by glycated haemoglobin assay. RESULTS--In both non-diabetic and diabetic women disturbed eating was common, and in diabetic women the degree of disturbance was related to control of glycaemia. Twenty of the diabetic women (37%) had omitted or underused insulin to influence their weight. This behaviour was not restricted to those with a clinical eating disorder. None of the men showed any features of eating disorders, and none had misused insulin to influence their weight. CONCLUSIONS--There was no evidence that clinical eating disorders are more prevalent in young women with diabetes than in non-diabetic women. Nevertheless, disturbed eating is common and is associated with poor control of glycaemia, and the misuse of insulin to influence body weight is also common in young women with diabetes.\r"

DESIGN--Follow up study of all singleton live births born to primigravidas living in Dundee and booked into antenatal clinics from 1 May 1985 to 30 April 1986. SETTING--District of Dundee. SUBJECTS--846 children aged 18 months, of whom 592 attended for assessment. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Scores on Bayley scales of infant mental and motor development. RESULTS--For full term children, maternal alcohol consumption was not significantly related to any adverse effect on the children's mental or motor development measures at age 18 months. After confounding factors had been controlled for, alcohol consumption before pregnancy and after pregnancy was significantly related to better motor performance and mental performance. CONCLUSION--Pregnant women probably need not abstain from alcohol altogether as no detectable adverse relation was found between the child's mental and physical development and the mother's weekly consumption at levels in excess of 100g absolute alcohol. However, to allow for a margin of safety and taking into account the findings of an earlier phase of this study on the immediate effects on the newborn, it is recommended that pregnant women should drink no more than eight units of alcohol a week, the equivalent of about one drink a day.\r"

DESIGN--Multilevel model of immunisation status against six measures of patient characteristics (level 1 predictor variables) with practice constraints as level 2 variables. SETTING--126 practices in southern England. SUBJECTS--2048 infants identified from infant surveillance and immunisation records. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Top 10 practices with respect to uptake of pertussis immunisation according to a \"null\" model (model A) and according to a model that included six level 1 variables (model B); differences in ranking between the two models. RESULTS--Practices with low numbers of infants' requiring immunisation had imprecise and unstable uptake rates (range 0%-100%). With the multilevel procedure, after controlling for patient characteristics, practices in suburban catchment areas comprised largely of mature or young professionals performed best. Most improved performances when patient characteristics were taken into account were in practices in areas with a stable population and local authority housing--one such practice improved its ranking by 47 places. CONCLUSIONS--Crude uptake rates are inadequate performance indicators. Alternative approaches suggest that praiseworthy efforts to raise immunisation rates in unpromising areas are unrewarded by simple target based assessments.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE--To assess the effectiveness of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition in preventing the development of diabetic nephropathy (albuminuria greater than 300 mg/24h). DESIGN--Open randomised controlled study of four years' duration. SETTING--Outpatient diabetic clinic in tertiary referral centre. PATIENTS--44 normotensive (mean blood pressure 127/78 (SD 12/10) mm Hg) insulin dependent diabetic patients with persistent microalbuminuria (30-300 mg/24h). INTERVENTIONS--The treatment group (n = 21) was initially given captopril (25 mg/24 h). The dose was increased to 100 mg/24 h during the first 16 months and thiazide was added after 30 months. The remaining 23 patients were left untreated. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Albuminuria, kidney function, development of diabetic nephropathy (albuminuria greater than 300 mg/24 h), and arterial blood pressure. RESULTS--Clinical and laboratory variables were comparable at baseline. Urinary excretion of albumin was gradually reduced from 82 (66-106) to 57 (39-85) mg/24 h (geometric mean (95% confidence interval)) in the captopril treated group, whereas an increase from 105(77-153) to 166 (83-323) mg/24 h occurred in the control group (p less than 0.05). Seven of the untreated patients progressed to diabetic nephropathy, whereas none of the captopril treated patients developed clinical overt diabetic nephropathy (p less than 0.05). Systemic blood pressure, glomerular filtration rate, haemoglobin A1c concentration, and urinary excretion of sodium and urea remained practically unchanged in the two groups. CONCLUSIONS--The findings suggest that angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition postpones the development of clinical overt diabetic nephropathy in normotensive insulin dependent diabetic patients with persistent microalbuminuria.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE--To explore the extent to which the relation between plasma cholesterol concentration and risk of death from coronary heart disease in men persists into old age. DESIGN--18 year follow up of male Whitehall civil servants. Plasma cholesterol concentrations and other risk factors were determined at first examination in 1967-9 when they were aged 40-69. Death of men up to 31 January 1987 was recorded. SUBJECTS--18,296 male civil servants, 4155 of whom died during follow up. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Cause and age of death. Cholesterol concentration in 1967-9 and number of years elapsed between testing and death. RESULTS--1676 men died of coronary heart disease. The mean cholesterol concentration in these men was 0.32 mmol/l higher than that in all other men (95% confidence interval 0.26 to 0.37 mmol/l). This difference in cholesterol concentrations fell 0.15 mmol/l with every 10 years' increase in age at screening. The risk of raised cholesterol concentration fell with age at death. Compared with other men cholesterol concentration in those who died of coronary heart disease was 0.44 mmol/l higher in those who died aged less than 60 and 0.26 mmol/l higher in those aged 60-79 (p = 0.03). For a given age at death the longer the gap between cholesterol measurement and death the more predictive the cholesterol concentration, both for coronary heart disease and all cause mortality (trend test p = 0.06 and 0.03 respectively). CONCLUSION--Reducing plasma cholesterol concentrations in middle age may influence the risk of death from coronary heart disease in old age.\r"

RESULTS--The level of computerisation varied from 11 (85%) of practices in Powys Family Health Services Authority to 22 (40%) in Mid Glamorgan. Less than half of practices had a computer in only two authorities. The commonest uses of the computer were for patient registration (208 practices), repeat prescribing (180), call and recall of patients (165), and partial clinical records (122). The main suppliers were VAMP (78 practices), AAH Meditel (46), and AMC (23). 102 of 226 practices with a computer had a terminal on each doctor's desk. Just 33 practices had full patient notes on computer and 51 had modems for electronic communication. CONCLUSION--Mechanisms to encourage greater and more sophisticated use of computers and information technology need to be explored.\r"

DESIGN--Retrospective case note review of all homosexual and bisexual men presenting to a genitourinary clinic as new patients during 12 months in 1988 and follow up review of notes to May 1990. SETTING--One department of genitourinary medicine, Middlesex Hospital. PATIENTS--758 homosexual or bisexual men, of whom 207 started a course of hepatitis B vaccine in 1988. Case notes were unavailable for one patient. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--The proportion of patients screened for hepatitis B virus markers, the proportion of susceptible patients immunised, the proportion completing the vaccine course, and the proportion rendered immune. RESULTS--25 men had been previously tested for hepatitis markers; of the 732 not previously tested, 440 (60.1%) were screened for hepatitis B markers. 207 (69%) of the 300 patients without hepatitis B serological markers started the vaccine course, and 141 (68%) completed it, with 75 (84%) of the 89 tested after immunisation being immune. An estimated 24% of susceptible new patients were rendered immune as a result of the immunisation policy. Patients who presented with a further episode of a sexually transmitted disease were more likely to have been screened (25% v 12%, p less than 0.0001) and immunised (31% v 18% p = 0.02); those known or found to be positive for HIV antibody were more likely to have been screened (23% v 14%, p = 0.047) but less likely to have been immunised (6% v 17%, p = 0.004). CONCLUSIONS--The major failure was that in not screening; failure to immunise patients found to be susceptible and failure of compliance with the vaccine course contributed. Non-response to the vaccine was of minor importance. Improvements in vaccine delivery are required. IMPLICATIONS--Other providers should be encouraged to review their performance.\r"

SETTING: Children's Hospital, Winnipeg. PATIENTS: Patients were selected by three methods: laboratory tests designed to screen patients suspected of having a metabolic disease, laboratory investigation of newborn infants with abnormalities detected through screening, and investigation of near relatives of probands with disease. RESULTS: A total of 138 patients with organic acid, amino acid and carbohydrate disorders were seen from 1960 to 1990. Of these, 49 (36%) were native Indians (Algonkian linguistic group). This was in sharp contrast to the proportion of native Indians in the total study population (5.8%). Congenital lactic acidosis due to pyruvate carboxylase deficiency (13 patients), glutaric aciduria type I (14 patients) and primary hyperoxaluria type II (8 patients) were the most common disorders detected. Other rare disorders included glutaric aciduria type II (one patient), 2-hydroxyglutaric aciduria (one patient) and sarcosinemia (one patient). Underreporting, especially of glutaric aciduria type I and hyperoxaluria type II, was likely in the native population. CONCLUSIONS: Hereditary metabolic diseases are greatly overrepresented in the native population of Manitoba and northwestern Ontario. We recommend that native children who present with illnesses involving disturbances of acid-base balance or with neurologic, renal or liver disease of unknown cause by investigated for a possible metabolic disorder.\r"

  ".W": "The diversity of biologically active molecules produced by vascular endothelium suggests that the endothelial cell is an active participant in numerous physiological responses, including those of the immune system. In fact, the accumulation of T lymphocytes at extralymphatic inflammatory foci represents a series of interactions between lymphocytes and vascular endothelial cells. These interactions, however, may be modulated by other factors, such as vasoactive amines. In the current study, we report that serotonin-stimulated cultured bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAECs) secrete a T-lymphocyte chemotactic cytokine (endothelial cell-derived lymphocyte chemotactic activity [ED-LCA]). Supernatants from BAECs incubated with 10(-7)-10(-4) M serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine [5-HT]) enhanced T-cell migration, which peaked at 10(-5) M 5-HT (235 +/- 18% control migration). ED-LCA was not stored in an active form in BAECs; its secretion occurred within 60 minutes of exposure to 5-HT and was blocked by two different 5-HT2 receptor antagonists. ED-LCA was not secreted after exposure of BAECs to histamine or angiotensin II, nor was it secreted by either 5-HT-stimulated bovine pulmonary arterial or human umbilical vein endothelial cells. Physicochemical characterization of ED-LCA demonstrated that it was a trypsin-sensitive protein with an apparent molecular mass of 13-15 kDa. Preparative isoelectric focusing demonstrated pIs of 6.0 and 7.5. When applied to a molecular sieve column, the chemotactic activity corresponding to these pIs eluted in the region of 13-15 kDa. Further investigation demonstrated that partially purified ED-LCA was specific for CD4+ and CD8+ T-lymphocyte subsets and did not enhance the migration of neutrophils or monocytes.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The purpose of this study was to determine the expression of genes encoding various sarcoplasmic reticulum components that are functionally coupled with calcium release, uptake, and storage function during cardiac hypertrophy induced by thyroid hormone. Hyperthyroidism was induced in two groups of rabbits by the injection of 200 micrograms/kg L-thyroxine (T4) daily for 4 days (T4-4-day group) and 8 days (T4-8-day group). Hypothyroidism was induced in another group of rabbits by adding 0.8 mg/ml propylthiouracil to the drinking water for 4 weeks. The relative expression level of mRNA encoding different sarcoplasmic reticulum proteins was determined by RNA slot blot and Northern blot analysis. In hyperthyroid hearts, the steady-state level of cardiac ryanodine receptor mRNA and sarcoplasmic reticulum cardiac/slow-twitch Ca(2+)-ATPase mRNA were both increased to 147% (T4-4-day group) and 186% (T4-8-day group) of control, respectively, but decreased to 71% and 75%, respectively, in hypothyroid ventricles. The mRNA level for phospholamban was decreased in both hyperthyroidism (T4-8-day group, 72%) and hypothyroidism (77%) in these hearts. On the other hand, calsequestrin mRNA levels did not change in hyperthyroid and hypothyroid ventricles. In accord with the changes in Ca(2+)-ATPase mRNA levels, the Ca(2+)-ATPase protein was increased to 199% (T4-8-day group) in hyperthyroid ventricles and decreased to 86% of control in hypothyroid ventricles. The expression levels of ryanodine receptor, Ca(2+)-ATPase, phospholamban, and calsequestrin mRNAs were similarly altered in skeletal muscle tissues from hyperthyroid and hypothyroid rabbits. These results indicate that the mRNA levels of sarcoplasmic reticulum proteins responsible for calcium release and calcium uptake are coordinately regulated in response to changes in thyroid hormone level in both heart and skeletal muscle. These changes in mRNA level should lead to changes in protein levels and thus to altered calcium release and uptake in the chronic stages of hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism.\r"

  ".W": "The present study investigates the possibility that the slow calcium current of human atrial cardiac cells is modified by chronic treatment (1-24 months) with calcium antagonists (nifedipine, nicardipine, or diltiazem) in a manner different from a simple drug-induced blocking effect. Data from treated patients were recorded approximately 30 hours after cessation of the treatment and were compared with those of nontreated patients. In the treated group, the action potential plateau of atrial fibers was always markedly and irreversibly depressed, and action potential duration measured at 50% repolarization was markedly shortened (81 +/- 12 msec, n = 13) compared with normal values (155 +/- 9 msec, n = 28). In isolated atrial cells, peak calcium current density at +10 mV in treated cells was more than three times as small as that in nontreated cells. Steady-state inactivation relations of calcium current as a function of membrane potential were not significantly different in treated and nontreated cells. In contrast, in treated and nontreated cells superfused with 10(-6) M nifedipine, the curves were markedly shifted toward negative potentials. Cell superfusion with 10(-6) M Bay K 8644 increased calcium current to a larger extent in nontreated cells (sixfold increase) than in treated cells (threefold increase), whereas a 23-fold increase was observed in nontreated cells in which the current had been previously depressed by superfusion with 10(-6) M nifedipine. In contrast to Bay K 8644, 10(-7) M isoproterenol and 10(-8) M angiotensin II increased the calcium current to the same extent in both treated and nontreated groups.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The actions of endothelin on the contractile and twitch configuration characteristics of rat and rabbit papillary muscles were evaluated before and after endocardial endothelium removal. In rabbit papillary muscles, endothelin produced a dose-dependent (10(-11) to 10(-7) M) increase in tension (T) (from 2.7 +/- 0.2 to 8.9 +/- 0.7 g/mm2, p less than 0.01), dT/dt, and Vmax (from 1.14 +/- 0.03 to 3.0 +/- 0.13 Lmax/sec, p less than 0.01), a decrease in time to peak tension (from 251 +/- 9 to 216 +/- 7 msec, p less than 0.05), and an increase in time to half relaxation (from 168 +/- 9 to 293 +/- 14 msec, p less than 0.01). Increasing calcium concentration in the bath from 1.25 to 15 mM greatly attenuated these changes. In the presence of propranolol (10(-5) M), endothelin increased all indexes of contractility but to a lesser extent (T = 2.6 +/- 0.3 to 6.5 +/- 0.2 g/mm2, p less than 0.01; Vmax = 1.16 +/- 0.10 to 2.06 +/- 0.10 Lmax/sec, p less than 0.01). Myocardial catecholamine depletion with reserpine had effects similar to those of propranolol. The myocardial contractile and twitch configuration characteristics of endothelin were similar to those of phenylephrine (10(-4) M), a strong stimulator of the phosphatidylinositol pathway and a moderate beta-adrenergic stimulator. The effects of phenylephrine and endothelin were modified in a similar manner by propranolol (10(-5) M). The presence of nicardipine (3 X 10(-7) M) decreased the absolute increase in contractility caused by endothelin but did not alter the percent change or shift the dose-response curve of endothelin. The actions of endothelin in rat papillary muscles studied at physiological calcium concentrations (Ca2+ = 1.25 mM) were less marked than those of rabbit studied at physiological calcium (Ca2+ = 1.25 mM) but similar to those of rabbit studied at high calcium concentrations (Ca2+ = 15 mM). Removing the endocardial endothelial layer of rabbit papillary muscles did not alter the absolute changes in contractility caused by endothelin but shifted the dose-response curve to the left and markedly altered the effects of endothelin on twitch configuration characteristics. Thus, it would appear that endothelin increases contractility and modifies twitch configuration. It does so more at lower rather than higher extracellular calcium concentrations and in a species, such as rabbit, that responds more to interventions that increase intracellular calcium.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "In open-chest dogs, cyclic flow reductions (CFRs, 5.1-6.6/hr in controls; n = 24) caused by platelet deposition/dislodgment at sites of endothelial cell injury in critically stenosed left anterior descending coronary arteries (59% flow reduction) were attenuated to the same extent either by single thromboxane A2 (TXA2) synthase inhibition (0.31 mg/kg i.v. ridogrel; CFR, 0.16 +/- 0.16/hr; n = 6; p less than 0.05) or by a comparatively modest degree of TXA2/prostaglandin endoperoxide receptor antagonism on top of TXA2 synthase inhibition (5 mg/kg i.v. ridogrel; CFR, 0.22 +/- 0.1/hr; n = 10; p less than 0.05). By contrast, occlusive thrombosis on deep vascular damage elicited by intraluminal stimulation (150-microA anodal constant current) in nonpreconstricted canine coronary arteries (time to occlusion, 237.1 +/- 13.9 minutes; n = 7; incidence of occlusion within 300 minutes, six of seven experiments) was not affected by platelet cyclooxygenase inhibition (5 mg/kg i.v. acetylsalicylic acid; n = 7), single TXA2 synthase inhibition (1.25 mg/kg i.v. ridogrel; n = 7), or single TXA2/prostaglandin endoperoxide receptor antagonism (10 mg/kg + 10 mg/kg/hr i.v. sulotroban for 300 minutes; n = 5). However, such an occlusive thrombus formation was significantly reduced by combined TXA2 synthase/prostaglandin endoperoxide receptor inhibition (5 mg/kg i.v. ridogrel; time to occlusion greater than 300 minutes, n = 7; incidence of occlusion within 300 minutes, one of seven experiments; p less than 0.05). This study reveals 1) a differential efficacy of TXA2 synthase inhibition, singly or combined with TXA2/prostaglandin endoperoxide receptor antagonism, depending on the extent of the vessel wall lesion triggering thrombosis and the size of the thrombus required to obstruct the vascular lumen and 2) a significant synergism in preventing occlusive thrombosis of extensively damaged coronary arteries between strong TXA2 synthase inhibition and comparatively modest TXA2/prostaglandin endoperoxide receptor antagonism with ridogrel.\r"

  ".W": "Effects of cGMP on the slow (L-type) Ca2+ channels of cultured chick embryonic cardiomyocytes were investigated by a cell-attached patch-clamp method. Superfusion of the single cells with 8-bromo-cGMP, a membrane-permeable derivative of cGMP, inhibited the single-channel activity. The cyclic nucleotide decreased, in a concentration-dependent manner, the ensemble averaged currents obtained from multichannel patches. 8-Bromo-cGMP (1 mM) completely abolished the currents (n = 8), whereas 0.1 mM only slightly decreased the currents (n = 4). The influence of cGMP on the characteristics of the single Ca2+ channels was examined using 0.3 mM 8-bromo-cGMP. Unit amplitude and slope conductance of the Ca2+ channel was not changed (25 pS in control versus 24 pS in the presence of cGMP). Analysis of single-channel kinetics showed that cGMP prolonged the slow time constant for the closed-time histogram (from 6.7 to 15.4 msec); the other time constants (for the open-time and closed-time histograms) were not affected. cGMP-induced inhibition of the Ca2+ channels may be mediated by cGMP-dependent protein kinase, because 8-bromo-cGMP is a potent activator of this protein kinase and does not stimulate cAMP hydrolysis. The present results suggest that cGMP opposes the effects of cAMP on the L-type Ca2+ channels in myocardial cells.\r"

  ".W": "Calsequestrin is a calcium-binding protein known to sequester calcium accumulated in the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) of muscle cells during relaxation. In the present study, we used affinity-purified antibodies to chicken cardiac calsequestrin to identify a 60,000-Da calsequestrin in frog myocardium. Like previously identified cardiac calsequestrins, it is enriched in cardiac microsomes, it is enriched by biochemical procedures previously used to purify cardiac and skeletal calsequestrins, and it exhibits a pH-dependent shift in its apparent Mr on a two-dimensional gel system. Finally, the NH2-terminal amino acid sequence of this 60,000-Da immunoreactive protein purified by fast protein liquid chromatography was identical to that of rabbit skeletal and canine cardiac calsequestrin. Thus, we conclude that this protein corresponds to the calsequestrin isoform in frog ventricular muscle. Frog calsequestrin was localized in discrete foci present at the periphery but absent from the central regions of frog ventricular myocytes as determined by immunofluorescence labeling. Immunoelectron microscopic labeling demonstrated that calsequestrin was confined to the lumen of two structurally distinct regions of the SR, where it was localized in the subsarcolemmal region of the myofibers. One of these appeared to correspond to the terminal SR previously reported to be closely apposed to the sarcolemma of frog myofibers. The other region, although close to the sarcolemma, was not physically joined to it and appeared to correspond to corbular SR. It generally is believed that frog cardiac SR does not provide activator Ca2+ required for excitation-contraction coupling. However, the identification of a calsequestrin isoform very similar to mammalian cardiac calsequestrin that is confined to specialized regions of frog cardiac SR lends support to the idea that frog cardiac SR has the ability to store Ca2+ and thus function in some capacity in frog cardiac muscle contraction.\r"

Thus, we studied the effect in rats of basic FGF infused for 14 days onto the adventitia or into the media in vivo. In untreated rats, the adventitial layer is uniform, and few vessels are observed in cross sections (mean +/- SEM is 0.351 +/- 0.16 capillaries/field at a magnification of x 480). Whereas saline infusion increases the mean number of vasa vasorum to 2.73 +/- 0.011 capillaries/field (p less than 0.01), basic FGF (1 ng/microliter/hr) increases the capillary number to 13.4 +/- 0.67 capillaries/field. The effects are local and restricted to the site of delivery; no cell proliferation is observed even 2 mm from the site of infusion. There is also no evidence of the infiltration of macrophages and monocytes. In an effort to determine the effect of basic FGF in the media, a small longitudinal (1-mm) incision was made in the adventitia, and saline or basic FGF (1 ng/microliter/hr) was infused for 14 days into the arterial wall. Under these conditions, basic FGF is a potent inducer of smooth muscle cell proliferation in the vascular wall as well as of new capillaries. In these instances, however, the capillaries formed are thick-walled. The results support the hypothesis that basic FGF may be contributing to the growth and maintenance of the vasa vasorum and of vascular smooth muscle cells.\r"

A monoclonal antibody against endothelin 1 (AwETN40) suppressed changes induced by endothelin 1 and endothelin 2 but did not modify those by endothelin 3 in vivo or in vitro. Effects of AwETN40 on myocardial infarct size were investigated. Coronary ligation (1 hour) and reperfusion (24 hours) in rats caused infarction in 35% of the left ventricle. Repetitive or single administration of AwETN40 reduced the infarct size; an intravenous injection of 22.5 mg/kg of the antibody 5 minutes after coronary occlusion or 5 minutes before reperfusion reduced the size by 38% or 31% of the control, respectively. Plasma and tissue endothelin 1 and plasma big endothelin 1 in rats were measured at various stages after occlusion. Plasma endothelin 1 showed a fourfold increase 10 minutes after reperfusion (from 1.02 to 3.96 pg/ml) and had returned to the control value after 8 hours. Plasma big endothelin 1 showed changes similar to those of plasma endothelin 1. No significant changes in plasma endothelin 2 and endothelin 3 were observed. Cardiac tissue contained seven times as much endothelin 1 as the control value 1 hour after reperfusion (4.59 versus 33.1 pg/g tissue), and a high concentration (13.2 pg/g tissue) was maintained even after 48 hours. We concluded that an increase in endogenous endothelin 1 plays an important role in the extension of myocardial infarct size.\r"

The sheet model of 2.5 x 10 mm consisted of a set of 100 parallel cables coupled through a regular array of identical transverse resistors. The membrane dynamics was represented by a modified Beeler-Reuter model. We defined the charging factor (CF) to represent by a single number the proportion of input current used to charge the membrane locally below threshold and showed that CF is inversely correlated with the time constant of the foot of the action potential (tau foot) during propagation on a cable. A safety factor of propagation (SF) was also defined for the upstroke of the action potential, with SF directly correlated with the maximum rate of depolarization (Vmax) and, for cablelike propagation, with propagation velocity. Propagation along the principal longitudinal axis of the elliptic wave front is cablelike but, in comparison with a flat wave front, transverse current flow provides a drag effect that somewhat reduces the propagation velocity, Vmax, SF, and CF. With a longitudinal-to-transverse velocity ratio of 3:1 or more, the wave front propagating along the principal transverse axis is essentially flat and is characterized by multiple collisions between successive pairs of input junctions on a given cable; Vmax, SF, and CF are larger than for longitudinal propagation, but CF is no longer correlated with tau foot. There are transient increases in propagation velocity and Vmax with distance from the stimulation site along both principal axes until stablized values are achieved, and a similar transient decrease in tau foot. Away from the principal axes, the action potential characteristics change progressively along the elliptic wave front.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The first vagal train prolonged the sinus cycle length by 58 +/- 35%, but the response was attenuated during subsequent trains (98 +/- 5% inhibition of the vagal response after only 6.4 +/- 1.7 trains). After 40 minutes, complete restoration of the chronotropic response could be demonstrated. Receptor desensitization could be excluded as the reason for the attenuation by demonstrating preserved responses to exogenous acetylcholine. Neuropeptide Y, a sympathetic cotransmitter that has been shown to attenuate parasympathetic responses (thought to be the result of inhibition of the release of acetylcholine from parasympathetic nerve terminals), was administered (50 micrograms/kg) to eight newborns. Exogenous neuropeptide Y resulted in a complete inhibition of the chronotropic response to vagal stimulation, with restoration of the chronotropic response occurring after 60 minutes. Thus, exogenous neuropeptide Y mimicked the effect of repetitive vagosympathetic trunk stimulation; this finding suggested that neuropeptide Y release from sympathetic nerves during repetitive vagosympathetic trunk stimulation may have resulted in the observed attenuation of the vagal chronotropic response. To test this hypothesis, seven other newborns underwent chemical sympathectomy (50 mg/kg i.p. 6-hydroxydopamine for 3 days, tyramine verified), and in these newborns, stable chronotropic responses to repetitive vagosympathetic trunk stimulation were observed (inhibition of vagal response was 0 +/- 18% after 10 stimulus trains).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

One hour after the occlusion in each group, regional cerebral blood flow was determined in six rats using [14C]iodoantipyrine, and regional arterial and venous oxygen saturations were determined using a microspectrophotometric technique in the other six rats. In both groups of animals, the cerebral blood flow of the ischemic cortex was significantly lower than that of the contralateral cortex (36 +/- 16 [SD] and 67 +/- 14 ml/min/100 g for the control group; 33 +/- 10 and 58 +/- 11 ml/min/100 g for the MK-801 group, respectively). Oxygen extraction was significantly higher in the ischemic cortex (8.8 +/- 2.1 ml O2/100 ml blood) than in the contralateral cortex (5.6 +/- 0.3) for the control group. However, for the MK-801 group, there was no significant difference between the ischemic cortex (6.1 +/- 1.0) and the contralateral cortex (5.7 +/- 1.1). Oxygen extraction in the ischemic cortex of the MK-801 group was significantly lower than that of the control group. Calculated ischemic regional oxygen consumption was similar to the nonischemic values in the control group, whereas the ischemic value was reduced to 61% of the value of the contralateral cortex in the MK-801 group.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Two-week studies were performed in 30 patients with essential hypertension who were given a regular sodium diet in the first week and a sodium-restricted diet in the second week. Intrarenal hemodynamic parameters such as afferent arteriolar (preglomerular) resistance, efferent arteriolar resistance, and glomerular hydrostatic pressure were calculated from renal clearances and plasma total protein concentration measured on the last day of the regular sodium diet. Calculations were based on Gomez's equations with the assumption that the gross filtration coefficient of glomerular capillaries was normal. The increase in afferent arteriolar resistance (8,100 +/- 500 dyne.sec.cm-5) was significantly correlated with an elevation in mean arterial pressure (120 +/- 2 mm Hg), whereas glomerular pressure (56 +/- 1 mm Hg) and efferent arteriolar resistance (2,500 +/- 100 dyne.sec.cm-5) remained normal. The renal function curve (pressure-natriuresis relation) was drawn by plotting urinary sodium excretion on the y axis as a function of mean arterial pressure on the x axis, both of which were measured on the last 3 days of each week. The extrapolated x intercept (107 +/- 2 mm Hg) of the renal function curve was strongly correlated in a 1:1 fashion with the sum of the arterial pressure drop from the aorta to the renal glomeruli plus the opposing pressures against glomerular filtration at glomeruli (r = 0.7, p less than 0.001) on the regular sodium diet, suggesting that the difference between mean arterial pressure on the regular sodium diet and the extrapolated x intercept represented the effective filtration pressure across the glomerular capillaries on the regular sodium diet.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Microelectrode recordings from different cell types at the PV junctions were obtained, and the cells recorded from were retrieved microscopically. To this end 26 tissue blocks were serially sectioned at 4 microns. Microscopic identification of the very cell recorded from was obtained in five of seven Purkinje, five of 16 transitional, and two of two ventricular muscle cell recordings. In addition, some tissue blocks from both junctional and nonjunctional sites identified only by extracellular recording were examined in serial sections. Transitional cells in the rabbit heart are thin, broad bandlike cells (30-35 by 3-5 microns) arranged in one or two sheets in the subendocardium between the Purkinje layer and ventricular mass. Transitional cells are coupled via short, thin strands to both Purkinje and ventricular muscle cells. A second type of PV coupling was observed frequently in the pig, but in only one of 21 cases in the rabbit. Here, a short, linear segment of small transitional cells connected large-diameter Purkinje cells to ventricular muscle cells. Distances found between Purkinje-transitional cell coupling sites and transitional cell-ventricular muscle coupling sites varied from 100 to 1,000 microns in the rabbit heart and from 50 to several hundred micrometers in the pig heart. Action potentials from transitional cells typically showed multiple components in their upstroke. Both our morphological and electrophysiological findings are compatible with the existence of a relatively high-resistance barrier between Purkinje and transitional cells and between transitional and ventricular muscle cells.\r"

During this interval, the weight and blood pressures (systolic, diastolic, and mean) of the animals increased significantly. The tunica media of the artery and the lumen increased significantly with age, but the proportion of smooth muscle cell to paracellular matrix did not alter. Computer-assisted three-dimensional reconstructions were used to investigate the smooth muscle cells. They increased significantly in length, volume, and angle of orientation within the vessel wall with age but maintained an approximate surface area-to-volume ratio. The cells in any one vessel tended to be oriented in either a clockwise or counterclockwise direction. The size of the nucleus also increased significantly in length and volume with age, but an approximate surface area-to-volume ratio and a constant nucleocytoplasmic ratio were maintained. The nuclei tended to be eccentrically located, with less than half of all nuclei wholly within the middle third of the cell. Surgical denervation at 10 days of age resulted in abnormalities of growth in vessel dimensions, thinner tunica media at 3 weeks (denervated 11 days previously), and smaller lumen at 6 weeks (denervated 32 days previously). Elevated amounts of paracellular matrix occurred in both age groups, but denervation did not alter smooth muscle cell size. In the 3-week-old animals, denervation resulted in smooth muscle cells with hypertrophied nuclei. This may account for the increase in growth of the tunica media between 3 and 6 weeks of age in the denervated artery.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Because this can be markedly inhibited by amine-uptake-blocking agents, it has been suggested that its mechanism is a carrier-mediated efflux from neurons, which is not operative under normal conditions. The present work examined this release process in chromaffin cells isolated from the bovine adrenal medulla, a model system for studying the sympathetic nervous system. Chromaffin cells in primary culture retained normal secretory responses for up to 7 days. Conditions designed to mimic ischemia, that is, anoxia or metabolic inhibition, resulted in a significant release of catecholamines. This release was shown to be independent of extracellular calcium but, in contrast to the release observed in ischemic hearts, was not inhibited by amine-uptake blockers. Electrophoresis with immunoblotting demonstrated that significant levels of the chromaffin granule protein, chromogranin A, were released during metabolic inhibition, indicative of an exocytotic mechanism. However, there was no release of the cytosolic protein, lactate dehydrogenase, indicating that there was no concomitant breakdown of the cell membrane. These results provide evidence for an exocytotic release of catecholamines mediated by the direct action of conditions of metabolic inhibition.\r"

However, the relative activities of the circulating and tissue renin-angiotensin systems have not been examined previously in pathophysiological states, such as congestive heart failure. The present study was performed to examine the status of plasma and tissue angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) activities in compensated experimental heart failure induced by coronary artery ligation in the rat. Three groups of male Sprague-Dawley rats were examined: 1) nonoperated rats (NO, n = 5), 2) sham-operated rats (SO, n = 5), and 3) heart failure rats (HF, n = 11). Rats were studied an averaged of 85 days postoperatively. In HF animals, plasma renin concentration and serum ACE activities were not different compared with NO and SO control animals. Cardiac ACE activity was 50% greater in the right ventricle than the interventricular septum in NO and SO rats. Both right ventricular and interventricular septal ACE activity increased approximately twofold in HF animals as compared with NO and SO groups (p less than 0.05). In contrast, pulmonary, aortic, and renal ACE activities were not altered in HF rats compared with control animals. A positive correlation existed between the histopathological size of myocardial infarction and the level of right ventricular ACE activity (r = 0.75, p less than or equal to 0.05). Such a relation between infarct size and either serum or noncardiac tissue ACE activities was not observed.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Cardiac fibroblasts are responsible for synthesis and deposition of fibrillar collagen types I and III. Transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-beta 1) has been proved to increase collagen biosynthesis in various systems, both in vivo and in vitro. We have investigated the effect of TGF-beta 1 on collagen gene expression in cultured cardiac fibroblasts and have compared this effect with that of a mitogenic agent, phorbol myristate acetate (PMA). The regulation of collagen types I and III gene expression was examined by using cDNA probes to rat alpha 2 (I) and mouse alpha 1 (III) procollagens. Quiescent cultured cardiac fibroblasts from rabbit heart were treated with TGF-beta 1 (10-15 ng/ml) and PMA (200 ng/ml). After 24 hours of treatment with TGF-beta 1, the abundance of mRNA for pro-alpha 2 (I) and pro-alpha 1 (III) collagens was increased by 112% (p less than 0.001) and 97% (p = 0.05), respectively, in treated fibroblasts compared with untreated cells. However, PMA-treated cells showed an opposite response: a 42% (p = 0.01) decrease in mRNA levels for pro-alpha 2 (I) collagen was observed. Immunofluorescent staining of cardiac fibroblasts in culture with anti-type I collagen antibody showed that alterations in mRNA levels led to altered collagen synthesis: cellular collagen was relatively increased in TGF-beta 1-treated cells and significantly diminished in PMA-treated cells. The abundance of mRNA for pro-alpha 1 (III) collagen was not affected by PMA treatment.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

To test the hypothesis that procainamide decreases sympathetic nerve activity (SNA) in humans, we recorded postganglionic SNA in seven normal subjects in the baseline state and during infusions of procainamide HCl at 50 mg/min (loading) and 8 mg/min (maintenance). At the end of the loading infusion, mean arterial pressure (MAP) had decreased from 88.5 +/- 2.4 (mean +/- SEM) to 81.5 +/- 3.2 mm Hg (p less than 0.05), central venous pressure from 6.7 +/- 0.7 to 5.4 +/- 0.9 mm Hg (p less than 0.05), forearm vascular resistance (FVR) from 28 +/- 4.8 to 22.3 +/- 5.1 resistance units (p less than 0.05), and SNA from 259 +/- 47 to 94 +/- 26 units/min (p less than 0.05). These changes persisted during the maintenance infusion. Increased levels of SNA, FVR, and MAP provoked by the cold pressor test were reduced significantly by intravenous procainamide. In eight other subjects, intravenous procainamide HCl (15 mg/kg at 50 mg/min) caused dose-dependent inhibition of SNA that reversed as blood concentrations fell during drug washout. To determine if procainamide causes direct vasodilation, in nine subjects, graded infusions were delivered into the brachial artery at doses that produced no systemic effect. Ipsilateral FVR tended to increase during local intra-arterial infusion of procainamide. These data show that intravenous procainamide causes hypotension, vasodilation, and sympathetic withdrawal. Vasodilation does not result from a direct vasorelaxant effect of the drug.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Laser Doppler flowmetry was used to determine the effects of adrenergic drugs topically applied to the round window membrane of the cochlea. The relative influence of the various receptor types (alpha 1, alpha 2, beta 1, and beta 2) was examined by a selection of agonists and antagonists. The agonists norepinephrine and epinephrine, which have mixed alpha- and beta-receptor effects, and phenylephrine, a strong alpha 1-agonist, all induced a dose-dependent reduction in cochlear blood flow. The agonists isoproterenol (beta-active), salbutamol (alpha 2-active) had no effect on cochlear blood flow. Of the antagonists, when tested alone, only the selective alpha 1-antagonist prazosin had a direct effect on cochlear blood flow, demonstrating an increase in cochlear blood flow. The selective alpha 2-antagonist idazoxan, the beta-antagonist propranolol, and the unselective alpha-antagonist phentolamine had no effect on cochlear blood flow. Interaction studies of agonists and antagonists were performed to specifically define the receptor subclasses responsible for the cochlear blood flow increases with norepinephrine and epinephrine. The results are consistent with the presence of an alpha 1-adrenergic sympathetic control of cochlear blood flow.\r"

  ".W": "Prolongation of cardiac action potentials may mediate some of the arrhythmia-suppressing and arrhythmia-aggravating actions of antiarrhythmic agents. In this study, suppression of time-dependent outward current by quinidine and amiodarone was assessed in guinea pig ventricular myocytes. The net time-dependent outward current contained at least two components: a slowly activating, La(3+)-resistant delayed rectifier current (IK) and a rapidly activating, La(3+)-sensitive current. Quinidine block of total time-dependent outward current during clamp steps to positive potentials was relieved as a function of time, whereas that induced by amiodarone was enhanced. In contrast, at negative potentials, suppression of current, whereas amiodarone reduced IK but not the La(3+)-sensitive current, suggesting that differential block of the two components of time-dependent current underlies the distinct effects of the two agents. In contrast to these disparate effects on total time-dependent outward current, steady-state reduction of IK by both drugs increased at positive voltages and saturated at approximately +40 mV; the voltage dependence of block by quinidine (17% per decade, +10 to +30 mV) was steeper than that by amiodarone (5% per decade, +10 to +20 mV). Block by quinidine was time dependent at negative potentials: on stepping from +50 to -30 mV, block initially increased very rapidly, and subsequent deactivation of IK was slowed. This effect was not seen with amiodarone. At -80 mV, quinidine block was relieved with a time constant of 40 +/- 15 msec (n = 4, twin-pulse protocol). The effects of quinidine on IK were compatible with neither a purely voltage-dependent model of quinidine binding nor a model incorporating both voltage- and state-dependent binding of quinidine to delayed rectifier channels having only one open state. The voltage- and time-dependent features of quinidine block were well described by a model in which quinidine has greater affinity for one of two open states of the channel. We conclude that the effects of quinidine and amiodarone on time-dependent outward current reflects block of multiple channels. Quinidine block of IK was far more voltage dependent than that produced by amiodarone, suggesting the drugs act by different mechanisms.\r"

In aggreement with previously reported results using avian tissues, we show that the mRNAs encoding the two myosin heavy chain isoforms are differentially expressed in rat nonmuscle and muscle tissues as well as in a number of human cell lines. The cDNA sequence encoding the 5' portion of the NMMHC-A isoform completes the previously published 3' cDNA sequence encoding a human myosin heavy chain, thus providing the cDNA sequence encoding the entire NMMHC-A amino acid sequence. Comparison of this sequence to cDNA clones encoding the amino-terminal one third of the NMMHC-B sequence (amino acids 58-718) shows them to be 89% identical at the amino acid level and 74% identical at the nucleotide level.\r"

  ".W": "alpha-Adrenergic stimulation is known to enhance myocardial contractility. Adult rat left ventricular myocytes bathed in 1 mM [Ca2+] (Ca0) and electrically stimulated at 0.2 Hz responded to alpha-adrenergic stimulation with 50 microM phenylephrine and 1 microM propranolol with an increase in twitch amplitude to 177.1 +/- 25.6% of control (mean +/- SEM). In contrast, when cell Ca2+ loading was increased by bathing cells in 5 mM Ca0, alpha-adrenergic stimulation decreased twitch amplitude to 68.6 +/- 8.2% of control. Time-averaged cytosolic [Ca2+] of cells in 1.0 mM Ca0 is enhanced via an increase in the frequency of electrical stimulation. When myocytes were stimulated at 2 Hz in 1 mM Ca0, alpha-adrenergic stimulation did not increase twitch amplitude (103.8 +/- 12.4% of control). In myocytes loaded with the Ca2+ probe into-1, alpha-adrenergic effects during stimulation at 0.2 Hz (an increase in twitch amplitude in 1 mM Ca0 and a decrease in twitch amplitude in 5 mM Ca0) were associated with similar changes in the indo-1 transient. In 5 mM Ca0, spontaneous Ca2+ releases from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) occurred in the diastolic interval between twitches (2.9 +/- 1.4 spontaneous SR Ca2+ oscillations/min; n = 7); alpha-adrenergic stimulation abolished these oscillations in six of seven cells. Thus, an increase in the frequency of spontaneous diastolic SR Ca2+ release (i.e., Ca2+ overload) is not the mechanism for the negative inotropic effect of alpha-adrenergic stimulation in 5 mM Ca0. In experiments with unstimulated myocytes, we determined whether the effect of alpha-adrenergic stimulation on cell Ca2+ homeostasis and oscillatory SR Ca2+ release observed in 5 mM Ca0 occurs only during electrical stimulation, when voltage-dependent currents are operative, or also at rest. Unstimulated rat ventricular myocytes in 5 mM Cao exhibit oscillatory SR Ca2+ release; alpha-adrenergic stimulation decreased the frequency of these oscillations to 53.9 +/- 8.9% of control, and this effect was blocked by 1 microM prazosin. In unstimulated indo-1-loaded myocytes alpha-adrenergic stimulation decreased the resting indo-1 fluorescence ratio in 5 mM Ca0, whereas it had no effect in 1 mM Ca0. Additional experiments were aimed at defining a role for Ca(2+)-activated, phospholipid-dependent protein kinase C (PKC) for the negative inotropic effect of alpha-adrenergic stimulation in 5 mM Ca0. Short-term preexposure to 0.1 microM 4 beta-phrobol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) has been shown to maximally activate PKC.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

To elucidate intercellular distribution and function of the Ca2+ channel in SR in cultured VSMCs, we observed Ca2+i transients by digital two-dimensional imaging with a fluorescent Ca2+ indicator, fura-2, and found an alternative response to either caffeine or angiotensin II under the condition that selectively enabled Ca2+ release from SR. Caffeine (20 mM) increased the Ca2+i by 292 +/- 36% (mean +/- SEM) over the basal level in one third of the VSMC population (n = 19), while the remaining cells in the same observation field showed no or very weak response (110 +/- 4%). In contrast, after the treatment with caffeine plus ryanodine (30 microM), which inactivates the caffeine-sensitive channel, and with 1 mM Ca2+ chelator (EGTA) instead of Ca2+ in the incubation medium to block the CA2+ entry from outside, angiotensin II (10 nM) induced the Ca2+i elevation (287 +/- 26%) in previously caffeine-nonresponsive cells, although caffeine-responsive cells retained quiescence (112 +/- 2%). These responses did not differ when the order of the reagent application was reversed. These heterogeneities of VSMCs in the Ca2+i response to vasoactive substances indicate that VSMCs are functionally divided into subgroups with different Ca2+ channel predominance on SR, necessitating reevaluation of the previous studies obtained from multiple VSMCs.\r"

In this respect, it is our opinion that rhythms and neural components always interact, just like flexor and extensor tones or excitatory and inhibitory cardiovascular reflexes, and that it is misleading to separately consider vagal and sympathetic modulations of heart rate. In humans and experimental animals, functional states likely to be accompanied by an increased sympathetic activity are characterized by a shift of the LF-HF balance in favor of the LF component; the opposite occurs during presumed increases in vagal activity. In addition, LF oscillation evaluated from SAP variability appears to be a convenient marker of the sympathetic modulation of vasomotor activity. Although based on indirect markers, the exploration in the frequency domain of cardiovascular neural regulation might disclose a unitary vision hard to reach through the assemblage of more specific but fragmented pieces of information.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND. We examined the value of dipyridamole thallium-201 (201Tl) scintigraphy as a preoperative screening test for perioperative myocardial ischemia and infarction. METHODS AND RESULTS. We prospectively studied 60 patients undergoing elective vascular surgery. We performed 201Tl scintigraphy preoperatively and blinded all treating physicians to the results. Historical, clinical, laboratory, and physiological data were gathered throughout hospitalization. Myocardial ischemia was assessed during the intraoperative period using continuous 12-lead electrocardiography (ECG) and transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) and during the postoperative period using continuous two-lead ambulatory ECG. Adverse cardiac outcomes (cardiac death, myocardial infarction, unstable angina, severe ischemia, or congestive heart failure) were assessed daily throughout hospitalization. Twenty-two patients (37%) had defects that improved or reversed on delayed scintigrams (redistribution defects), 18 (30%) had persistent defects, and 20 (33%) had no defects on 201Tl scintigraphy. There was no association between redistribution defects and adverse cardiac outcomes: 54% (seven of 13) of adverse outcomes occurred in patients without redistribution defects, and the risk of an adverse outcome was not significantly increased in patients with redistribution defects (relative risk 1.5, 95% confidence interval 0.6-3.9, p = 0.43). Consistent with these findings, there was also no association between redistribution defects and perioperative ischemia: 54% (19 of all 35) of perioperative ECG and TEE ischemic episodes and 58% (14 of 24) of severe ischemic episodes occurred in patients without redistribution defects. The sensitivity of 201Tl scintigraphy for perioperative ischemia and adverse outcomes ranged from 40% to 54%, specificity from 65% to 71%, positive predictive value from 27% to 47% and negative predictive value from 61% to 82%. CONCLUSIONS. These results differ from those of previous studies and suggest that the routine use of 201Tl scintigraphy for preoperative screening of patients undergoing vascular surgery may not be warranted.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND. Long QT syndrome (LQTS) is a congenital disorder accompanied by a high incidence of sudden cardiac death. beta-Adrenergic blockade is the therapy of choice, and it is successful in 75-80% of patients. For those in whom cardiac events (syncope or cardiac arrest) are not prevented by beta-blockade, experimental studies suggest that left cardiac sympathetic denervation (LCSD) may be useful. METHODS AND RESULTS. We identified 85 LQTS patients worldwide who underwent LCSD, and we provide here the first large-scale evaluation of its efficacy. The time interval between the first cardiac event and LCSD and the follow-up period after LCSD were similar (5.6 +/- 6.1 versus 5.9 +/- 5.7 years). The mean age of the patients at surgery was 20 +/- 13 years. LCSD was followed by highly significant (p less than 0.0001) decreases in the number of patients with cardiac events (from 99% to 45%), in the number of cardiac events per patient (from 22 +/- 32 to 1 +/- 3), and in the number of patients with five or more cardiac events (from 71% to 10%). There were seven sudden deaths (8%), and the 5-year survival rate was 94%. The marked reduction in the incidence of tachyarrhythmic syncope suggests that LCSD has also reduced the risk for sudden death in this high-risk population. CONCLUSIONS. The present findings demonstrate that for LQTS patients who continue with syncope or cardiac arrest despite the use of beta-blockers, LCSD is a very effective therapy.\r"

To compare the effects of two different thrombolytic agents combined or not with heparin on the incidence and features of left ventricular thrombi and their related embolic events, we performed a GISSI-2 ancillary echocardiographic study (the first echocardiogram obtained within 48 hours of symptoms onset and the second before hospital discharge) that enrolled 180 consecutive patients (mean age, 63 +/- 11 years, 142 men) with a first anterior acute myocardial infarction. Patients were randomized into four groups of treatment: recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (rt-PA) (n = 47), rt-PA plus heparin (n = 45), streptokinase (n = 39), and streptokinase plus heparin (n = 49). Left ventricular thrombosis was observed in 51 of 180 patients (28%). No significant differences were found concerning the incidence of thrombi in the four treatment groups. Mural shape of left ventricular thrombi was found more frequently than the protruding shape (71% versus 29% at the first examination, 64% versus 36% at the second), particularly in heparin-treated patients (93% versus 7% at first examination, 70% versus 30% at the second). Only one embolic event (0.5%) occurred during the hospitalization. CONCLUSIONS. We conclude that 1) the rate of left ventricular thrombi does not differ in patients with acute myocardial infarction treated either with streptokinase or rt-PA, 2) subcutaneous heparin, when begun 12 hours after intravenous thrombolysis, does not appear to further reduce the occurrence of thrombi but seems to influence the shape of left ventricular thrombi, and 3) during the predischarge period, embolic events are rare in patients treated by thrombolysis.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND. Although aspirin therapy started before operation improves vein graft patency after coronary artery bypass grafting, it also causes bleeding. The objective of this prospective, centrally directed, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was to compare the effects of aspirin therapy started before operation with aspirin started 6 hours after operation on early (7-10-day) graft patency. METHODS AND RESULTS. Patients were randomized to receive either aspirin 325 mg or placebo the night before surgery; after operation, all patients received aspirin 325 mg daily, with the first dose administered through the nasogastric tube 6 hours after operation. Angiography was performed in 72% of the analyzed patients an average of 8 days after operation, and the primary end point was saphenous vein graft patency in 351 patients. Internal mammary artery graft patency was also assessed in 246 patients because many individuals received both internal mammary artery and vein grafts. In the patients given preoperative aspirin, the vein graft occlusion rate was 7.4 +/- 1.3% compared with 7.8 +/- 1.5% in those who received preoperative placebo (p = 0.871). In the subgroup of patients receiving Y grafts, 0.0% of the grafts were occluded in the preoperative aspirin group compared with 7.0 +/- 3.6% in the preoperative placebo group (p = 0.066). The internal mammary artery occlusion rate was 0.0% (0 of 131) in the aspirin group compared with 2.4 +/- 1.4% (three of 125) in the placebo group (p = 0.081). Patients in the aspirin group received more transfusions than those in the placebo group (median, 900 versus 725 ml, p = 0.006). The reoperation rate for bleeding in the aspirin group was 6.3% compared with 2.4% in the placebo group (p = 0.036). Median chest tube drainage within the first 6 hours after operation was 500 ml in the aspirin group compared with 448 ml in the placebo group (p = 0.011). CONCLUSIONS. Thus, preoperative aspirin is associated with increased bleeding complications and offers no additional benefit in early vein graft patency compared with starting aspirin therapy 6 hours after operation. There was a trend, although not significant, toward improved early patency for Y grafts and internal mammary artery grafts with preoperative aspirin.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND. Among survivors of acute myocardial infarction, frequent and repetitive ventricular premature depolarizations (VPDs) detected on ambulatory monitoring contribute independently to the risk of all-cause mortality and sudden death. Apart from the beta-blockers, no antiarrhythmic drug has been reliably demonstrated to reduce mortality among patients with VPDs. A pilot study was undertaken to gather data to aid in the design of a multicenter trial of amiodarone for the reduction of mortality from cardiac arrhythmias in such patients. METHODS AND RESULTS. Seventy-seven patients with acute myocardial infarction within the previous 6-30 days and 10 or more VPDs/hr or one or more runs of ventricular tachycardia on 24-hour electrocardiographic recording were randomized in a double-blind fashion in a 2:1 amiodarone-to-placebo ratio. The loading dose was 10 mg/kg/day for 3 weeks. The maintenance dose was 300-400 mg/day with reductions at 4-month intervals in response to VPD suppression, excessive plasma levels, or toxicity. VPD suppression at 1 week and 2 weeks was 63% and 85%, respectively, on amiodarone and 17% and 27%, respectively, on placebo. Apart from thyroid-stimulating hormone elevation and skin reactions, no side effects occurred more frequently with amiodarone. The study drug was stopped for side effects or noncompliance in 35% of amiodarone patients and 34% of placebo patients. Patients were followed for a maximum of 2 years (mean, 20 months). Arrhythmic death or resuscitated ventricular fibrillation occurred in two of 48 amiodarone patients (6%) and four of 29 placebo patients (14%), whereas the rates of all-cause mortality were five of 48 (10%) and six of 29 (21%), respectively. CONCLUSIONS. Amiodarone, in moderate loading and maintenance dosages with adjustments in response to plasma levels, VPD suppression, and side effects, results in effective VPD suppression and acceptable levels of toxicity.\r"

Two hundred eighteen patients were evaluated in a two-phase approach (time to first appropriate discharge, survival after discharge) to identify factors that may be related to maximal benefit derived from use of an automatic implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (AICD). METHODS AND RESULTS. One hundred ninety-seven patients survived implantation of AICD, with or without concomitant cardiac surgery. One hundred five patients had an AICD discharge associated with syncope, presyncope, documented sustained ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation, or sleep at 9.1 +/- 11.1 months after implantation. Patients survived 23.8 +/- 18.0 months after AICD discharge. Left ventricular dysfunction (p = 0.008 for ejection fraction less than 25%) was associated with earlier AICD discharge and shortened survival after AICD discharge (p = 0.008 for ejection fraction less than 25%; p = 0.01 for New York Heart Association functional class III and IV). beta-Blocker administration (p = 0.006) and coronary bypass surgery (p = 0.06) were associated with later AICD discharge. Coronary bypass surgery (p = 0.035) but not beta-blockers was associated with more prolonged survival after AICD discharge. CONCLUSIONS. These data suggest that a relatively easy algorithm can be applied to predict which patient will benefit most from AICD implantation.\r"

METHODS AND RESULTS. Catheter ablation of the atrioventricular (AV) junction using a catheter positioned across the tricuspid annulus was unsuccessful in eight patients with a mean +/- SD age of 51 +/- 19 years who had AV nodal reentry tachycardia (three patients), orthodromic tachycardia using a concealed midseptal accessory pathway, atrial tachycardia, atrial flutter (two patients), or atrial fibrillation. Before attempts at catheter ablation of the AV junction, each patient had been refractory to pharmacological therapy, and four had failed attempts at either catheter modification of the AV node using radiofrequency energy or surgical and catheter ablation of the accessory pathway. Conventional right-sided catheter ablation of the AV junction using radiofrequency energy in six patients and both radiofrequency energy and direct current shocks in two patients was ineffective. The mean amplitude of the His bundle potential recorded at the tricuspid annulus at the sites of unsuccessful AV junction ablation was 0.1 +/- 0.08 mV, with a maximum His amplitude of 0.03-0.28 mV. A 7F deflectable-tip quadripolar electrode catheter with a 4-mm distal electrode was positioned against the upper left ventricular septum using a retrograde aortic approach from the femoral artery. Third-degree AV block was induced in each of the eight patients with 20-36 W applied for 15-30 seconds. The His bundle potential at the sites of successful AV junction ablation ranged from 0.06 to 0.99 mV, with a mean of 0.27 +/- 0.32 mV. There was no rise in the creatine kinase-MB fraction and no complications occurred. An intrinsic escape rhythm of 30-60 beats/min was present in seven of the eight patients. Each patient received a permanent pacemaker and has been asymptomatic during 3-13 months of follow-up. CONCLUSIONS. Catheter ablation of the AV junction can be achieved effectively and safely using radiofrequency energy delivered in the left ventricle when the conventional right-sided approach is unsuccessful.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND. The introduction of percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) has changed the pattern of intervention in coronary artery disease. However, the long-term results in patients undergoing successful, elective, native-vessel PTCA are not yet fully characterized. Because the healing and subsequent proliferative response after angioplasty are time related, it was the purpose of the present study to determine the long-term outcome in patients whose dilated arteries have been demonstrated to be patent 4-12 months after successful, uncomplicated PTCA. METHODS AND RESULTS. The patients were grouped on the basis of the 4-12 month catheterization into those whose vessels were angiographically \"normal\" or had luminal irregularities only at the PTCA sites (396 patients), those whose vessels also had luminal irregularities elsewhere with or without PTCA site luminal irregularities (680 patients), and those with significant obstructive disease (more than 50% diameter narrowing) at sites other than the PTCA sites (426 patients). Of 1,502 such patients, long-term follow-up was available in 1,491. At the time of the original angioplasty, the normal patients had a 1.8% incidence of multivessel disease; luminal irregularity patients, 9.4%; and obstructive disease patients, 58.7%. At angiographic restudy, 16.4% of the obstructive disease patients continued to have multivessel disease. The patients were followed for the events of death, myocardial infarction, coronary surgery, and repeat PTCA. The 6-year survival rate was 95%; cardiac survival, 96%; and freedom from all events, 65%. The strongest correlate of events during follow-up was the angiographic status of the undilated segments. At 6 years, freedom from cardiac events was noted in 77% of the normal group, 61% of the luminal irregularity group, and 55% of the obstructive disease group. Diabetes and hypertension were also independent correlates of events. CONCLUSIONS. Results from the present study show that associated disease in undilated segments is a strong predictor of late events in patients after successful, uncomplicated, reatenosis-free PTCA. However, the need for further revascularization was frequent even in patients without obstructive disease. Completeness of revascularization is appropriate when possible, and limiting progression of coronary disease at sites remote from those dilated should improve on these late results.\r"

This prospective study was designed to examine whether left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy of the denervated transplanted heart may be reversed by medical therapy and, if so, to investigate the time course of this process and its effect on exercise capacity, myocardial function, and cardiac hemodynamics. METHODS AND RESULTS. Ten hypertensive heart transplant recipients with LV hypertrophy were evaluated before therapy with enalapril plus furosemide alone or combined with verapamil, at initial blood pressure (BP) control and after 3, 6, 9, and 12 months, using 24-hour noninvasive ambulatory BP monitoring, M-mode and two-dimensional echocardiography, and supine bicycle ergometry. Average 24-hour systolic and diastolic BP declined from 158 +/- 10 and 104 +/- 7 mm Hg to 129 +/- 9 and 84 +/- 10 mm Hg at initial BP control (p less than 0.005 and p less than 0.025, respectively) and total peripheral resistance from 1,687 +/- 177 to 1,376 +/- 122 dyne.sec.cm-5 (p less than 0.025), remaining normal thereafter. Exercise capacity remained unchanged during the study. LV mass, mass-to-volume ratio, and end-diastolic septal plus posterior wall thickness decreased progressively from 211 +/- 30 g, 2.49 +/- 0.62 g/ml, and 25.7 +/- 2.6 mm to 184 +/- 26 g, 2.22 +/- 0.46 g/ml, and 22.5 +/- 1.9 mm after 3 months (all p less than 0.025) and to 174 +/- 25 g, 2.07 +/- 0.38 g/ml, and 21.5 +/- 1.5 mm after 6 months (all p less than 0.005), remaining unaltered at 9 and 12 months. A correlation was found between the decrease in average 24-hour mean BP and LV mass after 3 months of antihypertensive therapy (r = 0.71, p less than 0.05). Systolic meridional wall stress, LV end-diastolic and stroke volume, ejection fraction, and cardiac output remained unchanged throughout the observation period. CONCLUSIONS. The results indicate that regression of LV hypertrophy is induced by effective antihypertensive therapy in the denervated transplanted heart. The extent of decrease in average 24-hour BP appears to be the main determinant for the extent of reduction in LV mass. LV afterload as characterized by systolic meridional wall stress, LV size and pump function, and physical exercise capacity of the transplant patients are not influenced by the therapeutic regimen chosen in this study.\r"

Intraoperative transesophageal Doppler color flow imaging (TDCF) affords the opportunity to assess mitral valve competency immediately before and after cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). The purpose of this study was to assess the utility of TDCF to assist in the selection and operative treatment of ischemic mitral regurgitation (MR). METHODS AND RESULTS. Two hundred forty-six patients undergoing surgery for ischemic heart disease were prospectively studied. All had preoperative cardiac catheterization. Catheterization and pre-CPB TDCF were discordant in their estimation of MR in 112 patients (46%). Compared with patients in whom both techniques agreed in estimation of MR, patients with discordance in MR were more likely to have had unstable clinical syndromes at the time of catheterization (79% versus 40%, p less than 0.05) or to have received thrombolytics (16% versus 8%, p less than 0.05). Pre-CPB TDCF resulted in a change in the operative plan with respect to the mitral valve in 27 patients (11%). Because less MR was found by TDCF than catheterization, 22 patients had only coronary bypass grafting when combined coronary bypass and mitral valve surgery had been planned. Because more MR was found by TDCF than catheterization, five patients had combined coronary bypass and mitral valve surgery when coronary bypass alone had been planned. Unsatisfactory results noted by TDCF following mitral valve surgery in five patients resulted in immediate corrective surgery. Cox regression analysis identified residual MR at the completion of surgery to be an important predictor of survival (chi 2 = 21.4) after surgery--more important than patient age (chi 2 = 8.3) or left ventricular ejection fraction (chi 2 = 5.3). CONCLUSIONS. These results indicate that TDCF is useful in guiding patient selection and operative treatment of ischemic MR and that in such patients, intraoperative TDCF should be performed routinely.\r"

From 1973 to 1975, blood platelets were counted, and their responsiveness to aggregating agents was studied in healthy middle-aged men. The aim was to assess the possible association between these variables and coronary heart disease. At 13.5 years of follow up, a significantly higher coronary heart disease mortality was observed among the 25% of subjects with the highest platelet counts. Platelet aggregation performed in a random subsample (150 of the 487 men), moreover, revealed that the 50% with the most rapid aggregation response after ADP stimulation had significantly increased coronary heart disease mortality compared with the others. These associations could not be explained by differences in age, lipids, blood pressure, or smoking habits. CONCLUSIONS. The present study is the first to present conclusive, prospective evidence of an association between platelet concentration and aggregability and long-term incidence of fatal coronary heart disease in a population of apparently healthy middle-aged men.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND. Saphenous vein grafts (SVG) and internal mammary artery (IMA) grafts have been used for coronary artery bypass grafting. In adult patients with bypass grafting for atherosclerotic coronary artery disease, IMA grafts have been reported to have long-term patency; however, results are conflicting on whether the graft is sufficient to meet increased myocardial oxygen demand during exercise. There have been no studies on hemodynamics and blood flow during exercise after bypass grafting with IMA in pediatric patients with Kawasaki disease. METHODS AND RESULTS. We studied 17 pediatric patients with Kawasaki disease (average age, 7.5 +/- 3.1 years), who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting with the IMA. The average number of coronary artery bypass grafts was 2.1 +/- 0.7/patient. For all patients, the left IMA was anastomosed to the left anterior descending coronary artery; for eight patients, the right IMA was also anastomosed to the right coronary artery. In addition, 11 SVGs were used. The postoperative patency rates after 1 month were 100% with the IMA graft and 91% with SVG. One year after the operation, the patency rates were 100% with IMA and 50% with SVG. Hemodynamics during exercise were measured with a bicycle ergometer, and coronary sinus blood flow was measured by the continuous thermodilution method in six patients. The relation between delta LVEDP (the difference between left ventricular end-diastolic pressure at rest and during exercise) and delta SVI (the difference between the stroke volume index at rest and during exercise) was analyzed. Four of six patients had reduced cardiac function before operation (delta LVEDP, positive; delta SVI, negative). However, after the operation, all patients demonstrated improvements in cardiac function during exercise (delta LVEDP, positive; delta SVI, positive). Coronary sinus flow per left ventricular mass increased after operation from 70 +/- 46 to 87 +/- 56 ml/min at rest (p less than 0.05) and from 139 +/- 118 to 183 +/- 150 ml/min during exercise (p less than 0.05). CONCLUSIONS. In conclusion, this study reveals improvements in both hemodynamics and coronary blood flow during exercise after coronary artery bypass grafting with IMA grafts in pediatric patients with Kawasaki disease.\r"

We measured plasma concentrations of total cholesterol, high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, and triglycerides using enzymatic methods in 105 patients with a history of Kawasaki syndrome. Measurements were obtained during six time periods: 10 days or less, 11-31 days, 1-3 months, 3-12 months, 1-3 years, and more than 3 years. Total cholesterol was depressed in the first interval (122.0 +/- 19.8 mg/dl, mean +/- SD), but the mean values were normal in all periods after clinical recovery (overall mean, 149.0 +/- 24.0 mg/dl). High density lipoprotein cholesterol was also depressed in the first interval (15.2 +/- 9.9 mg/dl); although high density lipoprotein cholesterol increased significantly with duration since disease onset (p less than 0.001), it remained significantly lower than expected (p less than 0.001), even in the latest interval (47.2 +/- 10.9 mg/dl). Nonfasting triglyceride levels were high (162.5 +/- 63.4 mg/dl) in the first interval and then diminished steadily with time, but this relation did not achieve statistical significance. We compared adjusted lipid levels (z scores) of 46 Kawasaki patients after clinical recovery with those of their parents; patients had similar total cholesterol levels but significantly lower high density lipoprotein cholesterol levels (p = 0.021 for mothers, p = 0.001 for fathers). Mean high density lipoprotein cholesterol after clinical recovery tended to be lower in patients with persistent coronary abnormalities than in those without such lesions (p = 0.085). CONCLUSIONS. Kawasaki syndrome is associated with important abnormalities in lipid metabolism. Continued long-term surveillance of this population is necessary to monitor lipid levels and their relation to future development of coronary atherosclerosis.\r"

In the first 100 patients undergoing percutaneous excimer laser coronary angioplasty at our institution, acute laser success was obtained in 84% and procedural success was obtained in 94%. There were six acute closures during laser angioplasty and one myocardial infarction. Two patients required emergency coronary bypass surgery. Sixty-five percent of patients had lesions not ideal for balloon angioplasty because of lesion morphology (tubular, diffuse, or chronic total occlusion) or ostial location. There were 10 tubular stenoses, 29 diffuse lesions, 18 chronic total occlusions, and eight ostial lesions, including five aorto-ostial lesions. In this nonideal subgroup, the acute success rate with laser was 86% (72% of chronic total occlusions and 91% of non-totally occluded lesions), and the procedural success rate was 94%. There were three acute occlusions during laser angioplasty but no myocardial infarctions, emergency bypass surgeries, or deaths. One coronary artery perforation occurred without clinical sequelae. Laser angioplasty was successful in four of six lesions (67%) in which balloon angioplasty had failed. Laser success was obtained in 10 of 11 (91%) moderately or heavily calcified stenoses. Eight eccentric lesions and two lesions on bends were successfully treated without dissection or perforation. No side branch occlusions occurred in the 15 patients in whom one or more major branches originated within the lesion treated. Adjunctive balloon angioplasty was performed in 47% of cases, usually to obtain a larger final luminal diameter. Need for adjunctive balloon angioplasty decreased to 36% after a larger (2.0 mm) laser catheter became available. Twenty-eight percent of the 105 lesions treated were American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association classification type A, 47% were type B, and 25% were type C. Laser and procedural successes were obtained in 83% and 97% of type A, 88% and 96% of type B, and 85% and 88% of type C lesions, respectively. CONCLUSIONS. In our initial experience, excimer laser angioplasty was found to be acutely effective and safe therapy for lesions identified as not ideal for balloon angioplasty. This technique may provide a useful adjunct or alternative to balloon angioplasty in selected patients.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND. Directional coronary atherectomy has recently become available to treat coronary stenoses. This study was performed to determine the relation of patient characteristics and stenosis morphology to procedural outcome with directional coronary atherectomy to gain insight into which patients might be best treated with this device. METHODS AND RESULTS. Four hundred stenoses from 378 patients consecutively treated at six major referral institutions were analyzed. Angiographic data were assessed at a central angiographic laboratory using standardized morphological criteria and computer-assisted quantitative dimensional analyses. Procedural success was achieved in 87.8% of stenoses, and major ischemic complications (death, myocardial infarction, and emergency bypass surgery) occurred in 6.3% of patients. Lesion success and complications were closely correlated with recognized modified American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Task Force lesion morphological criteria. Observed for type A stenoses were 93% success and 3% complication rates; for type B1 stenoses, 88% success and 6% complication rates; and for type B2 stenoses, 75% success and 13% complication rates, respectively. There were too few type C stenoses treated to analyze. Furthermore, multivariate testing demonstrated stenosis angulation (multivariate p less than 0.001), proximal tortuosity (p less than 0.001), decreased preatherectomy minimum lumen dimension (p = 0.032), and calcification (p = 0.041) to correlate independently with adverse outcome and complex, probably thrombus-associated stenoses to have a favorable outcome (p = 0.055). Operator experience (p = 0.020) and a history of restenosis (p = 0.022) also favorably influenced outcome. CONCLUSIONS. The procedural outcome of directional coronary atherectomy is highly associated with coronary stenosis morphology. Furthermore, after appropriate stratification for morphology and clinical presentation, overall atherectomy procedural outcome may be similar to that achieved with coronary angioplasty. However, specific subsets of patients may have relatively better outcome with either atherectomy or balloon angioplasty.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND. Blood pressure and total peripheral resistance increase with age. However, the effect of age on vasodilatory capacity has not been characterized. METHODS AND RESULTS. To delineate the effects of aging, gender, and physical training on peripheral vascular function, we measured blood pressure during submaximal and maximal treadmill exercise and measured blood pressure, calf blood flow, and calf conductance (blood flow/mean blood pressure) at rest and during maximal hyperemia in 58 healthy sedentary subjects (men aged 25 +/- 5 and 65 +/- 3 years and women aged 27 +/- 5 and 65 +/- 4 years) and in 52 endurance exercise-trained subjects (men aged 30 +/- 3 and 65 +/- 4 years and women aged 27 +/- 3 and 65 +/- 3 years). Systolic and mean blood pressures were higher at rest, during maximal calf hyperemia, and during submaximal exercise of the same intensity in the older than in the younger subjects of the same gender and exercise training status (p less than 0.01). The magnitude of the age-related effect on blood pressure during exercise was greater in women than in men (p less than 0.01). Diastolic blood pressure during submaximal exercise was also higher in the older than in the younger subjects (p less than 0.05) but not in women treated with estrogen replacement. In contrast, systolic and mean blood pressures during submaximal work were lower in physically conditioned subjects than in sedentary age- and gender-matched subjects (p less than 0.05) but not in older women. Increased age was associated with reduced maximal calf conductance in women (p less than 0.01) but not in men. However, calf vasodilatory capacity was higher in trained than in untrained subjects (p less than 0.01), regardless of age and gender. There was a significant inverse relation between maximal calf conductance and systolic, diastolic, and mean blood pressures during submaximal exercise (r = -0.31 to -0.53, p less than 0.01) and a direct relation between maximal calf conductance and maximal oxygen uptake (r = 0.66, p less than 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS. Thus, for healthy subjects between the ages of 25 and 65 years, there is an interactive effect between age and gender and an independent effect of physical training on peripheral vascular function.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND. Several clinical studies have demonstrated a general superiority of biphasic waveform defibrillation compared with monophasic waveform defibrillation using epicardial lead systems. To test the breadth of utility of biphasic waveforms in humans, a prospective, randomized evaluation of defibrillation efficacy of monophasic and single capacitor biphasic waveform pulses was performed for two distinct nonthoracotomy lead systems as well as for an epicardial electrode system in 51 cardiac arrest survivors undergoing automatic defibrillator implantation. METHODS AND RESULTS. The configurations tested consisted of a right ventricular-left ventricular (RV-LV) epicardial patch-patch system, an RV catheter-chest patch (CP) nonthoracotomy system, and a coronary sinus (CS) catheter-RV catheter nonthoracotomy system. For each configuration, the defibrillation current and voltage waveforms were recorded via a digital oscilloscope to measure defibrillation threshold voltage, current, resistance, and stored energy. Biphasic waveform defibrillation proved more efficient than monophasic waveform defibrillation for the epicardial RV-LV system (4.8 +/- 4.1 versus 6.7 +/- 4.9 J, p = 0.047) and the nonthoracotomy RV-CP system (23.4 +/- 11.1 versus 34.3 +/- 10.4 J, p = 0.0042). Biphasic waveform defibrillation thresholds were not significantly lower than monophasic waveform defibrillation thresholds for the CS-RV nonthoracotomy system (15.6 +/- 7.2 versus 20.0 +/- 11.5 J, p = 0.11). Biphasic waveform defibrillation proved more efficacious than monophasic waveform defibrillation in 13 of 20 patients (65%) with RV-LV epicardial patches, 10 of 15 patients (67%) with an RV-CP nonthoracotomy system, and nine of 16 patients (56%) with an RV-CS nonthoracotomy system. CONCLUSIONS. Biphasic pulsing was useful with nonthoracotomy lead systems as well as with epicardial lead systems. However, the degree of biphasic waveform defibrillation superiority appeared to be electrode system dependent. Furthermore, for a few individuals, biphasic waveform defibrillation proved less efficient than monophasic waveform defibrillation, regardless of the lead system used.\r"

  ".U": "91316829\r", 
  ".W": "BACKGROUND. Many studies have combined patients with hemodynamically well-tolerated ventricular tachycardia (VT) and those with cardiac arrest (CA) as a single, homogenous group. Recent studies suggest that these two groups have different electrophysiological substrates and responses to therapy. Most of these studies, however, enrolled patients with a variety of cardiac diagnoses. METHODS AND RESULTS. We used signal-averaged electrocardiography (SAECG) and endocardial catheter mapping to define the electrophysiological substrate in patients with coronary artery disease and VT or CA and correlate the results of the two methods. We also examined the usefulness of SAECG in CA patients to differentiate those with inducible arrhythmias from those who are noninducible. VT patients were more likely to have had a prior myocardial infarction (p = 0.0005) and to have inducible arrhythmias (p = 0.0001) than were CA patients. The induced arrhythmias in patients who presented with VT was VT in more than 90% of cases, whereas in CA patients, polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (PMVT) accounted for one third of induced arrhythmias. Mean filtered QRS duration was longer (135 versus 120 msec) and the terminal QRS voltage was smaller (20 versus 34 microV) in VT than in CA patients (p less than 0.01). Sixty-three percent of CA patients and 87% of VT patients had abnormal SAECG (p = 0.001). VT patients had more extensive endocardial abnormalities and more abnormal (53% versus 40%, p = 0.002), fractionated (8% versus 3%, p = 0.02), late (17% versus 8%, p = 0.0003), and late abnormal or fractionated (14% versus 4%, p = 0.0001) sites than CA patients. VT patients had a greater duration of the longest electrogram (129 versus 109 msec, p = 0.0006) and total endocardial activation time (68 versus 54 msec, p = 0.009). Among CA patients, those with induced VT had more extensive substrate than did those with induced PMVT and were similar to VT patients with induced VT. Among CA patients, the trend for more patients with inducible VT (77%) or PMVT (55%) than noninducible patients (47%) to have an abnormal SAECG did not reach statistical significance (p = 0.14). The positive and negative predictive values of an abnormal SAECG were 77% and 44%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS. VT patients have more extensive endocardial substrate than CA patients, which translates into greater and more frequent SAECG abnormalities. Among CA patients, there are significant differences in substrate between patients with induced VT and those with induced PMVT. SAECG is not useful in differentiating CA patients who have inducible VT or PMVT from those who do not.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND. Percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) is an acute, localized stimulus to platelet and vascular function. Periprocedural cardiovascular complications are reduced by moderate-dose aspirin (ASA), presumably due to inhibition of thromboxane (TX) A2. METHODS AND RESULTS. Excretion of TXA2 and prostacyclin (PGI2) metabolites in urine increased during PTCA. Pretreatment for 3 days with either moderate- (325 mg/day) or low-dose (80 mg/day) ASA inhibited the increase in both eicosanoids. Pretreatment for 3 weeks with fish oil (10 g/day) only partially suppressed TXA2. Formation of trienoic eicosanoids and accumulation of omega-3 fatty acids in platelet membranes confirmed fish oil ingestion. Although basal PGI2 was not inhibited, the PTCA-related increment was suppressed. CONCLUSIONS. PTCA results in an acute, transient alteration of eicosanoid biosynthesis consistent with accelerated platelet-vascular interactions. Pretreatment for 3 days with moderate or low doses of ASA suppresses TXA to a similar extent during PTCA, and their effects on acute cardiovascular complications of this procedure are likely to be comparable. It is unlikely that even prolonged pretreatment with fish oil can substitute for the platelet inhibitory action of ASA during PTCA. Suppression of PGI2 may contribute to the residual acute periprocedural complication rate in patients taking ASA.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND. Exercise hypotension has been documented in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. It is not the result of an inability to augment cardiac output but instead relates to an inappropriate and exaggerated decrease in systemic vascular resistance at high work loads. METHODS AND RESULTS. To enable us to examine the behavior of the peripheral vasculature during exercise, 103 consecutive patients underwent maximal symptom-limited supine bicycle exercise with measurement of forearm blood flow. A minimum reduction of 12% from the basal value was defined as a normal response based on the study of 25 normal controls. In the patients, two patterns of forearm blood flow were observed. Sixty-four patients had an appropriate reduction in forearm blood flow of 40 +/- 16% from resting flow. In 39 patients, the forearm blood flow either failed to decrease or increased with exercise by 45 +/- 105% of the resting value. Patients with an abnormal forearm vasodilator response were younger (31 +/- 13 versus 46 +/- 14 years), and more of them had a family history of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and sudden death than did those with a normal vasoconstrictor response (16 of 39 versus eight of 64). Left ventricular end-diastolic cavity dimensions were smaller in those with an abnormal forearm blood flow response, but other clinical, echocardiographic, and arrhythmic variables were similar. To assess the relation of abnormal peripheral vascular responses to erect exercise blood pressure response, patients underwent treadmill exercise testing with careful monitoring of systolic blood pressure response. Thirty-eight patients had significant exercise hypotension with failure of the systolic blood pressure to increase during progressive exercise (n = 6) or an abrupt decrease in systolic blood pressure (20-60 mm Hg) from the peak value (n = 32); 65 patients had a normal exercise blood pressure response, but 18 of these patients had an oscillation in systolic blood pressure of 10 mm Hg or more early in the recovery phase. Thirty-one of 39 patients with an abnormal forearm blood flow response demonstrated exercise hypotension during the erect exercise testing, and the remaining eight patients had a normal exercise blood pressure response; however, five of these eight had abnormal oscillations in blood pressure during recovery (r = 0.61, p less than 0.001). CONCLUSIONS. The relation of abnormal peripheral vascular responses to exercise hypotension confirms the observation of hemodynamic instability in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. The finding of abnormal vascular responses in patients known to be at increased risk (young age and a family history of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and sudden death) suggests that hemodynamic mechanisms may be important in the occurrence of sudden death in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.\r"

On average, significant RSA amplitude decline occurred 3 months before the last planned doxorubicin dose in patients destined to develop clinical congestive heart failure. CONCLUSION.

The influence of prophylactic low-dose aspirin on the clinical characteristics of subsequent nonfatal myocardial infarction was examined in the Physicians' Health Study, a randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled trial of alternate-day aspirin (325 mg) among 22,071 US male physicians. METHODS AND RESULTS. During 60.2 months of follow-up, 342 incident cases of nonfatal myocardial infarction were confirmed (95.2% of all reports): 129 on aspirin and 213 on placebo (p less than 0.00001). Despite this statistically extreme reduction in occurrence of a first nonfatal infarction attributable to aspirin, there were no significant differences in the size, location, electrocardiographic features, or postinfarction left ventricular ejection fraction between the aspirin and placebo groups. Furthermore, among those undergoing angiography, there were no differences in the distribution or number of coronary vessels obstructed. CONCLUSIONS. These data indicate that chronic platelet inhibition with alternate-day aspirin therapy reduces the risk of a first myocardial infarction but does not appear to have a significant effect on the clinical characteristics of events that are survived. This finding may result from a direct effect of aspirin or from an aspirin-induced shift in infarction severity. Regardless of mechanism, these clinical observations suggest that treatment decisions for acute infarction patients should be made independently of a history of aspirin use.\r"

  ".U": "91316834\r", 
  ".W": "BACKGROUND. In clinical color Doppler examinations, mitral regurgitant jets are often observed to impinge on the left atrial wall immediately beyond the mitral valve. In accordance with fluid dynamics theory, we hypothesized that a jet impinging on a wall would lose momentum more rapidly, undergo spatial distortion, and thus have a different observed jet area from that of a free jet with an identical flow rate. METHODS AND RESULTS. To test this hypothesis in vivo, we studied 44 patients with mitral regurgitation--30 with centrally directed free jets and 14 with eccentrically directed impinging wall jets. Maximal color jet areas (cm2) (with and without correction for left atrial size) were correlated with mitral regurgitant volumes, flow rates, and fractions derived from pulsed Doppler mitral and aortic forward flows. The groups were compared by analysis of covariance. Mean +/- SD mitral regurgitant fraction, regurgitant volume, and mean flow rate averaged 37 +/- 17%, 3.06 +/- 2.65 l/min, and 147 +/- 118 ml/sec, respectively. The maximal jet area from color Doppler imaging correlated relatively well with the mitral regurgitant fraction in the patients with free mitral regurgitant jets (r = 0.74, p less than 0.0001) but poorly in the patients with impinging wall jets (r = 0.42, p = NS). Although the mitral regurgitant fraction was larger (p less than 0.05) in patients with wall jets (44 +/- 20%) than in those with free jets (33 +/- 15%), the maximal jet area was significantly smaller (4.78 +/- 2.87 cm2 for wall jets versus 9.17 +/- 6.45 cm2 for free jets, p less than 0.01). For the same regurgitant fraction, wall jets were only approximately 40% of the size of a corresponding free jet, a difference confirmed by analysis of covariance (p less than 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS. Patients with mitral regurgitation frequently have jets that impinge on the left atrial wall close to the mitral valve. Such impinging wall jets are less predictable and usually have much smaller color Doppler areas in conventional echocardiographic views than do free jets of similar regurgitant severity. Jet morphology should be considered in the semiquantitative interpretation of mitral regurgitation by Doppler color flow mapping. Future studies of the three-dimensional morphology of wall jets may aid in their assessment.\r"

  ".U": "91316835\r", 
  ".W": "BACKGROUND. Measurement of regional left ventricular (LV) function is predicted on the ability to compare equivalent LV segments at different time points during the cardiac cycle. Standard techniques of short-axis acquisition in two-dimensional echocardiography, cine computed tomography, and standard magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) acquire images from a fixed plane and fail to compensate for through-plane motion. The shortening of the left ventricle along its long axis during systole results in planar images of two different levels of the ventricle, leading to error in any derived functional measurements. LV systolic long-axis motion was measured in 19 normal volunteers using MRI. METHODS AND RESULTS. With a selective radio frequency (RF) tissue-tagging technique, three short-axis planes were labeled at end diastole and standard spin-echo images were acquired at end systole in the two- and four-chamber orientations. Persistence of the tags through systole allowed visualization of the intersecting short-axis tags in the long-axis images and allowed precise quantification of long-axis motion of the septum, lateral, anterior, and inferior walls at the base, mid, and apical LV levels. The total change in position along the long axis between end diastole and end systole was greatest at the base, which moved toward the apex 12.8 +/- 3.8 mm. The mid left ventricle moved 6.9 +/- 2.6 mm, and the apex was nearly stationary, moving only 1.6 +/- 2.2 mm (p less than 0.001). Having quantified the normal range of long-axis shortening, we developed a technique that isolates a slice of tissue between selective RF saturation planes at end diastole. Combining this with a wide end-systolic image slice, end-systolic images were acquired without contamination of signal from adjacent tissue moving into the imaging plane. This technique was validated in a moving phantom and in normal volunteers. CONCLUSIONS. Significant LV systolic long-axis shortening exists, and this effect is seen the most at the base and the least at the apex. At a given ventricular level, shortening varied significantly according to location. A method using selective saturation pulses and gated spin-echo MRI automatically corrects for this motion and thus eliminates misregistration artifact from regional function analysis.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND. Percutaneous balloon valvuloplasty has proven to be acutely effective in the treatment of congenital valvar aortic stenosis; however, the intermediate- and long-term effectiveness of the procedure remain to be documented. METHODS AND RESULTS. To assess the intermediate-term effectiveness of balloon valvuloplasty, repeat catheterization was performed in 27 of 30 children 1.7 +/- 0.1 years after balloon valvuloplasty for congenital aortic stenosis (AS). In 33 children the peak AS gradient was reduced acutely by 55% from 77 +/- 4 to 35 +/- 3 mm Hg (p less than 0.001), and left ventricular systolic pressure was reduced from 176 +/- 4 to 138 +/- 4 mm Hg (p less than 0.001). Despite a technically adequate valvuloplasty procedure, three patients had inadequate relief of obstruction and required complex surgical intervention. Twenty-seven of the 30 patients available for late reevaluation (90%) enrolled in the follow-up study. The peak AS gradient remained significantly reduced compared with that present before valvuloplasty (29 +/- 3 versus 77 +/- 4 mm Hg, p less than 0.001). Furthermore, there was no difference in peak AS gradient at follow-up compared with that immediately after valvuloplasty. The greatest increase in gradient at reevaluation was 14 mm Hg. Twenty of 27 patients (74%) had no change in the degree of aortic insufficiency at follow-up compared with that present before valvuloplasty. At follow-up, 16 patients had no aortic insufficiency at all, and only two had moderate-to-severe (3-4+) insufficiency. Femoral artery injury was documented in four patients, three of whom were under 12 months of age at valvuloplasty. CONCLUSIONS. Balloon aortic valvuloplasty provides safe and effective intermediate-term gradient relief without early restenosis in children and adolescents with congenital AS.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND. We investigated the hypothesis that an ultrasound transducer positioned within an angioplasty balloon could be used to perform quantitative assessment of arterial dimensions before and after percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) and to identify certain mechanical alterations consequent to PTA, including vascular wall recoil and the initiation of plaque fractures. METHODS AND RESULTS. A combination balloon-ultrasound imaging catheter (BUIC) that houses a 20-MHz ultrasound transducer within and halfway between the proximal and distal ends of an angioplasty balloon was used to perform PTA in 10 patients with peripheral vascular disease. Each PTA site was also evaluated before and after PTA by standard (nonballoon) intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) technique. In eight patients in whom satisfactory images were recorded with the BUIC before PTA, luminal cross-sectional area (XSA) of stenotic sites (0.10 +/- 0.01 cm2) did not differ significantly from measurements of XSA by IVUS (0.09 +/- 0.01 cm2, p = NS). Likewise, minimum luminal diameter (Dmin) measured by BUIC (0.34 +/- 0.02 cm) was similar to that measured by IVUS (0.33 +/- 0.01 cm, p = NS). In nine patients in whom satisfactory images were recorded with the BUIC after PTA, XSA measured by BUIC (0.29 +/- 0.03 cm2) did not differ significantly from XSA measured by IVUS (0.30 +/- 0.03 cm2, p = NS). Dmin measured by BUIC after PTA (0.57 +/- 0.02 cm) was also similar to Dmin measured by IVUS (0.57 +/- 0.03 cm, p = NS). After PTA, XSA and Dmin measured immediately after deflation were significantly less than balloon XSA and diameter at full inflation, indicating significant elastic recoil of the dilated site. For the nine patients in whom post-PTA images were satisfactory for quantitative analysis, including four patients in whom recoil was 39%, 46%, 50%, and 61%, percent recoil measured 28.6 +/- 7.2%. Finally, plaque fractures were identified on-line in six of 10 patients (60%); in each case, initiation of plaque fracture was observed at inflation pressures of 2 atm or less. CONCLUSIONS. The results of this preliminary human investigation indicate that an ultrasound transducer positioned within an angioplasty balloon can be used to perform quantitative and qualitative analyses of lumen-plaque-wall alterations immediately preceding, during, and immediately after PTA in patients with peripheral vascular disease.\r"

We studied the effects on and possible interaction of balloon denudation and hypercholesterolemia on large arteries in the rabbit with special regard to structure and vascular reactivity. METHODS AND RESULTS. New Zealand White rabbits fed a 1% cholesterol diet or a standard diet for 14 weeks underwent balloon denudation of the left iliac artery 4 weeks before death. Both the balloon-injured and the control iliac arteries were harvested for in vitro studies of vascular reactivity, for immunohistochemical staining with monoclonal antibodies directed at smooth muscle cells and macrophages, and for scanning electron microscopy. Balloon injury caused intimal smooth muscle proliferation with little macrophage infiltration and was followed by recovery of endothelium-dependent vasodilator function within 4 weeks. Hypercholesterolemia caused macrophage-rich lesions confined to the intima with moderate impairment of endothelial vasodilator function. Balloon injury in the setting of hypercholesterolemia caused intimal smooth muscle cell proliferation and intense macrophage infiltration throughout the arterial wall and severe impairment of endothelial vasodilator function. Scanning electron microscopy confirmed regrowth of the endothelium in all balloon-injured vessels. In the balloon-injured arteries of hypercholesterolemic animals, the regenerated endothelium exhibited areas of atypical morphology not seen after balloon injury or hypercholesterolemia alone. CONCLUSIONS. The present study shows that balloon injury, hypercholesterolemia, and their combination cause distinct lesions and functional disturbances. An arterial balloon injury in the setting of hypercholesterolemia produces a diffuse inflammatory response that is accompanied by a sustained impairment of endothelial function and a marked proliferative response.\r"

  ".U": "91316839\r", 
  ".W": "BACKGROUND. Ischemia-induced electrophysiological changes are more prominent in epicardial cells than in endocardial cells. Epicardial action potentials shorten more than endocardial action potentials during ischemia. Since the L-type Ca2+ current plays an important role in the maintenance of action potential duration, we hypothesized that the Ca2+ current is affected more in epicardial cells than in endocardial cells during ischemia. METHODS AND RESULTS. To test this hypothesis, we examined the effect of metabolic inhibition, a major component of ischemia, on action potentials and the Ca2+ current in single cells isolated from the endocardial and epicardial layers of the feline left ventricle. The membrane voltage and current were measured by using the whole-cell mode of the patch-clamp technique. During control periods, action potentials recorded from epicardial myocytes had lower amplitude, a prominent notch between phases 1 and 2, and shorter action potential duration compared with those recorded from endocardial myocytes. However, the amplitude and current-voltage relation of the Ca2+ current were similar in endocardial and epicardial cells at test potentials of -30 to 60 mV elicited from a holding potential of -40 mV. The time course of inactivation of the Ca2+ current also was identical in the two cell types. After 15 minutes of superfusion with glucose-free Tyrode's solution containing 1 mM CN-, action potential duration was reduced by 13 +/- 7% in endocardial cells and by 80 +/- 9% in epicardial cells (p less than 0.01). The peak Ca2+ current was reduced by 21 +/- 9% in endocardial cells and by 37 +/- 6% in epicardial cells (p less than 0.01). CONCLUSIONS. We conclude that enhanced depression of the Ca2+ current may account in part for the greater action potential shortening in epicardial cells during ischemia and metabolic inhibition.\r"

  ".U": "91316840\r", 
  ".W": "BACKGROUND. Restenosis after percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty is associated with activation of medial smooth muscle cells (SMCs); they proliferate, migrate to the subintima, and narrow the vessel lumen. Cancer cells often express more cell surface receptors than do normal cells. This has allowed tumor cells to be specifically targeted using cytotoxic agents. We have examined whether a similar concept can be applied to rapidly proliferating but nontransformed SMCs. Pseudomonas exotoxin (PE; MW, 66 kDa) is a potent toxin that kills cells by inhibiting protein synthesis; its toxicity is diminished when its cell recognition domain is deleted to produce a 40-kDa protein (PE40). METHODS AND RESULTS. A complementary DNA encoding transforming growth factor alpha (TGF alpha) was ligated to that encoding PE40 and the chimeric toxin TGF alpha-PE40, which is cytotoxic to cancer cells displaying epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptors, was expressed in Escherichia coli. The ability of this toxin to kill proliferating SMCs was tested. When cells were seeded at low density (2,500 cells/cm2) and grown in medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, they were found to be rapidly proliferating; these cells were very sensitive to the cytotoxic effects of TGF alpha-PE40 (ID50, 4.0 +/- 0.17 ng/ml). In contrast, cytotoxicity was 30-fold less (ID50, 125 +/- 23 ng/ml; p less than 0.0004) when cells were in a quiescent state (grown in medium supplemented with 0.5% fetal bovine serum). CONCLUSIONS. Competition studies using excess EGF indicated that the cytotoxic effects of TGF alpha-PE40 are specifically mediated by the EGF receptor. EGF receptor binding analysis demonstrated that rapidly proliferating SMCs display 10-fold more EGF receptors than do quiescent SMCs in vitro. Thus, a chimeric toxin targeted toward the EGF receptor can selectively kill rapidly proliferating SMCs. Whether this toxin or other chimeric toxins directed against other cell surface receptors will effectively inhibit SMCs proliferating in vivo or be useful in preventing restenosis remains to be determined.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND. Cell-mediated autoimmunity has been strongly implicated in the pathogenesis of viral myocarditis. METHODS AND RESULTS. Using a murine model of acute myocarditis caused by coxsackievirus B3, we analyzed the phenotypes and morphology of the infiltrating cells in the hearts by immunofluorescence and electron microscopy. We also examined the expression of a cytolytic factor, perforin, in the infiltrating cells by immunoperoxidase and in situ hybridization. We found that the dominant population of the infiltrating cells were asialo GM1 positive, were negative for T-cell markers, and had electron-dense cytoplasmic granules, which is consistent with a morphology of large granular lymphocytes. Perforin was found in the cytoplasmic granules of the infiltrating cells expressing perforin messenger RNA. These findings provide for the first time the direct evidence that the first wave of cell infiltration in hearts mainly consists of killer cells and strongly suggests that perforin plays, in part, an important role in myocardial cell damage involved in acute viral myocarditis. T-helper cells and cytotoxic T lymphocytes made up the second wave of cell infiltration. CONCLUSIONS. As we previously reported, the expression of major histocompatibility complex class I antigen on cardiac myocytes induced by the infiltrating cells, such as killer cells, may facilitate the interaction between cardiac myocytes and cytotoxic T lymphocytes, and may lead to further myocardial cell damage in a later phase.\r"

We studied the effects of the phosphodiesterase inhibitor milrinone on left ventricular remodeling after acute myocardial infarction. METHODS AND RESULTS. Rats (n = 90) were randomized to undergo either left coronary artery ligation or sham operation. Three weeks after surgery, rats received either no treatment or milrinone, which was continued until 2 days before the rats were killed. Ninety days after the initial surgery, hemodynamic measurements were made before and after volume loading. The rats were killed, the hearts were removed, and passive pressure-volume curves were obtained. The hearts were fixed at a constant pressure and analyzed morphometrically. Compared with untreated infarcted rats, milrinone-treated infarcted rats had a lower left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (1.7 +/- 0.4 versus 4.3 +/- 1.4 mm Hg, p less than 0.05), a lower left ventricular volume (1.25 +/- 0.20 versus 2.37 +/- 0.30 ml/kg, p less than 0.001) and a lower left ventricular wall stress index (1.3 +/- 0.2 versus 1.7 +/- 0.1, p less than 0.05). Left ventricular chamber stiffness was higher in milrinone-treated infarcted rats than in untreated infarcted rats. Milrinone had no cardiac effect on uninfarcted animals. CONCLUSION. Chronic milrinone therapy after acute myocardial infarction improves cardiac hemodynamic indexes and attenuates progressive left ventricular dilation.\r"

Although plasminogen activator therapy has been shown to reduce mortality in patients with severe myocardial infarction, several problems fuel the search for more potent and specific thrombolytic agents. METHODS AND RESULTS. To explore the effect of plasminogen activator targeting to platelets, we covalently linked urokinase that had been modified with N-succinimidyl-3-(2-pyridyldithio)propionate to the Fab' of a monoclonal antibody (7E3) that selectively binds to platelet membrane glycoprotein (GP) IIb/IIIa. In an assay measuring (as reflected by plasmin generation) a plasminogen activator's ability to bind GP IIb/IIIa immobilized on plastic, urokinase-7E3 Fab' produced 31-fold more plasmin than did urokinase (p = 0.0001). The addition of solubilized GP IIb/IIIa blocked this enhancement of plasmin generation, indicating that binding was impaired. Plasmin generation reflecting binding to immobilized intact platelets was 2.4-fold greater for urokinase-7E3 Fab' than for unconjugated urokinase (p = 0.002). In a plasma clot lysis assay, urokinase-7E3 Fab' was at least 25-fold more potent than either urokinase alone or a mixture of urokinase and 7E3 (Fab')2 (p less than 0.009), and potency could be related to platelet concentration in the clot. Ex vivo, ADP-induced platelet aggregation was inhibited by a urokinase-7E3 IgG conjugate at a concentration of 8 nM, whereas a mixture of urokinase and 7E3 (Fab')2 in equimolar amounts required 60 nM and urokinase alone required 1 microM to achieve the same effect. CONCLUSIONS. Therefore, the targeting of urokinase to the GP IIb/IIIa platelet receptor both accelerates clot lysis (when platelets are associated with a fibrin clot) and inhibits platelet aggregation.\r"

  ".U": "91316844\r", 
  ".W": "BACKGROUND. Platelet-thrombus formation is a complication of arterial wall deep injury by balloon angioplasty that may lead to acute arterial occlusion and may contribute to restenosis. METHODS AND RESULTS. Because common platelet-inhibitor drugs with a heparin bolus (100 units/kg) may be effective in inhibiting platelet-thrombus formation after arterial angioplasty, these were compared with a bolus of heparin alone (control), the specific thrombin inhibitor hirudin (1.0 mg/kg), and saline (hirudin control) in normal pigs after angioplasty of the common carotid arteries. In the presence of deep arterial wall injury (injury exposing the media), indium-111-labeled platelet deposition (x 10(6)/cm2) was 68.8 +/- 12.3 and 48.1 +/- 16.9 in the control animals. This was significantly reduced by pretreatment with low-dose aspirin (1 mg/kg/day), by high-dose aspirin (20 mg/kg/day) plus dipyridamole, and especially by thrombin inhibition with hirudin. Treatment regimens with aspirin alone (20 mg/kg/day), dipyridamole alone, or sulfinpyrazone were ineffective. Likewise, the incidence of mural thrombosis was 75% and 80% in deeply injured arteries of controls and was significantly reduced to 46% with aspirin plus dipyridamole, 25% with low-dose aspirin, and 0% with hirudin. The incidence of mural thrombosis was unchanged with high-dose aspirin (69%), dipyridamole (90%), or sulfinpyrazone (92%). This mural thrombosis could not be identified by angiography. In the presence of mild injury (deendothelialization), platelet deposition was low (less than 10 x 10(6)/cm2, a single layer) and was not changed by any therapy, including hirudin. CONCLUSIONS. These therapies do not affect platelet adhesion to deeply or mildly injured artery. These data suggest a greater role for thrombin inhibition than with thromboxane or cyclooxygenase inhibition in the pathogenesis of platelet-rich mural thrombosis after deep injury during angioplasty. Antithrombotic therapy for arterial thrombosis by thrombin inhibition appears promising.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND. This study was designed to determine whether arterial reocclusion after thrombolysis can be prevented by lipoprotein-associated coagulation inhibitor (LACI), a physiological inhibitor of tissue factor-induced coagulation mediated by the extrinsic pathway. METHODS AND RESULTS. Thrombosis was induced in femoral arteries of anesthetized dogs with the use of anodal current to elicit extensive vascular injury and formation of platelet-rich thrombi in one artery and with thrombogenic copper wire to elicit fibrin-rich thrombi without appreciable vascular injury in the contralateral artery. Recanalization of both vessels was induced with t-PA (1.7 mg/kg i.v. over 1 hour) and verified with Doppler flow probes. Reocclusion occurred within 2 hours in seven of seven arteries with electrical injury-induced thrombosis and in four of seven arteries with copper wire-induced thrombosis in the absence of LACI. In dogs given infusions of recombinant DNA-produced LACI (225 micrograms/kg over 15 minutes, followed by 4 micrograms/kg/min i.v.) after completion of the infusion of t-PA, no reocclusion occurred during the 2-hour interval of observation in any of the five arteries subjected to electrical injury (p less than 0.001), and cyclic partial occlusions were nearly abolished (0.4 +/- 0.4/hr in LACI-treated dogs compared with 13.7 +/- 5.5/hr in saline-treated dogs, p less than 0.0001). In contrast, reocclusion occurred in two of five arteries with indwelling copper wires, and cyclic partial occlusions were unaffected despite LACI. LACI prolonged the partial thromboplastin time modestly (1.7 +/- 0.2 x baseline) but did not affect platelet counts or aggregation assessed ex vivo. CONCLUSIONS. Inhibition of the extrinsic pathway of coagulation with LACI prevents thrombotic arterial reocclusion after thrombolysis in vessels subjected to extensive vascular injury. Our results demonstrate that activation of the extrinsic pathway plays a critical role in thrombotic reocclusion and that LACI provides a highly targeted approach to facilitate sustained recanalization without directly inhibiting platelets.\r"

To test this idea, microspheres (15 microns in diameter) were repetitively administered into the left anterior descending coronary artery to cause microvascular embolization in dogs. Myocardial contractile and metabolic dysfunctions were significantly attenuated after treatments with recombinant human superoxide dismutase, an acyl derivative of ascorbic acid (CV3611, 2-O-octadecylascorbic acid), and xanthine oxidase inhibitor (allopurinol). The free radical scavengers and inhibitor enhanced the coronary hyperemic flow response during embolization, and the total number of microspheres causing maximal embolization was increased by these drugs. When 8-phenyltheophylline was additionally administered with superoxide dismutase, these beneficial effects were abolished, indicating that coronary effects of these drugs may be due to increased release of adenosine during coronary microvascular embolization. CONCLUSIONS. We conclude that oxygen radicals worsen the ischemic injury in coronary microembolization.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND. Little anatomic information is available on the annular myocardium. This study was conducted to determine the anatomic substrate for atrial flutter due to circus movement around the tricuspid annulus in the Y-shaped incision canine model of atrial flutter. METHODS AND RESULTS. We studied photographs of the annular myocardium serial histological sections, made in either of three different planes, and compared these with photographs of the intact and blocked gross heart specimens. We found that the annulus is the most caudal region of the atrial wall. The epicardial aspect of the annulus abuts the ventricular septum or the aortic root in the medial region; in other regions, it is covered by the fat of the coronary sulcus. Its endocardial aspect is delimited by the tricuspid leaflets inferiorly and by the pectinate muscle bundles superiorly, except in the medial region where the pectinate muscle bundles are absent. The annular myocardium is bilaminated. A continuous subepicardial circumferential lamina is the most prominent and is robust in the anterior, lateral, and posterior regions, but it attenuates to a fine muscular connection in the medial region. Myofibers of its superior border merge with the pectinate muscle bundles or are admixed in the medial region with myocardium at the base of the medial atrial wall. Its inferior border makes little contact with the annulus fibrosus about the ring; however, in the medial region, these myofibers insert into fibrous tissue superior to the septal leaflet. A discontinuous, subendocardial perpendicular lamina contains myofibers that descend from the atrium; most of these myofibers insert into the annulus fibrosus about the ring, but the lamina is absent in the anteromedial region. CONCLUSIONS. We conclude that the continuous circumferential lamina provides the anatomic substrate for circus movement of excitation in this model.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND. Previous studies have reported an important role for right ventricular function in the pathophysiology of the low cardiac output state that can accompany right ventricular infarction. Some studies have suggested that right ventricular distensibility impairs right ventricular filling and stroke output; others have demonstrated that the pericardium can mediate depressed left ventricular filling and stroke output. METHODS AND RESULTS. To determine the role of pericardial constraint and optimal volume loading in an experimental model of right ventricular wall infarction, six mongrel dogs were studied before and after right ventricular wall infarction and after volume loading. The pericardium was then opened in two phases. In the first phase, the pericardium was opened partially to allow the atria to distend freely, and in the second phase, the pericardium was opened completely. The animals were preinstrumented with two sets of piezoelectric crystals attached to the right ventricular free wall, one in the infarct and the other in the noninfarct territory. Left ventricular size was estimated by left ventricular crystals on the anterior wall of the left ventricle. Right ventricular and left ventricular Millar catheters were used to assess intracavitary pressure, and a flat balloon was used to assess intrapericardial pressure. Right ventricular infarction reduced cardiac output by 23% and stroke volume by 30%. End-diastolic segment length and transmural pressure of the left ventricle decreased. Volume loading restored cardiac output to baseline values and was mediated by a significant increase in end-diastolic length in the noninfarct territory. This was achieved by increasing right ventricular end-diastolic pressure from 9 +/- 2 to 16 +/- 3 mm Hg (p less than 0.01). Partial opening of the pericardium mediated significant increases in both end-diastolic segment lengths of the left ventricle and the noninfarct territory. Left ventricular end-diastolic pressure decreased slightly by 3 mm Hg (p = NS). Complete opening of the pericardium increased cardiac output and stroke volume and mediated a significant decrease in right and left ventricular end-diastolic pressures. Left ventricular transmural pressure and end-diastolic segment lengths of the left ventricle and the noninfarct territory increased. Left ventricular diastolic pressure-segment length relations were shifted upward by right ventricular infarction. A partial opening of the pericardium shifted this relation downward in all animals, and complete opening of the pericardium shifted the relation rightward and further downward. CONCLUSIONS. Cardiac output is restored to baseline values by volume loading sufficient to increase the right ventricular diastolic pressure to 16 +/- 3 mm Hg. Evidence of pericardial constraint was observed and appears to be mediated by an atrioventricular interaction in addition to the direct ventricular interaction.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND. The instantaneous hyperemic flow-versus-pressure (i-HFVP) slope index is a new method of assessing maximal coronary conductance and can be used as an alternative to conventional measures of coronary reserve. The i-HFVP slope index is determined by measuring the slope of the linear diastolic segment of the relation between instantaneous aortic pressure and hyperemic coronary flow. METHODS AND RESULTS. To validate the i-HFVP slope index as a measure of maximal coronary conductance, we compared this method with a microsphere-derived measurement of maximal coronary conductance (m-HFVP slope index) by determining the slope of the least-squares regression line of the data points for coronary flow during maximal hyperemia and four or five steady-state alterations of aortic pressure in 43 dogs (open-chest, anesthetized preparations) with or without coronary stenoses. The i-HFVP slope index demonstrated no dependence on heart rate, left ventricular end-diastolic pressure, or mean aortic pressure and was highly reproducible within the groups studied (intraclass correlation coefficient, 0.86 for normal arteries, 0.87 for stenotic arteries, and 0.93 for combined groups; for all coefficients, p less than 0.001). The i-HFVP slope index was significantly decreased in the presence of a stenosis (10.3 +/- 3.9 for normal arteries versus 3.6 +/- 1.6 for stenotic arteries, p less than 0.001) as was the transmural m-HFVP slope index (8.9 +/- 4.6 for normal arteries versus 5.3 +/- 3.1, p less than 0.01). Of special importance, the i-HFVP slope index measurement for normal arteries was not significantly different from the transmural and subendocardial m-HFVP slope index measurements (10.3 +/- 3.9 versus 8.9 +/- 4.6 and 9.2 +/- 5.7, respectively). For stenotic arteries, the i-HFVP slope index measurement was also not significantly different from the transmural and subendocardial m-HFVP slope index measurements (3.6 +/- 1.6 versus 5.3 +/- 3.1 and 4.1 +/- 2.3, respectively). The i-HFVP slope index correlated best with subendocardial m-HFVP slope index measurements (correlation coefficient, 0.57; p less than 0.001). When the 95% confidence intervals for the transmural (or subendocardial) m-HFVP slope index in normal arteries were compared with the i-HFVP slope index values, the latter demonstrated a systematic trend to overestimate the m-HFVP slope index. In the presence of a stenosis, this effect was minimized, and the slope values were nearly identical. CONCLUSIONS. The i-HFVP slope index correlates most closely with subendocardial coronary conductance; the index is a hemodynamically independent measure of coronary reserve that is reproducible over a broad range of aortic pressures; and the methodology is applicable to an intact circulation in experimental preparations and may with future developments also prove useful in humans.\r"

  ".U": "91316850\r", 
  ".W": "BACKGROUND. Prolonged, fractionated ventricular electrograms often are detectable after myocardial infarction and are a marker for an arrhythmia-prone state. QRS late potentials detected on the body surface with signal-averaged electrocardiography (SAECG) are thought to arise from the diseased tissue that generates prolonged ventricular electrograms and as such are also a marker for arrhythmias. A limitation of the current SAECG technique is that recordings are obtained from only three bipolar lead pairs. Because late potentials probably arise from multiple small sources in the heart, more extensive sampling of the body surface may contribute additional information to the SAECG. The present study investigates the additional sensitivity of SAECG using 64 body surface leads in detecting prolonged epicardial electrograms and examines its use in determining the epicardial location of prolonged electrograms. METHODS AND RESULTS. Dogs were studied before and 5-10 days after either lateral left ventricular (n = 13) or right ventricular (n = 8) myocardial infarction. Greater prolongation of signal-averaged QRS duration was detected with 64-lead SAECG (postinfarction QRS duration, 100.3 +/- 16.3 msec) than with three-lead SAECG (postinfarction QRS duration, 89.4 +/- 10.1, p = 0.0005). Nineteen of the 21 dogs (90%) had prolonged epicardial electrograms detected over the infarct. The correlation between epicardial electrogram duration and signal-averaged QRS duration calculated from individual leads was much better for 64-lead SAECG (r = 0.88, p less than 0.0001) than for three-lead SAECG (r = 0.53, p = 0.01), and the difference was most marked in cases with longer electrogram durations (more than 100 msec). Local late potential maxima on the thorax after lateral left ventricular infarction were located to the left and inferior compared with those after right ventricular infarction (p = 0.006). CONCLUSIONS. SAECG with more extensive recording from the body surface using 64 leads detects greater QRS prolongation than three-lead SAECG, and the longer QRS durations detected correspond to the duration of prolonged epicardial electrograms. Body surface location of late potentials corresponds to the epicardial location of the prolonged electrograms. This application of body surface mapping techniques to SAECG may permit more sensitive detection of arrhythmia-prone states and may aid in identifying arrhythmia sources.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND. Clinical evidence suggests that poor vascular runoff reduces the long-term success rate of femoral angioplasty procedures. The purpose of this experimental study was to examine myointimal hyperplasia of dog femoral arteries after balloon denudation, thermal laser arterial injury, or sham operation in normal and reduced vascular runoff conditions. METHODS AND RESULTS. Before mechanical balloon injury or transluminal heated laser probe motion, the peripheral vascular runoff of dogs was reduced by ligating the femoral artery below its three distal side branches, decreasing the femoral flow rate from 114 +/- 9 to 52 +/- 5 ml/min (mean +/- SEM). Endothelial denudation with a predominantly intact elastic internal membrane and circumferential structural changes in the media were noted by light microscopy 1 hour after balloon injury. Focal completely necrotic lesions of intima and media were found 1 hour after thermal laser arterial injury. After 8 weeks, the maximal thickness of neointima plus media of the site of previous intervention was greater after balloon injury (0.45 +/- 0.03 mm) and thermal laser injury (0.54 +/- 0.03 mm) than after sham operation (0.40 +/- 0.01 mm; p less than 0.001) in normal runoff dogs. Reduced vascular runoff augmented myointimal hyperplasia both in the balloon-injured and thermally damaged arteries; the wall thickness increased from 0.45 +/- 0.03 to 0.93 +/- 0.10 mm and from 0.54 +/- 0.03 to 0.65 +/- 0.05 mm, respectively (p less than 0.001). The neointimal and medial wall area of the balloon-injured arteries contributed 48% to the area encompassed by the external elastic membrane compared with an 81% portion when vascular runoff was reduced (p less than 0.01). A 47% neointimal and medial wall area was found in thermally injured arteries with normal runoff compared with 63% after runoff reduction (p less than 0.05). CONCLUSION. This study suggests that hemodynamic factors associated with poor vascular runoff play an important role in extending myointimal hyperplasia independent of method and severity of the arterial injury during angioplasty.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND. The heart can synthesize epinephrine. Homogenates of rat heart, which contain the enzymes phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase (PNMT) and nonspecific N-methyltransferase (NMT), methylate norepinephrine to form epinephrine. The cardiac atrium contains primarily PNMT and the cardiac ventricle contains both PNMT and NMT. METHODS AND RESULTS. Rats were given the glucocorticoid dexamethasone at doses ranging from 0.2 to 20 mg/kg. Twenty-four hours later, cardiac atria, ventricle, skeletal muscle, and adrenal had increases in PNMT activity to as much as 230% of baseline. NMT activity was unchanged. Longer-term treatment with 1 mg/kg dexamethasone daily for 12 days increased cardiac PNMT activity about fivefold and also increased atrial epinephrine levels. Dexamethasone did not alter ventricular epinephrine levels but increased levels of both PNMT and catechol-O-methyltransferase, the major catabolic enzyme for epinephrine. After dexamethasone treatment, greater volumes of anti-PNMT antiserum were needed to decrease PNMT enzymatic activity, indicating that dexamethasone treatment resulted in greater amounts of PNMT and did not just activate existing PNMT molecules. Denervation of the masseter muscle of rats by unilateral superior cervical ganglionectomy markedly diminished tissue norepinephrine and epinephrine levels but had no effect on masseter PNMT or NMT levels. We have previously shown that chemical sympathectomy with 6-hydroxydopamine increases cardiac PNMT levels. These findings suggest that PNMT is an extraneuronal enzyme in both cardiac and skeletal muscle. CONCLUSIONS. Glucocorticoids have several cardiovascular effects, including increased cardiac output and blood pressure. Enhanced cardiac epinephrine synthesis may mediate some of these glucocorticoid effects.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND. Sustained compression is recommended to maximize myocardial and cerebral blood flow during cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) in adults and children. We compared myocardial and cerebral perfusion during CPR in three groups of 2-week-old anesthetized swine using compression rates and duty cycles (duration of compression/total cycle time) of 100 per minute, 60%; 100 per minute, 30%; and 150 per minute, 30%. METHODS AND RESULTS. Ventricular fibrillation was induced and CPR was begun immediately with a sternal pneumatic compressor. Epinephrine was continuously infused during CPR. Microsphere-determined blood flow and arterial and sagittal sinus blood gas measurements were made before cardiac arrest was induced and after 5, 10, 20, 35, and 50 minutes of CPR. At 5 minutes of CPR, ventricular and cerebral blood flows were greater than 25 ml.min-1 x 100 g-1 and were not significantly different between groups. When CPR was prolonged, however, myocardial and cerebral blood flows were significantly higher with the 30% duty cycle than with the 60% duty cycle. By 35 minutes, all myocardial regions had less than 5 ml.min-1 x 100 g-1 flow with the 60% duty cycle. In contrast, CPR with the 30% duty cycle at either compression rate provided more than 25 ml.min-1 x 100 g-1 to all ventricular regions for 50 minutes. By 20 minutes, most brain regions received 50% less flow with the 60% duty cycle compared with animals undergoing CPR with the 30% duty cycle (p less than 0.05). Cerebral oxygen uptake was better preserved with the 30% duty cycle. Chest deformation from loss of recoil was greater with the 60% duty cycle compared with the 30% duty cycle. CONCLUSIONS. We conclude that the shorter duty cycle provides markedly superior myocardial and cerebral perfusion during 50 minutes of CPR in this infant swine model. These data do not support recommendations for prolonged compression at rates of 100 per minute during CPR in infants and children.\r"

  ".W": "This article is a review of the results of corticosteroid and immunosuppressive treatment in adults with idiopathic nephrotic syndrome. Adults with minimal-change nephropathy usually require a prolonged administration of corticosteroids to achieve remission which, in itself, carries the risk of severe and even life-threatening complications. Therefore, intravenous high-dose steroid pulses, alternate-day prednisone, short courses with cytotoxic agents and long-term administration of azathioprine have been suggested as alternatives to the classical prolonged corticotherapy. While most patients with focal-segmental glomerulosclerosis do not respond to short-term prednisone, almost half of the patients with nephrotic syndrome will attain remission with a more prolonged administration of corticosteroids and/or cytotoxic agents. A six-month course of methylprednisolone and chlorambucil preserves renal function and reduces the proteinuria in many patients with membranous nephropathy, even in the presence of initial renal insufficiency. Thus, there is growing evidence that corticosteroids and/or immunosuppressive agents can favorably alter the natural course of disease in many patients with idiopathic glomerulonephritis. However, these agents have a low therapeutic index. Further studies are needed to find more effective and less toxic treatment approaches in patients with primary glomerulonephritis.\r"

  ".W": "Cyclosporin A (CyA, Sandimmun) is the forerunner of a new generation of immunosuppressive drugs. It is highly effective in both antibody- and cell-mediated immunity and in inhibiting chronic inflammatory reactions. Cyclosporin A is, therefore, widely used to prevent rejection in clinical organ transplantation and appears to be very promising in the treatment of several autoimmune diseases. Cyclosporin A is not only effective when given at the time of sensitization (prevention of disease), but also when administered therapeutically during an immune response, such as during the active course of an autoimmune disease. The most important aspect of its immunosuppressive mechanism is the inhibition of lymphokine production secreted by activated T cells. The pharmacological effects of CyA are rapid in onset, dose-dependent and often quickly reversible when treatment is stopped.\r"

This article seeks to clarify the situation by considering the case for treating minimal-change nephropathy, focal and segmental glomerulosclerotic lesions, and mesangioproliferative lesions with predominantly IgM deposition as separate disease entities. In children, nephrotic syndrome has a pattern different from that in adults, in whom a wider pathogenetic spectrum is seen. There is support for the use of prospective clinicopathological data as the basis of identifying those patients with nephrotic syndrome who will progress to end-stage renal failure. Very heavy, persisting proteinuria is one marker of such progression and is also an indicator of metabolic complications, such as cardiovascular disease, which further increase the risks of mortality and morbidity in this group of patients.\r"

  ".W": "Cyclosporin A (CyA, Sandimmun) was given to 71 children with idiopathic nephrotic syndrome, 45 of whom were steroid-dependent with signs of steroid toxicity, and 23 who were steroid-resistant. Cyclosporin A was effective in 80% of the steroid-dependent patients, allowing cessation of corticosteroid treatment. However, most of these patients relapsed when CyA was tapered or withdrawn. In these patients, CyA may be required for long periods of time. Conversely, CyA was less effective in steroid-resistant patients; only 7% achieved remission with CyA alone. Cyclosporin A in association with prednisone may be an effective alternative as 8 out of 14 patients entered remission with this treatment combination. Serial renal biopsies were performed in 43 patients to evaluate the potential nephrotoxicity of the treatment. Eighteen patients developed significant tubulointerstitial lesions which were attributable to CyA nephrotoxicity. The risk of developing chronic nephrotoxicity appears to be higher in steroid-resistant patients, and was not related to the duration of treatment. Cyclosporin A nephrotoxicity can develop in patients with normal renal function.\r"

Sixty-four patients received CyA as monotherapy, and efficacy was assessed at three months; in 48 other patients, CyA was given with prednisone 12-15 mg/kg/day, and efficacy was assessed at six months. Of these 112 patients, 14 withdrew prematurely because of adverse events or other reasons, and a further nine patients were excluded for protocol violation. The remaining 98 patients were considered valid for the evaluation of efficacy (52 with minimal-change disease [MCD] and 46 with focal-segmental glomerulosclerosis [FSGS]; 37/98 were steroid-dependent [SD], and 61/98 were steroid-resistant [SR]). The remission:failure rate depended on histology (36:16 in MCD, 11:35 in FSGS) and steroid response (25:12 in SD, 22:39 in SR). The rate of remission was highest in SD MCD (71%) and lowest in SR FSGS (20%; chi square = 18.6, p less than 0.001). Tolerance was assessed by serum creatinine and, in 36 cases, by repeat renal biopsy at six to 42 months. Serum creatinine was remarkably stable in MCD. Rising creatinines were observed mostly in cases of SR FSGS, particularly those who had pretreatment interstitial lesions; this was considered due to both an increase of interstitial lesions and progression of the glomerular lesions of FSGS.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In membranous nephropathy, the data strongly support a positive effect in this disorder, but there have been no control trials thus far to indicate the risk-benefit ratio, the need for adjunctive therapy such as steroids, or what to expect in terms of time to response or duration of response. The risk of nephrotoxicity needs to be more precisely quantitated both from a functional and pathological perspective. Proper prospective controlled trials are needed to establish the safety and efficacy of CyA in this disease. In both IgA and membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis, the data are more sparse. Although isolated studies have suggested a benefit in both these categories, the risks are also evident and more careful pilot studies are indicated before any further conclusions can be drawn as regards the use of this agent in these disorders.\r"

Its treatment is aimed at inducing remission, preventing relapses and avoiding side-effects. Minimal-change disease is responsive to immunosuppressive therapy. The conventional treatment consists of glucocorticosteroids and the most widely used derivative is prednisone. Initial treatment should be intensive, for example, prednisone for 12 weeks, in order to reduce the risk of subsequent relapse. Treatment of relapses should be standardized in order to categorize the patient's disease for further treatment. If a frequent relapser develops signs of steroid toxicity, alkylating drugs should be prescribed: cyclophosphamide or chlorambucil for eight weeks for frequent relapsers who are not steroid-dependent; cyclophosphamide for 12 weeks for those who are. In steroid-resistant cases, a renal biopsy is indicated and treatment should be administered according to histological changes.\r"

We developed a questionnaire to assess parental knowledge of 16 health and safety features in their child's care facility. These health and safety features were identified by parents, in a pilot study, as being the most important features in a child care facility. This questionnaire was completed by 91 parents who use day care. Parents were well-educated employees of a health care institution. Our results indicate that even well-educated parents often do not check child care facilities for health and safety features. Parents tolerated a mean of 9.3% of 16 unsafe features and did not know the status of 22.4% of the features. Fifteen percent of the children has been removed from their child care facility because of health and safety concerns, 7.7% reported an injury. Our results suggest that it is important that physicians, during well child visits, include discussions about health and safety issues in the day care environment.\r"

An effusion was diagnosed by ultrasound in 71% but there were no factors, either clinically or by investigation, to differentiate between patients with or without an effusion. We conclude that multiple investigations to find a source of infection in patients with irritable hip are not warranted as they are rarely positive, seldom affect management and are of no help in investigating the etiology of irritable hip.\r"

METHODS: A questionnaire was mailed to the program directors of all 226 United States pediatric residency programs in October 1988. Institutions were queried about pediatric residency program and hospital demographics, along with specific day-to-day management issues in an intermediate care unit. RESULTS: The intermediate care unit offers highly skilled nursing care with greater than 90% of the units primarily covered by RNs in a 1:2 or 1:3 RN/patient ratio. The technologies used in these units were similar to those technologies used in an ICU, and the average daily bed charge was 40% less than the average daily bed charge in an ICU. However, an intermediate care unit was present in only 33% of pediatric training programs and pediatric residents were not specifically trained to care for patients in these units; 37% of these units did not have daily attending physician/nurse/resident rounds, despite the complexity and degree of illness in the patients located in these units. In addition, greater than 20% of intermediate care units were predominantly staffed by RNs with degrees less than BSN. Thirteen percent of these units had a predominance of RNs with only routine experience. CONCLUSIONS: Standard levels of care and academic and financial guidelines should be established to optimize the value of pediatric intermediate care units.\r"

RESULTS: The half-lives of distribution and elimination were 1.8 +/- 1.1 and 26 +/- 14 (SD) mins, respectively. The apparent volume of distribution was 2952 +/- 2332 mL/kg. The clearance rate was 454 +/- 900 mL/kg.min. Dopamine clearance was linearly related to dose only in patients who were also receiving dobutamine (r2 = .76, p less than .05). Hepatic and renal dysfunction did not affect the pharmacokinetics of dopamine. CONCLUSIONS: A relationship between dopamine and dobutamine that affects the disposition of these two drugs may exist. The pharmacokinetics of dopamine are variable even in hemodynamically stable children. Hepatic or renal function does not adversely affect the pharmacokinetics of dopamine.\r"

This pressure difference is most marked with prolonged CPR and can be abolished with administration of high doses of epinephrine. To better understand the mechanism of cerebral blood flow during CPR in humans, we determined the aortic-carotid artery pressure difference, the cephalic perfusion pressure (the carotid artery-jugular vein pressure difference), and thoracic inlet venous \"valving\" (the central venous-jugular vein pressure difference), while administering standard doses of epinephrine. DESIGN: Prospective study with randomization as to which side the carotid artery was catheterized. SETTING: The resuscitation room of a large urban hospital's emergency department. PATIENTS: Fifteen adults in normothermic, nontraumatic prehospital cardiac arrest treated according to Advanced Cardiac Life Support guidelines, including administration of 1 mg epinephrine iv every 5 mins. INTERVENTIONS: The descending aorta, cervical common carotid artery, internal jugular vein, and central venous system were catheterized. Pressures were recorded during standard CPR for 5 mins after administration of 1 mg epinephrine iv. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Most patients received CPR for greater than 20 mins before the first epinephrine dose and for greater than 45 mins before pressure recording as described above. There was no significant difference between aortic and carotid artery compression and relaxation phase pressures. The mean +/- SD compression central venous-jugular vein pressure difference was 22.1 +/- 15.0 mm Hg, and the mean cephalic perfusion pressure was 20.8 +/- 19.5 mm Hg. CONCLUSIONS: There is no clinically important aortic-carotid artery pressure difference during human CPR using the standard dose of epinephrine, even with prolonged CPR. Despite carotid artery patency and thoracic inlet venous valving, the cephalic perfusion pressure is low during CPR in humans.\r"

SETTING: The medical and surgical critical care units of a large, tertiary-care, private hospital. PATIENTS: Twenty-five male and 21 female translaryngeally intubated patients with respiratory failure, in whom tracheostomy was indicated on clinical grounds, were randomly assigned to one of two groups. INTERVENTIONS: The 24 patients in group 1 underwent conventional operative tracheostomy, and the 22 patients in group 2 underwent percutaneous tracheostomy. One patient in group 2 required tracheostomy on three separate occasions during a prolonged hospital stay. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Patients were examined daily throughout their hospital stays for adverse events related to the tracheostomy. In all patients who survived until decannulation, plain tomography of the trachea was performed within 3 days of decannulation. Repeat physical and tomographic examinations were performed 6 and 12 wks later. Fifty-eight percent (14/24) of the operative tracheostomies were associated with at least one complication, compared with 25% (6/24) of the percutaneous tracheostomies (p less than .05, 95% confidence interval 7% to 59%). Predecannulation problems were more frequent in group 1 patients than in group 2 (46% vs. 13%, respectively; p less than .01, 95% confidence interval 9% to 57%), as were later sequelae (88% vs. 27%; p less than .05, confidence interval 26% to 96%) in survivors. Group 1 patients were more likely to have multiple complications, and their complications tended to be more serious. CONCLUSION: In this study, percutaneous tracheostomy appeared to be superior to the conventional operation.\r"

DESIGN: Comparison of fiberoptic in vivo Svo2 values with in vitro Svo2 values obtained with a multiwavelength spectrophotometer. SETTING: Operating room in a university hospital. PATIENTS: Six consecutive patients who are Jehovah's Witnesses. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Before and after each step of hypervolemic hemodilution and after every 500 mL of blood loss, blood gases were analyzed and hemodynamic, hemoglobin, hematocrit, and in vitro and in vivo Svo2 measurements were made. Hematocrit values were measured in the range of 40% to 18%. Plotting all in vivo Svo2 values (n = 74) against the in vitro Svo2 measurements obtained during the entire study period gives r2 = .86. The accuracy of in vivo Svo2 measurements was not affected by changes in hematocrit or cardiac output. The Svo2 catheter value at the beginning of the study differed from the in vitro Svo2 value by -0.86 +/- 2.56% and at the end of the study period of 8 to 10 hrs by 0.71 +/- 3.04%. CONCLUSIONS: The accuracy of the studied fiberoptic continuous measuring Svo2 system was not affected by changes in hematocrit or cardiac output. No significant drift in the in vitro Svo2 measurements was observed.\r"

DESIGN: Randomized sequential experimental treatment bracketed by control periods. PATIENTS: Eight young healthy male volunteers with normal body weight (51 to 89 kg). INTERVENTIONS: Three experimental periods during which dopamine was administered iv in a randomized order at rates of 2.5, 5, or 10 micrograms/kg.min with one preinfusion baseline and two recovery periods in between. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: A significant (p less than .01) increase in resting energy expenditure was observed in response to the two highest dopamine infusion rates (5 and 10 micrograms/kg.min), corresponding to 6% and 15% median increases, respectively, as compared with preinfusion values. At the lowest dopamine infusion rate, no variation in resting energy expenditure was observed. Dopamine induced a significant (p less than .01) increase in hyperglycemia at all three infusion rates, and, at the highest infusion rate, dopamine induced a significant (p less than .05) increase of plasma free fatty acid concentrations. Insulin plasma concentrations were significantly (p less than .05 to p less than 0.1) increased at the three dopamine infusion rates. CONCLUSIONS: Dopamine infusion produces a dose-dependent thermogenic effect and induces various metabolic actions in man.\r"

SETTING: General adult ICUs in two teaching hospitals. PATIENTS: Eighty consecutive patients age 18 to 84 yrs (mean 63.4), 50 men and 30 women, 55% in the medical and 45% in the surgical services. METHODS: Gastric intramucosal pH was measured on ICU admission and again 12 hrs later. A value of greater than or equal to 7.35 was used to differentiate between normal and low gastric intramucosal pH. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Fifty-four patients had a normal gastric intramucosal pH and 26 patients had a low gastric intramucosal pH on ICU admission. The mortality rate was greater in the low gastric intramucosal pH group (65.4% vs. 43.6%; p less than .04). The frequency of sepsis and the presence of multisystem organ failure also were greater in the low gastric intramucosal pH group (p less than .01). Further stratification of patients according to gastric intramucosal pH measured 12 hrs after admission showed a greater mortality rate in patients with persistently low gastric intramucosal pH when compared with patients with normal gastric intramucosal pH during the first 12 hrs (86.7% vs. 26.8%; p less than .001). CONCLUSIONS: Measurements of gastric intramucosal pH on ICU admission, and again 12 hrs later, have a high specificity for predicting patient survival in this ICU patient population (77.8% to 80.6%). Furthermore, given its relative noninvasive nature, tonometrically measured gastric intramucosal pH may be a useful addition to patient monitoring in the ICU.\r"

SETTING: A ten-bed general ICU in a university hospital. PATIENTS: Eighteen critically ill patients who were being treated with gentamicin or tobramycin for severe infections, and were hemodynamically stable. INTERVENTIONS: The various clearances were measured simultaneously after the administration of a dose of aminoglycoside by assaying serial blood samples for aminoglycoside and creatinine concentration, and by measuring the content of these substances in urine collected over the same time period. OUTCOME MEASURES: The slopes, intercepts and coefficients of determination (r2) of the various regressions were determined, along with the 95% confidence intervals for the prediction of serum aminoglycoside clearance from each other variable. RESULTS: Renal aminoglycoside clearance, creatinine clearance, and estimated creatinine clearance accounted for only 58%, 59%, and 62%, respectively, of the variance in serum aminoglycoside clearance. Only 64% of the variance in renal aminoglycoside clearance was explained by creatinine clearance. Substantial and variable nonrenal aminoglycoside clearance was evident. CONCLUSIONS: The 95% confidence intervals for the prediction of serum aminoglycoside clearance from each index of renal function indicated that none of these indices provided acceptable accuracy for the prediction of serum aminoglycoside clearance and dosage requirements in critically ill patients. Renal aminoglycoside clearance was not better than creatinine clearance in this respect, and thus no other index of renal function is likely to be more accurate. This finding implies that the only accurate method of determining the dose requirements to achieve target serum concentrations in such patients will be individualized pharmacokinetic dosing.\r"

DESIGN: Continuous data collection on every patient admitted to the surgical ICU for a 21-month period. MATERIALS AND METHODS: For every admitted patient in the surgical ICU, APACHE II scores were calculated and the relationship between APACHE II score as an independent predictor of outcome was assessed with multiple outcome variables selected for study. The outcome and intervention variables tested included: treatment intervention measures such as days on ventilator; days with an arterial catheter, central venous catheter, triple lumen catheter, pulmonary artery catheter; days receiving total parenteral nutrition; days receiving tube feedings; number of transducers per days in the ICU; number of infusion pumps per ICU days, days in the hospital, number of complete blood counts; number of electrolyte determinations; number of blood gases; number of units of blood transfused; ICU and hospital mortality rates in the presence of complications, including: respiratory distress syndrome, renal failure, congestive heart failure, coma, requirement of cardiopulmonary resuscitation, and others. RESULTS: The APACHE II score was statistically associated with each intervention and outcome variable tested. Unfortunately, the associations, although consistent, were weak with r2 values ranging from .03 to a maximum of .22 for Pearson's correlation coefficients. CONCLUSION: The APACHE II score was statistically associated with all the variables examined in our surgical patients, but its predictive power for the individual surgical patient was limited. These findings suggest that the score may be useful for retrospective analyses of large cohorts of patients but should not be used as a triage tool or as a predictor of outcome for the individual patient. Triage decisions should continue to be based on the best available clinical judgment.\r"

DESIGN: Prospective, case-referent study. SETTING: University medical center special care and term nurseries. PATIENTS: Twenty-seven preterm and 25 term newborns with no evidence of cardiovascular problems. INTERVENTIONS: We determined the values for impedance cardiac output and stroke volume to be used as reference values. Also measured was the baseline transthoracic impedance, a number that reflects the air/fluid ratio of the thorax. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Stroke volume and stroke volume index were, respectively, 2.0 +/- 0.8 (SD) mL and 1.4 +/- 0.5 mL/kg for preterm infants, and 5.0 +/- 2.0 mL and 1.6 +/- 0.7 mL/kg for term neonates. Cardiac output and cardiac index were, respectively, 304 +/- 114 mL/min and 214 +/- 68 mL/min.kg for preterm newborns, and 648 +/- 244 mL/min and 205 +/- 78 mL/min.kg in term newborns. These values compared favorably with published values utilizing other techniques for these populations. Both cardiac output and stroke volume were linearly correlated to body weight, being largest in the heavier neonates. Transthoracic impedance values were 42.7 +/- 9.0 ohms and 6.7 +/- 1.7 ohms/cm for preterm infants and 32.3 +/- 4.3 ohms and 3.9 +/- 0.6 ohms/cm for term infants. Transthoracic impedance and transthoracic impedance/cm values were correlated negatively to body weight and were curvilinearly related to body weight. CONCLUSIONS: These values for transthoracic impedance and transthoracic impedance/cm are the first reported using the standard electrode lead configuration in neonates.\r"

  ".U": "91316992\r", 
  ".W": "BACKGROUND AND METHODS: Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) has been implicated as a major humoral mediator of sepsis and endotoxin shock. TNF is secreted by cells of the reticuloendothelial system, including alveolar macrophages. Alveolar macrophage TNF production has been postulated to play a pathogenetic role in the development of adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in sepsis. To evaluate alveolar macrophage production of TNF during sepsis and endotoxin shock, we studied the effects of sepsis and/or in vivo lipopolysaccharide on the in vitro production of TNF by pulmonary alveolar macrophages. Human pulmonary alveolar macrophages were obtained by bronchoalveolar lavage from six septic and five nonseptic patients, cultured in the presence or absence of lipopolysaccharide (1 ng/mL), and assayed for TNF activity in a bioassay using fibroblast lysis. A murine model of sepsis was also utilized to study pulmonary alveolar macrophage TNF production under more controlled conditions. Normal mice were given ip injections of either lipopolysaccharide or saline. After 2 hrs, pulmonary alveolar macrophages were obtained and cultured in saline or various concentrations of lipopolysaccharide (0.001 to 10 micrograms/mL). RESULTS: There was no difference in baseline TNF activity, expressed as per cent lysis at 1:10 dilution, between pulmonary alveolar macrophages from control and septic patients (35.7 +/- 5.5% vs. 24.4 +/- 9.3%, respectively) (p greater than .05). However, when stimulated with lipopolysaccharide in vitro, the pulmonary alveolar macrophages from nonseptic patients produced significantly (p less than .01) more TNF (82.8 +/- 3.6%) than did pulmonary alveolar macrophages from patients with the septic syndrome (35.2 +/- 3.8%). Similar findings were obtained using the murine sepsis model. The baseline TNF activity in pulmonary alveolar macrophages from control mice was 22.9 +/- 7.0% (mean +/- SEM) and from lipopolysaccharide-injected mice was 26.8 +/- 3.3% (p greater than .05). Stimulation with 1 ng/mL lipopolysaccharide in vitro produced an increase in TNF activity in both groups, but the increase was greater in the control mice (68.1 +/- 5.7%) than in the lipopolysaccharide-injected mice (47.5 +/- 5.3%) (p less than .01). When the murine pulmonary alveolar macrophages were stimulated with higher concentrations of lipopolysaccharide (0.1 to 10 micrograms/mL), pulmonary alveolar macrophages from lipopolysaccharide-injected mice produced less than 25.5% of the TNF produced by pulmonary alveolar macrophages from control mice. CONCLUSIONS: These studies indicate that sepsis and endotoxin injection result in a rapid decrease in the ability of pulmonary alveolar macrophages from both humans and mice to produce and secrete TNF in response to lipopolysaccharide. We speculate that a downregulation of TNF production or of macrophage responsiveness to lipopolysaccharide has occurred. These results suggest that sustained TNF production by macrophages is not required for lung injury in sepsis.\r"

  ".U": "91316993\r", 
  ".W": "BACKGROUND AND METHODS: The mechanism of ischemic bowel necrosis induced by platelet-activating factor is unclear. Since intestinal hypoperfusion is observed after platelet-activating factor injection, we hypothesized that mesenteric vasoconstriction is the mechanism of bowel injury. The present study investigated the effects of saline infusion on platelet activating factor-induced bowel necrosis and its mechanism. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into four groups: group A consisted of sham-operated rats; group B received platelet-activating factor (1.5 micrograms/kg iv); group C received platelet-activating factor and saline (0.097 mL/min iv); group D received platelet-activating factor and WEB 2086 (platelet-activating factor antagonist). RESULTS: Saline infusion largely reversed platelet activating factor-induced hypotension, hemoconcentration, and reduction of the superior mesenteric arterial blood flow. Saline infusion also ameliorated platelet activating factor-induced bowel injury, although a mild-to-moderate degree of necrosis still developed focally. In addition, saline prevented the platelet activating factor-induced increase in intestinal platelet-activating factor production. Saline also prevented the increase in intestine leukocyte number, as estimated by myeloperoxidase activity. CONCLUSIONS: Saline infusion is an effective treatment for platelet activating factor-induced shock and intestinal necrosis. However, focal bowel injury is still observed, suggesting that other factors besides hemodynamic changes contribute to the development of tissue injury. We also showed that, in vivo, platelet-activating factor stimulates its own synthesis via a positive feedback loop, which could be blocked by intravascular volume expansion with saline.\r"

Therefore, we examined the effects of pentoxifylline on alveolar macrophage functions in vitro. Alveolar macrophages were harvested from normal rat lungs by airway lavage. The dose-response relationship of varying concentrations of pentoxifylline and in vitro cell functions were examined. Macrophage functions studied included adherence to nylon wool, random (unstimulated) and zymosan-activated serum-stimulated migration through 5 microns millipore filters, and superoxide generation induced by zymosan-activated serum as assayed by cytochrome c reduction. RESULTS: Pentoxifylline inhibited superoxide generation and stimulated migration (but not random migration or adherence) in a dose-dependent fashion. Statistically significant inhibition was demonstrated at 0.5 mM and 5.0 mM concentrations of pentoxifylline, respectively, for stimulated migration and superoxide generation. CONCLUSIONS: Pentoxifylline can inhibit some alveolar macrophage functions in vitro. These effects may inhibit some forms of inflammatory lung injury, particularly when iv infusion of high doses of pentoxifylline are utilized. However, potentially adverse effects on inflammatory defense mechanisms must be considered as well.\r"

The isolated perfused normal rat pancreas was used to evaluate the effects of glucose and insulin secretagogues, such as arginine, beta-hydroxybutyrate, and gliclazide, on amylin secretion. Glucose and the other stimulants tested elicited a significant release of amylin from the rat pancreas in a biphasic pattern, similar to that of insulin. Dose-response studies of the glucose-induced release of amylin and insulin revealed that they possessed a similar dependency on glucose. However, the release of amylin induced by high concentrations of glucose was partially dissociated from that of insulin; that is, the amylin-insulin molar ratios induced by 22.2 and 33.3 mM glucose (1.11 +/- 0.05 and 1.05 +/- 0.04%, respectively) were significantly higher than those induced by 16.7 mM glucose (0.90 +/- 0.04%, P less than 0.01 vs. 22.2 mM glucose, P less than 0.05 vs. 33.3 mM glucose). Additionally, when the basal concentration of glucose in the perfusate was increased from 5.6 to 11.1 mM, the response of amylin was unchanged. These data suggest that amylin may be an islet hormone whose abundant response to high concentrations of glucose might contribute to the oversecretion of amylin in the hyperglycemia that accompanies diabetes mellitus.\r"

  ".W": "Cultured neuroblastoma, cerebral microvessel endothelial, and retinoblastoma cells were used to examine the mechanism of acute inhibition by D-glucose of myo-inositol uptake. Acute exposure of the cells to 30 mM D-glucose caused a significant decrease in Na(+)-dependent myo-inositol uptake in all three cell types. The effect of D-glucose to acutely inhibit myo-inositol uptake was dependent on the extracellular glucose concentration and was not reversed by sorbinil. 2-Deoxy-D-glucose (30 mM), 3-O-methyl-D-glucose (30 mM), and cytochalasin B (100 microM) did not acutely inhibit myo-inositol uptake. These data suggest that the hydroxyl groups on carbons 2 and 3 of D-glucose, which in a Haworth projection appear trans to each other, are important for inhibitory activity. Other monosaccharides (30 mM) having a similar 2,3-trans-diol configuration, L-glucose, D- and L-fucose, D- and L-galactose, D- and L-xylose, and D-arabinose, all to varying degrees significantly inhibited myo-inositol uptake. In all cases, the L-isomers were more potent inhibitors of myo-inositol uptake than the corresponding D-isomers. Monosaccharides (30 mM) having hydroxyl groups on carbons 2 and 3 in a cis configuration, D-mannose, L-rhamnose, D-allose, and D-ribose, did not acutely inhibit myo-inositol uptake. Replacing the hydroxyl group with a fluorine on carbons 2 or 3 of D-glucose negated its inhibitory activity of myo-inositol uptake. In contrast, replacing the hydroxyl group with a fluorine on carbon 6 of D-glucose did not block its inhibition of myo-inositol uptake.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Nondiabetic members of all pedigrees were examined by 75-g oral glucose tolerance test with fasting and 1-h insulin levels. Participants had height and weight recorded. Spouses of pedigree members (n = 88) served as control subjects. The spouse control subjects were older and slightly more obese than the undiagnosed pedigree members. The prevalence of IGT was 14.8% in spouses and 7.7% in pedigree members, and NIDDM was present in 11.3% of spouses and 2.3% of previously undiagnosed pedigree members. However, neither spouses nor pedigree members differed significantly from published age-specific prevalence rates for IGT or newly diagnosed NIDDM. Insulin and glucose levels were examined in pedigree members with normal glucose tolerance (NGT). Fasting insulin levels were not significantly different between spouses and NGT pedigree members. However, after adjustment for age, weight (body mass index), and sex, NGT pedigree members had higher 1-h insulin levels and higher fasting and 1-h glucose levels than spouses. These differences were also evident when pedigree members with at least 1 affected (NIDDM or IGT) parent were compared with spouses with no family history of diabetes.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

This study was undertaken to determine the potential role of changes in Rd and FFA on HGO in nondiabetic men. To determine if the fall in HGO during sleep could be reversed by FFA elevation, seven nondiabetic men underwent [3-3H]glucose infusions from 2200 to 0800, with heparin (90 mU.kg-1.min-1) added at 0200. Glucose appearance (Ra) fell from 11.7 +/- 1.1 at 2430 to 8.9 +/- 0.8 mumol.kg-1.min-1 (P less than 0.05) at 0200. The fall in Ra was associated with decreases in FFA (0.57 +/- 0.10 to 0.48 +/- 0.07 mM) and glycerol (0.08 +/- 0.01 to 0.06 +/- 0.01 mM). Infusion of heparin significantly increased FFA and glycerol (1.09 +/- 0.21 and 0.11 +/- 0.01 mM, respectively, P less than 0.01) and resulted in a significant fall in plasma alanine, suggesting that gluconeogenesis had been increased. However, rates of glucose turnover were indistinguishable from overnight studies without heparin. In additional studies (n = 6), intralipid and heparin-induced FFA elevation (from 0.61 +/- 0.07 to 0.95 +/- 0.05 mM, P less than 0.01) stimulated gluconeogenesis ([U-14C]alanine to glucose) twofold (188 +/- 22% increase compared to 114 +/- 6% in saline control studies, P less than 0.01). However, despite increasing gluconeogenesis, overall HGO did not change (10.6 +/- 0.5 vs. 10.7 +/- 0.6 mumol.kg-1.min-1) during lipid infusion.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

We found that recombinant tissue underwent morphogenesis and cytodifferentiation, thereby forming islets that contained cells immunocytochemically positive for insulin and glucagon. Islet cytodifferentiation occurred in approximately 20% of the recombinants. In recombinants that developed into islets, the tissue was always in close association with an extracellular matrix, nerves, and blood vessels. Controls consisting of mesenchyme alone or duct epithelium alone showed no evidence of morphogenesis of cytodifferentiation. Pancreatic rudiments were also implanted to serve as positive controls.

The aim of this study was to examine whether insulin has an effect, independent of blood glucose, on the subjective, cognitive, and hormonal responses to hypoglycemia. Nine patients with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) participated in three hyperinsulinemic glucose-clamp studies. After 60 min at 4.5 mM, blood glucose was randomized to be 1) maintained at 4.5 mM for 240 min, 2) lowered to 2.8 mM for 180 min followed by 60 min at 2 mM with an insulin infusion rate of 40 mU.m-2.m-1, and 3) fitted to the same protocol as 2 but with an infusion rate of 120 mU.m-2.min-1. Symptoms and awareness of hypoglycemia (100-mm visual analogue scales), cognitive function, and counterregulatory hormone levels were assessed every 30 min. There were no subjective or cognitive changes during the euglycemic study. Awareness and hypoglycemic symptoms (hunger, facial flushing, trembling, and sweating) were attenuated by the higher insulin infusion rate (P less than 0.05 and P less than 0.01, respectively). Cognition was significantly impaired after 60 min at 2.8 mM (P less than 0.001) and deteriorated further when the blood glucose level was lowered to 2 mM (P less than 0.01). Levels of cortisol (P less than 0.01) and growth hormone (P less than 0.05) but not epinephrine were suppressed by the higher insulin infusion rate.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Rat synthetic amidated islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP) was infused into conscious Long-Evans rats chronically instrumented for the measurement of regional hemodynamics. Rat IAPP (0.25-2.5 nmol.kg-1.min-1) had dose-dependent tachycardiac and hypotensive effects. Renal blood flow increased at all dose levels in association with incremental rises in renal vascular conductances. Hindquarters blood flow and vascular conductance increased at the higher dose levels, but mesenteric blood flow fell with mean arterial blood pressure (i.e., there was no change in mesenteric vascular conductance). Concurrent infusion of 25 nmol.kg-1.min-1 human alpha-calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) (8-37) abolished the hypotensive, tachycardiac, and renal and hindquarters vasodilator effects of rat IAPP, and during administration of both peptides, there was a transient renal and sustained mesenteric vasoconstriction. When the infusion of human alpha-CGRP (8-37) was stopped, the effects of the continued infusion of rat IAPP were reestablished. The results indicate that the reported ability of IAPP to induce insulin resistance cannot be due to decreased skeletal muscle blood flow. In addition, human alpha-CGRP (8-37) is an effective antagonist of the hemodynamic actions of rat IAPP. Because it has been shown previously that human alpha-CGRP (8-37) antagonizes the hemodynamic effects of human alpha-CGRP, these results, collectively, indicate that human alpha-CGRP and rat IAPP might act on the same receptor at which human alpha-CGRP (8-37) is an effective antagonist or that the latter is a nonselective antagonist of separate receptors on which human alpha-CGRP and rat IAPP act.\r"

The age of subjects, the duration of IDDM, and the metabolic control of patients were taken into account. P300 values were significantly increased in IDDM versus matched control subjects (P less than 0.001), and 3 patients showed values above the reference value range. Abnormal VEP recordings were present in 1 of 16 patients, BAEP in 3 of 16, mSEP in 7 of 16, and tSEP in 6 of 16. Digit-span backward test results were significantly (P less than 0.02) modified in the diabetic cohort. There was no tendency for anomalies of P300, short-latency EPs, and psychometric test values to be contemporarily present, except in 1 patient. Electrophysiological or psychometric abnormalities were not clearly correlated with the duration of IDDM or the degree of short-term metabolic control. These findings give evidence that 1) higher cognitive functions may be affected in diabetes as documented by P300 analysis and short-term memory tests, 2) endogenous electrophysiological analysis highlights neuropsychological changes not detectable by psychometric tests, 3) an alteration of evoked potentials was present in half of the IDDM subjects studied, and 4) anomalies of the CNS are patchily distributed in diabetes.\r"

IGF BP-1 and BP-3 were measured by ligand blotting, total IGF-I was determined by radioimmunoassay after separation from BPs by isocratic high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) at pH 3.9, and free IGF-I was estimated operationally as immunoreactivity with molecular weight equal to native IGF-I after HPLC at pH 7.

In contrast, animals given 72 mg/kg STZ (glucose level 24.64 mM and weight loss) had insignificant changes in total IGF-I and BP-3 but a 300% increase in BP-1 and a 50% fall in free IGF-I (both P less than 0.005).

An anti-idiotypic antibody (anti-TH) that inhibited TH-IAA binding to human insulin was obtained by immunizing BALB/c mice with TH-IAA. Anti-TH bound to viable IM-9 cells and the purified insulin receptor from IM-9 cells. Anti-TH binding to IM-9 cells and the insulin receptor was inhibited by TH-IAA but not by human IgG. Moreover, incubation of HepG2 cells with anti-TH had an inhibitory effect on insulin binding to HepG2 cells. Anti-TH, like insulin, stimulated amino acid uptake in HepG2 cells. These findings indicate that the conformation of TH-IAA idiotope is a mirror image of the determinant on the insulin B chain, the binding site for TH-IAA on anti-TH is also related to the insulin binding site on the insulin receptor, and anti-TH mimics insulin action on the insulin receptor.\r"

Twenty-two (13.9%) developed type I diabetes in a follow-up of up to 12 yr (mean +/- SE 4.8 +/- 3.2 yr). The probability of being free of type I diabetes was 69.8% at 10 yr after the first detection of ICAs. Progression to disease was influenced by 1) the amount of ICAs represented by high titers (63% of those with ICAs greater than or equal to 20 Juvenile Diabetes Foundation units being free of type I diabetes at 10 yr), ICA persistency (59% being free of type I diabetes; P less than 0.02 vs. nonpersistent ICA), and complement-fixing (CF)-ICAs (63% being free of type I diabetes; P less than 0.05 vs. non-CF-ICA); 2) the coexistence of insulin autoantibodies (IAAs) (25% being free of type I diabetes; P less than 0.005 vs. IAA-); and 3) a positive family history (1st-degree relative) for type I diabetes (32% being free of type I diabetes; P less than 0.005 vs. no family history).

Increased secretion of proinsulin relative to insulin is thought to be the cause, although differential changes in clearance have not been ruled out. This study was conducted in a rat model of NIDDM, 90% pancreatectomized (Px) rats, to investigate the pathophysiology of this observation. Proinsulin storage and secretion were assessed with high-performance liquid chromatography separation of the insulins and the proinsulins, followed by quantification of the peaks by insulin radioimmunoassay. In Px rats, the relative proportion of proinsulin in pancreas extracts was twice that of control (sham-operated) rats (15.6 +/- 1.4 vs. 8.3 +/- 1.4%, P less than 0.01). Samples obtained from the portal vein during in vitro pancreas perfusion also had an elevated proinsulin fraction (Px, 10.3 +/- 3.0; sham, 3.0 +/- 0.6%; P less than 0.006). In summary, 90% Px rats share many pathophysiological features with NIDDM, including loss of normal proinsulin homeostasis. Our results suggest that chronic hyperglycemia causes an intrinsic change in beta-cells that is characterized by the increased storage and secretion of proinsulin.\r"

Three columns were exposed either to continuous, pulsatile, or no insulin. After 3 h, total nucleic acid was extracted, and mRNA(PEPCK) was measured with a sensitive-solution hybridization assay. Continuous insulin inhibited PEPCK expression in a dose-dependent fashion with EC50 1 x 10(-11) M. Equivalent time-averaged amounts of insulin delivered as pulses achieved significant inhibition but less effectively than continuous insulin. The apparent EC50 for pulsatile insulin increased from 2 x 10(-11) M to 5 x 10(-11) M as the oscillatory period was raised from 5 to 20 min, respectively. These observations suggest that insulin-mediated inhibition of PEPCK gene transcription is diminished by a pulsatile mode of administration in marked contrast to the pulse enhancement demonstrated for glucagon-mediated hepatic glucose production.\r"

  ".W": "In this study, we administered constant intravenous infusions of human islet amyloid polypeptide (hIAPP) to conscious dogs during euglycemic glucose-clamp studies. The doses of hIAPP used (5 and 50 pmol.kg-1.min-1) raised the circulating IAPP levels approximately 12- and 50-fold above basal levels, respectively. Studies were conducted at two different insulin infusion rates, resulting in steady-state plasma insulin levels of approximately 600 and 2800 pM. According to our results, the hIAPP infusions did not lead to any measurable change in the insulin-stimulated glucose disposal rate at either insulin infusion rate. Additionally, we observed no effect of IAPP on hepatic glucose production. Although we did not observe any effect of hIAPP on any of the aspects of glucose or insulin metabolism measured, we did find a consistent hypocalcemic effect of this peptide at the 50-pmol.kg-1.min-1 infusion rate. Shortly after the onset of hIAPP infusion, serum calcium levels fell by 10-15% and remained at these levels throughout the course of the hIAPP infusion. In summary, 1) infusion of hIAPP at doses of 5 or 50 pmol.kg-1.min-1 in conscious dogs raised the circulating IAPP level 12- to 50-fold above basal; 2) during these infusion studies, no effect of hIAPP was observed on any of the aspects of glucose or insulin homeostasis measured; 3) 50 pmol.kg-1.min-1 hIAPP lead to a prompt reduction in plasma calcium concentrations with intravenous administration.\r"

The contributions of the cephalic-vagal and gastrinergic mechanisms to this interaction were examined in two 14-hour randomized, cross-over studies in 24 healthy volunteers. In the first study, either ranitidine or placebo was administered IV by a pH-feedback-controlled infusion pump during fasting, modified sham feeding, or food ingestion. Sham feeding resulted in a well-defined and abrupt interaction with the antisecretory effect of ranitidine (lasting 2-3 hours), after which fasting pH levels were regained. The second study, with the same design, showed that gastrin release occurred during this cephalic-vagal phase but was not attenuated by the additional infusion of the anticholinergic pirenzepine. Following eating, intragastric acidity increased and remained elevated for more than 6 hours. This increase was accompanied by prolonged hypergastrinemia, which was not diminished by pirenzepine. Pirenzepine did, however, enhance the antisecretory effect of ranitidine after both sham feeding and food ingestion. The interaction of food or sham feeding with the antisecretory effect of H2 antagonists is a consistent phenomenon. In both the cephalic-vagal and the gastric phases of secretion, this interaction appears to be partially mediated by a noncholinergic release of gastrin.\r"

  ".W": "Abdominal distention during pneumoperitoneum results in a marked increase in plasma arginine vasopressin levels, which has been ascribed to an increase in intrathoracic pressure. Because of this relationship, tense ascites could contribute to nonosmotic release of antidiuretic hormone, to the development of hyponatremia, and eventually to further ascites formation. The effect of pneumoperitoneum, thoracocentesis, and paracentesis on plasma arginine vasopressin levels was studied in three groups of patients, and the mechanism by which these maneuvers may induce these changes was investigated. Patients with pleural effusion, pneumothorax, or ascites showed a significant increase in plasma arginine vasopressin levels, and thoracocentesis or paracentesis resulted in a decrease in these levels. Plasma vasopressin levels increased significantly during pneumoperitoneum, as did intrathoracic and atrial pressures; the atrial transmural pressure gradient declined. However, no changes in plasma levels of norepinephrine, aldosterone, and renin activity were observed during pneumoperitoneum. Changes in plasma arginine vasopressin levels correlated with the changes in intrathoracic and atrial pressures and transmural pressure gradient. The authors conclude that increased intrathoracic pressure is associated with an increase in plasma arginine vasopressin levels and propose that ascites could be a factor promoting vasopressin release by acting on intrathoracic volume receptors in decompensated cirrhotics.\r"

Homogeneous immunolabeling of the whole colonic epithelium with the monoclonal antibody 4H3 was often observed, whereas labeling with the monoclonal antibody 8A9, if any, was either restricted to a few crypts and plateaus. The two antibodies were used to perform specific immunoprecipitation of the corresponding antigen, the N-terminal sequence of which was determined after sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis purification and electroblotting, and were compared with those of other species. In secretor blood group A humans, both the sucrase-isomaltase and the dipeptidylpeptidase IV have type 3 blood group A determinants.\r"

  ".W": "To determine the incidence and outcome of intestinal obstruction during shigellosis, the authors assessed 1211 consecutive patients with shigellosis admitted during a 15-month period to a diarrhea treatment center in Dhaka, Bangladesh. Obstruction was identified in 30 (2.5%) patients. Ten (33.3%) of these patients died, compared with 97 (8.2%) of the 1181 patients without obstructions (P less than 0.001; RR = 4.1). In a case-control study, patients with obstructions were compared with 30 control patients with shigellosis but without obstructions. Case and control patients were similar in age (median, 18 months vs. 24 months; NS). Before admission to the hospital, case patients had less often been breast-fed than control patients (33% vs. 85%; P = 0.006) and had more often received antimicrobial agents (53% vs. 13%; P = 0.001). Case patients more often had abdominal tenderness (73% vs. 13%; P less than 0.001), altered consciousness (50% vs. 17%; P = 0.006), and Shigella dysenteriae type 1 infection (73% vs. 27%, P = 0.001) and had a higher median blood leukocyte count (40 x 10(3)/microL vs. 14 x 10(3)/microL; P = 0.007) and serum potassium concentration (5.0 mmol/L vs. 4.3 mmol/L; P = 0.016), and lower median serum sodium (123 mmol/L vs. 131 mmol/L; P = 0.003) and total protein (52 g/L vs. 60 g/L; P = 0.025) concentrations than did control patients. Eight (27%) patients with obstructions developed the hemolytic-uremic syndrome, compared with none of the control patients (P = 0.003). It was concluded that obstruction is an ominous complication of shigellosis and that therapies in addition to provision of antimicrobial agents need to be evaluated.\r"

In this study, the goal was to confirm these results by a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind crossover study in 10 patients with rectal polyps that had been previously treated by colectomy and ileorectal anastomosis. Patients received sulindac, 300 mg/day, or placebo during two 4-month periods separated by a 1-month wash-out phase. One patient was not compliant and was excluded. With sulindac, the authors observed a complete (6 patients) or almost complete (3 patients) regression of the polyps. With placebo, the authors observed an increase (5 patients), no change (2 patients), and a relative decrease (2 patients) in the number of polyps. The difference between sulindac and placebo was statistically significant (P less than 0.01). In biopsy specimens of polyps and normal rectal mucosa of 6 patients, the authors conducted an immunohistochemical study of the cellular proliferation index using the Ki 67 monoclonal antibody (Ki 67 index), at the beginning and at the end of each treatment period. They were not able to show a sulindac-induced modification of the Ki 67 index. The authors conclude that sulindac is effective in inducing the regression of rectal polyps in familial adenomatous polyposis.\r"

Exposure of colonic explants to 5 nmol/L 125I-labeled epidermal growth factor for 60 minutes at 22 degrees C revealed extensive accumulation at binding sites in undifferentiated cells of the crypts and at the base of the villus, as well as in the inner circular layer of the muscularis externa bordering the submucosa. Some labeling was also present in the mesenchymal and vascular elements of the lamina propria. Labeling was virtually absent on the brush border at all levels of the epithelium. Quantitative analysis revealed a distinct gradient in grain density along the various compartments of the crypt-villus axis. Epithelial cells in the deep portions of the crypts showed the highest grain density (9.2 grains/microns 2) with values gradually decreasing to 6.5 in upper crypt and 3.9 in lower villus cells. The upper third of the villus showed very little labeling (0.4 grains/microns 2). Cellular distribution of silver grains in lower villous cells revealed a polarization of labeling in the basolateral infranuclear region. Experiments performed at 4 degrees C and at various incubation times showed similar results. Using isolated loops of intact colon and jejunum, segments in which labeled epidermal growth factor was only accessible on the serosal side showed extensive labeling and distribution similar to that found in explanted tissue. On the other hand, labeled epidermal growth factor could not access these same receptor sites when infused into the lumen, either at 22 degrees C or 4 degrees C. These results show that in the human fetal gut (a) the greatest concentration of epidermal growth factor binding sites is found in regions of high proliferative activity and (b) binding sites are absent from the brush border, suggesting that, under normal circumstances, systemic but not luminal epidermal growth factor has free access to its specific receptor.\r"

  ".W": "Current methods for the study of the toxicological effects of antisecretory medications on the gastric mucosa possess disadvantages or limitations. A novel assay has been proposed to assess gastric mucosal genotoxicity in which the proton-pump inhibitor omeprazole has been reported to induce direct damage to cellular DNA, raising questions about the safety of this drug. To define the applicability of this proposed measure of genotoxicity and to examine the effects of omeprazole in this assay, control agents, known carcinogens, and omeprazole in various doses and formulations were administered to rats by gavage, followed by [3H]thymidine labeling of DNA in vivo approximately 14 hours later. The incorporation of the [3H]thymidine label into DNA of gastric mucosal cells liberated by limited pronase digestion was in close agreement with published results for negative and positive controls. Omeprazole, administered in doses ranging from 10 mg/kg to 300 mg/kg, did not increase [3H]thymidine incorporation into cellular DNA in this assay. The gastric carcinogen 1-methyl-2-nitro-1-nitrosoguanidine at 20 and 50 mg/kg increased [3H]thymidine incorporation. Pretreatment in vivo with hydroxyurea before [3H]thymidine labeling to inhibit replicative DNA synthesis suppressed [3H]thymidine incorporation more than 97% in negative controls and MNNG and more than 93% in omeprazole treatments. This indicates that replicative DNA synthesis was almost totally responsible for the [3H]thymidine incorporation and the contribution of unscheduled DNA synthesis to the total [3H]thymidine incorporation is minor. Flow cytometric analysis of the cell cycle of the gastric mucosal cells liberated by the limited pronase digestion indicated significant contamination of the preparation with dividing cells (4% in negative controls and 14% in MNNG-treated positive controls). These findings indicate that the proposed screening assay for genotoxicity in rat gastric mucosa is not a reliable measure of unscheduled DNA synthesis in its present form, and conclusions about genotoxic effects of any drug using this assay as initially proposed appear questionable.\r"

The pharmacological and electrophysiological properties of this hypertrophied muscle were studied. Carbachol produced phasic and tonic contractions of the circular muscle. The EC50 for tonic contractions was greater for hypertrophied than for normal muscle (21.1 +/- 3.9 mumol/L vs. 4.8 +/- 2.2 mumol/L; P less than 0.05). The resting membrane potential difference of hypertrophied muscle (-50.8 +/- 0.2 mV) was similar to that of normal muscle (-50.0 +/- 0.2 mV). Electrical stimulation of intrinsic nerves in the normal muscle produced a hyperpolarization followed by a depolarization of smooth muscle membrane potential. Hypertrophied muscle responded either with an attenuated hyperpolarization or no hyperpolarization, both of which were followed by a depolarization. The space constant in the long axes of the hypertrophied circular muscle cells was greater than normal (4.4 +/- 0.2 mm vs. 3.4 +/- 0.1 mm; P less than 0.001). The threshold potential for initiation of action potentials was more negative for hypertrophied (-43.2 +/- 0.4 mV) than for normal circular muscle (-41.6 +/- 0.2 mV; P less than 0.005). These data indicate that alterations in neuromuscular function accompany the hypertrophy of esophageal smooth muscle.\r"

Contractions were recorded by strain gauge transducers, and mean transit time was measured by marker dilution technique. The mean amplitude and area of individual phasic contractions decreased, but no change occurred in their mean duration during trichinosis. The total amplitude and area of phasic contractions also decreased; this was caused by a decrease in the frequency of contractions as well as a decrease in the mean parameters. The reduction in the total duration was entirely caused by the decrease in frequency. The reduction in the total parameters of all contractions was the result of a reduction in the same parameters for both propagating and nonpropagating contractions. However, the decrease in the parameters of propagating contractions was much greater. Also, there was a decrease in the distance of propagation of phasic contractions. The transit time as a result of phasic contractions increased during T. spiralis infection. Additionally, T. spiralis infection induced giant migrating contractions in the fed state that were never observed during control. Chyme was propelled very rapidly and effectively by giant migrating contractions. The findings of the present study suggest that during diarrhea induced by T. spiralis infection, the phasic contractions may act to decrease transit and, hence, allow more contact time for absorption of water and nutrients. However, this response may be counter-balanced by giant migrating contractions that rapidly propel chyme into the colon and compound the diarrhea associated with T. spiralis infection.\r"

The ratio of delta(+) cells to CD3(+) cells in the intraepithelial space of colon was decreased in Crohn's disease (13%) and strikingly decreased in ulcerative colitis (8%) compared with the control (36%). Delta(+) cells in the lamina propria were also decreased, particularly in the distal ileum of Crohn's disease (4%), compared with the control (15%). On the contrary, the cells gathered at the severe inflammatory sites with other inflammatory cells, including beta(+) cells, and were densely distributed in the T-cell zone around lymphoid follicles. Phenotypic characterization showed that delta(+) lamina proprial lymphocytes of colon were mainly CD4(-)CD8(-) in the control (80%) and Crohn's disease (59%). However, in ulcerative colitis, CD4(-)CD8(-) delta(+) lymphocytes were rarely found (3%). This reflects the difference of immunologic background between the two diseases. Immunoelectron microscopically, these cells in inflammatory bowel disease were rich with vesicular structures in cytoplasms, whereas those in the control group contained electron-opaque granules. The decrease and the morphological change may be closely related to the weakness of mucosal defense.\r"

To assess whether the improvement with the pouch is due to the absence of a stoma or the preservation of fecal continence, functional and performance activities were assessed in 406 patients with Brooke ileostomies (stoma present, incontinent), 313 with Kock pouches (stoma present, continent), and 298 with ileal pouch-anal anastomoses (stoma absent, continent). All patients underwent proctocolectomy for ulcerative colitis or familial adenomatous polyposis. After adjusting for age, sex, diagnosis, attitude towards the operation, dietary satisfaction, and ability to work, the likelihood of an impact on performance was estimated for the three types of operation using logistic regression analysis. Patients with ileal pouch-anal anastomoses had fewer restrictions in sports and sexual activities than those with Kock pouches (P less than 0.05), whereas those with Kock pouches in turn had fewer restrictions in these activities but more restrictions in travel than those with Brooke ileostomies (P less than 0.05). In contrast, performance in the categories of social life, recreation, work, and family was similar between groups. It is concluded that both the presence of a stoma and fecal incontinence impair the quality of life after proctocolectomy. Ileal pouch-anal anastomosis, which avoids both stoma and incontinence, offers the best quality of life between the three operations studied.\r"

Plain abdominal radiographs revealed megacolon in two, combined small and large bowel dilation in three, with one of them showing volvuluslike pattern, and isolated small bowel ileus in one. Emergency colonoscopy was performed successfully in all patients and revealed pseudomembranes in five and nonspecific colitis in one. All patients had positive latex test results for Clostridium difficile, and two tested positive for cytotoxicity. All patients were treated with IV metronidazole, resulting in resolution of symptoms and abdominal findings. In addition, two patients underwent colonoscopic decompression with improvement. Endoscopically, complete resolution of the pseudomembranes occurred at 4 weeks in all cases. No patient had a recurrence. It is concluded that (a) pseudomembranous colitis may present as abdominal distention mimicking small bowel ileus. Ogilvie's syndrome, volvulus, or ischemia; (b) in such cases, emergency colonoscopy is safe and useful for diagnosis and therapeutic decompression and may obviate the need for surgery; and (c) treatment with IV metronidazole is effective. Colitis due to C. difficile should be considered in the differential diagnosis of acute abdomen in patients previously treated with antibiotics.\r"

  ".W": "The authors investigated various enzymatic digestion procedures for isolating epithelial cells from the distal colon of New Zealand White male rabbits. Rabbit mucosa was washed, diced, and digested for 90 minutes in one of five different solutions, including a new combination consisting of 0.03% collagenase IV and 0.1% pronase (solution V). Solution I (0.3% dispase) yielded 14.2 +/- 8.2 x 10(6) colonocytes/g mucosa, solution II (0.15% dispase and 0.03% collagenase) yielded 7.7 +/- 2.8 x 10(6) colonocytes/g mucosa, and solution III (0.03% collagenase IV) yielded 15.4 +/- 10(6) cells/g mucosa. Solutions I-III have previously been described for the isolation of colonocytes. Solution IV (0.1% pronase and 325 U/mL DNAase) was originally described for the isolation of nasal epithelial cells but yielded only 2.5 +/- 1.2 x 10(6) cells/g mucosa when applied to the isolation of colonocytes. The new combination of pronase and collagenase, solution V, yielded significantly more colonocytes, 34.5 +/- 3.0 x 10(6) cells/g mucosa, than previously described methods (P less than 0.01). Inclusion of 5 mmol/L ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid in any of the solutions enhanced neither viability nor yield. The digestion product of solution V could be enriched for crypts by serial low-speed centrifugations. The epithelial origin of the colonocytes was confirmed by immunofluorescent staining for cytokeratins. Functional viability was tested by determining the presence of a Na+/H+ exchanger, using the pH fluorescent dye bis(carboxymethyl)-5(6)-carboxyfluorescein acetoxymethyl ester to measure intracellular pH. The authors document that sodium-dependent restoration of intracellular pH in colonocytes acid-loaded to a pH of 6.30 occurred at a rate of 0.19 +/- 0.02 pH U/min. Amiloride at concentrations of 1 mmol/L completely inhibited operation of the exchanger, as did sodium substitution with choline or tetramethylammonium. Lineweaver-Burke analysis at this intracellular pH showed a Michaelis constant of 10.71 mmol/L Na+ and a maximum velocity of 0.12 pH U/min. Exposing the colonocytes to 100 nmol/L phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate increased antiporter activity by 62.0%. Finally, the authors describe the synthesis of a new biomatrix composed of the basement membrane of 3T3 NIH fibroblasts that permits significantly improved colonocyte attachment than to glass, plastic, collagen types I or IV, or matrigel.\r"

  ".W": "To test the hypothesis that domperidone stimulates gastric muscle contraction by antagonizing the inhibitory effects of dopamine on postsynaptic cholinergic neurons in the myenteric plexus, the effects of dopamine on circular muscle from the body of the guinea pig stomach were examined. Dopamine inhibited circular muscle contraction evoked by electric field stimulation in a dose-related manner. The threshold dose was 10(-6) mol/L and half-maximal inhibition occurred at 10(-5) mol/L. Preincubation of muscle contraction with atropine or tetrodotoxin abolished the contractile response to electric field stimulation, indicating mediation via a cholinergic pathway. The adrenergic antagonists phentolamine and propranolol and the DA1 antagonist SCH 23390 were ineffective in antagonizing the action of dopamine. In contrast, the DA2 antagonist domperidone blocked the inhibitory effect of dopamine on electric field stimulation-mediated contractions. Schild analysis showed a Ki of 3 x 10(-8) mol/L and a slope of unity. In addition, it was shown that dopamine inhibited veratridine-evoked release of [3H]acetylcholine from the gastric myenteric plexus in a dose-related manner (median effective dose, 5.2 x 10(-5) mol/L). Tetrodotoxin abolished [3H]acetylcholine release evoked by veratridine, but hexamethonium had no effect. Domperidone, but not SCH 23390, antagonized the inhibitory action of dopamine. Pretreatment with pertussis toxin blocked the action of dopamine to inhibit evoked release of [3H]acetylcholine. These observations indicate that dopamine inhibits gastric muscle contraction evoked by electric field stimulation by inhibiting cholinergic transmission. This is mediated by DA2 receptors located on the postganglionic cholinergic neurons, and the pathway involves a pertussis toxin-sensitive G protein. The DA2-receptor antagonist domperidone antagonizes the inhibitory effect of dopamine, resulting in stimulation of gastric muscle contraction. This provides a mechanism for the gastrokinetic effect of domperidone.\r"

  ".W": "Hawaiian Japanese men (n = 432) who had undergone subtotal gastrectomy for peptic ulcers before 1971-1975 were followed up for detection of cancer development. They showed a significant increase in colon cancer risk (P = 0.008) and lung cancer risk (P = 0.002) compared with 6161 nongastrectomized men. The association with lung cancer persisted after adjustment for cigarette use (P = 0.03). Alcohol consumption was associated with colonic cancer in this cohort, and gastrectomized men consumed more alcohol than nongastrectomized men; however, the association of gastrectomy with colon cancer persisted after adjustment for alcohol use (P = 0.02). Gastrectomized men were lighter and had lower serum lipid levels than controls, suggesting that undernutrition might favor the development of some cancers. The type of gastroenteric anastomosis did not influence the cancer risk level in the colon or lung.\r"
