  ".W": "Cellular electrophysiological consequences of acute ischemia superimposed on healed myocardial infarction were studied in isolated, coronary-perfused cat left ventricles 2-4 months after ligation of multiple distal tributaries of the left anterior descending and circumflex coronary arteries. Oxygenated Tyrode's solution was perfused through the left anterior descending and circumflex coronary arteries, and the preparations were superfused with Tyrode's solution gassed with 95% N2-5% CO2. Transmembrane action potentials were recorded from the endocardial cells in normal and infarcted zones. There were no significant differences in measured action potential variables and refractory periods between cells in the normal and infarcted zones before acute ischemia. When coronary perfusion was discontinued (\"ischemia\"), resting potential, action potential amplitude, and action potential duration were reduced, and the refractory period was shortened progressively in cells of the normal zone. However, the action potential changes were less prominent, and the refractory period was unchanged in cells in the infarcted zone. As a result, there were significant differences in resting membrane potential, action potential amplitude, action potential duration, and refractory period between cells in the normal and infarcted zones at 10 minutes of ischemia. These differences became larger as the ischemic period was prolonged. Spontaneous rapid ventricular activity was observed during the last 20-30 minutes of ischemia in four of eight preparations with healed myocardial infarction, whereas no spontaneous rapid ventricular activity was recorded in any of six normal heart preparations. Our data suggest that superimposition of acute ischemia on healed myocardial infarction produces electrophysiological inhomogeneities that may enhance arrhythmogenesis.\r"

  ".W": "Catheter ablation of left-sided atrioventricular accessory pathways through the coronary sinus by direct-current shock may be complicated by rupture and thrombosis of the coronary sinus and injury to the coronary arteries. This study examined short and long-term effects of radiofrequency catheter ablation of the coronary sinus in 20 closed-chest dogs to determine whether this technique is feasible for potential interruption of left-sided accessory pathways. Single-pulsed radiofrequency energy (750 kHz, 85-293 J) was delivered to three sites in the distal and middle coronary sinus between the distal (1) or the proximal electrodes (2 or 3) of a standard 6 French quadripolar catheter and a chest-wall patch electrode. Single-pulsed radiofrequency energy (78-293 J) was also applied to two sites near the ostium of the coronary sinus with the proximal (4) or the distal (1) electrode of the same catheter. Coronary artery and levophase coronary sinus angiograms obtained before and immediately after ablation, as well as before killing, showed intact vascular structures in all dogs. Right atrial, pulmonary arterial, and aortic pressures measured in three dogs did not change significantly at the time of energy delivery. No significant changes were found in atrioventricular nodal refractoriness and conduction. None of the dogs had significant rhythm disturbances during and after ablation as evaluated by ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring and periodic rhythm strips at follow-up. Ten dogs were killed 1-7 days after ablation, three dogs were killed at 4 weeks, three dogs at 6 weeks, two dogs at 8 weeks, and two dogs at 12 weeks. Discrete lesions ranging in size from 3 x 3 to 8 x 10 mm2 in surface area and 0.5-4.5 mm in depth were found in the coronary sinus with most of the lesions extending to the left atrial and left ventricular myocardium. There was neither rupture of the coronary sinus nor occlusion of the coronary arteries. Mural thrombus was found in the coronary sinus on five acute lesions in two dogs, but none was noted on the chronic lesions, which was characterized by chronic granulation tissue and fibrosis. Two dogs in the study during chronic conditions had damage to branches of the underlying coronary artery that showed necrotizing arteritis and arterial sclerosis. Conduction system studies in four dogs showed some chronic inflammatory and fibrotic changes. Similar discrete lesions were found in situ in the coronary sinus of four postmortem human hearts with radiofrequency catheter ablation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Measurement of regional myocardial blood flow (RMBF) is crucial in experimental studies of myocardial ischemia and reperfusion in dogs. The standard measurement technique uses radioactive microspheres; however, not all institutions are able to dispose of radioactive waste and therefore cannot make use of this method. We tested a new, nonradioactive microsphere, labeled with colors instead of nuclides. Simultaneous blood flow measurements with two nuclide-labeled and two colored microspheres were performed after coronary occlusion in dogs. Both techniques show a within-method correlation of r greater than 0.98. Duplicate variability for paired RMBF values in 80 samples was 8.7 +/- 0.1% when computed with radioactive microspheres and 13.2 +/- 1.8% when computed with colored microspheres. There was a good correlation in the measurement of RMBF between the radioactive- and colored-microsphere methods (r = 0.98). The best-fitting linear regression line was expressed by the formula: Colored-microsphere RMBF = 1.11 (radioactive-microsphere RMBF)-0.02. When measured by colored microspheres, RMBF was approximately 8% higher than when computed with radioactive microspheres for blood flow values of 0-2 ml/min/g. When blood flow was increased pharmacologically to levels of 2-7.5 ml/min/g, colored microspheres yielded blood flow values 39% higher than the values computed by radioactive microspheres. We conclude that the nonradioactive, colored-microsphere method correlates with the radioactive technique, but at high flows, it yields values greater than those obtained with radioactive microspheres.\r"

To test the accuracy of Doppler volume-flow measurement proximal to a stenotic valve, we developed an open-chest canine model in which the native leaflets were sutured together to create variable degrees of acute aortic stenosis. Left ventricular and aortic pressures were measured with micromanometer-tipped catheters. Volume flow was controlled and varied by directing systemic venous return through a calibrated roller pump and back to the right atrium. Because transaortic volume flow will not equal roller pump output when there is coexisting aortic insufficiency (present in 67% of studies), transaortic flow was measured by electromagnetic flowmeter with the flow probe placed around the proximal descending thoracic aorta, just beyond the ligated arch vessels. In 12 adult, mongrel dogs (mean weight, 25 kg), the mean transaortic pressure gradient ranged from 2 to 74 mm Hg, and transaortic volume flow ranged from 0.9 to 3.2 l/min. In four dogs, electromagnetic flow that was measured distal to the valve was accurate compared with volume flow determined by timed collection of total aortic flow into a graduated cylinder (n = 24, r = 0.97, electromagnetic flow = 0.87 Direct +0.13 l/min). In eight subsequent dogs, electromagnetic flow was compared with transaortic cardiac output measured by Doppler echocardiography in the left ventricular outflow tract as circular cross-sectional area [pi(D/2)2] x left ventricular outflow tract velocity-time integral x heart rate.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "To investigate whether iron is involved in the reperfusion syndrome by aggravating free radical injury, the hearts from iron-loaded and control rats were perfused under normoxic, anoxic, and reperfusion conditions. Normoxic perfusion revealed no change in coronary flow, contractility, or lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release between these two groups. Under anoxic and reperfusion conditions, however, we found a significant increase of ventricle fibrillation (56% vs. 0%, p less than 0.01, n = 9), a significantly lower recovery of contractility (21 +/- 7.4% vs. 81 +/- 6.6%, mean +/- SEM; p less than 0.001), and a significant increase of LDH release (667 +/- 142 vs. 268 +/- 37 mU LDH/min/g wet wt, mean +/- SEM; p less than 0.05). Administration of either 20 microM of the antioxidant (+)-cyanidanol-3 or 50 microM of the iron-chelator deferoxamine totally prevented the generation of ventricle fibrillation and normalized contractility to control levels in the iron-loaded group. Moreover, 20 microM (+)-cyanidanol-3 significantly lowered LDH release in this period (312 +/- 67 mU), whereas deferoxamine had no protective effect on this LDH release (1,494 +/- 288 mU). Normal hearts appeared to be protected by 20 microM (+)-cyanidanol-3 as well. In this group (n = 6), a significantly higher recovery of contractility (97.1 +/- 3.2% vs. 81 +/- 6.6%, p less than 0.05) and a significantly lower release of LDH (110 +/- 27 vs. 268 +/- 37 mU, p less than 0.05) was found compared with the control group (n = 9).

In this study, the effects of the thromboxane synthetase inhibitor dazmegrel and the thromboxane receptor antagonist BM 13.505 on myocardial postischemic functional recovery and preservation of tissue adenine nucleotides was examined after a 15-minute episode of ischemia followed by 3 hours of reperfusion (myocardial stunning). Dazmegrel (3 or 8 mg/kg) or BM 13.505 (10 mg/kg) was given 15 minutes before coronary occlusion and compared with a control group in barbital-anesthetized dogs. Regional segment shortening (percent segment shortening, sonomicrometry), regional myocardial blood flow (microspheres), and coronary venous eicosanoid and high-energy phosphate levels (biopsies after 3 hours of reperfusion) were measured. Areas at risk, regional myocardial blood flow, and regional segment shortening during coronary occlusion were similar in all groups. Dazmegrel (3 mg/kg) attenuated the decrease in endocardial and midmyocardial adenosine 5'-triphosphate, and both doses significantly improved regional segment shortening during reperfusion. Coronary venous thromboxane levels were significantly decreased throughout the experiment in both dazmegrel-treated groups, and thromboxane levels were significantly elevated in the control group 3 hours after reperfusion. Prostacyclin, measured in the form of its main metabolite, 6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha, did not change significantly in the control group throughout the experiment, but it was markedly increased in dazmegrel groups throughout reperfusion, particularly in the dazmegrel group receiving 3 mg/kg. BM 13.505 exerted no beneficial effects on postischemic function or metabolism. In conclusion, after a reversible ischemic insult, postischemic recovery of function and metabolic status was not enhanced by preocclusion treatment with a thromboxane receptor blocker, and thus, the beneficial effects of thromboxane synthesis inhibition on postischemic abnormalities was not due to a reduction in thromboxane but was the result of endoperoxide shunting and a subsequent increase in prostacyclin. Therefore, thromboxane does not appear to be an important mediator of reversible ischemia-reperfusion damage.\r"

During both endogenous and maximal vasodilation with intracoronary adenosine, pressure-flow (P/Q) plots were constructed before and after 20-minute (n = 9) or 40-minute (n = 17) circumflex artery occlusions. Decreases in circumflex vascular bed conductance were represented by downward shifts in P/Q plot regression lines. No significant change occurred in P/Q line slope or pressure at zero flow 30 minutes after release of the 20-minute occlusion, and no infarction was found. After release of the 40-minute occlusion, a small but insignificant decrease in P/Q line slope occurred during endogenous vasodilation. However, during maximal vasodilation, a significant (p less than 0.01) decrease in P/Q line slope was present during reperfusion compared with preocclusion corresponding to a decrease in vasodilatory reserve (P/Q line slope = 1.52 +/- 0.14 ml/min/mm Hg preocclusion vs. 1.03 +/- 0.13 at 15 minutes reperfusion). Pretreatment with aspirin did not prevent this decrease in vascular conductance during maximal vasodilation. Total circumflex, as well as subendocardial, midmyocardial, and subepicardial blood flows, was measured with radioactive microspheres. There was a good correlation between the extent of infarction measured by triphenyltetrazolium chloride staining and the decrease in vascular conductance during maximal vasodilation for all three myocardial layers as well as for the total circumflex vascular bed. Hence, the degree of no-reflow correlates closely with the extent of infarction during maximal vasodilation (but not during endogenous vasodilation) and is not altered by aspirin therapy.\r"

However, we have shown previously that anti-free radical therapies including superoxide dismutase (SOD) and inhibitors of xanthine oxidase did not limit infarct size after 40 minutes of ischemia and 4 days of reperfusion in dogs. To test whether 40 minutes of ischemia is too brief a period to produce the prerequisite conditions for free radical-mediated necrosis upon reperfusion, we studied infarcts produced by 90 minutes of ischemia followed by reperfusion. Dogs in an SOD-catalase group received a 60-minute infusion of SOD (15,000 units/kg) and catalase (55,000 units/kg) beginning 25 minutes before and ending 35 minutes after reperfusion. A second group of dogs received a single injection of the xanthine oxidase inhibitor oxypurinol (20 mg/kg) 25 minutes before reperfusion. Infarct size was assessed histologically relative to the size of the area at risk and to collateral blood flow to the ischemic region. Infarct size as a percentage of the area at risk was similar in the control group (40.7 +/- 5.5%, n = 11), the SOD-catalase group (38.0 +/- 6.4%; n = 8), and the oxypurinol-treated group (41.4 +/- 6.1%; n = 7) [p = not significant (NS) by analysis of variance]. In controls, there was an inverse relation between infarct size and collateral blood flow; neither of the treatments altered this relation (p = NS by analysis of covariance).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Since the presence of microalbuminuria - increased urinary albumin excretion (UAE) undetectable by routine assays - can be an early sign of this phenomenon, UAE in the normo- and microalbuminuric range was measured in 24 single kidney patients with negative Albustix. Nephrectomy had been performed in 22 cases 1 to 28 years before, mostly because of renal lithiasis. Patients were selected as being normotensive, normoglycemic and free of recurrent urinary infections or stones. On regular diet (mean protein intake 1.2 g/kg/day), UAE mean values were significantly higher in single kidney patients than in 20 controls both in supine position during overnight rest (clinostatism) (37.71 +/- 56.32 vs 2.56 +/- 2.27 micrograms/min, p less than 0.001) and in erect position during moderate physical effort (orthostatism) (67.31 +/- 86.12 vs 4.59 +/- 5.73 micrograms/min, p less than 0.004). Microalbuminuria was observed in 18/24 single kidney patients in clinostatism and 15/24 in orthostatism. A subgroup of 14 patients was also studied on different protein dietetic regimens. After one month on a 0.6 g/kg/day protein containing diet, UAE mean levels significantly decreased in comparison to those found on regular diet (clinostatism: 26.15 +/- 35.93 vs 49.24 +/- 70.29 micrograms/min, p less than 0.02; orthostatism: 31.73 +/- 46.97 vs 68.92 +/- 83.53 micrograms/min, p less than 0.001). One month after a 1.6 g/kg/day protein diet UAE mean values significantly increased (clinostatism 83.99 +/- 88.04 micrograms/min, p less than 0.001; orthostatism: 117.19 +/- 116.12 micrograms/min, p less than 0.001).

  ".W": "It has been postulated that IgA NP is caused by mesangial deposition of IgA-containing immune complexes formed by IgA polymers (pIgA) which are overproduced in response to antigens presented at mucosal surfaces. The intestinal mucosa is one possible source of this pIgA. To test whether antibodies to dietary antigens might be involved in the pathogenesis of IgA NP, we measured IgG and IgA serum antibody activities to gluten, a gluten fraction called glyc-gli, alpha-lactalbumin, beta-lactoglobulin, casein and ovalbumin in 54 patients with IgA NP by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The IgA activities to gluten antigens and alpha-lactalbumin were significantly increased in IgA NP compared with a group of 40 age-matched healthy controls. In a previous study we found that 4 out of 12 patients with IgA NP and gastrointestinal complaints had subtotal villous atrophy; this indicated that many patients with IgA NP have altered intestinal permeability which may lead to activation of their intestinal immune system. Taken together our results showed a relation between the intestinal humoral immune system and IgA NP and indicated that antibodies to dietary antigens in some patients may be directly involved in the pathogenesis of IgA NP.\r"

The rate of decline of creatinine clearance decreased from 1.38 +/- 0.27 ml/min/month during a previous 15.9-month period of unrestricted protein diet, to 0.03 +/- 0.37 ml/min/month during the 17.4 months on supplemented diet. Urinary protein loss significantly decreased, and total serum protein increased. The daily insulin requirement decreased and no deterioration of the nutritional status occurred. Secondary hyperparathyroidism was partially reversed and the mild hypothyroidism corrected. A restricted protein and phosphorus diet supplemented with essential amino acids and ketoanalogs seems to exert several beneficial and no unwanted side effects in type 1 diabetics with renal failure.\r"

The two groups did not show any significant difference for age, sex, education or duration of the dialysis treatment. All G1 patients were treated by hemodialysis. In G2, 24 patients underwent hemodialysis and 3 were on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD). We evaluated body loads of Al in 25 of 27 G2 patients with the desferrioxamine (DFO) infusion test. All 51 patients underwent a neurological examination and a waking EEG. Intelligence was assessed by Raven's Progressive Matrices 47 test in 19 of the G1 patients and in 20 of the G2 patients; short-term memory was measured by digit span and by word span and long-term memory by a short story in 10 G1 patients and 17 G2 patients. We diagnosed DE only in the presence of the typical EEG changes, with or without manifest clinical symptoms. DE was diagnosed in none of the G1 patients and in 8 of the G2 patients (0 vs 29.6%, chi 2 = 6.34; p less than 0.025). Five of the patients with DE showed both clinical and EEG signs, while the remaining three showed only EEG signs.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

We therefore investigated the 144 patients at our hemodialysis center and compared the AAN patients (33%) with those having other kidney diseases (controls). Patients with AAN were older (60 +/- 10 vs 52 +/- 15 years, p less than 0.001) and predominantly women. Acetaminophen and metamizol metabolites were detected more frequently in blood from the AAN patients than in that from the controls (25% vs 3%, p = 0.002). More AAN patients were smokers, and they more frequently complained of vague symptoms (pain, sensitivity to changes in weather, insomnia) and also more frequently requested prescriptions for analgesics, hypnotics, laxatives, stomachics and antipruritics. Because they were older, AAN patients had fewer occupational and financial problems. The compliance of the AAN patients was significantly better with respect to important dialysis parameters such as weight gain between dialysis treatments (3.6 +/- 1.3 vs 4.0 +/- 1.3% body weight, p less than 0.05) and diastolic blood pressure (81 +/- 12 vs 86 +/- 12 mmHg, p = 0.025). Despite an older age and higher morbidity, the cumulative 17-year survival rate of the AAN patients did not differ from that of the controls. We conclude that AAN patients have characteristic personality traits. Their better compliance, adjustment to the hemodialysis situation and social conditions are responsible for their good survival on hemodialysis.\r"

In order to gain further evidence that proteinases are liberated from PMN leukocytes during dialysis both plasma levels of PMN elastase and the content of elastase and cathepsin G in neutrophils were determined during 3 hours of hemodialysis with cellulosic membranes (Cuprophan) in 10 patients. In blood smears, obtained at different times during dialysis, neutrophils were classified into 3 groups according to their proteinase content. Thus, group I neutrophils contained low, group II moderate, and group III leukocytes contained high amounts of both proteinases. With regard to their elastase content, prior to the onset of dialysis, 6% of the circulating PMN leukocytes were classified as fraction I, 58% as fraction II, and 36% as fraction III neutrophils. After 15 minutes of dialysis, at the nadir of leukopenia, all fractions of PMN leukocytes were significantly reduced (fraction I: -9%, fraction II: -60%, and fraction III: -83%) as compared to initial values. 30 minutes into hemodialysis, there was a significant increase in fraction I (+ 78%), whereas fraction II (-28%) and fraction III (-70%) remained diminished. At 180 times of hemodialysis the increment of fraction I neutrophils was even more pronounced (+ 187%), fraction II was also increased (+ 16%), and fraction III neutrophils had almost reached initial values. The cathepsin G content of PMN leukocytes displayed a rather similar pattern during dialysis. As to plasma levels of PMN elastase, there was a steady and significant increase from baseline values of 107.3 +/- 11.5 ng/ml up to 388.1 +/- 51.6 ng/ml after 3 hours of hemodialysis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

A four-month follow-up was carried out in 221 patients undergoing hemodialysis (HD) and in 40 staff members caring for the patients in 2 centers. 62 patients undergoing peritoneal dialysis (PD) and 126 hemodialysis patients who transited through a center (HDT) were screened once. A questionnaire exploring risk factors was completed for each patient and staff member. Sera were tested for HIV I antibodies by ELISA (ELAVIA) and confirmed by Western Blot. Of the 347 HD + HDT patients, 4 were found to be positive. Of the 221 HD patients, 1 multi-transfused hemophiliac and 1 multitransfused Nigerian without other risk factors were positive in the first screening. Another patient seroconverted after transfusion during the study; no other risk factors existed and the donor has not yet been found. One of the 126 HDT patients had received infected plasma. No staff members or PD patients were positive. No transmission within centers, from patient-to-patient or patient-to-staff was evidenced. Although HIV I seems to be less infectious than HBV, precautions to prevent transmission of HIV I in dialysis centers should be maintained.\r"

  ".W": "Foscarnet (FC) is a new antiviral agent which has been recently proposed for the treatment of severe cytomegalovirus (CMV) infections in immunocompromised patients. When used intravenously (i.v.), main adverse effects of FC are a fall in hemoglobin, and an increase in liver enzymes and serum calcium. Although increased serum creatinine have been noted in several patients, deterioration of renal function is often accounted for by the concomitant use of other nephrotoxic drugs, the severity of underlying disease or the presence of graft rejection. Consequently FC is often considered as a non or poorly nephrotoxic drug. We report 4 cases of acute renal failure (ARF) which can be exclusively attributed to FC. FC was used for CMV chorioretinitis in 3 AIDS patients and in one non-immunocompromised patient. ARF was diagnosed between the 6th and 15th day of treatment, with oligoanuria in two patients (one of whom required two hemodialysis periods). ARF was most likely secondary to acute toxic tubulopathy. Three patients did not receive any other nephrotoxic drug. The fourth patient received concomitantly sulfadiazine but renal function returned to baseline value after FC completion although sulfadiazine was continued. In conclusion, our 4 observations suggest that FC may be responsible for acute tubulopathy. We suggest that in these patients renal function should be carefully monitored and dehydration promptly corrected to limit the risk of nephrotoxicity.\r"

Total demethylation and N3- and N7-demethylation increase exponentially with postnatal age; the plateau is reached by 120 days and accounts for 58.6%, 90.5%, and 79.3%, respectively. N1-demethylation shows no variation with postnatal age. It is suggested that N3-demethylation is more important in young infants than in adults and that maturation of N1-demethylation occurs later than 19 months of age. 8-Hydroxylation is mature as early as 1 month of age and may be higher in infants than in adults. Acetylation is not mature before at least 1 year of age. Differences in maturation rate of acetylation may be related in part to genetic acetylator status.\r"

Thirty homozygous slow (rr) and 15 heterozygous rapid (Rr) acetylators were identified. The degree of interindividual variability in acetylator activity was observed to be a mean of 32% (range 27% to 36%) and 20% (range 11% to 29%) in the rr and Rr groups, respectively. The mean intraindividual variation on repetitive measurement was 19% (range 6% to 49%) in the rr and 14% (range 7% to 24%) in the Rr acetylator group. Four subjects had apparent changes in acetylator activity with time such that they were unable to be assigned to any one acetylator group. Two of these four subjects exhibited apparent homozygous rapid acetylator activity intermittently during the 5-week trial. This variability may explain, in part, some of the high degree of patient variability observed in the toxicity, efficacy, and drug-related disease associated with acetylated drugs and environmental toxins.\r"

The normal decrease of diastolic blood pressure during bicycle exercise, reflecting a decrease in total peripheral resistance not mediated by circulating epinephrine, disappeared during atenolol treatment. Low-dose infusion of epinephrine had no influence on systolic blood pressure both before and after atenolol. However, the decrease of diastolic blood pressure occurring before atenolol was abolished and the increase in heart rate was attenuated during atenolol treatment. Forearm vascular resistance decreased before and during atenolol to the same extent. So the normal physiologic vasodilation during submaximal dynamic exercise seems impaired during long-term treatment with atenolol. In addition the normal vasodilating response to an increase of circulating epinephrine to levels occurring during daily life stress seems impaired even with the low dose of this beta 1-selective beta-blocker.\r"

  ".W": "In healthy volunteers receiving a single intramuscular dose of 18 X 10(6) U interferon alone or after 24 hours of an 8-day course of prednisone (40 mg/day), aspirin (650 mg every 4 hours), or acetaminophen (650 mg every 4 hours), the magnitude of the biologic response to interferon was quantified by measuring the time course of the induction of 2'-5'-oligoadenylate synthetase and resistance to vesicular stomatitis virus infection in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Prednisone decreased the AUC of 2'-5'-oligoadenylate synthetase activity (p less than 0.05), whereas administration of aspirin or acetaminophen did not affect this biologic response. No measurable effect was seen during administration of prednisone, aspirin, or acetaminophen on the duration or intensity of vesicular stomatitis virus yield reduction. The side effects seen with interferon administration at the dose tested were not altered in a clinically meaningful manner by prednisone, aspirin, or acetaminophen.\r"

  ".W": "1. To test the hypothesis that NaCl increases blood pressure, while NaHCO3 does not, we measured the effect of an NaHCO3-containing mineral water on blood pressure in stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive (SHR-SP) and Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats. We compared mineral water with equimolar amounts of NaCl and demineralized drinking water in six groups of 20 rats each over 24 weeks. 2. NaCl consistently increased blood pressure in both SHR-SP and WKY compared with demineralized water, while mineral water did not. 3. We studied the possible role of sodium-regulating hormones. Sodium, potassium-dependent adenosine triphosphatase activity was decreased by NaCl and by age, but not by mineral water. The concentration of atrial natriuretic peptide was greater in SHR-SP, but was not influenced by the two regimens. Components of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and 18-hydroxydeoxycorticosterone tended to decrease with NaCl, but not with mineral water. 4. Plasma pH values in the six groups of rats were not different; however, SHR-SP had consistently lower PCO2 and HCO3- values and higher anion gap values than WKY rats. These values were not influence by the two regimens. 5. NaCl elevates blood pressure in SHR-SP while NaHCO3 does not. The changes in hormones regulating sodium homoeostasis suggest that NaCl induces volume expansion while NaHCO3 does not. The effect may be related to influences on renal sodium reabsorption by chloride and bicarbonate. The possible role of increased proton excretory activity in SHR-SP remains to be determined.\r"

The effects of three intravenous diphosphonates (etidronate, clodronate and aminohexane diphosphonate) on phosphate homoeostasis were studied in 30 patients with Paget's disease of bone and in three patients with hypoparathyroidism. 2. In Paget's disease, all three diphosphonates induced significant increases in serum phosphate and renal tubular reabsorption of phosphate. This effect was most marked and persistent after etidronate, whereas in the clodronate- and aminohexane diphosphonate-treated patients the increases were less, of shorter duration and followed thereafter by significant decreases in serum phosphate and renal tubular reabsorption of phosphate. Unlike etidronate, both clodronate and aminohexane diphosphonate caused a significant reduction in serum and urinary calcium, with appropriate homoeostatic increases in immunoassayable parathyroid hormone. 3. Phosphaturic responses to infused parathyroid hormone were observed in two patients with etidronate-induced hyperphosphataemia. 4. In three hypoparathyroid patients, clodronate induced a more marked increase in serum phosphate and renal tubular reabsorption of phosphate than in Paget's disease, which was of comparable degree but of shorter duration than that after etidronate in Paget's disease. 5. These findings suggest that all three diphosphonates increase renal tubular reabsorption of phosphate, but that this effect is attenuated with those diphosphonates which induce secondary hyperparathyroidism.\r"

The relationship of reciprocal change on the electrocardiogram, at the time of acute myocardial infarction, to exercise-induced ST segment depression and coronary anatomy was studied in 125 post-infarct patients. 2. Eighty-three patients had reciprocal changes, 90 had exercise-induced ST depression and 72 had both of these findings. 3. Patients with reciprocal changes had larger myocardial infarctions, as assessed by peak enzyme release and ejection fraction, than patients without this finding. 4. Multi-vessel disease was significantly more common among patients with reciprocal changes and those with exercise-induced ST depression compared with patients without these findings. 5. The exercise test was more sensitive and had a higher predictive accuracy than reciprocal change when electrocardiographic changes were compared with findings at coronary angiography. 6. With both tests the antero-lateral leads were significantly more sensitive, but less specific, than the inferior leads in classifying patients. 7. Thus while both tests yielded information with regard to coronary anatomy in post-infarct patients, the exercise test was a better predictor of coronary anatomy than reciprocal change. 8. Therefore, reliance should not be placed on the presence or absence of reciprocal change alone when assessing patients for further investigation after myocardial infarction.\r"

  ".W": "1. The transport of 6-thioguanine and 6-mercaptopurine has been studied with isolated jejunal loops of mouse small intestine. H.p.l.c. was used to identify and quantify the thiopurines and their metabolites in the serosal secretions. 2. When the lumen of the intestinal loops contained either 6-thioguanine or 6-mercaptopurine at a concentration of 1 mmol/l, the concentration of unmetabolized drug in the serosal secretions reached a maximum of 0.13 +/- 0.02 mmol/l (mean +/- SEM). 3. Analysis of the serosal secretions from the perfusions with either of the drugs revealed the appearance of an unknown compound which had the characteristics of a thiopurine and the same time course of appearance as the unmetabolized drug. Thus 6-thioguanine and 6-mercaptopurine are significantly metabolized during absorption in mouse intestine. 4. The unknown compound was identified as 6-thiouric acid, and with 1 mmol/l 6-thioguanine or 6-mercaptopurine in the lumen the concentration of this metabolite in the serosal secretions rose to a maximum of 0.13 +/- 0.01 and 0.18 +/- 0.03 mmol/l, respectively. At luminal drug concentrations of 0.1 mmol/l, the metabolite accounted for approximately 90% of the serosal thiopurine. 5. After an initial lag period of 20 min, linear rates of appearance in the serosal secretions were obtained for both the unmetabolized drugs and 6-thiouric acid. 6. Addition of the xanthine oxidase inhibitor oxypurinol at a luminal concentration of 0.3 mmol/l prevented the formation of 6-thiouric acid from 6-thioguanine. However, the inhibitor reduced the rate of 6-thioguanine appearance in the serosal secretions by 50%. 7. The conversion of 6-mercaptopurine to 6-thiouric acid was prevented when allopurinol or oxypurinol were added to the lumen. At a luminal drug concentration of 1 mmol/l, allopurinol increased the rate at which 6-mercaptopurine appeared in the serosal secretions by 90% compared with an increase of only 50% with oxypurinol. 8. The transport of water and glucose by the mouse intestinal loops was unaffected by 6-thioguanine or the xanthine oxidase inhibitors. However, 6-mercaptopurine caused significant reductions in the rate of water transport (30%) and glucose transport (39%). These effects were observed at a luminal drug concentration of 0.1 mmol/l and there was no further increase at a drug concentration of 1 mmol/l.\r"

This study analyzes the systematic influence of a possible diurnal variation of gas exchange and quantifies the extrapolation accuracy of 16 commonly used recording protocols (one to four times a day for 5, 15, 30, and 60 min). Continuous gas exchange measurements were performed for 24 h in 50 ventilated patients and compared to extrapolated results. Only a small diurnal variation was found, and extrapolation accuracy depended on the duration and, especially, the number of recording periods. In clinical practice, 24-h values can be estimated with sufficient accuracy by extrapolation from two 15-min measurements per day.\r"

Muscle magnesium (Mg) and potassium (K) content was assessed by atomic absorption spectrophotometry; serum electrolytes were also measured. The presence of clinical and biochemical correlates of low serum and muscle Mg was investigated. Three (9.4%) out of 32 patients had hypomagnesemia (Mgs less than or equal to 0.7 mmol/L) with normal muscle Mg values, whereas low muscle Mg values were found in 15 (47%) of 32 patients, with no alterations of serum Mg levels. Muscle Mg was decreased significantly in pulmonary ICU patients as compared to control subjects. No significant correlation was present between serum and muscle Mg, or between serum and muscle K. Significant relationships between muscle Mg and both muscle and intracellular K concentrations were also found. Lower values for muscle and intracellular K and a higher incidence of both more prolonged ICU stays and ventricular extrasystolic beats characterized the ICU patients with altered muscle Mg levels. We conclude that, given the serious complications of Mg metabolism derangements, the presence of altered cell Mg content should be taken into account in pulmonary ICU patients. Moreover, in these patients, serum Mg levels are of little value in the diagnosis of intracellular Mg deficits.\r"

The patients had been treated initially with sodium nitroprusside to maintain their arterial BP in a prescribed range, but, because of excessive nitroprusside dose requirements, they were considered either to have refractory BP or to be at risk for thiocyanate toxicity. Intravenous labetalol therapy was started either by frequent bolus pulse therapy every 1 to 2 h or by continuous infusion therapy. The degree of desired arterial BP control and the effects on ICP and cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) were assessed and compared with the results during nitroprusside therapy. The degree of arterial BP control with labetalol was assessed to be good; 11 patients were weaned off nitroprusside and the remaining four patients had a substantial reduction in their nitroprusside requirements, needing an average of only 1.5 micrograms/kg.min of nitroprusside to control their BP compared with average requirements of 10 micrograms/kg.min of nitroprusside before labetalol therapy. Labetalol therapy improved CPP in six patients and ICP in five patients, with no significant change in cerebral pressure in the remainder. Overall, the CPP in the 15 patients improved from 63 +/- 15 (SD) mm Hg with nitroprusside to 65 +/- 10 mm Hg with labetalol therapy and the ICP decreased from 11.3 +/- 6.1 mm Hg with nitroprusside to 8.6 +/- 3.1 mm Hg with labetalol therapy (p less than .05 by Wilcoxon matched pairs).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Thirteen dogs were anesthetized, paralyzed, mechanically ventilated, and hemodynamically monitored. Hypotension was induced and maintained at a mean arterial pressure of 40 to 45 mm Hg using controlled hemorrhage and reinfusion. After 2.5 h of shock, the dogs were randomized into two groups: one group (n = 6) received NaCl infusion; the other (n = 7) received sodium bicarbonate (1 mEq/kg followed by a continuous infusion of 2.5 mEq/kg.h for 2.5 h). CO2 production was increased in the alkali group, but there was no statistically significant difference between groups in any measured hemodynamic, blood gas, or respiratory gas variable. These included heart rate, BP, cardiac output, arterial and venous pH, CO2 production, and bicarbonate levels. Blood lactate levels, however, in the bicarbonate treated animals were significantly (p less than .01) higher than in the group treated with NaCl alone (10.1 +/- 3.2 vs. 5.1 +/- 1.2 mEq/L). These results are similar to the effects of bicarbonate found in other models of lactic acidosis, and suggest that bicarbonate therapy may have limited usefulness in the treatment of lactic acidosis.\r"

Later, there was a rapid and progressive decline in PaO2 values in both samples stored at 2 degrees and 22 degrees C.

Group 2 consisted of six patients requiring more prolonged ventilator support. Group 1 patients met three of four bedside criteria; seven patients met all four. Five of six patients in group 2 also satisfied three of four standard criteria while ventilator-dependent, whereas only two patients satisfied all four when successfully weaning. As group 2 patients progressed from unsuccessful to successful weaning there was no consistent improvement in bedside criteria; however, measures of work did significantly improve. Hence, satisfaction of bedside mechanical weaning criteria is associated with weaning success in patients requiring brief mechanical ventilation. In patients requiring prolonged ventilation, work may be a better indicator of successful weaning.\r"

The balloon diameter is usually 20 mm or smaller to avoid disruption of aortic root structure and to permit forward blood flow during inflation. To evaluate the safety and efficacy of valvuloplasty using a combination of balloons with larger maximum inflated diameters, we compared results of aortic valvuloplasty in 21 patients using either the single or double balloon technique. Mean maximum inflated balloon diameter was 19.4 mm +/- 1.4 for the single balloon technique, while the mean sum of diameters for the simultaneous double balloon technique was 36.3 mm +/- 3.9. The mean age, aortic annulus diameter, and predilatation aortic valve area were not different among groups. Mean aortic transvalvular gradient reduction and mean aortic valve area increase were greater for the double balloon technique. The procedure was well tolerated with no major complications. No change in the degree of aortic regurgitation was noted. The double balloon technique for aortic valvuloplasty is safe and more effective at improving aortic valve area and transvalvular gradient than the conventional single balloon technique.\r"

To determine whether an oral placebo presented as an inotropic agent could acutely enhance exercise capacity, two separate groups of stable heart failure patients were studied by serial exercise testing and respiratory gas exchange analysis. Group 1 had nine patients studied four hours after a single oral dose of placebo, and group 2 had ten patients retested after one to two weeks of placebo therapy. No significant change was seen in the mean exercise time, mean peak oxygen consumption, and the mean oxygen consumption at anaerobic threshold after placebo administration in both group 1 and group 2 patients. Improvements in exercise time, peak oxygen consumption, and oxygen consumption at anaerobic threshold occurred in five patients in group 1 and seven patients in group 2. The improvements exceeded the baseline variability of 10 percent in three group 1 patients. Among group 2 patients, the increase in exercise time, peak oxygen consumption, and oxygen consumption at anaerobic threshold exceeded 10 percent in six, four, and four patients, respectively. Thus, stable chronic heart failure patients can achieve a true baseline exercise capacity. Small improvements in exercise performance seen acutely after oral inotropic drug therapy in individual heart failure patients must be interpreted with caution, as they may be due to a placebo effect.\r"

The BAL was performed using three, 40 ml aliquots of normal saline solution, in a lingular subsegment. The same diameter bronchoscope (4.8 mm) was used and BAL was performed and analyzed identically in all subjects. While the percentage of lavageate returned was relatively consistent from subject to subject (63.4 +/- 10.8 percent, mean +/- SD), there was marked variability in the number of cells obtained (7.3 +/- 3.9 X 10(6)). While low returns were generally associated with a diminished cell recovery, in the range of normal percentage returned, there was no correlation with the number recovered. There was no correlation of cell number or percent lavageate returned with gender, height, or any lung volume (as determined on pulmonary function tests). There was relatively little variability in differential analysis of recovered cells. The BAL was well tolerated by all subjects; the chest roentgenogram was found to be of little utility in screening normal subjects, but pulmonary function testing detected obstructive lung disease in three potential subjects leading to their disqualification as \"normal.\" Our experience confirms the safety of bronchoalveolar lavage in normal volunteer subjects. We report the BAL results that can be expected for research or clinical comparison using a protocol described in detail. The variability of cell numbers from BAL, even under these controlled conditions, precludes the routine use of this measurement from BAL performed for clinical purposes.\r"

The BAL was performed with 120 ml (three aliquots of 40 ml) of room temperature, normal saline in a lingular subsegment. Four subjects had five BAL, three had four BAL, and nine had three BAL performed at minimal intervals of six weeks. The BAL analysis included percentage of lavageate returned, cell number, and percentage of alveolar macrophages, lymphocytes, neutrophils and eosinophils. Relatively similar percentages of lavageate were returned on each lavage. There was considerable variability in the cell numbers obtained both within and between subjects, although some subjects had consistently high, low, or normal cell numbers returned from each lavage. Cell differential was the most consistent parameter on repeated BAL analyses, but isolated \"abnormal\" elevations in the percentage of one or another cell type were occasionally noted. These were unrelated to either the number or relative sequence of the BALs. Pulmonary function tests performed both before and after the repeated BAL showed no significant change and participants noted no subjective deterioration in pulmonary function. This study supports the safety of repeated BALs in the normal subject, but the variability in cell numbers obtained and isolated, \"abnormal\" elevations of inflammatory cells occasionally noted in this normal population indicate that BAL parameters in patients need to be interpreted with extreme caution.\r"

Emphysema was graded using a score based on the percentage of lung involved on CT scan. There was good inter- and intra-observer agreement for the emphysema scores. The median emphysema score was 0 percent in the nonsmoking group and 10 percent in the smoking group. All smokers with a total lung capacity (TLC) of greater than 120 percent predicted had evidence of emphysema on the CT scan. None of the asthmatic subjects with a TLC greater than 120 percent predicted had emphysema identifiable on CT scan. We conclude that chronic asthma with severe hyperinflation does not result in emphysema.\r"

We examined the relationship between smoking and the anatomic location of coronary artery stenosis in 8,705 patients undergoing cardiac catheterization for suspected coronary artery disease (CAD). The smoking history of patients with CAD (greater than or equal to 70 percent stenosis) was compared with that of control subjects (0 percent stenosis) for each of nine anatomic locations (proximal, middle, and distal segments of right [RCA], anterior descending [LAD], and circumflex arteries [LCX]), using a case-control method. The odds ratio (OR) estimate of relative risk of CAD for smokers relative to nonsmokers was 2.8, with a 95 percent confidence interval (CI) of 2.5 to 3.1. Relative risk was greater for RCA stenosis (OR = 5.8; CI = 4.6-7.2) than for LCX (OR = 3.5; CI = 2.7-4.5) or LAD (OR = 2.1; CI = 1.8-2.4) lesions when comparing smokers with nonsmokers. After control for age, gender, history of diabetes mellitus, and serum cholesterol level, the adjusted relative risk for an RCA lesion (Mantel-Haenszel odds ratio [MOR] = 4.9) was significantly elevated (p less than 0.05) compared with the LAD (MOR = 1.9) but not with the LCX (MOR = 3.1). The relative risks of CAD were the same (p greater than 0.05) for the proximal, middle, and distal coronary segments. Thus, smoking increased the risk of all coronary lesions but did so more for the RCA than for other vessels, suggesting a spatial pattern to the increased risk produced by smoking.\r"

All patients underwent studies with xenon inhalation, Technegas inhalation, and macroaggregated albumin perfusion. Technegas is a new ultrafine ventilatory agent with a particle size of 50 to 200A produced from technetium pertechnetate and graphite in an argon environment. Although particulate in nature, Technegas is transported and diffuses like a gaseous agent. Its production results in a high specific activity yield with high efficiency. There is no significant deposition in the central airways, and good peripheral visualization of the lung is obtained. The study was designed to assess whether Technegas could be used as a ventilatory agent to obtain high-quality diagnostic images. All studies were reported as in normal clinical practice, and no statistical analysis was performed. The aim of the study was simply to see what role Technegas had in a busy clinical department and how well it reflected ventilation by comparison with xenon. Patient compliance with Technegas was 100 percent and for xenon was 94 percent. Technegas enables one to obtain high-quality ventilatory images and has an important role to play in the assessment of pulmonary ventilation.\r"

Five of 26 subjects exhibited episodes with a minimum mean arterial pressure of 60 mm Hg or less. These hypotensive episodes were associated with hemoglobin desaturation below 80 percent, secondary to sleep-related breathing disorders, and elevated supine nasopharyngeal airway resistance. Hypotensive subjects were habitual snorers. Waking hypertension was not associated with sleep-related breathing disorders in this older sample. In some older persons with sleep-related breathing disorders, sympathetic reflexes may be impaired, permitting hypotension and risk of circulatory failure. Epidemiologic evidence supports the hypothesis that this mechanism can explain the elevated incidence of cerebral infarction during sleep.\r"

Isolated reduction of carbon monoxide diffusing lung capacity (DCO), usually subclinical, was the most commonly detected functional abnormality in the SLE population, whereas it was absent in the comparison group. Isolated small airways disease (SAD) was observed in a relatively high percentage of patients, but not significantly different from that in the healthy people. Restrictive and obstructive patterns were very unusual in the SLE people and absent in the members of the comparison group. Finally, normal lung function was seen in the majority of the latter, but only in one third of the lupus patients. Subclinical respiratory dysfunction, most commonly expressed as diminished DCO, is a common feature of SLE.\r"

In ten asthmatic and ten healthy subjects, DCO and its components, membrane diffusing capacity (Dm) and pulmonary capillary blood volume (Qc) were measured by the single-breath method. Values were normalized for alveolar volume (VA). The mean DCO/VA was higher in the asthma groups as was the Qc/VA. The Dm/Qc was also higher in the asthma group. In the asthmatic but not the healthy subjects, both DCO/VA and Qc/VA were negatively correlated with the forced expiratory flow at 50 percent of vital capacity and peak inspiratory flow rate. Thus, DCO/VA may be increased in asthmatic patients with only mild airflow limitation; this may be due to an elevated capillary blood volume.\r"

During the ten years, there was a decrease in FEV1 of 0.89 +/- 0.40 L p less than 0.001), with a range of 0.20 to 1.55 L (which could not clearly be related to smoking habits or to initial lung function), a decrease in elastic recoil (p less than 0.05, with a decrease of Ptp, TLC by 6 +/- 7 cm H2O; p approximately equal to 0.05), an increase in TLC of 0.46 +/- 0.80 1 (p approximately equal to 0.05), and in RV/TLC of 9 +/- 3 percent (p less than 0.001). The resistance of the upstream segment (ratio Ptp/Vmax) increased slightly but generally remained within normal limits.

All patients who healed showed an important increase in collagenolysis; patients who improved had normal or high values, but significantly less than those obtained in patients who healed. Finally, five out of the six patients who did not improve or worsened had a significant decrease in degradation. These findings support the notion that a diminution of local collagenolysis may play a role in the progression to fibrosis in some patients with hypersensitivity pneumonitis and can also be a useful tool to predict the prognosis of this disease.\r"

Tissue evaluation included (1) paraffin embedment and light microscopy screening for fibrosis and ferruginous bodies, and (2) tissue digestion, which was analyzed by the combination of (A) light microscopy screening for ferruginous bodies and (B) electron microscopy (EM) screening for uncoated fibers. Using standard pathology techniques to classify the small samples was generally unsuccessful, the samples being too small or their size compounding other random sampling problems. The most reliable method of establishing which transbronchial biopsy tissue samples were from the occupationally exposed group occurred when light and EM analyses were used to evaluate digested tissue. The combined data from the EM analysis of two samples per subject indicated controls had two or fewer observed asbestos fibers, while the amosite asbestos workers had six or more fibers. This distinction was valid even in those who, 21 years before sampling, had worked for only a few weeks in the asbestos plant.\r"

In response to a decrease in arterial oxygen content secondary to hypoxemia, cerebral blood flow (CBF) increases, a response likely mediated by the release of adenosine. We studied the effect of theophylline, a potent adenosine antagonist, on CBF and cerebral oxygen delivery (CO2D) during hypoxemia in five healthy adult male volunteers. The CBF was measured using 133Xe clearance under conditions of (1) normoxemia (O2 saturation greater than 95 percent); (2) hypoxemia (O2 saturation = 80 percent); (3) normoxemia following aminophylline (the ethylene diamine salt of theophylline) 6 mg/kg intravenously; and (4) hypoxemia following aminophylline. Aminophylline decreased CBF and CO2D during both normoxemia and hypoxemia, but did not prevent the increase in CBF accompanying hypoxemia, suggesting that the increase in CBF in response to hypoxemia may not be mediated by adenosine or that customary doses of aminophylline are insufficient to inhibit adenosine-mediated cerebral vasodilation in response to hypoxemia. The significant decrease in CBF and CO2D observed following aminophylline is potentially clinically important and should be considered in the selection of bronchodilator therapy.\r"

We examined the incidence of coccidioidomycosis during pregnancy in Tucson, Arizona, an area endemic for this infection. After reviewing the records of three separate health care facilities, we found ten cases of coccidioidomycosis among 47,120 pregnancies. Nine of the ten women had no underlying disease. Seven were diagnosed with coccidioidomycosis during either the first or second trimester. Illness resolved in all seven. Three other patients were diagnosed during the first ten days postpartum. While infection was self-limited in one woman, two others developed severe disseminated coccidioidomycosis associated with meningitis. Despite this, there were no maternal deaths. Of eight deliveries, all were uncomplicated and produced healthy infants. In summary, diagnosing coccidioidomycosis during pregnancy is rare. Although we observed no maternal death, our experience suggests that women who develop coccidioidomycosis late in pregnancy are at risk for developing severe disseminated infection.\r"

Although earlier criticisms are well taken, much of the resistance to the application of probability analysis is based on tradition, rather than logic. Probabilistic algorithms, like any new technology, must be researched and developed and then withstand the test of time. They should not be dismissed simply because they are not traditional. On the other hand, probability analysis in the diagnosis of coronary artery disease must not be accepted just because it is attractive or because it appears to simplify clinical decisions. Application of probabilistic approaches should depend on their accuracy. There is evidence that results of tests and clinical data are not statistically independent. There is also evidence that sensitivities and specificities derived from pooled literature cannot be appropriately applied to just any patient in a particular institution. This is due to variability in the population of patients, a lack of standardization of testing methods, and methodologic problems in reporting results of sensitivities and specificities. In a large institution, where probabilistic formulae can be derived with some degree of confidence, probability analysis has an application today. Discriminant functions will be more accurate than Bayesian formulas, but whatever method one chooses, one must be certain that the parameters used are appropriate. Where the institution is not large enough to generate such a data base, there is presently no accurate approach to the estimation of the probability of coronary disease.\r"

The prevalence of bronchial asthma was inversely related with the level of coffee intake. Compared with subjects who did not drink coffee, the age- and sex-adjusted relative risks were 0.95 for one cup, 0.77 for two and 0.72 for three or more cups per day. This inverse relation was of comparable magnitude at younger and older ages, not explainable through selection, since the sample was representative of the general Italian population and the participation rate was 93.4 percent, or through confounding by several identified potential distorting factors. Thus, the results of this survey provide epidemiologic confirmation of previous clinical observations that caffeine intake has a bronchodilator effect in asthma, and indirectly suggest that long-term moderate coffee consumption may not only reduce symptoms, but also prevent the clinical manifestation of bronchial asthma. An alternative explanation of these findings is that subjects receiving treatment for asthma might tend to reduce their coffee consumption, in consequence of the side effects shared by sympathomimetics, theophylline and caffeine. Thus, further studies taking simultaneously into account methylxanthine intake from beverages and drug treatments are required before considering causal the apparent protection which emerged.\r"

The deployment of the pre-transplant TAH during the current shortage of donor hearts means that the TAH creates its own incentive as a way to compete in an expanded pool of donor heart candidates. Policies to address the orderly deployment and costs of the pretransplant TAH are needed. Research design and current pre-transplant clinical applications require careful consideration of planning for the termination of TAH support for severely injured but not brain dead patients.\r"

Aerosol antibiotics are expensive, but the cost is minimal compared with the cost of a hospital admission or intravenous antibiotics. When this method of administration of antibiotics first began to be widely used in the treatment of CF, there was much concern that hypersensitivity reactions might occur and that drug-resistant organisms would cause clinical problems. Minimal drug hypersensitivity has been reported, and there is no solid evidence that the small increase in resistance to some antibiotics associated with the use of aerosol antibiotics is in any way detrimental to the patients. These minor disadvantages must be weighed against the possible advantage of using aerosol antibiotics in any given clinical situation.\r"

Pharmacokinetic parameters were derived using compartmental and model-independent analyses. The absolute bioavailability of gentamicin was complete and did not differ from control values using both model-independent (LAGRAN) and model-dependent (ADAPT) analyses. The rate of gentamicin absorption in patients with SCI was, however, significantly slower, with a mean absorption time of 2.55 h compared with 0.96 h in able-bodied controls (p less than or equal to 0.05). Mean volume of distribution steady-state (Vssd) of gentamicin was demonstrated to be 33-47 percent greater in spinal cord injury than in controls (p less than 0.05). We conclude that the absorption of gentamicin from paralyzed muscle is significantly impaired, and in conjunction with an increase in Vssd results in delayed, decreased peak serum levels in patients with SCI.\r"

  ".W": "To determine if the pattern of GH delivery is important for the regulation of serum somatomedin-C/insulin-like growth factor I (Sm-C/IGF-I) and liver somatogenic receptors, we have measured serum Sm-C/IGF-I concentrations and free (H2O-treated homogenates) and total (MgCl2-treated homogenates) liver GH-binding sites in hypophysectomized rats treated for 7 days with rat GH (rGH), given either continuously by osmotic minipumps (50 and 250 micrograms/day) or intermittently (four sc injections of 12.5 micrograms/day). At a daily dose of 50 micrograms, intermittent rGH produced greater weight gain [+29.7 +/- 0.8 g (mean +/- SE)] than continuous GH infusion (23.3 +/- 2.0 g; P less than 0.01). Likewise, the serum Sm-C/IGF-I concentration rose more with intermittent (0.33 +/- 0.1 U/ml) than with continuous delivery (0.17 +/- 0.01 U/ml; P less than 0.01). The serum Sm-C/IGF-I level achieved with repeated GH injections was even greater than that after continuous delivery of a 5-fold higher GH dose (250 micrograms/day; 0.27 +/- 0.02 U/ml; P less than 0.05). Continuous infusions of 50 and 250 micrograms rGH/day increased the number of liver total GH receptors by 2.5-fold over that of controls. In contrast, frequent GH injections did not affect GH binding, and the serum Sm-C/IGF-I concentration did not correlate with liver GH-binding sites in the GH-injected rats (r = 0.189; P = NS). Induction of hepatic PRL receptors was 10-fold higher when GH was given continuously than when it was given intermittently. The close correlation observed between GH- and PRL-binding sites in all GH-treated rats (r = 0.955; P less than 0.001) suggests that their regulation may be linked. These data suggest that the regulatory mechanism controlling Sm-C/IGF-I production and growth might be different from those that regulate GH receptor concentrations, with GH pulses being crucial for the maximal stimulation of Sm-C/IGF and growth, but continuous exposure to GH being required for up-regulation of liver GH receptors.\r"

  ".W": "In the intact adult male rat, cyclosporine (CsA) induces a significant decrease in serum testosterone (T), serum LH, and intratesticular T. To elucidate the mechanism of action of this CsA-induced hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, castrated male rats were treated with oral CsA (30 mg/kg.day) or vehicle alone, and serum LH was measured after 1, 2, and 4 weeks of treatment. Surprisingly, serum LH was higher in these CsA-treated castrated rats at 1, 2, and 4 weeks than in castrated controls. To provide insight into the cause of this increase in serum LH, a T implant (8 mm) was inserted (at week 5 of treatment) in both CsA-treated and control castrated animals, and serum LH was measured 1 week after insertion of the T implant. Serum LH levels decreased to control values after insertion of the T implant. Subsequently, two other groups of rats received 8-mm T implant at the time of castration and were then treated up to 4 weeks with either CsA or vehicle alone. Serum LH showed a significant decrease in these CsA- plus T-treated animals compared to the vehicle- plus T-treated animals. A GnRH stimulation test performed after 2 weeks of CsA/vehicle treatment showed a significant increase in serum LH in all the rats 30 min after GnRH administration (1, 10, 30, and 100 ng/100 g BW, ip), indicating a normal pituitary response. The increase in LH after exogenous GnRH treatment was more significant in CsA-treated intact rats than in the controls. There was no difference in creatinine clearance between intact and castrate T-treated rats regardless of whether they received CsA. These studies indicate that the hypogonadotropic hypogonadism induced by CsA in intact male rats is mediated through the hypothalamic-pituitary axis, primarily at its hypothalamus end, does not seem to be due to the nephrotoxicity of CsA, and is modulated by T and/or its metabolites.\r"

  ".W": "The glucose-fed rat, in contrast to the chow-fed animal, has a higher serum total T3 concentration and an increase in the hepatic content of T4 5'-deiodinase (type I) activity. The mechanism and significance of these glucose-induced changes in T3 metabolism are elucidated in this study. To focus on extrathyroidal thyroid hormone metabolism the kinetic parameters were determined in thyroidectomized T4-replaced rats (1.25 micrograms T4/100 g BW.day). Kinetics of T4 and T3 were studied separately by infusing labeled hormone to equilibrium. Glucose feeding for 72 h (G) significantly increased both the total and free serum T3 concentrations compared to the respective means in the chow-fed control group (P). The glucose-induced changes in serum T3 reflect the approximate doubling of T3 production to 14.7 +/- 0.6 ng/h.100 g in G rats compared to 7.6 +/- 0.7 ng/h.100 g in P rats. The higher T3 production rate in the G group is due to a significant increase in the fractional total body T4 to T3 conversion (0.33 +/- 0.02) compared to that in the P group (0.19 +/- 0.02). The tissue (liver, kidney, brain, and brown adipose tissue) concentration of T4 (nanograms per g wet wt) was significantly increased in the G group. The increase ranged from 54% in liver to 80% in kidney, brain, and brown adipose tissue. The tissue concentration of T3 (nanograms per g wet wt) was even more dramatically increased by glucose feeding than was T4. The glucose-induced increment in organ T3 ranged from 2.5-fold (kidney, muscle, and brain) to 5-fold (liver and white adipose tissue) to 12-fold (brown adipose tissue). These data indicate that the increase in serum total and free T3 concentrations associated with glucose feeding reflects augmented total body T3 production from T4. The effect of the enhanced T3 neogenesis was generalized, as the T3 content was increased in each organ studied. Thus, glucose feeding has unique effects on T3 metabolism.\r"

Both enzymes are localized to lysosomes. The activity profile of cysteine proteinase I combined with its sensitivity to the active site inhibitor Z-Phe-Phe-CNH2 suggest that it is distinct from other cysteine proteinases described so far. Cysteine proteinase I and cathepsin-B had respective pH optima of 3.5-4.0 and 4.5-5.0 with thyroglobulin (Tg) as substrate. Based on Km/Kcat (catalytic constant) ratios, cysteine proteinase I degraded rabbit [125I]Tg to peptide intermediates 50 times more efficiently than did cathepsin-B. Under conditions of limited digestion, both enzymes cleaved Tg at three or more sites, producing iodinated fragments of 20,000-50,000 mol wt (cysteine proteinase I) or 10,000-40,000 mol wt (cathepsin-B). Tryptic digests of these fragments were isolated by HPLC, and those containing thyroid hormone were sequenced for identification of amino acids and localization of 125I. Cysteine proteinase I cleaved peptides primarily from the C-terminal region of Tg, which contained two major hormonogenic sites, while cathepsin-B produced peptides mainly from the N-terminus, containing another major hormonogenic site. We suggest that the roles of cysteine proteinase I and cathepsin-B are the rapid initial fragmentation of Tg at opposite ends of the molecule, making hormone-containing sites accessible to additional cleavage by other lysosomal endopeptidases and exopeptidases.\r"

Fifteen 23-day-old ovariectomized and adrenalectomized female Holtzman rats were injected sc with 5 micrograms 17 beta-estradiol in oil/100 g BW daily for 4 days. On the fifth day, all animals were injected iv with 1 microgram/100 g BW [3H]ORG.2058, a synthetic progestin. The animals were killed after 30 or 60 min, and the brains were frozen and processed for autoradiography. Nuclear concentration of radioactivity was found in certain cells of the forebrain and midbrain and was prevented by prior injection (15 min) of excess unlabeled ORG.2058. In the preoptic-septal region, progestin-labeled neurons were observed in the nucleus (n.) septi lateralis, n. interstitialis striae terminalis, n. preopticus medialis, n. preopticus lateralis, n. preopticus periventricularis, and n. preopticus suprachiasmaticus. In the hypothalamus, labeled neurons were seen in n. periventricularis hypothalami, n. arcuatus hypothalami, n. ventromedialis hypothalami, n. dorsomedialis hypothalami, n. premammillaris ventralis, n. premammillaris dorsalis, and lateral hypothalamus. In the extrahypothalamic region, a few labeled cells were found in the central, medial, and cortical nuclei of the amygdala, the organum subforniculare, the lateral geniculate nucleus, the parietal and entorhinal cortex, and the central gray of the midbrain. Some of the progestin-concentrating cells were characterized with combined autoradiography and immunocytochemistry. Tyrosine hydroxylase-containing cells of the arcuate nucleus and the hypothalamic periventricular nucleus (group A12) showed nuclear concentration of radioactivity. Tyrosine hydroxylase cells in groups A11, A13, and A14; the substantia nigra (group A9); and the ventral tegmental area (group A10) did not show nuclear concentration of [3H]ORG.2058. The autoradiographic study demonstrates specific progestin-binding sites in nuclei of neurons in select areas of the rat brain. The results of combined autoradiography and immunocytochemistry suggest, for the first time, a direct action of progestin on tuberoinfundibular dopaminergic neurons.\r"

Adrenalectomy did not affect the concentration of SS-like immunoreactivity in the brain areas studied. Nevertheless, the number of SS receptors was significantly decreased in membrane preparations from hippocampus, striatum, and hypothalamus, but not in cerebral cortex. No significant differences in the apparent binding affinity values were seen after adrenalectomy. The adrenalectomy-induced decreases in [125I-Tyr11]SS receptors were completely reversed by glucocorticoid replacement with dexamethasone. These results demonstrate that adrenalectomy modulates SS receptors in discrete brain areas, suggesting the existence of a possible relationship between corticosteroids and SS in the neuronal activity of these structures. The physiological significance of these findings remains to be clarified.\r"

  ".U": "88283522\r", 
  ".W": "Testosterone (T) exerts its actions in brain directly via androgen receptors or, after aromatization to estradiol, via estrogen receptors. Brain aromatase activity in teleost fish is 100-1000 times greater than in mammals and would be expected to significantly reduce the quantity of androgen available for receptor binding. Experiments were carried out on the goldfish Carassius auratus to determine if androgen receptors are present in teleost brain and whether their physicochemical properties reflect elevated aromatase. Cytosolic and nuclear extracts were assayed with the use of [3H]T and charcoal, Sephadex LH-20, or DNA-cellulose chromatography to separate bound and free steroids. Binding activity was saturable and had an equally high affinity for T and 5 alpha-dihydrotestosterone (Kd, approximately 2.4 X 10(-9) M). Although mibolerone was a relatively weak competitor, the putative teleost androgen 11-ketotestosterone, methyltrienolone (R1881), estradiol, progesterone, and cortisol were poor ligands. Characteristics that distinguish this receptor from a steroid-binding protein in goldfish serum are the presence of binding activity in both nuclear and cytosolic extracts, a low rate of ligand-receptor dissociation, electrophoretic mobility, sedimentation properties in low vs. high salt, and tissue distribution (forebrain greater than or equal to pituitary greater than mid-/hindbrain). DNA cellulose-adhering and nonadhering forms were detected, but these did not differ in other variables measured. Although goldfish androgen receptors resembled those of mammals in all important physicochemical characteristics, they were unusually abundant (5-68 pmol/g tissue) compared to levels in rat brain, but comparable to levels in prostate and other male sex hormone target organs. Moreover, there were seasonal variations in total receptors, with a peak at spawning (April) 4- to 5-fold higher than values in reproductively inactive fish (July/August). This temporal pattern and magnitude of change corresponded to previously reported changes in brain aromatase. Thus, both phylogenetic and physiological correlates point to a functional interdependence between androgen receptors and aromatase in the brain. These studies in goldfish indicate that brain androgen receptors have a long evolutionary history and have been highly conserved through the vertebrate series.\r"

  ".W": "To determine whether the decrease in hepatic T3 nuclear receptors in rats bearing the Walker 256 carcinoma (T rats) is a consequence of nonthyroidal disease or related to a generalized decrease in hepatic protein synthesis, we measured hepatic T3 nuclear receptors and [3H]leucine incorporation into protein in control and T rats. Mean protein contents of liver homogenate, purified nuclei, 0.4 M NaCl extracts of nuclei, and nonhistone protein fractions were similar in control and T rats. In pooled data from three experiments, [3H]leucine incorporation into protein in these liver fractions was significantly increased (55-73%) in T rats. Since the precursor nonradioactive leucine pool, measured by a novel HPLC method, was similar in control and T rats, the increased incorporation of [3H]leucine in all liver fractions suggests an increase in protein synthesis in T rats. Additional measurements in the same rats (two experiments) indicated that hepatic nuclear receptors were decreased to 50% of the control value in T rats (P less than 0.001). Our findings suggest that in the Walker tumor model of nonthyroidal disease, decreased hepatic nuclear T3 receptors appears relatively specific and is not associated with a generalized decrease in hepatic protein synthesis.\r"

Two forms of high affinity P receptor were separated by diethyl aminoethyl (DEAE)-Sepharose anion exchange chromatography; the A form eluted in low salt buffer, and the B form at a KCl concentration of 0.20 M in a linear gradient. After photoaffinity labeling of crude cytosol with [3H] R5020, two overlapping peaks of radioactivity were detected with sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. After separation with DEAE-Sepharose and photoaffinity labeling, the A form migrated as a single peak with a mol wt of 90,000, and the B form as a single peak with a mol wt of 123,000. The affinity (Kd, 2.9 X 10(-9) M), capacity (1 pmol/mg protein), and binding specificity were characteristic of a P receptor. P competed most effectively for [3H]P binding. R5020 and deoxycorticosterone were good competitors; 5 alpha-pregnenolone, 17 alpha-hydroxyprogesterone, and testosterone were quite effective; cortisol, corticosterone, aldosterone, and 5 alpha-dihydrotestosterone were poor competitors. A lower affinity P-binding component (Kd, 1 X 10(-7) M; maximum binding, 15 pmol/mg protein) co-eluted from DEAE-Sepharose columns with the A and B receptor forms. This is the first description of a hepatic P receptor in any vertebrate.\r"

N-terminal amino acid sequences have been determined for this protein purified from both these sources and a single N-terminal amino acid sequence Ala Pro Trp Gln Cys Ala Pro Cys Ser Ala Glu Lys Leu Ala Leu Pro Pro was obtained. The first ten residues are identical to those previously reported for the small mol wt IGF BP isolated from amniotic fluid and HEPG2 culture medium. However it was different to that reported for the IGF BP isolated from term placenta, placental protein 12 (PP12), a protein previously suggested to originate in the endometrium. These data suggest that at least two distinct forms of the small mol wt IGF BP exist and supports the hypothesis that the amniotic fluid form originates from the pregnancy endometrium.\r"

When pineal gland, frontal cortex, and cerebellum nyctohemeral profiles were studied, none of them showed variations. Cold exposure for 4 h led to an increase in the enzymatic activity 10-fold above the basal values for BAT, while in the pineal gland the values were doubled; cold exposure failed to change the 5'-D II activity in the frontal cortex. Acute melatonin treatment caused a 7-fold increase in 5'-D II activity in BAT, but did not affect enzyme activity in either the pineal gland or frontal cortex. The data indicate that 5'-D II in Richardson's ground squirrel shows classical localizations. Additionally, two new regulatory factors of 5'-D II are reported, i.e. melatonin for BAT and cold for the pineal gland.\r"

An additional group of OVX and control rats was injected daily with vehicle alone. All rats were killed 35 days after OVX, and their proximal tibiae were processed undecalcified for quantitative bone histomorphometry. Trabecular bone volume was markedly reduced in vehicle-treated OVX rats relative to that in control rats (12.1% vs. 26.7%). This bone loss was associated with a 2-fold increase in osteoclast surface and a 4-fold increase in osteoblast surface. The bone formation rate, studied with fluorochrome labeling, was also significantly elevated in vehicle-treated OVX rats (0.111 vs. 0.026 micron3/micron2.day). In contrast, treatment of OVX rats with the three doses of estradiol resulted in normalization of tibial trabecular bone volume and a decline in histomorphometric indices of bone resorption and formation. Our results indicate that estrogen treatment provides complete protection against osteopenia in OVX rats. The protective mechanism involves estrogenic suppression of bone turnover. These findings are consistent with the skeletal effects of estrogen therapy in postmenopausal women.\r"

  ".W": "The hypothalamic peptide somatostatin (SRIF) suppresses secretory activity in phenotypically distinct pituitary endocrine cells. We have used tight-seal whole-cell recording techniques to study the peptide's effects on the electrical properties of tumor pituitary cells derived from rat (GH3/B6) and human adenomas that secrete human PRL in a SRIF-sensitive manner. Both cell types exhibited qualitatively similar electrophysiological properties and electrical responses to SRIF. Under the experimental conditions employed the majority of cells spontaneously generated Ca2+-dependent actions potentials. The actions of the peptide on cellular excitability were markedly affected by the presence of horse and fetal calf sera. Without these additives the electrical responses faded and could not be studied in detail. Therefore, recordings were conducted in media containing sera. In the presence of sera almost all cells spontaneously generated Ca2+ action potentials, and peptide-induced changes in excitability were well preserved. SRIF depressed spontaneous and evoked action potential activity in a dose-dependent manner at concentrations that reduced intracellular free calcium ([Ca2+]i) and suppressed basal PRL release. Current and voltage clamp experiments revealed coordinate actions of the peptide on excitable membrane properties. SRIF (1 nM) enhanced a depolarization-activated, rapidly inactivating outward K+ current, thereby effectively reducing the rate at which action potentials occurred. Over the 10-1000 nM range SRIF slowly activated a virtually noninactivating K+ conductance over a wide range of membrane potential. This effectively hyperpolarized cells away from the threshold for triggering Ca2+-dependent action potentials and shunted the membrane. The peptide induced K+ conductance activated at the level of the resting potential was progressively lost during the intracellular dialysis of whole-cell recording. Dilute aqueous lysates of cells included in the patch pipette prevented much of the rundown of this SRIF-induced electrical response while inclusion of an ATP-regenerating system preserved some of the peptide action. Over the 10-100 nM concentration range SRIF also reduced voltage-dependent Ca2+ current. Furthermore, pretreatment of cells with pertussis toxin abolished SRIF action on cellular excitability, suggesting that SRIF can regulate the function of ionic channels through GTP-binding proteins (G proteins). The results demonstrate that SRIF acts coordinately on the primary conductances expressed in tumor PRL cells to attenuate or block Ca2+ action potential generation and thus Ga2+ entry from extracellular sources.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Several studies indicate that the disappearance rate of ACTH in different species is very rapid. The conditions under which these estimates were obtained, however, can be regarded in most cases as nonphysiological. The present studies were designed to evaluate the half-life of endogenous ACTH in rats under physiological conditions, i.e. awaken freely moving animals that were bled continuously through an indwelling iv cannula. Blood sampling at 1-min intervals allowed the detailed characterization of the ACTH pulsatile pattern. Analysis of each secretory episode indicated that many of the pulses could be used for half-life determinations, provided that the down phase of the pulse consisted of three or more points decaying in a straight line. After logarithmic transformation of the values, the declining slopes were analyzed by linear regression to determine which slopes showed a significant negative correlation. From those values the half-life estimates, in minutes, were calculated. Two groups of animals were used for these studies. In one group, blood was removed continuously without replacement. In these animals, ACTH levels rose progressively due to the hemorrhage effect, although secretion continued to be pulsatile. In a second group, blood was replaced at the same rate of withdrawal through a femoral vein, and ACTH levels remained constant throughout the experiment. The results indicate that the average ACTH half-life was 5.94 and 7.06 min for the groups without and with blood replacement, respectively. The differences between the two groups were not significant. Analysis of the frequency distribution of the calculated half-lives indicates that two populations can be separated, a fast (decays less than 8 min) and a slow one (decays greater than 8 min). Less than half of the secretory episodes showed a decay according to the half-life. This observation indicates that some secretory episodes consist of a burst of secretory activity followed by a period during which secretion is essentially turned off. Under these conditions, decays correspond to the half-life of the hormone. Other episodes show protracted secretory activity, as indicated by the slower, nonlinear decay. These observations suggest that half-life of ACTH may vary from one episode to another, and that the different types of secretory episodes recorded may reflect the multifactorial control of ACTH secretion by the hypothalamus.\r"

  ".W": "These studies were designed to evaluate the importance of the gonads on the inhibitory influence exerted by the endogenous opiate system on gonadotropin secretion. The effect of the opioid receptor antagonist naloxone on pulsatile LH secretion was evaluated in 1-, 2-, and 8-week orchidectomized (ORDX) rats. Freely moving rats bearing a Silastic cannula in the right jugular vein were bled every 6 min for 3 h. Saline was injected during the first 90 min, while during the last 90 min naloxone was given as an initial iv bolus injection dose of 2 mg/kg, followed by injections of 0.1 mg/kg every 6 min. In addition, another group of rats was treated, from the beginning of the 3-h bleeding period, with naloxone at an initial iv dose of 2 mg/kg, followed by injections of 0.1 mg/kg every 6 min. Analysis of pulsatile LH secretion showed enhanced mean LH levels, peak and trough values, and pulse duration in 1- and 2-week ORDX rats during the first 40 min of naloxone administration. These changes were essentially restricted to the first pulse that occurred immediately after naloxone administration. No changes in any of the parameters evaluated were observed in 8-week ORDX rats. Different regimens of testosterone replacement (capsules or sc injections) in 8-week ORDX rats significantly reduced the elevated LH value and completely suppressed pulsatile LH secretion. However, in these animals the response of LH to naloxone administration was restored in a limited number of animals among those receiving sc injections. The results indicate that the gonads play a permissive role in the inhibitory action of the endogenous opiate system on gonadotropin secretion, since a loss of sensitivity to opiate receptor blockade takes place after long term gonadectomy. The delayed loss of the response to naloxone after gonadectomy suggests that gonadal factors may have an activational and/or organizational effect on the opiate neurons involved in gonadotropin regulation. The precise mechanism(s) responsible for this loss of sensitivity is still unknown.\r"

  ".W": "Understanding of steroid receptors is derived largely from the mammalian uterus and avian oviduct, and we have sought to characterize steroid receptors in relationship to natural cycles in subavian species. Here we report a putative estrogen receptor associated with the vitellogenic cycle in the female viviparous watersnake, Nerodia. Estrogen binding in cytosolic and nuclear hepatic cell extracts exhibits the following characteristics: high affinity (Kd, 1.3 X 10(-9) M cytosol; 5.7 X 10(-10) M nuclear extract), steroid specificity for natural estrogens, association time of 1 h at 22 C and 4 h at 0 C, and dissociation rate of 0.0268 min-1 at 0 C (half-time, 11.2 min) and 0.322 min-1 at 22 C (half-time, 0.906 min). Both cytosolic and nuclear estrogen binding are target organ specific; binding is low to undetectable in lung, skeletal muscle, and intestine and present in liver, oviduct, and kidney. A sedimentation coefficient of 6S was demonstrated in cytosol under low or high salt conditions, and a sedimentation coefficient of 3.5S was found in nuclear extract. Nuclear location of the receptor is indicated by extraction of increasing amounts of receptor by increasing KCl concentrations up to 0.5 M; 50% of the binding is extracted by 0.16 M KCl. Nuclear estrogen binding is increased significantly after estrogen injection. This estrogen-binding moiety is unusual, since it does not bind to the synthetic estrogen diethylstilbestrol, to antiestrogen clomiphene derivatives, or to calf thymus DNA-cellulose and diethylaminoethyl-Sepharose. Significant changes in cytosolic and nuclear hepatic estrogen receptor levels correlate with vitellogenic stage.\r"

  ".W": "Vitamin D3 and its hormonally active metabolite 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 [1,25-(OH)2D3] can be metabolized to a number of daughter metabolites, including 1 alpha,25-(OH)2D3-26,23-lactone; this latter compound has four diastereoisomers. The 23(S),25(R)-lactone (naturally occurring) and the 23(R),25(S)-1 alpha,25-(OH)2D3-26,23-lactone are both known to be able to inhibit bone resorption induced by 1 alpha,25-(OH)2D3 under in vivo or in vitro conditions. To understand the mechanism of the inhibitory action of these two isomers on bone resorption we investigated the effects of 1 alpha,25-(OH)2D3-26,23-lactone on unfractionated mouse bone marrow cells in vitro. The addition of 1 alpha,25-(OH)2D3 to these cultures dose-dependently stimulated the formation of multinucleated cells over a range of 10(-9) - 10(-7) M. The 23(S),25(S)- and 23(R),25(R)-1 alpha,25-(OH)2D3-26,23-lactones also increased the number of multinucleated cells, whereas the 23(S),25(R)- and 23(R),25(S)-1 alpha,25-(OH)2D3-26,23-lactones failed to do so. In addition, these latter two diastereomers inhibited the 1 alpha,25-(OH)2D3 stimulation of multinucleated cell formation, although the 23(S),25(S)- and 23(R),25(R)-1 alpha,25-(OH)2D3-26,23-lactones and 24R,25-(OH)2D3 did not. These multinucleated cells responded to calcitonin and contained tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase, both of which are characteristic of osteoclasts. The present data suggest that inhibition of multinucleated cell formation is the mechanism by which the 23(S),25(R)- or 23(R),25(S)-1 alpha,25-(OH)2D3-26,23-lactone inhibits bone resorption induced by 1 alpha,25-(OH)2D3.\r"

The effect of chronic treatment with the ganglionic blocker chlorisondamine (5 mg/kg) was also assessed. Free enkephalin immunoreactivity and total enkephalin immunoreactivity, as determined by enzymatic digestion of large enkephalin containing fragments, were quantitated in the adrenal glands at 11 days and 7, 16, and 24 weeks of age. Both total and free metenkephalin were significantly diminished in the adrenal of SHR when compared to WKY at all ages tested. The analysis of the chromatographic profile showed that SHR displayed reduced levels of high and low molecular weight materials at 11 days and 16 weeks of age; however intermediate compounds were high in the glands of these animals. Similar increased values for free met-enkephalin were found in adrenals of WKY and SHR after ganglionic blocker treatment, which means that the relative increase was larger in SHR than WKY; while for total enkephalin the relative increase and the concentration reached in SHR was about half of those presented in WKY. These and other results presented suggest that the basic alteration of the adrenal proenkephalin system of SHR may be due to a genetic reduction of proenkephalin levels. Otherwise, the free enkephalin decrease could be related to changes in nervous input to the adrenal gland.\r"

  ".W": "The purpose of this study was to characterize the effects of thyroid hormone on the Na-K pump and resting membrane potential (EM) of rat skeletal myotubes in culture. Myotubes were obtained from fetal (19-21 day) or neonatal rats (1-2 day) by serial trypsinization and maintained in culture for up to 10 days. Cells were treated with T4 or T3 on day 6 or 7, and measurements were made of EM, [3H]ouabain binding, and ouabain-sensitive 86Rb uptake at various times thereafter. Hormone treatment increased the values of all three variables within 24 h, plateau levels being attained by 48-72 h. Cycloheximide and actinomycin D totally blocked the effects of thyroid hormone when added together to the cells, thus suggesting that protein synthesis is necessary for the effects of these hormones. Scatchard analysis showed that the new receptors have lower ouabain affinity than those in control. Blockade of spontaneously occurring action potentials with tetrodotoxin, which blocks voltage-dependent Na channels, or Na/H antiporter with amiloride, abolished the hormone effects seen after 24 h and significantly reduced those obtained after 48 h of hormone treatment. The results demonstrate that thyroid hormone-induced increased amount and activity of the electrogenic Na-K pump in cultured myotubes occurs, at least in part, in response to an initial effect to increase Na influx. Moreover, the findings are consistent with the concept that the Na-K pump plays an important role in regulation of EM in this preparation.\r"

  ".W": "Thyroid hormone (TH) action on somatostatin (SRIF) secretion and synthesis by fetal rat brain cells in culture was studied. Cortical and hypothalamic brain cells were maintained as monolayer cultures for 7-10 days. T3, T4, and [3H] phenylalanine [( 3H]Phe) (40 microCi/plate) were added simultaneously for 48 h. Alternately, cultures were pulse labeled with [3H] Phe for only the last 3 h, after being exposed to TH for 45 h. 3H-Labeled SRIF-like material [( 3H]IR-SRIF) was purified by immunoaffinity chromatography and further characterized by gel filtration in Bio-Gel P-10. Total protein synthesis was determined by the incorporation of [3H]Phe into trichloroacetic acid precipitable proteins. Forty eight-hour T3 treatment had a biphasic effect on secretion of IR-SRIF by both cortical and hypothalamic cells. In cortical cells, low doses of T3 (10(-11) M) significantly increased (P less than 0.01) and high T3 doses (10(-7) M) significantly decreased (P less than 0.05) total IR-SRIF (nanograms per plate); control: 2 +/- 0.25; T3 (10(-11) M): 3 +/- 0.3; T3 (10(-7) M): 1.3 +/- 0.1. Similarly, T4 had a significant stimulatory action at 10(-9) M, being inhibitory at 10(-7) M (picograms/plate); control: 290 +/- 20 T4 (10(-9) M): 510 +/- 40; T4 (10(-7) M): 201 +/- 10. When [3H]Phe was added during the 48 h of the experiment, [3H]IR-SRIF synthesis in response to T3 by cortical cells significantly increased after exposure to 10(-11) M (P less than 0.05) and decreased with 10(-7) M (P less than 0.05). When [3H]Phe was added for only the last 3 h or incubation with T3, the action was inhibitory at both 10(-11) M and 10(-7) M. Trichloroacetic acid precipitable material decreased in a dose response manner between T3, 10(-11) M and 10(-7) M. These findings suggest that at this time of brain development, SRIF synthesis by cortical and hypothalamic cells is affected by TH.\r"

  ".W": "Addition of the cholinergic agents acetylcholine or carbamylcholine (CCh) to suspensions of human endometrial adenocarcinoma cells (Ishikawa line) preincubated with [3H] myoinositol promoted a rapid concentration-dependent hydrolysis of labeled phosphoinositides to inositol tris-, bis-, and monophosphates with EC50 values (mean +/- SE) of 3.5 +/- 1.6 and 26.5 +/- 4.8 microM, respectively. Atropine inhibition of the CCh effects (Ki = 1.6 +/- 1.3 nM) and the ineffectiveness of nicotinic antagonists indicate involvement of a muscarinic receptor. Both basal and CCh-stimulated production of inositol phosphates were higher in the presence of LiCl. The effect of LiCl on inositol monophosphate accumulation was concentration dependent (1-100 mM). Vasopressin, oxytocin, phenylephrine, histamine, and prostaglandin F2 alpha, had no apparent affect on inositol phosphate levels. Phorbol esters inhibited up to 35% of the effect of CCh on inositol phosphate accumulation. Triphenylethylene antiestrogens at micromolar concentrations increased inositol phosphate accumulation, but inhibited the effects of CCh. However, the rapid uptake of trypan blue observed after exposure to 10 microM tamoxifen suggests an alteration of the plasma membrane which may affect signal-transducing systems. The effects of CCh on the production of inositol phosphates and the expected concomitant liberation of diacylglycerol by transformed epithelial cells of human endometrium are of potential significance in normal endometrial physiology, since cholinergic innervation of endometrial glands has been reported, and the role of hormonally stimulated phosphoinositide hydrolysis in secretory mechanisms has been demonstrated in many systems.\r"

The pretreatment with neuraminidase significantly enhanced the specific binding of hLH to corpora lutea at the different stages of the luteal phase. Scatchard analyses revealed that neuraminidase increased the number of LH binding sites without altering the affinity for LH. Furthermore, the specific binding of hLH to human corpora lutea during pregnancy significantly increased after the pretreatment with neuraminidase. The data suggest that distinct populations of receptors for LH/hCG are masked within the human luteal cells.\r"

Serum RU486 concentrations were determined by a radioimmunoassay. The absorption of RU486 was rapid with peak serum levels reached approximately 90 minutes after a single oral dose (4 mg/kg). The disappearance of RU486 and its metabolites conformed to a noncompartmental model with a mean apparent half-life of 53.7 +/- 6.9 hours. The mean apparent volume of distribution and clearance rate were 1.47 +/- 0.25 l/kg and 1.04 +/- 0.09 1/hour, respectively. In comparison with a control group of normal women (n = 9), there were significant elevations in transverse mean cortisol levels in the RU486 group (P less than 0.01). However, mean adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) levels and the diurnal pattern of ACTH and cortisol secretion were not changed. RU486 induced a mild prolactin (PRL) elevation (P less than 0.01), whereas thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) levels were not altered. In view of the relatively slow clearance rate for RU486 and its metabolites, our findings suggest that the pharmacologic action of RU486 is prolonged after a single oral dose.\r"

Two hundred patients were studied in the follicular phase of the cycle. The serum levels of testosterone (T), androstenedione (A), or dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS) were not associated with BMI, whereas the T/sex hormone-binding globulin (T/SHBG) ratio was significantly correlated with BMI independently of the effect of age. All serum androgens were significantly negatively correlated with age, and the serum levels were significantly lower in women older than 41 years when compared with women aged 25 years or less. After correcting for the effect of BMI, there was also a negative correlation between the T/SHBG ratio and age. The correlations between serum androgen parameters were calculated. We conclude that already in reproductive years, the age of the patient has modulating effects on serum androgens, and it should be taken into account when studying the hormone profile of hirsute women.\r"

The regularity of the cycles was registered, and 109 of the patients were interviewed for their maximum weight, teenage obesity, and age of menarche. The serum androgens were measured in the follicular phase. The results indicate that facial hirsutism is associated with BMI (rho = 0.41, P less than 0.001) independently of age and the testosterone (T) to sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) ratio. Facial hirsutism is also correlated with age (rho = 0.37, P less than 0.001) irrespective of BMI (rho = 0.26, P less than 0.001) or the T/SHBG ratio (rho = 0.43, P less than 0.001). In contrast, the hair growth on trunk area is related to the T/SHBG ratio (rho = 0.35, P less than 0.001) but not to BMI or age when the correlations are adjusted for the grade of hyperandrogenemia. The women with severe facial hirsutism had a higher maximum weight (P less than 0.001) and more teenage obesity (P less than 0.01) than other hirsute patients. They also had a slightly earlier menarche compared with their agemates than the women with mild or absent facial hair (P less than 0.05).

Three groups were studied: (1) normal morphology, (2) good prognosis pattern, and (3) poor prognosis pattern. All other sperm parameters were normal. Group 3 had a lower overall fertilization rate, lower pregnancy rate/cycle, and lower ongoing pregnancy rate/cycle. Groups 2 and 3 showed a higher miscarriage rate, although not significantly different from group 1. By increasing insemination concentration from 2- to 10-fold, the fertilization rate in group 3 increased from 14.5% to 62.6%. However, pregnancy outcome did not improve.

There were no significant differences in either the follicular phase or luteal phase hormonal profiles of estradiol and progesterone, but there was a significantly reduced pregnancy rate in those women with severe endometriosis. In part, this was due to the recovery of fewer oocytes from the endometriosis patients (P less than 0.001) despite the fact that the peak estradiol levels and ovarian accessibility were similar in the two groups. However, there were no significant differences in the proportion of oocytes that fertilized or the number that demonstrated normal embryo growth and high-grade embryo quality.

  ".U": "88283964\r", 
  ".W": "A series of experiments was conducted to examine potential toxic effects of cryoprotectants on motility of human spermatozoa. The data indicated that exposure of spermatozoa to cryoprotectant medium for as little as 15 minutes at room temperature caused a reduction in motility. This reduction in motility was caused by glycerol. Lowering glycerol concentrations from 7.5% to 5.0% improved sperm motility at 24 hours post-thaw. Sperm motility was not affected by either slow or abrupt cooling rates above -5 degrees C. Motility was greater in cryopreserved sperm at 24 hours post-thaw when glycerol was added at -5 degrees C rather than at room temperature. These data suggest that avoiding glycerol toxicity either by reducing the concentration used or by adding glycerol at a lower temperature, or both, may improve human sperm cryosurvival rates.\r"

  ".W": "In male contraceptive trials, approximately half of normal men become azoospermic on high dosages of testosterone enanthate (TE), whereas the other half of men become severely oligozoospermic. To determine whether sperm function is reduced in men with severe oligozoospermia induced by TE, we studied sperm function in six normal men whose sperm counts were reduced to less than or equal to 5 X 10(6)/ml but not to azoospermia by high-dosage TE administration for 5 to 6 months and five normal men who received placebo (sesame oil) injections for the same period of time. Seminal fluid analysis and sperm function (as assessed by zona pellucida-free hamster ova penetration test, HOPT) were performed during a pretreatment period and after at least 3 months of TE or placebo treatment. HOPT was severely reduced in all six men, whose sperm counts were suppressed to severe oligozoospermia during TE (0.8 +/- 0.8% compared to 37 +/- 14% during the pretreatment period, P less than 0.05). Five men failed to penetrate any hamster ova, while the remaining man penetrated only 5% of ova during TE treatment. There were no significant changes in other seminal fluid measurements during high-dosage TE. The five men who received placebo injections did not demonstrate any significant changes in HOPT or seminal fluid analysis during the treatment period. In summary, we found that the fertilizing capacity of sperm is markedly diminished when sperm production is severely reduced by high-dosage TE administration. These findings suggest that male contraception may be achievable by reduction of spermatogenesis to severe oligozoospermia.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

This is an inefficient technique contributing to poor IVF prospects, false-negative scores in the sperm penetration assay (SPA), and inadequate quantification in the sperm chromosome assay (SCA). High yields of fusiogenically functional sperm were rapidly and efficiently prepared by exposing sperm suspensions to an electrical pulse of 750 to 1500 V cm-1 for 2.5 msec. This process was calcium-dependent, and sperm incorporation into zona-free hamster eggs exhibited a linear relationship with Ca2+. At voltages greater than 1500 V cm-1, penetration declined. Sperm from subfertile men demonstrated significantly increased penetration after electropermeabilization. Sperm development was not hindered and in the SCA, yields of sperm metaphases approaching 100% were achievable.\r"

A postal questionnaire on their respiratory morbidity was completed in September 1983 and again in September 1985 by 207 asthma patients. They then completed a postal questionnaire concerning their attitudes to asthma and level of family support. The findings revealed a marked degree of psychosocial morbidity among patients. Family support showed no significant associations with past or current levels of morbidity, or with changes in morbidity over the previous two years. In contrast, negative attitudes to asthma were correlated with significantly higher levels of morbidity, the strongest associations being found between patients' present attitudes and their most recent level of morbidity. These findings in conjunction with work carried out elsewhere suggest that high levels of asthma morbidity bring about a negative attitude to the condition which in turn contributes towards continuing morbidity.\r"

Differences between health care professionals who consent to participate in research and those who do not may distort the conclusions and prevent the results being generalizable. This is particularly likely when response rates are low, as they often are in studies evaluating primary health care. The present study outlines a method for examining this important area. Fifty-six general practitioners who consented to participate in an observational study of general practice were compared with 52 doctors who declined to participate in the research. Comparisons were made of general characteristics including age, sex, practice size and postgraduate qualifications, as well as attitudes toward their role. This last analysis was deemed particularly important, as the attitudes expressed may have affected the behaviour of the doctor in the consultation, and therefore outcomes such as accurate diagnosis, compliance and satisfaction. Such outcomes are often the object of study in quality of care research. The only significant difference to emerge in the present study was that non-consenters were more strongly in favour of a medical system based on free enterprise and fee for service (t83 = 2.3P less than 0.05). No systematic differences were found on other general characteristics or attitudes relating to patient care. Response bias using the stated variables was therefore considered to be minimal. The results are discussed in terms of strategies aimed at increasing response rates in quality of care research.\r"

The findings indicated that both patient groups think in a divergent and largely non-biomedical manner about their symptoms. Medical advisers were unlikely to explore lay ideas on cystitis or reinforce self-help measures. Clinicians would be well advised to take lay ideas into account and, where appropriate, to capitalize on them in negotiating management.\r"

Significantly more use was made of medical centres than hospital out-patient departments and general practice clinics and this was attributed to the easy accessibility of the medical centres. The time spent in waiting to see the health providers was also important and accounted for more use of the medical centres. Other factors found to be important included student-medical staff relationships and availability of essential drugs.\r"

The findings suggest that the way in which a general practitioner treats psychosocial problems depends partly on the type of problem and partly on his own attitude.\r"

Findings from these patients were compared with data from 10 asymptomatic healthy volunteers. Recordings were obtained for 1 h in the fasting state and 3 h after a standard 850-kcal meal. Transient relaxation of the LES was the only mechanism of acid reflux in normal subjects and accounted for 73.0% of the episodes of acid reflux in patients with GER disease. In both normal subjects and patients with GER, a large number of transient relaxations were associated at their onset with an attenuated submental EMG complex, a small pharyngeal contraction, and an esophageal contraction. The incidences of these associated events were similar in the two study populations. The frequency of transient relaxation of the LES in patients with GER was identical to that of controls. The frequency did not differ even in 9 patients with GER disease who had endoscopic esophagitis. Thirty-six percent of transient relaxations in the normal subjects were accompanied by pH evidence of reflux, but in the GER patients with endoscopic esophagitis 65% of the transient LES relaxations resulted in a reflux event. Acid reflux at the moment of deep inspiration was the second most common mechanism of GER in our patients. Four patients who demonstrated this mechanism had hiatal hernias and more severe esophagitis than the rest of the group. Our findings confirm that transient relaxation of the LES is the major mechanism of GER in patients with reflux esophagitis. However, the similar frequency of this relaxation in GER patients and in healthy asymptomatic subjects suggests that factors other than transient LES relaxation play an important role in the pathogenesis of GER disease.\r"

When Chinese and American duodenal ulcer patients were compared, the two ethnic groups had similar serum pepsinogen I and II concentrations and similar maximal acid outputs per kilogram body weight. In contrast, Chinese duodenal ulcer patients had significantly lower basal acid outputs per kilogram body weight than American duodenal ulcer patients. We conclude that acid-pepsinogen hypersecretion is present in the majority of American and oriental duodenal ulcer patients.\r"

Cryoulcers were produced in the corpus area and treated with 16,16-dimethyl prostaglandin E2 (5 or 100 micrograms/kg b.i.d., intragastrically), omeprazole (40 mumol/kg once daily, subcutaneously), indomethacin (2 mg/kg b.i.d., subcutaneously), or placebo. At the end of the treatment, plasma gastrin, cell labeling index (autoradiography with [3H]thymidine), and the size and depth of mucosal defects were measured. Compared with placebo, omeprazole accelerated ulcer healing as indicated by a smaller ulcer area [1.1 +/- 0.2 vs. 4.8 +/- 1.2 mm2 (mean +/- SEM)] and smaller ulcer depth (383 +/- 31 vs. 488 +/- 41 microns) after 10 days of treatment. Prostaglandins did not affect ulcer healing despite thickening of gastric corpus mucosa. Indomethacin delayed ulcer healing and reduced the labeling index. Omeprazole induced a marked hypergastrinemia (208 +/- 12 vs. 66 +/- 12 pmol/L on day 5, and 469 +/- 23 vs. 58 +/- 16 pmol/L on day 10). The results indicate that abolishment of acid secretion by omeprazole accelerates healing. Trophic actions and \"cytoprotective\" effects by prostaglandins are not relevant for ulcer healing in this model.\r"

  ".W": "In 16 consecutive patients with systemic mastocytosis, we prospectively evaluated a variety of gastrointestinal functions and examined how they relate to the occurrence of gastrointestinal symptoms. Nine patients had either a duodenal ulcer or duodenitis. Hypersecretion of gastric acid was present in 6 patients, and in these patients the mean basal acid output was 20.7 +/- 4.1 mEq/h (range 14-39 mEq/h). Impaired small intestinal absorption occurred in 5 patients, although this was usually mild. The mean fractional emptying rate of liquids for all patients (14.7% +/- 2.3% per minute) did not differ from that for controls (10.7% +/- 0.6% per minute). Mean mouth-to-cecum transit time measured by breath hydrogen testing was the same among patients (87.7 +/- 6.7 min) and controls (86.7 +/- 8.0 min). Plasma histamine concentrations were increased in all patients (mean 1886 pg/ml, range 480-7450) and correlated with the basal acid output (r = 0.64, p less than 0.02) but not maximal acid output or the presence or absence of pain or diarrhea. Mean fasting plasma concentrations of motilin, substance P, and neurotensin from 6 patients did not differ significantly from controls, whereas gastrin and vasoactive intestinal peptide were significantly less than in controls (p less than 0.01). Gastrointestinal symptoms, consisting of abdominal pain or diarrhea, occurred in 80% of patients. Abdominal pain classified as dyspeptic was usually associated with acid-peptic disease of the duodenum and hypersecretion of gastric acid, whereas abdominal pain of a nondyspeptic character was not. Only in those cases of diarrhea consisting of greater than 200 g stool/day was gastric acid hypersecretion frequently found. Neither fecal urgency nor nondyspeptic pain could be accounted for by alterations of gastrointestinal transit. These results demonstrate that gastrointestinal symptoms, peptic disease, and mild malabsorption are much more common than described previously in patients with systemic mastocytosis. Furthermore, the results provide no evidence for the contention that altered gastrointestinal transit is involved in the pathogenesis of these symptoms.\r"

  ".W": "Cancer prevention in patients with long-standing ulcerative colitis depends on the detection of epithelial dysplasia in colorectal biopsy specimens. Deoxyribonucleic acid analysis by flow cytometry has also been used to examine biopsy specimens, and might be a more quantitative method of detecting precancerous change. Histology and flow cytometry were used to analyze 333 paraffin blocks from colectomy specimens of 58 patients with extensive ulcerative colitis; 22 of these patients had developed carcinoma. Interobserver agreement between three experienced pathologists grading the sections was good for high-grade dysplasia and no dysplasia, but poor for low-grade and indefinite dysplasia. Deoxyribonucleic acid aneuploidy was easier to recognize than dysplasia and, as with dysplasia, it was found to be associated with patients who had developed carcinomas. The presence of deoxyribonucleic acid aneuploidy correlated with the presence of dysplasia. We believe that dysplasia is a useful marker of premalignant change and that flow cytometry may be useful as a complement to histologic examination when dysplasia is suspected.\r"

  ".W": "Twenty-five patients with functional bowel disease were given fructose, sorbitol, fructose-sorbitol mixtures, and sucrose. The occurrence of malabsorption was evaluated by means of hydrogen breath tests and the gastrointestinal symptoms, if any, were recorded. One patient could not be evaluated because of lack of H2 production. Based on a cut-off level of 10 ppm rise of H2 concentration, malabsorption was apparent in 13 patients, in 7 of which the calculated absorption capacities were below 15 g. In contrast, in patients given 50 g of sucrose, malabsorption could not be detected. Ingestion of fructose caused marked abdominal distress in patients with demonstrable malabsorption. Ingestion of sucrose in these patients gave less pronounced symptoms of abdominal distress. Malabsorption of a 5-g dose of sorbitol could be detected in 8 of 13 patients. Mixtures of 25 g of fructose and 5 g of sorbitol caused significantly increased abdominal distress, and more than additive malabsorption was found in several cases. The present study shows that pronounced gastrointestinal distress may be provoked by malabsorption of small amounts of fructose, sorbitol, and fructose-sorbitol mixtures in patients with functional bowel disease. The findings may have direct influence on the dietary guidance given to a major group of patients with functional bowel disease and may make it possible to define separate entities in this disease complex.\r"

We studied 72 IBS patients, 82 persons with IBS who had not sought medical treatment, and 84 normal subjects. All subjects received complete medical evaluation, diary card assessment of abdominal pain and stool habit, and standard psychologic tests of pain, personality, mood, stressful life events, illness behavior, and social support. Pain and diarrhea were the most important symptoms associated with patient status. When controlling for these symptoms we found that (a) IBS patients have a higher proportion of abnormal personality patterns, greater illness behaviors, and lower positive stressful life event scores than IBS nonpatients (p less than 0.001) and normals (p less than 0.001); (b) IBS nonpatients, although psychologically intermediate between patients and normals, are not different from normals (p less than 0.21); and (c) IBS nonpatients have higher coping capabilities, experience illness as less disruptive to life, and tend to exhibit less psychologic denial than patients. These factors may contribute to \"wellness behaviors\" among people with chronic bowel symptoms. We conclude that the psychologic factors previously attributed to the IBS are associated with patient status rather than to the disorder per se. These factors may interact with physiologic disturbances in the bowel to determine how the illness is experienced and acted upon.\r"

Two sets of diagnostic criteria were compared: restrictive criteria based on the work of Manning and conventional criteria (abdominal pain plus altered bowel habits). Lactose malabsorbers were included as a control group because they have medically explained bowel symptoms similar to those that define irritable bowel syndrome. Thus they control for the causative effects of chronic bowel symptoms on psychologic distress. Women who met restrictive criteria for irritable bowel syndrome but had not consulted a physician had no more symptoms of psychologic distress on the Hopkins Symptom Checklist than asymptomatic controls. However, medical clinic patients with both irritable bowel syndrome and lactose malabsorption had significantly more psychologic symptoms than asymptomatic controls or nonconsulters with the same diagnoses. Individuals who met only the conventional criteria for irritable bowel syndrome reported more psychologic distress than controls, whether or not they consulted a physician. These results suggest that (a) symptoms of psychologic distress are unrelated to irritable bowel syndrome but influence which patients consult a doctor and (b) conventional diagnostic criteria identify more psychologically distressed individuals than do restrictive criteria.\r"

Nausea, induced by intravenous infusion of apomorphine, was associated with fivefold to 75-fold increases in plasma vasopressin concentrations in 7 subjects (mean increase, 41-fold), with no change in plasma oxytocin levels. Furthermore, nausea was associated with sevenfold to 16-fold increases in plasma pancreatic polypeptide concentrations (mean increase, ninefold), with no change in plasma levels of vasoactive intestinal polypeptide or substance P. In 1 subject refractory to nausea, there was no increase in plasma vasopressin or pancreatic polypeptide concentrations with apomorphine. These studies indicate that nausea in humans is associated with vasopressin and pancreatic polypeptide release.\r"

We evaluated gallbladder filling and emptying with low-dose cholecystokinin infusion (0.02 U/kg.h) by computer-assisted cholescintigraphy in 52 controls versus 31 gallstone patients: 17 treated with 12-15 mg/kg.day of chenodeoxycholic acid and 14 with 8-10 mg/kg.day of ursodeoxycholic acid. Thirteen of 31 patients with complete dissolution had four scans: before, after 3 mo of therapy, after stone dissolution, and after discontinuation of bile acids. The 18 failures had three scans: before and after 3 and 15-18 mo of therapy. Before therapy, the 31 gallstone patients had significantly impaired gallbladder emptying compared with controls, but filling was not decreased. Bile acids significantly decreased emptying in both treatment groups after 3 mo of therapy. In the dissolution group, emptying improved once the stones had dissolved and increased further upon discontinuing the bile acids. In the failures, impaired emptying persisted for up to 15-18 mo. Gallbladder filling in the 31 gallstone patients was also significantly decreased after 3 mo of bile acid therapy, particularly in the failure patients, 5 of whom exhibited zero filling. No differences were detected between ursodeoxycholic acid and chenodeoxycholic acid for either gallbladder function or efficiency of dissolution. Thus, bile acid therapy impairs gallbladder filling and emptying in gallstone patients. Gallstone dissolution improves emptying, which is further enhanced when bile acids are discontinued.\r"

After infusion of 50 mg/min for 3 h, total and renal sorbitol clearances were calculated, and the extrarenal clearance was obtained by taking the difference between the two. In normal volunteers, the mean (+/- SD) extrarenal sorbitol clearance was 10.6 +/- 2.1 ml/min.kg. In patients with various liver diseases, it was correlated more closely to the fractional clearance of indocyanine green (r = 0.83, n = 57) than the galactose elimination capacity (r = 0.66, n = 55). Hepatic vein catheterization showed that the hepatic extraction of sorbitol was always much higher than the extraction of indocyanine green; there was no evidence for extrahepatic, extrarenal sorbitol elimination. On the basis of these findings, sorbitol is kinetically superior to indocyanine green and, although the noninvasively determined extrarenal sorbitol clearance at steady state may not be equal to total hepatic plasma flow, it may at least be regarded as a measure of parenchymal liver plasma flow.\r"

In comparison, five single tumors taken from rats transplanted with the rat pancreatic adenocarcinoma CA 20948 were found to contain specific high-affinity somatostatin receptors. Also, human endocrine pancreatic tumors, i.e., two insulinomas, did contain somatostatin receptors under identical experimental conditions. These data confirm previous results with other tumors, documenting the absence of somatostatin receptors in highly malignant human carcinomas. They also may represent an explantation at the molecular level for the lack of therapeutic effect of somatostatin analogues such as SMS 201-995 seen in patients with advanced exocrine pancreatic carcinomas.\r"

Using an in vivo rat model in which the acquisition of hepatic cholesterol from chylomicron remnants, low-density lipoproteins, and de novo synthesis was measured and kept constant, it was found that the amount of sterol recruited from the liver cell increased progressively as the liver was probed with a constant infusion of progressively more hydrophobic bile salts. The absolute secretion rate of both cholesterol and phospholipid increased nearly 50% as the hydrophobic index of the bile salts traversing the liver increased from 1.7 to 4.5, but the ratio of cholesterol to phospholipid secreted in bile remained nearly constant. Thus, when cholesterol entry into the hepatocyte via lipoproteins and de novo cholesterol synthesis is constant, the mass of cellular cholesterol recruited into the bile is directly proportional to the hydrophobic-hydrophilic balance of the secreted bile salts.\r"

  ".W": "The use of cyclosporin A in transplantation procedures has been reported to cause hepatotoxicity as evidenced by elevated serum bilirubin and bile salt levels. However, these biochemical abnormalities could also result from interference with hepatic transport processes. This possibility was investigated in the present study in which the effect of cyclosporin A on transport processes was examined in isolated rat liver cells. Taurocholate, ouabain, and alpha-aminoisobutyric acid were selected as compounds known to enter liver cells by distinct active transport systems and cadmium was selected as a substance taken up by a combination of simple and facilitated diffusion. Cyclosporin A was found to cause a dose-related inhibition of both taurocholate and ouabain uptake. On the other hand, the uptake of alpha-aminoisobutyric acid and of cadmium were unaffected by cyclosporin A. These findings indicate a substrate-specific effect of cyclosporin A rather than a general effect on cellular transport. Efflux of taurocholate from preloaded hepatocytes was also inhibited by cyclosporin A. Cyclosporin A caused a decrease in maximum velocity for ouabain uptake with no change in Km. Kinetic analysis for both uptake and efflux of taurocholate showed an unchanged maximum velocity and an increased Km. The data indicate that the ability of liver cells to take up and release bile acids is impaired in the presence of cyclosporin A. These findings provide a possible explanation for the finding of increased serum bile acids during cyclosporin A therapy and suggest that hepatic clearance of other compounds could also be impaired.\r"

Decreased serum levels of retinol (vitamin A) and 25-hydroxyvitamin D and elevated levels of abnormal prothrombin were common in these patients and correlated with the histologic stage of the disease and with the clinical severity of disease as judged by elevated serum bilirubin levels and decreased serum albumin levels. The increased levels of abnormal prothrombin were due primarily to vitamin K deficiency but also, in part, to the severity of the liver disease itself. Vitamin E deficiency was rare. Only 1 patient had clinical manifestations of fat-soluble vitamin deficiency, night blindness, and gastrointestinal bleeding related to a marked prolongation of the prothrombin time. Deficiencies of fat-soluble vitamins are most likely to be present in jaundiced patients with long-standing, severe cholestasis. We suggest that fat-soluble vitamin status be determined in all patients with primary biliary cirrhosis by appropriate blood tests and that vitamin supplements be given only to those patients who require them.\r"

Microtubules were identified with monoclonal antibodies to beta-tubulin and fluorescein iso-thiocyanate-labeled goat-antimouse antibody and were concentrated in the apical domain, a structural polarity that was eliminated by pretreatment with colchicine. In control cells, HRP immediately labeled vesicles and tubules in the submembrane regions of the periphery of the cell. Within 10 min tubules and vesicles were prominently labeled in pericanalicular regions, a process blocked by colchicine but not by lumicolchine or taurocholate administration. A quantitative morphometric analysis utilizing a Zeiss Videoplan-2 image analyzer established that (a) HRP-containing structures increased in density, area, length, and diameter in the pericanalicular region by 10 min; (b) colchicine, but not lumicolchicine, pretreatment diminished their density, area, and length; and (c) taurocholate (50 microM), a choleretic and biliary lipid-stimulating bile acid, had no effect on HRP density or percentage of area in the pericanalicular region, but decreased the diameter of the pericanalicular HRP-containing structures and increased the percentage of tubules containing HRP from 29% to 40%. Tubules were particularly prominent in thick sections (400 nm) in both peripheral and pericanalicular regions and were viewed as continuous anastomosing linear arrays in stereo-paired micrographs. These studies established that isolated rat hepatocyte couplets maintain a highly polarized tubulovesicular transcytotic pathway in short-term culture that is micro-tubule-dependent. Taurocholate stimulates the transformation of tubules from vesicles in this isolated rat hepatocyte couplet system.\r"

In contrast, the myenteric plexus had markedly fewer neurons than normal on the hematoxylin and eosin stains. Silver staining of the plexus revealed degeneration and decreased numbers of argyrophilic neurons, which were smaller and had fewer processes and a more uneven staining quality than controls. Many axons were fragmented, and increased numbers of glial cell nuclei were present in the plexus. Degenerative changes in the neurons were present in a patchy distribution on transmission electron microscopy. Immunohistochemistry revealed a decrease of the substance P- and enkephalin-immunoreactive fibers in the muscularis externa. This suggests that colonic motor dysfunction associated with myotonic dystrophy may be caused by a visceral neuropathy that involves the substance P- and enkephalin-immunoreactive fibers of the smooth muscle.\r"

The histologic workup revealed, in addition to ulcer necroses and granulation tissue, glands of the fundic type, with chief and parietal cells. On the basis of histologic results, the fistula was successfully occluded with the aid of a fibrin adhesive applied endoscopically. After the second session, the patient immediately became free of symptoms. Under medical treatment with an H2-receptor blocker, the patient has been completely symptom-free for 1 yr.\r"

  ".W": "The surgical indications in 770 patients with Crohn's disease undergoing intestinal resection at The Mount Sinai Hospital from 1960-83 have been reviewed. Surgical indications were divided into two principal categories: 375 cases with perforating indications and 395 cases non-perforating. Among 292 patients who underwent second operations for recurrent Crohn's disease, the indications for second operation were closely dependent on the indication for primary resection. Second operations were undertaken for perforating indications much more often among cases where the initial indication had been perforating, than among those whose initial indications had been non-perforating (73% v 29%, p less than 0.00001). This trend to similarities in the indications which bring patients to surgery was maintained within each anatomical category of Crohn's disease and even between second and third operations (p less than 0.001). Operations for perforating indications were followed by reoperation approximately twice as fast as operations for non-perforating indications, whether going from first to second operation (perforating 4.7 v non-perforating 8.8 years, p less than 0.001), or from second to third (perforating 2.3 v non-perforating 5.2 years, p less than 0.005). Crohn's disease thus seems to occur in two different clinical patterns, independent of anatomic distribution. These are a relatively aggressive perforating type and a more indolent non-perforating type, which tend to retain their identities between repeated operations and to influence the speed with which reoperation occurs.\r"

The rabbits that, in response to treatment, harboured Clostridium difficile in their colonic lumen were studied, and the results expressed according to the presence or absence of Clostridium difficile and/or its cytotoxin. Thus, we refer to either CD+ or CD- segments. The influx of glucose, phenylalanine, glycylphenylalanine, and lysine across the brush border of jejunum and ileum of CD+ segments was severely impaired, while only slightly blunted in CD-. No significant change was detected in the influx of glutamic acid in the jejunum of all treated animals and in the CD- ilea. Morphologic damage in ileum and caecum of CD+ was also more evident than in CD-. Transepithelial ion transport across short circuited ileal mucosa (CD+ and CD-) revealed secretory changes in Cl net transport that were more marked in CD-. We conclude that: (1) Clostridium difficile may also colonise the upper intestinal tract, where it induces morphological and functional damage, severely impairing nutrient absorption; and (2) the ileum contributes to the diarrhoea caused by CD even when the micro-organism is confined to the more distal gut by showing moderate impairment of nutrient absorption and marked electrolyte secretion.\r"

Despite a similar level of DNA aneuploidy in sporadic adenomas, it was commonly detected at a smaller polyp size. The degree of cell proliferation was found to be similar in the two groups (median %S+G2 15.8% v 16.4%) but larger FAP adenomas demonstrated a higher level of cell proliferation than smaller adenomas. DNA aneuploidy had no value as a predictor of a synchronous carcinoma and appeared to be an early change in the development of carcinoma in these patients.\r"

There was a slight preponderance of female producers over male (female producers 63%, males 57%) and an age trend with fewer producers in the older age groups in the urban blacks and Indians, these comparisons being significant when tested by stepwise logistic regression analysis. Bowel cancer risk, determined from a variety of sources, was lowest in rural blacks, greatest in whites, with intermediate rates for urban blacks and Indians.

Distension pressure was generated by a water column between two reservoirs. Volume was recorded as shifts of water between the reservoirs. Anal pressure was recorded with a cylindrical balloon and electromyographic activity of the external sphincter by means of a needle electrode. It could be shown that although reduction of preset pressure was minimal, this factor had to be taken into account when rectal compliance is high. The position of the patients during the investigation has to be defined, because rectal volume changed with body position. Pull through studies of anal pressure indicated low sensitivity to displacement of the cylindrical anal probe. A pressure adaptation to the anal probe during eight minutes was noted. Representative recordings of the anorectal response to different isobaric pressures are presented. The present system offers new possibilities for investigation of rectoanal physiology in man.\r"

Each drug was given for two weeks, the gastric contents aspirated over a timed period and the results assessed in unstimulated and pentagastrin stimulated secretions. The volume, dry weight and the carbohydrate contents of non-diffusable glycoconjugates, high molecular mass glycoproteins and glycopolypeptides were investigated. Both drugs reduced the volumes of stimulated secretions. This was statistically significant after cimetidine. More importantly neither drug affected the amount of non-diffusable glycoconjugates, so that the concentration remained the same or increased. Both drugs reduced the monosaccharide content of the high molecular mass fractions. This reached significance for the stimulated secretion after cimetidine. As the carbohydrate content of the glycopolypeptides was unchanged this indicated the presence of a non-mucin glycoprotein or protein. Overall there was no fundamental difference between the results for cimetidine and carbenoxolone.\r"

Patients whose gall stones recurred did not differ significantly from those who remained stone free with respect to age, sex, body weight, or time required for dissolution.\r"

  ".W": "During a multicentre study of chronic hepatitis in childhood diagnosed by biopsy, the spectrum of the disease has been evaluated in 196 consecutive patients, including 157 from Northern Italy and 39 from Southern Italy. Only 31% of patients in the former group and 27% in the latter were symptomatic when first seen: the majority of cases being seen after familial screenings for hepatitis B virus (HBV) markers or during intercurrent infections, thus suggesting that the frequency of chronic hepatitis in childhood might be largely underestimated in our area. In Southern and Northern Italy 83% of symptomatic and 95% of asymptomatic patients were hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) positive in serum; only 15 (8.3%) of these children were born to mothers known to be HBsAg positive at delivery, but a high circulation of HBV was found in their families: in fact more than 65% of household contacts in Northern Italy and more than 90% in Southern Italy had serological evidence of past or ongoing HBV infection. These data indicate that, although familial screenings for HBV could have enhanced the percentage of HBsAg positive asymptomatic cases, chronic hepatitis in Italian children is mainly caused by HBV infection acquired in the familial setting through horizontal transmission. Such findings also emphasise the importance of mass vaccination of infants as the most effective means to prevent chronic type B hepatitis in childhood in our area. Among HBsAg positive children 55% had histological features of chronic active hepatitis and 85% were hepatitis Be antigen (HBeAg) positive in serum.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

During three episodes described emergency admission to hospital and resuscitation with intravenous fluids was required. The cases illustrate the difficulty clinicians have in recognising drug induced effects which mimic the underlying disease. When a patient suspects a reaction to azathioprine we believe any rechallenge should only be undertaken in the controlled hospital environment.\r"

Secondary peristaltic and sphincteric responses were measured during intraluminal infusion of 0.1 N hydrochloric acid and equiosmolar saline solutions in seven normal volunteers. Responses to a single volume infused at varying sites in the oesophagus and to progressively increasing volumes of test solution were measured. In addition oesophageal responses to similar degrees of distension induced by inflation of an intraluminal balloon were also recorded. The sphincteric responses to both stimuli were similar, decreasing in value with distance from the sphincter from values of 70 (68-85) mmHg (median (range] for HCl; and 70 (55-85) mmHg for NaCl at 5 cm below the sphincter to 40 (30-60) mmHg for both HCl and NaCl at 20 cm. As the volume of the solution infused into the proximal oesophagus was increased, the sphincter pressure also rose from a median basal value of 30 (25-50) mmHg to 40 (30-50) mmHg for HCl and NaCl after 1 ml, while after 7 ml infusion, the responses were greater, 65 (45-85) mmHg for HCl, and 60 (45-80) mmHg for NaCl. In the more distal oesophagus, responses were qualitatively similar but quantitatively smaller than proximally, being 30 (25-40) mmHg for HCl and 30 (25-50) mmHg for NaCl following 1 ml and 45 (40-55) mmHg for HCl and NaCl after 7 ml.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The upright and recumbent periods of measurement showed different degrees of concordance: 83% and 62%, respectively. The reproducibility during time periods of different length was found to increase with increasing length of day time pH recording. A 16 hour period during evening and night had a reproducibility of only 58%, however. It is concluded that there is fairly good reproducibility when measuring gastro-oesophageal reflux over 24 hours, but that the reproducibility is poorer at night, during the postprandial period and when daytime monitoring is shorter than 10 hours.\r"

Intravenous ranitidine 50 mg was given at the end of the impromidine infusion on each study day; the antisecretory effect of intravenous ranitidine was accentuated after the treatment with ranitidine from a trough acid output of 8.5 (1.2) mmol/h before, to 3.8 (1.5) mmol/h (p less than 0.05) after, treatment. The increased response to the H2 agonist impromidine and the H2 antagonist ranitidine after treatment with ranitidine suggests an enhanced sensitivity of the H2 receptor. This might be explained on the basis of an increase in the number of H2 receptors ('up-regulation').\r"

In atrophic gastritis (AG) of antrum and body the prevalence of CP decreased significantly with an increasing degree of atrophy, so that CP was not found in severe body AG. Different combinations of antral and body gastritis revealed a characteristic pattern. Campylobacter pylori was lacking when antral and body mucosa were normal, but was present in 41% when normal mucosa was associated with gastritis in the opposite area. In SG affecting diffusely antrum and body, the bacterium was present in every case, but when SG was associated with AG in the opposite area it was lacking in 29% of the subjects. When SG affecting both areas was compared with SG accompanied by different degrees of AG in the body, there was a highly significant decrease of the prevalence of CP in antrum and body along with an increasing degree of AG in the body. This decrease showed a highly significant positive correlation with the acid output. On the whole, acid output correlated well with the occurrence of CP in both antrum and body. Thus the prevalence of CP was 10% in achlorhydria and rose up to 100% in cases with acid output above 30 mmol/h. The presence of CP did not correlate with signs of acute inflammation, but correlated significantly with those of chronic inflammation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Compared with controls, the ileal mucosal biopsies showed an increase of IgA and IgG in acute ileitis. In chronic ileitis there was an increase of IgA, IgG, and IgM similar to Crohn's disease. In colonic biopsies there was a significant increase of all immunoglobulin classes in acute inflammation. In chronic inflamed mucosa there was also an increase of all three Ig classes. The Ig distribution, however, was significantly different in acute and chronic colitis. These findings give immunohistochemical evidence of the existence of two different types of inflammation related to reactive arthritis or the peripheral joint involvement of ankylosing spondylitis. The Ig pattern in acute colitis is similar to that found in infectious colitis, suggesting an enterobacterial origin of the arthritis in this group of patients although bacteriological and serological investigations were negative. In the chronic type of arthritis related ileocolitis, the pattern of Ig containing cells is similar to that found in Crohn's disease but different from infectious and ulcerative colitis, which makes the hypothesis that a great number of these arthritis patients suffer from asymptomatic or subclinical Crohn's disease acceptable.\r"

The xanthine oxidase inhibitor allopurinol has been shown to attenuate pancreatic damage in canine and mouse models of acute pancreatitis presumably by preventing the generation of cytotoxic superoxide anions. We therefore examined whether allopurinol could attenuate pancreatic injury in conscious rats with caerulein induced acute pancreatitis. A continuous intravenous infusion of allopurinol (20 mg/kg/h) for six hours along with an acute pancreatitis producing dose of caerulein (10 micrograms/kg/h) reduced pancreas weights by approximately 45% and serum amylase concentrations by approximately 60% compared with rats intravenously infused with either caerulein alone or caerulein plus a lower dose (10 mg/kg/h) of allopurinol. We conclude that the generation of oxygen derived free radicals via pancreatic xanthine oxidase represents an early and perhaps pivotal mechanism in the pathogenesis of acute pancreatitis.\r"

  ".W": "We have previously shown that short chain fatty acids (SCFA) stimulate motility in the canine ileum. Concentrations of SCFA in the ileum are normally low but would be expected to increase after coloileal reflux; thus, this phenomenon could have pathophysiological relevance. The present studies were designed to seek pharmacological means by which this response could be blocked. Four dogs were prepared with isolated, ileocolonic fistulae into which physiological concentrations of SCFA could be instilled so as to stimulate ileal motility. Pretreatment of the ileum with topical lidocaine abolished the response to luminal SCFA but general anaesthesia did not. Indomethacin stimulated ileal motility and prostacyclin abolished the ileal response to SCFA. Naloxone and a calcium channel blocker also negated the response to SCFA; blockage of muscarinic, adrenergic and 5H-T receptors did not. We conclude that the motor response to SCFA is probably a local neural reflex which is sensitive to local anaesthetics, opiates and the prostanoids.\r"

No differences in sphincter pressures or the rectosphincteric reflex were demonstrable between the two groups. Rectal defecatory sensation was blunted and the compliance was increased in the constipated group. The latency of the pudendo-anal reflex was significantly prolonged in idiopathic constipation, two women having an absent reflex (greater than 100 ms). Mean motor unit potential duration of the external anal sphincter was not significantly prolonged in the eight constipated women tested.

In the ulcerative colitis group one of 16 monozygotic pairs was concordant for the disease, but all the other 20 pairs (dizygotic or unknown zygosity) were discordant. In the Crohn's disease group eight of 18 monozygotic pairs and one of 26 dizygotic pairs were concordant. The proband concordance rate among monozygotic twins was 6.3% for ulcerative colitis and 58.3% for Crohn's disease. The calculated heritability of liability based on monozygotic pairs was 0.53 and 1.0 respectively. Thus heredity as an aetiological factor is stronger in Crohn's disease than in ulcerative colitis. Monozygotic twins with Crohn's disease were more likely to be smokers than monozygotic twins with ulcerative colitis. Smoking did not explain the discordance of twin pairs with either ulcerative colitis, or Crohn's disease. The combination of identical heredity and similar smoking habit is not sufficient to cause disease.\r"

The mean of the labelling index of the three patients with familial polyposis coli was 8.35% (3.17), values expressed as means (SD) and that of the five patients with non-polyposis cancer, or adenomas was 8.55% (3.20). None of the eight patients showed derangement of the proliferative zone of colonic crypts. This result is compatible with the hypothesis that adenomas are detected first as 'buds of adenomas', which sprout into the lamina propria mucosae in the middle part of normal crypts.\r"

  ".W": "The circadian blood pressure rhythm was compared in patients with Cushing's syndrome, essential hypertension, and primary aldosteronism. In patients with essential hypertension or primary aldosteronism, a clear nocturnal fall in systolic and diastolic blood pressure and heart rate was observed. This fall was seen in untreated subjects as well as in patients receiving combined treatment with a calcium antagonist, diuretic, converting enzyme inhibitor, alpha-blocker and beta-blocker, or sympatholytic drug. In these groups, there was a positive correlation between heart rate and systolic or diastolic blood pressure. On the other hand, in patients with Cushing's syndrome, there was no nocturnal fall in blood pressure but in some patients a rise was observed. In all patients there was a nocturnal fall in heart rate. Thus, there was no significant correlation between heart rate and blood pressure in these patients. Exogenous glucocorticoid eliminated the normal nocturnal fall of blood pressure in patients with chronic glomerulonephritis or systemic lupus erythematosus. These results suggest that the changed circadian blood pressure pattern in patients with Cushing's syndrome is not due to antihypertensive treatment or to the mineralocorticoid excess accompanying this disease, but it is attributable to excess glucocorticoid or the associated disturbance in the adrenocorticotropic hormone-glucocorticoid system (or both). This conclusion also implies that the normal circadian rhythm of blood pressure may be regulated at least in part by the adrenocorticotropic hormone-glucocorticoid system.\r"

In this study, we examined the relationship between vascular thromboxane A2 generation and vascular smooth muscle cell growth in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). Vascular thromboxane A2 generation was significantly enhanced by 49% in 5-week-old and by 117% in 15-week-old SHR as compared with age-matched Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY). Thromboxane A2 generation was also significantly enhanced by 59% in the cultured vascular smooth muscle cells of SHR when compared with production in WKY. Vascular smooth muscle cells of SHR exhibited a significantly shortened doubling time (by 32%) and greater [3H]thymidine uptake (by 56%), as compared with those of WKY. OKY 046 (10(-5) M), a thromboxane synthase inhibitor, significantly tempered the rapid vascular smooth muscle cell growth in SHR by 9% for doubling time and by 10% for [3H]thymidine uptake. OKY 046 did not influence the doubling time of WKY. Conversely, a stable analogue of thromboxane A2 dose-dependently stimulated the [3H]thymidine uptake by vascular smooth muscle cells of WKY, and, at a concentration of 10(-5) M, shortened the doubling time of vascular smooth muscle cells of WKY by 11%, whereas it showed slight effects on SHR. These data indicate that vascular thromboxane A2 is involved in the regulatory mechanism of vascular smooth muscle cell growth and that enhanced vascular thromboxane A2 generation is partly responsible for the rapid proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells of SHR. The alterations of vascular thromboxane production may be a key trait for genetic hypertension.\r"

  ".W": "Previously we reported that immunoreactive angiotensin II (Ang II) release from isolated perfused rat mesenteric arteries was mediated by beta-adrenergic receptor activation. However, the precise mechanism of regulation of vascular renin-angiotensin is not completely understood. In this study, we examined the effect of indomethacin and meclofenamate on immunoreactive angiotensin I (Ang I) and immunoreactive Ang II release from perfused rat hind leg vasculature to delineate the possible relevance of prostaglandins to the vascular renin-angiotensin system in vitro. We also examined the effects of isoproterenol and propranolol on the immunoreactive Ang I and II release. Isolated rat hind legs were perfused with Krebs-Ringer solution, and immunoreactive Ang I and II released into the perfusate were measured directly by using a Sep-Pak C18 cartridge connected to the perfusion system. Indomethacin and meclofenamate (10(-8) to 2 X 10(-6) M) added to the perfusion medium suppressed immunoreactive Ang I and II release to similar extents in a dose-dependent manner (p less than 0.001); the maximal percent inhibition of immunoreactive Ang II release evoked by these inhibitors (2 X 10(-6) M) was 60 +/- 6% (p less than 0.001) for indomethacin and 50 +/- 4% (p less than 0.001) for meclofenamate. Isoproterenol (10(-6) M) failed to cause a change in the release of both peptides, but propranolol (10(-6) M) slightly decreased the release of immunoreactive Ang I and II by 28 +/- 4% (p less than 0.001) and 32 +/- 4% (p less than 0.001), respectively. There was a highly significant positive correlation between the released amount of immunoreactive Ang I and that of immunoreactive Ang II altered by indomethacin (r = 0.91), meclofenamate (r = 0.94), or propranolol administration (r = 0.90). These results suggest that the renin-angiotensin in the hind legs is modulated by prostaglandins and that a difference exists in the beta-adrenergic receptor-mediated release of Ang II among diverse vascular beds.\r"

Arterioles and venules with diameters averaging from 70 to 90 microns, the size range contributing most to peripheral vascular resistance, were measured daily for 6 days to determine differences in diameter, tortuosity, and number of branches. Hydralazine was given as a subcutaneous pellet (2.5 mg), with a release life of 21 days. Hydralazine caused a 39% dilation in arterioles of Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY) at 3 hours but only an 8% dilation in those of spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). At 6 hours, arterioles in both groups were similarly dilated (30-33%). Beyond 6 hours, both SHR and WKY arterioles returned to their prehydralazine control diameter, even though arterial pressure was still reduced. By Day 6, in WKY, but not SHR, there was an increase in the tortuosity of arterioles and a tendency for an increase in their number. Venous diameter was also increased on Day 6, consistent with the fluid retention effect of hydralazine. These data indicate that some so-called vasodilators may cause long-term alterations in growth of vessels rather than an increase in vessel caliber.\r"

  ".W": "Renal sympathetic antidiuretic, antinatriuretic, and vasoconstrictor responses are mediated by alpha 1-adrenergic receptors in the normal rat. Since the renal nerve has been implicated in the pathogenesis of rat genetic hypertension, we investigated renal alpha 1-adrenergic receptor coupling to phosphoinositide turnover in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY). In cortical slices from adult (13-week-old) SHR and WKY, stimulation with norepinephrine (10(-7)-10(-3) M) caused a concentration-dependent increase in accumulation of [3H]inositol phosphates. However, dose-response curves for SHR characteristically displayed a depression of the maximum response as compared with those for WKY. Baseline accumulation of [3H]inositol phosphates was not different between strains (39.4 +/- 2.2 cpm/mg tissue/hr for WKY and 34.4 +/- 2.1 cpm/mg tissue/hr for SHR slices; n = 5 rats/group, determined in triplicate). Antagonist competition studies revealed that norepinephrine-stimulated (10(-4) M) [3H]inositol phosphate accumulation was mediated by alpha 1-adrenergic receptors (IC50) for prazosin: 65 +/- 11 nM for SHR and 64 +/- 5 nM for WKY). The reduction in norepinephrine-stimulated [3H]inositol phosphate accumulation in SHR cortex was not the result of the hypertension, since it was also present in cortical slices from young (4-week-old) SHR in which the blood pressure was not yet significantly different from that in WKY and since [3H]inositol phosphate accumulation was unchanged from control values in rats made hypertensive by treatment with deoxycorticosterone acetate. Scatchard analysis of [3H]prazosin binding in renal cortical membranes of young and adult SHR and WKY revealed no significant differences in alpha 1-adrenergic receptor density or affinity between strains at either age. Our results suggest that renal alpha 1-adrenergic receptor coupling to phospholipase C is less efficient in SHR than in WKY. This impaired response is not the result of hypertension or changes in receptor density; this defect may play a role in increased renal sympathetic nerve activity and in the development or maintenance of hypertension in SHR.\r"

  ".W": "In accordance with the sunlight hypothesis for its etiology, the incidence of malignant melanoma generally increases with increasing proximity to the equator. There are exceptions to this pattern, prominent among which is the tendency for incidence to increase with increasing distance from the equator beyond latitude 50 degrees north in Europe. This anomaly is probably explicable in terms of climatic factors, geographic variation in skin pigmentation, and the sun-seeking behavior of those in the north. The incidence of malignant melanoma is increasing at about 5% a year in most white populations, while there is no consistent tendency for it to increase in black populations. This difference suggests that the increase is due to increasing sun exposure. Evidence from recent case-control studies is consistent with both intermittent intense exposure and total accumulated exposure to the sun causing an increase in risk of malignant melanoma. Reconciliation of these two different patterns of effect of sun exposure may lie in more careful measurement of sun exposure and analysis of exposure specific to the site at which each melanoma is observed to occur.\r"

Behaviors were assessed in the following categories: cigarette smoking, alcohol/drugs, eating habits, exercise/fitness, stress management, and safety. Only 100 (20.6%) of the total indicated that they were currently smokers. Neither the alcohol/drugs nor the safety categories appeared to be problem areas, with no significance noted. Categories indicating a need for improvement were exercise/fitness, eating habits, and stress management. Faculty members were interested in and willing to participate in a wellness program. Preferred areas of interest in rank order were (1) exercise/fitness, (2) stress management, and (3) nutrition. Results of this study indicate that faculty in a major university are interested in wellness and will participate in a wellness program. Need and interest suggest that an exercise/fitness program should be instituted first, with stress management and nutrition components added as funds become available. A successful wellness program in a university setting has implications for happier, more productive employees, reduced absenteeism, and lower health insurance premiums.\r"

This relationship is important because of changing demographic patterns in the U.S. that are contributing to present and future foodservice labor shortages. The labor shortage has potential for retarding the long-term growth of the foodservice industry. However, recruitment and retention of older workers could be a factor in controlling the problem. Therefore, the major purpose of this research was to obtain information from current older foodservice employees to permit the determination of how various aspects of their jobs affect job satisfaction and organizational commitment and, thus, intention to remain on the job by delaying retirement. Non-management-level hospital and college/university foodservice workers aged 55 years and older (no. = 243) were surveyed. Hospital employees were selected from corporate rosters provided by a major contract foodservice company. College and university employees were selected from the roster of the National Association of College and University Food Services (NACUFS). No statistically meaningful relationship (r greater than or equal to .30) between work satisfaction (measured by the Minnesota Satisfaction Questionnaire) and organizational commitment (measured by the Organizational Commitment Questionnaire), as correlated with retirement intention, was found. Although not considered meaningful, a slight statistical relationship was found (r = .15, p less than .02) between intrinsic satisfaction and the desire to delay retirement (work intention).\r"

Specific binding of LPS to the 80-kDa protein is directly proportional to LPS concentration at low concentrations of LPS and is saturable at high concentrations of LPS. Binding is inhibited by both homologous and heterologous underivatized LPS as well as by polysaccharide-free lipid A, indicating a specificity for the biologically active component of LPS. Analysis of the kinetics of binding indicate a time-dependent increase over the first 15 min, but increases are not detected after this time. Binding of LPS to the 80-kDa LPS-binding protein is reduced but still readily detectable at 4 degrees C in the presence of azide. The presence of the 80-kDa LPS-binding protein in an isolated cytoplasmic membrane fraction of murine splenocytes as well as its release from intact splenocytes by octylglucoside suggest that this LPS-binding protein is membrane localized. The results are consistent with, but do not establish unequivocally, the identity of the 80-kDa LPS-binding protein as a specific membrane receptor for lipid A.\r"

The target cells were K562, MOLT-4, Raji, and fresh uncultured autologous endometrial carcinoma cells. Antibodies against adhesion relevant epitopes of CD11a(TA-1/LFA-1), CD11b(Mol/OKM1/Mac1), or CD11c (Leu-M5) did not inhibit NK function. The mAb 60.3 against CD18, the common beta-chain associated to CD11a-c, strongly inhibited both the binding and cytotoxicity of large granular lymphocytes (LGL) against all the target cells tested. Also the antibody LB-2 against the GP84 adhesion molecule inhibited NK function to some degree. 60.3 and LB-2 antibodies exerted an additive effect in the inhibition of both binding and cytotoxicity. However, even this antibody combination did not completely block NK activity, suggesting a heterogeneity of adhesion structures in the NK system. According to both FACS analyses and immunoprecipitation studies, all the tested antibodies recognized either a subpopulation or all of LGL. On the other hand, antibodies against CD11b, CD11c, and LB-2 showed only marginal reactivity with highly purified LGL-free T cells.\r"

  ".W": "A single i.v. injection of a mAb 5-1-6 to rats was found to cause massive though transient proteinuria. This mAb 5-1-6, IgG1 was produced by immunization of BALB/c mice with collagenase-treated Wistar rat glomeruli and was highly organ and species specific. Immunoelectron microscopy using immunoperoxidase with the avidin-biotin complex and immunogold staining indicated mAb 5-1-6 to bind in vitro to the surface of glomerular epithelial foot processes, mainly to slit diaphragms. The recognized antigenic molecule was not susceptible to neuraminidase treatment and its Mr was about 51 kDa by immunoprecipitation. A one-shot i.v. injection of this mAb induced proteinuria in rats starting immediately, reaching the peak on day 8 (mean value of 150 mg/24 h), then gradually decreasing to normal level on day 18. The in vivo localization of administrated mAb 5-1-6 changed with time. Linear binding along glomerular capillary walls was observed 2 h after injection. However, 3 days later, it partially shifted to a fine granular pattern. The linear pattern disappeared and the size as well as intensity of the fluorescent granules decreased on day 12 to trace positive on day 18. Immunoelectron microscopy revealed the binding pattern of in vivo injected mAb 5-1-6 after 2 h to be similar to that in vitro. Three days later, injected mAb was observed within multivesicular bodies in glomerular epithelial cells as well as along the surface of foot processes and around slit diaphragms. Twelve days after injection, mAb along the surface of the foot processes and around slit diaphragms decreased but those in multivesicular bodies were observed more frequently. Rat IgG and C3 could not be detected throughout the period of observation. No histologic abnormalities were noted except for partial retraction of epithelial foot processes at the peak of proteinuria on day 8. This mAb thus provides a valuable means for examining the mechanism of proteinuria.\r"

Earlier work showed that MAM is synthesized as monomeric precursor glycopeptides that assemble to form the heterodimer. The heterodimer and monomer glycopeptides are characterized through the use of twelve mAb in immunoprecipitation, immunoblotting, binding assays, and a quantitative cell adhesion assay. Seven topographic regions are identified, two of which are shown to be critical for adhesion. One adhesion-related topographic region, the M2/M4 region, is on the alpha-subunit, and the other, the M8/M15 region, is on the beta-subunit. Both adhesion-related epitopic regions are not detectable on monomeric glycopeptides but are generated by conformational change on heterodimer formation. It is hypothesized that these structure-function relationships have general applicability to integrin molecules.\r"

The hemolytic activity of purified human C2 and of C2 in normal human serum was inhibited by the mAb. The rate of decay of the C3-convertase at 30 degrees C was not affected by the mAb. C2 binding to EAC4b was inhibited by intact IgG and the Fab fragment of the mAb; 50% inhibition required 1 microgram/ml of either. The data suggest the presence of a C4b-binding site on the C2b domain of C2 and that the mAb recognizes an epitope at, or adjacent to, this site. The C2b portion of the C2 molecule may be important in assembly of the classical pathway C3-convertase.\r"

MOPC-315, an IgA-secreting plasmacytoma line, has been extensively used in studies of the regulation of IgA synthesis. In this report we show that the neuropeptide somatostatin (SOM) inhibits proliferation ([3H]thymidine uptake) of MOPC-315 and also inhibits IgA synthesis in vitro. MOPC-315 cells bind both fluorescent SOM and [125I]SOM specifically. On cytofluorimetric analysis, 68 +/- 6.8% (mean +/- SE, n = 7) of MOPC 315 cells labeled with fluorescent SOM and this staining was compatible by incubation with an excess of unlabeled peptide. Specific [125I]SOM binding increased linearly with cell concentration, was rapid and achieved equilibrium after 20 min at 4 degrees C. It was temperature-dependent, readily reversible, and under equilibrium conditions demonstrated a dissociation constant of 1.6 +/- 0.7 nM (mean +/- SE, n = 5). Scatchard analysis showed that MOPC-315 cells had 40,733 +/- 16,050 (mean +/- SE) binding sites for SOM per cell. The characteristics of the interactions of SOM with MOPC-315 cells suggest a specific receptor-mediated mechanism whereby this neuropeptide may modulate lymphocyte function.\r"

  ".W": "The synthesis and release of paf-acether by fibroblasts from normal human skin was investigated in vitro. When fibroblasts in suspension (1 X 10(6) cells) were stimulated with 2 microM Ca1+ ionophore A23187 (Io), they synthesized a material that aggregated aspirin-treated washed rabbit platelets and was identified as paf because 1) the platelet aggregation it induced was inhibited by BN 52021, an antagonist of paf putative receptors; 2) the factor was inactivated by phospholipase A2 but was insensitive to lipase from Rhizopus arrhizus; 3) it exhibited the same retention time as synthetic paf during standard and reverse phase HPLC elution. Paf production by fibroblasts occurred as soon as the first min of Io stimulation (287 +/- 92 pg/1 X 10(6) cells), reached a maximum at 5 min (369 +/- 85 pg/1 X 10(6) cells) and decreased thereafter. Half of the fibroblast-produced paf was recovered in supernatants. Addition of exogenous 1-O-alkyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (lyso-paf) at 0.1 microM and/or acetyl-coenzyme A at 0.1 mM to fibroblasts during Io stimulation enhanced paf production by two- and three-fold, respectively. The paf precursors, i.e., 1-O-alkyl-2-acyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (1-alkyl-2-acyl-GPC) and lyso-paf, were detected in fibroblasts either stimulated with Io or not. These precursors exhibited 80% hexadecyl and 20% octadecyl chains at the sn-1 position of the molecules, as determined by reverse phase HPLC and gas chromatography analysis. The present results are the first to demonstrate the synthesis and release of paf by fibroblasts from normal human skin. Such production within the dermis might account for the development of cutaneous inflammation and for the pathogenesis of many skin disorders.\r"

However, a significant period of survival is obtained when Nu/Nu rats are passively transferred with sera from 28-day infected Fischer +/+ (euthymic) animals. Specific IgE are involved since IgE-depleted sera are unable to afford such a protection. Only excreted/secreted Ag or living tachyzoites are able to induce a significant protective IgE response in intact animals. In addition, platelets or, to a lesser extent, eosinophil-rich populations from Toxoplasma infected or excreted-secreted Ag-immunized euthymic animals bear surface IgE and are cytotoxic for the parasite in vitro. Also, adoptive transfer of immune platelets confers a significant degree of protection to Toxoplasma-infected Nu/Nu animals. Our results clearly show the key role of Ag present in both living parasites and excreted-secreted Ag to induce, in this model, a protective IgE response. In addition, as in other parasitic infections, platelets and probably eosinophils are the effector cells involved in controlling parasitic dissemination during Toxoplasma infection in immunocompromised rats.\r"

The goal of the present study was to identify an encephalitogenic determinant of this protein. For this purpose, SWR mice were immunized with five groups of pooled synthetic peptides corresponding to various regions of the myelin proteolipid protein sequence. Clinical EAE was observed in only one group. Inguinal lymph node cells from animals in this group responded ([3H]thymidine incorporation) to a peptide within the pool containing residues 103-116 YKTTICGKGLSATV. Mice subsequently immunized with 50 nmol of this peptide developed severe EAE within 3 wk, and their T cell-enriched inguinal lymph node cells responded specifically to this peptide. Control mice immunized to proteolipid peptide 202-217 DARMYGVLPWNAFPGK did not develop experimental allergic encephalomyelitis, and their inguinal lymph node cells were unresponsive to either peptide. Thus, a peptide corresponding to a sequence within the proteolipid protein can produce classical acute experimental allergic encephalomyelitis. This is the first report of a synthetic encephalitogenic peptide from myelin proteolipid protein.\r"

These cells have been found to express autoantigens accessible to circulating antibodies. Mice immunized with syngeneic testis with or without bacterial adjuvant had detectable IgG on cells at the periphery of seminiferous tubules. Sera from orchiectomized but not from testes-intact mice immunized with testis and adjuvants readily transferred similar IgG deposits to testes of normal recipients. When testis-specific antisera from orchiectomized mice and testis-intact mice were compared for their reactivity on prepuberal testicular cells, serum from orchiectomized donors had significantly higher reactivity. Ig was eluted from IgG-positive testes with acid buffer and was shown to be highly enriched in antibody to prepuberal testicular cells, confirming the Ag-specific nature of the IgG deposits. The testis IgG deposits reacted with antisera to IgG1 and IgG3 but not IgG2a or IgG2b. This finding can explain lack of association of C3 in the deposits. Only 30 to 40% of seminiferous tubules had IgG deposits and they coincided with stages 7 to 12 of the spermatogenic cycle. Thus, the expression of the autoantigens is stage specific. The in situ formation of immune complexes by circulating autoantibodies demonstrates conclusively that testis autoantigens are not completely sequestered, and the blood-testis barrier as an immunologic barrier is incomplete.\r"

The induction of the 80,000- and 56,000-Da proteins after TNF treatment is dependent on the synthesis of an intermediary protein, whereas the induction of the 67,000-Da protein appears to occur as a direct result of the TNF treatment. The effects of antibodies to IFN on the TNF-mediated effects have been evaluated and reveal that the incubation of TNF-treated cells with antibody to rIFN-beta 1 greatly reduces the antiviral effectiveness of the TNF treatment and blocks the ability of TNF to induce the 80,000-Da protein. Incubation with antibodies to either IFN-alpha or IFN-gamma failed to affect the TNF-mediated responses. Thus, the induction by TNF of each of the proteins is regulated differently and is mediated through both IFN-dependent and IFN-independent mechanisms.\r"

The predominant FAF activity in unpurified supernatants from U-937 cells was associated with one protein of 16 to 18 kDa, as assessed by SDS-PAGE and pI 4 to 5, as determined by IEF in gel. Isolation of the FAF in 15-liter batches of supernatant from cultures of 1.5 x 10(10) PMA-stimulated U-937 cells by ammonium sulfate precipitation and sequential filtration on Sephadex G-50, anion exchange chromatography, and reversed phase HPLC yielded microgram quantities of a homogeneous protein of sufficient purity for structural studies. Purified FAF was not absorbed by affinity columns bearing antisera to IL-1 beta, TNF or basic fibroblast growth factor die not share any tryptic peptides with IL-1 alpha or acidic fibroblast growth factor when analyzed by two-dimensional electrophoresis/chromatography on cellulose thin-layer plates, and has an amino-terminal sequence of amino acids that is different from any known fibroblast growth factor.

At low concentrations, the most efficacious co-polymer, T130R2, caused rapid and extensive concentration-dependent release of histamine from mouse mast cells. The release process was not cytotoxic; it required metabolic energy and was not accompanied by release of lactate dehydrogenase. Optimal release of histamine was dependent on both calcium and sodium ions in the extracellular medium. The degree of in vitro histamine release correlated with in vivo inflammation and in vitro ionophore activity. We believe that this represents the first report of the activation of mediator-containing cells by an ionophore selective for monovalent cations. These copolymers may therefore represent new reagents for investigations of cellular excitation.\r"

  ".W": "Activated macrophages inhibit replication of murine lymphoblastic leukemia L1210 cells without lysis. This inhibition of replication is associated with abnormalities of mitochondrial electron transport at the level of NADH dehydrogenase (NADH-DH) and succinate dehydrogenase (SDH). The mechanism of inhibition is unknown, although it has been demonstrated that as NADH-DH and SDH activity is lost, iron is released from cells. Because both NADH-DH and SDH contain numerous iron-sulfur clusters, damage to these structures may be one result of injury by activated macrophages. L1210 cells were labeled with 55Fe and co-cultivated with activated murine peritoneal macrophages (injured L1210 cells). At 48 h, injured L1210 cells had released 83 +/- 8% (mean +/- SEM of 55Fe activity into the media, compared with 25 +/- 4% release from control and 37 +/- 7% from nondividing mitomycin C-treated control cells. All cells were greater than 90% viable. These differences were also reflected in the iron content of the cells. Mitochondria were then separated by centrifugation after cell disruption and 55Fe activity was found to be similarly decreased in both mitochondrial and nonmitochondrial fractions of injured L1210 cells. To further characterize the changes in mitochondrial iron content, mitochondrial proteins from injured and control L1210 cells were separated by IEF and 55Fe activity of gel slices was determined. There was selective loss of 55Fe activity in the area of the gel corresponding to SDH and NADH-DH, suggesting that iron loss from iron-sulfur clusters may occur in L1210 cells injured by activated macrophages. Iron uptake into L1210 cells after removal from macrophages showed a rapid large influx of radioactive iron. L1210 cells in contact with macrophages appear to develop an iron-depleted state, which is dependent on the continued presence of macrophages.\r"

  ".W": "Trypanosoma musculi established extracellular infections in aged BC3F1 and C57BL/6 mice that were approximately 10 times greater and twice as long in duration as those in young adult mice. Elimination of T. musculi infections was found to be an antibody-dependent, cell-mediated process involving effector (presumably phagocytic) cells in the liver and, to a lesser extent, the spleen. A major difference between young and aged mice of the C57BL/6 strain was the deficiency in the ability of aged animals to generate antibodies of appropriate specificity and/or isotype in sufficient amount to promote trypanosome elimination. Indeed, at the time when infected young-adult mice began to produce antibodies that facilitated rapid trypanosome clearance (in young adult, but not in aged animals), the serum of aged mice was found to contain substances that inhibited parasite clearance. Overall, however, the development of antibodies of different isotypes, capable of reacting with intact trypanosomes, was about the same in young and aged animals. Hepatic and splenic effector cells of old mice were at least as efficient as those of young adults. The immunoblotting procedure was used to try to detect trypanosome Ag against which aged animals failed to generate antibodies of one or more isotypes. The complexity of the reactions of infected mouse serum antibodies with the spectrum of trypanosome Ag precluded a precise analysis. However, it was apparent that a delay in the appearance of antibodies of IgG2a and IgG2b isotypes, against Ag of relatively high m.w., was typical of aged, in comparison to young, mice. More exacting analyses, involving fractionated trypanosome extracts and mAb of varying isotypes, are underway to identify key trypanosome Ag that elicit antibodies of isotypes that can facilitate hepatic and splenic clearance of the parasites. This line of investigation will provide information that, in addition to its intrinsic interest, may be vital in judging the future impact of endemic parasitic infections on the emerging cohort of elderly persons in developing tropical nations.\r"

  ".W": "A low m.w. polymorphic glyco-inositol-phospholipid (GIPL) of Leishmania major was studied by using three different mAb. This molecule is shown to be distinct from the previously described lipophosphoglycan of L. major in its m.w., antigenic properties, expression during parasite growth, and kinetics of synthesis and catabolism. GIPL is shown to be released from the parasite surface in a water-soluble form, probably by an endogenous phospholipase. GIPL is also detectable on the surface of infected macrophages, although not all epitopes are detectable in this state. GIPL can be metabolically labeled with [3H]galactose, [3H]inositol, [32P]phosphate, and [3H]palmitic acid. GIPL can also be labeled on the surface of living promastigotes with galactose oxidase and [3H]sodium borohydride. The kinetics of synthesis and catabolism are much faster than those of lipophosphoglycan. GIPL is sensitive to degradation upon parasite lysis and becomes undetectable by mAb after 20 h at 37 degrees C. The expression of GIPL on the surface of promastigotes is more abundant during the logarithmic phase of growth, and declines in stationary phase.\r"

In addition, a number of chemicals have been shown to promote and/or enhance UVR induced carcinogenesis. This study examined the effect of BPO on UVR initiated tumor formation. One hundred and forty-eight Uscd mice received 270 mJ/cm2 of UVB radiation to the posterior halves of their backs 3 times a week for 8 weeks. Four weeks later the mice were divided into 4 groups. Group I received croton oil in acetone applications to the back 5 times a week for the duration of the study. Group II received acetone, Group III received the BPO diluent, and Group IV received the BPO in an aqueous diluent applications as in Group I. One mouse in Group II (acetone) and one in Group IV (BPO) developed tumors in unirradiated skin. In the UVR initiated skin 38% of the survivors developed tumors in Group I (croton oil), whereas 5% did in Group II (acetone), 8% in Group III (BPO base), and 8% group IV (BPO). Thus under the circumstances of this study croton oil did promote UV initiated tumor formation but BPO did not. These results are consistent with those recently reported by Iversen.\r"

Cutaneous blood flow was monitored by laser Doppler velocimetry. Pretreatment with 4-methylpyrazole, a specific inhibitor of alcohol dehydrogenase, led to a significant decrease in the cutaneous vascular response to the alcohols as a group, but did not lead to changes in the cutaneous vascular response to the aldehydes as a group. Among the individual alcohols, pretreatment with 4-methylpyrazole reduced the response significantly to all concentrations of 1-propanol and 1-butanol. The means of the vascular response to the different concentrations of ethanol decreased, but not significantly. Additionally, 4-methylpyrazole did not have an independent effect on cutaneous blood flow. These results are consistent with the view that the cutaneous vascular reaction to primary alcohols applied topically to the skin of Orientals is provoked, in large part, by the corresponding aldehyde.\r"

For tumors occurring at least 58 months after first treatment, after adjustment for age, sex, and area of residence, we observed that patients with more than 260 treatments had an 11-fold increase in risk compared to patients who had received 160 or fewer treatments during the same interval (P less than 0.01). Comparable increases in relative risk were noted in patients of all skin types, irrespective of prior ionizing radiation exposure. We also noted a modest dose-dependent increase in the risk for the development of basal cell carcinoma for patients who received an excess of 200 treatments compared to those who had received fewer than 160 treatments within the same time period (P less than 0.05). Tumors detected in our cohort exhibit biologic behavior similar to non-melanoma skin cancers associated with sun exposure. Careful monitoring and early detection should limit the morbidity associated with these tumors.\r"

  ".U": "88285839\r", 
  ".W": "Cyclosporin A, which is a specific immunosuppressive compound, has recently been demonstrated to be of significant benefit in the treatment of psoriasis. Because hyperplasia is a major feature of psoriasis, we have investigated whether this drug acts directly to inhibit keratinocyte growth. We have determined the concentration range of cyclosporin in the epidermis of psoriatic patients undergoing cyclosporin therapy and the effect of this concentration range on the growth of cultured keratinocytes. After 7 days of treatment, psoriatic involved epidermis contained 1.1 +/- 0.3 ng cyclosporin/micrograms DNA. Based on tissue wet weight this is approximately 2.8 micrograms cyclosporin/ml. This value was 10 times that of trough blood samples. On day 3 of treatment, involved epidermis contained 7 times more cyclosporin than scale, while on day 7 this ratio was reduced to 2. This suggests that cyclosporin was initially associated with the lower layers of the epidermis and distributed upward with time. Exposure of adult human keratinocytes, cultured on collagen in the presence of human serum, to cyclosporin (0.1-30 micrograms/ml, 0.4-13-fold higher than lesional cyclosporin) for 2-6 d had no effect on the rate of incorporation of thymidine into DNA. Cyclosporin (1-30 micrograms/ml) also had not effect on the reinitiation of DNA synthesis of quiescent cells subsequent to the reintroduction of serum. In contrast, cyclosporin (1-10 micrograms/ml) inhibited growth of keratinocytes cultured on plastic culture dishes in serum free media (MCDB 153). For a given dose of cyclosporin, cell associated drug was 2-3 times greater in serum free compared to serum containing media. This may contribute in part to the sensitivity of keratinocytes in serum free media to growth inhibition by cyclosporin. These data demonstrate that human epidermis contains a high concentration of cyclosporin after oral administration, and that, under certain conditions, concentrations of cyclosporin within the range found in vivo can inhibit growth of cultured keratinocytes. Because cyclosporin regulates lymphocyte function in vivo and in vitro, the demonstrated antiproliferative effects of cyclosporin on psoriatic keratinocytes in vivo may be due to inhibition of a mononuclear leukocyte-derived keratinocyte growth factor(s) in combination with direct inhibition of keratinocyte growth.\r"

Both iso-osmolar and hyperosmolar test solutions were employed and the results were compared with those obtained from a group of healthy adult volunteers. The findings in each patient have been correlated with small intestinal histology. The majority of patients with villous atrophy had abnormally raised intestinal lactulose permeation and lactulose/rhamnose permeability ratios, whereas patients with normal small intestinal morphological grading did not differ significantly from the healthy control group in this respect. There was a high incidence of delayed plasma D-xylose absorption peaks in dermatitis herpetiformis irrespective of small intestinal histological findings. These results imply that abnormal intestinal permeability in dermatitis herpetiformis is the result of gluten-induced damage to the mucosa rather than an inherent primary defect. It is therefore improbable that the rash in this condition is purely a manifestation of increased intestinal permeation of antigen.\r"

  ".W": "Psoriatic involved epidermis reveals variously altered receptor-adenylate cyclase responses; among them the most prominent is defective beta-adrenergic adenylate cyclase response, which is normally the major receptor-adenylate cyclase system of human epidermis. It is known that activation of hormone-stimulated adenylate cyclase, a membrane-bound enzyme complex, requires functional coupling of at least 3 distinct subunits: 1) receptor subunit (R), 2) guanine nucleotide binding protein (G), and 3) catalytic subunit (C). The precise nature of the beta-adrenergic defect in the psoriatic epidermis, however, remains to be determined, especially in terms of G and C function. Using the involved and uninvolved skin from psoriatic patients, we investigated effects of cholera toxin (which monitors G-C interaction) and forskolin (which monitors C function) on the adenylate cyclase system of epidermis, which were compared with those of normal human epidermis. Both agents increased cyclic AMP levels of involved, uninvolved, and normal human epidermis. Marked accumulations were observed in the presence of cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase inhibitor, isobutyl-methylxanthine (IBMX); without the phosphodiesterase inhibitor, the effect of each agent was minimal. Comparison of the effects of cholera toxin revealed that the psoriatic involved epidermis accumulates much more cyclic AMP than the uninvolved epidermis (involved: 193 +/- 65; uninvolved: 117 +/- 54 pmoles/mg protein/5 h). Similarly forskolin-induced cyclic AMP accumulations of the involved epidermis were much more than those of uninvolved epidermis (involved: 374 +/- 152; uninvolved: 101 +/- 41 pmoles/mg protein/2 h). Those of normal human epidermis were not significantly different from those of uninvolved epidermis (cholera toxin: 99 +/- 36 pmoles/mg protein/5 h; forskolin: 84 +/- 22 pmoles/mg protein/2 h). Our results indicate that G and C function and their interaction is not defective (but rather increased) in the psoriatic involved epidermis. This suggests that the defective beta-adrenergic response of psoriatic involved epidermis reflects defective R or R-G interaction of the epidermal adenylate cyclase system.\r"

A second time course was obtained with two other pigs at 1 h and 3.5, 7, 10.5, 14, 17.5, and 21 d after labeling. The epidermis over each injection site was recovered, and the lipids were extracted and analyzed by thin-layer chromatography and by autoradiography. Virtually all of the radioactivity in aliphatic chains was found first in phospholipids and was then transferred to glucosylceramides, and then into ceramides, between 1 and 7 d after labeling. Labeling of free fatty acids showed a similar time course. Most of the radioactivity acquired by acylglucosylceramide was transferred to hydroxyceramide, bound to the corneocyte envelope, between 2 and 10 d after labeling. The hydroxyacid and sphingosine moieties of the hydroxy-ceramide had equal specific activity. The results indicate that the aliphatic lipids of the stratum corneum are synthesized de novo in the epidermis via phospholipids. Cholesterol, however, was synthesized directly from acetate within hours of labeling, and its esters acquired label 3 to 7 d later.\r"

During the course of the irradiation the animals develop permanent wrinkles on the exposed dorsal surface, which can be recorded in plastic impressions.

Mediators from these cells are potentially important in the pathophysiology and pathogenesis of this disease. To determine whether the enhanced release of reactive oxygen species (ROS) participates in inflammatory events in sarcoidosis, and to explore the relationship between ROS release and clinical parameters, we studied ROS metabolism of AMs and other airspace cells by luminol-enhanced chemiluminescence and by direct biochemical measurement of superoxide anion production. Ten of 17 patients with sarcoidosis were prospectively found to have active disease by objective radiographic, functional, and laboratory criteria. In these subjects, ROS metabolism by AMs was significantly enhanced compared either with healthy control subjects or with patients with inactive sarcoidosis. Abnormalities in ROS metabolism were not seen in peripheral blood monocytes, suggesting that this increased metabolic activity is compartmentalized to the lung. Enhanced ROS metabolism by AMs was associated with recent adverse chest radiographic changes, recent decline in forced vital capacity, and more advanced radiographic type. These data support the hypothesis that ROS generated by airspace cells can promote parenchymal inflammation in sarcoidosis, are associated with physiologic and radiologic changes, and may thereby contribute to the pathogenesis of sarcoidosis.\r"

The current study ascribes another oxygen-responsive role to adenosine, that of regulating synthesis of the erythropoiesis-stimulating hormone, erythropoietin. When perfused through isolated rat kidneys, exogenous adenosine in nanomolar concentrations increased erythropoietin production, whereas inosine, the deaminated nucleoside, had no effect. In addition, an adenosine antagonist, and adenosine deaminase, diminished erythropoietin titers in renal perfusates. In intact rats, adenosine deaminase injections followed by a hypoxic stimulus slightly reduced erythropoietin serum concentrations, whereas an adenosine deaminase inhibitor sharply increased erythropoietin titers. The results suggest that adenosine may function as a mediator to link oxygen supply with erythropoietin production.\r"

However, recommended biochemical protocols do not provide clear-cut diagnostic results in a minority of cases. We have tested the reliability of cystic fibrosis biochemical prediction by ALP high-resolution electrophoresis and ALP kinetic studies after inactivation by urea. With this approach, all the amniotic fluid samples that had not been unambiguously classified as affected or unaffected by standard microvillar enzymes analysis were definitely categorized. The proposed method seems to improve the diagnostic accuracy in pregnancies with a one in four risk of resulting in a child with cystic fibrosis.\r"

A major PMN subpopulation binds 31D8 Mab avidly (31D8 \"bright\") and depolarizes and responds chemotactically to formyl peptide (fMLP) and C5a; a minor PMN subpopulation binds 31D8 Mab weakly (31D8 \"dull\") and fails to depolarize and responds poorly to fMLP and C5a. Fourteen patients with trauma had marked alteration of PMN 31D8 expression compared with healthy controls 52% +/- 20% versus 92% +/- 4% bright PMNs, respectively (p less than 0.01). These patients also had significantly decreased PMN chemotaxis and increased band counts compared with controls 30 +/- 10 micron versus 53 +/- 19 micron (p less than 0.01) and 34% +/- 14% versus 6% +/- 1% (p less than 0.01), respectively. Four patients with less-severe injuries had unaltered 31D8 PMN expression and normal PMN chemotaxis. In patients whose band counts exceeded 20%, there was a strong correlation between the number of bands and the percentage of 31D8 dull PMNs. PMNs that weakly express the 31D8 antigen appear to be less mature than PMNs that strongly express the antigen regardless of cell morphology (i.e., bands, multilobed cells). The data suggest that the decreased PMN chemotaxis and increased infection rate in patients with blunt trauma is caused partly by an increase in the number of poorly functioning 31D8 dull PMNs.\r"

  ".W": "Tobacco sterols (cholesterol, beta-sitosterol, campesterol, and stigmasterol) are present in tobacco smoke and appear in plasma of mammals exposed to cigarette smoke. Because tobacco sterols may be important in the pathogenesis of smoking-induced lung and vascular diseases, we studied the pattern of deposition of cigarette sterols in the lungs and appearance of cigarette sterols in plasma and body organs of rats. After exposure to twenty 5 ml \"puffs\" of smoke from tobacco labeled with [4-14C]cholesterol or beta-[4-14C]sitosterol, rats were killed just after exposure (day 0) and on days 2, 5, 8, 11, 15, and 30, and the lungs and selected body organs analyzed for activity. We found that cigarette sterols are associated with particulates in cigarette smoke, deposited mostly in distal airspaces and parenchyma of the lungs, and appear in plasma and several body organs for more than 30 days after this single exposure to cigarette smoke. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid contained relatively small amounts of radiolabel for only the first few days, suggesting that most of the sterols were rapidly incorporated in lung parenchyma. Because disorders of sterol metabolism have been implicated in a variety of diseases including atherosclerosis and cancer, the significance of tobacco sterols to human smoking-induced diseases deserves further study.\r"

  ".U": "88285965\r", 
  ".W": "Because biochemical \"feminization\" of the liver in males is observed with hepatic regeneration and because the hepatic regenerative response in females is greater than that in males, the possibility that antiandrogens might potentiate liver regeneration was investigated. Before 70% hepatectomy, adult male Wistar rats were treated with cimetidine, an antiandrogenic H2 antagonist, at doses up to 10 times greater than those used clinically. Control animals received either the saline vehicle or ranitidine, an H2 antagonist without antiandrogenic properties. Treatment with cimetidine reduced the hepatic cytosolic androgen receptor content compared with ranitidine treatment. Hepatectomy caused a further reduction in androgen receptor activity in all groups. Hepatic cytosolic estrogen receptor activity was comparable in all groups throughout the study. Moreover, the rate of liver growth and the levels of ornithine decarboxylase and thymidine kinase activity induced as part of the regenerative response were similar in all groups. Thus, cimetidine, despite its ability to bind to androgen receptors, and ranitidine, an H2 receptor antagonist without antiandrogen action, do not modulate the hepatic regenerative response to a 70% partial hepatectomy.\r"

  ".W": "We sought to determine whether the biotin-deficient rat excretes the same constellation of abnormal organic acids in urine that has been reported for biotin deficiency in humans and, if so, to determine the variation of the abnormal organic aciduria with time during progressive biotin deficiency. Biotin deficiency was induced by a 30% egg white diet. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry was used to identify and quantitate the trimethylsilyl derivatives of the organic acids extracted from urine. We detected a progressive increase in the urinary excretion of 3-hydroxyisovaleric acid that was highly significant (p less than 0.0001). Abnormal excretion of 3-hydroxyisovaleric acid was detectable in some biotin-deficient rats as early as week 1; by week 5, all biotin-deficient rats had abnormally increased excretion of 3-hydroxyisovaleric acid. We also detected a highly significant increase (p less than 0.0001) in the urinary excretion of 3-methylcrotonylglycine. We conclude that biotin deficiency in the rat causes abnormal organic aciduria similar but not identical to that caused by biotin deficiency in humans. We speculate that this abnormal organic aciduria may serve as a useful index of biotin deficiency at the tissue level.\r"

We have previously shown chronic activation of the ACP in these patients. To determine the mechanism of this finding, we studied concentrations of the complement control proteins factors I and H in serum from patients with SCD and found no significant difference when they were compared with a control population. Because certain membrane surfaces promote ACP activation and changes occur in erythrocyte membrane phospholipid organization with sickling, we used a liposome model to determine whether ACP activation could be caused by abnormal phospholipid organization of sickle cells. Liposomes with the composition of the sickle cell outer leaflet, which is enriched in phosphatidylserine and phosphatidylethanolamine, activated the ACP significantly more than liposomes with normal outer leaflet phospholipid content. Similarly, liposomes with the composition of the erythrocyte inner membrane leaflet, containing large amounts of phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylserine, activated the ACP more than liposomes with the phospholipid content of the outer leaflet. These findings suggest that phospholipid composition of membranes may play a role in their ability to promote ACP activation, and that changes in phospholipid organization in sickle cells may contribute to the chronic ACP activation observed in patients with SCD.\r"

  ".U": "88285968\r", 
  ".W": "Pentoxifylline has been claimed to work a beneficial effect in arterial insufficiency by improving erythrocyte deformability and thus improving blood flow. A number of observations, including the drug concentrations required to work the red cell effect, suggested that this was not likely to be a complete explanation. We therefore examined the effect of pentoxifylline on several granulocyte and platelet functions. Pentoxifylline inhibited platelet aggregation in response to 4 mumol/L adenosine diphosphate; although statistically significant inhibition was seen at 1 mumol/L pentoxifylline, over 200 mumol/L was required for 50% inhibition. The adherence of unstimulated platelets to cultured endothelial cells was not strongly inhibited by pentoxifylline; however, the additional increment in adherence seen in the presence of thrombin was strongly inhibited (50% attenuative dose [AD50] = 18 mumol/L). Granulocyte aggregation in response to C5a was modestly inhibited (AD30 approximately equal to 8 mumol/L; AD50 greater than 1 mmol/L), and the adherence of unstimulated polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs) to endothelium was uninhibited. The C5a-mediated augmentation of PMN adherence to endothelium was mildly inhibited (AD50 = 240 mumol/L). Inhibition of PMN chemotaxis to N-Formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (FMLP) or C5a (AD50 = 12 mumol/L) and inhibition of superoxide production in response to FMLP-cytochalasin B (AD50 = 24 mumol/L) were seen at more clinically credible concentrations. Perhaps most important, pentoxifylline blocked the ability of platelet activation factor to prime neutrophils for enhanced response to subsequent stimuli (AD50 approximately equal to 8 mumol/L; AD60 = 10 mumol/L when production was the indicator system); in vivo, this could broaden the drug's effect to include functions that it does not inhibit potently in a primary fashion. Although pentoxifylline is known to be a phosphodiesterase inhibitor, and we found it to elevate intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate in stimulated PMNs, we found it to be only marginally more potent than theophylline in this regard; therefore, the failure of theophylline to inhibit PMN priming suggests that this enzyme inhibition is not a complete explanation of the pharmacologic action of pentoxifylline. We suggest that the effects of pentoxifylline on platelet and granulocyte function are likely to contribute to the drug's clinical efficacy.\r"

In a preliminary experiment, sepsis was induced in five animals and five animals served as sham-operated controls. Lungs harvested for gravimetric analysis at 6 hours revealed no significant difference in wet-dry/dry (W-D/D) ratios. In a second experiment, 15 rats were randomized to three groups: septic animals, septic animals infused with 5% albumin, and sham-operated animals. Thermodilution cardiac output and arterial blood gases were sequentially measured over a 6-hour interval. At 6 hours, the lungs were harvested for gravimetric analysis. Lung W-D/D and arterial oxygenation were not significantly different between the three groups. The W-D/D was 3.46 +/- 0.10 in sham-operated rats, 3.37 +/- 0.12 in septic rats, and 3.88 +/- 0.27 in albumin-infused septic rats. The alveolar-arterial oxygen difference at 6 hours was 10 +/- 2 mm Hg in sham-operated rats, 7 +/- 1 mm Hg in septic rats, and 13 +/- 6 mm Hg in albumin-infused septic rats. These data suggest that overt pulmonary edema and arterial hypoxemia may not occur early in septic shock when fluid infusion is not excessive.\r"

  ".W": "Adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a complex pulmonary clinicopathologic condition associated with pulmonary endothelial injury and blood coagulation activation. In patients with ARDS from all causes, factor VII levels were significantly reduced. Patients with ARDS caused by sepsis had more evidence of intravascular coagulation and fibrinolysis than did patients with trauma-related ARDS by having significantly (p less than or equal to 0.05) increased prothrombin times, activated partial thromboplastin times, and fibrin degradation products, and decreased antithrombin III concentration. We sought to determine whether the proteins of the contact system of plasma proteolysis (factor XII, prekallikrein, high molecular weight kininogen, and C1 inhibitor) were also activated after acute lung injury. Patients with ARDS caused by either trauma or sepsis had significantly (p less than or equal to 0.01) reduced factor XII levels, high molecular weight kininogen functional activity, prekallikrein activity, and prekallikrein antigen levels compared with controls. In both the sepsis-related and trauma-related ARDS groups, C1 inhibitor activity was significantly reduced but C1 inhibitor antigen levels were significantly elevated from control. These findings showed that the proteins of the contact system were more extensively activated in ARDS than were the proteins that contribute to later reactions in intravascular coagulation and fibrinolysis. Activation of the contact system proteins could be the result of endothelial injury occurring as part of ARDS. Intravascular coagulation and fibrinolysis in patients with ARDS also arise from components independent from contact system activation.\r"
