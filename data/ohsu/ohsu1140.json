The patient was admitted to the hospital with symptoms of fever and cervical lymph node enlargement, which improved following treatment with vincristine sulfate, cyclophosphamide (Endoxan), prednisolone sodium succinate, and doxorubicin hydrochloride (Adriamycin). He was then followed up in the outpatient clinic, but was readmitted to the hospital with palpitations and dyspnea. Cardiomegaly developed rapidly, and the patient died of congestive heart failure 3 months after readmission. The heart was massively enlarged at autopsy. The heart, including adhered surrounding tissue, weighed 1600 g. The myocardium was found to be replaced by massive infiltration of atypical lymphoid cells. Cardiac involvement by adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma may result from extension or retrograde flow through cardiac lymphatics from the destroyed mediastinal lymphatic system.\r"

  ".W": "More than 400 laboratories participated in the module of the College of American Pathologists' quality assurance program, Q-Probes, which measured intralaboratory turnaround time (TAT) of stat cerebrospinal fluid tests. Four determinations encompassing more than 14,000 specimens were monitored and intralaboratory TATs were compared with participants' TAT goals. The median TATs were as follows: cell count, 32 minutes; glucose, 34 minutes; protein, 37 minutes; and Gram's stain, 45 minutes. Between 14% and 21% of participants (test dependent) met their goals 100% of the time, with 72% of the determinations completed within the time laboratorians required. Standard statistical stepwise regression analysis was used to model influence of up to eight factors on TAT. Correlations were test and bed-size dependent, but ranged from a high of .23 to a low of .02. Only computerized reporting and instrumentation measuring protein and glucose had a consistent effect, delaying TAT, whereas use of a stat laboratory, one workstation, automation, computerized order entry, and centralized processing gave variable results. We conclude that laboratorian goals for cerebrospinal fluid test TAT are met most of the time, and that a stepwise regression analysis poorly explains factors that statistically influence TAT.\r"

The identification of a deletion allows the disease to be confirmed by noninvasive DNA testing. Furthermore, the identification of the gene defect can help distinguish Becker muscular dystrophy from other clinically similar neuromuscular disorders. Most importantly, the elucidation of the gene defects has resulted in the application of direct carrier and prenatal diagnostics.\r"

The present study was performed to evaluate the relationship between the HLA-DR expression and portal tract lesions, as well as to investigate the immunohistochemical characteristics of the HLA-DR-positive microvasculature using liver wedge biopsy specimens obtained from 32 patients with IPH. According to the degree of phlebosclerosis of the portal veins, the portal tracts were divided into three groups: mild, moderate, and severe. The microvasculature in portal tracts was positive for HLA-DR in 21 (66%) of the 32 specimens and in 133 (44%) of 302 portal tracts. In the 21 specimens, there was no significant difference in the prevalence of HLA-DR-positive microvasculature among the three groups: it occurred in 57 (66%) of 86 portal tracts in the mild group, 53 (61%) of 87 portal tracts in the moderate group, and 23 (49%) of 47 portal tracts in the severe group. The HLA-DR-positive microvasculature was positive for type IV collagen and receptors of Ulex europaeus lectin I, suggesting that HLA-DR-positive microvessels are blood vessels. These findings suggest that HLA-DR antigen is already expressed on portal microvessels in the incipient stage of IPH, and that HLA-DR expression persists during the progression of portal phlebosclerosis. The HLA-DR expression may be an initiating factor leading to immunologic assault on portal microvessels in IPH.\r"

The following microscopical diagnoses were made: 43 acute rejections (29.4%), six chronic rejections (4.1%), 18 liver blood perfusion changes (12.3%), 15 biliary changes (10.2%), 10 cases of functional cholestasis (6.8%), two drug reactions (1.3%), two hepatitis B virus recurrences (1.3%), 11 opportunistic viral infections (7.5%), 18 minimal changes (12.3%), two nonclassifiable changes (1.3%), and 19 plurietiological changes (13%). A histopathological diagnosis of acute rejection was made in 31 transplants (58.4%). In 22 (71%) of them, acute rejection was diagnosed with the protocol biopsy specimen that was obtained during the second posttransplant week. Leukocyte counts and serum bilirubin and enzyme levels were obtained on the same day that the hepatic biopsy specimens were taken. There was no significant statistical difference between the mean serum data that accompanied each histopathological diagnosis, allowing identification of a characteristic biochemical profile for the causes of graft dysfunction. We report a detailed description of the microscopical findings of each diagnosis and the following conclusions: (1) Acute rejection is the most frequent cause of hepatic dysfunction and has an early appearance during the posttransplant period. (2) Histopathological findings can identify the causes of the dysfunction. (3) There is no specific biochemical pattern to differentiate these causes. This may be due to the frequent combination of etiological factors in every dysfunction episode.\r"

The results indicate that there are significant differences between patients with Alzheimer's disease and control subjects on all of the tasks. However, when test scores were adjusted for the cognitive abilities of the subjects, few of the tests continue to differentiate the groups. These results suggest that the deficits of patients with Alzheimer's disease on perception of affect tasks are likely to be the result of their cognitive defects and not the result of a primary impairment in the perception of emotion.\r"

Slow progression was associated with older age at onset of disease and with heavier weight (body mass index) at the first examination. Men tended to have a slower disease progression than did women, and this was particularly evident among men inheriting Huntington's disease from affected mothers. Neither the butyrophenone haloperidol nor the tricyclic antidepressant imipramine were related to rate of progression. Assessments of depression, hostility, and tobacco use were also unrelated to rate of progression. Clinical trials in Huntington's disease should consider these factors when designing therapeutic studies.\r"

The validity of any molecular genetic approach for determining disease susceptibility critically depends on diagnostic accuracy. We present adapted diagnostic criteria that address each of these diagnostic pitfalls unique to multiplex multiple sclerosis family research.\r"

Nine patients had hematologic abnormalities, but only two were anemic. All six patients examined had low erythrocyte cobalamin levels. Only two patients had pernicious anemia; in the remaining patients the vitamin B12 deficiency was unexplained. A vitamin B12 binding and/or transport is suspected. The nature of the association of multiple sclerosis and vitamin B12 deficiency is unclear but is likely to be more than coincidental. Further studies of vitamin B12 metabolism, binding, and transport in multiple sclerosis are indicated, as these cases may offer a clue to the understanding of a still mysterious neurologic disorder.\r"

  ".W": "Four patients with levodopa-responsive parkinsonism (aged 26, 35, 45, and 49 years) received autologous adrenal medullary implants into or near the left caudate nucleus by stereotaxic implantation after flank adrenalectomy. All patients had an immediate response to implantation lasting several days, during which parkinsonian signs and symptoms decreased. This period was followed by a gradual reappearance of symptoms in all but one patient. This patient had had a dramatic increase in \"on\" time without dyskinesias and a decrease in the severity and duration of \"off\" time. He died of multifocal glioblastoma 1 year after transplantation. Autopsy revealed no surviving adrenal cells. In one case, the stereotaxic implantation missed the basal ganglia, resulting in the placement of the adrenal medullary tissue into the medial thalamus and near the third ventricle; the patient did not improve. In the other two cases, a modest but definite increase in \"on\" time without dyskinesia and a reduction in the severity and duration of \"off\" time has been observed. The role of autologous adrenal medullary transplantation in patients with parkinsonism remains to be determined. Patients with a family history of cerebral malignancy may be at increased risk for the development of transplant-induced malignancy.\r"

All were receiving optimum levodopa therapy and were examined preoperatively and at 3,6,9, and 12 months postoperatively. Immunosuppression was not used. There were significant sustained improvements at 12 months in three patients; motor fluctuations were absent in two. There were modest group improvements up to 6 months, with increased quality of \"on\" and \"off\" phases, quantity of on times, and specific improvements in contralateral upper limb bradykinesia. Preoperative levodopa requirements were reduced to a mean of 64% at 6 months and 61% at 12 months. Deterioration below baseline ratings occurred in three of nine patients who had consistent follow-up to 12 months. Grafting of midgestational human fetal tissue can lead to improvement in Parkinson's disease. Individual disease severity may be critical, and further trials are needed to identify host factors influencing outcome.\r"

The most consistent cerebrospinal fluid abnormalities in the analysis of sequential specimens were elevated total IgM levels that normalized after penicillin therapy. The neuropathologic findings in one patient showed microgliosis and meningovascular involvement of the central nervous system, resulting in two ischemic infarcts in the myelencephalon. Few spirochetes were localized in the leptomeninges and around subependymal vessels of the fourth ventricle. The vascular element consisted of an obliterative inflammatory vasculopathy in the medullary parenchyma. This study (1) provides pathologic evidence that a vascular disease induced by B burgdorferi is a pathogenetic mechanism for cerebrovascular diseases, and (2) emphasizes the similarities between neuroborreliosis and neurosyphilis.\r"

We reviewed the characteristics, clinical correlations, and prognosis of seizures in 79 patients with neurosarcoidosis. Thirteen (15%) of the 79 patients had seizures, and in eight patients (10%) a seizure was the first manifestation of neurosarcoidosis. These seizures were generalized tonic-clonic seizures in 12 patients (92%) and partial seizures in four patients (31%). The patients with neurosarcoidosis with seizures were more likely to have a progressive or relapsing clinical course and intracranial mass lesions (four patients [31%]), encephalopathy or vasculopathy (eight patients [62%]), or hydrocephalus (five patients [38%]). These central nervous system disorders, rather than the seizures per se, were responsible for most of the serious morbidity and the two deaths (15%) among our patients with seizures. Indeed seizure control was good in 11 (85%) of 13 patients treated with combinations of steroids and antiepileptic medications. Seizures are an important sign in neurosarcoidosis because they are associated with more severe and progressive or relapsing forms of central nervous system sarcoidosis and may be an early manifestation of such disorders.\r"

An ulnar nerve RS test was positive in 41% of them. Sensitization of ulnar nerve RS by ischemia improved the diagnostic yield to 66%.

In many areas, the cortex contained increased numbers of large neurons with disordered cortical lamination. Heterotopic neurons were scattered throughout the white matter with decreased myelination of the underlying white matter. To our knowledge, these cases represent the first fully detailed neuropathologic study of diffuse cortical dysplasia--a newly recognized entity of abnormal neuronal migration.\r"

The position with regard to the Mediterranean peoples is still controversial, because of the large variation of the frequencies observed in the different areas that have been investigated. We therefore studied the frequency of Parkinson's disease in the Local Health Service of Ferrara, northeastern Italy (mean population, 187,000). Based on 394 patients, the mean incidence per year for the period from 1967 through 1987 was 10.01/100,000. The incidence rate of Parkinson's disease among cases with early onset was found to be statistically higher in rural areas as compared with urban ones (6.32/100,000 vs 3.11/100,000). Moreover, the study revealed a significantly higher incidence rate among agricultural workers (20.6/100,000). These results would seem to give further support to the hypothesis of a possible causal role of environmental factors that are mainly linked to agriculture, most likely due to the continual exposure to toxic agents in this area. However, further studies, which are not exclusively epidemiological, are necessary before any conclusions may be drawn, because many confounding variables may account for the results from surveys of this type.\r"

Anti-peripheral nerve myelin antibody titers in the group treated with plasmapheresis declined significantly more rapidly than in the group not treated with plasmapheresis. Five patients treated with plasmapheresis who showed initial clinical improvement, with a concurrent decline in anti-peripheral nerve myelin antibody titer, had one or two recurrences of clinical symptoms during a 2- to 8-week period associated with an increase in anti-peripheral nerve myelin antibody titer. Recurrent weakness was severe enough to prompt additional courses of plasmapheresis. The data suggest that serial determinations of antiperipheral nerve myelin antibody in patients with Guillain-Barre syndrome may identify patients with antibody rebound associated with recurrence of clinical symptoms and prolonged recovery in whom further plasmapheresis should be considered.\r"

Seven patients had a history of tics in first degree relatives. While these patients were seen in a specialized movement disorder clinic and may, therefore, represent a population with atypical and more severe symptoms, the high prevalence rate of dystonia (5.0% of all patients with Tourette's syndrome seen in the clinic) suggests that some patients with tics may have an increased risk for dystonia.\r"

Tremor frequency variations detectable only with computerized measurement were present in grain workers with and without increased tremor amplitudes. Frequency differences discriminated between normal subjects and 74% of the grain workers. The distribution of tremor frequency power in the grain workers was often sequestered at 5 to 7 Hz, reminiscent of tremor in idiopathic Parkinson's disease. These findings suggest that the measurement of subtle tremor frequency changes may provide an early indication of chronic carbon disulfide poisoning.\r"

The computed tomographic scans and T2-weighted magnetic resonance images that were obtained at this time revealed low-density and high-signal intensities in the region of the bilateral putamen and caudate nucleus. These symptoms and the changes in his computed tomographic scans and magnetic resonance images subsided gradually during a 2-month period. Sequential analysis of the cerebrospinal fluid for gamma-aminobutyric acid and dopamine concentrations during his illness revealed reciprocal changes with normal recovery. Because of the delayed onset of neurological changes and the cerebrospinal fluid showing reversible symptoms, the delayed encephalopathy after strangulation had been related to the biochemical alterations that followed anoxia in the vulnerable basal ganglia.\r"

Mural thrombosis was visualized and measured in a thin, rectangular, collagen-coated capillary under controlled rheological conditions by using fluorescence digital videomicroscopy and fluorescence microphotometry. Thrombin activity was inhibited in heparinized blood by the synthetic competitive inhibitor, D-phenylalanyl-L-prolyl-L-arginyl chloromethylketone (FPRCH2Cl), resulting in a marked reduction in the rate of platelet accumulation on collagen surfaces, indicating a role for thrombin in platelet recruitment. Similar although lesser effects were observed by reducing thrombin synthesis with antibodies to factors II and X. To decouple the role of thrombin in platelet recruitment by direct stimulation of platelet activity from its role in thrombus stabilization via fibrin formation, thrombosis was measured in heparinized blood treated with the tetrapeptide glycyl-prolyl-arginyl-proline, which inhibits fibrin monomer assembly into fibrin. The ultimate level but not the initial rate of platelet accumulation was reduced markedly, indicating a role for fibrin in thrombus stabilization against hemodynamic forces. Scanning electron micrographs demonstrated fibrin stands in the heparinized control samples but not in the heparinized samples with glycyl-prolyl-arginyl-proline. These results demonstrate a role for the local action of thrombin synthesized on the surfaces of thrombi even under conditions when the thrombin exerts no bulk effect, such as under heparin anticoagulation. Furthermore, this role appears to be a result of both platelet recruitment and thrombus stabilization.\r"

Seven pairs of surface recording electrodes were compared: (1) adductor pollicis muscle vs second finger; (2) adductor pollicis m. vs first finger; (3) first dorsal interosseus m. vs second finger; (4) abductor digiti minimi m. vs fifth finger; (5) adductor pollicis m. vs second dorsal metacarpal; (6) abductor digiti minimi m. vs fourth dorsal metacarpal; (7) thenar vs hypothenar. Steady biphasic response was recorded with electrode pairs 1-4. Marked variation and low amplitude existed at pairs 5-7. Peak-to-peak amplitude at pair 3 was the greatest (12.5 (SD 3.7) mV) compared with pair 4 (9.4 (SD 2.0) mV) and pair 1 (8.5 (SD 2.0) mV). A close correlation between the amplitudes and integrated areas was found. The first dorsal interosseus muscle response was optimal and the electrodes were simple to fix; this site may be recommended for clinical monitoring.\r"

  ".W": "In a double-blind, randomized trial the effects of caffeinated and decaffeinated drinks on postprandial hemodynamic and neurohumoral changes were studied in seven fit, elderly subjects after a standard 2.4MJ meal. There was a significant difference in supine postprandial systolic blood pressure between the placebo and caffeine phases (P less than 0.01); at 60 minutes, supine systolic blood pressure had fallen 14 mmHg [95% confidence interval (CI)-7 to-21 mmHg, p less than 0.01) after placebo, but was unchanged after caffeine (+9 mmHg, CI 0 to 18 mmHg, NS]. Similar differences between placebo and caffeine were seen in erect systolic and diastolic blood pressure (P less than 0.01), although orthostatic tolerance was maintained throughout each study period. Postprandial plasma noradrenaline levels were higher (P less than 0.02) and the increase greater (P less than 0.02) after caffeine than after placebo. Caffeine administered at the end of a standard test meal prevents the postprandial fall in blood pressure in fit, elderly subjects. The clinical relevance of this finding has yet to be determined, but it may offer a simple remedy for patients with symptomatic postprandial hypotension.\r"

The schizophrenic patients had significantly reduced levels of phosphomonoesters and inorganic orthophosphate and significantly increased levels of phosphodiesters and adenosine triphosphate compared with the controls. The levels of phosphocreatine and adenosine diphosphate did not differ in the two subject groups. The adenosine triphosphate and inorganic orthophosphate findings suggest functional hypoactivity of the dorsal prefrontal cortex. The phosphomonoester and phosphodiester findings are compatible with either premature aging or an exaggeration of normal programmed regressive events occurring in the neural systems sampled.\r"

To assess motor function, we have measured movement time (the physiologic correlate of bradykinesia) and reaction time (simple and directional choice) with an upper limb motor task, and tremor with accelerometry and electromyographic recordings. In this report we describe preliminary data from a Parkinson's disease patient group with symptoms of fewer than 2 years' average duration (compared with an age- and gender-matched normal control group) which indicate that precise, quantitative tests of motor function can detect the slight deviations from normal that are present in early Parkinson's disease. It appears that tests of bradykinesia are most sensitive, and detection of rest tremor is most specific. These tests may be applicable in screening individuals who are suspected of having or are \"at risk for\" Parkinson's disease and other related disorders.\r"

  ".W": "The literature on alcohol and stress in human subjects carried out since 1981 is reviewed. The review covers selected aspects of the interaction of alcohol and stress. (1) Most of the review focuses on the role of stress on alcohol ingestion. Retrospective research based on data from the Health and Nutrition Examination Survey indicated an increase in alcohol consumption with anxiety in certain groups of, as yet not well characterized, individuals. For example, although still insufficiently documented, stress does not appear to play a significant role in alcohol ingestion by women and the elderly. By contrast, stress does appear to play a role in the control of alcohol ingestion by adolescents. Prospective studies employing questionnaire-interview formats generally support an effect of stress on alcohol ingestion. However, studies employing male college aged social drinkers did not find a correlation between levels of stress and ingestion of alcohol. Alcoholics also differ in the reasons for drinking alcohol, but generally ingest alcohol to lessen anxiety/stress. It is clear that the Tension Reduction Hypothesis as originally postulated is no longer adequate. Many new models based on an interaction of alcohol and stress have been proposed to explain the control of alcohol consumption. Considering the multidimensionality of factors that appear to contribute to the control of alcohol ingestion, it is unlikely that a single model could possibly be relevant to alcohol ingestion under all conditions. More likely different models may be relevant to alcohol consumption under specific conditions, or for specific populations. (2) Alcohol has been reported to decrease anxiety in agoraphobics. The self-medication by agoraphobics may contribute significantly to their alcohol abuse. (3) Alcohol has also been reported to decrease tremor of the hands in stressed subjects as well as in patients with essential tremor. (4) Although a number of studies have employed electrodermal activity in studies aimed at the interaction of alcohol and stress, the results have been rather inconsistent. (5) The controversy on the purported beneficial effect of alcohol on the cardiovascular system persists. A number of studies have shown a J- or U-shaped relationship between alcohol ingestion and incidence of coronary heart disease. Alcohol may also influence stress-induced changes in blood pressure. Although a number of studies have demonstrated lower blood pressure in individuals ingesting less than two drinks per day compared with abstainers or heavy alcohol imbibers, the evidence is not conclusive. (6) It is not clear whether the interaction of alcohol and stress involves alterations in plasma catecholamines.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

All scars decreased in linear dimensions and flattened out. Five of 10 scars studied decreased at least 50% in linear dimensions. Interferon gamma can safely be administered intralesionally once per week up to a dosage of 0.05 mg for 10 weeks with no serious toxic effects.

Treatment of tracheal lesions by laser excision is a recent innovative method for the management of airway obstruction in children with Hurler syndrome. We describe two boys with Hurler syndrome whose mucopolysaccharide tracheal lesions were excised by utilization of the carbon dioxide laser.\r"

The indication for readministration was prolonged chest pain with new ST segment elevation. Efficacy was assessed by infarct artery patency at angiography at a median of eight days after readministration in 22 patients and by non-invasive criteria in 23 patients (reperfusion was deemed to be likely if serum creatine kinase was not increased or reached a peak less than 12 hours after infarction). Angiography showed patency of 70% of the infarct arteries after readministration of streptokinase and of 75% after tissue plasminogen activator. The corresponding patency rates assessed noninvasively were 73% and 75%. Reinfarction was prevented in nine (29%) patients. Allergic reactions occurred in four of eight patients who received streptokinase twice (plasmacytosis and acute reversible renal failure developed in one patient). Two patients had major bleeding and two minor bleeding, all after tissue plasminogen activator, and one of them died of cerebral haemorrhage. Repeat thrombolytic treatment results in late patency rates similar to the rates after the initial administration. Allergic reactions were common in those treated twice with streptokinase.\r"

Histologically, hair nodules from five out of nine cases showed a mixture of yeasts and bacteria, four had bacteria alone, and none showed yeast alone. Five strains of T. beigelii were cultured, two strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and 22 strains of coryneforms. The isolates were tested for synergism by a plate-overlay method. Growth of coryneforms occurred over and around sections of the plate inoculated with T. beigelii but not around the control yeast, S. cerevisiae. There were strain differences in the stimulatory response of both T. beigelii and coryneform strains. In reverse experiments coryneforms did not enhance growth of T. beigelii. It was concluded that white piedra is a mixed infection caused by the synergistic action between T. beigelii and a specific coryneform bacteria resulting in invasion of the hair cuticle and cortex.\r"

  ".U": "91002886\r", 
  ".W": "The validity of markers in plasma of in vitro thrombolysis was investigated in 12 patients with extensive fibrinogen breakdown (greater than 80%, group 1) and in 12 patients with minimal breakdown (less than 20%, group 2). The patients were treated with 100 mg of recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (rt-PA) in the \"Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction II\" (TIMI II) trial. Cross-linked fibrin degradation product levels were measured with two variant enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs), both using a fibrin fragment D-dimer specific capture antibody. In one instance, a tag antibody was used that cross-reacts with fibrinogen (pan-specific tag ELISA); in the other, the tag antibody was specific for fibrin fragment D (fibrin-specific tag ELISA). Apparent concentrations of cross-linked fibrin degradation products at baseline were within normal limits with both assays in most patients. At 8 hours after rt-PA infusion, the measured cross-linked fibrin degradation products were increased about twofold to fourfold in group 2 with both assays. However, in group 1, levels were significantly higher with the pan-specific tag ELISA (5.8 +/- 4.2 micrograms/mL) compared with the fibrin-specific tag ELISA (1.5 +/- 1.3 micrograms/mL). This observation was most likely a result of detection of fibrinogen degradation products in the pan-specific ELISA. Apparent levels of fibrinopeptide B beta 1-42, a marker of fragment X formation, increased during thrombolysis from 4.2 +/- 2.8 pmol/mL to 2,000 +/- 230 pmol/mL in group 1 and from 4.1 +/- 2.1 pmol/mL to 300 +/- 43 pmol/mL in group 2, and were correlated significantly with the extent of fibrinogen breakdown (r = -0.8). Fibrinopeptide beta 15-42 levels increased from 4.3 +/- 3 pmol/mL to 70 +/- 19 pmol/mL in group 1, but did not increase in group 2. The apparent increase in group 1 could be explained by cross-reactivity of fibrinopeptide B beta 1-42 in the fibrinopeptide beta 15-42 assay. We conclude that cross-linked fibrin degradation product levels as measured with a pan-specific tag ELISA and fibrinopeptide beta 15-42 levels as measured with certain monoclonal antibody-based ELISA are influenced by the extent of fibrinogen degradation. Fibrinopeptide B beta 1-42 is a marker specific for fibrinogen breakdown. Cross-linked fibrin degradation product levels, measured with a fibrin-specific tag ELISA, appear to be markers specific for thrombolysis. Consequently, assays similar to the fibrin-specific tag ELISA may provide more accurate information when correlated with clinical endpoints.\r"

The immunologic phenotype of peripheral blood lymphocytes was analyzed with a panel of monoclonal antibodies specific for B, T, natural killer lymphocytes, and PCAA (CD38, PCA1) in 52 MM patients at diagnosis, remission, and during relapse, 18 monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS), and 25 normal controls. No significant phenotypic alteration was observed in MGUS. In MM, the number of B lymphocytes was in the normal range at diagnosis and during the subsequent phases. A CD4/CD8 ratio decrease, during relapse, was due to both a CD4+ reduction and to an expansion of a subset of CD8+ activated suppressor lymphocytes. CD38+ and PCA1+ lymphocytes at diagnosis were significantly higher than in MGUS, and a further increase was observed during relapse, suggesting a correlation between PCAA expression and disease activity. The prognostic significance of increased PCAA was confirmed by a survival analysis of 32 patients evaluated at diagnosis using a CD38 cutoff of 0.45 x 10(9)/L positive lymphocytes. Median survival for patients with high values was only 14 months, whereas it was not reached at 32 months by those with low values (P less than .0007).\r"

  ".W": "Monocytes activated by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and interferon gamma (IFN gamma) rapidly secrete a number of monokines with different functional properties. Interleukin-4 (IL-4), a T-cell derived cytokine, has been shown to reduce the production of monokines with cytostatic activity for tumor cells, chemotactic activity for monocytes, and factors that stimulate thymocyte proliferation. This latter activity is mediated by a number of monokines like IL-1, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha), and IL-6. To elucidate which cytokines produced by monocytes are controlled by IL-4, we tested the effect of IL-4 on the secretion of IL-1 alpha, IL-1 beta, TNF alpha, and IL-6 induced by LPS or IFN gamma. IL-4 was found to inhibit the secretion of IL-1 beta and TNF alpha by activated monocytes almost 100%. The secretion of IL-6 was found to be reduced 70% to 85% in the presence of IL-4, whereas there was no effect on the secretion of IL-1 alpha (IL-1 alpha is mainly cell-associated). Time-course experiments demonstrate that IL-4 reduces the secretion of monokines for a prolonged period of time (greater than 40 hours). The reduced secretion of IL-1 beta and TNF alpha was specifically induced by IL-4 because anti-IL-4 antiserum completely restored normal monokine production. These data suggest that IL-4 plays a role in the regulation of immune responses by reducing the production of functionally important monokines.\r"

To clarify effects on platelets during activation of plasminogen in vitro, we used monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs), flow cytometry, and platelets surface-labeled with 125I to characterize changes in receptors for fibrinogen (GPIIb-IIIa), von Willebrand factor (GPIb), and collagen (GPIa-IIa). Activation of plasminogen in plasma with pharmacologic concentrations of plasminogen activators did not degrade GPIIb-IIIa or GPIb, and caused only a modest decrease in GPIa. In washed platelets GPIIb-IIIa was extensively degraded by plasmin at 37 degrees C in the absence of exogenous Ca2+, conditions that destabilize the IIb-IIIa complex. Degradation of GPIb in washed platelets displayed a similar although less-marked dependence on temperature and the absence of Ca2+. The binding of activation-specific MoAbs did not increase during activation of plasminogen in plasma. We conclude that during pharmacologic fibrinolysis, reported inhibition of platelet function in plasma is not due to degradation of platelet-adhesive receptors. In addition, platelet activation observed during thrombolytic therapy does not appear to be a direct consequence of plasminogen activation.\r"

Infusion of 1 mg/kg recu-PA (group I) induced coronary recanalization in 4 of 5 dogs and 98 +/- 1% (mean +/- SEM) venous clot lysis. Bolus injection of 1 mg/kg recu-PA (group II) caused reflow in 3 of 5 dogs and 88 +/- 5 percent venous clot lysis. Infusion of 0.5 mg/kg rescu-PA (group III) achieved reflow in 3 of 5 dogs and 52 +/- 6% venous clot lysis. Bolus injection of 0.5 mg/kg rscu-PA (group IV) induced reflow in 4 of 5 dogs and 48 +/- 12% venous clot lysis. Placebo infusion (group V) was associated with late recanalization in 1 of 5 dogs and 18 +/- 8% venous clot lysis. Coronary artery reocclusion after reflow was not observed in groups I and II, but occurred in 2 of 3 animals in group III and in 3 of 4 animals in group IV (P = .02). The time to reflow in responsive animals was 22 +/- 5 minutes with infusion of 0.5 or 1 mg/kg rscu-PA and 14 +/- 1 minute with bolus injection of 0.5 or 1 mg/kg (P = .14). Depletion of fibrinogen and alpha 2-antiplasmin to less than 25% of baseline levels was observed in the 5 dogs given 1 mg/kg rscu-PA by bolus and in 3 of the 5 dogs given 1 mg/kg rscu-PA via infusion, but in none of the dogs that received 0.5 mg/kg rscu-PA (P less than .001). Plasma clearance rates were 170 +/- 44 and 230 +/- 30 mL/minute after bolus injection and 190 +/- 47 and 310 +/- 56 mL/minute during infusion of rscu-PA for the 1 mg/kg and 0.5 mg/kg doses respectively. Thus, intravenous bolus injection of rscu-PA (saruplase) appears to be equipotent to an infusion over 60 minutes for both coronary and venous thrombolysis. This animal model of combined arterial and venous thrombolysis may be useful for the evaluation of new thrombolytic strategies.\r"

Platelet agglutination induced by bovine vWf generated a complete cytoskeletal core (Triton-insoluble residue), shown by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) to be composed of actin-binding protein (ABP) (260 Kd), 235-Kd protein, myosin heavy chain (200 Kd), alpha-actinin (100 Kd), and actin (43 Kd). In addition, autoradiography of the gels showed a 125I 105-Kd GP, identified by immunoblot as GPIIIa, as well as GPIb, GPIIb, and another band at 87 Kd, probably GPIV. Neither cytoskeletal assembly nor GPIIa incorporation was altered if calpain was inhibited with leupeptin. Platelet suspensions exposed to bovine vWf without stirring (ie, nonagglutinated) or platelets in which agglutination was inhibited with ADP showed smaller cytoskeletons with little ABP, 235 Kd protein, and alpha-actinin. Autoradiographs showed mainly GPIb. Cytochalasin D (CD) and monobromobimane (MB) enhanced agglutination and prevented the inhibitory action of ADP on bovine vWf-induced platelet agglutination. CD markedly inhibited the assembly of the cytoskeletal core as well as GPIIIa retention, whereas MB resulted in a large Triton-insoluble residue which contained GPIIIa. Thus, development of a platelet cytoskeletal core is apparently not required for agglutination, but when a cytoskeletal core is assembled in agglutinated platelets, GPIIIa is retained.\r"

  ".U": "91002917\r", 
  ".W": "Eicosanoid release during multilineage hematopoiesis was assessed using freshly isolated mouse bone marrow cells cultured in the presence of interleukin-3 (IL-3) (10% WEHI-3 culture-conditioned medium). Cells that could release prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) when stimulated with calcium ionophore A23187, but not with phorbol ester (PMA), appeared within 4 days. The cells harvested on day 10 released 42 ng of PGE2/10(6) cells/mL after A23187 stimulation. Leukotriene B4 (LTB4) (4 ng/mL) was also detected after A23187 stimulation, but there was no detectable LTC4 (less than 0.5 ng/mL). Nonadherent bone marrow cells were isolated from 28-day cultures and cloned. All clones were strongly IL-3-dependent. Although other growth factors such as granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), granulocyte-macrophage CSF (GM-CSF), and CSF-1 failed to promote survival or support proliferation of the cells, three clones (11-1-A6, 3-2-D5, and 11-1-A1) showed significant increases in 3H-thymidine incorporation, respectively, after PMA treatment for 24 hours. Surviving cells displayed dominantly myeloid type morphology and phenotypic characteristics. The data suggest that IL-3 is important in the formation of PGE2-producing cells. In contrast to many macrophages (MO), neither the IL-3-dependent cell lines nor the IL-3-cultured bone marrow cells released significant amounts of PGE2 when stimulated with PMA or IL-3, although PMA and IL-3 both induced translocation of protein kinase C (PKC) to the membrane fraction. The lack of production of PGE2 and other eicosanoids by the PMA- and IL-3-stimulated cell lines was confirmed by measuring the release of 3H-arachidonic acid. The data suggest that in IL-3-dependent bone marrow cell lines the activation of eicosanoid metabolism requires elevated cellular Ca2+; PKC activation alone does not appear to be a sufficient stimulus.\r"

Although rFVIII may represent an improvement over traditional therapeutics, the chance exists that protein production in cell culture may result in the presence of novel epitopes that may enhance the formation of inhibitor antibodies capable of neutralizing either rFVIII or pdFVIII. To assess the differences between rFVIII and its plasma-derived homologue, a rabbit immunogenicity model system was developed. Antibodies raised to rFVIII in rabbits were tested for the presence of antibodies capable of binding rFVIII but not pdFVIII, the presence of which would suggest that novel epitope(s) were present. This analysis was performed using a competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, as well as immunoadsorption. For either technique, rFVIII-specific antibodies were not detected, indicating that differences between rFVIII and pdFVIII were not found. When a rFVIII B-region deletion mutant was similarly tested, antibodies specific for this protein were found. These specific antibodies appeared to bind in the vicinity of the deletion site and their binding was not affected by carbohydrate removal. These results indicate that the rabbit immunogenicity model system is sensitive to alterations in the factor VIII molecule and suggest that full-length rFVIII will not be any more immunogenic in human patients than pdFVIII.\r"

  ".W": "We examined in vitro tritiated thymidine uptake by B cells from seven prolymphocytic leukemia (PLL), seven chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), and four plasma cell leukemia (PCL) patients in response to culture with anti-human IgM antibody (anti-mu) and B-cell growth factor (BCGF). In contrast to the stimulatory effect observed in normal B-cell cultures, the divalent F(ab')2 anti-mu antibody uniquely inhibited the autonomous proliferation and induced marked cytotoxicity in six of seven PLL cell cultures independent of complement or Fc-receptor-mediated mechanisms. There was neither stimulation or inhibition of the slgM+ CLL or the slgM- PCL cells. The inhibitory effect on the PLL cells was observed at an anti-mu concentration below the stimulatory threshold for normal B cells. Significant impairment of trypan blue exclusion was delayed until 48 hours, with morphological cellular changes suggestive of a programmed cell death mechanism or apoptosis. The cytotoxicity was independent of the slgM-staining intensity or the autonomous and BCGF-augmented DNA synthetic activity of the PLL cells and was similar in patients with de novo PLL or with prolymphocytic transformation of CLL. Cells from a PLL patient were separated by elutriation into two fractions, a BCGF-unresponsive large \"transformed\" cell fraction with marked autonomous DNA synthesis and a smaller lymphoid cell subset with low 3H-thymidine uptake that could be augmented by BCGF. Both fractions were equally susceptible to the cytotoxic effect of anti-mu. These data suggest that certain slgM-bearing malignant B cells are susceptible to anti-mu-triggered cytotoxicity. They may represent the malignant counterpart of a \"tolerogenic\" normal B-cell subset, and the unique direct cytotoxicity of anti-mu may provide a therapeutic strategy specifically for PLL.\r"

To gain insight into the mechanisms involved in regulating TNF responsiveness, we have examined TNF receptor expression on neoplastic B-CLL cells. We have demonstrated that freshly isolated neoplastic B cells from patients with CLL did not express TNF receptors. After 1 day of incubation in culture medium, TNF receptors were detectable in the range of 540 to 1,500/cell. Kinetic experiments revealed that receptor expression was half-maximal after 3 hours of culturing and required de novo protein synthesis. The Scatchard plots of TNF-alpha binding indicated a single set of high-affinity TNF receptors with a dissociation constant of 70 pmol/L. TNF receptor expression in vitro was found in all examined cases. All cytokines tested, with the exception of IL-2, did not influence the expression of TNF receptors. The TNF receptor expression is enhanced in B-CLL cells cultured in the presence of interleukin-2 when compared with the receptor expression of cells cultured in medium alone. Our data suggest that neoplastic B-CLL cells in patients with stable disease do not express TNF receptors in vivo and that an unknown mechanism suppressing TNF receptor expression in vivo may play a role in growth regulation of neoplastic B cells.\r"

However, the effect of extracellular pH on the contractility of human ureteric muscle has not been clearly defined. This study has established, using a microsuperfusion technique, that an increased superfusate PCO2 increases the magnitude of the phasic contraction to electrical field stimulation. A similar extracellular acidosis induced by alteration of the [HCO3-], at constant [Na+] and free [Ca2+], was without significant effect. Furthermore, when both superfusate PCO2 and [HCO3-] were simultaneously increased at constant pH the contractile response was similar to that when PCO2 alone was raised. These observations suggest that the changes of tension were mediated by intracellular pH changes, providing it is assumed that the ureteric smooth muscle cell membrane is permeable to CO2 but impermeable to H+ and HCO3-. The occurrence of an increase of force in the presence of an acidosis is a highly significant and unusual finding, since it has been assumed that the classical association between acidosis and negative inotropy, seen in cardiac muscle, was also applicable to smooth muscle.\r"

We can neither afford to ignore the rising costs nor reject efforts by provincial licensing authorities to improve supervision of the quality of care. Furthermore, there is increasing public interest in the outcome of medical treatment and a suspicion that some care may be unnecessary or inappropriate. Much of what physicians do is not based on impeccable or complete scientific evidence, and we have not established a method whereby science can consistently be translated into practice. Optimal practice patterns must be defined to improve the quality of care and to maximize the efficiency with which scarce resources are used. Careful scientific evaluation of data is particularly necessary with the arrival of new drugs and technology. Sensible, flexible guidelines produced by appropriate panels will help promote improved practice. Rigid standards must be avoided to allow for individual consideration and scientific innovation. The recognized difficulties of influencing clinical practice by precept or education and the problems imposed by rapidly changing scientific knowledge are two hurdles to be overcome. Licensing bodies must identify and enforce minimal standards, but optimal practice patterns are better devised by a broader segment of the profession. Intervention by third-party payers, as is prevalent in the United States, intrudes upon physician autonomy and reduces access to care. Physicians must support the development of guidelines for optimal medical practice based on the best existing data and focused on improving the quality of care.\r"

In the course of the Thrombolysis and Angioplasty in Myocardial Infarction (TAMI) trials, we used the transbrachial approach to cardiac catheterization with or without angioplasty in 202 of 704 (28.6%) patients. The baseline characteristics of age, sex, risk factors, medical history, time from symptom onset to therapy, and left ventricular function were similar for the 2 different approaches. Time from therapy to coronary angiography was not delayed by the brachial approach compared with the femoral approach: 97.1 +/- 26 min vs. 99.9 +/- 133.8 min, respectively. Chemical patency was established in 78 vs. 73% of patients and technical success with acute PTCA with the brachial approach was 89% vs. 78% with the femoral approach. Clinical outcomes were quite similar with respect to death (6 vs. 6%), reocclusion (10 vs. 14%), and emergency coronary bypass surgery (5 vs. 6%). Baseline hematocrit was 43.9 +/- 4.4 and 43.5 +/- 4.8, respectively with a nadir of 32.9 +/- 5.6 vs. 33.0 +/- 5.4. The need for vascular repair occurred in 1% vs. 3% of patients and retroperitoneal hemorrhage was documented in 1% vs. 1% of patients. This study indicates that in the hands of experienced operators the transbrachial approach to acute coronary intervention in the acute phase of treatment with thrombolytic therapy can be used with equal risks and efficacy as the femoral approach.\r"

Two groups of patients were identified. Group 1 (n = 99) received both CSA processed red blood cells and homologous blood components. Requirement for homologous blood products was reduced in the first 24 hr after surgery (0.5 +/- 1.0 vs 1.3 +/- 1.8 units; P less than 0.05) when compared with Group 2 (n = 56) in whom only homologous blood products were utilized. More patients in Group 1 had no transfusion requirements (45 vs 8; P less than 0.05) and there was no increased risk of major haemorrhage. When the capital costs are included, utilization of the CSA was not cost-effective. We conclude that utilisation of a CSA was safe, with no increased risk of bleeding, reduced requirements for homologous blood transfusions, but added to the cost of the procedure.\r"

  ".W": "We have recently demonstrated that K(+)-induced dilation of cerebral resistance-sized vessels has two independent components, only one of which seemed sodium pump dependent. In our current investigation, potassium-induced dilation of spontaneous tone was compared in cerebral arteries from normotensive Wistar-Kyoto rats and age-matched stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats. Branches of the posterior cerebral artery were cannulated and pressurized, and these vessels developed spontaneous tone. After a 5-minute period in K(+)-free physiological saline solution, K+ was increased in 1-mM increments to a final concentration of 15 mM. In the normotensive arteries, K+ concentrations between 0 and 5 mM K+ resulted in dilations that had a transient (sodium pump-dependent) component, and K+ concentrations in excess of 7 mM produced dilations that lacked a transient (sodium pump-independent) component. Similar branches from the hypertensive rat also responded with transient dilations to K+ (less than 5 mM), and these were significantly greater at 3 mM K+. However, the maintained dilations to K+ (greater than 7 mM), noted in preparations from Wistar-Kyoto rats, were absent in seven of eight preparations. Thus, the impaired dilations, in the hypertensive vessels, to K+ described here is a consequence of altered function of some sodium pump-independent component rather than altered Na+,K(+)-ATPase activity.\r"

Perfusion of the cytoplasmic face of the membrane with unsaturated fatty acids (10-50 microM) such as arachidonic, linoleic, and eicosatrienoic acids inhibited the ATP-sensitive K+ channel almost completely; lysophospholipids also markedly inhibited this channel. Inhibition was due to decreases in the frequency and the burst duration of channel openings. Arachidonic acid activated the ATP-insensitive K+ channel with an outwardly rectifying property. Since the level of free fatty acids rises after longer periods of ischemia, we speculate that the ATP-insensitive K+ channel contributes to the late or secondary phase of extracellular K+ accumulation.\r"

  ".W": "We investigated the effects of streptozotocin-induced diabetes on atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) synthesis, hemodynamic parameters, blood volume, and histopathology, as well as the reversibility of such effects with insulin therapy in Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats and spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs). The biatrial ANP messenger RNA (mRNA) levels in the diabetic WKY rats increased by 16-17% compared with those in the age-matched WKY rats at 12 weeks after the onset of diabetes, whereas their ventricular ANP mRNA levels showed increases of 190% in left ventricles and 160% in right ventricles at 8 weeks. In the diabetic SHRs, the left atrial ANP mRNA levels increased by 36% compared with those in the age-matched SHRs, as early as 4 weeks after diabetes onset. Their ventricular ANP mRNA levels also showed 80-82% increases in left and right ventricles at 4 weeks. In proportion to changes in cardiac ANP synthesis, the biventricular end-diastolic pressures were significantly elevated at 8 weeks in the diabetic WKY rats and at 4 weeks in the diabetic SHRs. The blood volume significantly increased at 8 weeks in the diabetic WKY rats and remained higher thereafter, whereas it did not change in the diabetic SHRs throughout the experimental period. The left ventricular peak dP/dt was depressed in the 8-week diabetic SHRs, whereas in the diabetic WKY rats, its depression was observed at 12 weeks after diabetes onset. Histopathological studies showed that diabetic changes in ANP synthesis and hemodynamic parameters described above occurred before the cardiomyopathic histological changes. Cardiac ANP synthesis in the diabetic rats completely reverted to control levels after insulin therapy, accompanied by normalization of hemodynamic parameters. The present study indicates that 1) ANP synthesis is significantly augmented in the streptozotocin-induced diabetic rat compared with that in the normal rat, and the combination of diabetes and hypertension produces an earlier and greater effect in stimulating cardiac ANP synthesis than does either disease alone; 2) an elevation in the intraventricular filling pressure that occurs before observable cardiomyopathic histopathological alterations might be involved partially in the augmented ANP synthesis; and 3) the reversibility with insulin therapy suggests that the streptozotocin-induced alterations observed in cardiac ANP synthesis and hemodynamics result from insulin-deficient diabetes mellitus, not from cardiac toxicity of streptozotocin.\r"

To characterize the electrophysiological effects of glibenclamide during metabolic inhibition (by either application of dinitrophenol or hypoxia) we performed patch-clamp studies in isolated membrane patches of guinea pig myocytes and in intact guinea pig myocytes and studied action potential parameters in isolated superfused guinea pig papillary muscle. We studied the effect of glibenclamide on extracellular accumulation of K+ and H+ in isolated retrogradely perfused globally ischemic hearts of rat, guinea pig, and rabbit. Experimental evidence is presented that supports the conclusions that glibenclamide 1) effectively blocks open K+ATP channels, 2) reverses the dinitrophenol-induced increase of the outward current and prevents the hypoxia-induced shortening of the action potential, 3) decreases the rate of K+ accumulation during the first minutes of ischemia in stimulated hearts, an effect which was entirely absent in quiescent hearts, and 4) does not influence the rate and extent of ischemia-induced extracellular acidification.\r"

The method of dorsal antiglide plate fixation is possible in most of the frequent Type-B ankle fractures.

A total of three children developed neurologic deterioration during treatment of DKA at Buffalo Children's Hospital between 1984 and 1987. The authors treated aggressively for cerebral edema. Characteristic findings on the computed tomography (CT) scans and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain included hemorrhagic infarctions of the thalami, basal ganglia and lentiform nuclei. The authors conducted developmental follow-up examinations between 1-1/2 - 3 years following recovery from DKA coma. Although they noted significant recoveries over time, developmental disabilities persisted. The clinical courses and neuroradiographic findings of these patients are compatible with sequelae of central brain stem herniation and cytotoxic brain injury. Continued efforts are needed in the prevention and early detection of clinically significant cerebral edema during treatment of DKA.\r"

The correlation between dependence in eating and the existence of swallowing disorders and the risk of aspiration in persons with swallowing disorders suggests that training must be given to volunteers who feed residents. A formalized program for volunteer training and supervision was implemented at Coler Memorial Hospital, a long-term care facility. The program's development and benefits are outlined. Implementation of this program resulted in better training of volunteers, increased socialization, communication, and safety for patients during meals.\r"

  ".U": "91005396\r", 
  ".W": "Thirty-two patients presenting with acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease were entered into the following double-blind, crossover study. First (time 0), patients inhaled either ipratropium bromide (54 micrograms) or metaproterenol sulfate (1.95 mg) via a metered dose inhaler (MDI) attached to a device (Inspirease) (phase 1). After 90 minutes, they inhaled whichever of the two medications they had not received in phase 1. This is referred to as phase 2. Pulmonary function (FEV1 and FVC) was measured at time 0, and at 30, 60, and 90 minutes following phase 1 treatment, and at 30, 60, and 90 minutes following phase 2 treatment (120, 150, and 180 minutes from the start of the study). Arterial blood gas samples (n = 20) were obtained at entry into the study and 30 and 90 minutes after phase 1 medication. The groups did not differ in age, degree of airway obstruction, hypoxemia, or theophylline usage at the start of the study. In phase 1, at 90 minutes, pulmonary function in both groups significantly and similarly improved. For ipratropium, FEV1 improved from 0.62 +/- 0.08 L to 0.88 +/- 0.11 L (p less than 0.01) and for metaproterenol FEV1 improved from 0.69 +/- 0.06 to 0.92 +/- 0.09 L (p less than 0.01). There was no further improvement with phase 2 treatment for either group. Thirty minutes after inhaling ipratropium, there was a small but significant rise in PO2 (5.8 +/- 3.0 mm Hg; p less than 0.05) while metaproterenol inhalation resulted in a 6.2 +/- 1.2 mm Hg decline in PO2 (p less than 0.05). These changes were not sustained at 90 minutes. We concluded that for acute exacerbations of COPD, both ipratropium and metaproterenol are effective medications when administered via an MDI attached to a device (Inspirease). However, ipratropium may be a safer choice as it initially did not cause a decline in blood oxygenation.\r"

All participants underwent measurement of transdiaphragmatic pressure (Pdi), pressure time integral of the diaphragm (PTI), integrated diaphragmatic electromyogram (iEMG), minute ventilation (Ve), tidal volume (Vt), and end-tidal CO2 (etCO2) during 15 minutes of PPV and NPV. For each subject, ventilator adjustments were made to obtain Ve similar to levels measured during quiet breathing (QB). We found that the iEMG, Pdi, PTI, and average coefficient of variation of the tidal volume (CV-Vt) were consistently lower during PPV as compared with NPV (p = 0.01). The iEMG normalized for Ve and Vt was also significantly lower during PPV (p = 0.01). During PPV, subjects were mildly hyperventilated (lower etCO2 and higher Ve) compared with QB and NPV, but no significant correlation was noted between the change in etCO2 and the change in iEMG. The change in PTI was significantly correlated with the change in iEMG (p less than 0.01). We conclude that in the short term, PPV is more effective than NPV in reducing diaphragmatic activity. Positive pressure ventilation may be the preferred method of assisted ventilation in future studies of ventilatory muscle rest therapy.\r"

  ".W": "In the present study, we assessed the occurrence of respiratory muscle rest during long lasting INPV runs using a pneumowrap ventilator at different pressure levels. We measured two indices of diaphragmatic activity: transdiaphragmatic pressure and the electrical activity of the diaphragm. Five healthy volunteers and six COPD patients were studied during spontaneous breathing and during 30-minute runs of INPV at a pressure of -2, -15 and -30 cmH2O. Ventilation, rib cage and abdomen motion were measured by inductive plethysmography; Pdi was obtained as the difference between gastric and esophageal pressures; Edi was recorded with surface electrodes. About 10 minutes of INPV (adaptation phase) were needed to obtain stable values in all the variables recorded. Ventilation increased in both groups up to threefold by increasing the negative pressure applied, this being due to changes in tidal volume. Changes in Pga swings mainly accounted for the reduction in Pdi that became negative during the run at -30 cmH2O. In both groups, Edi, after adaptation, showed no change during INPV at -2 cmH2O but a progressive reduction from control, during INPV at -15 and -30 cmH2O. We conclude that INPV by a pneumowrap ventilator can induce partial respiratory muscle rest in normal subjects and COPD patients.\r"

  ".W": "Macrophages are thought to play an important immune effector cell role in antitumor host defense. It remains unclear whether PAM antitumor activity in patients with lung cancer is normal or impaired. We examined PAM cytostasis in patients with lung cancer and in control subjects and determined whether the in vitro PAM response could be enhanced by gamma-interferon. Nineteen patients with primary lung carcinoma and 15 control patients underwent BAL. Five patients with cancer underwent lavage of both lungs to assess whether any abnormality found related to tumor proximity or was part of a more generalized defect. Cytostatic activity was assessed by measuring inhibition of incorporation of tritiated thymidine into the target cell U937. There was a significant difference in baseline cytostatic activity between patients with cancer (mean +/- SE, 59 +/- 7 percent) and control patients (92 +/- 2 percent) (p less than 0.0002). The increase in cytostatic function after stimulation with gamma-interferon (1,250 units/ml) was higher in the group with cancer (28 +/- 5 percent increase from baseline) than in controls (5 +/- 1 percent) (p less than 0.0005). Cytostasis after stimulation was not significantly different between the groups. In the bilaterally lavaged group, baseline cytostatic activity was not different between cancerous and noncancerous lungs and was again significantly lower than in control subjects. These results indicate (a) that PAM baseline cytostatic activity in patients with cancer is lower than in controls, (b) that gamma-interferon can significantly augment cytostatic function in patients with cancer, to levels comparable with those achievable in control patients, and (c) that the PAM abnormality is part of a generalized immune defect in lung cancer and does not simply reflect a local response to the carcinoma. It may be inferred from these results that PAMs from patients with primary lung cancer are not fully stimulated in vivo and that a defect of T cell lymphokine production may underlie the macrophage dysfunction.\r"

The patients and healthy control subjects all had positive PPD skin tests. Monocytes from both the control subjects and the patients with sarcoidosis exhibited antigen-presenting capacity to autologous peripheral T-lymphocytes, without any significant difference between the two groups. The AMs from patients, but not control subjects, demonstrated antigen-presenting capacity to autologous peripheral T-lymphocytes. Antigen-presenting capacity by monocytes and AMs to lung T-lymphocytes was lower than to peripheral T-lymphocytes, but not significantly. Antigen-presenting capacity was not significantly different between patients with sarcoidosis who had positive and negative PPD skin tests. The mechanism of enhanced antigen-presenting capacity by AMs in sarcoidosis is uncertain at present, but no significant difference was observed in DR antigen expression on AMs between controls and patients with sarcoidosis, and the addition of exogenous IL-1 or IFN-gamma did not induce antigen-presenting capacity by AMs in controls, suggesting that neither increased DR antigen expression on AMs nor increased release of IL-1 or IFN-gamma from AMs is responsible. Thus, these results suggest that T-lymphocyte activation in sarcoidosis may in part be attributable to an enhanced antigen-presenting capacity by AMs.\r"

  ".W": "We examined the local hemodynamic response of intestinal loops during acute necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) in anesthetized rabbits. NEC was induced in ileal loops by transmural injection of a solution containing casein (10 mg/ml) and calcium gluconate (50 mg/ml) acidified to pH 4.0 with propionic or acetic acid. Control loops received casein only (pH 5.0). Mucosal damage was quantified by the blood-to-lumen movement of [51Cr]EDTA, fluid shifts into the lumen, and histology. Mean arterial pressure and loop blood flow were steady over the 3-hr period, loop fluid volume decreased, and there was no evidence of necrosis or epithelial damage. In loops receiving acidified casein and calcium gluconate, there was an immediate dramatic increase in loop blood flow that returned to baseline by 50 min. In addition, loop fluid volume was dramatically increased, necrosis was noted in the form of blunting and loss of villi, and sevenfold increase in [51Cr]EDTA permeability was evident. Administration of CV 1808 (30 mg/kg/hr), a selective adenosine2 agonist, which maintained and elevated loop blood flow throughout the 3 hr protocol, failed to alter the changes in loop fluid volume or prevent necrosis. Histamine levels in loop fluid levels were significantly elevated 20-30 min after NEC induction when compared to saline controls, indicating an early activation of mucosal defenses with this luminal insult. Thus, this model of NEC is characterized by a transient, acute hyperemia, increased intestinal permeability, and histamine release. As mucosal damage was independent of ischemia and could not be prevented by vasodilatory therapy, this model supports the clinical findings that NEC is correlated with luminal factors related to feeding and independent of cardiovascular stress.\r"

Nonetheless, the link between hyperthermia per se and these symptoms is unknown. To test the functional significance of increased body temperature, we investigated the influence of substantial passive hyperthermia on orocecal transit in 12 young, healthy men. Transit time was determined by a consistent rise in H2 concentration in a rebreathing apparatus after oral ingestion of 0.7 g lactulose/kg body weight. Lactulose was given in combination with a 350-ml liquid meal (360 kcal). After raising core temperature in warm water to 38.3 degrees C, orocecal transit time was identical to control (90 +/- 13 min at 38.3 degrees C, 92 +/- 13 min at 37.1 degrees C). While hyperthermia did elevate heart rate and minute ventilation, serum motilin, gastrin, and cortisol were similar in the two conditions. The failure of a passive core temperature rise to alter mouth-to-cecum transit suggests that this aspect of alimentary function is independent of body temperature.\r"

  ".W": "To investigate the relationship between duodenal pH levels and supplemental pancreatic enzyme function in cystic fibrosis, 18 children with this condition had pH recordings performed from the second and fourth part of the duodenum. Compared to age-matched controls, patients with cystic fibrosis had significantly longer periods below a pH of 4.0 in the postprandial period and significantly less time above pH 5.8. These values correspond to the pH levels at which lipase is irreversibly destroyed (pH 4.0) and enteric coating of enzyme supplements dissolves (pH 5.8). A significant relationship was found between the pH recordings from the fourth part of the duodenum and the degree of residual fat malabsorption while taking enteric-coated enzyme supplements. Four patients with an excessively acidic duodenum and residual fat malabsorption despite high-dose enzyme supplementation were treated with misoprostol (Searle), a known acid-reducing agent. There were significant improvements in both duodenal pH values and fat absorption. We conclude that there is a wide range of duodenal pH values found in patients with cystic fibrosis and that the efficiency with which enzyme supplements work is closely related to these pH levels. Administration of misoprostol to those patients with excessively acidic duodenal pH levels as well as residual malabsorption appears to be of benefit in improving both the excessively acidic pH levels and the fat malabsorption.\r"

In the first study, the levels of plasma glucose, insulin, and C-peptide were measured after intake of 10 mg glyburide alone or together with a standardized mixed meal in 10 non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) patients treated with 10-20 mg glyburide/day for greater than 2 yr. There was no acute effect of glyburide on the insulin and C-peptide responses to the meal or during continued fasting, indicating the absence of an acute insulinotropic action of glyburide during chronic treatment. The glucose increase after the meal was also unchanged, but a significant glucose reduction was found after glyburide intake during continued fasting, suggesting a sustained acute extrapancreatic (hepatic) effect. In the second study, the diurnal glycemic excursions in 8 NIDDM patients chronically and continuously (24 h/day) exposed to glipizide (2.5-7.5 mg 3 times/day) were similar when the drug was taken 30 min before each of the three main meals and when taken immediately before the meals. It is concluded that there is no acute insulinotropic action of sulfonylurea drugs during chronic continuous exposure, whereas an acute extrapancreatic action may prevail. During such exposure, there seems to be no clinical benefit in taking a sulfonylurea 30 min before rather than at the start of a meal.\r"

Because human granulosa cells have specific receptors for GnRH, we have compared steroidogenesis in vitro of cells pretreated in vivo with GnRH analogs (GnRH-a) with other ovarian stimulation regimens used in in vitro fertilization (IVF) cycles. Cells from 13 patients treated with a GnRH-a for 26.8 +/- 1.1 days during pituitary desensitization and ovarian stimulation with gonadotropins were cultured. Their steroidogenesis was evaluated in basal conditions as well as after stimulation with follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG). Granulosa-luteal cells from 9 women treated with a combination of clomiphene citrate (CC) and gonadotropins were also cultured. Estradiol production in response to FSH was stimulated only in the GnRH-a-treated cells. Basal, FSH-, and hCG-induced progesterone (P) accumulation was higher in the CC-treated cells. The peak of P production was delayed 2 days in the GnRH-a-treated group. Only cells pretreated in vivo with GnRH-a accumulated 20 alpha-hydroxyprogesterone in culture. The results of the present study suggest that the use of GnRH-a during a long period of time for IVF affects the steroidogenic pathway of human granulosa-luteal cells. It seems that, at least in part, this change is due to the stimulation of the metabolizing enzyme 20 alpha-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase by GnRH-a.\r"

Suppression of endogenous leutinizing hormone (LH) surges by LA allowed delayed hCG administration, resulting in higher peripheral estradiol levels, more retrieved oocyte cumulus corona complexes, and greater numbers of cryopreserved embryos.

  ".W": "This study was designed to ascertain whether any benefit would be derived from aspirating ovarian cysts identified before ovarian stimulation in patients undergoing in vitro fertilization. Thirty-seven patients who had ovarian cysts were categorized into two groups: group A (n = 14) with baseline ovarian cysts and group B (n = 23) with ovarian cysts that developed during pituitary suppression with the gonadotropin-releasing hormone analog. Each group was prospectively randomized into two subgroups depending on whether the ovarian cysts were aspirated or not. In group A, there was a significantly greater number of follicles and oocytes in the ovaries in which cysts were aspirated. However, there was no significant difference in the total number of follicles, oocytes retrieved and fertilized, or in the final outcome. In group B, there was no significant difference in folliculogenesis between the aspirated and nonaspirated subgroups. These observations suggest that the presence of a baseline ovarian cyst may reduce folliculogenesis but do not support routine cyst aspiration if the patient has two functional ovaries.\r"

Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH, 1 microgram/mL) was added during the second half of the perifusion period. Levels of 32 kD inhibin, estradiol (E2), and progesterone (P) in perifusion media were determined by radioimmunoassay. Viable and atretic follicles of medium size (4 to 7 mm) secreted negligible amounts of inhibin. Significant levels of inhibin (2 to 5 ng/mL) were only found in media from large viable follicles. In contrast to media concentrations of E2 and P, inhibin levels did not rise during FSH stimulation. Levels of inhibin correlated with those of P (P less than 0.01) but not with those of E2. In conclusion, mature dominant follicles may be the principal source of peripheral inhibin during the follicular phase.\r"

In each of three experiments, untreated diabetic rats were compared with nondiabetic control rats and rats with varying degrees of glycemic control during insulin therapy. The first experiment evaluated exchangeable sodium, plasma volume, and GFR. In untreated diabetic rats, exchangeable sodium and plasma volume, but not GFR, were increased by approximately 25% compared with control rats. Insulin-treated diabetic rats with plasma glucose levels ranging from 12 to 30 mM had increased GFR, whereas exchangeable sodium and plasma volume were reduced toward control values. Daily insulin therapy, titrated to maintain euglycemia, further reduced exchangeable sodium and plasma volume and decreased but did not normalize GFR. The second experiment evaluated the relationship between vasoactive hormones and GFR. In untreated diabetic rats, plasma ANP levels increased 89% and urinary cyclic GMP (cGMP) excretion increased 94%, with an 85% decrease in PRA, whereas GFR was unchanged. Moderate hyperglycemia (plasma glucose 12-30 mM) was associated with normalized plasma ANP levels and urinary cGMP excretion, a 52% decrease in PRA, and a 13% increase in GFR. The third experiment studied serial changes in food and water intake and vasoactive hormones and end-point measurement of kidney weight, GFR, and plasma IGF-I. In the untreated diabetic group, urinary cGMP excretion was significantly elevated after 3 wk, whereas the reduction in PRA levels was apparent after 1 wk.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Microbiological data for 18 septic episodes in 15 patients following endoscopic biliary drainage (EBD) and 14 septic episodes in 14 patients following percutaneous transhepatic drainage (PTD) were reviewed. In the EBD group, all 18 patient episodes of sepsis had blood cultures and 10 had bile cultures obtained. In total, 17 gram-negative isolates and 5 gram-positive isolates were grown in the EBD sepsis group. All of the 14 PTD patients had bile cultures and 13 had blood cultures. In total, 23 gram-negative isolates and 26 gram-positive isolates were grown in the PTD sepsis group. When PTD cultures were compared with EBD cultures, there were significantly more gram-positive cultures (26 vs. 5) associated with PTD sepsis than EBD sepsis (p less than 0.0005). Analysis of the antibiotic sensitivities revealed that a combination of ticarcillin clavulanate with gentamicin covered 20 of the 22 (91%) EBD organisms and 38 of the 49 (78%) PTD organisms. Based on this data, ticarcillin clavulanate with gentamicin is the therapy of choice for EBD and PTD sepsis at our institution.\r"

  ".W": "Patients undergoing long-term hemodialysis are at high risk of acquiring hepatitis B yet tend to have poor rates of response to hepatitis B vaccine. The effect of recombinant human gamma-interferon (2 million units/m2) on the response to a recombinant hepatitis B vaccine was evaluated in a prospective, randomized controlled trial in 81 hemodialysis patients. A similar proportion of both groups of vaccinees ultimately developed antibody to HBsAg including 81% of the 41 recipients of vaccine alone (group I) and 89% of the 40 recipients of vaccine with gamma-interferon (group II). However, the antibody to HBsAg response occurred earlier in recipients of vaccine with gamma-interferon, so that at 4 mo 63% of group I and 88% of group II had antibody to HBsAg (p less than 0.025). Furthermore, titers of antibody to HBsAg tended to be higher in the vaccinees given interferon; the final geometric mean titers were 232 IU/L in group I and 330 IU/L in group II (p = not significant). Retrospective testing for antibody to hepatitis C virus revealed that 21 (26%) hemodialysis patients were seropositive at entry into this trial, but the presence of antibody to hepatitis C virus did not appear to affect the response rate to the hepatitis B vaccine. These results suggest that the effects of gamma-interferon as an adjuvant in increasing the response rate to hepatitis B vaccination deserve further evaluation perhaps most appropriately in persons who have not responded to an initial course of vaccine.\r"

Antibody to hepatitis C virus was detected in 89.6%, 86.4% and 94.4% of patients with non-A, non-B hepatitis-related chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma, respectively, compared with 6%, 17.4% and 34.5% with similar diseases related to hepatitis B. A history of transfusion was documented in 52%, 33% and 42% of anti-hepatitis C virus-positive cases of chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. The mean intervals between the date of transfusion and the date of diagnosis of anti-hepatitis C virus-positive chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma were 10, 21.2 and 29 yr, respectively. In 21 patients with transfusion-associated hepatocellular carcinoma, anti-hepatitis C virus was present in each serial sample available for testing, including samples obtained up to 14 yr before the diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma. These data suggest the slow, sequential progression from acute hepatitis C virus-related non-A, non-B hepatitis through chronic hepatitis and cirrhosis to hepatocellular carcinoma and support a causal association between hepatitis C virus and hepatocellular carcinoma.\r"

Coronary thrombosis was induced in 35 dogs by placing a copper coil into the left anterior descending coronary artery. Coronary flow was measured with a Doppler flow probe. 30 min after thrombus formation, the animals received saline (controls, n = 10); SQ 29548 (0.4 mg/kg bolus + 0.4 mg/kg per h infusion), a TxA2/PGH2 receptor antagonist (n = 8); dazoxiben (5 mg/kg bolus + 5 mg/kg per h infusion), a TxA2 synthase inhibitor (n = 9); or R 68070 (5 mg/kg bolus + 5 mg/kg per h infusion), a drug that blocks TxA2/PGH2 receptors and inhibits TxA2 synthase (n = 8). Then, all dogs received heparin (200 U/kg) and a bolus of t-PA (80 micrograms/kg) followed by a continuous infusion (8 micrograms/kg per min) for up to 90 min or until reperfusion was achieved. The time to thrombolysis did not change significantly in SQ 29548-treated dogs as compared with controls (42 +/- 5 vs. 56 +/- 7 min, respectively, P = NS), but it was significantly shortened by R 68070 and dazoxiben (11 +/- 2 and 25 +/- 6 min, respectively, P less than 0.001 vs. controls and SQ 29548-treated dogs). R 68070 administration resulted in a lysis time significantly shorter than that observed in the dazoxiben-treated group (P less than 0.01). Reocclusion was observed in eight of eight control dogs, five of seven SQ 29548-treated dogs, seven of nine dazoxiben-treated dogs, and zero of eight R 68070-treated animals (P less than 0.001). TxB2 and 6-keto-PGF1 alpha, measured in blood samples obtained from the coronary artery distal to the thrombus, were significantly increased at reperfusion and at reocclusion in control animals and in dogs receiving SQ 29548. R 68070 and dazoxiben prevented the increase in plasma TxB2 levels, whereas 6-keto-PGF1 alpha levels were significantly increased with respect to control and SQ 29548-treated dogs. Thus, simultaneous inhibition of TxA2 synthase and blockade of TxA2/PGH2 receptors is more effective than either intervention alone in this experimental model in enhancing thrombolysis and preventing reocclusion after t-PA administration.\r"

  ".W": "Aldose reductase (AR) is an enzyme responsible for converting glucose into sorbitol and galactose into galactitol. In the renal inner medulla, where sorbitol production plays a role in cellular osmoregulation, AR gene expression has been shown to be osmotically regulated. The present study examined the effects of the accumulation of the AR end product, galactitol, induced by galactose feeding, on AR gene expression and on the balance of other cellular osmolytes, including inositol, in the renal medulla. To differentiate between the effects of excess substrate, product, and intervening osmotic factors, rats were fed either control, galactose, galactose and sorbinil (an AR inhibitor), or control plus sorbinil diets. Renal papillae were assayed for AR mRNA, sodium, urea, galactose, galactitol, sorbitol, inositol, and other organic osmolytes. Galactose feeding resulted in a great accumulation of galactitol and reduction in AR mRNA levels in renal papillae. Associated with these changes was a significant depletion of renal papillary sorbitol, inositol, and glycerolphosphocholine. These effects were largely attenuated by sorbinil. The present findings suggest that renal cellular accumulation of the enzyme's polyol product causes downregulation of AR gene expression. Furthermore, our findings suggest that the inositol depletion associated with sorbitol or galactitol accumulation in various cell types during hyperglycemia may be a function of cellular osmoregulation.\r"

  ".W": "The envelope (membrane) glycoprotein of HIV is essential for virus attachment and entry into host cells. Additionally, when expressed on the plasma membrane of infected cells, the envelope protein is responsible for mediating cell-cell fusion which leads to the formation of multinucleated giant cells, one of the major cytopathic effects of HIV infections. The envelope glycoproteins of HIV contain regions that can fold into amphipathic alpha-helixes, and these regions have been suggested to play a role in subunit associations and in virus-induced cell fusion and cytopathic effects of HIV. We therefore tested the possibility that amphipathic helix-containing peptides and proteins may interfere with the HIV amphipathic peptides and inhibit those steps of HIV infection involving membrane fusion. Apolipoprotein A-I, the major protein component of high density lipoprotein, and its amphipathic peptide analogue were found to inhibit cell fusion, both in HIV-1-infected T cells and in recombinant vaccinia-virus-infected CD4+ HeLa cells expressing HIV envelope protein on their surfaces. The amphipathic peptides inhibited the infectivity of HIV-1. The inhibitory effects were manifest when the virus, but not cells, was pretreated with the peptides. Also, a reduction in HIV-induced cell killing was observed when virus-infected cell cultures were maintained in presence of amphipathic peptides. These results have potential implications for HIV biology and therapy.\r"

  ".W": "It has long been assumed that the primary influences regulating cardiac contractility are the extent of mechanical loading of muscle fibers and the activity of the autonomic nervous system. However, the vasoactive peptide endothelin, initially found in vascular endothelium, is among the most potent positively inotropic agents yet described in mammalian myocardium. In isolated adult rat ventricular cells, endothelin's action was slow in onset but very long lasting with an EC50 of 50 pM that approximates the reported KD of the peptide for its receptor in rat heart. When the calcium activity of the buffer superfusing isolated single fura-2-loaded myocytes paced at 1.5 Hz was varied from 0.1 to 0.9 mM [Ca2+]o, 100 pM endothelin increased contractile amplitude with no significant change in diastolic or systolic [Ca2+]i, thus appearing to sensitize the myofilaments to intracellular calcium. Pertussis toxin, or prior exposure to a beta-adrenergic agonist, reduced or abolished the increase in myocyte contractility induced by endothelin. This novel and potent pharmacologic action of endothelin points to the potential importance of local, paracrine factors, perhaps derived from microvascular endothelium or endocardium, in the control of the contractile function of the heart.\r"

To test the hypothesis that IFN-gamma might have important effects upon the ability of human mononuclear phagocytes to degrade extracellular matrix, we have studied the action of this cytokine on the production of metalloproteinases and the counterregulatory tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases (TIMP) by the human alveolar macrophage. We have found that IFN-gamma potently and selectively suppresses the lipopolysaccharide-induced production of two metalloproteinases--interstitial collagenase and stromelysin--by 50-90% at doses greater than or equal to 10 U/ml. The synthesis of TIMP and 92-kD type IV collagenase was also diminished by IFN-gamma, but these responses required 50- to 100-fold higher concentrations of the cytokine. All doses of IFN-gamma increased total and secreted protein synthesis slightly, indicating a highly specific effect on metalloenzyme biosynthesis. Inhibition of metalloproteinase expression occurred at a pretranslational level, as evidenced by parallel reductions in enzyme biosynthesis and collagenase-specific steady-state mRNA levels. Interestingly, the effect of IFN-gamma on metalloenzyme production was not readily reversible. Therefore, while IFN-gamma activates the macrophage and renders it tumoricidal, this enhanced function appears to be attained at the expense of the cell's capacity to degrade extracellular matrix.\r"

  ".W": "To directly compare clinical side effects and biological response modification, IFN-beta ser, IFN-gamma, or the combination of IFN-beta ser plus IFN-gamma was administered to 21 cancer patients. Each IFN or the combination was given intravenously on days 1, 8, and 15 in varied order. Each IFN and the combination resulted in significant (P less than 0.05) modulation of IFN-induced proteins. IFN-beta ser was more effective than IFN-gamma in enhancing 2-5A synthetase activity (P = 0.001). IFN-gamma was more effective than IFN-beta ser in enhancing serum beta 2 microglobulin expression (P = 0.05) and indoleamine dioxygenase activity, as assessed by decreased serum tryptophan (P = 0.03). The combination enhanced tryptophan catabolism more effectively than IFN-beta ser in a dose-dependent manner (P less than 0.03). IFN-beta ser/IFN-gamma did not potentiate natural killer cells or antibody-dependent cellular toxicity (ADCC). IFN-beta ser/IFN-gamma enhanced monocyte guanylate cyclase activity, as assessed by serum neopterin, more effectively than IFN-gamma alone (P = 0.005). Both IFNs and the combination resulted in increases in HLA class II expression on monocytes. However, no significant difference in the level of induction of HLA DQ and HLA DR expression between IFN-beta ser/IFN-gamma and either IFN-beta ser or IFN-gamma was noted. Although frequency and servity of side effects of IFN-beta ser, IFN-gamma, or the combination were dose related, induction of induced proteins (with exception of influences on tryptophan catabolism) were not a function of dose administered over the 10-fold range. Continued treatment with the combination intravenously three times a week for 4 wk sustained but did not further potentiate, most of the changes in interferon-induced proteins. Thus, IFN-beta ser and IFN-gamma each resulted in effective and essentially equivalent patterns of induction of induced proteins. When combined, however, these IFNs did not result in potentiation of biological response modification in vivo.\r"

Despite this in vitro effectiveness, the clinical use of glucocorticoids has failed to demonstrate any clear benefit in the treatment of septic shock. In an effort to understand what other mechanisms might play a role in the patient with sepsis, we examined the effect of interferon-gamma (IFN gamma) on the synthesis of cachectin/TNF. We show here that IFN gamma, although unable by itself to induce cachectin/TNF synthesis, enhanced the endotoxin-induced production of cachectin/TNF in vitro. Furthermore, IFN gamma overcame the inhibition of cachectin/TNF synthesis caused by the glucocorticoid, dexamethasone. These effects of IFN gamma were accounted for by increased levels of cachectin/TNF mRNA. The in vivo implications of these studies are discussed with emphasis on their relevance in human sepsis.\r"

  ".W": "The present study was undertaken to examine the cellular interaction between a Na+/K(+)-ATPase inhibitor, ouabain, and arginine vasopressin (AVP) in rat vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) in culture. Preincubation with 10(-5) M ouabain for 60 min increased basal cytosolic free Ca2+ [( Ca2+]i) concentration and intracellular 45Ca2+ uptake. Ouabain, however, did not affect basal 45Ca2+ efflux or AVP-stimulated 45Ca2+ efflux. As assessed by cell shape change, preincubation with 10(-5) M ouabain for 60 min also enhanced the sustained cellular contractile effect of a submaximal (10(-8) M AVP, 21.5% vs. 30.5%, P less than 0.01) but not maximal dose of 10(-6) M AVP. Preincubation with 10(-5) M ouabain for 60 min did not change AVP-induced V1-specific surface receptor binding or AVP-induced inositol phosphate production but did however potentiate the mobilization of [Ca2+]i induced by a submaximal (10(-8) M AVP, 301 vs. 385 nM, P less than 0.01) but not a maximal dose of AVP. These effects of ouabain on the mobilization of [Ca2+]i were abolished by incubation in Ca2(+)-free buffer or 5 X 10(-5) M verapamil. Ouabain (10(-5) M) also enhanced the sustained cellular contractile effect of a direct protein kinase C activator, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate. The present results therefore indicate that the inhibition of Na+/K(+)-ATPase may enhance the vascular action of AVP, and perhaps other vasoconstrictors, by increasing the AVP-induced mobilization of [Ca2+]i and by potentiating the activity of protein kinase C stimulated by AVP through enhancing basal and AVP-stimulated cellular Ca2+ uptake.\r"

  ".U": "91009832\r", 
  ".W": "The mechanisms underlying the chronic unrelenting inflammatory response seen in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are poorly understood. We have recently proposed a novel role for the normal intestinal enterocyte, that of antigen presenting cell. However, in contrast to conventional antigen presenting cells, normal enterocytes appear to selectively activate CD8+ antigen nonspecific suppressor T cells. To determine whether failure of this process may be occurring in inflammatory bowel disease, freshly isolated enterocytes from small and large bowel from normal patients, patients with Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, and inflammatory (diverticulitis, ischemic colitis, and gold induced colitis) controls were co-cultured with allogeneic T cells in a modified mixed lymphocyte reaction. In contrast to normal enterocytes, 42/42 Crohn's and 35/38 ulcerative colitis-derived epithelial cells stimulated CD4+ T cells, whereas 65/66 and 9/9 normal and inflammatory control enterocytes, respectively, stimulated CD8+ T cells (as previously described), suggesting that the results seen were not just a reflection of underlying inflammation. Furthermore, IBD enterocytes from both histologically involved and uninvolved tissue were similar in their ability to selectively activate CD4+ T cells, speaking for a more global defect in epithelial cells in IBD. Finally, activated T cells from IBD epithelial cell-stimulated mixed lymphocyte cultures displayed potent T helper activity in an antigen nonspecific fashion. Taken together, these data suggest that there may be an intrinsic defect in epithelial cells from patients with IBD, resulting in the inability to normally stimulate suppressor T cells in an antigen overloaded environment.\r"

  ".U": "91009836\r", 
  ".W": "It has been shown that pulmonary macrophage (PM) phagocytosis of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA) is inhibited in the presence of serum from cystic fibrosis (CF) patients colonized by Pseudomonas, and that these sera contain high concentrations of IgG2 antibodies. The goal of these studies was to investigate the role that IgG2-containing immune complexes (IC) play in this inhibition of both PM and neutrophil phagocytosis. We found that serum IgG2 concentrations were elevated significantly in CF patients with chronic PA colonization and that in selected sera from CF patients with chronic PA colonization (CF + IC, n = 10), the mean IC level was significantly elevated (2.90 +/- 0.22 mg/dl [SEM]). IgG2 comprised 74.5% of IgG precipitated in IC from CF + IC sera. An invitro phagocytic assay of [14C]PA uptake using CF + IC whole-sera opsonins confirmed that endocytosis by normal PM and neutrophils was significantly depressed. Removal of IC from CF + IC sera resulted in significantly decreased serum IgG2 concentrations without a significant change in the other subclass concentrations, and enhanced [14C]PA uptake by PM (26.6% uptake increased to 47.3%) and neutrophils (16.9% increased to 52.6%). Return of the soluble IgG2 IC to the original CF sera supernatants and the positive control sera resulted in return of the inhibitory capacity of the CF + IC sera. We conclude that immune sera from patients with chronic Pseudomonas infections characterized by elevated IgG2 subclass level functions poorly as an opsonin. In these individuals, IgG2 contributes significantly to circulating IC and removal of IC, matched by a simultaneous fall in IgG2, improves bacterial uptake by neutrophil and mononuclear phagocytes. IgG2 antibodies exert antiphagocytic effects by both direct inhibition and the formation of IC.\r"

These studies have suggested that germline genes with little if any somatic mutation can generate RF specificity. However, there is no information presently available regarding the primary structure and genetic origin of RF in rheumatoid arthritis. In this study, we have isolated and sequenced the VH regions of six monoclonal RF derived from the synovial membranes of two patients with rheumatoid arthritis and one with the juvenile polyarticular form of the disease. We found the same VH families as previously reported among monoclonal paraproteins with RF activity. However, our sample was diverse regarding the VH, DH, and JH gene segments used. Among VHI RF there was conservation in the length of CDRIII as well as restriction in the amino acid generated at the V-D junction, as opposed to VHIII RF and non-RF VHI molecules that are highly heterogeneous in these two aspects. We also found that different JH gene segments may contribute to RF specificity. The VH, DH, and JH elements of one RF in our study all had clearly identifiable germline counterparts. This RF displays a nearly germline configuration throughout its entire heavy chain and represents another example of an autoantibody encoded by one of the VH gene segments from the preimmune fetal repertoire.\r"

  ".U": "91009842\r", 
  ".W": "Enzymatic activity, biosynthesis, and maturation of lactasephlorizin hydrolase (LPH) were investigated in adult volunteers with suspected lactose intolerance. Mean LPH activity in jejunal biopsy homogenates of these individuals was 31% compared to LPH-persistent individuals, and was accompanied by a reduced level of LPH-protein. Mean sucrase activity in individuals with low LPH was increased to 162% and was accompanied by an increase in sucrase-isomaltase (SI)-protein. Biosynthesis of LPH, SI, and aminopeptidase N (APN) was studied in organ culture of small intestinal biopsy specimens. In individuals with LPH restriction, the rate of synthesis of LPH was drastically decreased, reaching just 6% of the LPH-persistent group after 20 h of culture, while the rate of synthesis of SI appeared to be increased. In addition, maturation of pro-LPH to mature LPH occurred at a slower rate in LPH-restricted tissue. Immunoelectron microscopy revealed an accumulation of immunoreactive LPH in the Golgi region of enterocytes from LPH-restricted individuals and reduced labeling of microvillus membranes. Therefore, lactose intolerance in adults is mainly due to a decreased biosynthesis of LPH, either at the transcriptional or translational level. In addition, intracellular transport and maturation is retarded in some of the LPH-restricted individuals, and this leads to an accumulation of newly synthesized LPH in the Golgi and a failure of LPH to reach the microvillus membrane.\r"

Relative deficiency of the enzyme during adulthood is a common condition worldwide and is frequently associated with symptoms of lactose intolerance. We studied the synthesis and processing of lactase in normal and adult hypolactasic subjects using human intestinal explants in organ culture. Metabolic labeling experiments in our control subjects with [35S]methionine followed by immunoprecipitation, sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide-gel electrophoresis, and fluorography demonstrated that newly synthesized lactase is initially recognized as a precursor molecule with a relative molecular weight (Mr) of 205,000. Over the course of several hours most of the labeled lactase was converted to a mature form of 150,000 Mr. Transiently appearing forms of 215,000 and 190,000 Mr were identified and were felt to represent intermediary species generated during intracellular processing. We identified two distinct alterations in lactase biosynthesis accounting for adult hypolactasia. Studies in three deficient subjects demonstrated markedly reduced synthesis of the precursor protein though posttranslational processing appeared identical to normal. Multiple studies in a fourth deficient subject demonstrated synthesis of ample amounts of precursor lactase but reduced conversion to the mature active form of the enzyme.\r"

Mouse peritoneal macrophages from LPS-treated animals showed a two to three fold increase in COX activity determined by the production of PGE2 and PGI2 after stimulation of the cells with exogenous arachidonate. Dexamethasone injected simultaneously with LPS, 12 h before killing of the animal and removal of the macrophages, completely blocked the LPS-induced increase COX activity in peritoneal macrophages. The regulation observed in COX activity by LPS and dexamethasone are due primarily to changes in COX mass as determined by immunoprecipitation of [35S]methionine endogenously labeled enzyme. In contrast, the COX present in the nonadherent cells and in renal medullary microsomes obtained from the same animals, showed no significant changes between treatments. These results indicate that LPS in vivo stimulates COX synthesis in the peritoneal macrophages but not in the kidney. The effect of dexamethasone to inhibit COX synthesis is selective to the LPS-induced enzyme.\r"

Accordingly, a method to detect and quantify fetal-Rh(D) positive maternal haemorrhage using erythrocyte fluorescent immunocytometry was developed. An indirect immunofluorescence method with IgG anti-D immunoglobulin as the primary antibody was used, combined with quantitative analysis on a fluorescence activated cell sorter. The method was accurate, specific, and sensitive and could detect a contaminating population of 0.1% Rh(D) positive cells in Rh(D) negative blood--a level of fetal-maternal haemorrhage well covered by a single dose of 500 IU of anti-D immunoglobulin.\r"

Immediate fixation with buffered formaldehyde at low temperature, or the addition of EDTA to buffered formaldehyde blocked the DNA degradation. Analysis of pulsed field gel electrophoresis also showed that DNA was degraded before extraction. These results suggest that tissue nuclease has an important role in DNA degradation in tissue. Furthermore, formaldehyde fixation at low temperature, which may take time and which decreases slightly the staining capacity, is useful for the extraction of intact DNA. For clinical application, the detection of provirus was examined. Genomic DNA was extracted from a necropsy sample of adult T cell leukaemia fixed in formaldehyde; human T cell leukaemia virus type-I (HTLV-I) provirus was successfully detected by Southern blotting.\r"

The outcome of 776 patients with patent infarct-related vessels after emergency catheterization was analyzed--607 with thrombolysis-mediated patency of the infarct-related vessel and 169 with patency achieved by angioplasty. Baseline characteristics of the thrombolysis and angioplasty patency groups were similar except for a higher acute left ventricular ejection fraction (51.3% versus 48.2%) in the thrombolysis group (p = 0.003). Seven to 10 day left ventricular ejection fraction was higher (52.3% versus 48.1%), infarct zone functional recovery was greater (0.44 versus 0.21 standard deviation/chord, or 18% versus 7%, p = 0.001) and reocclusion was less (11% versus 21%) in the thrombolysis compared with the angioplasty group. Despite these differences, angioplasty patency was associated with the same low in-hospital mortality rate (5.9% versus 4.6%) and long-term mortality rate (3% versus 2%) as thrombolysis patency. Reocclusion adversely affected the mortality rate and ventricular functional recovery. Technical failure of rescue angioplasty was associated with a much higher mortality rate than was technical success (39.1% versus 5.9%). Thrombolysis patency was preferable to angioplasty patency after thrombolytic therapy in acute myocardial infarction, but both were associated with the same low in-hospital and long-term mortality rates, suggesting that rescue angioplasty is beneficial in some patients with failure of infarct-related artery recanalization after thrombolytic therapy.\r"

  ".W": "When conventional treatment of patients with early clinical reinfarction after thrombolytic therapy fails, mechanical revascularization may be attempted. An alternative strategy, repeat thrombolytic infusions, is reported. Fifty-two patients with acute myocardial infarction were treated with one or two additional thrombolytic infusions of recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (rt-PA) because of nonsustained ischemia after initial treatment with rt-PA or streptokinase. Thirty-five patients received the second infusion within 1 h of the first; 13 patients received the second infusion 1 to 72 h after the first and 4 patients received it later during their hospitalization. Bleeding complications occurred in 10 patients (19%); however, most of these were minor (no intracranial bleeding) and only 2 patients required blood transfusion. In 14 patients in whom the decrease in fibrinogen and plasminogen levels was measured after the first and second infusions, this decrease was only 25% and 63%, respectively--only slightly higher than the 22% and 53% decreases measured in 63 patients who had only one rt-PA infusion. In 44 patients (85%), the acute ischemia resolved completely within 1 h after initiation of the second infusion. In 23 patients (44%), pain and ST segment elevation did not recur and invasive coronary intervention was avoided. Thus, repeat rt-PA infusions can stabilize a substantial number of patients with acute reinfarction and, even when relief is temporary, repeat rt-PA infusions can minimize myocardial damage while patients await mechanical revascularization.\r"

All adverse events that occurred within 24 h of the procedure were recorded prospectively by study personnel and classified according to previously determined criteria. Major events were defined as life threatening or requiring a procedure to treat, or both. Costs of the catheterization procedure, pharmacy, hospital laboratory and treatment of adverse events were determined on the basis of actual resource use. A total of 20 patients (8.5%) had major and 143 (61%) had minor adverse events with diatrizoate use; 10 patients (4.8%) had major and 53 (25%) had minor adverse events with iopamidol (p = 0.12 for major events; p less than 0.001 for total events). Most adverse events were treated fairly easily and inexpensively. The median overall cost was $186 higher for patients after iopamidol use compared with diatrizoate (p less than 0.0001), but all costs except the cost of the contrast agent were not significantly different between the two groups. Thus, patients who received iopamidol for cardiac angiography had a significantly lower rate of adverse events than those who received diatrizoate, but this difference was achieved at a considerably high overall cost.\r"

  ".U": "91010329\r", 
  ".W": "To better understand the mechanism of nitrate tolerance in patients with congestive heart failure, 13 patients received a 24 h infusion of nitroglycerin (1.5 micrograms/kg body weight per min) with or without N-acetylcysteine (225 mg/kg per 24 h). The infusions were separated by a 24 h nitrate-free interval. By the end of the nitroglycerin infusion, mean arterial pressure had returned to baseline values and there was a significant increase in ventricular filling pressures and systemic vascular resistance compared with values after 1 h of treatment. The simultaneous infusion of N-acetylcysteine had no effect on these changes. Although a strict fluid restriction of 1.5 liters/day was maintained for 1 week before and throughout the study, after 24 h of nitroglycerin infusion there was a significant and similar degree of hemodilution whether nitroglycerin was infused alone (9.1 +/- 4.3%) or with N-acetylcysteine (8.7 +/- 4.1%). This hemodilution corresponded to an increase in intravascular volume of 745 +/- 382 ml, most of which occurred during the 1st h. Plasma renin activity increased and plasma atrial natriuretic peptide decreased during the infusion. The results of this study suggest that nitrate tolerance is multifactorial. In addition to the previously described pharmacologic tolerance to the effect of nitroglycerin on vascular smooth muscle, a capillary fluid shift from the extravascular to intravascular space appears to be involved, especially during the 1st h of the infusion. A third mechanism, reflex neurohumoral activation, also seems to contribute to the genesis of nitroglycerin tolerance.\r"

In addition, the effects of these two drugs on the morphology of the gastric mucosa were evaluated by light microscopy of epoxy resin sections. Fasted rats were given one of the following oral doses: (a) misoprostol, subantisecretory (100 micrograms/kg) or antisecretory (1 mg/kg); (b) cimetidine, subantisecretory (100 micrograms/kg, or 1 mg/kg) or antisecretory (50 mg/kg); or (c) EtOH only or EtOH following 30 min of pretreatment with one of the above doses of misoprostol or cimetidine. Animals were killed 30 or 90 min after a single dose or 30 min after two doses that were 60 min apart. The stomachs were then removed and processed for biochemical determination of Evans blue concentration. For morphology, rat stomachs were fixed and processed after exposure to each of the above concentrations of misoprostol and cimetidine. Results were as follows: (i) Misoprostol (but not cimetidine) caused a significant increase in stomach weight (subantisecretory dose = +15%, antisecretory dose = +21%) independent of changes in plasma volume. (ii) Misoprostol at both doses caused a transient (30-min) reduction in plasma volume (subantisecretory dose = -12%, antisecretory dose = -14%) that rebounded to slightly elevated levels within the following 60 min. (iii) Antisecretory doses of cimetidine caused an increase in plasma volume 30 min after a single dose (+37%) and at 90 min after two doses (+46%). (iv) EtOH only at 30 or 90 min produced elevated stomach weights (+25 and +28%, respectively) and plasma volumes (+300 and +250%, respectively), the latter of which was due in part to hemorrhagic lesions. (v) Cimetidine pretreatment (30 min) followed by EtOH did not significantly reduce plasma volume, stomach weight, or the gross hemorrhagic lesions compared to EtOH alone, but (vi) misoprostol pretreatment followed by EtOH significantly protected against hemorrhagic lesions and elevated tissue plasma volumes. Both drugs at all concentrations caused expansion of the mucosal interstitial space (lamina propria), but this edema was greater with misoprostol. Severe interfoveolar cell stretching and even epithelial breaks were found with misoprostol treatment. Cimetidine showed moderate mucosal edema and a \"collapse\" of interfoveolar epithelial cells so the intercellular spaces were reduced.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The role of lipid peroxidation and endogenous oxygen-derived free radical scavengers on ischemia-reperfusion injury and tissue recovery in rat ulcer model corresponding to the gastric histopathology was investigated. Male Wistar rats weighting 200-250 g were heparinized before occlusion of the celiac axis for 1.5 h. Endogenous CuZn-superoxide dismutase (SOD), Mn-SOD, glutathione peroxidase, fumarase, cytochrome c oxidase, and thiobarbituric acid-reactive compounds as lipid peroxidation products were measured in the gastric tissue at 3 h, and 1, 2, 4, and 7 days after release and in the controls (no occlusion). At 3 h after release, erosion of the gastric mucosa was observed, and gastric ulcers beyond the muscularis mucosae were present in the gastric body 2 days later. Seven days after release, gastric ulcers had disappeared. Activity levels for all five enzymes (CuZn-SOD, Mn-SOD, glutathione peroxidase, fumarase, and cytochrome c oxidase) were low for days 1-4 after release and did not return to control levels by the seventh day. It was observed that the ulcer formation, as evidenced by the histopathology, was significantly related to the levels of endogenous CuZn-SOD, Mn-SOD, glutathione peroxidase, fumarase, and cytochrome c oxidase activities. Thiobarbituric acid-reactive compounds were also low through the entire course of ulcer formation. The study concludes that decreases in the levels of these oxygen-derived free radical scavengers may result in the formation of gastric ulcers; however, endogenous free-radical scavengers may not correspond with tissue recovery. Lipid peroxidation may not be related to ulcer formation.\r"

  ".W": "Experiments were performed to investigate the effect of cholera toxin (CT) on human B cell function. Highly purified (greater than 98% CD20+) human peripheral blood B cells were exposed to CT in the presence or absence of anti-mu antibody. Treatment of highly purified B cells with CT stimulated enhanced expression of surface DR molecules, whereas it did not enhance expression of other B cell surface activation markers including transferrin or IL-2R. Neither the A nor the B subunits of CT by themselves enhanced the expression of surface DR Ag. In addition, 8-bromo-cAMP alone or in combination with the B subunit did not increase the expression of human B cell surface DR Ag. These findings suggest that neither elevation of cAMP nor binding to GM1 ganglioside are sufficient to stimulate this activation parameter in B cells. Associated with CT-mediated enhanced expression of MHC class II molecules we found that CT-treated B cells also served as stronger stimulators, compared with control cells, of both autologous and allogeneic MLR responses in peripheral blood T cells. Although CT stimulated early events in B cell activation, it inhibited anti-mu antibody-induced B cell thymidine incorporation by 55 to 75%. Inhibitory effects of CT were observed even when CT was added to cultures as late as 36 h after the addition of the anti-mu antibody. These results suggest that CT has both a stimulatory and inhibitory effect on human B cells and that the stimulatory effect may be mediated via a cAMP-independent mechanism.\r"

  ".W": "Human B lymphocytes were examined to determine whether transmembrane ion conductance plays a role in cell activation. Mitogens (anti-human IgM F(ab')2 fragment (anti-mu) and PMA) were used to stimulate B lymphocytes. Mitogen-induced DNA synthesis was inhibited by tetraethylammonium-Cl (TEA), 4-aminopyridine (4AP), verapamil, and diltiazem in a dose-dependent manner. This inhibition was not due to reduction in cell viability as determined by trypan blue exclusion. Mitogen-induced increases in RNA synthesis were partially inhibited by TEA and 4AP and were more completely inhibited by verapamil and diltiazem. Mitogen-induced cell volume increases were not affected by TEA or 4AP but were completely inhibited by verapamil and diltiazem. B lymphocytes stimulated with anti-mu expressed G1 phase cell surface antigens in the presence of TEA or 4AP, but failed to do so in the presence of verapamil or diltiazem. Substitution of PMA for anti-mu as the mitogen did not alter the effects of TEA or 4AP. However, verapamil inhibited PMA-induced expression of G1 phase cell surface markers although diltiazem did not. The patch clamp technique was used to directly examine plasma membrane ionic currents in whole-cell, cell-attached, and inside-out patch configurations. Activation of B lymphocytes with either anti-mu or the Ca2+ ionophore, A23187, inhibited opening of one type of channel in cell-attached patches. In inside-out patches, this channel type conducted current when the bath [Ca2+] was low (6 X 10(-8) M) but failed to conduct current when the bath [Ca2+] was increased above 1 X 10(-6) M. The results of these experiments are consistent with the hypothesis that activation of B lymphocytes induces alterations in plasma membrane ion conductance. Single channel studies suggest that activation induced increases in [Ca2+]i may directly inhibit a specific set of plasma membrane ion channels as one mechanism by which transmembrane ion flux is altered.\r"

Addition of IL-7 at the onset of cultures resulted in marked (up to 80-fold) augmentation of cytotoxicity accompanied by smaller (1.5- to 4-fold) increases in total lymphocyte number. Studies of CTL development in purified lectin-stimulated CD8+ T cell populations demonstrated that IL-7 could act directly on the CD8+ lymphocyte subset to augment cytotoxicity. In MLC, the IL-7-induced enhancement of cytotoxicity was found to be mediated primarily by the CD8+ subpopulation of lymphocytes. Late addition of IL-7 (day 5 of 7) resulted in an increase in cytolytic activity that was associated with little or no increase in total or activated CD8+ lymphocyte number indicating that IL-7 may act as a differentiation factor for human CTL. A role for endogenous IL-7 in CTL development was suggested by the observation that addition of neutralizing antiserum to IL-7 to MLC at initiation (or 5 days thereafter) resulted in decreased levels of cytotoxicity. These results indicate that IL-7 can exert major up-regulatory effects on human CTL development and suggest that these effects are both proliferative and differentiative.\r"

The clone suppressed the Ag-induced proliferative responses of CD4+ Th cell clones without detectable cytotoxicity for both APC and responding T cells. The clone was able to suppress the in vitro proliferative response and antibody formation of Ag-primed lymph node cells. The suppression was Ag-nonspecific and not restricted to the MHC. The clone was able to suppress the proliferation of Th clones induced by an immobilized anti-TCR antibody in which APC was absent. The clone was, however, unable to suppress the proliferation of Th clones induced by anti-CD3 or IL-2. Thus, the mechanism of suppression by 13G2 was found to be due to a direct action on Th by inhibiting a consequence of signal transduction initiated through the TCR.\r"

Marked expansion of the gamma/delta T cell population (3- to 21-fold) was observed in 15/21 donors 7 to 10 days after stimulation. In addition to M. tuberculosis, Mycobacterium leprae (six of eight) as well as the gram-positive bacteria, Staphylococcus aureus (two of six), group A streptococci (seven of nine), and Listeria monocytogenes (four of eight) augmented gamma/delta TCR expression in peripheral blood T cells of many donors. gamma/delta T lymphocytes expressed IL-2R and secreted IL-2 upon restimulation with M. tuberculosis. Stimulation with M. tuberculosis evoked specific cytolytic activities in gamma/delta T lymphocytes because: gamma/delta T cells lysed M. tuberculosis pulsed but not unpulsed targets; high concentrations of TCR delta 1 mAb facilitated killing of unpulsed target cells; and low doses of anti-TCR delta 1 mAb blocked killing of pulsed targets. Furthermore, gamma/delta T cells from four donors, after activation with M. tuberculosis or with group A streptococci, respectively, only lysed targets pulsed with the homologous agents, whereas in other donors some cross-reactivity was observed. We conclude that, upon contact with mycobacteria and perhaps other microorganisms, gamma/delta T cells are activated which contribute to immunity against infection via IL-2 secretion and specific target cell lysis.\r"

  ".W": "In this study we compare the effect of CD3 and CD2 ligation on tyrosine kinase activation in human peripheral blood T cells. Using antiphosphotyrosine antibody to detect tyrosine phosphorylation of cellular substrates, we demonstrate that mAb stimulation of either CD3 or CD2 results in tyrosine phosphorylation of the TCR-zeta chain and 135- and 100-kDa proteins. However, differences are observed between CD3 and CD2 ligation; only the former results in rapid tyrosine phosphorylation of 72-, 65-, and 40-kDa substrates. Co-aggregation of CD2 and CD45, a tyrosine phosphatase, results in inhibition of intracellular calcium elevation and T cell proliferation. We demonstrate in this study that this manipulation also inhibits polyphosphoinositide hydrolysis and tyrosine phosphorylation of the 100-kDa substrate. The failure of tyrosine phosphorylation of the 100-kDa substrate is specific in that phosphorylation of the 135-kDa protein is not inhibited. Similar results are observed when CD2 and CD45 are independently cross-linked rather than co-aggregated. The observation that CD45 cross-linking alters tyrosine phosphorylation of T cell substrates and effects polyphosphoinositide hydrolysis is further evidence that tyrosine phosphorylation regulates early events in T cell activation including, perhaps, phospholipase C activity.\r"

The productive alpha-gene bore several noncontiguous deletions affecting the VHDJH and CH1 regions. Two deletions were accompanied with peculiar insertions containing duplications. The first insertion contained an acceptor splice site and was present in part in the mature transcript, thus coding for an abnormal aminoterminal peptide. Another deletion located 3' to CH3 eliminated the polyadenylation site of secreted-form alpha-mRNA. As a result, only membrane-form alpha mRNA was present in the tumoral plasma cells, thus explaining the nonsecretory phenotype of the disease. Comparison of cDNA and genomic sequences showed that the previously undescribed human alpha membrane region is encoded by a single exon, beginning with two alternate acceptor splice sites, and comprises either 65 or 71 amino acids.\r"

The role of immunity to type II collagen (CII) in adjuvant arthritis (AA) has not been well defined. We found that oral administration of chicken CII given 3 micrograms per feeding on days -7, -5, and -2 before disease induction consistently suppressed the development of AA. A decrease in delayed-type hypersensitivity responses to CII was also observed that correlated with suppression of AA. AA was optimally suppressed by 3 and 30 micrograms of collagen type II variably by 300 micrograms, and not by 0.3 microgram or 1 mg. Oral administration of collagen type I also suppressed AA; only minimal effects were seen with collagen type III. Suppression was Ag specific: feeding CII did not suppress experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis; feeding myelin basic protein suppressed experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, but not AA. Suppression of AA could not be consistently obtained by feeding MT. Suppression of AA could be adoptively transferred by T cells from CII fed animals and could be obtained when CII was fed after disease onset. Our results suggest that autoimmunity to CII has a pathogenic role in AA and raise the possibility that cross-reactive epitopes exist between CII and MT. Alternatively, the pathogenesis of AA may be dependent on developing immunity to CII. These results further demonstrate the effectiveness of oral tolerance as a means to suppress experimental autoimmune diseases.\r"

  ".W": "The existence of saturable and specific binding sites for mouse P40/IL-9 was demonstrated on a variety of factor-dependent T cell lines derived from Th clones by long term culture in the presence of P40-containing T cell supernatants. Scatchard transformation of the data obtained with one such line was consistent with the existence of a single class of receptors with a Kd of approximately 100 pM and a density of 3000/cell. P40 binding to these cells was followed by rapid internalization of the ligand. P40-receptors (P40-R)3 were also found on certain Th clones maintained in conventional cultures, especially after stimulation with Ag and APC. Only T cell clones that proliferated in response to P40 showed significant levels of binding, suggesting that the regulation of P40-R expression is an important element in the control of P40-responsiveness. In accord with this idea, fresh T cells, cytolytic T cell clones and a wide variety of other cells including B cells and fibroblasts, which do not proliferate in response to P40, showed no significant binding. However, P40-R were not restricted to a few unusual Th clones. They were also detected on several T cell tumors, on macrophages and on mast cell lines. The latter point is of particular interest in view of the mast cell growth factor activity recently ascribed to P40. Cross-linking studies with T-cell lines and mast cells indicated that the P40-R consists of a 64-kDa glycoprotein, the molecular mass of which is reduced to 54 kDa on treatment with N-glycosidase F.\r"

Two IgG1 antibodies, which contained mouse L chains and H chains with mouse V domains and human C domains, differed only in their VH domain. Ag binding and C activation by these antibodies were analyzed by ELISA. When limiting amounts of Ag were used in the assays, the antibodies required different quantities of Ag for optimal binding, suggesting that the antibodies bind to different epitopes on the (T,G)-A-L molecule. However, when competitive inhibition assays were performed with an optimal concentration of Ag, there were no differences in relative binding affinities for (T,G)-A-L or dissociation characteristics of the antibodies. C activation was examined at optimal Ag concentration to ensure equivalent binding of two IgG1 antibodies to Ag. After combination with immobilized Ag, these two antibodies bearing different V regions exhibited marked differences in the binding of C components C1q and C3d. When present in equal amounts in the assay, antibody 10B activated C and bound more C1q and C3d than antibody B11. These results indicate that V region differences can affect C activation by IgG.\r"

The prototypic Id-16/6+ mAb is 18/2, whose VH3-derived H chain is encoded by an unmutated germ-line gene. We found that the H chains of VH3-derived Id-16/6+ antibodies contain the major determinants of Id-16/6. Moreover, B cell clones from which those antibodies were harvested produce RNA that hybridized under conditions of high stringency to oligonucleotide probes corresponding to the CDR of the VH segment of 18/2. Western blots of Id-16/6+ mAbs with anti-Id confirmed the association of the Id with H chains. Id-16/6 can identify a subgroup of VH3-derived antibodies we have termed the 18/2 CDR family. However, Id-16/6 can also be expressed in some antibodies unrelated to the 18/2 CDR family. No characteristic Ag-binding specificity was found among the members of the 18/2 CDR family. The principal phenotypic feature shared by all known members of the family is Id-16/6.\r"

According to the guidelines of the molecular recognition theory, a complementary peptide to human MBP peptide 1-9 was synthesized and used to raise murine mAb with anti-Id activity. Two mAb anti-Id, F25F7 and F25C8, both of the IgM/kappa isotype, were selected for further study. These anti-Id reacted with F23, the mAb for which they were selected, and also reacted with another mAb, which was of the IgG1/kappa isotype and was raised to human MBP peptide 80-89. There was no reaction with another control mAb of the IgG1/kappa isotype or murine myeloma IgG1. By immunoblotting techniques, it was demonstrated that the Id on each of the mAbs to MBP peptides was located on the kappa L chain but also could be recognized in nonreduced IgG. The cross-reactive anti-Id suppressed antibody secretion of Id-producing hybridoma cells in an Id-specific manner, and kinetic studies suggest an intracellular mechanism for the suppression. These cross-reactive Id among antibodies to different MBP peptides imply that the same V region genes of kappa L chains are involved in the selection of antibodies to an autoantigen, like MBP, and may play a role in the modulation of immune responses against MBP in certain inflammatory demyelinating diseases.\r"

In our study HL-60 cells were differentiated to the monocyte phenotype with IFN-gamma or 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3, or to the neutrophil phenotype with retinoic acid or DMSO to compare the time-course of expression of membrane and cytosolic oxidase components, and to correlate this with the appearance of a functional oxidase. Over a 6-day period of induction the rank order of the ability of these agents to induce expression of PMA-stimulated superoxide production was: IFN-gamma greater than 1,25(OH)2D3 greater than retinoic acid greater than DMSO. Immunoblot analysis of HL-60 membranes and cytosol was used to assess the amount of specific phagocyte oxidase factors (91 and 22 kDa subunits of membrane cytochrome b558 (gp91 and p22), and 47 and 67 kDa cytosol oxidase factors (p47 and p67)). HL-60 cell membranes or cytosol were tested in a cell-free assay of superoxide production by mixing with normal neutrophil cytosol or membranes, respectively. p47 was first detected at 16 h of differentiation, increasing similarly thereafter with all induction regimens and reaching a maximum by 3 to 4 days. The earliest detection of p67 varied from 2 to 6 days depending on the inducing agent and appeared to be the limiting cytosol component. Small amounts of both subunits of cytochrome b558 were detected in uninduced HL-60 membranes, but were sufficient to support substantial superoxide production when combined with normal neutrophil cytosol. Both cytochrome b558 subunit proteins and membrane oxidase activity increased during differentiation in parallel. We conclude that membrane and cytosol components of the NADPH oxidase complex appear at different times and increase differently during HL-60 differentiation. The production of p67 is the major factor limiting the respiratory burst during HL-60 differentiation.\r"

This inhibition of monocyte activation is caused in a dose-dependent manner by a soluble substance elaborated into the cell supernatant after inoculation of monocytes with L. donovani and is referred to as activation suppressing factor (ASF). ASF activity can be abrogated by dialysis and by treatment with a proteinase, indicating that ASF is a small peptide.\r"

Cells were harvested between 0 and 24 days and tested for their ability to kill schistosomula of Schistosoma mansoni in vitro as a measure of activation. Freshly isolated monocytes showed no significant cytotoxic activity in the presence or absence of IFN-gamma or LPS. As the cells matured in vitro, there was a slight increase in their inherent toxicity against the parasite, which was greatly enhanced by pretreatment with either IFN-gamma or CSF-1. Optimal antibody-independent larvicidal activity occurred after stimulation with both IFN-gamma and CSF-1, using cells that had matured for at least 7 days in vitro. Under these conditions, killing of up to 70% of the larvae was observed. Although enhanced larvicidal activity was not found to strictly correlate with production of any of several proposed effector molecules examined, activated monocyte-derived macrophages were capable of producing significant amounts of H2O2 and TNF-alpha. These observations indicate that cytokine-activated human monocyte-derived macrophages are able to kill schistosome larvae by an antibody-independent mechanism, as has been observed using murine peritoneal macrophages. Stimulation with multiple differentiation and activation signals, as would occur in vivo, may be required for development of optimal larvicidal activity.\r"

We report that macrophages from schistosomal egg granulomas did not efficiently stimulate, but rather induced marked proliferative unresponsiveness to Ag in an IL-2-producing, I-Ek-restricted, CD4+ Th cell clone specific for pigeon cytochrome c. The unresponsive state of the T cells was achieved after incubation with granuloma macrophages in the presence of the specific Ag fragment 81-104, but not with either of them independently, and was, similarly, restricted by the I-Ek molecule. Equivalent amounts of peritoneal macrophages from schistosome-infected, but not from normal mice, were also effective in inducing T cell unresponsiveness. We postulate that granuloma macrophages, and potentially other accessory cells in schistosome-infected individuals, are similarly capable of inducing anergy in egg Ag-specific Th cells, and that the resulting inhibited T cell reactivity, which translates into failure of lymphokine secretion and of clonal expansion, represents a major basis of the immunologic down-regulation (immunomodulation) of granulomatous hypersensitivity, characteristically seen in this disease.\r"

Nuclei were isolated at various times after stimulation with SAC. Stimulation with SAC resulted in significant increase in the transcription of all of the genes. Maximum expression of the c-fos, transferrin receptor, DR beta, and DQ beta genes was obtained within 0.5 h after stimulation. Maximum expression of c-myc and Blast-1 was obtained within 3 h. Peak expression of Ig kappa was observed at 8 h. Transcriptional activities of all genes examined, except for the Blast-1 and Ig kappa, decreased rapidly after their respective peaks; they remained at higher levels than their base line. Inhibition of protein synthesis by cycloheximide did not significantly affect the kinetics of transcription of these genes.

Forty individual C kappa+ phages were tested for hybridization with DNA probes representing 11 V kappa region groups. Of the phage inserts large enough to contain V kappa region sequences, 3 were negative for hybridization with all 11 V kappa region probes. The inserts from those three were subcloned, sequenced, and compared with V kappa region sequences in the gene bank. One was identical to 87.92.6 for the region sequenced (a member of V kappa RF). The second showed 93.8% sequence similarity with AN04 and called V kappa 32. The third called V kappa 33 showed 76% sequence similarity with the human sequence V52 and 73.2% sequence similarity with the mouse sequence L6. An insert from V kappa 32 containing the 5' untranslated regions through the codon for Cys 88 of the V kappa region was used as a probe in Southern blot analysis of genomic DNA from inbred and congenic strains of mice. V kappa 32 is a four to eight member group and some of the members are retained in the B6.PL-Ly2a congenic and missing from the B6.PL (85NS) congenic consistent with a map location near V kappa 28. The same filters were hybridized with the insert from V kappa 33 containing 5' untranslated region through the codon for Ser 93 of the V kappa region. V kappa 33 is a one to three member group and using the B6.PL congenics maps with the polymorphic fragments of V kappa 32 and V kappa 28.\r"

Two Ig VH pseudogenes containing latent a3 regions have been cloned from the genome of a homozygous a2 rabbit. Analysis of the regions associated with allotype expression indicates that these two pseudogenes contain VHa- sequences in framework region 1 (FR1) and VHa3 sequences in FR3. One gene has undergone an unusual rearrangement with a third VH gene, deleting their intervening sequences and recombining in FR3 with sequences 5' to the leader exon. Our results demonstrate the presence of latent VH sequences in the genomic DNA of normal rabbits and suggest that a mechanism such as gene conversion is responsible for expression of genetically-unexpected Ig VH genes.\r"

  ".U": "91010753\r", 
  ".W": "A set of high affinity antidigoxin antibodies were previously identified with high homologous V kappa 1A L chain sequences but were associated with two entirely different VH regions and two dramatically different specificities for digoxin analogs. Antibodies 40-20, 40-60, 40-90, and 40-100 displayed similar binding specificities but differed from that of antibody 26-10. In a previous study using somatic cell fusion for Ig chain recombination we demonstrated that a recombinant antibody consisting of the H chain of antibody 26-10 and the L chain of antibody 40-20 retained digoxin binding and the 26-10 Id, but displayed a binding specificity pattern dominated by the 26-10 H chain donor. In the present study we produced three additional chain recombinant antibodies that contain the 26-10 H chain recombined with each of the L chains of antibodies 40-60, 40-90, and 40-100. All four recombinants expressed the 26-10 Id indistinguishably from the 26-10 antibody. Two of the recombinants (using the 40-60 and 40-90 L chains) bind digoxin; however, the recombinant using the 40-100 L chain failed to bind digoxin. Complete sequence analyses of the 40-20, 40-60, 40-90, and 40-100 VH and VL regions were performed. Antibodies 40-90 and 40-100 have identical VH region sequences but differed only in their L chains at position 96 (proline/leucine). This single difference at the VK-JK junction abolished digoxin binding in the context of one H chain (26-10), but does not cause a significant change in binding in association with the \"normal\" parental chains 40-90 and 40-100. Thus, structurally closely related VL regions can recombine with different VH regions to form digoxin binding sites of different specificity; in one binding site the identity of a L chain junctional residue is critical whereas in the second binding site that residue is unimportant. Molecular modeling studies revealed major differences between calculated binding site structures for 26-10 when leucine is substituted for proline at position 96 in the 26-10 VL region.\r"

The results indicate that CD5+ B cells obtained from both adult and neonatal animals express Q52 at increased levels compared with CD5- B cells. Preferential expression of VH 7183 was observed only in the neonatal CD5- B cell subset. Thus, the increased expression of VH 7183 early in development is caused by the CD5- subset whereas increased Q52 expression is caused by the CD5+ subset.

  ".W": "To better understand heterogeneity of human VH genes, we have studied polymorphism among three homologous genes from VH3, the most complex human VH gene family. Sequence-specific oligonucleotide probes were used to identify the germ-line source of each gene. The fetally expressed gene 56p1, and the germ-line VH element 1.9III, were identified and shown to be distinct. Also identified was T5M10, a VH element that resembles 56p1 and 1.9III, and likely corresponds to the previously described germ-line gene, hv3005. The elements 56p1, 1.9III, and T5M10 were each polymorphic, and in 52 unrelated individuals, their prevalences were 62%, 92%, and 35%, respectively. Among individuals lacking the hybridization bands characteristic of 56p1, 1.9III, or T5M10, alternative RFLP or coding region sequence variants were not found. In the population studied, these three VH elements were present in five different combinations, and at least three haplotypes. The distribution of these VH elements indicated they are not alleles of a single locus, and 56p1 and 1.9III are probably not alleles of each other. These results suggest that polymorphism is commonplace among human VH3 genes, but that a limited number of conserved alleles dominate each locus. We conclude that heterogeneity in the VH germ-line repertoire may derive more from diversity of haplotypes than from diversity of alleles.\r"

We derived stable subclones representative of each phenotype and we showed by molecular analysis that they expressed the same TCR. Utilization of either CD3 or anticlonotypic mAb revealed that this TCR expressed by the four subclones was functional.\r"

  ".U": "91010766\r", 
  ".W": "We have examined the expression of TCR genes in 4-hydroxy-3-nitrophenyl-acetyl (NP)-specific Ts cell hybridomas. Each of three independently isolated hybridomas expressed in-frame TCR alpha-chain rearrangements derived from the original suppressor Ts cell. Different V alpha and J alpha gene segments were rearranged and expressed in each Ts cell line. The only TCR beta-chain expressed in these cells was derived from the BW5147 fusion partner. Expression of the BW5147 beta-chain was found to correlate with cell surface Ag binding, inasmuch as subclones derived from one of the original Ts lines expressed greatly reduced levels of beta-chain mRNA and no longer bound to NP-coupled RBC. Subclones that continued to express beta-chain mRNA did bind to NP-coupled RBC. This suggests that the Ag receptor on Ts hybridomas is a TCR-alpha beta dimer composed of a unique alpha-chain and the BW5147 beta-chain. Ag binding could be modulated by preincubation of Ts hybridoma cells with anti-TCR-alpha beta antibody, thereby supporting this conclusion. Suppressor factor activity was measured in the conditioned media of Ts subclones that differed by 250-fold in levels of beta-chain mRNA expression. No difference in suppressor factor activity was found; conditioned media from these subclones suppressed both plaque-forming cell responses and delayed-type hypersensitivity responses at approximately equivalent dilutions. Suppressor factor activity in the conditioned media of both a beta-chain negative subclone and a beta-chain positive subclone could be absorbed with an antibody that recognizes the TCR alpha-chain, but not with an antibody that recognizes the TCR beta-chain. We conclude that suppressor factor activity in the conditioned media of these Ts hybridomas is not derived from surface TCR-alpha beta receptors, although it does share TCR alpha-chain determinants.\r"

E rosette separated total T cells and CD3+CD4-CD8-TCR alpha beta- double-negative (DN) T cells were cocultured with allogeneic or autologous PBMC stimulator cells, and frequencies of alloreactive and autoreactive CLP were determined after 12 to 14 days against Con A blast target cells. Freshly isolated DN cells consisting of 82.3 +/- 8.2% gamma delta+ T cells did not exert cytolytic activity against K562 or anti-TCR gamma delta mAb-producing hybridoma cells. In striking contrast to E+ cells, the vast majority of alloantigen-stimulated clonally developing DN CLP did not show specificity for stimulator-derived target cells. Thus, frequencies of alloreactive and autoreactive CLP after alloantigenic stimulation were in the range of 1/100 to 1/4800 and 1/450 to 1/5000, respectively. After coculture with autologous stimulator cells, frequencies of autoreactive and alloreactive DN CLP were 1/700 to 1/2700 and 1/1360 to 1/4500, respectively. Split culture analysis revealed that most proliferating DN colonies selected for high probability of clonality simultaneously killed both autologous and HLA-mismatched allogeneic targets. The majority of the DN cells expressed the CD3+/TCR gamma delta+ phenotype after culture, and thus were not CD2+CD3- NK cells. Taken together, our results show that 1) freshly isolated peripheral blood gamma delta+ T cells lack cytotoxic activity, and 2) most cytotoxic gamma delta+ T cells activated by autologous or allogeneic stimulator cells under limiting dilution conditions do not discriminate between autologous and allogeneic targets.\r"

  ".W": "Cloned Ts cells specific for the Ag, human monoclonal (myeloma) IgG, were derived from spleen cells of mice that had been immunosuppressed by treatment with a tolerogenic conjugate of HIgG and monomethoxypolyethylene glycol. The cloned Ts cells (clone 23.32) suppressed in vitro antibody responses in an Ag-specific and MHC-restricted manner. By FMF with appropriate antibody reagents, these cells were shown to be Thy-1+, CD4-, CD5-, and CD8+ and to express CD3 and the alpha beta-TCR. These results are consistent with the view that Ts cells use Ag recognition structures similar to those reported for Th cells and CTL. A soluble factor (TsF) extracted from the cloned Ts cells also suppressed in vitro antibody responses in an Ag-specific and H-2Kd-restricted manner, i.e., restricted to MHC class I molecules. The suppressive activity of this TsF could be abrogated by addition of mAb H28-710 that reacts with a determinant on the alpha-chain of TCR. Moreover, the TsF bound to and could be recovered from an immunosorbent consisting of the anti-alpha-TCR mAb H28-710 coupled to Sepharose 4B. In contrast, the TsF was not bound by immunosorbents consisting of mAb to the beta-chain of TCR (H57-597) or to V beta 8 (F23.1). It was, therefore, concluded that the TsF of clone 23.32 is serologically related to the alpha-chain of the TCR; however, it is not identical to TCR, because it lacks the determinants expressed on the TCR beta-chain that are recognized by the two anti-beta mAbs used in this study.\r"

  ".U": "91010776\r", 
  ".W": "Adhesion of lymphocytes to endothelial cells (EC) is the requisite first element in the multistep process of transmigration from blood across the postcapillary venules. Selective expression of cell adhesion molecules (CM) by microvascular EC in lymphoid organs (e.g., lymph nodes) and during tissue inflammation modulates this traffic in a site-directed manner. CAM synthesis by EC is regulated in turn by cytokines released in the local microenvironment. Studies done largely with human umbilical vein EC have implicated IL-1, IFN-gamma, and TNF-alpha as cytokines which promote leukocyte adhesion to EC. In the work reported here, the responses of cultured microvascular EC derived from macaque lymph nodes to IL-1beta, IL-2, IFN-gamma, and IL-4 were examined. Increases in lymphocyte adhesion after preculture of microvascular EC in IL-1beta or IFN-gamma were typically 2-to 4-fold above controls and comparable to those reported for human umbilical vein EC. IL-2 had no effect. In contrast, IL-4 markedly enhanced adhesion to microvascular EC. IL-4-induced adhesion was observed as early as 4 h after induction, plateaued by 24 h, was stable through 72 h of culture, but decayed to basal levels within 72 h after removal of IL-4 from the cultures. IL-1beta, but not IL-2 or IFN-gamma, synergistically enhanced the action of IL-4 on cultured microvascular EC to promote lymphocyte binding. Adhesion triggered in this manner required de novo protein synthesis. However, the avidity of IL-4-activated microvascular EC for lymphocytes, and analyses of kinetics, cation and temperature dependence, and/or lack of blockade with mAb to endothelial leukocyte adhesion molecule-1, intra-cellular adhesion molecule-1, and MECA-79 indicated that these CAM were not central to the phenomenon. To aid identification of the relevant CAM, mAb specific to IL-4-induced microvascular EC were produced. One of these, 6G10, blocked up to 90% of lymphocyte adhesion to IL-4-induced microvascular EC, immunoprecipitated an IL-4-induced cell-surface molecule of 110-kDa molecular mass, and reacted specifically with Chinese hamster ovary cells transfected with human vascular cell adhesion molecule-1. Our results suggest that IL-4 may have potent effects on lymphocyte recirculation in vivo.\r"

On monocytic cell lines (U937, HL60) and peripheral blood monocytes, IFN-gamma-binding capacity was down-regulated upon incubation with GM-CSF. Scatchard plot analyses revealed that down-regulation was caused by a decrease in IFN-gamma-R number rather than by a change in affinity. GM-CSF treatment did not reduce IFN-gamma-R-specific mRNA levels, but reduced the half-life of membrane-expressed IFN-gamma-R, indicating a post-translational control of IFN-gamma-R by GM-CSF. Because both IFN-gamma and GM-CSF are crucially involved in activation of monocytic function, the data presented suggest that down-regulation of IFN-gamma-R by GM-CSF may represent a potential negative feedback control of monocyte activation. Further studies of IFN-gamma binding characteristics and isolation of IFN-gamma-R by immunoprecipitation revealed that IFN-gamma binding to human peripheral blood monocytes is mediated by a receptor protein structurally and functionally identical to that previously characterized in several established cell lines of other tissue origin.\r"

To determine if the lymphokine IFN-gamma has a similar pathogenic role during endotoxic shock, mice were pretreated with murine rIFN-gamma (rMuIFN-gamma) at various times relative to challenge with Salmonella enteritidis LPS. Subsequent mortality was increased when rMuIFN-gamma was administered before or up to 4 h after endotoxin challenge. Pretreatment with rMuIFN-gamma resulted in nearly fivefold increases in serum TNF during endotoxemia, but TNF levels were unaffected by IFN administered after endotoxin. The increased levels of serum TNF probably reflected enhanced translation of this factor, as tissue expression of TNF mRNA did not increase correspondingly in IFN-pretreated mice. To examine the role of IFN-gamma produced endogenously during endotoxemia, mice were pretreated with 0.5 mg of anti-IFN-gamma mAb before endotoxin injection. This treatment significantly reduced mortality from endotoxic shock but caused only minor decreases in serum TNF. Anti-IFN-gamma administered 2 h after endotoxin was similarly protective. These results demonstrate a significant role for IFN-gamma in the pathology of septic shock, both indirectly as an activator of monokines known to promote lethality and possibly by other, late-acting mechanisms.\r"

  ".W": "Hybridomas were produced from a rat that was immunized with partially purified proteins from supernatants of induced Th2 cells. These preparations were enriched for cytokine synthesis inhibitory factor (CSIF, IL-10). The mAb in the supernatants were screened by a solid phase radioimmunoadsorbent assay using 35S-methionine-labeled secreted proteins from a lectin-stimulated Th2 clone. A total of 18 anticytokine mAb were isolated, comprising 6 anti-CSIF, 1 anti-IL-4, 1 anti-IL-5, and 10 anti-IL-6 mAb. The anti-CSIF mAb were separable into three groups. mAb in groups A and B neutralized and depleted bioactivity, and bound to overlapping but nonidentical subpopulations of CSIF molecules. The 2 mAb in group C did not neutralize CSIF activity, and bound to CSIF molecules not recognized by mAb from groups A or B. A two-site sandwich ELISA for CSIF could be established with the group A antibody, SXC1, combined with any of the three group B antibodies. The sensitivity of this assay was equivalent to that of the CSIF bioassay. These antibodies have been used to show that CSIF is responsible for most or all of the ability of Th2 supernatants to inhibit cytokine synthesis by Th1 cells. In addition, the ELISA has been used to confirm that CSIF is produced by Th2 but not Th1 clones.\r"

The remaining 10 (3 IgA, 4 IgM, and 3 IgG1) were more firmly bound; they came off with pH-values ranging from 5.0 to 3.5. They all expressed VH genes of families J606 or S107, whereas all the 15 Ig that were not firmly bound expressed VH genes of six other families. The VL domains seem to be unimportant for protein A binding inasmuch as a firmly binding and a weakly binding IgG1 antibody share identical VK domains.

  ".W": "Nine groove-type mAb to alpha(1----6)dextran were cloned and sequenced. Together with previous reports from this laboratory, the VH and VL of 34 mAb have been sequenced, in which 10 VH19.1.2 and 11 VH9.14.7 combined with the V kappa-Ox1 gene to form two major families of anti-alpha(1----6)dextrans. The same D minigene (DFL16) was used by all VH19.1.2 and VH9.14.7 mAb; however, the patterns of JH and J kappa usage are quite different. VH19.1.2 mAb used only JH3 and J kappa 2, whereas VH9.14.7 mAb used three JH (JH1, JH2, and JH3) and all four active J kappa (J kappa 1, J kappa 2, J kappa 4, and J kappa 5). Relative uniformity in the lengths of VH CDR3 and the junctional sequences is seen in both families. Some mAb from different mouse strains share common structural features. The differences in idiotypic specificities and in the amino acid sequences suggest that VH19.1.2 and VH9.14.7 may differ in the conformation of CDR1 and CDR2. Combining with V kappa-Ox1 gene to generate groove-type combining sites to the single site-filling epitope of alpha(1----6)dextran, the two VH chains may require certain conformations of CDR3. Whether such conformational requirements influence the choice of J minigenes, the selection of the length of VH CDR3 and the sequences at junctions, are discussed.\r"

  ".W": "Over the last few years, several studies showing that production of superoxide by neutrophils in response to chemotactic factors such as FMLP is enhanced after preincubation of the cells with granulocyte-macrophage (GM)-CSF or TNF-alpha have been published. Subsequent reports have indicated that this effect of the cytokines may be mediated by modulation of the number and/or affinity of surface receptors for FMLP. In the present study we have investigated the effect of preincubation with GM-CSF and TNF-alpha on the oxidative burst induced by sodium fluoride and guanosine 5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) (GTP gamma S)-agents which directly activate guanine-nucleotide binding proteins in neutrophils. Pretreatment of neutrophils with either GM-CSF or TNF-alpha dose-dependently enhanced the production of superoxide induced by NaF, as determined by the superoxide dismutase-inhibitable reduction of ferricytochrome c. Furthermore, preincubation of neutrophils with these cytokines enhanced the production of hydrogen peroxide induced by GTP gamma S in electroporated neutrophils. Because both NaF and GTP gamma S directly activate G proteins independently of external receptor-G protein interaction, these results imply that both GM-CSF and TNF-alpha alter the neutrophil signal transduction pathway in response to subsequent agonists independently of a modulation in the expression of the cell surface receptors for such agonists.\r"

P. magnus strain 644, which does not synthesize protein L, did not induce histamine secretion. Soluble protein L (3 x 10(-2) to 3 micrograms/ml) induced histamine release from human basophils. The characteristics of the release reaction were similar to those of rabbit IgG anti-Fc fragment of human IgE (anti-IgE): it was Ca2(+)- and temperature-dependent, optimal release occurring at 37 degrees C in the presence of 1.0 mM extracellular Ca2+. There was an excellent correlation (r = 0.82; p less than 0.001) between the maximal percent histamine release induced by protein L and that induced by anti-IgE, as well as between protein L and protein A from Staphylococcus aureus (r = 0.52; p less than 0.01). Preincubation of basophils with either protein L or anti-IgE resulted in complete cross-desensitization to a subsequent challenge with the heterologous stimulus. IgE purified from myeloma patients PS and PP (lambda-chains) blocked anti-IgE-induced histamine release but failed to block the histamine releasing activity of protein L. In contrast, IgE purified from myeloma patient ADZ (kappa-chains) blocked both anti-IgE- and protein L-induced releases, whereas human polyclonal IgG selectively blocked protein L-induced secretion. Protein L acted as a complete secretagogue, i.e., it activated basophils to release sulfidopeptide leukotriene C4 as well as histamine. Protein L (10(-1) to 3 micrograms/ml) also induced the release of preformed (histamine) and de novo synthesized mediators (leukotriene C4 and/or PGD2) from mast cells isolated from lung parenchyma and skin tissues. Intradermal injections of protein L (0.01 to 10 micrograms/ml) in nonallergic subjects caused a dose-dependent wheal-and-flare reaction. Protein L activates human basophils and mast cells in vitro and in vivo presumably by interacting with kappa L chains of the IgE isotype.\r"

A conjugate vaccine of Haemophilus influenzae PRP coupled to the outer membrane protein complex (OMPC) of Neisseria meningitidis serogroup B is immunogenic in children as young as 2 mo of age and is immunogenic in infant rhesus monkeys, an animal model for infant humans. In the present study, PRP-OMPC was found to induce efficient IgM to IgG switching of anti-PRP serum antibody in adult mice, whereas PRP conjugated to two other protein carriers did not. Thus the PRP-OMPC conjugate was examined in order to determine why PRP coupled to OMPC was so immunogenic, even more immunogenic than conjugates made with other carrier proteins. The OMPC carrier differs from the other protein carriers in that the proteins are present in a liposomal form containing lipids (including LPS) derived from the outer membrane of N. meningitidis. We studied the OMPC to see whether the different components or the nature of the OMPC carrier could contribute to its enhanced immunogenicity. Specifically we evaluated the OMPC for both classic Th cell carrier activity and adjuvanticity, and the LPS component of OMPC for systemic polyclonal B cell activation. Carrier recognition of the OMPC moiety of PRP-OMPC was demonstrated. In addition the PRP-OMPC conjugate vaccine was observed to have adjuvant properties for both T cell-dependent and T cell-independent Ag in the absence of LPS-induced systemic polyclonal B cell activation. These observations suggest that in addition to functioning as a classic protein carrier whereby the proteins in OMPC provide Th cell epitopes, the OMPC also has adjuvant activity that distinguishes it from other protein carriers and may contribute to the increased immunogenicity of PRP-OMPC conjugates in animal models.\r"

  ".W": "A monoclonal human anti-soluble schistosomal egg Ag(SEA) antibody (E5) that stimulates anti-Id T cells and is idiotypically represented in pools of immunoaffinity-purified human anti-SEA antibodies from chronic, generally asymptomatic, intestinal (INT) patients (AM1 and AM5) was used to raise several monoclonal anti-Id: 1C2, 1C6, 4A8, 4F9, and 2A7. Cross-inhibition between these anti-Id identified distinct idiotopes on E5. Anti-SEA preparations from schistosomiasis patients (AM1, AM5, and others) were tested for their inhibition of the E5/monoclonal anti-Id reactions, in competitive ELISA. In either the E5/4A8 or E5/1C6 ELISA system, anti-SEA from INT (AM1 or AM5) or hepatointestinal (HI) (AM7) patients were able to inhibit these reactions. However, anti-SEA antibodies from acute (AM9) or hepatosplenic (HS) (AM3 or AM8) patients did not express Id that were inhibitory in these systems. These results suggest that a relatively high proportion of INT and HI anti-SEA antibodies express a dominant cross-reactive idiotope (CRI) recognized by 1C6/4A8. This CRI is also easily detected in plasmas from individual INT patients. Anti-Id 1C2 reacted strongly with an Id in AM1, AM5, or AM7, but one which also occurred, to a lesser extent, in AM3, AM8, and AM9. Monoclonal anti-Id 4F9 and 2A7 reacted weakly with idiotopes expressed by antibodies from all patients, regardless of the clinical form of their infection. These observations indicate that anti-SEA antibodies from INT and HI, but not acute or HS patients express dominant, CRI that are identified by 1C6, 4A8, or 1C2 and are also expressed on the INT-derived anti-SEA mAb E5.\r"

To characterize the nature of the T cell inflammatory infiltrate in American cutaneous leishmaniasis lesions, immunohistochemistry with mAb that define T cell subpopulations and in situ hybridization to detect mRNA coding for IFN-gamma were performed. In both localized cutaneous (LCL) and mucocutaneous (MCL) lesions, we observed a predominance of T memory (CD4+CD45RO+) as compared to T naive cells (CD+CD45RA+). The percentages of cells containing IFN-gamma mRNA were equivalent in both LCL and MCL lesions. T cells were extracted from LCL and MCL lesions and analysis indicated that T cells from both lesions had been stimulated by L. (V.) braziliensis in vivo and gave equivalent proliferative responses in vitro. The present data suggest that T memory cells, which are likely to elaborate IFN-gamma, are components of DTH response to L.

Recent reports have suggested that target cell lysis by cytotoxic lymphocytes occurs by either a calcium dependent and/or a calcium-independent mechanism(s). To determine the role of calcium in NK and NC activities of the NKB61A2 cell line, we evaluated the effect of: 1) extracellular Ca2+ depletion by the divalent cation chelator, EGTA, 2) Ca2+ influx blockade by the Ca2+ channel blocker verapamil, and 3) blocking of intracellular Ca2+ mobilization by 3,4,5-trimethoxybenzoic acid 8-(diethylamino)octyl ester (TMB-8). We found that EGTA, verapamil, and TMB-8 were all capable of inhibiting NK activity, but they had little effect on NC activity of the NKB61A2 cells. Using 1-(5-isoquinolinylsulfonyl)-2-methylpiperazine and N-(6-aminohexyl)-5-chloro-1-naphthalenesulfonamide which are inhibitors of protein kinase C and calmodulin respectively, we determined that protein kinase C and calmodulin do play a role in the NK activity of NKB61A2 cells. 1-(5-isoquinolinylsulfonyl)-2-methylpiperazine and N-(6-aminohexyl)-5-chloro-1-naphthalanesulfonamide, similar to Verapamil and TMB-8, had no effect on NC activity. Thus, the data indicate that the NK activity of NKB61A2 cells is calcium dependent whereas NC activity is not. These results may explain the disparate reports seen in the literature of calcium-dependent and -independent lysis of tumor cells.\r"

After the ears of recipient mice were painted with 1% trinitrochlorobenzene, we observed an ear-swelling response peaking at 24-48 h. The ear-swelling response was hapten specific. CD8- but not CD4-depleted T cells mediated strong contact sensitivity. Systemic adoptive transfer into nude mice also lead to a hapten-specific delayed ear-swelling response. However, this response was less protracted than in euthymic animals, suggesting the participation of the recipient (non-immunized) T cells in the ear-swelling response of the euthymic mice. Lymphokine analysis of in vitro primed and restimulated T cells revealed predominant production of interleukin-2 but little or no interleukin-4. These in vitro primed cells therefore resemble type 1 or inflammatory T helper cell clones.\r"

This paper is a report of our investigations into whether similar mechanisms for cell cohesion and desquamation can be found in non-palmo-plantar stratum corneum. Biopsies of non-palmo-plantar human skin were incubated at 37 degrees C, pH 8, in a buffer with and without additions of detergents (a mixture of N,N-dimethyldodecylamine oxide and sodium dodecyl sulphate), ethylene diamine tetraacetate (EDTA), and the proteinase inhibitor aprotinin. Released cells were examined by phase contrast microscopy and counted. The incubated biopsies were examined by light microscopy. As has been previously shown by others, we found that in the presence of detergents there was a dissociation of stratum corneum cells. This dissociation was stimulated by EDTA and inhibited by aprotinin. After 36 h of incubation the entire stratum corneum and, on some parts of the biopsies, the stratum granulosum had dissociated. There was no evidence of cell dissociation in the spinous or basal epidermal layers. We conclude that the detergent-induced cell dissociation in non-palmo-plantar human stratum corneum is dependent on the action of proteinases present in the tissue on protein structures. These structures may be of significant importance for non-palmo-plantar stratum corneum cell cohesion.\r"

Fifteen healthy mongrel dogs underwent short-term exercise testing before and after a 12-week period of exercise training (n = 8) or cage confinement (n = 7). ANF, norepinephrine, epinephrine, right atrial pressure, and heart rate were measured simultaneously at rest and during exercise at the time of each acute exercise study. Data were analyzed for all animals with normal baseline ANF values. Exercise training had no modulating effect on circulating ANF levels at rest or during exercise. Therefore, data before and after exercise training or cage confinement were grouped (n = 24) to determine the effects of short-term exercise. ANF levels increased from 49 +/- 2 pg/ml at rest to 60 +/- 4 pg/ml during exercise (p less than 0.05). Heart rate, norepinephrine, and epinephrine values also increased, but right atrial pressure actually decreased from 2.3 +/- 0.9 mm Hg at rest to -3.8 +/- 0.9 mm Hg during exercise (p less than 0.05). There was no correlation between ANF concentrations and levels of these other variables either at rest of during exercise. By demonstrating an increase in ANF with a simultaneous decrease in right atrial pressure, this study clearly shows that increased right atrial pressure is not the secretory stimulus for ANF release during exercise in the normal dog. The lack of correlation between ANF and right atrial pressure, heart rate, norepinephrine, and epinephrine levels suggests that factors other than these variables stimulate ANF release during short-term exercise.\r"

  ".W": "Transition metals, particularly iron, will potentiate oxidant damage to isolated cell organelles, plasma membranes, and DNA when added to in vitro incubation systems. However, similar studies of intact cells have been hampered by the relative impermeability of whole cells to iron. We have iron loaded cultured endothelial cells by using the iron-chelating fungistat 8-hydroxyquinoline (8HQ). 8HQ forms lipophilic chelates with iron and rapidly transfers the metal across the intact plasma membrane of endothelial cells. After brief exposure to 8HQ and subsequent thorough washing of endothelial cells, the cell-associated iron cannot be removed by the powerful chelator deferoxamine, clearly indicating the intracellular location of 8HQ-transported iron. Iron-loaded cells (but not cells exposed to high concentrations of 8HQ or iron separately) are extremely sensitive to oxidants (1) produced externally by phorbol-stimulated granulocytes, (2) generated intracellularly by menadione, or (3) added as H2O2. In the latter instance, as little as 7 mumol/L H2O2 provokes destruction of approximately 50% of iron-loaded endothelial cells, whereas untreated endothelium readily survives exposure to H2O2 concentrations as high as 2 mmol/L. Cytotoxicity is accompanied by membrane lipid peroxidation (formation of thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances). Both cytotoxicity and lipid peroxidation are inhibited by the lipophilic 21-aminosteroid U74500A (\"lazaroid\") (50% inhibitory concentration = approximately 0.5 mumol/L), whereas deferoxamine (250 mumol/L) is ineffective (suggesting iron intercalation into hydrophobic domains of the cell). We conclude that this pharmacologic model for iron loading of intact cells may yield valuable insights into the pathogenic importance of intracellular iron in iron overload states, inflammation, and cellular injury.\r"

This technique is based on agarose gel isoelectric focusing of paired CSF and serum samples diluted to the same IgG concentration, and transfer of the specific IgG antibodies onto mycobacterial antigen-loaded nitrocellulose sheets. An intrathecal synthesis of anti-mycobacterial oligoclonal IgG antibodies, often superimposed on diffuse polyclonal production was shown in all patients but not in patients with tension headache or other neurological disorders. Similar results were obtained when a purified mycobacterial antigen, A60, was used for coating the nitrocellulose sheets in place of a whole mycobacterial homogenate, indicating that A60 was a major immunogen. The number of anti-mycobacterial oligoclonal IgG bands increased with time, and persisted for years even in clinically cured patients. Some IgG bands had no detectable anti-mycobacterial activity, at least with the antigens preparations used in this study. The demonstration of such anti-mycobacterial IgG bands in the CSF could be a useful adjunct for the diagnosis of tuberculous meningitis, especially in the case of negative cultures.\r"

The average length of stay was 16.6 days. Discharges were delayed in 14% (11/80) patients, accounting for 21% of the total days stay. Patients whose discharge was delayed tended to be older, to have delirium and/or dementia, to more often come from or require transfer to long term care (LTC) institutions, and/or to be dependent in essential activities of daily living. The 4-Score, an index for predicting non-medical days, was useful in identifying patients at risk for delays in discharge, and had a sensitivity of 0.82, and a specificity of 0.90. Interventions to reduce delays in discharge must address the frail nature of the patients, their lack of support and existing administrative relationships with LTC institutions. Acute care hospitals will likely need to undertake formal programs for the long term care of many of these patients.\r"

  ".W": "This study investigated the effects of sequentially administered recombinant interferon gamma (rIFN gamma) and recombinant interferon alfa (rIFN alpha) in 36 patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC). rIFN alpha was subcutaneously administered daily for 70 days at dosages that varied (2.5, 5, 10, and 20 x 10(6) U/m2) across four cohorts of patients. Within each cohort of patients receiving a given dose of rIFN alpha, three subsets of patients received either 30, 300, or 1,000 micrograms/m2 rIFN gamma. rIFN gamma was administered intravenously for 5 days every third week, 6 hours prior to administration of rIFN alpha. Dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) included constitutional symptoms, leukopenia, nephrotic syndrome with acute renal failure, hypotension associated with death, and congestive heart failure. DLT was related more often to the rIFN alpha dose level than to rIFN gamma dose level. Maximum-tolerated dose (MTD) was 10 x 10(6) U/m2 rIFN alpha and 1,000 micrograms/m2 rIFN gamma. Six patients failed to complete a minimum of 21 days of therapy due to toxicity or rapid progression of disease. Clinical responses were seen in eight of 30 assessable patients. Two patients experienced complete remission and have remained in complete remission 20+ and 22+ months. An additional six patients have shown partial responses for 4 to 18+ months. One patient in partial remission continues to show slow regression of pulmonary and liver lesions off therapy with rIFNs. Clinical responses have remained durable for patients with complete remissions and patients with partial remissions. The results of this study suggest that toxicities associated with combination rIFN therapy can be reduced by administering these agents sequentially as opposed to simultaneously.\r"

Twenty-two patients with metastatic cancer had received cisplatin-based chemotherapy, and the median follow-up was 64 months (range, 42 to 100 months). Nine patients without metastases were treated with orchiectomy alone, and follow-up in this group was a median of 61 months (range, 40 to 77 months). None of the patients have relapsed and retroperitoneal lymph node dissection was not performed in any patient. Both the concentration of spermatozoa and the volume of the remaining testis are significantly reduced in patients who had previously received chemotherapy when compared with patients treated with orchiectomy alone (P less than .05). There were no significant differences between groups when comparing morphology, motility, and penetration of the spermatozoa. Subclinical Leydig cell dysfunction with normal testosterone and elevated luteinizing hormone (LH) was observed in one patient (11%) treated with orchiectomy alone, while 59% of the patients who had received chemotherapy had elevated LH (P less than .05). We conclude that cisplatin-based chemotherapy leads to a persistent impairment of fertility and Leydig cell function in the majority of patients with testicular cancer.\r"

Cerebral oxygenation was monitored by fiberoptic catheter oximetry, which allowed simultaneous measurements of arterial and jugular bulb oxyhemoglobin saturation. Intracranial pressure levels over 20 mm Hg were recorded several times in all patients, in spite of sedation, muscle paralysis, and profound hyperventilation. Intracranial hypertension was frequently associated with oligemic cerebral hypoxia, identified as abnormally low jugular oxygen saturation in the presence of normal arterial oxygenation. Intracranial hypertension was then managed with intravenous administration of mannitol boluses, which yielded simultaneous decreases in intracranial pressure and increases in cerebral oxygenation to highly statistically significant levels. Monitoring cerebral oxygenation was clinically useful because it allowed identification of impaired cerebral oxygenation even when cerebral perfusion pressure was normal. It is therefore proposed as a new monitoring technique, to supplement conventional monitoring of cerebral perfusion pressure.\r"

In the present study, interactions of LDL with human malignant glioma cell lines (U-251 MG and KMG-5) were investigated biochemically and morphologically. The LDL, labeled with the fluorescent dyes 1,1'-dioctadecyl-3,3,3',3'-tetramethylindocarbocyanine (DiI) and fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC), was internalized by both cell processes and cell bodies. Reductive methylation of DiI-labeled LDL, which abolishes the ability of the cell to bind to the LDL receptor, prevented the internalization of the cholesterol moiety of LDL. Cellular binding of 125I-LDL to U-251 MG cells at 4 degrees C revealed the presence of a specific saturable-associated receptor (dissociation constant (Kd) approximately 38 micrograms/ml). Endocytic uptake of 125I-LDL or 3H-cholesterol oleate-labeled LDL (3H-LDL) at 37 degrees C demonstrated the cell-associated 125I-LDL and 3H-LDL increase. The intracellular degradation of protein moiety increased linearly with time. Reductive methylation of 3H-LDL led to a remarkable decrease in the cell-associated cholesterol moiety of LDL. The difference in uptake of the cholesterol moiety of LDL between U-251MG cells and KMG-5 cells showed that the U-251MG cells, which proliferate more actively than KMG-5 cells, take up more of the cholesterol moiety of LDL than do the KMG-5 cells. Thus, LDL cholesterol seems to be endocytosed predominantly via the LDL receptor present on the plasma membrane of malignant glioma cells. In addition, for growth, these cells may require large amounts of the cholesterol moiety of LDL.\r"

As investigation of dementia is likely to be one of the main uses of routine rCBF imaging, 18 demented patients were imaged with both techniques. The PET data were compared quantitatively with three versions of the SPECT data. These were, first, data normalized to the SPECT cerebellar uptake, second, data linearly corrected using the PET cerebellar value and, finally, data Lassen corrected for washout from the high flow areas. Both the linearly-corrected (r = 0.81) and the Lassen-corrected (r = 0.79) HMPAO SPECT data showed good correlation with the PET rCBF data. The relationship between the normalized HMPAO SPECT data and the PET data was nonlinear. It is not yet possible to obtain rCBF values in absolute units from HMPAO SPECT without knowledge of the true rCBF in one reference region for each patient.\r"

In 13 children, total CBF was normal (62 +/- 20 ml/min/100 gm) but marked local variability of flow was seen. In five other children, total CBF was significantly reduced (26 +/- 10 ml/min/100 gm; p less than 0.05), with flow reduced more in white matter (8 +/- 5 ml/min/100 gm) than in gray matter (30 +/- 15 ml/min/100 gm). Autoregulation of CBF appeared to be present in these 18 children within a range of mean arterial blood pressure from 56 to 102 mm Hg. In the remaining two infants, brain dead within the first 24 hours, total flow was uniformly absent, averaging 3 +/- 3 ml/min/100 gm. In seven children, CBF was determined at two carbon dioxide tension (PCO2) levels: 40 (+/- 3) mm Hg and 29 (+/- 3) mm Hg. In six children, total CBF decreased 33%, from 52 (+/- 25) to 35 (+/- 15) ml/min/100 gm; the mean percentage of change in CBF per millimeter of mercury of PCO2 was 3.0%. Regional variability of perfusion to changes in PCO2 was marked in all six children. The percentage of change in CBF per millimeter of mercury of PCO2 was similar in frontal gray matter (3.1%) but higher in white matter (4.5%). In the seventh patient a paradoxical response was observed; total and regional CBF increased 25% after hyperventilation. Our findings demonstrate that (1) CBF in children with bacterial meningitis may be substantially decreased globally, with even more variability noted regionally, (2) autoregulation of CBF is preserved, (3) CBF/CO2 responsitivity varies among patients and in different regions of the brain in the same patient, and (4) hyperventilation can reduce CBF below ischemic thresholds.\r"

Products were identified by dot-blot hybridization or agarose gel electrophoresis and Southern hybridization, using an alkaline phosphatase-linked oligonucleotide probe specific for amplified sequences. Colorimetric and chemiluminescent substrates were used. HIV-1 DNA was detected in PBMCs of 57/59 HIV-1-seropositive individuals, 8 of which were positive only following the use of nested primers. Of 12 seropositive samples that were negative by other HIV-1 diagnostic tests (PBMC coculture and serum p24 antigen detection), 11 were positive by PCR. PCR using PBMC lysates is a very sensitive method of detecting HIV-1 proviral sequences. The use of nested primers appears to increase the sensitivity of the procedure.\r"

McN-5195 blocked thalamic activity (multiunit recordings from the ventral posterolateral nucleus) evoked by noxious stimulation of the contralateral hindlimb of anesthetized rats, but did not alter thalamic activity during non-noxious stimulation. The antinociceptive action of McN-5195 was not blocked by naloxone and was not diminished in morphine-tolerant animals. McN-5195 did not affect arachidonate metabolism and was not active against carrageenan-induced paw edema or in an adjuvant arthritis test in rats. McN-5195 did not bind to opiate, serotonin S1 or S2, dopamine D2, alpha-1, alpha-2, beta adrenergic or gamma-aminobutyric acid-A receptors and did not inhibit the synaptic uptake of norepinephrine, serotonin, dopamine or gamma-aminobutyric acid. McN-5195-induced antinociception was not affected by reserpine or phentolamine pretreatment and was not reduced in clonidine-tolerant animals. Ketanserin and yohimbine inhibited McN-5195-induced antinociception by an indirect mechanism. Tolerance did not develop to chronic administration of McN-5195 (120 mg/kg 3 times per day for 10 days). We conclude that McN-5195 is a structurally novel (indolizine) antinociceptive agent that produces its analgesic action via a nonopioid mechanism, not involving products of arachidonate metabolism.\r"

A reduction of cellular immune function as measured by splenic natural killer cell activity has also been described following the central administration of CRF. In this study we evaluated the role of the sympathetic nervous system in mediating CRF-induced suppression of natural killer (NK) cytotoxicity. Synthetic rat CRF (1.0 microgram) microinjected into the lateral ventricle increased noradrenergic function and reduced NK activity in the rat spleen. Pretreatment of the animals by chemical sympathectomy (6-hydroxy-dopamine, 100 mg/kg i.p. daily over 10 days) produced a greater than 95% reduction of splenic norepinephrine concentration and abolished completely both the CRF-induced increase in plasma catecholamine levels and the reduction in splenic NK activity. In addition, beta adrenergic receptor blockade (either propranolol, 10 mg/kg i.p., or butoxamine, 25 mg/kg i.p. 30 min before i.c.v. infusion) antagonized the CRF-induced reduction in NK activity. Measurement of circulating levels of adrenocorticotrophic hormone and corticosterone demonstrated that activation of the pituitary adrenal axis by CRF was dissociated from changes in NK activity. These findings suggest that the sympathetic nervous system mediates the suppression of splenic NK cytotoxicity after i.c.v. CRF.\r"

In this study, increasing doses of human t-PA were administered to rats, rabbits and marmoset monkeys, and in an isolated perfused rat liver system. t-PA concentrations in plasma and perfusate were analyzed pharmacokinetically using procedures in which nonlinear multicompartment models with Michaelis-Menten elimination were fitted to data sets from all doses simultaneously for each species. Elimination of t-PA was saturable, with Km = 12-15 micrograms/ml and Vmax = 200-350 micrograms/ml/hr in vivo. In isolated rat liver, t-PA elimination capacity was considerably reduced, with Km = 1.5 micrograms/ml and Vmax = 3.7 micrograms/ml/hr. At nonsaturating doses, plasma clearance in vivo was 18-23 ml/min/kg and the dominant half-life was 1.1-2.4 min, compared with 8 ml/min/kg and 4.4 min, respectively, in humans; rat liver perfusate clearance was 0.29 ml/min/g. It is concluded that disposition kinetics of t-PA are very similar across species, extrahepatic clearance may be significant in vivo and clearance capacity becomes limited only at plasma concentrations far in excess of clinical therapeutic values. Nonlinearity is, however, of practical significance in liver perfusion and in animal pharmacology studies utilizing high t-PA doses.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of acute and a short-term (7 days) parenteral nutrition (PN, consisting of 24.2% dextrose and 5.2% amino acids) on hepatic lidocaine elimination were studied using an isolated perfused rat liver preparation. In the acute study, lidocaine was coinfused with PN solution or normal saline at 0.123 ml/min for 80 min. There was no significant difference in hepatic lidocaine elimination between control and PN-treated groups (six per group). In the post-PN study, only lidocaine was infused for 80 min. Lidocaine hepatic clearance and extraction ratio were reduced by 29.8 and 31.1% (P less than .05), respectively, compared to what occurred in livers isolated from control animals with free access to standard laboratory rat-chow and water (six per group). Mass balance at steady state showed that recovery was higher for lidocaine (46.58 +/- 7.28% vs. 25.56 +/- 5.59%) and lower for N-(N,N-diethylglycyl)-2-hydroxymethyl-6-methylaniline (0.21 +/- 0.01% vs. 2.75 +/- 0.58%) in the PN group compared to chow-fed controls. Recoveries of other lidocaine metabolites: N-(N-ethylglycy)-2,6-xylidine, 3-hydroxylidocaine, 3-hydroxy-N-(N-ethylyglycyl)-2,6-xylidine and N-(N-ethylglycyl)-2-hydroxymethyl-6-methylaniline were similar in the PN- and chow-fed group. These findings suggest that acute PN infusion has no effect on lidocaine metabolism, and that the impaired hepatic lidocaine elimination after 7-days of PN occurs as a result of selective inhibition of hepatic enzyme activities such as those involved in aryl methyl hydroxylation and in other unidentified metabolic pathway(s).\r"

The median time to discontinuation for intramuscular gold, auranofin, hydroxychloroquine or penicillamine was 2 years or less, but was 4.25 years for methotrexate (p = 0.008 vs all other drugs combined). Adverse reactions were a more common reason for discontinuation than efficacy, and both were less common in patients taking methotrexate (p less than 0.01). Neither disease duration, disease severity, or demographic factors were useful predictors of discontinuation.

At 60 days of age, the rats were divided into four dietary groups (41-42 rats/group):I, 5% corn oil diet fed ad libitum; II, 20% corn oil diet fed ad libitum; III, 5% corn oil diet fed 12% less than group I; and IV, 20% corn oil diet fed 12% less than group II. The 5% and 20% corn oil diets were purified semisynthetic diets that were isonutrient on a caloric basis. All animals were housed individually in single cages; food consumption of each animal was computed daily throughout the study. Sixteen weeks after carcinogen treatment, mean numbers of mammary carcinomas per rat (+/- SE) in groups I, II, III, and IV were 4.1 +/- 0.6, 6.8 +/- 0.7, 3.0 +/- 0.3, and 4.1 +/- 0.5, respectively. Mean weight of mammary carcinomas per rat (g +/- SE) in groups I, II, III, and IV were 3.5 +/- 0.7, 8.0 +/- 1.3, 3.0 +/- 1.1, and 4.6 +/- 1.3, respectively. Mammary carcinoma number and weight were significantly (P less than .01) increased in the animals fed the 20% corn oil diet ad libitum when compared with those fed the 5% corn oil diet ad libitum; however, no significant differences in mammary tumor number or weight were observed between the animals fed a restricted, 20% corn oil diet and those fed a restricted, 5% corn oil diet. The study involving the animals fed the 12%-restricted diets was repeated (38-42 rats/group), with virtually identical results, i.e., the mean number of mammary carcinomas per rat in the groups fed the restricted 5% fat and 20% fat diets at termination of the study was 3.1 +/- 0.4 and 3.7 +/- 0.3, respectively, and the mean weight (g) of mammary carcinomas per rat was 4.3 +/- 1.2 and 4.0 +/- 1.1, respectively (no significant differences). Thus, high levels of dietary fat can significantly enhance mammary carcinogenesis in female rats, but only in animals on an ad libitum feeding protocol. A slight restriction in amount consumed (12% less than ad libitum) abolished the mammary carcinogenic differential between a high-fat and a low-fat diet.\r"

The medical and financial impact of repeal in Kansas (KS), reinstatement in LA (accident, fatality, and critical injury rates) have been studied through 1987. Current FARS data and studies from KS, LA, 10 states and 5 countries are compared and reported. Without M/C helmet legislation, the user rate drops from 99% to 50%. With reinstatement, the user rate rises to greater than 95%. Average hospital stay (days) for helmeted (H) riders is 5.8, non-helmeted (NH), 11.8. Fatality rate/1,000 M/C registrations is 6.2 NH, 1.6 H. Changes effected through M/C helmet legislation: fatality rate was 1.17 (1981), falling to 0.44 (1987) with legislation (62% decrease) (LA); 66% change Colorado, 42% Oklahoma; fatality rate/1,000 accidents changed 28% from 42.68 NH to 30.81 H; injury accidents 84% to 73%, critical injury reduction 44% (1981 to 1987). Risk of head injury: NH 2.07 greater than H. Risk of a fatal accident: NH 1.44 greater than H. Accident rate is less with M/C helmet legislation than without (19% KS, 48% LA). The medical costs (LA 1981 to 1987) decreased 48.8%. Length of stay decreased 37%. The major impact hospital stay greater than 20 days: 80% decline. Cost of long-term disability greater than 30 days: 81.2% decrease (LA). Average disability was 26.7 vs. 51.1 days (KS); 25.5 H required hospitalization per 100 accidents vs. 41.6 NH. Medical costs: NH 306% greater than H (KS). Based on 1989 dollars, $120.8 million of additional medical care and rehabilitation expenses/per year were due directly to non-use of helmets (U.S.); 60-82% of NH riders have no insurance; $4.9 billion was absorbed by the public in the form of increased taxation, higher insurance costs, and lost taxes. M/C helmet legislation decreases medical costs. In this era of spiraling health care costs, legislation mandating the use of protective helmets should be considered as a viable alternative to raising taxes.\r"

The present study provides the methodology to identify injuries and trauma severity using discharge abstract data collected routinely by all hospitals. In this study, the validity of defining trauma patients using routinely collected abstract data and two computerized patient classifications--Diagnosis Related Groups (DRGs) and Patient Management Categories (PMCs)--was tested using the trauma registry data of one major trauma center as the gold standard. Medical records were reviewed to assess whether patients were accurately classified as having injuries by each of the two systems and whether patients were incorrectly omitted from the registry. Results indicated that trauma patients are more accurately identified by PMCs (95.1% accuracy) than by either DRGs (44.4% accuracy) or the registry standard itself (91.8% accuracy). Because patients identified by DRGs as trauma were not likely to be injured (21.2% specificity), and many true injuries were not identified as such by DRGs (47.9% sensitivity), per case payments to hospitals are unpredictable, and management based on DRG data is misleading. By contrast, PMCs (97.8% sensitivity; 77.7% specificity) can be used to improve injury surveillance methods, to monitor outcomes in terms of morbidity and mortality, and to make hospital payment systems more equitable.\r"

Two pseudocysts were treated operatively; five were drained percutaneously with fluoroscopic guidance. These five ranged from 5 to 15 cm in diameter and were present for 10 to 42 days (mean, 26 days). In all cases, the cyst fluid was clear, had an amylase level of greater than 40,000 IU/L, and grew no organisms. The pigtail catheters left in place in four of the five children were removed when drainage stopped. Patients were followed by ultrasound while still in the hospital and 1 month after discharge. There were no complications nor any pseudocyst recurrence. Percutaneous drainage of traumatic pancreatic pseudocysts in children is an effective alternative to the standard operative therapy of pseudocystenteric anastomosis.\r"

  ".W": "It has been suggested that lipid is a preferred fuel in stressed patients. We evaluated glucose oxidation in 20 patients (sepsis, cancer of the colon, multiple trauma, controls) while they received TPN (5.65 mg glucose/kg/min). Respiratory quotient (RQ) was measured by indirect calorimetry and the percent VCO2 arising from the oxidation of glucose was measured using [U-14C] glucose. Since RQs were 1.0 or greater in all patients, the nonprotein energy utilized by them was calculated to be derived completely from glucose. However, the kinetic data showed that glucose contributed only 55-60% of the VCO2. Protein oxidation contributed less than 20% of the VCO2, as calculated from urinary nitrogen. The difference must have been derived from fatty acid oxidation. The glucose turnover that was not oxidized was presumed to be converted to lipid at an RQ of 8.6. The net oxygen consumption and carbon dioxide production from this overall distribution resulted in an RQ of about 1.0 with only 60% coming from glucose oxidation. Since all patients responded in the same manner, it appears that the proper ratio of glucose and lipid was dictated on a physiologic basis and not on the type of disease.\r"

  ".U": "91012679\r", 
  ".W": "Arterial blood gas measurements (ABGs) are the most common tests ordered in an ICU. ABG utilization in a surgical ICU over a 1-year period (September 1, 1987-October 31, 1988) was evaluated to identify factors that might help reduce overutilization. A total of 842 admissions comprising 2,381 patient days were reviewed. ABGs were the most commonly ordered test (mean of 4.8/patient/day). Patients with arterial lines (A-lines) had more ABGs drawn than those who did not regardless of the value of PaO2 (p less than 0.01), PaCO2 (p less than 0.01 except for PaCO2 greater than 55), APACHE II score (p less than 0.01), use of ventilators (p less than 0.01), pulse oximeters (p less than 0.01), or a combination of the last two (p less than 0.01). Multivariate analysis demonstrated that the presence of an A-line was the most powerful predictor of the number of ABGs drawn per patient (p less than 0.0001) independent of all other measures of the patient's clinical status such as the use of ventilators, oximeters, and values of PaO2, PaCO2, or the APACHE II score. This suggests that ABGs are being drawn unnecessarily simply because of the presence of an A-line. To reduce the number of ABGs drawn, a policy for specific indications for placement of A-lines and ABG analysis should be adopted.\r"

Sickness at admission increased following the introduction of the prospective payment system (PPS). For our five diseases combined, the 30-day mortality to be expected because of sickness at admission was 1.0% higher in the 1985-1986 period than in the 1981-1982 period (16.4% vs 15.4%), and the expected 180-day mortality was 1.6% higher (30.1% vs 28.5%). Studies of the effects of PPS on mortality must take this increase in sickness at admission into account.\r"

For the four medical diseases, a better process of care resulted in lower mortality rates 30 days after admission. Patients in the upper quartile of process scores had a 30-day mortality rate 5% lower than that of patients in the lower quartile. The process of care improved after the introduction of the prospective payment system; eg, better nursing care after the introduction of the prospective payment system was associated with an expected decrease in 30-day mortality rates in pneumonia patients of 0.8 percentage points, and better physician cognitive performance was associated with an expected decrease in 30-day mortality rates of 0.4 percentage points. Overall, process improvements across all four medical conditions were associated with a 1 percentage point reduction in 30-day mortality rates after the introduction of the prospective payment system.\r"

For the five diseases combined; length of stay dropped 24% and in-hospital mortality declined from 16.1% to 12.6% after the PPS was introduced (P less than .05). Thirty-day mortality adjusted for sickness at admission was 1.1% lower than before (16.5% pre-PPS, 15.4% post-PPS; P less than .05), and 180-day adjusted mortality was essentially unchanged at 29.6% pre-vs 29.0% post-PPS (P less than .05). For patients admitted to the hospital from home, 4% more patients were not discharged home post-PPS than pre-PPS (P less than .05), and an additional 1% of patients had prolonged nursing home stays (P less than .05). The introduction of the PPS was not associated with a worsening of outcome for hospitalized Medicare patients. However, because our post-PPS data are from 1985 and 1986, we recommend that clinical monitoring be maintained to ensure that changes in prospective payment do not negatively affect patient outcome.\r"

In this article we report on a mortality analysis, patient and hospital subgroup comparisons, and time series studies we have conducted in an attempt to determine whether changes in quality of care can be linked causally to the introduction of the prospective payment system. Based on these analyses we conclude that (1) mortality following hospitalization has been unaffected by the introduction of the prospective payment system, and improvements in in-hospital processes of care that began prior to the prospective payment system have continued after its introduction, but (2) the prospective payment system has increased the likelihood that a patient will be discharged home in an unstable condition. We recommend that efforts to correct this problem be intensified and that clinical monitoring of the impact of the prospective payment system continue as hospital cost-containment pressures intensify.\r"

We propose a model for appropriate use of such therapies that incorporates effectiveness, utility, and marginal costs. If a therapy is rarely effective and rarely desirable, it is considered medically inappropriate. If the marginal cost-effectiveness ratio is inordinately high, it is considered economically inappropriate. If a therapy is either medically or economically inappropriate, it should not be automatically offered. The model provides an operational definition of futility and is illustrated with an analysis of out-of-hospital cardiopulmonary resuscitation for chronically ill older people. Advance directives, explicit health care rationing, and defining futile therapy based on survival predictions are alternatives to the appropriate care model, but are insufficient strategies to solve the problem of inappropriate life-sustaining care.\r"

The proportion of patients with histories of sexual exposure (6%), household exposure (3%), occupational exposure to blood (2%), or hemodialysis (0.6%) did not change over time. Antibody to hepatitis C virus was found in 45% of patients within 6 weeks of onset of illness and in 68% of patients followed up for at least 6 months.

  ".W": "Generalized resistance to thyroid hormone (GRTH) is an inherited disease that is usually suspected when elevated serum thyroid hormone levels are associated with nonsuppressed thyrotropin. Often these test results are obtained because of short stature, decreased intelligence, and/or hyperactivity with learning disability noted in childhood and adolescence, or because of goiter in adulthood. We detected GRTH at birth by analysis of blood obtained during routine neonatal screening. The proposita, born to a mother with GRTH, had a thyrotropin level of 26 mU/L and a corresponding thyroxine concentration of 656 nmol/L (normal, 84 to 232 nmol/L). Administration of thyroid hormone in doses eightfold to 10-fold above replacement levels (liothyronine sodium, 21 micrograms/kg per day, and levothyroxine sodium, 44 micrograms/kg per day) were required to reduce serum thyrotropin to normal levels without induction of hypermetabolism. This case, and the retrospective finding of high thyroxine levels in five newborns subsequently diagnosed as having GRTH, suggest that measurement of thyroxine at birth, in conjunction with thyrotropin, could allow the early detection of GRTH.\r"

Invasive hemodynamic and cardiac ultrasound investigations revealed severe carcinoid heart disease, and medical decompensation treatment gradually failed. Tricuspid and pulmonic valve replacement operations resulted in dramatic improvement in three of the patients, and these patients were still free of cardiac symptoms 10, 12, and 38 months postoperatively. One patient died 5 days postoperatively probably of septicemia. The preoperative and postoperative development of the cardiac disease is evaluated clinically, by cardiac ultrasound and plasma atrial natriuretic peptide concentrations, and related to the tumor disease.

The veins were constricted with phenylephrine and relaxed with the EDRF-dependent agents calcium ionophore A23187 or acetylcholine. EDRF activity produced a 36% +/- 4% relaxation of baseline contraction in response to calcium A23187. Vein graft preparation with room-temperature heparinized normal saline and pressurization to 400 mm Hg caused EDRF relaxation to fall to 10.6% +/- 2.0% versus 32.4% +/- 3.4% for control segments (p less than 0.05). Storage alone in room-temperature saline reduced EDRF response to 17.4% +/- 3.9% versus a control of 29.6% +/- 4.7% (p less than 0.05). Storage in heparinized room-temperature blood produced relaxation of 31.4% +/- 4.3% versus 34.1% +/- 5.7% (p less than 0.05). Storage in Plasma-Lyte solution (Travenol Laboratories, Inc., Deerfield, Ill), produced relaxation of 28.4% +/- 6.3% versus 30.1% +/- 5.3% (control) (p greater than 0.05). Veins stored at 2 degrees to 4 degrees C had severe depression of EDRF: 18.2% +/- 4.0% versus 34.0% +/- 5.4% for 37 degrees C storage (p less than 0.05). Pressurization to 400 mm Hg lessened EDRF relaxation: 20% +/- 3% versus 34% +/- 4% (control) (p less than 0.05), and use of nitroglycerin, papaverine, or verapamil produced no improvement. Twenty-eight vein grafts prepared with Plasma-Lyte solution were obtained from 12 patients who died 11.6 days (range up to 66 days) after operation. When compared with control veins prepared with saline and obtained at similar intervals, they had significantly more intact endothelium, less subintimal cellular infiltration, less fibrin deposition, fewer medial inflammatory changes, and less necrosis. Thus EDRF activity is significantly affected by vein graft preparation. Changes in technique to preserve EDRF produced better graft morphology early after operation.\r"

  ".W": "To determine the frequency and significance of antibody to hepatitis C virus (anti-HCV) in severe cryptogenic chronic active hepatitis (CAH), we tested sera from 17 corticosteroid-treated patients by an enzyme immunoassay. Specificity of the antibodies to HCV-encoded antigens was assessed by recombinant immunoblot assay. The findings in patients with and without anti-HCV were contrasted, and the frequency of seropositivity was compared with that in patients who had other types of chronic liver disease and in normal adults. Only three patients (18%) with severe cryptogenic CAH had anti-HCV. Sera from two of these patients were reactive by recombinant immunoblot assay; the other sample produced an indeterminate reaction. The frequency of seropositivity in patients with cryptogenic disease was not statistically different from that in patients with autoimmune CAH (6%), hepatitis B surface antigen-positive CAH (9%), or alcoholic liver disease (0%), but it was significantly less than in those with posttransfusion CAH (18% versus 75%; P less than 0.01). Seropositive patients tended to have lower serum aspartate aminotransferase, gamma-globulin, and bilirubin levels than seronegative counterparts, and they did not have histologic features of confluent necrosis at initial assessment. Two of the three seropositive patients, both of whom had been reactive by recombinant immunoblot assay, entered remission during therapy, and one, with an indeterminate reaction, died of liver failure. We conclude that anti-HCV occurs infrequently in severe corticosteroid-treated cryptogenic CAH. Seropositive patients may have less severe inflammatory activity than seronegative counterparts. Cryptogenic disease may improve during corticosteroid treatment, a result suggesting an underlying immunologic disorder in some patients.\r"
