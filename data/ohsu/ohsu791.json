  ".W": "BACKGROUND. Erythrocytosis occurs in 10 to 15 percent of renal-transplant recipients, and there is in vitro evidence that the production of erythropoietin is modulated by adenosine. METHODS. We prospectively evaluated the effects of theophylline, a nonselective adenosine antagonist, in eight patients with erythrocytosis after renal transplantation and in five normal controls. RESULTS. After an eight-week course of theophylline treatment, the mean (+/- SEM) serum erythropoietin levels were significantly reduced in both the renal-transplant recipients (from 60 +/- 14 units per liter at base line to 9 +/- 7 units after treatment; P less than 0.05) and the normal subjects (from 6.9 +/- 0.8 units per liter at base line to 4.7 +/- 0.5 units per liter after treatment; P less than 0.05). Similarly, the hematocrits were reduced in both the transplant recipients (from 0.58 +/- 0.04 at base line to 0.46 +/- 0.03 after treatment; P less than 0.05) and the normal subjects (from 0.43 +/- 0.01 at base line to 0.39 +/- 0.01; P less than 0.05). In the renal-transplant recipients, red-cell mass was also reduced after eight weeks of theophylline (from 3197 +/- 82 ml at base line to 2273 +/- 69 ml after treatment; P less than 0.05). The previous requirement of weekly phlebotomy was eliminated in all recipients. Plasma and urinary cyclic AMP levels were not increased. These effects were reproducible when the subjects were rechallenged with theophylline after a recovery period. CONCLUSIONS. Theophylline attenuates the production of erythropoietin in both normal subjects and patients with erythrocytosis after renal transplantation and may be useful in the treatment of the latter condition.\r"

  ".U": "90294872\r", 
  ".W": "BACKGROUND AND METHODS. Women with hypothyroidism have been thought not to require an increase in thyroxine replacement during pregnancy. To evaluate the effects of pregnancy on thyroxine requirements, we retrospectively reviewed the thyroid function of 12 women receiving treatment for primary hypothyroidism before, during, and after pregnancy. RESULTS. In all patients, the serum thyrotropin level increased during pregnancy. The mean (+/- SE) serum free-thyroxine index decreased from 111.0 +/- 5.8 before pregnancy to 86.5 +/- 5.2 during pregnancy (normal, 64 to 142; P less than 0.05), and the mean serum thyrotropin level increased from 2.0 +/- 0.5 mU per liter before pregnancy to 13.5 +/- 3.3 mU per liter during pregnancy (normal, 0.5 to 5.0 mU per liter; P less than 0.01). Because of high thyrotropin levels, the thyroxine dose was increased in 9 of the 12 patients. Among the three patients who did not require an increased thyroxine dose were two with low serum thyrotropin levels before pregnancy, suggesting excessive replacement at that time. The mean thyroxine dose before pregnancy was 0.102 +/- 0.009 mg per day; it was increased to 0.148 +/- 0.015 mg per day during pregnancy (P less than 0.01). The mean postpartum serum free-thyroxine index was 136.6 +/- 11.4 (P less than 0.05 as compared with values before and during pregnancy), and the mean postpartum serum thyrotropin level was 1.4 +/- 0.4 mU per liter (P less than 0.01 as compared with levels during pregnancy), demonstrating a decrease in the thyroxine requirement. The mean postpartum thyroxine dose was decreased to 0.117 +/- 0.011 mg per day (P less than 0.01 as compared with the dose during pregnancy). CONCLUSIONS. Our results indicate that the need for thyroxine increases in many women with primary hypothyroidism when they are pregnant, as reflected by an increase in serum thyrotropin concentrations. Although the effects of this modest level of hypothyroidism are not known, we think it prudent to monitor thyroid function throughout gestation and after delivery and to adjust the thyroxine dose to maintain a normal serum thyrotropin level.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND. Heavy-charged-particle radiation has several advantages over protons and photons for the treatment of intracranial lesions; it has an improved physical distribution of the dose deep in tissue, a small angle of lateral scattering, and a sharp distal falloff of the dose. METHODS. We present detailed clinical and radiologic follow-up in 86 patients with symptomatic but surgically inaccessible cerebral arteriovenous malformations that were treated with stereotactic helium-ion Bragg-peak radiation. The doses ranged from 8.8 to 34.6 Gy delivered to volumes of tissue of 0.3 to 70 cm3. RESULTS. Two years after radiation treatment, the rate of complete obliteration of the lesions, as detected angiographically, was 94 percent for lesions smaller than 4 cm3, 75 percent for those of 4 to 25 cm3, and 39 percent for those larger than 25 cm3. After three years, the rates of obliteration were 100, 95, and 70 percent, respectively. Major neurologic complications occurred in 10 patients (12 percent), of whom 8 had permanent deficits. All these complications occurred in the initial stage of the protocol, before the maximal dose of radiation was reduced to 19.2 Gy. In addition, hemorrhage occurred in 10 patients from residual malformations between 4 and 34 months after treatment. Seizures and headaches were less severe in 63 percent of the 35 and 68 percent of the 40 patients, respectively, who had them initially. CONCLUSIONS. Given the natural history of these inaccessible lesions and the high risks of surgery, we conclude that heavy-charged-particle radiation is an effective therapy for symptomatic, surgically inaccessible intracranial arteriovenous malformations. The current procedure has two disadvantages: a prolonged latency period before complete obliteration of the vascular lesion and a small risk of serious neurologic complications.\r"

  ".U": "90294902\r", 
  ".W": "In both vertebrates and invertebrates, long-term memory differs from short-term in requiring protein synthesis during training. Studies of the gill and siphon withdrawal reflex in Aplysia indicate that similar requirements can be demonstrated at the level of sensory and motor neurons which may participate in memory storage. A single application of serotonin, a transmitter that mediates sensitization, to individual sensory and motor cells in dissociated cell cultures leads to enhanced transmitter release from the sensory neurons that is independent of new macromolecular synthesis. Five applications of serotonin cause a long-term enhancement, lasting one or more days, which requires translation and transcription. Prolonged application or intracellular injection into the sensory neuron of cyclic AMP, a second messenger for the action of serotonin, also produce long-term increases in synaptic strength, suggesting that some of the gene products important for long-term facilitation are cAMP-inducible. In eukaryotic cells, most cAMP-inducible genes so far studied are activated by the cAMP-dependent protein kinase (A kinase), which phosphorylates transcription factors that bind the cAMP-responsive element TGACGTCA. The cAMP-responsive element (CRE) binds a protein dimer of relative molecular mass 43,000, the CRE-binding protein (CREBP), which has been purified and shown to increase transcription when phosphorylated by the A kinase. Here we show that extracts of the Aplysia central nervous system and extracts of sensory neurons contain a set of proteins, including one with properties similar to mammalian CREBPs, that specifically bind the mammalian CRE sequence. Microinjection of the CRE sequence into the nucleus of a sensory neuron selectively blocks the serotonin-induced long-term increase in synaptic strength, without affecting short-term facilitation. Taken together, these observations suggest that one or more CREB-like transcriptional activators are required for long-term facilitation.\r"

These enzymes are either serine/threonine-specific or tyrosine-specific. Many of the latter are transmembrane receptors and are important in transduction of extracellular signals across the plasma membrane, whereas few examples of receptor serine kinases have been reported. We have now identified a complementary DNA clone from Zea mays (L.) encoding a putative serine/threonine-specific protein kinase structurally related to the receptor tyrosine kinases. This structural similarity is evidence for a previously undescribed class of transmembrane receptor in higher plants likely to be involved in signal reception and transduction. Furthermore, the catalytic domain of this protein kinase is linked through a transmembrane domain to an extracellular domain similar to that of glycoproteins encoded in the self-incompatibility locus of Brassica which are involved in the self-recognition system between pollen and stigma.\r"

  ".W": "Cell growth and differentiation are usually mutually exclusive. Transformation of myoblasts by retroviruses containing the myc oncogene inhibits differentiation, preventing cells from withdrawing from the cell cycle. If cell-cycle withdrawal is a prerequisite for myoblast differentiation, it is probably an early event in terminal cell differentiation, but this has not yet been established. MyoD1 regulates myogenesis. It is expressed only in skeletal muscle, but can convert other cells to muscle cells. The MyoD1 protein, a nuclear phosphoprotein in part similar to the myc family of proteins, is a DNA-binding protein binding to the enhancer sequences of the muscle-specific creatine phosphokinase gene. Thus, introduction of MyoD1 into cells provides a simple approach to study the effect of induction of differentiation on cell growth. In cultured NIH 3T3 cells, inhibition of cell proliferation occurs within 18 hours, and expression of myosin starts after 72 hours. Furthermore, injection of MyoD1 into quiescent NIH 3T3 cells inhibit cell proliferation independently of induction of differentiation. Deletion of the myc-like domain in the MyoD1 gene eliminates the inhibition of DNA synthesis, but substitution of the basic domain with the analogous domain from the E12 transcription factor inhibits growth yet fails to induce differentiation. Inhibition of DNA synthesis, therefore, seems to be controlled separately from myogenic differentiation.\r"

  ".U": "90294927\r", 
  ".W": "There is increasing evidence that retinoic acid is a morphogen involved in vertebrate development. This evidence comes in part from studies of the chick wing bud, in which local application of all-trans-retinoic acid results in a duplication of the digit pattern along the anteroposterior axis. Retinoic acid may be only one of several morphogenetic signalling compounds required for limb pattern formation. To identify novel morphogenetically active compounds, fractionated extracts of whole chick embryos were tested for their ability to induce digit pattern duplications. We describe here the isolation of a new activity present in the limb bud, which we have identified as all-trans-3,4-didehydroretinoic acid. The 3,4-didehydroretinoic acid is generated in situ from retinol through a 3,4-didehydroretinol intermediate. We show that 3,4-didehydroretinoic acid and retinoic acid are equipotent in evoking digit duplications. These findings suggest that there are at least two endogenous retinoids with morphogenetic properties in the chick limb.\r"

  ".U": "90294928\r", 
  ".W": "In many developing organisms the establishment of axial polarity and the patterning of cells depend on local signals that derive from restricted regions of the embryo. In vertebrate embryos, the origins of tissue polarity have been examined extensively in the developing limb. The anteroposterior pattern of the chick limb seems to be controlled by a morphogen, possibly retinoic acid, that is enriched in a region of the limb known as the zone of polarizing activity (ZPA). Certain tissues other than the ZPA have also shown polarizing activity experimentally in the chick limb, raising the possibility that signalling molecules involved in pattern formation in different embryonic tissues are conserved. Here we provide evidence that a similar polarizing activity is also present in a restricted region of the developing central nervous system (CNS). We show that a specialized group of neural cells termed the floor plate, but not other regions of the CNS, mimics the ZPA in respecifying the digit pattern in the developing chick limb. In addition, using an in vitro biochemical assay, we show that the floor plate can synthesize retinoic acid and 3,4-didehydroretinol, the precursor of a second morphogenetically active retinoid, 3,4-didehydroretinoic acid. These results show that the floor plate is a local source of a ZPA-like polarizing signal, possibly a retinoid, which may regulate the pattern of cell differentiation in the developing CNS.\r"

We have shown that chronic childhood-onset SMA (SMA II and III) maps to a single locus on chromosome 5q. Acute SMA (SMA Type I/Werdnig-Hoffmann/severe/infantile) is the main cause of heritable infant mortality. Mapping the acute SMA locus by conventional methods is complicated by the rapidly fatal course of the disease and its recessive mode of inheritance. We present here the typing of four inbred acute-SMA families with DNA markers on chromosome 5q and analysis of these together with acute families from our previous study to demonstrate genetic homogeneity between the acute and chronic forms of SMA. The data indicate that the acute SMA locus maps to chromosome 5q11.2-13.3. Two families seem unlinked to 5q markers, raising the possibility of genetic heterogeneity or disease misclassification within the acute and chronic family sets.\r"

  ".W": "Homeodomain proteins function in determination of mating type in yeast, segmentation in fruit flies and cell-type specific gene expression in mammals. In Drosophila, expression of homeobox genes is controlled by cell-autonomous interactions between regulatory proteins and environmental clues. Similar controls may operate during mammalian limb development and frog embryogenesis. But, the exact way in which expression of homeodomain proteins is regulated in these systems is not clear and requires biochemical analysis of homeobox gene transcription. We now describe such an analysis of the GHF1 gene, which encodes a mammalian homeodomain protein specifying expression of the growth hormone (GH) gene in anterior pituitary somatotrophs. GHF1 is transcribed in a highly restricted manner and the presence of GHF1 protein is correlated both temporally and spatially with activation of the GH gene during pituitary development. Analysis of the GHF1 promoter indicates that transcription is also controlled by cell-autonomous interactions involving positive autoregulation by GHF1, and environmental cues that modulate the intracellular level of cyclic AMP and thereby the activity of cAMP response element binding protein (CREB), a ubiquitous transactivator that binds to the GHF1 promoter.\r"

  ".W": "Deoxygenated sickle haemoglobin polymerizes into long 210-A diameter fibres that distort and decrease the deformability of red blood cells, and cause sickle cell disease. The fibres consist of seven intertwined double strands. They can form birefringent nematic liquid crystals (tactoids) and spherulites. Rheologically, the system behaves as a gel. The equilibria show a phase separation and a solubility. The reaction kinetics show a delay time, are then roughly exponential and are highly dependent on concentration and temperature, and accord with the double nucleation model. But these conclusions are derived from macroscopic data, without direct observation of individual fibres. We have now used non-invasive video-enhanced differential interference contrast (DIC) and dark-field microscopy to observe nucleation, growth and interaction of sickle deoxyhaemoglobin fibres in real time. The fibres originate both from centres that produce many radially distributed fibres and on the surface of pre-existing fibres, from which they then branch. The resulting network is cross-linked and dynamic in that it is flexible and continues to grow and cross-link. Our results support most aspects of the double nucleation model.\r"

Interest in DNA triplexes arises from potential applications of intermolecular triplexes as antisense inhibitors of gene expression and from the possibility that intramolecular triplexes may have a role in gene expression and recombination. We recently presented NMR evidence for triplex formation from the DNA oligonucleotides d(GA)4 and d(TC)4, which showed unambiguously that the second pyrimidine strand is Hoogsteen base paired and the cytosines are protonated at N3 as required. To obtain a more well defined triplex, and to provide a model for in vivo triplex structures, we have designed and synthesized a 28-base DNA oligomer with a sequence that could potentially fold to form a triplex containing both T.A.T and C+.G.C triplets. Our NMR results indicate that the conformation at pH 5.5 is an intramolecular triplex and that a significant amount of triplex remains even at pH 8.0.\r"

Good pregnancy outcome was defined as a vaginal birth between 37-42 weeks' gestation of a living, singleton infant of appropriate birth weight for gestational age without congenital anomalies, born to a mother who did not experience diabetes or hypertension during pregnancy. Ranges of 12-18 and 10-21 kg described 50 and 80% of the group, respectively. Mean weight gain was associated with maternal pre-pregnancy body mass, parity, and race, with the largest differences observed in overweight and obese women. The results reported here suggest that a wider range of maternal weight gain than is currently recommended is associated with good pregnancy outcome.\r"

The microhysteroscope has been shown to be useful in identifying the upper limit of the transformation zone within the canal, and this distance from the external os can be measured. However, this technique has not been evaluated to determine whether it can tailor cone length to this predetermined measurement. We report an observational analysis of 176 consecutive conizations in patients with colposcopically proved extension of abnormal epithelium high into the cervical canal. In 162 cases, the distance of the transformation zone from the external os could be measured with the microhysteroscope and its endocervicometer, permitting an attempt to tailor the cone length to this measurement plus a safety margin of 5 mm. There was good correlation between the intended cone length and the excised cone length, with 85% of the excised cones falling within 5 mm above or below the intended measurement. In 153 instances (94.4%), the excised cones had clear endocervical margins. Thus, tailoring of the cone length to the hysteroscopically determined measurement is feasible, thereby increasing the chances of complete excision while limiting cone size to the required minimum.\r"

For the detection of recurrent tumor, vaginal cytology had a sensitivity and specificity of 13 and 100%, pelvic or general physical examination 58 and 96%, and the presence of suspicious symptoms 71 and 95%, respectively. Ninety-four percent of all patients with recurrent tumor had at least one abnormal surveillance index. Three of 31 patients (10%) with recurrent tumor were treated successfully with secondary therapy. Two recurrences were detected by vaginal cytology exclusively. Even though vaginal cytology is not sensitive and may not be cost-effective, we conclude that it is the technique most likely to detect recurrent tumor while it is localized and potentially curable.\r"

The distributions of age, weight, operative time, nodal yields, mean lesion diameters, median depths of invasion, and histologic subtypes were not statistically different between the transfused and untransfused groups. The average estimated blood loss among the transfused patients was 1104 mL, compared with 764 mL among the untransfused patients (P = .015). Among the 68 who received blood perioperatively, there were ten recurrences (14.7%), compared with two (3.4%) among the 58 patients who did not receive blood (P = .035). In this select population of patients, in which perioperative transfusion was isolated as a variable, transfusion adversely affected the outcome of surgical therapy.\r"

High-risk patients were referred to a hospital. The clinics operated under uniform written guidelines. Experienced physicians performed the procedures. There were no deaths in this series of patients. One hundred twenty-one patients were hospitalized (0.71 per 1000) for suspected perforation, ectopic pregnancy, hemorrhage, sepsis, or recognized incomplete abortion. There was no major extirpative surgery performed. There were an additional 1438 minor complications (8.46 per 1000). Overall, there were 9.05 complications per 1000 abortions. The complication rates for procedures done under general anesthesia and local anesthesia were similar.

Planning for care outside the hospital must include psychological support for the patient and family during the initial transition to issues involving the terminal phase of an illness. Although there is a remarkable array of potential care choices--home hospice, hospital-based hospice, and varying nursing home coverage--the access of an individual patient to these may vary widely. The impoverishment of the family, monetarily and physically; the denial of alternatives, even though potentially more cost-effective; and lack of coverage for a significant portion of the patient population can make humane care at the end of life impossible. Physicians have an ethical responsibility to inform themselves about terminal care and to advocate improved coverage at the end of life.\r"

  ".W": "In order to delineate factors contributing to variation in hormone levels, progesterone and prolactin (PRL) levels from 28 normal women, obtained daily during one menstrual cycle and every 20 minutes during a midluteal 24-hour admission in a subgroup of five subjects, provided a data base for analysis of these variables. Pulsatile analysis of the 24-hour data was conducted using an adaptive-threshold algorithm, and normal reference ranges were generated from randomly selected daily hormone values. Our data verify that inherent variation can significantly alter single random serum levels of reproductive hormones. These variations included menstrual cycle day, circadian influence, pulsatile secretion, assay error, and biologic heterogeneity. Besides the expected day-to-day change in progesterone levels during the luteal phase, seven of ten women exhibited a significant circadian variation in progesterone; however, the time of day of the peak level was not consistent among women. Prolactin levels did not demonstrate any clinically relevant change over the menstrual cycle, but did have a consistent circadian pattern (nocturnal rise) over the 24-hour study period. Pulsatile variation occurred in both progesterone and PRL levels during the 24-hour admission. Five different reference ranges were generated from randomly selected single daily values from the 28 normal menstrual cycles. Although the mean levels calculated for each reference range were similar, the reference ranges demonstrated considerable variation due to the random sampling. In the five progesterone reference ranges, the lower limit of the range varied from 2.7-6.1 ng/mL, whereas the upper limit varied from 24.2-42.1 ng/mL.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Forty neonatal urine samples were positive for cocaine and 46 were negative. Preterm labor, premature rupture of membranes, and meconium-stained amniotic fluid were significantly more frequent in those mothers whose neonates tested positive for cocaine metabolites than in those whose infants were negative (P less than .05). Neonates testing positive were more likely to exhibit signs and symptoms of acute cocaine intoxication. Low birth weight, growth retardation, and abruptio placentae were also more frequent than would be expected in the general population, but were not statistically different between the groups. These findings suggest that the differences noted in the cocaine-positive group may represent acute and chronic exposure, whereas the negative group reflects the problems associated with chronic usage alone.\r"

Menorrhagia (menstrual blood loss more than 80 mL per cycle) was diagnosed objectively in 32 (44%) of 72 women with a subjective complaint of heavy menses. All of the 32 women had ovulatory cycles. After random allocation to treatment with either mefenamic acid (500 mg three times daily during menses, N = 17) or norethisterone (5 mg twice daily on days 19-26 of the cycle, N = 15) for two additional cycles, the median menstrual blood loss was reduced from 123 mL (range 86-237) to 81 mL (22-193) (P less than .001) and from 109 mL (81-236) to 92 mL (43-189) (P less than .002) with mefenamic acid and norethisterone, respectively. Apart from a decrease in the median number of days of bleeding, from 7 (5-8) to 5 (3-8) in those women treated with mefenamic acid, no other differences were seen between the groups. We conclude that mefenamic acid and norethisterone were similarly effective in reducing the degree of menstrual blood loss in women with proved menorrhagia, but that 52 and 67% of the women, respectively, remained menorrhagic after 2 months of treatment.\r"

Thirty-nine percent of patients with chronic pelvic pain had been physically abused in childhood. This percentage was significantly greater than that observed in other chronic-pain patients (18.4%) or controls (9.4%), though the prevalence of childhood sexual abuse did not differ among the groups (19.4, 16.3, and 12.5%, respectively). Abuse in adulthood was less common and was not significantly more likely to have occurred in patients with chronic pelvic pain than in other chronic-pain patients or controls. These data suggest that pelvic pain is unlikely to be specifically and psychodynamically related to sexual abuse but that the pernicious nature of abuse, whether physical or sexual, may promote the chronicity of painful conditions.\r"

Eighteen of the 30 women reevaluated 4-48 months later had total obliteration of the cervical canal. In some patients, the cervix was obliterated and flush with the vaginal vault so that it could not be identified. Five other patients had severe cervical stenosis. Factors contributing to cervical os obliteration appeared to be the depth of the cervical defect, the lack of the physical action of blood passing through the cervical canal, and the hypoestrogenic state. This outcome makes continued adequate cytologic and colposcopic surveillance of these patients impossible and leaves them at risk for developing unrecognized cervical and endometrial disease.\r"

Other reports with less stringent guidelines and less intensive nursing contact have questioned the contribution of home uterine activity monitoring and perinatal nursing support to a preterm birth prevention program. In this large, prospective, randomized multicenter study, patients were assigned to receive either daily monitoring and nursing contact or a preterm birth prevention program including intensive education and more frequent prenatal visits. Among the monitored patients, there was a significant increase in early detection of preterm labor (2 cm or less), successful tocolysis, and prolongation of pregnancy to term. Thirty-one percent of these diagnoses of preterm labor resulted from evaluation of increased uterine activity without associated patient-perceived symptoms. We conclude that a program of daily uterine activity monitoring and perinatal nursing support results in earlier diagnosis of preterm labor and subsequently more effective tocolysis.\r"

Patients in the home uterine activity monitoring and perinatal nursing support group monitored uterine activity twice daily, transmitted the data each day, and had 24 hour-a-day access to nursing support. Education patients were counseled regarding the common signs and symptoms of preterm labor. Both groups had scheduled prenatal visits at least every 2 weeks. Sixteen (62%) of the education group and 14 (74%) of the home uterine activity monitoring and perinatal nursing support group developed preterm labor, values that were not significantly different. Of the monitored group who experienced preterm labor, all 14 were dilated 3 cm or less at diagnosis of the first preterm labor, compared with ten of 16 in the education group (P = .01; one-tailed Fisher test). The mean cervical dilatation at the first preterm labor episode in the group receiving daily monitoring and contact (1.6 cm) was significantly less (P = .01) than that in the education group (2.9 cm). Thus, fewer preterm births were recorded in the home uterine activity monitoring and perinatal nursing support group and significantly fewer patients delivered because of failed tocolysis (P = .03).\r"

Recurrent preterm labor occurred in 15 (45%) of monitored patients and 19 (56%) of standard-care patients. The risk of preterm birth (before 37 weeks) for patients with recurrent preterm labor was significantly reduced (P = .025) in the monitored group (seven, or 47%) compared with the standard-care group (16, or 84%). The relative risk of delivering because of failed tocolysis was 2.8 for the standard-care group versus the monitored group.

Maternal symptomatology and uterine activity characteristics such as low-amplitude high-frequency contractility, contraction amplitude, contraction duration, contraction interval, and contraction rhythmicity were assessed for their ability to differentiate true from threatened preterm labor. Neither maternal symptomatology nor any uterine activity characteristic other than contraction frequency could differentiate true from threatened preterm labor.

Uterine activity measured by external devices using the guard ring principle or by standard tocodynamometers has been shown to be accurate concerning the frequency of uterine activity as compared with intrauterine pressure catheter-derived data in the third trimester. In this study, 26 women from 19-34 weeks in documented preterm labor had their uterine activity measured by a standard in-hospital monitor and a Term Guard tocodynamometer simultaneously. The standard monitor reflected 16-91% of the frequency of contractions noted by the Term Guard device, with a reduction in the correlation at gestational ages under 30 weeks. In another 20 patients between 17-36 weeks' gestation, these two methods of external tocodynamometry were compared with a transcervical catheter which measured actual intrauterine pressure and frequency of contractions. There was a good correlation between the Term Guard device and transcervically measured contractions (94.6%). At gestational ages of 28 weeks or less, there was poor performance from standard devices (less than 38% correlation with the intrauterine pressure catheter). These data have important implications for clinicians who monitor preterm patients on an ambulatory basis for early detection of preterm labor and also have clinical impact for the management of patients at early gestational ages in active labor.\r"

In this study, patients with twin gestations (39), triplet pregnancies (20), and quadruplets (ten) were monitored in the home daily for uterine activity. The results indicate that uterine activity was increased slightly within 48 hours of the onset of their initial preterm labor episode and significantly increased over baseline during the 24 hours preceding the diagnosis of preterm labor. This uterine activity led to evaluation for preterm labor before advanced dilatation occurred so that the majority of patients continued their pregnancy for more than 48 hours after diagnosis. Tocolytics did not have an effect on the crescendo of uterine activity preceding preterm labor. In this study, the crescendo of uterine activity occurred in multifetal gestations within 24 hours of preterm labor, as has been described for singleton pregnancies.\r"

Seven patients who were being monitored were noted to have preterm labor, and six of these seven were found to have increased uterine activity before the diagnosis of preterm labor. There was no difficulty encountered in the vast majority of cases in recording objective, accurate uterine activity information even at these early gestational ages. There was an increase in the uterine activity (during the 18th and 19th weeks) in patients destined to develop preterm labor later in gestation as compared with the contraction pattern of those who labored at term. This study demonstrates that accurate uterine activity information can be gained at these early gestational ages and that when increased contraction frequency is present, it is related to preterm labor.\r"

They felt that the service was beneficial to them and allowed them to stay in their local area.

Likewise, concerning women who developed preterm labor, the physicians were confident that the diagnosis would be early enough that transport, if necessary, could be carried out safely.

The percentages for preterm delivery are slightly lower than those found in the literature; this may be attributable to improvement in preterm birth prevention efforts including patient education, more frequent examinations, home uterine activity monitoring, and daily nursing contact.\r"

Twenty-seven responses (67.5%) were obtained. The majority of the responding patients (81%) felt that the monitor helped their pregnancy and 92% would recommend it to family and friends. Eighty-five percent thought that the monitor and related nursing services would be something that they would use in future pregnancies. No subject concluded that the monitor depersonalized their obstetric care. Forty-one percent of the patients felt that the device was an intrusion into their life-style. Seventy-eight percent thought that the device was beneficial in their understanding of preterm labor and in learning to perceive their own baseline uterine activity. Almost 60% of the subjects noted that the monitor was useful in determining uterine activity because they did not perceive any contractions. Approximately 65% felt that unnecessary trips to the hospital for prolonged monitoring were prevented by the availability of 24-hour-a-day, 7-day-a-week emergency transmission and nurse contact. Nearly three-fourths of the patients felt that unnecessary calls to the physician were prevented by their ability to monitor. In summary, the services were well accepted by the patients and, despite the intrusion into their life-style, most felt that home uterine activity monitoring improved the outcome of their pregnancy.\r"

Its impact was evaluated in 615 high-risk patients at the Bronx Municipal Hospital Center. The 12-minute videotape focused on the implications of preterm birth, the signs and symptoms of preterm labor, and behavioral modification to reduce life-style risk factors. An instrument was constructed to examine baseline knowledge, information transfer, and knowledge retention, and was validated and tested for reliability (r = 0.95). The results demonstrated a statistically significant knowledge transfer for patients viewing the videotape (P less than .0001) and significant knowledge retention through the postpartum period (P less than .0001) for Spanish-speaking as well as English-speaking parturients. These data emphasize the importance of the educational component of a preterm prevention program in an impoverished population at risk for early delivery.\r"

Thirty-eight women each monitored their uterine activity at home for two 60-minute periods daily during a 21-day sequence. An event marker was used to document perceived contractions and after a 3-day baseline interval, an intensive nursing-service educational intervention was initiated for all subjects. Thirty-five percent of women underreported uterine contractions, whereas only 5% overreported their uterine activity during the study. Derived patient scores of underreporting and overreporting of contractions did not vary among seven consecutive 3-day study intervals. Analysis of the data revealed that patients perceived fewer than 10% of all contractions documented electronically. No improvement in the reliability of patient perception of preterm uterine contractility was obtained after the educational intervention.\r"

The estimated life risk for an HTLV-I carrier to develop ATLL is approximately 5%. The major transmission pathway of HTLV-I peculiarly endemic in the Nagasaki Prefecture was studied. The prevalence of HTLV-I infection in children of carrier mothers (21%) was significantly higher than that in children in the general population in the area (1%) and more than 85% of mothers of carrier children were carriers. The breast milk of carrier mothers contained HTLV-I-infected cells and was infectious for marmoset via oral administration. A retrospective survey of children of carrier mothers showed that the prevalence of carrier children of carrier mothers was 17 (39%) of 44 and 0 (0%) of 10 when they were given breast milk only or formula only, respectively. These data provide a powerful basis for devising an intervention measure to block the endemic cycle of HTLV-I, ie, if carrier mothers refrain from breast-feeding, the incidence of ATLL will be significantly reduced some 50 years later.\r"

Based on a cohort of 8719 infants with validated (by early ultrasonography) gestational ages and indexes of body proportionality standardized for birth weight, potential maternal and fetal determinants of fetal growth and proportionality were assessed. Maternal history of previous low birth weight infants, pregnancy-related hypertension (particularly if severe), diabetes, prepregnancy weight, net gestational weight gain, cigarette smoking, height, parity, and fetal sex were all significantly associated with fetal growth in the expected directions. Consistent with previous reports, maternal age, marital status, and onset or total amount of prenatal care had no significant independent effects. Fetal growth ratio (relative weight for gestational age), pregnancy-related hypertension, fetal sex, and maternal height were the only significant determinants of proportionality. Infants who were growth-retarded, those with taller mothers, those whose mothers had severe pregnancy-related hypertension, and males tended to be longer and thinner and had larger heads for their weight, although these variables explained only a small fraction of the variance in the proportionality measures. Among infants with intrauterine growth retardation, gestational age was not independently associated with proportionality (in particular, late term and post-term infants did not tend to be more disproportional), a finding that does not support the hypothesis that earlier onset of growth retardation leads to more proportional growth retardation. The results raise serious questions about previous studies of proportionality, particularly those suggesting a nutritional etiology for proportional intrauterine growth retardation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Mortality was 80% in the original cohort and 64% in the current cohort (P = .01). In the current cohort, survival was significantly better for neonates with birth weights of more than 749 g (58% vs 27%; P = .001). Survival was also significantly associated with gender and with gestation number (female survival was 48% and male survival was 23%, P = .003; singleton survival was 41% and twin survival was 21%, P = .03). Prevalence of major central nervous system handicaps did not significantly differ between the two study groups, but severity of handicap was worse for the current study group. Morbidity in the current cohort was most severe for twins (67% with a major central nervous system handicap) and was least severe for singleton girls (4% with a major central nervous system handicap, P = .002). Delivery mode appeared to affect outcome. Although there were more nursery admissions and more survivors among neonates with birth weights of less than 800 g during the period 1983 through 1985 compared with the period 1977 through 1980, overall neurodevelopmental morbidity worsened.\r"

Manometric abnormalities were found in 39 patients (89%). Abnormalities during fasting included absence of the migrating motor complex; retrograde, phase 3-like episodes; increased frequency, decreased duration, and decreased amplitude of phase 3 episodes; tonic duodenal contractions; nonpropagated bursts of duodenal contractions; and consistently low-amplitude or absent contractions. Postprandial abnormalities included a phase 1-like pattern (postprandial hypomotility) and phase 3-like episodes (failure to induce a fed pattern). The presence or absence of the migrating motor complex was a predictor of disability. Parenteral alimentation was needed by only 4 of 28 patients with the migrating motor complex, but by 13 of 16 patients without the migrating motor complex (P less than .001). In 15 of 18 patients studied on consecutive days, oral cisapride was associated with increases in the number and amplitude of duodenal contractions after a complex-liquid meal (P less than .02). It is concluded that antroduodenal manometry is a useful technique that elucidates the underlying gastrointestinal motility disorder present in the majority of children and adolescents with severe functional symptoms.\r"

Logit analysis produced best-fitting statistical models for phase 1 data with significant (P less than 0.05) direct effects of gross signs, point tenderness, activity not routine, swelling moderate or severe, time from injury less than 6 hours, and pain with motion for upper extremity injuries; and, for lower extremity injuries, not knee injury, activity not routine, point tenderness, and foot injury. Prediction rules developed in phase 1 performed equally well when tested on phase 2 injuries. Data from both phases were combined, therefore, in analysis that produced risk estimates. For all injury types (ie, for injuries with all possible combinations of presence or absence of these findings), risk for fracture was derived. For upper extremity injuries, with a threshold risk for fracture of 20% used to select specific injury types for roentgenography, prediction rule outcomes were 18.1% of roentgenograms avoided and 5.3% of fractures missed. For lower extremity injuries, using a threshold risk of 10% to select injury types for roentgenography, outcomes were 25.8% of roentgenograms avoided and 5.3% of fractures missed. Alternative prediction rules allowed still greater roentgenogram avoidance, although missed fractures also increased. Risk of adverse functional outcome from missed fractures appeared small. Annual national cost savings from the elimination of 18.1% of upper and 25.8% of lower extremity roentgenographic evaluations was estimated at $103 million.\r"

In spite of an ill-defined role for ECMO as well as the potential for neurologic sequelae for these patients, additional centers continue to be established across the United States. To provide information regarding the number of babies who could be expected to require ECMO, the early neonatal deaths for the state of Georgia were reviewed for the 2-year period 1983-1984. By means of both linked birth and death certificate analysis and chart review of infants with a birth weight of 2500 g or more, identification was made of 36 infants whom we classified as potential ECMO candidates. These infants were thought to represent 80% of all infants who would have received ECMO during the 2 years, resulting in an estimate of 1 patient receiving ECMO per 3717 live births for the state. With a predicted survival rate of 80% for this group, the state neonatal mortality rate would have declined by 0.13 per 1000 live births, a decrease of 1.4%.\r"

After an overnight fast and a standard breakfast, 20 healthy 9- to 10-year-old children were given the treatments in a double-blind crossover design at 10:30 AM. Lunch was served at 12:00 noon. In experiment 1, the treatment consisted of an ice slurry of strawberry Kool-Aid containing 1.75 g/kg of carbohydrate (polycose) plus either aspartame (34 mg/kg) or the equivalent sweetness as sodium cyclamate and amino acids as alanine. In experiment 2, the treatment consisted of a drink of cold unsweetened strawberry Kool-Aid, containing either 1.75 g/kg of sucrose or 9.7 mg/kg of aspartame. Measures of associative learning, arithmetic calculation, activity level, social interaction, and mood were unaffected by treatment in experiment 1. In experiment 2, the only significant treatment effect was that on the frequency of minor and gross motor behaviors, which were less frequent after the consumption of sucrose than after aspartame. Thus, the effect of aspartame on the short-term behavior of healthy 9- to 10-year-old children appears to be related to its absence of metabolic consequences rather than to its amino acid composition and putative neurochemical impact.\r"

Both erythrocytic and hepatic ALA dehydratase activities were extremely low before liver transplantation, but they appeared normal after transplantation. According to results of immunochemical quantification of ALA dehydratase, the level of the enzyme protein in erythrocytes was not different before, during, and after liver transplantation. Immunoquantifiable enzyme concentrations were not substantially different in the patient's own liver as compared with the transplanted liver. These findings indicate that although succinylacetone, an abnormal metabolite produced in tyrosinemia, is a potent inhibitor of the activity of ALA dehydratase, it has a far less effect on the synthesis of the enzyme protein.\r"

  ".W": "The medical records of 43 hemodynamically stable children with elevated serum transaminase levels (aspartate aminotransferase [AST] and alanine aminotransferase [ALT]) who underwent abdominal computed tomographic (CT) scan for blunt abdominal trauma were reviewed. Nineteen patients (44.2%) had AST levels greater than 450 IU/L and ALT levels greater than 250 IU/L, and 17 of these 19 patients had hepatic injury identified on abdominal CT scan. Of the 43 patients, 25 (58.1%) had AST and ALT levels of less than 450 IU/L and 250 IU/L, respectively, and none of these patients had evidence of hepatic injury on CT scan. Elevated serum transaminase levels (AST greater than 450 IU/L and ALT greater than 250 IU/L) identified all of the patients with hepatic injury visible on abdominal CT scan. The sensitivity and specificity of elevated serum transaminase levels were 100% and 92.3%, respectively, for predicting hepatic injury. It is recommended that hemodynamically stable pediatric patients with blunt abdominal trauma and AST levels greater than 450 IU/L and/or ALT levels greater than 250 IU/L undergo abdominal CT scan to determine the presence and extent of hepatic injury. Children with serum transaminase levels below these values are at decreased risk of liver injury.\r"

According to electrocardiographic results, there was a third-degree atrioventricular block that rapidly progressed to cardiac arrest. Following successful cardiopulmonary resuscitation, mechanical ventilation and resuscitation with intravenous normal saline, calcium chloride and dopamine were required to restore perfusion, reverse metabolic acidosis, and stabilize vital signs. Complications related to nifedipine intoxication included the development of pulmonary edema and possible infarction in the posterior parietal and occipital lobes associated with cortical blindness and the development of seizures with an abnormal electroencephalogram. The patient recovered without clinically apparent residua. Massive nifedipine overdose in infants represents a potentially life-threatening event that requires prompt medical attention. Reported cases of nifedipine intoxication were reviewed and therapeutic interventions were discussed.\r"

  ".W": "Treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), one of the most common behavioral disorders in children in the United States, remains controversial because of concern about stimulant medication use. Extending a previous study of pediatricians, the present study surveyed a random national sample of family practitioners and then directly screened 457 patients of 10 pediatricians and family practitioners in two small midwestern cities. Responses to the national survey indicated that stimulant medication remains the main treatment prescribed by primary care physicians for children with ADHD. In the direct patient screening, the prevalence of ADHD diagnoses was 5.3% (pediatricians) and 4.2% (family practitioners) of all elementary-school-aged children screened. Eighty-eight percent of these children were treated with methylphenidate. Although medication was considered an effective treatment by the parents of 85% of the children given the medication, efficacy was unrelated to the accuracy of diagnosis. When explicit DSM-III-R criteria were used, only 72% of those assigned a diagnosis of ADHD by the physicians would have received that diagnosis based on a structured psychiatric interview with the parents and only 53% received that diagnosis based on teacher report of symptoms, even when the child was not receiving medication. Although the majority of physicians (in both the surveys and the direct screenings) reported using at least some behavioral treatments with their patients, parents reported infrequent use of nonpharmacologic forms of therapy, such as behavior modification. These data thus indicate a relatively modest rate of stimulant medication use for ADHD, but a serious underuse of systematic behavioral treatments in primary care.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "High-voltage electrical trauma frequently results in extensive and scattered destruction of skeletal muscle along the current path. The damage is commonly believed to be mediated by heating. Recent experimental and theoretical evidence suggests, however, that the rhabdomyolysis and secondary myoglobin release that occur also can result from electroporation, a purely nonthermal mechanism. Based on the results of a computer simulation of a typical high-voltage electric shock, we have postulated that electroporation contributes substantially to skeletal muscle damage and could be the primary mechanism of damage in some cases of electrical injury. In this study, we determined the threshold field strength and exposure duration required to produce rhabdomyolysis by the electroporation mechanism. The change in the electrical impedance of intact skeletal muscle tissue following the application of short-duration, high-intensity electric field pulses is used as an indicator of membrane damage. Our experiments show that a decrease in impedance magnitude occurs following electric field pulses that exceed threshold values of 60 V/cm magnitude and 1-ms duration. The field strength, pulse duration, and number of pulses are factors that determine the extent of damage. The effect does not depend on excitation-contraction coupling. Electron micrographs confirm structural defects created in the membranes by the applied electric field pulses, and these represent the first clear demonstration of rhabdomyolysis in intact muscle due to electroporation. These results provide compelling evidence in support of our postulate.\r"

They are arranged in a vertical row from the level of the pectoralis major insertion down to a few centimeters above the medial epicondyle. Multiple fasciocutaneous flaps can be outlined utilizing these vessels, with either pedicled or island designs, proximally or distally based. Twelve clinical cases are reported. Axillary and elbow-crease contractures can be released with island flaps, and thumb and hand defects can be covered in a cross-arm fashion. Other clinical applications are suggested as well. The special quality of the skin transposed in this way, the simplicity of the surgical technique, and the circulatory reliability are the main advantages of these versatile flaps.\r"

  ".W": "Thrombosis is the end result of two closely interrelated processes: the coagulation cascade and the platelet aggregation process. To determine their relative contribution, we used pharmacologic agents that selectively block each process. The specific effect of each pharmacologic agent on either fibrin deposition or platelet activity was confirmed morphologically by scanning electron microscopy and was substantiated with ADP-induced platelet aggregation and blood clotting time determinations. Forty-two rats had both femoral arteries subjected to a standardized crush-avulsion injury. A total of 84 femoral microvascular anastomoses were subsequently performed. None of the 24 control anastomoses treated with saline remained patent, whereas 6 of 24 of the anastomoses treated with dazmagrel (a selective thromboxane synthetase and platelet aggregation inhibitor), 2.5 mg/kg IV, remained patent and 18 of 24 of those treated with a single dose of heparin, 200 U/kg IV, remained patent. All 12 anastomoses treated with both drugs remained patent but developed a 33 percent hematoma rate. We conclude that in this microvascular model, fibrin mesh deposition is a more significant factor than platelet aggregation in the pathogenesis of occlusional thrombosis within traumatized arteries. Its temporary inhibition with a single dose of heparin yielded a 75 percent improvement in patency rate.\r"

The majority of patients were treated in two stages with cross-facial nerve graft as the first stage and microvascular muscle transfer at the second stage. The gracilis muscle was used in 62 patients. A system of grading results has been utilized in the long-term evaluation. The overall final result was excellent or good in 51 percent of 47 patients who were available for follow-up. Although the results are not completely satisfactory, they justify the use of this approach to a difficult clinical problem. The results are improving as technical modifications to the procedure have evolved. The gracilis muscle is a reliable free transfer with internal anatomy conductive to use for reanimation of the paralyzed face. This type of transfer, in our experience, has proved superior to nonmicrosurgical methods for treatment of complete and severe incomplete facial palsy. The seventh cranial nerve is used in the innervation of the transferred muscle, the ipsilateral being preferable if available. The authors believe that use of the same cranial nerve is superior to methods that involve other cranial nerves, where spontaneity is often not achieved.\r"

This paper presents a 10-year experience of 14 patients who underwent external ear repositioning. In this technique, a posterior incision is used to mobilize surrounding soft tissues circumferentially around the external auditory canal, which then serves as an axis for anterior rotation and elevation. Elevation of up to 8 mm and rotation up to 30 degrees can be achieved. Further elevation is limited by the ensuing constriction and resistance of the external auditory canal. More rotation can be achieved with a Z-plasty transposition of an inferiorly based postauricular skin flap.\r"

As a result, we have achieved reasonable symmetry, good color match, appropriate thickness, and no conspicuous facial scarring in every patient.\r"

Twenty-five combinations of interfragmentary wiring and miniplate and screw fixation of fractured zygomas on human skulls were compared for postreduction rotational stability against stresses simulating the muscular forces that act to displace the zygoma once it has been reduced. Analysis of the data suggests that while three-point fixation using either miniplates or interosseous wires allows for virtually no displacement, two-point fixation and in some cases one-point fixation provide acceptable stability. In general, stable fixation is achieved by methods that involve the use of at least one miniplate and incorporate the frontozygomatic suture line as one of the points of fixation.\r"

The dorsal elevation is thus tailored to fit the imperfection at hand, resulting in a smooth, natural-looking nasal contour. The indications for each type of graft are reviewed, and the surgical technique of graft harvesting and carving is detailed and illustrated.\r"

A Skoog-type sub-SMAS dissection is extended superiorly over the zygomaticus muscles and medially beyond the nasolabial folds, totally releasing all SMAS attachments and creating a thick musculocutaneous flap comprised of skin, all subcutaneous fat of the cheeks, and the platysma muscle. Four-hundred and three patients have been operated on with minimal complications. Dramatic postoperative improvements in the nasolabial folds are demonstrated, and the step-by-step techniques for the face and neck dissection are described.\r"

  ".U": "90295543\r", 
  ".W": "Estrogen promotes secondary female sex characteristics, including breast enlargement. Since excessive breast hypertrophy is unrelated to elevated serum estrogen levels, it has been postulated that the enlarged breast is a hypersensitive \"target organ.\" At the cellular level, estrogen crosses the cell membrane, is bound to a cytoplasmic estrogen receptor (ER), and induces the formation of specific anabolic proteins. In breast cancer, this estrogen receptor is regarded as a measure of the sensitivity of the cell to estrogen. To determine if mammary hypertrophy is related to an increase in the number of estrogen receptors, we assayed breast tissue, not fat, from 25 consecutive breast reductions. The median age of patients was 26 years (17 to 77 years), with 752 gm per breast removed on average. Twenty-four percent of the patients were taking estrogens, primarily birth control bills. Cellular estrogen-receptor status was measured by a standardized cytosol extraction radioactive estradiol technique. Estrogen receptors were undetectable (less than 3 fmol/mg cytosol protein) in all patients. We conclude that estrogen receptors alone, and hence estrogen, are not a determinant in mammary hypertrophy. If the enlarged breast is a \"target organ,\" it is by another mechanism.\r"

In fact, the inferior pedicle is a posterior pedicle with an inferior border. After systematically and progressively reducing this inferior border, I have completely eliminated it. The pure posterior pedicle that results is independent of the inframammary fold. It is vascularized by means of the pectoral muscle and fascia, as has been demonstrated by injection studies of the thoracoacromial artery in fresh cadavers. The resulting mammary reduction technique retains the advantages of the inferior pedicle technique while avoiding its major inconveniences: dependence on the inframammary fold, bulging at the inferior base of the pedicle, and the necessity of low positioning for the breast.\r"

Previous authors have stated that transaxillary augmentation is only applicable to a small subset of the general population and is contraindicated in mild degrees of ptosis or in large augmentations. The new approach, augmentation by disruption of the extended pectoral fascia technique and the parenchymal sweep maneuver, prevents high-riding implants and double folds. By disrupting the fascia, the lower portion of the implant is able to sit in a partially subglandular rather than subfascial plane. The anatomy and clinical implications of the extended pectoral fascia are discussed, as is the augmentation by disruption of the extended pectoral fascia technique. The parenchymal sweep maneuver is also described. Clinical cases are presented.\r"

No cases of endocarditis caused by C. xerosis or N. flavescens and only one case caused by N. subflava have previously been reported in association with narcotic addiction. The prominent clinical features in all patients included poor response to antibiotic therapy, persistent fever, and major embolic events. Stigmata of infection with human immunodeficiency virus, as manifested by oral candidiasis, cervical lymphadenopathy, and serologic evidence, were present in two of the three patients. At our institution, where Staphylococcus aureus remains the most frequent etiologic agent of narcotic-associated endocarditis, the occurrence of these three cases in a 9-month period is striking. We speculate that infection with human immunodeficiency virus may play a role in the pathogenesis of endocarditis caused by these unusual organisms.\r"

Ordinarily sterile sites were the source of 233 isolates. Moraxella nonliquefaciens, the most common isolate (356 strains), was recovered from upper respiratory or ocular sites in 208 (58%) of the cases. Moraxella osloensis was next most common (199 strains) but was the most frequent blood isolate (44 cases). K. kingae appeared especially invasive, with 58 of 78 isolates from blood, bone, or joint. Of the K. kingae strains, 75% were recovered from children under 6 years, compared with 23% of the other strains from that age group (P less than .01). Of the 74 isolates of group M-5, 53 were from wounds caused by dog bites; no other organism in this series was recovered from such wounds. Sixteen of the 28 M. urethralis isolates were from urine. Cases occurred as single infections, with no evidence of clusters. Of patients with infection of ordinarily sterile sites, 9.3% died; only bacteremia, meningitis, and empyema caused fatalities. Most referring laboratories (98%) had not identified the organisms to species, and only 30% had identified them to correct genus. Susceptibility testing by broth dilution revealed low MICs of penicillin (mean, 0.3; 64% less than 1 micrograms/mL). Moraxella, M. urethralis, M-5, M-6, and Kingella are important but frequently misidentified pathogens for humans; penicillin appears to be the treatment of choice.\r"

Control of infection was obtained in 13 of 13 patients treated initially with resection arthroplasty, and 11 of these were ambulatory at follow-up. Infection was controlled in three of 10 knees treated initially with debridement, and six of these nine patients were ambulatory at follow-up. One patient was initially treated with amputation. Four of four patients treated by resection arthroplasty and then by reimplantation were ambulatory without signs of infection at follow-up. Resection arthroplasty reliably controls infection but produces a painful unstable joint that requires brace support or subsequent surgery for pain-free ambulation. Reimplantation in selected patients offers the best chance for pain-free ambulation.\r"

We describe a previously healthy Hispanic man who developed S. arizonae bacteremia as his initial manifestation of infection with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). The patient ultimately stated that he had consumed rattlesnake meat for medicinal purposes--a relatively common practice among Hispanics. S. arizonae was cultured from the powder of all capsules remaining in his possession.

All isolates were susceptible in vitro to vancomycin, mercury, silver, cadmium, and malachite green, and 95.2% of isolates were susceptible to cephalothin; a dominant biotype, four resistotypes (ion-dye resistance patterns), and four antibiotypes (antibiotic resistance patterns) were found. A high percentage of isolates (76.7%) produced slime, and several potentially toxic exoproteins were detected in various and generally lower proportions. The main clinical features of SEB were high frequency in male patients greater than 40 years of age, fever, leukocytosis, anemia, and phlebitis. Indwelling devices were the most common portal of entry. The overall death rate was 36.9%.

  ".W": "The vast repertoire of immunoglobulins and T cell receptors is generated, in part, by V(D)J recombination, a series of genomic rearrangements that occur specifically in developing lymphocytes. The recombination activating gene, RAG-1, which is a gene expressed exclusively in maturing lymphoid cells, was previously isolated. RAG-1 inefficiently induced V(D)J recombinase activity when transfected into fibroblasts, but cotransfection with an adjacent gene, RAG-2, has resulted in at least a 1000-fold increase in the frequency of recombination. The 2.1-kilobase RAG-2 complementary DNA encodes a putative protein of 527 amino acids whose sequence is unrelated to that of RAG-1. Like RAG-1, RAG-2 is conserved between species that carry out V(D)J recombination, and its expression pattern correlates precisely with that of V(D)J recombinase activity. In addition to being located just 8 kilobases apart, these convergently transcribed genes are unusual in that most, if not all, of their coding and 3' untranslated sequences are contained in single exons. RAG-1 and RAG-2 might activate the expression of the V(D)J recombinase but, more likely, they directly participate in the recombination reaction.\r"

  ".W": "The ability of transposable elements (TEs) to insert into or excise out of a genetic locus can be regulated by genetic, environmental, and developmental factors. Tissue- or organ-specific activity of TEs is a frequent and well-characterized example of spatial, developmental regulation. Regulation of the timing of TE activity during ontogeny is less well understood. To analyze timing, TE-induced variegation was quantified in the aleurone of maize kernels, a tissue composed of only a single layer of cells, and sector sizes were assigned to specific cell divisions in aleurone development. Three TE families, Mu, Spm, and Ac/Ds, were studied at two genetic loci. It was found that the frequency of transposon excision changes drastically (up to 30-fold increase or equivalent decrease) during the proliferation of the aleurone. Moreover, these changes occur at the same cell divisions in all three TE families. These results suggest that the timing of TE excision during maize development can be controlled by the host.\r"

Although clathrin-coated vesicles mediate the export of mannose 6-phosphate receptors from the TGN, nothing is known about the transport vesicles used to carry these receptors back to the TGN. Two different in vitro assays used in this study show that an antibody that interferes with clathrin assembly blocks receptor-mediated endocytosis of transferrin, but has no effect on the recycling of the 300-kilodalton mannose 6-phosphate receptor from prelysosomes to the TGN. These results suggest that the transport of mannose 6-phosphate receptors from prelysosomes to the TGN does not involve clathrin.\r"

The necessary \"oxyanion hole\" and substrate binding pocket for acetyltyrosine ethyl ester, a classical ChTr substrate, were included in the design. The four chains were linked covalently at their carboxyl ends. The peptide has affinity for ChTr ester substrates similar to that of ChTr and hydrolyzes them at rates approximately 0.01 that of ChTr; total turnovers greater than 100 have been observed. The peptide is inhibited by ChTr specific inhibitors and is inactive toward benzoyl arginine ethyl ester, a trypsin substrate. The peptide is inactivated by heating above 60 degrees C, but recovers full catalytic activity upon cooling and lyophilization from acetic acid.\r"

The complementary DNA for such a cofactor was cloned and found to encode a 418-amino acid protein homologous to the retinal protein arrestin. The protein, termed beta-arrestin, was expressed and partially purified. It inhibited the signaling function of beta ARK-phosphorylated beta-adrenergic receptors by more than 75 percent, but not that of rhodopsin. It is proposed that beta-arrestin in concert with beta ARK effects homologous desensitization of beta-adrenergic receptors.\r"

This incertocortical pathway was found to project bilaterally to the entire neocortex and exhibited a rough corticotopic organization. Many of the zona incerta neurons projecting to the parietal and occipital cortices could also be immunohistochemically stained with antibodies to glutamic acid decarboxylase and GABA. Few of these neurons were immunoreactive to tyrosine hydroxylase antibodies, which identify dopamine-containing neurons. Injections in the frontal and entorhinal cortices labeled many neurons near or within the dopaminergic A13 subdivision of the zona incerta. In addition, the incertocortical system was found to be significantly larger during early postnatal (2 to 3 weeks) development. The projection pattern of this newly discovered pathway resembles that of the monoaminergic and cholinergic systems, arising from the brainstem and forebrain, suggesting possible similarities of function.\r"

However, data comparing the complications of loop colostomy closure and end colostomy takedown and anastomosis are sparse. We analyzed data from 93 consecutive colostomy closures, of which 62 were loop and 31 were end colostomies. The two groups were comparable with respect to age, the underlying disease and risk factors, such as coronary artery disease, diabetes, hypertension, steroid dependence, hypoalbuminemia and smoking. Closure of end colostomies took longer and was associated with more loss of blood than closure of loop colostomies. However, the mortality rates for closure of loop (4.8 per cent) and end (3.2 per cent) colostomies were not significantly different. The complication rates were identical (16 per cent). Although none of the other risk factors were associated with increased rates of mortality or morbidity, the detrimental effects of steroid dependence and preoperative hypoalbuminemia were striking. All four of the deaths and 60 per cent of the complications occurred in patients with steroid dependence or hypoalbuminemia, or both. The rates of wound infection after primary or secondary closure of the stoma site were not significantly different. We concluded that loop colostomy closure is not associated with fewer complications than closure of end colostomy, even though the latter takes longer and is more difficult. Hypoalbuminemic and steroid-dependent patients should undergo colostomy closure with caution, if at all. Primary closure of the stomal site is safe and reduces the length of hospital stay.\r"

Most authorities have argued against routine testing of patients preoperatively for HIV infection because it would not prevent or reduce the risk of infection to health care workers. They agree with the policy of the Centers for Disease Control that advocates universal precautions for all patients. Surgeons have not been reassured by these arguments. They claim that their exposure to blood during operation exposes them to increased risk of infection. The risk of acquiring HIV from a single needle-stick injury is low. However, most surgeons are interested in their lifetime risk of infection. In this study, a mathematical model for predicting the risk of acquiring HIV in patients in a given hospital and the total number of needle-stick injuries are given. Using minimal likely HIV seroprevalence, this model predicts that at least 47 of the approximately 18,000 Fellows of the American College of Surgeons would become infected. New data showing early treatment can lead to increased longevity in infected patients with HIV, the fact that many health care workers do not follow universal precautions and other arguments are put forward to support a suggested routine--voluntary testing of all surgical patients for antibody to HIV.\r"

  ".W": "We have reviewed the Auckland experience (1969 to 1987) of 212 instances of carcinoma of the thyroid gland. Females outnumbered males by 4:1, the average age of the patients was 46 years and differentiated cancer was more common (180) than either anaplastic (20) or medullary carcinoma (12). The incidence was higher in the Polynesian patients, most of whom were born outside of New Zealand, than in Maori or European patients, most of whom were born in New Zealand. Patients with papillary carcinoma fared well with greater than 90 per cent of the patients alive at the time of the study, while the corresponding figure for follicular carcinoma was 70 per cent. For both types of differentiated carcinoma of the thyroid gland, the best results, in terms of outcome and morbidity, occurred after total ipsilateral lobectomy and partial contralateral lobectomy (TL + CLPL). In neither type of operation was the use of an adjuvant radioiodine therapy of any obvious benefit. The incidence of permanent complications was twice as high after total thyroidectomy than for TL + CLPL. In contrast with the situation regarding adjuvant radioiodine, patients who presented with systemic follicular carcinomatosis responded well to therapeutic radioiodine, and if thyroidectomy could also be accomplished, the outcome was good. Most patients with anaplastic carcinoma presented with unresectable disease and no regimen used made any impact on the biologic factors of the disease. All but one of the patients with medullary carcinoma had the sporadic variant, and the results were similar after performing either unilateral operation or total thyroidectomy. Carcinoma of the thyroid is more common in Polynesians born in Pacific Islands than in Caucasians or Maoris born in New Zealand. For differentiated carcinoma of the thyroid gland, a satisfactory combination of outcome and morbidity is accomplished with TL + CLPL. Although therapeutic radioiodine is effective in patients with metastatic differentiated carcinoma of the thyroid, we could not show that surgical treatment plus adjuvant radioiodine yielded better results than surgical treatment alone. The major prognostic factors governing the outcome were the histologic type (most patients with papillary carcinoma survive; most patients with anaplastic carcinoma die irrespective of treatment, and patients with follicular and medullary lesions have an in-between outlook) and the presence of systemic disease. The presence of regional disease did not appear to influence the outcome.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

We present our experience with 53 PermCath catheters placed in 49 patients (eight to 80 years old). Twenty-two catheters were used for initiation of dialysis, 17 as a bridge to permanent hemoaccess, two as a bridge to peritoneal dialysis and 12 for chronic hemoaccess. We have achieved better success with insertion of catheters through the jugular system (external in 22 instances and internal in 30) by cutdown with fluoroscopic positioning of the catheter tip at the second to third intercostal space. Arterial port alignment was toward the center of the vena cava to reduce sucking against the caval wall during dialysis. No catheter failed to function with this positioning technique. Average catheter use was 84 days with a range of one to 573 days. Catheter thrombosis occurred 40 times in ten patients and was treated successfully in all with the infusion of streptokinase or urokinase. Four patients received chronic warfarin for repeated clotting. Four patients had catheter sepsis that resolved with removal of the catheter and administration of antibiotics. We conclude that the PermCath is an improved means for hemoaccess with a low complication rate. Our key to successful functioning of the PermCath is careful fluoroscopic positioning of the catheter tip.\r"

BE had a positive predictive value of 88 per cent and a negative predictive value of 95 per cent in this study. No complications resulted from the use of BE in this study, which included three instances of perforated appendicitis. We conclude that emergent BE is an inexpensive, safe and readily available adjunct to the diagnosis of acute appendicitis. Its use in the presence of a clear-cut presentation of acute appendicitis is not necessary. When clinical data were equivocal, BE reduced the rate of negative laparotomy to 7.2 per cent.\r"

A retrospective review was done to document whether or not implementation of this program significantly changed the method of discovery of carcinoma of the breast and the stage of carcinoma of the breast at presentation in the patients we studied. Women diagnosed with carcinoma of the breast during a three year period, prior to the institution of the screening program (group 1) were compared with a similar set of patients diagnosed after establishment of the program (group 2). There were 165 patients in group 1 and 181 in group 2. The vast majority of cancers for those in group 1, 84.2 per cent, were discovered at self-examination, as compared with 46.3 per cent for those in group 2. Forty-eight per cent of the cancers for those in group 2 were first discovered by mammography as compared with 6.1 per cent in group 1. There was no statistical difference in the number of patients presenting with stage O, III and IV disease. The percentage of patients presenting with stage I disease rose significantly after the establishment of the mammography program (16.4 per cent in group 1 to 41.5 per cent in group 2). Findings from this study confirm that a mammographic screening program can have a marked effect on lowering the stage of carcinoma of the breast at presentation. The current recommendations for screening mammography should be implemented. Doing so will result in earlier detection and improved survival in this group of patients.\r"

  ".U": "90296248\r", 
  ".W": "A group of 548 patients was analyzed retrospectively to determine risk factors, particularly the perioperative administration of blood, for postoperative septic complications after intra-abdominal operations. Of the entire group, 198 (36.1 per cent) had at least one complication. The postoperative mortality rate was 0.9 per cent. Using univariate analysis, blood transfusion, serum protein concentration, gastric malignant disease, total gastrectomy, anastomotic dehiscence, diabetes mellitus, the surgeon and perioperative antibiotics were significant factors influencing the rate of postoperative septic complications. After adjustment for all these factors, logistic regression analysis was used to study the effect of perioperative blood transfusion. Age, serum protein concentration, antibiotics, extended malignant disease of the colon, gastric operation, total colectomy, operation performed by staff members and anastomotic dehiscence were significant independent factors. Blood transfusion per se was not significant (p = 0.07). In patients who received more than 3 units of blood, the postoperative septic complication rate was significantly elevated (p = 0.003). We conclude that the perioperative administration of blood may negatively influence the risk of developing postoperative septic complications after intra-abdominal operations.\r"

Sterile paper tape had adequate adhesive and supporting strength in the closure of abdominal wounds. The wounds closed with paper tape healed well and had satisfactory cosmetic results. Paper tape is a nonexpensive and convenient alternative to close abdominal wounds.\r"

Preoperative temperature, leukocyte count, total bilirubin, amylase and alkaline phosphatase levels were not significantly different between the groups. Nine retained stones were demonstrated by postoperative cholangiography among the patients in group 1 as compared with three retained stones noted in those in group 2. This difference was not significant. Postoperative mortality and complication rates were unaffected by the performance of an endoscopic study of the biliary tract during ductal exploration. Choledochoscopy added an average of 36 minutes to the duration of the operative procedure (p less than 0.001). Choledochoscopy may prove helpful in selected instances, but the current data do not support its routine use during exploration of the common bile duct.\r"

Horseradish peroxidase was given intravenously to assess the integrity of the barrier by transmission electron microscopy. Permeation of the tracer into the vessel was noted only in animals with increased intracranial pressure. A sudden rise in intracranial pressure is suggested to trigger acute barrier disruption following subarachnoid hemorrhage.\r"

Many variables were analyzed to ascertain what might be responsible for the differences in outcome. The Glasgow Coma Scale score before neurosurgical intervention was identified, using the logistic regression model, as a significant prognostic predictor. Mortality rate was 40.6%, with two patients left in a vegetative state. Surgically correctable intracranial mass lesions occurred in 29 cases. The most important factors in salvaging these patients are rapid diagnosis and immediate surgical decompression before irreversible brain damage sets in.\r"

Eight of these patients died, and those surviving had poorer neurological outcomes than corresponding patients with identical Glasgow Coma Scale scores on admission. In the management of severe shearing injury patients, more attention should be given to the presence of interpeduncular high-density spots as well as other important diagnostic computed tomography findings regarding diffuse brain injury.\r"

Thirty-two patients presented with local mass effect, which was the most common mode of presentation, while 26 patients had subarachnoid hemorrhage. Three patients presented with transient ischemic attacks and three patients presented with seizures. In 16 cases the giant intracranial aneurysm involved the cavernous sinus and indirect surgery was performed. Ten patients were treated with extracranial-intracranial bypass and gradual occlusion of the proximal internal carotid artery. Six patients were treated with extracranial-intracranial bypass and trapping of the aneurysm (sudden occlusion of internal carotid artery). Sudden occlusion was poorly tolerated, and 50% of the patients developed ischemic complications. In 46 cases of giant intracranial aneurysm without involvement of the cavernous sinus, direct surgery was undertaken. In 31 patients the aneurysm could be clipped without compromise to the surrounding vessels. In 15 patients there was compromise of surrounding vessels or the aneurysm sac was excised and so microvascular reconstruction was needed. Local intracranial reconstruction was preferred whenever feasible. The results of patients who needed reconstruction were similar to those who did not need reconstruction. Overall, 84% of patients had an excellent or good outcome after surgery. The mortality was 5%.\r"

To determine the frequency, cause, and best mode of treatment of this problem, we performed a chart review of all patients with a diagnosis of subclavian vein thrombosis at two major metropolitan hospitals during a 6-year period. A total of 40 patients were identified with subclavian vein thrombosis, which represented 3.5% of all venous thromboses detected during the 6-year period. No side or sex predilection was noted and the majority of patients were outpatients. The cause was fairly evenly divided among intravenous catheters (32%), anatomic abnormalities (45%), and carcinoma with postoperative radiation (22.5%). Despite the increasing use of the subclavian veins for pacemaker leads, hyperalimentation, and permanent intravenous access for chemotherapy, there has not been an increase in diagnosed subclavian vein thrombosis. Anatomic abnormalities with compression of the vein respond well to either heparinization or lytic therapy but require surgery if the venous abnormality persists. Treatment consisted of lytic therapy in 20%, heparinization in 55%, and elevation with removal of the central line in 25% of patients. All patients responded well to treatment, with a decrease in swelling and symptoms; no patient progressed to venous gangrene and only one (2.5%) had a documented pulmonary embolus. Medical treatment provides excellent long-term benefit in most cases unless complicated by an anatomic abnormality.\r"

The lymphocele rate was 7%; the wound infection rate was 5%; and the skin edge necrosis rate was 0.8%. One patient (0.8%) experienced both lymphocele and wound infection. Neurapraxia developed in the distribution of the musculocutaneous nerve in two patients (2%); this resolved completely in 3 to 4 weeks and was not observed again, since hyperextension of the arm has been carefully avoided during the procedure. Transient arm edema was noted postoperatively in five patients (4%), and the edema responded promptly and completely to elevation of the arm for 1 to 2 weeks. There was no permanent edema even after ligation and resection of the distal portion of the axillary vein (six patients). Permanent arm edema has not developed in any of the 133 patients, indicating that axillary node dissection as performed for malignant melanoma is not associated with the long-term complications occurring after mastectomy and axillary node dissection.\r"

Pneumonectomy was carried out, complicated in each case by rupture of the fragile, incomplete pseudocapsule and diffuse dissemination of necrotic tumor tissue in the operative field and opposite bronchial tree. Outcome was fatal in both cases within a few months, with extensive, rapidly growing metastases in the subcutaneous scar tissue of the thoracotomy and in the other lung and in one case with diffuse diaphragmatic and intraabdominal metastases. These two observations will offer some guidelines for better understanding of this rare localization of hemangiopericytoma, its natural history, and its optimal treatment, with special reference to the malignant potential and local recurrence rate.\r"

  ".U": "90296294\r", 
  ".W": "In a period of 2 years 7 months, we performed heat probe (HP) thermocoagulation in 153 cases of massive peptic ulcer hemorrhage. The male/female sex ratio was 125/28. The average age was 57.6 +/- 1.3 years (mean +/- SEM; range, 17 to 88). There were 69 cases (45.1%) of spurting hemorrhage, 50 cases (32.7%) of oozing hemorrhage, and 34 cases (22.2%) of nonbleeding visible vessels. Seventy-seven patients (50.3%) were in shock before therapy. After therapy we obtained initial success in 147 cases (96.1%). Rebleeding episodes occurred in 23 patients (15.6%) within 1 month after therapy. Nineteen patients received a second therapy, and treatment in 15 of these cases (78.9%) was ultimately successful. Finally, treatment in 142 cases (92.8%) was ultimately successful. The duration of hospitalization was 6.3 +/- 0.4 days (mean +/- SEM). After discharge all patients were followed at the outpatient department for at least 1 month. Sixty-seven patients were followed endoscopically for at least 2 to 3 months after therapy. Fifty-six patients (83.6%) had a healed scar at the previous bleeding site 2 months after therapy, and 62 patients (92.5%) had a healed scar 3 months after therapy. We conclude that HP thermocoagulation is an ideal and reliable modality of therapeutic endoscopy in arrest of massive peptic ulcer hemorrhage. HP thermocoagulation may become the first choice of therapy for massive peptic ulcer bleeding in the near future.\r"

However, chronic obstruction may begin insidiously and its symptoms may reflect other gastrointestinal diseases. Two patients are described who developed acute abdominal pain, marked hyperamylasemia, and palpable abdominal masses 5 and 15 years after Billroth II gastrectomy. The masses were initially interpreted as pancreatic pseudocysts. Both patients were found to have chronically obstructed afferent limbs, and in one the obstruction was associated with hundreds of stasis stones within the afferent limb. Surgical decompression was accomplished in each patient. Patients who have undergone Billroth II reconstruction have signs, symptoms, and laboratory findings consistent with acute pancreatitis. A history of previous gastrectomy, recurrent or severe abdominal pain, hyperamylasemia with characteristic tomography, and endoscopic findings will establish the diagnosis and necessitate surgical evaluation and intervention.\r"

  ".W": "The lung and systemic physiologic response to endotoxin is markedly accentuated in the presence of a body burn. Our purpose was to determine whether early burn excision and closure would decrease this response. We compared the endotoxin (2 micrograms/kg)-induced response in 10 adult sheep with lung and soft-tissue lymph fistulas 3 days after a 15% total-body surface full-thickness burn that was excised immediately with that of sheep without burn excision and nonburned sheep. No infection was present in the burn wound. Early excision prevented the ongoing postburn lipid peroxidation and lung inflammation seen 3 days after burn before endotoxemia in animals with 15% total body surface burn wound not excised. Sheep that underwent excision demonstrated significantly less pulmonary hypertension and hypoxia after endotoxin than did either endotoxin-treated and intact burned sheep or endotoxin-treated nonburned sheep. Lung inflammatory changes as determined by neutrophil content of lung tissue and the increase in lung tissue malondialdehyde in the group that underwent burn excision after endotoxin were comparable to those seen with endotoxin alone, as was the lung lymph-flow response. Also, the systemic response was nearly identical to that seen with endotoxin alone with no increase in soft-tissue permeability as measured by lymph flow. Oxygen consumption (VO2) remained unchanged from baseline. In contrast, VO2 doubled in burn-intact animals initially after endotoxin, after which VO2 decreased to levels below baseline. An increase in soft-tissue vascular permeability was also noted. We can conclude that early burn excision and closure prevent the accentuated response to endotoxin that is seen when the burn wound is left intact, even if it is uninfected.\r"

The purpose of this study was to investigate the possible role of oxygen free radicals, generated at reperfusion, in the pathogenesis of the compartment syndrome secondary to acute arterial ischemia/reperfusion. A reproducible model of this syndrome was produced in anesthetized rabbits by femoral artery occlusion after surgical devascularization of collateral branches from the aorta to the popliteal artery. Increasing periods of ischemia from 6 to 12 hours, followed by 2 hours of reperfusion, were associated with corresponding increases in the anterior muscle compartment hydrostatic pressure and inversely proportional decreases in tibialis anterior muscle blood flow within that compartment as assessed by xenon 133 washout (n = 46) (r = -0.62, p less than 0.001). Anterior compartment pressure increased from 5 +/- 1 to 48 +/- 5 mm Hg (n = 46) (p less than 0.001) after 7 hours of total arterial ischemia and 2 hours of reperfusion. Ablation of free radicals generated from xanthine oxidase with either allopurinol (n = 8) or oxypurinol (n = 8), by scavenging the superoxide radical at reperfusion with superoxide dismutase (n = 8), or by blocking secondary hydroxyl radical formation with deferoxamine (n = 8) significantly ameliorated the rise in compartment pressure (p less than 0.05) in each case; it also significantly improved muscle perfusion in the superoxide dismutase-, allopurinol-, and deferoxamine-treated animals (p less than 0.05). These findings indicate that development of the compartment syndrome after acute arterial revascularization may be due, at least in part, to microvascular injury mediated by oxygen-derived free radicals generated from xanthine oxidase at reperfusion.\r"

  ".W": "This study evaluated two changes in fluorometric assessment of fluorescein dye delivery: (1) monitoring the proportional, rather than the absolute, increase above the preinjection background reading at each site to obviate the effect of skin color and (2) employing gradual means of dye administration to facilitate monitoring uptake kinetics and to lessen the likelihood and severity of histamine-mediated reactions. In 15 beagles, background and postdye readings were obtained with the fiberoptic fluorometer at 27 pairs of matched light- and dark-skin sites of intact perfusion. After dye administration, the absolute increase in fluorescence at light sites averaged more than twice (approximately 225%) that at dark sites. However, the newly introduced proportional increase (PI) was independent of pigmentation. The PI of comparably perfused light and dark sites differed by an average of 3.9% (p greater than 0.05 for difference between PIdark and PIlight). This consistency was maintained after each of three methods of fluorescein administration. After the color independence of the PI was established, its relation to perfusion was assessed in nine 3 X 12 cm pedicle flaps of varied pigmentation. Background fluorometric readings were obtained at eight sites along the longitudinal axis of each flap. Dye was administered as a 20-minute 0.25 mg/kg/min infusion. The PI clearly delineated gradations in perfusion, correlating highly with more time-consuming kinetic indexes and accurately predicting viability. The pedicle row, last viable row (V1), and first nonviable row (N1) had mean PI values of 10.5 +/- 4.5, 4.2 +/- 2.6, and 0.1 +/- 0.1, respectively, at 25 minutes after the start of infusion (p less than 0.05 for pedicle vs V1, pedicle vs N1, and V1 vs N1).\r"

Attempts at modifying parathyroid tissue to facilitate allotransplantation without host immunosuppression are warranted. Cryopreservation has been reported to improve survival of canine parathyroid allografts. We employed a modification of the mixed lymphocyte culture to study the effect in vitro of cryopreservation on human parathyroid tissue. Dispersed parathyroid cells from fresh and previously cryopreserved tissue from 10 patients were incubated with unrelated mononuclear cells for 6 days, and incorporation of tritiated thymidine was measured after a 1-day pulse. Studies with irradiated mononuclear cells and parathyroid cells confirmed the model as a one-way test in which mononuclear cells respond to parathyroid cells but not vice versa. An antigenicity index was computed to express mononuclear cell tritiated thymidine incorporation for similar numbers of viable parathyroid cells. Although absolute values of the antigenicity index varied from patient to patient, there were no consistent differences in the antigenicity index of patients' fresh compared with cryopreserved tissue. In an attempt to identify the cells responsible for immunogenicity, we incubated cytocentrifuged parathyroid cell suspensions with antiserum directed at leukocyte common antigen, a marker of lymphoid tissue. Cell suspensions of parathyroid tissue demonstrated leukocyte common antigen-positive cells (median, 2.7% positive; range, 0% to 16%). There were no consistent differences in the number of leukocyte common antigen-positive cells in fresh compared with cryopreserved tissue, and the number of leukocyte common antigen-positive cells did not correlate with the antigenicity index.\r"

On days 3 and 7 after injury, intestinal blood flow was measured with 51Cr-labeled microspheres, and intestinal mass and composition were analyzed. Burned and infected animals demonstrated a chronic loss of small bowel mass not seen in burned animals without infection by day 7 after injury. Compositional alterations of the small bowels of burned and infected animals included protein wasting similar to but occurring earlier than that seen with anorexia alone and significantly decreased deoxyribonucleic acid and ribonucleic acid content, whereas tissue water content remained unchanged. These chronic intestinal alterations in the burned and infected group could not be explained by ongoing ischemia because intestinal blood flow in these animals was not significantly altered at either time point, implying mediation by other pathophysiologic mechanisms.\r"

It would thus appear that, under conditions of abnormal blood flow, intimal hyperpermeation would be a contributing factor to the intimal thickening of an autogenous vein graft before an autovein graft had completely adapted to the new environment.\r"

This effect may have practical application in the prevention or reduction of transfusion-induced alloimmunization against HLA class I antigens. To study this, platelet concentrates (PCs) were obtained with a cell separator, suspended in autologous plasma in a final volume of 400 mL, and transferred into a large (22 X 30 cm) cell culture bag. This plastic showed a good transmittance of UV-B rays at 310 nm (54%). PCs were placed between two quartz plates (surface of irradiation = 25 X 37 cm), and the two sides were irradiated simultaneously. Energy delivered to the surface of the plastic bag was automatically monitored. The ability to respond (in MLC and to phytohemagglutinin) and to stimulate allogeneic lymphocytes was completely abolished with energy of 0.75 J per cm2 (irradiation time less than 3 min). The temperature increase during irradiation was negligible. Platelet aggregation (collagen, adrenalin, ADP, arachidonic acid, ristocetin) was not impaired if UV-B energy was below 3 J per cm2. Recovery and survival of autologous 111In-labeled platelets were studied in four volunteers; no differences were found between UV-B-treated (1.5 J/cm2) platelets and untreated platelets. These results show that a large-scale clinical trial using UV-B-irradiated PCs to prevent HLA alloimmunization is feasible.\r"

A 1986 article in TRANSFUSION described the recommended methods for conducting such studies in the hope of standardizing methodology and permitting interlaboratory comparison of results. The results obtained with the recommended method have been compared with those of our previous method. With the new method, recovery of fresh random-donor platelets prepared in polyolefin bags was 76 +/- 6 percent with a survival of 9.3 +/- 2.8 days (n = 4). After 5 days of storage, these values were 67 +/- 8 percent and 7.8 +/- 1.9 days. Similar values were obtained for fresh and stored platelets collected on automated cell separators. However, when our previous (pre-1986) method of evaluation was used, recovery of fresh platelets in the polyolefin bags was 56 +/- 11 percent, and survival was 8.6 +/- 1.3 days. The 5-day values were 36 +/- 5 percent and 6.9 +/- 2.7 days. These values are significantly lower (p less than 0.05) than those obtained with the newer method, but they are in agreement with those previously reported for other techniques. Thus, the new method consistently gives higher values, possibly as a result of a less harmful labeling procedure.\r"

Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMNCs) were isolated and cultured for 14 days with or without added pokeweed mitogen (PWM), autologous RBCs, methyldopa, procainamide, and alpha-methylnorepinephrine. Also, isolated B cells were infected with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) to produce polyclonal B-cell lines. Supernatants were tested for IgG and IgM RBC AuAbs by use of 125I-staphylococcal protein A (SPA). RBC AuAbs were detected in PBMNC cultures without additives to the culture medium of four of eight patients who had warm-antibody AIHA or a positive direct antiglobulin test (DAT) without hemolytic anemia. In two of these patients, RBC AuAb production was augmented by the addition of PWM, and in two additional patients, RBC AuAbs were detected only after the addition of PWM. Supernatants from PBMNC cultures from three of four normal donors produced RBC AuAbs independent of the presence of PWM; in two of these subjects, PWM augmented production of RBC AuAbs. PBMNC cultures from three DAT-negative patients with systemic lupus erythematosus produced RBC AuAbs, one in the presence of PWM and two in its absence. With one exception, there was no augmentation of AuAb production by the addition to the culture system of autologous RBCs or drugs. EBV infection of B cells from four patients with AIHA and four normal persons yielded B-cell lines secreting RBC AuAbs. The quantity of RBC AuAb after a 24-hour culture of EBV-transformed B cells was significantly greater in cultures from four patients who had AIHA than in cultures from four normal persons.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Test results were correlated with the percentage of eligible patients that the surgeons actually referred for preoperative donation during a period of observation. The purpose of this preliminary effort was to identify areas in the educational program that required emphasis. Overall, the surgeons' attitude toward preoperative donation was quite favorable, but their depth of knowledge varied. Misunderstandings may have led to diminished use of this service (eg, about 50% didn't realize that many patients with medical conditions or low hematocrits are permitted to donate). However, it is not clear that simply bolstering surgeons' knowledge will increase their appropriate use of preoperative donation. When all 118 surgeons were studied, their knowledge and attitude were unrelated to the percentage of eligible patients referred. However, when 44 surgeons who managed the largest number of eligible patients were analyzed separately, their use of preoperative donation was directly correlated with their knowledge and attitude. The local awareness of AIDS also significantly influenced the use of this service. It is proposed that knowledge of preoperative donation may be important for inducing surgeons to begin referring patients for this service. Once a pattern of successful participation is established, referral seems to increase with the acquisition of working knowledge.\r"

  ".W": "Low-ionic-strength saline (LISS) techniques permit a safe and substantial reduction in incubation time and have therefore become the method of choice for antibody detection and compatibility testing in many transfusion laboratories. Consequently, the supply of reagent red cells (RBCs) in a low-ionic-strength preservative solution would remove the daily need for laboratories to wash and resuspend cells in LISS before use. However, the storage of fresh RBCs at low ionic strength in the presence of aminoglycoside antibiotics can cause a rapid loss of certain antigens, possibly as a result of the release of proteolytic enzymes from contaminating white cells. This article describes a low-ionic-strength solution that achieves preservation of antigens on liquid nitrogen-frozen-thawed RBCs for 21 days' storage at 4 degrees C.\r"

Studies were conducted in vitro to assess the retention of platelet properties after the discontinuation of agitation. Platelets were maintained without agitation in an insulated cardboard container. In one study, platelet concentrates were kept at 20 to 24 degrees C for the entire 24-hour period. In another study, they were kept at 37 degrees C for 6 hours with subsequent storage at ambient room temperature for the remainder of the 24-hour holding period. Under the simulated shipping conditions, discontinuation of agitation for 24 hours between Days 2 and 3 of a 7-day storage period minimally influenced the maintenance of a series of in vitro platelet properties. The maintenance of platelet concentrates at 20 to 24 degrees C, sitting undisturbed on a bench top for 9 hours, after storage for 6 days with continuous agitation, also had no damaging influence.\r"

All lots of commercial human plasma preparation products (heat-treated human plasma protein, albumin, factor VIII or IX products, and immune globulin) examined were found to contain A and/or B antibodies of the IgM or IgG type, with titers of 1 to 1024. Twelve of the 20 lots of immune globulin contained RBC antibodies of the IgG type. Subclass IgG1 was found in all 12 of these lots, and all four subclasses, including IgG3, were detected in 8 lots.

The present study reports two cases of thrombotic episodes following surgery in PPSB-treated hemophilia B patients. Since 1986, there has been available a factor IX (FIX) concentrate depleted of the other vitamin K-dependent clotting factors and virally inactivated by the solvent-detergent method. This preparation has been used as replacement therapy in six patients with severe hemophilia B who were to undergo orthopedic surgery. The management of the patients before and after operation was without any thrombotic complication or undesirable side effects. The present study suggests that there is a need for an FIX preparation devoid of the other vitamin K-dependent clotting factors for long-term therapy of hemophilia B patients.\r"

The carrier rate for HBsAg was 18.6 percent and the frequency of positive HBV marker(s) (HBsAg, anti-HBc, anti-HBs) was 86.4 percent among first-time donors. There is no significant correlation between HBV and HCV infections in Taiwan, because there is no significant difference in the frequency of anti-HCV among donors with or without HBV markers. The frequency of anti-HCV among qualified donors in Taiwan (ALT less than 45 IU/L, not tested for anti-HBc) is 1.8 percent, which is not significantly different from the frequency (1.6%) in donors with normal ALT and negative for HBV marker(s) (qualified donors by Western Standards). Therefore, ALT is the most important surrogate marker for HCV infection in Taiwan.\r"

The copper sulfate test and the microhematocrit usually are performed on blood samples taken from the same finger (or earlobe) puncture. We studied 201 male and female volunteer blood donors who failed the copper sulfate test to determine if more donors would be accepted for donation if blood from a second fingerpuncture, instead of the original fingerstick, was used for the microhematocrit determination. Venous blood samples were obtained to evaluate complete blood count and measures of iron status. The results indicated that the deferral rate was reduced by 46% using a fresh fingerpuncture for the microhematocrit determination. The iron status of the additional donors accepted on the basis of the second puncture was not significantly different from that of the donors accepted by the original fingerstick. We conclude that using a second fresh fingerpuncture for the microhematocrit determination after failing the copper sulfate test decreases the number of hematocrit deferrals and does not compromise the iron status of the additional donors.\r"

The test drugs included Vibramycin, Minocin, quinidine sulfate, Cleocin HCl, Indocin, Tolectin 200, ferrous sulfate, vitamin C, aspirin, Procardia, phenobarbital, Dilantin, Butazolidin, Noctec, K-Dur, and Quinaglute. Artificial saliva (10 mL) was placed in a small beaker along with a pH probe connected to a digital display pH meter and a strip-chart recorder. The salivary pH was measured at baseline and continuously during the dissolution of each test medication and the time taken for complete dissolution was recorded. This experiment was repeated six times for each drug. Baseline and final dissolution pH were compared statistically for differences using the Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed-ranks test. Significance was established at the 0.05 level. Only three medications tested (vitamin C, aspirin, and Dilantin) produced a dissolution pH outside the range of physiological esophageal pH values. Although the majority of the test drugs significantly altered the baseline pH, the final dissolution pH did not fall outside the physiologic range. Nine of the 16 test drugs dissolved completely within 10 minutes, whereas the remaining 7 drugs took 30 minutes or longer (up to 24 hours) to dissolve. We conclude that the dissolution pH of potentially caustic medications does not appear to be a primary mechanism of drug-induced esophageal injury, whereas a rapid dissolution rate may play an important role in the pathogenesis of the lesion.\r"

An antipyrine pharmacokinetic and impedance analysis of 15 healthy male subjects was performed before and on the 14th day of phenobarbital administration (i.e., after enzyme induction). The all subsets multiple regression technique was used to develop preinduction models for clearance (CI), (p = 0.021, R2 = 0.654) and volume of distribution at steady-state (Vdss) (p = 0.001, R2 = 0.867), using demographic and mean BI parameters. The preinduction Cl model significantly underestimated postinduction measurements and was not predictive of changes in Cl. The preinduction Vdss model was predictive of postinduction Vdss. It appears that the BI-derived model is unable to predict perturbations in metabolic clearance caused by enzyme induction.\r"

All admixtures were tested for sterility; bacterial contamination was not observed. Multidose vials saved approximately $197 per 200 admixtures. Drug and personnel costs were reduced when batch manufacturing with 40-mL multidose vials was compared with extemporaneous compounding with unit-dose vials.

Aerosolized pentamidine appears to be better tolerated and is considered an alternative treatment for PCP in both hospital and community settings. This report describes our experience with 34 patients with AIDS who received aerosolized pentamidine at home. All patients were over 18 years old and had received either parenteral or aerosolized pentamidine within a medically supervised setting before home treatment was initiated. The Respigard II nebulizer system powered by an oxygen source was used as the delivery system. All patients took two puffs of metaproterenol sulfate 10 minutes prior to two 15-minute sessions of pentamidine inhalation. No relapse or adverse reactions were observed in patients. Large randomized clinical trials currently are underway to compare the value of aerosolized pentamidine with other forms of treatment for PCP.\r"

On previous occasion of theophylline toxicity, she had a serum theophylline concentration of 27 micrograms/ml but the patient did not experience any seizure. Several reports suggest that the combination of theophylline and ciprofloxacin has an additive inhibitory effect on gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) sites. Inhibition of the binding of GABA to its receptor sites has been related to the convulsant effects of other drugs. The seizure in our patient may have been caused by altered pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics brought about by combined therapy of theophylline and ciprofloxacin.\r"

Acyclovir users were members of Kaiser Permanente (KP), Northwest Region, who received one or more prescriptions for acyclovir from an automated outpatient prescription system over a two-year period (1986 and 1987). KP members with genital herpes were identified from the automated Outpatient Utilization System, which abstracts medical record data from a random sample of about two percent of KP members. Acyclovir users with hospital admissions were identified from the automated KP hospital discharge abstract system. During the two years, there were 2940 users who received a total of 6182 prescriptions for acyclovir; 47 percent used oral acyclovir and 56 percent of prescriptions were for the oral dosage form. Females received two-thirds of the prescriptions, and people 15 through 45 years of age received 80 percent of the prescriptions. The estimated incidence density of oral acyclovir usage was 2.3/1000 KP members. Most oral acyclovir prescriptions were for the treatment of genital herpes. More than 60 percent of the prescriptions appeared to be for first treatment, more than 30 percent for repeat treatment, and about 6 percent for continuing treatment.

  ".W": "Quantitative evaluation of the therapeutic drug monitoring services (TDMS) provided in Kyushu University Hospital from August 1981 to April 1989 was performed. Since 1982, the annual number of assay requests was about 4300-4400, but the annual number of clinical pharmacokinetic consultation services (CPCS) showed a tendency to increase. Antiepileptics were the drugs for which CPCS were most often performed (26.3 percent of the population given drugs for which TDMS was available); digoxin, lithium, and theophylline followed. Preparation of one consultation required 1.5-2.5 hours. Our TDMS team consists of eight members. In 1988, the average time per week spent for CPCS and TDMS was 8.2 and 11.3 hours per member, respectively. Thus, the number of pharmacists performing CPCS and TDMS was 1.2 and 1.7 full-time equivalents, respectively.\r"

Two-dimensional directed M-mode and Doppler echocardiographic examinations were performed in 11 such subjects and 22 age-matched control subjects. Digitized tracings were made from M-mode recordings of the LV and Doppler mitral valve inflow recordings to measure septal, posterior wall, and LV dimensions, LV mass, shortening fraction, peak shortening and lengthening velocities, diastolic filling time, peak E velocity, peak A velocity, and velocity time integrals. Despite group similarities in age, body size, and systolic blood pressure, greater fractional shortening (p = 0.0001), indexed peak shortening velocity (p less than 0.001), and greater LV mass index (p less than 0.05) were seen in the coarctation group in the face of lower LV wall stress (p = 0.0001). LV mass index correlated with the resting arm-leg gradient, which ranged from -4 to +10 mm Hg. The coarctation group had decreased early filling (p less than 0.006) with compensatory increased late diastolic filling (p less than 0.05). Diastolic filling abnormalities were prominent in the older coarctation subjects and were related to both systolic blood pressure (p less than 0.001) and LV mass index (p less than 0.01). Despite apparently successful repair of coarctation of the aorta, persistent alterations in both systolic and diastolic LV function and LV mass are present in children at long-term follow-up, which are related to the resting arm-leg gradient.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The postural change decreased early and atrial filling velocities in the normal individuals (61 +/- 10 to 49 +/- 7 cm/sec and 66 +/- 8 to 55 +/- 7 cm/sec, p less than 0.01, respectively), and also decreased early filling but increased atrial filling velocity in the eight patients (62 +/- 13 to 43 +/- 12 cm/sec and 56 +/- 11 to 65 +/- 14 cm/sec, p less than 0.01 and p less than 0.05, respectively). These changes were associated with a reduction in pulmonary artery wedge pressure in the normal subjects and in the patients (5 +/- 2 to 2 +/- 2 mm Hg and 12 +/- 4 to 8 +/- 3 mm Hg, p less than 0.01, respectively). These observations indicate that a preload reduction alters the left ventricular diastolic filling profile. The differences in Doppler alterations between the groups may be attributed to the fundamental differences in intrinsic left ventricular diastolic properties of normal subjects and patients with myocardial infarction.\r"

  ".U": "90296989\r", 
  ".W": "Numerous Doppler echocardiographic methods to measure stroke volume have been proposed in experimental or clinical studies, but their relative accuracy in patients compared with an invasive reference standard remains uncertain. Accordingly, we compared Doppler with thermodilution stroke volume measurement in 18 hospitalized patients, 16 with an acute manifestation of coronary artery disease and two with chronic cardiomyopathies. Doppler time-velocity integrals were measured by darkest line (modal velocity) and the leading edge (maximal velocity) techniques at the aortic annular plane, the mitral orifice, and the mitral annular plane. Two-dimensional echocardiography was used to measure cross-sectional areas (M-mode-corrected at the mitral orifice). The combination of aortic annular cross-sectional area and the leading edge technique of measuring the time-velocity integral of blood flow at this site provided the most accurate measure of stroke volume (r = 0.87, p less than 0.0001, standard error of estimate = 11 cm3; mean difference from thermodilution = 2.8 ml +/- 8.9 ml, p = NS). It also resulted in the most accurate measurement of cardiac output (r = 0.88, p less than 0.0003; mean difference from thermodilution = 0.11 L/min +/- 0.69 L/min, p = NS). Other methods yielded values that correlated less closely and deviated systematically from thermodilution measurements. We therefore conclude that of the six common methods evaluated, the aortic annular leading edge method measures stroke volume with the best accuracy and is most suitable for clinical application.\r"

  ".W": "In order to investigate whether coronary vasodilating prostaglandins (PGI2 and PGE2) have a role in the pathophysiology of myocardial ischemia, 26 patients with angina pectoris and 23 control subjects (nonischemic patients) were studied by assessing coronary hemodynamics and prostaglandin formation in relation to sympathetic stimulation. Following a cold pressor test (CPT), coronary prostaglandin output markedly increased (p less than 0.001) and coronary vascular resistance (CVR) decreased (p less than 0.001) in all control subjects. In contrast, in anginal patients prostaglandins in the coronary sinus were undetectable and after CPT prostaglandin output did not increase, whereas CVR paradoxically increased (p less than 0.001). In control subjects the inhibition of coronary prostaglandin formation (by ketoprofen [1 mg/kg intravenously] or by aspirin [15 mg/kg intravenously]) caused a paradoxical increase of CVR following CPT (p less than 0.001). In anginal patients the inhibition of prostaglandins further exaggerated the increase of CVR after CPT (p less than 0.001). These results indicate that coronary vasodilating prostaglandin PGI2 and PGE2 play a role in modulating coronary vascular response to sympathetic stimulation induced by CPT. Their defective production in anginal patients may be responsible for the paradoxical increase in CVR following sympathetic stimulation.\r"

LA and left ventricular (LV) volumes were measured with the biplane area-length method. LA maximal and minimal volumes were measured at mitral valve opening and closure, respectively. In addition, LA volume was measured at onset of atrial systole (beginning of the P wave on the electrocardiogram). LA volumes were larger in MS compared with NL; Maximal 122 +/- 65 cm3 versus 46 +/- 12 cm3, p less than 0.001; onset of atrial systole 108 +/- 63 cm3 versus 29 +/- 12 cm3, p less than 0.001; minimal 90 +/- 60 cm3 versus 18 +/- 7 cm3, p less than 0.001.

The definition of all components of these anomalies is difficult to accomplish with imaging techniques. This study compared the effectiveness of electrocardiographic (ECG) gated spin-echo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with cardiac angiography for the evaluation of all components of central cardiovascular anatomy in patients with the clinical diagnosis of single or common ventricle or complete atrioventricular (AV) septal (canal) defect. MRI studies and angiograms of 29 patients were evaluated independently. A sequential approach was used to define cardiac anatomy assessing nine anatomic features in each patient. MRI provided 261 observations and angiography provided 209 observations. In the mutual 209 observations, only 17 discrepancies were found. Comparison of MRI and angiography in individual cases showed that MRI was as effective as angiography in the depiction of ventricular anomalies, including determination of morphology and evaluation of the size of the ventricles, the orientation of the ventricular septum relative to the AV valves, as well as the origins and spatial relationships of the great arteries. MRI was more informative for the determination of thoracic and abdominal situs and systemic and pulmonary venoatrial connections, but was not as effective for the evaluation of semilunar valves. Thus MRI provides complete evaluation of central cardiovascular anatomy and is effective in the anatomic assessment of most components of complex ventricular anomalies.\r"

We have studied the hearts of four men who died from electrical accidents and directed particular attention to the coronary arteries, conduction system, and neural structures of the heart. In every heart there was widespread focal necrosis involving all the myocardium and including the specialized tissue of the sinus and atrioventricular nodes. In all four hearts there was contraction band necrosis of smooth muscle cells in the tunica media of the coronary arteries. Cells in the His bundle and bundle branches were less affected. Neural structures of the heart were minimally involved. We also sought any cardiac changes of a chronic nature that may have predisposed to a fatal arrhythmia. Two of the four hearts were slightly enlarged, and increased myocardial mass predisposes to ventricular fibrillation and makes it more difficult to revert. One heart exhibited focal fibromuscular dysplastic narrowing of small coronary arteries, including that artery supplying the coronary chemoreceptor. Another heart had fatty deposition extensively present within and around the sinus and atrioventricular nodes. Thus numerous abnormalities specifically attributable to the electrocution help explain the pathogenesis of the electrical instability known to occur. But in three of the four hearts there were also chronic abnormalities favoring electrical instability but predating the electrocution.\r"

  ".U": "90296994\r", 
  ".W": "The electrocardiographic QT interval, with a wide variety of practical and theoretic applications in medicine, pharmacology, and cardiology, is critically dependent on heart rate as expressed by cycle length (RR). To account for this and permit intraindividual and interindividual comparisons of changing QT intervals, a wide variety of formulas have been offered as single rate-correcting expressions over the range of heart rates. Yet as rate rises, the QT interval occupies more and more of the cycle length, until at the highest heart rates almost the entire cycle length is QT interval, and the QT-RR correlations become largely self-correlation. To elucidate this we investigated 150 consecutive patients divided into high, mid, and low rate terciles. For the entire group, and in each tercile, we determined the level of correlation between the QT interval and cycle length (RR interval). To remove the self-correlation, we repeated the calculations, correlating QT interval with RR interval minus QT interval. For the group, correlation (r) of QT with RR was 0.65. For the high, mid, and low rate terciles, correlation fell sharply, respectively: 0.58 to 0.36 to 0.25. When the self-correlation was removed by subtracting QT from cycle length (RR-QT), all correlations were even further sharply reduced for each tercile, respectively: 0.35, 0.16, and 0.03 (the latter being virtually no correlation). We conclude that at low heart rates, when it is not being correlated with itself, the correlation between QT and RR is low; at high heart rates the higher correlation is spurious because it is mainly self-correlation.\r"

We therefore performed 24-hour intra-arterial ambulatory blood pressure (BP) monitoring in 50 normal volunteers (cuff BP less than 140/90 mm Hg) whose ages ranged from 18 to 74 years. There were 30 men and 20 women in the study, but there was no significant difference between the sexes with respect to age, cuff BP, or body mass index. A diurnal variation in BP was observed, qualitatively similar to that seen in hypertensive individuals, including a prewaking BP rise. Mean daytime intra-arterial pressures differed little between the sexes (124/74 mm Hg for women and 127/76 mm Hg for men, p = NS), but was lower at night in women than in men (96/52 versus 102/59 mm Hg, respectively; p less than 0.02 for diastolic pressure). Based on this group of subjects, we defined the upper limit of normal daytime BP in both men and women as 150/90 mm Hg and the upper limit of mean nighttime BP as 130/80 mm Hg for men and 115/65 mm Hg for women. The lower nighttime pressures in women compared with their male counterparts with similar daytime pressures may explain why women appear to tolerate similar levels of BP better than men.\r"

Acebutolol decreased the 24-hour diastolic BP by 11 +/- 1 mm Hg (p less than 0.01) and systolic BP by 13 +/- 2 mm Hg (p less than 0.01). More specifically, a comparison of the two drugs during the final 6 hours (3 AM to 9 AM) of the dosing interval showed that the mean decrease in diastolic BP of 10.2 +/- 1.5 mm Hg with acebutolol was greater (p less than 0.05) than the decrease of 6.2 +/- 1.3 mm Hg with atenolol. Moreover, this final 6-hour effect of atenolol was less (p less than 0.01) than that observed during the first 18 hours of the day. The late effects of acebutolol did not change significantly from its early effects. The two agents also differed in their trough (final 2-hour decrease in diastolic BP) and peak (maximum 2-hour decrease in diastolic BP) effects: for atenolol the peak-to-trough difference was 7.8 +/- 3.1 mm Hg (p less than 0.05), whereas for acebutolol it was 3.8 +/- 4.2 mm Hg (N.S.).

Hemodynamic characteristics included elevated biventricular filling pressures and a pulmonary wedge pressure that was usually higher than the right atrial pressure. Equalization of biventricular filling pressures was seen, however, in almost all patients with severe tricuspid regurgitation (seven of eight). The square root sign was seen in 50% in RV diastolic pressure tracings and 28% in LV tracings. This sign was observed in patients with elevated filling pressures. Interstitial fibrosis (22 of 23), endocardial thickening (13 of 23), and myofibrillar hypertrophy (10 of 23) were common histologic findings. Severe myocardial fiber disarray consistent with HCM was seen in four patients.\r"

  ".W": "A safe and easily applied technique of percutaneous cardiopulmonary bypass support has been developed for use in the cardiac catheterization laboratory. The importance of this technique lies in its ability to maintain hemodynamic stability during high risk interventional procedures regardless of intrinsic cardiac function. Venous and arterial cannulas (18F) are inserted percutaneously over a stiff guide wire after sequential dilatation with 12F and 14F dilators. Bypass flow rates of up to 5 L/min can be achieved. This technique can be applied to support patients with cardiac arrest, hemodynamic collapse after abrupt closure during coronary angioplasty, and cardiogenic shock, as well as those undergoing high-risk elective coronary angioplasty. This form of support also permits transport of the patient to the operating room in a stable condition after an unsuccessful angioplasty. The complications are mostly related to cannula removal and can be minimized by the use of a proper technique. Although the ultimate role of this new technique remains to be completely defined, it appears that it will expand the patient population for whom coronary interventions can be applied.\r"

We analyzed the data from 35 rest/stress radionuclide ventriculography examinations in patients with documented ischemic coronary artery disease who had experienced 1 mm ST segment depression accompanied by angina during exercise testing. An index of ischemic cardiac pain perception (PPI) was calculated by subtracting the time of onset of 1 mm ST segment depression from the time of onset of angina. The mean value of PPI was -97 +/- 311 seconds. PPI was significantly correlated with age (r = 0.37, p = 0.03). This suggests that as age increases, perception of pain during myocardial ischemic episodes becomes muted. This relationship remained significant when we controlled for the presence of medication and severity of disease (change in ejection fraction from rest to peak exercise). These findings suggest that age is an independent risk factor for a decreased perception of ischemic cardiac pain, and thus for silent myocardial ischemia.\r"

To evaluate the differences between varying durations of ischemia and to attempt to identify metabolic indexes of salvaged viable tissue, intact New Zealand white rabbits underwent either 30 (group 1; n = 8) or 60 (group 2; n = 8) minutes of coronary occlusion followed by reperfusion. HEP metabolism was evaluated with cardiac gated phosphorus 31 (31P) nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy with a 2.0 T spectrometer. While similar HEP changes were observed during ischemia in both groups, differences in HEP recovery between groups were seen following reperfusion. Group 1 animals demonstrated a gradual decrease in inorganic phosphates (Pi) (p less than 0.05 versus group 2), an immediate recovery of phosphocreatine (PCr) (p = ns versus baseline), and a gradual increase of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to pre-ischemic levels. Group 2 animals had elevated levels of Pi (p less than 0.05 versus baseline; p less than 0.05 versus group 1), slow recovery of PCr, and continued reduction of ATP (p less than 0.05 versus baseline; p less than 0.05 versus group 1). Group 1 rabbits had a greater extent of viable myocardium than group 2 (77.1 +/- 9.7% of risk area versus 39.4 +/- 9.4%; p less than 0.001).

SBP recovery ratios were derived by dividing the values obtained 1 and 3 minutes after exercise by the peak value. The upper normal limit of the SBP ratio was defined by two standard deviations from the mean for 33 normal subjects. The specificity of this criterion for identifying patients with CAD was 97% and the sensitivity was 60%. None of the eight patients with hypertension showed an abnormal postexercise SBP response. At peak exercise the pulmonary artery wedge pressure was significantly greater in the patients with CAD having an abnormal response. In multiple regression analysis the exercise pulmonary artery wedge pressure, the exercise SBP, and the systemic vascular resistance after exercise were determining factors for an abnormal SBP response. Three-vessel disease was more common in patients with an abnormal response. Results of this study indicate that an abnormal postexercise SBP response appears to be determined by (1) the extent of exercise-induced impairment of left ventricular function and (2) peripheral vascular tone during recovery. This study also suggests that this criterion can increase the specificity of supine exercise testing in patients with CAD including those with hypertension and might provide a marker for the severity of impaired left ventricular function by exercise in CAD.\r"

The exercise ECG was abnormal in 69 patients (47%) including 28 who had ischemic responses. Cardiac events occurred in six patients, three with normal and three with abnormal exercise ECGs. Events occurred only in those patients (6 of 68) who exercised to work loads less than 6 METs or who achieved less than 85% of the age-predicted maximal heart rate. Three patients had coronary artery bypass grafting for angina from 10.5 to 22.5 months after echocardiography. A fourth patient had bypass grafting for mild single-vessel disease at the time of mitral valve replacement. Two patients had myocardial infarctions (0.85% per year) at 7.5 and 41 months after echocardiography. There were no deaths. Coronary revascularization is infrequently required in the 28 months after a normal exercise echocardiogram. A normal exercise echocardiogram in a patient with good exercise capacity was predictive of an excellent prognosis, even in those who had abnormal exercise ECGs. Myocardial infarction and death were rare events, even in patients with decreased exercise capacity.\r"

Thirty-two patients were examined by simultaneous recordings of the Doppler MF signal and the mean pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCm) as an approximation of left ventricular filling pressure. At rest PCm was correlated with the early/late velocity integral ratio (Ei/Ai: r = 0.62: p less than 0.0001; n = 32). In 25 of 32 patients the recordings during PTCA could be evaluated. At the end of the inflation (duration: 69 +/- 24 seconds) PCm increased from 11.2 +/- 5.5 to 17.2 +/- 7.2 mm Hg (p less than 0.001), and total MF integral as an index of systolic ventricular function decreased by 14.9 +/- 12.8% (p less than 0.001). Inasmuch as both early and late velocity integrals were reduced during PTCA, the Ei/Ai ratio did not change significantly (1.41 +/- 0.51 to 1.34 +/- 0.60; NS). In a subgroup of inflations without ECG signs of ischemia, Ei was decreased without a concomitant decrease in Ai, thus leading to a decrease in the Ei/Ai ratio (1.36 +/- 0.43 to 1.17 +/- 0.31; p less than 0.05). Summarizing the events during PTCA, a steady increase in PCm was observed, whereas the Ei/Ai ratio was slightly decreased. Thus the observation at rest that an elevated PCm was associated with an elevated Ei/Ai was no longer valid during PTCA (Ei/Ai: r = 0.28; NS). A significant correlation was found between parameters of Doppler MF and PCm in patients with ischemic heart disease at rest. During PTCA this relationship was attenuated. Therefore noninvasive assessment of left ventricular filling pressures during acute ischemia by Doppler echocardiography does not seem feasible.\r"

However, abnormal diastolic filling may be masked or mimicked because of the influence of aging, heart rate, and loading conditions. We evaluated age effects on left ventricular filling at rest in young (n = 5) and old (n = 6) purebred beagles that were free of occlusive coronary disease and left ventricular hypertrophy, and we also evaluated age-related differences in left ventricular filling velocities in response to dobutamine and phenylephrine. Pulsed Doppler echocardiography of left ventricular filling velocities was performed at baseline and then after the administration of dobutamine (10 to 20 micrograms/kg/min) infusion. Repeat baseline recordings were obtained and then phenylephrine was administered intravenously in doses of 5 to 25 micrograms/kg/min until systolic arterial pressure increased by at least 30 mm Hg above baseline. At baseline, Doppler echocardiography revealed that there were no significant differences in the early (E) velocity or velocity time interval (VTI), and atrial (A) velocity or the A/E velocity ratio between the young and old groups. However, the A VTI and the A/(A + E) VTI ratio were significantly increased in the old group. With dobutamine administration, the E velocity did not significantly increase from baseline in either group. The E VTI, A velocity and A VTI increased significantly in both groups, but the increases were not different between groups. With phenylephrine infusion there was a significant decrease in the E VTI in the old group but neither the A/E velocity or the A/(A + E) VTI ratio significantly changed from baseline.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The vasodilator effect of intravenous medroxalol was not apparent with the dosages used in this study. Transient changes noted in two Doppler diastolic velocity indexes--mitral early diastolic peak flow velocity (PFVE) and the ratio of mitral late-to-early diastolic peak flow velocity (PFVA/E)--are suggestive of an improvement in left ventricular (LV) diastolic filling during medroxalol infusion, possibly related to changes in loading conditions. Systolic and diastolic blood pressure did not correlate with any of the Doppler diastolic and systolic indexes in our patient population. Reduced aortic peak flow velocity, rate of aortic flow acceleration, and the rate of mitral early diastolic deceleration were noted with increasing LV mass index, independent of age or blood pressure. Doppler echocardiography may be a useful tool in the assessment and follow-up of LV systolic and diastolic function in patients undergoing pharmacologic interventions.\r"

To determine the incidence of diastolic dysfunction and to assess the relationship of such dysfunction to systolic performance, we measured systolic and diastolic function at rest in a series of healthy volunteers (n = 10) and in patients with cardiovascular disease (n = 42). Twenty patients had coronary artery disease (CAD) with prior myocardial infarction, six patients had CAD without myocardial infarction, and the remaining 16 patients had a variety of noncoronary heart diseases, including valvular heart disease, dilated cardiomyopathy, and hypertensive disease. The 42 patients manifested a wide variation in LV systolic function (ejection fractions ranged from 6% to 65%). Patients with reduced LV ejection fraction (EF) manifested a reduction in cardiac output and peak ejection rate proportionate to the reduction in EF. Diastolic function showed a fall in LV peak (PFR) and average (AFR) filling rates; these were reduced in proportion to the fall in EF. Heart rate was an insensitive index of the magnitude of impairment of LV systolic function. These data suggest that measurements of diastolic function do not provide additional information in patients with impaired systolic function.\r"

Fifteen asymptomatic volunteers were also examined to determine the specificity of the observations. Upon presentation, each patient received intravenous thrombolytic therapy, underwent immediate cardiac catheterization and had percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty performed when coronary reperfusion was absent. Twenty-four of the patients had documented coronary reperfusion at a mean interval of 259 +/- 129 minutes. Global ejection fraction and regional wall motion abnormalities were evaluated at 7 days by cine MRI, left ventriculography and radionuclide angiography. Twenty patients with both an absolute decrease in myocardial signal and a matched regional wall motion abnormality had AMI properly identified by cine MRI. In contrast, the finding of both decreased signal intensity and a matched regional wall motion abnormality was absent in the group of asymptomatic volunteers. The ejection fraction by cine MRI correlated better with the ejection fraction by left ventriculography (r = 0.94, standard error of the estimate = 3.6) than did the ejection fraction by radionuclide angiography (r = 0.82, standard error of the estimate = 5.8). The regional wall motion concordance rate in comparison to left ventriculography was similar for both cine MRI (69%) and radionuclide angiography (65%). These findings suggest that cine MRI may play an important role in the future detection and functional characterization of AMI.\r"

All patients in this series were continuously monitored in a coronary care unit to ensure observation of all VF within 18 days of AMI. From 1977 to 1985, 4,269 patients were admitted with AMI and 413 (9.6%) had in-hospital VF. Of these 281 (6.8%) had early VF (less than 48 hours after AMI) and 132 (3.2%) had late VF (greater than or equal to 48 hours after AMI). In-hospital mortality was 50 and 54% for early and late VF, respectively (p = 0.31). Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed better survival after discharge for patients with early versus late VF (p = 0.009) but this difference was fully explained by the presence of heart failure. Survival analysis showed the same prognosis after 1, 3 and 5 years for early and late VF, when VF was not associated with heart failure. When VF was associated with heart failure (secondary VF) early VF had a greater mortality than late VF after 2 and 5 years. Logistic regression analysis showed that heart failure (relative risk 1.9 [1.1 to 3.1]) and cardiogenic shock (relative risk 3.9 [1.8 to 8.5]) were significant risk factors for in-hospital death. Late VF compared to early VF had no prognostic implication (relative risk 1.0 [0.6 to 1.6]). For patients discharged from the hospital, risk factors were heart failure (1.8 [1.1 to 2.8]) and previous AMI (1.6 [1.3 to 2.1]).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "In 238 patients with acute myocardial infarction studied during intracoronary streptokinase therapy, the circumferential extent of left ventricular hypokinesis was measured by 5 methods and correlated with the location of the infarct-related coronary artery segment and with 1-year survival. Of the 5 methods, 1 focused only on the infarct region, and 4 varied in the complexity of the noise filter. Hypokinetic segment length measurements by all 5 methods correlated significantly with the location of occlusion along the left anterior descending coronary artery. No method yielded measurements that correlated with occlusion location along the right coronary artery. Measurements by all methods correlated significantly with survival, but the method that focused on the infarct region performed least well. Thus, the circumferential extent of hypokinesis in patients with acute myocardial infarction is greater for proximal than mid- or distal occlusions of the left anterior descending but not the right coronary artery. Survival is influenced by the function of periinfarct and noninfarct regions and by the function of the infarct region. Complex noise filters provide no advantage over simpler filters in measuring the extent of hypokinesis.\r"

No significant differences were detected between groups 2 and 3; therefore, they were combined for analysis. After streptokinase, patients required 37,755 +/- 1,516 (mean +/- standard error of the mean) U of heparin per day to achieve the desired activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT). The dosage was 30,294 +/- 1,089 U/day in patients without antecedent thrombolysis (p less than 0.001). Group 1 patients required 5 +/- 0.4 days until adequate anticoagulation was achieved, compared with 3 +/- 0.2 days in the control group (p = 0.01). Despite higher heparin requirements, group 1 patients had a lower APTT value than the other subjects (87 +/- 5 vs 101 +/- 6 seconds, p = 0.08). Group 1 patients required 5 +/- 0.3 days to reach anticoagulation with warfarin versus 4 +/- 0.2 days in groups 2 + 3 (p = 0.05). Comparison of groups 1 and 2 yielded similar, although smaller, differences. Patients treated with streptokinase for AMI seem to be partially resistant to anticoagulation, which may increase the risk of reocclusion.\r"

The atherectomy group consisted of 91 lesions in 83 consecutive patients who underwent either left anterior descending artery or right coronary artery atherectomy. The angioplasty group consisted of 91 lesions in 84 patients that were matched with the atherectomy lesions with respect to vessel and whether the lesion was a restenosis lesion. The mean preprocedure diameter stenosis was 76% in both groups as measured quantitatively with electronic calipers. After the procedure, the mean residual diameter stenosis of the atherectomy lesions was 13 +/- 17%, whereas for the angioplasty lesions it was 31 +/- 18% (p less than 0.001). Success rates in both groups were similar (94.5 and 93.4%, respectively). The incidence of postprocedure dissection was 11% in the atherectomy group and 37% in the angioplasty group (p less than 0.0001).

There was no significant difference between control SAECGs and SAECGs after exercise in patients with or without a positive exercise test.

However, it has recently been shown that healthy premature infants without respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) undergo spontaneous closure of the ductus arteriosus in the first 4 days of life at times comparable to full-term infants. Thus, ductal patency within this time frame would appear to be physiologic. Although sick premature infants are well recognized to be at risk for ductal shunting, the purpose of this investigation was to evaluate systematically the actual impact that RDS has on duration of ductal shunting by assessing the timing of spontaneous functional closure. The presence of ductal shunting was evaluated using echocardiographic color flow Doppler techniques. Thirty-six premature infants (30 to 37 weeks gestational age) were evaluated. By the fourth day of life, only 4 of 36 (11.1%) of the infants continued to have evidence of ductal patency. The remainder of the infants underwent spontaneous functional closure of the ductus arteriosus at times comparable to healthy infants without RDS. For most infants greater than or equal to 30 weeks gestation, uncomplicated RDS does not alter the usual timing of functional ductal closure.\r"

Fourteen normal children (mean age 4.8 years) were also studied. From the tricuspid valve inflow Doppler study, the following measurements were made at peak inspiration: peak velocities at rapid filling (peak E) and during atrial contraction (peak A), ratio of peak E to peak A velocities, RV peak filling rate normalized for stroke volume, total area under the Doppler curve, percent of the total Doppler area occurring in the first third of diastole (0.33 area fraction), percent of the total area occurring under the E wave (E area fraction), percent of the total area occurring under the A wave (A area fraction) and the ratio of E area to A area. Before balloon valvuloplasty, the patients with PS had higher peak A velocity (0.64 +/- 0.28 vs 0.39 +/- 0.08 m/s), lower E/A velocity ratio (1.11 +/- 0.52 vs 1.76 +/- 0.45), lower 0.33 area fraction (0.34 +/- 0.14 vs 0.49 +/- 0.08), higher A area fraction (0.45 +/- 0.21 vs 0.27 +/- 0.09) and lower E/A area ratio (1.73 +/- 1.05 vs 2.96 +/- 1.14) than the normal subjects (p less than 0.01). In patients before and after balloon valvuloplasty, there was a significant difference in RV outflow gradient (71 +/- 35 vs 28 +/- 15 mm Hg), but there was no change in any Doppler index.

In all 11 patients, transesophageal echocardiography presented the definite visualization of the defect and a clear laminar shunt flow that showed its 2 peaks in late systole and late diastole. We estimated the size of ASD and a shunt volume across the defect by using transesophageal echocardiography. The defect size determined by transesophageal echocardiography was correlated with the surgical measurement (horizontal width, r = 0.92, p less than 0.001; vertical length, r = 0.85, p less than 0.01). A significant high correlation was shown between the shunt volume measured by transesophageal echocardiography and that by Fick's method (r = 0.87, p less than 0.01). There was no significant correlation between the pulmonary to systemic flow volume (ratio) and the mean shunt flow velocity across ASD, although a high linear correlation was observed between the pulmonary to systemic flow ratio and the defect size in horizontal direction (r = 0.82, p less than 0.01). Transesophageal echocardiography used for diagnosis and quantitative evaluation of ASD could be performed easily and satisfactorily within 10 minutes. Thus, transesophageal echocardiography is a useful method in evaluation of the defect size and the shunt flow volume of ASD. The mean shunt flow velocity was not a reliable index for estimating the shunt flow volume. The defect size might be a valuable determinant of left-to-right shunt volume in ASD.\r"

Measurements included resting metabolic rate (RMR); maximum oxygen consumption (VO2max); plasma prolactin, cortisol, insulin, and T3; and body composition. Each subject completed a 3-d record of dietary intake, physical activity, and milk volume (by test weighing) and collected 24-h milk samples. Exercising women differed significantly from control subjects in VO2max (46.4 vs 30.3 mL.kg-1.min-1), percent body fat (21.7 vs 27.9%), total energy expenditure (3169 vs 2398 kcal/d), and energy intake (2739 vs 2051 kcal/d). There was no difference between the groups in plasma hormones or milk energy, lipid, protein, or lactose content. Exercising subjects tended to have higher milk volume (839 vs 776 g/d) and energy output in milk (538 vs 494 kcal/d). Thus, there was no apparent adverse effect of vigorous exercise on lactation performance.\r"

To study the effect of dietary fatty acid composition on adipocyte-membrane phospholipid composition and HDL binding, male Wistar rats (250 +/- 10 g) were fed diets high in polyunsaturated (20% wt:wt sunflowerseed oil) or saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids (20% lard, by weight). Sunflower-oil vs lard feeding significantly increased the polyunsaturated fatty acid content of membrane diacylglycerophospholipids and the (22:0 and 24:0) content of long-chain fatty acids of sphingomyelin (p less than 0.05) from epididymal and perirenal adipocyte plasma membranes. Concomitant with these changes in membrane phospholipid composition, sunflower-oil vs lard treatment significantly increased the maximum binding capacity (Bmax) of 125I-labeled HDL2 (p less than 0.05). These results show that feeding polyunsaturated fatty acids enhanced HDL2 Bmax of adipocyte plasma membranes, possibly as a consequence of altering the fatty acid composition of membrane phospholipids.\r"

This study describes simple methods based on dialysis and fermentation that enable a hierarchy of fibers to be described for each of the major actions of fiber along the gastro-intestinal tract: nutrient absorption, sterol metabolism, cecal fermentation, and fecal bulking. These results were compared with previous metabolic studies with the same fiber isolates in humans. DF that modifies nutrient absorption can be identified by using dialysis studies, whereas identifying DF that modifies sterol metabolism, cecal fermentation, and fecal weight requires formulas that incorporate dialysis and fermentation results. Results from dialysis and fermentation predicted the action of wheat bran, pectin, guar, gum arabic, carboxymethylcellulose, gellan, tragacanth, xanthan, and karaya in humans and generated anomalous results for karaya and tragacanth. These methods could form the basis of techniques that would enable a screening of novel and processed fibers before studies in animals, including humans.\r"

The 4.0-mg pyridoxine supplements significantly increased plasma total vitamin B-6, plasma pyridoxal phosphate (PLP), and milk total vitamin B-6, thus showing that maternal intake exerts a significant effect on vitamin B-6 concentration in milk. There was no effect of vitamin B-6 intake on plasma, erythrocyte, or milk zinc concentration. The 25-mg zinc supplement also had no effect on plasma, erythrocyte, or milk zinc concentration, suggesting that maternal zinc intake is not a major regulator of milk zinc concentration.\r"

Thus, a new milk product with a higher calcium content and lower contents of protein, phosphorus, and energy was developed. A controlled crossover study was done to determine the way in which substitution of the new milk product (860 mL) for normal milk (1000 mL) in the diet of healthy adults affected the urinary excretion of calcium and hydroxyproline. Short-term consumption of the product significantly lowered 24-h urinary calcium excretion by approximately 0.65 +/- 0.19 mmol/d (means +/- SEM, p less than 0.001). The ratio of fasting urinary hydroxyproline to creatinine did not decrease, indicating no significant reduction of bone resorption in our subjects. Elderly people in particular might benefit from the new product because it reduces their calcium loss as well as their intake of protein, phosphorus, energy, and liquid volume.\r"

This hypothesis was tested with pigs because their cardiovascular and gastrointestinal systems closely resemble those of humans. Weanling pigs were fed a diet containing either 59% sucrose or cornstarch with either deficient (0.8 mg/kg diet) or adequate (6.4 mg/kg) copper for 10 wk. Plasma and tissue copper, the activities of plasma ceruloplasmin ferroxidase and erythrocyte Cu,Zn-superoxide dismutase, hematocrits, and serum cholesterol and triglyceride were all decreased (p less than 0.05) and relative cardiac mass was increased (p less than 0.05) by severe dietary copper deficiency. The type of dietary CHO did not differentially influence the values of these variables. Thus, these data fail to support the hypothesis that the Cu X CHO interaction observed in rats represents a health risk for humans.\r"

Blood plasma was removed, stored for 11 mo, and later reinfused as a labeled tracer dose with the selenium label in all of the biologically significant chemical forms. Accessible tissues such as red blood cells were highly labeled (20-25%) in the subjects receiving selenomethionine. Selenium from deep body pools is excreted primarily via the urine (80%). Reexcretion of previously absorbed selenium back into the gastrointestinal tract can be measured, avoiding a major source of error in conventional balance studies used to estimate nutrient absorption.\r"
