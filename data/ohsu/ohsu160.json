This report reviews the current status of in vitro tests available in the evaluation of immunologic and/or allergic diseases. A discussion of the large number of tests available to measure IgE is followed by an overview of the status of complement assays and tests being developed for evaluation of immune complexes. Cellular assays involving polymorphonuclear cells (basophils, eosinophils) and lymphocytes have increased in use; their appropriate indication and current worth are evaluated, as well as the therapeutic monitoring of theophylline serum concentrations. In the view of the panel, the rapidly proliferating number of in vitro diagnostic tests has great potential for the enhancement of the practice of allergy, but also a potential for misuse. Appropriate use of these tests is the focus of this report.\r"

We have used a serum HIV antigen (HIV-Ag) enzyme immunoassay (EIA) to diagnose acute HIV infection in four high-risk patients. The clinical syndrome in these four patients was characterized by fever (four), rash (three), myalgias-arthralgias (three), and pharyngitis (two). All patients had spontaneous resolution of their symptoms within eight to 12 days. Serum HIV antibody, as measured by a commercially available screening EIA and by Western blot analysis, was negative in all patients at time of presentation and all seroconverted on subsequent testing. Human immunodeficiency virus was isolated from two of two patients during the acute illness. Initial serum samples from all four patients were positive for HIV-Ag. Serum samples of three of four patients became negative for HIV-Ag and positive for HIV antibody. These data suggest that serum HIV-Ag detection by EIA may be useful in the diagnosis of the acute syndrome caused by HIV infection.\r"

  ".W": "The immunofluorescent localization of cross-linked fibrin (XFb) in kidneys from 87 patients with renal diseases was evaluated using a monoclonal antibody that discriminates XFb from fibrinogen and its derivatives. Glomerular deposition of XFb, along the endothelial surface and in the mesangium, was frequently observed in patients with IgA nephropathy, Henoch-Schonlein purpura nephritis (HSPN), lupus nephritis, and hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS), which was confirmed by immunoelectron microscopy. Dual-label immunofluorescent studies showed that XFb was deposited in limited areas among the sites reactive with anti-fibrinogen antibodies; XFb was not present in the crescents, Bowman's capsule or interstitium. The localization of XFb was generally discordant with that of the platelet membrane antigen and von Willebrand factor (factor VIII-related) antigen. Subendothelial co-deposition of XFb and immunoglobulins (IgA with or without IgG) occasionally accompanying C3 was found in the glomeruli of some of the patients with IgA nephropathy and HSPN. The distribution of XFb observed by immunoelectron microscopy was similar to that of electron dense deposits. The glomerular population of monocytes/macrophages in patients with XFb deposition was similar to that of those without deposition. Urinary XFb derivatives were detected by the latex agglutination test in three of the 16 patients with glomerular XFb deposition, and in two of the 18 patients without it. These data indicate that the coagulation system is activated in the kidney of patients with IgA nephropathy, HSPN, lupus nephritis and HUS, and support the concept that glomerular fibrin deposition is associated with endothelial/subendothelial and mesangial injury. The activation of the coagulation system in IgA nephropathy and HSPN seems to be mediated by immune complexes rather than monocytes/macrophages. Determination of urinary XFb derivatives is not helpful for assessing glomerular XFb deposition.\r"

  ".W": "We compared the effects of dialysate composition on changes in intermediary metabolites, acid-base balance, and potassium removal during hemodialysis. Patients were dialyzed against dialysates containing acetate or bicarbonate, each with or without glucose, in a four-way cross-over study. Dialysates containing acetate were associated with significant perturbations in intermediary metabolism, including increases in blood citrate, acetoacetate and beta-hydroxybutyrate and a decrease in pyruvate. In contrast, bicarbonate-containing dialysates caused minimal perturbations in intermediary metabolism. Addition of glucose to the dialysate decreased the changes in intermediary metabolites; however, the magnitude of this effect was less than that observed for the change from acetate to bicarbonate. Use of acetate also resulted in lower post-dialysis blood-concentrations of base equivalents than obtained with bicarbonate; this difference was unaffected by the presence or absence of glucose. Although pre- and post-dialysis potassium concentrations were unaffected by the dialysate formulation, total potassium removal was significantly greater when glucose was omitted from the dialysate. Our results suggest that both bicarbonate and glucose should be included in the dialysate, particularly for those patients whose capacity for metabolism may be limited because of highly efficient dialysis, intercurrent illness, or starvation. However, addition of glucose to the dialysate may require a reduction in dialysate potassium to maintain proper potassium homeostasis.\r"

  ".W": "The mechanism of cyclosporine A (CyA) nephrotoxicity is unclear. In order to evaluate renal microcirculation seven euvolemic Munich-Wistar (MW) rats were studied after acute CyA treatment (50 mg/kg, i.v.). Both total glomerular filtration rate (GFR, 0.96 +/- 0.04 vs. 0.47 +/- 0.07 ml/min) and single nephron GFR (27.90 +/- 3.39 vs. 14.02 +/- 3.49 nl/min) declined significantly (P less than 0.001). It was observed an increase in afferent (RA, increases 188%) and efferent (RE, increases 360%) arteriolar resistances that caused a decrease on glomerular plasma flow rate (QA) from 100.99 +/- 17.09 to 44.37 +/- 13.37 nl/min (P less than 0.001). Mean glomerular capillary hydraulic pressure (PGC) increased from 45 +/- 1 to 55 +/- 4 mm Hg (P less than 0.05) and the glomerular ultrafiltration coefficient (Kf) decreased by 70% (0.096 +/- 0.030 to 0.031 +/- 0.010 nl/sec X mm Hg, P less than 0.05). Additionally, in order to study hormonal participation in this nephrotoxicity, other three groups of MW rats were previously treated with captopril (2 mg/kg, i.v.), verapamil (20 micrograms/kg/min, i.v.) or indomethacin (2 mg/kg, i.v.). Both captopril and verapamil minimized the renal effects of CyA, with a decline of approximately 25% instead of approximately 50% on GFR and RPF. Moreover, two groups of Brattleboro rats were studied. Acute CyA administration in homozygote Brattleboro rats produced a decline of only approximately 22% and approximately 31%, respectively, in GFR and renal plasma flow (RPF), when compared with MW rats (P less than 0.05). Similar results were observed in heterozygote Brattleboro rats when compared with MW rats, disclosing differences due to a different strain of rats.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

We therefore measured and characterized the procoagulant activity (PCA) which is present in normal kidneys and in kidneys of rabbits with the Shwartzman phenomenon induced by two injections of bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS; E. coli LPS 055:B5,25 micrograms/kg and 50 micrograms/kg administered 24 hrs apart with rabbits sacrificed 12 hrs after the second injection). PCA was measured in sonicated tissue by one-stage coagulation assay. In normal kidneys the amounts of PCA in the inner medulla, outer medulla and inner cortex were 18.2 +/- 3.2, 44.1 +/- 3.8 and 78.5 +/- 5.7 percent, respectively, of that in the outer cortex (N = 31).

  ".W": "It is well accepted that the molecular charge and conformation of serum proteins are major determinants of their glomerular filtration, but few studies characterizing the molecular features of circulating proteins in renal diseases are currently available. In 11 children affected by minimal change nephropathy (MCN) we determined the electrical charge and the fluorescence quantum yield of Tyrosine (Tyr) and Tryptophan (Trp) (taken as index of conformation) of serum and urinary albumin before and after steroid-induced remission of proteinuria. In all proteinuric children at the onset of the disease, urinary albumin was formed by one band with an isoelectric point (pI) of 4.7 (pI of the native protein), and by numerous other, less anionic bands with pIs between 4.8 and 5.5 accounting for about 50% of the total amount of this protein. The normalization of proteinuria which followed steroid therapy was characterized by the disappearance in urines of the less anionic fraction and by the appearance of numerous isoforms with a pI still more anionic (pI less than 4.7) than normal. At the same time, in the proteinuric phase, the fluorescence quantum yield of Trp of urinary albumin was markedly quenched, returning to near normal levels after steroid-induced remission of proteinuria. These data indicate that in MCN the charge-dependent renal selectivity properties are partially maintained and that the less anionic isoforms of albumin are a main component of urinary albumin. Together with the electrical charge, the conformation of albumin as a major determinant of its urinary excretion in MCN must also be considered.\r"

In virtually all of these the presence of nonosmotic ADH has been shown, but several details of this relationship remain controversial at this time. The role of specific receptor areas for ADH stimulation requires further study, particularly in the hyponatremia of a decreased effective arterial blood volume. In addition, it will be important to define the suspected vascular effects of nonosmotic ADH more specifically. Other areas of uncertainty include: the degree to which the tubular effect of ADH in hyponatremia may be modified by a decreased delivery of fluid to the loops of Henle; the potential stimulation of ADH by stress in clinical hyponatremia; and the meaning of very low or non-measurable concentrations of ADH in hyponatremia. New experimental tools such as vasopressin antagonists and agonists, measurements of baroreceptor input, and tests of proximal fluid reabsorption can be expected to clarify some of these questions in the near future.\r"

Compared to non-proteinuric children with nephrotic syndrome in remission, edematous children during relapse had lower serum concentrations of sodium and chloride with lower plasma osmolality, but had higher hematocrit values (P less than 0.05, each). Plasma concentration of AVP was higher in edematous children (P less than 0.01). Compared to healthy, normal children, edematous nephrotic children had higher plasma concentrations of AVP, aldosterone, renin, noradrenaline, and adrenaline (P less than 0.01, each), but had similar levels of plasma ANP. Head out water immersion and infusion of 5 ml/kg 20% human serum albumin solution, both procedures known to increase central blood volume, resulted in a reduction of elevated hormone concentrations to near-normal levels and caused a rise in sodium and water excretion. Following albumin infusion, mean ANP rose fivefold, and plasma concentrations of this hormone correlated positively with urine flow (r = 0.64, N = 18, P less than 0.01) and with sodium excretion (r = 0.62, N = 18, P less than 0.01). It is concluded that AVP, renin, aldosterone and catecholamines are stimulated in edematous children with nephrotic syndrome by reduction in effective circulatory blood volume. Central blood volume expansion induced either by water immersion or by infusion of concentrated albumin solution is able to correct elevated hormone levels and to induce salt and water excretion. Plasma ANP appears to trigger the diuretic and natriuretic effects of central volume expansion.\r"

We have found that both a Broviac catheter and pediatric dual-lumen Raaf catheter can be placed through separate venotomies in the external jugular vein, which provides sufficient routes of vascular access without complications. This technique places only one vessel at risk while minimizing the chance for infection by utilizing two exit sites. We consider this to be the procedure of choice in young patients requiring multiple routes of vascular access.\r"

The chemotherapy protocol was tolerated well without appreciable objective side effects. At a median follow-up period of 11.5 months, the disease-free survival time for the chemotherapy treated group is significantly longer than for the control group (P = 0.01). The estimated median disease-free survival time is 4 months in the surgical control group and 9 months in the chemotherapy group. At present, the proportion of patients remaining disease-free is 43% for the surgical control and 55% for the chemotherapy treated group.

In the group undergoing lung allotransplantation, the relationship among three histologic parameters was studied: the grade of lung allograft rejection, the degree of changes in the epithelium, and submucous lymphocyte infiltration along the donor bronchus within approximately a 0.5 cm area distal to the anastomosis. In lung autotransplantation, mucosal continuity began to be observed 1 week postoperatively. Mucosal continuity and apparent collagen formation on any bronchial contiguous site were demonstrated in most animals studied more than 3 weeks postoperatively. Bronchial anastomotic healing tended to be slower in lung allotransplantation than in autotransplantation, although a mucosal continuity at the anastomosis was sporadically observed in immunosuppressed dogs surviving more than 3 weeks postoperatively with a lung allograft. There were significant rank correlations among the three histologic parameters, which showed that lung allograft rejection is closely connected with wound healing of the bronchial anastomosis in lung allotransplantation. Meticulous mucosal approximation is most necessary during bronchial anastomotic procedures. Establishment of an exact method for early monitoring of lung allograft rejection is absolutely necessary for lung allotransplantation.\r"

Furthermore, the predictors of postoperative atrial fibrillation and the long-term consequence of atrial fibrillation that reverts to sinus rhythm have not been established. One hundred fifty patients were randomized to receive no drug, propranolol (20 mg every 6 hours), or digoxin (0.5 mg followed by 0.25 mg daily). Twenty-seven patients were excluded from data analysis. In the remaining 123 patients, no preoperative parameter (age, sex, diabetes, hypertension, smoking, electrocardiographic p wave morphology, or preoperative digoxin or propranolol therapy), intraoperative parameter (bypass time, aortic cross-clamp time, or number of vessels bypassed), or postoperative parameter (peak creatinine kinase, congestive heart failure, or pericarditis) by univariate or multivariate analysis predicted patients at risk for atrial fibrillation. Sustained atrial fibrillation developed in 37.5% of control and 32.6% of digoxin-treated patients. Only 16.2% of propranolol-treated patients had sustained atrial fibrillation (p less than 0.03). There were no in-hospital complications in those patients with atrial fibrillation. After 26 +/- 7 months follow-up, those patients with postoperative atrial fibrillation had no increased incidence of angina, cerebral vascular accident, myocardial infarction, or sudden death. Therefore, in this select population, propranolol prophylaxis is effective but discretionary.\r"

  ".U": "87313565\r", 
  ".W": "For patients with heparin-induced platelet activation, reexposure to heparin can result in profound thrombocytopenia, intravascular thrombosis, and hemorrhage. We compared the ability of aspirin to that of iloprost (ZK36374), an analogue of prostacyclin, in preventing heparin-induced platelet activation and thus permitting a cardiac operation in a patient with heparin-induced platelet activation. Despite abolishing thromboxane A2 synthesis, aspirin (4 mmol/L) failed to prevent either in vitro heparin-induced platelet aggregation (65.0% without versus 59% with aspirin) or carbon 14-serotonin release (81.8% without versus 59.7% with aspirin). In contrast, iloprost (0.01 mumol/L) prevented both in vitro heparin-induced platelet aggregation (65% without versus 5.0% with iloprost) and release (81.8% without versus 0% with iloprost). Consequently, a continuous infusion of iloprost was begun before administration of heparin, continued throughout cardiopulmonary bypass, and discontinued 15 minutes after administration of protamine. The whole blood platelet count (209,000/microliter) remained stable after intraoperative administration of heparin (238,000/microliter) and was 115,000/microliter after the operation. No spontaneous platelet aggregates were observed in samples of platelet-rich plasma after heparin administration, and no platelet transfusions were required. Plasma levels of platelet factor 4 rose from 27 to 725 ng/ml after heparin administration but then declined during bypass to 50 ng/ml. Beta thromboglobulin levels only rose from 92 to 496 ng/ml with administration of heparin. Fibrinopeptide A levels fell from 72 to 22 ng/ml after heparin and remained stable throughout bypass. The template bleeding time was 7.5 minutes preoperatively and 8.0 minutes postoperatively. The postoperative chest tube drainage (12 hours) was 475 ml, and platelets responded normally to adenosine diphosphate. In conclusion, iloprost but not aspirin completely prevented heparin-induced platelet activation in vitro. Furthermore, iloprost effectively prevented this syndrome clinically, which permitted a safe cardiac operation in this patient with heparin-induced platelet activation.\r"

In order to determine the feasibility and utility of regular exercise after renal transplantation, the responses of 10 patients to graded exercise testing were compared before training (T1), immediately after a program of supervised exercise training (T2), and a mean of 2.2 years after completion of the supervised program (T3). Supervised exercise sessions began a mean of 17 days postoperatively and continued for a mean of 5.5 weeks. Patients were encouraged to continue regular unsupervised exercise thereafter. All patients easily tolerated the supervised exercise sessions, which consisted of treadmill walking and cycle ergometry. Exercise capacity improved 90% between T1 and T2 and an additional 12% between T2 and T3. On the average, patients achieved a normal exercise capacity by 8 weeks after transplantation. Of the 10 patients, 7 had continued regular exercise training at T3. The observed increase in aerobic exercise capacity was probably related to improved renal function, an increased hemoglobin concentration, and the surgical healing process as well as the exercise training. We conclude that supervised exercise training for selected patients after renal transplantation is feasible and worthwhile.\r"

These medications generally have bactericidal activity, excellent distribution throughout the body, low toxicity, and efficacy against infections due to susceptible organisms. The clinical introduction of aqueous penicillin G for treatment of streptococcal and staphylococcal infections was an important pharmacologic landmark. The emergence of penicillinase-producing staphylococci prompted the development of the penicillinase-resistant penicillins (methicillin, oxacillin, nafcillin, and others), in which the acyl side chain prevented disruption of the beta-lactamase ring. The aminopenicillins (ampicillin, amoxicillin, and others) were later developed because of the need for gram-negative antimicrobial activity. Their spectrum included Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Shigella, Salmonella, Listeria, and Haemophilus. The search for a penicillin with even further antimicrobial activity against the Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa led to the development of the carboxypenicillins, ureidopenicillins, and piperazine penicillins. Recently, the combination of a beta-lactamase inhibitor (clavulanic acid or sulbactam) and an amino-penicillin or ticarcillin has resulted in further extension of their antibacterial spectra. The development of an ideal penicillin that is nonsensitizing, bioavailable, beta-lactamase-resistant, rapidly bactericidal, nontoxic, and inexpensive and that has high affinity to penicillin-binding proteins and no inoculum effect remains the goal.\r"

The first-generation cephalosporins, and especially cefazolin, are most active against sensitive staphylococci and streptococci. Most second-generation (except cefoxitin) and third-generation cephalosporins show substantial activity against Haemophilus influenzae. All cephalosporins (except cefsulodin) are active against Klebsiella, Escherichia coli, and Proteus mirabilis, whereas only the third-generation agents have pronounced activity against the other Enterobacteriaceae. Imipenem (a carbapenem) is active against essentially all pathogenic organisms, but aztreonam (a monobactam) is active against only aerobic gram-negative bacilli. Advantages associated with some of the new cephalosporins are once-daily administration and high cerebrospinal fluid levels. With the development of new cephalosporins, however, new toxicities have become apparent, and superinfections and induction of resistance have become greater problems. The cephalosporins are among the most expensive antibiotics in use today; thus, use of these expensive agents must be justified by lower toxicity, greater efficacy, or both in comparison with drugs of more reasonable cost.\r"

  ".U": "87313818\r", 
  ".W": "Definitions of hypertension have historically been based on at least one of three concepts. The first approach identifies thresholds of hypertension based on the frequency of occurrence in the population. The statistical approach designates a point in the distribution (e.g., the 95th percentile), as the threshold for hypertension. This distribution method identifies different limits for hypertension depending on the age, sex, and race, of the population, all of which affect the average pressure. Although distribution curves do not by themselves identify thresholds for intervention, they are useful for examining changes in population groups over time. The second approach to defining hypertension relates pressures to the risk of morbidity and mortality and is characterized by a continuously graded curve with no clear categorical thresholds. Studies correlating both diastolic and systolic pressures with cardiovascular complications demonstrate continuous risks from lowest to highest values for both sexes, all ages, and both blacks and whites in the United States. The blood pressure-risk relationship provides a compelling rationale for treatment but does not by itself define thresholds for the initiation of therapy. The third approach uses data from clinical intervention trials to identify thresholds where the benefits of therapy outweigh the costs and side effects of long-term treatment. Although results of large randomized trials have clearly demonstrated reductions in morbidity and mortality by lowering blood pressures, consensus on the lowest threshold within the mild range for which antihypertensive drug treatment is recommended has not been reached. Because an optimal definition of hypertension must encompass all three approaches and the resultant classification scheme must be sufficient for all purposes, attempts to refine and improve upon the presently recommended thresholds will undoubtedly continue.\r"

Of equal importance is the effect of hypertension on the development of atherosclerosis. Specific changes in both the microvasculature and macrovasculature vary depending on the degree and rapidity of blood pressure elevation. Changes in the intima and media can lead to significant narrowing of vessels and ischemia in various tissues. In addition, changes in small-resistance vessels contribute to changes in peripheral-vasculature resistance and thus affect blood pressure regulation. Treatment of moderate to severe elevation in blood pressure clearly results in a decrease in the incidence of stroke. However, evidence that treating mild hypertension reduces coronary events is less convincing. Antihypertensive therapy may result in partial regression of vascular changes, especially fibrinoid necrosis seen in malignant hypertension, but more work needs to be done to clearly define the roles of specific drugs in preventing or regressing hypertensive vascular disease.\r"

  ".W": "This article has reviewed the involvement of the kidney as a target organ of essential hypertension. Since Bright first made the association of renal disease and hypertension in 1836, the nature of this relationship has been debated. Although there is evidence implicating abnormalities of renal function in the pathogenesis of essential hypertension, hypertension frequently precedes histologic evidence of alterations in renal structure. Nephrosclerosis, or hardening of the kidney, is the term used to describe the histologic changes occurring in the kidney as the result of hypertension. It can be though of as an acceleration of the normal aging process of the renal vasculature. Glomerular and tubular changes have been traditionally thought to be ischemic in origin. Experimental evidence supports the notion that, as renal function is lost, intraglomerular hypertension develops and may be responsible for additional nephron loss in hypertension. This idea may have therapeutic implications for hypertensive patients with renal insufficiency in that agents that reduce both systemic and intraglomerular pressure may be preferable. Hemodynamically, early hypertension is often characterized by normal peripheral and renal vascular resistance and an increased cardiac output. In established hypertension, cardiac output is usually normal, and peripheral and renal vascular resistances are increased. Renal blood flow is reduced, glomerular filtration rate is maintained, and the filtration fraction rises. In the absence of an accelerated malignant phase, renal failure is uncommon in essential hypertension. Males and blacks are most sensitive to the vascular damage of essential hypertension. Essential hypertension remains an important cause of end-stage renal disease, especially in blacks. Atherosclerotic obstruction of the renal arteries may be a more common cause of renal failure in patients with essential hypertension than has been previously recognized. There are few sensitive markers of early renal involvement in essential hypertension. Several studies of sensitive markers are promising and may detect patients who are prone to renal injury and deserve more aggressive treatment. Malignant hypertension is characterized pathologically by vascular changes of proliferative endarteritis and fibrinoid necrosis. Fortunately, its frequency is decreasing because of early identification and effective treatment of essential hypertension. Effective treatment of severe and malignant hypertension clearly leads to stabilization (and occasionally improvement) of renal function.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

Patients in whom such mechanisms are likely to be operative are young people with mild or labile hypertension. These mechanisms are expressed clinically through orthostatic hypertension, rapid heart rate, modestly elevated cardiac output, and normal or slightly elevated peripheral vascular resistance. The vascular resistance is inappropriately high for the level of cardiac output, and this is reflected in a mildly elevated blood pressure. This evidence carries therapeutic implications and suggests that sympatholytic drugs should be the first line of therapy. An additional pressor mechanism may arise from increased sympathetic activity along renal efferent nerves that impairs sodium excretion and another possible mechanism is stimulation of brain centers through impulses from the kidneys carried in renal afferent nerves.\r"

  ".W": "Thiazide diuretics have been in use for over 30 years in the treatment of hypertension. Their action results in a reduction in peripheral resistance without a significant decrease in cardiac output or a major shift in plasma volume. They are as or more effective than any of the other antihypertensive agents when used as monotherapy and can serve as baseline therapy in combination with any of the available adrenergic, converting enzyme-inhibiting agents, or calcium-entry blockers. There is a high degree of patient acceptance; titration to an effective dosage is relatively easy; and cost, relatively low. Although certain undesirable metabolic changes may occur following the use of these agents, most of them are controllable, and there is no evidence to date that they offset the benefits achieved by blood pressure lowering. Asymptomatic elevated uric acids have not been shown to be of great significance. If gout occurs, it can be managed. Alterations in glucose metabolism may occur, and in some patients, it appears that blood glucose levels are elevated over time. This is not a desirable metabolic change, but is one of doubtful prognostic significance. Changes in lipids are generally short-term, and in the major clinical trials, lipid levels have not remained elevated with a continuation of diuretic therapy. Although diuretics produce hypokalemia in a fairly high percentage of patients, this is not generally severe (less than 3.3 mEq per liter) and usually does not produce symptoms. There is no firm evidence that the hypokalemia produced by diuretics predisposes the patient to severe arrhythmias or sudden death, although this point has been emphasized repeatedly in recent publications. Diuretics can usually be given without potassium-maintenance therapy. However, hypokalemia should be prevented in the elderly, in patients with ischemic heart disease, left ventricular hypertrophy and those on digitalis, or with diabetes. We prefer potassium-sparing agents along with a diuretic over supplements to prevent hypokalemia; the number of pills is kept at a reasonable level, and cost is minimized. Physicians should continue to prescribe diuretics as first-step therapy in the majority of patients to maximize therapeutic outcome.\r"

LVH is more closely related to blood pressure recorded in the patient's natural setting during normal activity or exercise--whether measured by portable recorder or home manometer--than to blood pressure measured by the physician. A subgroup of patients with mild essential hypertension exhibit high cardiac output and evidence of supernormal myocardial contractility in the absence of LVH; whereas amongst patients with more sustained hypertension, LVH may be either concentric (associated with high ejection fractions) or eccentric (associated with abnormal responses to exercise). Recent data indicate that echocardiographic detection of LVH identifies mildly hypertensive patients at significant risk, a finding that may aid identification of patients for drug treatment.\r"

ACE inhibitors are uniquely advantageous because of their favorable hemodynamic effects, the lack of adverse metabolic effects, and their ability to prevent or blunt undesirable effects of diuretic therapy. Their safety in large numbers of hypertensives has been consistently demonstrated. The minor nature of most side effects and the rarity of life-threatening side effects of ACE inhibitors is reassuring. Clinical experience has provided information about patients likely to be at high risk for side effects with ACE inhibitors enabling avoidance of the drugs, or the use of small doses and careful scrutiny in such individuals. The development of this new class of drugs permits safe and effective blood pressure control with potential enhancement of the sense of well being and quality of life to a degree never before encountered.\r"

  ".W": "Obesity and hypertension are two major risk factors for the cardiovascular system. Whereas arterial hypertension increases afterload to the left ventricle, obesity produces an increase in stroke volume and increases preload. As a result of this double burden, the heart adapts with eccentric left ventricular hypertrophy. Contractility becomes impaired early in the course of obesity hypertension, and ventricular ectopy is observed. As a consequence, the obese hypertensive patient is at a high risk for congestive heart failure and sudden death. Despite the synergistic effects of obesity and hypertension on the heart, patients appear to be relatively protected from nephrosclerosis and coronary artery disease. These epidemiologic observations are supported by the pathophysiologic changes that take place in obesity hypertension. At any given level of arterial pressure, cardiac output and renal blood flow are elevated in obese hypertensive patients, whereas systemic and renal vascular resistance are decreased when compared to lean hypertensive patients. Because total peripheral resistance is considered the hemodynamic hallmark of arterial hypertension, systemic vascular complications may be less pronounced in obesity hypertension. Weight loss decreases preload, afterload to the left ventricle, and the sympathetic drive to the heart. Protecting the heart from these hypertrophic stimuli should be a major goal of preventive cardiology.\r"

Group 2 was subdivided into 2A, placental failure with manifest perinatal distress (19), and 2B, placental failure without perinatal distress (11). All 19 compromised and distressed fetuses (group 2A) had extremely pathological Doppler findings, even several weeks before fetal distress became apparent by cardiotocography. The Doppler findings in the 11 small-for-dates fetuses without perinatal distress (group 2B) were inconsistently normal or slightly pathological. All 16 normal infants (group 1) had normal antenatal Doppler data. The Doppler technique thus allows accurate and early recognition of those fetuses who will become distressed perinatally.

Hyperinsulinaemia could contribute to hypertension by stimulating the activity of the sympathetic nervous system and kidney sodium and volume reabsorption. Glucose intolerance and hyperinsulinaemia have been identified as risk factors for coronary artery disease, and their presence may help explain why the frequency of this disease has not been reduced by treatment of hypertension. The fact that several antihypertensive drugs deleteriously affect glucose, insulin, and lipid metabolism makes it even more important to consider these factors in the treatment of high blood pressure.\r"

  ".W": "Diseases with disappearing intrahepatic bile ducts may be developmental, immunological, infective, vascular, or chemical in origin. The immunological group includes primary biliary cirrhosis, graft-versus-host disease, and sarcoidosis. HLA class 2 antigens are displayed on the bileducts and recognition of biliary antigens by cytotoxic T-cells leads to destruction of interlobular ducts. Primary sclerosing cholangitis is associated with immunological features, but the hepatic histology is not that of immunological duct disease. The association with immunodeficiency syndromes, and the finding that secondary sclerosing cholangitis may occur in patients with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome who are infected with cytomegalovirus, suggest that primary sclerosing cholangitis might be infective in origin. In bacterial cholangitis there is contiguity between the biliary system and the intestinal tract and usually, but not necessarily, partial biliary obstruction. Interference with the hepatic arterial supply to the bileducts leads to vascular cholangitis. Chemical cholangitis follows injection of scolicidal agents into the biliary tree. Diseases with disappearing bileducts have a long natural history and hepatocellular failure occurs late. In the late stages hepatic transplantation gives good results.\r"

Analysis of the tumour cell surface molecules indicated that expression of the lymphocyte-function-associated antigen, LFA-1, was lacking, whereas normal leucocytes from these patients expressed normal levels of LFA-1. Examination of other lymphoid tumours revealed that most high grade lymphomas, but not most low or intermediate grade lymphomas, do not express the LFA-1 molecule. Furthermore, in an initial survey, the tumours from 5 of 7 patients with non-relapsing large cell lymphomas expressed LFA-1 whereas only 3 of 18 patients with relapsing lymphomas had tumours that did so. These findings suggest that tumour cells lacking surface LFA-1 cannot initiate an effective immune response in vivo. This lack of immunogenicity might contribute to escape from immunosurveillance.\r"

GnRH was administered subcutaneously in a pulsatile fashion at 90 min intervals, and the dose was increased as required to maintain progression of puberty, initially only at night and subsequently over 24 h. Initial GnRH dose was 1-2 micrograms per pulse in the girls and 2-4 micrograms per pulse in the boys. The effect of treatment was monitored by serial overnight gonadotropin profiles in all patients and with pelvic ultrasound in the girls. The clinical features, growth acceleration, endocrinology, and ovarian ultrasound morphology of puberty were those seen in normal children. Measurement of spontaneous gonadotropin pulsatility after treatment had been discontinued allowed the distinction between 20 patients with hypogonadotropic hypogonadism and 12 who had constitutional delay of growth and puberty. 2 girls and 6 boys did not respond to the treatment regimen. These findings indicate that normal puberty is GnRH dependent.\r"

  ".W": "The value of regular cerebral ultrasound scanning in predicting cerebral palsy (CP) was assessed in very low birthweight infants. The infants were scanned before discharge, and their vision and hearing were assessed at age 9 months and neurodevelopment was assessed at 18 months. Ultrasound abnormalities, defined before the study, were periventricular haemorrhage (PVH), \"prolonged flare\" (echodensity persisting in the periventricular white-matter for more than 2 weeks without cavitating), and cystic periventricular leukomalacia (PVL). The incidence of these three conditions in surviving infants was 49%, 15%, and 8%, respectively. 158 infants survived to be discharged from hospital and 156 had neurodevelopmental assessment at 18 months of corrected age. All infants with PVH alone and confined to the lateral ventricles were normal at follow-up. The presence of cysts accurately predicted abnormal outcome (94%) and was highly specific (96%). Prolonged flare predicted adverse outcome but the accuracy (79%) was less good than for cystic PVL. 12 infants had CP, and 10 of these had ultrasound evidence of PVL. 8 of the 13 infants with cysts had spastic CP. 4 of these were walking independently and had mild CP. No infant with ultrasound evidence of a single cyst or with cysts confined to the frontal region or centrum semiovale had severe CP. Cysts involving the periventricular white-matter in the occipital region were associated with a poor prognosis. Echolucent cystic lesions detected by ultrasound in the neonatal period accurately predict adverse outcome, and if multiple and present in the occipital region, confer a very high risk of severe CP.\r"

Although all treatments were equally effective at lowering blood pressure, pain-free and maximum walking distances on a treadmill were decreased by atenolol, labetalol, and pindolol, but not by captopril. Post-exercise calf blood flow availability was impaired by atenolol, labetalol, and pindolol, but not by captopril. Despite ancillary characteristics of cardioselectivity, intrinsic sympathomimetic activity, or combination with alpha-blockade, beta-blockers seem to impair the lower limb circulation in such patients, whereas captopril seems to preserve it, possibly by maintaining the collateral blood supply.\r"

No adverse reactions to inactivated vaccines have been noted, but complications with live vaccines have been recorded with both BCG and smallpox. Limited experience with live poliomyelitis and measles vaccines in HIV-infected children has not yet shown any severe complications from these vaccines. Theoretical concerns that immunisation might accelerate the course of HIV infection are not supported by available data. Serological response to most inactivated and live vaccines is reduced in HIV-infected persons, and is related to the degree of immunosuppression present. Preliminary evidence suggests that the severity of some vaccine-preventable diseases is increased in HIV-infected children. This review finds general support for recommendations on immunisation of HIV-infected children that have been developed by the World Health Organisation.\r"

The nine patients presented here with 3-year follow-up accidentally drank a concentrated alkaline solution. All were teenagers or young adults who drank from the same bottle while at a party. The problems encountered in these patients led us to conclude that all patients with moderate to severe corrosive injury of the esophagus should have assessment of the entire esophagus and stomach at the time of initial assessment. Six patients underwent diagnostic laparotomy and one underwent thoracotomy as well for assessment of his esophageal injuries. Had we followed the traditional approach of esophagoscopy only to the level of the first circumferential burn, more severe and potentially life-threatening injuries would have been missed. Early endoscopic evaluation of the esophagus and stomach remains the standard for diagnosis; however, complete assessment may require laparotomy or thoracotomy. Early resection of necrotic tissue in the esophagus or stomach can lead to increased survival.\r"

Histologic and biochemical examination and tensile strength determinations suggest that laser welding may be an alternative to sutures for repair of large-diameter venotomies, arteriotomies, and arteriovenous fistulas, as healing is comparable to that seen with suture repairs up to 4 weeks postoperatively.\r"

  ".W": "Electrosurgical devices have been used widely in thoracic surgery to assist in dissection and to reduce hemorrhage. Recent experimental data have shown that lasers may be used to resect and control small air leaks while conserving normally functioning lung. This investigation quantitates the amount of damage produced by the electrosurgical unit (ESU), the carbon dioxide laser (CO2), and the neodymium: YAG laser (YAG) compared to standard suture (SU) techniques. Six dogs were anesthetized, intubated, and ventilated. The left chest was opened and the lower lobe exposed, where four sets of lesions were created using each device. All lesions were visually similar to those lesions that would be created for sealing at the time of a pulmonary resection. The lesions were harvested immediately following wounding as well as at 1, 3, and 6 week intervals. They were examined histologically and ranked from least to most damage produced at each interval. A grading system (0-4+) was also devised to compare the injury to simultaneously harvested normal lung. Immediately following injury, histologic ranking was: CO2 (2+), suture (2+), ESU (3+), YAG (4+). By 6 weeks, the suture damage had become minimal and the ranking was: suture (1+), CO2 (2+), YAG (4+), ESU (4+). The ESU consistently produced more extensive damage than any other device. It appears that the most suitable long-term adjunctive devices to assist in pulmonary surgery are suture and the CO2 laser. The YAG laser may have specific indications in circumstances when significant blood loss may be encountered. ESU usage should be minimized when attempting to preserve functioning lung tissue.\r"

  ".W": "In a retrospective review of 116 consecutive allogeneic bone marrow transplants (BMT), severe obstructive airways disease was identified in 11 patients. Lung pathology demonstrated bronchiolitis in 9 patients and physiologic studies showed small-airways disease consistent with bronchiolitis in the other 2. None of the 5 patients with associated infection survived, while 3 of the 6 patients without an identified pathogen stabilized or improved. Analysis of the 11 cases presented and all 25 cases reported in the literature (1982 to 1985) supports the conclusion that graft-versus-host disease is a major risk factor for bronchiolitis in BMT recipients. Among the proposed mechanisms for the development of bronchiolitis after allogeneic BMT, the 2 most likely are graft-versus-host disease directly causing bronchiolitis, and increased immunosuppressive therapy given for graft-versus-host disease predisposing to viral bronchiolitis. The available evidence would suggest that it is prudent to obtain serial pulmonary function tests even in asymptomatic patients post-BMT, and particularly in those with chronic graft-versus-host disease, in the hope that early detection will allow for early intervention that will arrest or reverse the progression of the obstructive airways disease.\r"

  ".U": "87314411\r", 
  ".W": "While salmonellosis is often considered to affect primarily the gastrointestinal tract, infection at other sites may occur, producing characteristic clinical syndromes. We reviewed cases from our institutions and the literature on focal manifestations of salmonella infections. In the past, most extra-intestinal salmonella infections were caused by S. choleraesuis; however, we found S. typhimurium to be the predominant serotype. The mortality rate for patients in our series was considerably lower than the rate described for focal infections in other reviews. This may in part be due to lower proportion of infections due to S. choleraesuis, improved microbiologic and diagnostic techniques, increased use of ampicillin, and improved surgical techniques. Salmonella endocarditis usually occurs in patients with preexisting heart disease. Unlike other salmonella infections, S. choleraesuis is the most frequent serotype. Salmonella endocarditis is often very destructive, with a fatality rate of 70%. Nonvalvular (mural) endocarditis occurs in one-fourth of patients and survival has not been reported. While antibiotic therapy should be tried initially, if response is not prompt the clinician should look for an associated site of infection (intra- or extra-cardiac abscess), which will often require surgery. Salmonella pericarditis often presents with cardiac or pulmonary symptoms, but typical signs of pericardial disease (pulsus paradoxus, friction rub) or characteristic electrocardiographic changes (low voltage, elevated ST segments) are uncommon. Early diagnosis, before infection involves other areas of the heart, is crucial for survival. In addition to antibiotic therapy, pericardiocentesis or pericardiectomy is required. Salmonella may infect the peripheral or visceral arteries, but the abdominal aorta is the most frequent site of vascular infection. Most patients are men over age 50 with preexisting atherosclerosis of the aorta who do not have a previous history of gastroenteritis. About one-fourth of patients have associated lumbar osteomyelitis. No patients have been reported to survive with medical therapy alone. Specific guidelines for surgical removal of infected aneurysms have been proposed and these (in addition to increased use of ampicillin) may be responsible for higher survival rates in recent years. Due to the high incidence of relapses, postoperative blood cultures should be done routinely. Arterial infection should be considered in any elderly patient with salmonella bacteremia especially with prolonged fever or bacteremia after an \"adequate course\" of antibiotic therapy.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

Two histopathologic types of vasculitis have been detected. One type, a leukocytoclastic angiitis, is found in association with high-titer anti-Ro(SS-A) antibodies, rheumatoid factor, hypergammaglobulinemia, and hypocomplementemia. The second type, a mononuclear inflammatory vasculopathy, in sharp contrast, is found in association with low-titer Ro(SS-A) antibodies, normocomplementemia, and absence of hypergammaglobulinemia and rheumatoid factor. Both types of vasculitis are found in association with peripheral nervous system and CNS disease. The peripheral nervous system and CNS disease involves the entire neuroaxis and preliminary data indicate that a vasculopathy is the cause of the peripheral nervous system and CNS disease. Evoked sensory response testing, CSF analysis, and MRI have proved to be very valuable techniques in investigating these patients with Sjogren's syndrome. Preliminary data suggest that high doses of prednisone or immunosuppressive agents are effective in treating these patients.\r"

Recent studies of the motor units in chronic denervating conditions including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) are reviewed. These indicate that reinnervation is a relatively active process which compensates for the progressive loss of motoneurons in ALS until more than 50% of the motoneurons have died. There seems to be no predilection for death of motoneurons of any particular size in ALS. Fasciculations may arise both proximally and distally. The dying-back change is not a major feature of ALS. These and other data cast doubt on the etiological theories that ALS arises from premature aging of motoneurons, deficiency of motoneuron trophic factors, or an inhibitor of a motoneuronal sprouting factor, and point to the need to study metabolic changes intrinsic to the motoneuron in ALS.\r"

Our study was designed as a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of high-dose methylprednisolone sodium succinate for severe sepsis and septic shock. Diagnosis was based on the clinical suspicion of infection plus the presence of fever or hypothermia (rectal temperature greater than 38.3 degrees C [101 degrees F] or less than 35.6 degrees C [96 degrees F]), tachypnea (greater than 20 breaths per minute), tachycardia (greater than 90 beats per minute), and the presence of one of the following indications of organ dysfunction: a change in mental status, hypoxemia, elevated lactate levels, or oliguria. Three hundred eighty-two patients were enrolled. Treatment--either methylprednisolone sodium succinate (30 mg per kilogram of body weight) or placebo--was given in four infusions, starting within two hours of diagnosis. No significant differences were found in the prevention of shock, the reversal of shock, or overall mortality. In the subgroup of patients with elevated serum creatinine levels (greater than 2 mg per deciliter) at enrollment, mortality at 14 days was significantly increased among those receiving methylprednisolone (46 of 78 [59 percent] vs. 17 of 58 [29 percent] among those receiving placebo; P less than 0.01). Among patients treated with methylprednisolone, significantly more deaths were related to secondary infection. We conclude that the use of high-dose corticosteroids provides no benefit in the treatment of severe sepsis and septic shock.\r"

Ultrasonography was performed with small high-resolution, linear-array transducers, with the abdomen compressed to displace or compress bowel and fat. Among 52 patients later shown in surgery to have appendicitis, ultrasonography was unequivocally positive in 39 (sensitivity, 75 percent). Of 31 patients in whom appendicitis was definitely excluded, none had a positive ultrasound examination (specificity, 100 percent). The sensitivity in those with a perforated appendix (28.5 percent) was much lower than in those with acute nonperforating appendicitis (80.5 percent) or appendiceal mass (89 percent), but the low sensitivity did not influence clinical management, since the need for surgery in patients with a perforated appendix was clinically obvious. Ultrasonography resulted in changes in the proposed management in 29 of the 111 patients (26 percent). It also led to the correct diagnosis in the 16 patients who were found to have a disease other than appendicitis. We conclude that ultrasonography is a useful aid in the diagnosis of appendicitis.\r"

To assess the effect of acute falciparum malaria on splenic filtration, we measured the clearance of heated 51Cr-labeled autologous erythrocytes in 25 patients with acute falciparum malaria and in 10 uninfected controls. Two groups of patients could be distinguished. Sixteen patients had splenomegaly, markedly accelerated clearance of the labeled erythrocytes (clearance half-time, 8.4 +/- 4.4 minutes [mean +/- SD] vs. 62.5 +/- 36.5 minutes in controls; P less than 0.001), and a lower mean hematocrit than did the patients without splenomegaly (P less than 0.001). In the nine patients without splenomegaly, clearance was normal. After institution of antimalarial chemotherapy, however, the clearance in this group accelerated to supernormal rates similar to those in the patients with splenomegaly, but without the development of detectable splenomegaly. Clearance was not significantly altered by treatment in the group with splenomegaly. Six weeks later, normal clearance rates were reestablished in most patients in both groups. We conclude that splenic clearance of labeled erythrocytes is enhanced in patients with malaria if splenomegaly is present and is enhanced only after treatment if splenomegaly is absent. Whether this enhanced splenic function applies to parasite-infected erythrocytes in patients with malaria and has any clinical benefit will require further studies.\r"

  ".W": "Haemophilus influenzae type b capsular polysaccharide-diphtheria toxoid conjugate vaccine has recently been shown to be capable of inducing antibodies to H. influenzae in infants. In an evaluation of its clinical efficacy, 60,000 children were enrolled in an open trial in Finland. Children born on odd-numbered days between October 1, 1985, and September 30, 1986, received the vaccine at 3, 4, 6, and 14 months; those born on even-numbered days served as controls. The geometric mean antibody titer measured in a cohort of 99 children rose from a prevaccination level of 0.08 microgram per milliliter at three months of age to 0.42 microgram per milliliter at seven months. Only minor adverse reactions were reported. Up to February 1987, two cases of invasive H. influenzae infection had occurred among the children who had received three doses of vaccine, whereas 12 cases had occurred among the controls (P = 0.0005 by Poisson one-tailed test). The rate of short-term (average follow-up time, five months) protection provided by this conjugate vaccine in infancy was thus 83 percent.\r"

  ".W": "Sixty volunteers with insomnia participated in a randomized, double-blind, controlled clinical trial. After an initial six nights of placebo, 30 subjects (the abrupt-withdrawal group) received 0.5 mg of triazolam nightly for 7 to 10 nights, after which they received placebo. The other 30 subjects (the tapered-dosage group) received the same initial placebo treatment, then triazolam at 0.5 mg for seven nights, at 0.25 mg for two nights, and at 0.125 mg for two nights, and then placebo. As compared with the initial placebo period, the triazolam period significantly reduced the interval before the onset of sleep (sleep latency), and it prolonged sleep duration, reduced the number of awakenings, and improved the self-rated soundness of sleep in all cohorts. In the abrupt-withdrawal group, plasma levels of triazolam were undetectable the morning after the first night of placebo substitution, and subjects reported prolongation of sleep latency (57 minutes longer than base line), reduction in sleep duration (1.4 hours less than base line), and increased awakenings (1.2 per night above base line). The symptoms of rebound sleep disorder lasted one or possibly two nights, and there was a reversion toward base line on subsequent placebo nights. In the tapered-dosage group, however, plasma triazolam levels fell gradually to zero, and rebound symptoms were decreased or eliminated. Thus, rebound sleep disorder following abrupt discontinuation of triazolam can be attenuated by a regimen of tapering.\r"

The primary end point of the study was left ventricular function in patients with first infarctions. Patients who could undergo beta-blockade also received intravenous propranolol. Heparin (for 48 hours) and a combination of low-dose aspirin and dipyridamole were administered to both groups until cineangiography was performed at three weeks. In the patients with first infarctions treated with streptokinase, the left ventricular ejection fraction was 6 percentage points higher (streptokinase vs. placebo, 59 +/- 10.5 vs. 53 +/- 13.5 percent; P less than 0.005), with benefit to patients with either anterior infarction (57 +/- 11.9 vs. 49 +/- 15.9 percent; P less than 0.05) or inferior infarction (60 +/- 9.1 vs. 55 +/- 11.3 percent; P less than 0.05). Left ventricular function was improved regardless of whether concomitant propranolol was given. Survival (at 30 days) was improved with streptokinase: 2 deaths occurred among 79 patients who received this drug, as compared with 12 deaths among 93 patients who received placebo (2.5 vs. 12.9 percent, P = 0.012). Rates of reinfarction (streptokinase vs. placebo, 3 vs. 1 percent) and requirements for surgery or angioplasty (7 vs. 5 percent) were similar in the two groups. We conclude that administration of intravenous streptokinase (1.5 million units) to patients with a first myocardial infarction results in improved left ventricular function and short-term survival.\r"

  ".W": "We conducted a prospective, randomized, multicenter, single-blind trial of propranolol as compared with placebo in the prevention of first upper gastrointestinal tract bleeding in patients with cirrhosis of the liver. A total of 230 patients (90 percent with alcoholism and 46 percent with a Child-Pugh grade C classification) with large esophageal varices without previous bleeding were randomly assigned to receive either propranolol (n = 118) or placebo (n = 112), after they had been divided into two groups according to the severity of their liver disease. The end points of the study were bleeding and death. The dose of propranolol was progressively increased to decrease the heart rate by 20 to 25 percent. The final doses were 40 mg of conventional propranolol and 160 and 320 mg of long-acting propranolol daily in 22 percent, 60 percent, and 18 percent of patients, respectively. The mean (+/- SD) follow-up time among survivors without bleeding was 436 +/- 172 days. The cumulative percentages of patients free of bleeding two years after inclusion in the study were 74 percent (95 percent confidence limits, 61 and 83) in the propranolol group and 39 percent (95 percent confidence limits, 15 and 69) in the placebo group (P less than 0.05). Cumulative two-year survival was 72 percent (95 percent confidence limits, 60 and 81) in the propranolol group and 51 percent (95 percent confidence limits, 37 and 64) in the placebo group (P less than 0.05). The advantage of propranolol over placebo was maintained when potentially confounding variables were adjusted with use of the Cox model. Side effects occurred in 17 percent of the patients who received propranolol and led to the stopping of treatment in 11 percent. We conclude that propranolol can decrease the incidence of first bleeding and death during a period of two years in patients with cirrhosis and large varices.\r"

CT and magnetic resonance studies disclosed a severe, diffuse disorder of the white matter. All side effects and radiographic findings were reversed with discontinuation or a reduction in the dose of cyclosporine. We also observed an inverse association between CNS side effects and total serum cholesterol levels after transplantation. A retrospective analysis of 54 liver transplantations performed in 48 patients revealed that 13 patients had symptoms of CNS toxicity associated with the use of cyclosporine. These patients' total serum cholesterol levels in the first week after transplantation were reduced as compared with those in patients without symptoms (mean +/- SE, 94 +/- 4 mg per deciliter vs. 132 +/- 6, or 2.44 +/- 0.10 mmol per liter vs. 3.43 +/- 0.16). We conclude that cyclosporine therapy for immunosuppression in liver transplantation may cause a syndrome of encephalopathy, seizures, and white-matter changes and that this is most likely to occur in patients with low total serum cholesterol levels after transplantation.\r"

  ".W": "Using data from 1982 and 1984, we examined how Medicare's prospective payment system affected hospitals. The study showed that hospitals paid through the prospective payment system had significantly lower increases in Medicare costs and greater declines in Medicare use than did other hospitals. Unlike these other hospitals, for which Medicare costs approximately equaled Medicare revenues, hospitals receiving prospective payment kept Medicare costs from rising as fast as Medicare revenues, earning the profit that the prospective payment system allowed. The opportunity to earn a profit led hospitals to slow increases in Medicare costs, regardless of the level of revenue constraint. However, the more the prospective payment system constrained hospitals' revenues, the more hospitals slowed increases in Medicare costs. In the most constrained hospitals, slower increases in Medicare costs were accompanied by slower increases in total hospital spending. The least constrained hospitals slowed Medicare cost increases the least and did not show their overall spending. These hospitals nevertheless increased their profit margins the most, since the prospective payment system's federal rate paid them the highest rates relative to base-year costs. Since federal rates produced extra profits, not extra cost containment, their appropriateness is questionable. The prospective payment system should be modified to eliminate windfalls while continuing to promote cost containment.\r"

In those patients the fungus proved quite difficult to culture, delaying correct diagnosis and treatment. We describe seven additional patients with sporotrichosis meningitis, all of whom had antibody to this fungus in cerebrospinal fluid and serum. The antibody in the cerebrospinal fluid was most likely produced locally, as evidenced by its oligoclonality and the relatively high ratio of immunoglobulin to albumin in the cerebrospinal fluid as compared with the serum. Only one of these seven patients, who had active sporotrichosis of the knee joint, had obvious extrameningeal infection. None of 130 patients with meningitis known to be caused by other agents and none of 170 patients with other neurologic disorders had antibody to S. schenckii in their cerebrospinal fluid. We suggest that cerebrospinal fluid should be tested for S. schenckii antibody (in addition to other fungal agents) in any patient with chronic meningitis for which no cause is discovered by the usual diagnostic tests.\r"

The major structural components of Ty-VLPs are proteolytic products of the primary translation product, p1 (ref. 3). We have recently shown that protein p1 alone can form Ty-VLPs (ref. 3). Here we demonstrate that p1 fusion proteins, comprising most of p1 and part of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) protein gp120, form hybrid HIV:Ty-VLPs. These hybrid particles provide a rapid means of preparing and evaluating HIV antigens for a variety of immunological purposes.\r"

This response is mediated by a short DNA sequence, the heat-shock element (HSE), which is thought to be the binding site for a specific transcription factor. Studies with Drosophila show that this protein binds to HSEs only in heat-shocked cells, suggesting that changes in factor binding are responsible for gene activation. We have investigated the properties of HSE-binding proteins from yeast and HeLa cells. In HeLa cells, binding activity is present only after heat shock. In contrast, control and heat-shocked yeast cells yield the same amount of HSE-binding activity; however, the mobility of protein-HSE complexes on polyacrylamide gels is altered following heat shock. This mobility difference can be significantly reduced by treatment of crude extracts with phosphatase. We propose that the yeast heat-shock factor binds constitutively to DNA but only activates transcription after heat-induced phosphorylation.\r"

The polyomavirus major capsid protein VP1, purified after expression of the recombinant gene in Escherichia coli, has been isolated as capsomeres that self-assemble into capsid-like structures in vitro. The ability to switch bonding specificity in different symmetry environments therefore must be intrinsic to the VP1 molecule. In vitro self-assembly provides an assay for VP1 mutations affecting capsomere and capsid formation. We report here that a directed mutation in the VP1 expression vector, leading to a protein truncated at the carboxy terminus, results in a mutant VP1 that forms capsomeres, but not capsids, in the in vitro assembly assay. The carboxy terminus of VP1 therefore appears to be involved in the specific bonding responsible for the non-equivalent association of capsomeres.\r"

  ".W": "The gene coding for the amyloid protein, a component of neuritic plaques found in brain tissue from patients with Alzheimer's disease, has been localized to chromosome 21, and neighbouring polymorphic DNA markers segregate with Alzheimer's disease in several large families. These data, and the association of Alzheimer's disease with Down's syndrome, suggest that overproduction of the amyloid protein, or production of an abnormal variant of the protein, may be the underlying pathological change causing Alzheimer's disease. We have identified a restriction fragment length polymorphism of the A4-amyloid gene, and find recombinants in two Alzheimer's disease families between Alzheimer's disease and the A4-amyloid locus. This demonstrates that the gene for plaque core A4-amyloid cannot be the locus of a defect causing Alzheimer's disease in these families. These data indicate that alterations in the plaque core amyloid gene cannot explain the molecular pathology for all cases of Alzheimer's disease.\r"

Recent molecular genetic evidence has indicated that AP is encoded as part of a larger protein by a gene on chromosome 21 (refs 5-7). The defect in the inherited autosomal dominant form of Alzheimer's disease, familial Alzheimer's disease (FAD), has been mapped to the same approximate region of chromosome 21 by genetic linkage to anonymous DNA markers, raising the possibility that this gene product, which could be important in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease, is also the site of the inherited defect in FAD (ref. 5). We have determined the pattern of segregation of the AP gene in FAD pedigrees using restriction fragment length polymorphisms. The detection of several recombination events with FAD suggests that the AP gene is not the site of the inherited defect underlying this disorder.\r"

  ".W": "The spread of antibiotic resistance in Gram-negative bacteria has sustained a continuing search for new agents with antibacterial activity against this important class of bacterial pathogen. Because the biosynthesis of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is unique to Gram-negative bacteria and required by them for growth and virulence, attempts have been made to discover or design antibacterial agents acting at this site; however, no such agents have so far been developed. We now present definitive experimental data documenting design of the first member of the class of antibacterial compounds which specifically inhibit LPS synthesis. The target enzyme is 3-deoxy-D-manno-octulosonate cytidylytransferase (CMP-KDO synthetase), a cytoplasmic enzyme which activates 3-deoxy-D-manno-octulosonate (KDO) for incorporation into LPS. A specific inhibitor of CMP-KDO synthetase, alpha-C-(1,5-anhydro-7-amino-2,7-dideoxy-D-manno-heptopyranosyl)-carboxy late was designed using results of our studies of the purified enzyme. LPS synthesis ceased and lipid A precursor accumulated, causing growth stasis and perturbation of outer membrane structure and function, following delivery of the inhibitor to the intracellular target by a peptide carrier. Antibacterial action required an intact oligopeptide permease system and specific intracellular aminopeptidase activity to release inhibitor from the peptide prodrug.\r"

Access to liver forms of Plasmodium falciparum has been improved by the development of in vivo and in vitro propagation methods, but the yield of mature schizonts remains limited and does not allow a detailed antigenic analysis. To date, only immunofluorescence assays (IFA) have permitted a description of a species and liver-stage-specific antigen(s) (LSA; ref. 3). Monospecific antibodies to these antigens have not been obtained due either to difficulty in immunizing mice (against LSA), or to poor stability of human monoclonal antibodies. Therefore, as a means of characterizing the LSA, we used an alternative immunological approach to identify clones of the corresponding LSA genes. We describe here the isolation of a DNA sequence coding for a P. falciparum liver-stage-specific antigen composed of repeats of 17 amino-acids, which is immunogenic in man.\r"

There are many precedents for this kind of behaviour in the literature--some oncogenes might be examples of naturally occurring dominant negative mutations.\r"

  ".W": "Rates of protein folding reactions vary considerably. Some denatured proteins regain the native conformation within milliseconds or seconds, whereas others refold very slowly in the time range of minutes or hours. Varying folding rates are observed not only for different proteins, but can also be detected for single polypeptide species. This originates from the co-existence of fast- and slow-folding forms of the unfolded protein, which regain the native state with different rates. The proline hypothesis provides a plausible explanation for this heterogeneity. It assumes that the slow-folding molecules possess non-native isomers of peptide bonds between proline and another residue, and that crucial steps in the refolding of the slow-folding molecules are limited in rate by the slow reisomerization of such incorrect proline peptide bonds. Recently the enzyme peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase (PPIase) was discovered and purified from pig kidney. It catalyses efficiently the cis in equilibrium trans isomerization of proline imidic peptide bonds in oligopeptides. Here we show that it also catalyses slow steps in the refolding of a number of proteins of which fast- and slow-folding species have been observed and where it was suggested that proline isomerization was involved in slow refolding. The efficiency of catalysis depends on the accessibility for the isomerase of the particular proline peptide bonds in the refolding protein chain.\r"

Here evidence is provided for the existence of a new type of hybrid molecule (DR alpha-DQ beta) arising by mixed-isotype pairing in human B-cell lines. Class II isotype-mismatched heterodimers have been recently reported in the mouse after transfection of class II genes, and our data demonstrate that such interisotypic pairing can occur in untransfected cells. This crosspairing greatly enhances the repertoire of the class II antigens that regulate immune responses and leads us to reconsider the HLA-disease association.\r"

This response is apparently universal, occurring in the entire range from bacterial to mammalian cells. In Escherichia coli heat shock protein synthesis transiently increases following a shift from 30 degrees C to 42 degrees C as a result of changes in transcription initiation at heat shock promoters. Heat shock promoters are recognized by RNA polymerase containing a sigma factor of relative molecular mass (Mr) 32,000 (32K) E sigma 32 and not E sigma 70, the major form of RNA polymerase holoenzyme. To determine whether changes in the concentration of sigma 32 regulate this response, we measured the amount of sigma 32 before and after shift to high temperature and found that it increased transiently during heat shock as a result of changes in sigma 32 synthesis and stability. Our results indicate that sigma 32 is directly responsible for regulation of the heat shock response.\r"

A sequence, Asp-Thr-Gly, which is conserved in retroviral proteases is also conserved in the active sites of aspartic proteases, an observation which has led to the suggestion that the retroviral proteases could belong to this family. We have examined the sequences of the aspartic and retroviral protease families, using pattern-recognition, structure prediction and molecular modelling techniques, and conclude that the viral protease sequences probably correspond to a single domain of an aspartic protease and may function in a dimeric form. We have constructed a model of the pol-protease of human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) to test this hypothesis.\r"

The CSF anti-MBP antibodies migrated to the anodal region of the IgG area in a different fashion from oligoclonal IgG and anti-measles IgG antibodies, which were detected in parallel. The anti-MBP bands were transient in three of seven patients whom we studied consecutively. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) of serum and CSF for detection of IgG reactivity against MBP showed absorbance values above 2 standard deviations of controls in 44% of the MS patients and in 21% of those with other neurologic diseases.

From 1963 to 1985, approximately 10,000 children received pit-hGH. These patients, exposed to pooled products potentially contaminated with the CJD agent, may have significantly increased the number of individuals whose blood and tissues could transmit CJD. This possibility as well as data on the pathophysiology of CJD and scrapie, a related disease of animals, should guide the development of practices that would limit iatrogenic spread of CJD.\r"

The incidence of pregnancy-induced hypertension was 11.1% in the placebo group and 4.0% in the calcium group, a nonsignificant difference. Combining these values with previous data, we found a dose-effect relationship between calcium intake and BP reduction during the third trimester of pregnancy.

There were four treatment failures in the labetalol group (N = 40) and none in the hydralazine group (N = 20). Hydralazine lowered mean arterial pressure (MAP) more than did labetalol (33.3 +/- 13.2 versus 25.5 +/- 11.2 mmHg; mean +/- SD), but labetalol had a more rapid effect. There was considerable interpatient variability in the dose of labetalol required to control BP, which could not be predicted by any clinical characteristic before therapy. The duration of action also varied in the labetalol group, with the shortest duration occurring in those patients who required the highest dosage for BP control. No significant fetal or neonatal problems ascribable to drug treatment were noted in the 13 instances in which labetalol was given before delivery. However, fetal distress occurred in two of the six cases involving antenatal hydralazine. We conclude that labetalol appears to be a safe and effective alternative to hydralazine for treating hypertension in the peripartum period, but serious rare side effects have not yet been quantified.\r"

We transformed the data to menstrual age (gestational age) by adding 14 days to the date of ovulation and compared our crown-rump length values with those of two previous reports. At corresponding crown-rump length values, the gestational ages from our data differed from those in the previous studies.

Scanning was used to measure the deepest amniotic fluid pool and to grade placental echogenic changes. Oligohydramnios, defined as an amniotic fluid pool less than 30 mm, was detected in 33 patients (17%) and was an indication for intervention. Grade III placenta was found in 53 patients (27%), and no grade could be assigned in 13 (7%). Intrauterine growth retardation and meconium-stained or absent amniotic fluid at amniotomy occurred significantly more often in association with oligohydramnios than with grade III placenta, which was found before spontaneous labor in only 24% of cases. Ultrasound placental grading appears to offer little useful additional information to amniotic fluid quantitation in satisfactory monitoring of prolonged pregnancies.\r"

We assessed 4148 fetuses within seven days of delivery. The ability of each variable to predict perinatal death was expressed as the likelihood ratio, which incorporates sensitivity and specificity into one number. The predictive ability was most accurate with fetal movement (likelihood ratio 48.1) and the combined biophysical profile score (likelihood ratio 51.0). The biophysical profile score was more likely to predict perinatal death due to asphyxia (seven of eight) than lethal anomaly (six of 19). The overall perinatal mortality was 7.6 per 1000 total births. The perinatal mortality rate was 1.0 for a normal biophysical profile score, 31.3 for an equivocal score, and 200.0 for an abnormal score. The false-negative rate for the biophysical profile score was 0.7 per 1000.\r"

A positive correlation was found between Bacteroides sp isolated from the vaginal fluid and vaginal cuff abscesses in the vaginally operated women. The complications of infection are explained by the decrease in host defense, occurring more frequently in patients treated with the vaginal approach than with the abdominal technique.\r"

The study was divided into three time periods based on the diagnostic methods used in each. In the first period (1972-1975), diagnosis was by culdocentesis and the urine pregnancy test. In the second period (1976-1978), diagnostic laparoscopy was added. Finally, in the third period (1979-1985), serum beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (beta-hCG) assay and pelvic ultrasonography were added. A rising trend in diagnostic accuracy was observed from the first period to the third. The predictability and the negative predictive value of diagnostic tests in the third period were 96.3 and 94.9%, respectively--significantly higher than in the first and second periods. The incidence of unruptured tubal pregnancy increased significantly, from 27.6% in the first and the second periods to 42.5% in the third period. Laparoscopy, ultrasonography, and serum beta-hCG assay each revealed a positive rate of more than 90% in the diagnosis of tubal pregnancy. Laparoscopy had the highest positive predictive value as a single test in the third period. Among suspected cases, however, laparoscopy was found to have a low accuracy in discriminating between tubal pregnancy and infection. The combination of serum beta-hCG testing and ultrasonography produced a 99% positive predictive value, and revealed a higher degree of accuracy in the diagnosis of tubal pregnancy than any other single test or combination of tests.\r"

One hundred sixty-eight patients entered the study, and 148 were evaluable at five years or longer. All had residual tumors larger than 10 cm, with appropriate stratification according to stage, histologic grade, and age. Definition of response was according to World Health Organization (WHO) criteria except that we required three months' regression of all clinically detectable tumors instead of one month. Seventy-three women treated with doxorubicin plus melphalan had a significantly higher response rate than 75 patients treated with melphalan alone (54.7 versus 26.7%; P less than .0001), median duration of response (13.0 versus 7.3 months; P less than .0057), and median survival time (18.5 versus 10.5 months; P less than .0001). Combined treatment produced significantly more complete remissions than single-agent therapy (30 versus 6.7%; P less than .001). At 60 months, ten patients were alive in the doxorubicin plus melphalan group, compared with three in the melphalan group. Temporary bone marrow depression was significantly more frequent in the melphalan-treated patients, but subjective side effects were the same in both groups.\r"

A linear growth function was observed across gestational age, and a high degree of correlation existed between gestational age and the transverse (r = 0.809, P less than .0001), anteroposterior (r = 0.798, P less than .0001), and longitudinal (r = 0.749, P less than .0001) diameters. These data provide a method by which variations from the norm can be assessed, and offer potential prenatal diagnosis of a variety of gastrointestinal lesions.\r"

Sixty-three percent of procedures were successful on the first try; 95% succeeded within three attempts. Sixty-four percent of the samples were obtained from the placental cord origin, 27% from a free-floating loop, and 9% from the fetal cord origin. There were no maternal or significant fetal complications, and bleeding from the puncture site was not a problem. The present series confirms previous reports suggesting that in the proper hands, cordocentesis for diagnosis is a safe, rapid, and efficient means of obtaining access to the fetal circulation.\r"

The general opinion taken from a wide variety of publications is that the serum lipid concentrations change during hormone replacement therapy with estrogen, progesterone, and testosterone, or when oral contraceptives are administered. The intolerance of many women to oral contraceptives and the many side effects developed from the birth control pill lead us to suggest that pure crystalline estrogen pellets for subcutaneous implantation are an excellent method of contraception, adding beneficial influence upon lipid metabolism by increasing HDL concentration. The use of progestogens (nortestosterone or hydroxysteroid derivatives) in order to induce withdrawal periods and to avoid endometrial hyperplasia is recommended. But it is important to note that the nortestosterone derivatives (norgestrel and norethindrone acetate) differ markedly from the nonadrogenic 17-alpha hydroxyprogesterone derivative in that the former lowers HDL levels noticeably more than the latter.\r"

The decision to prescribe any given estrogen or progestogen and by a particular route has a significant impact on cardiovascular risk factors. Among the estrogens, native estradiol and estrone are favored over equine and synthetic estrogens. Given this choice, oral and systemic routes of administration are not sufficiently different clinically to endorse one method over the other, except for the unusual hypertensive woman or the patient with a history of thromboembolic phenomena. Among the progestogens, oral micronized progesterone offers much promise for use in postmenopausal women. However, the oral use of lower doses of other progestogens seems appropriate at the present time. With the availability of oral micronized progesterone and in time a transdermal system, the need for alternate routes of administration for other progestogens seems unnecessary.\r"

Added progestogen, in proper duration and dosage, almost completely negates the estrogen-increased risk for adenocarcinoma of the endometrium.

In the premenopausal woman, such therapy should also provide contraception. Because of the lack of minimal dose products fulfilling such criteria, many physicians will allow women to continue with their contraceptive if they do not smoke and have no other contraindications. It will remain to be seen if a product close to ideal can be found to fulfill the contraceptive and therapeutic needs of women traversing the most physiologically hazardous period of their lives.\r"

  ".U": "87316325\r", 
  ".W": "Thus, the effects that a specific estrogen has on the liver is the summation of several mechanisms, including the first pass mechanism and the enhanced delivery of circulating estrogens to this organ. For example, the major estrogen in conjugated estrogen is estrone sulfate. Based on the present data, very little circulating estrone sulfate is available to the brain or uterus (Fig. 25). Since most of the hypothalamus is behind the blood-brain barrier, it is unlikely estrone sulfate exerts a direct action on gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) neurons to reduce its secretion and, subsequently, gonadotropin levels. Estrone sulfate also does not interact with the estrogen receptor. It is possible the small amount of estrone sulfate that crosses the blood-brain barrier is converted to unconjugated estrogens locally and these could have function. More likely, the major mechanism by which estrone sulfate suppresses GnRH release is through conversion to unconjugated estrogens, principally estrone, in the liver. The large extraction of estrone sulfate by the liver allows accessibility of the hepatocyte for this conversion. Based on this concept, conjugated estrogen must enter the liver to be converted to its active forms. The route of administration then should have little impact on changing the relative potency of this preparation on hepatic and nonhepatic markers of estrogen action. For ethinyl estradiol, the preparation is orally active because it is rapidly and almost completely absorbed from the stomach and undergoes limited hepatic metabolism before entry into the general circulation (Fig. 26). This limited hepatic metabolism reduces the impact of the first pass mechanism on ethinyl estradiol. Thus, the enhanced hepatic action of ethinyl estradiol is principally related to the greater entry of this estrogen into the liver than other organs (Fig. 27). Consequently, the route of administration should have little impact on the exaggerated hepatic actions of this estrogen. Orally administered estradiol undergoes substantial hepatic metabolism to less active forms, principally estrogen conjugates. The amount of estradiol leaving the liver following oral administration is substantially less than that which enters it through the portal vein. The systemic administration of estradiol avoids this initial hepatic metabolism. Furthermore, only 25 per cent of nonorally administered estrogen will go to the liver at each pass, and nonhepatic tissues would be exposed to a greater extent than after oral administration. Thus, peripheral administration of estradiol reduces the exaggerated hepatic responses in comparison to nonhepatic actions.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

The incidence of hyperplasia is dose dependent; the incidence of carcinoma is both dose and duration dependent. The risk of carcinoma is small. Invasive procedures such as endometrial biopsy to detect those patients with hyperplasia and carcinoma are unlikely to be cost-effective and have other disadvantages. With cyclic estrogens, biopsies should be performed at regular intervals irrespective of the bleeding pattern. The possible alterations to cyclic treatments to reduce the risk of endometrial hyperstimulation have been reviewed; only progestogen addition has been shown to be effective. Maximal effects are obtained when progestogens are added for 12 to 13 days each calendar month. To reduce the risk of side effects, the minimum dose of progestogen should be prescribed, and with the nor-testosterone derivatives, a small dose of norethindrone, approximately 1 mg daily, is as effective as 5 mg daily. The smaller doses cause minimal lipid changes. Interpatient variation in response to the 17-hydroxyprogesterone derivatives can occur, and at high doses, adverse lipid effects have been reported. With sequential estrogen/progestogen therapies, the endometrial histology appears to correlate with the bleeding pattern, thereby, perhaps, obviating the need for biopsy. The development of regimens to induce endometrial atrophy and amenorrhea is suboptimal, and further research is required.\r"

However, accurate identification of those at risk for fractures is impossible at present. By judicious use of risk assessment and the addition of bone mass measurements in the postmenopausal patient, the physician can define a group of patients who will be at some increased likelihood of subsequent osteoporosis. Since estrogen therapy is the most effective single agent for prevention of bone loss, estrogens can be recommended for this group of patients, if otherwise not contraindicated. The addition of a progestogen to the regimen may add to the effect of estrogen by stimulating bone formation. Estrogen therapy may have other effects in the postmenopausal patient population that must be considered when deciding about the introduction of therapy.\r"

Both graft enlargements were due to epithelial-lined cysts that developed within the graft tissue. These cysts were treated by excising the cysts walls and allowing the resultant cavity to heal spontaneously. Light microscopy of the excised tissue revealed that the clear cysts were lined by a non-keratinizing, stratified squamous epithelium. The histogenesis of the cysts is unclear, but most likely they are the result of incompletely removed or implanted conjunctival or corneal epithelium. Several other possibilities are discussed. Due to the difficulty of removing all corneal and conjunctival epithelium, cystic complications of dermis-fat grafts make unattractive their use for volume enhancement in patients with microphthalmia or following evisceration.\r"

The system is designed to identify and type HSV from direct lesion smears (DS) and from cell culture smears (CS) infected with a swab from the patient's lesion by means of an indirect fluorescence assay (IFA) using HSV type-common and HSV-2 type-specific monoclonal antibodies. A total of 71 coded specimens manifesting clinical characteristics consistent with HSV were included in this evaluation from which DS, CS, and VI were performed. Specimens were taken from a variety of intraoral and extraoral sites, from both recurrent and primary lesions, and at various stages of lesion progression. The results showed that HSV was not detected in 22 of the 71 specimens by either DS, CS, or VI. Forty-nine specimens were positive by both CS and VI; 47 of these were typed as HSV-1 and 2 were typed as HSV-2. Thirty-eight of the 49 positive CS and VI specimens also were positive by DS. The remaining 11 DS slides did not have sufficient cells for analysis. It was concluded that the success of a valid DS test depended on the stage of the lesion and the sampling technique. The sensitivity and specificity of CS and DS were 100% and 82%, respectively, for detection of virus when compared with VI. When done properly with an adequate number of cells from the lesion, the DS proved to be an accurate and rapid (2 hours) procedure.\r"

Systemic reactions were similar in the two vaccine groups and resembled those expected with the diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis injection alone. Six (13%) and seven (14%) of the PRP and PRP-D recipients, respectively, had minor local reactions to the Haemophilus vaccine. Among the 77 children who were not already naturally immune (ie, anti-PRP antibody concentration of less than or equal to 0.15 micrograms of protein per milliliter) before vaccination, PRP-D was significantly more effective than PRP in inducing protective levels of antibody. Only 15 (43%) of the 35 nonimmune PRP recipients achieved a concentration of greater than or equal to 0.15 microgram/mL and only seven (20%) reached a concentration greater than or equal to 1.0 micrograms/mL following vaccination. In contrast, 34 (81%) of the 42 nonimmune recipients of PRP-D had a concentration of greater than or equal to 0.15 microgram/mL following vaccine and 32 (62%) had a concentration of greater than or equal to 1.0 micrograms/mL (P less than or equal to .001). These results suggest that more than one-half of nonimmune 18-month-old infants will not respond to PRP with protective levels of antibody. In light of the current data, recommendation for revaccination at 24 months of age for those immunized at any younger age is appropriate.\r"

Brainstorming was used initially with Council on Graduate Education for Administration in Nursing (CGEAN) members in 1984, to delineate concepts for definitions. Definitions and research questions were generated and rated in a three-round Delphi survey by 129 experts from nursing and health administration. According to the most widely supported definition, nursing administration research is concerned with establishing costs of nursing care, examining the relationships between nursing services and quality patient care, and viewing problems of nursing service delivery within the broader context of policy analysis and delivery of health services. The research question of most importance was: What are the cost-effective components of clinical nursing care that yield high patient satisfaction, decrease the number of complications, and shorten hospital stay for identified groups of patients? In a scenario exercise at the 1985 CGEAN meeting, additional priorities identified were vulnerable populations and equity.\r"

Vitamin supplementation at doses higher than the recommended daily allowance is, at present, an unknown factor in preventing cancer and may cause toxic effects in some instances. Consuming megadoses doses of any vitamin or mineral as a cancer preventive should be discouraged. Physicians need to take a more aggressive stance against alternative health care providers who recommend questionable dietary or nutritional regimens. Because of the proliferation of food quacks in recent years and the danger they represent to the general public, physicians need to make preventive health care an important part of their responsibility. This includes educating patients on proper nutrition.\r"

Two genes with homology to protein kinases were isolated and characterized by DNA sequence analysis. These genes, designated KIN1 and KIN2, are closely related to each other. Among previously characterized protein kinases, the products of KIN1 and KIN2 are most closely related to the bovine cAMP-dependent protein kinase (30% amino acid identities) and the protein encoded by the v-src oncogene (27% and 25% identities with KIN1 and KIN2, respectively) within their putative kinase domains. KIN1 and KIN2 are transcribed into 3.5-kilobase mRNAs that contain uninterrupted open reading frames encoding polypeptides of 117 kDa and 126 kDa, respectively. The predicted proteins are unusual in two respects: (i) their catalytic domains are carried near the N termini of relatively large proteins, in contrast to the majority of characterized protein kinases, and (ii) these catalytic domains are structural mosaics, with some features characteristic of tyrosine-specific protein kinases and other elements that are distinctive of serine/threonine-specific enzymes.\r"

The RNA polymerase is first synthesized as a larger precursor polypeptide, which is subsequently processed by a viral proteinase, 3Cpro, to give the mature polymerase molecule, 3Dpol. To further characterize the poliovirus RNA polymerase, we have constructed plasmids that expressed this protein in Escherichia coli. The plasmids consisted of fusions between the E. coli DNA encoding the first 13 amino acids of the trp operon leader protein and viral genes encoding the 3Cpro and 3Dpol polypeptides. E. coli harboring such plasmids gave significant, inducible levels of enzymatically active RNA polymerase as determined by the poly(A).oligo(U) poly(U) polymerase assay. The purified RNA polymerase activity from E. coli corresponded to a protein with the approximate molecular weight of the mature 3Dpol protein. The availability of a recombinant, enzymatically active poliovirus RNA polymerase provides a system in which we can precisely delineate the role this enzyme plays in the regulation of poliovirus replication.\r"

We have purified wild-type CAP and two substituted CAP variants, [Val181]CAP and [Leu181]CAP, and have assessed the DNA-sequence-recognition properties in vitro with respect to positions 5, 6, 7, 8, and 16 of the DNA site. The data indicate that [Val181]CAP and [Leu181]CAP fail to discriminate between the consensus DNA base pair and the three non-consensus-DNA base pairs at 2-fold-related positions 7 and 16 of the DNA site. In contrast, [Val181]CAP and [Leu181]CAP retain the ability to discriminate between different base pairs at positions 5 and 8 of the DNA site. We conclude that Glu-181 of CAP makes a direct contact with 2-fold-related positions 7 and 16 of the DNA site, as proposed previously based on in vivo results. We propose that upon replacement of Glu-181 by valine or leucine, this contact is eliminated and is replaced by no other functional contact. We estimate that the contact by Glu-181 with each position contributes -0.7 kcal/mol to the total CAP-DNA binding free energy.\r"

A second pair of states related by the same ligand binding is accessible as a consequence of either a conformational change or a \"covalent modification.\" By taking proper account of detailed balance, we show that the notion of covalent modification in this context includes three cases, two of which involve dissipation of metabolic energy. The condition for exact adaptation is dependent on metabolite concentrations in all cases of covalent modification. The performance of the model is critically examined on thermodynamic and kinetic grounds.\r"

The L and M subunits are related to each other by a 2-fold rotational symmetry axis that is approximately the same as that determined for the cofactors.

The guinea pig antisera did not recognize insulin but reacted weakly with C peptide at high concentrations; the rabbit antisera reacted with neither insulin nor C peptide. Immunocytochemical studies with human islet tissue localized the immunoreactivity of these antisera to clathrin-coated (pro)secretory vesicles derived from the trans Golgi, indicating that cleavage of the C-peptide-A-chain junction of proinsulin occurs mainly, if not exclusively, in this compartment of the beta cell.\r"

Among the base substitutions, transitions (both A.T----G.C and G.C----A.T) are strongly favored over transversions (96% versus 4%). Large site-to-site differences are observed among identical base substitutions, presumably reflecting the modulating effects of neighboring bases. The single-base-deletion spectrum is dominated by a large hotspot at a run of adjacent identical base pairs, implying a Streisinger-slippage mechanism. The data, when compared to a previously determined wild-type spectrum, also provide information on the specificity of the mismatch repair system.\r"

Significant homologies were observed. One of the highly conserved regions that contains a tryptophan residue and two glutamic acid residues is probably part of the beta-D-galactoside binding site, which, on the basis of spectroscopic studies of the electric eel lectin, is expected to contain such residues. The similarity of the hydropathy profiles and the predicted secondary structure of the lectins from chicken skin and electric eel, in spite of differences in their amino acid sequences, strongly suggests that these proteins have maintained structural homologies during evolution and together with the other beta-D-galactoside binding lectins were derived from a common ancestor gene.\r"

A putative intracellular domain 435 amino acids long shows high homology with the SRC family of tyrosine kinases and within the kinase domain is most homologous with the human insulin receptor (44%) and v-abl (41%). Despite these similarities, however, we found no apparent sequence homology to other growth factor receptors in the putative ligand-binding domain.

The polar head group of this glycophospholipid, which is a phosphooligosaccharide, was generated by treatment with a phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C from Staphylococcus aureus. There was an \"insulin-like\" inhibitory effect of this phosphooligosaccharide on isoproterenol-stimulated lipolysis in adipocytes, whereas there was no effect on glucose oxidation under conditions that measure glucose transport. The antilipolytic effect of this phosphooligosaccharide was demonstrated in intact adipocytes. There was a linear correlation between the concentration of phosphooligosaccharide and its antilipolytic effect, the magnitude and time course of which were similar to that obtained with physiological concentrations of insulin. Submaximal concentrations of insulin and phosphooligosaccharide produced an additive antilipolytic effect. The antilipolytic effect of the phosphooligosaccharide was demonstrated only after release of this compound from the precursor glycophospholipid with phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C, and the activity of the phosphooligosaccharide was sensitive to alkali. It is proposed that this phosphooligosaccharide plays a role in mediating certain insulin actions.\r"

It involves a single point mutation in the proinsulin gene resulting in the substitution of aspartic acid for histidine-10 of the B chain of insulin. We have synthesized a human insulin analogue, [AspB10]insulin, corresponding to the mutant proinsulin and evaluated its biological activity. [AspB10]Insulin displayed a binding affinity to insulin receptors in rat liver plasma membranes that was 534 +/- 146% relative to the natural hormone. In lipogenesis assays, the synthetic analogue exhibited a potency that was 435 +/- 144% relative to insulin, which is statistically not different from its binding affinity. Reversed-phase HPLC indicated that the synthetic analogue is more apolar than natural insulin. We suggest that the observed properties reflect changes in the conformation of the analogue relative to natural insulin, which result in a stronger interaction with the insulin receptor. Thus, a single substitution of an amino acid residue of human insulin has resulted in a superactive hormone.\r"

In enteric bacteria structural genes for flagellar, chemotaxis, and motility operons appear to be under coordinate control, however, the nature of the regulatory factors has not been determined. Sequence analysis of many such genes has failed to reveal plausible promoter sequences for the predominant bacterial RNA polymerase, and several such genes are not transcribed effectively in vitro by the Escherichia coli sigma 70 RNA polymerase. However, all of the sequenced flagellar, chemotaxis, and motility operons from the enteric bacteria are preceded by DNA sequences highly homologous to B. subtilis sigma 28 promoters. We propose that an alternative sigma factor controls expression of the flagellar regulon in both B. subtilis and in the enteric bacteria.\r"

The product of E1A 13S mRNA is responsible for the trans-activation, whereas the 12S mRNA product has no effect. Analysis of the c-fos promoter sequences required for the E1A stimulation shows that responsive sequences are located between positions -402 and -240 upstream of the transcription initiation site.

The 2-fold symmetry axis that relates the L and M subunits is, within the accuracy of 5 degrees, parallel to the normal of the membrane. The thickness of the membrane is estimated to be 40-45 A. Residues that are exposed to the membrane are relatively poorly conserved in the sequences of homologous RC proteins. The surface area of the RC is comparable to the surface areas of water-soluble proteins of similar molecular weight. The volumes of interior atoms in the RC are also similar to those of water-soluble proteins, indicating the same compact packing for both types of proteins. The electrostatic potential of the cofactors was calculated. The results show an asymmetry in the potential between the two possible pathways of electron transfer, with the A branch being preferred electrostatically.\r"

An immunofluorescence study was carried out with a rabbit antiserum directed against CBP35 to map the cellular fluorescence distribution in a large population of cells under different growth conditions. This cytometric analysis showed that the lectin is predominantly localized in the nucleus of the proliferating cells. In quiescent 3T3 cultures, the majority of the cells lost their nuclear staining and underwent a general decrease in the overall fluorescence intensity. Stimulation of serum-starved quiescent 3T3 cells by the addition of serum resulted in an increase in the level of CBP35. The percentage of cells showing distinct punctate intranuclear staining reached a maximum at about the same time as the onset of the first S-phase of the cell cycle. All of these results suggest that CBP35 may be a protein whose presence in the nucleus, in discrete punctate distribution, is coordinated with the proliferation state of the cell.\r"

A recombinational hot spot is found at the end of the region of homology.

This element is flanked on each side by a 9-base-pair inverted, repeat sequence and requires closely linked genes for inversion. Homology analysis of the products of these genes, fimB and fimE, reveals a strong similarity with the proposed DNA binding domain of lambda integrase, which mediates site-specific recombination in the presence of integration host factor. Integration host factor, encoded by himA and hip/himD, binds to the sequence 5' TNYAANNNRTTGAT 3', where Y = pyrimidine and R = purine, in mediating integration-excision. In analyzing the DNA flanking the fim 314-base-pair inversion sequence, we found the adjacent sequence 5' TTTAACTTATTGAT 3', which corresponds perfectly with the consensus integration host factor binding site. To characterize the role of himA in phase variation, we transduced either a deletion of himA or an insertionally inactivated hip/himD gene into an E. coli strain with a fimA-lacZ operon fusion. We found the rate of phase variation decreases sharply from 10(-3) to less than 10(-5) per cell per generation. Southern hybridization analysis demonstrates that the himA mutation results in a failure of the switch-generated genetic rearrangement. When the transductant was transformed with a himA+ plasmid, normal switching returned. Thus integration host factor is required for normal type 1 fimbriae phase variation in E. coli.\r"

Several mutations abolish both levels of L4 control; others eliminate either transcriptional or translational control with little or no effect on the other mode of regulation.

The type IIA EC did produce a full spectrum of vWf multimers in both cell lysates and postculture medium, although the relative amounts of the largest species were decreased. The large multimers were degraded in conjunction with the appearance of rapidly migrating satellites that contained approximately equal to 170-kDa proteolytic fragments, suggesting that this patient's functional defect is due to abnormal proteolysis and not to a primary failure of vWf subunit oligomerization. Moreover, the observed degradation appears to result from an abnormal vWf molecule and not elevated protease levels. These results suggest that this patient's von Willebrand disease phenotype is caused by increased proteolytic sensitivity of his vWf protein.\r"

We have now examined the effects of daily administration to adult rats (and in a few experiments, mice) of antiserum to NGF on (i) the collateral sprouting of undamaged nociceptive nerves that occurs into denervated adjacent skin and (ii) the regeneration of cutaneous sensory axons that occurs after they are damaged. The results were unexpected. All collateral sprouting was prevented and that already in progress was halted; sprouting resumed when treatment was discontinued. In contrast, the reestablishment, and even enlargement, of cutaneous nerve fields by regenerating axons was unaffected by anti-NGF treatment, even after dorsal rhizotomy was done to eliminate any central trophic support. In denervated skin, regenerating and collaterally sprouting axons utilized the same cellular pathways to establish functionally identical fields, thus displaying apparently identical growth behaviors, yet anti-NGF treatment clearly distinguished between them. We suggest that endogenous NGF is responsible for the collateral sprouting of nociceptive axons, probably reflecting an ongoing function of NGF in the regulation of their fields. This demonstration in the adult sensory system of a defined role for NGF in nerve growth could apply to nerve growth factors generally in the adult nervous system. The regeneration, however, of nociceptive axons (and nonnociceptive one) is not dependent on NGF.\r"

In nonstimulated cells, the molar ratios of phosphate estimated in alpha, beta, and delta subunits were 0.02, 0.05, and 0.5, respectively. All three subunits contained predominantly phosphoserine with some phosphothreonine; the beta subunit also contained phosphotyrosine. Incubating cells with agents that stimulate cAMP-dependent pathways (isoproterenol, forskolin, 8-Br-cAMP) increased the phosphorylation of the delta subunit by 50%, but phosphate labeling of the beta subunit was depressed by a third. In contrast, when cells were incubated with the divalent cation ionophores A-23187 or ionomycin, phosphorylation of both the delta and beta subunits increased. The results indicate that acetylcholine receptors are phosphorylated to significant levels in skeletal muscle cells and that cAMP-dependent and Ca2+-dependent pathways exist for controlling the phosphorylation state of the receptor subunits.\r"

The studies that have been conducted, moreover, often lack control conditions and appropriate measurement techniques. The goal of most schools is to increase \"self-care\" behaviors and thereby decrease other related problems, such as pain intensity and absenteeism. The literature, however, provides limited support for the idea that a low back school can influence variables such as the number of health care contacts, sick leave, work status, pain intensity or duration, activity level, or medication consumption. Whether the patient's level of knowledge improves as a result of attending the low back school is unclear. Some evidence suggests that patients' attitudes toward back care do change. We conclude, therefore, that more information is needed about the effects of low back schools so that they may be improved. A central concept of low back school programs that should be examined is patient compliance. How well patients comprehend the material presented in the low back school or whether the school results in behavioral changes in the participants remains to be determined.\r"

The normal spring support of the tip by the medial crura will ordinarily give adequate tip projection in a well-executed rhinoplasty. If additional tip projection is required, the simplest procedures are advancement of the columella and tip upward on the end of the septum and similar advancement of the alar cartilages toward the bridge. For additional support, a cartilage strut is inserted between the medial crura. Retrusion of the distal nasal complex requires maxillary advancement or support beneath the base of the alae and columella. If a tip graft is required, one achieves a more natural tip by a posterior conchal graft, utilizing its natural curve, rather than by a building-block support.\r"

The lining repair is the key factor to the successful outcome of the operation. Three clinical situations may be distinguished. First, the mucosa is sufficient to restore a new gullet. In this case, it is widely undermined and sutured along the midline without any tension. Second, the mucosa is only partially sufficient. The same procedure as above is adopted to close the lower two-thirds of the pharyngostome, while an advancement flap is outlined from the base of the tongue to restore the upper third. Third, the mucosa is not sufficient. A musculocutaneous flap solves the problem. Reconstruction of the intermediate layer involves rotation of one (or both) sternomastoid muscle(s), if present. The possibilities for coverage include a submandibular flap, a thoracoacromial flap, and/or musculocutaneous flaps. By following these guidelines, the authors have successfully closed 37 pharyngostomes.\r"

In order to produce a pendulous breast which is also ptotic, the tissue-expansion technique has been combined with two other procedures. A new technique is being introduced. It is that of elevating the lower third of the mature breast capsule surrounding the tissue expander at the time the permanent prosthesis is to be exchanged for the expander. The established techniques of inframammary fold reconstruction of Pennisi and Ryan are used to provide pedicle skin coverage for the undersurface of the breast and the bed of the elevated capsule. Internal and external surgical approaches are described, and two examples of each are illustrated. Breasts reconstructed in this manner have remained pendulous structures. Some loss of the initial degree of ptosis has been noted in some cases.\r"

In this study, we report our 11-year experience of 175 Arab patients with this disease. As with other ethnic groups, the most common manifestation (93.7 per cent) was peritonitis. Arthritis (33.7 per cent) and pleurisy (32 per cent) were next in frequency. Adult patients in this series unlike those in other ethnic groups, rarely presented with arthritis. Similarly rare were amyloidosis, rashes, splenomegaly, hepatomegaly or lymphadenopathy. The aetiology of this disease is not clear but we suspect that abnormalities in catecholamine metabolism may be a factor in the pathogenesis.\r"

Fifteen patients (7.7 per cent) died within a year of diagnosis. Of 26 patients treated with insulin, six died in the first year, 14 were successfully transferred to diet and oral agent treatment and six continued on insulin--two of whom failed to a trial of oral agents, two showed only a temporary response and two received no trial. A further nine patients were taking insulin 12 months after diagnosis because of no response (eight patients) or a transient response (one patient) only to oral agents. Age, percentage ideal body weight, history of acute onset, blood glucose, glycosylated haemoglobin, and random C-peptide concentration at diagnosis did not discriminate between patients requiring insulin at 12 months and those successfully treated without insulin. Patients who were insulin-dependent 12 months after diagnosis had an increased frequency of ketonuria at diagnosis and a previous medical history of endocrine disease. In insulin-dependent patients there was an increased frequency of HLA DR3 but not DR4 and an increased frequency of thyroid microsomal and gastric parietal cell antibodies but not islet cell antibodies. It is concluded that elderly newly-diagnosed diabetic patients who are treated at diagnosis with insulin are not necessarily insulin dependent and can be given a trial of oral agents with safety.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Between 1979 and 1981 83 patients referred to the same physicians and pathologists were treated with combination chemotherapy (methotrexate, cyclophosphamide and CCNU) for 12 weeks. Overall median survival in the 1971 to 1978 group was two months with the actively-treated patients surviving for five months vs. less than one month for treatment of symptoms only. For the 83 patients treated with combination chemotherapy, median survival was nine months with 33 per cent alive at one year and 13 per cent at two years. Positive factors associated with prolonged survival included performance status at presentation and response to chemotherapy. This study demonstrates that the prognosis for the majority of patients with small cell carcinoma of the bronchus has improved significantly with the introduction of combination chemotherapy.\r"

These include shorter exposure times with less chance for motion unsharpenss, more adequate exposure and possible lower dose, and longer tube life. 2. Control of tube voltage in increments of 1 kVp are desirable for screen-film mammography and 2 kVp for xeromammography. 3. Tube loading limitations should be capable of allowing an adequate mA and mAs output. A mammography unit with a lower mA output may require longer exposure times with consequent motion unsharpness and/or higher dose. The maximum mA output is limited by the power rating of the tube and not by the power rating of the generator, which is usually much higher. Thus, tube rating charts rather than generator power rating should be used to compare the mA output of different mammography units. 4. Phototimer capability can reduce exam time, facilitate proper exposure, and reduce radiation dose. Units with a greater number of density steps and three or more photocell locations, one of which is near the edge of the film holder, provide better phototimer results. 5. A molybdenum target, beryllium window tube with 0.03 mm molybdenum added filtration is presently preferred for screen-film mammography. A tungsten target tube with 1 to 2 mm added aluminum filtration is advised for xeromammography. 6. Effective local spot size for contact mammography should be in the range of 0.2 to 0.5 mm. However, high resolution also requires sufficiently long source-to-image-receptor distances. Using measured focal spot size and source-to-image-receptor distance, it has been shown that some mammography units do not fully utilize the resolution capabilities of some available screen-film systems. On the other hand, a focal spot that is too small may limit the field size and lead to uneven energy distribution in the x-ray field. 7. In order to perform standard and supplementary mammographic projections, the C arm assembly must be capable of being located at multiple positions within a 180 degrees rotation. Greater degrees of rotation are not required. 8. The heat dissipation capability should be adequate to accommodate the anticipated work-load in terms of number of patients and patient scheduling. A mammographic unit with an anode heat capacity of 90,000 heat units or more should be adequate for most practices. A mammography unit with a heat capacity of 20,000 heat units or less may require waiting time between exposures or studies in a high-volume mammography practice. 9.

Likewise, screen-film combinations designed for mammography are capable of providing images with appropriate contrast, resolution, and noise levels. Proper film processing is most important in order to obtain the appropriate film speed and contrast. A higher-speed screen-film combination designed for mammography can provide mammograms with significantly lower radiation dose, especially for grid and magnification techniques. Designing x-ray units and techniques as well as screen-film combinations with the singular goal of reducing radiation dose will always involve compromises and trade-offs. The key is to always consider optimizing all of the factors that affect image quality: (1) appropriate beam quality, (2) breast compression, (3) consideration of the use of grids, (4) good geometry, (5) selection of an appropriate screen-film combination, and (6) proper film processing. Optimization of all appropriate imaging factors will produce high-quality mammograms at the lowest radiation dose to the patient.\r"

  ".U": "87318572\r", 
  ".W": "There are few forms of cancer that can be effectively controlled. Now that there is sufficient evidence demonstrating that mortality from breast cancer can be reduced with the help of mammography screening, we are faced with the challenge of applying this method on a large scale. What are the major practical problems? The medical profession and decision makers must be made familiar with nature of the recent achievements and with their practical implications. The personnel who will be responsible for undertaking screening have to be adequately trained before screening gets under way. Women should understand the benefits that they can gain from mammography screening so that they will be sufficiently motivated to attend. This can be achieved by sincere, periodic information through the mass media. It is important that every woman eligible for screening understand that her risk of dying from breast cancer will be half as much if she participates in screening as it would be if she fails to participate. She should also be aware that the smaller cancers detected at screening can often be removed by breast conserving surgery without the need for mastectomy. Because mammography does not prevent breast cancer, women must be aware of the fact that mammography has to be repeated at regular intervals if the benefits of screening are to be maintained. Additionally, breast self-examination should be practiced in the interval between screens. Finally, decision makers will have to realize that screening with mammography can, in the long run, lead to reduction of health service costs. It is obvious that the expenses involved in taking care of a patient with advanced breast carcinoma can be very high. As it has been clearly demonstrated that properly performed screening will significantly decrease the number of advanced, costly breast carcinomas, a large proportion of these expenses will be saved in the population invited to screening. Because screening itself drains economic resources, the costs of screening outweigh the savings until the number of advanced cancers decreases; however, after this occurs the expenses of screening will be far less than the savings. The savings arise from the smaller number of advanced, costly cases. The results to date are convincing enough to justify recommending large-scale mammographic screening. The Swedish government has recommended screening with mammography for all women aged 40-74. This recommendation repeatedly emphasizes the necessity of high quality examinations interpreted by well-trained radiologists.\r"

The frequency and severity of RDS were assessed with use of a simple radiographic scoring system in which pulmonary parenchymal densities and the prominence of the air-bronchogram effect were used as indicators of widespread atelectasis. Radiographs were obtained in surfactant-treated and control infants within the first 90 minutes of life as part of an initial evaluation of their pulmonary status. Subsequent examinations were performed at less than 24 hours and less than 48 hours of age. Radiographic assessment of lung disease compared consistently with coordinated data on oxygen and mean airway pressure requirements of the infants. Both indicated a significantly decreased frequency and severity of RDS in the infants treated with surfactant. The results provide supporting evidence of the effectiveness of exogenous lung surfactant replacement in mitigating RDS in very premature infants.\r"

Correlation between pancreatic dimensions and patient age was as good as or better than that obtained with the other physical parameters. In general, the normal pancreas had a similar sized head and tail with a thinner body as compared with the abnormal pancreas, and an echogenicity that was equal to or slightly greater than that of the liver. Analysis of the images of 13 patients with pancreatitis showed that the presence of a dilated main pancreatic duct was the most useful feature in suggesting an abnormality.

The proximal portion of the main pancreatic duct alone was delineated in three cases because of reflux of contrast material as a result of the presence of excessive mucin and a patulous orifice of the papilla of Vater (major duodenal papilla). Diffuse dilatation of the main pancreatic duct was demonstrated or suggested on computed tomographic (CT) and ultrasound scans. Four patients who underwent operations are alive and free from carcinoma (mean, 50 months after diagnosis). Whenever prominent, diffuse dilatation of the main pancreatic duct is encountered on CT or ultrasound scans, endoscopic retrograde pancreatography is mandatory to permit confirmation or ruling out of mucin-hypersecreting carcinoma of the pancreas.\r"

The periportal collar as a sign of rejection has a sensitivity of 1.0, a specificity of 0.86, a negative predictive value of 1.0, and a positive predictive value of 0.62. This sign corresponds histopathologically with the lymphocytic portal infiltration that occurs during acute liver transplant rejection. Though viral hepatitis and nonspecific portal triad edema can also result in a periportal collar, acute liver rejection is strongly suggested when this sign is seen after liver transplantation. Early diagnosis and confirmation of rejection permit faster and more appropriate clinical intervention.\r"

Due to the introduction of infusion hepatic angiography, computed tomography (CT) after Lipiodol (iodized oil) infusion, and intraoperative ultrasound (US), tumors less than 10 mm in diameter are now frequently found. We compared the diagnostic accuracy of these three modalities in the detection of nodules in 45 patients who had hepatocellular carcinoma (confirmed by biopsy). CT with Lipiodol was superior to hepatic angiography in demonstrating nodules when they were overlapped by the primary tumor or very small in size. Intraoperative US demonstrated nodules in four avascular or hypovascular hepatocellular carcinomas, which both hepatic angiography and CT failed to demonstrate. In cases associated with severe liver cirrhosis, differentiation of small nodules from regenerating cirrhotic nodules was sometimes difficult with intraoperative US. The combined use of these three modalities is indispensable for the accurate detection of small nodules of metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma.\r"

In the 32 intrauterine pregnancies (normal and abnormal), the correct diagnosis was made in all cases with endovaginal US. The endovaginal images demonstrated the intrauterine embryo, its heart motion, and the yolk sac more clearly and more often when these structures were not apparent on the transabdominal scans. Abnormal gestational sacs were better resolved. In the six cases of ectopic pregnancy, while an extrauterine ectopic sac was visualized in only three, absence of an intrauterine gestational sac was confirmed in all cases with endovaginal scanning.

The most common adverse effect was bleeding necessitating transfusion (57%). Infection occurred in 27% of patients and may be intrinsic to removal of these infected stones. There was one death in the study group: a patient with multiple medical problems died of myocardial infarction. Successful stone extraction requires a clear understanding of renal anatomic features, properly placed access routes, and radiologic-urologic expertise.

  ".U": "87318645\r", 
  ".W": "Infarct expansion and infarct extension are events early in the course of myocardial infarction with serious short- and long-term consequences. Infarct expansion, disproportionate thinning, and dilatation of the infarct segment probably begin within hours of acute infarction and usually reach peak extent within seven to 14 days. Clinical data suggest that infarct expansion occurs in approximately 35% to 45% of anterior transmural myocardial infarctions and to a lesser extent in infarctions at other sites. Although expansion usually develops in large infarcts, the extent of transmural necrosis rather than absolute infarct size predicts its occurrence. Expansion has an adverse effect on infarct structure and function for several reasons. Functional infarct size is increased because of infarct segment lengthening, and expansion results in over-all ventricular dilatation. Thus, patients with expansion of an infarct have poorer exercise tolerance, more congestive heart failure symptoms, and greater early and late mortality than those without expansion. Infarct rupture and late aneurysm formation are two additional structural consequences of infarct expansion. Experimental and clinical data suggest that the incidence and severity of expansion can be modified by interventions. Increased ventricular loading conditions and steroidal and nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agents make expansion more severe. Reperfusion of the infarct segment and pharmacologic interventions that decrease ventricular afterload lessen the severity of expansion. Previous myocardial infarction and preexisting ventricular hypertrophy may also limit the development of infarct expansion. Infarct extension is defined clinically as early in-hospital reinfarction after a myocardial infarction. The pathologic finding of infarct extension is necrotic and healing myocardium of several different recent ages within the same vascular territory. Although this pathologic criterion usually cannot be verified, studies employing invasive and noninvasive assessment of patients with early reinfarction provide evidence that the new myocardial injury is usually in the same vascular risk region as the original infarction. A variety of different criteria have been applied in the clinical diagnosis of infarct extension, and this has resulted in a large range of estimated frequencies from under 10% to as high as 86%. High estimates are found in studies using one or two nonspecific criteria such as ST segment shift or reelevation of total CK. The lowest rates have been found when combinations of criteria are used.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The transition from haploid to diploid in homothallic yeast involves a defined sequence of events which are regulated at the level of transcription. Transcription factors encoded by SWI genes activate the HO endonuclease gene at a precise stage in the cell cycle of mother cells. The HO endonuclease initiates a transposition event which activates genes of the opposite mating type by causing them to move away from a silencer element. The activated mating type genes then regulate genes involved in cell signaling such as the mating type-specific pheromones and their receptors. Since HO is only activated in one of the sister cells after division (the mother), adjacent cells of opposite mating type are generated which respond to each others' secreted pheromones by inducing genes involved in conjugation. This leads to the formation of a diploid in which many of the genes involved in mating and mating-type switching become repressed due to the heterozygosity of the mating-type locus. This article summarizes what is known about these transcriptional controls and discusses possible parallels in higher eukaryotes.\r"

  ".W": "Arachidonic acid is released from membrane phospholipids upon cell stimulation (for example, by immune complexes and calcium ionophores) and converted to leukotrienes by a 5-lipoxygenase that also has leukotriene A4 synthetase activity. Leukotriene A4, an unstable epoxide, is hydrolyzed to leukotriene B4 or conjugated with glutathione to yield leukotriene C4 and its metabolites, leukotriene D4 and leukotriene E4. The leukotrienes participate in host defense reactions and pathophysiological conditions such as immediate hypersensitivity and inflammation. Recent studies also suggest a neuroendocrine role for leukotriene C4 in luteinizing hormone secretion. Lipoxins are formed by the action of 5- and 15-lipoxygenases on arachidonic acid. Lipoxin A causes contraction of guinea pig lung strips and dilation of the microvasculature. Both lipoxin A and B inhibit natural killer cell cytotoxicity. Thus, the multiple interaction of lipoxygenases generates compounds that can regulate specific cellular responses of importance in inflammation and immunity.\r"

  ".W": "The tryptophan gene (trp) repressor of Escherichia coli has been converted into a site-specific nuclease by covalently attaching it to the 1,10-phenanthroline-copper complex. In its cuprous form, the coordination complex with hydrogen peroxide as a coreactant cleaves DNA by oxidatively attacking the deoxyribose moiety. The chemistry for the attachment of 1,10-phenanthroline to the trp repressor involves modification of lysyl residues with iminothiolane followed by alkylation of the resulting sulfhydryl groups with 5-iodoacetamido-1,10-phenanthroline. The modified trp repressor cleaves the operators of aroH and trpEDCBA upon the addition of cupric ion and thiol in a reaction dependent on the corepressor L-tryptophan. Scission was restricted to the binding site for the repressor, defined by deoxyribonuclease I footprinting. Since DNA-binding proteins have recognition sequences approximately 20 base pairs long, the nucleolytic activities derived from them could be used to isolate long DNA fragments for sequencing or chromosomal mapping.\r"

  ".W": "Tumor necrosis factor, or cachectin (TNF-alpha), a protein with a wide range of biological activities, is produced mainly by macrophages and may be important in inflammatory processes. The role of TNF-alpha in the pathogenesis of cerebral malaria was investigated in a murine model. Most CBA mice infected with Plasmodium berghei anka die between days 6 and 14 with acute neurological manifestations unrelated to the level of parasitemia, whereas mice of some other strains have malaria of the same severity that ends in death after 3 to 4 weeks without neurological manifestations. The activity of serum TNF-alpha was considerably increased in CBA/Ca mice with cerebral malaria but not in Plasmodium berghei-infected mice that did not develop this complication. One injection of rabbit antibody to TNF-alpha on day 4 or 7 fully protected infected mice from cerebral malaria without modifying the parasitemia, whereas immunoglobulins from normal rabbit had no effect. In mice with cerebral malaria, the cerebral vessels showed focal accumulations of packed macrophages often containing infected erythrocytes; this lesion was not seen in mice treated with antibody to TNF-alpha or in untreated mice without cerebral malaria. These findings indicate that TNF-alpha has an important role in the pathogenesis of cerebral malaria in this murine model and suggest that local accumulation and activation of macrophages may lead to the predominance of lesions in the central nervous system.\r"

In contrast, the 3 beta-hydroxy-delta 5-derivatives of cholesterol, pregnenolone and dehydroepiandrosterone, accumulate in the rat brain through mechanisms independent of peripheral sources. Immunohistochemical studies have been performed with specific antibodies to bovine adrenal cytochrome P-450scc, which is involved in cholesterol side-chain cleavage and pregnenolone formation. The enzyme was localized in the white matter throughout the brain. Scarce clusters of cell bodies were also stained in the entorhinal and cingulate cortex and in the olfactory bulb. These observations strongly support the existence of \"neurosteroids,\" which have been posited on the basis of biochemical, physiological, and behavioral studies.\r"

Efforts are now focusing on the physiological substrates for the receptor kinase. Experience to date suggests that they will be rare proteins whose phosphorylation in intact cells may be transient. The advantages of attempting to dissect the initial biochemical pathway of insulin action include the wealth of information about the metabolic consequences of insulin action and the potential for genetic analysis in Drosophila and in man.\r"
