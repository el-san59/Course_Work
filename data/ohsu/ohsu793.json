Patients with one or two clinic visits honored 39 of 52 (75%) of their phone appointments, whereas those with 11 or more visits kept only 8 of 17 (47%). Telephone appointments scheduled directly in the clinic were kept on 66 of 98 (67%) occasions as compared to 14 of 28 (50%) for those made over the phone. Sixty-four of 93 (69%) calls were made when the interval from the time the phone appointments were given to date of appointment was 7 days or less, while 16 of 33 (48%) responded when this period was 8 days or longer. The data document the compliance of adolescent girls with telephone appointments and suggest that this technique may be a useful adjunct for monitoring patients requiring close medical follow-up.\r"

Temper tantrums were found to be most common at 3-5 years (75.3%), less common at 6-8 years (20.8%), and least common at 9-12 years (3.9%). Children aged 3-5 years were more likely to be of a lower social class (p less than 0.01), whereas in other age groups (6-8 years and 9-12 years) children were more likely to be of an upper social class. Boys dominated the study significantly: the ratio of boys to girls was 3.1:1. Boys having temper tantrums were more likely to be of an upper social class (p less than 0.001) compared with girls, who tended to be of a lower social class (p less than .01). Children showed a higher incidence of history of postnatal trauma and seizure disorder compared with the control group (p less than 0.05). Parental overprotection and marital discord were found to be stress factors in a significantly higher number of boys than girls (p less than 0.01); parental negligence was a significant stress factor for girls (p less than 0.01). Associated behavioral problems, such as thumb sucking, enuresis, tics, head banging, sleep disturbances, and hyperkinesis were found to be significantly higher among children with tantrums.\r"

According to the poison center protocol, ingestions of 20-40 mg/kg of elemental iron required only home treatment, and ingestions of greater than or equal to 40 mg/kg required hospital referral. Gastrointestinal symptoms developed in 23% of patients. There were no seriously ill patients. No serious toxicity developed in patients ingesting 40-60 mg/kg. In 199 cases in which the dose ingested was known, the mean dose was 39.5 mg/kg. The peak measured serum iron levels ranged from 12 to 539 micrograms/dl. In 129 cases with serum iron levels reported, increasing serum iron levels were associated with vomiting (p = 0.006). Of 88 patients who received deferoxamine, 14 had urine color change. Urine color change was associated with symptoms (p = 0.005) but not with iron dose or peak serum iron level. The poison center protocol was changed to home management for ingestions of 20-60 mg/kg unless significant symptoms developed and hospital referral for ingestions greater than or equal to 60 mg/kg.\r"

Ultrasound examination showed hypoechoic foci throughout the liver. These foci were confirmed by CT scan, which showed multiple well-marginated lesions of decreased attenuation and variable size throughout the right and left lobes of the liver. A liver biopsy specimen showed large nodules that were yellow and gritty in texture. Microscopic examination of biopsy specimens of these nodules showed extensive areas of necrotizing granulomatous inflammation with palisading histiocytes and occasional giant cells surrounded by necrotic foci. There was an associated fibroinflammatory infiltrate. The patient was treated with a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agent with prompt cessation of fever. A repeat CT examination of the liver after 14 months of treatment showed only mild hepatomegaly and a normal liver parenchyma. The focal lesions had disappeared. This is a case of hepatic granulomata in a child showing features of necrotizing inflammation.\r"

The incidence can be reduced by using a spinal needle no larger than 22 gauge to minimize the size of the dural puncture and subsequent leak of CSF. When a post-lumbar puncture headache occurs, conservative treatment with bedrest, hydration, analgesics, and psychologic support is usually all that is required. When a post-lumbar puncture headache lasts more than 1 week and other diagnoses have been excluded, an epidural blood patch performed by an experienced physician usually provides prompt and complete relief of symptoms with minimal risk.\r"

We investigated the possibility that anesthesia changes the physical properties of RM in such a way as to depress ciliary transport. We collected 33 samples of RM from the endotracheal tubes (ETTs) of 25 people aged 1 to 79 years undergoing elective surgery who had no clinical evidence of lung disease. We measured the rigidity, viscoelasticity, spinnability, and the percentage of solid composition of these specimens as well as the transport of the collected RM across the mucus-depleted frog palate. These physical properties were not significantly different from RM collected from awake volunteers using the bronchoscopy brush collection technique. Differences in spinnability, transportability, and solid content of paired mucus samples from the inside and outside of the ETTs are suggestive of altered RM hydration, but this requires further study. The decrease in MTR during general anesthesia is probably due to mechanisms other than alterations in the physical properties of mucus.\r"

  ".U": "90298646\r", 
  ".W": "From a cohort of 286 patients referred to an Occupational Medicine Clinic because of exposure to asbestos and/or silica, we identified 53 patients with a reduced diffusing capacity (Dco) (less than 75 percent predicted) as their only abnormality. Specifically, their clinical evaluation, chest roentgenograms, and remaining pulmonary function test results were all normal. These patients were divided into non-smokers (n = 13) and smokers (n = 40). The significance of the isolated reduction in diffusing capacity in these patients (n = 53) was explored with graded exercise testing (n = 19) and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) (n = 50). The results obtained from the patients with reduced diffusion were compared with those obtained from comparable smoking (n = 35) and nonsmoking patients (n = 37) in the original cohort who had normal chest roentgenograms and normal results of pulmonary function studies, including normal Dco values (greater than or equal to 75 percent of predicted value). Patients with low diffusion demonstrated a tendency for elevated alveolar to arterial O2 differences both at rest and during exercise, and a significant reduction in exercise capacity (VO2 max) was observed in the smoking patients with reduced diffusion when compared with their smoking counterparts with normal diffusion. All other exercise testing indexes were normal in the study groups and there was no correlation between the percent predicted Dco value and any of the exercise variables. In contrast, BAL revealed significant differences between patient groups. Both the smoking and nonsmoking patient groups with low Dco values had greater numbers of total BAL cells, alveolar macrophages, neutrophils, lymphocytes, and eosinophils in their BAL fluid than did their comparable controls with normal diffusion values. These differences were statistically significant (p less than .05) for total BAL cells and total macrophages in the nonsmoking patients and for total BAL cells, total macrophages, and total lymphocytes in the smoking patients expressed as either the total cell number per BAL or total cells per milliliter of BAL. In contrast to the observed exercise testing results, there was significant and inverse correlation between Dco values and each BAL cell type for all four groups combined as well as nonsmokers alone. The Dco values from smokers were significantly and inversely correlated with total BAL cells and total macrophages. These results suggest that the finding of a reduced Dco may be related to an active inflammatory process in the lung caused by occupational dust exposure.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

Asbestos-induced activation of lung interstitial cells may result in enhanced expression of procoagulant activity which contributes to the inflammatory response resulting in subsequent fibrin deposition. The current study examines procoagulant activity in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from patients with clinically diagnosed asbestosis, patients with asbestos exposure without asbestosis, and normal, control subjects. Results indicated that asbestos exposure resulted in increased lung procoagulant expression in vivo, and furthermore, suggested that both endothelial cells and alveolar macrophages represented lung parenchymal cells which may contribute to this activity. This imbalance in coagulation homeostasis may be important in the regulation of fibrotic responses observed in asbestosis.\r"

In eight additional patients with right coronary artery disease, directionally similar changes in right ventricular volume were seen.

Patients who were receiving preload and significant afterload reduction showed an immediate drop in PCWP which was sustained. This trend is independent of underlying pathology or dose of furosemide used. It is postulated that furosemide causes an early deleterious release of endogenous vasoconstrictors which may be blocked by combined preload and afterload reduction.\r"

We hypothesize some post-polio symptoms may be due to breathing disorders occurring during sleep. We performed polysomnography on 13 post-polio patients: group 1 (five patients) were those already on ventilatory assistance (rocking beds) and group 2 (eight patients), those without any assistance. Patients requiring new treatment were then evaluated on nasal CPAP or nasal mask ventilation. Group 1 patients, on rocking beds, demonstrated consistently poor sleep quality with decreased total sleep time, sleep efficiency, percentage stage 2, slow wave sleep, rapid eye movement sleep and an increase in the number of arousals and percentage stage 1 sleep. Respiratory abnormalities were also present and in all cases caused significant O2 desaturation. These patients did not respond to CPAP with the rocking bed. Repeat night-time polysomnography on nasal mask ventilation demonstrated an improvement in sleep structure and gas exchange. Three group 2 patients, (group 2a) had sleep within normal limits. The five remaining (group 2b) had poor sleep quality that was similar to but not as disrupted as group 1 patients. All but one patient demonstrated obstructive or mixed apnea and were treated effectively with nasal CPAP. One patient required nasal mask ventilation (due to mixed apnea and marked hypoventilation) to which there was a dramatic response. These patients demonstrated improved sleep quality and an improvement in daytime symptomatology. Sleep studies should be performed on post-polio patients with excessive daytime sleepiness and respiratory complaints. Those with obstructive and mixed apnea can often be treated with nasal CPAP. Those with hypoventilation syndrome and sleep apnea attributable to sleepiness and respiratory complaints. Those with obstructive and mixed apnea can often be treated with nasal CPAP. Those with hypoventilation syndrome and sleep apnea attributable to respiratory muscle weakness can be treated with nasal mask ventilation. Individuals already on respiratory assistance such as rocking beds who have features of respiratory failure can also be treated effectively with long-term nasal mechanical ventilation.\r"

Preoperatively, all subjects had pulmonary hypertension and were hypoxemic or had an elevated P(A-a)O2. The VA/Q distribution was widened with an elevated VD/VT and a low cardiac index. After thromboendarterectomy, significant improvement had occurred. The VA/Q distribution had narrowed to near normal, and the cardiac index increased.

  ".W": "Whether fluid accumulating in the pleural space is a transudate or an exudate is determined by the widely used criteria of the pleural fluid to serum LDH and protein concentration ratios. Such a distinction is important for limiting the extent of the differential diagnosis of possible causes for this condition. We have found that a pleural fluid to serum total bilirubin ratio can serve the same purpose. The correlation of a bilirubin concentration ratio of 0.6 or more with the presence of an exudate as determined by established criteria is statistically highly significant; and its sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive accuracy, and overall accuracy in relation to etiology and LDH or protein criteria (Light's criteria) are about 90 percent. Hence, the bilirubin criterion is statistically equivalent to the widely accepted LDH and protein criteria.\r"

We measured chest dimensions, spirometry, lung volumes, maximal expiratory flow volume curves, nasal and airways resistance, closing volume, maximal inspiratory/expiratory pressures, and tracheal area by acoustic reflection in 12 healthy subjects with achondroplasia. Anterior-posterior thoracic diameter was mildly reduced in men. Vital capacity for all subjects was 108 percent +/- 18.6 percent (SD) of that predicted for achondroplastic subjects, but was reduced when compared with values for people of average stature that were predicted, based on either sitting height or thoracic height. The reduction was relatively greater in male than in female subjects. The RV/TLC and FRC/TLC ratios were normal. Other measurements were similar to those in average-statured adults. We conclude that achondroplasia results in a reduction in vital capacity out of proportion to what would be expected if these subjects had normal limb size. Although the lungs may be small, they are functionally normal, as are the airways.\r"

Although one patient was treated with interleukin-2 for a presumed solitary pulmonary metastasis from renal carcinoma, in all three patients, both the kidney and lung tumors were eventually removed either concurrently or sequentially. Prior autopsy case series are reviewed. In the elderly, synchronous asymptomatic pulmonary and renal malignancy is not surprising, and it should be approached as a distinct clinical problem. With the use of chest roentgenography for screening high risk populations and CT for staging, simultaneous primary pulmonary and renal malignancy will probably be recognized increasingly.\r"

Comparison of SXT patients with the NXT group disclosed no risk factors for this occurrence. The proportion of patient-hours was similar when both groups were examined for tube size, tube site, ventilation mode and ventilator type. The mean hours of intubation was lower in the SXT group. Sixty-nine percent of unplanned extubations were deliberate; the majority of these occurred despite use of sedation and restraints. No death resulted from these events. The complication (and reintubation) rate in the SXT group was 31 percent. The reintubation rate in deliberate extubations was 11 percent. Self-extubation is a common occurrence which, despite obvious hazards, often is tolerated well by adults.\r"

Para-aminohippurate extraction coefficients were decreased, supporting the need for renal vein sampling to determine CPAH in sepsis. Thermodilution and CPAH methods correlated strongly, confirming the reliability of this thermodilution method. Renal vascular resistance, an indicator of renal vascular function, remained unchanged throughout the bouts of sepsis. The fraction of total body arterial blood flow going to the kidneys rose significantly during recovery from sepsis. Glomerular filtration rate, which was reduced in four of seven septic patients, correlated with the fraction of total blood flow going to the kidneys. These results suggest that renal vascular abnormalities may be occurring during septic shock. Our study demonstrates that sepsis-induced renal dysfunction may occur despite normal ranges of total renal blood flow during shock.\r"

Three patients presented with a history suggestive of multiorgan disease and a pleural biopsy performed despite a transudative effusion demonstrated amyloid infiltration of the pleura, obviating the need for other organ biopsies. We conclude that in patients with pleural effusions, if history suggests multiorgan involvement and there is suspicion for amyloidosis, then a closed pleural biopsy with special stains for amyloid should be performed even if the effusions are transudative. This may be the diagnostic procedure of choice in such patients.\r"

Data were collected before, during, and after intubation. Intubation in normal rabbits precipitated no untoward effects on gas exchange or respiratory phase timing. However, there was significant elevation of subglottic pressure during expiration following extubation. Central venous injection of oleic acid (0.08 ml/kg) induced an acute lung injury that after 24 h was characterized by reduced PaO2 and dynamic lung-thorax compliance and tachypnea. Intubation in animals with acute lung injury was associated with a significant decline in arterial oxygenation, tachypnea, and increased PCO2. Expiratory tracheal pressure and expiratory time were greater and PaCO2 and respiratory rate were lower following extubation. We conclude that translaryngeal intubation following acute lung injury exacerbates already compromised pulmonary function by preventing a compensatory expiratory braking maneuver by the glottic apparatus.\r"

At less than 40 bpm, the point where HFJV is no longer considered to be high frequency, PCV is substituted which then becomes the mode of choice because of the ability to control ventilating pressures by setting the PIP.

In 82 consecutive human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive patients suspected of having PCP, we passed a 14-F catheter into the trachea under local anesthesia without intubation, instilled saline solution, and then collected the secretions by aspiration. Bronchoscopy with collection of bronchial washings and performance of bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was then performed and the results were compared. The catheter results were identical with the results of BAL in 77 of 82 patients. This inexpensive technique may provide a reasonable early step in the diagnosis of PCP.\r"

We describe six consecutive HIV-infected patients at San Francisco General Hospital in whom influenza virus was isolated from induced sputum or bronchoalveolar lavage specimens between December 1988 and March 1989. Although neither clinical presentation of influenza nor rate of secondary complications appeared to be altered from that in healthy individuals, our power of comparison was limited by small sample size. However, a high prevalence of hypoxemia and a trend toward prolonged duration of illness were identified. Larger, controlled studies are needed to define the course of influenza virus infection in HIV-infected patients as compared with nonimmunosuppressed patients.\r"

The mean duration of corticosteroid therapy was 5.4 days and the mean total dose was 660 mg of methylprednisolone. Cryptococcus neoformans and Listeria monocytogenes infection each occurred once within one month of therapy in corticosteroid-treated patients; no other noteworthy acute corticosteroid toxicity was noted. Since all patients with imminently lethal PCP received corticosteroids, we could not assess the effect of these agents on acute mortality. After six months the rates of new AIDS-related diagnoses and of post-hospitalization mortality were equivalent in the two groups. We also have critically reviewed the available literature regarding this use of corticosteroids.\r"

The technique was equally applicable to central and peripheral lung aspirates and to all types of primary and metastatic pulmonary neoplasms. The use of rapid on-site evaluation significantly improves the diagnostic yield of transbronchial aspirates.\r"

Similar relationships were seen in the both cities using the same methods of analysis. The rate of FEV1 decline and its final level were related to the prior presence of attacks of breathlessness or to a syndrome that also included wheezing and diagnosed asthma. Initial FEV1 level was lower in subjects with dyspnea appearing during the follow-up than in the never-symptom group. These relationships were independent of smoking habits. The consistencies in the parallel analyses strengthen the relationships observed. In Tucson, Ariz, the FEV1 decline in smokers with persistent chronic cough was greater than that due to separate effects of the symptom and smoking. This suggests that chronic cough may be an indicator of an increased effect of tobacco smoke on pulmonary function.\r"

Smoking habits are associated with changes in the number and the activation state of immune and inflammatory alveolar cells. Cigarette smoke could interact with the course of this disease. To evaluate the effects of smoking on IPF, 11 smokers and 16 nonsmokers were compared. Clinical presentation, PFTs, BAL cell populations, short-term glucocorticoid responsiveness and survival were evaluated. Similar PFT results were observed in both groups. Lymphocyte cells were higher in nonsmokers than in smokers. Glucocorticoid responsiveness was mainly observed in nonsmokers. Nonsmoking status was not associated with survival advantage. We conclude that the subset of IPF characterized by an aggressive onset, a BAL fluid high lymphocyte count and a substantial PFT improvement after therapy began, occurs predominantly in the absence of cigarette smoking habits.\r"

Forced expiratory indices were measured (FEV1; PEF; MEF50%), as well as indices obtained during quiet breathing (Raw; Gaw; Gaw/VL). The three groups were comparable as far as PEF was concerned (about 60 +/- 20 percent of predicted, yet the group with UAO showed significantly larger FEV1 (84 percent of predicted vs 55 percent and 57 percent of predicted in asthma and emphysema respectively), and larger MEF50% (71 percent of predicted vs 25 percent and 23 percent of predicted in the other groups), and the group with asthma had the largest Raw (0.37 +/- 0.18 kPa.s.L-1 vs 0.24 +/- 0.13 in UAO and 0.22 +/- 0.10 in emphysema). From these functional tests, several ratios were derived which were discriminative among the three groups. Upper airway obstruction could be recognized by a significantly lower PEF/MEF50% ratio and higher FEV1/PEF ratio than in the other conditions. Furthermore, a distinction between asthma and emphysema could be made by comparing airway patency during forced and quiet breathing, ie, the MEF50%/Gaw ratio. This ratio was, in fact, significantly different for all three groups, having the lowest value in emphysema (0.19 +/- 0.08 kPa vs 0.44 +/- 0.23 kPa and 0.63 +/- 0.34 kPa in asthma and UAO, respectively). Within the group with UAO, those with variable intrathoracic obstruction showed the least difference from asthma and emphysema for the measured indices.\r"

Seventeen male patients with moderately severe OSA and 13 normal subjects underwent CT of the UA in the supine position while awake. Axial views were obtained from the level of the hard palate to the hypopharynx under conditions of -5, 0, and +10 cm H2O of CAP. The results indicated that the Amin occurred within 20 mm of the hard palate in the retropalatal region of the UA in 16 (94 percent) of the 17 patients and in 12 (92 percent) of the 13 normal subjects. Continuous negative airway pressure of -5 cm H2O failed to significantly decrease either Amin or Amean in either the patients or normal subjects, suggesting good UA load compensation during wakefulness. Continuous positive airway pressure of 10 cm H2O significantly increased Amin and Amean to a similar extent in both groups. The Amin was significantly smaller by 40 percent, 33 percent, and 37 percent in the patients with OSA, compared to the normal subjects, at -5, 0, and +10 cm H2O of CAP, respectively. In contrast, Amean did not differ between the groups. The CT scan criterion of Amin less than or greater than 1.0 cm2 during tidal ventilation of atmospheric pressure correctly categorized patients with OSA and normal subjects with an accuracy of 70 percent. While the behavior of the UA in response to nasal CPAP and CNAP failed to increase the accuracy of CT scan criteria to a level sufficient for clinical use in the diagnosis of OSA, the results clearly indicate that structural changes in the UA contribute to the development of OSA.\r"

The R-R interval and TTOT changes during TAS were compared to the preceding 60-second mean R-R interval and TTOT in each infant and expressed as a percentage of mean control values (ie, % RR and % TTOT). During TAS, there was a significant negative correlation between cardiac and respiratory responses and postconceptional age (p less than 0.001 and p less than 0.0001, respectively). Prolongation of both the R-R interval and the TTOT elicited by TAS was significantly blunted by maturation.\r"

Between July 1985 and January 1989, ten patients underwent 13 courses of PDT for relief of endobronchial tumor obstruction due to endstage primary non-small lung cancer. Initial biopsy specimens demonstrated squamous carcinoma in eight patients and adenocarcinoma in two. At the time of treatment, all patients were considered surgically unresectable: T4N2M1(one), T4N2M0(one), T3N3M1(two), T3N2M0(five), and T2N1M0(one). This latter patient had exclusionary medical conditions. The average Karnofsky status was 75 (worst was 60, best was 90). Obstruction was mainstem for six, bronchus intermedius in one, and left upper lobe in three. The average obstruction was 86 +/- 2 percent. Following treatment, the average obstruction was 57 +/- 3 percent. Responses were greater than 50 percent reduction in four and less than 50 percent in six. Half of the patients still had more than 70 percent obstruction following PDT. However, all patients had a decrease in symptoms, especially coughing. Six of ten patients subsequently received external beam radiation. Three of these patients developed significant problems during and following radiation. Side effects of HPD were minimal and included burns in two and mild anasarca in one patient. PDT appears to offer palliation of obstructive symptoms in patients with late stage lung cancer. Since life span is so short in these individuals, physicians must weigh carefully the potential side effects of combination therapy.\r"

Stomal variceal bleeding occurred between 1 and 11 years (median, 5.5 years) after creation of the stoma. Control of bleeding initially consisted of direct pressure; recurrent bleeding occurred in one patient who died before definitive therapy could be performed. The remaining 11 patients underwent a total of 18 additional procedures for control of bleeding stomal varices, including 9 local procedures, 8 portosystemic shunts, and 1 liver transplantation. Seven patients were dead of hepatic failure a median of 4 years (range, 1 to 9 years) after treatment. Recurrent bleeding occurred in three patients after local treatment and in one patient after a portosystemic shunt. Bleeding stomal varices are a manifestation of severe liver disease and portal hypertension. Although local procedures may be effective for initial control of bleeding, recurrent bleeding often occurs. Mortality is high because of the severity of the underlying liver disease.\r"

There was a significant (chi-square = 8.7, P less than 0.01) increase in prevalence of constipation from 30 percent before to 51 percent after surgery. There were two explanations for this increased constipation. It was mainly the result of a 28 percent increase in prevalence of constipation among patients who were incontinent before rectopexy. Incontinent prolapse patients were more likely to acquire a predictable bowel habit after rectopexy if they became constipated. There was also a small (7 percent) increase in prevalence of constipation among continent patients, which could be attributed to the rectopexy procedure. In a subgroup of 15 patients, rectal wall thickness after rectopexy was assessed by pelvic computed tomographic scan carried out before and after surgery, or at more than one year after surgery. There was a significant (t = 4.5, P less than 0.001) increase in rectal wall thickness by 24 weeks after rectopexy, compared with before operation. This increase was also seen in a further five patients undergoing abdominal rectopexy without Ivalon sponge, suggesting that it was a consequence of rectal mobilization rather than the Ivalon sponge. This increased rectal wall thickness may impede the passage of formed stool into the lower rectum and contribute to the increased constipation found after rectopexy.\r"

This investigation further characterizes the mucosal surface microflora and assesses the effects of common preoperative bowel preparations on both microflora. Quantitative and qualitative bacterial cultures and scanning electron microscopy were used to study the microflora in five groups of seven rats each: control; intraoperative colonic instillation of ten percent povidone-iodine for 20 minutes; mechanical preparation with magnesium citrate; mechanical preparation followed by intramuscular cefoxitin (30 milligrams per kilogram) one hour preoperatively; and mechanical preparation followed by oral neomycin sulfate and erythromycin base (15 milligrams/kilogram each) given by gavage tube 18, 14, and 4 hours preoperatively. Microflora on the mucosal surface was visualized by scanning electron microscopy in all groups except the neomycin/erythromycin group. Results showed fewer bacterial isolates recovered from the mucosal surface compared with the lumen, as well as several log10 units lower for each bacterial classification. The greatest suppression of both microflora was seen in the neomycin/erythromycin group. Total aerobic and anaerobic luminal counts decreased by 3.7 (P less than 0.009) and 6.3 (P less than 0.009) log10 units, while total aerobic and anaerobic wall counts decreased by 2.3 (P less than 0.009) and 2.8 (not significantly) log10 units, respectively. Lesser reductions were noted in the povidone-iodine group (P less than 0.009, P less than 0.009, P less than 0.009, and P less than 0.048, respectively). There were no statistically significant reductions in either total aerobic or anaerobic counts in the mechanical preparation or cefoxitin groups. These results indicate that neomycin/erythromycin is the most effective regimen in reducing both microflora.\r"

The neorectum was constructed by bringing colon down into the pelvis and anastomosing it to the perineal skin. The neoanal sphincter was fashioned from a transposed gracilis muscle and was activated electrically by a totally implanted stimulator. A period of chronic low-frequency stimulation altered the muscle characteristics and enabled the neosphincter to contract continually without fatigue. The patient was continent when the stimulator was turned on and was able to void when the stimulator was turned off.\r"

Results were compared between the two different pouch designs tested and a control group of 26 patients who had an intact rectum. There was no difference in emptying between the two pouch designs or compared with the control subjects. Emptying did not influence either the frequency of defecation or patient soiling rate. The presence of an anal stricture was associated with poor emptying in each case in the pouch group. Anorectal angle was no different between the different pouch designs or compared with the control group at rest, during pelvic floor contraction, or attempted defecation. A similar finding was obtained with anorectal angle position and movement during pelvic floor contraction and attempted defecation in both pouch design groups and when compared with normal rectum. This study shows that the only factor that is consistently associated with poor pouch emptying is the presence of an anal stricture.\r"

The 16 patients underwent elective surgery for their inflammatory bowel disease but were significantly protein depleted before surgery when their body composition was first measured. Twelve months later, all patients were in good health, back to work, and had normally functioning pouches (average stool frequency 4.3 +/- 1.4 per day). As a group, their stores of body protein and hydration state had returned to normal limits although their body fat stores were increased. Over the postoperative period there were significant losses of weight, protein, fat, fat-free mass, and total body water. These levels had returned to preoperative values (but not to normal) three months later. It is concluded that protein depleted patients with ulcerative colitis presenting for major surgery continue to have distorted body composition for several months after surgery but after approximately 12 months, when they have returned to work and feel well, body composition has returned to normal.\r"

Significant morbidity has been associated with both medical and surgical therapy. Although conventional therapy is acceptable in the management of simple fistulas in Crohn's disease, these approaches often exacerbate rather than ameliorate problems in patients with complex fistulas. The authors report ten cases of complex fistulas in patients with Crohn's disease managed with their technique of long-term, indwelling setons. These setons are placed through the fistula tract and tied loosely to maintain the patency of the fistula without cutting through the sphincters. At the time of insertion, although abscesses are incised and drained, no attempt is made to divide the superficial tissues or sphincter overlying the fistulous tract. The patients ranged in age from 23 to 81 years and had a history of Crohn's disease for 1 to 20 years. All cases resulted in excellent palliation. No patient required a proximal colostomy. These patient have been followed for four months to seven years. Despite severe proctitis in six of these patients at the initial operation, no patient has required a proctectomy. The authors believe this technique achieves adequate palliation and should be employed as the procedure of choice in patients with complex anal fistulas associated with Crohn's disease.\r"

The succinate dehydrogenase activity of tissue fragments was assayed after exposure at 43 degrees C (hyperthermia) for 20 hours, to radiation of 6 Gy, and to both heat (43 degrees C) and radiation (6 Gy). The sensitivity to each treatment was estimated by the percentage of succinate dehydrogenase activity of the treated cells compared with that of control cells. The mean plus or minus standard deviation of succinate dehydrogenase activity after exposure to radiation, heat, and both heat and radiation, was 84.7 +/- 12.6 percent, 52.9 +/- 20.7 percent, and 46.8 +/- 20.7 percent, respectively. The succinate dehydrogenase activities of heat-treated cells and both heat- and radiation-treated cells were significantly lower than that of the radiation-treated cells (P less than 0.01). The succinate dehydrogenase activities of heat plus radiation treated cells were the lowest in tissues from cancer lesions. Although the number was small, there was a correlation between this test and clinical outcome in seven of nine cases. Thus, preoperative therapy of hyperthermia plus radiotherapy is expected to be effective for treating patients with rectal cancer.\r"

Two patients were treated by seton fistulotomy and counter drainage with no recurrence. Therefore, nine additional patients underwent this procedure. Recurrent horseshoe abscess fistula occurred in 2 of 11 patients (18.1 percent). Seton fistulotomy with counter drainage has become the authors' operative procedure of choice for horseshoe abscess fistula. This method may prove more effective if the true primary abscess cavity is identified, the seton is removed appropriately, and postoperative care of the cavity is adequate.

In the last period (1982 to 1985) in cases of spillage of tumor cells, local recurrence was seen in 39 percent as opposed to 12.9 percent in perforation or incision of the tumor. Intraoperative tumor-cell spillage has a negative effect on survival rates, reducing the relative five-year survival rate after resection for cure from 70 to 44 percent. It should be recorded in the surgical and pathologic reports and considered in the analysis of treatment results and in selection of patients for adjuvant radiotherapy.\r"

These effects of PTH were dose-dependent and reversible. In contrast, CT increased alkaline phosphatase activity, 45Ca incorporation into insoluble material, and the calcium content by 1.4- to 1.8-fold.

  ".W": "Activators of protein kinase C, such as phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) and the synthetic diacylglycerol dioctanoylglycerol (diC8), either stimulate or inhibit PTH release depending on the extracellular Ca2+ concentration. By increasing PTH release at high extracellular Ca2+, these agents, in effect, block high Ca2(+)-induced inhibition of secretion. Since raising extracellular Ca2+ increases intracellular free Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i) and inositol trisphosphate (InsP3) formation in parathyroid cells, we assessed the effects of PMA pretreatment on [Ca2+]i and InsP3 to ascertain whether these second messengers might be altered by protein kinase C activation. Preincubation of parathyroid cells with PMA (10(-6) M) significantly lowered the intracellular Ca2+ response to raising extracellular Ca2+ from 0.5-2.0 mM. The peak increase in [Ca2+]i averaged 475 +/- 11 nM in PMA-treated cells compared to 703 +/- 44 nM in control cells. High extracellular Ca2(+)-induced InsP3 accumulation was also reduced after incubating the cells with PMA. To determine whether intracellular Ca2+ stores and/or transmembrane Ca2+ uptake were affected by activating protein kinase C, we examined intracellular Ca2+ responses to the Ca2+ ionophore ionomycin after PMA pretreatment. At 0.5 mM Ca2+, ionomycin (10(-6) M) increased [Ca2+]i to an initial peak of 738 +/- 49 nM followed by a sustained increase to 501 +/- 30 nM in control cells (n = 15). After exposure to PMA (greater than or equal to 20 min), however, peak and sustained increments in [Ca2+]i were significantly lower at 550 +/- 32 and 394 +/- 16 nM, respectively (P less than 0.02, n = 8). In the absence of extracellular Ca2+, basal [Ca2+]i was 197 +/- 5 and peaked at 323 +/- 15 nM with ionomycin (10(-6) M) in PMA-treated cells (n = 16). The latter value was significantly less than the peak increase in [Ca2+]i to 461 +/- 19 nM observed with ionomycin (10(-6) M) in control cells (P less than 0.001, n = 15). With respect to secretion, either of the protein kinase C agonists (i.e. PMA or diC8) or the Ca2+ ionophore ionomycin inhibited PTH release at 0.5 mM Ca2+. To determine whether the concomitant activation of protein kinase C- and Ca2(+)-dependent pathways could additively suppress PTH release, we assessed the effects of ionomycin and either PMA or diC8 on secretion. PTH release at 0.5 mM Ca2+ was reduced in an additive manner by either of these protein kinase C agonists plus ionomycin. At 2 mM Ca2+, protein kinase C agonists stimulated PTH release.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

Four monoclonal antibodies directed toward different epitopes on the beta-subunit (hTSH beta) inhibited completely the receptor binding of hTSH to FRTL-5 rat thyroid cells. In contrast, five monoclonal antibodies directed toward different epitopes on the alpha-subunit had little or no effect on the receptor binding. Furthermore, four of five alpha-subunit-specific antibodies and three of four hTSH-specific antibodies inhibited both hTSH-induced cAMP accumulation and thymidine uptake in FRTL-5 cells, in a dose-response manner. One hTSH (alpha-beta heterodimer)-specific antibody which did not recognize the free subunits also had the inhibitory effect on both the receptor binding and hTSH-induced cAMP accumulation. These results strongly suggest that hTSH beta is indispensable for recognizing the receptors on FRTL-5 cells and that the alpha-subunit is required for signal transduction in postreceptor step(s). In addition, it is also suggested that the highly conformational structure of hTSH is absolutely essential for the biological activity.\r"

Myometrial microsomes were incubated with 3H-IP3 alone and in the presence of unlabeled IP3. Binding was to a single class of noninteracting sites with a density of 1-2 pmol/mg of protein. The sites had characteristics of true IP3 receptors, i.e., very fast association and dissociation rates, high affinity (Kd 25-50 nM) and specificity (IP3 greater than IP3[2,4,5], IP4 much greater than IP5 greater than IP3[1,3,4], IP1, IP2, IP6), and did not metabolize 3H-IP3. The binding was maximal at pH 8, and was inhibited by calcium (IC50 = 80 nM), magnesium (IC50 = 100 microM), heparin (IC50 = 4.5 micrograms/ml), and GTP (IC50 = 150 microM). The concentration and affinity of IP3 receptors were similar in pregnant and nonpregnant myometrium and remained constant during labor. By contrast, the density of oxytocin receptor increased significantly from nonpregnant to pregnant tissue and fell in advanced spontaneous labor but not in advanced induced labor. These results provide new, additional evidence for the involvement of the phosphatidylinositol pathway in the control of uterine contractility.\r"

The physiological significance for the existence of subtypes of specific CT receptors is not clear. The [Gly8,Ala16]-des-Leu19-sCT suppressed the osteoclastic bone resorption in tissue culture at low concentration (0.1 nM). The dose of [Gly8,Ala16]-des-Leu19-sCT required for this hypocalcemic activity was highly correlated with the binding affinity of this analog to the CT-L receptor subtype. In addition, human CT interacted with the CT-L type receptor at about 100th the concentration of that required for the displacement of sCT. We conclude that binding to the CT-L type receptor is required for hypocalcemic activity in mammals.\r"

  ".W": "Calcium has been shown in vitro to serve as the first messenger for the rapid effect of thyroid hormone at the level of the plasma membrane. In the present study the physiological relevance of this mechanism is examined in the whole animal. To this end, the effect of T3 on 45calcium uptake and sugar [2-deoxyglucose (2-DG]) uptake, an effect that requires extracellular calcium, and the influence of calcium blockers thereon were measured in ventricles, atria, diaphragm, fat, and liver in the rat. In the first three tissues, T3 produced comparable changes in 45Ca uptake and 2-DG uptake (T3 increased 2-DG uptake in fat, where 45Ca uptake was undetected, and had no effect in liver); this activity was blocked by the calcium channel blocker cadmium. The effect of T3 on 45Ca uptake, like its effect on the in vivo uptake of 2-DG described previously, was biphasic and time related; at physiological doses of 0.01 and 0.1 micrograms/100 g BW, T3 increased 45Ca uptake, whereas at greater (pharmacological) doses of 1 and 100 micrograms/100 g BW, T3 was without effect or inhibited 45Ca uptake. In ventricles and atria, the stimulatory effect of T3 on 45Ca uptake was very rapid [within 2 min, at which time it was at or near maximum (50-90% above control] and then declined gradually and was not seen after 10-20 min. Of the several calcium blockers employed, verapamil (organic) and cadmium (inorganic) were found to be the most effective. Verapamil and cadmium produced a rapid, transient, and dose-related inhibition of 45Ca uptake in the tissues examined (except fat tissue where, under the experimental conditions employed, 45Ca uptake was undetected). Verapamil, given iv (200 micrograms/100 g BW) or ip (1 mg/100 g BW), reduced tissue 45Ca uptake by 50-90% within 2 or 10 min, respectively, and then its inhibitory effect diminished rapidly and was not seen after 20-30 min. Cadmium, given iv (was ineffective when given ip) produced a rapid and dose-related decrease in 45Ca uptake, being most effective (40-90% inhibition) 1-10 min after its administration. Cadmium (1 mg/100 g BW) injected into the tail vein 2 min before T3 produced a comparable inhibition of the stimulatory effect of T3 on 45Ca uptake and 2-DG uptake. Verapamil did not change the T3 effect.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The effect of dopamine on corticosteroid secretion from frog interrenal (adrenal) tissue was investigated in vitro using a perifusion system technique. Administration of graded concentrations of dopamine (5 X 10(-8) M to 10(-3) M) to interrenal slices induced a dose-dependent inhibition of steroid secretion. The half-maximal effective dose of dopamine was 7 X 10(-6) M for corticosterone and 4 X 10(-6) M for aldosterone. Noradrenaline and adrenaline were also able to elicit a dose-related inhibition of steroid release, but these catecholamines were approximately 100 and 2000 times less potent than dopamine in our model. Administration of repeated pulses of dopamine (5 X 10(-5) M), at 150-min intervals, led to a reproducible inhibition of corticosteroid secretion without any desensitization phenomenon. Similarly, prolonged infusion of dopamine (5 X 10(-6) M) caused a sustained inhibition of steroidogenesis. The inhibitory action of dopamine was also observed using enzymatically dispersed adrenal cells, indicating that dopamine exerts a direct effect on adrenocortical cells. After the second pulse, dopamine also induced a transient stimulation of steroid secretion from acutely dispersed cells. Administration of short pulses of apomorphine (5 X 10(-5) M) induced a transient inhibition of corticosteroid secretion, and the kinetics of the response were very similar to that observed with dopamine. During prolonged administration of dopamine, the steroidogenic actions of ACTH (10(-9) M) and serotonin (5 X 10(-6) M) were not altered. In contrast, dopamine induced a marked inhibition of angiotensin II-evoked corticosteroid secretion. Taken together, these results show that the neurotransmitter dopamine exerts a direct inhibitory effect on steroid secretion from frog adrenocortical cells. Our results also indicate that dopamine and angiotensin II likely act through a common intracellular pathway. These data suggest that dopamine, released by chromaffin cells during neurogenic stress, may modulate the response of adrenocortical cells through a paracrine mode of communication.\r"

The cells were studied 1) under basal conditions, 2) at constant pHi (6.8) with varied external sodium (Na+o), and 3) at varied pHi with constant Na+o (50 mM). In 2,7-biscarboxyethyl-5(6)-carboxyfluorescein loaded cells under basal conditions, pHi rose from 7.09 +/- 0.02 to 7.19 +/- 0.02 (P less than 0.05) with addition of ANG II (100 nM). Similarly, DMA-sensitive Na influx was enhanced from 9.2 +/- 1.3 to 14.8 +/- 2.1 nmol Na+/mg protein x min (P less than 0.01) by ANG II. In cells acid-loaded by preincubation in Na(+)-free media (pHi 6.8), addition of varying Na+o resulted in a rapid H+ efflux that was markedly inhibited by DMA. DMA-sensitive Na+ influx into these acidified cells with varied Na+o exhibited a Michaelis-Menten constant (Km) of 23 mM and a maximum velocity (Vmax) of 43 nmol Na+/mg protein x min. By varying pHi (from pHi 7.1 to 6.2), DMA-sensitive Na+ influx likewise showed activation with cellular acidification with a pK at pHi 7.09. At pHi 6.8, ANG II decreased the Km for Na+o from 23 to 17 mM and increased the Vmax from 43 to 53 nmol Na+/mg protein x min. The pHi dependence of DMA-sensitive Na+ influx was not affected by ANG II (pK at pHi 7.03). DMA also inhibited AII-stimulated aldosterone secretion and Na+ influx similarly. These results indicate that Na(+)-H+ exchange in adrenal glomerulosa cells is 1) functioning under basal conditions, and 2) is modulated by ANG II with enhanced Na+o affinity and Vmax but without a shift in pHi dependence (similar to ANG II effects on vascular smooth muscle cells). These effects suggest an important role for Na(+)-H+ exchange during ANG II stimulation of aldosterone production by glomerulosa cells.\r"

  ".W": "The cytokine interleukin-1 (IL-1) has been reported to alter reproductive functions through both effects in brain and direct actions at the level of the gonads. To further define the role of IL-1 at the gonads, we have used 125I-labeled recombinant human IL-1 to identify and characterize IL-1 receptors in crude membrane preparations of mouse (C57BL/6) testis and to study the distribution of IL-1-binding sites using autoradiography. In preliminary homogenate binding and autoradiographic studies, [125I]IL-1 alpha showed significantly higher specific binding than [125I]IL-1 beta. Thus, [125I]IL-1 alpha was used in all subsequent assays. The binding of [125I]IL-1 alpha was linear over a broad range of membrane protein concentrations, saturable, and reversible, and on Scatchard analysis revealed an equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd) of 82 +/- 4 pM and a maximum number of binding sites (Bmax) of 10.8 +/- 1.5 fmol/mg protein. In competition studies, IL-1 alpha, IL-1 beta, and a weak IL-1 beta analog IL-1 beta+ inhibited [125I]IL-1 alpha binding to mouse testis in parallel with their relative bioactivities in immune assays, with inhibitory binding affinity constant (Ki) values of 14.2 +/- 1.7, 88.8 +/- 5.7, and 7183.3 +/- 603 pM, respectively; rat/human CRF and human tumor necrosis factor showed no effect on [125I]IL-1 alpha binding. In autoradiographic studies, IL-1 receptors were heterogeneously distributed, with highest densities present in the luminal border of the epididymis and interstitial areas of the testis. After hypophysectomy, the testes were significantly atrophied, and homogenate binding and autoradiographic studies showed that while the total number of binding sites per testis was significantly decreased in hypophysectomized mice in proportion to the reduction in testicular mass, there was no apparent change in the relative density of IL-1 receptors. These data provide the first identification of IL-1 receptors in testis and provide further support for a physiological role for IL-1 to alter reproductive functions through a direct effect at the gonads.\r"

  ".W": "The antiovulatory action of epostane, an inhibitor of 3 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase activity and progesterone synthesis, was studied in the immature rat. The ovulatory process was induced in 25-day-old rats by injecting them with hCG (10 IU, sc) 2 days after the animals had been primed with PMSG (10 IU). Epostane was administered at different times between 20 h before and 11 h after hCG. Maximum inhibition of ovulation occurred when the drug was given at 3 h after hCG. Epostane inhibited ovulation in a dose-dependent manner when administered in doses ranging from 1.0-50 mg/rat, while exogenous doses of progesterone restored the ovulation rate. A dose of 3.1 mg epostane/rat 3 h after hCG reduced ovarian progesterone levels within 15 min, but the production of this steroid rebounded within 2 h and approached normal levels by 12 h after hCG, i.e. when the follicles began to rupture in control animals. 17 beta-Estradiol synthesis was inhibited just as rapidly, but it remained suppressed for up to 12 h after hCG administration. The ovarian levels of prostaglandins E2 and F2 alpha decreased approximately 30% within 2 h after the administration of epostane, but such a moderate reduction in the synthesis of ovarian prostanoids is usually not sufficient to block ovulation. The results show that epostane has a rapid, but transient, effect on ovarian progesterone synthesis. The temporary decline in the local progesterone level is apparently sufficient to interfere with the normal sequence of metabolic events that lead to the rupture of follicles.\r"

  ".U": "90298865\r", 
  ".W": "A novel bioactive peptide was recently isolated from ovine hypothalamus and was named PACAP (pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide). PACAP was present in two bioactive, amidated forms, PACAP27 and PACAP38 (27 and 38 amino acids, respectively), and showed a 68% sequence homology with vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) in the N-terminal 28 residues. PACAP38 was at least 1000 times more potent than VIP in stimulating adenylate cyclase in pituitary cells, but both peptides exhibited comparable vasodepressor activity. Thus, we sought to determine whether PACAP acts on specific binding sites in the anterior pituitary or other tissues and whether these binding sites are different from those of VIP. Binding of [125I] PACAP27 to freshly prepared rat anterior pituitary membranes in the presence and absence of 212 nM unlabeled PACAP27 was specific, saturable, and more rapid at 22 C than at 4 C. Scatchard analysis of this binding site using increasing doses of unlabeled PACAP27 revealed a single high affinity site with a Kd of 446 +/- 141 pM and a maximum number of sites of 1312 +/- 182 fmol/mg protein. These results do not exclude the possibility of a second pituitary binding site with significantly lower affinity. Unlabeled PACAP38 and PACAP38OH exhibited significantly higher affinity binding (3- to 5-fold) than PACAP27 with a similar number of pituitary sites. A variable distribution of binding sites was observed between PACAP27 and VIP when binding to different tissue membranes was measured with 125I-labeled peptides. Very high specific binding of both PACAP27 and VIP was observed in lung membranes. An almost identical relative magnitude of binding was observed between PACAP27 and VIP in lung, liver, duodenum, ovary, and thymus. However, whereas PACAP27 binding to hypothalamic and pituitary membranes was great, VIP binding to these tissues was almost absent. To determine if VIP and PACAP might share a binding site in peripheral tissues, displacement curves were generated using [125I]PACAP27 binding to lung membranes and VIP, PACAP27, and PACAP38 as unlabeled ligands. VIP was highly potent in displacing [125I] PACAP27 binding in lung membrane, and the IC50 values for all three of these peptides were between 1-10 nM. These results suggest that 1) a saturable, high affinity binding site for PACAP is present on anterior pituitary membranes; 2) PACAP27 and PACAP38, but not VIP, share this binding site in the anterior pituitary and possibly the hypothalamus; and 3) PACAP27, PACAP38, and VIP share a similar or identical binding site on lung membranes and possibly other peripheral tissues.\r"

Recently, we showed that SRIF given either iv or intraduodenally (id) strongly inhibited stimulated pancreatic secretion induced by pancreatic juice diversion (PJD) from the duodenum. In this study we evaluate the effects of iv and id infusion of a long acting analog of SRIF, SMS 201-995 (SMS), on pancreatic secretion during basal conditions (pancreatic juice returned) and PJD. Conscious rats prepared with bile, pancreatic, duodenal, and jugular cannulae were studied 3-8 days postoperatively. Protein and fluid outputs were evaluated, and plasma cholecystokinin (CCK) was measured by bioassay. iv SMS infusion (5 micrograms kg-1 h-1) inhibited basal pancreatic protein and fluid secretion by 84 and 64%, respectively. Addition of atropine (500 micrograms kg-1 h-1 ip) did not cause further inhibition. During PJD, SMS iv from 0.005-1.28 micrograms kg-1 h-1 for 3 h caused a dose-dependent inhibition with maximal 90% and 75% reductions of protein and fluid, respectively, at 1.28 micrograms SMS. Plasma CCK was also reduced by 83% from 3.01 +/- 1.15 to 0.51 +/- 0.22 pM. SMS, id at 1.7 micrograms kg-1 h-1 for 1.5 h before and 2 h after PJD, caused inhibition of basal secretion by 25% and that induced by PJD by 60%. Plasma CCK, measured 1.5 h after diversion, increased from 1.55 +/- 0.06 to 5.9 +/- 1.14 pM in the presence of SMS. Intravenous SMS was 20 times more potent than SRIF in inhibiting pancreatic protein and volume secretion stimulated by PJD. Iv SMS inhibited basal and stimulated fluid and protein pancreatic secretion as well as plasma CCK levels. SMS was also effective when given id in inhibiting fluid and protein pancreatic secretion, but id SMS increased plasma CCK levels. This effect on plasma CCK may be due to the inhibition of hormonal inhibitors of CCK release.\r"

In the present study we evaluated the effects of a neutralizing antiserum to PTHrP on bone histomorphometric parameters in hypercalcemic athymic mice bearing a human squamous cell lung cancer. These effects were compared to those of tumor resection. Similar to the effects of tumor resection, the antiserum to PTHrP resulted in a decrease in serum Ca levels, a decrease in bone resorption, and an increase in bone formation parameters. The studies, therefore, indicate that PTHrP is the major factor responsible for all of the features, including the decreased bone formation seen in HHM.\r"

Both cell types respond to ACTH in a concentration-dependent manner. Increasing concentrations of K+ (0-20 mM) cause increased production of corticosteroids and accelerated influx of Ca2+ in bovine fasciculata cells but no change in either of these two parameters in rat fasciculata cells. Two inhibitors of Ca2+ channels (nifedipine and PY108-068) inhibit both the production of steroids by unstimulated bovine cells and the stimulation produced by three agents (ACTH, (Bu)2 cAMP, and K+). Half-maximal inhibition of these responses was produced in each case by submicromolar or low micromolar concentrations of the inhibitors. These inhibitors are without effect in rat fasciculata cells. One Ca2(+)-channel agonist (BAY K8644) stimulated synthesis of steroids by bovine cells and potentiated the response to ACTH. The agonist acts in the low micromolar range but was without effect on rat cells or on the responses of steroid synthesis by these cells to either ACTH or dibutyryl cAMP. Moreover, bovine fasciculata cells show specific binding sites for [+]PN 200-110, a specific ligand for 1,4-dihydropyridine receptors associated with voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels [dissociation constant (Kd), 14.3 nM; maximum number of binding sites (Bmax), 0.52 pmol/10(6) cells]. Rat cells show no specific binding of PN 200-110.

We investigated whether there are changes in the post-translational processing of ENK-containing peptides in the fetal sheep adrenal gland with increasing gestational age. ENK-containing peptides in adrenal extracts from fetal sheep (68-142 days gestation) and adult sheep were separated using gel filtration chromatography and the ENK immunoreactivity (ENK-IR) was measured using RIAs for Met-enkephalin-Arg6,Phe7 immunoreactivity (MERF-IR) and Met-o-enk immunoreactivity (MET-O-ENK-IR). The MET-O-ENK-IR in fetal and adult sheep adrenal extracts was distributed in four main peaks, which corresponded to mol wt (MW) ranges of more than 12, 7-12, 3-7, and less than 3 kDa. There was a significant increase (P less than 0.05) in the total ENK-IR content of the fetal adrenal between 68-78 (42.4 +/- 19.2 ng/adrenal) and 100-121 (320.1 +/- 142.6 ng/adrenal) days gestation.

  ".U": "90298877\r", 
  ".W": "Arginine vasopressin (AVP) stimulates biphasic release of ACTH from anterior pituitary corticotrophs. The response consists of an initial transient spike phase lasting less than 3 min and a subsequent sustained plateau phase that persists for as long as AVP is present. AVP also acts synergistically with CRF on ACTH release. We have previously shown that the initial spike phase of the response mainly requires release of intracellular Ca2+ and is independent of calmodulin, whereas the sustained plateau phase, like the monophasic sustained response elicited by CRF, involves the influx of extracellular Ca2+ via L-type voltage-sensitive Ca2+ channels and activation of calmodulin. We have also shown that the synergism between AVP and CRF does not require extracellular Ca2+ influx. In this study we examined the role of Ca2+/phospholipid-dependent protein kinase-C (PKC) in the two phases of the response to AVP and in the synergism between AVP and CRF. We exploited the observation that prolonged exposure to phorbol esters down-regulates PKC. Dispersed adult male rat anterior pituitary cells were incubated in static suspension culture for 4-5 days, 0.5 microM phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) or 0.0005% dimethylsulfoxide vehicle alone was added, and the incubation was continued for 24 h. The cells were preperifused with PMA-free perifusion medium for 3 h and then perifused with various agents for 10-20 min. Effluent fractions were collected every 30 sec or 1 min and subjected to ACTH RIA. Pretreatment with PMA inhibited the subsequent response to 100 nM PMA and 100 microM dioctanoylglycerol, but not to 5 microM forskolin or to depolarization with 56 mM KCl, demonstrating specific down-regulation of PKC. PMA pretreatment had no effect on the initial spike phase of the response to AVP, but inhibited the sustained plateau phase by 57% (P less than 0.005) and, consequently, the integrated total response by 33% (P less than 0.05). Pretreatment had no effect on the response to CRF. However, pretreatment with PMA completely blocked both phases of the synergistic response to the combination of AVP and CRF. These results indicate that activation of PKC is required for the sustained phase of the response to AVP and both phases of its synergistic interaction with the protein kinase-A pathway, but is not involved in the initial spike phase of the response to AVP, which presumably is mediated by inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate-stimulated mobilization of intracellular Ca2+, or in the independent activation of the protein kinase-A pathway by CRF.\r"

  ".W": "We have established a rat model to investigate the relationship among serum thyroid hormones, nuclear iodothyronine receptors, and biological responses in thyrotoxic and euthyroid rats after surgical stress. Euthyroid or hyperthyroid rats (1.0 microgram T3/ml drinking water for 14 days) were subjected to surgical stress (ether anesthesia, laparotomy plus 50 mg talc, ip). Groups of control or stressed rats were killed 1, 2, and 3 days after surgical stress for measurement of thyroid hormone-responsive hepatic enzymes, alpha-glycerophosphate dehydrogenase (alpha GPD) and cytosol malic enzyme, serum T3, T3 nuclear receptors, and GH mRNA. Thyrotoxic rats had a 3.8-fold increase in alpha GPD compared to euthyroid rats before surgical stress; alpha GPD increased further to 5.9-fold the euthyroid value 1 day after surgery (P less than 0.001) to 5.1-fold after 2 days (P less than 0.05) and was similar to control after 3 days. Malic enzyme activity increased 10.5-fold before surgical stress and decreased slightly after surgical stress perhaps due to multifactorial regulation of that enzyme. No increases in T3 nuclear receptor or GH mRNA occurred after surgery in hyperthyroid rats or in any of the above parameters after surgical stress in euthyroid rats. Our findings suggest that increased alpha GPD after surgical stress in thyrotoxic rats was not due to either increased serum total T3 or free T3 or to increased T3-nuclear receptor complexes. Increased alpha GPD, therefore, appeared to be a consequence of postreceptor amplification of this thyroidal response.\r"

  ".W": "Vascularly perfused duodenal loops from normal vitamin D-replete chicks were used to obtain insight with regards to the possible mechanism(s) by which 1,25-dihydroxy-vitamin D3 [1,25(OH)2D3] rapidly stimulates intestinal Ca2+ transport (transcaltachia). The phorbol ester, 12-o-tetradecanoyl phorbol-13 acetate (TPA) (100 nM), and the adenylate cyclase activator, forskolin (10 microM), were found to stimulate Ca2+ transport from the lumen to the vascular effluent to the same extent that physiological levels of 1,25(OH)2D3 achieve. The effects of both substances exhibited concentration dependence. Similarly to 1,25(OH)2D3, addition of either TPA or forskolin to the lumenal compartment of normal chicks or vascular perfusion of duodena from vitamin D-deficient chicks failed to stimulate Ca2+ transport. Also and analogously to 1,25(OH)2-D3, TPA and forskolin-enhanced duodenal Ca2+ transport was abolished by the Ca2(+)-channel antagonists nifedipine (1 microM) and verapamil (30 microM). In addition, the protein kinase C inhibitor, staurosporine, totally abolished the rise in Ca2+ transport caused by 130 pM 1,25(OH)2D3. The synthetic peptide IP20, a well characterized cAMP-dependent protein kinase inhibitor, was also effective in suppressing 1,25(OH)2D3-dependent stimulation of duodenal Ca2+ transport. Collectively these results suggest that protein kinase C and cAMP-dependent protein kinase mediate 1,25(OH)2D3 activation of basal lateral membrane Ca2(+)-channels as an early effect in the transcaltachic response.\r"

  ".W": "The concentrations of glycosylated (G-PRL) and nonglycosylated (non-G-PRL) forms of PRL and GH were measured during pregnancy in pigs of lean and obese (high backfat thickness) lines. Pregnant sows of the two genetic lines were killed, in groups of five to eight, at 60, 75, 90, and 105 days of gestation, and their pituitary glands and plasma were analyzed for the two hormones by immunoblotting, lectin-binding, and RIA techniques. In both lean and obese pigs, pituitary concentrations of G-PRL and non-G-PRL increased with advance in pregnancy, but there were no significant changes in either form of pituitary GH. Plasma concentrations of radioimmunoassayable PRL also increased with advance in pregnancy, with no consistent changes in serum GH concentrations. The dominant PRL constituent in plasma during the second half of pregnancy was G-PRL, and its concentration either increased or remained constant with advance in pregnancy. In contrast, plasma non-G-PRL concentrations decreased with advance in pregnancy in both lines of pigs, resulting in a steady rise in the plasma G-PRL/PRL ratio toward term. Compared to lean pigs, obese pigs had less radioimmunoassayable PRL and GH in their plasma and less GH (glycosylated as well as nonglycosylated) in their pituitary glands, but obese pigs had more G-PRL in their pituitary glands than lean pigs, and their plasma G-PRL levels tended to be higher and non-G-PRL levels lower than those of lean pigs. Pituitary concentrations of non-G-PRL in the two lines of pigs were similar. Overall, the results show a preponderance of G-PRL over non-G-PRL in the plasma of pregnant sows, with a preferential secretion of the glycosylated form during the latter half of pregnancy. Furthermore, they indicate a prevalence of higher G-PRL/PRL ratios in the pituitary glands of obese than lean pigs. These findings raise the possibility of a functional role for the glycosylated variant of PRL in the initiation and/or maintenance of events associated with pregnancy and obesity in the pig.\r"

  ".W": "FRTL-5 cells were used to set up a thyroid tumor model system in C3H nu/nu mice. FRTL-5 tumors could be grown in nude mice provided serum TSH levels were elevated. Persistent TSH elevation was obtained by administration of Na131I, rendering the mice hypothyroid. After 4 weeks FRTL-5 cells were injected sc resulting in tumor growth within 2 weeks in eight out of eight mice. Although the tumors showed an apparently undifferentiated histology, lacking normal follicular structures, they were functional since the tumors were capable of concentrating [131]iodine, as demonstrated by nuclear imaging. From one of the tumors a new cell line was isolated (FRTL-5/T) that, like the parental FRTL-5 cell line, was TSH dependent for growth. In a control group of six euthyroid nude mice FRTL-5 tumor growth could not be obtained with one exception. After 3 months one animal developed a small tumor that grew rapidly thereafter. This tumor was easily transplantable in other euthyroid nude mice, showed an undifferentiated histology, and was nonfunctional, as it could not concentrate [131]iodine. From this tumor two cell lines were derived: one cultured in the presence of TSH (FRTL-5/TP) and one in the absence of TSH (FRTL-5/TA). Both cell lines were found to be TSH independent for growth. The cell lines were analyzed for TSH responsive functions and TSH receptor expression. Responsiveness to TSH in FRTL-5/T and the parental FRTL-5 cell line were similar for most thyroid specific functions tested. However, FRTL-5/T was less sensitive than FRTL-5 for TSH induced [3H]thymidine incorporation. Both cell lines had two classes of TSH binding sites with high and low affinity respectively, as determined by Scatchard analysis. FRTL-5/TP and FRTL-5/TA were both able to grow in TSH free medium and were nonresponsive to TSH in vitro, as tested for [3H]thymidine and [3H]uridine incorporation, iodine uptake, thyroglobulin iodination, and thyroglobulin secretion. This correlated with an approximately 100-fold decreased number of TSH binding sites compared to FRTL-5. The latter was caused by a complete absence of low affinity binding sites, whereas high affinity receptors were still detectable. The FRTL-5/TA cell line was the least differentiated one as thyroglobulin mRNA was detectable in only minute amounts and thyroid peroxidase expression could not be measured. These in vivo selected FRTL-5 cell lines offer a suitable model to investigate several aspects of TSH responsiveness, including signal transduction and postreceptor events, thyroid differentiation, and thyroid tumorigenesis.\r"

  ".W": "The present study was designed to characterize the regulation of the type II corticosteroid receptor (GR) mRNA in two tissues involved in the control of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. We have used a solution hybridization/S1 nuclease protection assay to quantitate GR mRNA levels in the rat hippocampus and anterior pituitary after CRF, dexamethasone (DEX), or corticosterone (CORT) treatment. In general, hippocampal GR mRNA levels increased after removal of endogenous corticosteroids by surgical adrenalectomy and decreased in response to glucocorticoid treatment. More specifically, in the hippocampus 1) GR mRNA expression was decreased when adrenalectomized (ADX) animals were replaced with a relatively low dose of CORT, but not with a low dose of DEX; 2) acutely, CRF was more effective than DEX in decreasing the levels of GR mRNA in intact animals; however, under the same paradigm in ADX animals, DEX decreased the level of GR mRNA, whereas CRF was ineffective; and 3) in contrast to the decrease in GR mRNA levels observed after acute and low doses of glucocorticoid treatment, chronic treatment with either DEX or CORT did not change the level of hippocampal GR mRNA. These results suggest that in the hippocampus the decrease in GR mRNA expression after CRF treatment is probably via the release of glucocorticoids, and that this tissue is more sensitive to endogenous glucocorticoids than DEX. Anterior pituitary GR mRNA was differentially regulated compared with that in the hippocampus. In marked contrast to Gr mRNA in the hippocampus, ADX did not alter anterior pituitary GR mRNA expression, and glucocorticoid treatment led to an increase in GR mRNA levels. In the anterior pituitary 1) glucocorticoid treatment led to an increase in GR mRNA expression, when replaced with a relatively low dose of DEX, but not when replaced with a low dose of CORT; 2) acutely, neither CRF nor DEX altered levels of GR mRNA in intact animals; however, under the same paradigm DEX increased levels in ADX animals; and 3) chronic DEX or CORT treatment of intact animals elevated levels of anterior pituitary GR mRNA. In summary, these data have demonstrated tissue-specific regulation of GR mRNA in the hippocampus and anterior pituitary, which is dependent on both the dose and length of treatment and, in addition, on the glucocorticoid itself.\r"

In the present study the identity of the cell type(s) expressing CRF receptors in mouse spleen was determined using a combination of cell fractionation and receptor-binding techniques. Autoradiographic studies of the distribution of [125I]Tyro-ovine CRF [( 125I]oCRF)-binding sites in spleen localized CRF receptors primarily to the red pulp and marginal zones. The distribution pattern of [125I]oCRF-binding sites closely resembled the pattern of India ink accumulated in phagocytic cells in the same sections. To identify the specific cell type(s) expressing CRF receptors, [125I]oCRF-binding activity was evaluated in splenic cell populations fractionated on the basis of their physical and functional properties. Macrophages were identified in each fraction by their phagocytosis of polystyrene beads and membrane labeling with MONTS-4, a monoclonal antibody specific for resident macrophages. Spleen cells were fractionated by adherence to glass bead or Sephadex G-10 columns, phagocytosis of carbonyl iron particles, and centrifugation on discontinuous Percoll gradients. By all fractionation methods, there was a significant correlation of [125I]oCRF binding with both phagocytic activity (r = 0.75; P less than 0.001) and MONTS-4 staining (r = 0.84; P less than 0.001), strongly suggesting that CRF receptors are primarily expressed on resident splenic macrophages. However, there was essentially no specific binding of [125I]oCRF to either resident or elicited peritoneal macrophages or to several monocyte/macrophage, B-cell, or T-cell lines. While these results suggest that the expression of CRF receptors may be restricted to a population of splenic macrophages, they do not exclude the possibility that CRF receptors may be induced on resident macrophages in spleen and other immune system-related tissues by factors present in the microenvironment.\r"

  ".W": "Administration of GH increases both the tubular reabsorption of inorganic phosphate (Pi) and the plasma level of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 [1,25-(OH)2D3]. These two effects could be induced by a common mediator, possibly the GH-generated insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1). In the present work, the influence of recombinant human IGF-1 on renal Pi transport and plasma 1,25-(OH)2D3 was examined in hypophysectomized (HPX) rats. IGF-1, infused by miniosmotic pump at the dose of 10 micrograms/h for 6 days, significantly increased the maximal tubular reabsorption of Pi per unit volume of glomerular filtrate (max TRPi/m1GFR): IGF-1 3.50 +/- 0.16; vehicle: 2.78 +/- 0.14 mumol/m1GFR, P less than 0.005. The response was associated with a marked stimulation of plasma 1,25-(OH)2D3 (IGF-1; 409 +/- 23; vehicle: 208 +/- 22 pmol/liter, P less than 0.001). As previously reported for GH, IGF-1 also increased GFR and reduced urinary sodium excretion. In brush border membrane vesicles isolated from renal cortex of HPX rats, the Na-dependent Pi transport was stimulated by IGF-1. Neither the Na-dependent glucose transport nor that of alanine was affected by the growth factor. The stimulatory effect of IGF-1 on maxTRPi/m1GFR was also expressed in thyroparathyroidectomized (TPTX) HPX rats (IGF-1: 5.20 +/- 0.29; vehicle: 3.88 +/- 0.37 mumol/m1GFR, P less than 0.025). In conclusion, administration of IGF-1 in HPX rats mimics the stimulatory effects of GH on maxTRPi/m1GFR and on plasma 1,25-(OH)2D3. As described for GH the change in maxTRPi/m1GFR is mediated by a PTH independent mechanism and is expressed at the level of the luminal membrane of proximal tubules. These results suggest that IGF-1 could be an important factor in the control of Pi metabolism, particularly during growth, and might play a significant role in mediating the effect of GH on the renal handling of Pi and production of 1,25-(OH)2D3.\r"

  ".W": "Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) increases serum triglycerides in rats by increasing de novo hepatic fatty acid synthesis and very low density lipoprotein production. We have recently shown that several other cytokines increase hepatic fatty acid synthesis in the mouse. We now explore the mechanism by which these cytokines increase de novo lipogenesis and the interactions between cytokines in fed mice. TNF administration results in increased hepatic levels of citrate, the primary allosteric activator of acetyl-CoA carboxylase, which is the major rate-limiting enzyme for fatty acid synthesis. The TNF-induced increase in citrate occurs within 15 min of administration, early enough to account for the acute rise in hepatic fatty acid synthesis seen by 30 min after TNF administration. IL-1, which also increases hepatic fatty acid synthesis, produces similar increases in hepatic citrate levels. In contrast, another potent stimulator of hepatic fatty acid synthesis, interferon-alpha (IFN alpha), has no effect on hepatic citrate levels. There were no acute effects of TNF or IL-1 on the activation state of acetyl-CoA carboxylase. A trend toward an increase in the activation state of acetyl-CoA carboxylase was seen after IFN alpha administration. Low doses of TNF and IL-1 given in combination show no synergy while maximal doses are not additive. In contrast, when a low dose of either TNF or IL-1 is combined with a low dose of IFN alpha, there is synergy in stimulating hepatic fatty acid synthesis. A maximal dose of TNF or IL-1 and a high dose of IFN alpha produce a further increase in hepatic fatty acid synthesis. These data support the concept that there are two classes of cytokines that stimulate hepatic fatty acid synthesis, those that can increase hepatic citrate levels and those that cannot.\r"

  ".W": "In rat pinealocytes, alpha 1-adrenergic receptor activation increases intracellular pH (pHi) through Ca2+/protein kinase-C-dependent activation of the Na+/H+ antiporter. Using a series of amiloride analogs, norepinephrine stimulation of cGMP accumulation is also found to be pHi dependent. In this study, we examined the postreceptor mechanisms involved in the amiloride effects on cyclic nucleotide accumulation using agents that simulate alpha 1-adrenoceptor activation. Four amiloride analogs, with a 500-fold difference in their inhibitory potency of the Na+/H+ antiporter, were used. 5-(N,N-Hexamethylene)amiloride (HA), the most active inhibitor of the Na+/H+ antiporter, had a stimulatory effect on isoproterenol (ISO)-stimulated cAMP, while its effect on cGMP was inhibitory. The other three amiloride derivatives had no effect on the ISO-stimulated cAMP or cGMP responses. All four amilorides (at 10 microM) had no effect on the phenylephrine potentiation of cAMP responses in beta-adrenergically stimulated cells, while they inhibited the potentiation of cGMP accumulation according to their inhibitory potency on the Na+/H+ antiporter. Using depolarizing concentrations of K+, it was found that HA was additive to the submaximal potentiation by K+ on ISO-stimulated cAMP, while its effect on cGMP was inhibitory. Amiloride hydrochloride dihydrate, the amiloride that is least potent in its inhibitory action on the Na+/H+ antiporter, had no effect on the K+ potentiation of either cAMP or cGMP. Using 4 beta-phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate in cells treated with 10 mM K+ and ISO, it was found that HA was additive to phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate and K+ potentiation of the cAMP response, while its effect on the cGMP response was inhibitory. Amiloride hydrochloride had no effect on either the cAMP or cGMP response. It can be concluded from these studies that 1) HA has a stimulatory effect on the beta-adrenoceptor-Gs-adenylate cyclase pathway that is independent of inhibition of the Na+/H+ antiporter; 2) postreceptor mechanisms are involved in HA's effects on cAMP and cGMP accumulation; and 3) the action of HA on cGMP is likely to be related to its effect on the Na+/H+ antiporter.\r"

  ".W": "Galanin is widely distributed throughout the rat neural and endocrine system. The highest concentrations are found in the anterior pituitary, and it can influence classical pituitary hormone secretion. The effects of endocrine manipulation on pituitary galanin content, mRNA, and immunostaining have been investigated in the rat. In females, medical (39 +/- 4 fmol/gland), surgical (33 +/- 2), or combined (28 +/- 6) castration resulted in a highly significant decrease in galanin content (control, 223 +/- 14; P less than 0.0001). Estrogen in physiological and pharmacological doses produced a significant increase in galanin content (368 +/- 14 and 373 +/- 13, respectively; P less than 0.01) associated with an increase in galanin mRNA content. In the male, high dose dexamethasone and thyroidectomy caused a fall in galanin content, while galanin mRNA levels showed a rise and fall, respectively. Adrenalectomy caused a rise in galanin content, while adrenalectomy and castration produced a dramatic decrease in tissue galanin content. No change in galanin mRNA was observed in these groups. Galanin immunostaining paralleled the results of tissue content in all groups examined, except in the medically castrated group, in which there was some intragroup variation in staining patterns. In normal and high-dose estrogen-treated females, galanin expression was seen mainly in lactotrophs, with a small number of somatotrophs and thyrotrophs staining. In the male, galanin expression was confined to somatotrophs and thyrotrophs. Galanin mRNA was localized at the cellular level by in situ hybridization. In the normal pituitary only scattered lactotrophs contained message, while in high-dose estrogen-treated animals the number of positive cells, mostly lactotrophs, was vastly increased. Thus, the cellular localization of galanin immunostaining varies between the sexes. Galanin peptide and mRNA levels in the pituitary are powerfully influenced by endocrine status.\r"

  ".W": "Neuroendocrine mechanisms are involved in modulation of the immune system, but the mode of action of the complex interplay between hormones and the immune system is only partially understood. This study examines the role of cortisol in monocyte differentiation and function, with regard to interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta) expression. The differentiation of the human histiocytic lymphoma cell line U 937 into macrophage-like cells by phorbol ester [phorbol myristate acetate (PMA)] is inhibited by cortisol. Some cells remain in suspension and continue to divide; others stop proliferation, but do not undergo full morphological differentiation. When cells are washed after 3 days to remove PMA and cortisol, all cells stop dividing and become fully differentiated. The PMA, therefore, commits the cells to differentiate even after its removal, while cortisol is only suppressive when present. Differentiated cells are shown to produce IL-1 beta mRNA when stimulated with lipopolysaccharide. This effect is inhibited by cortisol in a dose-dependent manner. After removal of cortisol, the least differentiated cells that remained in suspension were found to be overproducers of IL-1 beta mRNA after stimulation with lipopolysaccharide. This suggests that PMA induces a buildup of transcription-activating factors that were suppressed in the presence of cortisol. We conclude that the adrenal glucocorticoids that are elevated in acute stress conditions or major depression attenuate the differentiation and function of monocytes.\r"

  ".U": "90298897\r", 
  ".W": "PTHrP(7-34)NH2 and [D-Trp12]PTHrP(7-34)NH2 have previously been shown to be shown to be more potent antagonists than the corresponding PTH peptide, [Tyr34]bPTH(7-34)NH2. However, these peptides also display partial agonism for adenylate cyclase activity in ROS 17/2.8 cells. In this study, design of a pure potent antagonist of PTH and PTHrP by removal of agonism from PTHrP(7-34)NH2 with retention of antagonist potency was accomplished. Since [Tyr34]bPTH(7-34)NH2 lacks agonist activity, we introduced two amino acids native to the PTH sequence into their respective positions in PTHrP and the potent D-Trp12 analog. [Asn10Leu11]- and [Asn10,leu11,D-Trp12]-PTHrP(7-34)NH2 were found to be 23- and 26-fold more potent as antagonists in ROS cells than PTHrP(7-34)NH2 and [D-Trp12]PTHrP(7-34)NH2, respectively. In addition, these peptides did not display partial agonism, even in an assay based on highly responsive cells pretreated with dexamethasone and pertussis toxin. In contrast, when the PTHrP sequence Asp10,Lys11 was inserted into [Tyr34]hPTH(7-34)NH2, antagonist potency declined by more than 6-fold and PTH-like agonist activity was installed. These results demonstrate that the activation domain of both PTH and PTHrP can be extended to include the 1-12 region and that the 10-12 region, in addition to the N-terminal hexapeptide, is important not only for receptor binding but also for hormonal signal transduction.\r"

  ".W": "We have examined roles of carbohydrates of the lutropin receptor in a murine Leydig tumor cell line (MLTC) and primary cultures of rat granulosa cells. We approached this issue by deglycosylating mature receptors with glycosidases and by preventing glycosylation of nascent receptors with tunicamycin B2, an inhibitor of protein glycosylation but not protein synthesis. Deglycosylation of mature receptors with neuraminidase, N-glycanase or both did not affect ligand binding capacity. Regardless of glycosidase treatment, the number of hormone binding sites was similar. The Kas for native receptors, asialoreceptors and aglycoreceptors, are also comparable, being 2.0 x 10(9) M-1, 1.9 x 10(9) M-1 and 1.7 x 10(9) M-1 respectively. In contrast, cells treated with tunicamycin B2 failed to bind the hormone. These results demonstrate that N-oligosaccharides of mature lutropin receptors are not required for ligand binding. In addition, our data suggest, for the first time, that N-glycosylation of the receptor may be necessary for expressing functional receptors on the cell surface and that there exist striking similarities in roles of oligosaccharides of lutropin and its receptor.\r"

  ".W": "A cDNA clone (G18) was selected from an FRTL5 rat thyroid cell cDNA library by a differential screening procedure designed to identify TSH-responsive genes in thyroid cells. Nucleotide sequence analysis indicated that G18 was rat alpha-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPD). On Northern blot analysis, TSH increased GAPD mRNA levels in FRTL5 cells, reaching a maximum (4- to 10-fold above basal in different experiments) after approximately 24 h of TSH stimulation. Run-on transcription assays with nuclei prepared from quiescent and TSH-stimulated FRTL5 cells indicated that the action of TSH to increase GAPD mRNA levels was not associated with an increase in the transcriptional activity of this gene. Examination of the rate of disappearance of GAPD mRNA levels after inhibition of mRNA transcription by actinomycin-D revealed that TSH stimulation of FRTL5 cells stabilized the GAPD mRNA (t 1/2 extended from 9 to 56 h). In summary, the present data provide the first demonstration that TSH can increase the level of a mRNA transcript in thyroid cells by reducing its rate of degradation. GAPD is a useful model for future studies on the mechanism by which TSH alters gene expression at a posttranscriptional level.\r"

  ".W": "In this study, we established an in vitro model system for the study of developmental regulation of steroid enzyme expression in the perinatal brain. Single cell suspensions were prepared from the hypothalamic-olfactory tubercle region of 18-day-old rat fetuses, and aggregates were formed by incubation under constant rotation. On day 0, 3, 6, or 12 of culture, aggregates were incubated for 4 or 20 h with 3H-progesterone (P4) and the profile of 3H-steroids in the medium analyzed. Five major metabolites were formed from 3H-P4: 5 alpha-pregnan-3, 20-dione (DHP), 3 alpha-hydroxy-5 alpha-pregnan-20-one (3 alpha-OH-DHP), 3 beta-hydroxy-5 alpha-pregnan-20-one (3 beta-OH-DHP), and two unidentified polar substances designated A and B. Progressively with aggregate-age in culture, there was a decrease in the relative amounts of 3H-P4 recovered in the medium and a sequential increase in DHP, 3 beta-OH-DHP, 3 alpha-OH-DHP, A and B. Aggregates maintained in a chemically defined, serum-free medium metabolized P4 at an accelerated rate compared to those maintained in serum. An inhibitor of the enzyme 5 alpha-reductase completely inhibited P4 metabolism, indicating that 5 alpha-reduction is the primary step in this pathway. Thus, the aggregates express three key enzymes in P4 metabolism: 5 alpha-reductase, 3 alpha- and 3 beta-hydroxysteroid oxidoreductases and the operation of this pathway is proposed: P4----DHP----3 alpha-OH-DHP + 3 beta-OH-DHP; A and B are derived from one or more of the latter three. Hence, this culture system can serve as a model to study regulatory processes in the developing steroidogenic brain.\r"

In this study, we have used an autoradiographic method based on the incorporation of [3H]proline into freshly synthesized bone matrix to determine the overall effects of these factors on bone matrix apposition in 21-day-old fetal rat calvariae. IGF I, PDGF, and TGF beta increased bone matrix apposition in a dose-dependent manner up to 2-fold within 48 h. In addition, they partially or completely reversed the inhibition of bone matrix apposition observed with PTH. Exogenously added TGF beta was significantly more potent than equimolar concentrations of PDGF or IGF I in stimulating bone formation. Matrix apposition was greatest when IGF I, PDGF, and TGF beta were added simultaneously to the culture medium, indicating that these factors can enhance each other in stimulating bone formation. In conclusion, our results provide direct evidence that IGF I, PDGF, and TGF beta are capable of stimulating bone formation in vitro.\r"

  ".W": "In the design and biological evaluation of PTH antagonists, certain analogs, although antagonists in vitro, possess partial agonist properties in vivo that preclude their utility as antagonists. In an effort to identify weak agonism of PTH analogs, an attempt was made to enhance the responsiveness of the widely employed rat osteosarcoma (ROS 17/2.8) cell adenylate cyclase assay. Because responsiveness to PTH in these cells is enhanced upon treatment with dexamethasone (dex) or pertussis toxin (PT), we have evaluated their use to aid in detection of partial agonism for PTH and PTH-related protein (PTHrP) antagonist analogs. Treatment of cells with dex alone (30 nM for 3 days) or with PT alone (40 ng/ml for 1 day) increased basal adenylate cyclase activity by 27%. However, combination of the dex and PT treatments increased basal cAMP production 70%. The in vivo partial agonist [Nle8,18,Tyr34]bPTH(3-34)NH2 increased cAMP production 3-fold over basal levels in untreated cells, nearly 5-fold in PT-treated cells, 8-fold in cells treated with dex, and 10-fold in cells treated with dex plus PT. Similar results were obtained with PTHrP(7-34)NH2: the 6-fold stimulation observed in control cells was converted to 14-fold in cells treated with dex plus PT. Agonist activity undetectable in the conventional assay was observed in the dex plus PT system: [Tyr34]- and [D-Trp12,Tyr34]bPTH(7-34)NH2, which exhibit no agonist activity under control conditions, stimulated cAMP production 2.6- and 2.1-fold, respectively, under dex plus PT treatment. In contrast, the antagonist analogs [Asn10,Leu11]- and [Leu11,D-Trp12]PTHrP(7-34)NH2, hybrid peptides of PTH and PTHrP, had no agonist activity under any conditions. Because of increased responsiveness, this assay should occupy an important step in the pathway for evaluation of PTH antagonists and permit identification of weak partial agonist activity before extensive in vivo testing.\r"

This observation that two peptides with limited homology have equal affinities for the same receptor is unusual. In this report we investigated two aspects of PTH/PTHrP-receptor interactions. First, the nonhomologous 14-34 regions of PTH and PTHrP were synthesized and evaluated. Second, hybrid peptides containing the 7-18 fragment of one hormone combined with the 19-34 region of the other hormone were studied to determine whether interactions between these two regions are required for receptor recognition. All four peptides were examined in bovine renal cortical membrane and rat osteosarcoma (ROS 17/2.8) cell PTH-binding and PTH-stimulated adenylate cyclase assays. The results indicate that the receptor-binding domains of PTH and PTHrP lie outside of the 1-13 region, the region containing sequence homology shared by the two hormones, and that two peptides of different amino acid sequence bind with equal affinity to the bovine renal PTH receptor. However, in the absence of the N-terminal region, the rat bone PTH receptor displays a preference for the C-terminal (19-34 sequence) region of PTHrP.\r"

Plasma testosterone titers in normal and stressed male fetuses closely parallel the activity of 3 beta HSD in fetal Leydig cells. In the present study quantitative cytochemistry was used to determine whether the stress-induced alterations in 3 beta HSD activity could be prevented by treating the mother with naltrexone, an opioid receptor blocker, before each stress session. Naltrexone normalized 3 beta HSD activity on days 18 and 19 of gestation, suggesting that the stress-induced suppression involves the endogenous opioid system. In contrast, naltrexone did not prevent the elevation in enzyme activity seen on day 17 in stressed fetuses. The persistence of a stress-induced surge on day 17, in spite of naltrexone therapy, suggests that some nonopioid mechanism is operational at that time.\r"

  ".W": "There is a diurnal variation in the mean incidence and amplitude of fetal breathing movements (FBMs) in sheep after approximately 120 days gestation. To determine whether this variation is caused by diurnal fluctuations in plasma glucose or prostaglandin (PG) concentrations, we studied two groups of pregnant sheep fed either once daily at 1100 h or every 2 h for 24 h. Maternal and fetal blood samples were taken every 2 h from 0900 to 0900 h the next day for assay of plasma glucose and PGE2 and PGF2 alpha concentrations. FBMs were recorded throughout the 24 h. The mean fetal plasma glucose concentrations of the once-daily and multifed groups were not different, but there was a significant difference between the two groups in the 24-h pattern of fetal glucose concentrations. In the once-daily fed group, plasma glucose concentrations reached a peak 8 h after maternal feeding and then declined, whereas in the multifed group, fetal plasma glucose concentrations reached a plateau and were constant from 1300 to 0900 h the next day. Fetal plasma PGE2 and PGF2 alpha concentrations did not show a significant change with time of day in either group. There was a significant diurnal variation in the incidence and amplitude of FBMs in each of the two feeding groups, and the 24-h pattern of FBMs did not differ significantly between groups. Therefore it would appear that the diurnal variation of FBMs is not a consequence of the maternal feeding regimen or diurnal changes in plasma glucose or PG concentrations.\r"

This study sought to further those investigations by comparing the effects of two other antipyretic drugs, sodium salicylate and acetaminophen, administered intraperitoneally, during AVP V1-receptor blockade within the ventral septal area (VSA) of the rat brain. During endotoxin-evoked fever, V1-receptor blockade within the VSA of the conscious unrestrained rat significantly antagonized the antipyretic effects of salicylate. The effects of the V1-antagonist on salicylate-induced antipyresis were dose related. In contrast, the antipyresis elicited by acetaminophen was unaffected by VSA V1-antagonist pretreatment. Neither saline nor the V1-antagonist microinjected into the VSA of febrile or nonfebrile rats had any significant effects on the normal progression of endotoxin fever or normal core temperature, respectively. These data suggest that the mechanism of action of salicylate-induced antipyresis includes activation of AVP V1-type receptors within the VSA, as has been shown for indomethacin. However, the lack of effect of the V1-antagonist on antipyresis induced by acetaminophen indicates that not all antipyretic drugs act through the same mechanism in the brain.\r"

The atmospheres were heliox with partial pressures of oxygen of 40 kPa during the bottom phase and 50 kPa during the compression and decompression phase. The bottom times were 3, 10, and 13 days. Decompression time was 13 days. Precordial Doppler monitoring was done daily during the decompression, and an estimate of the total bubble load on the pulmonary circulation was calculated as the accumulated sum of bubble scores recorded for each diver. Nine of the 18 divers had chest symptoms with retrosternal discomfort or nonproductive cough after the dive. There were no changes in dynamic lung volumes. Transfer factor for carbon monoxide was significantly reduced from 12.3 +/- 1.2 to 10.9 +/- 1.3 mmol.kPa-1.min-1 (P less than 0.01), and maximum oxygen uptake was reduced from 3.98 +/- 0.36 to 3.42 +/- 0.37 l/min STPD (P less than 0.01) after the dives.

The ventilatory requirements in relation to oxygen uptake and carbon dioxide elimination were significantly increased (P less than 0.01) after the dives. The physiological dead space fraction of tidal volume was significantly higher and showed an increase with larger tidal volumes (P less than 0.05).

We have evaluated the role of the glucose cycle in the regulation of plasma glucose concentration during exercise at 70% of maximal O2 uptake and during recovery in five normal volunteers. Total glucose flux was measured by use of [2-2H]glucose (Ra2), net glucose flux through the glucose cycle was determined with [6,6-2H2]glucose (Ra6), and the rate of glucose cycling was determined by Ra2 - Ra6. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry was used for analysis of isotopic enrichment. At rest, 33% of total glucose flux was recycled. In exercise, total flux increased 300%, but so did glucose cycling, which means that there was no change in the percentage of flux recycled. In recovery, both total flux and the rate of recycling returned rapidly to the resting value. We therefore conclude that whereas total glucose production can respond extremely quickly to large changes in energy requirements caused by exercise, thereby enabling maintenance of a constant blood glucose concentration, glucose cycling does not have an important role in amplifying the control of net hepatic glucose flux through the glucose cycle.\r"

To evaluate the possibility that exercise prevents rather than masks the aging-related changes responsible for development of insulin resistance, we investigated the effects of 10 days of physical inactivity in 14 master athletes aged 61 +/- 2 (SE) yr. The response of 10 of these men to inactivity was similar to that of young athletes, with an unchanged plasma glucose response and a significantly greater insulin response to an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) after 10 days of inactivity. These 10 athletes appeared to have been protected against the aging-related changes in GT because their plasma glucose and insulin levels during the OGTT after 10 days of inactivity were not significantly different from those of young lean sedentary men. In contrast, a deterioration in GT occurred in four of the master athletes during 10 days of inactivity; this was sufficiently marked in two of them to be classified as impaired GT. We conclude that regular exercise may 1) protect against the development of insulin resistance and decline in GT with aging in individuals with normal GT and 2) normalize GT by means of short-term effects of exercise in some individuals with abnormal GT.\r"

On the other hand, direct pressure measurements using small catheters (less than 1-mm OD) in pulmonary vessels have been limited to those greater than 1.2 mm. We measured pressure in intermediate-sized microvessels (300-700 microns) using the micropuncture method in isolated perfused rabbit lungs. These microvessels are located 2 or 3 mm beneath the pleura. We exposed them by microsurgery and punctured the relatively thick-walled vessels with specially configured micropipettes. We exposed one pulmonary microvessel in each rabbit lung by microsurgery on the left middle lobe. In 15 rabbit lungs we measured pressure in a total of six small arteries (275- to 470-microns diam) and nine small veins (300- to 700-microns diam) under high zone 3 conditions, near the zone 2/3 boundary. We found approximately 35% of the total pulmonary vascular pressure drop in arteries greater than 275-microns diam and 7% in veins greater than 300-microns diam. In veins greater than 500-microns diam, there was no measurable pressure drop. After the measurements, we froze the lung and confirmed that there was no detectable interstitial or alveolar edema in the cross sections of the punctured site. Our data are compatible with those of other investigators who have used isolated perfused rabbit lungs under similar experimental conditions.\r"

We tested this hypothesis by measuring the effects of cobalt chloride on carotid chemosensory fibers in pentobarbital-anesthetized cats that were paralyzed and artificially ventilated. Responses of carotid chemoreceptor afferents to graded doses of cobalt given by intra-arterial injections (0.08-2.10 mumols) were measured at constant blood gases. Responses of the same chemoreceptor afferents to hypoxia, before and after a saturation dose of cobalt, were measured. In two experiments carotid body tissue PO2 was also simultaneously measured. The chemosensory fibers showed prolonged excitation after a brief period of inhibition subsequent to cobalt administration. The stimulatory effect showed a dose-dependent saturation response. Cobalt augmented rather than blocked carotid chemoreceptor response to hypoxia. The effect of cobalt was not mediated by tissue PO2. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that cobalt stimulates the O2-sensing mechanism, although a direct effect of cobalt on the excitability of the chemosensory terminal remains a possibility.\r"

Changes in Pga(air), Pga(liq), and Prec were nearly in phase and linearly related. The changes in Pga(liq) and Prec were nearly equal in all maneuvers, whereas the changes in Pga(air) were systematically greater than those of Pga(liq) and Prec during quiet breathing and relaxation maneuvers in the upright position. During expulsive maneuvers in either posture the abdominal shape and stomach position were relatively constant, and the changes in Pga(air) were nearly equal to those of Pga(liq) and Prec. Discrepancies between changes in Pga(air) and the other pressures were consistent with presumed changes in the height of the gastric air bubble. We conclude that abdominal pressure in humans is essentially hydrostatic during quiet breathing and slow breathing maneuvers.\r"

Gore-Tex, a highly gas-permeable open mesh of Teflon fibrils (78% porosity, 0.2-microns pore size, 75-microns thick), constrains WB to form a thin film without imposing an appreciable gas diffusion barrier. WB layer thickness, measured by isotope dilution, is 1.7 +/- 0.2 microns. WB films are mounted between fiber optics in a gas flow tube for dual-wavelength (536/558 nm) oxyhemoglobin saturation measurements after a step change in PO2. For isocapnic (6% CO2) step changes in PO2 between 0 and 104 Torr, WB O2 uptake half time is 10.4 +/- 0.9 ms; WB O2 release half time is 20.6 +/- 2.4 ms. Half-time values are half of those previously reported. The thin-layer method reduces erythrocyte diffusion boundary layer error and thereby offers an attractive alternative to classical rapid fluid-mixing techniques.\r"

At all L, for changes in saturation (S) 0----1, t0.5(off) was about twofold greater than t0.5(on). Doubling initial onloading PO2 gradient decreased t0.5(on) 36%; t0.5(off) was unchanged. A 10-Torr change in WB O2 affinity (P50) had no significant effect on t0.5. Specific O2 conductance [theta(O2), ml O2.(min.Torr.ml WB)-1] was also computed as a function of S from these data. A bell-shaped theta(O2) vs. S relationship was always obtained; maximum values of theta(O2) reached 25. Measured values for theta(O2) at any S were highly sensitive to choice of experimental conditions, i.e., L, affinity, flux direction, initial PO2 gradient, and initial level of S. We show experimentally and theoretically that no unique relationship exists for theta(O2) as a function of S for erythrocytes in WB.\r"

Before stimulation, glycogen contents in the white (WG) and red gastrocnemius (RG) and soleus (SOL) muscles were increased by 13-25% in S and decreased by 15-27% in F compared with N. Hindlimb blood flow was occluded 60 s before stimulation to produce a predominantly anaerobic environment. Muscles were stimulated with trains of supramaximal impulses (100 ms at 80 Hz) at a rate of 1 Hz for 60 s. Muscle glycogenolysis was measured from the decrease in glycogen content and estimated from the accumulation of glycolytic intermediates in the closed system. The resting glycogen content had no effect on measured or estimated glycogenolysis in all muscles studied. Average glycogenolysis in the WG, RG, and SOL muscles was 98.4 +/- 4.3, 60.9 +/- 4.0, and 11.2 +/- 3.6 mumol glucosyl U/g dry muscle, respectively. Hindlimb tension production was similar across conditions. The results suggest that in vivo glycogen phosphorylase activity in skeletal muscle is not regulated by the content of its substrate glycogen (range 80-165 mumol/g) during short-term tetanic stimulation in an anaerobic environment.\r"

This study examined the possible interaction of these two metabolic challenges in four double-blind counterbalanced trials. Young adult men (n = 6) ingested caffeine (5 mg/kg) or placebo (dextrose, 5 mg/kg) and rested for 2 h in 28 or 5 degrees C air. Cold stress alone elevated (P less than 0.05) plasma norepinephrine, metabolism (O2 consumption, VO2), and respiratory exchange ratio (RER). Caffeine alone increased (P less than 0.05) plasma epinephrine and FFA but not RER. When the two challenges were combined (caffeine plus 5 degrees C for 2 h) norepinephrine and epinephrine were increased (P less than 0.05) as was FFA. However, VO2, RER, and skin and rectal temperatures were not different from the responses observed at 5 degrees C after placebo ingestion. The data suggest that caffeine selectively increases plasma epinephrine, whereas cold air increases norepinephrine. During the cold exposure, increasing epinephrine and FFA above normal levels did not appear to influence the metabolic or thermal responses to the cold stress. In fact the increase in RER suggested a greater carbohydrate oxidation.\r"

  ".W": "Many older athletes are capable of endurance performances equal to those of young runners who have higher maximal O2 uptakes (VO2max). To determine whether this is a result of differences in skeletal muscle characteristics, gastrocnemius muscle biopsy samples were obtained from eight master athletes [aged 63 +/- 6 (SD) yr] and eight young (aged 26 +/- 3 yr) runners. The young runners were matched with the master athletes for 10-km running performance and for their volume, pace, and type of training. Despite similar 10-km run times, VO2max was 11% lower (P less than 0.05) in the master athletes. Fiber type distribution did not differ between groups, with both groups having 60% type I and very few type IIb fibers. Succinate dehydrogenase and beta-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase activities, however, were 31 and 24% higher in the master athletes compared with the matched young runners, whereas lactate dehydrogenase activity was 46% lower (all P less than 0.05). The capillary-to-fiber ratio was also greater in the master athletes; however, capillary density was similar in the two groups, because of the master athletes' 34% larger (P less than 0.05) type I fibers. These differences in skeletal muscle characteristics may explain the master athletes' ability to perform as well as some young runners despite having a lower VO2max.\r"

Tests were performed in two hydration states: hydrated (H, 25 ml water/kg body wt 1 h before the test, 2.5 h before exercise) and hypohydrated (Hypo, after 18-20 h of water deprivation). Each test began with a 90-min rest period during which the transiently increased plasma volume and decreased osmolality after drinking in the H condition returned to base line. This period was followed by 30 min of cycle exercise at a mean intensity of 43% VO2max and a 60-min resting recovery period with water ad libitum. Although prior drinking caused no sustained changes in plasma osmolality, Hypo increased plasma osmolality by 7-10 mosmol/kg in both groups. There were no significant age differences in water intake, urine output or osmolality, overall change in body weight, or sweating rate. In the H state, the percent change in plasma volume was less (P less than 0.01) during exercise for the Y group (-5.9 +/- 0.7%) than for the MA group (-9.4 +/- 0.6%). Esophageal temperature (Tes) was higher in the Hypo condition for both groups with no age-related differences. Throughout the 3-h period, mean skin temperature was higher in the Y group and significantly so (P less than 0.05) in the Hypo condition.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Motor units were isolated by microdissection and stimulation of C5 ventral root filaments and then classified as fast-twitch fatigable (FF), fast-twitch fatigue intermediate (FInt), fast-twitch fatigue resistant (FR), or slow-twitch (S) based on standard physiological criteria. The evoked EMG responses of S and FR units showed very little change during the fatigue test. The evoked EMG waveform and rms values of FF and FInt units displayed variable changes during the fatigue test. When changes were observed, they typically included a prolongation of the EMG waveform, a decrease in peak amplitude, and a decrease in rms value. The changes in EMG amplitude and rms values were not correlated. In more fatigable units, the decrease in force during the fatigue test generally exceeded the decrease in EMG rms values. Changes in the evoked force and EMG responses of multiple units innervated by C5 or C6 ventral roots were also examined during the fatigue test. The decrease in diaphragm force during the fatigue test closely matched the force decline predicted by the proportionate contribution of different motor unit types. However, the observed reduction in diaphragm EMG rms values during the fatigue test exceeded that predicted based on the aggregate contribution of different motor unit types. It was concluded that changes in EMG do not reflect the extent of diaphragm fatigue.\r"

Esophageal pressure (Ppl) and brachial artery pressure, relative to either atmospheric (Pa) or esophageal pressure (Patm), were measured simultaneously during normal and loaded breathing. It was assumed that changes in intrathoracic systemic arterial transmural pressure were adequately represented by Patm. During control, no significant difference between systolic fluctuation (delta Pa) and pleural swings (delta Ppl) was found. Concurrently, inspiratory and expiratory Patm were nearly identical. By contrast, under maximally loaded conditions, higher magnitudes of delta Ppl than delta Pa were found and consequently Patm rose with inspiration. In this connection, the plot of delta Pa against delta Ppl showed that the slopes for delta Ppl less than or equal to 15 Torr (1.2 Torr delta Pa/delta Ppl) and delta Ppl greater than 15 Torr (0.4 Torr delta Pa/delta Ppl) were significantly different. Under all experimental conditions we found during inspiration a rise in diastolic Patm that is consistent with an increase in left ventricular afterload.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

All 24 study participants were sheet metal workers who were nonsmokers with normal parenchyma on posteroanterior chest radiograph. These subjects had either normal pleura (n = 7), circumscribed plaques (n = 9), or diffuse pleural thickening (n = 8). After controlling for age, years in the trade, and pack-years of smoking, we found that sheet metal workers with diffuse pleural thickening had a lower forced vital capacity (P less than 0.001), total lung capacity (P less than 0.01), and CO-diffusing capacity of the lung (P less than 0.05) than those with normal pleura. Similarly, sheet metal workers with circumscribed plaques were found to have a reduced forced vital capacity; however, because of the small number of study subjects, this difference (regression coefficient = -11.0) was only marginally significant (P = 0.06). Although circumscribed plaque and diffuse pleural thickening were both associated with a lymphocytic alveolitis and a higher prevalence of parenchymal fibrosis on high-resolution computerized tomography (HRCT) scan, neither a lymphocytic alveolitis nor the finding of parenchymal fibrosis on HRCT scan influenced the relationship between pleural fibrosis and restrictive lung function. We conclude that pleural fibrosis is associated with restrictive lung function and abnormally low diffusion that appears to be independent of our measures of parenchymal injury (chest X-ray, bronchoalveolar lavage, and HRCT scan).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Isometric contractile properties and fatigue resistance of the diaphragm were measured by means of an in vitro nerve-muscle strip preparation. Contractions were evoked by using phrenic nerve stimulation (left hemidiaphragm) or direct muscle stimulation (right hemidiaphragm) in the presence of curare. Acute ND resulted in a 20% reduction in body weight. No significant decrements in diaphragm or soleus weights were noted in the ND animals compared with controls (CTL), whereas the weight of the medial gastrocnemius was reduced by 20% in the ND animals. Peak twitch and tetanic tensions (normalized for the weight of the diaphragm strip) were not reduced in ND compared with CTL animals after either nerve or muscle stimulation. The fatigue index of the diaphragm was significantly reduced in ND animals only after nerve stimulation. After the fatigue test, there was rapid recovery of the additional fatigue noted with nerve stimulation. The proportions of type I and II muscle fibers of the diaphragm were similar in the CTL and ND animals. No differences in diaphragm cross-sectional areas were noted for either type I or II muscle fibers in the CTL and ND animals. It is concluded that acute ND has no effect on diaphragm contractility or morphometry and only an inconsequential influence on diaphragm fatigue.\r"

Minimal vascular resistance decreased in the casted forearm from 3.0 +/- 0.4 to 2.6 +/- 0.5 mmHg.ml-1.min.100 ml (P less than 0.014). There was no change in the noncasted forearm: 2.5 +/- 0.3 vs. 2.5 +/- 0.3 mmHg.ml-1.min.100 ml. This study shows that maximal vasodilation improves with the resumption of normal physical activity and therefore demonstrates that immobilization is associated with a reduced forearm vasodilator capacity.\r"

Therefore, a 10-wk running program (1 h/day, 5 days/wk, 20% grade, 1 mile/h) was conducted to ascertain the effects of endurance training on isomyosin expression in the soleus, vastus intermedius (VI), plantaris (PLAN), red and white medial gastrocnemius (RMG and WMG), and red and white vastus lateralis muscles (RVL and WVL). Evidences of training were noted by the presence of a resting and a submaximal exercise bradycardia, as well as an enhancement in peak O2 consumption in the trained rodents relative to the nontrained controls. No evidence for skeletal muscle hypertrophy was observed subsequent to training when muscle weight was normalized to body weight. Shifts in the isomyosin profile of the trained VI, RMG, RVL, and PLAN were seen relative to the nontrained controls. Specifically, training affected the slow myosin (SM) composition of the VI by decreasing the relative content of the SM2 isoform by 14% while increasing that of the SM1 isoform (P less than 0.05). In addition, training elicited various degrees of a fast to slower myosin transformation in the RMG, RVL, and PLAN. All three muscles showed a significant reduction in the fast myosin 2 isoform (P less than 0.05), with significant increases in intermediate myosin in the RVL and PLAN along with elevations in SM2 in the RMG and PLAN (P less than 0.05).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Their first pass through the pulmonary circulation was compared with erythrocytes (RBCs) using the indicator-dilution technique, and their recovery within the circulation of the lung and other organs was determined at 10 min by counting the radioisotopes in each organ. The extraction of each cell relative to RBCs during the first pass through the lung correlated with cell size in that the neutrophils (volume 107-140 fl) showed 97.6 +/- 0.6% extraction, monocytes (volume 80-105 fl) showed 91.4 +/- 1.7% extraction, lymphocytes (volume 36-75 fl) showed 80.1 +/- 4.4% extraction, and platelets (volume 4-7 fl) showed 33.1 +/- 3.9% extraction. After 10 min of circulation, the proportion of injected cells remaining in the lung was similar for neutrophils and monocytes (27.4 +/- 1.8 vs. 31.4 +/- 1.6%) but lower for lymphocytes (18.6 +/- 2.9%) and platelets (3.1 +/- 0.5%). All of the leukocytes were found to have a substantial marginated pool within the lung, whereas the platelets did not. The exchange between the circulating and marginated pools of leukocytes in the lung was related to blood velocity, with the least retention occurring in lung regions with shortest RBC transit times. We conclude that cell size is a major factor determining the time that cells will be delayed by the pulmonary microvasculature.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Previously we have shown that synthetic smoke composed of carbon and acrolein, a common component of smoke, causes delayed-onset noncardiogenic pulmonary edema. To study the possible role of the vasoactive and edemagenic sulfidopeptide leukotrienes (SPLT) in smoke inhalation injury, we measured pulmonary hemodynamics, lung lymph flow, and SPLT and leukotriene (LT) B4 in lung lymph before and after 10 min of synthetic acrolein smoke exposure. After smoke exposure there was a significant rise in pulmonary vascular resistance caused by a rise in pulmonary arterial pressure, a fall in cardiac output, and no change in pulmonary capillary wedge pressure. This was accompanied by an increase in total systemic vascular resistance (P less than 0.05), lung lymph flow (P less than 0.05), and extravascular lung water-to-lung dry weight ratio (P less than 0.05). Both SPLT and LTB4 clearance rose significantly (P less than 0.05), but there was a 10-fold increase in SPLT over LTB4 clearance. In sheep pretreated with FPL55712, a SPLT antagonist, the early rise in pulmonary vascular resistance was attenuated, and the rise in systemic vascular resistance was blocked. This was associated with an attenuated and delayed fall in cardiac output. FPL55712 had no effect on lung lymph flow or extravascular lung water-to-dry weight ratio. SPLT, and especially LTD4, may have a role in increased pulmonary and systemic vascular resistance after smoke inhalation injury but does not appear to affect vascular permeability.\r"

The transverse cross-sectional areas of the rib cage, mediastinum, and diaphragm were calculated every 1.6 mm along the length of the thorax. The changes in the volume and the axial distribution of transverse area of the three chest wall components with lung volume and body position were evaluated. The decrease of the transverse area within the rib cage between TLC and FRC, as a fraction of the area at TLC, was uniform from the apex of the thorax to the base. The volume of the mediastinum increased slightly between TLC and FRC (14% of its TLC volume supine and 20% prone), squeezing the lung between it and the rib cage. In the transverse plane, the heart was positioned in the midthorax and moved little between TLC and FRC. The shape, position, and displacement of the diaphragm were described by contour plots. In both postures, the diaphragm was flatter at FRC than at TLC, because of larger displacements in the dorsal than in the ventral region of the diaphragm. Rotation from the prone to supine body position produced a lever motion of the diaphragm, displacing the dorsal portion of the diaphragm cephalad and the ventral portion caudad. In five of the six dogs, bilateral isovolume pneumothorax was induced in the supine body position while intrathoracic gas volume was held constant.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The lung was modeled as an elastic body, and the deformation of the lung from TLC to FRC caused by the change in chest wall shape and gravity were calculated. Parenchymal distortions, distributions of regional volume at FRC as a fraction of the volume at TLC, and distributions of surface pressure at FRC are reported. In the prone dog there are minor variations in fractional volume along the cephalocaudal axis. In transverse planes opposing deformations are caused by the change of shape of the transverse section and the gravitational force on the lung, and the resultant fractional volume and pleural pressure distributions are nearly uniform. In the supine dog, there is a small cephalocaudal gradient in fractional volume, with lower fractional volume caudally. In transverse sections the heart and abdomen extend farther dorsally at FRC, squeezing the lung beneath them. The gradients in fractional volume and pleural pressure caused by shape changes are in the same direction as the gradients caused by the direct gravitational force on the lung, and these two factors contribute about equally to the large resultant vertical gradients in fractional volume and pleural pressure. In the prone position the heart and upper abdomen rest on the rib cage. In the supine posture much of their weight is carried by the lung.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The TA activity was recorded by fine bipolar wire electrodes and was reflexly altered by changes in lung volume and chest wall compression. The integrated muscle activity was expressed as a percentage of a maximal peak integrated TA activity (%max). In the absence of TA activity the pressure-flow relationship was alinear and could be described by a power function. Log-log P-V plots at varying levels of TA activity were linear, with a slope a of 1.84 +/- 0.07 (SD). When TA activity increased, laryngeal resistance increased exponentially. An effective hydraulic diameter was calculated for increments in %max TA and decreased linearly with %max TA. In three dogs the glottic diameter was computed from glottic area measured by fiber-optic laryngoscopy, and it also decreased linearly as TA increased. Sectioning of the external motor branch of the superior laryngeal nerve to the cricothyroid muscle demonstrated no consistent effect on laryngeal resistance over a range of TA activity. The results indicate that laryngeal dimensions decrease linearly with TA activity. However, the P-V relationship of the larynx may be described by a power function, with a single exponent consistent with an orifice flow regimen. Spontaneous activity of the cricothyroid muscle does not measurably influence this relationship.\r"

We decreased Cdyn in steps through the physiological range by briefly restricting lung expansion with an inflatable cuff around the chest and recording the response after deflating the cuff; we restored Cdyn to control by hyperinflating the lungs. Of 45 RARs, 34 were stimulated by a 40 +/- 2% reduction in Cdyn, their inspiratory discharge increasing on average more than threefold. Two-thirds of responsive RARs were stimulated by less than or equal to 20% reductions in Cdyn; in most, firing increased proportionately with lung stiffness (1/Cdyn) as Cdyn was decreased further. Stimulation by reduced Cdyn was not simply a function of the concomitant increase in transpulmonary pressure, because similar increases in pressure produced by increasing tidal volume produced smaller increases in firing. RAR stimulation was unaffected by atropine and, hence, was not dependent on neurally mediated changes in bronchomotor tone. Our results indicate that during spontaneous breathing RARs provide a signal inversely proportional to Cdyn.\r"

  ".W": "We examined the effects of the inhaled parasympatholytic agent atropine and the sympathomimetic agent salbutamol on partitioned frictional pressure (Pfr) losses to the site of flow limitation (choke point, CP) in dogs to see how changes brought about by these agents would affect maximum expiratory flow (Vmax) and response to breathing 80% He-20% O2 (delta Vmax) in terms of wave-speed theory of flow limitation. In open-chest dogs, a Pitot-static tube was advanced down the right lower lobe to locate CP, to determine CP lateral and end-on pressures (PE), and to partition the airway into peripheral (alveoli to sublobar) and central (sublobar to CP) segments. Measurements were obtained at approximately 50% vital capacity. After inhalation, CP locations were unchanged with both bronchodilating agents. After atropine inhalation, Pfr central was decreased by one-half compared with base line. Despite the decrease in Pfr central, however, Vmax failed to increase after atropine because of altered bronchial area pressure (BAP) behavior at the CP site. After salbutamol inhalation, Pfr peripheral was reduced by about one-half compared with base line. However, Vmax failed to increase, because this reduction was too small to significantly increase the CP pressure head (i.e., PE). delta Vmax was also insensitive to these agents. Our results show mechanisms by which small changes in Pfr, as well as the complex interaction of changes in Pfr and BAP, may limit the use of Vmax in detecting bronchodilation at different airway sites.\r"

The time course of Qpha, Qphv, Qimv, and Qazv after imposed patterns of diaphragmatic contraction was measured in nine anesthetized dogs. Each pattern consisted of various combinations of transdiaphragmatic pressure (Pdi), frequency of pacing (f), and duty cycle obtained by bilateral phrenic nerve stimulation. The dogs were prepared with chests open and loosely casted abdomens. Qpha, Qphv, Qimv, and Qazv were measured at rest (control, passive diaphragm, mechanical ventilation) and at two submaximal levels of stimulation (30 and 60% of Pdimax). The f was 10 or 30 cycles/min and the duty cycle was 0.25, 0.50, and 0.75. The results show 1) Qpha, Qphv, Qimv, and Qazv reached stable values (equilibration) after 30-36 s of pacing; 2) the steady Qpha, Qphv, and Qimv were linearly related to Pdi, and they were related by a parabolic function to duty cycle, whereas Qazv was not significantly affected by Pdi and increased linearly as a function of the duty cycle; 3) the diaphragmatic blood drainage was approximately 60% through the intercostal veins leading into the azygos trunk, 25% through the phrenic vein, and 15% through the internal mammary vein during pacing of the diaphragm at a duty cycle of 0.50 and 60% Pdimax; and 4) for a given pacing pattern, Qpha and Qphv increased with f, but Qimv and Qazv did not.\r"

At 19 wk of age pulmonary function was measured. The lungs were excised for measurements of recoil pressures and wet and dry weights. The dimensions of central and peripheral airways were estimated from analysis of bronchial casts. Corticosteroid-treated animals were shorter and tended to be lighter than control animals but were heavier in relation to length. Total lung capacity was reduced in proportion to the reduction in body size. Lung recoil and wet-to-dry weight ratios were nearly identical. Maximal expiratory flows were reduced in proportion to the reduction in body size. Size-corrected airway conductance was reduced, suggesting a sensitivity of central airways to growth suppression by corticosteroids. Peripheral airways, on the other hand, were not smaller in treated animals and were larger in proportion to body size. In the ferret corticosteroid administration is associated with a suppression of lung parenchymal growth similar to that of overall body growth. The peripheral airways may be less sensitive and the central airways more sensitive to the effect of corticosteroids on growth.\r"

With the use of a single inspiratory occlusion technique, we determined that when supine and awake, asthmatic patients were hyperinflated relative to normal controls (FRC = 3.46 +/- 0.18 and 2.95 +/- 0.13 liters, respectively; P less than 0.05). During sleep FRC decreased in both groups, but the decrease was significantly greater in asthmatic patients such that during rapid-eye-movement (REM) sleep FRC was equivalent between the asthmatic and normal groups (FRC = 2.46 +/- 0.23 and 2.45 +/- 0.09 liters, respectively). Specific pulmonary conductance decreased progressively and significantly in the asthmatic patients during the night, falling from 0.047 +/- 0.007 to 0.018 +/- 0.002 cmH2O-1.s-1 (P less than 0.01). There was a significant linear relationship through the night between FRC and pulmonary conductance in only two of the five asthmatic patients (r = 0.55 and 0.65, respectively). We conclude that 1) FRC falls during sleep in both normal subjects and asthmatic patients, 2) the hyperinflation observed in awake asthmatic patients is diminished during non-REM sleep and eliminated during REM sleep, and 3) sleep-associated reductions in FRC may contribute to but do not account for all the nocturnal increase in airflow resistance observed in asthmatic patients with nocturnal worsening.\r"

Physiol. 62: 2362-2370, 1987), and thromboxane A2 (TxA2), released from platelets, is responsible for these effects (Respir. Physiol. 71: 169-183, 1988). To investigate the involvement of vagal afferent fibers in these responses, we reversibly blocked signal conduction in the vagus of the cat by bilaterally cooling the vagus nerves to 1 degree C and measured the cardiorespiratory parameters in response to neutral acid-base infusion and infusion of the TxA2 mimetic U-46619. Vagal cooling before infusion caused tidal volume (VT) to increase and respiratory frequency (fresp) to decrease, whereby total ventilation (VE) was slightly enhanced, but did not affect right ventricular blood pressure (Prv). Infusion of neutral acid-base after vagal cooling prompted Prv to rise, on average from 35 Torr to a peak of 60 Torr, and a similar rise was elicited by infusion of U-46619. However, vagal cooling abolished any effect on VT or fresp of both acid-base and U-46619 infusion. After rewarming the vagus nerves, infusion of U-46619 caused fresp to increase and VT to decrease (rapid shallow breathing) with a concomitant rise in Prv, similar to what had been observed in the earlier studies. Our data suggest that the effects of TxA2 and of its mimetic U-46619 on respiration are mediated by the stimulation of vagal afferent fibers, whereas pulmonary hypertension is unrelated to vagal activity.\r"

Right atrial PO2 (PVO2)RA and hindlimb PO2 (PVO2)limb, measured at the level of the iliac bifurcation, were compared with tissue PO2 (PtiO2) histograms obtained with an array of surface microelectrodes placed over the biceps femoris muscle. Systemic O2 consumption (VO2) was measured with the expired gas method. Cardiac output and systemic O2 transport (TO2) were calculated. Six exchanges of blood for dextran produced decreases in hemoglobin from 10.8 +/- 0.4 to 2.7 +/- 0.2 g/dl (P less than 0.001). Critical TO2 (TO2crit), defined as the level of TO2 associated with initial decreases in control VO2, was similar for anemia and hypoxemia (40.5 +/- 5.6 and 40.1 +/- 5.3 ml.min-1.kg-1, respectively). At any given TO2 other than control TO2, the levels of (PVO2)RA and (PVO2)limb were greater in anemia than in hypoxemia (P less than 0.01), but the mean and the distribution of the PtiO2 histograms were similar in both conditions. Mean PtiO2 was significantly less than (PVO2)RA or (PVO2)limb, except for those values obtained during the control period. These results confirm our previous finding that PVO2 is not an accurate index of PtiO2 under conditions of tissue hypoxia. Furthermore, similar PtiO2 levels during anemia and hypoxemia suggest that VO2 is limited by decreases in O2 diffusion from the capillaries to the cells.\r"

The effect of DBcAMP was markedly gestation dependent, with the greatest effect observed in the most mature fetuses. In immature fetuses (less than 130 days, mean age 125 days) DBcAMP caused slowing of secretion, with maximal effect at 5 h. With increasing maturity the effect of DBcAMP was more pronounced and occurred earlier so that in mature fetuses (mean age 140 days) lung liquid absorption took place, with maximal effect at 2 h. Changes in lung liquid volume flow induced by DBcAMP could be blocked by addition of 10(-4) M amiloride to lung liquid. It is concluded that 1) DBcAMP induces a change in lung liquid secretion that, like epinephrine, is mediated via an increase in Na+ permeability of the apical membrane of the lung epithelium and 2) the rate-limiting step in the maturation of this process must lie beyond the generation of intracellular cAMP.\r"

Therefore 14 normal subjects performed incremental plantar flexion to exhaustion on 2 study days, the first for determination of LT and VT and the second for continuous 31P nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy of calf muscle. Exercising calf muscle pH fell precipitously at 66.4 +/- 3.4% (SE) of the maximum O2 uptake (VO2max) and was termed the intramuscular pH threshold. This did not occur at a significantly different metabolic rate from that at the LT (78.6 +/- 5.9% VO2max) or at the VT (75.0 +/- 4.1% VO2max, P = 0.15 by analysis of variance). Four subjects showed an intramuscular pH threshold and VT without a perceptible rise in forearm venous blood lactate. It is concluded that traditional markers of the \"anaerobic threshold,\" the LT and VT, occur as intramuscular pH becomes acid for a group of normal subjects undergoing incremental exercise to exhaustion. It is speculated that neuronal pathways linking intramuscular biochemical events to the ventilatory control center may explain the intact VT in those subjects without an \"intermediary\" LT.\r"

On the average, 75% of the change in chest wall volume occurred below the resting end-expiratory level. The expired volume resulted from a large predominance of RC displacement, and this was accompanied by marked recruitment of the TS. The EO was also generally activated, but the pattern of activation was less consistent. We conclude that 1) speech occurs primarily below the spontaneous end-expiratory level; 2) most of the volume change is caused by active emptying of the RC produced, at least in part, by contraction of the TS; 3) concomitant activation of the abdominal muscles serves to optimize the inspiratory function of the diaphragm, which has to contract rapidly between phrases to refill the respiratory system.\r"

P4 concentrations were significantly decreased in the group with disturbed menstrual function (P less than 0.05). Maximal aerobic capacity in the two athlete groups was similar.

Infants were studied at or around term (postconceptional age 43 +/- 8 wk). Spinal anesthesia produced a sensory block at the T2-T4 level, with concomitant motor block at a slightly lower level. This resulted in the loss of most intercostal muscle activity, whereas diaphragmatic function was preserved. Rib cage and abdominal displacements were measured with respiratory inductance plethysmography before and during spinal anesthesia. During the anesthetic, outward inspiratory rib cage motion decreased in six infants (P less than 0.02, paired t test); four of these developed paradoxical inward movement of the rib cage during inspiration. One infant, the most immature in the group, had inward movement of the rib cage both before and during the anesthetic. Abdominal displacements increased during spinal anesthesia in six of seven infants (P less than 0.05), suggesting an increase in diaphragmatic motion. We conclude that, in the group of infants studied, outward rib cage movement during awake tidal breathing requires active, coordinated intercostal muscle activity that is suppressed by spinal anesthesia.\r"

Exogenously administered cholinergic and adrenergic agents affect both ventilation and circulation. It is not clear whether these agents act in an independent or coordinate manner. beta-Adrenergic and alpha 2-adrenergic agents stimulate and depress the cardiorespiratory system, respectively. beta-Adrenergic and alpha 2-adrenergic agents stimulate and depress the production of adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (cAMP), respectively. Increased intracellular cAMP may facilitate the release of acetylcholine (ACh). This work seeks to answer the following questions: 1) Are the cardiorespiratory effects of adrenergic agents secondary to possible changes in ACh release? 2) Does cAMP production have an intermediate role? By means of ventriculocisternal perfusion in anesthetized (pentobarbital sodium, 30 mg/kg) spontaneously breathing dogs, isoproterenol (ISO) increased ventilation (VE) 75% (P less than 0.05); heart rate and cardiac output were also increased (P less than 0.05).

Moreover, several studies have shown that thiol-containing compounds can protect cardiac and striated skeletal muscle organelles from the deleterious effects of a number of physiological stresses. The purpose of the present study was to determine whether pretreatment with N-acetylcysteine (NAC), a thiol-containing compound, would attenuate the rate of development of diaphragmatic fatigue. Studies were performed with the use of an in situ rabbit diaphragm strip preparation that permitted direct and continuous measurement of diaphragm tension development. Diaphragm fatigue was induced by rhythmically stimulating strips to contract at 30/min (20-Hz trains) for 20 min. The diaphragm force-frequency relationship (10-, 20-, 50-, and 100-Hz stimuli) was assessed immediately before and after fatigue trials and then again 20 min into the period of recovery. Half the animals were treated with intravenous NAC before fatigue, whereas the remaining animals were given intravenous saline. The rate of development of fatigue was markedly greater in saline-treated control than in NAC-treated animals, with reductions in tension of 55 +/- 3 and 34 +/- 3%, respectively, in these two groups of animals over 20 min (P less than 0.001). Although rhythmic stimulation resulted in a downward shift in the force-frequency relationship in both NAC- and saline-treated animals, the magnitude of this shift was substantially greater in saline-treated animals (P less than 0.001).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In contrast, the crural region of the diaphragm showed no significant increase (P greater than 0.05) in oxidative capacity as a result of the training program (3.28 +/- 0.12 vs. 3.13 +/- 0.18). Furthermore, training did not alter (P less than 0.05) lactate dehydrogenase activity in the intercostals or in the crural or the costal diaphragm. These data demonstrate that the oxidative capacity of the costal diaphragm and the intercostal muscles can be enhanced by increasing respiratory loads via regular endurance exercise. We speculate that the lack of metabolic adaptation in the crural region of the diaphragm was not due to limited plasticity of the fibers in this area but to failure to the exercise-training program to provide the appropriate stimulus for cellular adaptation.\r"

Capillary filtration coefficient (Kf,c) increased and isogravimetric capillary pressure (Pc,i) decreased 3 h after perfusion with 10(-2) M PQ (n = 7) and 5 h after perfusion with 4 x 10(-3) M PQ (n = 6) but not with 10(-3) M PQ (n = 4). In hyperoxic lungs perfused with 4 x 10(-3) M PQ, Kf,c increased to nine times the base-line value 5 h after PQ [0.15 +/- 0.01 to 1.35 +/- 0.25 (SE) ml.min-1.cmH2O-1.100 g-1].

In hypoxic lungs perfused with 4 x 10(-3) M PQ (n = 5), Pc,i and Kf,c changes were not significantly different from those in normoxic lungs treated with PQ. Thus both hyperoxia and an increased dose of PQ shortened the latent period and increased the severity of the PQ-induced microvascular permeability lesion, but hypoxia failed to prevent the PQ damage.\r"

The MBNW were characterized by the mean dilution number (MDN) derived by a moment analysis. The Zrs spectra were characterized by the minimum resistance (Rmin), the drop in resistance (Rdrop) from 4 Hz to Rmin, and the first resonance frequency (Fr1). Measurements were repeated after bronchodilation in three normal and all asthmatic subjects. Before bronchodilation, six of the asthmatic subjects showed close to normal FEV1. The Zrs in the normal subjects showed low Rmin (1.9 +/- 0.7 cmH2O.l-1.s), Rdrop (0.4 +/- 0.4), and Fr1 (10 +/- 2 Hz). Four of the mildly obstructed asthmatic subjects had normal Zrs but elevated MDNs (i.e., abnormal ventilation distribution). The other six asthmatic subjects had significantly elevated Rmin (4.1 +/- 0.8), Rdrop (6.3 +/- 5.8), and Fr1 (34 +/- 0.4 Hz) and elevated MDNs. The CF patients had elevated Zrs features and MDNs. After bronchodilation, no changes in FEV1, MDN, or Zrs occurred in the normal subjects. All asthmatic subjects showed increased FEV1 and decreased MDN, but the Zrs was unaltered in the four asthmatic subjects whose base-line Zrs was normal. For the other six asthmatic subjects, there were large decreases in the Rmin, Rdrop, and Fr1. Finally, there was a poor correlation between the MDN and the Zrs features but high correlation between the Zrs features alone. These results imply that significant nonuniform peripheral airway obstruction can exist such that ventilation distribution is abnormal but Zrs from 4 to 60 Hz is not. Abnormalities in Zrs from 4 to 60 Hz occur only after significant overall obstruction in the peripheral and more central airways. Combining Zrs and the MBNW may permit us to infer whether the disease is predominantly in the lung periphery or in the more central airways.\r"

  ".W": "We studied the effects of altered ventilatory drives on the activity of the whole phrenic nerve and single phrenic motoneurons in dogs anesthetized with alpha-chloralose and paralyzed with gallamine triethiodide. Single phrenic motoneurons were classified as either late-onset or early-onset motoneurons (LOM and EOM, respectively), depending on the time of onset of their activity during inspiration. Increase in ventilatory drive was induced by altering chemical drive with changes in arterial blood gases and also by altering the vagal afferent contribution to ventilatory drive. The latter was accomplished by inducing pulmonary gas embolism (PGE) during hyperoxia. Whole phrenic nerve activity was increased by both types of increase in ventilatory drive. In both cases, changes in the firing pattern of LOMs and EOMs were responsible for the increased phrenic output. The changes in post-PGE firing pattern of the LOMs generally consisted of a shift in the time of onset to an earlier point in inspiration and an increase in the number of spikes per inspiratory cycle. Vagotomy abolished the difference between the contributions of LOMs and EOMs to the phrenic response to PGE. Data from dogs studied while they were breathing spontaneously were qualitatively the same as those from the paralyzed animals, indicating no major role for phasic volume feedback in these responses. Our data regarding altered chemical drive are similar to those reported earlier in other species, whereas those regarding PGE demonstrate that vagally mediated increases in ventilatory drive affect both LOMs and EOMs, although LOMs are affected to a greater degree.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

We studied nine normal subjects to assess the influence of passive thoracopulmonary inflation and deflation on nasal and pharyngeal resistances. With the subjects lying in an iron lung, lung volumes were changed by application of an extrathoracic pressure (Pet) from 0 to 20 (+Pet) or -20 cmH2O (-Pet) in 5-cmH2O steps. Upper airway pressures were measured with two low-bias flow catheters, one at the tip of the epiglottis and the other in the posterior nasopharynx. Breath-by-breath resistance measurements were made at an inspiratory flow rate of 300 ml/s at each Pet step. Total upper airway, nasal, and pharyngeal resistances increased with +Pet [i.e., nasal resistance = 139.6 +/- 14.4% (SE) of base-line and pharyngeal resistances = 189.7 +/- 21.1% at 10 cmH2O of +Pet]. During -Pet there were no significant changes in nasal resistance, whereas pharyngeal resistance decreased significantly (pharyngeal resistance = 73.4 +/- 7.4% at -10 cmH2O). We conclude that upper airway resistance, particularly the pharyngeal resistance, is influenced by passive changes in lung volumes, especially pulmonary deflation.\r"

Protein flux across the lung increased sixfold 48 h after inhalation of the products of incomplete cotton combustion, whereas tracheal protein flux increased fivefold 8 h after exposure and returned to near base line 48 h after exposure. The lung and trachea selectively retained some sieving to three different protein macromolecules with molecular radii of 36, 54, and 123 A. In the lungs the sieving selectivity for these macromolecules was least 48 h after injury, and in the trachea molecular selectivity was least 8 h after injury. These data suggest that the time course of microvascular injury differs for the trachea and the lung; microvascular changes are detected earlier in the trachea than in the lung. The inhalation injury described thus permits the characterization of the time course of airway and lung microvascular changes.\r"

We examined the relationship between stress wave velocities and lung density. A saline-filled reservoir was connected to the vessels of caudal dog lobes held inflated at 5 cmH2O transpulmonary pressure, and vascular volume and extravascular lung water were increased in steps by increasing vascular pressure. At each step, we measured the transmitted signals at locations 2 and 7 cm from an impulse surface distortion by means of microphones embedded in the lung surface. Longitudinal and transverse wave velocities were computed by using cross-correlation analysis of microphone signal pairs. Both wave velocities decreased as lung density increased: as a first approximation, wave velocities were inversely proportional to the square root of lung density. This behavior is consistent with the propagation of small-amplitude stress waves through an elastic continuum. Estimated bulk and shear moduli were 26 and 3.5 cmH2O, respectively, and were consistent with results from quasi-static deformation tests.\r"

LH-induced augmentation of already high exertional work of breathing resulted in diminished locomotor exercise capacity so that maximal exercise in LH ponies occurred at 25 km/h compared with 32 km/h for normal ponies. The costal and crural regions received similar Q in both groups at rest. However, exercise-induced increments in perfusion were significantly greater in the costal region of the diaphragm. At 25 km/h, costal diaphragmatic perfusion was 154 and 143% of the crural diaphragmatic Q in normal and LH ponies. At 32 km/h, Q in costal diaphragm of normal ponies was 136% of that in the crural region. Costal and crural diaphragmatic Q in LH ponies exercised at 25 km/h exceeded that for normal ponies but was similar to the latter during exercise at 32 km/h. Perfusion pressure for the three conditions was also similar. It is concluded that diaphragmatic perfusion heterogeneity in exercising ponies was preserved during the added stress of inspiratory resistive breathing. It was also demonstrated that vascular resistance in the crural and costal regions of the diaphragm in maximally exercised LH ponies remained similar to that in maximally exercising normal ponies.\r"

Therefore blood flow to the trachea and bronchi (up to 7th generation of branching) was studied in seven healthy adult ponies at rest and during the 3rd and 10th min of exercise performed at a treadmill speed setting of 25 km/h. The ambient air temperature varied from 19 to 20 degrees C and humidity from 35 to 45%. To determine blood flow radionuclide-labeled 15-microns-diameter microspheres were injected into the left ventricle via a catheter advanced from the left carotid artery (exposed using local anesthesia), and a reference sample was obtained from the aorta. Adequate mixing of microspheres with blood was demonstrated by similar perfusion values for left and right kidneys. Exercise increased heart rate (194 +/- 9 and 200 +/- 7 beats/min) and mean aortic pressure (169 +/- 8 and 156 +/- 4 mmHg) of ponies at 3rd and 10th min. Tracheal blood flow (6.7 +/- 0.5 ml.min-1 x 100 g-1) of resting ponies was only one-third of the bronchial blood flow (21.6 +/- 4.9 ml.min-1 x 100 g-1) Significant changes in tracheal perfusion did not occur at 3rd or 10th min of exercise. Although bronchial perfusion also did not change at the 3rd min of exercise, it rose dramatically to 202.8 +/- 30.3 ml.min-1 x 100 g-1 during the 10th min. Concomitantly, renal blood flow decreased at 10th min of exertion. The large increase in bronchial blood flow at 10th min of exertion may have been necessitated by the need to help dissipate body heat.\r"

The chests of nine dogs anesthetized with alpha-chloralose were opened, and the lungs were ventilated by a phrenic nerve-driven servo-respirator. The immediate effects of a 50% reduction in end-expiratory transpulmonary pressure (EEPtp) from control (EEVL equivalent to functional residual capacity) were to significantly increase both tidal volume (VT) and breathing frequency (f) from 0.402 +/- 0.101 to 0.453 +/- 0.091 liter (mean +/- SD) and 11.8 +/- 5.4 to 15.7 +/- 6.4 breaths/min, respectively (P less than 0.05). Further reductions in EEPtp to 0 cmH2O did not change VT but augmented f to 19.6 +/- 6.6 breaths/min (P less than 0.05). The increase in f as EEVL decreased was due entirely to a reduction in expiratory time. Vagotomy abolished these reflexes. By 90 s after reduction in EEVL, arterial PCO2 fell significantly and VT returned to or below control values. We therefore repeated these experiments in five dogs whose blood gases were controlled by cardiopulmonary bypass. There were no secondary changes in VT and by 90 s breathing pattern could be characterized as rapid and deep. In another eight dogs submitted to the same collapse protocol, we recorded action potentials from all known categories of pulmonary vagal afferents. These studies demonstrated that the changes in breathing pattern induced by a 50% reduction in EEPtp were due to a withdrawal of slowly adapting stretch receptor activity; however, continued increases in f as EEVL was reduced further were due to increases in rapidly adapting stretch receptor activity.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The master athletes had been training for 10.2 +/- 2.9 yr before initial testing and continued to train during the follow-up period. The sedentary subjects' VO2max declined by an average of 3.3 ml.kg-1.min-1 (33.9 +/- 1.7 vs. 30.6 +/- 1.6, P less than 0.001) over the course of the study, a decline of 12% per decade. In these subjects maximal heart rate declined 8 beats/min (171 vs. 163) and maximal O2 pulse decreased from 0.20 to 0.18 ml.kg-1.beat (P less than 0.05). The master athletes' VO2 max decreased by an average of 2.2 ml.kg-1.min-1 (54.0 +/- 1.7 vs. 51.8 +/- 1.8, P less than 0.05), a 5.5% decline per decade. The master athletes' maximal heart rate was unchanged (171 +/- 3 beats/min) and their maximal O2 pulse decreased from 0.32 to 0.30 ml.kg-1.beat (P less than 0.05). These findings provide evidence that the age-related decrease in VO2max of master athletes who continue to engage in regular vigorous endurance exercise training is approximately one-half the rate of decline seen in age-matched sedentary subjects. Furthermore our results suggest that endurance exercise training may reduce the rate of decline in maximal heart rate that typically occurs as an individual ages.\r"

Both muscle fiber length, represented by the distance between implanted radiopaque markers, and WZapp were measured from digitized recordings of fluoroscopic images utilizing interactive computer software. The WZapp was highly correlated with the length of costal fibers during active respiration in all animals (mean R2 = 0.94). The accuracy in the prediction of fiber length and shortening during breathing is enhanced by inclusion of additional variables describing the displacement of the abdominal wall and the resting geometric orientation of the fibers. We conclude that dynamic fluoroscopic measurement of WZapp is a valuable technique for estimating dynamic diaphragm fiber length and shortening. Depending on the experimental circumstances, WZapp may be a more easily acquired indicator of diaphragm shortening than other variables that have been previously utilized. As such, it may provide a suitable approach to assess active shortening of the diaphragm in humans.\r"

These levels were chosen to separate peripheral vascular responses associated with stimulation of low- and high-pressure baroreceptors. Four monkeys had efferent and afferent cardiac denervation by use of the Randall procedure with pharmacological (phenylephrine and atropine) verification. Animals were studied 3 wk after surgery to avoid reinnervation. Findings were compared with those of four identically treated intact animals. Denervated animals showed no change in RABFV or HR during low-level LBNP; however, HR increased significantly (P less than 0.05) when LBNP reached -50 mmHg and blood flow velocity also fell (P less than 0.05) starting at -30 mmHg pressure. In contrast, intact animals showed steady decreases in RABFV during both high- and low-pressure protocols, with HR showing a 6-beat/min increase (P less than 0.05) starting at -20 mmHg pressure. As with denervated animals, intact animals showed a more pronounced increase in HR after reaching a level of -60 mmHg suction. Cardiac output (electromagnetic flowmeter, ascending aorta) fell significantly in both groups starting at -30 mmHg pressure. Left ventricular pressure (Konigsberg pressure cell) in three intact animals showed a progressive fall in systolic pressure starting at -10 mmHg suction, which became significant at -55 mmHg pressure. These results demonstrate that cardiac denervation by use of the Randall technique significantly affects RABFV and HR responses to LBNP in rhesus monkeys. The lack of RABFV change during LBNP in denervated animals suggests that these changes coupled with HR response can be used as an effective method to verify the completeness of denervation of low-pressure baroreceptors in animals that have undergone intrapericardial denervation.\r"

The present studies were carried out to test these hypotheses. Fetal lambs were prepared with indwelling vascular catheters and tracheal catheters for access to lung liquid. We measured lung liquid levels of leukotrienes C4 (LTC4) and D4 (LTD4) in control unanesthetized fetal lambs with blood gases and pH in the normal range. In the control series, LTC4 and LTD4 were either not detectable or their levels were close to the limit of resolution (LTC4, less than 80 pg/ml; LTD4, less than 50 pg/ml) of the techniques utilized. Leukotriene E4 was measured in a separate study by using pooled samples, and it was also found to be below the detection limit of that assay (10 pg/ml). In a second series of animals, a level of acute hypoxia was induced to decrease fetal arterial PO2 to 12 Torr for 20 min. After hypoxia, tracheal fluid levels of leukotrienes were again below detection limits of the assays used (LTC4, less than 80 pg/ml; LTD4, less than 142 pg/ml). In another study, methodology was altered to lower the detection limits of leukotrienes in lung fluid and to allow the measurement of total peptidoleukotriene concentrations. In this study, even when hypoxia was extended for up to 1 h, leukotriene levels were consistently below the limit of detection of the assay (less than 20 pg/ml for the sum of all leukotrienes).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "In normal humans and dogs, the airways do not constrict to closure even when maximally stimulated. However, airway closure can be produced in isolated canine lobes and bronchial segments that are stimulated with maximal concentrations of bronchoconstrictors. These observations suggest that under normal conditions, physiological mechanisms to limit bronchoconstriction exist in vivo. In this investigation, we evaluated how mechanical factors that influence airway smooth muscle contractility contribute to the modulation of the pressure-volume characteristics of contracted canine intraparenchymal airways in vitro. Our results demonstrated that maximal and even submaximal contractile stimuli can produce airway closure in bronchi that are allowed to contract under isobaric conditions. However, the effectiveness of bronchoconstrictors is significantly reduced when the airways are subjected to tidal volume oscillations during contraction. In addition, airways contracted isovolumetrically at low volumes exhibit a markedly reduced sensitivity to submaximal concentrations of acetylcholine. This may limit bronchoconstriction at low lung volumes and transpulmonary pressures where the effectiveness of parenchymal stress in keeping the airways open is reduced. Together these factors could provide a mechanism by which bronchoconstriction is limited to low levels of airway resistance under normal conditions in vivo.\r"

  ".W": "We investigated the quasi-static pressure-volume (P-V) hysteresis of the normal canine lung in vivo by performing 15-s flow interruptions at various points throughout the breathing cycle in mechanically ventilated anesthetized paralyzed dogs. By measuring the transpulmonary pressure (Ptp) at 5 s after each interruption, we built up a quasi-static P-V loop of the lungs. We found, however, that the area of the loop was significantly smaller (by a factor of 4-6) than has been reported by others for the isolated canine lung. We also found the hysteresis loop area of the chest wall to be of similar magnitude. If we measured Ptp 10-15 s after interruption, we found it always decreased at a rate expected to result from continuing gas exchange in the lungs. We conclude that 1) the areas of the quasi-static P-V loop in vivo for the total respiratory system, as well as the lungs and chest wall separately, are significantly smaller than has been reported previously for isolated lungs and 2) continuing gas exchange in the lungs places a lower limit on the frequencies (equivalent to flow interruptions of greater than 5- to 7-s duration) at which the P-flow-V behavior of the lungs in vivo can be considered in purely mechanical terms.\r"

However, little is known about the intrinsic properties of the pharyngeal muscles and how they relate to the intrinsic properties of the diaphragm. In the present study, the fiber subtype distributions of two pharyngeal dilator muscles, the geniohyoid and the sternohyoid, were ascertained histochemically in the cat. The geniohyoid and the sternohyoid muscles had a preponderance of fast glycolytic (FG) fibers (mean 48 and 55%, respectively), a smaller number of fast oxidative-glycolytic (FOG) fibers (mean 36 and 31%, respectively), and few slow oxidative (SO) fibers (mean 16 and 14%, respectively). The percentages of SO fibers of both hyoid muscles were significantly (P less than 0.01) lower than that of the costal diaphragm, and the percentages of FOG and FG fibers were significantly higher than that of the diaphragm. In conclusion, the geniohyoid and sternohyoid muscles have histochemical characteristics usually associated with fast contraction and intermediate endurance properties.\r"

  ".W": "Changes in respiratory mechanical loads are readily detected by humans. Although it is widely believed that respiratory muscle afferents serve as the primary source of information for load detection, there is, in fact, no convincing evidence to support this belief. We developed a shell that encloses the body, excluding the head and neck. A special loading apparatus altered pressure in proportion to respired volume (elastic load) in one of three ways: 1) at the mouth only (T), producing a conventional load in which respiratory muscles are loaded and airway and intrathoracic pressures are made negative in proportion to volume, 2) both at the mouth and in the shell (AW), where the same pattern of airway and intrathoracic pressure occurs but the muscles are not loaded because Prs (i.e., mouth pressure minus pressure in the shell is unchanged, and 3) positive pressure in proportion to volume at the shell only, loading the chest wall but causing no change in airway or thoracic pressures (CW). The threshold for detection (delta E50) with the three types of application was determined in seven normal subjects: 2.16 +/- 0.22, 2.65 +/- 0.54, and 6.21 +/- 0.85 (SE) cmH2O/l for T, AW, and CW, respectively. Therefore the active chest wall, including muscles, is a much less potent source of information than structures affected by the negative airway and intrathoracic pressure. The latter account for the very low threshold for load detection.\r"

Among the many issues faced by AIDS patients, their families, and their caregivers are impending death, dependency, disfigurement, physical and emotional isolation, contagiousness, secrecy, changes in lifestyle, financial responsibility, discrimination, and burnout. Although these issues are not unique to AIDS patients, they are accentuated because more of them are likely to occur. Some ways that clinicians can help mitigate the impact of these issues are by correcting misinformation that patients and caregivers may have, improving the coordination of community services and support groups, encouraging patients to maintain control over their lives and establish a network of support contacts, being alert to repressed patient/caregiver reactions, understanding the therapeutic value of humor, and encouraging the expression of deep emotions such as grief, guilt, and anger.\r"

It is also a real risk to health care personnel, who must remember and adhere to universal precautions against blood-borne disease to prevent accidental infection on the job. At the same time they must not in any way deny proper and compassionate care, which all patients deserve, whatever their HIV status. Dermatologists, in particular, must be alert to early signs (often cutaneous) of HIV infection, and must be careful to take precautions against infection because many dermatologic procedures expose them to risk. The hopeful news is that early diagnosis of HIV infection and effective therapy with Zidovudine and other agents may prevent development of symptomatic infection and prolong the lives of HIV-infected patients, perhaps indefinitely. In future, physicians must consider HIV disease a chronic problem to be treated with the same care and attention, in hopes of promoting long-term survival, as diabetes or heart disease.\r"

To investigate a possible relation between these ulcers and symptoms, we followed for 4 weeks 40 patients with portal hypertension who had received a single course of intravariceal sclerotherapy. All 40 patients were found to have mucosal variceal ulcers on the day after sclerotherapy. One or more symptoms were given by 26 (65%) patients; dysphagia by 53% (mean duration 4.6 +/- 2.2 days), retrosternal pain by 28% (mean duration 3.0 +/- 2.5 days), and fever by 15% (mean duration 2.1 +/- 0.4 days). A gastric variceal ulcer was responsible for bleeding in one (2.2%) patient. We found no correlation between the occurrence and duration of symptoms and the presence of variceal ulcers. While symptoms were transient, ulcers persisted for several days to weeks in most patients. Patients who had received a higher amount of sclerosant developed larger ulcers (greater than 1 cm) with more symptoms and healing was more delayed than in those who had received lesser amounts and developed smaller ulcers (less than 1 cm). In patients with a serum albumin level greater than 3.0 g/dl, ulcers healed more often than in those with a less than 3.0 g/dl albumin (72 versus 18%, p less than 0.05). Development of mucosal ulcers is a natural consequence of intravariceal sclerotherapy and it appears unrelated to symptoms. The chemical nature and the volume of the injected sclerosant are probably responsible for the symptoms after sclerotherapy. Further, postsclerotherapy ulcers heal spontaneously, more often in patients with good nutritional status.\r"

Indications for Az were: inability to wean off steroids without symptoms of CUC (12/20), poor response to steroids (7/20), and steroid toxicity (1/20). Responses to Az occurred in 15/20 courses (12/16 patients). Two patients had side effects requiring Az discontinuation. The mean duration of follow-up was 52.6 months with no incidence of malignancies.

  ".W": "Collagenous colitis is a rare condition characterized clinically by chronic diarrhea and histologically by a thickened subepithelial collagenous band in colonic biopsies in an endoscopically normal colon. Familial occurrence of collagenous colitis has to our knowledge never been described. Here we report two families in which two first-degree related members suffered from collagenous colitis. In one family, two sisters were affected by chronic diarrhea and autoimmune disorders such as thyroid disease, rheumatoid arthritis, and pernicious anemia. Collagenous colitis was diagnosed in one of these sisters, based on colonic biopsies. Colonic biopsies of the other sister showed microscopic colitis. Review of colonic biopsies of this patient taken 11 years earlier, however, showed definite histological features of collagenous colitis. In the other family, in a father and son, both with diarrhea for several years but not suffering from any other diseases, a diagnosis of collagenous colitis was made on colonic biopsies. Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) typing showed that only the HLA A2 antigen was present in all 4 patients.\r"

  ".U": "90300137\r", 
  ".W": "In a prospective study of 22 patients with solitary rectal ulcer, we tried to define the features of this condition, especially the associated systemic features, that may give some clues to its etiopathogenesis. In 15 of these patients a single rectal ulcer was found, whereas in seven patients two ulcers were present in each. Of the total 29 ulcers in these patients, 19 were located on the anterior or anterolateral wall of the rectum and 10 were on the posterior or posterolateral wall. The sigmoidoscopic appearance of the ulcer was quite characteristic, yet a biopsy was considered essential to rule out other pathologic processes. Histological features of the solitary rectal ulcer comprised fibrous obliteration of the lamina propria with disorientation of the muscularis mucosa and extension of muscle fibers into the lamina propria. Evident rectal prolapse was present in only three patients. Recurrent oral ulcerations occurred in four (18.2%) patients and erythema nodosum in one of them (4.5%). Sacroiliitis was present in six of 19 (31%) patients studied radiologically, and human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-B27 occurred in four of the 20 patients (20%) tested for HLA class I antigens. All the four HLA-B27-positive patients had associated sacroiliitis and showed good response to sulfasalazine. These associations raise the possibility that solitary rectal ulcers may be a part of a systemic disease or of several diseases with varied etiology.\r"

  ".W": "We reviewed retrospectively a cohort of 80 patients with hyperemesis gravidarum hospitalized between 1976 and 1986 for the presence of abnormal liver enzymes and ketonuria. Thirteen (16%) had abnormal liver enzymes, generally less than four times the upper limit of normal. In this group, hyperemesis gravidarum began at the 14th week of pregnancy as compared to the 6th week in the normal enzyme group (p less than 0.01). Both groups were similar with regard to age, number of children and pregnancies, and duration of vomiting. Ketonuria was significantly more severe (p less than 0.01) in the abnormal enzyme group, implying a more severe state of starvation and dehydration. The correlation coefficient between the degree of ketonuria and level of liver enzymes was low for alkaline phosphatase (r = 0.18), GPT (r = 0.15), and GOT (r = 0.28). The concept that dehydration and starvation are important factors for the induction of liver cell injury is supported by our data. Lack of correlation between the degree of ketonuria and liver enzyme levels is suggestive of other mechanisms (hormonal, genetic) that may interact to produce transaminasemia.\r"

Except for fatigue and edema, symptoms of congestive heart failure were absent and no history of dyspnea, orthopnea, or paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea could be elicited. Hepatomegaly was present in both patients, but neck venous distension and hypotension were not apparent, and both patients were able to lie flat. The diagnosis of cardiomyopathy was made by echocardiogram showing global hypokinesis and low ejection fractions; right atrial pressures were markedly increased. Liver biopsies demonstrated centrilobular necrosis and congestion. Treatment for heart failure led to a prompt response in both patients with rapid return of all hepatic parameters toward normal. Paradoxically, our patients had striking evidence of hepatic failure and a notable absence of symptoms and signs of congestive heart failure. An awareness of this unique presentation may avoid prolonged evaluations in such critically ill patients.\r"

We postulate that the abrupt rise in pressure in the intraluminal esophagus, the inlet of which was obstructed by a tightly fitting instrument, was responsible for the rupture.\r"

We describe a patient who developed jaundice after receiving tetrahydroaminoacridine for three weeks. Histologic examination showed extensive hepatocellular necrosis. Tetrahydroaminoacridine withdrawal was followed by the disappearance of jaundice within a few days and complete recovery within 5 weeks. This case shows that tetrahydroaminoacridine administration can induce marked liver cell necrosis resulting in symptomatic acute hepatitis.\r"

Replacement immunoglobulin treatment failed to restore normal serum immunoglobulin levels, but despite this, they appeared to be of value in reducing the liability to recurrent giardiasis. We discuss the use of immunoglobulin supplementation in this condition and the frequent association between CVH and pentagastrinfast achlorhydria.\r"
