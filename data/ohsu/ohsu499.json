BR was assessed by a histamine provocation test. The following indices of BR were used: (1) a histamine threshold both at 10 and at 20% decreases in FEV1 (PC10 and PC20); (2) the concentration causing a 10 or a 20% decrease estimated by linear interpolation (IPC10 and IPC20), and by linear regression of all data points (PD10 and PD20); (3) the slope of the linear regression line through all data points (SAP) and the slope of the line through the origin and the last data point (SOL). Disease was defined as the self-reported presence of respiratory symptoms from a respiratory symptom questionnaire. Bronchial challenge was considered as a test to predict symptom prevalence. Receiver-operator characteristic curves were applied to define optimal cutoff points for each of the indices used to define a positive and a negative test. For each index, sensitivity, specificity, predictive value of a positive and negative test, and efficiency rate of the test were calculated. The overall distribution of BR in this population appeared to be log normal for the different continuous indices. Subjects with symptoms were on the more responsive tail of the distribution. After adjusting for age, sex, smoking habit, and level of pulmonary function, the mean log-transformed values of PD10, PD20, SAP, and SOL for the various symptom groups differed significantly.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Our method utilizes a series of intratracheal instillations of Ascaris suum-coated sepharose 4B beads (3 x 10(5] administered once a week for four weeks. Five cynomolgus monkeys (Macaca fascicularis) demonstrating a naturally occurring skin and respiratory sensitivity to Ascaris suum extract were studied. Airway cell composition was measured by bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), and airway responsiveness was determined as the bronchoconstrictor response to inhaled methacholine. Ascaris suum bead administration resulted in a transient increase in total cells recovered by BAL (2.4 +/- 0.4 to 8.7 +/- 2.5 x 10(5) cells/ml, p less than 0.05) and a selective increase in BAL eosinophils (17 +/- 6 to 916 +/- 158 x 10(3) cells/ml, p less than 0.05). Increases in airway responsiveness were concurrent with the increase in airway eosinophils. These observations show that airway eosinophilia is associated with airway hyperresponsiveness in primates. Furthermore, this new model is a novel experimental system in which the underlying mechanisms in the pathogenesis of airway hyperresponsiveness can be investigated.\r"

During a 2-yr period, 204 nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPA) from children under 4 yr of age living in an orphanage and exhibiting febrile ALRI were studied by both indirect immunofluorescence (IIF) and isolation in four cell lines. NPA cell smears as well as tissue culture cells exhibiting cytopathic effect (CPE) or hemadsorption were stained by IIF for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), adenovirus, influenza A and B, and parainfluenza 1 and 3. Viral etiology was demonstrated in 21.2% of acute respiratory infection cases. The most frequently detected virus was RSV (53.5% of viral positive diagnoses), followed by unidentified viruses (18.6%), adenovirus (13.9%), influenza A (7%), and parainfluenza 3 (4.7%). The most common clinical entities were: bronchitis, 46.1%; pneumonia, 24%; bronchiolitis, 22%; and multifocal pneumonia, 8%. Malnourishment was found in 56% of children with ALRI, whereas 50% was found among total orphanage population. The 3 to 8-month-old age group accounted for half of all ALRI cases. Viral etiology was shown for 26.5% of patients with pneumonia, 22% with bronchitis, and 16% with bronchiolitis. RSV and adenovirus occurred in fall and winter, while parainfluenza 3 was detected in early spring. In the two fatal cases observed, histologic lesions were compatible with adenovirus infection, but this virus could be isolated from the lung in only one case.\r"

  ".W": "The effect of applied positive airway pressure or PEEP on pericardial pressure was examined in closed-chest, anesthetized dogs with normal lungs and in animals with oleic acid-induced lung injury. Both groups were studied before and after vascular volume loading by dextran infusion. Pericardial pressure was measured using an air-filled flat balloon placed along the lateral left ventricular free wall within the pericardial space. A linear relation between right atrial pressure (RAP) and pericardial pressure (PP) was found (RAP = 3.9 + 0.78 PP, r = 0.76, p less than 0.01) that was independent of acute lung injury but was influenced by the application of PEEP. In the baseline volume condition, pericardial pressure increased linearly with an increase in PEEP to 15 cm H2O. After volume loading, pericardial pressure increased fourfold, but, surprisingly, did not change with applied PEEP. These relations were similar in the two groups despite a reduction in total respiratory system compliance in the oleic acid group. This suggests that transmission of airway pressure to the pericardial surface is independent of the presence of acute lung injury and that changes in pericardial pressure in response to PEEP reflect both the transmission of airway pressure to the pericardial surface and, presumably, PEEP-related changes in cardiac volume and ventricular compliance.\r"

Human isolated bronchi respond to neurokinin A (NKA), substance P (SP), and neurokinin B (NKB) with dose-dependent contractions. The order of potency of the three natural neurokinins is NKA greater than SP greater than NKB, suggesting the presence of NK-2 receptors. To further characterize the neurokinin receptors in human bronchi, we used selective agonists for each receptor type (i.e., NK-1, NK-2, and NK-3). In fact, NK-1 selective compounds, [Pro9]SP(1-11) sulfone and [beta-ala4,Sar9]SP(4-11) sulfone, did not induce significant contractions up to 10(-5) M. Similarly, the selective agonist for the NK-3 receptor, [MePhe7]NKB(4-10), was almost inactive. However, the NK-2 selective fragment [Nle]NKA(4-10) was a potent stimulant. The negative log of the peptide concentration that caused 50% of maximal effect (pD2) was 6.99 for NKA and 6.12 for [Nle10]NKA(4-10). Removal of the epithelium significantly enhanced the contractile responses to the three neurokinins and also to the NK-2 selective agonist. Phosphoramidon, an enkephalinase inhibitor, was more potent than epithelium removal in enhancing the contractile responses to these agonists. However, epithelium removal and phosphoramidon did not increase the weak responses to the NK-1 and NK-3 selective compounds. In the presence of phosphoramidon, removal of the epithelium slightly enhanced the contractile responses to NKA and [Nle]NKA(4-10) but not to SP and NKB.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

A characteristic tension-radius curve was described for each airway having two phases (different elastances). Substantial heterogeneity was demonstrated in the passive characteristics of these airways; compliance increased progressively with advancing airway generation. Changes in airway caliber elicited with intravenous infusion of methacholine (MCh) were used to calculate active force translated to airway wall tensions, and radius-tension (approximately equal to length-tension) curves were calculated for each airway after correcting for wall thickness. The resting smooth muscle length at which maximal active tension (ATmax) was elicited for each generation (expressed as percent of the initial radius; %Ri) was similar for all generations (147 +/- 7.32% for Generation 2 to 160 +/- 8.82 for Generation 5). However, ATmax decreased with advancing airway generation from 6.58 +/- 1.51 dyne/cm (Generation 2, extraparenchymal) to 1.60 +/- 0.13 dyne/cm (Generation 5, intraparenchymal; p less than 0.001). Relative change in airway diameter nonetheless was greater in smaller airways (28.2 +/- 5.1% in Generation 5) than in larger airways (15.8 +/- 3.5% in Generation 2; p less than 0.001). These data indicate that increased narrowing of more distal airways in the dog results predominantly from mechanical advantage related to smaller Ri and/or greater compressibility rather than to greater force translation from airway smooth muscle contraction, as suggested by prior investigations.\r"

Using magnetic resonance imaging and a computer program utilizing a digitizing pad, we measured these awake subjects' pharyngeal volumes without and with the nasal CPAP apparatus on at the level used to abolish their snoring.

Specific immunofluorescence was used to determine the percentage of infected leukocytes. The results indicated that monocytes were the most susceptible human leukocyte to in vitro infection with RSV. Polymorphonuclear leukocytes demonstrated no specific fluorescent staining after 24 h of exposure to RSV, whereas peripheral blood nonadherent mononuclear cells demonstrated a low percentage of positive cells, with a mean of 6 +/- 1% SE. In contrast, 37 +/- 5% of monocytes expressed RSV antigen after viral exposure. Exposure of monocytes to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) for 1 h prior to RSV increased the percentage of infected cells to 48 +/- 6% and stimulated their secretion of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and alpha tumor necrosis factor (TNF). Intrinsic mononuclear phagocytic factors influencing the permissiveness to RSV were studied by determining infection of adult and cord blood and alveolar mononuclear phagocytes (MP). Alveolar and blood MP simultaneously isolated from adult donors were similarly infected by RSV, which varied with the viral dose. Cord blood MP were more susceptible to RSV infection than were adult MP, 58 +/- 9% infected versus 37 +/- 5%, respectively (p less than 0.05). Treatment with LPS for 1 h prior to RSV exposure did not increase infection of cord blood MP as seen with adult blood MP. However, LPS can induce human monocytes to secrete cytokines with antiviral activity, and our results indicate that both gamma interferon and TNF, independently or in combination, prevented infection of monocytes in a dose-dependent manner.\r"

The single-lung transplantation is reversed for patients with pulmonary fibrosis. Patients with emphysema are thought to be unsuitable for single-lung transplantation because of the ventilation-perfusion imbalance that is supposed to occur, the ventilation being preferentially distributed to the native lung when the perfusion is distributed to the transplanted lung. We now report a preliminary success with single-lung transplantation in two consecutive patients with end-stage pulmonary emphysema. Despite the persistence after transplantation of an obstructive syndrome, the clinical status was good, the blood gases were markedly improved, and ventilation-perfusion imbalance did not occur on lung scans. After discharge from the hospital, the patients could return to an almost normal life. Thus, our data support the feasibility of single-lung transplantation in patients with end-stage pulmonary emphysema, and we consider that single-lung transplantation could be the optimal form of lung transplantation in these patients.\r"

Clinically, this disorder should be suspected in a patient who presents with pulmonary hypertension, hemoptysis, a reticulonodular infiltrate on chest radiograph, a lung scan showing inhomogeneously enhanced perfusion (particularly in the lower lobes), and pulmonary angiography showing increased peripheral vascularity corresponding to both the radiographic infiltrate and the areas of enhanced perfusion on lung scan. Histologic features consist of nodular proliferation of capillary-sized vessels that infiltrate the pulmonary interstitium, vascular walls, and lumens as well as the alveolar septa. The vascular invasion results in a secondary veno-occlusive phenomenon that explains the clinical confusion with pulmonary veno-occlusive disease.\r"

  ".U": "89391190\r", 
  ".W": "Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) may be defined as a process characterized by the presence of chronic bronchitis or emphysema that may lead to the development of airways obstruction; airways obstruction need not be present at all stage of the process and may be partially reversible. The pathologic changes in the lungs due to smoking affect three regions: the bronchi, bronchioles, and parenchyma. The bronchi show enlargement of the submucosal glands with dilation of their ducts; infiltration with neutrophils and lymphocytes is present but not prominent. Respiratory bronchiolitis is observed in persons smoking for only a few years; the membranous bronchioles show a mix of inflammation, luminal mucus, goblet cell metaplasia, and distortion due to fibrosis and loss of alveolar attachments. The lung parenchyma shows centrilobular emphysema. Bronchial changes are only weakly related to airflow obstruction but bronchiolar changes are also related. The relation between airflow limitation and bronchiolitis is progressively harder to show as the severity of emphysema increases because of the dominant role of emphysema in causing airflow obstruction. Emphysema is the predominant lesion in persons with severe airflow obstruction due to COPD. The diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide is related to the severity of emphysema but is nonspecific and is mildly abnormal in smokers without emphysema. The compliance of the lungs of smokers is decreased even when a emphysema and airflow limitation are mild. Standard epidemiologic tools do not differentiate emphysema from other causes of airflow obstruction. Most persons dying of COPD will have severe emphysema.\r"

  ".W": "The increase in morbidity and mortality attributable to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) has focused attention on environmental and host factors causally associated with the clinical entities included under the rubric of this term with a view to early preventive intervention. Despite the biologic plausibility of inhaled agents being causally implicated, only the role of tobacco smoke has been accepted beyond doubt. However, evidence implicating occupational exposures has accumulated, in particular over the last 2 yr, from: (1) community-based studies (in which larger study populations provide greater power than the usually smaller workforce based studies); (2) longitudinal studies of lung function (which enhance the signal of interest, namely the effects of the occupational exposures, and diminish the noise due to between-individual differences); (3) pathology studies (in which the outcome of interest is the quantitative measurement of emphysema), and (4) cohort mortality studies of all or specific causes of death. This evidence, reviewed here according to accepted criteria for establishing causality, leaves little doubt that occupational exposure to dust and/or to dust and fumes may be causally implicated in the genesis of COPD. As with tobacco exposure, both bronchitis (mucus hypersecretion) and airflow limitation are recognized as causally related to exposure, but not necessarily to each other. As with tobacco exposure, though effects are in general dose related to exposure, there is evidence for individual susceptibility. As with tobacco exposure, a possible host factor is the reactivity of airways to inhaled materials.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Thirteen blood samples were collected within 24 h after each aminophylline dose. Theophylline concentrations in serum were measured by enzyme immunoassay (EMIT). The mean aminophylline dose was 437 +/- 36 mg, equivalent to 344 mg of theophylline. Multiple doses of lomefloxacin had no effect on the area under the concentration-time curve from 0 h to infinity, maximal concentration, or clearance of theophylline from serum. There was a slight increase in the theophylline half-life from 6.72 +/- 1.63 to 7.02 +/- 1.37 h after lomefloxacin dosing (P = 0.04); however, the change was clinically insignificant. No change in theophylline dose is required when lomefloxacin therapy is instituted in a patient receiving theophylline.\r"

Bacteria in the log phase were exposed to therapeutically realistic drug regimens. Ampicillin concentration and bacterial density (CFU per milliliter) were measured over time. Four parameters reflecting bactericidal activity were quantitated: difference between initial and minimum and initial and final bacterial densities, area under the bacterial density-time curve, and a fourth parameter, sigma, which is a function of these three. Multiple regression analysis confirmed AUC as the major factor in predicting bactericidal activity. An AUC of greater than 70 micrograms.h/ml correlated with the lack of emergence of resistance.\r"

Its biological properties were compared with those of its two components and structurally related cephalosporins and quinolones. Like ceftriaxone and cefotaxime but unlike its decomposition product, desacetyl cefotaxime, Ro 23-9424 bound at less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml to the essential penicillin-binding proteins 1b and 3 of Escherichia coli and 1, 2, and 3 of Staphylococcus aureus. In E. coli, Ro 23-9424 produced filaments exclusively and decreased cell growth; cefotaxime produced both filaments and lysis. Like its decomposition product fleroxacin but unlike quinolone esters, Ro 23-9424 also inhibited replicative DNA biosynthesis in E. coli. In an E. coli strain lacking OmpF, growth continued after addition of Ro 23-9424, decreased after addition of cefotaxime, and stopped immediately after addition of fleroxacin. The results, together with the chemical stability of Ro 23-9424 (half-life, approximately 3 h at pH 7.4 and 37 degrees C), suggest that in E. coli the compound acts initially as a cephalosporin with intrinsic activity comparable to that of cefotaxime but with poorer penetration. Subsequent to the decomposition of Ro 23-9424 to fleroxacin and desacetyl cefotaxime, quinolone activity appears. The in vitro antibacterial activity reflects both mechanisms of action.\r"

Even though these parasites do not use external uracil or uridine, orotic acid, an intermediate of pyrimidine biosynthesis, is successfully transported into the parasite and incorporated into parasite nucleic acids. On this basis, it was hypothesized that 5-fluoroorotate, a cytotoxic derivative of orotic acid, may be a potent and selective antimalarial agent. In vitro, 5-fluoroorotate caused 50% inhibition of the growth of Plasmodium falciparum at a concentration of 6.0 nM. In contrast, 5-fluorouracil, 5-fluorouridine, and 5-fluoro 2'-deoxyuridine were much less effective against malarial parasites. Chloroquine-susceptible and chloroquine-resistant clones of P. falciparum were equally susceptible to 5-fluoroorotate. The toxicity of 5-fluoroorotate was evaluated on four human cell lines (HT-1080, IMR-90, HeLa S3, and HL-60) and one mouse cell line (L-1210). Compared with malarial parasites, the mammalian cells were relatively tolerant of 5-fluoroorotic acid (50% inhibitory concentration, 0.9 to 10 microM). Finally, in the presence of 1 mM uridine, all mammalian cells were partially protected from 5-fluoroorotate cytotoxicity, but uridine offered no protection to P. falciparum.\r"

  ".W": "We used six candidal strains (two Candida albicans and one each of four other species) to study the effects of test conditions on the activity of SCH 39304 compared with that of fluconazole in broth macro- and microdilution assays. Increasing the inoculum from 10(2) to 10(5) yeasts per ml raised the MICs for all isolates up to greater than 512-fold. In contrast, results with a 50% turbidimetric endpoint (50% inhibitory concentration; IC1/2) varied no more than twofold. Similar effects were seen with fluconazole, and both drugs were found to have an associated delay in onset of action. Acidity was found to increase both MICs and IC1/2s. Other effects were observed among four synthetic media, but a consistent pattern was not identified. Incubation temperatures of 37, 35, and 30 degrees C yielded equivalent results. Broth microdilution IC1/2s against most of 40 isolates of C. albicans were 0.31 microgram/ml +/- fourfold for SCH 39304 and 0.16 microgram/ml +/- twofold for fluconazole. Treatment of experimental candidiasis in rats with SCH 39304 and fluconazole resulted in 50% effective doses of 0.33 and 0.49 mg/kg per day, respectively. In contrast, another C. albicans isolate, previously identified as resistant to other azoles, had IC1/2s of 20 micrograms of SCH 39304 per ml and, in vivo, a 50% effective dose of 2.25 mg/kg per day. We conclude that the in vivo efficacy of SCH 39304 correlates with MIC results when broth macrodilution testing is performed with a small inoculum and with IC1/2 results which are independent of inoculum size.\r"

Results were obtained from 330 (84%). A good level of repeatability was achieved for bronchial provocation testing giving a 95% confidence interval equivalent to 1.74 doubling concentrations. The main problem encountered with methacholine was its bitter taste in high concentrations. The proportion of children, in whom the dose of methacholine which produced a fall of 20% in the forced expiratory volume in one second (PD20 methacholine) was less than or equal to 6.4 mumol, fell from 29.1% at 7 years to 16.5% at 11 years. The prevalence of atopy increased from 26% at 7 years to 31.6% at 11 years. A highly significant association was found between bronchial responsiveness to methacholine and atopy, which was independent of symptoms or age group.\r"

  ".W": "Data on respiratory symptoms were obtained on 2503 schoolchildren aged 7 and 11 in Southampton by means of a self administered parental questionnaire. Children were classified into seven symptom groups from which 330 were tested for bronchial responsiveness to less than or equal to 6.4 mumol methacholine and skin tested for the presence of atopy. The symptoms of wheeze, cough, and shortness of breath were all significantly associated both with each other and bronchial responsiveness to methacholine but only wheeze was associated with atopy. The association of wheeze with both bronchial responsiveness to methacholine and atopy remained highly significant when controlling for the symptoms of cough and shortness of breath. Neither cough nor shortness of breath, however, were significantly related to bronchial responsiveness to methacholine when controlling for the symptom of wheeze. This study therefore calls into question the epidemiological relevance of these two symptoms as diagnostic features of asthma, particularly in the absence of wheeze, although they may be useful indicators of morbidity. Wheeze was not related to bronchial responsiveness to methacholine in the absence of atopy or to atopy in the absence of bronchial responsiveness to methacholine but was strongly related to the combination of the two phenomena. The presence of these three characteristics could therefore indicate a discrete disease entity. The decrease in the prevalence of cough between 7 and 11 years appeared to be mirrored by a similar decrease in the prevalence of wheeze when the symptom was not associated with the combination of bronchial responsiveness to methacholine and atopy.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

One eye of each subject received every concentration of both drugs. Each concentration was administered once daily for 1 week. The fellow eye received a placebo. Aqueous flow was measured for several hours on the last day of administration of each concentration beginning immediately after drug administration. For levobunolol, the mean decrease in aqueous flow compared with baseline was 8% after 1 week's treatment with 0.017% levobunolol, 15% after treatment with 0.05%, 20% after treatment with 0.167%, and 32% after treatment with 0.5%. For betaxolol, the mean decrease in aqueous flow compared with baseline was 3% after 1 week's treatment with 0.017% betaxolol, 12% after treatment with 0.05%, 18% after treatment with 0.167%, and 17% after treatment with 0.5%. Levobunolol-treated eyes but not betaxolol-treated eyes showed a significant drug effect 1 week after discontinuing the drug therapy. The relative potency of the noncardioselective drug was greater than that of the beta 1-cardioselective drug, but the difference in potency was much less than would be expected solely based on their relative affinity for beta 2-receptors in other species and tissues.\r"

However, there was no significant difference between the groups for the apparent permeability of the blood-retinal barrier to fluorescein. These results suggest the possibility that the higher 3-mm fluorescence levels found in the diabetic patients with minimal retinopathy may result in part from enhanced movement of fluorescein through the vitreous.\r"

In each case, a distinct-appearing conjunctivitis developed that representing GVHD of the conjunctiva. In 19 cases (79%), conjunctival GVHD presented with pseudomembrane formation due to loss of the conjunctival epithelium; in 4 of these cases, the corneal epithelium was lost as well. Nineteen patients developed this feature in association with acute GVHD, and mortality among these patients was 89.5%. Kaplan-Meier analysis of survival demonstrated a decreased survival of patients with conjunctival involvement compared with all marrow transplant recipients and compared with all patients with GVHD. However, survival was similar to that seen in patients with severe systemic GVHD (overall stages II through IV). Five patients developed conjunctival GVHD in association with chronic GVHD, and all had severe chronic GVHD. four of these five with chronic GVHD subsequently died. Conjunctival involvement by GVHD represents a distinct clinical finding and is a marker for severe systemic involvement by GVHD. A clinical staging system for ocular involvement was formulated.\r"

The aspirated cells were demonstrated by flow cytometry to be a uniform population of T lymphocytes with a diploid genome and an S fraction of 2.3%. On further investigation, the patient was found to have an extensive abdominal malignant lymphoma with the same immunophenotype but different morphologic features than the anterior chamber lymphoid infiltrate. In contrast to the cells in the anterior chamber, the abdominal tumor was highly aggressive as indicated by the cellular morphologic features and the S fraction of 43%. DNA hybridization studies of the abdominal lymphoma demonstrated a T beta 2 T-cell receptor gene rearrangement. The use of these modern diagnostic methods should facilitate the diagnosis of intraocular lymphomas and may have important therapeutic and prognostic implications in the future.\r"

A 27-gauge needle, passed across the anterior chamber from limbus to limbus, just anterior to the iris, will stabilize the pseudophakos, restore the anterior chamber depth, and allow donor-tissue suturing.\r"

Previous work in our laboratory showed that H-2f and H-2q mice produce no detectable E alpha protein. Northern blot analysis confirms previous results showing normal amounts of E alpha f message and a 100-fold reduction in E alpha q mRNA. Despite that observation, the rates of transcription of both defective E alpha genes, measured by nuclear run-on transcription assays, are comparable to that of the normally expressed E alpha k gene. The nucleotide sequences of the E alpha f and E alpha q genes reveal mutations generating premature translation stop codons in both genes. A single base substitution has created the stop codon TGA at amino acid -2 in the E alpha f leader sequence. A nucleotide insertion at codon 64 in the second exon of the E alpha q gene results in a frame shift and a premature stop codon at amino acid residue 69 of a mature E alpha protein. The low steady state level of E alpha q mRNA may be correlated with the unusual size distribution of the RNA, possibly due to altered RNA processing.\r"

All four monoclonal antibodies derive from different families of genes encoding the variable region of the kappa chain. The RNA sequence of the parent PR8 virus as well as the RNA sequences of the sequential variants were also determined, and it was demonstrated that the variant hemagglutinin molecules differed from the parent molecule by only a single amino acid interchange. Despite these subtle differences in antigenic structures of hemagglutinin, and the cross-reactive idiotype of the antibodies, their primary structures were very different. These data reinforce the idea that a wide variety of antibody structures exist which are directed against subtly different structures in biologically important antigens.\r"

The women were randomized into two groups of 30 patients each. In the control group gentamicin serum levels were determined after the third dose. In the study group, levels were determined only if renal dysfunction was evident or if the patient failed to respond to therapy. Determination of serum levels did not assure a better therapeutic outcome in either group, as measured by hospital stay, duration of treatment, total cost of antibiotics, and hospital readmissions. Although pharmacokinetic dosing equations were used, the use of 1.75 mg/kg every 8 hours based on actual body weight in patients with average heights and weights would have produced acceptable results. We conclude that routine monitoring of gentamicin serum levels is not required in otherwise healthy postpartum women with endometritis.\r"

Ketamine 0.5 and 0.3% produced adequate intravenous regional anesthesia. Anesthesia was inadequate when a 0.2% concentration was used. However, although the 0.3% concentration provides complete sympathetic, sensory, and motor blockade when injected into the isolated extremity, unpleasant psychotomimetic effects after the release of the tourniquet limit the usefulness of this use of ketamine. Ketamine cannot be recommended for intravenous regional anesthesia unless these unpleasant side effects are abolished or controlled by means of pharmacologic adjuvants.\r"

  ".U": "89320573\r", 
  ".W": "Fetal cystic hygroma is a congenital malformation of the lymphatic system appearing as a single or multiloculated fluid-filled cavity, most often in the nuchal region. The malformation is believed to arise from failure of the lymphatic system to communicate with the venous nuchal system. Sometimes the lesion progresses to fetal hydrops, causing fetal death. To further delineate the cause and natural history of this disorder, we have prospectively studied eight cases of cystic hygroma of the neck, detected at gestational ages of 9 to 15 weeks by transvaginal sonography. Three of the eight fetuses survived (37.5%) and were normal at birth. Either hydrops fetalis or intrauterine fetal death occurred in the other five fetuses. In one of these five, therapeutic abortion was induced because of trisomy 21. In another fetus of these five, trisomy 18 was diagnosed by amniocentesis. This pregnancy ended in intrauterine fetal death. The ultrasonic evaluation of the cystic hygromas revealed that those that were reabsorbed in the three ultimately normal viable fetuses were nonseptated cysts, whereas all the four cystic hygromas ending in fetal death or associated with aneuploidy were septated, multilocular hygromas. In another fetus with nonseptated hygroma, nonimmune hydrops developed, which resulted in premature delivery and early neonatal death.\r"

Indirect determination of nebulizer aerosol output, made by estimation of total sodium lost from the nebulizer, was about 25 percent of total output as determined by weight change. A similar tendency was seen for a De Vilbiss 40 nebulizer for both reduction in total nebulizer output with increasing duration of nebulization, and increased solute concentration remaining in the nebulizer. These data must be taken into account when standardizing inhalation provocation tests. Nebulizers should be calibrated under the same conditions that they are used during the test. Histamine and methacholine solutions should be discarded after a single use in the 2-min tidal breathing Wright nebulizer method.\r"

The majority of the tumors were in the distal ureter and approximately 50 per cent of the patients had synchronous or asynchronous urothelial tumors. The majority of the patients had low grade, low stage tumors (75 per cent). A total of 21 patients underwent local resection and none died of tumor. Only 1 of these 21 patients had an ipsilateral recurrence. Nephroureterectomy was performed in 24 patients and 5 of them died of ureteral tumor, including 4 in whom periureteral tumor growth initially was recorded. The prognosis of patients with papillomas or grades 1 to 3, stages Pa to P1 ureteral tumors was excellent and a conservative approach is recommended for these patients. Abuse of combination analgesics containing phenacetin, phenazone and caffeine may be a risk factor for development of ureteral tumors.\r"

  ".W": "The ability of empirical formulae to predict K.t/V based on the ratio (R) of the postdialysis (Ct) to predialysis (Co) plasma urea nitrogen levels was tested. In 256 patients, 336 three-point modeling sessions were performed. The K.t/V and NPCR were derived by interative solution of equations for V and G according to the variable volume single-pool model. The modeled K.t/V values were compared to K.t/V predicted from the formula: K.t/V = -ln (R - 0.008.t-UF/W), where R is the Ct/Co ratio, t the session length (h), UF the ultrafiltrate volume (liters) and W the postdialysis weight (kg). Further, the ratio-derived K.t/V was used in conjunction with the Gotch nomogram for 3/week dialysis to estimate NPCR (NPCR-R/N); the latter value was compared to the NPCR from standard 3-point modeling (NPCR-MOD). The two K.t/V values were quite similar, although statistically separable: modeled K.t/V, 0.97 +/- 0.22 (SD), ratio-derived K.t/V 0.96 +/- 0.23, p less than 0.001. The mean percent error was -0.73% +/- 2.5 (range - 11 to + 4.8), and the correlation coefficient was 0.994, slope 1.01, int -0.016. Modifications of the prediction formula which incorporated UF/V instead of UF/W, and/or which weighted the UF/V term according to the expected K.t/V, produced only slight improvement in accuracy. The two values of NPCR were less similar, but still highly correlated: NPCR-MOD, 1.04 +/- 0.26 g/kg/day, NPCR-R/N, 0.94 +/- 0.23, p less than 0.001; mean percent error, - 8.2 +/- 16; r = 0.78, slope = 0.68, int = 0.23.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Fifty patients undergoing lower extremity revascularization that required bilateral groin incisions were randomly assigned to have either the right or left side of the groin drained with a closed suction catheter. The contralateral wound was closed without drainage. Statistically there was no difference between wound closed with drains and undrained wounds in the occurrence of hematomas, seromas, lymphoceles, superficial infections, subcutaneous infections, or graft infections; although serious complications were more frequent in the drained wounds. Prophylactic closed suction drainage appears to offer no advantage over closure without drainage in wounds of the groin resulting from elective vascular operations.\r"

Products most commonly ingested included tricyclic antidepressants (22%), benzodiazepines (15%), theophylline (10%), ethanol (10%), hallucinogens (8%), salicylates (8%), narcotics (8%), antihistamines (7%), and carbamazepine (5%). Three children became comatose after ingesting about 1 g of hashish. Multiple drug ingestions were frequent (22%), particularly in suicide attempts (11/23). Treatment was, in general, interventionist and nonspecific; aggressive measures for poisoning were required in only two patients who were hemodialyzed. Two patients stayed in the PICU greater than 2 days. All patients survived with no sequelae, except for one patient who required an intestinal resection. Poisoning in children is a common occurrence leading to PICU admission; however, the medical prognosis is usually excellent.\r"

In two thalassemic patients, diuresis was evident by urine output exceeding fluid intake. The mechanism was studied in dogs that exhibited an acute and significant decrease in inulin and para-aminohippuric acid clearances induced by intravenous deferoxamine. Saline diuresis could prevent the decrease in the glomerular filtration rate but not the decrease in renal blood flow caused by deferoxamine. Deferoxamine induced an acute increase in the fractional excretion of sodium, potassium, chloride, phosphate, and urate, which may explain the relative diuresis observed in two of the patients. In a subsequent experiment, ferrioxamine induced an increase in the fractional excretion of sodium and chloride but did not affect the glomerular filtration rate and renal blood flow. Our studies suggest that adequate hydration may be needed to preserve renal hemodynamics during intravenous deferoxamine therapy. Repeated measurements of renal function should accompany treatment with this agent.\r"

Ten patients operated on for blunt abdominal trauma required unavoidable splenectomy. In each, autotransplantation of the removed spleen (roughly 50 g) was performed. Postoperative studies of splenic functions revealed disappearance of Howell-Jolly bodies from peripheral blood. Levels of IgM, which were initially significantly depressed, returned to normal and there were normal technetium Tc 99m sulfur colloid scans ten weeks after surgery.

The algorithm was validated in a second set of 166 dysuric women, 77 of whom had urinary tract infections.

Five (8%) of 65 patients were initially EIA-positive. On repeat sampling without intervening antibiotic treatment, 4 girls who were initially positive became negative and 1 remained persistently positive. Chlamydial cultures were negative in all patients. The patient with the persistently positive EIA also had Group A streptococcal vaginitis. We were able to demonstrate that some strains of Group A Streptococcus can cause a positive reaction with the EIA. Cross-reactions with other bacterial species are also known to occur. We therefore conclude that Chlamydiazyme is not specific for the detection of chlamydial infection in the vagina of prepubertal girls and, for medicolegal reasons, should not be used for evaluation of sexual abuse.\r"

  ".W": "Postmenopausal women are believed to have a higher risk of coronary artery disease than premenopausal women. In this study, we prospectively determined changes in coronary risk factors that were attributable to natural menopause in 541 healthy, initially premenopausal women 42 to 50 years of age. After approximately 2 1/2 years, 69 women had spontaneously stopped menstruating for at least 12 months, and 32 women had stopped natural menstruation and received hormone-replacement therapy for a period of at least 12 months. An equal number of age-matched premenopausal women in the study group served as controls. In women who had a natural menopause and did not receive hormone-replacement therapy, serum levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol declined as compared with those of premenopausal controls (-0.09 vs. 0.00 mmol per liter; P = 0.01), and levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol increased (+0.31 vs. +0.14 mmol per liter; P = 0.04). In menopausal women who received hormone-replacement therapy, HDL and LDL cholesterol levels did not change, but the levels of triglycerides (+0.42 vs. -0.04 mmol per liter; P less than 0.001), apolipoprotein A-I (+0.18 vs. +0.03 g per liter; P less than 0.01), and apolipoprotein A-II (+0.05 vs. -0.03 g per liter; P less than 0.05) increased as compared with premenopausal controls. Natural menopause did not affect blood pressure, plasma glucose or insulin levels, body weight, the total number of kilojoules consumed in the diet, or the total number of kilojoules expended in physical activity. These results suggest that a natural menopause has an unfavorable effect on lipid metabolism, which may contribute to an increase in the risk of coronary disease. Hormone-replacement therapy may prevent some of these changes.\r"

  ".W": "Acute experimental transplantation of an allograft heart in a heterotopic position was performed in 14 sheep. The donor heart was implanted in the left side of the chest with left atrial, aortic, and pulmonary artery anastomoses. Hemodynamic studies were performed to evaluate the physiologic effects of the procedure, particularly when recipient left ventricular failure was produced by inflow and outflow obstruction. Pacing techniques were developed and tested to coordinate the rhythm of the two hearts either synchronously or sequentially with variable intervals between depolarization of the two hearts. Hemodynamic studies were performed to evaluate the rhythm that would most optimize the physiology. The cardiac index remained essentially unchanged when the dominant circulatory support was shifted from recipient left ventricle to donor left ventricle by producing recipient left ventricular failure (3.79 +/- 0.6 to 3.30 +/- 0.8, p = no significant difference). Consistent and reliable paced rhythms were achieved in each case. The cardiac index was significantly higher when the hearts were paced sequentially rather than synchronously (3.76 +/- 0.5 versus 3.29 +/- 0.5, p less than 0.04). Allograft donor hearts small in size or slightly inadequate otherwise, which may be unsuitable for orthotopic heart transplantation, may still be used heterotopically for short-term support. Their use would maximize the use of all donor organs and the survival of patients awaiting a suitable organ. Further, it may also be possible to use sequentially paced xenografts heterotopically for short-term left ventricular assistance as a bridge to orthotopic heart transplantation.\r"

In the present study, the response of intact chest dog and human lungs to hypoxia and hypoxemia, respectively, was also precapillary vasoconstriction. In dogs, hypoxia in the ipsilateral lung attenuated the normal vertical blood flow gradient. Contralateral hypoxia did not alter pulmonary regional blood flow, precapillary (Ra), postcapillary, or total pulmonary vascular resistance. In patients, an elevated alveolar-arterial oxygen pressure gradient of 50 to 150 torr resulted in significantly increased Ra. Further hypoxemia did not increase this response. In addition, the effective pulmonary capillary pressure did not bear a constant relationship to the pulmonary artery occlusion or wedge pressure (WP). Therefore, in patients in respiratory failure, WP does not reliably estimate hydrostatic pressure at the pulmonary capillaries.\r"

Data are now presented indicating that MSF present in the conditioned medium of fetal and cancer patient fibroblasts is precipitated at 10% saturation ammonium sulfate and binds to heparin and cation-exchange resins. Based on this information, we have devised a scheme for the purification of MSF involving the sequential application of ammonium sulfate precipitation, heparin affinity, gel filtration, and reverse-phase chromatography. Purified MSF has an estimated molecular mass of 70 kDa; amino acid analysis reveals a relatively high level of proline (13.34 residues per 100). Our results further suggest that skin fibroblasts from breast cancer patients produce an additional factor with migration stimulating activity; this factor is precipitated at higher concentrations of ammonium sulfate and binds to anion-exchange resins. We have previously discussed the possible direct involvement of fetal-like fibroblasts in cancer pathogenesis. The availability of MSF obtained from cancer patient fibroblasts provides a potential means with which to examine the complex cellular interactions contributing to this process as well as develop a screening regime for identifying individuals at elevated risk of developing cancer.\r"

Patients with intractable cancer-related pain were studied for 5-6 days. One-eighth of the patient's daily opiate requirement was supplied as an i.v. infusion of either morphine or methadone over a period of 15 min. when initiated by the patient using a patient-controlled analgesia device. Dosing intervals, pain intensity assessments and toxicity were evaluated. Twenty-three patients were randomized; 18 were fully evaluable. Ten of the evaluable patients received morphine, 8 received methadone. Dosing intervals did not change over the 5 days for either group. The mean dosing interval for the last 10 doses was 3.9 +/- 0.85 h for patients receiving morphine and 3.9 +/- 1.6 h for patients receiving methadone (P = NS). One patient receiving morphine and one taking methadone required only 2-3 doses/day for pain control. Pain intensity and relief were similar for both groups. All patients had adequate analgesia as determined by at least a 50% difference in pain intensity at peak relief. The duration of pain relief when repeated intravenous doses of these analgesics were given was similar throughout the entire study period although morphine and methadone have different serum half-lives (3 vs. 25 h). Parenteral methadone does not offer a clinically significant increase in the duration of analgesia in patients with severe pain secondary to cancer.\r"

In a pilot study we have treated 8 patients with recurrent staphylococcal peritonitis and 3 patients with persistent staphylococcal peritonitis by stopping CAPD for a 2-week period, the CAPD catheter being left in-situ. All 8 patients with recurrent peritonitis and 2 of the 3 patients with persistent peritonitis had resolution of their infection; the third patient required catheter removal to clear the infection. There were no acute problems associated with stopping CAPD, and there was no evidence of loss of peritoneal filtration capacity on restarting CAPD. This novel approach to the treatment of resistant CAPD peritonitis should reduce the number of CAPD catheters replaced and therefore diminish the risks and inconvenience to patients that such replacements entail.\r"

At the DNA level and the predicted amino acid and secondary structure levels, close homology is evident between the human and rabbit intestinal Na+/glucose cotransporters, and a significant homology is found between these and the Escherichia coli Na+/proline cotransporter (putP). No homology is detectible with other known proteins. We infer from these results that the mammalian Na+/glucose and prokaryote Na+/proline cotransporters share a common ancestral gene.\r"

Univariate and multivariate analysis was performed on 588 patients with acute liver failure managed medically during 1973-1985, to identify the factors most likely to indicate a poor prognosis. In acetaminophen-induced fulminant hepatic failure, survival correlated with arterial blood pH, peak prothrombin time, and serum creatinine--a pH less than 7.30, prothrombin time greater than 100 s, and creatinine greater than 300 mumol/L indicating a poor prognosis. In patients with viral hepatitis and drug reactions three static variables [etiology (non A, non B hepatitis or drug reactions), age less than 11 and greater than 40 yr, duration of jaundice before the onset of encephalopathy greater than 7 days] and two dynamic variables (serum bilirubin greater than 300 mumol/L and prothrombin time greater than 50 s) indicated a poor prognosis. The value of these indicators in determining outcome was tested retrospectively in a further 175 patients admitted during 1986-1987, leading to the construction of models for the selection of patients for liver transplantation.\r"

To identify this major gene, we compared the frequencies of 12 RFLPs at five loci-epidermal growth factor, transforming growth factor-alpha, epidermal growth factor receptor, glucocorticoid receptor, and estrogen receptor-in both a group of 80 subjects with nonsyndromic CL/P and 102 controls. These candidate genes were selected because studies in rodents had suggested their possible involvement in palatogenesis. A significant association was observed between two RFLPs at the transforming-growth-factor-alpha (TGFA) locus and the occurrence of clefting (P = .0047 and P = .0052). This suggests that either the TGFA gene itself or DNA sequences in an adjacent region contribute to the development of a portion of cases of CL/P in humans and provides an opportunity to begin to examine the molecular events underlying lip and palate formation.\r"

Using anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies, we have previously identified a transmembrane glycoprotein with abnormally high protein tyrosine kinase activity in a human gastric tumour cell line (GTL-16). Electrophoresis under non-reducing conditions revealed that this kinase (relative molecular mass 145,000 (145 K)) is disulphide-linked to a 50K chain in an alpha beta-complex of 190K (p190). From its novel two-chain structure, we deduced that p190 was the prototype of a new class of tyrosine kinase receptors. We now show that p190 is indistinguishable from the protein encoded by the c-met proto-oncogene and that the alpha beta-subunit structure is conserved in other human cell lines. We also show that the high level of p190 found in the GTL-16 cell line is accompanied by amplification and overexpression of c-met. This provides the first example of a functional alteration of c-met in a human tumour cell line.\r"

This study uses an improved measure of physician volume to test the combined relationship of hospital and physician volume with in-hospital mortality rates and to explore the existence of threshold volumes that optimally discriminate high- and low-volume providers. Five procedure groups have significant volume-mortality relationships. For total cholecystectomies, hospital volume is the more significant volume measure, but physician volume is marginally related to mortality rate. For coronary artery bypass surgeries, resection of abdominal aortic aneurysms, partial gastrectomies, and colectomies, physician volume is more significant than hospital volume, but hospital volume is marginally significant. Annual hospital volume thresholds for these data appear to exist at approximately 5 procedures for partial gastrectomies, 40 procedures for colectomies, and 170 procedures for total cholecystectomies.\r"

  ".W": "Traumatic disruption of the descending thoracic aorta is a relatively rare but dramatic injury. Controversy remains regarding the use of shunts during operative repair. Discouraged by our results using the \"no shunt\" technique, we adopted the recently reported technique using the Bio-Medicus pump for left atrium-femoral artery bypass without heparin sodium. At Charlotte Memorial Hospital and Medical Center, 39 patients were treated for tears of the descending thoracic aorta between January 1979 and October 1988. Eight patients died before repair could be completed. Four patients underwent repair using femorofemoral bypass with 1 death and no instances of paraplegia. Fifteen patients had repair using the no-shunt technique with 4 deaths and three instances of paraplegia. Since January 1986, 12 patients have been treated using the Bio-Medicus heparinless pump with no deaths and no instances of paraplegia. We present our experience to confirm the reports of others regarding the efficacy of this technique. We believe it reduces the morbidity and mortality associated with this serious injury and aids in the hemodynamic management of the patient during aortic clamping.\r"

  ".W": "STUDY OBJECTIVE: To review the rationale for using angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors in progressive renal disease, and to evaluate the experience with these agents in patients with hypertension and renal insufficiency. DATA IDENTIFICATION: Experimental and clinical studies published from January 1977 to November 1988 were identified by searching the literature and by extensive hand searching of bibliographies of identified articles. STUDY SELECTION: Experimental studies of glomerular function during therapy with ACE inhibitors or other antihypertensive regimens were reviewed. Series using ACE inhibitors for treating hypertensive patients with renal disease were evaluated and reports of adverse events were studied. RESULTS OF DATA SYNTHESIS: Experimentally, ACE inhibitors seem to decrease glomerular injury by reducing both systemic and glomerular hypertension. Clinically, ACE inhibitors reduce systemic blood pressure in hypertensive patients with diabetic and nondiabetic renal disease without causing dramatic changes in glomerular filtration rate or renal blood flow. Most studies of nondiabetic renal insufficiency suggest that proteinuria is reduced in most patients. However, no long-term controlled study on the effect of ACE inhibitors on the progression rate of nondiabetic renal disease has been completed. ACE inhibitors have not yet been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treating or preventing progressive renal disease. Such use would therefore be considered \"innovative\" therapy. CONCLUSIONS: ACE inhibitors are tolerated by azotemic patients, although transient reductions in renal function can occur. Patients with bilateral renal insufficiency or low cardiac output are at increased risk for developing reversible acute renal insufficiency. Hyperkalemia may occur, particularly in patients with diabetes or severe renal insufficiency. In many patients with renal disease, ACE inhibitors dramatically reduce proteinuria, but whether they also reduce the rate of progression of renal disease remains unproved.\r"

DESIGN: Prospective controlled study comparing patients with previous thiazide-induced hyponatremia with two control groups. PATIENTS AND CONTROLS: Eleven patients with thiazide-induced (Kaluril [hydrochlorothiazide, 50 mg; amiloride, 5 mg]) hyponatremia of less than 130 mmol/L at least 1 week before the study. Two groups of controls: 10 young healthy volunteers and 11 elderly hypertensive patients previously treated uneventfully with thiazide. INTERVENTIONS: Administration of a single dose of hydrochlorothiazide, 50 mg, and amiloride, 5 mg. MEASUREMENTS: Blood pressure, pulse rate, body weight, serum urea, creatinine, sodium, potassium, magnesium, osmolality, plasma antidiuretic hormone, renin, aldosterone and also urinary sodium, potassium, osmolality, and cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) before and 6 to 8, 12, and 24 hours after drug administration. RESULTS: Within 6 to 8 hours serum sodium decreased in patients, young controls, and elderly controls by 5.5 +/- 1.1 (mean +/- SE), 1.2 +/- 0.4, and 1.8 +/- 0.9 mmol/L, respectively (Py less than 0.001 [patients versus young controls], Pe = 0.017 [patients versus elderly controls]). Serum osmolality decreased in patients, young controls, and elderly controls by 14.9 +/- 2.6, 2.8 +/- 1.6, and 6.6 +/- 1.5 mmol/kg, respectively (Py less than 0.001, Pe = 0.012). All patients and only one control subject reached osmolality of less than 280 mmol/kg. At 6 to 8 hours all patients gained weight (0.85 +/- 0.13 kg) whereas young and elderly controls lost weight (0.47 +/- 0.23 and 0.45 +/- 0.2 kg, respectively) (Py much less than 0.001, Pe much less than 0.001). Patients' responses to the drug did not differ from both control groups regarding sodium and potassium urinary excretion, osmolar and free water clearance, and antidiuretic hormone blood levels. Water restriction in one patient attenuated serum sodium reduction. CONCLUSIONS: Use of a single-dose of a thiazide diuretic may predict the development of hyponatremia. Increased body weight apparently due to polydipsia may play a major role in the pathogenesis of thiazide-induced hyponatremia.\r"

  ".W": "Periportal and perivenous hepatocytes were isolated from rat liver by digitonin/collagenase perfusion for investigating the acinar heterogeneity of amino acid transport activities related to glutamine and ammonia metabolism. Immunocytochemical staining of the respective subpopulations for glutamine synthetase demonstrated that periportal subpopulations were essentially free of glutamine synthetase-positive cells, whereas perivenous subpopulations showed a 2- to 3-fold enrichment of glutamine synthetase-positive hepatocytes. The high perivenous/periportal ratio of 59 found for glutamine synthetase activity as well as the perivenous/periportal ratios of other marker enzymes further indicated the good separation of periportal and perivenous cells. alpha-Aminoisobutyric acid, histidine and glutamate were used to determine the distribution pattern of amino acid transport systems A, N and G-, as well as of the sodium-independent uptake of these compounds 1 hr after isolation and after maximal hormonal stimulation during primary culture. The strong heterogeneity of the sodium-independent transport of histidine, characterized by higher perivenous transport rates [perivenous/periportal ratio: 1.5 (1 hr) to 3.5 (48 hr)], suggests a significant role of facilitated diffusion, presumably in glutamine export. Conversely, the strong heterogeneity of the sodium-dependent glutamate transport (System G-) characterized by higher uptake rates in nonstimulated [perivenous/periportal ratio: 6.6 (1 hr)] and in hormonally treated perivenous hepatocytes (perivenous/periportal ratio: 2.2) reflects its possible significance with respect to the substrate availability for glutamine synthesis. The observed heterogeneities provide a basis for understanding how substrate fluxes related to glutamine metabolism might be established and regulated.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Hepatic fibrosis is the major clinical sequela of infection with the helminth Schistosoma mansoni. However, little is known regarding its dynamics and regulation in schistosomiasis. The present study presents the dynamics of deposition and resorption of two major extracellular matrix components of fibrosis, glycosaminoglycans and collagens, during the course of experimental S. mansoni infection. Early in infection (6 weeks), glycosaminoglycan biosynthesis was markedly elevated, as was collagen biosynthesis. This led to significant accumulations of these two molecules at a glycosaminoglycan/collagen ratio similar to that observed in livers of uninfected mice (uronic acid/hydroxyproline ratio of 1.10 at 6 weeks compared to normal value of 1.25). During maximal hepatic fibrosis (12 to 18 weeks), both collagen and glycosaminoglycan biosynthesis continued to increase but the extracellular matrix shifted to a lower glycosaminoglycan/collagen ratio of 0.42, suggesting enhanced glycosaminoglycan breakdown. In addition, during this acute stage of infection, Type I collagen was the predominant isotype synthesized, whereas total collagenolytic activity degrading Type I collagen was maximal. During chronic infection, a decrease in the content of both hepatic glycosaminoglycans and collagens were noted, with a glycosaminoglycan/collagen ratio of 0.63. Decreased glycosaminoglycan content paralleled diminished biosynthetic rates. On the other hand, an over 50% reduction in collagen content (from 18 to 24 weeks) appeared not to result from diminished biosynthesis but from a switch in the predominant collagen isotype synthesized (from Type I to Type III), matched by an enhanced constitutive collagenolytic activity directed toward this type of collagen.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

These factors may contribute to the heterogeneity observed in solute transport and uptake in the hepatic lobules. However, predictions of liver extraction based on black-box models require assumptions about these factors and the microvascular transport mechanisms involved. Consequently, the purpose of this study was to investigate solute transport and uptake by hepatocytes. Livers from male Sprague-Dawley rats were perfused at physiological flowrates and portal pressures on the stage of an in vivo microscope using a low-hematocrit Ringer solution. A bolus of fluorescein isothiocyanate-dextrans (17,900, 39,000, 65,600 or 156,900 MW), which are considered inert fluid-phase markers, was injected into the portal vein. Fluorescein isothiocyanate fluorescence, as a measure of solute concentration, was video recorded in periportal or centrivenular regions of the lobules. Spatial and temporal fluorescence data, measured in sinusoids and hepatocytes, were fit to one-dimensional transport models to determine estimates for an intracellular effective diffusion coefficient and for hepatocyte permeability. The calculated effective diffusion coefficients were 2.5 times larger for dextrans less than 66,000 MW, but were not different between the periportal and centrivenular regions. Also, the values did not show the inverse log-log molecular weight dependency for dextrans seen in other microvascular tissues.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Postnatal administration of alpha-difluoromethylornithine (DFMO), an irreversible inhibitor of ornithine decarboxylase (ODC), is known to curtail replication of granule cells in the cerebellum of the rat, but its effects on post-proliferative neurons is unknown. This Golgi study assessed the influence of daily postnatal injections of DFMO on dendritic development of the Purkinje and granule cells. Although the overall appearance of the Purkinje cells was normal, DFMO affected morphogenesis by causing: 1) a reduction in somatic growth, 2) an elongation of the primary dendrite, 3) a lengthening of the distance between the soma and the pial surface, 4) a reduction in the number of tertiary dendrites, and 5) a disruption of the distribution of the tertiary branches. Many of these effects of DFMO may be mediated via the reduction of granule cells rather than representing a direct effect on dendritogenesis. In addition to reducing the number of granule cells, the distribution and morphology of these cells in the DFMO-treated rats were severely affected. Many granule cells did not complete their migration and remained trapped in the molecular layer, and many of those trapped had greatly elongated dendrites that extended into the internal granule cell layer. These results suggest that ornithine decarboxylase is involved in the postproliferative processes of neuronal migration and differentiation.\r"

The cores of many Lewy bodies were strongly reactive with a monoclonal antibody to paired helical filaments which has been shown to recognize ubiquitin. This antibody also stained Marinesco bodies in the same tissue sections. Two monoclonal antibodies to phosphorylated epitopes of neurofilament proteins (SM I 31, SM I 34) stained the peripheries of about 40% of all discernable Lewy bodies on untreated paraffin sections. Reactivity with a monoclonal antibody to neurofilaments (SM I 33) appeared only after pretreatment of the sections with phosphatase. Lewy bodies did not bind antibodies to tau protein. Our results show that, as previously shown for neurofibrillary tangles, Lewy bodies also contain ubiquitin. The uncovering of neurofilament epitopes by treatment with phosphatase indicates that abnormal phosphorylation of cytoskeletal elements may play a role in the pathogenesis of the Lewy body.\r"

The purpose of this study was to determine when cells become committed to neoplasia and whether genes linked to H-2a or H-4b are a factor in predisposition to genesis of lymphoma. Following transplantation of a pool of spleen cells in large groups of mice, lymphoma incidence increased 1.8- to 2.1-fold and mean latent periods decreased, compared with those in controls. Lymphomas arising in mice that received the same pool of spleen cells often displayed identical rearrangements of genes for immunoglobulin and T-cell receptor. This finding indicates that the lymphomas were derived from expanding clones of cells present in the donor mice prior to transfer. The age of the donor mice determined the latency of lymphomas arising after spleen cell transfer. When donors were 3-4 months old at the time of spleen cell transfer, lymphomas were detected in the recipients 1 year later. When mice 1.5-2 years old were used as donors, tumors were observed 3 months after transfer. Almost all of these tumors were clonally related B-cell lymphomas. We conclude that the lymphomas seen late in life arise from premalignant clones of cells that have become committed to neoplasia in relatively young animals. These clones normally follow an indolent course and are manifested clinically only in old age. Neither H-2a nor H-4b alone appeared to alter susceptibility to the genesis of lymphoma in similar experiments with H-2a and H-4b congenic mice.\r"

  ".W": "A total of 17 patients with superficial transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder underwent treatment with pelvic external beam irradiation followed by an intracavitary 137cesium implant via a triple lumen Foley catheter. Of these patients 11 had recurrent and multifocal superficial cancer, with 8 having relapse after prior intravesical chemotherapy. External beam doses of 3,600 to 5,066 cGy. were followed by implant doses delivering 2,000 to 3,200 cGy. to the bladder mucosa, with the sum of external and intracavitary doses totaling 6,500 to 7,500 cGy. Of 15 patients evaluable with a median followup of 48 months, and including 13 followed for more than 2 years, 11 (73 per cent) remain free of disease, 3 (20 per cent) have recurrence in the bladder but have retained the bladder and only 1 has required cystectomy. All 4 failures occurred in the subgroup of 8 patients who had received prior intravesical chemotherapy. This bladder-sparing approach is well tolerated, is an alternative to cystectomy in patients with recurrent superficial transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder and in our series has salvaged 50 per cent (4 of 8) of the patients even after failure of intravesical chemotherapy.\r"

  ".W": "The possible effect of medical androgen deprivation in the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia has been studied in 12 patients. Six patients received the luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone agonist buserelin and 6 others received the antiandrogen cyproterone acetate. The treatment resulted in an average decrease in prostatic size of 29 per cent after 12 weeks as measured by ultrasonography. This decrease led to an increase in peak urinary flow rate, a reduction in residual urine volume and a decrease in daytime voiding frequency. However, it caused no decrease in urethral resistance but only an increase in the bladder contraction strength. After discontinuation of the treatment the prostates showed regrowth to the initial sizes within 6 to 36 weeks. The urodynamic changes were reversed as well. Although statistically significant, the urodynamic changes were minimal from a clinical viewpoint and did not lead to an unobstructed state after 12 weeks of treatment. For this reason the clinical indication for use of medical androgen deprivation in benign prostatic hyperplasia patients will remain limited for the time being.\r"

Because physicians may not consider counseling against smoking to be as worthwhile as other medical practices, we examined its cost-effectiveness. We based our estimates of the effectiveness of physician counseling on published reports of randomized trials and our estimates of its cost on average charges for physician office visits. Our results indicate that the cost-effectiveness of brief advice during routine office visits ranges from $705 to $988 per year of life saved for men and from $1204 to $2058 for women. Follow-up visits about smoking appear to be similarly cost-effective. Physician counseling against smoking, therefore, is at least as cost-effective as several other preventive medical practices and should be a routine part of health care for patients who smoke.\r"

The study was restricted to patients under 34 weeks' gestation with a lecithin/sphingomyelin (L/S) ratio less than 2.0. The patients were randomized into a study group receiving intravenous thyrotropin-releasing hormone along with intramuscular corticosteroids over 48 hours and a control group receiving only corticosteroids. Patients undelivered 1 week after the onset of therapy underwent a repeat amniocentesis to document changes in the L/S ratio. In those patients delivering within 1 week of therapy, the neonatal clinical course was established by two investigators blinded to the antenatal therapy. Compared with the control group, the group receiving antenatal corticosteroids plus thyrotropin-releasing hormone showed a greater post-therapy increase in L/S ratio, fewer respirator days, and a lower incidence of bronchopulmonary dysplasia. The results of this study suggest that the combined use of corticosteroids and thyrotropin-releasing hormone results in enhanced fetal pulmonic maturation superior to that achieved with corticosteroids alone.\r"

  ".W": "Isradipine is a new dihydropyridine calcium antagonist with myocardial effects significantly different from those of nifedipine, as shown by in vitro and animal experimental data. Isradipine selectively inhibits the sinus node but not the atrioventricular conduction and its negative inotropic action is much less if administered in a dose of comparable peripheral effects. To study these effects in man, 40 patients with coronary artery disease were divided into 2 groups receiving either a continuous 30-minute intravenous infusion of 2 mg of nifedipine or 0.5 mg of isradipine, doses that resulted in a comparable afterload reduction (decrease of systemic vascular resistance: nifedipine -22.1%, isradipine -25%, p less than 0.001). Ten patients in each group received an additional intravenous bolus of 5 mg of propranolol at the end of the calcium antagonist administration to antagonize its induced adrenergic reflex mechanisms. The heart rate significantly increased after nifedipine only (+9.2%, p less than 0.001), experienced no change after isradipine and the nifedipine and propranolol combination and decreased after the combination of isradipine and propranolol (-9.6%, p less than 0.001). This resulted in a significant decrease of the rate pressure product with isradipine (-12.5%, p less than 0.001) but not with nifedipine. As a result of the afterload-induced adrenergic reflex mechanisms, the maximal derivative of the left ventricular pressure increased after isradipine administration (+13.5%, p less than 0.001) and was unchanged after nifedipine, which demonstrates the significantly less negative inotropic properties of isradipine as compared with nifedipine.\r"

Fifty-seven patients admitted for suspected AMI were studied; 17 patients underwent thrombolytic therapy with intravenous streptokinase and 11 had clinical signs of reperfusion; 9 had had a previous myocardial infarction. Fifty of 57 patients were discharged from the coronary care unit with a confirmed diagnosis of AMI. The AMA-Fab study results were positive for AMI in 49 patients (98%) and negative in 1 (2%). Among the 7 patients without AMI, 5 had unstable angina, 1 had Prinzmetal's variant angina and 1 had acute pancreatitis. AMA-Fab results were negative in 6 of 7 patients (85%) and positive in 1 (15%). Therefore, the sensitivity and specificity of AMA-Fab scintigraphy were 0.98 and 0.85, respectively. To assess accuracy in defining the extent and location of AMI, AMA-Fab results were compared with those of the electrocardiogram, echocardiogram, technetium-99m pyrophosphate myocardial scintigraphy and coronary angiography and left ventriculography. AMA-Fab scintigraphy showed a good concordance with the traditional techniques in the topographic definition of the infarcted regions. No uptake of AMA-Fab was seen in the regions of previous old infarcts. Ten healthy volunteers also underwent AMA-Fab scintigraphy. No evidence of myocardial tracer uptake was noted in them. No adverse reactions or side effects were noted after injection of AMA-Fab in any patient. It is concluded that planar myocardial scintigraphy with AMA-Fab is a reliable method for AMI detection and location.\r"

Drug efficacy, as judged by repeated ambulatory monitoring, was defined as greater than 75% reduction in ventricular premature complexes combined with a greater than 90% abolition of pairs and runs of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia. In group A, 27 of 52 patients (52%) had their arrhythmia suppressed by the drug compared with 34 of 49 (69%) in group B (difference not significant). There was a trend toward better arrhythmia control in group B if a total daily dose of greater than 100 mg was necessary for arrhythmia suppression. Side effects were frequent in both groups (24 vs 28%, difference not significant). Thus, encainide administered twice daily effectively suppresses ventricular arrhythmias in this patient population.\r"

Using radioimmunoassay, we measured plasma apo AI levels in 1,880 individuals in 283 pedigrees randomly selected from the population with respect to disease status and risk factors for coronary artery disease. Apo AI levels were first adjusted for date of assay (6.8% of apo AI variation) and then adjusted for variability in age and body mass index (an additional 6.6%, 20.4%, and 23.0% of apo AI variations for males, females not using exogenous hormones, and females using exogenous hormones, respectively). A mixture of two normal distributions fit the adjusted data better than did a single normal distribution. Genetic and environmental models that could explain the mixture of normal distributions were investigated using complex segregation analysis. Heterogeneous etiologies for individual differences in adjusted apo AI levels were suggested by the data in the 283 pedigrees. In a subset of 126 pedigrees, there is evidence for the major effect of a nontransmitted environmental factor that explains the mixture of distributions as well as polygenic loci that influence apo AI levels within each distribution. The environmental factor and polygenic loci account for 32% and 65% of the adjusted variation, respectively. In the other 157 pedigrees there is strong support for a single locus with a major effect that accounts for 27% of the adjusted variation. The effect of the polygenic loci is not different from zero in these 157 pedigrees. This is the first study to present evidence for the segregation of a single unmeasured locus with a major effect on levels of apo AI in a population-based sample of pedigrees.\r"

Thirty-eight recombination events in the pericentromeric region were identified, eight involving crossovers between NF1 and loci on either chromosomal arm.

  ".W": "A female patient is described with von Recklinghausen neurofibromatosis (NF1) in association with a balanced translocation between chromosome 17 and 22 [46,XX,t(17;22)(q11.2;q11.2)]. The breakpoint in chromosome 17 is cytogenetically identical to a previously reported case of NF1 associated with a 1;17 balanced translocation and suggests that the translocation events disrupt the NF1 gene. This precisely maps the NF1 gene to 17q11.2 and provides a physical reference point for strategies to clone the breakpoint and therefore the NF1 gene. A human-mouse somatic cell hybrid was constructed from patient lymphoblasts which retained the derivative chromosome 22 (22pter----22q11.2::17q11.2----17qter) but not the derivative 17q or normal 17. Southern blot analysis with genes and anonymous probes known to be in proximal 17q showed ErbA1, ErbB2, and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (CSF3) to be present in the hybrid and therefore distal to the breakpoint, while pHHH202 (D17S33) and beta crystallin (CRYB1) were absent in the hybrid and therefore proximal to the breakpoint. The gene cluster including ErbA1 is known to be flanked by the constitutional 15;17 translocation breakpoint in hybrid SP3 and by the acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) breakpoint, which provides the following gene and breakpoint order: cen-SP3-(D17S33,CRYB1)-NF1-(CSF3,ERBA1, ERBB2)-APL-tel. The flanking breakpoints of SP3 and API are therefore useful for rapidly localizing new markers to the neurofibromatosis critical region, while the breakpoints of the two translocation patients provide unique opportunities for reverse genetic strategies to clone the NF1 gene.\r"

  ".W": "The von Recklinghausen neurofibromatosis (NF1) gene has been localized to the pericentromeric region of chromosome 17. We have screened six multigenerational families with multiple, tightly linked markers to aid in mapping this region of the chromosome. More than 150 members in six families were typed with probes including HHH202, D17Z1, EW203, EW206, EW207, EW301, pA10-41, D17S37, and D17S36. Two-point lod scores for NF1 versus all markers were calculated. HHH202 demonstrated the tightest linkage to NF1 with theta = .0, z = 3.86 (95% confidence limits [CL] of theta = .0-.13), suggesting that HHH202 be considered as a potential candidate marker for use in carrier detection and prenatal diagnosis. Pairwise marker-to-marker lod scores were used in examining the most likely order of subsets of the markers. Of those tested, the most likely order was (pter)-pA10-41-EW301-D17Z1-HHH202-NF1-E W206-EW207-EW203-(qter). In addition, we have ascertained an NF1 x NF1 half-cousin mating in which there are four affected family members who are potentially homozygous for the disease gene. Two of these four individuals have been sampled and typed for marker loci. When their D17Z1 genotypes are considered, the probability that both these individuals are heterozygous is 85%.\r"

A multipoint linkage analysis suggests that the NF1 gene is flanked by D17Z1 on the centromeric side and by EW 207 on the telomeric side of the long arm of chromosome 17. The identification of closely linked flanking markers should allow us to develop a reliable prenatal and presymptomatic diagnostic test for this serious neurological disorder and provides the basis for applying chromosome-specific cloning techniques for the isolation and characterization of the mutant gene.\r"

NF1 did not recombine with either TH17.19 or HHH202 in any of the informative meioses surveyed (maximum lod scores of 17.04 and 7.21, respectively, at a recombination fraction of .00), indicating that these markers map very close to the NF1 gene. We also report evidence of three instances of recombination between NF1 and the centromeric marker D17Z1 (maximum lod score of 13.43 at a recombination fraction of .04), as well as two crossovers between pairs of marker loci.

This microcell-mediated, chromosome-transfer construct harbors a centromeric segment and a neo-marked segment from the distal long arm of human chromosome 17. We have identified 269 cosmid clones with human sequences from a 7AE-11 library and, using a panel of somatic cell hybrids with a total of six chromosome 17q breakpoints, have mapped 240 of these clones on chromosome 17q. The panel included a hybrid (NF13) carrying a der(22) chromosome that was isolated from an NF1 patient with a balanced translocation, t(17;22) (q11.2;q11.2). Fifty-three of the cosmids map into a region spanning the NF13 breakpoint, as defined by the two closest flanking breakpoints (17q11.2 and 17q11.2-q12). RFLP clones from a subset of these cosmids have been mapped by linkage analysis in normal reference families, to localize the NF1 gene more precisely and to enhance the potential for genetic diagnosis of this disorder. The cosmids in the NF1 region will be an important resource for testing DNA blots of large-fragment restriction-enzyme digests from NF1 patient cell lines, to detect rearrangements in patients' DNA and to identify the 17;22 NF1 translocation breakpoint.\r"

  ".W": "The von Recklinghausen neurofibromatosis (NF1) locus has been linked to chromosome 17, and recent linkage analyses place the gene on the proximal long arm. NF1 probably resides in 17q11.2, since two unrelated NF1 patients have been identified who possess constitutional reciprocal translocations involving 17q11.2 with chromosomes 1 and 22. We have used a somatic-cell hybrid from the t(17;22) individual, along with other hybrid cell lines, to order probes around the NF1 locus. An additional probe, 17L1, has been isolated from a NotI linking library made from flow-sorted chromosome 17 material and has been mapped to a region immediately proximal to the translocation breakpoint. While neither NF1 translocation breakpoint has yet been identified by pulse-field gel analysis, an overlap between two probes, EW206 and EW207, has been detected. Furthermore, we have identified the breakpoint in a non-NF1 translocation, SP-3, on the proximal side of the NF1 locus. This breakpoint has been helpful in creating a 1,000-kb pulsed-field map, which includes the closely linked NF1 probes HHH202 and TH17.19. The combined somatic-cell hybrid and pulsed-field gel analysis we report here favors the probe order D17Z1-HHH202-TH17.19-CRYB1-17L1-NF1- (EW206, EW207, EW203, L581, L946)-(ERBB2, ERBA1). The agreement in probe ordering between linkage analysis and physical mapping is excellent, and the availability of translocation breakpoints in NF1 should now greatly assist the cloning of this locus.\r"

With specimens from 142 families and more than 700 affected persons, eight teams used 31 markers in the pericentric region of chromosome 17 to perform 13,838 genotypings. With the combined data, we used the computer program CRI-MAP to build the most likely sequence of loci by sequentially adding single loci to a fixed pair of loci and separately calculating the likelihood of all permutations of four consecutive loci. The best order is pter-pA10-41-EW301-centromere (p17H8)-pHHH202-NF1-EW206-EW207-EW203++ +-CRI-L581-CRI-L946-HOX2-NGFR-qter. The total genetic distance from pA10-41 to NGFR is 26 cM in males and 56 cM in females, and the overall difference in sex-specific maps is statistically significant (P = .006). The upper 99% confidence limits of the recombination fraction of the closest proximal marker, pHHH202, is 4%, and that for the closest distal marker, EW206, is 9%. These limits should decrease with the use of additional probes and the further evaluation of DNA from the six persons showing multiple recombinations within short genetic distances. Clinical application is technically feasible with currently available markers, although its appropriate use for prenatal and presymptomatic diagnosis requires further discussion and evaluation.\r"

Three additional markers (HHH202, CRI-L581, and CRI-L946) were included in the analyses. Recombinants within the cluster of seven unordered marker loci were identified by pairwise analyses for each family and by examining the within-sibship segregation patterns for different markers. Changes in the segregation pattern for different loci define genetic breakpoints. Given that interference is complete in the region, markers with the same segregation pattern lie on one side of the breakpoint, while markers with different segregation patterns lie on opposite sides of the breakpoint. If the order of boundary markers is known, markers on each side of a breakpoint can be oriented in relation to the centromere. The order cen-(HHH202/NF1)-(EW207)-(EW203/CRI-L581)- (CRI-L946)-(HOX-2/NGFR)-qter was inferred by combining information from physical breakpoints in a panel of mouse/human hybrids and information from genetic breakpoints found in 16 NF1 families.\r"

The serum IFN-gamma levels were analyzed by radioimmunoassay in 32 of the patients: the IFN-gamma levels were alike in the acute and convalescent phases and the control subjects. Neutralization with specific antisera against IFN-alpha, -beta, and -gamma on 15 serum samples of 11 patients with elevated IFN activity showed a complex pattern that indicates that the antiviral activity was due to a mixture of IFNs and possibly also due to other factors.

We analyzed all adult otolaryngology hospital admissions (N = 1589) during a three-year period (1985 through 1987) to a large northeastern academic medical center. Hospital resource consumption, measured by hospital length of stay and total hospital cost per patient, rose with age for ER and non-ER admissions. Severity of illness, clinical resource utilization, and mortality demonstrated these same characteristics. Diagnosis related group prospective hospital payment generated financial risk for ER admissions and elderly patients. Analysis demonstrated ER admission as more predictive of subsequent hospital resource consumption and outcome with changes in age compared with non-ER admission. Our findings suggest that in the future physicians and hospitals may find that age and the route of admission may be useful in stratifying patients regarding cost and outcome.\r"

Humoral factors that activate PMNs after thrombin-induced pulmonary microembolism were characterized in pulmonary lymph obtained from unanesthetized sheep challenged with intravenous infusion of alpha-thrombin. Time-dependent increases in PMN migration, aggregation, and superoxide anion (O2-) generation were induced by the pulmonary lymph obtained within 20 minutes after thrombin infusion. The pulmonary lymph neutrophil activating factors present in ether extracts of lymph had retention times of leukotriene B4 (LTB4) and monohydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids (HETEs) by high-performance liquid chromatography. The postthrombin lymph samples containing the LTB4 and HETEs increased PMN O2- generation and endothelial monolayer permeability to 125I-albumin in the presence of PMNs layered on the endothelial monolayers. Control lymph samples replete with LTB4, 5-HETE, and 15-HETE induced increases in PMN O2- generation and endothelial monolayer permeability to 125I-albumin in the presence of PMNs layered on the endothelial monolayers. Maximal increases in PMN O2- production and endothelial permeability occurred when LTB4, 5-HETE, and 15-HETE were coincubated with PMNs, indicating a synergistic action of these mediators in inducing PMN activation. Endothelial monolayer permeability to 125I-albumin did not increase with postthrombin lymph samples obtained after pretreatment with the 5-lipoxygenase inhibitor, L-651,392. The results indicate that lipoxygenase products generated in the lungs after thrombin-induced microembolism contribute to increased endothelial permeability secondary to PMN activation.\r"

Two variables (Dco and resting SaO2) were found to correlate strongly with mean exercise SaO2 (multiple r = 0.80; p less than 0.00001) and accounted for 65 percent of the variability among patients. The PaCO2 influenced resting SaO2 but had no independent influence on exercise SaO2. Subsequently, the model of mean exercise SaO2 derived in the present analysis was found to accurately predict mean exercise SaO2 in a group of 19 similar patients (r = 0.85; p less than 0.0001). While these findings do not establish a cause-and-effect relationship, they may provide clinicians with further insight as to which patients are likely to desaturate during exercise.\r"

Many states are using DRG prospective \"all payor systems\" for hospital reimbursement (based on the federal model). In All Payor Systems, Medicare, Medicaid, Blue Cross and other commercial insurers pay by the DRG mode; New York State has been All Payor since 1/1/88. This study simulated DRG All Payor methods on a large sample (n = 1,662) of pulmonary medicine patients for a two-year period using both federal and New York DRG reimbursement now in effect at our hospital. Medicare patients had (on average) a longer hospital length of stay and total hospital cost compared to patients from Medicaid, Blue Cross, and other commercial payors. Medicare patients also had a greater severity of illness compared to patients from Blue Cross Medicaid or other payors. All payors, however, (Medicaid, Blue Cross, Medicare and commercial insurers) generated significant financial risk under the DRG All Payor scheme. These data suggest that federal, state, and private payors may be underreimbursing for the care of the hospitalized pulmonary medicine patients using the DRG prospective hospital payment scheme. Health care financing policy, as demonstrated in this study, may limit both the access and quality of care for many pulmonary medicine patients in the future.\r"

Microscopic examination of a biopsy specimen from a mediastinal lymph node revealed noncaseating epithelioid cell granulomas. Since granulomatous diseases of infectious origin and sarcoid reaction were reasonably excluded, she was diagnosed as having pulmonary sarcoidosis. Bronchoalveolar lavage findings were atypical in that the ratio of helper T cells to suppressor T cells (CD4/8 ratio) was 0.5 in two separate examinations, despite a moderately increased proportion of lymphocytes. Immunohistochemical examination of the lymph node also showed a predominancy of suppressor T cells. The inversion of the CD4/8 ratio suggests the presence of heterogeneity in the immunoregulatory mechanism in pulmonary sarcoidosis and may have a prognostic significance.\r"

The study group consisted of 78 patients with angiographically documented emboli who had blood gas samples obtained while breathing room air. None had a prior history of cardiopulmonary disease. Hypoxemia was present in 59 patients (76 percent), hypoxemia or hypocapnia in 73 patients (93 percent), an increased P(A-a)O2 gradient in 74 patients (95 percent), and an increased P(A-a)O2 gradient or hypocapnia in 77 patients (98 percent). Only one patient with acute embolism showed a normal P(A-a)O2 gradient and normal PaCO2 breathing room air. These results suggest that a normal P(A-a)O2 gradient and a normal PaCO2 obtained in a patient during room air breathing can be used as evidence against the presence of pulmonary emboli.\r"

  ".W": "At the onset of exercise, both cardiac output and ventilation increase abruptly. We investigated the hypothesis that a rapid change in cardiac output, as effected by an immediate increase in heart rate at the start of exercise and a decrease in heart rate at the termination of exercise, affects the responses of oxygen uptake. Five patients in whom programmable pacemakers had been previously inserted for complete heart block were studied. Responses in ventilation and gas exchange were recorded breath by breath during studies in which each subject performed 16 transitions between rest and moderate exercise on a cycle ergometer. In a randomized fashion, in half of the transitions, heart rate was accelerated from a low rate to a high rate as exercise began; in the other half, heart rate was held constant at the low rate as exercise began. Oxygen uptake increased by 30 percent in the first 20 seconds of exercise, when heart rate was constrained, while it increased by 70 percent when heart rate was abruptly accelerated. Similarly, smaller changes were observed at the cessation of exercise when the heart rate was constrained, as compared to an abrupt decrease in heart rate. Despite this difference in the responses of oxygen uptake, at the transitions in exercise, the ventilatory responses were indistinguishable. We have demonstrated that ventilation-independent changes in oxygen uptake can be induced at the onset and cessation of exercise. These alterations in oxygen uptake are predictable from differences in blood flow which occur as a consequence of the differences in time course of the heart rate.\r"

  ".W": "The regulation of GRF secretion was studied using a fetal rat hypothalamic cell culture system. The cells were subjected to short term release experiments on days 10-18 after plating, and GRF secretion was assessed by RIA. The identity of GRF immunoreactivity in the incubation medium was confirmed by reverse phase liquid chromatographic analysis. Depolarization of the cells with 56 mM K+ evoked a 4-fold increase in basal GRF release. When cultures were pretreated for 6 days with the adenylate cyclase activator forskolin, basal GRF release was augmented in subsequent release experiments to levels 2-fold greater than those in the control cultures. In nonpretreated cultures, forskolin (1-100 microM) and the protein kinase C activator phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (10 nM-1 microM), stimulated basal GRF release in a dose-dependent fashion. The Ca2+ channel blocker verapamil (100 microM) significantly inhibited the GRF response to both forskolin and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate. The gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) agonist muscimol (0.1-10 microM) inhibited forskolin-stimulated, but not K+ stimulated, GRF release in a dose-dependent manner. This inhibition was reversed by the GABA antagonists bicuculline and picrotoxinin. Muscimol (10 microM) slightly suppressed basal GRF release. The present findings suggest that GRF secretion can be evoked by agents known to increase intracellular cAMP levels or activate protein kinase-C. They also support a role for GABA in the inhibitory control of GRF secretion.\r"

  ".U": "89078231\r", 
  ".W": "The ovine GH (oGH) response to GRF (1-44 amide) was evaluated in 74 chronically catheterized fetal and neonatal lambs. After a 1-h control period, GRF was administered iv, and the oGH response was studied during the next 60 min. The following variables were analyzed: GRF dose, fetal or neonatal age, breeding season, and singleton or multiple pregnancy. One and 10 micrograms/kg GRF elicited a similar oGH response, which was greater (P less than 0.001) than the response to 0.1 microgram/kg GRF. GRF-stimulated oGH release was strikingly age dependent. The mean peak incremental oGH response in fetuses of 89-122 days gestation (294 +/- 55 ng/ml) was higher (P less than 0.05) than that in fetuses of 127-145 days gestation (136 +/- 19 ng/ml); the fetal response was much greater (P less than 0.005) than the mean peak increment in neonatal lambs (46 +/- 7 ng/ml). A remarkable difference in basal and GRF-induced oGH secretion was observed in both fetuses and lambs of ewes bred in the normal breeding season (on-season) and those bred out of season (off-season). In the neonatal lamb, the mean basal oGH concentration was higher (P less than 0.005) in the on-season (12 +/- 2 ng/ml) than in the off-season (7 +/- 0.5 ng/ml) neonatal lambs, as was the mean peak incremental oGH response to GRF (70 +/- 12 vs. 33 +/- 7 ng/ml; P less than 0.01). In contrast, in singleton, late gestational fetuses (127-145 days), the mean basal oGH concentration was lower (P less than 0.03) in the on-season (74 +/- 9 ng/ml) than in the off-season (124 +/- 18 ng/ml) fetuses, as was the mean peak incremental oGH response to GRF (136 +/- 9 vs. 292 +/- 41 ng/ml; P less than 0.005). Further, compared to the on-season, late gestational singletons, on-season twin fetuses had higher (P less than 0.0001) basal oGH levels (199 +/- 19 ng/ml) and peak incremental oGH responses (248 +/- 11 ng/ml). Moreover, off-season twin fetuses had the highest basal GH concentrations and the most striking increment in GH concentration after GRF treatment of any of the groups. The strikingly age-dependent pattern of the GRF-induced oGH response in fetal and neonatal lambs is compatible with the concept that the inhibitory influences or their effects on the somatotrope increase gradually during late gestation and sharply at birth.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "In the present investigation, sodium fluoride (NaF) was employed to explore the role of guanine nucleotide-binding proteins (G-proteins), protein kinase-C, or cytosolic calcium [( Ca]i) in the regulation of cytosolic pH [( pH]i) in dispersed bovine parathyroid cells, using the pH-sensitive fluorescent dye BCECF. When cells acidified by nigericin in Na-free medium were resuspended in Na-containing buffer, [pH]i returned to basal levels. This recovery was blocked by continued removal of Na+ or the addition of amiloride. NaF (10 mM) increased [32P]phosphate incorporation into phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate, suggesting an increase in phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate turnover. NaF caused an initial acidification, followed by an alkaline recovery in a dose-dependent manner (1-10 mM). Amiloride blocked the NaF-induced alkaline recovery. The protein kinase-C activator phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (10(-7) M) caused cytosolic alkalinization, while the protein kinase-C inhibitor H7 (6 x 10(-5) M) significantly inhibited the NaF-induced alkaline recovery. Pertussis toxin (1 microgram/ml) did not affect the NaF-induced changes in [pH]i. Removal of extracellular Ca2+ with EGTA blocked the NaF-induced increase in [Ca]i and alkaline recovery. Ionomycin (5 x 10(-7) M) caused cytosolic alkalinization, but pretreatment with EGTA inhibited the ionomycin-induced cytosolic alkalinization. The present studies clearly demonstrated the presence of an amiloride-sensitive Na+/H+ exchanger in parathyroid cells. Our findings suggest that the NaF-induced cytosolic alkaline recovery was via two complementing pathways: 1) activation of protein kinase-C, followed by stimulation of a Na+/H+ exchanger, and 2) existence of extracellular calcium and/or an increase in [Ca]i.\r"

The basal concentrations of calcium were 148 +/- 5.0 and 137 +/- 3.7 nM in the presence and absence of 1 mM extracellular calcium, respectively. Oxytocin, carbachol, and norepinephrine rapidly and transiently increased intracellular free calcium, with half-maximal effects at 0.19, 9.9, and 5.3 microM, respectively. The maximal effects of these agents were reduced by 57%, 32%, and 36%, respectively, when the extracellular calcium was replaced by 2 mM EGTA. Pretreatment with pertussis toxin partially (47-57%) inhibited the contractant-induced increase in intracellular free calcium in the presence of 1 mM extracellular CaCl2 and produced an even greater inhibition (76-98%) in the absence of extracellular calcium. Pretreatment with D600 (30 microM) or amiloride (50 microM) and reduction of extracellular sodium did not affect the oxytocin-induced calcium increase. However, adenosine and the A2-receptor agonist N-ethylcarboxamidoadenosine did attenuate the effect of oxytocin in a dose-dependent manner. These data represent the first direct evidence that oxytocin, carbachol, and norepinephrine increase the intracellular free calcium concentration in the rat myometrium. The data suggest that contractants mobilize calcium from both extracellular and intracellular sources, the latter involving a pertussis toxin-sensitive mechanism.\r"

  ".U": "89078241\r", 
  ".W": "The regulation of tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA) in rat oocytes during the periovulatory period, in early embryos, and in oocytes during induced follicular atresia was studied using a quantitative chromogenic substrate assay. Oocytes and early embryos were collected from three ovulation models: 1) intact immature female rats treated with PMSG, followed by hCG 48 h later; 2) hypophysectomized immature rats treated with PMSG, followed by a GnRH agonist (GnRHa) 56 h later; and 3) adult cyclic rats on the mornings of proestrus and estrus and up to 5 days after fertilization. In addition, follicular atresia was induced by either withdrawal of diethylstilbestrol (DES) for 2 days or injection of GnRHa for 2 days in hypophysectomized DES-implanted immature rats. Treatment with PMSG alone did not increase oocyte tPA content (5-20 microIU/oocyte) in either immature rat model, but treatment with either hCG or GnRHa induced meiotic maturation and ovulation and increased tPA activity to 80 and 140 microIU/oocyte 24 h after hCG and GnRHa treatment, respectively. Northern blot analysis of total RNA extracted from oocytes of PMSG-treated rats indicated the presence of a specific tPA message at 22S. tPA levels were low in preovulatory oocytes obtained on proestrus morning and increased in ovulated oocytes on estrus morning. After fertilization, tPA levels remained high in the embryos on days 1-4 of pregnancy, but dropped dramatically on day 5. Furthermore, oocytes from atretic follicles of hypophysectomized DES-implanted rats after either DES withdrawal or GnRHa treatment contained elevated levels of tPA, coincident with germinal vesicle breakdown (GVBD). Immunohistochemical staining revealed tPA antigen only in those oocytes that had undergone apparent meiotic maturation, as confirmed by GVBD. Thus, oocytes contain tPA mRNA and synthesize the active protease under a variety of stimuli which result in GVBD. The observed periovulatory increase in oocyte tPA activity, its maintenance until day 5 of pregnancy, and expression of tPA in nonovulatory oocytes of atretic follicles suggest diverse functions for the oocyte and embryo tPA.\r"

  ".W": "We used pertussis toxin to study the mechanism(s) by which divalent cations lower cellular cAMP content in bovine parathyroid cells. In cultured parathyroid cells, high extracellular Ca2+ (5 mM) or Mg2+ (5-10 mM) lowers dopamine-stimulated cAMP content by 70-90%. Pertussis toxin (0.5 microgram/ml) totally blocks the inhibitory effects of Ca2+ and Mg2+ on cAMP content. Ba2+ and Sr2+ (5 mM) also lower cAMP content by 80-90%, and this effect is, likewise, blocked by pertussis toxin. Pretreatment with pertussis toxin had no effect on the release of cAMP into the extracellular fluid. The toxin also did not modify phosphodiesterase activity in sonicates of parathyroid cells (42.68 +/- 3.26 vs. 47.00 +/- 2.82 pmol cAMP hydrolyzed/10(6) cells.20 min in control and toxin-treated cells, respectively). Moreover, addition of the phosphodiesterase inhibitor isobutyl-methylxanthine did not modify the inhibition of dopamine-stimulated cAMP accumulation by 5 mM Ca2+ in control cells (85% vs. 86% inhibition, respectively, with and without isobutylmethylxanthine). Pertussis toxin-catalyzed ADP ribosylation in homogenates of control cells demonstrated the presence of two substrates with mol wt of 40K and 41K. Preexposure of cells to pertussis toxin overnight resulted in the complete loss of both substrates on subsequent ADP ribosylation with [32P]NAD. Pertussis toxin pretreatment did not enhance adenylate cyclase activity indirectly via reducing the extracellular Ca2+-induced rise in cytosolic Ca2+, since the cytosolic Ca2+ level at 5 mM Ca2+ was about 60% higher in pertussis toxin-treated than in control cells (531 +/- 85 vs. 326 +/- 35 nM; P less than 0.05). In addition, ionomycin had no significant effect on cellular cAMP levels in control cells despite increasing the cytosolic Ca2+ concentration to levels as high as 1700 nM at 10(-5) M. Thus, changes in cytosolic Ca2+ phosphodiesterase activity, or efflux of cAMP from the cell cannot explain the inhibition of cAMP accumulation by divalent cations or the reversal of this effect by pertussis toxin. Instead, the present data suggest that extracellular divalent cations modulate the formation of cellular cAMP in parathyroid cells by a process involving a pertussis toxin-sensitive guanine nucleotide regulatory protein, presumably inhibition of adenylate cyclase by Gi via a receptor-like mechanism.\r"

GDP and cAMP had no effect while the nonhydrolyzable ATP analogs 5'-adenylylimidodiphosphate and adenosine 5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) did elicit a significant reduction in GRF binding. The effect of GppNHp was half-maximal at 0.2 microM, and the maximum inhibition achieved was 85%. The effect of 0.1 microM GppNHp on GRF competitive displacement experiments indicated a significant reduction in affinity for the ligand (Kd = 0.51 +/- 0.11 nM in the absence of GppNHp and 2.1 +/- 1.1 nM in its presence) without an effect on receptor number. The GRF radioligand dissociates slowly from its receptor (t1/2 = 250 +/- 50 min), but the addition of 0.1 microM GppNHp converts approximately half of the receptors present to a more rapidly dissociating form (t1/2 = 9 +/- 10 min). These results are consistent with existing models for receptor-G-protein interactions, and thus, we conclude that transduction of the GRF response across the cell membrane involves a guanine nucleotide-binding protein, presumably Gs.\r"

A low dose of GnRHA (125 micrograms/kg.day) given to female rats for 1, 3, or 7 days resulted in suppression of serum FSH and LH levels by 7 days to 50% and 40%, respectively, of ovariectomized control values. LH beta mRNA levels decreased in a time-dependent manner, so that by 7 days, LH beta mRNA levels were less than those in intact controls. There were significant but less dramatic declines in alpha and FSH beta mRNA levels. A higher dose of GnRHA (500 micrograms/kg.day) for 7 or 14 days administered to castrate male or female rats resulted in inhibition of serum LH and FSH to or below levels in intact controls. At this dose, all three gonadotropin subunit mRNA levels fell from castrate values toward or below those in intact controls. Thus, although low dose GnRHA administration suppressed LH beta mRNA more than FSH beta mRNA levels, high dose GnRHA treatment resulted in equal suppression of all three gonadotropin subunits. No stimulatory effects on alpha-subunit mRNA levels were observed with either dose of GnRHA. We conclude that the pretranslational control of gonadotropin subunit biosynthesis is GnRH dependent. Adequate dose and length of administration of the potent Nal-Glu GnRHA results in suppression of both the serum gonadotropins FSH and LH and the mRNAs for FSH beta, LH beta, and alpha-subunit in female and male rats.\r"

Conversely, alpha ANF-(5-28), at concentrations of 10 pM to 10 nM, had no effect on ACTH secretion after 0.5, 1, or 3 h. alpha ANF-(1-11) weakly inhibited ACTH secretion at concentrations of 100 and 1000 pM. Again, these effects were observed after 3 h, but not after 0.5 or 1 h, of incubation. These results suggest that ANF-induced inhibition of CRF-stimulated ACTH release requires 1) an intact N-terminal sequence of the ANF peptide, 2) low concentrations, and 3) more than 1 h of incubation. The results explain previous negative evidence and suggest that alpha ANF-(1-28) may be a physiological inhibitor of ACTH secretion.\r"

  ".W": "We have used the unilaterally ovariectomized (ULO) rat as an experimental model to assess transient relationships between follicular recruitment and inhibin mRNA levels in the ovary. Animals were divided into three experimental groups (ULO, sham-operated, and intact) and killed 0, 9, or 24 h postsurgery. Inhibin alpha- and beta A mRNA were measured within individual ovarian follicles by in situ hybridization. Serum FSH concentrations in ULO animals increased significantly at 9 h and returned to presurgery levels by 24 h. There was no effect of surgery on serum LH concentrations. In the ULO animals, compensatory follicular recruitment was observed in the remaining ovary at 24 h as a significant increase in the number of follicles with mean diameter greater than 350 micron. Two distinct populations of healthy maturing follicles, based on diameter and hybridization intensity, were observed in ovaries from 24 h post-ULO rats. The first class, NRF-1 (newly recruited follicle-1), were those recruited 48 h previously by the secondary FSH surge of the preceding cycle. These large follicles (greater than 500 micron mean diameter) hybridized to both inhibin probes. The second class of follicles (NRF-2), which represent those newly recruited by the ULO-induced increase in serum FSH, were smaller in size than NRF-1 (350-500 micron mean diameter). The intensity of hybridization of both inhibin probes to NRF-1 was higher than that to NRF-2 in the majority of follicles. Each NRF-1 contained higher levels of both alpha- and beta A-inhibin mRNA than nonrecruited follicles (150-350 micron diameter). These data suggest that subtle changes in serum FSH concentrations, which are sufficient to induce follicular recruitment into a size class capable of ovulating within a given cycle, play the additional role of enhancing inhibin mRNA levels in developing follicles.\r"

  ".W": "Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF alpha) and interferon-gamma (IFN gamma) have potent effects on bone resorption and collagen synthesis in cultured rat long bones. Since the effects of TNF alpha and IFN gamma may result from interaction with multiple cell types, we studied the effects of these cytokines on the synthesis of DNA and collagen in one cell type with osteoblast phenotype, cloned rat osteosarcoma cells (ROS 17/2.8). Recombinant human TNF alpha did not affect DNA synthesis after 48 h with concentrations of 10(-11)-10(-8) M and inhibited DNA synthesis slightly at 10(-6) M. Recombinant rat IFN gamma (5-500 U/ml) caused a dose-dependent inhibition of DNA synthesis. Coincubation with TNF alpha and IFN gamma inhibited DNA synthesis more than maximal doses of either cytokine alone. This enhanced inhibitory effect was due to the induction of a response to TNF alpha by IFN gamma, since preexposure of cells to IFN gamma for 24 h, followed by incubation with TNF alpha alone for an additional 48 h, also resulted in increased inhibition of DNA synthesis. Preexposure to TNF alpha for 24 h, followed by IFN gamma alone, did not increase the inhibition of DNA synthesis. Incubation with either IFN gamma (5-500 U/ml) or TNF alpha (10(-10)-10(-6) M) inhibited the incorporation of [3H]proline into collagen. Coincubation with intermediate concentrations of both cytokines resulted in an inhibitory effect greater than that produced by maximal concentrations of either alone. The results indicate that 1) IFN gamma and TNF alpha have direct actions on osteoblast-like cells in vitro; 2) IFN gamma modulates the DNA response to TNF alpha; and 3) the greater responses to combined cytokines than to high doses of either alone suggest that these cytokines act, at least in part, through different pathways.\r"

  ".W": "The effect of chronic estrogen treatment on the anterior pituitary D2 dopamine receptor was studied by treating rats with diethylstilbestrol (DES) over a 6-week period. DES treatment resulted in an increase in anterior pituitary weight and PRL content and serum PRL levels compared to those in sham-treated controls. The status of the anterior pituitary D2 dopamine receptor was evaluated using both radioligand binding and adenylate cyclase assays. [125I]N-(p-aminophenethyl)spiroperidol [( 125I]NAPS), a derivative of the D2-selective antagonist spiperone, was used to quantitate D2 receptors. Saturation analysis of [125I]NAPS binding indicated that DES treatment had no effect on the affinity or maximum binding capacity of the radioligand for the D2 receptor. Competition analysis with unlabeled D2 antagonists for [125I]NAPS binding also indicated that DES treatment did not affect antagonist interactions with the receptor. In contrast, the interactions of agonists with the D2 receptors from DES-treated rats were modified, as assessed through [125I]NAPS competition analysis. Using control tissue, agonist competition curves revealed both high and low affinity agonist binding states of the receptor. In the presence of guanine nucleotides, the high affinity agonist binding state is abolished, reflecting coupling of the receptor with a guanine nucleotide regulatory (G) protein. In DES-treated tissue, agonist competition curves indicated the presence of only low affinity agonist binding, with minimal effects of guanine nucleotides, suggesting uncoupling of receptor-G-protein interactions. The functionality of the D2 receptor was further assessed by examining dopaminergic inhibition of vasoactive intestinal peptide-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity. Although DES treatment resulted in a reduction of vasoactive intestinal peptide-stimulated enzyme activity itself, the ability of dopaminergic agonists to inhibit this activity was reduced by about 50%. These results suggest that estrogen is capable of attenuating the functional coupling of the D2 receptor with its biochemical effector system in the anterior pituitary gland.\r"

  ".U": "89078267\r", 
  ".W": "Human thyroglobulin (TG) is one of a growing number of glycoproteins that are known to contain sulfate. Among these TG is unusual because it contains sulfate on both its asparagine-linked complex carbohydrate units and its single chondroitin 6-SO4 unit. We incubated tissue fragments prepared from normal and neoplastic thyroid tissue with [35S]sulfate to study the incorporation of sulfate into these two types of carbohydrate acceptor sites. Incubation conditions (0.1 mM sulfate for 16 h) were selected that maintained linear incorporation of [35S]sulfate and retention of more than 90% of iodinated TG in the tissue. Enzyme susceptibility was used to determine incorporation into the complex carbohydrate units (endoglycosidase-F) and the chondroitin 6-SO4 unit (chondroitin ABC lyase). In a representative experiment, 29.8% of the incorporated sulfate was found in the chondroitin 6-SO4 unit during the first hour of incubation. This increased progressively to 72.5% in the chondroitin unit during the incubation period from 8-16 h. A reciprocal decrease occurred in the proportion of sulfate incorporated into the complex carbohydrate units. TG released into the medium and retained in the tissue had the same ratio of sulfate in the two types of carbohydrate units. Neoplastic thyroid tissue incorporated more [35S]sulfate into TG than normal thyroid tissue from the same patient. Neoplastic and normal tissue differed further in the ratios of sulfate incorporated into the two types of carbohydrate units. We conclude that the incorporation of sulfate into the two types of sulfate-containing carbohydrate units of TG does not occur in a fixed ratio and that this differential incorporation of sulfate does not appear to be related to its release from the tissue.\r"

After 2 days in culture, the cells were exposed to stimuli with or without test substances for 10 h, followed by evaluation of GnRH binding sites using iodinated GnRH-A (Buserelin) as tracer. Inhibin suppressed GnRH-induced up-regulation of GnRH binding sites in a dose-dependent manner with an IC50 of 0.13 U/ml (5.5 pM). The inhibin-related peptides transforming growth factor-beta, and Mullerian inhibitory substance had no detectable effect (stimulatory or inhibitory), suggesting that the action is specific to inhibin. In addition, inhibin inhibited the calcium ionophore A23187-induced up-regulation of GnRH binding sites, indicating that this effect of inhibin can occur, at least in part, at a stage subsequent to Ca2+ mobilization. Inhibin did not compete with iodinated GnRH-A for GnRH binding sites. In conclusion, pure 31 kilodalton bovine inhibin suppressed GnRH-induced up-regulation of GnRH binding sites in cultured rat anterior pituitary cells, providing direct evidence that inhibin modulates delayed actions of GnRH.\r"

The cumulus-oocyte complexes were isolated from pregnant mare serum gonadotropin (PMSG)/human CG (hCG)-treated 25 day rats and examined in culture. It is shown that P-450scc is not expressed in the cumulus cell earlier than 2-3 h before ovulation. After ovulation, the expression of P-450scc rapidly increased, so that postovulatory cumuli contained ample amounts of the cytochrome. RIA of progestins secreted by the cumulus-oocyte complexes in culture corroborated the immunocytochemical observations. A single administration of LH or PMSG treatment of hypophysectomized rat did not result in P-450scc accumulation. However, this failure of hormonal responses in vivo was not due to lack of available receptors, since both FSH and LH could induce cAMP accumulation and P-450scc when added to isolated cumuli in culture. Therefore, these findings suggest the presence of a putative intraovarian suppressive factor(s) which disappears before ovulation and thus render(s) the cumulus cells permissive for P-450scc responsiveness. An additional intriguing aspect of P-450scc responsiveness to gonadotropins was revealed in experiments showing that 60% of the cultured cumulus complexes failed to accumulate P-450scc in response to hormones, if collected from 21 day animals. Interestingly, those P-450scc negative cumuli were always associated with an oocyte which did not resume meiotic maturation. We may therefore suggest that meiotic incompetence of the oocyte is also accompanied by functional incompetence of its embracing cumulus cells which cannot, for yet unclear reasons, acquire their steroidogenic capacity.\r"

  ".U": "89078276\r", 
  ".W": "Indirect evidence has suggested a role for plasminogen activator (PA) in ovulation. Our recent studies demonstrated that 1) tissue-type PA (tPA) is the predominant PA produced by preovulatory rat follicles in response to gonadotropins or GnRH; and 2) several inhibitors of the serine proteases, to which PA and plasmin belong, block ovulation. Here, the role of tPA and plasmin in ovulation was examined directly by the use of specific antibodies to tPA and alpha 2-antiplasmin (alpha 2AP). Immature female rats at 25-26 days of age were treated (sc) with 15 IU PMSG to induce multiple preovulatory follicles. Fifty-four hours later, tPA antibodies and alpha 2AP were injected into one of the ovarian bursae to check their ability to block ovulation, which was initiated with an ovulatory dose (4 IU) of hCG. The data are expressed as percent inhibition of ovulation in the treated vs. the untreated ovaries. A significant decrease in the ovulation rate was obtained by administration of 500 micrograms antibodies to tPA (39.6%) or 1-50 micrograms alpha 2AP (36-44%), whereas minimal inhibition (12%) was found at lower doses of anti-tPA (10 micrograms) or alpha 2AP (0.1 micrograms). Furthermore, nonimmune immunoglobulin G (500 micrograms) and heat-inactivated alpha 2AP were not effective. Anti-tPA and alpha 2AP suppressed ovulation only when injected at the time of hCG administration; later injections (4-h delay) were ineffective, suggesting that PA and plasmin are involved in the early follicular responses to the ovulatory stimulus. Histological observation of the ovaries did not reveal any pathological changes associated with the anti-tPA and alpha 2AP treatment. Suppression of ovulation, as evidenced by decreased number of tubal ova, was frequently accompanied with intraovarian release of the eggs into the follicular thecal compartment. Thus, these results provide direct evidence for an essential role of tPA and plasmin in ovulation.\r"

  ".W": "To determine whether a normal complement of androgen receptors is required to permit full expression of sex-related differences in pituitary GH secretion, we compared the GHRH-stimulated GH secretory responses of continuously perifused anterior pituitary cells from normal male, normal female, and androgen-resistant testicular feminized (Tfm) rats. In each experimental replicate, acutely dispersed pituitary cells were exposed to GHRH (0.03-100 nM) administered as 2.5-min pulses in random order at 30-min intervals. The eluate was collected in 5-min fractions for GH determination by RIA. Basal unstimulated secretion of GH by cells from male rats was greater than that by cells from female (P = 0.007) and Tfm (P = 0.03) rats; basal secretion by the other two groups was similar (P = 0.55). Linear concentration-response relationships between GHRH and GH release were defined for cells from male (P = 0.0002), female (P = 0.0001), and Tfm (P = 0.0002) rats. Overall GHRH-stimulated GH secretion by cells from male rats was greater (P less than 0.0001) than that by cells from female rats. Overall secretion by cells from Tfm rats was less (P less than 0.001) than that by cells from male rats but greater (P less than 0.001) than that by cells from female rats. For all experimental groups, body weight was strongly correlated with both basal (r2 = 0.42; P = 0.001) and GHRH-stimulated (r2 = 0.53; P = 0.0001) GH secretion by the dispersed pituitary cells. These data suggest that a deficiency of androgen receptors results in a diminution of the in vitro GH secretory capability of anterior pituitary cells to a level below that by cells from normal males, but not to the level in normal females. The intermediate position of cells from the Tfm rat may represent a partial masculinization or defeminization within this generally female phenotype.\r"

Additionally, experiments were performed to evaluate the interrelationships among changes in adenylate cyclase activity, cellular cAMP levels, and GH release induced by GRF and somatostatin. The results obtained using homogenates and membrane preparations from somatotrophs included the following. 1) GRF caused guanine nucleotide-dependent concentration-related (Ka, approximately 10(-8) M) stimulation of adenylate cyclase activity. 2) Guanine nucleotides were effective in stimulating cyclase in the absence of GRF; the concentration of guanine nucleotide required for half-maximal stimulation was decreased more than 10-fold in the presence of GRF. 3) Adenylate cyclase activity increased with increasing concentrations of free Mg2+ (0.25-20 mM); activation by GRF and guanine nucleotide resulted in an approximately 7-fold increase in the enzyme's affinity for free Mg2+. 4) Somatostatin, up to 10(-6) M, did not alter basal or GRF-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity. 5) Ca2+ (0.5-11.9 microM) produced concentration-dependent inhibition of basal (up to 28%) and GRF-stimulated (up to 47%) cyclase activities; the inhibitory effect of Ca2+ was accompanied by a decrement (2- to 3-fold) in the apparent affinities of the enzyme for both GRF and guanine nucleotide. In intact somatotrophs, GRF produced concentration-dependent stimulation of GH release (Ka, approximately 6 x 10(-11) M), preceded by a marked elevation of cAMP levels. While somatostatin blocked GRF-induced GH release, the augmented cAMP levels were only slightly reduced.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The effects of dopamine (DA) on the release of GRF and somatostatin (SRIF) from the hypothalami of adult male rats were examined in an in vitro perifusion system using horizontal hypothalamic slices, 400 micron thick, including the median eminence and arcuate nuclei. When hypothalamic slices from five animals were perfused in a chamber with artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF) at a flow rate of 100 microliters/min under a gaseous phase of 95% O2 and 5% CO2 at 37 C, rat (r) GRF- and SRIF-like immunoreactivities (-LI) were constantly detected in 30-min perifusates at least until 240 min of perifusion, and during the perifusion with 60 mM K+, the concentrations of rGRF-LI and SRIF-LI were increased 2.1 and 3.2 times, respectively, over basal values. Under the perifusion with ACSF containing normal goat gamma-globulin, the addition of 10(-8) M DA resulted in a significant increase in SRIF-LI from 8.2 +/- 0.3 to 14.3 +/- 1.5 pg/hypothalamus.30 min, but conversely, it caused a slight but significant decrease in rGRF-LI from 4.5 +/- 0.9 to 2.0 +/- 0.3 pg/hypothalamus.30 min. On the other hand, 10(-8) and 10(-6) M DA significantly stimulated rGRF-LI release from hypothalamic slices perifused with ACSF containing anti-SRIF goat gamma-globulin. These findings suggest that DA is a secretagogue for both SRIF and rGRF in the hypothalamus, but the rGRF-stimulating effect of DA is masked unless the action of endogenous SRIF is attenuated.\r"

As an inverse relationship was found to exist between carotid sinus pressure and plasma IR-ANP, a decrease in carotid sinus pressure to 60 mm Hg was used to stimulate ANP as well as VP release. The elimination of VP after iv injection involved a rapid initial phase and a slow late component, with corresponding half-life (t1/2) values of 0.9 and 5.4 min, respectively. After reduction of carotid sinus pressure to 60 mm Hg, plasma VP increased significantly within 1 min and reached a maximum at 10 min. When carotid sinus pressure was increased to 160 mm Hg to inhibit VP release, the t1/2 of VP was 1.3 min. The t1/2 of immunoreactive (IR) ANP after iv infusion was 1.2 min. Plasma IR-ANP was significantly increased 2 min after carotid sinus pressure was decreased, and a maximum was observed at 10 min. The t1/2 of IR-ANP after elevation of carotid sinus pressure to 160 mm Hg was 3.2 min. These studies indicate that both VP and IR-ANP are rapidly eliminated in the anesthetized rabbit.\r"

  ".U": "89078304\r", 
  ".W": "Serum GH concentrations in the ovine fetus are much higher than those in the neonate, and the maximal GH response induced by GRF is 5-fold greater in the fetus than in the neonate. To clarify these in vivo observations further, we studied the effects of GRF, somatostatin (SRIF), and insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) on primary cultures of fetal and neonatal ovine pituitary cells. GH secretion from fetal ovine pituitary cells increased from 148 +/- 34 to 950 +/- 130 ng/10(5) cells.3 h in response to 1 nM GRF, whereas GH secretion from neonatal pituitary cells rose from 113 +/- 26 to 1221 +/- 129 ng/10(5) cells.3 h, a significantly greater response (P less than 0.001). This greater GRF-induced GH response in neonatal than fetal cells differs from the response in vivo and suggests that the increased in vivo response in the fetus is not due to inherently increased sensitivity of pituitary cells to GRF. SRIF (10 nM) decreased maximal GRF-induced GH secretion by 37 +/- 3% in fetal cells compared with 59 +/- 8% in neonatal cells (P less than 0.01). This may explain in part the decreased in vivo sensitivity to SRIF in the ovine fetus compared to that in the neonatal lamb. In fetal pituitary cells, 10 nM GRF increased ovine (o) GH mRNA from 100 +/- 14% to 145 +/- 40%, SRIF decreased oGH mRNA to 84 +/- 3%, and GRF and SRIF in combination increased fetal oGH mRNA to 126 +/- 24%. Values in neonatal pituitary cell cultures were similar (control, 100 +/- 17%; GRF, 132 +/- 6%, SRIF, 85 +/- 15%; GRF plus SRIF, 105 +/- 26%). Pretreating fetal cells with 100 nM IGF-I for 3 days reduced GRF-stimulated GH secretion from 1049 +/- 38 to 232 +/- 8 ng/10(5) cells.3 h (P less than 0.001). Similarly, IGF-I pretreatment of neonatal cells reduced GRF-stimulated GH secretion from 810 +/- 18 to 419 +/- 16 ng/10(5) cells.3 h (P less than 0.001). The mean secreted IGF-I was 0.58 U/ml (36 nM) in culture medium from neonatal cells and was unchanged by incubation for 3 days with 5 micrograms/ml hGH. Secreted IGF-I in medium from fetal cells was 0.87 U/ml (54 nM) without GH and 0.81 U/ml (51 nM) after incubation with human GH. IGF-I mRNA was present in neonatal pituitary and brain.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

Young and middle-aged rats were OVX for 1 week. LT-OVX rats were OVX at 2-3 months of age and used when they were 10-12 months old. All animals were implanted with Silastic capsules containing estradiol (E2) in sesame oil and killed 3 or 8 days later. Anterior pituitaries were collected, and cells were dispersed and prepared for the reverse hemolytic plaque assay. Three days after E2 was implanted, the percentage of anterior pituitary cells that secrete PRL was higher in middle-aged compared to young rats. LT-OVX prevented this increase; the percentage of cells secreting PRL was significantly lower in LT-OVX than in both young and middle-aged rats. Basal secretion of PRL per cell was not different in young compared to middle-aged rats and was significantly lower in LT-OVX than in either young or middle-aged rats. TRH induced similar increases in plaque size in young and middle-aged rats, but had no effect in LT-OVX rats. DA (10(-7) M) inhibited plaque size only in LT-OVX rats; however, higher concentrations of DA were equally effective in the three experimental groups. Eight days after E2 was implanted, the percentage of cells that secrete PRL increased in LT-OVX rats, but was still significantly lower than that in middle-aged animals. After 8 days of E2 treatment, PRL release was similar in the three experimental groups under basal conditions. In LT-OVX rats TRH produced a small increase in PRL secretion (30-40%); DA suppressed PRL release in a similar manner in the three groups. These data demonstrate that middle-aged rats exhibit an increase in the percentage of cells secreting PRL without a concomitant detectable change in the amount of PRL released by single cells and/or a change in responsiveness to TRH or DA. Long term estrogen deprivation prevents this age-related change, suppresses responsiveness to TRH, and enhances sensitivity to DA.\r"

  ".W": "Maitotoxin, a toxin derived from a marine dinoflagellate, is a potent activator of voltage-sensitive calcium channels. To further test the hypothesis that inhibition of PTH secretion by calcium is mediated via a calcium channel we studied the effect of maitotoxin on dispersed bovine parathyroid cells. Maitotoxin inhibited PTH release in a dose-dependent fashion, and inhibition was maximal at 1 ng/ml. Chelation of extracellular calcium by EGTA blocked the inhibition of PTH by maitotoxin. Maitotoxin enhanced the effects of the dihydropyridine calcium channel agonist (+)202-791 and increased the rate of radiocalcium uptake in parathyroid cells. Pertussis toxin, which ADP-ribosylates and inactivates a guanine nucleotide regulatory protein that interacts with calcium channels in the parathyroid cell, did not affect the inhibition of PTH secretion by maitotoxin. Maitotoxin, by its action on calcium channels allows entry of extracellular calcium and inhibits PTH release. Our results suggest that calcium channels are involved in the release of PTH. Inhibition of PTH release by maitotoxin is not sensitive to pertussis toxin, suggesting that maitotoxin may act distal to the site interacting with a guanine nucleotide regulatory protein, or maitotoxin could interact with other ions or second messengers to inhibit PTH release.\r"

  ".W": "Abnormalities in the incorporation of heparan sulfate proteoglycan into the glomerular basement membrane have been implicated in the pathogenesis of various proteinuric states, including diabetes mellitus. To understand further the interactions between proteoglycans and glomerular extracellular matrices, glomeruli were isolated from normal and streptozocin-induced diabetic rats after in vivo exposure to 35S-labeled sulfate and were treated with heparin in vitro. Heparin treatment released a unique heparan sulfate proteoglycan from glomerular cell surface or extracellular matrix proteoglycan receptors. Another, smaller heparan sulfate proteoglycan was the most abundant proteoglycan released into medium and was released constitutively in medium with or without added heparin. While the two heparin-extracted proteoglycans copurified on anion-exchange and gel-filtration chromatographic columns, they were resolved by composite 0.6% agarose--1.8% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Glomeruli from diabetic rats contained decreased proportions of the heparin-releasable heparan sulfate proteoglycan and more constitutively released heparan sulfate proteoglycan. The apparent molecular weight and intrinsic charge of the heparin-released proteoglycan mixture and the apparent molecular weight and sulfation pattern of their 35S-labeled glycosaminoglycan chains after nitrous acid deaminative cleavage were similar in the two groups. A brief trypsin digestion of heparin-treated glomeruli released proportionately less integral membrane and extracellular matrix 35S-labeled proteoglycans and 35S-labeled glycopeptides from diabetic glomeruli than form control glomeruli. Elution of these 35S-labeled macromolecules from anion-exchange columns and migration in agarose-polyacrylamide gels were similar in the two groups. Abnormalities in proteoglycan-matrix interactions or proteoglycan processing may account for changes in the proportions of heparin- and trypsin-extracted proteoglycan compartments in diabetes.\r"

Calcium uptake into human intestinal brush border membrane vesicles represented uptake into intravesicular space as evidenced by studies of osmolality, temperature dependence, calcium ionophore A23187-induced efflux and influx, and lanthanum displacement. Calcium uptake into membrane vesicles was sodium-independent. Negative membrane potential induced by valinomycin and anion substitution studies indicated an electroneutral process. Initial rate of uptake of calcium was linear up to 30 s (Y = 0.11 + 0.02x, r = 0.99). Kinetic parameters were determined from uptake measurements at 7 s, well within the linear phase of uptake. Calcium uptake represented mediated and nonmediated components. These components showed changes along the intestinal tract. Km values of the mediated component increased aborally, being lowest in the duodenum and highest in the terminal ileum. Vmax was highest in the duodenum, followed by, in descending order, the ileum, terminal ileum, and jejunum. The nonmediated component was greatest in the duodenum and decreased aborally. The duodenum appears to have a high-affinity, high-capacity system for the transport of calcium in humans. These studies are the first to characterize calcium transport by brush border membranes of the human small intestine.\r"

Serosal exposure to deoxycholate (0.2-2 mM), cholate (2-8 mM), or taurocholate (4-80 mM), at pH 7.4, decreased acid secretion depending on the concentration and time of exposure. Mucosal application of cholate and taurocholate at pH 5.6 caused a more pronounced reduction in the apparent rate of acid secretion. Oxygen uptake and substrate oxidations were significantly inhibited by bile salts in a dose-dependent manner. At pH 7.4, 1 mM deoxycholate inhibited the respiration by 49% and the rates of oxidation by 51%, 52%, 78%, 74%, and 54% of control values, for glucose, pyruvate, succinate, acetate, and butyrate, respectively. Cholate and taurocholate were found to be less potent than deoxycholate. Tissue adenosine triphosphate concentration was decreased by 13%, 57%, and 67% with 0.5, 1, and 2 mM deoxycholate, respectively. We believe the impairment of energy metabolism could be involved in the mechanism of bile salt injury to the gastric mucosa.\r"

  ".W": "Highly purified woodchuck hepatocyte plasma membranes demonstrated tight specific binding to glutaraldehyde-polymerized serum albumin immobilized on Sepharose macrobeads. This phenomenon was characterized in detail and used for recognition of the plasma membrane constituents involved in binding of the albumin polymer. The hepatocyte membrane-polyalbumin interaction was found to be ligand-specific, saturable, and time-dependent. Other characteristics of a specific receptor-ligand interaction were also noted, including a dependence on the temperature, pH, and ionic strength of the binding medium. Kinetic studies revealed the presence of two classes of binding sites for glutaraldehyde-polymerized albumin on purified membranes. The sites mediating the saturable high-affinity binding of polymer to hepatocyte membranes could not be solubilized by Triton X-100. Binding activity of Triton-insoluble membrane residues was inhibited by heat treatment and proteolysis, and was significantly suppressed by neuroaminidase digestion. These findings suggest a glycoprotein nature for the high-affinity binding sites and indicate that the corresponding receptors apparently are tightly associated with the plasma membrane matrix. In contrast, low-affinity binding of polymeric albumin was inhibited by both Triton X-100 and pronase, was resistant to neuraminidase, and was activated by lipase, suggesting that membrane lipids are important for the binding conduct. In conclusion, these results provide clear evidence that hepatocyte plasma membranes are endowed with at least two classes of chemically distinct binding components, which are able to specifically recognize serum albumin artificially modified by glutaraldehyde treatment. Therefore, they suggest that in vivo hepatocytes may perform a specific receptor-dependent uptake of ligands expressing glutaraldehyde-polymerized albumin specificity. This phenomenon may play an important role in the proposed participation of naturally modified human serum albumin as a bridge in the attachment and penetration into host hepatocyte of hepatitis B virus, which is known to possess a receptor that is specific for glutaraldehyde-cross-linked human serum albumin.\r"

Basal hANF levels were higher in cirrhotic patients when compared with normal values. Human atrial natriuretic factor infusion induced a significant decrease in mean blood pressure (from 77.8 +/- 1.1 to 68.6 +/- 1.5 mmHg, p less than 0.001) and a significant increase in heart rate (from 76.4 +/- 2.7 to 89.8 +/- 2.4 beats/min, p less than 0.001) in the patients studied. A remarkable increase in natriuresis (i.e., greater than or equal to 200 muEq/min) was observed in 5 patients (responders), whereas the infusion did not modify sodium excretion (i.e., less than or equal to 20 muEq/min) in 6 patients (nonresponders) and induced an intermediate response in 4 patients. Human atrial natriuretic factor-induced natriuresis was related to changes in renal hemodynamics that occurred during hANF infusion. In responders, the extent of the natriuretic response paralleled the increase of effective renal plasma flow and glomerular filtration rate; in non-responders the absent natriuretic response was associated with an evident reduction of these parameters. The reduction of blood pressure was similar in responders and nonresponders, but in the latter group it was followed by a marked increase of plasma renin activity and heart rate. It is likely that in nonresponders the natriuretic effect of hANF was blunted by the hemodynamic and hormonal changes triggered by the concomitant hANF-induced hypotension. This probably occurs in the presence of a greater reduction of effective arterial blood volume, as suggested by the higher baseline levels of plasma renin activity and the inability to increase free water excretion after a water load observed in nonresponders.\r"

Before treatment with flumazenil she was encephalopathic and experienced 12 attacks of coma within 2 yr. When treated with flumazenil all signs of encephalopathy abated in spite of an unrestricted dietary intake of protein. Two days after discontinuation of flumazenil treatment she became comatose again. She remained chronically encephalopathic and had four further episodes of coma during the subsequent 3 mo. Since reinstitution of flumazenil treatment she has been well for 14 mo during follow-up without any signs of encephalopathy while on an unrestricted protein diet. Furthermore, flumazenil therapy reversed abnormalities of recordings of multimodality evoked potentials that were associated with hepatic encephalopathy. The striking remission of encephalopathy by treatment with flumazenil suggests that this benzodiazepine antagonist may be valuable in the long-term management of portal-systemic encephalopathy.\r"

  ".W": "The role of leukotrienes in the pathogenesis of chronic colitis was investigated using a rat model. Ulceration and inflammation of the distal colon was initiated by the intracolonic administration of the hapten trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid in 50% ethanol. Leukotriene B4 synthesis increased significantly within 4 h after induction of damage, with the greatest increase observed 24-72 h after administration of the hapten. The increase in leukotriene B4 synthesis correlated well (r = 0.88) with an increase in colonic myeloperoxidase activity, a biochemical marker of neutrophil infiltration. Daily intracolonic treatment with a specific 5-lipoxygenase inhibitor, L651,392, during the first 4 days after initiation of colitis, resulted in significant reductions of colonic leukotriene B4 synthesis, colonic damage score, and colon wet weight. When examined 2 wk after initiation of colitis, the group treated with L651,392 (for the first 4 days) showed significantly less colonic damage (assessed macroscopically and histologically) and colonic inflammation (assessed histologically and by measurement of myeloperoxidase activity). The healing produced by treatment with L651,392 was comparable to that observed after treatment with 5-aminosalicylic acid in a similar manner. Although a reduction of colonic damage could be produced in this model by intracolonic pretreatment with a prostaglandin E1 analogue (rioprostil), the mechanism of action of L651,392 did not appear to be through prevention of the initial injury induced by the hapten and ethanol solution. These results demonstrate that inhibition of leukotriene synthesis results in a marked acceleration of the healing of colonic ulcers and resolution of colonic inflammation in this animal model of chronic colitis. The results are therefore consistent with the hypothesis that leukotrienes play an important role in the pathogenesis of intestinal inflammation.\r"

  ".W": "This study examined the tolerance of gastric surface epithelium allowed to restitute for 90 min after damage produced by mucosal exposure to 2 M NaCl for 10 min. Cats were subjected to gastric luminal perfusion with saline at pH = 1.0 and reduction of celiac artery blood flow for 90 min. A flow reduction of 55%, as assessed by Doppler ultrasound flowmetry, was obtained by constriction of the celiac artery. These interventions alone did not produce lesions in nondamaged control cats, whereas exposure to 2 M NaCl immediately before flow reduction evoked extensive erosions as judged by gross examination and microscopy. Stomachs exposed to 2 M NaCl 90 min before flow reduction showed lesions that were clearly less in extent and number than in animals in which an intervening restitution period was not allowed. Topical dimethyl-prostaglandin E2 (50 micrograms/kg) increased the rate by which restituted surface cells were transformed to apparently normal cells. This study shows that the restituted gastric mucosa possesses a remarkably high tolerance against lowered blood flow in the presence of high luminal acidity.\r"

There is no significant difference between the new La/Ma test and the Ce/Ma test. Eighty-two patients referred to a general gastroenterology clinic with symptoms or signs of celiac disease performed a La/Ma test. A jejunal biopsy was indicated in 44 of these. In this selected group the sensitivity was 89%, specificity 54%, and negative predictive value of 95%. The La/Ma test fulfills the criteria of a screening test; it is sensitive, of low cost, and simple to perform, and it has the advantage of a simple enzyme assay and does not cause diarrhea in patients with hypolactasia. It can, therefore, be used in screening large patient populations.\r"

  ".W": "The effect of endogenous prostaglandin inhibition on bile salt-induced colonic injury and secretion was studied microscopically and by measurements of [14C]mannitol clearance and transmural potential difference in vivo. Bile salt-induced mucosal damage and permeability increased sequentially with concentration, and these degenerative changes were accelerated with the cyclooxygenase inhibitor indomethacin. Mepacrine, a phospholipase inhibitor, gave similar results, whereas nordihydroguaiaretic acid, a lipoxygenase inhibitor, was ineffective. The effect of indomethacin was abolished by prostaglandin E2 replacement; however, exogenous prostaglandin or prior bile salt exposure failed to result in additional protection. Concentrations of bile salts below the threshold for damage elicited net secretion in the presence or absence of indomethacin, and indomethacin was also without effect on the bile salt-induced secretion at damaging concentrations. Restitution of a completely denuded surface was unaffected by indomethacin, and occurred within 30 min of recovery. The present evidence suggests that endogenous prostaglandins render the mucosa more resistant to acute injury by events independent of the repair process. In addition, the bile salt-induced secretion, which can be dissociated from increased mucosal permeability and microscopic damage, is unlikely to be the result of increased mucosal synthesis of prostaglandins.\r"

Aspirin, which inhibits cyclooxygenase, is rapidly deacetylated to salicylate. Salicylate is toxic to cells and affects mucosal barrier function, reduces cytosolic adenosine triphosphate, stimulates sodium transport, and increases proton dissipation from surface epithelial cells. Cyclooxygenase inhibition makes the gastric mucosa more susceptible to injury, inhibits mucus and bicarbonate secretion, alters the physicochemical nature of mucus, stimulates fundic but not antral [3H]thymidine incorporation, and reduces epithelial surface hydrophobicity. No single mechanism seems to be involved. It is likely, instead, that the toxic effects of salicylate and the effect of cyclooxygenase inhibition work in concert to render the mucosa more susceptible to injury, resulting in mucosal damage.\r"

A double-blind trial examined the effect of misoprostol on the endoscopic appearance of gastroduodenum at the end of 1 wk of aspirin ingestion. One hundred thirty healthy subjects were randomized to take either 50, 100, or 200 micrograms of misoprostol, or placebo along with 975 mg of aspirin four times daily. Fewer subjects developed acute endoscopic gastric ulcers in the group taking any dose of misoprostol compared with the placebo group (1% vs. 43%). No subject taking the 100- or 200-micrograms dose of misoprostol developed an acute endoscopic duodenal ulcer compared with 13% of subjects taking placebo (p less than 0.05). Significantly fewer subjects developed gastric erosions and significantly fewer subjects developed duodenal erosions in each of the three groups taking misoprostol compared with the placebo group (p less than 0.01). There were fewer subjects with a gastric erosion (p less than 0.05) and fewer subjects with a duodenal erosion (p less than 0.05) in the group taking the 200-micrograms dose compared with the group taking the 50-micrograms dose of misoprostol. Gastrointestinal symptoms causing a modification in usual activities were infrequent but there was significantly more diarrhea in the 200-micrograms misoprostol group. There was no correlation between endoscopic scores and symptoms in any group. We conclude that misoprostol can protect the normal gastroduodenum from acute ulceration and reduce the chance of erosion after 1 wk of aspirin ingestion.\r"

  ".W": "Evaluation of a family in which males were clinically euthyroid despite having low serum total T4 (TT4) and free T4 index (FT4I) values revealed the presence of a new inherited T4-binding globulin (TBG) variant (TBG-San Diego). Two brothers had low TT4 (39 and 49 nmol/L; normal range, 64-154 nmol/L) and FT4I (4.0 and 4.4; normal range, 6.0-10.5) values, while their grandfather, despite treatment with T4, had a low TT4 (53 nmol/L) and normal FT4I (7.2) in the presence of suppressed TSH (less than 0.1 mU/L). When measured by RIA, the mean TBG concentration (TBG-RIA) of the three affected males was low normal [160 +/- 56 (+/- SD) nmol/L; normal range, 151-253]. Their TBG-binding capacity measured by a T4 binding assay at saturation (TBG-CAP) was similar, giving a mean TBG-RIA/TBG-CAP ratio not significantly different from 1.0. In these males, the TBG affinity for T4 (Ka = 0.48 +/- 0.04 x 10(10) mol-1) was less than that in subjects with the common type TBG (TBG-C; Ka = 1.10 +/- 0.14 x 10(10) mol-1; P less than 0.0001) and similar to that in Aboriginal males from Australia with the variant TBG-A (0.52 +/- 0.10 x 10(10) mol-1). TBG affinity for T3 in the affected males (Ka = 0.68 +/- 0.05 x 10(9) mol-1) was less than that in subjects with TBG-C (1.39 +/- 0.12 x 10(9) mol-1; P less than 0.00001), but greater than that in males with TBG-A (0.44 +/- 0.03 x 10(9) mol-1; P less than 0.0005). The rate of TBG denaturation at 56 C was increased in the affected males (t1/2 = 28.4 and 26.9 min) compared to that in subjects with TBG-C (t1/2 = 54.1 +/- 7.1 min), but was lower than that in males with TBG-A (t1/2 = 20.8 +/- 1.9). A value intermediate between those in affected males and normal subjects was found in serum from an obligatory heterozygote. Microheterogeneity on isoelectric focusing was normal. The exact nature of this structural TBG variant is not yet known. The presence of a TBG mutant should be considered in healthy, clinically euthyroid patients with low serum TT4 and free T4 index values, especially when such low values are found in several members of the same family.\r"

All patients underwent the same tests during GC replacement while receiving cortisone acetate in doses ranging from 12.5-25 mg/day. The three patients with idiopathic ACTH deficiency and no evidence of pituitary mass lesions had impaired GH secretion, which returned to normal during GC replacement. In contrast, the three patients with ACTH deficiency and hypothalamo-pituitary mass lesions detected by a computed tomography scan had impaired GH secretion during GC replacement therapy. Our data indicate that in patients with idiopathic ACTH deficiency, an impaired GH response to stimuli reversible during GC replacement therapy may be the functional consequence of the low levels of circulating cortisol. We conclude that physiological serum cortisol levels are necessary for normal serum GH responses to provocative stimuli in man.\r"

The symptom scores during the premenstrual phase were compared within each woman and between cycles with higher luteal phase and cycles with lower luteal phase plasma estradiol, progesterone, FSH, and LH concentrations. The results indicated that higher adverse premenstrual scores occurred in cycles with high luteal phase plasma estradiol and progesterone concentrations. In particular, a high luteal phase plasma estradiol concentration was related to higher premenstrual scores for adverse symptoms and lower scores for positive mood symptoms. The women experienced more severe PMS in cycles with high luteal phase plasma estradiol and progesterone levels. The results contradict the hypothesis that progesterone deficiency plays a part in the etiology of PMS.\r"

Twenty-five workers (group 1) were exposed intermittently (approximately 3.5 h daily) to extreme cold (-40 to -20 C) during the 8-h work shift, and 47 (group 2) were exposed to moderate cold (-10 to 8 C) for the entire 8 h. Ten individuals working at room temperature for the same period also were studied. After cold exposure, serum TT4 decreased in group 1 and did not change in group 2, whereas FT4 did not change in group 1 and increased in group 2. After exposure, serum TT3 and rT3 decreased significantly in both groups, while FT3 did not change in either. The basal serum TT4 levels in groups 1 and 2 were significantly lower than those in the control group, whereas those of FT4 and FT3 were higher. Thus, cold exposure had opposite effects on total thyroid hormones and their free fractions, consistent with a cold-induced decrease in thyroid hormone-binding capacity. A postexposure decrease in serum TBG was found in women in group 2, but not in men in either group 2 or group 1, suggesting that factors other than decreased TBG are also involved. The results suggest the possibilities that 1) decreased thyroid hormone-binding capacity is an adaptive response to cold exposure, and/or 2) increased free thyroid hormone levels in response to cold exposure result in a new higher equilibrium between extracellular and intracellular FT4 and FT3.\r"

To examine this question in women, plasma cholesterol, triglyceride, and apolipoprotein (apo) A-I and B levels, and low density lipoprotein (LDL) particle size were determined in 25 women runners (9 of whom had exercise-related secondary amenorrhea) and 36 age-matched nonexercising women (controls). The eumenorrheic runners had significantly lower apo B levels and significantly greater mean apo A-I/apo B ratios and LDL particle sizes than did the control women (P less than 0.05). Lower apo B levels were correlated with decreased body mass index, a known exercise effect (P less than 0.0001). In addition, normally menstruating runners had cholesterol and triglyceride levels that were 7.6% and 25.4% lower, respectively, and apo A-I levels that were 6.4% higher than control women (P = NS). In amenorrheic runners all parameters were similar to values in control women, except that apo B levels were 20% lower (P less than 0.05). Amenorrheic runners had lower plasma apo A-I levels (13%) and significantly lower apo A-I/apo B ratios and estradiol levels than eumenorrheic runners, and serum estradiol values in the runners were correlated with apo A-I levels (P less than 0.01). These data indicate that the beneficial effects of strenuous exercise on plasma apo A-I levels and apo A-I/apo B ratios in women runners can be reversed by exercise-induced amenorrhea and decreased serum estradiol levels, and that women runners have lower apo B levels than nonexercising women, regardless of menstrual status.\r"

One assay was a N-terminal assay that recognized GHRH-(1-44)-NH2, GHRH-(1-40)-OH, and GHRH-(1-37)-OH equally, and the other was a C-terminal assay that recognized only the COOH-terminal amidated sequence of GHRH-(1-44)-NH2. GHRH immunoreactivity was detectable in all samples in both assay systems, but the ratios of C- to N-terminal activity differed. The gel filtration profiles of plasma and tumor tissue revealed one peak in (or near) the position of synthetic GHRH-(1-44)-NH2. In contrast, two peaks were found in hypothalamic tissue; a major peak in the position of synthetic GHRH-(1-44)-NH2 and a higher mol wt peak. Ion exchange chromatography of the immunoreactive GHRH material from gel filtration of pooled plasma from normal subjects revealed three components of immunoreactive GHRH, one major peak in the position of GHRH-(1-40)-OH and two minor peaks in the positions of GHRH-(1-44)-NH2 and GHRH-(1-37)-OH. Two components of immunoreactive GHRH, a major peak in the position of GHRH-(1-44)-NH2 and a minor peak in the position of GHRH-(1-40)-OH, were found in hypothalamic tissue and pheochromocytomas. In the two ectopic GHRH-producing pancreatic tumors, three components of immunoreactive GHRH were detected: a major peak in the position of GHRH-(1-40)-OH, a smaller peak in the position of GHRH-(1-37)-OH, and a very small peak of GHRH-(1-44)-NH2. Synthetic GHRH-(1-44)-NH2 was not degraded by plasma during the extraction procedures. These results suggest that 1) the measured immunoreactive GHRH concentration differs when the same samples are measured by RIAs using antisera with different specificities; 2) such differences may be due to the presence of microheterogeneity of immunoreactive GHRH; 3) the microheterogeneity of immunoreactive GHRH in plasma is different from that in the hypothalamus; and 4) the posttranslational processing of GHRH in human hypothalamus is similar to that of pheochromocytomas but different from that of ectopic GHRH-producing pancreatic tumors.\r"

We studied 4 groups: A) 28 eugonadal women in the early follicular phase of the menstrual cycle, B) 11 hypogonadal women, C) 13 agonadal female to male (f-t-m) transsexuals treated for at least 3 months with 120-160 mg T undecanoate (TU)/day, orally, and D) 5 agonadal f-to-m transsexuals treated for at least 6 months with 250 mg of a mixture of testosterone esters, im (im T-esters), every 2 weeks. The eugonadal women in the early follicular phase had a mean serum E2 level of 193 +/- 94 (+/- SD) pmol/L, significantly higher (P less than 0.01) than that in the hypogonadal women (60 +/- 24 pmol/L), whereas there was no difference in the mean serum T levels (1.8 +/- 0.7 vs. 2.3 +/- 1.5 nmol/L). the higher serum E2 level in the eugonadal women was associated with a significantly lower mean serum LH level (6.9 +/- 2.6 vs. 44.6 +/- 17.6 U/L; P less than 0.01) and LH pulse amplitude (2.8 +/- 1.0 vs. 12.6 +/- 4.8 U/L; P less than 0.01), whereas the mean nadir LH interval did not differ between the two groups (75 +/- 29 vs. 81 +/- 49 min).

In spite of this elevated T level there was no difference in the mean serum LH level (38.4 +/- 14.7 vs. 44.6 +/- 17.6 U/L), LH pulse amplitude (14.3 +/- 5.7 vs. 12.6 +/- 4.8 U/L), or nadir LH interval (72 +/- 27 vs. 81 +/- 49 min) in these groups.

  ".W": "The management of hyperthyroidism due to inappropriate secretion of TSH (IST) includes agents that selectively suppress TSH hypersecretion both in patients with TSH-secreting tumor [neoplastic IST (nIST)] in whom pituitary surgery was unsuccessful and in those with selective pituitary resistance to thyroid hormone action [nonneoplastic IST (nnIST)]. Among such agents, somatostatin administration has proven to be effective in blocking TSH hypersecretion, but its short plasma half-life prevented its use in long term therapeutic trials. The recent availability of a potent and long-acting analog of somatostatin (SMS 201-995, Sandostatin) prompted us to study its effects on serum TSH, alpha-subunit, and free thyroid hormone (FT4 and FT3) concentrations in five patients with nIST and three patients with nnIST. During short term SMS 201-995 administration (100 micrograms, sc, three times daily for 5 days) both serum TSH and alpha-subunit levels decreased in all patients with nIST (mean decrements, -86% and -85%, respectively), with concomitant normalization of serum FT4 and FT3 concentrations. In the three patients with nnIST, this treatment lowered serum TSH levels less well (mean decrement, -47%), although serum FT4 and FT3 levels normalized in one patient. Chronic SMS 201-995 (100 micrograms, sc, every 12 h for 1-7 months) treatment in four hyperthyroid patients (two with nIST and two with nnIST) resulted in a steady euthyroid state in both patients with nIST, with restoration of normal visual fields in one patient. In contrast, in both patients with nnIST, escape occurred after 2 weeks of therapy. We conclude that SMS 201-995 administration is effective treatment for patients with nIST, able to suppress TSH hypersecretion from the adenomatous thyrotrophs and, consequently, to restore clinical and biochemical euthyroidism in such patients. On the contrary, the inhibitory effects of SMS 201-995 on TSH secretion in patients with nnIST are weaker and transient.\r"

  ".W": "In vitro and in vivo studies of somatotroph responsivity to GHRH stimulation indicate that partial loss of GH responsiveness occurs during constant GHRH stimulation. To determine if these observations reflect either a short term effect of GHRH or if the absence of somatostatin effects somatotroph desensitization (as occurred in in vitro studies), we administered GHRH-40 (10 ng/kg.min) by continuous iv infusion for 14 days to five normal men and one GH-deficient boy. Serum insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) concentrations were measured at frequent intervals to assess the biological effect of GHRH on GH secretion. The GH secretory profiles were assessed by measuring serum GH levels every 20 min for 24 h before (day 0), on the 14th GHRH infusion day, and 14 days after discontinuation of the GHRH infusion in the normal men. The GH-deficient boy was studied before and during the 14th GHRH infusion day. A supramaximal iv GHRH dose was administered at the end of the 24-h sampling period, and the GH responses were compared. Serum IGF-I concentrations increased on the 14th day of GHRH infusion in the normal men [day 0 mean, 0.84 +/- 0.14 (+/- SE) X 10(3); day 14, 1.74 +/- 0.20 X 10(3) U/L; P less than 0.05] and from 0.20 X 10(3) on day 0 to a maximum of 0.67 X 10(3) U/L on day 3 in the GH-deficient boy; they declined to pretreatment levels after discontinuation of GDRH. The mean integrated serum GH concentrations in the normal men were 1.44 +/- 0.10 micrograms/L.h on day 0 and 3.11 +/- 0.95 on day 14 of GHRH infusion. The integrated GH concentration in the GH-deficient boy was 1.53 micrograms/L.h on day 0 and 4.23 on day 14 of GHRH infusion. Pulsatile GH secretion, assessed by cluster analysis, was preserved in the normal men and occurred de novo in the GH-deficient boy on the 14th GHRH infusion day. The GH response to bolus GHRH administration was also preserved; no attenuation of the response occurred in the normal men or the GH-deficient boy after 14 days of GHRH infusion. The increase in IGF-I concentrations during 14 days of continuous GHRH administration, the persistence of pulsatile GH release in normal men, the de novo appearance of GH pulses in the GH-deficient boy, and the preservation of the response to a supramaximal GHRH dose indicates that the somatotrophs remain responsive to prolonged constant stimulation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

The mean basal plasma GH level was higher in the SGA than in the AGA infants but the difference was significant only for singleton newborns (p less than 0.01). The mean peak plasma GH level was markedly increased in SGA compared to AGA infants (p less than 0.05 for twins, p less than 0.01 for singletons). Twelve SGA infants re-tested at 1 month had lower basal and peak plasma GH levels (p less than 0.001 and p less than 0.01). In 21 SGA and 17 AGA infants, serum IGF-I, measured by RIA between 12 and 96 hours after birth, was significantly higher in SGA than in AGA (p less than 0.001). These results suggest that, whatever the mechanism, functional hypersomatotropism is present at day 3 in SGA infants. This hypersomatotropism may participate in the early catch-up growth process.\r"

We, therefore, used highly sensitive time-resolved immunofluorometric assays to evaluate the changes in LH and FSH during female puberty. The sensitivity of the LH assay was 0.02 IU/L, and that of the FSH assay was 0.01 IU/L. Fifty normal premenarcheal girls, 7-12 yr old, 15 postmenarcheal girls, 16 to 17 yr old, and 15 adult women, 24-29 yr old, were studied. In postmenarcheal women, the blood samples were taken on cycle days 4-7. Serum estradiol concentrations were measured by RIA, and pubertal stages were graded. Serum LH levels in prepubertal girls were very low; the mean concentration was 0.05 IU/L. All girls less than 10 yr of age had serum LH concentrations below 0.2 IU/L, while FSH levels varied from 0.3-2.0 IU/L. The earliest significant changes in serum LH, FSH, and estradiol levels took place simultaneously at 9-10 yr of age. The increase in serum FSH was gradual, but the increase in serum LH was sudden and very steep, coinciding with the increase in serum estradiol and the onset of physical puberty. The increase in the mean LH concentrations between the 7-yr-old and the adult group was 116-fold, that for estradiol was 12-fold, and that for FSH was 6.7-fold. These results suggest that the increase in serum LH is important at the onset of puberty, and LH concentrations are a sensitive indicator of pubertal development.\r"

Four of seven tumors were oncocytomas, one a null cell adenoma, and two gonadotroph adenomas based on immunocytochemical and ultrastructural features. In all seven tumors, plaques were formed with antiserum against beta FSH; four produced plaques for beta LH, and five for glycoprotein hormone alpha-subunit. The percentage of plaque-forming cells and the mean size of plaques were smaller than those of clinically functioning adenomas studied for comparison (five GH- and/or PRL-producing adenomas). These results correlated with those of hormone release in tissue culture, immunocytochemistry on paraffin secretions of the tumors, and immunocytochemistry after reverse hemolytic plaque assay. We conclude that clinically nonfunctioning pituitary adenomas release small quantities of hormones, primarily gonadotropins, and that hormone release is attributable to only a small percentage of tumor cells.\r"

  ".W": "Pituitary tumors secreting intact glycoprotein hormones (LH, FSH, and TSH) and/or alpha-subunit are being increasingly recognized. Because chronic administration of GnRH analogs decreases gonadotropin secretion in normal subjects, we investigated gonadotropin and alpha-subunit responses to chronic GnRH analog administration in five men with glycoprotein hormone-secreting pituitary tumors. Two patients (patients A and B) received the GnRH agonist analog (D-Trp6-Pro9-NEt-LHRH) for 4 weeks as a daily sc dose (8 micrograms/kg.day). In both, secretion of LH and/or alpha-subunit increased markedly. Subsequently, three patients received a higher analog dose (32 micrograms/kg.day) for a longer duration (8 weeks). One patient with a LH- and FSH-secreting tumor (patient C) had a highly significant (P less than 0.001) fall in serum LH and FSH concentrations; however, alpha-subunit secretion increased. During a subsequent study, when this patient received a lower dose (8 micrograms/kg.day) for 8 weeks, gonadotropin suppression also occurred. In two additional patients who received this dose (32 micrograms/kg.day), it had a persistent agonist effect on FSH beta (patient D) and alpha-subunit secretion (patient E). A marked increase in alpha-subunit secretion occurred in all five patients, regardless of whether basal serum alpha-subunit concentrations were elevated. These patients received the GnRH analog at doses 2-8 times greater than those that suppress gonadotropin secretion in normal men. Serum LH and FSH concentrations decreased in only one patient with a gonadotropin-secreting adenoma. The serum LH and FSH responses to acute GnRH stimulation did not predict the gonadotropin responses to chronic GnRH analog administration. Thus, gonadotropin and alpha-subunit production by most pituitary adenomas is augmented during chronic GnRH analog administration, consistent with defective GnRH desensitization in the adenomatous tissue. Despite the heterogeneous gonadotropin responses to the GnRH analog in these patients, serum alpha-subunit levels increased in all patients, indicating dissociation in the secretion of intact gonadotropins and alpha-subunit.\r"

Repeat catheterization and revascularization were required in 12% of patients before day 7 and were independent of arterial distribution. The reocclusion rate for the right coronary artery (21%) was higher than that for the left anterior descending (12%) or left circumflex (5%) artery (p = 0.01). Acute and 1 week contrast ventriculograms suitable for analysis were available in 266 patients. Whereas serial left ventricular ejection fraction did not improve during the course of this study, serial regional wall motion (centerline chord method) improved in each arterial distribution. The in-hospital mortality rate of 6% was not related to arterial distribution, although death was twice as likely with proximal compared with distal lesions. Ten of 11 patients who died in the group with the left anterior descending artery as the infarct-related artery had a lesion proximal to the first septal perforator branch.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The facilities were typically private, nonprofit, acute-care, with a capacity of 201 to 500 beds. Dietetic departments were primarily responsible for procuring, preparing, and distributing enteral nutrition formulas, Physicians, however, primarily initiated orders for formulas. Approximately 15% of hospitalized patients required enteral nutrition formulas, yet modular formulas were rarely used. More than 75% of the facilities utilized enteral nutrition formularies. Ninety-five percent of dietitians believed that establishing objective criteria for evaluating enteral nutrition formulas was important. Cost-containment through decreased product duplication, staff education, inventory management, and quantity ordering advantages were cited as motivating factors in criteria development. Osmolarity, lactose content, and product availability were identified as being the most important criteria in enteral product evaluation. The costs of enteral formulas were included in the standard room rate when the dietetics department was responsible for procuring and supplying enteral formulas. Patients were billed directly when the pharmacy department was responsible for purchasing or supplying enteral products. This study provides data from which a model may be developed to guide health care professionals in enteral formulary decision making.\r"

Mixing CD4+-cell-depleted Ts and CD8+-cell-depleted Ts preparations restored the capacity of the cells to induce Igh-1b suppression. Thus, both CD4+ CD8- Ts and CD4- CD8+ Ts are required for the induction of this allotypic suppression. Bone marrow cells and B splenocytes from Igh-1b-suppressed adult Igha/b mice were shown to be able to durably express Igh-1b when transferred into irradiated Igha/a BALB/c hosts whereas whole spleen cells from such donors failed to do it. Abrogation of Igh-1b suppression by in vivo anti-CD8 mAb treatment was achieved in adult Igha/b heterozygotes but with a lower efficiency than in adult Ighb/b homozygotes, all being chronically Igh-1b suppressed. The CD4- CD8+ cell population essential for maintaining this suppression is resistant to in vivo 600 rad irradiation and seems to be slightly inhibited by in vivo administration of free Igh-1b.\r"

  ".W": "This study documents the influence of rIL-4, IFN-gamma, and IFN-alpha on the production of IgE-BF and the expression of lymphocyte receptor for IgE or CD23 Ag (Fc epsilon R II) by human mononuclear cells. IL-4 increases the secretion of IgE-binding factor (BF) by highly purified B lymphocytes, adherent cells, and U937 monoblastic cells. The effect of IL-4 on purified B cells is augmented by costimulating the cells with F(ab')2 anti-IgM. IFN-gamma, IL-2, IL-1-alpha, or IL-1 beta and the low m.w. B cell growth factor have no effect on IgE-BF production by purified B cells even when they are used in combination with anti-IgM. Stimulation of purified T cells with IL-4 or IL-4 plus PMA leads to the production of very small amounts of IgE-BF that might well be derived from the contaminating non-T cells. IFN-gamma increases IgE-BF synthesis by unfractionated PBMC, T cell-depleted PBMC, adherent cells, and U937 cells suggesting that it induces monocytes to release IgE-BF, IFN-gamma suppresses the IL-4-induced Fc epsilon R II expression and IgE-BF production by highly purified B cells but not by PBMC or their T cell-depleted fractions. IFN-alpha inhibits IgE-BF production by IFN-gamma-stimulated PBMC and by IL-4-stimulated cells suggesting that it exerts its effect on B cells and on monocytes. Moreover IFN-alpha suppresses the IL-4-induced expression of Fc epsilon R II on B cells. Both IFN-alpha and IFN-gamma suppress the synthesis of IgE by PBMC in response to IL-4. Taken collectively the results indicate that: 1) IL-4 induces IgE-BF production by both B cells and monocytes, 2) IFN-gamma stimulates IgE-BF synthesis by monocytes but suppresses its production by IL-4-stimulated B cells, and finally 3) IFN-alpha inhibits IgE-BF synthesis in response to either IFN-gamma or IL-4.\r"

Culture of human peripheral blood monocytes in vitro induces low level surface expression of the p55 protein of the IL-2R and the expression of this receptor can be enhanced significantly by exposure to IFN-gamma. The addition of IL-2 to IFN-gamma-treated monocytes was shown to augment subsequent IL-1 beta secretion in the presence or absence of LPS. These effects could be partially blocked by anti-p55-IL-2R mAb. Nuclear \"run on\" assays and Northern analysis to probe for IL-1 beta transcripts showed enhanced IL-1 beta gene transcription and mRNA accumulation by monocytes treated with IFN-gamma and IL-2 but not in cultures that were obtained from monocytes treated with IL-2 alone. These results suggest that the T cell lymphokines IFN-gamma and IL-2 may act in a sequential fashion on monocytes to amplify the immune response by establishing a positive feedback circuit.\r"

  ".W": "The expression of IL-1R on human peripheral B cells was analyzed by the binding assay with 125I-labeled human rIL-1 alpha and by the flow cytofluorometry by the use of FITC-conjugated IL-1 alpha. The proliferation and the differentiation of B cells stimulated with Staphylococcus aureus Cowan I (SAC) in the presence of T cell-derived factors were dependent on IL-1. By the binding experiment with 125I-labeled IL-1 alpha, B cells expressed only few IL-1R without any stimulations. When they were stimulated with SAC, IL-1R on B cells began to increase by only 1 h, reached the maximum level at 6 h. The binding of 125I-labeled IL-1 alpha to B cells was inhibited by the addition of either cold IL-1 alpha or IL-1 beta suggesting that IL-1R on B cells reactive for IL-1 alpha and IL-1 beta were identical. By Scatchard plot analysis, the existence of two classes of IL-1R on B cells was found. A major class of IL-1R (320 molecules/cell) has a lower affinity (Kd = 3.8 x 10(-10) M) and a minor class of IL-1R (70 molecules/cell) has a higher affinity (Kd = 4.4 x 10(-12) M). When B cells were stimulated with SAC, both lower and higher affinity IL-1R were increased to 1960 molecules/cell and 300 molecules/cell, respectively. Furthermore, IL-1R on B cells were also detected with FITC-conjugated IL-1 alpha by a flow cytofluorometer. Only 3 to 5% of B cells expressed IL-1R without any stimulations. When B cells were stimulated with SAC, IL-1R-positive B cells were increased to 20%. The addition of anti-class II antibodies inhibited B cell proliferation and differentiation induced with SAC, IL-1, and T cell-derived factors. Anti-class II antibodies also inhibited the number of IL-1R on B cells. These results suggest that the expression of IL-1R was induced as the initial stage of B cell activation and that class II Ag play an important role for the expression of IL-1R on B cells.\r"

However, the activation of C by IgG is the only function that has been attributed to a single domain of C gamma 2, whereas most of other functions of IgG require both C gamma 2 and C gamma 3 domains. This one domain-one function relationship in the C activation by IgG, too, was questioned recently by the fact that a C gamma 3-less fragment of rabbit IgG, F(acb)2, is definitely less capable of activating C than intact IgG. Here we reexamined capacities of F(acb)2 to bind and activate C1 in the presence and absence of C1 inhibitor (C1-In) in comparison with intact IgG, by using SRBC sensitized with these proteins (EFacb, EIgG). At an ionic strength of 0.065 and 37 degrees C, where C1q was bound equally well by these cells and the dissociation was limited, C1s, presumably in the form of C1r2C1s2, dissociated from EFacb at a rate 7-fold greater than that from EIgG, irrespective of the presence or absence of C1-In. A physiologic concentration of C1-In reduced the rate of C1 activation by EFacb to 5% that by EIgG. The results present evidence that the C gamma 3 domain, too, plays a crucial part in the C1 activation process by stabilizing the zymogenic conformation of C1 and protecting it from the attack by C1 inhibitor.\r"

The human IL-4 gene, which occurs as a single copy in the haploid genome, is mapped on chromosome 5. It is composed of four exons and three introns and is approximately 10 kilobase pairs in size. 5'-Flanking regions of human and mouse IL-4 genes share about 85% homology extending more than 500 base pairs upstream of a \"TATA\" like sequence. Several patches of sequences are found in the 5'-flanking region of the human IL-4 gene which are homologous to sequence in the 5'-flanking regions of the IL-2, IL-3, IL-5, and granulocyte-macrophage (GM)-CSF genes. The IL-4 gene is inducible after treatment of human T cell clone by phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (TPA) and calcium ionophore A23187. The 2.3-kb 5'-flanking region of the human IL-4 gene transiently transfected into Jurkat human T cell leukemia cells is activated efficiently in response to TPA and A23187 stimulation and, although less efficiently, by human T cell leukemia virus type I-encoded p40x or BPV-encoded E2 protein. Combination of TPA/A23187 and p40x or E2 protein further augmented the level of expression.\r"

Jurkat cells express constitutively low level of HLA class I molecules and treatment with human IFN resulted in preferential increase of the expression of HLA-B7 molecules, the expression of the HLA-A3 molecules being relatively unchanged. Similar treatment of HHK cells, which express constitutively large amount of HLA class I molecules, resulted in a marginal increase of the expression of both HLA-B7 and HLA-A3 molecules. HLA-B7 HLA-A3 co-transfected L cells express relatively low level of HLA class I molecules, expression of both however was significantly increased after treatment with murine INF-alpha, the augmentation being more accentuated for HLA-B7 molecules. In all cases, variations of cell surface expression were related to parallel modifications of the level of HLA-B7 and HLA-A3 RNA transcripts. Important nucleotide differences exist between the IFN consensus sequences associated with the HLA-B7 and HLA-A3 class I genes. Using oligonucleotides corresponding to these sequences two patterns of retarded bands were observed by the gel mobility shift assay, suggesting that the IFN-mediated differential regulation of the expression of the HLA-B7 and HLA-A3 genes could be due to different nuclear regulatory factors.\r"

The DR beta II gene might be a pseudogene lacking the first exon that encodes the leader peptide. The DR beta I and DR beta III genes were expressed, together with the DR alpha-chain, after transfection into mouse L cells. Restriction enzyme mapping of the DR beta genomic clones and reactivity of their products expressed on the L cell transfectant against mAb showed that the DR beta I and DR beta III genes encoded the nonpolymorphic and polymorphic DR beta chain, respectively. This arrangement is the reverse of that observed in other haplotypes, such as DR3, 4 and 6. The alignment of the HLA class II genes including the DR beta genes on the chromosome 6, however, was consistent with other haplotypes, e.g., centromere-DX beta-DX alpha-DV beta-DQ beta-DQ alpha-DR beta I-DR beta II- DR beta III-DR alpha-telomere. These results suggest that the susceptibility to mutations or gene conversions responsible for genetic polymorphisms depends on the gene itself and not on its location. Furthermore, absorption experiments of anti-DR2 allosera by the DR alpha/DR beta transfectants revealed that the so-called DR2 specificities were determined by multiple epitopes although both the DR beta I and DR beta III genes behaved similarly with DR2-specific antibodies.\r"

Our conclusion is that the assembly of haplotype-mismatched A alpha:A beta complexes is limited in vivo, and that this is equally true for all cell types examined, regardless of their role in the immune response.\r"

To study the spatial distribution of B lymphocyte progenitors defined by intracellular markers (cytoplasmic mu H chain and nuclear terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT], we developed a technique to cut frozen femurs of rat, yielding cross-sections with intact subendosteal and central marrow. By using (double) immunofluorescence staining techniques we located pre-B and TdT+ cells, and IgM+ B cells in those sections. Of the B cells present in BM, one-third was accumulated in the lumen of blood sinuses. The rest were in the BM parenchyma, as were virtually all pre-B and TdT+ cells. The subendosteal area was twice as rich in pre-B and TdT+ cells as the central area, and within the subendosteal area a profound positive gradient toward the bone was evident. B cells showed an equal distribution over the center and the periphery of the BM. The distribution patterns of B lineage cells in the BM parenchyma were analyzed and shown in part to deviate from random distribution. Additional study of clonal development and microenvironmental factors in hematopoiesis will have to clarify the underlying mechanisms for the observed distribution patterns of B cell precursors in BM.\r"

The cytotoxic precursors were found to be NKH1+ and included both CD2+ and CD2- phenotypes. This cytotoxicity was not genetically restricted, as cells killed both allogeneic and autologous keratinocytes without priming. Cytotoxicity was blocked by pre-incubation of effector cells with mAb against LFA-1 alpha-(TS1/22) and beta-chains (TS1/18), but not by antibodies directed against CD4, CD8, or leukocyte common Ag (T200) suggesting that LFA-1 is an important interactive molecule in this cytotoxicity. IFN-gamma is reported to upregulate ICAM-1, the ligand for LFA-1. Pre-treatment of target keratinocytes with IFN-gamma was also found to greatly increase the sensitivity of keratinocytes to lysis. This increased sensitivity to lysis was blocked by anti-LFA-1 and anti-ICAM-1, but not by anti-DR (L243), and thus was not the result of increased DR expression. Such treated targets were lysed at low levels (15 to 18%) by an Ag-specific CD8+ cytotoxic clone as well as a T cell line derived from a skin lesion of allergic contact dermatitis. In contrast, control keratinocytes were only sensitive to IL-2-activated PBMC as described above. The above findings may be relevant to a variety of conditions in which epidermal damage is associated with lymphocytic infiltrate. These conditions include graft-vs-host disease, erythema multiforme, and lupus erythematosus. DR+ keratinocytes, which may be a marker for IFN-gamma are also found in the above conditions. It is suggested that epidermal pathology may be mediated by non-specific cytotoxicity induced in the course of an immune response.\r"

All three groups of mice produce comparable titers of specific anti-PC and anti-dextran antibodies. The inability of adult bone marrow-reconstituted BALB/c mice to produce T15 Id+ antibodies is not due to differential VH-gene expression in bone marrow or peritoneum-derived B cells. Thus, the levels of T15 VH in total serum Ig and in anti-PC antibodies are similar in all groups of mice.

In one instance DNA was isolated from cell lines generated from sequential biopsies taken from the same patient at different times of rejection. These lines show the same predominant beta-chain rearrangements. To determine whether these predominant rearrangements are due to expansion of a single clone or different T cell clones rearranging similar beta-chains, the same blots were analyzed with a J gamma probe. Cell line MH3 shows two predominant beta-chain rearrangements and at least seven of eight possible rearranged gamma-chain bands, implying that multiple clones share similar beta-chains. In contrast, the cell line King shows a single beta-chain and a single gamma-chain rearrangement. Many of the other cell lines fall between these two extremes, indicating that both beta-chain selection and clonal dominance are operating during graft rejection, resulting in the appearance of predominant beta-chain rearrangements.\r"

Corresponding effects of 15-HETE were 1.39 +/- 0.17 and 1.63 +/- 0.21, respectively. Values for 60 nanomoles of 12-HETE and 5,12-DiHETE were intermediate in comparison with the above eicosanoids. The most notable histologic changes were a neutrophilic infiltrate induced by 12-HETE at 6 and 24 h, and neutrophilic and eosinophilic infiltrates in response to 5,12-DiHETE injection at 6 and 24 h. Effects of topically applied eicosanoid pathway inhibitors were also evaluated, using intradermally injected sodium arachidonate (AA) as agonist. Three mixed cyclooxygenase/lipoxygenase inhibitors, BW755C, phenidone, and nordihydroguaiaretic acid, suppressed vascular response by 9%, 9%, and 6% for 150 nmol of AA, and by 9%, 13%, and 12% for 300 nmol of AA, respectively. The cyclooxygenase inhibitor, indomethacin, induced suppressions of 39% for 150 nmol AA and 22% for 300 nmol AA, respectively. These data demonstrate that metabolites of both cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase eicosanoid pathways are involved in alteration in vascular response accompanying cutaneous inflammation.\r"

In whole CaCl2-separated epidermis the antiserum recognized conA-binding components with apparent Mr of 115, 100, 82, 68, 50, 48, and 46 kD. The 82, 68, 48, and 46 kD immunoreactive bands were present in normal stratum corneum and plantar callus. Psoriatic scales contained significantly more of the 82 kD components and less of the 48 and 46 kD bands. Psoriatic scales also contained a major 50 kD conA-binding component unrelated to keratins or desmoglein II. Proteolytic peptide mapping showed that the major immunoreactive bands in normal stratum corneum and plantar callus were also chemically related. The 82 to 46 kD immunoreactive glycopeptides in plantar callus coincided with the major coomassie blue stained bands and were homogeneous on two-dimensional gels suggesting that this tissue may be a valuable source of human desmoglein II-derived glycopeptides. An antiserum directed against the electrophoretically co-purified 48/46 kD glycopeptides from plantar callus recognized the 82 to 46 kD bands in immunoblotting. In indirect immunofluorescence of frozen skin sections this antiserum stained the surface of epidermal cells in the spinous and granular layers of the tissue. In immunogold labeling of paraformaldehyde-fixed skin sections affinity-purified antibodies stained intact desmosomes in spinous and granular cells and desmosomal remnants in the stratum corneum. The results are consistent with our hypothesis that desmoglein II undergoes limited cleavage to stable fragments during terminal differentiation. Proteolytic degradation appears to be incomplete in psoriatic epidermis.\r"

Heterogeneity as a result of body location origin has been ruled out as fibroblasts obtained from predilection sites produce the same amount of immunoreactive collagenase as those obtained from non-predilection sites of the same subjects. Large variations in in vitro collagenase production were found between individuals and families. Within the R-EBD group, four out of eighteen patients showed an in vitro elevated level of immunoreactive collagenase compared to their healthy relatives, other EB types, and the control group. This shows that an in vitro elevated collagenase production is not a marker for the entire disease group and that the disease denoted as R-EBD probably is etiologically and pathogenetically heterogeneous.\r"

These studies have provided information on the synthesis, multimeric organization, sites of storage, and release of von Willebrand factor. We have administered endotoxin (Escherichia coli, 4 ng/kg) intravenously to 11 normal volunteers and have followed changes in levels of factor VIII, von Willebrand factor antigen, von Willebrand factor activity (ristocetin cofactor assay), and the multimeric organization of von Willebrand factor. Within 2 hours after injection, the levels of factor VIII, von Willebrand factor antigen, and von Willebrand factor activity rose significantly compared with the preinjection values (p less than 0.001, p less than 0.005, and p less than 0.001, respectively). The levels peaked 4 to 6 hours after the endotoxin injection. The mean peak values of von Willebrand factor antigen and activity were 4.67 microns/ml and 4.62 microns/ml, respectively. The factor VIII level rose to a mean of 2.87 microns/ml. Forty-eight hours after the administration of endotoxin, the von Willebrand factor antigen and activity levels remained significantly elevated (2.62 micrograms/ml and 2.20 microns/ml, respectively), but by 24 hours, the factor VIII level was not significantly elevated (1.47 microns/ml). After endotoxin administration, the agarose gel electrophoresis of von Willebrand factor demonstrated an increase in the largest von Willebrand factor multimers normally present and the appearance of von Willebrand factor multimers larger than those normally present in plasma. The largest von Willebrand factor multimers were present for 2 to 4 hours after the administration of endotoxin.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Subgroups of megakaryocytes can be recognized on the bases of morphologic stage, DNA content (ploidy), and size. However, the physiologic roles and biochemical characteristics of these subgroups have not been defined. We have investigated arachidonic acid uptake in megakaryocyte subgroups. Purified guinea pig megakaryocytes were incubated with tritiated arachidonic acid, cytocentrifuged, and subjected to autoradiography. Eight hundred megakaryocytes were analyzed in four experiments by four parameters: (1) grains per cell (arachidonic acid uptake), (2) ploidy, (3) morphologic stage, and (4) size. Lipids were extracted from aliquots of megakaryocytes subjected to autoradiography and were assessed for arachidonic acid metabolism. Arachidonic acid had not been overtly metabolized nor oxygenated, and thus, radioactivity represented arachidonic acid. The capacity for arachidonic acid uptake was dependent primarily on megakaryocyte cytoplasmic maturation as judged by morphologic stage. Stage I and II megakaryocytes, immature cells, took up three times more arachidonic acid than stage III megakaryocytes and four times more than stage IV megakaryocytes, mature megakaryocytes, when calculated as uptake per cell. When uptake was calculated per megakaryocyte area, an approximation of megakaryocyte volume, arachidonic acid uptake was six times greater in stage I and II than in stage III and IV megakaryocytes. Arachidonic acid uptake was related to ploidy to a lesser extent, because 8N megakaryocytes took up two times more arachidonic acid than 32N megakaryocytes when calculated as uptake per cell area. Arachidonic acid uptake was independent of megakaryocyte size when assessed within each morphologic stage group and ploidy class.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Therapy was well tolerated, with three patients complaining of hot flashes and two of mild pedal edema. Leuprolide acetate thus shows evidence of antitumor activity against refractory grade 1 epithelial adenocarcinoma of the ovary. Further trials with larger numbers of patients should be conducted.\r"

In a phase II trial of ifosfamide 2.0g/m2 days 1 to 4 with mesna uroprotection in 124 patients with previously failed sarcomas, four (3%) responded completely (95% exact confidence interval, 1% to 8%) and 26 (21%) had a complete or partial response (95% exact confidence interval, 14% to 29%). The median time to progression was 5 and 9 months for partial and complete responders, respectively. In the subset of soft tissue sarcomas, the response rate for the patients receiving bolus administration was 26%, compared with 9% for the patients receiving a continuous infusion schedule (P = .03). The response rates among patients with soft tissue and bony sarcomas with a performance score of 0-2 and 0-1 prior to chemotherapy administration were 20% and 40%, respectively. Somnolence or confusion developed in 19%. Neurotoxicity was significantly associated with poor performance status (P less than .01), elevated creatinine (P less than .01), and low bicarbonate levels (P = .05). A serum bicarbonate less than 20 developed in 31% of the patients and was significantly associated with older age (P = .01), elevated creatinine (P = .02), and female sex (P = .06). Hematuria was significantly associated with no uroprotection (the first four patients did not receive mesna because it was unavailable), but was not associated with prior cyclophosphamide, pelvic radiotherapy, age, or bolus v continuation infusion schedule. Thus, ifosfamide is active in failed sarcomas and warrants further study in previously untreated patients with sarcoma.\r"

  ".W": "An important subset of malignancies arising in the ovary or digestive organs remains confined to the peritoneal cavity throughout its natural course. These tumors constitute appropriate targets for loco-regional therapy. With this rationale a clinical phase I and pharmacokinetic study of intraperitoneally administered N, N', N'' triethylenethiophosphoramide (thiotepa), an alkylating agent with activity against ovarian carcinoma, was initiated with the objectives of determining the systemic and local toxicities, maximum-tolerated dose, and pharmacokinetic advantage associated with using the drug in this manner. A total of 13 patients received 15 courses of intraperitoneal thiotepa at doses ranging from 30 mg/m2 to 60 mg/m2. The only important systemic toxicity observed was myelosuppression. At 50 mg/m2 two patients developed Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) grade III myelosuppression. At 60 mg/m2, the maximum-tolerated dose, the mean nadir WBC and platelet counts were 2.7 X 10(3)/microliter and 110 X 10(3)/microliter, respectively. There were no instances of vomiting, stomatitis, or alopecia. Pharmacokinetic studies performed in nine patients revealed that thiotepa was rapidly lost from the peritoneal cavity in a biexponential fashion with a mean t1/2 alpha of 0.26 +/- 0.08 hour and a mean t1/2 beta of 2.13 +/- 0.52 hour. Concomitant with the rapid loss of drug from the peritoneal cavity was the rapid rise in drug levels in the plasma, with peak plasma values approaching those associated with intravenous administration. Peritoneal exposure to thiotepa expressed as the area under the curve (AUC)peritoneal fluid was 7 to 34 micrograms/mL X hour. Systemic exposure expressed as the AUCplasma ranged between 0.95 and 7.71 micrograms/mL X hour. The observed pharmacokinetic advantage of intraperitoneal administration calculated as AUCperitoneal fluid/AUCplasma was 4.3 +/- 0.6. This relatively small advantage, combined with our observation of rapid appearance of the active metabolite, tepa, into the plasma argue against an important role for intraperitoneal administration of thiotepa.\r"

Sodium dodecyl sulfate-gel electrophoresis and immunoblot methods with anti-NF200 antibody were used for the study. Selective degradation of NF200 and NF150 was observed during the initial 10 to 15 minutes of ischemia. The degradation was demonstrated both in permanent ischemia caused by decapitation and in transient ischemia induced by four-vessel occlusion followed by reperfusion after 30 minutes of occlusion (modified Pulsinelli method). The degradation suggests that the activation of a protease occurs in the first 15 minutes of cerebral ischemia, which is the earliest irreversible neuronal change ever to be reported.\r"

Serum levels and retention of calcium and phosphorus were measured as calcium intake was increased from 36 to 76 mg/kg/day in 10 mg increments and as phosphorus intake was adjusted to maintain the 1.7:1 ratio. Five different infants were studied at each of the five levels. The amounts of calcium and phosphorus retained increased steadily and at level 5 were 71.8 +/- 1.2 mg/kg/day and 40.9 +/- 1.7 mg/kg/day, respectively. Over the five levels the average percent calcium retention was 91.4 +/- 4.2 and the average percent phosphorus retention was 89.1 +/- 7.7. The provision of parenteral calcium and phosphorus in a 1.7:1 ratio resulted in a balanced retention of both minerals over the range studied. The use of this calcium/phosphorus ratio appears to be appropriate for the preterm infant receiving total parenteral nutrition.\r"

In the past, there has been research on the local and systemic administration of thrombolytic agents for lysis of experimentally induced thrombi in various animal models. A new venous inversion graft thrombosis model is presented here, which possesses many advantages over previously employed research models. This study demonstrates thrombolysis with systemically administered tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) in this model.\r"

This implies that the MSS116 protein (pMSS116) is an important component of the mitochondrial splicing machinery. The sequence of the cloned MSS116 gene shows that its protein product is homologous to the translation eIF-4A factor and the human nuclear protein p68. We show further that these proteins share several conserved amino-acid blocks with DNA helicases and related proteins. This suggests that pMSS116 has an RNA helicase activity. RNA helicases may be involved in many different processes including translation and splicing.\r"

MRI revealed multiple areas of low-signal intensity in the globus pallidus and posterior putamen. A 6-fluorodopa PET study revealed bilateral decreased uptake in the basal ganglia. This evidence of functional impairment of dopaminergic nigrostriatal neurons is related either to direct toxicity of cyanide or to the effects of cerebral hypoxia secondary to cyanide intoxication.\r"

  ".U": "89086288\r", 
  ".W": "Plasma levels of both atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) and vasoconstrictor neurohormones are often increased in patients with congestive heart failure (CHF). It has been speculated that ANF is a counterregulatory hormone that influences regional blood flow and sodium balance in human patients by either direct vasorelaxation or by inhibiting the release of other vasoconstrictor neurohormones. The exact relation of increased ANF levels to regional vascular resistance and vasoconstrictor neurohormones has not previously been documented. Thus, we examined the relation between plasma ANF levels, levels of vasoconstrictor neurohormones, and forearm, splanchnic and renal blood flow in 20 normal subjects and in 17 patients with chronic CHF. The plasma ANF level was directly correlated with the plasma norepinephrine concentration (r = 0.83, p less than 0.01), plasma epinephrine concentration (r = 0.46, p less than 0.01), plasma renin activity (r = 0.50, p less than 0.01), plasma angiotensin II concentration (r = 0.79, p less than 0.01) and plasma vasopressin concentrations (r = 0.65, p less than 0.01). Positive correlations existed between plasma ANF levels and the calculated vascular resistances, i.e., between ANF and forearm vascular resistance (r = 0.41, p less than 0.05), splanchnic vascular resistance (r = 0.74, p less than 0.01) and renal vascular resistance (r = 0.66, p less than 0.05).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The effect of an acute and sustained reduction in atrial pressure on atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) and vasoactive hormone secretion was studied in 9 patients with congestive heart failure (CHF). Intravenous nitroglycerin was titrated to reduce the pulmonary artery wedge pressure by 30 to 50% and maintain this reduction for 4 hours. After 60 minutes of nitroglycerin administration, the mean decrement in wedge pressure was 10.0 +/- 1.7 (standard error) mm Hg (35%) and plasma ANF was 65.3 +/- 13.9 pmol/liter (35%). The initial decrease, sustained reduction and later increase in plasma ANF levels closely paralleled the changes in pulmonary arterial wedge (r = 0.94, p less than 0.0001) and right atrial pressures (r = 0.91, p less than 0.0001) during and immediately after the nitroglycerin infusion. Plasma aldosterone and cortisol levels increased during the first 2 hours of the nitroglycerin infusion, but there was little change in plasma norepinephrine or plasma renin activity. Although levels were elevated in CHF, plasma ANF still responded rapidly to changes in atrial pressure. A sustained reduction in pressure produced a sustained reduction in ANF levels. These findings provide further support for a regulatory role of ANF, even in chronic CHF.\r"

Von Willebrand factor interacts with at least two platelet membrane receptors, but the effect of ABO group on platelet function is an unstudied area. The authors examined platelet function in 40 plateletpheresis donors using an impedance lumi-aggregometer. Aggregation responses to collagen, adenosine diphosphate (ADP), and ristocetin were measured and the adenosine triphosphate (ATP) release to thrombin. Twenty donors were Group O and 20 were Group A. Measurements of von Willebrand factor antigen (vWf:Ag), Factor VIII: C, and ristocetin co-factor (RiCoF) in the same group showed reduced levels of vWf:Ag and Factor VIII:C in Group O, as previously reported. The aggregation response to collagen and ADP and the release of ATP did not differ. The aggregation response to ristocetin, however, was better in Group O than in Group A despite the lower vWf:Ag levels. The explanation for this is unclear, but the data suggest an influence of blood group antigens on the interaction between von Willebrand's factor and platelets.\r"

Infants in the two groups were of comparable gestational age, size, and illness at birth. During hospitalization, the 1986 infants began parenteral and enteral nutrition earlier, had fewer days when they received less than 252 kJ/kg, were treated earlier for patent ductus arteriosus (6.1 +/- 4.5 days vs 14.5 +/- 7.7 days), and had a lower prevalence of severe medical complications. By hospital discharge, these infants had significantly higher mean growth percentiles and fewer of them had weights and occipitofrontal circumferences below the fifth percentile. Follow-up at 4 and 12 months corrected age showed that these infants continued to have significantly higher growth percentiles, and fewer of them had weights below the fifth percentile (49% vs 24%) or major neurologic abnormalities. Infants whose weights were below the fifth percentile had significantly poorer 12-month developmental outcomes. We speculate that more aggressive early neonatal nutritional management, changes in cardiopulmonary management, and lower incidences of chronic disease promote earlier onset of and more rapid rates of postnatal growth, which extend through the first year of follow-up.\r"

Intraoperative video panendoscopy, employing a segmental advance and look technique, allowed visualization and transillumination of the entire gut and identified mucosal disease in 13 patients (93 percent). Angiodysplasia of the colon and small intestine was the most common pathologic finding. Intraoperative video panendoscopy significantly influenced the operation performed in 13 patients (93 percent). Postoperative complications were minimal, with none being directly attributable to intraoperative video panendoscopy. Bleeding was totally controlled in 10 patients (71 percent) during a mean follow-up period of 25 months. Intraoperative video panendoscopy is a valuable technique for assisting in the management of the patient with recurrent gastrointestinal bleeding.\r"

Fifty percent of patients who did not undergo operation initially as a result of a successful course of bowel rest and TPN had surgery within 15.4 +/- 13.9 months, whereas 75 percent of patients operated on immediately after a course of TPN did not need additional surgery during a follow-up of 36.1 +/- 31.2 months. Thus, a total of 80 percent of patients underwent gastrointestinal surgery sometime during the study and follow-up periods. TPN has an important role in replenishment of nutritional deficits and perioperative nutritional support; however, from the results of the present study, it is difficult to advocate it as the sole primary therapy for Crohn's disease.\r"

Bilirubin uridine diphosphoglucuronyl transferase (UDPGT) activity has been demonstrated in normal rat intestinal mucosa. We hypothesized that normal rat enterocyte transplantation may restore the ability of Gunn rats, which lack bilirubin UDPGT, to conjugate bilirubin. Small intestine was resected from normal Wistar rat donors. Enterocytes were harvested and suspended in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10 percent fetal calf serum. Isolated enterocytes were attached to collagen-coated dextran microcarriers and transplanted into congeneic Gunn rat recipients. Recipient rats underwent bile duct cannulation after transplantation, and bile was analyzed for bilirubin glucuronides by high-pressure liquid chromatography. Fifty percent of the transplanted rats showed a significant increase in the concentration of bilirubin monoglucuronide and diglucuronide in their bile 4 and 7 days posttransplantation. Recipient rats had well vascularized microcarrier-enterocyte aggregates in the peritoneal cavity. Our method for intraperitoneal transplantation of isolated enterocytes in rats could potentially be used to correct specific enzymatic and metabolic defects.\r"

Halothane (1.1% and 2.2% inspired) or fentanyl (50 and 200 micrograms/kg) anesthesia alone produced little change in basal plasma ANP levels but did increase plasma AII levels above unanesthetized baseline concentrations. A 30% blood volume load in conscious rats produced a transient increase in blood pressure and central venous pressure, a threefold rise in plasma ANP, and a decrease in AII. These effects were not significantly altered by fentanyl anesthesia. In contrast, during 2.2% halothane anesthesia the increase in plasma ANP produced by volume loading was greater and the decrease in AII was abolished. These results indicate that fentanyl does not increase basal ANP levels or markedly change the hormonal response to a volume load. Altered responses seen during deep halothane anesthesia may result from cardiovascular changes or a direct stimulation of physiological mechanisms that release ANP.\r"

The patient data have been compared with data obtained from 32 normal volunteers, and in addition the metabolic response of the trauma patient to total nutritional support (TPN) has been assessed. The rate of VO2 was elevated in the trauma patients compared with that of the volunteers (160 mumol/kg/minute vs. 103 mumol/kg/minute). Glucose production was significantly increased in the patients compared with the volunteers (21 +/- 2 mumol/kg/minute vs. 14 +/- 1 mumol/kg/minute), but the trauma patients had an impaired capacity to directly oxidize plasma glucose. The percentage of glucose uptake oxidized in the volunteers was 36 +/- 2%, and the percentage of glucose uptake recycled was 10 +/- 1%. By contrast, in the trauma patients, 23 +/- 4% of the glucose uptake was directly oxidized, and 29 +/- 11% was recycled. The rate of glycerol turnover in the trauma patients (5.3 +/- 0.3 mumol/kg/minute) was significantly elevated compared with the volunteer value (2.2 +/- 0.1 mumol/kg/minute), and the basal rate of fat oxidation was twice as high in the patients as in the volunteers (2 mg/kg/minute vs. 1 mg/kg/minute). The rate of whole body protein catabolism was significantly higher in the patients (5.8 +/- 0.7 g/kg/day vs. 4.3 +/- 0.3 g/kg/day), and as a result, the rate of net protein catabolism was significantly elevated in the patients. The response to TPN (amino acids and a 50:50 mixture of glucose and fat) included an increase in the percentage of glucose uptake oxidized (up to 45 +/- 12%), a decrease in the oxidation of fat (up to 0.8 mg/kg/minute), and a significant increase in whole body protein synthesis (up to 6.1 +/- 1.1 g/kg/day) so that the rate of net protein loss was minimized but not prevented. (The rate of net protein catabolism during TPN was 1.3 +/- 0.5 g/kg/day.) There was no correlation between the injury severity score (ISS) and the degree of metabolic abnormality. The rate of NPC in the patients with ISS less than 20 was higher than in the volunteers (ISS = 0), but the values for NPC in patients with ISS 21-40, and ISS greater than 40 were virtually identical to the corresponding values in patients with ISS less than 20. It is concluded from these studies that: 1) Trauma patients have a high rate of VO2.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "A six- to eight-week double-blind placebo-controlled trial of the potent and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor fluvoxamine was conducted in 42 patients with primary obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Approximately one half of the patients also had symptoms of major depression. Fluvoxamine was significantly better than placebo on all measures of obsessive-compulsive symptoms. Nine of 21 patients were responders (\"much improved\") with fluvoxamine compared with no responders with placebo, and fluvoxamine was effective in patients with OCD both with and without secondary depression. Response of OCD was not correlated with severity of baseline depression. These data lend partial support to the serotonin hypothesis of OCD. However, since a number of patients failed to respond to fluvoxamine, the role of other neurochemical systems in this disorder needs to be explored.\r"

(-)-Deprenyl (the official nonproprietary name for this substance is selegiline), a selective MAO type B inhibitor, may be safer and have fewer side effects, but its antidepressant efficacy is uncertain. A double-blind placebo-controlled study was carried out in depressed outpatients who were treated with (-)-deprenyl in an MAO type B selective dose range and at a higher nonselective dose range. (-)-Deprenyl did not have a statistically significant antidepressant effect after three weeks of treatment at doses of 10 mg/d. However, after six weeks and at higher doses (averaging about 30 mg/d for the second three weeks), (-)-deprenyl was superior to placebo in antidepressant effect with a positive response rate of 50% vs 13.6% and with a 41% reduction in the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale mean score vs 10% in the placebo-treated group. No hypertensive crises were seen. The rate of occurrence of side effects with (-)-deprenyl was no greater than with placebo. It was concluded that (-)-deprenyl is an effective antidepressant in a dose range where it is distinguished by the absence of many of the side effects typical of nonselective MAO inhibitors.\r"

  ".W": "Clear cell sarcoma (CCS) is an uncommon, clinicopathologically distinct neoplasm that typically arises in association with tendons and aponeuroses. It shares several histologic and ultrastructural features with malignant melanoma. Clear cell sarcoma occasionally may be confused with other tumors of soft tissue that have a predominantly epithelioid appearance, including epithelioid leiomyosarcoma, epithelioid neurofibrosarcoma, synovial sarcoma, and epithelioid sarcoma. To assess the potential contribution of immunohistochemistry to this differential diagnosis, a panel of immunostains was applied to examples of each of these neoplasms. All six CCSs contained vimentin, and five were reactive with the melanoma-specific monoclonal antibody HMB-45. In addition, five CCSs expressed neuron-specific enolase, four cases displayed S100 protein, and four examples contained LN3 antigen. Synaptophysin and Leu-7 antigen were present in one case each. Cytokeratin, epithelial membrane antigen, carcinoembryonic antigen, desmin, muscle-specific actin, and leukocyte common antigen were invariably absent. No other primary epithelioid neoplasm of soft tissue reacted with HMB-45. Clear cell sarcoma could be separated from epithelioid leiomyosarcoma by the presence of desmin and muscle-specific actin in the latter neoplasm. Similarly, both synovial sarcoma and epithelioid sarcoma differed from CCS by their expression of cytokeratin and epithelial membrane antigen. Clear cell sarcoma and malignant melanoma were immunohistochemically indistinguishable, supporting the concept that they share a common pattern of differentiation.\r"

After 90 days, rats were anesthetized and breast tumors were devascularized in vivo. At 0, 30, 60, 90 and 150 minutes, a biopsy specimen from each tumor was taken and rapidly frozen. Steroid binding capacity for estrogen (ER), progesterone (PR), and androgen (AR) receptors was determined by incubation with tracer receptor ligand. Ischemia decreased ER and AR levels by 30 minutes, whereas PR levels were unchanged through 150 minutes of ischemia. Following mastectomy, tylectomy, or breast biopsy, PR may be the most reliable of the hormone receptors for determining endocrine-responsive breast cancer. However, for accurate determination of all hormone receptors, specimens should be frozen in liquid nitrogen immediately, then preserved at -70 degrees C, or processed immediately.\r"

The absence of seizures is not related to the continued ingestion of anticonvulsant medication. Approximately 25% of the men have had varying degrees of mental deterioration.

  ".W": "Measurement of the soluble form of CD8 antigen, a surface membrane component of suppressor/cytotoxic T cells, has yielded useful information relevant to prognosis in the lymphoid malignancies of childhood. We therefore determined pretreatment levels of serum CD8 antigen in 90 children with newly diagnosed Hodgkin's disease. The findings ranged widely, from 220 to 2,585 U/mL (median, 556 U/mL). In patients with advanced disease (stage III or IV), the median serum CD8 level was significantly higher than in those with less disease extension (stage I or II): 675 v 477 U/mL, P = .003. It was also higher in children with B symptoms compared with all others: 622 v 494 U/mL, P = .005. Cases with a histologic classification of mixed cellularity had a significantly higher median level of the antigen than did those classified as nodular sclerosis: 847 v 509 U/mL, P = .005. Finally, higher serum CD8 levels (greater than 430 U/mL) were significantly associated with an increased probability of treatment failure (P = .02). In a multivariate analysis, serum CD8 level retained its impact on treatment outcome after adjustment for other potentially useful prognostic factors, including disease stage, presence of B symptoms, histology, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, sex, age, and race. The prognostic strength shown by soluble CD8 in this analysis suggests that the antigen has clinical value. We postulate that increased CD8 levels in serum indicate enhanced suppressor T-cell activity, which may compromise the host's antitumor immunity, leading to unusually aggressive disease.\r"

Treatment of this enzyme with glycopeptidase F partially deglycosylates it and establishes the presence of N-linked sugar moieties. Antibodies raised in a rabbit against the purified enzyme from plasma were found to be specific, noninhibitory, and capable of precipitating the enzymatic activity. The antibodies precipitated greater than 90% of the GSHPx activity of normal plasma, thus indicating that the selenoenzyme is the main if not the sole GSHPx activity of plasma. The antibodies did not precipitate RBC GSHPx. A slight cross-reactivity of the antibodies was found with rat plasma GSHPx. A GSHPx activity precipitation assay of normal plasma in the presence of selenium (Se)-deficient plasma indicates that no cross-reactive protein in the Se-deficient plasma interferes with the precipitation of the GSHPx activity from normal plasma. Thus, GSHPx protein as well as activity is deficient in plasma in the absence of Se. Antibodies against GSHPx either from RBCs or from plasma were used to specifically immunoprecipitate most of the GSHPx activity from RBCs or plasma, respectively, in healthy individuals to determine the amount of Se associated with the protein. GSHPx accounts for approximately 15% of the Se in RBCs and 12% of the Se in plasma. Thus, in normal individuals, these proteins account for only a fraction of plasma and RBC Se.\r"

Conversely, genetic deficiencies of catalase do not predispose affected erythrocytes to peroxide-induced destruction. These observations have served to strengthen the assumption that the NADPH/glutathione/glutathione peroxidase pathway is the principal means for disposal of H2O2 in human erythrocytes. Recently, however, mammalian catalase was found to have tightly bound NADPH and to require NADPH for the prevention and reversal of inactivation by its toxic substrate (H2O2). Since both catalase and the glutathione pathway are dependent on NADPH for function, this finding raises the possibility that both mechanisms destroy H2O2 in human erythrocytes. A comparison of normal and acatalasemic erythrocytes in the present study indicated that catalase accounts for more than half of the destruction of H2O2 when H2O2 is generated at a rate comparable to that which leads to hemolysis in G6PD- deficient erythrocytes.\r"

The purpose of this study was to determine which fibrinolytic factor(s) was responsible for this diurnal rhythm. Resting and postvenous occlusion tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA) activity, resting t-PA antigen, and resting plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1) activity were measured in the morning and evening in 33 healthy men (mean age, 31 years) and in 15 patients (mean age, 57 years) with previous myocardial infarction or unstable angina. PAI-1 activity and t-PA antigen were significantly higher (p less than 0.01) in the morning compared with the evening in controls and patients. In contrast, resting t-PA activity was significantly lower in the morning (p less than 0.01) in both groups and was inversely correlated with PAI-1 activity (r = -0.57, p less than 0.0001). Postvenous occlusion t-PA activity and t-PA capacity were not significantly different between morning and evening in either group. Because t-PA antigen levels and PAI-1 activity were highest in the morning, the variation in t-PA activity was probably not due to decreased secretion of t-PA but instead to changes in the secretion of PAI-1. Our findings indicate that diurnal variations in PAI-1 activity may reduce fibrinolytic activity in the morning in healthy individuals and in patients with coronary artery disease.\r"

  ".W": "Tissue plasminogen activator is a thrombolytic agent that has been shown to be efficient in patients with myocardial infarction or pulmonary embolus. However, little is known about the time course and the dose dependency of its thrombolytic effect. The goal of our study was to investigate the time course of the thrombolysis induced by increasing doses of tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) given either as a continuous infusion (0.0625-1 mg/kg) or as a bolus (0.05-0.4 mg/kg). For this purpose, we modified a previously described rabbit jugular vein thrombosis model by using an external gamma counter to follow continuously the thrombolysis. After administration of t-PA as either an infusion or a bolus, the rate and the extent of thrombolysis were dose dependent. The thrombus size decreased regularly following an exponential curve and reached a lower asymptote implicating an unlysable thrombus. As expected, after bolus injection, t-PA was rapidly inhibited resulting in a duration of action of approximately 15 minutes; this was independent of the dose. Surprisingly, during continuous infusion of t-PA for as long as 4 hours, the duration of action was limited to about 2 hours, although the plasma t-PA activity levels remained stable. Although the rate of inhibition was lower and thus the duration of action was longer during continuous infusion of t-PA than after a bolus injection, the extent of thrombolysis was similar when the same dose of t-PA was given as either a bolus or an infusion. These findings could be attributed to the higher initial rate of thrombolysis observed after a bolus injection.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "To clarify the direct contribution of the left atrial pressure to secretion of human atrial natriuretic peptide (hANP), we have attempted to study the relations between plasma hANP levels, neurohumoral factors, and hemodynamic changes in 13 patients with mitral stenosis undergoing percutaneous transvenous mitral commissurotomy (PTMC). After PTMC, the left atrial pressure fell from 14.7 +/- 1.9 (mean +/- SEM) to 6.5 +/- 0.7 mm Hg in all patients studied (p less than 0.0005), whereas there were no remarkable changes in either the right atrial pressure, mean arterial pressure, or heart rate. Plasma immunoreactive hANP levels obtained from the pulmonary artery decreased from 278 +/- 51 to 137 +/- 31 pg/ml after PTMC (p less than 0.0005). There was a significant correlation between the decrement of hANP levels and that of left atrial pressure (r = 0.72, p less than 0.005). Neither plasma renin activity nor norepinephrine levels changed. In contrast, plasma aldosterone concentrations significantly increased from 11.3 +/- 1.5 to 16.4 +/- 2.7 pg/ml after PTMC (p less than 0.01), although there was no casual relation between plasma concentrations of aldosterone and hANP. The present result with PTMC-induced rapid fall of the left atrial pressure with a concomitant reduction in hANP secretion strongly suggests the importance of the left atrial pressure on hANP secretion in humans.\r"

  ".W": "In a placebo-controlled, single-blind study we evaluated the ability of three large doses of naloxone (1.0, 5.0, and 10 mg) to antagonize the established respiratory-depressant effects of a common analgesic dose of intravenous buprenorphine (0.3 mg/70 kg). This dose of buprenorphine consistently reduced indexes of CO2 responsiveness to about one half of their control values, much like comparable doses of other opioid analgesics. One milligram of naloxone had little effect on this respiratory depression. Both 5 and 10 mg produced consistent reversal, which was more complete with the larger dose. The reversal effect of naloxone did not occur immediately as is characteristic with morphine and other opioids but rather appeared to reach a maximum 3 hours after reversal. These findings indicate that high doses of naloxone are required to antagonize buprenorphine and naloxone's limited efficacy results not from its short duration of action but rather its relative inability to displace buprenorphine already bound to opioid receptors.\r"

  ".W": "In order to evaluate whether combined esophageal and gastric pH-metry is feasible without interference due to the transcardial cable, four 24-hr ambulatory esophageal pH-metries were carried out in seven healthy volunteers in a randomized order. In two studies only one glass electrode was used. It was placed 5 cm above the lower esophageal sphincter. In the two other studies an additional electrode was placed in the corpus region 10 cm below the lower esophageal sphincter. In order to obtain a wide range of pH values, misoprostol (400 micrograms) was given at 9 AM and 9:15 PM in two studies. In the two other studies placebo was given. Misoprostol exerted only a weak and short-lasting effect on gastric acidity. The four measuring conditions did not differ with respect to medians of esophageal reflux time and duration of single reflux episodes, Kendall's coefficient of concordance yielded a high reproducibility for both variables (P less than 0.0025). Thus, combined esophageal and gastric pH-metry is feasible and highly reproducible.\r"
