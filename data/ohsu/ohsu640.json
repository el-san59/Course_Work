Some reviewers thought it expressed unrelieved anger; others felt it described the experience, perceptions, and feelings of many women with breast cancer. The paper seemed important to publish, however, because breast cancer is the second most common tumor occurring in American women. It is important to note that the author is a successful teacher and health professional who has a full and active family and social life. She describes encounters with breast cancer in an uncommonly fervent and articulate way. These encounters have clearly left deep scars. The essay is not scientific and not balanced in this issue by a paper by a women who had a wonderful experience with breast cancer. Such a paper may never be written. Read on!\r"

  ".U": "89042201\r", 
  ".W": "Activation of prohistidine decarboxylase (pi 6) from Lactobacillus 30a proceeds by an intramolecular, pH- and monovalent cation-dependent reaction in which its constituent pi chains are cleaved nonhydrolytically between Ser-81 and Ser-82 with loss of NH3 and conversion of Ser-82 to the pyruvoyl residue of active histidine decarboxylase (alpha beta)6. Amines with pKa values more than 7.0 substitute for K+ or NH4+ in the activation of prohistidine decarboxylase, but they also catalyze its inactivation in a competing reaction, pi 6----pi'6. Sequence analysis of the appropriate tryptic peptide from amine-inactivated prohistidine decarboxylase established that inactivation results from conversion of Ser-82 of the pi chain to an aminoacrylate residue. The inactivated proenzyme (pi'6) does not form histidine decarboxylase; this fact eliminates one of two postulated mechanisms of activation and, thus, favors activation by beta-elimination of the acyl group of an intermediate ester formed between Ser-81 and Ser-82. L-Histidine is bound by the proenzyme (Kd = 1.7 x 10(-4) M) and is an effective activator; one binding site is present per pi subunit. K+, NH4+, and Na+ competitively inhibit (Ki values = 2.8-4.4 x 10(-3) M) activation by histidine. The data suggest the presence of two classes of monovalent cation binding sites on prohistidine decarboxylase: one (near Ser-82) is readily saturable and one is unsaturable even by 2.4 M K+.\r"

The results showed that thymus, spleen and circulating lymphocytes were significantly involved. A diminished mitogen responsiveness of spleen cells and altered peritoneal macrophage function were confirmed. Ear swelling tests indicated that the cellular immunity of burned mice was most severely depressed in week 2 postburn. The present study also showed that the dramatic change in nutritional status occurred earlier than that in cellular immunity and suggested the importance of early nutritional support after thermal injury.\r"

  ".W": "Thirteen goats with chronic lung lymph fistula suffering from smoke inhalation injury were studied for a 6-h period. All animals were found to have acute respiratory failure after injury, the arterial TXA2 (thromboxane A2) levels had increased by 5 min after injury, they peaked at 2 h, and then subsequently declined. Peripheral platelet counts decreased progressively within 2 h, then gradually recovered but were still lower than baseline values at 6 h after injury. EVLW (extravascular lung water), Q1 (lung lymph flow rate) and L/P (total lymph protein/plasma protein concentration), all increased and peaked at 2 h after injury. A negative linear correlation was observed between the TXA2 levels and the platelet counts. Furthermore, differences between the venous and arterial platelet counts were markedly increased. All these observations suggested that the increased TXA2 triggered the formation of platelet microaggregates which were then trapped in the microvasculatures of viscera such as the lung. This might be one of the causes of the decreased platelet counts in peripheral blood. Both TXA2 levels and platelet counts were closely correlated with EVLW, suggesting that TXA2 may indirectly cause the increased pulmonary microvascular permeability by promoting platelet aggregation and microaggregate formation in the pulmonary microvasculature. This may be one of the reasons for the developing pulmonary oedema in goats following smoke inhalation injury.\r"

Eight of these cases were in situations in which the question of inflicted injury was raised and 18 were in situations of neglect and/or improper supervision. Seven (27 per cent) died from their injury. All of these adults were either very old, mentally impaired, and/or physically handicapped. Twenty-three were burned in health care facilities or institutions. Adult abuse in the elderly, handicapped and disabled population is similar to that found in child abuse and includes characteristic burn patterns, a story that does not fit the injury, and a delay in seeking medical care. An increased awareness of the problem is necessary for improved diagnosis and management of these patients.\r"

  ".W": "Nisoldipine reportedly has little direct myocardial effect. However, because of interactions between the heart and vascular load, the effects on myocardial contractility and left ventricular oxygen consumption (LVO2) have not been established. The authors performed experiments on six isolated, blood-perfused canine left ventricles that were isovolumically contracting and paced at constant rate. Coronary arterial pressure (CAP) and coronary blood flow were measured for evaluation of coronary vascular resistance, and coronary arteriovenous oxygen difference was measured for determination of LVO2. Intracoronary injection of 1 and 10 micrograms of nisoldipine decreased coronary vascular resistance by 16.9 and 36.8% (CAP approximately 40 mm Hg), respectively, and by 21.5 and 47.7% (CAP approximately 80 mm Hg). At both doses, nisoldipine caused no decrease in peak systolic pressure as long as CAP was kept constant at 80 mm Hg. However, when CAP was decreased to 40 mm Hg, peak systolic pressure was significantly decreased even without nisoldipine. This impaired contractile state was associated with a decreased coronary blood flow and a slight decrease in LVO2, whereas 10 micrograms of nisoldipine at CAP approximately 80 mm Hg increased LVO2 significantly. Using the end-systolic pressure-volume relationship as an index of contractility, the authors found nisoldipine not to change the contractile state at CAP approximately 80 mm Hg. They conclude that nisoldipine decreases coronary vascular resistance over a wide range of CAP. It neither depresses the contractile state nor decreases LVO2 in the canine left ventricle. Nisoldipine might effectively counteract anginal attacks by dilating the coronary vessels without depressing myocardial contractility as found in this study on normal ventricle.\r"

  ".W": "In conditions similar to those occurring in the stomach, the sympathomimetic drug dimethophrine was found to react with nitrite yielding 2,6-dimethoxy-1,4-benzoquinone (DMBQ). The in vitro and in vivo studies carried out to evaluate the capability of DMBQ to produce cytotoxic and genotoxic effects provided the following results. A dose-related reduction of V79 cells plating efficiency was observed for DMBQ concentrations ranging from 10 to 80 microM; a similar reduction in the fraction of viable cells excluding trypan blue occurred after exposure to 4-fold higher concentrations. A dose-dependent amount of DNA fragmentation was revealed by the alkaline elution technique either in V79 cells exposed to DMBQ concentrations ranging from 10 to 80 microM or in kidney, gastric mucosa and brain of rats treated with single p.o. doses ranging from 33 to 300 mg/kg. Both in vitro and in vivo DNA lesions were largely repaired within 24 hr, but their promutagenic character was demonstrated by the induction of 6-thioguanine-resistance in V79 cells. Primary cultures of rat hepatocytes displayed a greater resistance to the cytotoxic and DNA-damaging activities of DMBQ, and did not exhibit a clear evidence of DNA repair synthesis. Similarly, DNA fragmentation was practically undetectable in the rat liver. Therefore, DMBQ should be considered as a direct-acting genotoxic chemical which is metabolized to less, or nonreactive, species. These findings suggest that DMBQ could produce genotoxic effects in patients taking dimethophrine.\r"

  ".W": "The antimuscarinic properties of the newly synthetized polymethylene tetramine derivative, methoctramine, were investigated in binding and functional assays. Methoctramine displaced the specific binding of [3H]-N-methylscopolamine [( 3H]NMS) and [3H] pirenzepine from membranes of rat tissues with the following order of affinities: heart = cerebellum greater than cortex greater than submandibular glands, the ratio of the affinities of the compound for the heart and the glands amounting to about 130. Computer fits of binding curves generated in cardiac and cortical membranes were compatible with an interaction at one binding site, whereas those in submandibular glands and cerebellum had slopes significantly lower than 1. Experiments performed in cardiac membranes to investigate the effect of methoctramine on the dissociation kinetics of [3H]-NMS showed that concentrations of compound up to 1 microM did not affect the dissociation of [3H]-NMS elicited by an excess of NMS. At greater concentrations (10-100 microM), methoctramine dose dependently inhibited [3H]-NMS dissociation, thus revealing an allosteric interaction. In in vitro functional assays, methoctramine displayed more than 100 times greater affinity for the muscarinic receptors mediating negative inotropic and chronotropic effects in guinea pig atria than for those responsible for tracheal contraction. Similarly, the compound was a more potent antagonist of the bradycardial response to bethanechol than of the bladder tonus increase, saliva secretion and hypotension induced by the muscarinic agonist in anesthetized cats. Finally, in the pithed rat, methoctramine preferentially inhibited cardiac M2 (vagal bradycardia) over ganglionic M1 (McN-A-343-induced hypertension) responses. The evidence appears to characterize methoctramine as being the most selective M2 muscarinic antagonist described to date.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Supersensitivity to norepinephrine, methoxamine and clonidine was observed in the mesenteric artery. Methoxamine and clonidine are immune to disposition by neuronal and extraneuronal uptake, and supersensitivity to norepinephrine persisted in the presence of hydrocortisone and desmethylimipramine, suggesting that the supersensitivity was postjunctional in origin. In addition, reserpine pretreatment induced supersensitivity to norepinephrine in control mesenteric arteries, but in hyperthyroid mesenteric arteries no further increase in sensitivity was observed after reserpine pretreatment supporting a postjunctional mechanism. In the aorta, a small increase in sensitivity was observed to norepinephrine, no supersensitivity was detected to methoxamine and supersensitivity to norepinephrine was not apparent in the presence of hydrocortisone, suggesting a prejunctional mechanism. The existence of a small prejunctional component in the mesenteric artery also was indicated, as incubation with hydrocortisone attenuated the degree of supersensitivity after thyroid hormone pretreatment. In the mesenteric artery, postjunctional supersensitivity also was observed to 5-hydroxytryptamine. However, no increase in sensitivity was observed to KCl or CaCl2 suggesting that the postjunctional supersensitivity was not due to an increase in the sensitivity of the contractile apparatus, and was specific for receptor-mediated effects of agonists.\r"

The strips were preincubated with an irreversible cholinesterase inhibitor and superfused with Krebs' solution under various experimental conditions. Pirenzepine (0.1-10 microM) and atropine (10-100 nM) produced an increase in electrically evoked ACh output through the inhibition of presynaptic muscarinic receptors. Contractile response to endogenous ACh released by electrical stimulation was enhanced by pirenzepine and atropine at lower concentrations, whereas the highest concentrations of pirenzepine (10 microM) and atropine (100 nM) caused a reduction in the enhanced contractile response and a significantly diminished response, respectively. These results demonstrate that the concentrations of pirenzepine and atropine, effective in inhibiting presynaptic muscarinic receptors, differ from those inhibiting postsynaptic muscarinic receptors and suggest the possibility that presynaptic M1 muscarinic receptors regulating ACh output may be present in the guinea pig ileum.\r"

In an attempt to elucidate some of the factors causing gastrointestinal dysfunction in experimental diabetes we examined the responses of jejunal smooth muscle in streptozotocin-induced diabetes in rats to some of the neurotransmitters and autocoids found in the enteric nervous system. Jejunal tissues from 4- to 5-week diabetic rats were examined for their responses to neurokinin (NK) A, NKB, substance P (SP), bradykinin, neurotensin, bethanechol, isoproterenol and phenylephrine. The affinities for all these agonists, except for SP which increased slightly with diabetes, were the same in both control and diabetic tissues. NKA was the most potent neurokinin and elicited the largest contractile responses from jejunal tissues of both control and diabetic animals. The contractile response to NKA, but not that to NKB or SP, was increased in the jejunum from diabetic animals. Part of this increased responsiveness was antagonized by atropine. The contractile effects of the cholinergic agonist, bethanechol, were not altered by the diabetic state. Decreased relaxation responses in the jejunum from diabetic animals were observed for bradykinin, neurotensin and isoproterenol, but not for phenylephrine. These results suggest that the myogenic actions of several agonists are modified in experimental diabetes.\r"

In the presence of LiCl, 5-HT caused a marked increase in total [3H]inositol phosphate levels in cortical (maximal effect + 420%, EC50 = 7 microM) and to a lesser extent in hippocampal and striatal slices prepared from the immature (8-day-old) rat; the cortical 5-HT-induced phosphoinositide response was tetrodotoxin resistant. The magnitude of the increase in the cortical phosphoinositide response caused by 5-HT was maximal at 1 day postnatal and progressively declined to reach 6% of this maximal response in the adult. After incubation of immature (8-day-old) rat cortical slices for 2.5 min with 5-HT (in the absence of LiCl), inositol 1-phosphate, inositol 1,4-bisphosphate, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate and inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate levels increased about 2-fold. A variety of 5-HT2 or mixed 5-HT1/5-HT2 agonists stimulated total [3H]inositol phosphate formation in the immature rat cortex and hippocampus with a rank order of potency [alpha(+)-methyl-5-HT greater than quipazine greater than MK 212 greater than 5-HT] which resembles their potencies at the 5-HT2 binding site. In contrast, the 5-HT1A agonist 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin, the 5-HT1B agonists 1-(m-trifluoromethylphenyl)piperazine and 1-(m-chlorophenyl)-piperazine and the 5-HT3 agonist 2-methyl-5-HT were inactive.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Electromagnetic monitoring of renal, carotid, femoral and superior mesenteric artery flow was used. During the induction of heart failure a general reduction of flow with preponderance of that of the carotid and femoral arteries occurred. The secretin infusion caused increases in renal flow by 58%, carotid flow by 63%, femoral flow by 50% and superior mesenteric flow by 34%. The corresponding reductions in arterial resistances were 33, 35, 31 and 24%, respectively. Compared to levels before induction of failure, restoration of flow in all arteries as well as cardiac output was achieved, with exception of renal flow that was 25% higher. The arterial pressure was not altered and a modest inotropic effect of secretin was confirmed. It was concluded that in acute left ventricular failure secretin caused a general distribution of the increased cardiac output in the arteries investigated with a preponderance of renal artery flow.\r"

At the opposite, the same doses of yohimbine did not influence the hypotensive effect of clonidine in control groups of normotensive animals (Wistar-Kyoto rats) treated under the same conditions. Interestingly, we observed that the central hypotensive effect of clonidine was greater in the hypertensive animals than in normotensive rats. Thus, we concluded that the central hypotensive effect of clonidine is affected by very low doses of yohimbine in spontaneously hypertensive rats and not in normotensive control animals. The yohimbine insensitive effect might be due to the action of clonidine on one type of medullary receptors specific to the imidazoline structure. On the physiopathological side, it seems therefore that, in hypertensive animals, there is a yohimbine sensitive mechanism, perhaps an alpha-2 adrenoceptor stimulating effect, which is nonexistent in normotensive animals.\r"

Spontaneous behavior was videotaped and analyzed by estimating the percentage of time spent by the animals in performing certain specific behavioral items. Mu agonists stimulated DA-release and metabolism in the accumbens at lower doses than in the caudate. Maximal stimulation of DA release did not exceed 100% except after high doses of methadone (10 mg/kg) which stimulated DA release in the accumbens by more than 300%, possibly as a result of hypoxia. Stimulation of DA release was associated to stimulation of behavior at low doses and to a biphasic inhibitory-stimulatory syndrome after higher doses of the opiates. Pretreatment with low doses of naloxone (0.1 mg/kg s.c.) or with the irreversible mu antagonist beta-funaltrexamine (10 nmol i.c.v.) increased the ED50 for the stimulation of DA release by the three opiates. In contrast with mu agonists, agonists of kappa receptors like U50,488, bremazocine and tifluadom decreased DA release in the accumbens and in the caudate and reduced motor activity. These effects were antagonized only by rather high doses of naloxone (2.5 mg/kg s.c.) and were not affected by pretreatment with beta-funaltrexamine (10 nmol i.c.v.).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Within minutes after administration of cisplatin a significant increase in lithium clearance, fractional lithium clearance (CLi/Cin) and e-TT/OT was observed (from 270 +/- 32 to 387 +/- 60 microliters/min/g kidney weight, 0.202 +/- 0.03 to 0.340 +/- 0.06 and 0.415 +/- 0.02 to 0.497 +/- 0.02, respectively). These increases indicate an increased fluid delivery from both the proximal straight segment and the late proximal convoluted tubule after cisplatin administration. Concomitantly absolute proximal reabsorption rate was significantly decreased. Intervention by saline loading (2% of body weight) did not prevent the increase in e-TT/OT, but the increase in CLi/Cin was significantly less than in the control group. This finding suggests that saline loading protects either the pars recta of the proximal tubule or the juxtamedullary nephrons. Thus, cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity in the rat is initiated by an acute mainly proximal tubular impairment including both pars convoluta and pars recta of the proximal tubule.\r"

The negative inotropic effect of acetylcholine (ACh) was unaffected by exogenous guanyl nucleotides or variation in external Mg++ or Ca++. ACh (2 microM) shortened the action potential, reduced spike amplitude and usually increased the maximum diastolic potential. GTP and guanyl-5'-yl-imidodiphosphate in the presence of ACh increased action potential amplitude and duration and increased further the diastolic potential. Low external Mg++ had similar effects to guanyl-5'-yl-imidodiphosphate but their effects were not additive. It is suggested that these compounds delay the activation of a transient outward K+ current by ACh.\r"

  ".W": "The aim of the present study is to examine how opioid agonists and antagonists modify the splanchnic nerve stimulation (SNS)-induced release of catecholamines from the dog adrenal gland in vivo, in an attempt to elucidate whether opioid receptors play a functional role in controlling catecholamine release. Output of epinephrine (EPI) and norepinephrine (NE) was determined from adrenal venous blood by using high-performance liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection. SNS (0.3, 1 and 3 Hz) produced increases in both EPI and NE output in a frequency-dependent manner. Leu-enkephalin (10-100 micrograms/kg i.v.) and morphine (10-100 micrograms/kg i.v.) attenuated the increase in EPI and NE output induced by 1 or 3 Hz of SNS without affecting the basal catecholamine output. A 25 to 40% reduction of the SNS-induced increase in catecholamine output was observed after the treatment with 100 micrograms/kg of leu-enkephalin or morphine. The increase in EPI and NE output induced by 1 and 3 Hz of SNS was enhanced markedly by naloxone (10-1000 micrograms/kg i.v.) and by naltrexone (10-1000 micrograms/kg i.v.). The SNS-induced increase in catecholamine output doubled after treatment with 100 and 1000 micrograms/kg of naloxone or naltrexone. Basal catecholamine output and the increase in output induced by 1 Hz of SNS were unaffected by naloxone or naltrexone. These results suggest that endogenously released opioid peptides inhibit the release of catecholamines by activating opioid receptors in the adrenal gland of the dog.\r"

In male DA (Dark Agouti) rats, the same parameters increased greatly: from 0.20 +/- 0.01 to 1.38 +/- 0.13 g/l for AAF and from 8.75 +/- 1.01 to 27.15 +/- 3.28 for B/F. PB concentrations determined on the same serum samples were similar in both rat strains. Female DA rats also were responsive to PB administration. Propranolol binding to DA rat serum from the treated group was characterized by an increase in high-affinity binding site concentrations. The binding of propranolol to isolated rat AAG at various concentrations (0.2-1 g/l), alone or associated with rat serum albumin at a constant concentration (36 g/l), also was studied. Propranolol binding capacities to rat AAG were increased 2.4 times by the presence of albumin and consequently B/F values for both proteins agreed with values obtained with serum samples. These results indicate that increased propranolol binding to rat serum induced by PB administration is probably a direct consequence of increased concentrations of AAG. The high sensitivity of DA rats to PB suggests that this strain should be used preferentially for the study of the effect of cytochrome P-450 inducers on AAG metabolism and cationic drug binding.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of nicardipine, a dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker, on adrenal medulla were investigated in chloralose-anesthetized dogs. For analysis of the adrenal medullary function, adrenal venous catecholamine rates were determined. Intravenous administration of nicardipine (50 micrograms/kg) induced a marked increase in both adrenal catecholamine rates and heart rate and a simultaneous decrease in blood pressure. This effect on epinephrine and norepinephrine release is probably explained by the involvement of baroreflex mechanisms. After acute splanchnicectomy, nicardipine (50 and 100 micrograms/kg i.v.) failed to modify catecholamine secretion rates from the denervated adrenal medulla during electrical stimulation of the splanchnic nerve at low (2 Hz) and high (5 Hz) frequencies. In conclusion, these results suggest that in vivo a functional dihydropyridine-sensitive calcium channel is not required for calcium entry mechanisms into dog chromaffin cells. Moreover, adrenal medulla is not involved in the antihypertensive action of nicardipine.\r"

The findings suggest that these pathways cross between the ganglionic clusters located at the angle formed by the seminal vesicle and the vas deferens. They are not structurally related to the central nervous system by way of the hypogastric or pelvic ganglion. The histamine-containing pathways are independent of the noradrenergic pathways as dissociation between norepinephrine depletion and histamine depletion can be shown under nerve degeneration. The time course of nerve degeneration over a long period after sympathectomy shows a biphasic effect on histamine levels of the vas deferens. The early histamine depletion would be indicative of degeneration of histamine-containing pathways, and the delayed histamine increasing phase has been considered as due to accumulation of mast cells in the degenerating nerve sheaths. A possible role for the histamine-containing pathways in the modulation of sympathetic activity is envisaged.\r"

  ".W": "To test the hypothesis that functional postsynaptic alpha-2 adrenoceptors exist in rat myometrium, we examined whether specific binding sites for [3H]rauwolscine were present on microsomal membranes from myometrium of nonpregnant, day 16 pregnant and delivering rats and whether an alpha-2 adrenoceptor agonist has functional effects. The myometrium of rats at term undergoes a physiological denervation, confirmed in this study by ultrastructural examination of uterine samples and by [3H]saxitoxin binding studies. Binding sites for rauwolscine of similar Kd (11-15 nM) were present in all groups of myometrium and were localized on plasma membranes. There was no significant change in the density of rauwolscine binding sites in membranes from day 16 animals compared to nonpregnant ones, but a significant fall (38%) from these values at term. Strips of uterine circular or longitudinal muscle from nonpregnant, day-16 or day-22 pregnant rats failed to respond to the selective alpha-2 agonist, BHT-920, in the presence of propranolol; i.e., BHT-920 neither caused contraction nor inhibited contractions induced by oxytocin. BHT-920 did not affect the inhibitory effects of isoproterenol which were antagonized by propranolol. However, it antagonized contractions to norepinephrine in the presence of propranolol with a pKB value of 5.6 to 5.7. These contractions were phentolamine-sensitive. BHT-920 displaced rauwolscine from binding to all groups of myometria (IC50 = 2 to 3 x 10(-6) M) and displaced prazosin (Kd = 0.65 nM) from binding to myometria of nonpregnant rats (IC50 value congruent to 2 x 10(-4) M). Phentolamine also displaced rauwolscine from binding (IC50 = 2 x 10(-8) M). 5-Hydroxytryptamine displaced rauwolscine from binding only at higher concentrations (IC50 greater than 10(-5) M). We conclude that binding sites for alpha-2 adrenoceptor antagonists in myometrial microsomes were located primarily on smooth muscle plasma membrane. A smooth muscle alpha-2 adrenoceptor agonist appeared to occupy a site on muscle with the same affinity as it displayed toward rauwolscine binding site and competitively inhibited effects of an alpha-1 agonist. Our data suggest that alpha-2 adrenoceptor binding sites may exist on smooth muscle without coupling to contractile function, but their occupancy competitively prevents occupancy of alpha-1 agonist receptor activation sites.\r"

  ".W": "Radiographic contrast agent-induced acute renal failure is an increasingly recognized clinical event. Multiple factors have been implicated in its development. Recent experiments have demonstrated that sodium diatrizoate, a common ionic radiocontrast agent, is moderately toxic to proximal tubule cells in vitro, and that this toxicity is enhanced by hypoxia. In this study, we compare toxicities of the nonionic radiocontrast agent, iopamidol, and the commonly used ionic contrast agent, diatrizoate. Suspensions enriched in proximal tubule segments were exposed for 82.5 min to 10 or 25 mM diatrizoate or 10 or 25 mM iopamidol with or without 22.5 min or 30 min of hypoxia. Cell viability parameters, including basal and uncoupled respiratory rates, tubule cell potassium and calcium levels and cell ATP content were measured. No consistent differences in tubule viability parameters were observed between tubule suspensions exposed to 10 mM concentrations of the radiocontrast agents during either oxygenated or hypoxic conditions. Under oxygenated conditions, both 25 mM iopamidol and diatrizoate exposure produced greater metabolic alterations in renal tubules than control conditions, but the effects were not statistically significant. With concomitant hypoxia, the alterations after 25 mM diatrizoate exposure were significantly greater than those seen after exposure to 25 mM iopamidol. Iopamidol had less of a detrimental effect on renal tubule potassium content and both basal and uncoupled respiratory rates than that of diatrizoate under these conditions. Thus, diatrizoate is more toxic to rabbit renal proximal tubule cells than iopamidol in vitro, and this difference in toxicity is enhanced by hypoxia.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In the present studies, the effect of DMSO on existing atherosclerotic lesions in cholesterol-fed rabbits was investigated. Rabbits were placed on an atherogenic diet containing 1% cholesterol for a period of 10 weeks. At the end of the 10-week period, the rabbits were randomly divided into two groups: one group was placed on a control diet consisting of regular rabbit chow for an additional 12-week period, whereas the remaining group was continued on the atherogenic diet. During this period half of the rabbits in each of these groups were treated with DMSO (approximately 5 g/kg) which was included in their drinking water. Food consumption and fluid intakes were monitored daily and body weights at weekly intervals. Total serum cholesterol levels were measured at periodic intervals. Lipid deposits in the eye which accompany atherosclerosis were examined before and at 12 weeks after institution of the new dietary regimens. At the end of 12 weeks, all rabbits were killed and the thoracic aortas were examined for changes in the extent of atherosclerosis. Food consumption and body weight increased in rabbits on the control diet and in those treated with DMSO. Those maintained on the atherogenic diet showed little change in food intake or body weight. Fluid intake was significantly elevated in all rabbits placed on DMSO. Serum cholesterol levels returned to normal in all rabbits on the control diet. Serum cholesterol levels remained unchanged in rabbits kept on the atherogenic diet alone.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Scatchard analyses of [125I]N6-(p-aminobenzyl)adenosine binding to cardiac membranes revealed that the ligand bound to two affinity states of the receptor with Kd values of 0.7 and 9.9 nM. The corresponding maximum binding (Bmax) values were 25 and 86 fmol/mg of protein, respectively. In the presence of 0.1 mM 5'-guanylyl imidodiphosphate, a single affinity state was detected with a Kd of 9.4 nM and a Bmax of 96 fmol/mg of protein. Direct and indirect ligand binding studies with several adenosine receptor agonists and antagonists were used to compare the characteristics of the cardiac receptor with those of the A1 receptor in the cerebellum. The binding properties of the receptors in the two tissues were very similar although marked differences were observed in the binding kinetics of [125I]N6-(p-azidobenzyl)adenosine. Photo-affinity labeling experiments followed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-gel electrophoresis showed that the cardiac receptor had a apparent molecular weight of 37,600, which was slightly but significantly higher than that of the cerebellar receptor (35,500). The present results show that the cardiac receptor has ligand binding properties and a minimal subunit molecular weight similar to the more thoroughly studied A1 receptor in neural tissue.\r"

  ".W": "Previous studies in this laboratory have demonstrated that a cloned neuroblastoma cell line (N18TG2) responds to delta 9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the major psychoactive product of marihuana, with an attenuation of cyclic AMP accumulation that results from an inhibition of adenylate cyclase. The requirement for the Gi regulatory protein, stereoselectivity, pharmacologic specificity and cell selectivity of this response suggest that a receptor for cannabimimetic compounds may be associated with adenylate cyclase in the neuroblastoma cell. Presented here is a comprehensive investigation of cellular effects of chronic exposure to cannabimimetic agents. Short-term exposure to either delta 9-THC or the more potent nantradol analog, desacetyllevonantradol (DALN), at doses up to 100 microM did not compromise the plating efficiency of the cells. Cells that were exposed to 1 microM delta 9-THC (maximally effective for inhibiting cyclic AMP production) for 24 hr in a serum-free medium were shown to accumulate the drug but not to metabolize it. Exposure to 10 microM delta 9-THC or DALN for up to 48 hr failed to significantly affect cell growth rate or protein content per cell. The gross morphology of cannabinoid-treated cells was not altered at the light or the electron microscope level. The cellular organelles and membranes appeared intact, with no remarkable differences from control cells. The inhibition of cyclic AMP accumulation in response to cannabimimetic drugs was diminished in cells treated with delta 9-THC or DALN for 24 hr. This desensitization was homologous because both delta 9-THC and DALN responses were attenuated after exposure to either cannabimimetic drug.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Minutes after balloon catheter injury to the lower aorta, striking spasm of the collateral arteries was routinely evident on the arteriograms, and limb blood flow fell. Spasm was partly reversed either by blockade of thromboxane synthesis (UK-38,485) or its vascular action (SQ 29,548) or by ketanserin, the serotonin receptor antagonist when used alone. Ketanserin combined with either UK-38,485 or SQ 29,548 reversed the spasm completely. We conclude that a combined action of serotonin and thromboxane induces collateral artery spasm when platelets are activated.\r"

  ".W": "The delta opioid receptor antagonist ICI 174864 produces postural abnormalities and barrel rolling after i.c.v. injection and hindlimb and tail flaccidity after spinal subarachnoid injection in rats. These effects appear to result from nonopioid characteristics of ICI 174864 because they are neither shared nor blocked by other opioid antagonists (naloxone, ICI 154129 and WIN 44,441-3) and are produced by two compounds (ICI 174644 and ICI 178173) that are structurally related to ICI 174864 but lack its delta antagonist properties. Barrel rolling and hindlimb paralysis are also produced by dynorphin A-related peptides; however, rats failed to demonstrate tolerance or cross-tolerance to the hindlimb paralytic actions of ICI 174864 or dynorphin A (1-13) after 7 days of continuous spinal intrathecal infusion of either of these compounds. Whereas hindlimb responses to low doses of ICI 174864 (1.6-6.2 nmol intrathecally) were usually transient, higher doses (6.2-25 nmol intrathecally) produced persistent hindlimb motor dysfunction, altered nociception, priapism, hindlimb edema, bladder infarction and atony and urinary incontinence. Neuronal and axonal changes in the lumbosacral spinal cords of rats with persistent and transient neurologic deficits provided direct evidence of the neuropathologic actions of ICI 174864 (3.1 and 6.2 nmol) and ICI 174644 (25 nmol). These results indicate that 1) use of ICI 174864 as a selective delta opioid receptor antagonist is potentially compromised by its nonopioid neuropathologic actions and 2) ICI 174864 and dynorphin A-related peptides are unique among opioid agonists and antagonists in sharing barrel rolling and hindlimb paralytic effects. A similar mechanism of action may underlie the shared nonopioid actions of these peptides.\r"

Intracerebroventricular administration of morphine inhibited spontaneous LC discharge of both anesthetized and unanesthetized rats but morphine was at least 10 times more potent in anesthetized rats. In anesthetized rats LC discharge evoked by sciatic nerve stimulation was insensitive to doses of morphine (0.03 or 0.1 microgram) that inhibited LC spontaneous activity. Only the highest dose of morphine (0.3 microgram) which inhibited completely tonic activity decreased significantly evoked discharge. In parallel experiments in unanesthetized rats, the presentation of auditory stimuli evoked a pattern of LC discharge similar to that evoked by sciatic nerve stimulation in anesthetized rats. Morphine (1.0 and 3.0 micrograms) decreased both spontaneous and evoked activity in these rats; however, spontaneous LC discharge was more sensitive to morphine, as was observed with anesthetized rats. Quantitative analyses of these effects indicated that morphine tends to alter the pattern of LC discharge to sensory stimuli such that the signal-to-noise ratio (ratio of evoked/tonic activity during stimulus presentation) is increased. Morphine effects were reversed by naltrexone (1.0 mg/kg s.c.) in anesthetized rats and 1.0 microgram i.c.v. in unanesthetized rats. The present results indicate that the degree of arousal and the availability of environmental stimuli are important determinants of opiate effects on LC activity.\r"

Infusion of [14C]NA into the avian renal portal circulation at 10(-10) mol/kg/min revealed that the 14C label was actively transported into urine at a rate 74% that of simultaneously infused tetraethylammonium. Increases in NA infusion rates enhanced 14C label transport so that it eventually equalled the excretion rate of tetraethylammonium. At a NA infusion rate of 10(-8) mol/kg/min, this transport was not affected by probenecid, pyrazinoic acid or p-aminohippurate. Above infusion rates of 10(-7) mol/kg/min, saturation of 14C label transport was reached. Electrophoretic analysis of the 14C label excreted in urine at NA infusion rates less than 10(-7) mol/kg/min revealed a single, unidentified metabolite. At infusion rates greater than 10(-7) mol/kg/min, both the radiolabeled metabolite and [14C]NA were found in the urine. We conclude that NA is transported by a specific mechanism into the avian tubule cell where it is metabolized. As the body's load of this vitamin increases, NA is excreted first in the form of a metabolite and then as both metabolite and unutilized NA.\r"

Inhibitory potencies for this GABA (100 microM)-dependent 36Cl- uptake were determined for 16 cage convulsants including 10 bicycloorthocarboxylates and 3 bicyclophosphorus esters and for 8 polychlorocycloalkane insecticides. Inhibition by derivatives of t-butylbicycloorthobenzoate (TBOB) and t-butylbicyclophosphorothionate (TBPS) depended on the substituents at both positions 1 and positions 4. Among them, the 4-cyano-phenyl analog of TBOB was the most potent inhibitor with an IC50 value of 40 nM. Other cage convulsants such as picrotoxinin, tetramethylenedisulfotetramine and p-chlorophenylsilatrane were less potent than TBOB and TBPS. The potencies of bicycloorthocarboxylates, bicyclophosphorus esters and other cage convulsants in inhibiting GABA-stimulated 36Cl- uptake by rat cerebral cortex were significantly correlated with those in inhibiting [35S]TBPS binding to the human and mouse brain receptors (r = 0.96, P less than .01). There also was a significant correlation between the potencies of the polychlorocycloalkanes examined in inhibiting GABA-stimulated 36Cl- uptake and [35S]TBPS binding to the mouse brain receptor (r = 0.94, P less than .01). In these correlations, the polychlorocycloalkanes appear to fall on a different line than that for the bicycloorthocarboxylates, bicyclophosphorus esters and other cage convulsants. Both the cage convulsants and the polychlorocycloalkanes are considered to act at convulsant sites coupled functionally to the GABA receptor chloride ionophore complex and thereby to modulate allosterically or directly the GABA-gated chloride channel leading to their toxic action.\r"

One group of beagle dogs (N = 5) responded under a multiple fixed-interval (FI) 300 sec, fixed-ratio (FR) 30 response schedule of food presentation. With both l-nicotine (0.1-3.0 mumol/kg i.m.) and l-nornicotine (0.1-10.0 mumol/kg i.m.), FI response rates, when averaged across the entire session, were increased at low doses and decreased at high doses; FR response rates were only decreased. d-Nicotine (0.1-30.0 mumol/kg i.m.), and d- and dl-nornicotine (0.1-10.0 mumol/kg i.m.) produced a transient increase in FI response rates at low doses. The effects of the same five compounds on pupillary diameter, rectal temperature and heart rate were measured in a second group of beagle dogs (N = 6). Both pupillary diameter and rectal temperature were decreased initially by l-nicotine (0.6 mumol/kg i.v.), d-nicotine (6.0 mumol/kg i.v.) and d-, l- and dl-nornicotine (3.0 mumol/kg i.v.); base-line levels were recovered within 60 min. Aside from differences in potency, the time courses of action were similar for all five compounds. Increases in heart rate also were produced by all five compounds, but there were marked differences in the duration of action. l-Nicotine and d- and dl-nornicotine produced appreciable, sustained increases in heart rate, whereas d-nicotine and l-nornicotine produced moderate, brief increases. The combined results of the present experiments indicate the stereoisomers of nicotine and nornicotine are behaviorally and physiologically active, and may contribute in varying amounts to the pharmacologic actions of tobacco.\r"

Previously available irreversible antagonists of beta adrenergic receptors have generally exhibited low affinity (typical IC50 values greater than or equal to 1 microM). By contrast, S49 lymphoma cells incubated with 10 nM BIM for 120 min and then washed extensively showed a 70% loss in beta adrenergic receptors, as measured by [125I]iodocyanopindolol binding. This loss, which could be prevented by propranolol, represented a decrease in receptor number without a change in affinity of the remaining receptors for [125I]iodocyanopindolol. The BIM-induced decrease in binding sites was persistent in membranes incubated for several hours after BIM treatment. BIM did not inactivate alpha-1 adrenergic receptors on Madin Darby canine kidney cells, alpha-2 adrenergic receptors on human erythroleukemia cells, nor did BIM treatment alter guanyl-5'-yl-imidodiphosphate-mediated regulation of agonist binding to the beta adrenergic receptors in S49 cell membranes. BIM treatment decreased cyclic AMP (cAMP) accumulation in S49 cells in response to the beta adrenergic agonist isoproterenol, but increased prostaglandin E1-stimulated cAMP accumulation (P = .09) without altering cAMP production in response to forskolin. The inactivation of beta receptors in S49 cells by BIM (IC50 = 0.30 nM) correlated closely with the loss in beta adrenergic receptor-mediated cAMP accumulation in these cells (IC50 = 0.59 nM), implying the absence of substantial receptor reserve for this response. We conclude that BIM is a potent, irreversible, selective beta adrenergic antagonist for the study of beta adrenergic receptors in cultured cells.\r"

  ".U": "89293682\r", 
  ".W": "In recent years it has become increasingly evident that the toxicity produced by a variety of compounds can be attributed to their metabolites. Simple dose-toxicity studies of a metabolite will help to elucidate its toxic effect, but it is not possible to quantify its role in the toxicity produced by the parent compound unless the disposition of the preformed and endogenously formed metabolite is taken into account. We assessed the contribution of the metabolite, R-(+)-menthofuran (MF), to the hepatotoxicity observed after i.p. administration of R-(+)-pulegone (PUL) to rats. As the major constituent of pennyroyal oil, PUL has been linked to the deaths of several young women over the past several years. After i.p. administration of PUL and MF to separate groups of rats at doses selected to match the area under the curve of generated and synthetic MF, plasma alanine transferase was comparable between groups. Although the area under the curve was matched, the peak concentration in plasma of MF formed in vivo is 4.5 times higher and occurs much earlier than after the administration of MF itself. When the exposure of rats to preformed and synthetic MF is matched with respect to time course in plasma, PUL produces more than twice the increase in plasma alanine transferase and hepatocellular necrosis than does MF. The results suggest that events other than those associated with the disposition of MF contribute to the hepatotoxicity observed after ingestion of PUL, and they emphasize the importance of time course in assessing the role of a metabolite in the toxicity of a given compound.\r"

It also was effective against cisplatin-induced emesis in the dog; however, it was inactive against emesis caused by apomorphine and hydergine in the same species. In terms of activity profile, BMY-25801 could be differentiated both from metoclopramide and domperidone. Metoclopramide was nonselectively active against emesis induced by cytostatic agents, radiation and D2-dopamine receptor agonists, whereas domperidone was selectively effective against emesis induced by apomorphine and hydergine only. BMY-25801 failed to reveal any D2-dopamine receptor antagonist properties in several pharmacological tests (catalepsy, apomorphine stereotypy, serum prolactin, striatal dihydroxyphenylacetic acid and [3H]spiperone displacement) whereas metoclopramide was uniformly active in these tests. The activity profile of domperidone was compatible with its classification as a peripherally acting D2-dopamine receptor antagonist. BMY-25801 and metoclopramide antagonized serotonin-induced bradycardia (Bezold-Jarisch reflex) in the anesthetized rat, a response involving peripheral neuronal 5-HT3 receptors. Thus, BMY-25801 represents a novel antiemetic acting independently of D2-dopamine receptor mechanisms; however, its exact mode of action remains unknown.\r"

  ".W": "The properties of the various types of voltage-sensitive Ca++ channels (VSCC) are becoming increasingly well characterized, but the mechanisms which control the number and types of channels expressed by cells are virtually unknown. To study the regulation of VSCC in neuronal cells we have used PC12 pheochromocytoma cells. Binding of [3H]nitrendipine was used to determine the number of dihydropyridine-sensitive channels, and the uptake of 45Ca++ was used to determine the functional state of VSCC on the cell surface. Prolonged depolarization by elevation of extracellular K+ caused concomitant time and concentration-dependent decreases in both [3H]nitrendipine binding and depolarization-dependent uptake of 45Ca++. Changes in binding and ion flux plateaued at about a 50% decrease with 3 days of depolarization and an extracellular K+ concentration of 50 mM. Return of the cells to normal K+ caused the recovery of both [3H]nitrendipine binding and 45Ca++ uptake within 24 hr. Measurements of the intracellular free Ca++ concentration determined that it remained elevated for several hours with K+ depolarization, but returned to normal within 15 hr. Growth of the cells with a concentration of ionomycin, which caused a similar increase in intracellular free Ca++, also caused a loss of [3H]nitrendipine binding sites. Thus, it appears that the number of functional VSCC can be regulated by changes in intracellular Ca++ such as those associated with prolonged depolarization. However, because Ca++ channel number remained depressed while intracellular free Ca++ returned to normal, other mechanisms controlling channel number also must be involved.\r"

Prevention of the inhibitory action of endogenous adenosine [by adenosine deaminase (100 mU/ml) or theophylline (3.3 X 10(-4) M)] resulted in increased levels of cAMP and increased rates of lipolysis with forskolin. However, the relationship between cAMP levels and rates of lipolysis remained the same under all conditions. N6-phenylisopropyladenosine (PIA; an analog of adenosine) abolished the increase in cAMP level produced by isoproterenol (10(-7) M) or forskolin (10(-6) M) and the lipolytic response to forskolin. However, PIA failed to inhibit completely the lipolytic response to isoproterenol. Dose-response curves to isoproterenol were determined in the presence and absence of adenosine deaminase. PIA (10(-6) M) inhibited the increase in cAMP levels under both conditions. PIA also inhibited the lipolytic responses that were associated with increases in cAMP levels, i.e., high concentrations of isoproterenol alone and isoproterenol with adenosine deaminase. A plot of cAMP levels against corresponding rates of lipolysis for all conditions agreed with previous observations that the relationship for isoproterenol differs from that for forskolin. At any concentration of cAMP the corresponding lipolytic response was greater for isoproterenol than for forskolin. The possibility of a cAMP-independent lipolytic response was discussed.\r"

The LS and SS were selected from a heterogeneous stock (HS) of mice for differential sensitivity to the hypnotic effects of ethanol as measured by the duration of the loss of the righting reflex (sleep time). In the present study, we tested 100 HS for ethanol sleep time. The mice with the shortest sleep time (HS-SS) and the mice with the longest sleep time (HS-LS) were selected and tested for the effect of ethanol and muscimol on chloride flux in cerebellum. The effects of ethanol and muscimol on both cerebellar and cortical chloride flux were also examined in rats from the 7th generation selected for differential sensitivity to the hypnotic effects of ethanol (high acute ethanol sensitive rats-HAS and low acute ethanol sensitive rats-LAS). Low concentrations of ethanol (10-30 mM) potentiated muscimol stimulation of 36Cl- uptake in both cortical and cerebellar membranes prepared from ethanol-sensitive animals (HS-LS and HAS). None of the ethanol concentrations tested altered stimulated chloride uptake in ethanol-resistant animals (HS-SS and LAS). No differences in muscimol stimulation of chloride uptake were observed between the pairs of selected lines. These findings strongly suggest that genetic differences in ethanol hypnosis are related to differences in the sensitivity of gamma-aminobutyric acid-operated chloride channels to ethanol.\r"

  ".W": "A previously unknown interaction between acetylcholine (ACh) and adrenergic mechanisms is described, which increases the likelihood of a physiological association between the two divisions of the autonomic nervous system. In particular, ACh had a novel effect to disengage the neuronal mechanism that is purported to regulate the release of norepinephrine from sympathetic nerves. Brief exposure to ACh (1.4 X 10(-7) M-1.4 X 10(-5) M) inhibited the stimulation-evoked release of [3H]norepinephrine from guinea pig atria and ureter and rabbit aorta but higher concentrations (8.8 X 10(-5) or 1.4 X 10(-4) M) or prolonged exposure to moderate concentrations either had no visible effect or enhanced release. ACh blocked the ability of yohimbine, the presynaptic alpha receptor antagonist, to enhance the liberation of 3H-transmitter during field stimulation at 2 and 5 Hz, and it did so in all three of the test tissues. This effect was not attributable to a direct competition between ACh and yohimbine for presynaptic alpha sites and ACh did not act like yohimbine to increase transmitter release. The antagonistic effect of ACh bore no relation to the direct effect of ACh on adrenergic neurotransmitter release and occurred regardless of whether ACh itself inhibited, enhanced or did not affect transmitter liberation. Atropine blocked the effect of ACh on 3H-transmitter efflux and restored the capacity of yohimbine to enhance transmitter release. Inhibition of neurotransmitter release by norepinephrine was partially antagonized by ACh and this antagonism was also countered by atropine. Enhancement of norepinephrine release by phenoxybenzamine was also blunted by ACh. These findings cannot be incorporated into a model of neurotransmitter regulation that interprets the enhancement of norepinephrine release by adrenergic antagonists as the result of interruption of an on-going negative feedback system. The action of yohimbine appears linked to activation of presynaptic sites and not simply to their passive occupancy. A working model is offered to account for the interaction between ACh and adrenergic antagonists.\r"

A significant loss of cardiac amino-nitrogen concentration and cathepsin D activity was observed 6 hr after permanent occlusion MI or 10 min of MI followed by 6 hr of reperfusion in rats. A novel, potent, PAF antagonist, CV-6209 (160 nmol/kg or 1.6 mumol/kg) injected after the ligation, significantly retarded the loss of amino-nitrogen and cathepsin D activity in a dose-related manner. In another group of rats, CV-6209 (1.6 mumol/kg) significantly blocked the hypotension induced by repetitive injections of PAF (570 pmol/kg) with an apparent half-life of approximately 180 min. In isolated rat hearts perfused with Krebs-Henseleit solution, PAF (25 nmol/l) significantly increased coronary perfusion pressure by 15 +/- 2 mmHg and induced an increase in cardiac permeability using fluorescein isothiocyanate bovine albumin as a marker. Furthermore, the increase in cardiac permeability induced in isolated perfused rat hearts undergoing 15 min global ischemia followed by reperfusion was significantly attenuated by CV-6209 (250 nmol/l). These data indicate that PAF is an important mediator of ischemic damage in rat MI. Moreover, the extension of ischemic damage may be enhanced by the increase in cardiac permeability induced by PAF.\r"

Propranolol pretreatment did not significantly alter spontaneous NE overflow, total NE overflow, NE overflow/stimulus or fractional NE overflow in either WKY or SHR mesenteric vascular preparations at any of the PNS frequencies used. Yohimbine pretreatment did not significantly alter spontaneous NE overflow but did significantly increase total NE overflow, NE overflow/stimulus and fractional NE overflow at all PNS frequencies used in both WKY and SHR preparations. The magnitude of the effect of yohimbine on NE overflow/stimulus did not differ between WKY and SHR over the range of PNS frequencies used. The lack of effect of propranolol on NE overflow suggests that corelease of epinephrine is not sufficient to activate beta adrenergic receptor-mediated modulation of noradrenergic neurotransmission in either WKY or SHR mesenteric vascular preparations under the in vitro study conditions used. However, the effects of yohimbine indicate that prejunctional alpha-2 adrenergic receptor-mediated inhibition of noradrenergic neurotransmission is operative in both WKY and SHR mesenteric vascular preparations. These effects of yohimbine also suggest that no significant differences exist between the functional level of prejunctional alpha-2 adrenergic receptor-mediated autoinhibitory modulation of noradrenergic neurotransmission in mesenteric vascular preparations from adult WKY and SHR under the in vitro study conditions used.\r"

  ".W": "A mathematical diffusional model for drug distribution between milk and plasma has been proposed recently. The purpose of this study was to assess the ability of the model to predict milk to plasma drug concentration ratios (M/P) observed in vivo. The distribution of four model compounds (diazepam, phenobarbital, phenytoin and propranolol) was measured in lactating New Zealand White rabbits. M/P ratios were determined in vivo (M/Pobs) under single dose (diazepam = 6.14, phenytoin = 0.690 and propranolol = 2.16) and during steady-state infusions (phenobarbital = 0.566 and propranolol = 2.69). Predicted M/P values (M/Ppred) were calculated from in vitro measures of the unbound fractions of drug in skim milk and serum, respectively), the skim to whole milk drug concentration ratio, milk and plasma pH and the pKa of the model compound. M/Pobs values were highly correlated with M/Ppred (r2 = 0.976) when the data for all four drugs were pooled. No significant difference was found between M/P values observed after a single dose or constant i.v. infusion of propranolol. These results support the usefulness of the diffusional model for predicting M/P in vivo and indicate that single dose data may be used to obtain M/Pobs values reflecting average steady-state milk and plasma levels. The diffusional model has several important applications in the study of drug transfer into milk.\r"

The purpose of this study was to test the ability of the model to predict the milk to plasma drug concentration ratio (M/P) in vivo for propranolol under conditions in which propranolol plasma protein binding was altered. Five lactating rabbits were administered a 1.6-mg/kg loading dose of i.v. dl-propranolol, followed by a 1.02 mg/(kg/hr) maintenance infusion of propranolol. Four hours after the initiation of the infusion, an i.v. bolus dose of 40 mg/kg of bovine alpha-1-acid glycoprotein (AAG) was administered. Blood and milk samples were collected for up to 8 hr after the initiation of the propranolol infusion; plasma and whole milk propranolol levels were quantitated by high-pressure liquid chromatography. Serum and skim propranolol unbound fractions, as well as the skim to whole milk propranolol concentration ratio were determined in samples collected before and after AAG administration. AAG administration resulted in a 22% decrease in mean unbound fraction of plasma and a 52% increase in mean total plasma propranolol concentration (35% decrease in mean systemic clearance). Observed M/P values fell from 2.13 +/- 0.42 to 1.23 +/- 0.34) AAG administration, closely approximated M/P observed in vivo. Total milk levels, however, were unaffected by AAG. The results are indicative that the diffusional model also holds under conditions in which one of the model parameters, such as unbound fraction of plasma, is altered. The lack of effect on total milk levels illustrates the importance of both M/P and systemic clearance in controlling milk drug concentrations, hence neonatal exposure.\r"

  ".W": "The hemodynamic and cardiac electrophysiologic properties of pimobendan, a new pyridazinone-benzimidazole type inotropic agent, were studied in urethane-anesthetized dogs. The cumulative i.v. administration of 0.1, 0.3, and 1.0 mg/kg pimobendan caused a dose-dependent decrease in mean arterial pressure and an increase in sinus heart rate. When heart rate was maintained constant by overdrive atrial pacing, hemodynamic changes in response to pimobendan consisted of dose-related increases in right ventricular isometric contractile force (P less than .05 at 0.3 and 1.0 mg/kg), left ventricular +dP/dt (P less than .05 at 0.3 and 1.0 mg/kg), and left circumflex coronary artery blood flow (P less than .05 at 1.0 mg/kg). Increases in each of the aforementioned hemodynamic parameters were sustained for up to 4 hr after the i.v. administration of 1.0 mg/kg pimobendan. The cardiac electrophysiologic changes associated with pimobendan administration included decreases in the atrial (P less than .05 at 1.0 mg/kg), ventricular (P less than .05 at 0.3 and 1.0 mg/kg), and atrioventricular nodal functional (P less than .05 at 0.3 and 1.0 mg/kg) and effective (P less than .05 at 1.0 mg/kg) refractory periods. Atrioventricular conduction velocity was enhanced after pimobendan, as indicated by a shortening of the AH (P less than .05 at 0.3 mg/kg and at 1.0 mg/kg) and PR intervals (P less than 0.05 at 1.0 mg/kg). Pretreatment with propranolol (0.5 mg/kg i.v.) attenuated the pimobendan-induced decrease in the ventricular refractory period and the increase in heart rate, whereas the decrease in arterial pressure was enhanced. These results indicate that the i.v. administration of pimobendan to anesthetized dogs produces a dose-related positive inotropic effect, coronary and peripheral vasodilation, and cardiac electrophysiologic effects that include decreases in atrial, atrioventricular, and ventricular refractoriness as well as a facilitation of atrioventricular conduction. The observed electrophysiologic changes may be mediated, in part, by a baroreceptor-mediated increase in sympathetic nervous system activity.\r"

Prenatal nicotine exposure resulted in a selective suppression of maturational increases in norepinephrine and dopamine levels and utilization rates in the cerebral cortex and also reduced transmitter levels in sympathetic pathways to the lung and kidney. The regional selectivity of the effect, combined with measurements of synaptosomal uptake of [3H]norepinephrine and of tyrosine hydroxylase activity, all suggested that the alterations in transmitter disposition reflected reduced neural activity as opposed to actions on general cellular development or synaptogenesis. Although the lag in development was largely made up by weaning, deficits in norepinephrine utilization reappeared in young adulthood in the cerebral cortex and midbrain + brainstem, suggesting that lasting functional alterations may occur as a consequence of prenatal nicotine exposure. Comparisons with the results obtained with maternal nicotine injections (which produce largely stimulatory effects on norepinephrine levels and turnover) suggest that the hypoxia/ischemia associated with injected nicotine causes a reactive hyperinnervation; the adverse actions of nicotine on neurotransmitter development are thus highly dependent upon the route of drug administration.\r"

The objective of this investigation was to examine the effect of salicylic acid (SA) and its major metabolites, salicyluric acid and salicyl phenolic glucuronide, on the serum concentrations and renal clearance of inorganic sulfate in rats. Animals were studied using a crossover design in which they received a bolus i.v. injection (75 mg/kg) and infusion (approximately 0.26 mg/min/kg) of SA or the same volume of saline (the vehicle). Blood samples were collected at 2, 3 and 4 hr after administration and urine between 2 and 4 hr. The renal clearance of sulfate and creatinine were examined at mean steady-state SA serum concentrations of 249 micrograms/ml. Although no changes in the serum concentrations and renal clearance of creatinine were observed, the renal clearance of inorganic sulfate was increased significantly (2.13 +/- 0.74 vs. 1.09 +/- 0.54 ml/min/kg in controls, mean +/- S.D., n = 7) and its serum concentration decreased (0.55 +/- 0.12 vs. 1.04 +/- 0.23 mM in controls). These changes were not due to alterations in uric acid concentrations as uric acid serum concentrations and renal clearance were unchanged when examined at similar steady-state SA serum concentrations in a subsequent study. The effects on sulfate disposition also were probably not due to the major metabolites of SA: no changes in the serum concentrations or renal clearance of sulfate were observed at mean steady-state concentrations of 52 micrograms/ml of salicyluric acid or 73.7 micrograms/ml of salicyl phenolic glucuronide after their direct administration.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Marked interindividual variability has been reported in the plasma concentrations of the antiarrhythmic agent propafenone required for arrhythmia suppression. One possible explanation is the variable generation of active metabolites: it is known that the major metabolite 5-hydroxypropafenone and the more recently described metabolite N-depropylpropafenone can accumulate in plasma to concentrations similar to those of propafenone, and 5-hydroxypropafenone has proven active in animal models. We therefore compared the effects of these metabolites to those of propafenone on action potential characteristics of canine Purkinje fibers at a wide range of cycle lengths. After base-line measurements, propafenone or 5-hydroxypropafenone was superfused at successive concentrations of 0.1, 0.3 and 1.0 microM for 30 min each and measurements were repeated. Both drugs depressed maximum phase zero upstroke slope of the action potential (Vmax); 5-hydroxypropafenone was similar to propafenone in potency with both causing significant effects at very low concentrations (0.1 microM). Vmax depression was cycle length-dependent and the time constants for onset of and recovery from use-dependent Vmax depression were similar. The compounds also shortened action potential duration at 50% but not 90% repolarization. N-depropylpropafenone produced electrophysiologic effects that were similar to those of propafenone and 5-hydroxypropafenone but was less active. We conclude that these metabolites are sufficiently potent that they may explain at least in part the unpredictable concentration-response relationship seen with propafenone.\r"

In some animals, two pairs of ultrasonic dimension gauges were positioned in 1) an area of the left ventricle which would become ischemic after thrombotic occlusion of the LAD and 2) a reference area which would remain unaffected by LAD occlusion. After making an occlusive thrombus by injecting thrombin (50-200 U) and calcium chloride (50-100 mumols) into a cannulated and mechanically occluded side-branch of an isolated segment of the mid- to distal LAD, animals were given either streptokinase (5,000, 10,000, 20,000 or 40,000 U of bolus, followed by 500, 1000, 2000 or 4000 U/min of infusion, respectively) or saline, i.v. At the termination of the experiment, thrombus wet weight and, in some animals, infarct size (measured by tetrazolium staining) were determined. In control animals, thrombus wet weight was 26.7 +/- 5.4 mg (n = 8) and infarct size, as a percentage of the total left ventricle, was 30.1 +/- 4.7% (n = 6). Spontaneous reperfusion (return of LAD blood flow) was not observed in control animals that received saline. Intravenous administration of streptokinase produced a dose-dependent increase in the percentage of animals reperfusing, and a dose-dependent decrease in both thrombus wet weight and the time to reperfusion.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The ability of various noncompetitive inhibitors (NCI) of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor to inhibit gamma-aminobutyric acidA (GABA) receptor activity in brain was investigated. Micromolar concentrations of NCI such as tetraphenylphosphonium, mepacrine, chlorpromazine and phencyclidine inhibited muscimol-induced 36chloride (36Cl-) uptake in rat cerebral cortical synaptoneurosomes in a noncompetitive manner. D-Tubocurarine behaved as a competitive inhibitor. In experiments measuring the time course of muscimol-induced 36Cl- uptake, a decline in the apparent transport rate constant (k') (reflection of desensitization) occurred over the first 3 sec. At lowered temperature (22 degrees C) the k' did not decline during the first 4 sec. Under these conditions preincubation of the vesicles with tetraphenylphosphonium caused a marked decline in the apparent k' over the first 5 sec (transition T1/2 of 1.04 sec) suggesting that tetraphenylphosphonium promotes desensitization of the GABA receptor. The inhibition of muscimol-induced 36Cl- uptake by NCI was reduced in the absence of Ca++. In addition, Ca++ decreased the potency of muscimol to stimulate 36Cl- uptake with an IC50 = 64 microM. The interaction of NCI with GABA agonist and convulsant sites associated with the GABA receptor-gated Cl- channel also was investigated. NCI antagonized noncompetitively [3H]t-butylbicycloorthobenzoate binding to convulsant sites whereas only mepacrine and chlorpromazine antagonized binding of [3H]muscimol to agonist sites. These findings suggest that 1) inhibition of the GABA receptor-gated Cl- channel by NCI may explain the convulsant properties of several of these compounds and 2) there may be structural domains common to the GABA receptor and nicotinic receptor-gated ion channels that selectively permit interactions with various NCI.\r"

Neither factor inhibited the specific binding of [3H]NT to membranes prepared from rat heart. LF was heat-sensitive, was destroyed by treatment with trypsin and was not converted to SF by boiling. SF was heat-stable but was destroyed on incubation with Pronase. SF was partially purified by boiling, acid treatment and ion-exchange chromatography on Q-Sepharose. Incubation of membranes with either factor resulted in a decrease in the density of binding sites for [3H]NT with no change in the affinity of the binding sites for [3H]NT. The inhibitory effect of LF was fully reversible and was not affected by increasing the concentration of Ca++ in the binding assay. In contrast, inhibition by SF was not reversible but could be prevented by increasing the concentration of Ca++ or other divalent cations in the assay. The presence of LF during preincubation of membranes with SF attenuated the irreversible inhibition of binding of [3H]NT caused by SF. These results suggest that there are at least two distinct factors in rat brain that are capable of modulating the interaction of [3H]NT with binding sites on voltage-dependent calcium channels in rat brain.\r"

With five successive doses (3.5 mg/kg) the d-MDA isomer was more potent than the l-MDA in its ability to decrease the concentrations of serotonin in the frontal cortex and hippocampus. The same difference occurred in the ability to decrease the hippocampal activity of tryptophan hydroxylase as well as the hippocampal and neostriatal 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid concentrations. However, both isomers of MDMA were equipotent in their ability to decrease serotonergic parameters in the brain areas examined. When the doses were increased to 5 and 10 mg/kg, both isomers of MDA were equipotent in their effects on the serotonin system, whereas the l-MDMA was significantly less potent than its d isomeric counterpart in causing a decrease in serotonergic parameters of the different brain areas. In contrast, treatments with any of the isomers appeared to have a minimal impact on neostriatal dopaminergic parameters. However, treatment with MDA or MDMA caused increases in the nigral concentrations of neurotensin, with the d isomer of both compounds having substantially greater effects on this neuropeptide system. These increases are suspected to result from drug-released dopamine. This study demonstrates that at selected doses, the d isomers of MDA and MDMA are more potent than their l forms in affecting neurochemical systems, whereas high doses of either isomer of MDA share a common ability to induce changes in the serotonergic system that are likely associated with neuronal damage.\r"

Cranial mesenteric arterial pressure, cranial mesenteric vein pressure, cranial mesenteric vein blood flow, venous occlusion capillary pressure, pre- and postcapillary resistances, total mesenteric vascular resistance, lymph flow, lymph and plasma protein concentrations, the capillary osmotic reflection coefficient, and the capillary filtration coefficient were determined in an isolated autoperfused jejunal segment in anesthetized fasted cats during intra-arterial administration of saline or fenoldopam mesylate in saline. Fenoldopam significantly increased mean cranial mesenteric vein blood flow from 26.8 +/- 3.4 to 33.7 +/- 2.8 ml.min-1.100 g-1. This increase in blood flow was due primarily to a significant decrease in mean intestinal vascular resistance from 3.14 +/- 0.32 to 2.54 +/- 0.2 mm Hg.ml-1.min-1.100 g-1, since cranial mesenteric arterial pressure during fenoldopam infusion was not different from the value obtained during control studies. Mean capillary pressure during fenoldopam infusion (17.2 +/- 0.5 mm Hg) was significantly greater than mean capillary pressure during control studies (15.6 +/- 0.3 mm Hg). The mean lymph flow during fenoldopam infusion (0.186 +/- 0.083 g/dl) was significantly greater than the value obtained during saline infusion (0.08 +/- 0.009 g/dl). Fenoldopam infusion significantly increased the mean capillary filtration coefficient from 0.135 +/- 0.021 to 0.275 +/- 0.035 ml.min-1.100 g-1.mm Hg-1 without altering the capillary osmotic reflection coefficient.

  ".W": "It has been suggested that the development of tardive dyskinesia (TD), a serious and sometimes permanent movement disorder that may follow the use of neuroleptic drugs, is due to an increase in the density of or to a functional supersensitivity of D2 dopamine receptors in the striatum. The atypical neuroleptic clozapine (CLZ) is thought not to cause either acute extrapyramidal syndromes or TD because of its intrinsic anticholinergic activity. This hypothesis was examined using an increase in the density of striatal D2 dopamine receptors after chronic neuroleptic treatment in rats as a model of the changes underlying TD. Rats were treated for 14 days with saline; the neuroleptics CLZ, thioridazine or fluphenazine decanoate (FD); the anticholinergic drugs atropine or trihexyphenidyl or with FD together with atropine or trihexyphenidyl. Specific binding of [3H]spiroperidol to striatal D2 receptors was increased by 26 to 31% (P less than .05) in the groups treated with FD alone or in conjunction with any of the anticholinergic agents. There was no significant increase in the density of D2 receptors after administration of CLZ or thioridazine. The results are consistent with the hypothesis that an increase in the density of D2 receptors is associated with the development of TD. Because coadministration of anticholinergic drugs with FD does not attenuate the effects of the latter drug on striatal D2 receptors, it is likely that other properties of CLZ are responsible for its reduced propensity to produce alterations in D2 receptors and/or TD.\r"

Fractional clearances of urinary antipyrine metabolites 4-hydroxyantipyrine, 3-hydroxymethylantipyrine, norantipyrine and unchanged antipyrine were differentially changed by verapamil and diltiazem treatment. With verapamil treatment, 4-hydroxyantipyrine and norantipyrine fractional clearances were markedly decreased, with 3-hydroxymethylantipyrine slightly decreased and antipyrine unchanged. With diltiazem treatment, 3-hydroxymethylantipyrine was decreased, with no significant change in 4-hydroxyantipyrine, norantipyrine or antipyrine. Effect on theophylline clearance differed between verapamil treatment (57.7 to 44.7 ml/min; P less than .01) and diltiazem treatment (50.2 to 49.4 ml/min; N.S.), with prolonged theophylline half-life during verapamil treatment, no change in half-life during diltiazem treatment and distribution volume unchanged by either treatment. Fractional clearances of urinary theophylline metabolites 3-methylxanthine, 1-methyluricacid, 1,3-dimethyluricacid and unchanged theophylline reflected the differential plasma theophylline clearance. During verapamil treatment, 3-methylxanthine and 1,3-dimethyluricacid fractional clearances were decreased, with no change in 1-methyluricacid or theophylline. During diltiazem treatment, 1,3-dimethyluricacid fractional clearance was slightly decreased, and 3-methylxanthine, 1-methyluricacid and theophylline were unchanged.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Tuberculosis lesions presented with features of intracranial space occupying lesions (14), spinal cord compression (13) and lumbosacral root compression (1 child). Ten adults and one child had tuberculous meningitis. Pyogenic meningitis present in 38 cases (31 per cent), was most common in children. The infecting organism was identified in 26 patients; Gram-positive cocci in 17, Haemophilus influenzae in four and other Gram-negative organisms in five. Eleven patients had brain abscesses, caused by bacterial infection in eight, fungal infection in two and Toxoplasma gondii in one. Nineteen patients had clinical and pathological features of viral meningitis. Fourteen patients (12 per cent) died including six children with pyogenic meningitis.\r"

Retrospective analysis of the relationship between the levels of IgG and IgM anticardiolipin antibodies in 84 patients with SLE and the prevalence of spontaneous abortions was performed. The time at which abortion occurred amongst these patients was compared with that in 26 subjects with a poor obstetric history, but without SLE. Forty-six of 84 patients had anticardiolipin antibodies and had 143 pregnancies, of which 84 (58.7 per cent) resulted in fetal loss. In contrast, amongst the 38 patients without anticardiolipin antibodies only 23 of 93 pregnancies (24.7 per cent) resulted in fetal loss. The prevalence of spontaneous abortions in the SLE patients was related to the levels of IgG anticardiolipin antibodies; IgM anticardiolipin antibodies were not associated with increased fetal loss. In SLE patients without anticardiolipin antibodies, and in the group of patients without SLE, fetal loss occurred at 14.1 +/- 7.5 (mean +/- SD) and 12.5 +/- 5.5 weeks respectively. When anticardiolipin antibodies were present fetal loss tended to occur at a later stage of pregnancy (17.4 +/- 7.1 weeks) and amongst this group 30 per cent of the pregnancy losses were in the third trimester of pregnancy. These findings demonstrate further that anticardiolipin antibodies are strongly linked to late pregnancy failure in patients with SLE.\r"

The protean presenting symptoms and signs included a history of a prodromal influenza-like illness (48 per cent), rapid onset of headache, clouding of consciousness and confusion (52 per cent), meningism (65 per cent), raised intracranial pressure (33 per cent), deep coma (35 per cent), mutism or aphasia (46 per cent), focal neurological signs (89 per cent), and seizures (61 per cent). When seizures occurred they were almost always focal. The electroencephalogram was the most useful diagnostic test being abnormal in all cases, the majority showing focal changes in one or other hemisphere. Of the neuroradiological procedures employed, computerized tomographic and isotope brain scanning most frequently demonstrated localizing abnormalities in one or both temporal and/or frontal lobes. Midline shift was seen in half the cases. The cerebrospinal fluid was abnormal in every case but was not diagnostic. Cerebral biopsy of one temporal lobe was performed in 40 cases and a positive diagnosis of acute necrotizing encephalitis was made in 37 of these. Herpes simplex virus was isolated from the brains of 29 of the 40 cases in which the procedure was attempted, but immunofluorescence assays for antigens to herpes simplex virus were only positive in 11 out of 25 cases. Serological assays showed a greater than four-fold rise in the anti-herpes simplex virus antibody titre in 13 out of 22 patients tested.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In contrast, a decline in urine concentrating ability (mean 140 mOsm/kg) was found in all patients, exceeding the reduction to be expected from ageing in all but three. These results support the view that treatment with lithium long-term does not damage renal glomerular function, but that progressive impairment of the distal tubular responsiveness to arginine vasopressin is common.\r"

The mean length of hospitalization for vaginal deliveries was 2.7 days before the strike, 1.6 days during the strike, and 2.4 days after the strike. Forty-nine women who delivered during the strike completed questionnaires investigating their attitudes about their length of hospital stay. Although the mean patient response to length of stay was slightly positive, several patients were dissatisfied with their short hospital stays. Patients who stayed for two days or longer were more positive about their length of stay than those who stayed for shorter periods of time. It was planned that most women with vaginal deliveries would be discharged within 24 hours; however, 11 of the 36 women with vaginal deliveries stayed two days or more. This study demonstrates the need to individualize discharge plans. Not all women with vaginal deliveries can be discharged within 24 hours, and one may expect some patient dissatisfaction when early discharge is mandated.\r"

Behavioral science faculty members familiar with the residents also rated 20 of the residents' overall level of interest and ability in psychological medicine. Residents rated themselves highest on doctor-patient relationships and on recognizing patients in distress, and lowest on psychological interviewing and the ability to be psychologically therapeutic. Item intercorrelations and factor analysis suggested that two main dimensions were being evaluated: clinical psychological abilities (including interviewing, diagnosis, consultation, treatment decisions, and treatment) and psychological sensitivity (including doctor-patient relationships, awareness of patient's reactions, and awareness of own feelings.) Residents' self-ratings correlated positively with faculty ratings.\r"

Inhibition of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) binding to the GABA receptor, resulting in general excitation of the central nervous system, may be the underlying mechanism of these adverse phenomena. We demonstrate here that ciprofloxacin displaced a GABA-like substance (muscimol) from the GABA receptor when administered in concentrations of greater than 10(-4) M. These concentrations were lower than those needed by pefloxacin, ofloxacin, and nalidixic acid to reach a concentration that inhibits 50% of binding. The combination of ciprofloxacin and theophylline was additive in reducing the level of muscimol binding to the GABA receptor, whereas a diclofenac-ciprofloxacin combination had no effect. The concentrations of both ciprofloxacin and the other quinolones used were much higher than those observed in human serum and cerebrospinal fluid in a clinical setting; however, different human GABA receptor affinities, preexisting GABA excitation, or underlying central nervous system disease may amplify the excitatory side effects observed by the co-administration of quinolones and theophylline. Attention should be paid to the possible epileptogenic activity of the simultaneous administration of quinolones with aminophylline, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or other unpredictable drugs.\r"

The quaternary ammonium anticholinergic antagonist ipratropium bromide was intranasally administered under double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled conditions to assess its tolerance and efficacy in reducing nasal hypersecretion in adult volunteers with experimental rhinovirus colds. Ipratropium was sprayed intranasally three times daily (80 micrograms per treatment) for 5 days beginning 24 h after intranasal inoculation of rhinovirus type 39. Clinical colds occurred in 50% of 30 infected ipratropium recipients and in 76% of 33 infected placebo recipients (P = 0.04). The nasal mucus weights tended to be lower for ipratropium-treated persons (mean +/- standard deviation, 14.7 +/- 15.1 g/5 days) than for placebo-treated recipients (24.7 +/- 28.0 g/5 days; P = 0.076). Whereas total nasal symptom scores were similar between the two groups, the rhinorrhea score analyzed for each day of treatment showed nonsignificant trends favoring the ipratropium group over the last 4 days of treatment. Ipratropium was generally well tolerated. The results suggest that cholinergic mechanisms are at least partially responsible for nasal mucus production in rhinovirus colds but that the effect of anticholinergic compounds alone is insufficient to be of practical use in treatment, although they may have value as components of multi-ingredient preparations.\r"

In a rat model of progressive pulmonary aspergillosis that is characterized by hyphal bronchopneumonia, aerosol amphotericin B (aero-AmB; 1.6 mg/kg given 2 days before infection) significantly delayed mortality in rats compared with animals in a control group. The first death in the aero-AmB-treated group occurred on day 11, by which time seven of the eight control animals had died. The same dose of aero-AmB given as treatment (1.6 mg/kg given 24 h after infection and then daily for 6 days) was also effective. In this trial, eight of the ten animals treated with aero-AmB survived for 7 days, whereas only one of ten control animals survived. Colony counts in lung homogenates obtained 24 h after infection showed an 80-fold reduction in the number of viable spores in animals that had received 6.4-mg/kg doses of aero-AmB 2 days prior to infection. At 48 h after administering a single 1.6- or 3.2-mg/kg dose of aero-AmB, mean lung concentrations were 2.79 and 5.22 micrograms/g of tissue, respectively. We conclude, therefore, that aero-AmB kills inhaled spores and delays the progression of pulmonary aspergillosis by inhibiting mycelial proliferation.\r"

Absorption of the compound in mice was rapid. Maximum concentrations in plasma occurred at less than 0.5 h after oral administration, and the elimination half-life was 1.5 h. Peak concentrations in plasma following oral administration were markedly disproportional to the dose (274 ng/ml at 10 mg/kg, but 2,013 ng/ml at 40 mg/kg). The bioavailability after an oral dose of 40 mg/kg was 58.6%. Clearance was 4.3 liters/h per kg, and the volume of distribution was 7.6 liters/kg at 40 mg/kg. In contrast to the results observed in mice, absorption of the compound in dogs was slow. Maximum concentrations in plasma occurred at 1.7 h after oral administration, and the elimination half-life was 3.3 h. A further difference was that peak concentrations in plasma were approximately proportional to the dose. Following administration of a single oral dose of 5, 10, or 20 mg/kg, maximum concentrations in plasma were 275,800, and 1,950 ng/ml, respectively. The bioavailability after an oral dose of 5 mg/kg was 99.4%. The clearance was 3.7 liters/h per kg, and the volume of distribution was 13.8 liters/kg at 5 mg/kg. Mass balance studies in mice, using [methyl-14C]rimantadine, indicated that 98.7% of the administered dose could be recovered in 96 h. Less than 5% of the dose was recovered as the parent drug in dog urine within 48 h. Finally, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry studies, done with mouse plasma, identified the presence of two rimantadine metabolites. These appeared to be ring-substituted isomers of hydroxy-rimantadine.\r"

The efficacy of therapy with this infusion against experimental Klebsiella pneumoniae meningitis was compared with that of a conventional bolus dose to the animals. The marked difference between the elimination half-life (t1/2) of temocillin in rabbit plasma and human serum (0.3 and 5 h, respectively) was reflected in concentrations in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). The mean peak concentration after infusion occurred 3.5 h later than after bolus dosing, and levels were more prolonged (t1/2 in CSF was 6.3 h compared with 0.83 h following the bolus dose). After infusion, the mean viable count in CSF decreased by 4 log10 CFU/ml, whereas the bolus dose was ineffective because of the rapid fall to subinhibitory concentrations. These results suggest that the infusion system used is valuable for experimental studies with antibacterial agents whose elimination kinetics differ markedly between animals and humans.\r"

MICs of 16-membered macrolides for strains expressing inducible-type resistance to erythromycin were less than or equal to 1 microgram/ml, whereas none of the compounds had activity against strains expressing constitutive-type resistance. The MICs of roxithromycin, miocamycin, rokitamycin, and josamycin increased in the presence of human serum, whereas MICs of the other compounds either were unchanged or decreased.\r"

Both strains of rat displayed tachyphylaxis to repeated stimulation with AVP, and oscillatory tension changes were observed in all vessels from SHR and rarely in WKY vessels at activating concentrations of AVP. 3. AVP did not elicit a contractile response after noradrenaline-induced calcium depletion. 4. After vessels were depleted of calcium by using a combination of calcium-free media and noradrenaline stimulation, restoration of calcium in the presence of AVP elicited a greater contractile response in SHR vessels. 5. The results therefore provide evidence for an increased calcium response to AVP in SHR resistance vessels, although this was only demonstrable by calcium recovery experiments.\r"

The injection of the synthetic dipeptides was not accompanied by any side effects or complaints. 3. The synthetic dipeptides L-alanyl-L-glutamine and glycyl-L-tyrosine were rapidly cleared from plasma. By applying a monoexponential model the elimination half-lives were found to have very similar values (3.8 +/- 0.5 and 3.4 +/- 0.3 min) whether alanine or glycine was occupying the N-terminal position. The estimated volume of distribution was approximately that of the extracellular space. 4. Peptide disappearance was accompanied by a prompt equimolar increase in the concentrations of the constituent amino acids alanine and glutamine as well as glycine and tyrosine. 5. The study provides firm evidence that L-alanyl-L-glutamine and glycyl-L-tyrosine are rapidly (quantitatively) hydrolysed. The results of this study may indicate a safe and efficient parenteral use of the investigated peptides as sources of free glutamine and free tyrosine.\r"

To define the role of circulating noradrenaline in cardiovascular regulation, threshold concentrations for haemodynamic effects were determined in arterial and venous plasma of eight healthy volunteers. 2. Five doses of noradrenaline, 0-54 ng min-1 kg-1, were infused intravenously in random order and single-blind for 15 min per dose. Changes in intra-arterial blood pressure, heart rate, forearm blood flow and forearm vascular resistance were determined, and plasma noradrenaline was measured in arterial and venous blood samples. 3. Significant increases in systolic and diastolic blood pressure were found at arterial and venous plasma noradrenaline concentrations (means +/- SEM) of 3.00 +/- 0.23 and 1.35 +/- 0.12 nmol/l, respectively. A significant decrease in heart rate was found at arterial and venous plasma noradrenaline concentrations of 8.99 +/- 0.69 and 3.09 +/- 0.60 nmol/l, respectively. The lower doses of noradrenaline tended to increase forearm blood flow and to decrease forearm vascular resistance, whereas the higher doses had no consistent effect on forearm haemodynamics. 4. During the noradrenaline infusions 73 +/- 5% of the increase in arterial plasma noradrenaline concentration was extracted in the forearm. 5. The venous plasma noradrenaline threshold concentration was found to be much lower than previously reported. It is concluded that arterial and venous plasma noradrenaline concentrations which are readily encountered in physiological circumstances elicit haemodynamic effects.\r"

This finding suggests that the membrane fluidity of erythrocytes might be decreased in SHR. 3. The fluidity of cultured vascular smooth muscle cells obtained from 10-13-week-old SHR was also reduced compared with that from WKY. 4. These results suggest that the decreased membrane fluidity might be a genetically determined abnormality of the cell membranes in SHR.\r"

Group I rats served as controls, whereas group II rats received 10 mg of cyclosporin/kg and group III rats received 20 mg of cyclosporin/kg daily. 2. After 7 days of cyclosporin treatment, plasma magnesium concentration was 1.04 +/- 0.01 mmol/l in control rats compared with 0.85 +/- 0.01 mmol/l in group II and 0.81 +/- 0.02 mmol/l in group III. After 14 days of cyclosporin administration, group III rats developed severe hypomagnesaemia (0.67 +/- 0.01 mmol/l). This reduction in plasma magnesium was associated with an increase in the urinary excretion of magnesium. 3. This reduction in plasma magnesium and increment in magnesium excretion returned to normal 7 days after cessation of treatment. 4. Additional three-phase acute clearance experiments were performed on eight normal and 12 cyclosporin-treated rats (20 mg/kg). These animals were subjected to acute magnesium chloride infusion. After graded magnesium chloride infusion, despite a similar rise in plasma magnesium, the fractional magnesium excretion was significantly higher in the cyclosporin-treated animals. 5. Analysis of the fractional intestinal absorption of magnesium suggested that the development of hypomagnesaemia after cyclosporin treatment is due to magnesium loss by the kidney. Furthermore, this effect of cyclosporin on magnesium transport is only present during cyclosporin treatment and is reversible when treatment with cyclosporin is withdrawn.\r"

The total, amiloride-sensitive and bumetanide-sensitive influx rates were raised in hypertensive compared with normotensive subjects [median (range): total 0.63 (0.25-1.82) vs 0.40 (0.09-0.65) mmol min-1 l-1, P less than 0.002; amiloride-sensitive 0.43 (0.18-1.56) vs 0.26 (0.04-0.48) mmol min-1 l-1, P less than 0.002; bumetanide-sensitive 0.12 (-0.03 to 0.83) vs 0.02 (-0.25 to 0.21) mmol min-1 l-1, P less than 0.005]. 3.

In order to investigate these, a technique was devised to measure regional deposition rates of a nebulized radiolabelled aerosol in the lungs during normal tidal breathing. 2. The effect of three frequencies of OHFO on pulmonary aerosol deposition rate (PADR) in four normal subjects and five patients with chronic airways obstruction (CAO) were assessed using the technique. 3. In separate experiments employing three normal subjects, the effect of OHFO was studied on the deposition rate of aerosol on the oropharynx and delivery apparatus, and on the amount and characteristics of aerosol inhaled by the subjects. 4. Total PADR was significantly reduced by OHFO at 8 Hz and 16 Hz in the normal subjects, and by all three frequencies of OHFO in the CAO patients. In the normal subjects, the regional distribution of aerosol deposition was unchanged, but in the CAO patients a larger proportion of total aerosol deposition occurred in peripheral lung. 5. OHFO reduced the oropharyngeal aerosol deposition rate, increased the loss of aerosol to the atmosphere before inhalation, and increased the deposition of aerosol on the delivery apparatus. The end result was a reduction in the amount of aerosol inhaled, and in the particle sizes measured at the mouthpiece. 6. We conclude that OHFO reduces the amount of aerosol inhaled, but may improve peripheral deposition of inhaled aerosol in patients with CAO. This effect may be of value in the clinical administration of nebulized drugs.\r"

  ".W": "1. Disturbances of calcium metabolism, mimicking mild, compensated secondary hyperparathyroidism, accompany essential hypertension, but it is not known whether these alterations are primary or only secondary to the elevated blood pressure. 2. Indices of systemic calcium metabolism were followed prospectively during 6 months' treatment with either propranolol, bendroflumethiazide or verapamil in 35 patients with essential hypertension. Multivariate statistical methods were employed to study the effects of blood pressure reduction upon the metabolic indices with adjustment for the effects of the different antihypertensive agents. 3. Propranolol treatment increased the plasma ionized calcium and serum phosphate concentrations, and reduced the serum levels of parathyroid hormone, free fatty acids and glycerol. Neither the total nor the total albumin-modified serum calcium concentration was significantly affected. Thus, presumably the decrease in free fatty acids reduced the calcium complex and the calcium binding to albumin, and consequently increased the plasma ionized calcium, thereby suppressing the secretion of parathyroid hormone. 4. Bendroflumethiazide caused a reduction of the fasting renal calcium excretion to half the pretreatment level, but produced no other significant changes in the various indices of calcium metabolism. 5. During verapamil treatment, the fasting renal excretion of calcium and magnesium increased, whereas the free fatty acids and glycerol concentrations in serum were reduced. These two changes presumably balanced each other, as the plasma ionized calcium and serum parathyroid hormone concentrations were not significantly altered. 6. There were no consistent relationships between the decrease in blood pressure and the changes in the metabolic indices, either in the total sample or within any subgroup.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".U": "89337361\r", 
  ".W": "1. The effects of microcrystalline 'depot' triamcinolone acetonide on renal excretion and blood levels of aldosterone, 18-hydroxycorticosterone and corticosterone were studied in rats over a 13 day period. The renal excretion of all of these steroids was found to be suppressed on day 1 after triamcinolone acetonide administration. Corticosterone excretion remained suppressed for 6 days, whereas aldosterone and 18-hydroxycorticosterone excretion normalized within 3 days. 2. While corticosterone excretion was returning to control values, the excretion of aldosterone rose to values above the pretreatment levels (the rebound phenomenon). 18-Hydroxycorticosterone excretion paralleled that of aldosterone, but the rebound was of less statistical significance. 3. The findings in urine were confirmed by plasma steroid determinations. A suppression of plasma aldosterone, 18-hydroxycorticosterone and corticosterone was observed in the first 24 h after triamcinolone acetonide injection. On day 4 only corticosterone showed lowered levels. An aldosterone rebound could be seen at 18.00 hours, the circadian maximum in rats. 4. These findings suggest that in addition to the effects on glucocorticoids, mineralocorticoids have to be taken into account in the restoration of the adrenal function after corticoid therapy. The aldosterone rebound observed during this sensitive period may be important in preventing disturbances of electrolyte and water homoeostasis.\r"

All 36 patients in the cryo-analgesia group required additional analgesia, while 12 out of the 32 patients in the epidural group did not. This difference was significant at p less than 0.001. Respiratory and cardiovascular measurements were similar in both groups and the only side effect attributable to the epidural fentanyl was itching but this was not a problem.\r"

We have used information from the BCDDP to evaluate the relation of mammographic parenchymal features to the incidence of and mortality from breast cancer, and to examine changes in this relation with duration of follow-up. We also reevaluated the relations of age, body weight, height, menopause, parity, and age at birth of first child to mammographic features of breast tissue. Among women 35-49 years of age at entry, those whose mammographic features were \"glandular\" or \"homogeneously dense\" had a 2.8-fold increase in risk of breast cancer compared to women whose mammographic features were \"atrophic or fatty\". The increased risk was observed up to 9 years after entry. Among women 50-74 years of age at entry, the risk of breast cancer was elevated by a factor of 1.7 for women with glandular or dense breast parenchyma compared to those with atrophic or fatty breasts. The increase in risk, however, diminished with increasing follow-up. The percentage of women with glandular or dense parenchymal features decreased as age, body weight, and parity increased. The percentage with glandular or dense features increased as height increased, and the percentage decreased with menopause. Mammographic parenchymal features were not associated with age at birth of first child.\r"

Methacholine challenge showed that only three of 14 patients increased airway reactivity, which was mild. Maximal pressures which could be generated by the respiratory muscles were reduced in some patients, as was functional residual capacity. Exercise ventilation and breathing frequency were increased and the respiratory exchange ratio was abnormally high. Anaerobic threshold was measured in nine of 15 subjects and was below normal in each case. All but two subjects stopped exercise because of dyspnoea, and the maximum oxygen uptake achieved by the group was 53 per cent (n = 15, range 26-66 per cent) of predicted maximum oxygen consumption. The maximum ventilation averaged only 43 per cent (n = 15, range 16-96 per cent) of the maximal breathing capacity predicted from spirometric tests. Nine patients were studied shortly after being rendered euthyroid by treatment. At rest, only maximal respiratory pressures increased significantly. On exercise, the maximal workload attained and the ventilation achieved increased significantly. Breathing patterns, maximal oxygen consumption, ventilation, anaerobic threshold and cardiac frequency remained unchanged. We conclude that: patients with hyperthyroidism do not generally have increased airway reactivity; when hyperthyroid, respiratory muscles are weak, and improve following treatment; exercise capacity is impaired in hyperthyroid patients probably because of a combination of an inefficiently rapid and shallow breathing pattern, an increase of anaerobic metabolism and discomfort associated with the act of breathing. Although exercise capacity increases and the sensation of dyspnoea may decrease after treatment the pattern of breathing does not immediately return to normal.\r"

A widely differing aetiological background has been reported from Western countries. Work from the African continent is sparse. In a study from the province of Natal in South Africa between 1981 and 1987, 27 cases of crescentic nephritis were identified from a total of 458 patients who underwent renal biopsy at King Edward VIII and Addington hospitals. Poststreptococcal nephritis was the commonest aetiological factor (n = 8). There were six black patients in this group. Nine patients were classified as idiopathic and of these five were black. Four patients (one black) had antiglomerular basement membrane disease. Of the 24 patients subjected to variable combinations of immunosuppression, antiplatelet agents, dialysis and plasmapheresis, 11 improved, observed over four months to four years. Oliguria and severe renal failure at presentation signified a poor prognosis.\r"

The groups did not exhibit significant differences in any of the following parameters of overnight oxygenation: median SaO2, lowest SaO2 or frequency of 3 or 4 per cent dips in SaO2.

  ".U": "89080784\r", 
  ".W": "The statistical standardization of rates produces a single summary value that converts crude rates of occurrence into \"standardized\" rates that are adjusted for differences in the composition of compared populations. Although the process is well described in the epidemiologic literature and is regularly applied in comparisons of large populations, many investigators are not familiar with three important hazards that are magnified for the smaller groups studied in clinical epidemiologic research. This report contains a new \"symmetrical\" outline of the direct and indirect standardization processes, and an illustration of three pragmatic hazards: (1) Because the direct standardizing factor uses the observed stratum-specific rates, and because any stratum-specific rates that depend on small denominators may be misleading or unstable, the indirect method is preferred when the observed strata have small denominators. (2) Both the direct and indirect standardizing methods are highly vulnerable both to the choice of reference population and to the boundaries chosen when strata are demarcated or consolidated. The standardized rates can be altered dramatically according to differences in the stratum proportions of the reference population, or to distinctions produced when standardizing strata are consolidated. (3) If the stratum-specific rates and stratum proportions have different patterns of variation across the strata of the compared groups, the use of a single summary value--no matter what method of standardization is applied--may obscure cogent patterns of variation and significant differences in the stratum-specific rates. These hazards can be overcome if the studied group and the reference population are carefully compared for inconsistent variations in the stratum-specific rates and proportions before any standardizing procedure is applied. In many instances, the best approach may be to compare the unaltered stratum-specific rates, without standardization.\r"

Because chronic strongyloidiasis is often asymptomatic, a 3 per cent prevalence in this selected population indicates that the parasitosis may be much more frequent in the general population of the area. Parasite-specific humoral responses were studied in 48 patients. Strongyloides-specific IgG and IgA antibodies were found by ELISA in the serum of 40 (83.3 per cent) and 43 (89.5 per cent) patients, respectively, and specific IgE antibodies were detected by RAST in 39 (81.3 per cent). The specific IgG antigen recognition patterns of these patients were compared by immunoblotting with those of North and South American and Thai patients, and differences among the groups suggested the existence of separate geographic strains of S. stercoralis. This was further supported by the virtual absence in our patients of the larva currens, a common and highly characteristic sign of strongyloidiasis in subjects infected in southeast Asia. More awareness of the epidemiologic and clinical features of strongyloidiasis, with the use of serologic tests to screen candidates for immunosuppression, may result in the early detection of chronic uncomplicated strongyloidiasis and in the prevention of fatal opportunistic hyperinfections.\r"

  ".W": "In Sri Lanka, Russell's viper, Vipera russelli pulchella, kills more people than any other species of snake. At Anuradhapura in the dry central zone of the island we studied 23 patients with systemic envenoming after proven bites. Seventy-three per cent had swelling at the bite site. Neurotoxicity was the commonest sign of systemic envenoming: 82 per cent had external ophthalmoplegia and 77 per cent had ptosis. Incoagulable blood was found in 59 per cent but only 36 per cent had spontaneous bleeding. Other signs included generalized muscle tenderness (32 per cent), black urine (27 per cent) and persistent oliguria (9 per cent). Laboratory studies showed evidence of a severe clotting disorder: fibrinogen was often depleted as were factors V and X. Fibrin degradation products, including cross-linked moieties, were grossly elevated, clear evidence for enhanced fibrinolysis. Intravascular haemolysis, unrelated to G6PD deficiency, was often present. Myoglobin was detected in the plasma of all 19 patients tested (range 100- greater than 8000 ng/ml) and in the urine in 14 of 18 patients (110- greater than 16,000 ng/ml). Venom antigen (16.5-702 ng/ml) was detected by specific ELISA in the serum of all patients. Its concentration fell with the administration of 50-200 ml of Haffkine polyspecific antivenom raised against Indian venoms. Complete permanent clearance of venom antigen from the circulation was seen in only one of 21 patients who were followed until discharge. Blood coagulability was restored between one and 25 h (mean 8.8) after the first dose of antivenom in the 12 surviving patients whose clotting defect could be followed; no dramatic reversal of neuromyotoxic signs was seen. Haffkine antivenom thus has limited efficacy against systemic poisoning by Russell's viper in Sri Lanka.\r"

The bacterial agreement of S epidermidis between MEE and the nasopharynx was extremely rare in contrast with Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Branhamella catarrhalis, although the organism was also frequently isolated from the nasopharynx. Staphylococcus aureus, having the same minimal inhibitory concentration as that in the nasopharynx, was more frequently found in MEE than S epidermidis. The results suggest that S epidermidis found in MEE is not a pathogen, but rather a contaminant in many instances. Staphylococcus aureus seems to be a causative agent in otitis media with effusion.\r"

The antigen identified by the various antibodies has been shown to be functionally important in the induction of various suppressor cells capable of abrogating B cell responses to pokeweed mitogen. The presence in the skin of cells with possible down-regulatory functions in the immune response may be significant with respect to surveillance against neoplasms and control of appropriate responses to infectious agents.\r"

  ".W": "A culture system that allows human blood monocytes to differentiate into macrophages in vitro was used to study B-cell stimulatory factor-2/interleukin-6 (interferon-beta 2/26 kd protein) expression in mononuclear phagocytes. Using B-cell stimulatory factor-2 (BSF-2) cDNA and a polyclonal, monospecific antibody directed against human BSF-2, we find that strong interleukin-6 (IL-6) expression is initiated in cultured monocytes on stimulation with endotoxin. Maximally induced monocytic BSF-2/IL-6 synthesis (1% to 2% of total proteins secreted by monocytes) is more than ten times stronger than in terminally differentiated macrophages (approximately 0.1% of total secretory proteins). BSF-2/IL-6 mRNA was detectable as early as one hour after stimulation with endotoxin, reaching maximum levels three hours after stimulus. Interleukin-1 (IL-1) was able to stimulate IL-6 synthesis in monocytes, but not in macrophages. Tumor necrosis factor, interferon-gamma and interleukin-2 (IL-2) had no effect on IL-6 synthesis in monocytes or macrophages. We found five molecular weight forms of BSF-2/IL-6 to be secreted by monocytes of 21.5 kd, 23.5 kd, 24 kd, 26 kd, and 28 kd apparent molecular weight. The 26 kd and 28 kd forms were found to represent N-glycosylated molecules, which were not detectable on treatment of the cells with the N-glycosylation inhibitor tunicamycin. The 21.5 kd, 23.5 kd, and 24 kd BSF-2/IL-6 forms were unaffected by tunicamycin treatment. We conclude from our data that cells of the mononuclear phagocyte lineage are one of the main sites of BSF-2/IL-6 (interferon-beta 2/26 kd protein/HSF) synthesis.\r"

  ".W": "Recently, interleukin-4 (IL-4) has been clarified as having T-cell growth factor activity; therefore, it becomes of interest whether IL-4, as well as interleukin-2 (IL-2), affects the proliferation of leukemic cells derived from mature T cells. In the present study, we describe a case of chronic T-lymphocytic leukemia (T-CLL) with monoclonal proliferation of human T-lymphotropic retrovirus (HTLV)-I or HTLV-II negative CD3(+)4(+)8(-) T cell expressing IL-2 receptors without stimulation. Radiolabeled IL-2 binding assay revealed 750 high-affinity and 6,750 low-affinity binding sites per cell. In accordance with the expression of high-affinity IL-2 receptors, the leukemic cells proliferated in response to exogenous IL-2 without prior stimulation. In addition, exogenous IL-4 also induced their proliferation. Moreover, IL-2 and IL-4 exerted a synergistic effect on the leukemic cell proliferation. Although the expression of IL-2 or IL-4 mRNA was not detected in fresh leukemic cells, the expression of IL-2 mRNA, but not IL-4 mRNA, was induced by phytohemagglutinin stimulation, and the leukemic cells proliferated. These findings suggest that not only IL-2, but also IL-4 are involved in the proliferation of leukemic cells of T-CLL.\r"

Resting lymphocytes from ten normal individuals did not proliferate in response to IL-4. Leukemic cells from two ATL patients did not respond to interleukin-2 (IL-2) or IL-4. Leukemic cells from two patients did respond to IL-2, but not to IL-4. In contrast, a strong proliferative response was observed in the IL-4 culture, but not in the IL-2 culture in the remaining four patients. Chromosome analysis of mitotic cells, performed in one of four patients, confirmed that the cells dividing in response to IL-4 were leukemic cells, but not activated normal lymphocytes. These results indicate the activation of IL-4/IL-4 receptor system in leukemic cells from some ATL patients and suggest the possible involvement of the system in the proliferation of leukemic cells and the leukemogenesis in ATL.\r"

  ".W": "To maximize T-lymphocyte killing with anti-pan-T-lymphocyte immunotoxin (IT), prepared by linking ricin A-chain to monoclonal antibody (MoAb) T101 (T101-RTA IT), we have established the nature and the extent of parameters that influence the sensitivity of T lymphocytes to the IT. We showed that peripheral blood T lymphocytes, which are much less susceptible than malignant T cells to the T101-RTA IT, could become highly sensitive to the IT when used in conjunction with NH4Cl. However, enhancement of the IT by NH4Cl only occurred when the pH rose above neutrality. This pH-sensitive process of IT activation by NH4Cl, which led to an all-or-nothing effect within an extremely narrow pH window of 0.7 pH unit width, is due to the fact that NH3 is the effective enhancing component of NH4Cl. We also showed that F(ab')2 or Fab containing IT were much more effective than those produced using the whole IgG counterpart. From these data, we defined a procedure for an optimal and specific elimination of T lymphocytes in vitro by treating them with (Fab)T101-RTA at 10(-8) mol/L at pH 7.8 in the presence of NH4Cl for two hours. This peripheral blood cell processing elicited an abrogation of three logs of functional T-cell response. Under the same conditions, there was no reduction in the number of marrow hematopoietic precursor granulocyte-macrophage colony-forming units (CFU-GM).\r"

  ".W": "To study the effect of interleukin-1 (IL-1) beta on the proliferation of hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPC) in long-term bone marrow cultures (LTBMC), stromal cell layers were established from normal human bone marrow. Autologous cryopreserved mononuclear phagocyte- and T-lymphocyte-depleted bone marrow cells were reinoculated on the stromal layers in fresh culture medium, with or without the addition of human IL-1 beta (30 U/mL). Once a week, half of the culture supernatant was replaced with fresh culture medium with or without IL-1, and all nonadherent cells were returned to the flasks. At weekly intervals during a period of 5 weeks, one culture was sacrificed to determine the total number of cells and hematopoietic progenitor cells, present in the adherent and the nonadherent cell fractions. In IL-1-stimulated cultures, the number of cells recovered during a period of 5 weeks exceeded the number of cells in unstimulated control cultures by 1.5 times. This difference was attributed to a twofold increase in the number of adherent cells. The number of HPC recovered from IL-1-stimulated cultures was not different from that recovered from controls. The levels of colony-stimulating activity (CSA) in supernatants from IL-1-stimulated cultures were significantly higher than those in supernatants from control cultures. These results indicate that IL-1 enhances the recovery of cells in LTBMC by stimulating the proliferation of HPC with the concurrent release of CSA from stromal cells, without diminishing the number of HPC.\r"

More highly purified factor IX preparations could decrease the risk of disease transmission, reduce patient exposure to allogeneic proteins, and reduce the risk of thrombosis. In this study, two immunoaffinity-purified factor IX preparations from commercial vitamin K-dependent coagulation factor concentrates had specific activities of 134 and 155 U/mg. Crude concentrates and purified factor IX preparations were tested for thrombogenicity in rabbits. One of two crude concentrates tested in the stasis-thrombosis assay caused large thrombi at doses of 50 U/kg. Purified factor IX from this concentrate was not thrombogenic at 106 to 234 U/kg. A heparin-treated concentrate that was not active in the stasis model at 100 U/kg caused significant (P less than .05) delayed consumption of rabbit fibrinogen, platelets, antithrombin III antigen, and factor VIII activity at the same dose. Factor IX prepared from this concentrate caused no consumption of coagulation factors at 214 to 243 U/kg despite the presence of trace amounts of activated factor IX. These results indicate that more highly purified preparations could reduce the risk of thrombosis in replacement therapy for hemophilia B. Also, at least for the preparations tested, factor IX and factor IXa were not the thrombogenic components of the crude concentrates.\r"

Lymphoblasts were isolated from patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) or chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) in blast crisis and cultured in vitro with or without dexamethasone. DNA was then purified from the cells and analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis. Only high molecular weight (mol wt) DNA was present in cells cultured without dexamethasone, but a ladder of DNA fragments ranging in size from 180 to 200 base pairs (bp) to greater than 1,500 bp was present in cells cultured with dexamethasone. The DNA fragments were multiples of 180 to 200 bp, suggesting an internucleosomal site of DNA cleavage. The same pattern of DNA fragmentation was detected in normal thymocytes isolated from adrenalectomized rats following in vivo treatment with dexamethasone and in S49 mouse thymoma cells after in vitro incubation with dexamethasone. Dexamethasone-induced DNA fragmentation preceded overt loss of viability in glucocorticoid-sensitive cells but was not detected in two variants of the S49 cell line that are glucocorticoid resistant owing to glucocorticoid receptor defects. The results suggest that glucocorticoids kill human lymphoblastic leukemia cells and both normal and malignant murine thymocytes by a common mechanism that involves glucocorticoid induction of an endonucleolytic activity with cleavage of genomic DNA.\r"

While the majority (88 per cent) of the patients had gastric varices in association with oesophageal varices, 6 (12 per cent) patients had 'isolated' gastric varices. Gastric varices were seen significantly (P less than 0.01) more often with grade 4 than with grade 3 varices. In 11 (28 per cent) of the 40 patients who completed sclerotherapy for oesophageal varices, gastric varices disappeared concurrently on eradication of oesophageal varices or during the following 6 months. Of the initial five patients with gastric varices who received direct intravariceal injections, four rebled; this technique was therefore replaced by combination (paravariceal + intravariceal) gastric variceal sclerotherapy. Emergency combination sclerotherapy successfully controlled bleeding from gastric varices in six of the eight treated patients. Thirty-two patients entered a programme of elective combination gastric variceal sclerotherapy. Variceal obliteration was achieved in 12 cases (38 per cent) and reduction in size was noted in another 7 patients (22 per cent) after a minimum of four courses. There were 11 (23 per cent) deaths, 8 due to uncontrolled bleeding from gastric varices and 3 due to hepatic coma. The other complications of gastric variceal sclerotherapy were minor and included retrosternal pain, fever and dysphagia. It is concluded that gastric varices often coexist with large oesophageal varices. If they persist for 6 months after eradication of oesophageal varices, a combination of paravariceal and intravariceal sclerotherapy should be attempted for their obliteration.\r"

  ".W": "A community-based surveillance study of all central nervous system infections was carried out in Manitoba and the Keewatin District, NWT, between Apr. 1, 1981, and Mar. 31, 1984. There were 201 cases of bacterial meningitis in Manitoba over the study period, 81 (40%) caused by Haemophilus influenzae; all but one isolate tested were type b (Hib). There were nine cases of H. influenzae meningitis in the Keewatin District. The overall annual incidence rate of H. influenzae meningitis in Manitoba was 2.5/100,000; for children under 5 years the rate was 32.1/100,000. For the Keewatin District the corresponding rates were 69.6/100,000 and 530/100,000. A total of 85% and 100% of the cases of H. influenzae meningitis occurred by 24 months of age in Manitoba and the Keewatin District respectively. The age at onset was earlier in native Indian children (22 cases) and Inuit children (9 cases) than in non-native children (59 cases) (p less than 0.005); thus, vaccine prevention of Hib meningitis will likely be more difficult in native Indian and Metis children. Without evaluating the increased potential of H. influenzae vaccines to prevent nonmeningitic forms of disease, we concluded that mass childhood vaccination with polyribosylribitolphosphate (PRP) vaccine is not warranted in Manitoba or the Keewatin District. Immunogenicity studies suggest that administration of conjugated Hib vaccines such as PRP-D in infancy may prevent approximately one-third to two-thirds of cases of H. influenzae meningitis; these vaccines warrant consideration for use in mass childhood vaccination programs.\r"

Both tissue and peripheral blood eosinophilia and high titers of HTLV-I antibody were present. The eosinophilia was most likely caused by the malignant cells producing one or more lymphokines. The patient has achieved a durable complete remission from combination chemotherapy. Because durable remissions in ATL are rare with any known therapy and eosinophilia has not previously been associated with ATL, it is possible that the tumor in this patient was derived from a T-cell subset not usually transformed by HTLV-I. ATL is another malignancy now known to cause eosinophilia.\r"

  ".W": "The morphologic and immunologic features of three cases of an unusual and distinct B-cell lymphoma were recently described and termed monocytoid B-cell lymphoma (MBCL) because of the striking resemblance of the neoplastic cells to reactive monocytoid B-lymphocytes. The morphologic spectrum and the clinical behavior of MBCL were investigated in a series of 21 patients. This study indicates that patients with MBCL usually present with lymphadenopathy and Stage I or II disease. MBCL also occurs at extranodal sites including the salivary gland. Because four of the patients with MBCL had Sjogren's syndrome with characteristic laboratory profiles, these results raise the possibility that there may be a relationship between MBCL and Sjogren's syndrome. Eight patients were male and 13 female (M:F = 1:1.6), and MBCL primarily involved the elderly (median age, 66 years). The most striking clinical findings were high percentages of complete remissions and long survival times indicating that MBCL is a low-grade lymphoma. Of 21 patients investigated, 18 were in complete remission at the time of completion of this study. Two patients died with the disease and one was lost to follow-up. Patients with localized MBCL may have a better survival rate than those with generalized disease. Like other low-grade lymphomas, MBCL can progress to a higher grade lymphoma of large cell type. Unlike other low-grade lymphomas, in MBCL splenomegaly, bone marrow involvement, and leukemic conversion are uncommon.\r"

  ".W": "To differentiate peripheral T-cell lymphomas (PTCL), the authors evaluated the results of T11 monoclonal antibody studies on consecutive cell suspensions prepared from 509 lymph nodes from various lymphoproliferative disorders (LPD). They used T11 (CD2) positivity to identify those LPD in which the content of T cells was high. There were 266 (52%) cell suspensions which contained more than 50% T11-positive cells. More than 75% of the following non-Hodgkin's lymphomas had over 50% T11-positive cells: diffuse mixed cell (DM), diffuse atypical poorly differentiated lymphocytic and lymphoblastic lymphomas; mycosis fungoides; and true histiocytic lymphoma. Eleven cell suspensions had more than 90% T11-positive cells; four were involved by B-cell lymphomas. The cell suspensions prepared from nine of 14 diffuse large cell lymphomas of the T-cell type had more than 50% T11-positive cells. Of these, three of five cases of the polymorphous subtype had fewer than 50% T11 cells, but six of seven lymph nodes of the clear-cell type had more than 50% T11-positive cells. Each of seven DM samples of the T-cell type contained over 50% T11 cells; none had a polymorphous appearance. In the 112 cases of reactive LPD studied, more than 75% of cases of necrotizing lymphadenitis, dermatopathic lymphadenitis, angioimmunoblastic lymphadenopathy, and those with lymph nodes with no specific reactive pattern had more than 50% T11-positive cells. The authors' findings indicate that T11 positivity is a reliable T-cell marker in reactive and neoplastic LPD except for those cases of PTCL with a polymorphous appearance; these tend to lose T11-expression. A multi-parameter diagnostic approach is required in the following LPD: (1) PTCL which are T11-negative; (2) PTCL of small lymphocytic type having an unremarkable T-cell phenotype; (3) SIg-negative B-cell lymphomas which are rich in nonneoplastic T cells; (4) non-Hodgkin's lymphomas with minimal disease which are rich in reactive T cells; and (5) polymorphous large cell proliferations.\r"

The frequency of multicentricity decreased significantly with age. In addition, patients with multicentric disease (involving the vagina and/or cervix in addition to the vulva) had a significantly higher frequency of multifocal disease involving the vulva (involving more than one location on the vulva) and of recurrence than patients without multicentric disease. Human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA was detected by in situ hybridization in 81% of the women with multicentric squamous cell neoplasia. No significant difference was noticed between patients with multicentric and unicentric squamous cell neoplasia in the detection rate of papillomavirus antigen, HPV DNA, the various HPV types, herpes simplex virus Type 2 (HSV2)-related antigen, type-specific antibodies to HSV, and dual HPV and HSV2 infections. These findings suggest that HPV and HSV2, although strongly associated with VIN 3, do not influence the development pattern of squamous cell neoplasia, and that all patients with VIN 3, especially if they are younger than 50 years of age, should be evaluated periodically for additional centers of lower genital tract squamous cell neoplasia.\r"

The T gamma-lymphocytes were CD2+, CD3-, CD8-, CD16+, Leu7-, and Leu19+ with morphologic characteristics of LGL. Newly appearing LGL were much larger and had more prominent azurophilic granules. Although fundamentally they had the same phenotype as the LGL in chronic stage, they showed increased Ia-like antigen and decreased CD16 antigen expressions. Immunoglobulin (Ig) G-kappa type monoclonal component was detected in the patient's serum. The LGL showed a germ-line configuration for T-cell receptor (TCR) beta and gamma chain genes, whereas the clonal chromosomal abnormalities indicated the neoplastic nature of the LGL. The LGL exhibited competent natural killer (NK), interleukin 2 (IL2) activated killer (AK), and antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) activities. The LGL may have derived from NK cells at their mature stage with prethymic phenotype and may have influenced the homeostasis of the patient's humoral immune response.\r"

These PB effector cells were then tested for their ability to lyse autologous leukemic cells in a 51CR release assay. The PB cells before incubation with rIL-2 showed little or no cytotoxicity for autologous blasts (range, 0 to 12%; mean, 2%). However, after incubation with rIL-2, PB cells from four of five children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) at diagnosis or in relapse, and from six of eight children with ALL in remission were able to lyse autologous blasts. The percent lysis (range) was 0 to 69% (mean, 37%) for the former group, and 0 to 113% (mean, 43%) for the latter group. The PB cells from three patients (one in relapse and two in remission) failed to develop LAK activity after incubation with rIL-2. However, in each case cytotoxicity versus K562 was increased after incubation with rIL-2. Furthermore, in a Phase I study of rIL-2 for the treatment of refractory leukemia, a patient was treated with rIL-2 for 3 weeks (nine injections of 3 x 10(6) U/m2 each). Her fresh PB mononuclear cells developed a low level of cytotoxicity (11% lysis) against her autologous blasts during this time. The finding that rIL-2 in vitro and in vivo induces LAK cells with cytotoxicity against autologous leukemic cells provides the rationale for the clinical trial of this agent in the treatment of children with ALL.\r"

After routine premedication, midazolam 0.14 +/- 0.01 mg.kg-1 IV was given over one min followed 5 min later by sufentanil in incremental IV doses of 1.5 micrograms.kg-1 to a total pre-intubation dose of 4.0-5.0 micrograms.kg-1 injected in 10 min. One minute after the initial dose of sufentanil, pancuronium 0.1 mg.kg-1 IV was given in 30 seconds. The incremental doses of sufentanil were based on a greater than 15 per cent increase in rate-pressure product. The mean dose of sufentanil before cardiopulmonary bypass was 9.6 +/- 2.1 micrograms.kg-1 and 13.9 +/- 1.3 micrograms.kg-1 for the entire procedure. A significant decrease in systolic and diastolic blood pressures occurred after midazolam administration which was sustained until sternotomy. A significant reduction in systemic vascular resistance occurred following midazolam. Sufentanil reduced the left ventricular stroke-work index. Tracheal intubation, skin incision and sternotomy elicited no adverse haemodynamic responses. Adequate analgesia, complete amnesia and early recovery of wakefulness were observed.\r"

  ".W": "The mechanism of cardiac actions of rat calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) was analyzed on isolated guinea pig hearts. CGRP exerted a positive inotropic effect in a dose-dependent manner on the electrically driven left atria but not on the ventricles. Immunohistochemical studies demonstrated that CGRP-like immunoreactive nerves were distributed densely in the myocardia of the atria but only sparsely in those of the ventricles. The CGRP-induced augmentation of the contraction was accompanied by the shortening of the time to peak force and the increase in the relaxation velocity. The positive inotropic response to CGRP was significantly enhanced by isobutylmethylxanthine and was attenuated by adenosine. CGRP increased the action potential amplitude and prolonged action potential duration at the level of 50% repolarization in the left atria. In the preparations, which were partially depolarized with an increase in extracellular potassium, CGRP induced slow response action potentials. These electrophysiological results indicate that CGRP causes an increase in the slow inward Ca2+ current. The cyclic AMP content in the left atria significantly increased following the addition of CGRP, the time course of which was nearly consistent with that of the augmentation of the contractile force. In the membrane preparation of the atria, the activity of adenylate cyclase was enhanced by CGRP in a dose-dependent manner. These effects of CGRP are qualitatively similar to those of beta-adrenoceptor stimulation. It is concluded that the CGRP-induced response in the guinea pig atria is attributed to the activation of adenylate cyclase via stimulation of its specific receptor and the subsequent increase in the intracellular cyclic AMP level.\r"

Thirty patients with enzymatic evidence of infarction were imaged within 12-36 hours of chest pain (mean, 23.4 hours). No patient had a previous infarction, and none underwent intervention seeking to restore coronary patency. Infarct size was quantified with computer-generated polar maps of the myocardial radioactivity and expressed as a percentage of the total left ventricular volume. To assess left and right ventricular performance, blood-pool gated radionuclide angiography was performed immediately after SPECT. All 30 patients had perfusion defects consistent with myocardial infarction. Scintigraphic and enzymatic estimates of infarct size correlated well for the group as a whole (r = 0.78, p less than 0.001, SEE = 9.1) but especially for those patients with anterior infarction (r = 0.91, p less than 0.001, SEE = 7.9). The poor correlation observed in patients with inferior infarction (r = 0.50, p less than 0.05, SEE = 10.0) was believed to be related to the frequent occurrence of right ventricular involvement because SPECT assessed only left ventricular damage, whereas the enzymatic method estimated the myocardial injury in both ventricles. A quantitative index of right ventricular infarct size, derived from the relation between the scintigraphic and enzymatic estimates, had a strong inverse correlation with right ventricular ejection fraction (r = -0.89, p less than 0.001, SEE = 3.6).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The prevalence rate of mitral regurgitation in the normal subjects was 38-45% in each group. The mitral regurgitant jets came from the posteromedial commissure in all but two subjects. No aortic regurgitant flow signals were detected in the normal subjects. Tricuspid regurgitation was detected in 15-77% in each group, and pulmonary regurgitation was detected in 28-88%. Regarding the tricuspid and pulmonic valves, the prevalence rate of regurgitation is age dependent (p less than 0.01) and tends toward the lower rate in groups over the age of 30 years. The tricuspid and pulmonary regurgitant jets came from the center of the coaptation of each valve. The area of the regurgitant jet signals in normal persons was significantly smaller (p less than 0.001) than that obtained from patients with organic valve disease. Our study shows that in a large proportion of normal persons under the age of 50 years color Doppler echocardiography permits recording of regurgitant signals behind all valves except the aortic. In conclusion, one should be aware of the existence and characteristics of regurgitation in normal persons when evaluating valvular regurgitation by Doppler techniques.\r"

Percentage distribution of Leu-7+ cells and Leu-11+ cells in BALF was similar in NS and S. But the BALF NK cell activity was significantly augmented by IL-2 or OK-432 (a streptococcal preparation) in NS. It appears that smoking reduces NK cell activity in BALF. It is conceivable that the low NK cell activity in BALF in S might contribute to increased incidence of infection and malignancy in smokers.\r"

Using C3H/HeJ thymocyte PHA costimulation assay, we found that IL-1 activity released from LPS stimulated BALF macrophages was significantly higher in smokers (2.39 +/- 0.33 U/ml) than in nonsmokers (1.47 +/- 0.19 U/ml, p less than 0.05). We also detected IL-1 inhibitory activity in supernatants by using IL-1 inhibitory assay. The inhibitory activity was higher in nonsmokers than in smokers especially under LPS stimulation. The presence of inhibitory factors other than prostaglandin-E2 was suggested from the differential response to the addition of indomethacin into cultures from nonstimulated and LPS-stimulated supernatants of BALF macrophages.\r"

Early clinical studies showed hemodynamic alterations in patients receiving the drug as antitumor immunotherapy. We serially assessed interleukin-2-associated hemodynamic parameters and left ventricular ejection fractions in five patients with neoplastic diseases unresponsive to conventional therapies. By day 4 of therapy, compared with baseline (preinterleukin-2), all patients developed tachycardia (p less than 0.01), decreased mean arterial blood pressure (p less than 0.05), increased cardiac index (p less than 0.05), and decreased systemic vascular resistance (p less than 0.01). In addition, left ventricular ejection fraction fell from 58.0 +/- 4.7 to 36.4 +/- 4.0 percent (0.05 less than p less than 0.10), which was associated with a trend toward left ventricular dilatation manifested by an increase in left ventricular end-diastolic volume index. Transient renal dysfunction was noted in all five patients, and one developed transient respiratory failure; both types of organ dysfunction recovered to baseline values after cessation of immunotherapy. Thus, interleukin-2 induces multiple reversible cardiovascular abnormalities that are similar to the hemodynamic manifestations of human septic shock.\r"

Women had consistently larger beta angles than men. There was a progressive decline in beta with advancing age. Cigarette smokers had lower beta angles than did lifetime never-smokers. Subjects with abnormal lung function patterns had lower beta angles than individuals with a normal pattern. Finally, individuals with asthma, chronic bronchitis, dyspnea and wheezing had significantly lower beta angles than healthy individuals.

Nonspecific lymphocyte blastogenic responses to concanavalin A, phytohemagglutinin and pokeweed mitogen were normal. Analysis of defective in vitro PPD-induced lymphocyte blastogenic responses in these patients revealed that PPD-induced interleukin 2 (IL-2) production was impaired whereas PPD-induced IL-2 responsiveness was normally developed after PPD stimulation.

Pancreatic steatorrhea occurred (with only three exceptions) when the pancreolauryl test revealed a T/C ratio [recovery of the fluorescein of the test (T) and the control (C) day] of less than 10, or when serum fluorescein concentrations were below 0.5 microgram/ml. The NBT-PABA test also showed a negative correlation between urinary PABA excretion or serum PABA concentration and fecal fat excretion, but there was no diagnostically useful cutoff limit indicating decompensation of exocrine pancreatic insufficiency. These findings indicate that the pancreolauryl test may facilitate clinical evaluation of patients with chronic pancreatitis by simultaneously assessing exocrine pancreatic insufficiency as a cause and predicting pancreatic steatorrhea as a sequel of maldigestion. In clinical practice, the pancreolauryl test can be used as a parameter for deciding whether to initiate pancreatic enzyme substitution if direct pancreatic function tests and fecal fat analysis are not available.\r"

In 5 h 12.5 micrograms hrIL-1 decreased total serum T4 levels by 30 +/- 2% (P less than 0.01) and serum T3 levels by 35 +/- 4% (P less than 0.001). However free T4 and T3 fractions increased markedly within the first 140 min by 162 +/- 20% (P less than 0.001) and by 55 +/- 4% (P less than 0.001) resulting in a 88 +/- 20% increase in the free T4 concentration (P less than 0.001) but no increase in the free T3 concentration. Serum TSH concentration fell in the 5 h after the hrIL-1 injection by 77 +/- 3% (P less than 0.001). A similar decrease was observed with 0.125 micrograms hrIL-1. Five hours of starvation did not change serum TSH levels, suggesting that the effect of hrIL-1 on TSH was not due to decreased food intake. In order to test whether the decrease in serum TSH was due to an intrapituitary increase in T3, hrIL-1 was injected in hypothyroid rats: the fall of serum TSH was not prevented and it fell in 5 h from 14.05 +/- 0.56 to 9.66 +/- 0.98 ng/ml (31%, P less than 0.01, n = 14). These results suggest that hrIL-1 acts independently of thyroid hormones. Peripheral metabolism of T4 was studied by implanting [125I]T4 secreting minipumps during 14 days. There was no difference in T4 plasma clearance rate between control and treated animals. The fall of serum T4 was therefore explained by decreased secretion and not by increased catabolism since ether link cleavage of T4 and changes in hepatic deiodinase could not be detected. We therefore suggest that hrIL-1 inhibits thyroid function mainly at the hypothalamic-hypophyseal level.\r"

We examined the effects that the combination of these two agents had on fetal rat long bone cultures. The 48-h resorptive response to recombinant human TGF alpha was markedly enhanced in the presence of IL-1 (either purified from stimulated human monocytes or recombinant human IL-1 alpha) compared to the effects of either agent alone. The enhanced resorptive response to the combination appeared to be dependent on prostaglandin (PG) synthesis, since it was associated with an increase in PGE concentrations in the medium and was completely blocked by either indomethacin or flufenamic acid. Substitution of TGF alpha with epidermal growth factor, a TGF alpha analog, produced identical results. We also found that IL-1 inhibited the mitogenic response of the cultures to TGF alpha. The effects of IL-1 and TGF alpha on PGE concentrations in the medium and DNA synthesis were similar in the osteoblast-like cell line MC3T3-E1. Activated macrophages and certain malignant cells are capable of producing both IL-1 and TGF alpha. Hence, similar interactions could occur in vivo and may regulate some of the effects that either immune or malignant cells have on bone.\r"

Tissues were obtained from six intact males, five untreated castrates, six castrates treated with testosterone (T) for 6 weeks, and four castrates treated with estradiol (E2) for 6 weeks. Samples of the caudal lobe were either assayed biochemically for ER or stained immunocytochemically (ICC) with monoclonal antibodies against the ER or PR. Prostates from untreated castrates had significantly more ER than tissues from intact or T-treated castrates. In E2-treated castrates, ER number increased compared to that in intact and T-treated castrates. With ICC, ER was found only in the nuclei of the fibroblasts and smooth muscle cells of the stroma, not the glandular, ductal, or urethral epithelial cells. Intact and T-treated castrates had a very small number of positive cells, while untreated and E2-treated castrates had a significantly increased number of positive ER cells in the fibromuscular stroma. With ICC, PR was absent in intact or T-treated animals and barely evident in untreated castrates, but was significantly increased in the fibromuscular stroma of E2-treated castrates. The histological preparations indicated there was no stromal hypertrophy in the E2-treated castrates, but the E2 treatment did cause dilation of the glandular acini. Aromatase activity was measured in prostatic microsomes with a radiometric assay. Levels were low (3-30 fmol/h.mg protein) compared to those in brain and placenta, and no differences in activity were seen between castrates and T-treated castrates. Our data demonstrate that androgens can suppress the level of nuclear ER in the rhesus prostate, and that E2 treatment of castrates can induce PR in the same cells as those that contain ER. Thus, under appropriate conditions, estrogens could affect the rhesus prostate through a receptor-mediated pathway.\r"

Bone Gla protein was significantly increased within 2 weeks in both dosage groups (P less than 0.005), reflecting increased bone remodeling. CsA in vivo resulted in an unexpected and significant increase in bone remodeling, with striking bone loss. These effects are dependent on the duration and dose of CsA and appear to be mediated at a local level.\r"

There were 6.3 X 10(5) T4 and 3.7 X 10(5) T8 lymphocytes in PB, resulting in a T4/T8 ratio of 1.72, which is not significantly different from that of the general population. The mean concentration of FF T4 and T8 lymphocytes decreased with increased oocyte maturation; the T8 reduction was statistically significant (P less than 0.05). The proportion of T4 to T8 lymphocytes in FF remained unchanged and was unaffected by maturity of the oocyte. Although estradiol (E2) did not vary with oocyte maturity, progesterone (P) increased and E2/P decreased. There was no correlation between E2 or P levels and distribution of T cells. Fertilization rates were higher in more mature oocytes, but there was no correlation between fertilization and E2, P, E2/P, or T cell subpopulations. It remains to be determined what factors result in the decrease in lymphocytes with increased oocyte maturity and the observed difference in FF T4/T8 compared to PB.\r"

  ".W": "The activity of thymulin (a thymic hormone) is dependent on the presence of zinc in the molecule. We assayed serum thymulin activity in three models of mildly zinc-deficient (ZD) human subjects before and after zinc supplementation: (a) two human volunteers in whom a specific and mild zinc deficiency was induced by dietary means; (b) six mildly ZD adult sickle cell anemia (SCA) subjects; and (c) six mildly ZD adult non-SCA subjects. Their plasma zinc levels were normal and they showed no overt clinical manifestations of zinc deficiency. The diagnosis of mild zinc deficiency was based on the assay of zinc in lymphocytes, granulocytes, and platelets. Serum thymulin activity was decreased as a result of mild zinc deficiency and was corrected by in vivo and in vitro zinc supplementation, suggesting that this parameter was a sensitive indicator of zinc deficiency in humans. An increase in T101-, sIg-cells, decrease in T4+/T8+ ratio, and decreased IL 2 activity were observed in the experimental human model during the zinc depletion phase, all of which were corrected after repletion with zinc. Similar changes in lymphocyte subpopulation, correctable with zinc supplementation, were also observed in mildly ZD SCA subjects. Inasmuch as thymulin is known to induce intra- and extrathymic T cell differentiation, our studies provide a possible mechanism for the role of zinc on T cell functions.\r"

On exposure to IL 1 for 3 h at 37 degrees C, the capacity of fibroblasts to bind 125I-labeled human recombinant IL 1 alpha (125I-IL 1 alpha) was reduced by 75%. The IL 1 binding capability of the fibroblasts was restored to control levels by 16 h after removal of unbound IL 1, and then increased to about twofold over that of control cells by 48 h. This later enhancement of IL 1 receptor expression after IL 1 treatment was abolished by indomethacin. Addition of exogenous (PGE1 and PGE2, also analogues of AMP, or forskolin increased the specific binding of 125I-IL 1 alpha to fibroblasts. Scatchard analysis indicated that PGE2 increased the number of IL 1R from approximately 1.6 X 10(3) to 5.4 X 10(3) per cell without change in the binding affinity. These data suggest that the later IL 1-induced up-regulation of IL 1R is mediated by IL 1 stimulation of endogenous prostaglandin production. The combination of PGE2 and prednisolone increased the number of IL 1R on fibroblasts in an additive manner.\r"

  ".W": "To investigate the effectiveness of calcitonin treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis in relation to bone turnover, we examined 53 postmenopausal osteoporotic women before and after one year of therapy with salmon calcitonin (sCT), at the dose of 50 IU every other day. Baseline evaluation revealed that 17 (32%) patients had high turnover (HTOP), and 36 (68%) normal turnover osteoporosis (NTOP) as assessed by measurement of whole body retention (WBR) of 99mTc-methylene diphosphonate. The two groups did not differ in terms of bone mineral content (BMC) measured by dual photon absorptiometry at both lumbar spine and femoral diaphysis. However, HTOP patients had higher levels of serum osteocalcin (OC) and urinary hydroxyproline excretion (HOP/Cr). Multivariate regression analysis showed no correlation between parameters of bone turnover (WBR, OC, HOP/Cr) and both femoral and vertebral bone density; the latter being negatively correlated only with the years elapsed since menopause (R2 = 0.406). Treatment with sCT resulted in a significant increase of vertebral BMC in the 53 patients taken as a whole group (+/- 7%, P less than 0.001). When the results obtained in HTOP and NTOP were analyzed separately, only those with HTOP showed a marked increment of spinal BMC (+22%, P less than 0.001), NTOP subjects neither gained nor lost bone mineral during the study. Femoral BMC decreased in the whole group after sCT therapy (-3%, P less than 0.003). However, HTOP patients maintained initial BMC values, whereas those with NTOP lost a significant amount of bone during the study period (-5%, P less than 0.001). The increase of vertebral bone mass was associated with a marked depression of bone turnover detectable in both subsets of patients and in the whole group. In conclusion: (a) assessment of bone turnover cannot help predict the severity of bone loss in postmenopausal osteoporosis; (b) calcitonin therapy appears to be particularly indicated for patients with high-turnover osteoporosis, resulting in a net gain of bone mineral in the axial skeleton and a slowing of bone loss in the appendicular bones.\r"

Peptides were selected because they contained amino acid motifs that recur in most defined T cell epitopes. Peptide 257-269 (from the extracellular loop of the AChR alpha-chain between the second and third trans-membrane domains) stimulated cells from six patients and no controls. Peptides from region 125-143 (from the main extracellular 1-210 stretch), which is thought to be an important T cell epitope in rats, provoked responses in 26% of patients and 41% of controls. Two patients responded both to these peptides and to peptide 257-269, thereby implying some heterogeneity of their reacting T cells. Whereas the initial blood T cell samples sometimes responded both to Torpedo AChR and to the 125-143 peptides, T cell lines selected with either antigen subsequently showed no response to the other. This observation suggests that it may be essential to use human AChR sequences for studying truly autoreactive T cells in MG. Finally, no strong association was found between any of the responses to peptides and the HLA types of the responding individuals.\r"

  ".W": "Epidermal growth factor (EGF) is a 53-amino acid polypeptide which is a potent mitogen for cultured cells. The kidney has recently been shown to be a major site of synthesis for the EGF precursor. EGF infusions in sheep result in a diuresis and natriuresis despite a fall in GFR, suggesting a direct tubular effect. Using in vitro microperfusion of rabbit cortical collecting tubules (CCTs) at 37 degrees C, we examined the effect of EGF on the transepithelial voltage (Vt) and arginine vasopressin (AVP)-stimulated hydraulic conductivity (Lp). Pretreatment with peritubular EGF at concentrations from 10(-8) to 10(-12) M resulted in a 50% inhibition of both AVP- and 8-chlorophenythio-cyclic AMP-stimulated peak Lp. This effect was reversed by the protein kinase C inhibitor, staurosporine, but unaffected by indomethacin. CCTs with an initially negative Vt, depolarized after exposure to bath EGF. 10(-8) M EGF applied from the lumen had no effect on either Lp or Vt. Specific binding of 20 nM 125I-EGF to microdissected CCTs was also demonstrated. These results suggest that EGF can modulate both salt and water transport in the CCT via a receptor linked to protein kinase C activation.\r"

We evaluated the role of Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in the alteration of blood-brain barrier permeability (BBBP) in an adult, normal and leukopenic, rat model of meningitis. Intracisternal inoculation of Hib LPS resulted in (a) dose-dependent increases in BBBP from 2 pg to 20 ng, with significant attenuation in the peak response after challenge with 500 ng and 1 microgram; (b) time-dependent increases in BBBP, with a delayed onset of at least 2 h, maximum alteration at 4 h, and complete reversal at 18 h; (c) greater BBBP than after challenge with the live parent strain; (d) and a close correlation (r = 0.86) between CSF pleocytosis and BBBP at 4 h. The LPS effect was significantly inhibited by preincubation with Polymyxin B and neutrophil acyloxyacyl hydrolase, however two different oligosaccharide-specific monoclonal antibodies did not inhibit activity. No change in BBBP after inoculation with Hib LPS occurred in leukopenic rats. Hib LPS, in the setting of an intact leukocyte response, exerts profound effects on BBBP.\r"

This unusual pattern of colony growth depended upon a stimulatory protein(s) produced by mononuclear phagocytes. No GM-CSA activity was found in any chromatofocused fraction of JCGL monocyte-conditioned media but an activity that induced GM-CSA in umbilical vein endothelial cells was detected at pI 6.9-7.2. Moreover, the CSA-inducing monokine was neutralized by an anti-IL-1 antibody in vitro and, in the one case so tested, the same antibody also inhibited \"spontaneous\" colony growth. Therefore granulocyte/macrophage colony growth in JCGL is characteristically abnormal and distinguishes JCGL from the adult form of the disease. This abnormality depends upon the production, by mononuclear phagocytes, of IL-1 which, in turn, stimulates the release of high levels of colony stimulating activity by other cells. The high proliferative activity of CFU-GM we found in JCGL patients, and the high levels of GM-CSA found in their serum are compatible with the view that the in vitro abnormality reflects a similar abnormality in vivo.\r"

Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) was as effective as IL 1 in promoting tumor cell adhesion to EC, whereas IFN gamma and IL 2 were inactive. The IL 1 and TNF induction of EC adhesivity was both concentration (threshold concentration 1 U/ml) and time dependent (peak 4-6 h), reversible within 24 h, and blocked by a protein synthesis inhibitor. The IL 1 and TNF action on EC may play a role in tumor cell lodgement.\r"

Two groups were defined by clinical diagnosis: patients with primary osteoarthritis (n = 4); and those with rheumatoid arthritis (n = 11). The synovium was studied using histological and morphometric techniques. In agreement with previous studies, no histological features specific for either diagnosis were found. A previously validated morphometric method was used to estimate the cellular density of randomly picked fields within defined areas of synovium. The mean nuclear density of cellularity of comparable areas of synovium was significantly different between these two disease states, but the mean nuclear density between individual representative samples within each clinical group was homogeneous. The morphometric analysis of lymphocyte subsets showed that within the upper synovial region and cellular aggregates in osteoarthritis, the distribution of T cells expressing the CD4 and CD8 antigen was the same. In rheumatoid arthritis CD8 cells predominated in the upper synovial region and CD4 cells in the cellular aggregates. Plasma cells were rarely found in osteoarthritic synovia, but were common in rheumatoid arthritis, with IgG-producing plasma cells predominating. Morphometric studies of representative synovial samples may help to improve histological diagnosis and our understanding of pathological mechanisms.\r"

Compared with the initial cohort of 1,155 patients, the 1,801 new cohort patients were older and had an increased prevalence of multivessel coronary artery disease, depressed left ventricular function and prior infarction. Overall complication rates in the recent cohort were either unchanged or decreased from the rates in the initial cohort despite a higher risk patient population. The most significant decreases were in the incidence of coronary spasm (p less than 0.001) and the need for emergency coronary bypass surgery (p less than 0.01). Overall in-hospital mortality was low but was dependent on the extent of vessel disease--0.2% for single vessel disease, 0.9% for double vessel disease and 2.2% for triple vessel disease (p less than 0.001 for linear trend). Acute coronary complications of branch occlusion, dissection or abrupt closure were associated with increased rates of death, nonfatal infarction or need for emergency surgery. Factors showing a multivariate association with increased mortality included a history of congestive heart failure (p less than 0.001), age greater than or equal to 65 years (p less than 0.01), triple vessel or left main coronary artery disease (p less than 0.05), female gender (p less than 0.05) and new onset angina.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

We have demonstrated previously that the fusion of cloned murine CTL and helper T lymphocytes with defined specificity generated hybrid cells that expressed both Lyt-2 and L3T4 as well as two TCR. Data obtained with these hybrid clones demonstrated that cytolysis is closely linked to the CTL TCR. We have analyzed the effects of anti-Lyt-2 and anti-L3T4 as well as anti-TCR mAb on cytolysis, proliferation, and lymphokine release by a number of hybrid clones. We found that anti-Lyt-2 and anti-L3T4 mAb were able to inhibit both proliferation and lymphokine release by the hybrid clones in response to stimulation of either the CTL or helper T lymphocyte parent TCR. In contrast, only anti-Lyt-2 and anti-CTL TCR mAb were able to block cytolysis of target cells bearing the Ag recognized by the CTL TCR. These results provide further evidence that cytolysis is closely linked to the CTL TCR and that Lyt-2 and L3T4 have more than a passive role as accessory molecules on the surface of T lymphocytes.\r"

  ".W": "Con A splenic lymphoblasts were incubated with phosphatidyl-inositol specific phospholipase C (PIPLC) derived from Bacillus thuringiensis and subsequently analyzed for Qa-2 Ag with the Qa-2 reactive mAb Qa-m2. This treatment completely removed Qa-2 detectable Ag on lymphoblasts from H-2d animals, indicating that these molecules are likely anchored to the cell membrane through phosphatidyl inositol (PI). Although exposure of lymphoblasts from H-2b mice to PIPLC greatly reduced Qa-2 expression, a subpopulation of cells retained a limited quantity of the Ag. Bulk cultured anti-Qa-2 CTL generated against the Qa-2 region from H-2b haplotype mice lysed Qa-2+ targets from B6.K2 (H-2b) and BALB/cJ (H-2d) animals. Pretreatment of these lymphoblast targets with PIPLC completely abolished lysis of the BALB/cJ target cells, whereas lysis of B6 targets was reduced only slightly. Anti-Qa-2 CTL clones tested against PIPLC-treated B6 target cells revealed two patterns of reactivity. One group of clones was unaffected in its ability to lyse PIPLC-pretreated targets and cross-reacted on Q6d/Ld molecules expressed on transfected L cells. A second group was unable to lyse PIPLC-pretreated lymphoblasts and cross-reacted on Q7d/Ld targets. These data suggest that H-2b-derived lymphoblasts express two different types of Qa-2 molecules with respect to PIPLC sensitivity; one type is sensitive to PIPLC and cross-reactive with Q7d, the other type is resistant to PIPLC and cross-reactive with Q6d. In contrast, H-2d lymphoblasts express only the PIPLC-sensitive type of molecules. It was also noted that bulk cultured anti-Qa-2 CTL more readily lysed H-2b target cells expressing a smaller quantity of PIPLC-resistant Ag than H-2d targets expressing a larger amount of PIPLC-sensitive Ag. Further, anti-Qa-2 CTL clones readily lysed PIPLC-treated target cells expressing very low levels of serologically detectable Qa-2. This suggests that recognition of class I molecules anchored to the membrane via a PIPLC-resistant linkage may more readily activate CTL for expression of lytic activity than molecules anchored through PI.\r"

  ".W": "The frequency of murine CTL precursors (CTLp) that recognize the human histocompatibility Ag HLA-A2 and HLA-B7 was measured and found to be approximately two orders of magnitude lower than the frequency of CTLp that recognize murine H-2 alloantigens. The possible contribution of other cell surface molecules to this difference in response was addressed by expression of the H-2Ld molecule on a human cell and the HLA-B7 molecule on a murine cell. It was found that both human and murine H-2Ld expressing cells elicited comparable levels of H-2Ld specific CTL. Although murine HLA-B7 positive cells stimulated a higher frequency of HLA-B7-specific CTLp than did human cells, this appeared to be largely due to stimulation of CTLp that recognized HLA-B7 in the context of H-2 molecules; consequently, it was concluded that the difference in the frequency of murine CTLp elicited by human and murine class I Ag is due to species specific structural differences in these molecules. The regions of the class I molecule that were responsible for this difference were mapped using chimeric class I molecules constructed to replace domains of the human molecule with their murine counterparts. It was found that the frequency of CTLp is controlled by structures within the alpha 1 and alpha 2 domains of the molecule. These results are discussed in the light of models for T cell recognition of class I Ag and the diversification of the T cell receptor repertoire.\r"

In the presence of IE molecules, thymic maturation of KJ23a+ clones is infrequent. We investigated the basis of this phenomenon by blocking expression of IE molecules with monoclonal anti-IE antibodies in organ cultures of fetal thymus and in neonates from the C57BR/cdJ strain (H-2k, V beta 17a homozygous). Our data support the contention that this process results from deletion of clones with anti-IE reactivity, as functional blocking of the IE molecule results in maturation of IE-reactive clones and increased numbers of KJ23a+ mature cells. In addition, we noted that blocking of functional IE expression in this haplotype permitted development of both CD4+/KJ23a+ and CD8+/KJ23a+ T cells. The CD4+ clones isolated from anti-IE-treated animals were frequently reactive against IEk; we could demonstrate no alloreactivity against B cell or B lymphoma stimulators in the CD4- clones. We conclude that clonal deletion events during thymic development may be initiated by T cell precursor interactions with MHC molecules against which the mature clones display no measurable reactivity. Specifically, clones destined to be MHC Class I-reactive may be deleted during development by interactions with MHC Class II molecules.\r"

  ".W": "The role of the CD8-, CD4- (double negative) (DN) T cells accumulating in MRL/Mp-lpr/lpr (lpr) mice is unclear. Although they bear the TCR/CD3, the lpr DN cells do not respond to Ag, and the specificity of TCR/CD3 on these cells is unknown. With the aid of monoclonal anti-murine CD3 epsilon (145-2C11), we have investigated the function of the CD3 molecule on the DN cells. 145-2C11 was not mitogenic for lpr DN lymph node cells (LNC), even in the presence of the phorbol ester 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate, whereas MRL/Mp-+/+ (+/+) LNC responded strongly. Surprisingly, CD3 modulation induced by 145-2C11 was much more rapid for lpr DN than for +/+ LNC. For example, the modulation observed after 10 min in lpr DN LNC required at least 2 h in +/+ cells. This was not due solely to a property of the 145-2C11 antibody, because both TPA and the F23.1 anti-TCR mAb also provoked a faster modulation of the TCR in lpr DN LNC. Double-staining experiments showed that co-culturing +/+ and lpr DN LNC did not alter their respective rates of modulation, which suggests an intrinsic defect in the lpr DN cells. Moreover, in LNC from 6-wk-old lpr mice (before the appearance of DN cells), as well as in normal phenotype-bearing T cells (CD8+ or CD4+) from 6-mo-old lpr mice, the CD3 modulation was similar to that of +/+ LNC. After modulation, the CD3 molecule was reexpressed at the surface of both +/+ and lpr DN cells during subsequent incubation of the cells without 145-2C11. In addition, spontaneous recycling of CD3 was similar in +/+ and lpr DN LNC. The rapid modulation of the lpr DN TCR/CD3 is presumably related to the anergy of this cell population.\r"

BM cells from old (26 to 30 mo) or young (3 mo) BALB/c and (C3H/eB x C57BL/6)F1 mice were depleted of mature B cells and these surface Ig (sIg) BM cells were incubated in culture for 3 days. The frequency of newly generated B cells in these cultures was determined by assessing the frequency of slg+ cells and of B cells forming colonies in agar and by assaying the proliferative capacity of these newly generated B cells after stimulation by LPS. We found that BM cells from aged mice are significantly inferior to young ones in their capability to generate new B cells in culture. By mixing old and young slg- BM cells, we found that, in general, this reduction was not caused by a suppressive effect of T cells or of any other cells, but rather to lack of some sort of supportive cell or factor in the aged BM. In addition, we found that the frequency of cells expressing the B220 surface molecule, a B lineage-specific marker, is significantly reduced in aged BM. These results indicate that a quantitative decrease in B cell progenitors combined with changes in cell populations that are important in supporting B cell generation contribute to the age-related decrease in the capacity to generate B cells.\r"

This acidity, comparable to that encountered in host cell endosomes, was known to effect conformational changes in the viral hemagglutinin (HA) which alter the molecule's fusion activity, antigenicity, and susceptibility to enzymes. Three major effects of low pH upon presentation of viral T cell determinants were observed: first, acid pretreatment permitted presentation by pre-fixed APC of two of three linear T cell sites of the HA molecule, bypassing the APC activity required to present untreated virus; second, the two determinants presented in this manner disappeared rapidly from APC surfaces; third, acid-pretreated virus was not efficiently utilized by active APC in the normal pathway of viral antigen presentation. These observations suggest that the pH-induced conformational transition of HA may constitute sufficient processing for certain linear determinants of the molecule and additionally influences the processes involved in the general formation and presentation of viral T cell sites.\r"

Simultaneous limiting dilution transfer of three populations of bone marrow, each expressing a unique allelic cell surface determinant, resulted in independent segregation of donor-derived thymocyte populations within groups of recipient mice. Statistical analysis of the data allowed an estimate of 1 CFUt/3.3 x 10(4) i.v. transferred bone marrow cells. A pulse-chase experiment was utilized to establish whether CFUt seed directly to the thymus, or whether thymic seeding is secondary to extra-thymic engraftment. The results supported the conclusion that bone marrow CFUt utilize a specific interaction with thymic blood vessel endothelial cells to recognize and enter the thymus, and that this seeding occurs within 4 h of i.v. infusion. A kinetic analysis of emigration of the CFUt progeny into the peripheral blood revealed that, in most cases, an early wave of predominantly CD4+ CD8- lymphocytes emerges from the thymus approximately 4 wk after radiation and reconstitution. In a few cases, the first progeny of CFUt to emerge from the thymus were predominantly CD4- CD8+. Commitment of CFUt to TCR beta-chain rearrangements was assessed by quantitating expression of the V beta 8 family of TCR V region genes. Although some clones expressed a significantly higher or lower percentage of V beta 8+ cells, these differences were not stable with time. Thus, CFUt do not undergo absolute commitment to cell surface phenotype of TCR rearrangement, as reflected by the phenotypes of their progeny. Clones of mature peripheral progeny of CFUt could be expanded in culture in the presence of mitogen and growth factors; approximately 30 to 50% of proliferating clones could mediate cytotoxicity in a lectin-dependent assay, further indicating that CFUt are not absolutely committed to a particular T cell function.\r"

Based on these criteria we demonstrate that Thy-1+ EC in nude mice are predominantly round and angular and located in follicular epithelium, as compared to predominantly dendritic, interfollicular Thy-1+ EC found in normal CBA or BALB/c mice. Functionally, Thy-1+ EC from normal mice proliferate and elaborate IL-2 in response to stimulation by Con A; by contrast, nude Thy-1+ EC fail to proliferate or secrete IL-2 in response to Con A. Nude Thy-1+ EC proliferate markedly in response to low-dose IL-2 alone; Thy-1+ EC from normal mice give only modest proliferative responses to IL-2. Both populations of cells proliferate and elaborate IL-2 in response to PMA and calcium ionophore. Short-term cultured Thy-1+ EC from nude mice resemble Thy-1+ EC from normal animals in that they express no detectable functional TCR-alpha and beta-RNA. Normal Thy-1+ EC express abundant levels of functional RNA for TCR-gamma and delta-chains and for the CD3 delta-chain, whereas nude Thy-1+ EC produce no detectable TCR-delta and no CD3 delta-RNA and only truncated, presumably germ-line TCR-gamma transcripts, as suggested by lack of hybridization with gamma-V region probes and by lack of detectable rearrangements in the gamma-genes. These phenotypic, functional, and genotypic characteristics of Thy-1+ EC from nude mice suggest that these cells are at a very early stage of T cell differentiation.\r"

  ".W": "The T cell Ag receptor (CD3/Ti) and the sheep E receptor (CD2) expressed on the surface of human T cells are both capable of initiating intracellular signals necessary for T cell activation. CD3/Ti interacts with Ag to initiate cellular immune responses. Although the exact function of CD2 is unknown, lymphocyte function-associated Ag 3 (LFA-3), a 55- to 70-kDa receptor expressed on a broad spectrum of hemopoietic and nonhemopoietic cells, has recently been shown to be its natural ligand. We show here that although purified multimeric LFA-3 is not capable of initiating transmembrane signaling events on its own, the combination of LFA-3 and the anti-CD2 mAb CD2.1 induces intracellular calcium increases, phosphatidylinositol second messenger generation and lymphokine secretion in the T cell leukemic line Jurkat. In order to study the signaling requirements of CD2, we compared the ability of CD2 mAb and LFA-3 to initiate activation signals in Jurkat and in three Jurkat-derived mutants. A CD3-CD2+ mutant failed to increase calcium or exhibit phosphatidylinositol hydrolysis to either the combination of agonist CD2 mAb 9-1 and 9.6 or LFA-3 and CD2.1. Reconstitution of the Ag receptor by transfection of the Ti-beta-chain restored the expression of the CD3/Ti complex and the ability to respond to either combination of CD2 ligands. However, no response to CD2 ligands was detected in a CD3+CD2+ mutant selected for signaling defects to CD3/Ti ligands. Complementation of the CD3/Ti signaling defect by cell fusion also restored competency to respond to CD2 agonists. These results demonstrate that LFA-3 under appropriate conditions can activate T cells via the CD2 complex and that this activation requires not only the cell surface expression of the CD3/Ti complex but also a functional Ag receptor pathway.\r"

A mAb to this molecule did not influence B cell proliferation induced by anti-mu antibody and IL. In contrast, the same mAb inhibited the specific T-dependent B cell response induced by a particulate Ag. In the same line, two anti-CD2 mAb (directed toward the T11-1 and T11-2 epitopes) inhibited this response, whether used alone or in association. These inhibitions took place at an early stage of the response, and anti-LFA3 and anti-CD2 mAb acted on B cells and T cells, respectively. In contrast, when T cell help was provided by exogenous IL-2, the B cell response was resistant to the inhibitory effect of anti-LFA3 mAb. Taken together, these results indicate that the LFA3-CD2 pair play a major role in the direct T-B interaction required for T cell help.\r"

All other cell types observed in these tissues were unreactive. Immunofluorescence staining of endothelial cells isolated from umbilical cord vein and grown in culture confirmed that mAb 44G4 recognized a surface membrane component of vascular endothelium. Granulocytes, monocytes, B and T lymphocytes, and T lymphocytes cultured in the presence of PHA for 72 h did not express the 44G4 Ag. mAb 44G4 reacted weakly with leukemic cells from 28 of 41 patients with non-T cell acute lymphocytic leukemia and 4 of 7 patients with acute myelocytic leukemia, whereas 8 of 10 cases of T cell acute lymphocytic leukemia were negative. Moderate reactivity with leukemic cell lines of pre-B and myelomonocytic origin was also observed. The level of 44G4 Ag on umbilical endothelial cells was three to five times that of leukemic cell lines and 25 times the average levels observed on leukemic cells isolated from patients. Immunoprecipitation of lysates prepared from surface-iodinated endothelial cells and the immunizing pre-B leukemic cell line revealed that the 44G4 Ag from both cell types was composed of two subunits of apparent m.w. 95,000 linked by disulfide bond(s). Comparison of the cellular localization and subunit structure of 44G4 to that of known Ag suggests that it represents a previously undescribed marker of endothelial cells.\r"

Its level of expression on the pre-B leukemic HOON cell line used for derivation of the corresponding mAb is intermediate but sufficient to permit the purification of the Ag. The molecule isolated by immunoaffinity from HOON is a glycoprotein since it bound to Ricinus communis agglutinin, wheat germ agglutinin, and peanut agglutinin lectins. The Ag was purified 2400-fold from a soluble taurocholate extract of HOON cells by affinity to wheat germ agglutinin-agarose and 44G4-IgG-Sepharose. The purified glycoprotein is likely a homodimer as it migrated on SDS-PAGE with an apparent m.w. of 170,000, nonreduced, and 95,000, reduced. Removal of N-linked oligosaccharides by endoglycosidase F led to a decrease in m.w. of 25,000; if neuraminidase and O-glycanase were also present, the total decrease in m.w. was 33,000 suggesting a polypeptide chain of 62,000 and 8,000 in O-linked substitutions. The glycoprotein digested with N-glycanase, neuraminidase, or O-glycanase could still be immunoprecipitated with the 44G4 mAb indicating that the antigenic epitope resides in the polypeptide. By Western blot analysis, the dissociated but nonreduced protein was reactive with 44G4, whereas the reduced and alkylated protein was not. Therefore, the epitope is dependent on the presence of intact disulfide bond(s). Sequential immunoprecipitation with OKT9 and 44G4 antibodies indicated that these epitopes are present on two distinct molecules and that 44G4 is distinct from the transferrin receptor despite a similar subunit structure.\r"

These memory cells were converted to active specific killer cells by stimulation with mytomycin C (MMC)-treated HTLV-1 infected autologous cells in vitro. Target blocking by anti-HTLV-1-related Ag suggested that the target molecules recognized by the specific killer cells may be virus envelope glycoprotein gp 68 and other cellular Ag induced by HTLV-1 infection. In addition to the specific killer cells, NK cells that could kill not only NK-sensitive target cells but also target lymphoid cells with HTLV-1 Ag on their surface, were found in these monkeys. In vitro stimulation caused enhancement of NK cell activity as well as induction of antigen specific killer cells. These findings suggest that Ag-specific killer cells may work together with NK cells to eliminate HTLV-1-bearing T cells in vivo.\r"

  ".W": "Our experiments have addressed regulation of B lymphocyte formation by bone marrow stromal cells. Stromal cells appear to produce a regulatory factor that acts at the pre-B cell stage to induce the expression of Ig L chains and surface Ig. Bone marrow stromal cell conditioned medium was found to contain this factor and the active component was partially purified by HPLC. This stromal cell-derived factor had a m.w. between 16,000 and 20,000, was specifically neutralized by anti-IL-4 mAb, 11B11, and enhanced the proliferation of anti-mu-stimulated B cells. We also found that rIL-4 induced B cell formation in culture. In our studies, IL-1 had no direct effect on pre-B cell maturation, however, IL-1 was found to stimulate the production of IL-4 by both heterogeneous bone marrow stromal cells and a cloned stromal cell line, SCL-160. These effects of IL-1 on factor production by stromal cells were duplicated by the addition of bone marrow-derived macrophages to SCL-160 cells. We conclude that stromal cell-derived IL-4 is a physiologic stimulator for B cell generation. In addition, macrophages appear to play a role in B cell formation by regulating the production of IL-4 by stromal cells via the secretion of IL-1.\r"

  ".W": "Recent studies have shown that purified IL-5 from T cell lines and clones enhances IgA synthesis in LPS-triggered splenic B cell cultures, and that this effect is augmented by IL-4. In this study we have examined the ability of rIL-5 and rIL-4 to support spontaneous Ig synthesis in normal Peyer's patch (PP) B cell cultures. The rIL-4 supported proliferation of the HT-2 and in vivo adapted BCL-1 cell lines, increased Ia expression on normal spleen B cells, co-stimulated splenic B cell proliferation in the presence of anti-mu and enhanced IgG1 synthesis in LPS triggered splenic B cell cultures. The rIL-5 supported BCL-1 proliferation, co-stimulated splenic B cell proliferation in the presence of dextran sulfate, and increased IgA synthesis in LPS-stimulated splenic B cell cultures. Markedly enhanced IgA responses occurred in PP B cell, but not splenic B cell cultures supplemented with rIL-5 in the absence of an added B cell trigger. However, rIL-4 alone did not enhance IgA synthesis or increase the IgA synthesis of PP B cell cultures stimulated with rIL-5. The rIL-5 receptive PP B cells were present in the blast cell subpopulation, inasmuch as a low density fraction isolated on Percoll gradients accounted for the enhanced IgA synthesis. Further, cell cycle analysis of whole PP B cells using propidium iodide in conjunction with staining for surface B220, demonstrated that approximately 12 to 16% of the B cells were in the S and G2/M stages of cell cycle, the remainder being in Go + G1. The surface IgM+ B cells were predominantly in Go + G1, whereas the sIgA+ B cell subpopulation was enriched for cells in the S and G2/M compartments. The PP B cell subset responsible for enhanced IgA synthesis in the presence of rIL-5 was sIgA-positive because FACS-depletion of the sIgA+ B cells resulted in the total loss of rIL-5 enhanced IgA synthesis. Further, when PP B cells were enriched for sIgA+ B cells by cell sorting, these cells responded to rIL-5 with increased IgA synthesis in a dose-dependent manner. When the actual numbers of IgA secreting cells were assessed in PP B cell cultures with supplemental rIL-5, no significant increase in total IgA-producing cells was noted when compared with B cells cultured without rIL-5.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "IL-5 has been shown to specifically enhance IgA secretion in LPS-stimulated splenic B cell cultures. Maximum enhancement of IgA in such cultures, however, requires IL-4 in addition to IL-5. Because the Peyer's patches (PP), compared with spleen and lymph nodes, are enriched for precursors of IgA-secreting cells, we tested whether IL-4 and IL-5 would have a more profound effect on IgA secretion by polyclonally stimulated PP cells than spleen cells. The combination of IL-4 and IL-5 causes a comparable enhancement of IgA secretion in both LPS-stimulated PP and splenic B cell cultures. The majority of IgA secreted in LPS-stimulated PP cell cultures is derived from the sIgA- population. Furthermore, the binding high level of peanut agglutinin, germinal center subpopulation of PP cells is essentially nonresponsive to LPS, even in the presence of lymphokines; the majority of secreted IgA in these cultures is derived from the binding low level of peanut agglutinin population. In contrast to LPS-stimulated cultures, PP B cells secrete considerably more IgA than splenic B cells when polyclonally stimulated by a clone of autoreactive T cells in the presence of IL-4 and IL-5. The majority of IgA made by T cell-stimulated PP cell cultures is derived from the sIgA+ population. In these cultures, sIgA- PP cells and spleen cells secrete comparable levels of IgA and other non-IgM isotypes suggesting that sIgA- PP B cells are similar to splenic B cells in their potential to switch to IgA. In T cell-stimulated cultures the majority of IgA as well as of all other isotypes is also derived from the nongerminal center, binding low level of peanut agglutinin population.\r"

  ".W": "Although four murine C gamma gene segments (C gamma 1, 2, 3, and 4) are known to exist, the large majority of expressed gamma-chains have been shown to be of the C gamma 1 isotype and no evidence exists for the expression of more than one receptor by gamma delta TCR-bearing cells. We investigated the nature of the TCR expressed on a number of murine dendritic epidermal T cell-derived cell lines by using both Northern blot and immunoprecipitation analyses. One of these CD3+ cell lines (T195) expresses C gamma 4, V gamma 1, and delta mRNA, and its CD3-associated TCR complex can be precipitated by both anti-C gamma 4 and anti-delta sera, indicating that this receptor is a C gamma 4/delta heterodimer. Furthermore, we show that two cell lines (Y245, Y93) express two distinct TCR gamma-chains, one derived from the C gamma 4 locus, whereas the second gamma-chain is probably derived from the C gamma 2 locus. Together with the previous demonstration of C gamma 1/delta TCR on a number of dendritic epidermal T cell lines (DETC), these results indicate that such DETC are capable of expressing a variety of gamma delta TCR and that, in some DETC, isotype exclusion of gamma-chain expression does not occur.\r"

  ".W": "BALB/cJ mice, which are homozygous for Lshs on chromosone 1, are genetically susceptible to Leishmania donovani (S3), but spontaneously reduce their parasite burdens late in the course of infection. Spleens from chronically infected mice (5 to 8 mo) were found to have T cells that responded to leishmanial Ag by proliferating and secreting immune IFN. An IFN-secreting T cell line derived from the spleen of a chronically infected mouse, after boosting with leishmanial Ag and treatment with Pentostam to kill residual parasites, was able to activate macrophages to kill amastigotes in vitro. Furthermore, after adoptive transfer of this cell line, naive BALB/cJ mice challenged with amastigotes demonstrated a 42-fold reduction in parasite burden compared to controls. Four of five clones derived from the protective T cell line secreted IFN and proliferated between days 7 and 14 after Ag stimulation. All clones were Ly1+2-, L3T4+. Another T cell line, which had Ly1+2-, L3T4+ phenotype, was derived from the lymph nodes of s.c. immunized, uninfected mice. It multipled but never produced IFN in response to leishmanial Ag and failed to protect macrophages against L. donovani infection in vitro or in vivo. This nonprotective T cell line and the fifth clone from the protective line, which also did not secrete IFN, proliferated between days 2 and 7 after Ag stimulation. In summary, leishmania-responsive helper/inducer T cells, which produced IFN but were slow to proliferate in response to Ag in vitro and which were able to activate macrophages to reduce amastigotes in vitro and in vivo, are present in chronically infected BALB/cJ mice and may mediate the decrease in parasite burden during chronic infection.\r"

At a concentration of 200 U/ml, an IgE response was observed in 11/26 cultures of PBMC from normal donors and in 12/15 cultures from allergic individuals. The same rIL-4-stimulated cells released significant amounts of IgE-binding factors (IgE-BF) in their culture supernatant. These IgE-BF were shown for the first time to bind simultaneously to some mAb against Fc epsilon R II (mAbER) and to soluble IgE. The lack of correlation between the rIL-4-induced secretion of IgE-BF and IgE indicates that the production of IgE-BF or the expression of Fc epsilon R II is not the only factor involved in the induction of IgE synthesis by rIL-4. However, the observation that mAbER suppressed the rIL-4-induced IgE synthesis strongly suggests that either Fc epsilon R II or IgE-BF are necessary for an IgE response. Finally, the spontaneous in vitro synthesis of IgE by enriched B cell preparations isolated from atopic donors was suppressed in an isotype-specific manner by the same mAbER or by their F(ab')2 fragments. These observations suggest that the ongoing IgE synthesis by in vivo pre-activated B cells is also regulated by IgE-BF or Fc epsilon R II. It is concluded that Fc epsilon R II or IgE-BF play an essential role both in the induction of IgE synthesis by normal B cells and in the ongoing IgE synthesis by in vivo activated B cells from allergic donors.\r"

The TCR1+ cells (gamma delta TCR homologue) are localized preferentially in the splenic sinusoids and the intestinal epithelium, where most of them express the CD8 homologue. The TCR2+ cells (alpha beta TCR homologue), a majority of which express the CD4 homologue, are found primarily in the splenic periarteriolar sheath and the lamina propria of the intestine. The frequency and distribution of the two classes of T cells in the thymus is also unique. The different tissue homing patterns of the TCR1 and TCR2 cells suggest that they represent separate lineages of T cells with distinctive physiologic roles.\r"

Previous studies have shown that adult CD8+ T cells actively suppress this autoimmune response and adult spleen cells depleted of CD8+ cells can generate an anti-MRBC response in culture with MRBC. The present results demonstrate that T cells from mice less than 1 wk of age do not suppress the in vitro anti-MRBC response of adult spleen cell populations depleted of CD8+ Ts cells. By 2 wk of age Ts cells are detectable in this anti-self response and reach adult levels by 3 wk of age. Non-specific \"natural suppressor\" cells normally present in neonatal spleen cell populations are unable to suppress this autoantibody response, although they are active in suppressing anti-SRBC responses in the same cultures. Before the appearance of Ts cells active in the anti-MRBC response, neonatal spleen cell populations can generate anti-MRBC antibody-forming cells, both spontaneously in vivo and in vitro. The in vitro anti-MRBC response of neonatal spleen cells was shown to be Ag driven and Ag specific. The ability of unfractionated spleen cells to generate this response in vitro declines with age and is relatively low by 3 wk. This decline in responsiveness occurs simultaneously with the appearance of suppression specific for the anti-MRBC response, suggesting that the two events may be causally related.\r"

This concept has placed certain limitations on possible mechanisms of lysis by CTL. Recently, we found in studies with cloned CTL as targets that cloned CTL are in fact highly resistant to lysis by other CTL, as well as to their cytotoxic granule proteins. We show here that although cloned CTL are extremely resistant to lysis by primary and cloned CTL, they are readily inactivated functionally by all primary CTL and by at least one CTL clone. Moreover, cloned CTL are also functionally inactivated by cytotoxic granule proteins. The activation of CTL, which we call inhibitin, is Ca2+ insensitive and distinct from hemolytic activity, and is, thus, unlikely to be perforin. These experiments suggest a possible alternative interpretation of the original polarity of lysis experiments.\r"

Several immunologic approaches were used to determine the phenotype of complexed cells. Bound T cells were 97% double-positive (CD4 and CD8), 3% double-negative and greater than 99% CD3 positive by using immunoperoxidase immunohistology on cytospins. Five percent expressed the TCR beta-chain and 1 to 2% were IL-2R positive. The percentages were the same whether complexes were preformed in vivo or formed in vitro. Despite the apparent absence of single positive cells in complexes, when isolated CD4 or CD8 positive cells were tested for their ability to bind to adherent thymic macrophages, each subpopulation contained some cells which were capable of complex formation. When thymocytes were fractionated by density, steroid sensitivity or peanut agglutinin positivity then allowed to form complexes, cells with an immature phenotype had a greater propensity for complex formation. Central stromal cells all were class II MHC gene product (I-A and I-E) positive, expressed macrophage-associated Ag (B23.1 and MAC-1), were negative for cytokeratin but positive for vimentin, were reactive with a polyclonal antimacrophage serum, but did not express dendritic cell Ag (33D1). The data demonstrate that immature thymocytes bind exclusively to class II MHC gene product positive thymic macrophages. This binding step may play a role in the acquisition of T cell function in the thymus.\r"

  ".W": "Thymocytes from C57BL/6 mice were highly purified to obtain the CD 4-, CD 8- subpopulation which constitutes only 5% of all thymocytes. Substantial proliferation was induced in vitro with either IL-1 + IL-2 or with IL-4 in the presence of PMA. IL-1 and IL-2 synergized in inducing proliferation of these purified CD 4-, CD 8- thymocytes whereas neither synergized with IL-4. In order to determine whether stimulation with IL-1 + IL-2 acted via IL-4 or vice versa, cultures were treated reciprocally with affinity-purified anti-IL-2 or anti-IL-4 antibodies. Cultures with IL-4 were inhibited by anti-IL-4 but were unaffected by anti-IL-2. The CD 4-, CD 8- thymocytes cultured with IL-1 + IL-2 + anti-IL-2 were inhibited to baseline IL-1 stimulation. At low concentrations of IL-1 (1 U/ml) and IL-2 (100 U/ml), anti-IL-4 had no effect, whereas at higher levels of IL-1 (2 U/ml IL-1), and 100 or 200 U/ml IL-2, anti-IL-4 significantly reduced DNA synthesis. This result suggests that at higher concentrations the combination of IL-1 + IL-2 can induce cells to produce IL-4 which then contributes to overall proliferation. When CD 4-, CD 8- thymocytes were cultured with the low doses of IL-1 + IL-2 for 72 h, 62% expressed cell surface T3 complex (vs 11% at initiation) and 27% were F23.1+ (vs 5% at initiation). In contrast, culture with IL-4 led to no increase in numbers of T3+ cells and none were F23.1+; however, there was coexpression of Thy1 and 6B2 on 20% of cells at the end of culture (vs 4% at initiation). Thus, IL-1 + IL-2 causes expansion of a CD 4-, CD 8- thymocyte population expressing the alpha, beta-T cell receptor, whereas IL-4 induces cells to express a phenotype present in small numbers in the periphery of normal mice and in larger numbers in mice bearing the lpr gene.\r"

DAF is one of the first phosphatidylinositol-linked molecules to be described on human T cells. The current studies demonstrate that low levels of DAF are expressed on a majority of freshly isolated human T cells and that DAF expression rapidly increases after T cell activation by mitogens. Moreover, antibodies to DAF induce T cell proliferation when the cells are co-stimulated with phorbol esters. The induction of proliferation is facilitated when the antibodies to DAF cross-linked with a secondary antibody. T cell mitogenesis is largely dependent on the phosphatidylinositol-linked form of DAF, because removal of DAF by a phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C eliminates anti-DAF-induced T cell proliferation. These studies suggest that DAF on the surface of T cells may not only serve to afford protection from autologous C but may also function to transmit signals that induce T cell activation.\r"

The mAb CR10-215, W6/32, and 6/31 to distinct monomorphic determinants of HLA class I antigens enhanced CD2-induced T cell proliferation in at most 30% of the PBMC preparations tested. The anti human beta 2-microglobulin (beta 2-mu) mAb NAMB-1 displayed no detectable effect on the proliferation of T cells stimulated with the mAb 9-1 + 9.6. The enhancing effect of anti-HLA class I mAb is specific, is dose dependent, is not abrogated by the addition of exogenous IL-1 and IL-2 to the cultures, and reflects the interaction of anti-HLA class I mAb with T cells. Enhancement of CD2 mediated proliferation of T cells is not a unique property of anti-HLA class I mAb, since the anti-HLA class II mAb Q5/6 and Q5/13 also had a similar effect. Analysis of the kinetics of the enhancing effect of anti-HLA class I mAb suggests that they modulate an early event of T cell activation and may affect the interaction of T cells with mAb 9-1. Phenotyping of T lymphocytes activated by mAb 9-1 + 9.6 in the presence of anti-HLA class I mAb suggests that the enhancing effect of anti-HLA class I mAb may reflect the recruitment of a higher percentage of T cells. The present study has shown for the first time that certain, but not all, the determinants of the HLA class I molecular complex are involved in the proliferation of T cells stimulated with the anti-CD2 mAb 9-1 + 9.6. Furthermore, the inhibitory effect of mAb CR11-351, KS1, Q6/64, and W6/32 on the proliferation of T cells stimulated with mAb OKT3 or with mAb BMA 031 indicates that the same determinants of HLA class I antigens play a differential regulatory role in T cell proliferation induced via the CD2 and CD3 pathway.\r"

Both peptide Ag are recognized in the context of Kd. We show herein that these unrelated, nonhomologous peptides clearly compete reciprocally for recognition by the appropriate Kd restricted CTL. In contrast, different NP peptides that are recognized by other CTL restricted by HLA-B37, H-2-Db or KK, either failed to compete or were much less efficient as competitors than NP peptides recognized in the context of Kd. The efficiency of a peptide as a competitor correlated with its potency as an Ag. The most efficient competitor was a variant peptide of NP 147-158 with R156 deleted, which had been previously shown to be 1,000 times more efficient as an Ag than its natural homolog. Our results suggest that peptides recognized by CTL in the context of the same MHC class I restriction element may bind to the same or interdependent site(s) on the restriction molecule.\r"

  ".W": "We have shown previously that pneumococcal polysaccharides behave as human T cell-independent type 2 Ag. When cultured in vitro with type 4 pneumococcal polysaccharides (PS4), human neonatal B cells do not or only marginally respond. Limiting dilution analysis of neonatal B cells polyclonally activated by a combination of phorbol esters, calcium ionophore, and T cells and T cell factors, however, showed that Ag-reactive B cells are present in cord blood. The frequency of anti-PS4 reactive B cells in cord blood is comparable with that of adult peripheral blood. In order to obtain more insight into the activation requirements of these PS4-reactive neonatal B cells, 8-mercaptoguanosine (8MGuo) was added to in vitro cultures. Addition of 0.5 to 1.0 mM 8MGuo resulted in a 3- to 10-fold amplification of the anti-PS4 response. the effect of 8 MGuo was most prominent when added 3 days after initiation of the culture. Based on kinetic studies, we propose that in vitro activated cells are target for 8MGuo. These data further indicate that neonatal unresponsiveness to polysaccharide Ag is not due to the physical absence of Ag-reactive B cells but more likely to be the consequence of different activation requirements as compared with adult B cells.\r"

  ".U": "89009734\r", 
  ".W": "PC-1 is an alloantigen of murine plasma cells. Its close association with secretory function in lymphoid cells previously raised the question of whether PC-1 was part of the secretory apparatus. In addition to its expression on lymphocytes, PC-1 had been known to be present in liver, brain, and kidney, although the data were derived almost entirely from bulk absorption studies of polyclonal alloantisera, and virtually nothing was known about the nature of the cells expressing PC-1 in these organs. If PC-1 was functionally involved in the secretory process. it might be expected to be present at secretory sites within these and other organs. We now report the results of an immunohistochemical survey of the distribution of PC-1 in a variety of non-lymphoid organs, using a mAb. The PC-1 Ag was found in a small number of highly discrete locations that were mostly, but not exclusively, associated with epithelia. Sites of strong expression included the distal convoluted tubule of the kidney, ducts of the salivary glands, epididymis, proximal part of the vas deferens, and chondrocytes. The PC-1 glycoprotein was also found in the capillaries of the brain, but did not appear to be present in capillaries elsewhere, a pattern that is strikingly similar to that of the receptor for the iron transport protein, transferrin. Negative sites included the thyroid, pancreas, choroid plexus, smooth and striated muscle, stomach, small and large intestine, gall bladder, renal glomeruli, testis, and seminal vesicles. These results are not consistent with a generalized role for PC-1 in secretion, but are compatible with a role in a specialized subset of macromolecular transport events.\r"

Although neither IL-4 nor IL-2 alone were able to overcome the CsA-mediated suppression, the addition of IL-4 in the presence of IL-2 restored in a dose-dependent manner the induction of cytolytic activity. On the other hand, CsA greatly impaired proliferative responses of alloantigen-reactive CD8 T cells, thereby operationally dissecting proliferative responsiveness from acquisition of cytolytic activity during primary activation of alloantigen-reactive CD8+ T cells. The existence of a CsA-resistant induction pathway for Ag-specific CD8+ T cell-mediated cytolytic activity may be of relevance for experimental and clinical organ transplantation.\r"

  ".W": "Antibodies of the IgE isotype play a predominant role in immediate hypersensitivity reactions. IL-4, a T cell-derived lymphokine that stimulates increased Ia expression by resting B cells and increased IgG1 secretion by LPS-activated B cells in vitro, has also been shown to regulate in vitro and in vivo polyclonal IgE responses. We report that large quantities of a purified anti-IL-4 mAb inhibit primary in vivo polyclonal IgE responses by 99% in mice infected with Nippostrongylus brasiliensis or injected with anti-IgD antibodies, and totally inhibit secondary Ag-specific IgE responses to TNP-keyhole limpet hemocyanin without effect on either IgG1 or IgG2a responses to these stimuli. The lack of effect of anti-IL-4 antibody on IgG1 secretion cannot be explained simply by inadequate neutralization of IL-4, inasmuch as the doses of anti-IL-4 antibody used blocked an N. brasiliensis-induced increase in B cell Ia expression by more than 85%, whereas in vitro studies indicate that enhancement of B cell Ia expression requires less IL-4 than induction of IgG1 secretion. In addition to demonstrating that IL-4 plays a necessary role in the generation of an in vivo IgE response, we show that IL-4 has an important role in sustaining established IgE responses, because anti-IL-4 antibody, when given at the peak of an N. brasiliensis- or TNP-keyhole limpet hemocyanin-induced IgE response, accelerates the declines in total serum IgE and in IgE anti-TNP antibody levels, respectively. These observations suggest that the effects of IL-4 on in vivo immune responses may be more specific than might have been predicted from in vitro observations, and that regulation of IL-4 production or action may be useful for the prevention or therapy of immediate hypersensitivity disorders.\r"

Although rIL-4 had no effect on the cytotoxic activity of resting NK cells, it was capable of inhibiting in a concentration-dependent manner the rIL-2-induced cytolytic activation of NK cells against NK cell-resistant tumor cell targets. rIL-4 acted directly on NK cells and did not require accessory cells. rIL-4-induced inhibition of NK cell activation was specific for rIL-2 in that activation of NK cell cytolysis by IFN-alpha was not affected. These results represent the first direct evidence that rIL-2 and IFN-alpha activate NK cells by different pathways. rIL-4 also effectively blocked the rIL-2-dependent proliferation of NK cells. The results presented in this study clearly demonstrate that rIL-4 is a potent regulator of IL-2-dependent mechanisms of NK cell activation and proliferation and thus may play an important physiologic role in vivo.\r"

Analysis of cellular mechanisms involved in the formation of Ig-BF by antigenic stimulation revealed that Ag-primed Th cells released lymphokines upon antigenic stimulation, and that the lymphokine(s) in turn stimulates unprimed T cells to form Ig-BF. Normal unprimed lymphocytes formed IgD-BF upon incubation with culture supernatants of Ag-stimulated spleen cells. The formation of IgD-BF induced by the culture supernatant was prevented by anti-IL-4 mAb (11B11). It was also found that 0.3 to 10 U/ml mouse rIL-4, but none of the rIL-1, IL-2, and IFN-gamma, induced normal T cells to form IgD-BF. Indeed, both IL-2 and IFN-gamma inhibited IL-4 to induce the formation of IgD-BF. In contrast, 10 to 50 U/ml of IFN-gamma induced the formation of IgE-BF, and 50 to 200 U/ml IFN-gamma induced the formation of IgG-BF. However, none of the other lymphokines tested, i.e., IL-1, IL-2, and IL-4, induced the formation of either IgE-BF or IgG-BF. The IgD-BF formed by antigenic stimulation of keyhole limpet hemocyanin-primed spleen cells and those formed by stimulation of normal lymphocytes with 1 to 2 U/ml IL-4 enhanced both IgM and IgG1 plaque-forming cell responses of SRBC-primed spleen cells to homologous Ag. In contrast, 1 to 2 U/ml of IL-4, which could induce the formation of IgD-BF, failed to affect the PFC responses. It appears that the formation of IgD-BF may be involved in the effects of IL-4 to enhance the antibody response.\r"

  ".W": "Previous studies have shown that the low affinity receptor for IgE (Fc epsilon R II) on human B lymphocytes was comprised of three components with apparent Mr of 45, 65 to 95, and 37 kDa. The present results indicate that the 37-kDa component is a soluble degradation fragment of the 45-kDa component and they also suggest that the 65- to 95-kDa component is probably made of aggregates of the above components that are formed after solubilization of the cells. The 45-kDa component appears to be a glycoprotein containing several sialic acid residues, O-linked carbohydrates and one N-linked carbohydrate chain that is of the complex type. Partial digestion of the purified 65- to 95-, 45-, and 37-kDa molecules with alpha-chymotrypsin or protease V8 generates several fragments with identical mobility on SDS-PAGE. The 37 kDa is not N-glycosylated but like the IgE-binding factors present in the culture supernatant of Fc epsilon R-bearing cells, it contains sialic acid and O-linked carbohydrates. On incubation with protease inhibitors, the Mr of IgE-binding factors (BF) is shifted from 25-27 to 37 kDa, indicating that IgE-BF are derived from the proteolytic cleavage of the 37-kDa molecule, previously identified as a membrane component of Fc epsilon R. On incubation with N-glycosylation inhibitors, the production of IgE-BF is significantly increased indicating that N-glycosylation inhibits the degradation of Fc epsilon R into IgE-BF. Inasmuch as the effect of glycosylation inhibitors is not prevented by monensin, it is concluded that all the IgE-BF are derived from surface Fc epsilon R and not from their intracellular precursors.\r"

Two different, dose-dependent effects were observed: low PGE2 concentrations (0.1 to 10 ng/ml) stimulated, whereas higher concentrations (greater than 10 ng/ml) suppressed TNF-alpha release. PGE2-stimulated TNF-alpha production was dependent on de novo protein synthesis and was associated with an intracellular rise of cGMP. The importance of cGMP as an intracellular messenger for PGE2 was confirmed by the following evidence: (1) low PGE2 concentrations preferentially increased cGMP and not cAMP and (2) cGMP, either exogenously added or endogenously generated by sodium nitroprusside, were efficient stimulators of TNF-alpha production. In contrast, agents increasing intracellular cAMP concentrations such as PGE1, higher PGE2 doses, isoproterenol, and theophylline, all suppressed TNF-alpha synthesis. Only resident, but not casein-elicited or Corynebacterium parvum-activated macrophages, were stimulated by low PGE2 concentrations to increase TNF-alpha production. In tumor cytotoxicity assays, PGE2-activated macrophages were active only against TNF-alpha-sensitive target cells. These findings demonstrate that TNF-alpha synthesis in macrophages is up-regulated by cGMP and down-regulated by cAMP, which indicates that cyclic nucleotides act as intracellular messengers for extracellular signals of macrophage activation.\r"

  ".U": "89009747\r", 
  ".W": "Lymphokine-like activity and selective stimulation of B cell growth is exerted by a group of synthetic ribonucleosides derivatized at C8 and exemplified by 8-bromoguanosine (8BrGuo), 8-mercaptoguanosine, and 7-methyl 8-oxoguanosine. However, relatively little is known about their molecular mechanism of action. Like naturally occurring nucleosides, 8BrGuo is taken up into lymphocytes by a process of facilitated diffusion. Naturally occurring nucleosides are then reclaimed by a well characterized salvage pathway, involving sequential phosphorolysis and phosphoribosylation. The studies reported in this communication demonstrate that, in contrast to naturally occurring nucleosides, 8BrGuo is not a substrate for salvage by purine nucleoside phosphorylase. The base that would be produced by putative phosphorolysis, 8-bromoguanine, is biologically inactive and is not a substrate for hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyl-transferase. Accordingly, inhibitors of purine nucleoside phosphorylase-mediated salvage fail to inhibit nucleoside-induced immunostimulation selectively. Examination of the metabolism of 8BrGuo provides no direct evidence that 8BrGuo is phosphorylated by B lymphocytes. Direct enzymatic phosphorylation does not seem to be essential to the mechanism of action of the nucleoside insofar as competitive inhibition of deoxycytidine kinase (an enzyme that directly phosphorylates purines as well as pyrimidines) or of deoxyguanosine kinase fails to inhibit 8BrGuo stimulation selectively. Moreover, studies with synthetic nucleosides in which 3' and/or 5' hydroxyl groups were irreversibly blocked, precluding their phosphorylation, demonstrated that immunobiologic activity can occur in the absence of 3' and/or 5' phosphorylation. Finally, experiments with radiolabeled nucleosides provide no evidence to support the hypothesis that they are incorporated into cellular nucleic acid. These data, together with previous studies, suggest that it is the unmetabolized nucleoside that is active and, as such, is most likely to act in a regulatory capacity.\r"

The Ag-specific reorientation of cytoplasmic granules occurred well after [Ca2+]i had begun to decline to a resting level, but was dependent on extracellular Ca2+. These studies indicate that the Ag-stimulated increase in [Ca2+]i exhibits considerable spatial and temporal variation, and that these characteristics are altered by the availability of extracellular Ca2+.

The latter reached a plateau of 2.5 micrograms/1 x 10(6) cells after 11 days in culture, compared with 100 ng/1 x 10(6) for untreated BMMC. Steroids, such as beta-estradiol, androsterone, and testosterone (1 microM), did not alter the histamine content of BMMC, whereas progesterone (1 microM) induced a moderate increase. Other glucocorticosteroids also enhanced histamine content, suggesting that the observed increase was specific for glucocorticosteroid. Treatment of BMMC with 1 microM DM for 14 days inhibited the Ag-induced, IgE-mediated release of histamine, beta-hexosaminidase, platelet-activating factor-acether, LTB4, and LTC4 by 65 +/- 3%, 66 +/- 1%, 93 +/- 3%, 66 +/- 2%, and 74 +/- 10%, respectively (mean +/- 1 SD, n = 3). In contrast with untreated cells which produce less than 2 ng/1 x 10(6) cells PGD2 after Ag challenge, DM-treated BMMC generated 16.8 +/- 0.3 ng/1 x 10(6) cells PGD2. Moreover, most of DM-treated BMMC became Alcian blue+/safranin+ and by ultrastructure, exhibited numerous cytoplasmic granules filled with abundant and uniform electron-dense matrix. The present results indicate that DM-treated BMMC exhibit biochemical and functional properties different from immature untreated cells, suggesting that a maturation-like process occurred in vitro during DM treatment.\r"

After in vitro stimulation of PBMC from infected and control animals with HIV-1 Ag, DNA synthesis, IL-2R expression and IL-2 release were assayed. Cells from infected gibbon apes demonstrated a group-specific response toward whole virus preparations from three divergent HIV-1 isolates (HTLV-IIIB, HTLV-IIIRF, HTLV-IIIMN). Consistent responses were also detected against purified HIV-1 Ag, i.e., native gp120 envelope glycoprotein, recombinant gp160 glycoprotein, a synthetic peptide (peptide 7) representing a highly conserved region of gp120, and purified native core protein p24. In addition, lymphocytes from infected gibbon apes displayed a specific, MHC-restricted, cytotoxic activity against autologous cells expressing HIV-1 envelope or gag proteins. The specific T cell reactivity toward HIV-1 proteins observed in infected gibbons contrasts with findings in HIV-1 infected humans, and may help to explain the apparent discrepancy in the natural history of the infection between the two species.\r"

These genes have each been modified in the last two-thirds of the third exon such that one or several HLA-A2-specific substitutions have been made in the HLA-A3 gene and vice versa. The recombinant genes were transfected into the murine cell line P815 and the transfectants were used as targets for a series of 20 human CTL lines or clones specific for HLA-A2 or HLA-A3, or restricted by HLA-A2 and specific for influenza A. Several patterns of anti-HLA-A2, anti-HLA-A3, and HLA-A2-restricted anti-influenza CTL activity were observed and when uncloned cell lines were studied, a progressive selection of some clones with a similar pattern of activity was regularly found. From the comparison of these different patterns the following conclusions can be drawn: 1) In most but not all cases both domains of the class I molecule were essential for CTL recognition, but residue 152 was critically important for the majority of CTL tested; 2) amino acids 114/116 were also critical in most cases, and their position close to amino acid 152 in the tertiary structure of the molecule may have some functional significance; and 3) amino acid 161, although highly conserved, plays an unexpected but very important role in CTL function.\r"

After transfection of these genes into P815 (high transfection efficiency recipient) murine cells, the bindings of Bw6, HLA-B7, and HLA-B27 allele-specific mAb were studied, as well as that of human anti-HLA-B7 and anti-HLA-B27 monospecific alloantisera. Most of the HLA-B7 antigenic determinants were assigned to the first external domain of the molecule. Four different epitopic areas could be defined: the Bw6 epitope was associated with residues 82 and 83; the BB7.1 epitope to amino acids 63, 67, and 70; the MB40.2 and MB40.3 epitope to amino acid sequence 177-180, and human alloantisera identified as an epitope associated with residue 9. HLA-B27 antigenicity studied by TM-1 mAb was found to involve residues 77 and 80 in the alpha-1 domain. Results obtained with human monospecific alloantisera allowed the definition of an additional allospecific site associated with the NH2 terminal part on the alpha-1 domain of HLA-B27. Epitope mapping fits with data obtained by sequence comparisons and is discussed with reference to the crystallographic three-dimensional structure of the HLA-A2 molecule.\r"

  ".U": "89009766\r", 
  ".W": "Site-directed mutagenesis of HLA-A2.1 has been used to identify the amino acid substitutions in HLA-A2.3 that are responsible for the lack of recognition of the latter molecule by the HLA-A2/A28 specific antibody, CR11-351, and by HLA-A2.1 specific CTL. Three genes were constructed that encoded HLA-A2 derivatives containing one of the amino acids known to occur in HLA-A2.3: Thr for Ala149, Glu for Val152, and Trp for Leu156. Three additional genes were constructed that encoded the different possible combinations of two amino acid substitutions at these residues. Finally, a gene encoding all three substitutions and equivalent to HLA-A2.3 was constructed. These genes were transfected into the class I negative, human cell line Hmy2.C1R. Analysis of this panel of cells revealed that recognition by the antibody CR11-351 was completely lost when Thr was substituted for Ala149, whereas substitutions at amino acids 152 and 156, either singly or in combination, had no effect on the binding of this antibody. The epitopes recognized by the allogeneic and xenogeneic HLA-A2.1 specific CTL clones used in this study were all affected by either one or two amino acid substitutions. Of those epitopes sensitive to single amino acid changes, none were affected by the substitution of Thr for Ala149, whereas all of them were affected by at least one of the substitutions of Glu for Val 152 or Trp for Leu156. Overall, amino acid residue 152 exerted a stronger effect on the epitopes recognized by HLA-A2.1 specific CTL than did residue 156. Of those epitopes affected only by multiple amino acid substitutions, double substitutions at residues 149 and 152 or at 152 and 156 resulted in a loss of recognition, whereas a mutant with substitutions at residues 149 and 156 was recognized normally. This reemphasizes the importance of residue 152 and indicates that residue 149 can affect epitope formation in conjunction with another amino acid substitution. These results are discussed in the context of current models for the recognition of alloantigens and in light of the recently published three-dimensional structure of the HLA-A2.1 molecule.\r"

  ".W": "The effect of radiation on three discrete Ag-presentation functions in resting B cells was examined: 1) Ag uptake and processing, 2) expression of processed Ag in the context of functional class II molecules, and 3) provision of necessary co-stimulatory, or \"second,\" signals. Analysis of radiation's effect on B cell presentation of intact vs fragmented Ag or its effect on presentation by Ag-pulsed B cells indicated that damage to Ag uptake and processing could not account for the bulk of the radiation-induced Ag-presentation defect. Experiments with phosphatidylinositol hydrolysis as an indirect measure of TCR occupancy suggested that irradiation caused a fairly rapid (within 1 to 2 h) decrease in the ability of the B cell APC to display a stimulatory combination of Ag and class II molecule. Ag dose-response analyses demonstrated that when presenting a fragment of the Ag pigeon cytochrome c to a T cell clone, 3000 rad-treated B cell APC were able to stimulate approximately 50% as much phosphatidylinositol turnover as unirradiated B cells. It was also found that, in contrast to their inability to initiate T cell proliferation, and similarly to chemically cross-linked splenocytes, heavily irradiated resting B cells plus Ag induced a state of Ag hyporesponsiveness in T cell clones. This effect on T cells had the same Ag- and MHC-specificity as did receptor occupancy required for proliferation, indicating that heavily irradiated resting B cells bear functional class II molecules. Co-culture of T cells with allogeneic B cells and syngeneic heavily irradiated B cells or chemically cross-linked splenic APC plus Ag resulted in T cell proliferation and interfered with the induction of the hyporesponsive state. This co-stimulatory function was radiosensitive in resting allogeneic B cells. Together, these data support the hypothesis that the major functional consequences of radiation to resting B cell APC are a reduction in the effective display of Ag plus class II molecules and, probably what is more important, a loss in the ability to provide APC-derived co-stimulatory signals.\r"

  ".W": "To explore the cell surface molecules expressed on pre-B cells we have produced a panel of alloantibodies against transformed pre-B cells from BALB/c mice by immunizing a wild mouse, Mus spretus. One of these antibodies, BP-3, recognized glycoproteins of Mr 38,000 to 48,000 on pre-B cells transformed either by the Abelson murine leukemia virus or an erb B oncogene construct. Removal of N-linked oligosaccharides from the BP-3 Ag revealed a single core protein of Mr 32,000. The Ag was expressed by bone marrow cells in all but one (A/J) of the inbred mouse strains tested and in wild mice of biochemical groups Mus-1 and Mus-2. Analysis of the tissue distribution revealed expression of the BP-3 reactive molecule on normal pre-B and B cells in the bone marrow, 35% of B cells in the circulation, 30% of the B cells in the spleen, and less than or equal to 20% of B cells in lymph nodes, peritoneal cavity, and Peyer's patches. The subpopulation of BP-3+ B cells in bone marrow and peripheral tissues displayed an immature phenotype (IgM IgD +/- ). Examination of a panel of transformed B lineage cells confirmed the early stage-specific expression of the BP-3 alloantigen. In addition, a myeloid cell line and normal myeloid cells were found to express the BP-3 alloantigen. In contrast to B lineage cells, the level of BP-3 expression increased as a function of myeloid cell differentiation. Myeloid cells in the bone marrow expressed relatively little Ag, whereas circulating neutrophils and peritoneal macrophages expressed relatively high levels of the BP-3 alloantigen with Mr 38,000, 41,000, and 46,000. The data suggest that this variably glycosylated cell surface protein could play different roles in the differentiation of B lineage and myeloid lineage cells. The BP-3 alloantigen appears to be a useful marker for virgin B cells that have recently migrated from the bone marrow to the periphery.\r"

However, expression of Leu 23 glycoprotein can be induced on the Jurkat T leukemia cell line within a few hours after stimulation with soluble anti-CD3 mAb or Con A. After removal of the stimulus Leu 23 is expressed for greater than 30 h. A total of 20 to 30% of resting human thymocytes was unexpectedly stained by anti-Leu 23 mAb. Biochemical analysis revealed that the Leu 23 Ag expressed on thymocytes is a phosphorylated disulfide-linked dimer composed of 28- and 32-kDa subunits. Within the thymus, Leu 23 is preferentially expressed on the CD3bright, mostly CD4+ CD8- or CD4- CD8+ subpopulations. By contrast, CD3dim CD4+CD8+ thymocytes expressed only very low levels of Leu 23, and CD7+ CD3- CD4- CD8- thymocytes were Leu 23-. However, Leu 23 was induced on the CD3dim thymocytes by in vitro culture of thymocytes with anti-CD3-conjugated Sepharose. The transition from CD3dim to CD3bright within the thymus may be an important differentiation stage and influence selection of the antigenic repertoire. Therefore, the ability to detect subpopulations within the thymus that express Leu 23 Ag may help to identify thymocytes activated in vivo, possibly by the functional engagement of their CD3/TCR.\r"

  ".W": "Studies of an EBV-transformed and TNP-specific human B cell line revealed that, unlike myeloma or hybridoma cell lines that consist mainly of fully differentiated cells, most of the cloned EBV-transformed cells were not fully differentiated, as judged by inability to bind TNP-SRBC and to secrete anti-TNP antibody. The minority of more differentiated cells were selected by TNP-SRBC rosetting. They were found to proliferate to a lesser extent than nonrosetting cells and to contain increased numbers of antibody-secreting cells. This inverse relationship between proliferation and differentiation was also shown to be cell cycle related in that the TNP-SRBC rosetting cells resided, to a greater extent than the nonrosetting cells, in the G1 phase of the cell cycle. The finding that the G1 phase of the cell cycle was associated with differentiation into anti-TNP secreting cells was confirmed by demonstrating that treatment with hydroxyurea, which arrests the cells in G1, resulted in decreased proliferation and an increased proportion of antibody-secreting cells. Similarly, addition of phorbol ester resulted in increased antibody secretion and decreased proliferation, suggesting a role for protein kinase C in this differentiation pathway. The strategy of increasing the number of antibody-producing cells in this human EBV line, by promoting differentiation of the cells in G1, may be relevant to the large scale production of specific human mAb for the treatment and diagnosis of human diseases.\r"

  ".W": "A considerable body of evidence from this and other laboratories indicates that complement receptor type 2 (CR2) modulates B cell activation and growth. In the present studies we have examined the effects of three different types of CR2 ligands, i.e., monomeric, aggregated, and latex-bound C3dg; mAb to different CR2 epitopes; and UV-inactivated, non-transforming EBV (EBVUV) for their actions on highly purified, high density resting tonsil B cells. Although none of these ligands induced B cells to enter the cell cycle or synergized with either anti-mu or low m.w. B cell growth factor in triggering B cell mitogenesis, aggregated C3dg, latex-bound C3dg, the OKB7 anti-CR2 mAb, and EBVUV-enhanced thymidine incorporation by phorbol ester-activated tonsil B cells. Such enhancement was not T cell or monocyte dependent. The major action of the CR2 ligands thus seems to be to enhance the transition of B cells activated by certain stimuli from the G1 to the S phase of the cell cycle. In contrast to the action of aggregated and latex-bound C3dg, monomeric C3dg was inhibitory for phorbol ester and aggregated C3dg-induced B cell activation. The HB-5 anti-CR2 mAb, which reacts with a different epitope on CR2 from that of OKB7, did not synergize with PMA in B cell activation. These data provide additional evidence for a role for the CR2 in the control of B cell growth and provide a useful model for studying the CR2-mediated signals that affect the growth of B cells.\r"

At intervals after Ag pulse, APC were fixed with paraformaldehyde to arrest Ag processing and to preserve the expression levels of the presented determinants. Expression of T cell sites at each time point was probed by a panel of BALC/c T hybridomas specific for the HA of influenza A/Puerto Rico/8/34 virus, recognizing either site 1 (residues 111 to 119), site 2 (126 to 138), or site 3 (302 to 313). Characteristic patterns of presentation were observed for each site: sites 2 and 3 achieved maximal expression by 8 h post pulse, but declined thereafter, whereas site 1 presentation continued to increase over time. The quantitative expression of each T cell site was affected by the proteolysis inhibitor leupeptin, resulting in partial inhibition of site 1, complete blocking of site 2, but enhancement of site 3. However, the expression kinetics of sites 1 and 3, which could be observed in the presence of the inhibitor, remained qualitatively unchanged. These observations indicate that some T cell determinants (e.g., HA site 1) may exhibit a greater longevity of expression on APC than other antigenic sites of the same protein. Differences in the persistence of surface expression of distinct T cell sites may be a factor in their relative immunodominance.\r"

In this study we examined the requirement for macrophages in the production and metabolism of PIP2 in lectin-stimulated lymph node lymphocytes. When lymph node cells (LNC) were stimulated by the mitogenic lectin, Con A, a two- to threefold increase in [3H]inositol-labeled PIP2 occurred within 15 min, followed by a decrease to the level of unstimulated cells by 30 min. In addition, there was also a two- to threefold increase in the accumulation of [3H]inositol-labeled inositol monophosphate (IP) 30 min after the addition of lectin. However, when the LNC were depleted of macrophages by adherence to plastic and passage over cotton columns before the addition of Con A, the PIP2 response was not seen and the IP accumulation was reduced by 40%. The macrophage-depleted, Con A-stimulated cultures failed to synthesize DNA. [3H]TdR incorporation was only 15% of that of Con A-stimulated unseparated LNC cultures. Soluble IL-2 production was also depressed to 20% of that observed in macrophage-containing cultures. Furthermore, when macrophages (2%) were added to the macrophage-depleted cultures, PIP2 production, IP accumulation, and [3H]TdR incorporation were restored to levels observed in the stimulated unseparated LNC cultures. The addition of IL-1 or the phorbol ester 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate in combination with Con A also restored both [3H]TdR incorporation and IL-2 synthesis in macrophage-depleted cultures. However, they did so without a detectable increase in phosphatidylinositol metabolism. Collectively, these data suggested that the production and degradation of PIP2 in Con A-stimulated lymphocytes was potentiated by the presence of macrophages.\r"

Therefore, experiments were carried out to determine whether PHA immobilized onto microtiter plates could stimulate T cells in the absence of AC. Peripheral blood T4 cells were cultured under limiting dilution conditions with either soluble or immobilized PHA with or without rIL-1 beta, rIL-2, r-TNF-alpha, an anti-CD28 mAb (9.3), or irradiated EBV-transformed B cells as AC. The frequency of proliferating T4 cells was assessed by examining wells microscopically, and the frequency of T4 cells producing IL-2 was assessed by examining the ability of supernatants to support CTLL-2 proliferation. The percentage of T4 cells growing and producing IL-2 was determined by a maximum likelihood procedure. Immobilized, but not soluble, PHA induced a mean of 20.0 +/- 2.6% of T4 cells to grow in the complete absence of AC in medium supplemented with rIL-2. Whereas rIL-1 beta, rTNF-alpha, and 9.3 were unable to support T4 cell growth in the absence of rIL-2, each enhanced the percentage of T4 cells responding to immobilized PHA in the presence of rIL-2. In contrast, both soluble and immobilized PHA were unable to induce T4 cell IL-2 production in the absence of AC, even when cultures were supplemented with rIL-1 beta or 9.3. In the presence of AC, a small percentage of T4 cells (5.4 to 11.7%) was stimulated to produce detectable amounts of IL-2 by either immobilized or soluble PHA. Moreover, in the presence of AC, a very small population (approximately 1%) of PHA-stimulated T4 cells proliferated without supplemental rIL-2. The data indicate that a matrix of immobilized PHA is sufficient for some T4 cells to be activated to respond to IL-2, whereas others require additional signals provided by rIL-1 beta, rTNF alpha, 9.3, or AC. In contrast, neither soluble nor immobilized PHA is sufficient to induce T cell IL-2 production. This response requires signals provided by intact AC.\r"

The effector cell of NA activity is a CD: 4+, 8-, Leu-8/TQ-1+ T lymphocyte acting against bacteria via cytophylic IgA in a mechanism similar to antibody-dependent cellular activity. Because AIDS is a profound immunodeficiency caused by HIV involving primarily CD4 lymphocytes and in particular the Leu-8/TQ-1 subset, it was of interest to assess NA activity of HIV+ subjects at various stages of the disease. Results indicate that NA activity against Salmonella typhi and Salmonella paratyphi C is significantly decreased in AIDS as well as in lymphadenopathy syndrome patients. Furthermore, sera containing IgA against salmonellae were not able to arm PBMC from HIV+ patients. The humoral response against S. typhi-LPS was also greatly decreased after HIV infection, in contrast to the known hypergammaglobulinemia seen in these subjects. Defective NA activity might contribute to the increased incidence of salmonellosis observed in AIDS.\r"

Patients with rheumatoid arthritis had raised levels of sIL-2R both in their sera and in their synovial fluid compared to patients with osteoarthritis and age-matched healthy controls. Mononuclear cells from the synovial fluid of rheumatoid arthritis patients were found to produce spontaneously high levels of sIL-2R which eluted at approximately m.w. 40,000 on gel filtration. In contrast, autologous peripheral blood cells only produced comparable levels upon stimulation with mitogenic lectin. Sequential studies indicated that serum sIL-2R levels were highly correlated with disease activity, indicating that measurement of sIL-2R may be a useful clinical marker in the future. Within the joint, synovial fluid sIL-2R levels correlated significantly with immunoreactive IL-1 beta levels, providing evidence for a role of IL-1 in immune activation in the synovium. In synovial fluids, sIL-2R level also correlated with functional inhibition of IL-2-driven responses in vitro. Furthermore, sIL-2R immunoreactivity in synovial fluid eluted at m.w. 100,000 coeluting with IL-2-inhibitory activity and consistent with a role for sIL-2R in down-regulation of IL-2 responses. The abnormal m.w. may be accounted for by complex formation in the synovial fluid. Given the ability of sIL-2R to bind IL-2, the presence of sIL-2R within the joint may contribute to the well documented \"IL-2 defect\" seen in rheumatoid arthritis.\r"

Using the neonatal cell transfer model of the disease, which we have described previously, we have shown that B cell suppression of newborn recipients by anti-mu treatment did not affect the transfer of diabetes by means of T cells. B cell-depleted, purified T cells from diabetic adults were injected into newborns treated with either IR-52, a control rat myeloma protein, or LOMM.9, a rat anti-mouse mu-chain mAb. Both groups developed diabetes over a similar time scale. Although the pancreases in both groups showed massive infiltration by T lymphocytes, B lymphocytes, presumably recruited in the host, were present in the IR-52-treated group, whereas they were absent in the LOMM.9-treated group. Anti-mu-treated diabetic animals showed substantial B cell suppression in vivo and in vitro when compared with IR-52-treated controls. These results suggest that B cell autoreactivity is a secondary phenomenon that is unimportant during the effector phase of diabetes in nonobese diabetic mice.\r"

They also inhibited the biologic activity of MuIL-1 alpha but not the activity of rMuIL-1 beta as measured in a T cell co-stimulator assay. These IL-1 alpha specific mAb only partially inhibited the co-stimulator activity found in macrophage culture supernatants but completely inhibited the co-stimulator activity of fixed peritoneal exudate cells. The data indicate that the species of IL-1 associated with murine macrophage membranes shares at least two epitopes with IL-1 alpha and probably represents a product of the IL-1 alpha gene. These reagents will be valuable for quantitative assessment of specific IL-1 proteins on cell surfaces, in culture supernatants, and in cell lysates. They will also be useful both in vitro and in vivo for determining the relative roles of the different IL-1 species in the development of biologic responses.\r"

One polyclonal antiserum (goat-anti-mouse Fc epsilon R) inhibited binding of IgE to both B and T lymphocytes, whereas another polyclonal antiserum (rabbit-anti-mouse Fc epsilon R) and the rat mAb inhibited the binding of IgE to B lymphocytes but did not influence the binding of IgE to T lymphocytes. When lymphocytes were surface labeled with 125I, 49-kDa and 38-kDa IgE-binding proteins were immunoprecipitated from B lymphocyte lysates by B3B4 and from B and T lymphocyte lysates by the goat antiserum.

Substance P fragment 2-11 had no costimulatory activity; however, SP fragment 1-4 retained the full activity of the parent undecapeptide. Fragment 1-4 (ARG-PRO-LYS-PRO), a peptide containing a PRO residue between two positive charges, is a tuftsin-like (THR-LYS-PRO-ARG) tetrapeptide, and tuftsin exerted an identical costimulatory effect. Substance P, SP:1-4, and tuftsin were optimally effective as costimulants at 10(-7) to 10(-6) M. (ALA1)-tuftsin, an inhibitory analog of tuftsin, was a potent negative regulator of two signal-dependent colony formation. (ALA1)-tuftsin at concentrations less than or equal to 10(-9) M exerted dose-dependent inhibition of the positive effects of optimal concentrations of all of the co-stimulants tested, including bacterial LPS. The inhibitory tetrapeptide was equivalent in activity to ferritin, an established inhibitor of two signal-dependent colony formation. The results indicated that SP may influence myelopoiesis in addition to its other inflammatory and immunopotentiating properties. In addition, a potentially valuable modulator of SP and LPS responses in this system, (ALA1)-tuftsin, was identified.\r"

Two clones were found to react with an epitope present in the rabies glycoprotein, which was presented by the HLA-DR7 molecule. Other T cell clones recognized synthetic epitopes corresponding to the rabies nucleoprotein in association with the HLA-DR7 or HLA-DQw3 molecule, and one clone responded to the viral nucleocapsid Ag in the presence of HLA-DPw4. T cell clones that exhibited different cross-reactivity patterns among several virus strains were found to recognize closely situated epitopes (within 15 amino acid residues), which were presented in the context of the same MHC molecule. The lack of recognition of a particular virus strain by a T cell clone was attributable in some cases to amino acid variations of the Ag that appear to affect the T cell's receptor for Ag specificity and not the ability of that epitope to associate with the corresponding MHC molecule. Comparisons of the T cell cross-reactivity patterns with various rabies and rabies-related viruses, the fine antigenic specificity, and MHC restriction may aid in understanding the role of individual amino acid variations among virus strains in the induction of cross-protective immunity.\r"

CTL specific for both the amino terminus (residues 1-271) and the carboxyl terminus (residues 512-708) of the T Ag molecule have been detected, and we have previously cloned CTL of both specificities. In this paper we show that the panel of 10 CTL clones specific for the C-terminal region includes clones specific for three different epitopes, termed C1, C2, and C3. Epitopes C1 and C2 are conserved in the T Ag of the related papova viruses BK and SA12, and only epitopes C2 and C3 are present on SV40 transformed targets bearing the Kk mutant Kkml. Epitopes C1 and C2 were mapped to residues 563-576 by using in-frame deletion mutants of SV40 T antigen, and all clones specific for these two epitopes can lyse Kk bearing target cells in the presence of a synthetic peptide comprising residues 559-576. Kk and Kkml differ at residue 152, which is located in the Ag-binding pocket. Because epitopes C1 and C2 can be formed by the same antigenic peptide, but epitope C1 is not present on SV40 transformed Kkml cells, epitopes C1 and C2 must differ in the contribution made by residue 152 of the MHC class I molecule. These data show that CTL epitopes on transformed cells can be made up of Ag fragments, and strengthen the idea that this is a general phenomenon for both class I and class II restricted T cell epitopes.\r"

Bone marrow (BM), spleen (S), peritoneal (P), and thioglycolate-stimulated peritoneal (Pthio) macrophages isolated from resistant C57BL/6 Cr (B6) mice consistently restrict HSV-1 macromolecular synthesis earlier in the viral replicative cycle than do macrophages isolated from the same tissue sources from more susceptible DBA/2Cr (D2) mice. B6-BM (BM macrophages from B6 mice) restrict HSV macromolecular synthesis at least at two points in the replicative cycle: 1) before the onset of alpha-protein synthesis and 2) between the onset of gamma 1 protein and DNA synthesis. D2-BM macrophages restrict HSV replication at about the time of DNA synthesis. B6-P macrophages restrict HSV replication shortly after gamma 1 protein synthesis, and D2-P macrophages inhibit the virus slightly later, but before DNA synthesis. B6-S macrophages restrict HSV replication at about the time of DNA synthesis, and D2-S macrophages inhibit replication after the onset of gamma 2 protein synthesis. Pthio macrophages are more permissive to HSV infection than BM, P, or S macrophages: restrictions in viral replication occur at the time of DNA synthesis in B6-Pthio macrophages, and after the onset of gamma 2 protein synthesis in D2-Pthio cells. These studies demonstrate that isolated macrophages from inbred mouse strains express intrinsic resistance to HSV infection that correlates with in vivo resistance to acute (lethal) infection. Intrinsic resistance to HSV-1 infection is due to restriction of viral macromolecular synthesis. HSV replication is inhibited in macrophages at multiple points in the viral growth cycle, depending on the tissue from which the cells are isolated.\r"

Synthetic oligonucleotides were designed to introduce individual and combined amino acid substitutions in both the alpha 1 (positions 9, 43, and the highly polymorphic cluster of residues from aa 62 to 83) and alpha 2 (positions 107, 152, and 156) domains to investigate the effect of the specific mutation on the recognition of the molecule at the surface of transfected human and mouse cell lines by a panel of mAb that recognize monomorphic or polymorphic determinants in MHC class I molecules. At least three non-overlapping serologic epitopes were identified. Mutations in the highly polymorphic region at aa 62 to 66 completely eliminated binding of mAb MA2.1 (A2/B17 cross-reactive). Mutation at position 107 resulted in complete loss of binding of the A2/Aw69-specific mAb PA2.1 and MA2.2 and partial loss of mAb BB7.2 binding. The recognition by other allotypic mAbs was not affected by these mutations and they therefore represent at least a third serologic epitope.

Introduction of residues of HLA-B7 origin in the polymorphic segment spanning aa 70 to 80 created a molecule carrying the -Bw6 supertypic determinant as demonstrated by mAb SFR8-B6 binding.\r"

In this communication, we report the results of measuring dioxygenase activity in the peritoneal exudate cells and tumor cytotoxicity at the transplantation loci after in vivo transplantation of tumor cells into the peritoneal cavity of syngeneic or allogeneic strains of mice. The enzyme was induced only when the tumor cells were being rejected from allogeneic animals and no change was observed when the cells continued to grow in syngeneic animals. Furthermore, when the syngeneic tumor cells in a diffusion chamber were i.p. transplanted simultaneously with i.p. injection of allogeneic tumor cells, the enzyme was induced not only in allografted tumor cells but also in the syngeneic tumor cells. Under these conditions, the tumor cells in the diffusion chamber ceased to grow and 50% of the cells were rejected. To determine the type of cells containing the induced enzyme, the peritoneal exudate cells (tumor cells and host cells--mostly small lymphocytes) were separated into six fractions by sedimentation under gravity and by differential centrifugation. Approximately 80% of total enzyme activity was localized in a tumor-rich fraction (98.9% purity), whereas only 0.2% of the activity was found in a lymphocyte-rich fraction (99.5% purity).

  ".W": "The relative contributions of IL-2 and IL-4 during the immune response to the retrovirus-induced tumor, FBL, were examined. Both proliferative and cytolytic responses to FBL were measured and compared to similar responses to minor histocompatibility Ag. The addition of alpha IL-2 partially inhibited FBL-stimulated proliferation of purified L3T4+ T cells and nearly completely inhibited the response of Lyt-2+ T cells, whereas alpha IL-4 partially inhibited the proliferative response of the L3T4+ subset but had no effect on the response of the Lyt-2+ subset. The addition of exogenous IL-4 augmented the proliferative response of both subsets. Therefore, IL-4 is an endogenous growth factor for FBL-induced specific proliferation of the L3T4+ and not the Lyt-2+ population, but both subpopulations can respond to IL-4. Similar examination of anti-FBL CTL responses revealed that alpha IL-2, but not alpha IL-4, inhibited FBL-specific Lyt-2+ CTL generation. However, exogenous IL-4 partially replaced the L3T4+ Th cell activity necessary for optimal Lyt-2+ FBL-specific CTL generation. Therefore, IL-4 is not required but can participate in the CTL response. The role of IL-4 during the immune response of B6 mice to minor histocompatibility Ag disparate BALB.B cells was analyzed. alpha IL-4 had no detectable effect on the proliferative or cytolytic response to BALB.B cells, suggesting that endogenous IL-4 does not have a significant role in these responses. The extent of involvement of endogenous IL-4 in the T cell responses to retrovirus-induced tumor Ag and minor histocompatibility Ag presumably reflects the nature of the stimulating Ag, and detection of an IL-4 response may correlate with induction of an antibody response. Thus, the immunizing Ag and/or host B cell repetoire may influence which subsets of L3T4+ Th cells are activated during priming in vivo.\r"

In the presence of ammonium chloride as an activator, the \"whole\" immunotoxin as well as the \"fragment\" immunotoxins did not show any significant difference in the cell killing efficacy. In contrast, without the activator, the efficacy of the T101 immunotoxin was greatly improved when fragments were used. Indeed, at a saturating dose, a cytoreduction of three orders of magnitude was obtained with the fragment immunotoxins vs less than one order of magnitude for the whole immunotoxin, as assessed in a clonogenic assay. This enhancing effect was related to better cell killing kinetics, because with a similar amount of A-chain molecules bound per cell, T101 fragment immunotoxins achieved a twofold faster protein synthesis inactivation rate than the corresponding whole IgG immunotoxin. No significant difference in activity was shown between monovalent (Fab) and divalent (F(ab')2) forms of fragment immunotoxins. The observation that T101 fragment immunotoxins were more potent than intact immunotoxins was extended to another fragment immunotoxin constructed with an antibody (F111.98) directed against a different epitope of the CD5 Ag. In another model (anti-CD22 1G11 antibody on Raji cells), the fragment immunotoxin did not show any superiority over the IgG immunotoxin which was by itself very potent, strongly suggesting an Ag-dependent phenomenon.\r"

  ".U": "89009827\r", 
  ".W": "Ag recognition of Lyt-2 (CD8)-positive T lymphocytes requires the presentation by APC of a suitably processed Ag in association with MHC class I molecules. In previous studies we have obtained evidence that, for optimal activation, both the alpha beta-TCR and Lyt-2 have to participate in this recognition process. In the current study we investigate the functional consequences of limited cross-linking of these cell surface molecules by using soluble, dimeric hetero- and homoconjugates of mAb to Lyt-2 and to the TCR beta-chain (F23.1). Heterologous cross-linking of Lyt-2 to the TCR induced a vigorous, selective Lyt-2+ T cell proliferative response. Functionally active cytotoxic cells were generated, and a high frequency of responding cells was observed in limiting dilution analyses. In contrast, homologous TCR cross-linking initiated a less pronounced proliferation with a relatively low frequency of response, whereas Lyt-2 cross-linking resulted in no cellular proliferation. Significant T cell activation occurred with exposure to anti-Lyt-2: F23.1 mAb dimers at concentrations an order of magnitude lower than those required for stimulation by F23.1:F23.1 mAb dimers. The induction of proliferation by mAb dimers occurred in the absence of Fc components and in rigorously APC depleted, purified T cell preparations. Effective stimulation of resting T cells could be induced also by heterodimers of monovalent Fab fragments. Heterologous cross-linking of Lyt-2 to the TCR was superior to homologous TCR cross-linking primarily with respect to proliferation in IL-2 containing media and to IL-2R expression, whereas proliferation in response to other lymphokines and the production of IL-2 itself were similar under both cross-linking regimens. Thus, when linked to the TCR, Lyt-2 contributed a strong, positive signal toward IL-2-dependent growth of resting T cells. We assume that in the case of Ag-driven T cell activation, the class I MHC molecule acts as the physiologic cross-linking ligand for Lyt-2 and the TCR.\r"

In addition, the intact antibody inhibited the proliferation induced by F(ab')2 of anti-IgM and BCGF. Because both two distinct types of FcR for IgG on the B cells, one specific for IgG2 (Fc gamma 2R) and the other for both IgG2 and IgG1 (Fc gamma 1/gamma 2R), can bind rabbit IgG, we determined whether they participate in the inhibition of the B cell proliferation by intact anti-guinea pig IgM antibody. Blocking Fc gamma 1/gamma 2R by F(ab')2 of anti-Fc gamma 1/gamma 2R mAb significantly reversed the inhibitory effect of intact anti-IgM antibody. F(ab')2 of anti-Fc gamma 2R mAb, however, was not effective. Furthermore, guinea pig IgG1 and IgG2 anti-rabbit IgG antibodies suppressed similarly the B cell proliferation induced by F(ab')2 of rabbit anti-IgM and BCGF. These results show that between these two types of Fc gamma R on B cells, Fc gamma 1/gamma 2R alone is involved in the regulation of anti-IgM and BCGF-induced B cell proliferation, and inhibits the response when cross-linked to the surface IgM.\r"

Our results suggest that the concentration of these lymphokines present in a standard MLR culture may serve to regulate the magnitude of the proliferative response. The B cells that co-stimulated with IL-1 and IL-6 were found to be contained almost exclusively within the large, low density population. Presumably, large low density B cells have attained a state in which they are particularly effective at presentation of alloantigen. Together our findings indicate that three components are required for Ag presentation in primary MLC: class II MHC-positive stimulator cells that have attained the appropriate state of differentiation and the presence of both IL-1 and IL-6.\r"

  ".W": "Recent studies have identified cell-associated proteins that are membrane anchored by glycosyl-inositol-phospholipid structures but the biologic implications of this mode of membrane attachment are incompletely understood. Among proteins anchored in this way is the decay-accelerating factor (DAF), a complement (C) regulatory factor that functions on blood cell surfaces to prevent autologous C attack. As one approach to investigate the functional consequences of glycosyl-inositol-phospholipid-anchoring of DAF in T lymphocytes, the effects of crosslinking surface DAF molecules were compared to those of crosslinking conventionally by anchored cluster of differentiation (CD) proteins. Upon incubation with anti-DAF mAb and anti-murine IgG, DAF re-distributed to a pole of the cell with a t1/2 at 37 degrees C of 4.4 min as compared to t1/2 of 3.5 to 7 min for CD3, CD4, and CD8. Re-distribution of DAF occurred independently of CD2, CD3, CD4, or CD8. Anti-DAF immunoprecipitates of membrane extracts of cells chemically cross-linked with dithiobis(succinimidylpropionate) contained only monomeric DAF. Immunofluorescent staining demonstrated clustered actin, tubulin, and vimentin beneath the capped DAF protein. Pre-treatment of cells with colchicine or 8-azidoadenosine 3',5'-cyclic phosphate, but not lumicolchicine, resulted in reduction of the t1/2 for DAF to 1 to 2.6 min. Conversely, treatment of cells with cytochalasins B or D completely blocked DAF capping. The results indicate that, upon cross-linking, glycosyl-inositol-phospholipid-anchored DAF molecules undergo capping similar to conventionally anchored CD molecules and that DAF capping is associated with cytoskeletal reorganization.\r"

PMA, 1-oleyl-2-acetyl-glycerol, and mezerein, activators of protein kinase C, caused an increase in lymphocyte F-actin within 2 to 5 min. After stimulation with PMA, lymphocytes formed pseudopods containing an increased concentration of F-actin and had an increase of actin in the Triton-insoluble cytoskeletal fraction. Sphingosine and H-7, inhibitors of protein kinase C activation, inhibited the increase in F-actin induced by PMA. The increase in F-actin in response to PMA was striking in Th and Ts lymphocytes (2- to 3-fold increase), but B lymphocytes had only a slight increase (1.15-fold). Thus, activation of protein kinase C modulates actin conformation specifically in T lymphocytes.\r"

In fact, priming normal joints with three weekly IL-1 intraarticular injections results in a significant reduction in joint swelling and diminished histopathologic alterations/lesions caused by subsequent methylated BSA-induced arthritis. Similarly, post treatment with IL-1 intraarticular injection after arthritis induction reduced arthritic swelling and joint injury if IL-1 was given during the developing stage of arthritis. Our results suggest that IL-1 might limit arthritic inflammation and progressive cartilage destruction through an, as yet, undetermined mechanism(s). Further in vivo investigations are required to determine the therapeutic utility of IL-1 in reducing early arthritic inflammation.\r"

However, treatment of stimulator-adherent cells with anti-HLA class I, anti-DR and anti-DP mAb had no effect on the proliferative response of T cells under the condition. It was further observed that CD4-enriched cells could significantly proliferate in the presence of autologous adherent cells either untreated or treated with anti-DQ mAb, although treatment of adherent cells with anti-DR mAb blocked proliferative response of CD4-enriched cells. Moreover, the proliferative response of CD4-enriched cells was suppressed by addition of CD8-enriched cells in the presence of untreated adherent cells, whereas the proliferative response of CD4-enriched cells could not be suppressed by CD8-enriched cells when the adherent cells in the culture were treated with anti-DQ mAb. These observations suggest that CD8 T cells are required for suppression of proliferative response of CD4 T cells to HLA-DR molecules on autologous stimulator-adherent cells, and that HLA-DQ molecules on the surface of adherent cells play an important role in the induction of suppression by CD8 T cells.\r"

  ".U": "89009841\r", 
  ".W": "Defining the cellular and molecular mechanisms of interaction of developing thymocytes with nonlymphoid cells of the thymic microenvironment is critical for understanding normal thymus function. We have previously shown that the CD2/LFA-3 adhesion pathway is important in the interaction of thymocytes with a variety of LFA-3+ nonlymphoid thymic microenvironment cell types. Moreover, T cell activation via the CD2 (alternative, Ag independent) pathway is considered an important mechanism for intrathymic T cell proliferation. To study the relevance of CD2/LFA-3 interactions to human thymocyte activation, we have used purified LFA-3 Ag in several in vitro assays of thymocyte proliferation. Whereas LFA-3 Ag alone did not induce thymocyte proliferation, LFA-3 Ag in combination with the anti-CD2 antibody, CD2.1, and rIL-2 induced marked thymocyte proliferation. Additionally, the anti-CD28 antibody, Kolt2, could substitute for rIL-2, resulting in thymocyte activation induced by LFA-3 Ag in combination with antibodies CD2.1 and Kolt2. In both triggering systems, LFA-3 induced thymocyte activation was dependent upon the concentration of LFA-3 Ag. LFA-3 Ag-dependent thymocyte activation was directed primarily toward CD1-, mature thymocytes. Finally, intact SRBC that express the sheep homolog of LFA-3, T11TS, in combination with antibody CD2.1 and rIL-2 could also induce thymocyte activation. These data suggest that interaction of LFA-3 molecules with thymocyte CD2 molecules may provide a component of the stimulus for normal intrathymic thymocyte activation leading to thymocyte proliferation.\r"

  ".W": "We have sought to address the question of clonal variation of TCR within a human T leukemia cell line, HPB-ALL. To do so, a panel of anti-idiotypic antibodies was produced and the cell line examined for variants. We isolated both spontaneous idiotype and receptor-negative variants without applying mutagens or any selective pressure other than sorting the cells. These sorted and cloned populations are all clonally related to each other as shown by their beta-TCR locus gene rearrangements. The idiotype variants have alpha-chains which are differentially glycosylated, but they have the same size core protein after treatment with peptide N-glycosidase F to remove their carbohydrate side chains. This probably accounts for their idiotypic difference, since the antibody that distinguishes them appears dependent upon glycosylation for its binding, as shown by immunoprecipitation in the presence versus the absence of tunicamycin, which inhibits glycosylation from occurring. The idiotype variants differed from one another in variable region sequences by only a single amino acid substitution in the beta-chain, which is likely not important for the idiotypic difference. The receptor-negative variant produces both alpha- and beta-mRNA and cytoplasmic protein for TCR, but fails to transport this protein to the cell surface. We conclude that idiotype and receptor-negative variants of a T cell clone can occur in the absence of appreciable somatic mutation.\r"

Moreover, 5B9 cells could not suppress anti-TT antibody response even in the presence of free KLH. 5B9 cloned cells suppressed the anti-KLH antibody response of B cells cultured with CD4+4B4+ cells without requiring the presence of CD8+ cells. This KLH-specific CD8 suppressor clone is an effector type rather than an inducer type of suppressor T cell. The cloned cells expressed alpha- and beta-TCR proteins (defined by WT-31 antibody) on their cell surface. More importantly, the CD3:TCR complex was functionally important in the suppression induced by this clone, because after CD3 antigen modulation from its cell surface, the suppressor effector function was abolished.\r"

In vivo administration of mAb 14-12, reactive with effector TsF, exacerbated the clinical expression of encephalomyelitis as evidenced by prolonged periods of total limb paralysis in affected animals. This aggravation of disease signs is probably related to the inhibition of effector Ts function by mAb 14-12 thus allowing T cell autoreactivity to proceed unchecked. Disease course was influenced more favorably by i.v. administration of mAb 14-30 reactive with a subset of inducer TsF. Ten days of treatment with this mAb resulted in a reduction in the incidence and severity of disease, noted as the development of minimal limb weakness but no paralysis in the majority of affected animals. Adoptive transfer experiments revealed the presence of Ag-specific Ts in mAb 14-30-treated mice that inhibited recipient Lyt-1+ responses to myelin basic protein, the immunizing autoantigen. Suppression by transferred Ts was revealed only by treatment of the donor population with anti-Lyt-1.2 plus C, however, indicating a role for contrasuppressor activity in the regulation of autoimmune T cell function. Results are considered relevant to the potential for immunotherapeutic management of multiple sclerosis in man.\r"

  ".W": "The genetic susceptibility to murine alpha TBM disease is a dominant trait that maps to H-2K. In previous studies we have shown that the critical difference between susceptible (SJL) and nonsusceptible (B10.S(8R] mice is the phenotype of the tubular Ag-specific effector T cells (TDTH). In SJL mice, these TDTH are Lyt-2+, whereas in B10.S(8R) mice the TDTH are L3T4+. These phenotypic differences have an important functional correlate: Lyt-2+ TDTH are nephritogenic, whereas L3T4+ TDTH are typically not nephritogenic. Both mouse strains have the potential to differentiate both L3T4+ and Lyt-2+ TDTH. The preferential selection of a single TDTH phenotype in each is the result of differential T cell regulation. In the present studies, we have examined the contribution of suppressor and contrasuppressor T cells in the regulation of TDTH phenotype selection. Our studies show that in both SJL and B10.(8R) mice, after exposure to Ag, a suppressor T cell subpopulation functions to inhibit the nephritogenic Lyt-2+ TDTH. In SJL, but not B10.S(8R) mice, this suppression is counterbalanced by Lyt-2+, Vicia Villosa lectin-adherent T cells. Such contrasuppressor function is mediated through a T cell-derived soluble protein (TcsF), which is Ag-binding and recognized by alpha I-JS antisera. This functional TcsF activity maps, as does susceptibility to disease, to H-2K. In the presence of genetically compatible TcsF, the TDTH phenotype in nonsusceptible mice switches to that of susceptible mice. These Lyt-2+ TDTH from nonsusceptible mice are fully capable of inducing tubulointerstitial nephritis following adoptive transfer. Our studies describe a new role for Tcs cells and augment our understanding of their etiopathogenetic role in autoimmunity.\r"

  ".W": "The regulatory function of peripheral blood CD4 T cells correlates with the presence or absence of the membrane glycoprotein recognized by anti-Leu-8 antibody; CD4,Leu8- T cells help Ig synthesis and CD4,Leu-8+ T cells suppress Ig synthesis. In contrast to CD4 T cells from the peripheral blood and organized gut-associated lymphoid tissues, intestinal lamina propria CD4 T cells were found to have diminished expression of the Leu-8 Ag. Therefore, studies were performed to determine whether the decreased expression of the Leu-8 Ag on lamina propria CD4 T cells correlates with a difference in the ability of peripheral blood and lamina propria CD4 T cells to regulate PWM-stimulated Ig synthesis. At high T cell to non-T cell ratios, the helper function of lamina propria CD4 T cells was significantly higher than that of peripheral blood CD4 T cells. When CD4 T cells were incubated with anti-Leu-8 antibody, the suppressor function of peripheral blood CD4 T cells was increased, but lamina propria CD4 T cells did not suppress Ig synthesis. No difference was found between the helper function of CD4,Leu-8- T cells and the suppressor function of CD4, Leu-8+ T cells isolated from either the peripheral blood or the lamina propria. Thus, the difference in the regulatory function of CD4 T cells from the peripheral blood and the lamina propria is due to the quantitative difference in CD4,Leu-8+ T cells in these sites. Consequently, the intestinal lamina propria is a site enriched in CD4,Leu-8- T cells which predominantly mediate help for Ig synthesis.\r"

  ".W": "The production of B cell-stimulating factors (BSF) by B cells in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) was studied in vitro. B cells from SLE patients markedly proliferated and differentiated into Ig-producing cells by in vitro culture without any stimulation. The culture supernatant of these B cells contained BSF activity that stimulated Staphylococcus aureus Cowan I-treated normal B cells to proliferate and differentiate into Ig-producing cells. By a Percoll gradient density centrifugation, BSF-producing cells were enriched in the higher density fraction, but were reduced in the lower density fraction. The BSF also stimulated the proliferation and the differentiation of SLE B cells. By a Percoll gradient density centrifugation, SLE B cells responsive to the BSF were enriched in the higher density fraction, but were reduced in the lower density fraction. The Mr of the BSF was estimated as about 18,000 Da by Sephacryl S-200 column chromatography. The BSF fraction did not possess IL-2 and IFN activity, but possessed IL-1 activity, which stimulated murine thymocyte proliferative responses. The BSF activity was partially, but not completely, absorbed by an anti-IL-1 alpha antibody. Furthermore, the BSF possessed IL-4 activity, which induced not only the proliferative responses of normal B cells stimulated with B cell mitogens, but also the expression of low affinity Fc epsilon R/CD23 on normal B cells. The BSF also possessed IL-6 activity, which induced the proliferative responses of IL-6-dependent hybridoma cells, MH-60 BSF2. Moreover, human rIL-1, rIL-4, and rIL-6 stimulated SLE B cells. These results suggest that SLE B cells spontaneously produce the BSF such as IL-1 alpha, IL-4, and IL-6 and express their receptors on their surface, and the interaction between the BSF and their receptors stimulates SLE B cells to spontaneously proliferate and differentiate into Ig-producing cells as an autocrine mechanism.\r"

The purpose of this study was to evaluate local TNF and IL-1 beta gene expression in vivo in the kidneys of MRL-Ipr mice with autoimmune lupus nephritis. TNF mRNA was detected in the renal cortex of MRL-Ipr mice but was not present in the cortex of normal congenic MRL-++ or C3H/FeJ mice. MRL-Ipr mice with lupus nephritis expressed higher amounts of TNF mRNA compared with MRL-Ipr mice prior to disease. In addition, freshly isolated, unstimulated glomeruli from MRL-Ipr mice with nephritis were found to secrete detectable levels of TNF, whereas glomeruli from MRL-++ mice did not. IL-1 beta mRNA, present in the renal cortex of C3H/FeJ, MRL-++, and young MRL-Ipr mice with normal kidneys, was also more abundantly expressed in MRL-Ipr mice with nephritis. Cultured macrophages from glomeruli of mice with nephritis were found to express TNF and IL-1 beta mRNA and product. These macrophages are prominent only in MRL-Ipr mice with renal disease and are the likely source of increased gene expression for both cytokines.\r"

  ".W": "The murine IL-3-dependent mast cell line, PT18-A17, and the rat basophilic leukemia cell line, RBL-2H3, were found to mediate natural cytotoxic (NC) activity via the release of a soluble factor which specifically lysed NC-sensitive WEHI-164 but not NK-sensitive YAC-1 tumor cells. The release of this NC cell-specific cytotoxic factor was enhanced by triggering of both types of cells via IgE receptor bridging. This factor had activity on TNF-sensitive but not TNF-resistant cell lines and could be neutralized by two independently produced polyclonal anti-mouse TNF antisera. It was not neutralized by antibodies against mouse IFN-alpha/beta or IFN-gamma. Moreover, it was not neutralized by a monoclonal or a polyclonal anti-human TNF, demonstrating that the rodent TNF differed antigenically from human TNF. These results indicate that the cytotoxic factor released from a murine IL-3-dependent mast cell line and from a rat basophilic leukemia cell line is immunologically and functionally related to murine TNF.\r"

In order to map the chromosomal location of the IL-4 gene, Chinese hamster-mouse somatic cell hybrids were used in Southern blot analyses with an IL-4 cDNA probe. These results suggested that the IL-4 gene was located on chromosome 11. In contrast, the gene encoding IL-2 was localized to either chromosome 1 or 3. The identification of a strain-specific Bgl II restriction enzyme polymorphism in the IL-4 gene was used to map the IL-4 gene to a position on mouse chromosome 11 within 1 centimorgan of the gene encoding IL-3.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of human rIL-6/B cell stimulatory factor 2 (hrIL-6/BSF-2) from Escherichia coli on murine Ag, SRBC-specific antibody responses were examined in vitro and in vivo. HrBSF-2 was effective in augmenting the primary and the anamnestic plaque-forming cells response to SRBC in vitro. The augmentation of the primary response was apparent when B cell-enriched spleen cells (B cells) were cultured with BSF-2 in the presence of IL-2. On the other hand, hrBSF-2 alone strongly enhanced the anamnestic response in a dose-dependent manner when spleen cells from SRBC-immunized mice were used. These effects of BSF-2 were abolished completely by anti-BSF-2 antibody, but not by normal rabbit Ig. Cell depletion experiments indicated that L3T4 (CD4)+ T cells, but not Lyt-2(CD8)+ T cells, and adherent cells (macrophages) have an important role in this BSF-2-induced augmentation of the response. In addition, kinetic studies showed that hrBSF-2 acts on B cells in the anamnestic response even when added relatively late in the culture. Finally, it was determined whether BSF-2 also could be active in modulating antibody responses in vivo. BSF-2 was shown to enhance the primary and secondary antibody responses in mice. The most apparent effect of BSF-2 was observed in the secondary response.\r"

In Jurkat cells, IL-1 did not activate phosphodiesterases as demonstrated by the lack of change of inositol triphosphate and diacylglycerol levels as well as the lack of change in cytosolic Ca2+ concentration. Furthermore, IL-1 did not modify the intracellular level of cGMP and cAMP, suggesting that the observed rise of PS synthesis could play the role of mediator IL-1 action. As PS is a necessary cofactor for the activation of protein kinase C, our results suggest strongly that IL-1 modulate protein kinase C activity in the activated lymphocyte through its action on PS synthesis.\r"
