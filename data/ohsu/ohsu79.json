  ".W": "Effects of cibenzoline (0.1-30 microM) on membrane potentials and currents were investigated in rabbit sinoatrial node cells using conventional microelectrode and double microelectrode voltage clamp methods. Cibenzoline reduced the heart rate, the maximum rate of rise and the action potential amplitude in a dose-dependent manner. At the same time, the action potential duration at half-amplitude was prolonged, and the slope of phase 4 depolarization was decelerated. The voltage clamp experiment revealed that cibenzoline (7-30 microM) depressed the slow inward current, the time-dependent potassium outward current and the hyperpolarization activated current. Neither the kinetic variable of the time-dependent potassium outward current nor the decay time of the outward current tail was altered by the drug perfusion. The results suggest that cibenzoline exerts a depressant effect on the electrical activity of sinoatrial node cells and that the depression of the currents induced by cibenzoline is due to a reduction in conductances of the current systems.\r"

By measuring the renal Li clearance, the effects on proximal and distal nephron segments were separated, and peak responses were correlated to the maximal excretion rate of furosemide in the urine. At the highest dose of furosemide, fractional Na excretion was increased from 1 to 19%, due to inhibition of fractional proximal Na reabsorption from 65 to 40% and fractional distal Na reabsorption from 97 to 57%. Furosemide inhibition of fractional proximal Na reabsorption showed a maximum at intermediate doses (7.5 mg/kg), whereas there was no maximum for the inhibition of distal fractional Na reabsorption. The natriuretic response was shorter than expected from the decline in furosemide excretion due to an abrupt fall in glomerular filtration rate and a rapid normalization of proximal fractional Na reabsorption. It is suggested that the maintenance of a normal delivery of tubular fluid to the distal nephron during furosemide-induced volume contraction may be due to inhibition of proximal tubular reabsorption.\r"

However, the volume of the dominant follicle, the maximum serum estradiol levels, the number of ampules of Pergonal given and the ovum fertilization rate were not significantly different in one- and two-ovary patients. The mean number of embryos transferred was 3.9 +/- 1.9 in one-ovary patients and 4.5 +/- 1.8 in two-ovary patients (NS). Two pregnancies occurred in one-ovary patients (8.3% per laparoscopy) and 13 in two-ovary patients (12.9% per laparoscopy).

  ".W": "A 30-year-old woman with a virilizing lipid tumor was initially suspected of having adult-onset congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) when her plasma 17-hydroxyprogesterone (17OHP) concentration was found to be very high (298-3,170 ng/dL), to drop in response to an overnight dexamethasone (dex) suppression test (79 ng/dL) and to rise briskly 15 minutes after ACTH administration (751 ng/dL). However, the effect of dex was not sustained or complete: the pregnanetriol excretion dropped only from 5.5 to 4.4 mg daily. Furthermore, the plasma testosterone was inappropriately high (235-537 ng/dL) for adult-onset CAH and was more responsive to endogenous and exogenous gonadotropin stimulation than to ACTH. In addition, there was no evidence of 11 beta-hydroxylation of 21-deoxycorticoids, as would be expected in CAH. Removal of the tumor completely reversed the virilization and the abnormal responses to ACTH and human chorionic gonadotropin. The contralateral ovary bore lipid-laden stromal cells in the deep paracortex that bore a striking resemblance to the tumor cells, and a cyst in that ovary had fluid with a steroid pattern virtually identical to that of the tumor, with an androstenedione: 17OHP ratio of 5:1. There was not evidence of polycystic ovary disease. The clinical picture of type II polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) gradually evolved over a one-year period postoperatively: plasma-free testosterone became mildly elevated and was not dex suppressible. The 17OHP response to ACTH became slightly excessive. However, there was no evidence of tumor on computed tomography.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Sixteen patients with Raynaud's phenomenon (8 with primary Raynaud's, 8 with systemic sclerosis including 3 patients with CREST) were treated for 4 weeks in a double blind crossover study with nifedipine, 20 mg twice daily. Treatment resulted in improvement of symptoms (p less than 0.05), a lower frequency of attacks (p less than 0.05) and a tendency to a shorter duration of the attacks. Photoelectric plethysmography during nifedipine treatment showed greater amplitudes on cooling (p less than 0.05) and a better and faster recovery on rewarming (p less than 0.05) than during placebo. The immediate effect of nifedipine, 10 mg sublingually, on the amplitude of the plethysmogram, finger temperature, heart rate and blood pressure did not correlate with the effect of maintenance treatment. Dose titration based on therapeutic effect and side effects resulted in a dose of 20 mg daily for 5 patients, 40 mg for 7, and 80 mg daily for 3 patients. Longterm treatment (16-20 weeks) resulted in sustained efficacy, both by subjective and objective standards (plethysmography).\r"

The antigen remained insoluble in 400 mM acetic acid but was extracted from the cells with 400 mM hydrochloric acid. The antibody was not seen in sera from 2500 normal female blood donors, 120 patients with systemic lupus, 60 patients with rheumatoid arthritis, 15 patients with linear scleroderma or 25 patients with Raynaud's disease.\r"

Sixty percent of control animals exhibited small nubbin-like spurs at the medial tibial plateau. In partial meniscectomy animals, osteophytes occurred as early as 1 week, and in 7/9 (78%) animals after 4 weeks. Grade 2-4 synovial, perichondrial/periosteal thickening, cell proliferation and vascularity were seen. Soft tissue and bone responded in parallel.

There were more newly synthesized proteoglycans than endogenous uronic acid containing proteoglycans found in the A1 fraction generated by associative CsCl density gradient centrifugation. Thirty-five percent of the proteoglycans in the A1 fraction were shown to elute in the void volume on Sepharose CL-2B, under associative conditions. Reduction and alkylation of the A1 fraction indicated that the endogenous proteoglycan monomer was hydrodynamically smaller than the newly synthesized macromolecule. This was confirmed by a Sepharose CL-2B chromatography of the A1D1 fraction. In comparison to endogenous proteoglycans, the newly synthesized proteoglycan monomers were less capable of forming stable aggregates with exogenous hyaluronic acid. We also found a statistically significant decrease (p less than 0.05) in the amount of already existing proteoglycan subclass when compared to the amount of newly synthesized proteoglycans in the most dense A1D1 fraction. By contrast, a statistically significant increase (p less than 0.05) in the amount of endogenous vs newly synthesized proteoglycans was seen in the A1D2 fraction but not in fractions of a lower buoyant density.\r"

Full thickness samples of articular cartilage, removed from the anteromedial, anterolateral and posterolateral areas of the femoral condyles of 2 normal knees, were placed in tissue culture separately. The incorporation of 14C-glucosamine into matrix molecules, especially proteoglycan, was measured. Three slices of each area were removed after one, 3 or 6 weeks of in vitro culture. The extracted matrix molecules and the media were analyzed and the relative amount of radioactive proteoglycan and proteoglycan aggregates, as well as the total amount of radiolabelled proteoglycan/mg dry weight, were calculated. A progressive increase in these variables during the culture period was demonstrated, suggesting an attempt at repair of the articular cartilage in this in vitro condition. No differences in the incorporation dynamics were found between the anteromedial, anterolateral and posterolateral areas of both subjects.\r"

The ratings of the individual components of clinical competence were correlated moderately with examination performance and very highly with each other. The individual components that were less dependent on medical knowledge (for example, interpersonal skills or humanism) had slightly smaller correlations with examination performance. The ratings of overall clinical competence were also related moderately to examination performance. Changes in the pattern of the ratings over time indicated that fewer candidates were receiving lower ratings while more were receiving higher ratings. The pass rates for each rating level were the same or lower; for example, the pass rate for candidates rated 5 was 68 percent in 1980 and 56 percent in 1985. The similar ranking of examinees by the program directors and the examination provides evidence for the validity of the examination.\r"

A total of 223 residents from four residency programs were surveyed; 181 responded. Most (86 percent) had educational debt (mean = $20,500), and more than half of those with debt were making loan payments. Forty percent of the residents moonlighted, and moonlighting was related to the presence of educational debt, monthly loan payments, and number of dependents.\r"

An education program with specific topics covered and modeled after continuing medical education programs for practicing physicians was instituted for residents in a university hospital clinic and was evaluated. The program was effective in improving the residents' knowledge, in enhancing their attitudes toward the clinic, and in improving their performance of influenza vaccinations. No adverse effects of the program were found. This approach, in which a curriculum is carefully defined and participation of the house staff is required, makes the ambulatory medical education process more accountable for what is taught.\r"

Recruitment strategies increased the proportion of minority students to 54 percent in the first year of the program and to 44 percent in the second year. The number of years of postsecondary education and clinical experience acquired by the minority students before admission to the program tended to have less impact on their performance in training than did their prior completion of formal academic degree programs and prior level of clinical responsibility. Attrition was higher for the minority students than nonminority students, and the minority students took longer than nonminority students to complete the program. The rates at which the students passed the certifying examination of the National Commission on Certification of Physician's Assistants were comparable for the two groups. Minority graduates tended to practice in areas of health manpower shortage.\r"

A critical issue in maintaining a stable patient population for such teaching is patient satisfaction. In the study reported here, the authors examined the factors determining patients' satisfaction. A questionnaire was mailed to a representative sample of 10 percent of the patients in a family practice in a family medical center. Seventy-eight percent of the sample responded; these respondents were representative of the sample population. Four variables were identified as significant in determining the patients' satisfaction: whether the patients felt that the time spent with their identified family physician was adequate and that the physician's explanations regarding their health care and the teaching program were clear; whether the patients felt comfortable in expressing their concerns about the teaching program to the permanent staff members; whether the patients had a positive attitude regarding the teaching program; and whether the patients felt that their identified family physician was available to them.\r"

The results were fed back to the lecturers, and each lecturer was subsequently interviewed. The interviews revealed that 60 percent of the lecturers had not correctly interpreted the analysis. Half of the lecturers expressed interest in improving their performance, and 20 percent of the lecturers requested specific, detailed guidance in overcoming problems. The author concludes that multivariate analysis of student ratings can generate feedback specific enough to guide teacher improvement but that it is essential to present the information to the faculty in conjunction with individual discussions.\r"

In the study reported here, the authors hypothesized that alcohol-related training and experience would influence practice behavior more significantly than attitudes or knowledge. In order to assess the most important predictors of practice behavior, the authors conducted a survey of 163 junior and senior medical residents at five training hospitals affiliated with Harvard Medical School. Of these residents, 123 responded (75 percent). Negative attitudes toward alcoholics and knowledge of alcoholism were not significantly related to the residents' estimates of the prevalence of alcoholism among their patients, to their rate of treating alcoholic patients, or to their rate of referring patients for alcoholism therapy. There was a significant relationship between having supervised clinical experience in alcoholism and these three behaviors. These results are consistent with the authors' hypothesis that changing physicians' practice in treating alcoholics may be best achieved by providing relevant clinical experience in alcoholism.\r"

However, many students may be reluctant to seek help for stress-related problems because they are concerned over the ramifications such a decision may have on their career opportunities. The purpose of the present study was to determine the extent to which an applicant's history of having received psychological counseling for stress-related problems influenced residency program directors' perceptions of such applicants seeking admission to residency programs. Five hundred twenty-three residency directors in six medical specialties (pediatrics, internal medicine, family medicine, psychiatry, obstetrics and gynecology, and surgery) rated a hypothetical residency applicant. The student's gender and history of psychological counseling were manipulated, but their basic qualifications remained constant. The directors rated the likelihood that they would invite the student for an interview and accept the applicant for the residency. Analysis of variance showed that the directors in pediatrics, family medicine, and psychiatry viewed the hypothetical applicant more favorably overall than directors in internal medicine, obstetrics and gynecology, and surgery. The program directors rated female applicants more favorably than their male counterparts and had a strong bias against inviting for an interview or accepting into their programs students who had a history of psychological counseling. Implications of these findings are discussed.\r"

In the study reported here, medical students read one of four patient vignettes. The vignettes were identical in content except that the patient was identified as having either AIDS or leukemia as either homosexual or heterosexual. The students then completed a set of objective measures that assessed their attitudes toward the patient portrayed in the vignette. Multivariate and univariate analyses of variance of their responses revealed that the students held negative and prejudiced attitudes toward both the AIDS and homosexual patients. This finding suggests that medical educators should recognize that many students have stigmatizing, negative attitudes toward homosexuals and patients with AIDS. These educators should promote greater sensitivity, knowledge, and understanding among medical students of those at risk for AIDS and AIDS patients.\r"

Changes in the qualifications of medical school applicants were analyzed in terms of age, sex, and ethnicity or racial group using two measures of quality: Medical College Admission Test (MCAT) scores and grade-point averages. The distributions of these measures for 1981 and 1985 applicants were compared. The results showed that there were significant but modest gains over the years in the percentage of men and women applicants who scored from 10 to 15 on the MCAT biology, chemistry, physics, and science problems subtests. There were also significant percentage gains for applicants in all age categories, except applicants over age 32, and for all ethnic or racial groups except blacks. The authors conclude that a variety of sociodemographic, educational, and selection factors may account for these changes.\r"

A significant association was found between the NBME examination scores and ratings in the cognitive areas of clinical competence. The graduates who scored 420 or less on the NBME Part I or the Part II examination received significantly lower medical knowledge ratings than did the total group of graduates. A similar analysis of NBME Part III examination scores was less clear-cut but also suggested that a score of 420 or less could identify those graduates at significant risk of receiving low knowledge ratings. When low ratings were used as an outcome measure, analysis showed that the NBME Part II examination was not sensitive in detecting such graduates. Based on these data, the authors do not propose changes in the passing standards for the NBME examinations but recommend that these standards continue to be reassessed and further measures be taken to strengthen the internal evaluation methods in medical schools.\r"

Questionnaires first used in a similar study in the 1960s were administered to freshman and senior medical students in 1981 and 1984 at one medical school. Comparison of these two groups indicated that the seniors viewed the elderly more positively than did the freshmen in certain areas, namely the productivity, social significance, and sexuality of the aged. To control for potentially confounding shifts in cultural values in society as a whole and in medical school selection variables, the two freshman groups were compared, and the two senior groups were compared. Results of these analyses indicated few, if any, differences between the freshman classes of 1981 and 1984 or between the senior classes of the same years. Finally, a longitudinal analysis was performed to contrast the attitudes of the students first sampled as freshmen in 1981 to their perceptions as seniors in 1984. Further, the results of the present study were compared with those of a similar study in the 1960s. Taken together, these results indicate that attitudes toward the elderly are becoming more favorable in society in general and in medical schools in particular and that the medical education process was responsible for the more favorable attitudes expressed by the senior medical students.\r"

On two occasions one to three years after the course, groups of students who took the course and groups that did not take the course responded to a test of knowledge of cancer, a cancer attitude survey, a clinical practice survey, and an evaluation of the course's relevance. Also, their clinical behavior was observed and coded during videotaped interviews of patients. While the students who took the course were more knowledgeable about cancer than their peers who did not, they did not have significantly more positive attitudes; nor were they significantly more likely to use prevention techniques in clinical settings. However, the more knowledgeable students--both those who took the course and the control students--had more positive attitudes than the less knowledgeable students. Those students who considered the course relevant to their training were more knowledgeable and had more positive attitudes toward cancer prevention than those who did not consider it relevant.\r"

The levels of serum transferrin (Tf) were examined simultaneously by nephelometric method in order to determine the correlation between humoral-phagocyte axis of immune system and nutritional status. It was found that PMN-CL and OI were generally lower in the greater than 35% TBSA burn group (PMN-CL, 1.85 +/- 0.21 cpm X 10(3), OI, 0.69 +/- 0.06) compared with control subjects (PMN-CL, 3.55 +/- 0.15 cpm X 10(3), OI, 1.05 +/- 0.04). It suggested that both neutrophil oxygenation activity and opsonic activity were impaired following severe burns. PMN-CL was higher in the smaller than 30% TBSA burn group during infection phase as compared with control subjects (5.61 +/- 0.26 cpm X 10(3) vs. 3.55 +/- 01.5 cpm X 10(3); p less than 0.01). It remained high in patients with persistent infection, but fell to normal if appropriate therapy was instituted. This result indicated that the neutrophils of the majority of patients with minor burns during acute infection were in an activated state both metabolically and functionally. The occurrence of sepsis was associated with a marked lowering of PMN-CL and OI values, but no difference was noted before and after the development of sepsis. The incidence of sepsis was 85.7% when PMN-CL was lower than 2 cpm X 10(3).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

However, patients who have sustained severe brain injuries (Glasgow Coma Score less than or equal to 8) treated in such a setting still have a substantial mortality. In order to determine if mortality is a function of severe brain injury, 545 trauma patients with and without severe brain injury were prospectively studied. All patients were similarly treated by one medical center from the actual site of injury until discharge from the hospital. There were 104 patients who had sustained major blunt trauma with severe brain injury and 441 patients who had sustained major blunt trauma without severe brain injury. The mortality of the former group was 30.8%, whereas that of the latter group was 0.9% (p less than 0.0001).\r"

Changes in hepatic function were studied in these patients. Transaminase levels showed abnormal elevations immediately after the injury but rapidly decreased to normal levels within about 40 days in both the patients who survived the injury and those who died. The alkaline phosphatase activity showed moderate gradual elevations with time, exceeding 20 K.A. units 10 days after the injury in those who died. The total bilirubin level increased to only about 4 mg/dl in those who survived but exceeded 8 mg/dl 10 days after the injury in about 80% of those who died. The total cholesterol level decreased below 100 mg/dl in those who died. In chloric cobalt reaction, the R-value shifted to the left in those who survived but to the right in those who died. Total plasma protein, which decreased to about 6.0 gm/dl immediately after the injury, gradually recovered in those who survived but further declined in those who died. Percentage of gamma-globulin increased but remained below 20% in those who survived but exceeded 20% within 10 days of injury in many of those who died. Hepatic functions 5 years after the injury were generally within the normal range.\r"

Three groups of spontaneously breathing animals were monitored with Swan-Ganz and arterial thermodilution catheters. Group I was pretreated with 80 U/kg of CVF iv 16-18 hours before testing. Group II received Ps. aeruginosa iv (2 X 10(8)/20 kg/minute). Group III was pretreated with CVF and later given the Pseudomonas infusion. The CH50 as a measure of complement activity was less than 7% of normal level in Groups I and III. No changes in respiratory variables occurred in Group I. In Group II, the mean pulmonary artery pressure doubled, intrapulmonary shunt fraction (Qs/Qt) increased, PaO2 decreased, and extravascular lung water doubled in 4 hours. In Group III, the pulmonary hypertension, hypoxemia, increase in Qs/Qt, and increase in EVLW were all significantly less than in Group II. Neutropenia occurred with the Pseudomonas infusion in Groups II and III.\r"

In previous studies, it was found that serum of burned humans and animals contained a substance(s) capable of interfering with red cell colony formation in vitro. Here are reported studies done in an attempt to characterize further the inhibitory activity. The molecular weight was more than 50,000 daltons by ultrafiltration. By gel filtration an inhibitory region was identified with an approximate molecular weight range of 140-290,000. Treatment of sera with proteolytic enzymes resulted in loss of activity suggesting that the inhibitory substance(s) was a protein. Ion exchange chromatography indicated that the inhibitor was an acidic protein. It is suggested that this material participates in the pathophysiology of the anemia of thermal injury by depressing red cell production.\r"

Combat conditions or mass casualty situations may dictate a delay in surgery because of higher priorities or lack of surgical facilities. A review of 178 abdominal wounded treated in an evacuation hospital during the 1973 and 1982 Israeli wars evaluates the effects of delay on mortality and complications. Surgery on 141 of the 178 abdominal casualties was delayed from 8 to 17 hours from the time of their injury. They were well supported hemodynamically along the chain of evacuation and none died en route. Mortality for the delay group was 5% and for the entire group 7.9%, which compares favorably with the 8.5% mortality during the latter part of the Vietnam War. Abdominal casualties who can tolerate delay in surgery are those who respond rapidly to vigorous volume replacement and remain stable with the aid of conventional supportive treatment.\r"

In 21 patients the operation was performed with Netz pins and in 25 patients with Kirschner pins. The fracture healing time did not differ between the two groups. Skin problems due to migration or rotation of the pins were seen in four patients operated with Kirschner pins; since the Netz pins are constructed so as to avoid pin migration, this did not occur with Netz pins. Skin pressure problems, or perforation related to the looped ends of the cerclage wires, were seen in two patients in each group. These complications are not influenced by the type of pins used. In one patient the Netz pins caused further fragmentation of a small bone fragment, due to their relatively wide borehead. Supported by the results in this study, we recommend the Netz pins in the treatment of olecranon fractures when using the tension-absorbing wire technique.\r"

One femoral artery cannula was connected to a blood pressure monitor for arterial systolic, diastolic, and mean pressures along with heart rate and ECG. The other catheter was used to bleed the animal down to and maintain a mean arterial pressure of 50 mm Hg for 2 hours. Blood samples were taken during the control period before bleeding, and at the end of the 2-hour shock period. Blood samples were analyzed for prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time, fibrinogen level, and platelet count. The combination of hemorrhagic shock and hemolysis produced DIC and a fatal shock. Pharmacologic doses (30 mg/kg-1) of methylprednisolone significantly prevent the DIC.\r"

Calculi in black male subjects occur at a younger age than in black or white female or white male patients. The most common organisms cultured in black patients with stones were Escherichia coli and Proteus mirabilis. In contrast to the white population the most common type of stone formed in black patients was struvite/carbonate apatite. Stones of this type accounted for a third of all stones in male and 44 per cent in female subjects.

Positive charges on the crystals apparently play a predominant role in the interaction. Removal of negatively charged sialic acid from the cell surface has little effect on crystal-induced enzyme release. Glucose-loaded liposomes release glucose upon exposure to calcium oxalate crystals when the liposomes are negatively charged but not when the liposomes bear a positive charge. Cytoplasts, which are devoid of granules, are severely damaged by calcium oxalate crystals. As with intact cells the damaging effect of the crystals on liposomes and cytoplasts can be counteracted by a polyanion. The results are consistent with the view that calcium oxalate crystals can cause enzyme release from polymorphonuclear leukocytes, mainly by a direct effect on the plasma membrane. The release might be due to an interaction of positive charges on the crystals with negative countercharges on the cells, possibly located in the phospholipid bilayer.\r"

The integrity of the surface mucopolysaccharide layer of the bladder has been shown to be crucial in preventing bacterial or crystalline adherence. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of bladder surface mucin integrity on tumor cell adherence and implantation. The adherence of tumor cells to in situ bladders which were either normal, injured, or injured and subsequently heparin-coated was studied using a radiolabeled tumor cell adherence assay. The mechanism of action of heparin in reducing tumor cell adherence and cytotoxic effects of heparin on tumor cells were evaluated. Finally, the ability of topical heparin to reduce tumor implantation rates on injured urothelial surfaces was studied. Urothelial injury by either dilute acid or fulguration resulted in markedly increased tumor cell adherence compared to normal. Topical heparin was capable of reducing cell adherence in injured bladders to control levels. Bladder coating with heparin rather than tumor cell coating was found to be the critical determinant in preventing tumor cell adherence. Heparin had no cytotoxic effects in any of the assays used. The implantation rate in heparin coated bladder was 19% compared to 50% in non-coated bladders. This study suggests that the bladder surface mucopolysaccharide layer plays a critical role in preventing tumor cell adherence and subsequent implantation. Restoration of this layer via exogenous topical heparin is capable of restoring the anti-adherence integrity to the bladder surface.\r"

The measured flow rates indicated that during cavernosography in papaverine-induced erection, the major effect of papaverine is to increase the resistance to venous outflow from the corpora cavernosa.\r"

Our investigation was performed to better define the effects of diabetes on the neuroendocrine sex accessory organ axis in the male rat. Rats were rendered diabetic, and were either left untreated or treated with insulin, testosterone or both. Diabetes resulted in decreased body and reproductive organ weights, as well as diminished sperm counts and motility and prostatic acid phosphatase. Seminal fructose was increased. A significant decrease in serum LH, FSH and testosterone was noted. Insulin treatment of the diabetic rats restored serum gonadotropins, reproductive organ weight, sperm counts and motility, and seminal fructose to control levels. Prostatic weight and prostatic acid phosphatase levels remained abnormal. Testosterone restored the above mentioned parameters to control levels, with the exception of LH. Treatment with insulin and testosterone had a synergistic effect on spermatogenesis. A GnRH stimulation test demonstrated that pituitaries of diabetic animals had a blunted response, with diminished LH and FSH secretion. In the diabetic animal, there are both pituitary and testicular abnormalities which may be responsible for reproductive dysfunction.\r"

The pulsed dye laser emitting at 504 nm. in one microsecond duration pulses appears to be the optimum out of a wide range of parameters tested. The laser is coupled to a 200 micron core fiber; this complete with its cladding has a total diameter of only 0.25 mm. Most calculi are fragmented by a series of pulses of up to 30 mJ. The system is used by firing bursts of pulses with the fiber actually in contact with the stone. The result is a very controlled fragmentation which is particularly suited to use in the confines of the ureter. This modality of treatment utilises less energy than ultrasound or electrohydraulic probes to fragment a stone and the very fine, flexible fiber represents a considerable miniaturization.\r"

  ".W": "The pulsed dye laser was used to fragment ureteric calculi in 10 pig ureters, compared to electrohydraulic disintegration in six pig ureters. The stones were impacted in the proximal ureter and approached by rigid ureteroscopy. Four ureters did not have stones impacted but had ureteroscopes passed. The stones were fragmented and the particles left to pass spontaneously. The degree of inflammatory reaction was graded at the site of fragmentation as well as in the middle and lower ureter. The degree of inflammation seen at the site of fragmentation was significantly less in the laser group than in the electrohydraulic group (p = 0.0027). It was noted that the degree of inflammation seen in the lower ureter was significantly greater than that seen at the site of fragmentation (p = 0.01), and that this grade of inflammation correlated well with the size of ureteroscope used (p = 0.0026). Further, the degree of dilatation of the ureter and pelvicalyceal system was significantly greater when the larger calibre ureteroscope had been used (p = 0.0056) ranging up to hydronephrosis with flattening of the papillae. If there is any parallel which can be drawn between the pig ureter and the human ureter then it suggests that ureteroscopy is more significant than the modality of fragmentation used. The contribution of the laser may therefore be more by the miniaturization of instrumentation which will be made possible than by any advantage it may have as a fragmenter.\r"

Half of the nephrostomy tracts were dilated using a semi-rigid 24F fascial dilating system (Amplatz design) and half were dilated using a 36F balloon dilation system. Animals were killed at six weeks and the nephrostomy tract was dissected, fixed in formalin, and microscopic cross-sections were stained with Masson's trichrome stain for collagen prior to morphometry using computerized planimetry. In this study, renal damage from the nephrostomy tract averaged 0.15% of the total renal cortical surface. Balloon dilation to 36F incurred no more significant damage than fascial dilation to 24F.\r"

Autonomic drugs were administered in the superfusate to examine their effect on noradrenaline release evoked by electrical stimulation. The general conclusions drawn from the data are that: there are two autonomic receptor systems on sympathetic nerve terminals of bladder neck--alpha-adrenergic receptors and muscarinic receptors, the activation of alpha-adrenergic receptors or muscarinic receptors depresses noradrenaline release and parasympathetic nerve excitement inhibits noradrenaline release in bladder neck.\r"

Of those injuries not requiring immediate surgical repair perforations within the pelvis (6 of 11) led to strictures more often than those beyond the pelvis (1 of 9). Treatment of the strictures with either an open repair or percutaneous antegrade dilation was successful.\r"

In patients with suspected interstitial cystitis the number of mast cells was increased significantly (p less than 0.001) compared to the 3 control groups.

Abnormalities of the bulbocavernosus reflex to stimulation of the vesicourethral junction correlated strongly with the presence of peripheral and autonomic neuropathy, diabetes and organogenic impotence.

To address this issue we evaluated 22 patients with clinical stage I testis tumors on a surveillance protocol with history, physical examination and semen analysis. Previous fertility was unknown or it had not been tested in the majority of the patients (74 per cent). Ten patients (45 per cent) had abnormal spermatogenesis on the basis of a low sperm count or sperm motility. Of 6 patients with oligospermia or azoospermia 3 had recovered normal spermatogenesis when they were re-evaluated 4 to 19 months later. Although in this group of carefully staged cases the incidence of subfertile sperm counts seems to be similar to those with higher stage disease, some patients with abnormal counts clearly recover. The avoidance of retroperitoneal lymph node dissection seems to spare fertility in at least a small percentage of these patients.\r"

Surgical/pathological localization of solitary metastases provides the most direct evidence of primary lymphatic spread. There were 214 consecutive patients with stage II disease (excluding bulky disease) evaluated with respect to localization relative to the side of the involved testis and the number of metastases up to 5 cm. Solitary metastases of 5 cm. or less were found in 74 patients, 53 patients had 5 or less lymph nodes of 2 cm. or less and 87 patients had more than 5 lymph nodes of between 2 and 5 cm. Solitary nodes of the right testis tumor were located with decreasing frequency in the upper and lower interaortocaval, lower paracaval and precaval, upper precaval and right common iliac, upper paracaval and upper preaortic zones. Primary deposits of the left testis tumor were seen predominantly in the upper para-aortic zone. Upper preaortic and lower para-aortic zones were involved infrequently, and other areas were affected only in rare cases. These data contradict the assumption of a testicular lymph center located at the openings of the testicular veins into the vena cava and left renal vein, respectively. Multiple metastases were spread over the entire retroperitoneum, except for the external iliac regions. Hilar/suprahilar metastases were seen infrequently. Ipsilateral areas are defined according to primary involvement. A modified retroperitoneal lymph node dissection within ipsilateral areas is proposed as a staging operation for clinical stage I disease and a radical retroperitoneal lymph node dissection is indicated for pathological stage II disease.\r"

Of these patients 95 were evaluated: 47 were randomized to the control group and received an intramuscular injection of 1.5 ml. of a 0.9 per cent solution of sodium chloride 1 hour preoperatively and 48 were given an intramuscular injection of 150 mg. netilmicin sulfate in a volume of 1.5 ml. 1 hour preoperatively. Of the patients 16 in the control group (34 per cent) and only 1 in the treated group (2 per cent) had bacteriuria (greater than 10(5) bacteria per ml.) (p less than 0.001). This difference also was significant 2 and 5 days postoperatively (p less than 0.05 and p less than 0.001, respectively). One patient in the control group had bacteremia compared to none in the treated group. Clinical signs of infection were less common in the treated group. Sensitivity studies revealed that all of the organisms tested were sensitive to netilmicin sulfate.

The relative distribution of Gleason grade and the positive versus negative margins among the 2 populations were similar. Using time to first evidence of distant disease as the endpoint of the study no difference in failure rates could be detected between the 2 populations. It is concluded that transurethral resection of the prostate does not enhance the appearance of metastatic disease.\r"

  ".W": "The usefulness of clinical stage, serum prostatic acid phosphatase and preoperative Gleason grade in predicting final pathological stage in patients with adenocarcinoma of the prostate remains controversial. To determine the predictive value of these 3 preoperative variables we reviewed 275 patients with clinically localized disease who were treated between April 1982 and February 1986. All patients were examined preoperatively and subsequently were operated upon by 1 urologist. Serum prostatic acid phosphatase was determined in all patients by the Roy method using thymolphthalein monophosphate as the substrate. The Gleason grade of each prostatic biopsy specimen was determined preoperatively by 1 pathologist, who also examined the final pathological specimen with respect to capsular penetration, and seminal vesicle and pelvic lymph node involvement. Using logistic regression analysis with the likelihood ratio chi-square test, clinical stage and Gleason grade had a direct correlation with capsular penetration (p less than 0.0001 and less than 0.0001, respectively), seminal vesicle involvement (p less than 0.0001 and less than 0.0001, respectively) and positive lymph nodes (p less than 0.0001 and less than 0.0002, respectively). Within the normal range of values (0.0 to 0.8 IU/l.) serum prostatic acid phosphatase correlated directly with capsular penetration (p less than 0.003) and seminal vesicle involvement (p less than 0.01) but not with lymph node involvement (p equals 0.08). Again with logistic regression analysis we determined that the best predictors of final pathological stage are not individual variables but models that use combinations of preoperative variables. The models generated are as follows: capsular penetration--serum prostatic acid phosphatase and Gleason grade (p less than 0.00001), seminal vesicle involvement--clinical stage and Gleason grade (p less than 0.00001), and lymph node involvement--clinical stage and Gleason grade (p less than 0.00001). With these models probability plots have been constructed so that the final pathological stage in patients with clinically localized prostatic cancer can be predicted preoperatively.\r"

Of the remaining 3 patients with microhematuria and no shock 1 had a minor renal laceration and 2 had renal contusions. All 3 patients were managed conservatively and all 3 were hospitalized chiefly for associated nonurological injuries. If the patients who presented with microhematuria and no shock were excluded from initial radiographic evaluation, 1 minor renal laceration and 2 renal contusions would have been missed. If we had added 1 more exclusion criterion, that of absence of major associated injuries, we would not have missed an injury.\r"

The mean duration of treatment was 3.6 years (range 4 months to 10 years) and the mean daily dose was 580 mg. piridoxilate, which contained 160 mg. glyoxylate. Calculi often recurred, with an average number of 9.9 per patient, and an open operation, shock wave lithotripsy or percutaneous nephrolithotomy was required in 22 patients (81 per cent). Oxalate excretion was 727 +/- 246 mumol. per day while on the drug and 382 +/- 201 mumol. per day after the drug was withdrawn. Whewellite was the major component of calculi in all cases but the stones exhibited a peculiar morphological arrangement, with multiple small indentations and a fine mamillary structure. Freshly voided urine specimens contained unusual crystals, which on infrared spectroscopy were composed of calcium oxalate trihydrate, a variety of crystal never observed previously in human urine. Piridoxilate-induced calcium oxalate nephrolithiasis is a new variety of metabolic drug-induced nephrolithiasis. Our observations suggest that even large doses of pyridoxine may be unable to prevent the excessive production of oxalate from glyoxylate.\r"

We evaluated renal irrigations with hemiacidrin in 13 carefully selected patients (15 kidneys). In this high risk population (6 patients were paretic) initial treatment was done in the hospital but the remainder of 18 periods of extended renal perfusion (mean period 20 days) were performed at home. The total number of outpatient days of perfusion in this group was 365. All patients experienced external leakage around the perfusion catheter. Fever of greater than 101F occurred in 14 of 18 perfusions (78 per cent). Rehospitalization was necessary during 3 perfusions (17 per cent) and serum magnesium was elevated 3 times (17 per cent). Stones were dissolved successfully in 14 of 18 perfusions (78 per cent) but they recurred in 3 patients. No patient had altered post-perfusion serum creatinine levels. Outpatient perfusion of the renal pelvis with 10 per cent hemiacidrin under carefully controlled conditions appears to be a safe and cost-effective treatment for struvite or phosphate renal calculi.\r"

Before 1969, 7 patients were hospitalized of whom 4 had nonsurgical management with total loss of function of the affected kidney, 2 had immediate nephrectomy and 1 died before treatment. Despite the nonfunctioning kidney no hypertension developed in 3 of the 4 patients followed for an average of 72 months. After 1969 when immediate radiological assessment and surgical management of main renal artery injuries were instituted 20 patients were hospitalized. Of 4 patients treated nonoperatively loss of function of the affected kidney resulted and hypertension occurred in 1, necessitating delayed nephrectomy, after an average followup of 3.5 months. Immediate nephrectomy was performed in 10 patients and vascular repair in 3. In both survivors who underwent vascular repair followup at 24 and 36 months, respectively, showed no hypertension but loss of approximately half of the function of the affected kidney. The other 3 patients died before treatment. Aggressive management reduced markedly the time from injury to diagnosis from a median of 48 hours before 1969 to 5 hours after 1969 but only a small number of patients were suitable for vascular repair, and this procedure did not restore complete function to the kidney.\r"

There was only a poor correlation between diuresis renography and the pressure flow study, and between the pelvic pressures during perfusion and forced diuresis. Impaired renal uptake fraction signifying the degree of obstructive nephropathy did not correlate with the dynamic tests. An Anderson-Hynes pyeloplasty was done in 19 patients. There was no correlation between the presence of organic stenosis or external compression and the outcome of the diagnostic tests. We concluded that the currently used diagnostic procedures for hydronephrosis generally are insufficient to discriminate between significant and nonsignificant obstruction.\r"

The endoscope was used to establish continuity successfully in 3 patients with an obstructed ureteropelvic junction. An instrument with a deflectable tip and some technique for irrigation are essential for intrarenal inspection and complete visualization of the ureter. This procedure is valuable in selected patients and it rapidly may become the technique of choice for the diagnosis of intrarenal filling defects.

The response rate was higher in patients receiving 100 to 120 mg. per m.2 per course than in patients receiving lower doses (all except 1 of whom received 60 or less mg. per m.2 per course) (86 versus 64 per cent) and it was higher in patients without prior radiotherapy or chemotherapy. The response rate in patients with previously untreated invasive transitional cell carcinoma was 88 per cent. Of the 33 patients 21 were alive at last followup, with a median duration of followup of 32 weeks. Toxicity was dose-related and local neurotoxicity was excessive at cisplatin doses of 100 to 120 mg. per m.2. Diabetic patients were particularly prone to have neurotoxicity. Other toxicity generally was not severe and consisted of ototoxicity, nephrotoxicity, myelosuppression, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea. Even elderly patients and patients with cardiac disease tolerated the treatment well. We plan to proceed with further intra-arterial cisplatin studies in which all patients except those more than 80 years old will be treated with an intra-arterial cisplatin dose of 90 mg. per m.2 per course combined with radiotherapy with or without cystectomy.\r"

  ".W": "Most surgeons consider erosion of any component of an inflatable penile prosthesis as an indication for total device removal. However, it has been our contention that in selected cases conservative management can be used and the device can be salvaged. In 32 patients with erosion of various device components we performed conservative salvage techniques, consisting of immediate component replacement, repositioning of the eroded component or removal of only the eroded component in conjunction with closed drainage and antibiotic irrigation. Early success with device salvage resulted in the development of a rigid protocol for patient selection and management. Salvage techniques were successful in 16 of 22 cases of scrotal pump erosion and in all 8 cases of reservoir erosion. In 2 cases of cylinder erosion salvage attempts failed.\r"

  ".W": "A carbon dioxide laser microsurgical technique for partial or complete resection of superficial lesions of the penis is described. This technique was used in 47 patients from January 1982 to May 1985. Of the 47 patients 32 (68 per cent) were treated on an outpatient basis. Histological study of the lesions showed microscopically invasive cancer in 8 patients, carcinoma in situ in 4, grades II and III dysplasia in 5, hyperkeratosis or parakeratosis in 10, pigmented lesions in 2, papilloma in 1 and no residual disease after systemic chemotherapy for exophytic carcinoma in 3. Laser surgery was performed in 1 stage under constant microscopic visual control. The depth of the resection ranged from 0.5 to 2.6 mm. (mean depth 1.5 mm.). Surgical specimens were fit for a correct pathological examination when they were thicker than 0.5 mm. (95.7 per cent of the cases). Microscopically, the margins of the resection resulted in healthy tissue in 41 of the 45 evaluable specimens (87.2 per cent). The mean distance between the lesion and incision borders was 0.6 mm. (range 0.4 to 1 mm.). Of the 4 patients with microscopic evidence of disease at the resected margins 3 underwent another laser microsurgical procedure and 1 received external beam radiation. Healing by secondary intention had an average duration of 6 weeks. Cosmetic results were satisfactory in every patient. Only 1 patient (2 per cent) suffered complications (arterial hemorrhage). In conclusion, the short-term results of this surgical technique for penile lesions are satisfactory. Further followup is needed to evaluate the curative potential of this method.\r"

However, the frequency of crystalluria was significantly greater in 49 patients in group 2 who required or had required surgical intervention for calcium stone disease than in group 1 (p less than 0.05). Calcium phosphate precipitates collected from 7 urine specimens by repeated centrifugation were studied by infrared, X-ray, thermal and electron probe analyses. The principal component of the precipitates was poorly crystallized apatite associated with some organic material. The precipitates from the 7 samples appeared as aggregates of fine spherules less than 1 micron. in diameter, and the calcium-to-phosphate molar ratio of a spherule ranged from 1.02 to 1.19. We conclude that not only calcium oxalate crystalluria but calcium phosphate crystalluria may have an important role in the formation of urinary stones.\r"

Bacterial size, adherence capability, competitive exclusion and inhibition of pathogenic growth were examined in selected strains of lactobacilli to assess their relative importance. We tested adherence to uroepithelial cells of 34 lactobacillus isolates originating from the urogenital tract, dairy sources and chickens, and 1 lactobacillus strain isolated from a commercially available preparation. The ability to adhere differed greatly among the 34 strains, with a range of 8 to 74 bacteria per cell, and the commercial strain attached poorly with a mean of 15 bacteria per cell. Eleven strains of lactobacilli were selected and found to differ in length and width dimensions. These strains were found to exclude competitively with varying efficiency 6 strains of uropathogens from adhering to uroepithelial cells. The effective ability of Lactobacillus casei GR-1 to exclude the uropathogens confirmed previous findings and other strains (GR-2, GR-3 and A-60) gave a similar range of exclusion. The lactobacillus isolates varied greatly in their ability to inhibit the growth of 11 uropathogens under the conditions of an agar overlay inhibition assay. A combination score was allocated to each of the 11 lactobacillus strains based on size, adherence, exclusion and inhibition. Lactobacillus casei GR-1 attained the highest score while the commercial strain attained the lowest score. The results of this study identified 4 properties that should be examined to select lactobacillus strains before embarking upon bacterial interference studies to prevent urinary tract and other infections in humans.\r"

Pelvic lymphadenectomy was performed 5 to 10 days after bipedal lymphangiography. Excised lymph nodes were separated one by one and an x-ray of each node was taken (lymphnodegram). The individual lymphnodegram was compared to the histological findings. Interpretations of lymphnodegrams from all 17 nodes with metastases were positive in 5, suspicious in 1, negative in 9 and radiolucent in 2. False negative judgments occurred chiefly because metastatic foci were microscopic. Two lymph nodes without metastasis were interpreted as positive for disease because of fat replacement of the nodes. These results indicated that lymphangiography is not suitable for the detection of early lymphatic metastases of carcinoma of the bladder or prostate.\r"

Incontinence occurred in 2 of our last 100 patients and there were no symptomatic urethral strictures. Complications were similar between patients who had and those who had not undergone transurethral resection of the prostate. Several technical considerations that contribute to these results are discussed, especially the use of perineal pressure to facilitate hemostasis and the technique of vesicourethral anastomosis. Radical retropubic prostatectomy is a relatively well tolerated procedure with low morbidity.\r"

This type of dialysis affords freedom and comfort, and lessens dependence. Furthermore, the over-all reduction in hospital-related cost of this therapy currently has made continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis the recommended procedure of choice at our institution. From July 1980 through May 1986 we offered this form of therapy to 45 patients between 4 days and 17 years old. A total of 68 Tenckhoff catheters were placed. Reasons for catheter removal included persistent peritonitis, tunnel infection, catheter leakage, catheter obstruction, successful kidney transplant, motivational failure, midline nephrectomy and death. Patient and parent instruction and indoctrination were critical factors in catheter survival. Our experience with the specific technical aspects of insertion documented that the single cuff, coiled Tenckhoff catheter and long, subcutaneous tunnel were definite advantages. These factors favored early use and long-term survival. The course of these patients with respect to nutrition, growth, emotional activity, infections and catheter survival is presented.\r"

Reconstruction in 29 patients involved procedures that changed the drainage of the recipient ureters for various reasons, including obstruction, reflux, undiversion and diversion. A neurogenic bladder was present in 26 patients and an additional 4 patients had a significant bladder pathological condition. Both ureters were dilated in 17 patients, while 1 was dilated in another 6.

Of the 7 complications 5 occurred in type I cases. Complications may arise from preserving or attempting to preserve a thin hypoplastic urethra. When the paper-thin type I urethra is associated with an abnormal meatus, the entire dysplastic urethra should be reconstructed. If the meatus is normal, clinical judgment must dictate which type I urethras may be preserved and which must be reconstructed.\r"

In such cases a proximal add-on neourethra can be fashioned from nonhair-bearing interscrotal tissue or ventral penile skin overlying the fibrous chordee-causing tissue. The end result is a Duckett transverse preputial tube that is anastomosed proximally to a Thiersch-Duplay neourethra and distally to the tip of the glans.

In 1971 partial colectomy and jejunectomy were performed for stage D (Duke classification) adenocarcinoma of the transverse colon. Despite this the patient remains alive and well with no evidence of residual or metastatic disease. The Muir-Torre syndrome is a subtype of the cancer family syndrome, with gastrointestinal tract tumors being the most frequent visceral malignancies. Urinary tract carcinomas are present in just more than 10 per cent of the cases. This entity is discussed and the literature is reviewed with emphasis on the urological associations.\r"

  ".W": "A partial obstruction of the left ureter was created in six-week-old rats. The effects on renal function were studied after three, nine and 15 weeks, first in normal hydration, and then after extracellular volume expansion. Moderate hydronephrosis without parenchymal weight reduction developed within three weeks. The hydronephrotic kidney i) excreted during normal hydration less urine and sodium than the intact one, because of increased reabsorption, ii) was capable of reacting fully on volume expansion and iii) had, after volume expansion, a higher renal blood flow and GFR but also a higher reabsorption of water, sodium, potassium and osmoles, resulting in excretions similar to those on the intact side. The differences noted were small (less than 20%) except for sodium excretion. The hydronephrotic kidney seemed to tolerate an increase in ureteral resistance better than the intact one would do. There were no significant differences between the three, nine and 15-week groups, with regard to the effects on the hydronephrotic kidney. Thus, except for a tendency to sodium retention, the effects of partial ureteric obstruction in young rats seem to be relatively harmless and do not increase with time.\r"

The study also provided information on possible neurotransmitter mechanisms. The results indicated that the erectile response is mediated by both the pelvic and hypogastric nerves, operating synergistically to evoke a seemingly maximum erection. Optimum erectile responses for either nerve system were obtained at 16 Hz and threshold responses at 0.5 to one Hz. In the presence of atropine, the erectile response to selective stimulation of the pelvic and the hypogastric nerves, respectively, were clearly curtailed, suggesting a cholinergic mechanism to be partly responsible for the diversion of blood from the penile \"resistance vessels\" to the cavernous bodies, possibly accomplished via the opening of vessels with a shunt-like function. However, the magnitude of the erectile response to combined pelvic and hypogastric nerve stimulation seemed to be surprisingly little affected by muscarinic blockade. Selective stimulations of the pelvic and the hypogastric nerves, respectively, were both found to cause about a five-fold increase in VIP output from the penis, coordinated in time with the local blood flow increase during erection. These data suggest a VIP-ergic neurotransmitter mechanism to be involved in penile erection in the cat, possibly controlling the dilation of the penile arterial \"resistance vessels.\"\r"

The murine bladder tumor cell line MBT-2 was used to evaluate the in vitro and in vivo antitumor effects of rTNF in combination with chemotherapeutic drugs targeted at DNA topoisomerase II. These drugs, such as adriamycin and etoposide (VP 16), are in widespread use in the treatment of human cancer. The rTNF significantly enhanced the cytotoxic efficacy of the topoisomerase-targeted drugs actinomycin D, adriamycin, etoposide (VP 16) and teniposide (VM 26) against MBT-2 cells in vitro. The rTNF alone had no effect upon the cells in the same assay. When examined in vivo using MBT-2 tumor-bearing C3H/HeJ mice, these same antitumor relationships were seen. The addition of rTNF to actinomycin D or VP 16 resulted in a significant reduction in tumor volume at 20 days compared to untreated animals. Actinomycin D, VP 16 or rTNF treatment alone had no significant effect on 20 day tumor volume. The data provide a reasonable basis for the addition of rTNF to experimental protocols for the treatment of human bladder cancer using topoisomerase-targeted drugs such as adriamycin both intravesically and systemically. These observations may also be relevant to other human cancers currently treated with these drugs.\r"

Low dose TNF (200 U), given in the form of TNS, failed to suppress the growth of established tumors (seven-day tumor). It did, however, significantly reduce tumor implantability.

Rats were partially cystectomized to determine whether bladder glycosaminoglycans are routinely eluted from the bladder surface in detectable quantities. Cystectomy produced no detectable qualitative or quantitative changes in excreted GAG thereby showing that most urinary glycosaminoglycan originates in the kidney and not from the bladder. Damaging the glycosaminoglycan layer by a dilute acid wash, however, leads to a consistent decrease in the output of urinary GAG which recovers to normal at the same rate as the layer regenerates. This suggests that the newly exposed sites tightly bind urinary GAG. We suggest that such binding may be a component of the normal physiological defense mechanism of the bladder. The bladder glycosaminoglycan layer was isolated, dilute acid being used to elute ionically-bound material and brief trypsinization to elute intercalated proteoglycans from the luminal surface. The GAG from the luminal surface, which was present at a density of one chain per 50 nm.2 of bladder surface, was quite different in composition from that isolated from the whole bladder.\r"

To evaluate the effects of smoking on the physiology of erection, we studied six healthy adult mongrel dogs in which bipolar cuff electrodes were implanted around the cavernous nerves. After threshold stimulation parameters for penile erection were established, cigarette smoke collected in a 60-ml. syringe was released slowly near the dog's mouth, to be inhaled by natural breathing. Stimulation of the cavernous nerve was repeated and blood samples for nicotine, cotinine and blood gases were obtained before and after each cigarette. The systolic and intracorporeal pressure, flow through the internal pudendal artery, and venous flow from the corpora cavernosa were recorded at baseline and with each electrostimulation after smoke inhalation. Five of the six dogs were unable to achieve full erection after inhalation of smoke from two to three cigarettes. Some decrease of flow through the internal pudendal artery occurred and the venous restriction ability was almost completely abolished by smoking. Further, when nicotine was injected intravenously into two additional dogs, the same phenomenon was observed. These findings support the idea that cigarette smoking may contribute to impotence in some patients.\r"

Experiments were performed before and after unilateral pelvic nerve transection. In control conditions and after unilateral pelvic nerve transection, the bladder neck was not tightly closed during the collecting phase, the membranous portion of the urethra opened and closed spasmodically during the emptying phase, and reflex micturition developed. Direct observation showed that after unilateral pelvic nerve transection, the ipsilateral bladder did not contract. A pressure flow EMG study showed that unilateral pelvic nerve transection produced a significant increase in threshold volume, threshold pressure, bladder compliance and residual volume, and a significant decrease in contraction pressure and flow rate. The present study shows that unilateral pelvic nerve transection has no demonstrable effect on urethral function, but has effects on bladder function during the collecting and emptying phases and that bladder innervation is unilateral in the dog.\r"

In order to explore the hypothesis that carcinogens (nitrosamines) may be a factor in ureterosigmoidostomy, female Sprague-Dawley rats (n = 125) underwent urethral ligation, bladder dome resection and anastomosis of the bladder trigone to an opening in the anterior rectosigmoid wall. Biweekly nitrosamine determinations were performed on the resultant urine-feces slurry by gas chromatography up to thirty-two weeks post surgery. Nitrosamine (N,N-dimethylnitrosamine) was noted as early as two weeks after surgery in 39% (11/28) of rats. One hundred percent of animals consistently demonstrated nitrosamine by week 14 (32 rats). Nitrosamine levels increased throughout the study with a peak level after thirty-two weeks of 0.275 micrograms./ml. Only a portion (n = 40) of the total animal population was deemed suitable for pathologic examination secondary to animal demise and autolysis at autopsy related to infection and obstruction. In these animals, no adenocarcinoma was found although hyperplastic changes and metaplastic changes were demonstrable at nine days and eight weeks respectively. In one animal a grade I transitional cell papilloma was identified after eight weeks. Control animals demonstrated no nitrosamine production. In vitro combinations of rat urine and feces yielded nitrosamine after six weeks. The absence of adenocarcinoma tumor development is believed indirectly related to animal demise in that not enough time had elapsed to allow significant tumor development. This study lends support to the concept that nitrosamines may play a role in the development of hyperplasia, dysplasia and eventual neoplasia in ureterosigmoidostomy.\r"

  ".W": "From April 1981 to April 1985, 128 limbs in 120 patients who had primary femoropopliteal bypasses were entered in a randomized comparative study. Grafts used were 56 randomized and five obligatory reversed saphenous veins (RSVs), 41 randomized and 24 obligatory superficial femoral-popliteal veins (SF-PVs), and two obligatory prosthetic grafts. The primary patency rates of randomized SF-PVs (64% at 3 years) and RSVs (60% at 3 years) were not significantly different. Similarly, there was no statistically significant difference in the secondary patency rates of 68% for SF-PVs and 63% for RSVs at 3 years. Combinations of obesity, hypertension, and poor medical condition mandated obligatory RSV use. Obligatory SF-PV use was necessitated by absence (eight cases) or inadequacy (16 cases) of the saphenous vein. Indications for bypass were critical ischemia (RSVs, 93% and SF-PVs, 92%) and claudication (RSVs, 7% and SF-PVs, 8%). Diabetes was present in 69% of patients with SF-PV bypass and 49% of those with RSV bypass. Limb retention, operative mortality, and patient survival rates were not significantly different with each graft. Continuation of the study as originally structured, with nonselective SF-PV use, became ethically untenable when it was appreciated that results in black patients and patients with excessively large grafts were markedly inferior and that construction of 3 cm moderately tapered anastomoses significantly reduced the incidence of distal anastomotic hyperplasia. These results, obtained during a period when important lessons about SF-PV use were being learned, indicate that during the first three years of observation after primary femoropopliteal bypass, the differences in cumulative primary and secondary patency rates of SF-PVs and RSVs were not statistically significant. Results in the most recent 76 SF-PV grafts, with primary and secondary patency rates of 82% and 89% at 3 years, provide a more realistic picture of the effectiveness of SF-PVs as primary femoropopliteal bypass grafts.\r"

The deposition of indium 111-labeled platelets on the vascular prostheses was studied 1 and 4 months after operation. In seven of nine patients seeding resulted in decreased accumulation of radiolabeled platelets compared with sham-seeded control limbs (p less than 0.04), when studied 1 month after surgery. A decrease in platelet accumulation occurred over the whole prosthesis between 1 and 4 months, and no significant difference was noted at 4 months between seeded and nonseeded graft limbs. Although the seeding density was very low (440 ECs/cm2), the observed difference in platelet accumulation for AES-treated graft limbs in the early postoperative course merits further investigation of this technique in human beings.\r"

In these animals the right external jugular vein was grafted into the right carotid artery. The cumulative dose-response to NE and 5-HT of rings of vein grafts 2, 4, and 6 weeks after insertion was compared with that of rings from the normal contralateral jugular vein by means of an organ bath to measure changes in isometric tension. With NE there was no significant difference in the response of vein grafts harvested at 2 weeks and control veins. However, at 4 and 6 weeks there was a progressive decrease in the sensitivity of the grafts to NE. The difference in ED50 values (ED50 defined as concentration of agonist required to elicit 50% of the maximal response) between control veins and vein grafts at 4 weeks was twofold and at 6 weeks it was fivefold. None of the control veins responded to 5-HT stimulation. However, the vein grafts contracted with 5-HT, exhibiting sigmoid dose-response curves. The vein grafts showed intimal hyperplasia, which was maximal after 4 weeks. These results show that vein grafts undergo a progressive decrease in their sensitivity to norepinephrine and develop a marked, sustained increase in sensitivity to 5-HT. This finding is in contrast to previous observations in intimal hyperplastic rabbit aorta, suggesting a fundamental difference in the functional expression of arterial and venous intimal hyperplasia.\r"

Variations in arterial and venous resistances and in anastomosis techniques are considered. With this model all possible AVFs can be compared in terms of risk (loss of distal perfusion pressure) and benefit (volume of fistula flow). According to our model the most efficient type of fistula is the end-to-end AVF at the wrist. In patients with abnormally high resistance of the arm arteries this fistula is inadequate for efficient hemodialysis treatment. To reduce the incidence of finger ischemia in more proximal AVFs our model indicates that the arterial anastomosis should be as proximal as possible and/or hemodynamically nonsmooth (i.e., side-to-side).\r"

Data from 45 respondents who had experience with thrombolytic infusion in 623 patients were reviewed. A successful outcome was obtained in 313 of 623 patients (50.2%). Morbidity was significant, with hemorrhage requiring transfusion or operation in 125 cases (20.1%) and major amputation in 103 cases (16.5%). There were nine strokes associated with thrombolytic infusion (1.4%), six of which were fatal. Sixteen deaths were associated with thrombolytic therapy, for a mortality rate of 2.5% (16 of 623 patients). Analysis of results by grouping centers according to numbers of lytic infusions failed to show significant correlation with center experience. Furthermore, morbidity and mortality were seen in centers with both limited and extensive experience with thrombolytic infusion. The initial enthusiasm for thrombolytic infusion to treat arterial ischemia is not substantiated by our data. Carefully controlled prospective trials are needed before this method can be offered as an alternative to arterial reconstruction.\r"

The studies included the evaluation of coaxial laser angioplasty in 10 partially or totally occluded arteries; the observation of the effect of perpendicularly applied laser energy on 35 thrombi, 54 soft and 10 hard atherosclerotic, and 51 normal arterial walls; the comparison of laser energy requirements for coaxial vessel lumen enlargement or recanalization vs. perpendicular penetration in 10 occluded, hard atherosclerotic arteries; and the spectrographic analysis of calcium density gradient in two specimens. The results showed that the power required for vessel lumen enlargement was 10 +/- 6 J/mm of atherosclerotic vessel (mean +/- standard deviation). The probe followed the original arterial lumen, did not perforate the vessel wall, and created a smooth, enlarged path. The power required to penetrate perpendicularly to a similar depth for thrombi, soft and hard atherosclerotic plaques, and normal arterial walls was 15 +/- 4, 30 +/- 15, 65 +/- 32, and 246 +/- 123 J/mm, respectively. In the hard calcified specimens, laser energy required for coaxial lumen enlargement or recanalization was significantly less than that for perpendicular penetration (p less than 0.05), which correlated with the calcium density map indicating an increase from inside to outside.\r"

All nine Greenfield filters were correctly placed in the inferior vena cava and produced significant clot lysis of 81.3% +/- 16.3% (p less than 0.001, paired t test). Difficulty was encountered in affixing the hooks of the bird's nest device into the vein wall and resulted in two filters not being inserted and two filters being placed too proximally. One set of hooked wires of another bird's nest device migrated to the right atrium despite correct insertion. Eight bird's nest devices allowed clot lysis of 83.4% +/- 17.7% (p less than 0.001), paired t test) but thrombus size was increased in one case. The Greenfield and bird's nest filters have comparable effects on trapped emboli, but the bird's nest filter may be susceptible to thrombosis and occlusion under certain circumstances. The pre-shaped hooked wires of the bird's nest device may be difficult to insert and may allow proximal migration after a large thrombus was trapped.\r"

The cumulative patency rate for 82 patients was 80% +/- 5% at 1 year and 67% +/- 7% at 2 and 3 years. The operation was most likely to be successful if the indication was claudication (p less than 0.05) and if the operation was performed as the primary procedure (p less than 0.01). There was no significant difference when patients with or without profundaplasty were compared. It is concluded that femorofemoral bypass is indicated to treat symptomatic unilateral iliac disease when transluminal dilatation is not possible. Femorofemoral bypass is also the procedure of choice for aortofemoral graft occlusion when the thrombosed limb cannot be reopened. Femorofemoral bypass is recommended for both high- and low-risk patients when indicated.\r"

In one third of these subjects, biochemical thyroid failure developed (thyroxine level less than 58 nmol/L [4.5 micrograms/dL]) within the course of the study. All subjects with initial TSH levels above 20 mU/L (microU/mL), and 80% of those with high-titer thyroid antimicrosomal antibodies (regardless of initial TSH level), became overtly hypothyroid. Compared with subjects with high-titer antibody, those with antibody titer less than 1:1600 had lower TSH and higher thyroxine levels, and thyroid failure developed in none during the study. These results suggest that among older patients with isolated elevations of the TSH level, only those with markedly elevated TSH levels or high-titer antimicrosomal antibodies should be prophylactically treated with levothyroxine sodium replacement.\r"

Prevalence of diastolic blood pressure greater than or equal to 105 mm Hg fell 26% and 70% in men and women, respectively, between 1950 to 1959 and 1970 to 1979. Prevalence of pressures greater than or equal to 95 mm Hg decreased 5% in men and 58% in women. Increasing control of hypertension had an almost inverse linear relationship with the decreasing incidence of stroke in women, but the incidence of stroke in men did not decrease until ten years after improvement in the control of blood pressure began. We conclude that improvements in the detection and control of hypertension contributed to the declining incidence of stroke and that differences in management of hypertension could account for the difference between men and women in the trend of stroke decline.\r"

Demographic and clinical characteristics of patients treated before implementation of the PPS were similar to patients treated thereafter. After implementation of the PPS, the mean length of hospitalization fell from 16.6 to 10.3 days, and the mean number of physical therapy sessions received decreased from 9.7 to 4.9. Concomitantly, the proportion of patients discharged to a nursing home increased (21% to 48%), as did the proportion receiving nursing home care at six months after discharge (13% to 39%). This increase in long-term nursing home placement suggests that the quality of care for elderly patients with hip fractures may have deteriorated.\r"

Blood pressure was also significantly raised by administration of 12.5 mg of oral phenylpropanolamine hydrochloride in five additional patients. We conclude that administration of 25 mg of phenylpropanolamine hydrochloride elicits a potent pressor response in patients with orthostatic hypotension and that significant hypertension may result.\r"

Three factors were identified that are particularly salient to future pediatric practice: demographic trends, decisions by third-party payers, and public attitudes toward services for children. Less than half as many children per pediatrician is predicted for the year 2000 compared with 1970. Pediatricians are likely to face future constraints on reimbursement, particularly for cognitive services and for providing care to the growing number of children in poverty. One moderating effect may be laws enacted at the state or federal level mandating basic insurance coverage for child health supervision services. The public interest in children's services will influence future access to pediatric care for children and the compensation that pediatricians receive for children in poverty. In light of these issues, organized medicine may seek means to adjust to and also to shape the environment in which pediatric practice is to occur in the future.\r"

  ".W": "When rising rates of occurrence are reported for a particular disease, clinicians often cannot determine whether the disease has increased in actual occurrence or in the improved detection provided by better diagnostic technology and expanded access to medical care. The epidemiologic use of necropsy data, which might help answer these questions, has been inhibited by fears of bias in demographic and clinical selection of patients for necropsy. The demographic problem can be managed by suitable adjustment and standardization of the disease rates found at necropsy, and the clinical problem can be reduced or avoided by studying the rates with which the disease is found unexpectedly in necropsies performed for other, unrelated clinical reasons. The results, obtained in population groups \"screened\" via necropsy, can suggest the magnitude of the \"undetected reservoir\" that coexists and supplements the rates of reported occurrence for a disease. In a study of necropsies at Yale-New Haven (Conn) Hospital from 1972 to 1981, the necropsy detection rates for lung cancer were slightly higher for women than for men, and were substantially higher for both genders than the customarily reported rates in the general population. The results suggest that the reported rates may continue to rise in both genders until they become essentially equal at a size approximating that of the currently undetected reservoir. The \"epidemiologic necropsy\" offers a potentially valuable method to help distinguish the true occurrence rates of disease from the changes attributable to improved diagnostic detection with modern technology.\r"

In a random sample of more than 18,000 men who entered the service between 1965 and 1971, there were 446 postservice deaths through Dec 31, 1983. For 426 of these deaths, we obtained both the death certificate and all other available medical and legal records pertaining to cause of death. A nosologist recorded each death certificate in accordance with the ninth revision of the International Classification of Diseases. A medical panel, without having access to the death certificates, assigned underlying and contributory causes of death on the basis of a review of only the medical and legal records. The panel recorded 133 alcohol-related deaths, or more than six times the number (21 deaths) determined by the original death certifiers. Omission of elevated blood alcohol levels in deaths due to injury accounts for most of the underreporting of alcohol-related mortality on the death certificates. Our findings suggest that death certificate data grossly underestimate the contribution of alcohol to mortality, especially in the area of injury, and the validity of official vital statistics for alcohol-related deaths would be enhanced if death certifiers incorporated all available antemortem and postmortem diagnostic information.\r"

Licensed laboratories in Illinois provided the sample. An accuracy score on the College of American Pathologists proficiency tests was calculated for each laboratory. The accuracy score of a subgroup of laboratories employing all (100%) certified medical technologists was compared with the accuracy score of a subgroup of laboratories employing only noncertified medical technologists. Those laboratories employing only certified medical technologists had a mean accuracy score of 95% (SD = 4%), while laboratories employing only noncertified medical technologists had a mean accuracy score of 75% (SD = 30%). The Mann-Whitney U test was used to identify differences between the two groups of laboratories. A difference in the accuracy scores between the two groups of laboratories was statistically discernible. Since most laboratories employ some certified medical technologists, a second analysis considered the relationship of the proportion of certified medical technologists employed in the laboratory and accuracy on College of American Pathologists proficiency tests. A significant positive Spearman rs correlation confirmed a relationship between employing a higher proportion of certified medical technologists and accuracy of test results.\r"

During the past decade, the pathology specialty has been subject to extensive regulation, placing a new focus on the role of the laboratory within the hospital and generating new ventures for the provision of pathology services. A continuing challenge to the specialty is management innovation and adaptation in the face of regulatory restrictions and cost-containment experiments. The significant forces for change affecting the demand for services and the shape of future provision of pathology services include rapid advances in technology and scientific knowledge, funding for biomedical research, training for research pathologists, demographic trends in the population, and medical liability trends. Finally, with renewed emphasis on quality of care in the health professions, the pathology specialty has the potential to make substantial contributions to the quality and art of medical practice and is likely to remain at the center of efforts to refine methods of quality assessment and implementation.\r"

Delta virus infection was found in 24% of asymptomatic hepatitis B virus carriers, 29% of acute nonfulminant hepatitis B cases, 74% of fulminant hepatitis B cases, and 100% of chronic hepatitis B cases. Chronic delta virus infection occurred primarily in older children and adults, while acute and fulminant delta virus infection occurred in young children as well. In fulminant hepatitis cases, delta virus superinfection of hepatitis B virus carriers was the most common serological pattern; histopathologic examination showed features identical to those described in fulminant hepatitis cases of similar etiology in Colombia and Venezuela. Delta virus infection is highly endemic in the southern Amazon Basin and is the principal cause of Labrea hepatitis.\r"

Two hundred twenty-two patients, ranging in age from 21 to 69 years, with an average standing diastolic blood pressure between 91 and 104 mm Hg participated in this trial. At the end of 12 weeks, the percentage of patients who had a decrease in their standing diastolic blood pressure of 5 mm Hg or more was statistically similar in both of the active-treatment groups and significantly different from the placebo group. With the lower-dose compound, the metabolic side effect of hypokalemia was less of a problem and there was no evidence of glucose intolerance. Thus, this new 15-mg formulation of chlorthalidone appears to be an effective antihypertensive agent with fewer metabolic side effects compared with the standard 25-mg dose in the management of mild essential hypertension.\r"

  ".W": "Urinalysis results are increasingly being used by employers to detect use of prohibited substances in the workplace. Actions taken on the basis of positive urinalysis results can have a significant effect on employees' lives and careers, and may face legal challenge. Important aspects of urinalysis are choice of analytical methods and their legal defensibility. Medical directors are frequently required to select testing laboratories, but have had few data correlating analytical methods with legal defensibility. To evaluate the legal defensibility of the methods used for drug testing, we conducted a survey of technical experts, testing laboratories, and arbitrators. Experts reported wide differences in the legal defensibility of methods rated. Arbitrators had considerable experience in drug use cases and understood the critical role of urinalysis results, but were unable to distinguish legal defensibility of analytical methods. Commercial laboratory practice in urinalysis varies widely among laboratories. An objective of this article is to provide company medical directors with information that will enable them to make informed decisions when choosing urinalysis laboratories and methods.\r"

We report two cases in intravenous methamphetamine users who presented with abnormal liver function values, low hematocrit values, basophilic stippling of red blood cells, and elevated blood lead levels. Both patients excreted large amounts of lead in their urine after treatment with edetic acid, followed by resolution of their symptoms. Lead contamination was proved in one drug sample. Basophilic stippling of the red blood cells was the one key laboratory result that led to the definitive diagnosis in both cases.\r"

All other amino acids were maintained at levels sufficient for normal HTSCA tumor colony growth. Twenty-two amino acids were tested at a mean concentration of 12% (range 3% to 35%) of their normal plasma level. Results indicated that all amino acids except L-glutamine and L-asparagine were present in sufficient quantity for normal tumor growth. Dose-response curves have shown more than 70% inhibition of tumor growth with a glutamine concentration of 50% and an asparagine concentration of 25%. Glutamine and asparagine levels of 4% and 1%, respectively, resulted in 100% inhibition. The data indicate that rat sarcoma stem cells are sensitive to decreased glutamine and asparagine concentrations.\r"

The reformulated product contained higher concentrations of magnesium (Mg), potassium (K), phosphorus (P), selenium (Se), and zinc (Zn) and lower concentrations of calcium (Ca), sodium (Na), and unsaturated fats. Diet records, blood samples, and urine specimens were collected from each subject. Mean intakes of Mg, K, and Zn increased significantly when subjects were switched to the reformulated product. The subject's mean intakes of Se (for all age groups) and Zn (children 11 to 14 yr old) were below 67% of recommended intakes while they were ingesting the original formula. The mean trace metal concentrations of urine, blood, and serum did not differ significantly during the two periods. Mean serum Zn, Se, and Cu concentrations of the subjects were less than those reported for normal children. Significant negative correlations were obtained between serum Zn concentrations and the molar ratio of dietary (Ca + P):Zn, and the molar ratio of dietary Fe:Zn. No significant differences in mean urinary Cu and Zn excretion (mg/g creatinine) were observed in subjects after they were changed to the reformulated product. Individuals whose primary source of energy and protein is derived from semi-synthetic elemental diets are especially at risk for multiple trace element deficiencies.\r"

Basal energy expenditure (BEE) was also predicted by the Harris-Benedict equation. In order to correlate REE to lean body mass, the 24-hr urinary creatinine was measured in patients with ELD and in normal controls and expressed as kcal/g urinary creatinine. Linear regression analysis showed a statistically significant (p less than 0.0001) correlation (r = 0.72) between the REE and the 24-hr urinary creatinine in normal controls, irrespective of age and sex. Mean BEE (1580 +/- 160 vs 1575 +/- 210) and REE (1755 +/- 215 vs 1800 +/- 330) were not significantly different between patients with ELD and controls. However, the mean REE was 1900 +/- 610 kcal/g creatinine in patients with ELD and 1180 +/- 260 (p less than 0.0001) in controls. When related to lean tissue, patients with ELD had increased energy expenditure, confirming the hypermetabolic state suggested on clinical grounds. The use of urine creatinine to estimate energy expenditure may be a simple clinical technique to predict dietary energy needs in malnourished, unstressed patients. When this estimated energy expenditure/g creatinine (EEE) is compared to measured energy expenditure/g creatinine in malnourished, stressed patients, the EEE provides an index of the extent of hypermetabolism.\r"

Hypercalcemia was produced by supplementation of diet with dihydrotachysterol, achieving a mean serum calcium of 12.6 mg%. Maximal urinary concentration was only 1982 +/- 119 mOsm/kg H2O in pair, watered hypercalcemic rats when compared to 2478 +/- 93 mOsm/kg H2O in controls (N = 7) (P less than 0.01). Vasopressin stimulated adenylate cyclase activity at concentrations of vasopressin between 10(-9) and 10(-7) M was indistinguishable in the outer medullary collecting duct (OMCD) and inner medullary collecting duct (IMCD) of tubules dissected from hypercalcemic rats or normocalcemic rats. Likewise, in situ cAMP accumulation in response to 10(-7) M AVP was not significantly different in either OMCD or IMCD of hypercalcemic or normocalcemic rats at either isotonic or hypertonic media conditions. In contrast, while 10(-7) M AVP significantly (P less than 0.05) increased cAMP accumulation in the medullary ascending limb (MAL) of normocalcemic rats it failed to do so in the MAL of hypercalcemic rats. This failure to accumulate cAMP appears to be due to impairment in AVP-stimulated adenylate cyclase rather than to enhanced phosphodiesterase activity. A similar decrement in glucagon stimulated adenylate cyclase occurred with 10(-6) M glucagon. The results demonstrate that in chronic hypercalcemia the cAMP system in the OMCT and IMCD of the rat is intact, but the MAL demonstrates abnormal AVP responsiveness due to impaired adenylate cyclase.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

It was further suggested that these changes were mediated by complement activation products. The current study examined the role of arachidonic acid metabolites in the pathogenesis of cuprophan-induced pulmonary hypertension in the swine. Plasma thromboxane concentrations and pulmonary arterial pressure rose concomitantly with cuprophan-activated plasma infusion; both could be inhibited by the specific thromboxane synthetase inhibitor, OKY1581. Likewise, this inhibitor also blocked the increment in plasma thromboxane concentrations and pulmonary arterial pressure induced by zymosan-activated plasma. In vitro incubation of cuprophan-activated plasma with porcine lung fragments produced significantly higher thromboxane concentrations in the medium than incubation with other porcine tissues examined. It is postulated that the complement activation products formed in the plasma during cuprophan exposure subsequently stimulated release of thromboxane from the lungs and other tissues upon infusion of the plasma into animals. The thromboxane, in turn, triggers the pulmonary hypertension.\r"

Recent studies have provided morphologic evidence that the intercalated cells are involved in hydrogen ion secretion in the cortical and outer medullary collecting duct of the rat. In the present study we performed a quantitative and qualitative morphologic examination of the intercalated cells in the IMCD of the rat and compared the results to observations obtained from intercalated cells in the collecting duct in the inner stripe of the outer medulla (OMCDi). Kidneys of male rats were preserved by in vivo perfusion with glutaraldehyde and processed for morphologic evaluation. With light microscopy and scanning electron microscopy intercalated cells were found in the outer third of the IMCD (IMCD1) and accounted for 10% of the total cell population. They were absent in the terminal two-thirds of the IMCD. Examination of the intercalated cells using transmission electron microscopy revealed striking similarities between the cells of the IMCD1 and those in the OMCDi. In addition, no differences were found in the surface densities of the apical or basolateral plasma membranes or the volume densities of the mitochondria of the intercalated cells in the two regions. In light of the morphologic similarity with the intercalated cells of the OMCDi that are believed to be involved in hydrogen ion secretion, it is likely that the intercalated cells of the IMCD1 are also involved in the acidification of tubular fluid.\r"

We examined the development of these elevated glucocorticoid levels in early life. The histological progression of a cystic lesion of the biliary ducts in older heterozygotes was also studied. Normal mice had low (less than 85 nmol/liter) or undetectable (less than 36 nmol/liter) levels from the sixth to twelfth day of life. Corticosterone levels were significantly higher in all homozygote (cpk/cpk) and some of the normal sibs, who were presumed to be heterozygote (cpk/+) mice compared to age-matched controls from day seven to 12. Corticosterone levels were similar from the fifteenth day. A significant proportion of adult obligate heterozygotes from breeding pairs were found to have focal areas of cystic dilatation of the biliary ducts, in the absence of any renal abnormality. The incidence of this lesion increased with age (10% at 150 days, 23% at 300 days, 29% at 450 days, 65% at greater than 450 days of age). The livers of homozygote mice dying in infancy, and control adult mice of the C57BL/6J background strain were free of cysts. The finding of hepatic cysts is reminiscent of adult type PKD. The cpk model thus supports the concept that the different forms of PKD may represent varying expression of a similar gene complex.\r"

To identify sites and potential mechanisms, cortical micropuncture was performed during hydrochlorothiazide treatment in control and indomethacin rats. Indomethacin reduced (P less than 0.005) FeCl from 5.20 +/- 0.49% to 2.26 +/- 0.49% (mean +/- SE). MAP, CIn, and plasma volume were not different between groups. SNGFR and fractional proximal fluid and chloride delivery were not different between groups. Fractional chloride delivery to early distal tubules was 10.8 +/- 0.4% in control but 6.2 +/- 0.3% in indomethacin rats (P less than 0.001). Calculated loop chloride reabsorption was greater in indomethacin than control rats during hydrochlorothiazide administration (41.0 +/- 1.6% vs. 34.3 +/- 2.3%; P less than 0.05). Fractional chloride delivery to late distal tubules was 7.8 +/- 0.7% in control and 4.6 +/- 0.3% in indomethacin rats (P less than 0.005), but distal tubule chloride reabsorption was not different between groups. Papillary tissue chloride was less in control than indomethacin rats during hydrochlorothiazide (P less than 0.05). Urinary PGE2 excretion was reduced (P less than 0.001) by indomethacin during hydrochlorothiazide. Thus indomethacin induced reductions in hydrochlorothiazide response result in part from increased chloride reabsorption in the loop segment. This suggests indomethacin antagonizes hydrochlorothiazide by reducing chloride delivery to hydrochlorothiazide's site of action in the distal tubule rather than by effects of indomethacin on hydrochlorothiazide pharmacokinetics.\r"

The mechanisms of HCO3- transport are less clear though recent reports suggest an important role for an electrogenic Na+/HCO3- symport in the basolateral membrane. The importance of chloride-dependent bicarbonate transport is unknown. In the present studies, the pH-sensitive fluorescent dye, bis-(carboxyethyl)-carboxyfluorescein (BCECF) has been used to study pHi changes in suspensions of canine proximal tubule cells following acidification or alkalinization of the cytosol. Cells were acid-loaded to pH 6.5 by exposure to the H+/K+ ionophore, nigericin. Following removal of nigericin, pHi returned to basal levels (pHi = 7.1) when the cells were resuspended in a buffer containing 100 mM Na+. This recovery was blocked by removal of Na+ or addition of 0.2 mM amiloride to the cell suspension. In the presence of 0.2 mM amiloride and Na+, partial excretion of the acid load occurred if the buffer also contained HCO3-/CO2, but this effect was blocked by the removal of Na+ or the addition of 1 mM 4-acetomido-4'-isothiocyano-2,2'-stilbene disulfonic acid (SITS). When cell membrane potential was monitored in these experiments using the potential-sensitive fluorescent dye, bis-(1,3-dibutylbarbiturate) trimethine oxonol, the increase in pHi seen in the presence of Na+ was found to be electroneutral, whereas when that occurred in the presence of Na+, amiloride and HCO3-/CO2 was associated with membrane hyperpolarization.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Amiloride treated rats (0.1 mg/hr) had significant diuresis and natriuresis, as well as antikaliuresis, compared to untreated controls. The relative decrease in potassium excretion was associated with a significant rise in plasma potassium concentration. Net sodium transport in the duct was decreased from 83 + 3 to 46 + 6 per cent of delivered load, as a result of amiloride treatment. Smaller, but statistically significant, reductions (P less than 0.01) were seen for fluid and chloride reabsorptions (from 66 + 3 to 51 + 4%, and from 72 + 4 to 52 + 5%, respectively). Potassium reabsorption increased from 15 + 8 to 61 + 6% of delivered load. The data indicated that amiloride natriuresis is determined primarily by inhibition of sodium reabsorption in the medullary collecting duct, probably due to blockade of a specific Na channel. The antikaliuresis, on the other hand, appears to be due to inhibition of secretion both in upstream nephron segments and in the duct itself.\r"

Elevated titers (greater than 1:80) were observed in nine of 11 patients with mesangial IgA deposits and micro- or macroscopic hematuria, in nine of 19 children with other evolutive glomerular diseases (5 cases of acute glomerulonephritis and 4 cases of minimal change disease), and in most subjects presenting with a M. pneumoniae (4/5 cases) or a E. Coli (4/5 cases) infection. Antibody titers decreased after incubation of normal and pathological sera with D-galactose (10 mM) or with alpha-galactosyl-glucoside (10 mM), but not with D-glucose (10 mM). The anti-alpha-galactosyl antibodies purified, by affinity chromatography, from sera of 10 normal children, 10 pathological controls and four children with mesangial IgA deposits without hematuria belonged to IgG class. In contrast, both IgG and IgA anti-alpha-galactosyl antibodies were detected in six of six patients with mesangial IgA deposits and hematuria. The IgA content of immune complexes detected in those patients decreased after incubation of sera with alpha-galactosyl-glucoside, but not with D-glucose.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Previous morphologic studies on kidneys from adult patients with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) indicates that the cysts developed from nephrons and collecting ducts in association with hyperplasia of epithelial cells lining the cyst walls. In the present study, we systematically evaluated by scanning electron microscopy 387 cysts in polycystic kidneys obtained from 10 adult patients. Some cysts were lined by cells typical of collecting duct (7.2%), proximal tubule (1.8%) or glomerular visceral (2.1%) epithelium. The remaining cysts were lined by a single layer of phenotypically undefined (84.0%) or markedly hyperplastic (4.9%) epithelium. The median plane surface area of individual cells within cysts was 182 X 10(-8) cm2. Among all cysts the surface area of single epithelial cells ranged between 22 and 2530 X 10(-8) cm2, but within single cysts the range of individual cell surface areas was more narrow. Mean cell surface area did not increase in direct proportion to cyst diameter; thus, epithelial hyperplasia is a central element in the progressive enlargement of cysts. In some cysts hyperplasia was accentuated by projections into cyst lumens of polyps, small adenomas and cord-like arrangements of cells. Epithelial polyps were found in the cysts of one non-azotemic patient, excluding renal failure as a cause of this accentuated type of epithelial proliferation. Morphologic evidence that cysts compressed adjacent renal parenchyma was observed in all kidneys. In 11 cysts bisected and then both halves thoroughly examined by scanning electron microscopy, one or two tubule openings were seen in one of the hemisections in three cysts (27.3%).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "To investigate the relationship between atherosclerotic vascular disease and age-associated changes in the normal human kidney, autopsy findings and renal histology from 57 individuals with mild systemic atherosclerosis (group I), were compared to 57 sex- and age-matched individuals with moderate-to-severe atherosclerosis (group II). Age, sex, body build, the presence or absence of hypertension, semiquantitative aorta and coronary-artery atherosclerosis scores, organ weights, and the percent of globally sclerotic glomeruli were determined in each. Glomerular area, arcuate/interlobular arteries, and percent interstitial fibrosis were measured using standard morphometric techniques. Group I individuals had a 8.3 +/- 7.0% incidence of sclerotic glomeruli, compared to 15.4 +/- 16.3% in group II (mean +/- SD, P less than 0.01). Relative intrarenal arterial wall area was increased in group II (60 +/- 12%) compared to group I (55 +/- 11%, P less than 0.05). The mean glomerular area of nonsclerotic glomeruli was greater in group II (23,700 +/- 6,000 sq mu) than in group I (19,600 +/- 3,700 sq mu, P less than 0.01), suggesting that there were compensatory increases in glomerular size in group II. Interstitial fibrosis was similar in both groups. The relative impact of age, sex, body build, hypertension, systemic atherosclerosis, intrarenal vascular disease and interstitial fibrosis on glomerulosclerosis and glomerular size was investigated using multiple linear regression. Both age and intrarenal vascular disease exhibited highly significant, independent associations with glomerulosclerosis. Glomerular area was positively correlated with heart weight and coronary artery atherosclerosis. In contrast, there was no independent correlation between glomerular area and glomerulosclerosis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Thirty-five patients had overt clinical manifestations of renal disease characterized by a nephrotic syndrome with focal and segmental glomerular sclerosis (FSS). Fifteen patients had diffuse glomerular mesangial hyperplasia (MH) without or with minimal clinical renal disease and 109 had intact or minimally involved glomeruli. Whereas 15 of 30 (50%) i.v. drug users with AIDS had evidence of renal disease, only one of 53 (2%) homosexuals had clinical renal disease and only 6 (11%) had histologic evidence of glomerular pathology. The study confirms the important risk of i.v. drug use as a pathogenic factor of renal disease and shows a rarity of renal disease in homosexual or bisexual men with AIDS. On the other hand, 30% of adult Haitians with AIDS had FSS or diffuse MH, although i.v. drug use is not an important risk factor in this population. Moreover, eight of 28 (29%) children with perinatal AIDS had evidence of renal involvement, including four with a nephrotic syndrome and FSS. The data provide strong evidence for the existence of an AIDS-related glomerulopathy independent of i.v. drug use, but suggest that unrecognized co-factors may be important in the development of renal disease.\r"

Means for serum 1,25(OH)2D3 and intestinal absorption of calcium were abnormally high in the renal stone group, slightly elevated in the non-specific group, and low-normal in the bone disease group. In the whole population of patients, we found a positive correlation between circulating 1,25(OH)2D3 and creatinine clearance (taken as an index of the functional renal mass). Negative correlations were observed between 1,25(OH)2D3 and age, and between creatinine clearance and age, the latter being not different from that observed in a normal large population. In the renal stone group, means for the determinants of the renal 1 alpha hydroxylase activity, that is, PTH activity expressed as nephrogenous cyclic AMP (NcAMP), serum phosphate and calcium were identical to those of the group with non-specific symptoms. However means for age were lower and functional renal mass significantly higher in the renal stone group, which may account for the higher value of circulating 1,25(OH)2D3. In the bone disease group, means for age, renal mass and serum calcium were identical to those of the group with non-specific symptoms, and NcAMP was far higher and hypophosphatemia more marked, which may not account for the lower value of circulating 1,25(OH)2D3. However, in the bone disease group, serum 25(OH)D was abnormally low, which may limit the renal production of 1,25(OH)2D3 and explain the low-normal circulating values.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In the developmental period from 28 to 40 weeks gestation, urinary calcium excretion was positively correlated to the gestational age (r = 0.583, P less than 0.01), serum calcium levels (r = 0.512, P less than 0.01), the rate of glomerular filtration (r = 0.715, P less than 0.001), and urinary cyclic AMP excretion (r = 0.717, P less than 0.001). Urinary calcium excretion was independent of sodium and calcium intake, and urinary sodium and phosphate excretion. The mean fractional total calcium excretion and fractional ionized calcium excretion in babies less than or equal to 32 weeks was less than 1.0%, compared to greater than 2.5% for sodium. Serum calcium levels were positively correlated with gestational age (r = 0.803, P less than 0.001), and serum phosphate levels (r = 0.85, P less than 0.001). Whole blood ionized calcium levels were positively correlated to gestational age (r = 0.625, P less than 0.001), and serum total calcium levels (r = 0.440, P less than 0.05). The newborn kidney in babies less than or equal to 32 weeks gestation, did not have impaired conservation of calcium as for sodium; and neither sodium nor calcium intake appeared to affect urinary calcium excretion in the well newborn infant. Probably neither excess excretion of calcium nor serum phosphate levels contribute to early neonatal hypocalcemia.\r"

We describe the interrelationships between radioimmunoassayed plasma EP levels, reticulocyte counts corrected for anemia (CRC) and hematocrit (HCT) under challenge by hemorrhage, transfusions and hemodialysis in 32 chronically-hemodialyzed patients. Spontaneous hemorrhage resulted in a decrease in HCT (P = 0.001) and increases in both EP (P = 0.006) and CRC levels (P = 0.0065). Transfusions of two units of packed red cells into each of 16 patients suppressed EP (P = 0.0004) and CRC (P less than 0.0001) after about 28 and 42 hours, respectively. Repeat transfusions after one to 27 days resulted in similarly significant suppressions of both EP and CRC, except the CRC remained on higher levels for prolonged periods of times. Within a few hours after each transfusion of 2,3-diphosphoglycerate-poor red cells, both EP (P = 0.009) and CRC (P = 0.007) increased temporarily between one to 18 and three to 38 hours, respectively. Hemodialysis resulted in alkalinization (P = 0.008) of blood but not in changes of EP or CRC counts. The data show that, with the EP-HCT feedback loop persisting, increased endogenous hormone levels elicit erythropoietic responses, and that the regulation of EP levels may involve determinants such as oxy-deoxyhemoglobin interactions.\r"

A high level of consistency in classification has been achieved through the use of criteria that minimize intraobserver variability. The data obtained from the review project have been used to characterize the relationship of disease extent and cell type to survival in the clinical trials population. Survival characteristics were generated for 1,121 patients who underwent apparent complete resection of nonsmall cell lung cancer and were subsequently entered into various protocols to receive either adjuvant treatment or no further therapy. The end results study provides some insight regarding the biological behavior of squamous cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma of the lung in terms of the anatomic extent of disease at the time of apparent complete resection. Patients with squamous cell carcinoma had an outcome superior to that of patients with adenocarcinoma in every TNM subset. The differences in survival according to these major cell types were significant overall and in the T1 N0, T1 N1, and T2 N1 subsets but not in the TNM subsets in stage III disease. Histologic cell type and extent of disease are important factors in survival expectations; thus the accuracy and reproducibility of these classifications plays a significant role in the evaluation of differing modalities of treatment.\r"

The standard approach utilizing the neodymium: yttrium, aluminum, garnet (Nd: YAG) laser was first described by Fleischer for squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus and subsequently for adenocarcinoma of the gastroesophageal junction. According to his technique, treatment was begun at the proximal tumor margin and proceeded distally; as many as 13 treatments were necessary to complete therapy and relieve the obstruction. A new technique has been developed utilizing tumor dilatation so that treatment can be started at the distal tumor margin working retrogradely. This new technique has allowed treatment to be completed in a single session in most patients. This rapid completion of therapy has reduced the length of hospitalization and thereby hospital costs. It has also allowed patients to aliment earlier, thereby minimizing the metabolic consequences of prolonged intravenous feedings, has allowed patients to receive other forms of therapy on an outpatient basis, and has obviated the need for the chronic placement of tubes for drainage and feeding. The technique is described and discussed.\r"
