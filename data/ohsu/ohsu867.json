  ".W": "An unusual subset of DNA-binding proteins, termed cis-acting proteins, has been shown to act preferentially at their site of synthesis; the transposases of several bacterial insertion sequences (ISs) fall into this class. The transposase of IS903 exhibits a strong preference for action in cis: complementation of defective transposons in trans occurs at less than 1%. Furthermore, transposition mediated by transposase acting in cis is extremely sensitive to the distance between the 3' end of the transposase gene and the nearest transposon inverted repeat; we find that an insertion of 1 kilobase of DNA reduces transposition to 1-2% of control levels. Here we show that there is a strong correlation between the stability of transposase and its ability to act in trans. We found that the wild-type transposase is a very unstable protein with a physical half-life of about 3 min. However, a transposase-beta-galactosidase fusion protein has a much greater half-life and can act equally well in cis or in trans. In addition, the native transposase is stabilized in lon- strains of Escherichia coli, and, in these protease-deficient strains, trans action of transposase is increased 10- to 100-fold. These results suggest that instability of the IS903 transposase is a major determinant of its cis action and that the La protease, product of the lon gene, is an important determinant of transposase instability.\r"

Functions thought necessary for antitumor activity include cytolysis, homing, and proliferation at tumor sites. TILs, which are T lymphocytes grown ex vivo directly from tumors, bear interleukin 2 (IL-2) receptors capable of transducing the IL-2 mitogenic signal. However, IL-2 is not normally synthesized by solid tumor cells. This study was aimed at exploring the possible presence of T-cell mitogens of tumor origin. To this end four TIL lines derived from four melanoma patients were studied for their ability to use the environments of cultured tumor cell lines as mitogenic sources. The presence of four irradiated cultured human tumor cell lines, three of which were derived from the same melanoma patients as the TILs, were found to stimulate proliferation of human TILs in the absence of IL-2. Further investigation showed that the observed proliferative stimulation by the fourth tumor line was due to secreted factor(s) as mitogenic activity was present in the serum-free tumor cell supernatant. Both immunologic analyses of this medium and proliferative assays in which TILs were stimulated with recombinant lymphokine standards suggest the presence of a yet uncharacterized T-cell mitogen.\r"

  ".W": "Cell lines derived from Kaposi sarcoma lesions of patients with AIDS (AIDS-KS cells) produce several cytokines, including an endothelial cell growth factor, interleukin 1 beta, and basic fibroblast growth factor. Since exposure to human immunodeficiency virus increases interleukin 6 (IL-6) production in monocytes and endothelial cells produce IL-6, we examined IL-6 expression and response in AIDS-KS cell lines and IL-6 expression in AIDS Kaposi sarcoma tissue. The AIDS-KS cell lines (N521J and EKS3) secreted large amounts of immunoreactive and biologically active IL-6. We found both IL-6 and IL-6 receptor (IL-6-R) RNA by slot blot hybridization analysis of AIDS-KS cells. The IL-6-R was functional, as [3H]thymidine incorporation by AIDS-KS cells increased significantly after exposure to human recombinant IL-6 (hrIL-6) at greater than 10 units/ml. When AIDS-KS cells (EKS3) were exposed to IL-6 antisense oligonucleotide, cellular proliferation decreased by nearly two-thirds, with a corresponding decrease in the production of IL-6. The decrease from IL-6 antisense in AIDS-KS cell proliferation was reversed by the addition of hrIL-6. We confirmed that AIDS-KS cells produced IL-6 in vivo by preparing RNA and tissue sections from involved and uninvolved skin from a patient with AIDS Kaposi sarcoma. We detected immunoreactive IL-6 in the involved tumor areas and to a lesser extent in the surrounding normal epidermis. Slot blot hybridization showed a great excess of IL-6 and IL-6-R RNA in involved skin compared to uninvolved skin. These results show that both IL-6 and IL-6-R are produced by AIDS-KS cells and that IL-6 is required for optimal AIDS-KS cell proliferation, and they suggest that IL-6 is an autocrine growth factor for AIDS-KS cells.\r"

  ".W": "Long-term potentiation (LTP) in hippocampus has been proposed to result from a tonic activation of protein kinase C. This hypothesis predicts that stimulation of the kinase would produce a smaller change in response size on potentiated versus control pathways and, conversely, that inhibition of the kinase would reduce potentiated inputs to a greater degree than control responses. We tested these predictions using phorbol esters to activate and using the antagonist H-7 to inhibit protein kinase C; we found that the actions of these drugs on synaptic transmission were not affected by prior induction of LTP. Both compounds, however, significantly decreased the contribution of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors to synaptic potentials, a result that accounts for the suppressive effects of these compounds on LTP formation. Thus protein kinase C is probably not involved in the expression of LTP but may play a role in the receptor-mediated events participating in its induction.\r"

  ".W": "It has been postulated that a glucose transporter of beta cells (GLUT-2) may be important in glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. To determine whether this transporter is constitutively expressed or regulated, we subjected conscious unrestrained Wistar rats to perturbations in glucose homeostasis and quantitated beta-cell GLUT-2 mRNA by in situ hybridization. After 3 hr of hypoglycemia (glucose at 29 +/- 5 mg/dl), GLUT-2 and proinsulin mRNA signal densities were reduced by 25% of the level in control rats. After 4 days (blood glucose at 57 +/- 7 mg/dl vs. 120 +/- 10 mg/dl in saline-infused control rats), GLUT-2 and proinsulin mRNA densities were reduced by 85% and 65%, respectively (P = 0.001). After 12 days (glucose at 54 +/- 8 mg/dl), GLUT-2 mRNA signal density was undetectable whereas proinsulin mRNA was reduced by 51%. After 12 days of hypoglycemia, the Km for 3-O-methyl-D-glucose transport in isolated rat islets, normally 18-20 mM, was 2.5 mM. This provides functional evidence of a profound reduction of high Km glucose transporter in beta cells. In contrast, GLUT-2 was only slightly reduced by hypoglycemia in liver. To determine the effect of prolonged hyperglycemia, we also infused animals with 50% (wt/vol) glucose for 5 days (glucose at 200 +/- 50 mg/dl). Hyperglycemic clamping increased GLUT-2 mRNA by 46% (P = 0.001) whereas proinsulin mRNA doubled (P = 0.001). We conclude that GLUT-2 expression in beta cells, but not liver, is subject to regulation by certain perturbations in blood glucose homeostasis.\r"

  ".W": "Transcription factor ADR1 increases the level of ADH2 gene expression 200-fold by binding to a palindromic upstream activation sequence (UAS1) in the glucose-repressible ADH2 promoter in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. cAMP-dependent protein kinase (cAPK) phosphorylates ADR1 in vitro and a yeast strain with elevated cAPK activity inhibits the ability of ADR1 to activate ADH2 transcription in vivo [Cherry, J. R., Johnson, T. R., Dollard, C., Schuster, J. R. & Denis, C. L. (1988) Cell 56, 409-419]. Intact ADR1 protein was detected at comparable levels in extracts made from repressed or derepressed yeast cells, indicating that glucose repression is not due to absence of ADR1. ADR1 in extracts made from glucose-repressed and -derepressed cells bound UAS1 DNA with similar affinities despite having greatly different abilities to activate ADH2 gene expression in vivo. A mutant form of ADR1 encoded by ADR1-5c, which has an altered consensus sequence for phosphorylation by cAPK conferred constitutive expression on ADH2 but bound DNA to the same extent as wild-type ADR1 protein. Similarly, normal DNA binding was seen for ADR1 produced in mutants with altered levels of cAPK activity. Because inactivation of ADR1 by phosphorylation has no detectable effect on either DNA binding or ADR1 levels, ADR1 probably binds to UAS1 constitutively and phosphorylation prevents it from promoting transcription.\r"

Interleukin 3-dependent lymphoid cell lines that have been stably transfected with the EPO-R cDNA grow in the presence of EPO or interleukin 3. In these cells, the EPO-R is synthesized as a minor 62-kDa unglycosylated form and a major 64-kDa form carrying one high-mannose N-linked oligosaccharide. A fraction of the 64-kDa form is processed to a 66-kDa species with complex-type sugars. Very little of the EPO-R is expressed on the cell surface and all three forms of EPO-R are degraded rapidly. Cells transfected with both EPO-R and gp55 cDNAs grow in the absence of EPO. Most of the EPO-R associated with gp55 is endoglycosidase H-sensitive, suggesting that the interactions between these proteins occur in the endoplasmic reticulum. Furthermore, the endoglycosidase H-sensitive EPO-R is more stable than in the absence of gp55, a result suggesting that interaction of gp55 with the EPO-R causes it to remain within the rough endoplasmic reticulum. It is possible that gp55 EPO-R complexes within this compartment send a growth-promoting signal to the cell.\r"

Proteins of 100, 85, 70, 64, and 55 kDa were suppressed under the same conditions but were seen in cells labeled in the tissue culture medium alone. Protein expression during the stages of attachment, invasion, and intracellular multiplication was examined by pulse-labeling. The 58-kDa protein was induced only during invasion, and the 62- and 25-kDa proteins were induced only during intracellular multiplication. Shift into a minimal medium with ion concentrations and pH mimicking intracellular conditions and endosomal pH resulted in the induction of the 97- and 58-kDa proteins, and reduction of the intracellular-like medium with 2-mercaptoethanol resulted in the induction of the 97-, 50-, and 25-kDa proteins and suppression of the 55-kDa protein. Radioimmunoprecipitations of shigellae grown in vitro and in vivo revealed differential expression of immunogenic proteins. Proteins corresponding in size to IpaB (62 kDa), IpaC (42 kDa), and IpaD (38 kDa) were lost during intracellular multiplication, whereas another protein corresponding to IpaA (80 kDa) was found to increase under the same conditions.\r"

They were then challenged with syngeneic K-fgf- or H-ras-transformed cells. Vaccinated animals exhibited a significant degree of protection against tumor induction, which was specific for K-fgf-transformed cells and correlated with the ability of the immunized mice to produce high titers of anti-K-FGF antibodies. Thus immunization with a single oncogene product can protect animals against tumor cells expressing this oncogene.\r"

  ".U": "90272687\r", 
  ".W": "Ion channels in excised patches of plasma membrane are generally considered to be isolated from any intracellular regulation mechanisms. For example, in excised patches of vertebrate rod outer segment plasma membrane, the cGMP-activated cation channels have traditionally been studied in room light because the enzyme cascade linking photon absorption to channel closure was assumed to be inoperative. To investigate the possibility that, in fact, such excised patches retain a functional phototransduction enzymatic cascade, this same preparation was studied in darkness. Patches excised in the dark were found to retain the light sensitivity of their cGMP-induced conductance and the ability to synthesize cGMP. In the presence of guanosine 5'-[gamma-thio]triphosphate (GTP[gamma S]), a nonhydrolyzable GTP analog, light suppresses the cGMP-induced conductance irreversibly. Furthermore, inhibitors of phosphodiesterase activity reduce light sensitivity, whereas activated phosphodiesterase or activated transducin does not directly affect the channels. These results (i) establish that excised patches from rod outer segment retain functional phototransduction enzymes, (ii) support the classical view that channel opening is modulated by phosphodiesterase-mediated cGMP hydrolysis, and, most surprisingly, (iii) demonstrate that diffusion in excised patches is so restricted that local enzymes can induce variations in the concentration of small molecules. The indication that excised patches are not as simple as usually surmised opens the possibility of using them to study other intracellular transduction mechanisms.\r"

A protocol was developed for preparative electrophoretic enrichment of high molecular mass human DNA fragments from partial restriction digests and ligation with the YAC vector in agarose. A YAC library has been constructed from large fragments of DNA from an Epstein-Barr virus-transformed human lymphoblastoid cell line. The library presently contains 50,000 clones, 95% of which are greater than 250 kilobase pairs in size. The mean YAC size of the library, calculated from 132 randomly isolated clones, is 430 kilobase pairs. The library thus contains the equivalent of approximately seven haploid human genomes.\r"

  ".W": "Brain is not generally recognized as an organ that requires vitamin A, perhaps because no obvious histologic lesions have been observed in severely vitamin A-deficient animals. However, brain tissue does contain cellular vitamin A-binding proteins and a nuclear receptor protein for retinoic acid. In the present study, immunohistochemical techniques were used to determine the cell-specific location of cellular retinol-binding protein in human and rat brain tissue. Cellular retinol-binding protein was localized specifically within the endothelial cells of the brain microvasculature and within the cuboidal epithelial cells of the choroid plexus, two primary sites of the mammalian blood-brain barrier. In addition, autoradiographic procedures demonstrated binding sites for serum retinol-binding protein in the choroidal epithelium. These observations suggest that a significant movement of retinol across the blood-brain barrier may occur.\r"

  ".W": "We have shown previously that 3-phosphoglycerate, which is a glycolytic metabolite of glucose, induces protein phosphorylation in bovine and rat brain and in rat heart, kidney, liver, lung, and whole pancreas. Since glycolytic metabolism of glucose is of paramount importance in insulin release, we considered the possibility that 3-phosphoglycerate may act as a coupling factor, and we searched for evidence for the existence of 3-phosphoglycerate-dependent protein phosphorylation systems in freshly isolated normal rat pancreatic islets. Membrane and cytosol fractions were incubated with [gamma-32P]ATP and appropriate test substances and were subjected to NaDodSO4/PAGE and autoradiography. As little as 0.005 mM 3-phosphoglycerate or 2-phosphoglycerate stimulated the phosphorylation of a 65-kDa cytosol protein by as early as 0.25 min. The phosphate bond of the 65-kDa phosphoprotein was sufficiently stable to withstand dialysis; the radioactivity could not be chased out by subsequent exposure to ATP, ADP, 3-phosphoglycerate, or 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate. Moreover, cAMP, cGMP, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, or calcium failed to stimulate the phosphorylation of the 65-kDa protein. Phosphoglycerate-dependent protein phosphorylation in islets may have relevance to stimulation of insulin secretion.\r"

  ".U": "90272706\r", 
  ".W": "The lacY gene of Escherichia coli was cut into two approximately equal-size fragments with Afl II and subcloned individually or together under separate lac operator/promoters in plasmid pT7-5. Under these conditions, lac permease is expressed in two portions: (i) the N-terminal portion (the N terminus, the first six putative transmembrane helices, and most of putative loop 7) and (ii) the C-terminal portion (the last six putative transmembrane helices and the C terminus). Cells harboring pT7-5 encoding both fragments transport lactose at about 30% the rate of cells expressing intact permease to a comparable steady-state level of accumulation. In contrast, cells expressing either half of the permease independently do not transport lactose. As judged by [35S]methionine labeling and immunoblotting, intact permease is completely absent from the membrane of cells expressing lacY fragments either individually or together. Thus, transport activity must result from an association between independently synthesized pieces of lac permease. When the gene fragments are expressed individually, the N-terminal portion of the permease is observed inconsistently, and the C-terminal portion is not observed. When the gene fragments are expressed together, polypeptides identified as the N- and C-terminal moieties of the permease are found in the membrane. It is concluded that the N- or C-terminal halves of lac permease are proteolyzed when synthesized independently and that association between the two complementing polypeptides leads to a more stable, catalytically active complex.\r"

Despite evidence that activation of this enzyme results in TCR-zeta chain phosphorylation, it has not been shown that the TCR activates lck. We have sought evidence that the TCR is associated with a PTK. In this study we use digitonin to solubilize a murine T-cell hybridoma and demonstrate that antibodies binding extracellular but not intracellular domains of the TCR specifically coprecipitate only the fyn PTK and not lck or yes, two other kinases found in these cells. The association of the fyn PTK with the TCR might enable the T cell to independently regulate two PTKs through surface receptors.\r"

The gene for the 82-kDa subunit was identified as open reading frame (ORF) A8L, based on the N-terminal sequence of factor purified by using DNA-affinity magnetic beads. The 70-kDa subunit of VETF was refractory to N-terminal analysis, and so N-terminal sequences were obtained for three internal tryptic peptides. All three peptides matched sequences within ORF D6R. ORFs A8L and D6R are located within the central region of the vaccinia virus genome and are separated by about 13,600 base pairs. Proteins corresponding to the 3' ends of ORFs A8L and D6R were overexpressed in Escherichia coli and used to prepare antisera that bound to the larger and smaller subunits, respectively, of affinity-purified VETF. Immunoblot analysis of proteins from infected cells indicated that both subunits are expressed exclusively in the late phase of infection, just prior to their packaging in virus particles. The two subunits of VETF have no significant local or overall amino acid sequence homology to one another, to other entries in biological sequence data bases including bacterial sigma factors, or to recently determined sequences of some eukaryotic transcription factors. The 70-kDa subunit, however, has motifs in common with a super-family of established and putative DNA and RNA helicases.\r"

The polyurethane is felt to be responsible for altering capsule formation and reducing the contracture rate. This study characterizes the soft-tissue response to the Natural-Y Meme polyurethane foam versus smooth silicone in a rat model. Implants were fashioned from an unbacked polyurethane foam specimen used to cover the Natural-Y prosthesis, a silicone shell covered with the Natural-Y foam, and a smooth silicone control. Materials were placed subcutaneously into the backs of male Lew/SsN rats (n = 81) for 3, 7, 14, and 28 days and 3, 6, and 12 months. Implants were then harvested with their soft-tissue response and evaluated histologically. Analysis demonstrates that microstructuring of a surface, as opposed to a smooth material, will dramatically alter the early, intermediate, and late wound-healing events. The soft-tissue response was observed to be dependent on implant site, material chemistry, and morphology as characterized by exudate formation, macrophage invasion, multinucleated giant cell formation, collagen deposition, foam degradation, and angiogenesis.\r"

The present study addresses the feasibility of inducing regeneration of limb muscle within autologous peripheral nerve implants in the gluteus medius of beagles. In six anesthetized animals, a 2-cm segment of the left infraorbital sensory nerve was removed from the nose and implanted between the cut ends of several muscle fascicles in the left gluteus medius. After 4 weeks, the nerve grafts were removed and examined by light and electron microscopy. Muscle fibers were seen surrounded by the epineurium of the implanted nerve along its entire length, growing in parallel with the long axis of the nerve. The regenerating fibers were closely associated with the basal lamina of degenerating myelinated and unmyelinated axons. This study suggests that limb muscle, like extraocular muscle, is capable of organized regenerative growth within peripheral nerve autografts.\r"

Advances in flow cytometry (S-phase analysis), immunophenotyping, and molecular genetics may be of value in diagnosis, classification, and prognostication. The Rye modification of the Lukes-Butler classification of HD has been stable since 1966 and is widely accepted because of its proven reliability. By contrast, the proliferation of classifications of NHL since 1966 speaks for imperfection, partially due to the still incomplete understanding of this diverse group of lymphoreticular malignancies. Successive classifications have incorporated immunologic relationships and concepts and added a clinically significant grading system. A goal of the working formulation was to allow translatability between classifications in the interest of comparison and communication of clinical and research results. Knowledge of the patterns of involvement and spread by HD and by the different categories of NHL helps to narrow the differential diagnosis of radiologic findings. An awareness of the benign, reactive processes and nonlymphoreticular malignant neoplasms that mimic HD and NHL is essential to avoiding misdiagnosis.\r"

Lung manifestations include direct extension from involved nodes, nodules with or without cavitation, atelectasis secondary to endobronchial or nodal obstruction and rarely an interstitial pattern. Pleural effusions are not uncommon, but solid pleural masses are less frequent. Invasion of the pericardium is not often seen, although masses are commonly seen along the pericardium. Invasion of the chest wall occurs particularly with involvement of internal mammary nodes. Occasionally, posterior nodes will invade the adjacent vertebrae and spinal canal. The chest wall may be invaded by enlarged axillary nodes. Isolated chest wall soft-tissue masses are not common and are usually a manifestation of NHL, especially large cell lymphoma. Although the chest radiograph should detect most intrathoracic disease. CT has been found a necessary adjunct in patients with HD for accurate staging and therapy, especially if radiotherapy is planned. CT has been found helpful in NHL for staging, especially for the pleura and chest wall. MR imaging has not been found to contribute additional useful information except in selected cases.\r"

Radiologically, GI lymphomas tend to have similar morphologic characteristics regardless of their site of origin. Additionally, the diverse radiologic manifestations may mimic a variety of diseases. Nevertheless, growing clinical experience and improvements in imaging techniques have increased the frequency with which the proper diagnosis can be suggested. The extramucosal origin of a mass or masses is often detectable by double-contrast examination and dictates a diagnostic spectrum fundamentally different from that of tumors arising from the mucous membrane. Similarly, the ability of CT to determine the wall thickness of the involved segment and its relationships to adjacent structures has further increased radiologic specificity. These capabilities are important, not only from the diagnostic standpoint, but also with respect to staging, prognosis, and, ultimately, increased survival.\r"

  ".W": "Unrecognized abdominal injury remains a distressingly frequent cause of preventable death following blunt trauma. Peritoneal signs are often subtle, overshadowed by pain from associated injury, and masked by head trauma or intoxicants. The initial management of the patient with blunt abdominal trauma should parallel the primary survey of airway, breathing, and circulation. Diagnostic peritoneal lavage remains the cornerstone of triage in patients with life-threatening blunt abdominal trauma. The only absolute contraindication to the procedure is an existing indication for laparotomy. Computed tomography is useful as a complementary diagnostic tool in selected patients, and it is the critical test for guiding nonoperative management of known intraperitoneal trauma. Routine ancillary tests for potentially occult injuries include nasogastric-tube placement for ruptures of the left diaphragm, Gastrografin contrast study for duodenum perforation, and pyelography for urologic injury. Ultrasonography may become a valuable tool in the initial assessment of the injured abdomen. Ultimately, the most important principle in the management of blunt abdominal trauma is repeat physical examination by an experienced surgeon.\r"

All of these factors make morbidity and mortality associated with penetrating injuries low. In contrast, blunt injuries often cause extensive contamination of the peritoneal cavity with resultant high morbidity and mortality.\r"

The unique anatomic and physiologic characteristics of the duodenum demand careful selection of the operative repair to fit the injury. A classification scheme is reviewed that should help the surgeon select the appropriate procedure from a multitude of choices. Standard postoperative care is required. Adherence to these principles should result in acceptable morbidity and mortality in patients with duodenal injuries.\r"

A delayed diagnosis results in a progressive septic insult and markedly increased mortality. Early diagnosis is the key. After addressing life-threatening problems, the operation should include a thorough and systematic exploration to identify all injuries. Sound surgical technique includes debridement of nonviable tissue, restoration of small bowel continuity, generous irrigation, and placement of enteral feeding catheters. By adhering to the preceding principles and by exercising meticulous postoperative care and maintaining a low threshold to reoperate, catastrophic complications can be avoided.\r"

The time-honored philosophy of conservative management by repair and diversion is giving way to a more aggressive approach, which includes primary repair of many injuries. The role of colostomy has been challenged by the need for additional operative procedures, patient disability, and rising hospital and medical costs. Based on the current literature, the authors have come to the following conclusions: 1. Primary repair is safe in carefully selected cases. 2. Colostomy should not be abandoned because of a fear of the morbidity associated with its closure. 3. The difference between injuries on the right and the left is questionable and probably not as significant as previously thought. 4. Exteriorized repair frequently requires conversion to colostomy and probably has little indication for use. 5. Short-term perioperative single-antibiotic coverage is sufficient. 6. Use of drains cannot be supported in most instances. 7. Wounds are best left open in patients with significant contamination. Surgical judgment remains the final arbiter in the decision process. These controversies and the debate generated have sharpened the guidelines for that judgment.\r"

Because it is these associated injuries that are responsible for the early morbidity and mortality, control of hemorrhage and bacterial contamination takes initial priority over the pancreatic injury. The management of specific pancreatic injury depends on the status of the main pancreatic duct, the degree of parenchymal damage, and the anatomic location of the injury. Complete visualization of the gland and accurate determination of the duct status are key intraoperative maneuvers. Failure to recognize significant pancreatic duct and parenchymal injury is the major cause of postoperative morbidity. The vast majority of pancreatic injuries can be managed by simple drainage with or without debridement or suture. However, the occasional major transection or pancreatic duct injury warrants rigorous efforts at determining the status of the major ducts.\r"

Perioperative use of clindamycin and an aminoglycoside, a second- or third-generation cephalosporin, or an enhanced-spectrum penicillin is clearly beneficial in lowering the incidence of intra-abdominal and wound infections. A 12- to 48-hour length of administration of antibiotics after operation is as effective as regimens of longer duration, although presently used dosages may be inadequate in severely injured patients. Adjunctive surgical maneuvers such as peritoneal irrigation with saline-containing antibiotic(s) remain controversial. Perioperative use of antibiotic prophylaxis, coupled with early operation and appropriate surgical technique, results in a 4.4% rate of intra-abdominal abscesses and a 5.1% rate of wound infections after laparotomy for abdominal trauma in modern trauma centers.\r"

Preservation and restoration of the body cell mass involves amino acid synthesis into protein, and this process requires nutrient energy. Newer methods of assessing energy expenditure have revised traditional concepts about energy requirements following trauma. The use of fat to meet some of the caloric requirements may obviate problems with ventilatory distress, glucose intolerance, and hepatic steatosis that occur with glucose-based nutritional regimens. Selection of the delivery method for intensive nutritional support should consider gastrointestinal integrity, physiologic tolerance, and cost. Enteral nutrition is superior to parenteral nutrition in maintaining gastrointestinal mucosal integrity, hormonal balance, and nutrient utilization. Furthermore, it is safer, more convenient, and more economical than parenteral nutrition.\r"

One of the primary techniques for performing this procedure uses immunoadsorption columns containing monospecific polyclonal sheep antibodies to human LDL covalently coupled to a gel filtration medium. LDL-apheresis has generally been well-tolerated, with chills, fever, or flushing occurring rarely. The possibility of an immune reaction was investigated as a basis for these reactions observed in 12 of the 1312 procedures performed. Antibodies to sheep IgG developed in 12 of the 15 patients treated with LDL-apheresis as a result of the shedding of small quantities of the sheep immunoglobulin from the columns. A column acid-washing procedure minimized the quantity of shed antibody but did not prevent immunization of the patient. The clinical reactions were probably unrelated to shedding and immunization, as the reactions occurred even in patients who were not immunized to the sheep IgG. Immunization to ethylene oxide was not the cause, as determined by a radioallergosorbent test. The reactions were more likely related to the activation of complement, as indicated by the generation of C3a des Arg by the columns and an increase in C3a des Arg levels systemically.\r"

FMH of 30 mL or more occurs in just 3 of 1000 women. When the FMH was 150 mL or more, 15 of 41 infants did not survive Rh-negative women with FMH of more than 30 mL of Rh-positive whole blood are at increased risk of Rh immunization, and thus the outcome of their future pregnancies also may be affected. ABO-compatible fetal red cells that have entered the maternal circulation have a life span similar to that of adult cells. ABO-incompatible fetal red cells may be cleared rapidly, but in some cases they circulate for weeks. Most FMHs of 30 mL or more occur before labor, delivery, or cesarean section. The majority occur with minimal clinical signs and symptoms in apparently normal pregnancies. The identification of postpartum Rh-negative women who have 30 mL or more of Rh-positive fetal blood in their circulation is important so that sufficient RhIG for immune suppression can be administered. It appears that more than one-half of women with FMH of 30 mL or more would not be identified if protocols were adopted to test only women in pregnancies considered to be at high risk.\r"

The present communication assesses the technical performance of this test in comparison with a 3H tracer-based PC-RIA for serum CyA levels using 971 samples obtained during the first 6 posttransplant months from 14 kidney transplant recipients. The FPIA evaluation included verification of CyA concentrations in manufacturer-supplied calibrators and controls by reference methods, determination of intraassay/interassay precision and accuracy, feasibility of specimen dilution and assessed assay sensitivity, and range of linearity. Comparison of FPIA with PC-RIA indicated that trough samples, when assessed by FPIA, averaged 1.3-fold greater than the PC-RIA, whereas non-trough FPIA measurements indicated similarity between the two methods. Although the two assays showed similar trends in most renal transplant recipients, two subjects demonstrated discrepancies, presumably reflecting the differing specificities of the polyclonal antibodies used in each assay. Thus, the FPIA appears to be a useful addition to CyA monitoring technology.\r"

Plasma or WB CyA concentration monitoring remains the best method presently available for adjusting CyA dosage in LT patients in a timely manner. The availability of an FPIA assay for CyA has produced rapid drug analysis for transplant patient monitoring, but adds additional factors that must be considered in interpreting CyA concentrations. Liver dysfunction may disproportionately elevate CyA plasma or blood levels when analyzed by FPIA in relation to PC-RIA or HPLC, and adjustment of the therapeutic range or analysis by a more specific assay method may be necessary for dosage adjustment in these patients. The availability of a more specific antibody in an FPIA assay may avert these problems, as would the development of immunologic monitoring techniques that provide a global assessment of immune suppression produced by increasingly complex immunosuppressive regimens in LT patients.\r"

In a review of published studies comparing physical with nonphysical diagnostic techniques, the startling accuracy of physical diagnosticians in some areas contrasts sharply with the extremely poor correlation of physical findings with autopsy or imaging studies in others. In a time of constricting financial resources, physicians-and those who teach or judge physicians' skills-must begin to compare physical and nonphysical diagnostic techniques rigorously so that the best, safest, and least expensive diagnostic test is chosen in each clinical situation.\r"

Accounting for approximately 20% of cases of paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia and with a prevalence perhaps as high as 1 per 500, it is far from a rare disorder. Considering the potentially lethal complications following the administration of digoxin or verapamil, all physicians treating arrhythmias should know when to suspect the Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome. A careful review of electrocardiograms helps identify cases of the disorder despite a wide range of findings that may mimic other conditions. Major advances in the efficacy of surgical procedures to cure this syndrome make this a reasonable alternative to life-long medical therapy for many patients. Unfortunately, available diagnostic tests lack the positive predictive value to reliably distinguish patients at risk of sudden death. This review is an update for general internists of the major developments in the evaluation and treatment of the disorder and provides specific examples helpful in differentiating these patients.\r"

  ".W": "More than half of elderly men and women have hypertension, leading to a significant risk of increased morbidity and mortality. The cause of hypertension in this age group is unknown. Left ventricular hypertrophy is frequently present, often associated with diastolic dysfunction. Systolic hypertension in the elderly increases the risk of cardiovascular disease, but there are no good data to show that the treatment of isolated systolic hypertension reduces the morbidity or mortality. Good evidence indicates that antihypertensive treatment in this group decreases cardiovascular morbidity and mortality up to age 80, so most elderly hypertensive patients should be treated. An empiric trial of nonpharmacologic therapy can be initiated in those with mild hypertension and no cardiovascular disease, but most patients will require drug therapy. Most elderly hypertensive patients have accompanying illnesses for which they may or may not be taking medications. Some antihypertensive drugs exacerbate coexisting diseases while others augment treatment regimens. Similarly, drugs may interact in a beneficial or adverse way. Finally, drug metabolism is altered by age, leading to problems with toxicity or diminished efficacy. The choice of medication should be based on all such considerations, including the cost and convenience of the drugs available.\r"

Presenting features are variable and include simple asymptomatic palmar nodules or refractory contractures of the interphalangeal joints. Substantial associations with knuckle pads, plantar nodules, and Peyronie's disease are noteworthy. Although a strong familial tendency is present, the precise pathologic mechanism is unknown. Treatment is frequently unnecessary, but when indicated it includes a variety of surgical alternatives. An appropriately timed referral to a surgical specialist before irreversible contracture of the interphalangeal joints can prevent a permanent loss of function. When surgical intervention is not elected, careful and regular follow-up is necessary to detect early joint contracture.\r"

Studies of animal and human genetic predispositions suggest the presence of genetic influences over drinking behavior as well as biologic risk factors related to deficiencies in various neurochemicals. Ethanol affects the fluidity of cell membrane lipids, eventually causing membrane dysfunction. It also adversely affects the activity of two enzymes, monoamine oxidase and adenylate cyclase, that have important functions in the information processing system of the brain. Research on condensation products formed in the brain after alcohol consumption has provided clues to the development of alcoholism, but many questions remain unanswered. Alcoholism is clearly a multidimensional phenomenon in which biologic, psychological, and sociocultural factors interact to produce illness.\r"

The prevalence of marijuana use is highest, and this can be reliably tested. Though it is prudent to rid the workplace of drug use, there is little scientific study on the relationship of drug use and workplace outcomes, such as productivity and safety. Probable-cause testing and preemployment testing are the most common applications. Random testing has been less accepted owing to its higher costs, unresolved legal issues, and predictably poor test reliability. Legal issues have focused on the right to policy, discrimination, and the lack of due process. The legal cornerstone of a good program is a policy that is planned and agreed on by both labor and management, which serves both as a contract and as a procedure in which expectations and consequences are known. The National Institute on Drug Abuse is certifying laboratories doing employee drug testing. Testing methods when done correctly are less prone to error than in the past, but screening tests can be defeated by adulterants. Although the incidence of false-positive results is low, such tests are less reliable when the prevalence of drug abuse is also low.\r"

These regulations require that applicable drug testing programs employ physicians as medical review officers to evaluate positive tests that have been screened and confirmed by different techniques to determine if there is a legal medical explanation for the result. The drug testing program tests for the presence of amphetamine, cocaine, tetrahydrocannabinol, opiates, and phencyclidine. If an employee testing positive has an acceptable medical explanation, the result is to be reported as negative. Little practical advice exists for medical review officers, and they must be aware of key elements of the regulations and potential trouble spots.\r"

Studies conducted within the past 15 years in animals, isolated tissues, and humans indicate that marijuana smoke can injure the lungs. Habitual smoking of marijuana has been shown to be associated with chronic respiratory tract symptoms, an increased frequency of acute bronchitic episodes, extensive tracheobronchial epithelial disease, and abnormalities in the structure and function of alveolar macrophages, key cells in the lungs' immune defense system. In addition, the available evidence strongly suggests that regularly smoking marijuana may predispose to the development of cancer of the respiratory tract. \"Crack\" smoking has become increasingly prevalent in our society, especially among habitual smokers of marijuana. New evidence is emerging implicating smoked cocaine as a cause of acute respiratory tract symptoms, lung dysfunction, and, in some cases, serious, life-threatening acute lung injury. A strong physician message to users of marijuana, cocaine, or both concerning the harmful effects of these smoked substances on the lungs and other organs may persuade some of them, especially those with drug-related respiratory complications, to quit smoking.\r"

Between half and two thirds of abstinent alcoholics exhibit cognitive impairments during this period, with residual deficits persisting for years after detoxification in some patients. The most severe deficits have been observed in visuospatial abilities, perceptual-motor integration, abstract reasoning, and new learning. The most significant predictors of cognitive dysfunction in persons recovering from alcoholism are the time elapsed since the last drink and the person's age. Surprisingly, the pattern and duration of a patient's alcohol abuse are relatively weak determinants of neuropsychological impairment during abstinence. Research investigating the hypothesis that cognitive impairments may be related to alcoholic persons resuming drinking has yielded mixed results, but a higher level of neuropsychological functioning is associated with increased rates of completing treatment programs and with greater success in the work environment after discharge from treatment. The possibility of cognitive limitations should be taken into account in planning treatment programs for alcoholism.\r"

It is critical that physicians screen for alcohol and drug addiction. Health care providers should understand the risks and benefits of HIV antibody testing and include in their practices the basic components of counseling before and after testing and informed consent. Both HIV illness and addiction are chronic diseases with long-term health implications. A knowledge of patient characteristics, intensity of treatments, and treatment modalities is important in making recommendations for individualized therapy.

Drugs can cause psychiatric disorders and can also be used as an attempt to \"cure\" them by self-medication. The spread of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) among drug users has added a third potential clinical problem, that of the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, to the difficulties already presented by drug abuse and psychiatric disorders. Patients with this triple diagnosis pose challenges to primary care physicians as well as addiction medicine specialists or psychiatrists. Assessment should include a drug abuse history, preferably corroborated by others, evaluation of the mental state, and examination focusing on signs of drug abuse and HIV infection. Treatment should include the management of HIV disease, abstinence from drug abuse, and access to psychiatric care. New systems of health care service, including interdisciplinary case management, may be needed to manage patients with a triple diagnosis.\r"

Treatment is guided by an understanding of the patient's addictive disease, for which there are specific diagnostic criteria, and an understanding of the pharmacology of opiates of abuse and the medications used in treating opiate dependence. The opiate agonist, methadone, is useful for both detoxification and maintenance. The opiate antagonist, naloxone, is the treatment of choice for opiate overdose, and naltrexone, also an opiate antagonist, is a useful adjunct in subgroups of opiate-dependent patients for preventing relapse.

  ".W": "The antianginal and anti-ischemic effect of isosorbide dinitrate (ISDN), 120 mg once daily, and nifedipine, 20 mg twice daily, both in slow-release formulations, were compared in 17 patients with variant angina pectoris in a randomized, double-blind trial. The design included a placebo run-in period and two 6-week crossover periods of active treatment. Mean frequency of angina decreased significantly from 43 attacks per week during the placebo period to 4 per week with ISDN and 8 with nifedipine (p less than 0.001). Sublingual nitroglycerin consumption decreased significantly from 37 tablets per week with placebo to 3 tablets per week with ISDN and 7 with nifedipine (p less than 0.001). Both drugs reduced the silent and symptomatic ST-segment deviations on ambulatory electrocardiographic recording and increased maximal exercise tolerance. Episodes of coronary spasm could be provoked, by hyperventilation, in all patients during the placebo phase but in no patient during therapy with either active drug. Thus, both ISDN and nifedipine, in their slow-release formulations, are effective in the treatment of variant angina pectoris.\r"

  ".W": "The action of isorsorbide-5-mononitrate (IS-5-MN) infusion (range 6.0 to 10.0 mg/hour) was studied in 24 patients with and without acute heart failure (hemodynamic subsets I to IV) during acute myocardial infarction. Hemodynamic measurements were performed by right-sided cardiac catheterization. Intravenous IS-5-MN demonstrated significant hemodynamic effects compared with baseline values. In subsets I and II, a decrease in pulmonary wedge pressure (PWP) and in cardiac index (CI), without significant changes in heart rate, mean arterial pressure or systemic vascular resistance index were demonstrated. In subsets III and IV, a major increase in CI and a decrease in systemic vascular resistance index, as well as a decrease in PWP were found. Again no changes occurred in mean arterial pressure and heart rate. The dosage was similar in subsets I to IV (8.0, 7.9, 7.8 and 7.3 mg/hour); thus, the differences in the responses could not be attributed to dosage. It appears that several different patterns of hemodynamic IS-5-MN action exist, assuming that IS-5-MN operates on preload and afterload levels. The action of IS-5-MN mechanisms seems to be dependent on an initial hemodynamic subset. No patient had any deleterious hemodynamic effects. A decrease in CI in subsets I and II was not of clinical importance with these dosages. No nitrate tolerance during 9.0 hours of continuous therapy appeared.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

An exercise test (treadmill, Bruce protocol) was performed before and at 1, 6, 8 and 10 hours after oral administration of the drug. The patients were randomly assigned to receive IS-5-MN or placebo, and after 1 week of therapy were crossed over to the other formulations. The drug increased the exercise duration from 321 to 455 seconds at 1 hour (p less than 0.001). Time to moderate angina increased from 237 to 324 seconds (p less than 0.05) and time to ST depression greater than or equal to 1 mm increased from 150 to 307 seconds (p less than 0.01) at 1 hour. Placebo had no effect on any of the exercise parameters. Although partially attenuated at 6 hours, the effect of IS-5-MN remained statistically significant even at 8 hours, but not at 10 hours. It is concluded that the duration of action of a single tablet of IS-5-MN, given orally, is 8 hours.\r"

The previously reported nonrandom loss of maternal alleles in these tumors implied that the primary mutation occurred on the paternally derived chromosome and that it was \"unmasked\" by loss of the normal maternal allele. This, in turn, suggests that the paternally derived allele is more mutable than the maternal one. To investigate whether germinal mutations are seen with equal frequency in maternally versus paternally inherited chromosomes, we determined the parental origin of the de novo germinal 11p13 deletions in eight children by typing lymphocyte DNA from these children and from their parents for 11p13 RFLPs. In seven of the eight cases, the de novo deletion was of paternal origin. The one case of maternal origin was unremarkable in terms of the size or extent of the 11p13 deletion, and the child did develop WT. Transmission of 11p13 deletions by both maternal and paternal carriers of balanced translocations has been reported, although maternal inheritance predominates. These data, in addition to the general preponderance of paternally derived, de novo mutations at other loci, suggest that the increased frequency of paternal deletions we observed is due to an increased germinal mutation rate in males.\r"

The role of PFP/perforin in cytolytic reactions carried out in vivo is still unclear. Here, the authors performed immunohistochemical analysis using antibodies monospecific for perforin and made use of a murine uveitis model produced by intracameral inoculation of herpes simplex virus I (HSV-I). The main cell infiltrate found in the anterior segment of virus-inoculated eyes consisted of Thy-1+/asialo GM1+/CD8-/CD4- cells, presumably representing NK cells. Perforin staining was detected mainly in cells bearing this phenotype. Perforin was only detected in cells displaying the large granular lymphocyte morphology. A small number of perforin-positive cells (less than 5%) colabeled as CD8+, indicating that these cells could have belonged to the CTL lineage. These observations show for the first time the presence of perforin-containing NK cells in tissues of animals undergoing acute viral infections.\r"

It has been established, using double-labeling immunofluorescence, that smooth muscle cells (SMC) in normal aortic intima contain myosin, vimentin, and alpha-actin but do not react with antibodies against desmin. In contrast, 7 of 28 atherosclerotic plaques contained many cells expressing desmin in addition to the other cytoskeletal proteins characteristic of normal intima SMC. These cells were localized predominantly in the plaque cap and had the ultrastructural features of modulated SMC, ie, well-developed endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus. Besides, some cells in the 13 atherosclerotic plaques proved to be myosin, alpha actin, and desmin negative but contained vimentin and actin as revealed by fluorescent phalloidin. These cells were found in the immediate proximity of atheromatous material and reacted with a monoclonal antibody specific to SMC surface protein (11G10) but not with monoclonal anti-muscle actin (HHF35) and anti-macrophage (HAM56) antibodies. Electron microscopy of this plaque zone revealed that the cytoplasm of these cells was filled with rough endoplasmic reticulum and a developed Golgi complex. At the same time, a certain proportion of cells in this region retained morphologic features of differentiated SMC such as the presence of a basal lamina and myofilament bundles. The revealed peculiarities of cytoskeletal protein expression and the ultrastructure of cells in human aortic atherosclerotic plaques may be explained by a phenotypic modulation of vascular SMC.\r"

Glial cells labeled by anti-HLA-DR were consistent with microglia by light microscopic and ultrastructural criteria, and were colabeled with other microglial markers, including LN-1, Leu-M5, and leukocyte common antigen (LCA). In young and elderly subjects who died suddenly, anti-HLA-DR labeled microglia in the white matter, but far fewer cells in the gray matter. In subjects who died of chronic debilitating illness, such as Alzheimer's disease and carcinomatosis, anti-HLA-DR labeled numerous microglia throughout both the gray and white matter. In Alzheimer's disease, microglia were aggregated in compact senile plaques, but loosely associated with diffuse amyloid deposits. These results suggest that HLA-DR may be constitutively expressed in white matter, but induced in gray matter microglia in chronic disease states or in association with amyloid deposits.\r"

All infected cells showed nuclear staining with an anti-CMV antibody. Leu-M1 reacted with CMV-infected cells in cytoplasmic areas, particularly near the nucleus simulating the characteristic staining pattern of Reed-Sternberg (R-S) cells. Cytoplasmic staining intensified as the intranuclear inclusions increased in size. Reed-Sternberg cells showed characteristic Leu-M1 positivity along the cell membrane and golgi zone. At times, Leu-M1 staining of CMV-infected cells was indistinguishable from that of R-S cells. None of the R-S cells reacted with the antibody to CMV. Recognition of the reactivity of Leu-M1 with CMV-infected cells is important in avoiding misdiagnosis of CMV lymphadenitis as HD.\r"

All patients were treated postoperatively with heparin. Patients allocated to the study group received dicumarol (a coumarin derivative) orally postoperatively. The overall patency after 1 year was 75 +/- 6%, compared with 74 +/- 6%, after 2 years 65 +/- 9 compared with 57 +/- 8%, and after 3 years 46 +/- 11% compared with 42 +/- 9% (mean +/- SE) in the study and control groups, respectively. There were no statistically significant differences in limb salvage or survival rates between the two groups. In contrast, coumarin treatment was associated with serious bleeding complications in 4% to 5% of the study patients. As expected, limb salvage was lower in patients with critical ischemia (p less than 0.03), and this was also true for survival (p less than 0.04), which was also influenced by the level of the reconstruction; survival was lower in patients with femoro-distal reconstructions (p less than 0.001). Our results demonstrate that coumarin treatment does not improve outcome in routine femoro-popliteal and femoro-distal reconstructive surgery.\r"

  ".U": "90274098\r", 
  ".W": "There is increasing interest in determining the extent to which multiple characters related to drug sensitivity are influenced by common genes. The principal method for testing for the existence of such genetic correlations has been examination of pairs of mouse or rat lines selectively bred for sensitivity or resistance to a single behavioral effect of a drug. When a pair of selected lines is found to differ significantly on some trait other than the one on which they were selected, it is commonly concluded that significant genetic correlation between the traits exists, implying the action of a common set of genes on the two responses. In addition, results from comparisons of lines of animals selected for trait X and tested for trait Y may be compared with results from lines selected for trait Y and tested for trait X. As the number of correlated responses in selected lines increases, it becomes more important to adhere to sensible, consensual guidelines for interpreting such line differences. The principles underlying phenotypic and genotypic correlational analyses with selected lines are discussed. A scheme is presented to allow standardization across laboratories of inferences about the relative strength of genetic association from experiments with selected lines. Statistical and practical experimental issues are addressed. Estimates of genetic correlations may also be derived from the correlation of mean trait values across a panel of inbred strains. Existing data have sometimes found estimates of genetic correlations made with one approach to be inconsistent with those estimated in other ways. Possible reasons for this are discussed. Finally, the relationship between phenotypic correlations and genetic correlations is discussed. Phenotypic and genetic correlations for a pair of traits may differ widely, and may even be opposite in sign. Both are characteristic of the population from which they are sampled. Phenotypic correlations estimated within selected lines may change over time, as the additive genetic variance in the selected trait is exhausted. A specific example of this phenomenon is given.\r"

Eighty-two normally menstruating women (52 LR and 30 HR) monitored their alcohol intake, physical and affective distress symptoms, and global stress level daily for two consecutive menstrual cycles. Subjects were unaware that their menstrual cycles were being monitored. The results confirmed the presence of increased physical distress symptomatology during the premenstrual and menstrual phases but did not show variation in negative affect or global stress throughout the menstrual cycle. High risk subjects were aware that they were at higher risk for alcoholism and consumed more alcohol. However, alcohol consumption was not related to the menstrual cycle, distress symptoms, or global stress. Subjects reported that they drank most frequently with others for pleasure enhancement and rarely for pain or tension-reduction. Subjects also drank more on weekends than weekdays. These findings argue against the menstrual cycle as etiological in the development of alcoholism. It would appear that social factors influence alcohol consumption in young nonalcoholic women.\r"

Furthermore, particulate kinase phosphorylating activity toward an endogenous protein (kinase regulatory subunit, RII) was altered by alcohol consumption in a strain-specific manner. The changes in cyclic AMP binding and phosphorylating activity appeared to result from phenotypic differences in the brain's response to alcohol. Thus, low preference animals were sensitive to alcohol and showed a large decrease in cyclic AMP binding and an increase in phosphorylation of regulatory subunit in response to alcohol. In contrast, high preference strain had only a small decrease in cyclic AMP binding and a decrease in phosphorylation, even though these animals consumed a significantly larger dose of alcohol. These data suggest that changes in cyclic AMP binding and/or phosphorylation of kinase regulatory subunit may be phenotypic markers of alcohol preference in inbred mice.\r"

  ".W": "The acute effects of ethanol (75 mmol/kg body weight, intraperitoneal) on rates of protein synthesis in bone tibia) and skin of young (approximately 100 g body weight) laboratory rats was investigated. Plasma ethanol levels were raised to approximately 40 mmol/liter. At 2.5 hr, rates of protein synthesis were measured with a flooding dose of L-[4-3H]phenylalanine. In bone the protein-bound specific radioactivities, fractional synthesis rates, and synthesis rates relative to RNA and DNA were significantly reduced by approximately 30%. In skin these variables similarly decreased in response to ethanol treatment, by approximately 25%. The reduction in absolute rates of protein synthesis in bone (delta, 0.7 g protein/day/kg body weight) and skin (delta, 3.4 g protein/day/kg body weight) were comparable to the reductions in liver and skeletal muscle in response to acute ethanol. As bone and skin contribute to a quarter of whole body protein synthesis, it was concluded that these observations may have important implications for whole body protein homeostasis.\r"

As hepatic cytochromes P450 oxidize EF to a reactive intermediate, we assessed whether one such microsomal enzyme, ethanol-inducible P450IIE1, plays an obligatory role in EF metabolic activation and hepatotoxicity. Liver microsomes from rats fed ethanol (36% of total calories for 14 days) oxidized 1 mM EF (measured by its defluorination) at rates nearly 10-fold greater than those from control rats, reflecting the markedly enhanced content of immunoreactive microsomal P450IIE1 in the former animals. P450IIE1 involvement in hepatic EF oxidation was further suggested by the pronounced inhibition of microsomal defluorination noted with P450IIE1 antibodies and with ethanol, a specific substrate for this enzyme. EF administration to rats treated chronically with ethanol caused significant elevations in plasma levels of aspartate and alanine aminotransferases and glutamate dehydrogenase, indicative of hepatic injury, whereas concurrent treatment of naive rats with EF and ethanol failed to produce the same effect. Our results imply that ethanol-inducible P450IIE1 is the primary catalyst of hepatic EF bioactivation and that the increased bioactivation occurring in vivo secondary to chronic ethanol consumption is attendant with an increased incidence of EF hepatotoxicity.\r"

To study serum beta-hexosaminidase (beta-HEX) as a marker of heavy drinking, it was compared with GGT, ASAT, and ALAT in three study groups: twenty-five drunken arrestees, 16 social drinkers, and 27 teetotallers. Mean serum beta-HEX levels were two times higher among drunken arrestees than among social drinkers or teetotallers. Average daily alcohol intake during the preceding 30 days in the pooled group of drunken arrestees and social drinkers correlated positively (r = 0.69; p less than 0.0001) with serum beta-HEX. The sensitivity of beta-HEX in the detection of heavy drinking, defined as over 60 g ethanol daily, was 85.7% compared to 47.6% for GGT. The specificity of beta-HEX was 97.6%. The positive correlations between beta-HEX and ASAT (r = 0.74; p less than 0.0001) and ALAT (r = 0.41; p less than 0.05) indicate that increased serum beta-HEX level may reflect early liver injury. Serum beta-HEX seems to be a sensitive biological marker of heavy drinking reflecting better the ingested amounts of alcohol than GGT.\r"

The poor response was due to a serum inhibitor which reduced chemotactic activity of control serum by 75.6% but had no effect on chemotaxis to N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine. The level of inhibitor activity in each patient did not correlate with the severity of liver dysfunction. In spite of the universal presence of the chemotactic factor inhibitor in all patients' sera, their in vivo PMN delivery into skin chambers was similar to controls. Thus, patients with alcoholic cirrhosis appear able to deliver PMNs normally in response to local tissue injury.\r"

Measurements of high-dose (4.1 g/kg) effects of ethanol were hypothermia, sleep time, and blood ethanol content at regaining of righting response, and the index of low-dose (1.875 g/kg) sensitivity was distance traveled during a 5-min period immediately following intraperitoneal injection with ethanol. The results indicated wide genetic variation in hypothermia and ethanol-induced locomotor activation in a manner consistent with polygenic influence. Furthermore, correlations between low-dose locomotor activity and hypnotic dose effects tended to be low and nonsignificant, indicating independence of inherited mechanisms underlying high- and low-dose ethanol sensitivity.\r"

  ".W": "In 46 patients experiencing traumatic brain injury, we studied the interactions of alcohol intoxication and severity of neurologic dysfunction on the resulting sympathetic nervous system activation. Sixty percent of the variation in norepinephrine (p less than 0.0001) and more than 50% of the variation in epinephrine (p less than 0.0001) were due to the initial ethanol concentrations and extent of brain injury assessed by the admission Glasgow Coma Score (GCS). As brain function deteriorated plasma cathecholamines rose (p less than 0.0001), but ethanol qualitatively and quantitatively modified this observation. The magnitude of the sympathetic response to worsening neurologic function was progressively diminished in association with increasing ethanol levels, i.e., the inverse relationship of GCS values with both norepinephrine and epinephrine was flattened. In comatose patients (GCS less than 8) increasing ethanol levels was associated with progressively decreasing norepinephrine and epinephrine responses (p less than 0.04), such that catecholamines were reduced by 80 to 90% at ethanol concentrations approaching 400 mg/dl (87.0 mmol/l). However, the impact of ethanol on the degree of sympathetic nervous system activation depended upon the degree of injury; the apparent ethanol suppression was greatest in patients with the most severe neurologic dysfunction (GCS 3 or 4), but it diminished as neurologic function improved. We conclude that the presence of alcohol appears to modify the rise in catecholamine levels following traumatic brain injury in a dose-dependent manner and alters the relationship between neurologic dysfunction and SNS activation. These alterations may have profound effects on patient morbidity in the immediate post-accident period.\r"

  ".W": "A murine aging model was employed to assess effects of ethanol exposure on the T-cell proliferative response to mitogenic stimulation and on the T cell-dependent primary antibody response to sheep red blood cells (RBC) in vitro. Splenic cells from young (3-5 months) and old (28-32 months) BALB/c mice were first assessed for their ability to produce interleukin (IL) 2 and proliferate in response to mitogenic stimulation in the presence of various doses of ethanol. Then, splenic T blast cells from young and old mice, generated by Con A-activation, were assessed for their IL2-dependent proliferative capacity in the presence of various doses of ethanol. Finally, splenic cells of young and old mice were assessed for their ability to generate plaque-forming cells (PFC) in response to sheep RBC in the presence of various doses of ethanol. The results revealed that ethanol has a much greater suppressive effect on old than young splenic T cells (10-15 times), as judged by their ability to proliferate in response to mitogenic stimulation. However, the magnitude of the difference in the suppressive effect is less when the cells are cycling (2 times). Furthermore, ethanol had only a minimal suppressive effect on IL2 production by T cells of both young and old mice, even at the concentration of 100 mM. These findings would suggest that the ethanol-mediated suppression of T cell proliferation of both young and old mice is more likely due to an impairment of metabolic event(s) associated with or subsequent to the interaction of IL2 and IL2 receptor leading to cellular replication.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Socioeconomic status did not moderate the effect of familial alcoholism/problem drinking on offspring alcohol abuse/dependence. Relative odds ratios indicated that the risk of alcohol abuse/dependence associated with a positive family history increased with increasing age among whites; whereas, it decreased with increasing age among blacks. Among whites, the relative odds ratio for the effect of family history was higher for females than for males; however, among blacks it was higher for males than females.

High factor intercorrelations were reported for hyperactivity/impulsivity and antisocial/oppositional behaviors. Differential predictive relations were found between the four factors and adolescent problem behaviors.

Peer dysfunction was most highly correlated with internalizing, depressive symptoms. Learning problems correlated most highly with poor school performance, and moderately with alcohol problems and depressive symptoms.

  ".W": "Many of the toxic metabolic actions of ethanol on the liver have been ascribed to the enhanced cellular production of NADH, which arises as a consequence of the oxidation of ethanol by alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH). Experiments were conducted to evaluate whether NADH generated from a reconstituted system containing ethanol plus NAD+ plus ADH could interact with ferric chelates to promote microsomal lipid peroxidation and generation of a hydroxyl radical (OH)-like species. In the presence of the reconstituted system and iron, microsomes produced.OH as assessed by the oxidation of .OH scavenging agents. This oxidation was inhibited by catalase and competitive.OH scavengers but not by superoxide dismutase. The ADH-dependent microsomal production of.OH was effectively catalyzed by ferric-EDTA and -diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid (-DTPA), but not by ferric-ATP or -citrate. However, all these ferric chelates were reduced by the microsomes in the presence of the reconstituted system. Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) was produced in the presence of ADH and appeared to be a limiting factor for the production of.OH. The reconstituted system also catalyzed microsomal lipid peroxidation, and the pattern of effectiveness of ferric chelates was opposite that of catalysis of.OH production. There was little effect by catalase, superoxide dismutase or dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) on the ADH-dependent microsomal lipid peroxidation. The reconstituted system was characterized with respect to dependence on NAD+ and ADH; ethanol could be replaced by other alcohols, which are substrates for ADH. Pyrazole, a potent inhibitor of ADH, blocked the ability of the reconstituted system to interact with iron and microsomes to produce reactive oxygen species.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Because a critical element in T-cell proliferation is the production of interleukin-2, experiments were designed to evaluate the influence of ethanol on the production and utilization of interleukin-2 by spleen cells from ethanol-treated animals. To ensure that changes in spleen cell responses to mitogenic stimulation were not simply caused by a loss of responding T cells, we tested nylon wool-nonadherent cells. The response to concanavalin A of isolated T cells from ethanol-treated rats was consistently less than that of equivalent numbers of cells from control animals. The addition of recombinant interleukin-2 to cultures of T cells did not correct the defect in proliferation to concanavalin A noted in cells from ethanol-treated rats. Further study results demonstrated that interleukin-2 production by T cells from ethanol-treated animals was equal to or greater than that by cells from animals given control diet. Blast cells recovered from 48-hr concanavalin A-stimulated spleen cell cultures from ethanol-treated animals, however, showed a decreased ability to proliferate in response to exogenous interleukin-2. Binding of 125I-interleukin-2 to blast cells resulting from concanavalin A stimulation, under conditions that detected high-affinity binding, was similar in cells from treated and control animals. These data indicate that the deficiency in proliferation of lymphocytes from ethanol-treated animals is not caused by a lack of interleukin-2 production by the T cells.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "In an attempt to assess the diagnostic values of serum gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT) and mean corpuscular volume (MCV) variations as markers of liver disease and of abstinence in alcoholic patients, we compared 174 patients with alcoholic cirrhosis, 175 with noncirrhotic alcoholic liver disease and 67 patients with nonalcoholic cirrhosis. GGT and MCV values were checked three times, the day of admission, 7 days later, and on the last sample available during follow-up (1 to 12 months), and were compared according to the liver disease and abstinence. A decrease of GGT activity during the 1st week of hospitalization was noted in alcoholics with (-9 IU/liter) or without (-13 IU/liter) cirrhosis and not in nonalcoholic cirrhosis (+8 IU/liter), without MCV variations. During follow-up, median GGT activity was strikingly different in abstinent patients with (27 IU/liter) or without (21 IU/liter) cirrhosis and in nonabstinent patients (99 IU/liter and 123 IU/liter, respectively) (p less than 0.001). MCV decrease was noted in alcoholics whatever their abstinence or not, contrasting with the absence of decrease in nonalcoholic patients. For the diagnosis of alcoholism in cirrhotic patients, the positive predictive value (PPV) of a GGT or a MCV decrease during the 1st week of hospitalization was 0.82 and 0.78, respectively, and the negative predictive value (NPV) was 0.33 and 0.70, respectively. For abstinence during follow-up, the PPV of a GGT activity less than 50 IU/liter was 0.92 and the NPV was 0.65.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Plasma tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha), interleukin 1 alpha (IL-1 alpha), and interleukin 1 beta (IL-1 beta) were measured in plasma samples obtained from 23 patients with severe alcoholic hepatitis on admission and after 30 days of hospitalization. Over a 2-year follow-up period, 14 patients died at a mean time of 8 months following discharge. The presence of elevated plasma TNF alpha either at admission or discharge from the hospital was associated with death in 82% (14/17) of patients. By contrast absence of elevated plasma TNF alpha was associated with survival in 100% (6/6). The difference in survival with and without detectable plasma TNF alpha was significant at p = 0.0022. Plasma TNF alpha was not elevated in alcoholic patients without clinically apparent liver disease, with alcoholic cirrhosis, or in nonalcoholic healthy controls. Plasma IL-1 alpha was also significantly increased in alcoholic hepatitis whereas IL-1 beta was not. Neither IL-1 alpha nor beta was correlated with outcome in the alcoholic hepatitis group. It is concluded that the presence of elevated plasma TNF alpha is a significant predictor of decreased long-term survival in patients with severe alcoholic hepatitis.\r"

Simultaneous measurements of RV pressure (using a modified pulmonary artery catheter), RV stroke output (thermodilution), and RV dimensions (two-dimensional echocardiography), permitted a beat to beat evaluation of RV function throughout the mechanical respiratory cycle. When compared with expiration, lung inflation produced an increase in RV systolic pressure and volume, an increase in RV diastolic volume with an unchanged RV diastolic pressure, and a marked decrease in RV ejection fraction. It is concluded that controlled ventilation altered RV function primarily by increasing RV afterload during the lung inflation period.\r"

A Band-Aid-like patch containing either scopolamine or placebo was placed behind the ear the night before surgery. Anesthesia was induced with fentanyl (0.5-2 micrograms/kg iv), thiopental (3-5 mg/kg iv), and succinylcholine (1-1.5 mg/kg iv) and maintained with isoflurane (0.2-2%) and nitrous oxide (60%) in oxygen. Scopolamine-treated patients had less nausea, retching, and vomiting compared with placebo-treated patients (P = 0.0029). Severe nausea and/or vomiting was present in 62% of the placebo group but only 37% of those getting the scopolamine patch. Repeated episodes of retching and vomiting were also less frequent in the scopolamine group compared with the placebo group (23% vs. 41%; P = 0.0213) as was the need for additional antiemetic therapy (13% vs. 32%; P = 0.0013). Patients in the scopolamine group were also discharged from the hospital sooner (4 +/- 1.3 vs. 4.5 +/- 1.5 h; P = 0.0487). Side effects were more frequent among those patients treated with the scopolamine patch (91% vs. 45%; P less than 0.05) but were not troublesome. The authors conclude that transdermal scopolamine is a safe and effective antiemetic for outpatients undergoing laparoscopy.\r"

Twenty-eight ASA physical status 2 women scheduled to undergo elective cesarean section were randomized into two groups to either receive fentanyl intravenously and saline epidurally or fentanyl epidurally and saline intravenously. After delivery of the infants under epidural anesthesia, each patient received a bolus of fentanyl 1.5 microgram/kg either intravenously or epidurally, and a fentanyl infusion was begun via the same route. Concurrently, a saline bolus and infusion were given via the alternate route. The rates of the fentanyl and saline infusions were adjusted until each patient was comfortable. Patients rated their pain, nausea, and pruritus on visual analogue scales. Sedation was evaluated by an observer. Respiratory depression was evaluated by end-tidal PCO2. Data were analyzed by unpaired two-tail t tests. Plasma fentanyl concentrations were measured at 12 and 24 h. Three patients in the iv group were dropped from the study because of inadequate pain relief. For the remaining 25 patients, similar infusion rates of fentanyl were required to produce similar levels of analgesia at 12 and 24 h. The severity of nausea, pruritus and sedation, and end-tidal PCO2 were similar for both groups. The plasma concentrations of fentanyl were significantly greater in those who received iv fentanyl at 12 h but not at 24 h.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

However, bronchodilation is typically observed during and immediately after exercise. We measured the bronchoconstrictor responses to increasing concentrations of inhaled methacholine at rest and during two levels of exercise in seven asthmatic subjects to determine the protection against bronchoconstriction afforded by exercise. On the first day, an incremental Stage 1 exercise test was performed to determine the work capacity (Wcap) of each subject. On the second, third, and fourth days, methacholine was inhaled at rest or during steady-state exercise at one-third or two-thirds of Wcap. The bronchoconstrictor response to methacholine was significantly reduced during exercise (p less than 0.0001). The concentration of methacholine required to produce a 20% reduction in FEV1 (PC20) increased from 2.80 mg/ml (%SEM, 1.62) at rest to 7.29 mg/ml (%SEM, 1.43) during exercise at one-third Wcap, and to 31.03 mg/ml (%SEM, 1.74) during exercise at two-thirds Wcap (p less than 0.001). This study has demonstrated that there is greater than tenfold protection against bronchoconstriction by methacholine during exercise, and the magnitude of the protection depends on the intensity of exercise performed. The mechanism of this protection is not known, but may have clinical utility.\r"

We have examined the effect of inhaled 15-HETE on the early and late asthmatic responses (EAR and LAR) and the associated change in nonspecific bronchial responsiveness to inhaled allergen in 10 subjects with atopic asthma. On 2 separate days 3 wk apart, subjects inhaled either 70 nmol 15-HETE or the diluent (sodium phosphate buffer) in a randomized and double-blind fashion, followed by a dose of allergen that had previously been shown to produce a 25% fall in baseline FEV1. Analysis of the area under the FEV1 response time course curves (AUC) in the first hour revealed that preinhalation with 15-HETE increased the EAR by 39% from that achieved after the diluent (p less than 0.05). In the seven subjects who were classified as dual responders by developing a LAR previously (greater than 15% fall in baseline FEV1 3 to 8 h after allergen challenge), 15-HETE did not cause any significant change in the magnitude of the LAR when compared with that observed after placebo. The values of the provocation concentration of histamine causing a 20% fall in FEV1 (Pc20) at 8 h postchallenge were significantly reduced on both study days when compared with the corresponding preallergen challenge values, whether analyzed for the whole group or for the seven dual responders (p less than 0.05). 15-HETE had no effect on this allergen-acquired airway hyperresponsiveness to histamine when compared with the diluent.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Right ventricular ejection fraction (RVEF), end-diastolic volume (EDV) and end-ejection volume were measured by thermodilution. Right ventricular end-ejection pressure-volume relations (RVEEPVR) were determined at baseline and at 20 cm H2O PEEP, both before and after RCA occlusion. In four of the dogs, RVEEPVR were also determined at 10 cm H2O PEEP after RCA occlusion. With intact RCA flow, RVEF declined with PEEP (37 +/- 5 to 19 +/- 6%) with no significant change in EDV (50 +/- 11 to 42 +/- 11 ml) or end-ejection volume (31 +/- 7 to 36 +/- 9 ml). RVEEPVR and right ventricular myocardial blood flow were also unchanged with PEEP. After RCA occlusion, RVEF declined with PEEP (27 +/- 4 to 15 +/- 5%) in association with a significant increase in end-ejection volume (39 +/- 8 to 49 +/- 10 ml), but no change in EDV (53 to 55 ml). In addition, RVEEPVR and myocardial blood flow declined with RCA occlusion, and declined further with 20 cm H2O, but not with 10 cm H2O PEEP, after RCA occlusion. Therefore, in this experimental model, right ventricular performance was adversely affected during PEEP when right coronary blood flow was limited.\r"

  ".U": "90274262\r", 
  ".W": "Respiratory tract nerves have cell bodies outside (sensory, sympathetic) and inside (parasympathetic) the organ and contain bioactive peptides. These include calcitonin gene-related peptide and tachykinins (sensory nerves), vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (parasympathetic nerves), and neuropeptide with tyrosine (sympathetic nerves). Because transplantation interrupts the extrinsic nerve supply to the tissues, we have examined transplanted human respiratory tracts (n = 11) removed at retransplantation 2 to 42 months after the primary transplant in order to determine whether any nerves and peptide synthesis persist. As controls to establish nerve distribution in human respiratory tract, tissues were obtained from 10 lung resections and five autopsies. Cryostat sections were immunostained to demonstrate the general neural marker PGP 9.5, neuropeptides, and the catecholamine-synthesizing enzyme tyrosine hydroxylase. Nerves immunoreactive for PGP 9.5 were detected in all transplanted tissues. They were fewer in number overall than in control tissue, significantly so in epithelium of trachea and bronchus where they were present sparsely in only three cases. Nerves immunoreactive for tyrosine hydroxylase were significantly fewer in the transplants. Peptide-immunoreactive nerves were also reduced in number in the transplants, except for vasoactive intestinal polypeptide, which was only significantly changed in blood vessels in the lung. Ganglion cells immunoreactive for tyrosine hydroxylase and neuropeptide with tyrosine were seen in the transplanted tissues in five cases, but never in the control tissues. We conclude that whereas some nerves and neuropeptide synthesis persist after extrinsic pulmonary denervation, potentially significant changes also occur, including the appearance in intrinsic parasympathetic neurones of immunoreactivity for a catecholamine-synthesizing enzyme and a peptide normally found in sympathetic nerves.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE: To determine whether oral corticosteroids can prevent early deterioration in patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)-related Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia. DESIGN: Prospective, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trial. METHODS: Included patients were having their first P. carinii pneumonia episode, had no other known active pulmonary pathology, had no contraindications for corticosteroids, received no anti-P. carinii pneumonia medications for more than 48 hours, and had oxygen saturation by pulse oximetry of 85% or more and less than 90% at rest or a 5-percentage-point decrease in oxygen saturation with exercise while breathing room air. Consenting subjects were randomly assigned to prednisone, 60 mg/d for 7 days, followed by a progressive tapering over 14 days or to an identical placebo. Early deterioration, the endpoint of the trial, was defined as a 10% decrease in baseline oxygen saturation on day 3 or thereafter. The cases of patients developing early deterioration were considered to be failures of treatment; the code was then broken, and the patient's treatment was left to the judgment of the treating physician. Sequential analysis was done with the primary variable being development of early deterioration. RESULTS: The trial was terminated 5 April 1989 on the basis of the sequential analysis when a total of nine episodes of early deterioration had occurred in the first 37 patients at an overall significance level of P = 0.0136. A total of 8 of 19 placebo-treated patients (42.1%) developed early deterioration compared with only 1 of 18 patients (5.6%) treated with corticosteroids. Baseline characteristics were not statistically different between the two treatment groups. The adjusted odds ratio for the treatment effect was 5.87 (95% CI, 1.27 to 27.4). The adjusted point estimates for the probability of early deterioration in the placebo and corticosteroid groups were 43% and 12%, respectively. All 8 patients in the placebo group developing early deterioration recovered rapidly with addition of corticosteroid treatment. The single patient with early deterioration in the corticosteroid group died on day 6 from overwhelming P. carinii pneumonia, as documented at autopsy. The corticosteroid group had an increased exercise tolerance on day 7 that persisted at day 30. CONCLUSION: Oral corticosteroids prevent early deterioration and increase exercise tolerance in patients with moderately severe AIDS-related P. carinii pneumonia.\r"

DESIGN: A prospective, randomized, double-blind trial with follow-up at 2, 4, and 8 weeks after enrollment. PATIENTS: Seventy-seven evaluable men with objective evidence of nongonococcal urethritis (36 in the erythromycin group and 41 in the placebo group) with a mean age of 28 years, a median duration of urethritis of 3 months, and a median number of three previous antimicrobial regimens. INTERVENTION: Erythromycin, 500 mg, or placebo four times daily for 3 weeks. RESULTS: After 2 weeks of treatment, urethral symptoms resolved in 13 of 25 erythromycin-treated patients compared with 8 of 34 placebo-treated patients (P = 0.03). Erythromycin also resulted in more frequent resolution of urethral discharge and leukocytosis at all visits compared with placebo but these differences were not statistically significant. First-voided urine leukocyte counts decreased, however, by a median of 89% (95% CI, -96% to -67%) in the erythromycin group compared with 23% (CI, -73% to 83%) in the placebo group after treatment (P = 0.02 for the difference in changes). Further, in men with prostatic inflammation, urinary leukocyte counts decreased by a median of 94% (CI, -99% to -83%) after treatment in erythromycin-treated patients compared with a 46% increase (CI, -57% to 290%) in placebo-treated patients (P = 0.0003 for the difference in changes). CONCLUSION: A 3-week regimen of erythromycin was more effective than placebo in improving symptoms and in reducing pyuria in men with persistent or recurrent nongonococcal urethritis, especially among men with prostatic inflammation.\r"

  ".W": "PURPOSE: To evaluate the clinical efficacy of ambulatory electrocardiographic (ECG) monitoring and to develop guidelines for its use in clinical practice. DATA IDENTIFICATION: Studies reported since January 1978 were identified both through computer searches using Index Medicus and extensive manual searching of bibliographies of identified articles. STUDY SELECTION: Only studies that fulfilled methodologic criteria designed to limit bias were reviewed. DATA EXTRACTION: Information describing population and study results was assessed in four major categories (variability, diagnosis, prognosis, and therapy guidance) for both arrhythmia monitoring and ST-segment analysis. RESULTS OF DATA ANALYSIS: The day-to-day variability of arrhythmia and myocardial ischemia detected by ambulatory ECG monitoring may be considerable in an individual patient. Caution must therefore be used in interpreting serial tests. Ambulatory ECG monitoring with diary correlation permits documentation of cardiac arrhythmias causing symptoms, but the diagnostic yield is low unless symptoms are frequent. Such monitoring can provide information about prognosis in patients after acute myocardial infarction. The amount of prognostic information obtained is modest and is outweighed by other measures. There is insufficient information to make conclusions about such monitoring and prognosis in other conditions. Serial ambulatory ECG monitoring may be used to assess the effect of an antiarrhythmic drug in patients with frequent and reproducible ventricular ectopy. The effect of arrhythmia suppression on survival is uncertain. Because of its low sensitivity and specificity, analysis of ST-segment changes during ambulatory ECG monitoring is inaccurate in establishing or excluding the presence of coronary disease. Although anti-ischemic interventions reduce the frequency and duration of ST-segment changes on monitoring, there are no data on the utility of using reduction or elimination of the changes as the endpoint of therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Ambulatory ECG monitoring can provide diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic information in many situations, but similar information often may be better obtained in other ways.\r"

Structured abstracts for original studies require authors to systematically disclose the objective, basic research design, clinical setting, participants, interventions (if any), main outcome measurements, results, and conclusions; and for literature reviews the objective, data sources, methods of study selection, data extraction and synthesis, and conclusions. More informative abstracts of this kind can facilitate peer review before publication, assist clinical readers to find articles that are both scientifically sound and applicable to their practices, and allow more precise computerized literature searches. We review the feasibility, acceptability, and dissemination of structured abstracts, reassess the underlying strategy, and describe modifications of the approach.

  ".W": "STUDY OBJECTIVE: To determine the diagnostic criteria (phase I) and to assess the accuracy (phase II) of an objective Doppler-Valsalva pressure method as compared with contrast venography for the diagnosis of acute deep-leg-vein thrombosis in symptomatic outpatients. DESIGN: A two-phase prospective study in consecutive patients. Doppler ultrasound strip-chart recordings and venograms were independently analyzed by experienced observers. SETTING: Referral-based medical clinics at university medical centers. PATIENTS: One hundred and ten (phase I) and one hundred and fifty-five (phase II) patients who had clinically suspected venous thrombosis and were referred by their general practitioners were included. METHODS AND MEASUREMENTS: A normal Doppler test result was defined as a cyclic spontaneous signal (S-signal), a continuous S-signal with a Valsalva pressure of less than 6.5 mm Hg, or an absent S-signal with flow after cessation of the Valsalva maneuver. A continuous S-signal with a Valsalva pressure of 6.5 mm Hg or more or an absent S-signal without flow after cessation of the Valsalva maneuver were defined as abnormal test results. The accuracy indices for proximal vein thrombosis in phase II (155 patients; prevalence, 31%) were sensitivity, 91% (95% CI, 79% to 98%), and specificity, 99% (CI, 97% to 100%). All 3 patients with isolated calf-vein thrombosis had normal Doppler test results. CONCLUSIONS: The objective Doppler method is an accurate, reproducible, and simple method for detection of venous thrombosis in symptomatic outpatients.\r"

While all the healthy age- and sex-matched control subjects had VZV-specific IgG antibodies, VZV-specific IgA antibodies were detected in a low titer (dilution = 2) in only three of the subjects. By using VZV-specific IgA antibody titers greater than or equal to 2 and greater than or equal to 4 by the immunoperoxidase assay as a \"cutoff\" for younger and older patients with Ramsay Hunt syndrome, respectively, an early diagnosis of the disease can be obtained in 89% of the younger and in 64% of the older patients by a single serum sample.\r"

  ".W": "HIV-1 infection has clearly been shown to induce a vigorous CTL response in infected people, and this response is present at a time when immune function otherwise is globally impaired. HIV-1-specific CTL are detectable both in peripheral blood and tissues of infected people, and are aimed at multiple viral proteins. The precise epitopes recognized by these CTL are now being defined, and the establishment of CTL clones should facilitate further functional analysis of these cells. However, the central question as to the clinical relevance of HIV-1-specific CTL remains. By analogy with animal model systems of virus infection, it is reasonable to postulate that HIV-1-specific CTL serve a protective role as a host defense. In this regard, in vitro data indicate that HIV-1-specific CTL can suppress viral replication, and longitudinal clinical studies indicate that the vigorous CTL activity seen in the early stages of infection declines with disease progression. Alternatively, the presence of HIV-1-specific CTL in tissues such as the lung and brain have to at least raise the possibility that these cells may be contributing to the pathologic consequences of infection. In addition, the relative protective effects of virus-specific CTL compared to other effector mechanisms such as ADCC and neutralizing antibodies remain to be determined. Nevertheless, recent data in the SIV vaccine model give reason for encouragement that a state of protective immunity can be achieved in AIDS-like illness caused by retroviruses. The search continues presently not only for the parameters which define protective immunity in HIV-1 infection, but also for the ideal HIV-1 immunogens to be used for vaccination of human populations.\r"

The affinity of Celltech gp120 from sCD4 is 2.3 nM, indistinguishable from that of gp120 extracted from HIV-1 virions. Baculovirus gp120 (ABT) and gp160 also have a high affinity for sCD4. A significant proportion of anti-gp120 antibodies in HIV-positive human sera recognize epitopes that are dependent on the mammalian glycosylation pattern, and a human HIV-positive serum inhibits the binding of mammalian gp120 to sCD4 five- to 10-fold more potently than it inhibits baculovirus gp120 binding to sCD4.\r"

CMV was identified by detection of early antigen fluorescent foci (DEAFF) testing in cell cultures of BAL fluid. The short- and long-term survival of all patients was similar regardless of whether PCP, CMV or both were detected at bronchoscopy. Ten out of 14 patients with CMV alone and 13 out of 26 with both CMV and PCP were treated with anti-CMV therapy, but the short- and long-term mortality was similar to that in patients who had no specific antiviral therapy. Extrapulmonary recurrence of CMV (retinitis or gastrointestinal disease) occurred in 22% of patients with evidence of CMV in BAL compared with 16% of those with PCP alone, but this difference was not statistically significant and this recurrence rate was independent of anti-CMV therapy. Detection of CMV shedding from more than one site (BAL, urine, throat or blood) was associated with a worse prognosis at 3 months than in patients in whom CMV was detected in BAL alone. It does not appear that finding CMV shedding is a guide to the cause of pneumonia or an indication for treatment in AIDS patients.\r"

All the kits investigated performed well on a panel of 47 routine anti-HIV-1-positive specimens, but on series of anti-HIV-1-seroconversion specimens from seven plasmapheresis donors, two of the peptide assays, Biochrom and Pharmacia, performed less well than the other assays. On a panel of anti-HIV-2-positive specimens, all the assays except Biochrom detected all 33 positive sera, though the reactions of some of them in the Abbott assay were relatively weak. In deciding whether to introduce a combined assay in place of an anti-HIV-1 assay, cost, specificity, the availability of confirmatory tests and the prevalence of HIV-2 in the locality, as well as sensitivity, should be considered.\r"

In hypertensive compared with normotensive subjects, fasting glucose and insulin levels were similar, but the integrated insulinemic responses to glucose were 45% greater (312 +/- 13.4 v 215 +/- 7.5 microU/mL, P less than .001). In hypertension, Mgif levels were significantly reduced (183 +/- 9 v 251 +/- 9 mumol/L, P less than .001), and for all subjects were closely and inversely related to systolic (r = -0.77, P less than .001) and diastolic (r = -0.81, P less than .001) blood pressures, and to the integrated insulin response (r = -0.72, P less than .001). Furthermore, while insulin responses were also related to the underlying systolic (r = 0.69, P less than .001) and diastolic (r = .73, P less than .001) pressures, these relations were no longer significant when adjusted for Mgif levels. We hypothesize that hypertension and peripheral insulin resistance may be different clinical expressions of a common abnormal intracellular ionic environment, characterized at least in part by suppressed levels of intracellular free magnesium.\r"

Blood pressure fell significantly (P less than .001) from (mean +/- SEM) 167 +/- 3/99 +/- 1 to 142 +/- 3/88 +/- 1 mm Hg. However, mean (+/- SEM) fasting plasma glucose concentration increased significantly (P less than .001) from 132 +/- 11 to 153 +/- 10 mg/dL. In addition, significant increases (P less than .05) were noted in fasting concentration of plasma total triglyceride, very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL)-triglyceride and VLDL-cholesterol, whereas fasting plasma high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol was significantly lower (P less than .05). Thus, a common treatment program for hypertension exacerbated the abnormalities of carbohydrate and lipid metabolism commonly present in patients with NIDDM. Since the changes noted would increase risk of vascular disease, attention should be focused on selection of treatment programs for lowering blood pressure in patients with NIDDM in order to avoid this outcome.\r"

  ".W": "Previous studies have shown that tumor necrosis factors (TNFs) inhibit the proliferative effects of crude or purified colony-stimulating factors (CSFs) on low density human bone marrow cell fractions. In the present study we investigated the effects of TNF alpha on the growth of highly purified CD34+ human hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPC) in response to recombinant CSFs. In short-term liquid cultures (5 to 8 days), TNF alpha strongly potentiates interleukin-3 (IL-3) and granulocyte-macrophage-CSF (GM-CSF)-induced growth of CD34+ HPC, while it has no proliferative effect per se. Within 8 days, the number of viable cells obtained in TNF alpha-supplemented cultures is threefold higher than in cultures carried out with IL-3 or GM-CSF alone. Secondary liquid cultures showed that the potentiating effect of TNF alpha on IL-3-induced proliferation of CD34+ HPC does not result from an IL-3-dependent generation of TNF alpha responsive cells. Limiting dilution analysis indicates that TNF alpha increases both the frequency of IL-3 responding cells and the average size of the IL-3-dependent clones. The potentiating effect of TNF alpha on IL-3- and GM-CSF-dependent growth of CD34+ HPC is also observed in day 7 colony assays. Under these short-term culture conditions, TNF alpha does not appear to accelerate cell maturation as a precursor morphology is retained. Finally, TNF alpha inhibits the relatively weak growth-promoting effect of granulocyte-CSF (G-CSF), which acts on a more committed subpopulation of CD34+ HPC different from that recruited by IL-3 and GM-CSF. TNF beta displays the same modulatory effects as TNF alpha. Thus, TNFs appear to enhance the early stages of myelopoiesis.\r"

Subcutaneous administration of 33 micrograms/kg/d of rhIL-3 for 11 to 14 days to rhesus monkeys slightly raised leukocyte counts (twofold) and substantially expanded the pool of circulating stem cells in the second week of treatment. At the end of rhIL-3 administration, PB levels of granulocyte/macrophage colony-forming units (CFU-GM) increased by a mean of 12-fold; burst-forming units-erythroid (BFU-E) by ninefold; CFU-mix, by 12-fold; and CFU-megakaryocyte (Mk), by 13-fold as compared with their respective pretreatment values. Subsequent administration of recombinant human granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor (rhGM-CSF; 5.5 micrograms/kg/d for 5 days) to rhIL-3-pretreated animals further expanded the PB stem cell compartment leading to maximum levels of CFU-GM that were in average much more increased (63-fold) than CFU-GM levels under rhIL-3 (14-fold) or rhGM-CSF (12-fold) alone. This hitherto unknown effect of rhIL-3 on the pool of circulating progenitors, particularly in synergy with rhGM-CSF, may facilitate harvest of hematopoietic progenitor cells from PB for stem cell transplantation.\r"

  ".W": "Marrow stromal cells are thought to regulate hematopoiesis by producing colony-stimulating factors (CSFs) and other cytokines, either constitutively or in response to mediators such as interleukin-1 alpha (IL-1 alpha) or tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF alpha). The mechanisms by which these inflammatory cytokines induce CSF expression in stromal cells are not fully defined. In this study, we used human marrow stromal cells transformed by simian virus 40 (SV-MSCs) to study growth factor and cytokine gene regulation in response to IL-1 alpha and TNF alpha. IL-1 alpha induced significant and prolonged increases in steady-state mRNA levels for interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta), granulocyte-macrophage CSF (GM-CSF), and, to a lesser extent, granulocyte-CSF (G-CSF); this induction was not dependent on new protein synthesis. Nuclear run-on analyses showed that IL-1 alpha transcriptionally activated the genes for IL-6, GM-CSF, and IL-1 beta, while TNF alpha transcriptionally induced expression of IL-6 and IL-1 beta. Furthermore, mRNA for IL-6 and IL-1 beta was dramatically superinduced by the combination of cycloheximide and TNF alpha. When SV-MSCs were cultured in semisolid medium, they formed colonies of blast-like cells that, when replated on plastic, resumed adherent growth. These \"colony-derived\" cell lines, unlike the parental SV-MSCs from which they were derived, constitutively expressed colony-stimulating activity and mRNA for GM-CSF, G-CSF, IL-6, and IL-1 beta. In this report, we show that the expression of IL-6 and IL-1 beta mRNA in the colony-derived cell lines was due, at least in part, to constitutive transcriptional activation of these genes (similar to the findings in IL-1 alpha- and/or TNF alpha-stimulated parental SV-MSCs). However, in contrast to the transcriptional activation of the GM-CSF gene seen in cytokine-induced parental SV-MSCs, GM-CSF transcripts accumulated in the colony-derived cell lines by a posttranscriptional mechanism.\r"

One mechanism endothelial cells use to maintain a nonthrombogenic surface is to polarize basement membrane constituents to the basolateral cell surface. In the present study, we began characterization of the mechanisms used by endothelial cells in the assembly of a subcellular fibronectin matrix. Immunofluorescence microscopy was used to localize extracellular matrix fibronectin in endothelial cell cultures. In contrast to preconfluent and newly confluent cultures, post-confluent cultures assembled a fibronectin matrix that was restricted to the basolateral cell surface. To determine if endothelial cells polarize fibronectin secretion, Millicell culture inserts were used to distinguish proteins secreted from apical and basal surfaces. Preconfluent and newly confluent cultures secreted fibronectin equally into apical and basal media. In contrast, post-confluent endothelial cells secreted fibronectin preferentially into the basal chamber. The degree to which fibronectin secretion was polarized varied with time in culture and with the ability of the monolayers to act as a barrier to the movement of 125I-fibronectin from the apical to basal chamber. In addition, high affinity binding sites for exogenous 125I-fibronectin were found to be present on the basolateral, but not apical, surface of post-confluent endothelial monolayers. These results indicate that subendothelial matrix assembly correlates with polarized fibronectin secretion, culture confluence, and expression of high affinity binding sites for fibronectin on the basolateral cell surface.\r"

  ".W": "Activation of human normal serum with tetanus/antitetanus immune complexes (TAT-IC) resulted in increased binding of 125I-labeled interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta) to serum factors, as opposed to untreated serum. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) followed by autoradiography showed labeling of two large molecular mass factors of an apparent molecular weight (Mr) of 200,000 and 400,000, respectively. These complexes could be dissociated by reduction. No complexes were formed when reducing compounds were added to serum-TAT-IC-125I-IL-1 beta mixtures. Complex formation was largely prevented by alkylating compounds. Molecular sieve chromatography of TAT-IC-activated serum confirmed that 125I-IL-1 beta became bound to high Mr serum proteins. Fractions containing high molecular 125I-IL-1 serum protein complexes partially retained IL-1-like activity since they induced proliferation of an IL-1-dependent murine T helper (D10G4) cell lineage. The 125I-IL-1 beta binding factors could be immunoprecipitated from TAT-IC-activated serum 125I-IL-1 beta solutions by antisera to alpha 2-macroglobulin (alpha 2M) or to the third complement component (C3). SDS-PAGE of the immunoprecipitates showed radioactive bands corresponding to the expected Mr resulting from complex formation between 125I-IL-1 beta and these two proteins. Treatment of purified plasma alpha 2M and C3 with trypsin or activation with methylamine, which causes cleavage of the internal thiol ester and the appearance of free thiol groups in these proteins, mediated binding of 125I-IL-1 beta to alpha 2M and C3b. The results suggest that cleavage of the internal thiol ester in C3 and alpha 2M makes these plasma proteins susceptible to binding of 125I-IL-1 beta and that free thiol groups do play a role in the formation of 125I-IL-1 beta plasma protein complexes. Activated C3 and alpha 2M may function as IL-1 beta carrier proteins in biologic fluids, in addition to their other physiologic roles.\r"

U937 P+ cells respond to PMA as a differentiation stimulus more effectively than do U937 cells, with a fourfold increase in the number of differentiated macrophages (P less than .001) and a faster rate of differentiation (a fourfold increase at t = 12 hours, P less than .001). U937 P+ cells also show a 7.4-fold increase in response to suboptimal doses of PMA (P less than .001). These findings suggest that mECEF expression correlates with responsiveness to a differentiation stimulus in a histiocytic lymphoma cell line that is widely used as a model of monocyte maturation.\r"

Because of the preventable threat to life, well-being and productivity from perturbations of plasma lipoproteins (which affect about 60% of adults), we recommend a population-based strategy with public education on diet, exercise and the hazards of smoking and legislation for better food labelling. This should be combined with the medical guidelines we describe to detect and treat those at highest risk for CHD (including about 15% of adults), who merit priority for the medical, dietetic and laboratory services required. Among people aged 40 years or more this includes those with plasma total cholesterol levels greater than 7 mmol/L, fasting triglyceride levels greater than 3 mmol/L or cholesterol level greater than 6 mmol/L when associated with CHD or other risk factors for CHD. For younger people the criteria for highest risk include cholesterol levels greater than 6.5 mmol/L for those aged 30 to 39 years, greater than 6 mmol/L for those aged 20 to 29 and greater than 5 mmol/L for those under age 20.\r"

At the time of the second biopsy, 23 patients showed clinical remission defined as complete disappearance of proteinuria and hematuria with normal renal function while 38 had persistent urinary abnormalities with normal renal function at the second biopsy. There were no differences between the two groups with regard to initial clinical findings and pathologic findings of the initial renal biopsy. The second biopsy of patients with clinical remission showed improvement of the glomerular changes on light microscopy, disappearance or diminution of IgA deposits in the mesangium and decrease of electron-dense deposits, whereas the second biopsy of patients with persistent urinary abnormalities showed progression of glomerular changes on light microscopy, persistence of mesangial IgA deposits and persistence of electron-dense deposits. Our study results show the importance of repeat renal biopsy in children with IgA nephropathy with persistent urinary abnormalities, as a progression of glomerular changes is common in these patients. These observations suggest that the deposition of IgA in the mesangium may be responsible for the glomerular damage in children with IgA nephropathy.\r"

Mean 24-hour concentrations of plasma total and essential amino acid were higher following the AA dialysate (total pre: 2893 +/- 185; total post: 3357 +/- 244; p less than 0.05; essential pre: 751 +/- 47; essential post: 1064 +/- 57 mumol/l; p less than 0.001). Mean 24-hour concentrations of the branched chain amino acids leucine, isoleucine and valine were higher following the AA dialysate (valine pre: 201 +/- 18; valine post: 321 +/- 19; p less than 0.001; leucine pre: 102 +/- 6; leucine post: 127 +/- 9; p less than 0.01; isoleucine pre: 67 +/- 5; isoleucine post: 85 +/- 7 mumol/l; p less than 0.05).

Plasma bicarbonate decreased with use of the amino acid solution (pre: 21 +/- 1; 2 weeks, 18 +/- 1; 4 weeks, 18 +/- 1; 6 weeks, 16 +/- 1; 8 weeks, 16 +/- 1 mmol/l). Use of a 1% amino acid solution over an 8-week period in CAPD patients improves the plasma amino acid profile but results in a metabolic acidosis.

Therefore, the use of zidovudine for that indication should await the results of controlled trials.

Any one alone may not be able to keep a patient dry. The pressures generated during a cough may easily overcome the internal and external sphincters closing powers, and the normal supportive mechanism works in such a way as to increase closure during increases in abdominal pressure. Normal support, conversely, is not sufficient in and of itself to maintain continence, and must have sufficient resting sphincteric activity to be effective. When one element is abnormal, the other mechanisms may be able to compensate and maintain continence. It is because there are these several interdependent parts of the continence mechanism that no single urodynamic parameter is predictive of stress continence. Each different etiologic type of stress incontinence reflects the malfunction of an anatomic component of the sphincteric mechanism. Therefore, a knowledge of this mechanism's structure is fundamental to an understanding of this common clinical problem. Technologic advances in assessment of the lower urinary tract have made the separation of different types of stress incontinence possible. The further realization that each type requires different treatment has made the distinctions between these clinically important entities.\r"

  ".U": "90275877\r", 
  ".W": "Detrusor instability is a urodynamic diagnosis made when the detrusor is shown objectively to contract, spontaneously or on provocation, during the filling phase of a cystometrogram while the patient is attempting to inhibit micturition. It often is responsible for symptoms of urgency, frequency, nocturia, urge incontinence, and nocturnal enuresis, but is not synonymous with any of them. Furthermore, it may be responsible for urinary incontinence which appears to be simple stress incontinence, and should be excluded before an operation for genuine stress incontinence is undertaken. Patients with mixed incontinence should have their detrusor instability treated before an attempt at surgical correction of stress incontinence is made. A number of therapeutic options exist for the unstable bladder. The simplest is bladder drill. My own preference is to start patients on bladder drill in conjunction with oxybutynin chloride 5 mg orally three times daily, with the plan of weaning them off the medication if possible in 3-6 months. Propantheline bromide in dosages of 15-30 mg orally four times daily also appears to be effective. Imipramine, in dosages of 25-50 mg orally twice daily, or up to 75 or 100 mg orally at night also may be helpful, especially if the patient suffers from nocturia or nocturnal enuresis. The effects of imipramine appear to be additive to those of other drugs, and this makes it a useful adjunct in therapy. Emepronium bromide and flavoxate hydrochloride appear to be less useful pharmacologic agents. The expected addition within the next few years of terodiline hydrochloride to the drugs available in the United States is likely to improve significantly our ability to treat detrusor instability. The use of prostaglandin synthetase inhibitors in women with perimenstrual exacerbations of their symptoms may be useful on a case-by-case basis. Patients who do not experience improvement with behavioral intervention and pharmacologic treatment may be candidates for electric stimulation therapy or surgery. The efficacy of electric stimulation therapy is diminished in many cases by poor patient acceptance. The most effective surgical treatment for refractory detrusor instability appears to be augmentation cystoplasty, which should be attempted only by a trained reconstructive urologist, and which should be reserved for the most refractory and difficult cases.\r"

It is important for physicians and other health-care providers to assess the occurrence and impact of these behaviors, and to assess and treat the broader medical and cognitive problems that are evident. Measurement tools can augment the clinical interview to give the practitioner a thorough assessment of behavioral problems. A systematic six-step approach to intervention, as well as specific recommendations for the most common and troublesome behaviors of depression and agitation, are provided. Care givers vary in their ability to cope with the problems of AD patients. Some seem to adjust naturally and to anticipate and solve problems on their own. Others need considerable guidance and may require assistance from their physician as well as referral to a psychologist or other mental health professional adept in behavioral management. Physicians must play a pivotal role in recognizing problems and providing or arranging for appropriate treatment for their AD patients and care givers.\r"

  ".W": "The precise diagnosis and duration of peptic ulcer disease can now be made endoscopically. Numerous effective medical therapies are available to treat these disorders. While the vast majority of patients respond to medical therapy with complete healing of ulcers within 4 to 6 weeks, a small percentage require longer and probably more intense treatment. A total assessment of the patient's lifestyle is important in order to achieve the best therapeutic response. Cigarette smoking is a potent negative factor for both healing and ulcer recurrence. The question of who should continue on maintenance therapy and for how long has not been answered. Certainly, the first-time ulcer patient who smokes and becomes asymptomatic on treatment requires nothing more than standard 4- to 6-week therapy and discontinuation of smoking. Patients with recurrent disease and those who have sustained complications such as bleeding or perforation probably warrant 6 to 12 months of maintenance therapy, with close follow-up thereafter. Some patients will require continuous maintenance therapy in order to remain asymptomatic. In such patients it is important to determine that the problem is, in fact, \"routine\" peptic ulcer disease. Ulcers associated with NSAIDs are unique in that their cause is known and, at present, their treatment is specific. Studies to date indicate that the only appropriate therapy to prevent NSAID ulcers is misoprostol, and that this drug is also effective in healing such ulcers while NSAID treatment is continued. Except for complications, few patients now need to be referred for surgical intervention. Those who are should receive the least destructive procedure possible. The efficacy of medical therapy is generally enhanced following selective and highly selective vagotomy. No patient should be referred electively to surgery without the Zollinger-Ellison syndrome being ruled out.\r"

With the use of manometry and ultrasound, anorectal physiology is evaluated and correlated with clinical dysfunction. A description of a previously undescribed ultrasound technique to evaluate anorectal angles and puborectalis function is presented. The results in 10 controls and 53 symptomatic patients with different degrees of continence dysfunction are discussed. The controls showed anal pressures and anorectal angles of 29 cm H2O and 114 degrees at rest and 67 cm H2O and 95 degrees with contraction. Six of the symptomatic patients had complete incontinence to solid stools. The results of their pressures and angles were 14 cm H2O and 151 degrees at rest and 32 cm H2O and 124 degrees with contraction. The values of this group compared with controls is significantly different (P less than 0.05). Ultrasound is helpful in assessing the pelvic floor, both subjectively and objectively. It has the advantages of avoiding radiation and allowing a longer viewing time. It is less expensive compared with radiographic proctography and the data are complementary. Ultrasound and manometry may be useful for long-term follow-up of anorectal physiology.\r"

Appropriate cultures are necessary to confirm the diagnosis in most cases. Most types of infectious enteritis are self-limiting, but some pathogens can cause serious disease, requiring accurate diagnosis and suitable antibiotic therapy. Appropriate precautions are mandatory to prevent the spread of infectious diarrhea from occurring in the hospital environment. Dietary restrictions and appropriate hygiene should be observed during travel to foreign countries to reduce the chance of acquiring infectious enteritis.\r"

  ".W": "Little information is available regarding the optimal timing of exercise in insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) patients. In this study, six IDDM patients receiving ultralente-based intensive insulin therapy were studied during 30 min of exercise (approximately 60% VO2max), before breakfast, and at 1600. On two other occasions, they were studied at rest. Plasma glucose increased from 6.7 +/- 0.4 to 9.1 +/- 0.4 mM during morning exercise (P less than 0.01). In contrast, mean plasma glucose did not change during afternoon exercise (delta = 0.3 +/- 0.5 mM, NS); however, there was a 0.3- to 1.0-mM decrease in three subjects. The observed difference in the glycemic response to exercise could not be explained on the basis of changes in plasma glucagon, growth hormone, norepinephrine, or epinephrine. Plasma cortisol was higher (P less than 0.02) in the morning than in the afternoon, and plasma free-insulin concentrations were lower (P less than 0.05). These data indicate that the risk of exercise-induced hypoglycemia is lowest before breakfast. The reason for the divergent glycemic responses to exercise is not entirely clear but may be related to the observed differences in free-insulin concentrations. Because of the lower risk of hypoglycemia, our results suggest prebreakfast exercise may be preferable for some IDDM patients receiving intensive insulin therapy. Whether these findings are relevant to patients receiving other types of insulin therapy will require further investigation.\r"

  ".W": "To test the hypothesis that nocturnal hypoglycemia causes postprandial hyperglycemia the next day (the Somogyi phenomenon) in patients with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM), we studied 10 moderately well controlled patients, who were on their usual therapeutic regimens, from 2000 to 2000 on three occasions. On a control day, samples were obtained without intervention. On another day, nocturnal hypoglycemia was prevented (by intravenous infusion of glucose, if necessary, from 2200 to 0400 to keep plasma glucose levels at greater than 5.6 mM). On another day, nocturnal hypoglycemia was induced (by stepped intravenous insulin infusions between 2200 and 0200 to reduce plasma glucose levels to less than 2.8 mM). After nocturnal hypoglycemia (1.9 +/- 0.2 mM), fasting (0800), morning (0800-1100), afternoon (1200-1500), evening (1600-2000), and entire-day (0800-2000) plasma glucose concentrations were no higher than those after prevention of nocturnal hypoglycemia or sampling only. On the control day, fasting and daytime plasma glucose levels were directly related to the preceding 2200 (r = 0.723, P less than 0.02, and r = 0.762, P = 0.01, respectively) and nocturnal nadir (r = 0.714, P less than 0.02, and r = 0.728, P less than 0.02) plasma glucose concentrations. Daytime plasma glucose levels were unrelated to peak nocturnal plasma glucagon, epinephrine, norepinephrine, growth hormone, or cortisol concentrations. We conclude that nocturnal hypoglycemia does not appear to cause clinically important daytime hyperglycemia in patients representative of most patients with IDDM.\r"

  ".W": "Coronary heart disease is the leading cause of death among patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM). NIDDM patients have a high frequency of dyslipidemia, which along with obesity, hypertension, and hyperglycemia may contribute significantly to accelerated coronary atherosclerosis. Because risk factors for coronary heart disease are additive and perhaps multiplicative, even mild degrees of dyslipidemia may enhance coronary heart disease risk. Therefore, therapeutic strategies for management of NIDDM should give equal emphasis to controlling hyperglycemia and dyslipidemia. The National Cholesterol Education Program recently issued guidelines for treatment of hyperlipidemia in adults including diabetic patients. Because of the unique features of diabetic dyslipidemia, however, we suggest that certain modifications in these guidelines be made to meet specific needs of diabetic patients. For example, therapeutic goals for serum cholesterol reduction should be lower in diabetic patients than in nondiabetic subjects. Particular emphasis should be given to weight reduction in NIDDM patients. In some diabetic patients, monounsaturated fatty acids may be a better replacement for saturated fatty acids than carbohydrates. The target for cholesterol lowering should include both very-low-density lipoprotein and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) (non-high-density lipoprotein) rather than LDL alone. To obtain a substantial reduction of cholesterol levels, drug therapy may be required in many patients. However, first-line drugs for nondiabetic patients (nicotinic acid and bile acid sequestrants) may be less desirable in NIDDM patients than hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG CoA) reductase inhibitors and even fibric acids. In fact, HMG CoA reductase inhibitors may be the drugs of choice for NIDDM patients with elevated LDL cholesterol and borderline hypertriglyceridemia, whereas gemfibrozil appears preferable for NIDDM patients with severe hypertriglyceridemia.\r"

We initiated a descriptive study of ICA+ subjects and their family members in which reactions to study participation, anxiety, and coping responses are monitored. Described here are preliminary results from 18 ICA+ youngsters, 6 ICA+ adults, and their family members. ICA+ identification resulted in clinically significant anxiety that dissipated to normal levels over time for all participants. Both ICA+ subjects and family members coped with the news in similar ways, relying primarily on problem-focused and social-support coping strategies. Few blamed themselves for their own or their loved one's ICA+ status. There was some evidence that the ICA+ participants may minimize the potential impact of their at-risk status. Compared with family members, ICA+ subjects used more avoidance coping strategies, and few believed they would ever develop diabetes. In contrast, many family members believed their loved one would ultimately develop diabetes. Although the initial findings support the resiliency of this population, the long-term effects of ICA screening remain to be seen.\r"

  ".W": "The influence of bicycle exercise (60% of W170 [working capacity at a pulse rate of 170 beats/min]; 40 min) on the absorption of 125I-labeled fast-acting insulin (10 U; Actrapid human insulin) after intramuscular compared with subcutaneous injection in the thigh was studied on 2 consecutive days in 10 insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) patients. Insulin absorption was measured as disappearance of radioactivity (1st-order elimination rate constants) by continuous external monitoring and as appearance of plasma free immunoreactive insulin (IRI). Subcutaneous adipose tissue blood flow (ATBF) and skeletal muscle blood flow (MF) were measured concomitantly in the contralateral thigh with the 133Xe wash-out technique. Plasma glucose was determined intermittently. The rate constant for 125I-insulin increased during exercise from 0.46 +/- 0.08 to 1.17 +/- 0.14%/min after intramuscular injection (P less than 0.001) and from 0.31 +/- 0.05 to 0.45 +/- 0.09%/min (NS) after subcutaneous injection. The rate constant of 125I-insulin from muscle remained elevated during the 80-min recovery period. The peak plasma free-IRI value was 39 mU/L higher, the area under the IRI curve was approximately 80% greater, and the decrease in plasma glucose was approximately 2 mM greater after intramuscular injection. Whereas MF increased fivefold, ATBF did not rise significantly during exercise. The results demonstrate that intramuscular compared with subcutaneous thigh injection of insulin followed by bicycle exercise induces a marked increase in insulin absorption and a substantial fall in plasma glucose.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Oral and intravenous glucose tolerance tests were performed in these 3 women and compared with 6 women with previous gestational diabetes without ICAs and 5 control women. Glucose tolerance was impaired only in the 3 women with ICAs, who also had an increase (P less than 0.03) in fasting plasma glucose and a decrease (P less than 0.03) in early first-phase insulin response. We conclude that the more specific MoAb method indicates a lower incidence of ICA in women with a history of gestational diabetes than previously reported and that a decreased first-phase insulin response is associated with the presence of ICAs, suggesting progressive islet cell damage.\r"

The peak counterregulatory hormone response was determined at the glucose nadir identified by continuous glucose monitoring. Eight patients with IGT who had symptoms and signs typical of hypoglycemia at the glucose nadir were compared with completely asymptomatic subjects (5 IGT patients and 13 patients who had normal glucose tolerance [NGT]). The mean glucose nadir of symptomatic IGT patients was 3.50 +/- 0.46 mM, which was not statistically different from the mean of asymptomatic NGT patients (4.10 +/- 0.56 mM) but was significantly lower than that for asymptomatic IGT patients (5.10 +/- 0.81 mM, P less than 0.001). Seven of 8 symptomatic IGT patients had glucose levels that never fell below the range of glucose nadirs for asymptomatic NGT patients. However, the symptomatic IGT group had significantly higher levels of growth hormone, cortisol, epinephrine, and norepinephrine than the asymptomatic groups in response to the nadir. We conclude that patients with IGT are capable of experiencing signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia at physiological glucose levels during OGTT with reflex stimulation of counterregulatory hormone release. This may indicate that symptomatic IGT patients have a higher glucose threshold for eliciting characteristic hypoglycemic symptom episodes than individuals with NGT.\r"

Thus, severely diminished beta-cell function in FCPD is partially reversible after treatment. This could contribute to the clinical metabolic peculiarities of this group of patients.\r"

  ".W": "Insulin secretory physiology has been characterized in tumor cell lines derived by primary culture of insulinomas that developed in transgenic mice expressing the large T-antigen of SV40 in pancreatic islet beta-cells. Cells in one of these lines, beta TC-3, contain large amounts of insulin (3100 +/- 294 ng/100 micrograms cellular protein). Constitutive release of insulin over 2 h in static incubation was low at 31.9 ng/100 micrograms protein and was increased 2-fold by glucose (16.7 mM) and 8-fold by depolarizing concentrations of potassium (45 mM). Isobutylmethylxanthine (IBMX; 0.5 mM) and forskolin (5 and 50 microM), which elevated cellular levels of cAMP, were ineffective as secretagogues, but dramatically potentiated glucose and potassium effects on insulin release (6.5- and 4-fold, respectively). A variety of other known insulin secretagogues stimulated insulin release in a manner analogous to their effects in normal islets. The sulfonylurea glipizide (1 microM) and the tumor-promoting phorbol ester 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (1 microM) stimulated insulin release 3.4- and 13.7-fold, respectively. The cholinergic agonist carbachol (2 microM) was ineffective alone, but potentiated glucose-induced insulin release 2.8-fold. Comparable stimulation of insulin release by glucose (16.7 mM) and glucose (16.7 mM) plus IBMX (0.5 mM) was noted with several other beta TC lines, which were derived independently from separate transgenic mice. Glucose- and glucose- plus IBMX (0.5 mM)-induced insulin release occurred progressively from 0.15-16.7 mM, indicating that insulin release from beta TC-3 cells occurred at much lower levels than that from normal islets. However, as in the normal islet, the glucose concentration dependency for insulin release was highly correlated (r = 0.93) with the glucose concentration dependency for glucose utilization (measured by 3H2O formation from [5-3H]glucose). This suggests that glucose induces insulin release from beta TC-3 cells by a mechanism similar to that in the normal islet. The high insulin content, the multifold stimulation of insulin release by a variety of secretagogues, their convenient propagation in culture, and the renewable source of these cell lines make the beta TC cells a convenient model for studies of beta-cell function.\r"

  ".W": "Endocrine regulation of tissue glucose-6-phosphatase activity in utero was examined by measuring enzyme levels in liver and kidneys of fetal sheep during the second half of gestation and after experimental manipulation of fetal plasma cortisol and insulin levels. Tissue glucose-6-phosphatase activities increased toward term in parallel with the rise in fetal plasma cortisol. At birth, the activities were significantly higher than in utero, but significantly less than in adult nonpregnant sheep. Fetal hypophysectomy lowered fetal plasma cortisol and reduced hepatic and renal glucose-6-phosphatase activities compared with those in intact fetuses near term. Conversely, intrafetal cortisol infusion raised fetal plasma cortisol and significantly increased tissue glucose-6-phosphatase activity to values similar to those in older fetuses. When the data from these groups of fetuses and the newborn lambs were combined, there was a significant positive correlation between the plasma cortisol level and the glucose-6-phosphatase activity in both liver and kidney. Fetal hypoinsulinemia was induced by fasting the ewe for 48 h and by fetal pancreatectomy. Fetal hepatic and renal glucose-6-phosphatase activities were higher in fasted than in fed animals, while pancreatectomy had little apparent effect on enzyme activity in either tissue. However, when differences in plasma cortisol were taken into account, hepatic, but not renal, glucose-6-phosphatase activities were higher in both groups of hypoinsulinemic fetuses than would have been observed in normoinsulinemic animals with a similar plasma cortisol level. Partial correlation analysis of the data showed that plasma insulin and cortisol were both significant influences on hepatic glucose-6-phosphatase activity in utero, but plasma cortisol had the more pronounced effect. Cortisol, therefore, appears to be a physiological regulator of tissue glucose-6-phosphatase activity in utero and enhances the glucogenic capacity of the sheep fetus during late gestation.\r"

In diabetic pigs, IGF-I messenger RNAs (mRNA) were decreased by 50% in muscle and liver tissues, and by 70% in heart. The imposition of fasting on diabetic animals tended to further decrease IGF-I mRNA levels, and fasting alone also decreased IGF-I mRNA abundance in the three tissues (P less than 0.05). Insulin therapy restored IGF-I mRNA levels to normal in muscle and livers but was less effective in hearts of diabetic pigs. Relative IGF-I mRNA expression in heart and muscle tissues was 2-fold and 4-fold higher, respectively, than in liver tissues under normal conditions in these animals. Serum IGF-I concentrations and tissue extractable immunoreactive IGF-I levels were also measured. Serum IGF-I was markedly decreased in the diabetic state, dropping to 70% below control levels (P less than 0.01). Extractable IGF-I in liver declined by 50% with diabetes (P less than 0.01), and by 30% in muscle with diabetes and fasting (P less than 0.05), but no significant changes in heart levels of IGF-I protein were detected. Expression levels of IGF-II mRNAs in the three tissues were unaffected by diabetes or fasting. These results are consistent with earlier observations in rat liver and further demonstrate that IGF-I expression in muscle and heart is altered by diabetes and fasting, whereas IGF-II mRNAs do not change.\r"

  ".W": "Previously we have shown that in normal murine mammary glands progesterone receptor (PgR) levels are modulated as a function of development and differentiation such that lactating mammary glands do not contain detectable levels of PgR as measured by steroid binding. The objective of the present study was to determine whether the lack of steroid binding in lactating mammary glands was due to the absence of receptor protein and if so whether it was accompanied by an alternation in the pattern of PgR gene expression. Accordingly, we have performed an immunological analysis of murine mammary PgR isolated from different developmental states and have also examined these tissues for PgR gene expression. In mammary tissues from all developmental states other than lactation, immunoreactive PgR corresponding to both A and B forms of the protein were detected. Analysis for PgR mRNA revealed multiple species in mammary tissues and the relative order of abundance of the various transcripts and their sizes were approximately 6.9 greater than 8.7 greater than 3.5 greater than 2.7 greater than 4.2. The 6.9 and 8.7 kilobase transcripts accounted for between 70-80% of total mRNA. All five species of mRNA were detected in tissues from nulliparous mice which decreased dramatically during pregnancy, became undetectable during lactation, and were once again detectable in tissues from mice undergoing lactational involution. Experiments designed specifically to examine the effect of estradiol on mammary PgR mRNA revealed that in contrast to tissues from other developmental states, lactating mammary glands were unable to respond to estradiol with an increase in PgR mRNA. Based on these findings and the fact that estrogenic insensitivity of lactating mammary glands coexists with the presence of ER we propose that in this tissue there is an alteration in the estrogen dependent transcriptional regulation of PgR gene expression.\r"

This protein was related to type 1 plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI-1) on the basis of molecular mass, activity in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate, immunoprecipitation by antibodies to PAI-1, and N-terminal sequence analysis. PAI-1 levels in the conditioned medium of NRK cells were increased 5- to 11-fold when cells were incubated with picomolar concentrations of TGF beta 1 for 24 h, reaching a concentration of approximately 0.3 microgram/ml. The secreted PAI-1 was deposited in the NRK extracellular matrix as well as released into the culture medium. A spontaneously transformed NRK cell line was found to secrete 3-4 times less PAI-1, in the absence or presence of TGF beta 1, compared to the parent cell line, while PAI-1 secretion in Kirsten sarcoma virus-transformed NRK cells was almost completely abrogated. A novel purification procedure was established, which results in the isolation of highly active and detergent-free TGF beta 1-induced PAI-1.\r"

To investigate the influence of D3 on liver regeneration, the effect of the D status was studied in D-depleted rats (D-) pretreated with: G1, placebo (D-, hypocalcemic); G2, oral calcium only (D-, normocalcemic); G3, D3; and G4, 1,25-(OH)2D3. Two thirds hepatectomy (HX) or sham operation was performed, and regeneration was studied for 3 weeks. I response to glucose challenge and the hepatic I receptor were also studied. Cell volume, DNA, and RNA were not affected by pretreatment. After HX, the pattern of [3H]thymidine incorporation into DNA (P less than 0.003) and the cell labeling index (P less than 0.0001) were highly influenced by pretreatment and suggestive of an earlier appearance of the S phase of the cell cycle in the 1,25-(OH)2D3-treated compared to the D- hypocalcemic group. Furthermore, the mitotic index revealed a significant effect of pretreatment (P less than 0.01), with peak mitosis 24 h after HX in D3-treated and 1,25-(OH)2D3-treated rats compared to 30-36 h after HX in the D- groups. Liver weight restitution was impaired in D- rats (P less than 0.009) and is illustrated by the estimated time required to achieve 70% recovery of the resected liver mass, which was found to be 186 and 300 h in G1 and G2, and 154 and 107 h in G3 and G4. G1 rats had significantly higher glucose concentrations (fasting as well as after glucose injection) and reduced I secretion when challenged with glucose (P less than 0.001); they also had an upregulation in hepatic I receptor number (P less than 0.005) compared to calcium or D3-treated rats, while 1,25-(OH)2D3 led to a liver I receptor number similar to that found in hypocalcemic D- rats; the affinity of the I receptor was, however, only slightly changed by pretreatment (P less than 0.08). Our data indicate that in D depletion, hypocalcemia retards DNA synthesis and liver mass recovery, while normocalcemia contributes to DNA synthesis, but fails to sustain mitosis and compensatory liver growth to a level comparable to that found after D3 and/or 1,25-(OH)2D3 repletion. The observation that both D3 and 1,25-(OH)2D3 significantly promoted normal liver recovery after partial HX illustrates the role of the D endocrine system in normal cell physiology in vivo.\r"

IGF-I stimulates proliferation of IEC-6 cells at a lower concentration (ED50 = 1.6 nM) than either insulin or IGF-II. To gain insight into the mechanisms by which IGFs stimulate IEC-6 cell growth, we have examined the characteristics of specific IGF receptors on IEC-6 cells. Binding of 125I-IGF-I and 125I-IGF-II to IEC-6 monolayers was analyzed by incubation with various concentrations (0.2 nM to 0.5 microM) of radiolabeled IGFs for 16 h at 3 C. Scatchard plots of 125I-IGF-I binding were linear, suggesting a single class of binding sites with KD = 3.1 +/- 0.35 nM and Bmax = 50.7 +/- 6 fmol/10(6) cells. IGF-II was potent in displacing 125I-IGF-I (KI = 8.1 +/- 0.85 nM), but insulin had little effect. Affinity cross-linking with 125I-IGF-I followed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis revealed three bands with Mr of 270,000, 245,000, and 133,000, and the major band was the 133,000 species. Labeling of the 133,000 and 270,000 bands was greater than or equal to 80% inhibited by 10(-7) M unlabeled IGF-I, less potently inhibited by IGF-II and not at all by insulin. These results suggest that the 133,000 band represents the alpha-subunit of the type I IGF receptor. Scatchard plots of 125I-IGF-II binding to IEC-6 cell monolayers were curvilinear, suggesting two classes of binding sites: high affinity, low capacity sites, KD = 0.87 +/- 0.08 nM and Bmax = 28 +/- 2.5 fmol/10(6) cells; low affinity, high capacity sites, KD = 60 = +/- 8.8 nM and Bmax = 1780 +/- 230 fmol/10(6) cells. Neither IGF-I nor insulin was effective in inhibiting 125I-IGF-II binding. Affinity cross-linking with 125I-IGF-II labeled predominantly a 245,000 band, suggesting that this species is the type II receptor. A band with Mr 131,000 was barely detectable with 125I-insulin. These results indicate that IEC-6 cells have abundant quantities of the type I and II IGF receptors and few insulin receptors, suggesting that the mitogenic effect of IGFs is mediated through the type I IGF receptor.\r"

To further characterize the beta-[125I]endorphin-binding site mediating these effects and its response to cations and GTP, the human monocyte-like cell line U937 was used. Incubation of intact cells and beta-[125I]endorphin for 60 min at 4 C demonstrated a saturable, high affinity binding site [Kd = 1.2 +/- 0.5 X 10(-8) M (mean +/- SE; n = 4] competed by equimolar beta-endorphin and N-acetyl (Ac)-beta-endorphin but not by naloxone, morphine, or selective opiate receptor agonists. Competition studies showed that beta-endorphin-(6-31) and beta-endorphin-(28-31) were approximately 5- and 100-fold less potent, respectively, whereas beta-endorphin-(1-16) or -(1-27) was ineffective. Covalent cross-linking of beta-[125I]endorphin to intact cells and resolution by gel electrophoresis showed dominant bands at 59K and 44K and a minor band at 66K. The bands at 44K and 66K were completely displaced by increasing equivalent concentrations of beta-endorphin and N-Ac-beta-endorphin. Increasing concentrations of mono (Na+, K+)- and divalent (Ca2+, Mg2+, Mn2+) cations reduced the binding of beta-[125I]endorphin to U937 membrane; beta-[125I]endorphin binding to rat brain membrane showed similar cation sensitivity. GTP gamma-sulfate (GTP gamma S; 10(-4) M) alone reduced binding to U937 membrane by 25%. In the presence of Na+ (100 or 150 mM) or Mg2+ (10 mM), GTP gamma S reduced binding by an additional 50%. Moreover, GTP gamma S (10(-8)-10(-4) M) in the presence of Na+ (100 mM) reduced binding in a dose-dependent manner, whereas GMP was ineffective. In conclusion, beta-endorphin binds to sites on human U937 cells similar to those observed on normal murine splenocytes. Although naloxone insensitive, these sites exhibit properties, such as size, salt sensitivity, and coupling to a GTP-binding protein, that are similar to those observed for agonist binding to brain opiate receptors.\r"

  ".W": "To elucidate further the manner in which gonadal steroids influence the secretion of LH, we examined the effects of gonadectomy and the absence of functional androgen receptors on GnRH-induced LH release from dispersed rat anterior pituitary cells. Intact and gonadectomized (GNX) normal rats and androgen-resistant, testicular feminized (Tfm) animals from the King x Holtzman strain (a mutant strain that possesses defective androgen receptors) were used. Dispersed pituitary cells were perifused with Medium 199 during a 4-h equilibration period and then subjected to eight 2.5-min pulses of GnRH introduced at 30-min intervals at concentrations ranging from 0.03-100 nM. Basal LH secretion by cells from intact male and female rats was indistinguishable (P = 0.79) and was substantially lower (P less than 0.0001) than that by cells from GNX male and female animals. Basal LH secretion by cells from Tfm rats was significantly higher (P less than 0.01) than that by cells from intact animals, but lower (P less than 0.005) than that by cells from GNX animals. In response to GnRH, perifused pituitary cells from animals representing all experimental groups demonstrated concentration-dependent LH release. Pituitary cells from intact female rats showed an overall greater (P less than 0.05) response to GnRH than cells from intact male rats. Pituitary cells from Tfm rats demonstrated a greater GnRH-stimulated LH mean response than cells from intact male (P less than 0.0001) or intact female (P less than 0.0001) rats. Gonadectomy of male rats resulted in an overall GnRH-stimulated LH release similar to that exhibited by cells from gonadectomized female rats (P = 0.61). Cells from Tfm animals released more LH in response to GnRH than those from gonadectomized male and female rats (P less than 0.001). These data demonstrate that the release of LH in response to GnRH by pituitary cells from intact male rats (i.e. in the presence of androgen and functional androgen receptors) is less than that seen by cells from intact females rats. Since circulating levels of testosterone and estradiol are known to be elevated in the testicular feminized rat, the heightened GnRH-stimulated LH release by cells from such animals may reflect either the long term lack of androgenic influence and/or the combined effects of androgen resistance and elevated levels of circulating estrogens.\r"

  ".W": "The immune system and the neuroendocrine system have been shown to be functionally interactive. The neuroendocrine system can modulate the immune response and immune mediators can influence the neuroendocrine system. The present paper focuses on the capacity of lymphocytes to produce and secrete neuroendocrine substances. Lymphocytes can secrete the neuropeptide beta-endorphin in response to activation with mitogen or antigen. Moreover, mediators that are involved in the adaptation to stress have also been shown to induce the release of immunoreactive-beta-endorphin by lymphocytes. It is shown here that stimulation of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells with the beta-adrenergic agonist isoprenaline induces beta-endorphin secretion. The effect of isoprenaline can be mimicked by elevation of the intracellular concentration of cAMP with forskolin or (Bu)2cAMP. Inhibition of cAMP-dependent protein kinase PKA by the antagonist N-[2-(methylamino)ethyl]-5-isoquinoline-sulfonamide abrogates isoprenaline-induced secretion of immunoreactive-beta-endorphin by peripheral blood mononuclear cells. The present data give evidence that, beta-adrenergic activation activation of lymphocytes stimulates the secretion of ir-beta-endorphin via a protein kinase A-dependent mechanism. Both beta-adrenergic agonists as well as beta-endorphin have been shown to modulate the immune response. The data presented here are indicative for a role of beta-endorphin in the modulation of the immune response after beta-adrenergic activation.\r"

  ".U": "90276347\r", 
  ".W": "Current evidence favors the hypothesis that granulosa cell-derived basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) may be the centerpiece of an intraovarian autocrine loop. In this report we examine the possibility that bFGF may also be involved in paracrine interactions at the level of the ovarian theca-interstitial cell. To this end, whole ovarian dispersates obtained from immature rats were cultured for 96 h under serum-free conditions. The accumulation of androsterone, the major androgenic steroid detected, increased 3- to 5-fold over baseline in response to treatment with hCG (1 ng/ml), an effect further optimized (2- to 4-fold) by supplementation with insulin-like growth factor-I (10 ng/ml), insulin (1 microgram/ml), terbutaline (10(-6) M), or high density lipoprotein (100 micrograms/ml). In the absence of these optimizing supplements, bFGF was without effect on basal androsterone accumulation, but produced a relatively modest (20%) inhibition of hCG hormonal action. In contrast, bFGF proved a highly potent inhibitor (80%) of hCG-stimulated androgen biosynthesis in supplement-enriched cultures. This reversible bFGF action proved to be time and dose dependent, with a minimal time requirement of 48 h and a median inhibitory dose of 2 ng/ml. Unaccounted for by altered (hCG-stimulated) cAMP generation or a diminution in the viable cell mass, the antigonadotropic effect of bFGF may by inference be assumed to involve a site(s) of action distal to or independent of cAMP generation. In this connection, cellular radiolabeling with [3H] pregnanolone (3 alpha-hydroxy-5 alpha-pregnane-20-one) revealed bFGF to be a potent inhibitor of the steroidogenic enzyme 17 alpha-hydroxylase/17-20-lyase. As such, these findings are in keeping with the possibility that locally derived bFGF may exert a dual inhibitory action on (mature) ovarian estrogen production by reducing androgen substrate provision as well as by exercising its now established ability to attenuate granulosa cell aromatase activity.\r"

  ".U": "90276350\r", 
  ".W": "Adult male rats were passively immunized against GnRH and given iv infusions of saline or 60 or 300 ng NIDDK ovine LH-24/100 g BW.24 h in continuous regimens of 2.5 or 12.5 ng/100 g BW.h and pulsatile regimens of 1-min pulses of 5 or 25 ng/100 g BW every 2 h. Control animals were treated with nonimmune serum and saline. After 10 days of in vivo treatment, Leydig cells were purified and incubated in vitro with 1) increasing concentrations of hCG (0-50 mIU/ml) in the presence or absence of methylisobutylxanthine, 2) a maximally stimulatory concentration of 8-bromo-cAMP (8-Br-cAMP; 1 mM), and 3) a saturating concentration of 25-hydroxycholesterol (10 microM). LH receptor concentrations were quantified by [125I]hCG binding assay. Maximum testosterone production in the presence of hCG, 8-Br-cAMP, or 25-hydroxycholesterol was reduced by more than 90% in Leydig cells from anti-GnRH serum-treated rats (compared to that in cells from control rats), and this reduction in steroidogenic capacity was prevented in a dose-dependent manner by concurrent infusion of LH in either the continuous or pulsatile regimens. These results confirm that the trophic actions of LH on Leydig cells in vivo 1) do not depend on pulsatile secretion of the hormone, and 2) include induction/maintenance of one or more of the enzymes catalyzing the conversion of cholesterol to testosterone. Trophic actions on constituents or processes before cholesterol side-chain cleavage were not apparent; in vivo treatments had no obvious differential effects on hCG-stimulated, 8-Br-cAMP-stimulated, or 25-hydroxycholesterol-supported testosterone production. Sensitivity to hCG was increased (EC50 for stimulation of testosterone production was decreased) by passive immunization against GnRH, and this effect was prevented in a dose-dependent manner by concurrent infusion of LH in either the continuous or pulsatile regimens. Thus, intermittent exposure to low concentrations of LH in vivo desensitizes Leydig cells as effectively as continuous exposure. Neither specific binding of [125I]hCG nor the effect of methylisobutylxanthine on sensitivity to hCG in vitro differed among treatment groups. Therefore, both the trophic and desensitizing actions of LH appear to occur by mechanisms that are independent of changes in available LH receptor concentration and phosphodiesterase activity.\r"

By Western ligand blotting, three molecular forms of IGFBP were identified in conditioned medium from control cultures with mol wt (Mr) of 34,000, 28,000, and 24,000. Concentrations of these three IGFBP forms increased with time in serum-free conditioned medium without benefit of hormonal supplementation. Insulin and IGF-I were potent stimuli for IGFBP production by bovine fibroblasts, whereas bovine GH, epidermal growth factor, or steroid treatment had little or no effect. Insulin and IGF-I enhanced the production of 24,000, 28,000, and 34,000 Mr IGFBPs in a dose-dependent fashion. Moreover, addition of low nanomolar concentrations of insulin or IGF-I to bovine fibroblast cultures specifically induced the secretion of a 42,000/38,000 Mr species of IGFBP, which corresponded in size to the IGF-binding subunit of the principal 150,000 Mr IGFBP complex in serum. After stimulation with insulin or IGF-I, bovine fibroblasts (3 X 10(5) cells) secreted approximately 30 ng/24 h 42,000/38,000 Mr IGFBP. Subunits of 42,000/38,000 Mr in bovine fibroblast-conditioned medium did not form macromolecular complexes in either the absence or presence of bovine GH.\r"

  ".U": "90276357\r", 
  ".W": "Galanin is a widely distributed regulatory peptide which modulates the pituitary secretion of PRL and GH. Estrogen administration strongly stimulates galanin gene expression in the rat anterior pituitary. In adult female Fischer 344 rats, estrogen also induces hyperplasia of lactotropes. We used immunocytochemical analysis to assess the effects of estrogen on galanin-like immunoreactivity (Gal-IR) in the rat pituitary and hypothalamus during sc diethylstilbestrol (DES) implantation and after its removal at 30 days. In the anterior pituitary, DES implantation increased the portion of Gal-IR-containing cells from less than 2% in the control rats to 18.3% after 3 days of DES and 36% after 30 days. These changes paralleled the lactotrope hyperplasia exhibited in response to DES exposure. Ten and 30 days after removal of the DES capsules, the percentage of Gal-IR-containing cells in the anterior pituitary decreased to 6.3% and 1.5%, respectively. Colocalization studies revealed that Gal-IR-containing cells were predominantly lactotropes. Immunoelectron microscopy demonstrated that Gal-IR was concentrated in the Golgi region of these hyperplastic lactotropes and suggests that little of the synthesized galanin is secreted. The distribution of Gal-IR in the hypothalamus, median eminence, and neurohypophysis was unaffected by DES treatment. These data demonstrate that galanin is synthesized by hyperplastic pituitary lactotropes of Fischer 344 rats and that peptide accumulation is dependent on the presence of circulating estrogens. In contrast, neuronal galanin synthesis in the hypothalamus does not appear to be regulated by estrogen.\r"

The solubilized receptors displayed high affinity, saturability, and specificity. The dissociation constant (Kd) for endothelin was 7 +/- 2 nM, and the number of binding sites was 600 +/- 200 fmol/mg protein. These results are similar to those obtained for the membrane-bound receptor and suggest that during solubilization the binding characteristics of the receptor are preserved. Attempts to purify the solubilized receptors in an active form using affinity chromatography techniques, i.e. Affi-gel 15 column coupled to endothelin, were not successful. Nevertheless, identification of the receptors was achieved by affinity chromatography of the solubilized proteins and subsequent iodination. Autoradiographic analysis of sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis revealed a major protein with an apparent mol wt of 50 kD. Taken together with our previous findings, this result suggests that the 50-kD band represents the endothelin receptor.\r"

  ".W": "The translated products of v-erbA-related cDNAs have been demonstrated to be thyroid hormone receptors, and three different forms of receptor (alpha 1, alpha 2, and beta) have been found in human tissues. We synthesized five peptides corresponding to different portions of these three receptors and raised site-specific polyclonal-antipeptide sera in rabbits. Each antibody displayed high titer and specificity for its respective antigen when tested in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Each immunoprecipitated the corresponding in vitro translated products of human c-erbA alpha 1, alpha 2, or beta. Two of the antisera were specific for beta, one for alpha 2, and one detected a sequence common to alpha 1 and alpha 2. The fifth was directed toward the DNA-binding area of the proteins and interacted with each receptor. The four antibodies against alpha 1 and beta immunoprecipitated the native thyroid hormone receptor from rat liver and caused a partial shift in the elution profile of the native receptor labeled with [125I]T3 on Sephacryl S-300 column chromatography. The antibody against alpha 2 protein did not interact with native thyroid hormone receptor from rat liver. Using the indirect immunofluorescence technique with the five antibodies, we detected immunoreactivity primarily in the nucleus of cells in several tissues. In general, there was coordinate expression of both alpha and beta receptors in each organ examined, in agreement with previous data on tissue distribution of mRNAs for human thyroid hormone receptors. These studies prove the identity of v-erbA-related gene products with native thyroid hormone receptors and the expression of both alpha and beta receptors in nuclei of human and rat tissues.\r"

Decapeptyl treatment provokes a significant decrease in E2 and particularly in E1 and E2 sulfates. Progesterone receptors were higher in the leiomyoma than in the myometrium; after a long treatment (3 to 4 months) a significant decrease in both tissues is observed.

  ".W": "IgG serum antibody was measured by ELISA in patients with Crohn's disease (15), ulcerative colitis (15), and in normal controls (15) to 12 strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae (baker's and brewer's yeast) and to the two major serotypes of the commensal yeast Candida albicans. Antibody to 11 of the 12 strains of S cerevisiae was raised in patients with Crohn's disease but not in patients with ulcerative colitis when compared with controls (p less than 0.001). The pattern of antibody response to these 11 strains was variable, however, suggesting the likelihood of antigenic heterogeneity within the species. Antibody to C albicans was not significantly different in patient and control groups. The specificity of this unusual antibody response in Crohn's disease for S cerevisiae suggests that it is not simply the result of a generalised increase in intestinal permeability. Furthermore, because brewing and baking strains detected the response, the relevant antigen(s) are presumably common in the diet. Hypersensitivity to dietary antigens may be involved in the pathogenesis of Crohn's disease, and the role of S cerevisiae requires further investigation.\r"

  ".W": "This study reviews recent experimental data from our own and other laboratories on the effects of hypertension on the arterial wall and the potential mechanisms by which hypertension can induce vascular injury and accelerate atherosclerosis. The findings suggest that the responses of the arterial media to hypertension reflect appropriate adaptations to increased intramural tension with resultant medial thickening secondary to an increase in both cellular mass and extracellular matrix. The role of growth factors in this process and their effects on arterial contractility are discussed as well as the potential importance of the changes in extracellular matrix constituents. The intimal changes induced by hypertension have many similarities to those caused by aging or hypercholesterolemia and can in part reflect general arterial responses to injury. They make the arterial wall more vulnerable to the effects of hypercholesterolemia, however, and as noted in our studies with the Watanabe heritable hyperlipidemic rabbit, pronounced acceleration of atherosclerosis is induced when hypertension is combined with hypercholesterolemia. Antihypertensive drugs can affect the arterial response to hypercholesterolemia. In the present study, new data are provided indicating that captopril inhibits aortic atherosclerosis in the Watanabe heritable hyperlipidemic rabbit in association with a pronounced reduction in cellularity of lesions.\r"

  ".W": "Physiological studies reported from our laboratory over the past several years have been reviewed and support epidemiological reports indicating that hypertensive cardiac and vascular disease runs a more severe course in the black patient. Although comparison of systemic hemodynamics failed to demonstrate that, for any level of arterial pressure, the magnitude of total peripheral resistance (which is the hemodynamic hallmark of hypertensive disease) differed between black patients and white patients, there are more subtle differences that were ascertained. Thus, although intravascular (plasma) volume contracts as arterial pressure and total peripheral resistance increase in both racial groups, this relation may differ quantitatively. At least in some black patients (43%), intravascular volume may be more expanded; in these patients, this relation is less closely correlated with the renopressor system (i.e., plasma renin activity). Moreover, these studies indicated that, at any level of arterial pressure, cardiac (left ventricular mass and posterior wall thickness) and renal hemodynamic involvement is more severe in the black patient. These findings point to important differences that operate in black patients and white patients with essential hypertension. With further study, these findings may be translated into more specific antihypertensive therapeutic implications for patients of both racial groups with essential hypertension.\r"
