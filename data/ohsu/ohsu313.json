Of 428 eyes (400 patients), 64 (15%) had corneal complications, 58 (13.6%) had epithelial defects, and 12 (2.8%) had corneal edema. Among 206 diabetic eyes, 41 (19.9%) had corneal complications. Of 222 nondiabetic eyes, only 23 (10.4%) showed complications. Multiple regression analysis of possible contributing factors was performed. Diabetes, intraoperative lensectomy, and history of vitreous surgery were related significantly to the occurrence of all corneal complications combined. Our series showed a significantly decreased complication rate when compared with a previous study. Improved preoperative surgical preparation and intraoperative technique to minimize corneal trauma may have accounted for the decrease.\r"

Eyes were grouped according to delta CT, and the groups were compared according to the percentage of cell loss. Eyes with delta CT of 0.1 mm or more at five days lost significantly more cells at one and six months than eyes with delta CT of less than 0.025 mm. Eyes were then regrouped according to the percentage of cell loss. Those with cell loss of 30% or more were found to have significantly greater delta CT at 48 hours and five days than eyes with cell loss of less than 30%. The derived probability of cell loss of 30% or more increases the greater the value of delta CT. For delta CT of 100 micron or more at five days, the probability of high cell loss is 30%; this is nearly three times the likelihood that high cell loss had occurred when delta CT is less than 100 micron. Our results suggest that delta CT could be a useful clinical indicator of endothelial cell loss.\r"

We have investigated the PERGs of a group of subjects with early glaucoma and ocular hypertension, comparing them with normal subjects, and have found a selective reduction in the second negative wave in patients with evidence of optic nerve dysfunction. The PERG may prove helpful in discriminating those patients with ocular hypertension who are destined to develop visual field loss unless medical or surgical therapy were to be employed.\r"

All patients had minimal clinical evidence of optic nerve damage when tested. A 2.3 cycle-per-degree sinusoidal grating of 55% contrast was phase reversed at either 1 or 4 Hz. The P1 latency of the 1-Hz data and the phase at 8 Hz, the second harmonic of the 4-Hz input frequency, were measured. In retrobulbar neuritis, latency (phase) was severely abnormal at both temporal frequencies. In thyroid eye disease, VEP phase was abnormal at 8 Hz while the P1 latency was normal at 1 Hz. The P1 latency and phase were normal in most cases of pseudotumor cerebri. The results suggest differing mechanisms for damage in compressive vs primary demyelinating neuropathies.\r"

The cortical adaptation of anomalous retinal correspondence prevents diplopia and visual confusion and obviates the need to close one eye in bright sunlight.\r"

Fluorescence microscopy demonstrated homogeneous autofluorescence in the retinal pigment epithelium that was similar in intensity to that of an age-matched control. The results of this clinicopathologic study suggest that in adult-onset foveomacular pigment epithelial dystrophy, an alteration of macular retinal pigment epithelium causes an accumulation of abnormal subretinal pigment epithelial material, photoreceptor degeneration, and serous retinal detachment.\r"

In respect to the laboratory measures the groups were identical at the beginning of the study and after 6 months' follow-up. Our results are encouraging and suggest that the assessment of heavy drinking should be a routine in the treatment of alcohol-related injuries and that education and counselling must be intensive to be effective.\r"

Rats were injected intraperitoneally with ethanol, 75 mmol/kg body wt; controls were injected with isovolumetric 0.15 M NaCl. After 140 min rates of protein synthesis were measured by injection of a large dose of L[4(3)H]phenylalanine and at 150 min rats were killed. (2) Fractional rates of protein synthesis in control animals were approximately four to five times greater in liver than muscle. Absolute rates were, however, comparable in liver and skeletal muscle. Ethanol reduced the fractional rate of liver protein synthesis by 5-20%; the response for muscle was relatively greater (25-30%). The decrease in the amount of protein synthesized by muscle was also greater than that by liver. (3) After 150 min, plasma gamma-glutamyl transferase, alanine aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, lactate dehydrogenase and creatine kinase activities were all decreased by 25-60%. Aspartate aminotransferase activity was increased by 42%, though this was not statistically significant. (4) Increased plasma glucose and triglycerides in ethanol-dosed rats indicated that limitations in substrate supply were not mediating factors in reducing protein synthesis. Ethanol was also able to exert its effects in the presence of elevated insulin levels. A direct effect of ethanol, or its metabolites, on protein synthesis, is therefore implied.\r"

The drinking profile is presented in five second-order factor scales: 'alcohol abuse', 'psychological benefits', 'interpersonal complications', 'social drinking' and 'daily drinking' and in 17 first-order factor scales. The reliability and specificity of the scales are satisfactory. Preliminary norms based on a sample of more than 600 alcoholic patients are available. Using the original American scoring and norms the results indicate important similarities in the alcoholism pattern between Sweden and the U.S.A.\r"

Eighty-three percent of cases were caused by underlying heart disease. Overall, 17% of patients with arrest caused by heart disease were admitted and 7% were discharged from the hospital. There was a wide variation in the percent discharged among the 15 paramedic service areas, ranging from 0% to 13%. Factors associated with successful resuscitation included witnessed collapse, rhythm of ventricular fibrillation, short interval from collapse to cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and delivery of advanced cardiac life support, collapse at public location, and bystander initiation of CPR. Improvements in survival are likely to result if CPR is more frequently and promptly initiated and the time to arrival of definitive paramedic care can be improved.\r"

Eighty-one patients were identified, including 29 pulseless and non-breathing and 52 noncardiopulmonary arrest children, who required intravenous fluids or medication for resuscitation. Comparing the results with a previous review, the IO method effectively reduced the time needed to establish vascular access in the arrested group when standard techniques failed, particularly in the child less than 2 years old. The IO method was not used effectively in the non-arrest group, as evidenced by a significantly greater mean time required to establish vascular access. There were no significant complications related to the IO procedure. Nine (50%) of the patients receiving IO fluids or medication had clinical and/or laboratory evidence that these substances reached the central circulation. Early use of IO infusion in the resuscitation is recommended for not only the arrested patient, but also the critical nonarrested patient requiring immediate vascular access.\r"

Respiratory compromise was defined as follows: partial pressure of oxygen less than 65 torr on initial hospital arterial blood gases, partial pressure of carbon dioxide greater than 45 torr on initial hospital arterial blood gases, or radiographic and clinical evidence of aspiration pneumonitis within 5 days of admission to the hospital. From a total of 116 patients transported from the scene of an accident during the period of this investigation, there were 42 patients with Trauma Scores between 4 and 14 whose records were studied in detail. Ten of these patients ha adequate perfusion and abnormal arterial blood gases after arrival at the receiving hospital. Five patients might have benefited from endotracheal intubation in the field, but there were no preventable deaths. Neurologic status of the patient appeared to be more useful than respiratory status in predicting respiratory compromise.\r"

Patients were divided, on the basis of clinical and radiographic information, into three groups: group A (11 patients), with clinically normal TF status; group B (12 patients), with elevated TF status; and group C (3 patients), with decreased TF status. The mean Z values measured in each group were: 26.5 ohms in group A, 21.8 ohms in group B, and 37.4 ohms in group C (differences significant at P less than .02). Using a cutoff Z value of 24.0 ohms would have predicted group B individuals with a sensitivity of 92% and a specificity of 79%. In eleven patients, impedance measurement would have added information that confirmed diagnostic suspicions or suggested the diagnosis earlier than would otherwise have occurred. In five patients, real-time changes in Z were potentially useful in guiding and monitoring the results of therapeutic interventions or changes in clinical condition. This study demonstrates that Z measurement and real-time monitoring can be a useful and noninvasive means of assessing TF status in ED patients. However, it may be most helpful in those patients whose TF status is changing or unstable.\r"

The ICV injection of 0.06 and 0.6 nmol of leumorphin caused a significant decrease in basal blood pressure (delta mean arterial pressure (MAP): -6.5 +/- 2.7 and -7.2 +/- 1.7 mm Hg, respectively). The ICV injection of AII (0.1 nmol) elicited a pressor response (delta MAP: 21.4 +/- 1.1 mm Hg). This pressor response was significantly reduced by the simultaneous administration of leumorphin, and furthermore, the blood pressure was lowered below the basal level. These depressor actions of leumorphin were partially antagonized by the preadministration of naloxone, an opiate antagonist. These results together with our previous works on the potent inhibitory actions of leumorphin on drinking and vasopressin secretion suggest the possible involvement of leumorphin in the central regulation of blood pressure and body fluid homeostasis.\r"

  ".W": "Vinpocetine is a highly specific inhibitor of calmodulin-dependent phosphodiesterase (CaM-PDE) with an IC50 of 19 microM and produces a significant accumulation of cyclic GMP but not cyclic AMP in rabbit aorta. In isolated rabbit aortic strips, vinpocetine (0.01 and 0.1 mM) inhibited the contraction and 45Ca uptake due to both phenylephrine (1 microM) and KCl (40 mM), whereas 8-Br-cyclic GMP (0.1-1mM) selectively impaired phenylephrine-induced responses. Furthermore, the KCl-stimulated 45Ca efflux in normal Ca2+ buffer, which reflects elevated cytosolic Ca2+, was greatly diminished by vinpocetine but not by 8-Br-cyclic GMP. However, phenylephrine-induced 45Ca efflux and contraction in Ca2+-free buffer, which reflect Ca2+ release from intracellular sites, were similarly inhibited by both vinpocetine and 8-Br-cyclic GMP. The results suggest that vinpocetine may effect vasodilatation through blockade of the slow channel and selective inhibition of CaM-PDE in the vascular smooth muscle.\r"

The purpose of this work was to study the localization of kallikrein along the human nephron to elucidate whether there exists an anatomical base for such interrelation. Serial sections of human kidney tissue were stained by immunocytochemical methods with antisera against kallikrein. Kallikrein immunostaining was observed exclusively in segments of the distal nephron lying in the cortical labyrinths and forming arcades in its distal portion. Consistently the tubules containing kallikrein established a close anatomical relationship with the afferent arteriole of the juxtaglomerular apparatus providing an anatomical base for an interaction between the renin and kallikrein systems in the human kidney.\r"

A high Na+ diet caused significant increases in the synthesis of 5 beta-reduced metabolites, primarily 3 alpha, 5 beta-tetrahydroaldosterone; whereas a low Na+ diet stimulated the 5 alpha-reductase pathway causing increases in the synthesis of 5 alpha-dihydroaldosterone and 3 beta 5 alpha-tetrahydroaldosterone, as well as certain polar, hydroxylated metabolites of aldosterone. These studies demonstrate that dietary Na+, a known regulator of aldosterone synthesis, may also regulate enzymes involved in aldosterone metabolism in peripheral tissues.\r"

S caused a significant -12 +/- 2 mm Hg decrease in MBP in PA, -5 +/- 2 mm Hg in EH, and -4 +/- 1 mm Hg in RVH. Reduction in MBP was significantly higher in PA than in the others and there was a negative correlation between changes in MBP and basal PAC. The cardiac index did not change throughout the study in all groups, which led to a significant reduction in total peripheral resistance index (TPRI) in PA but not in the others. There was a significant correlation between changes in MBP and TPRI (r = 0.82, p less than 0.01). PRA did not change throughout the study, but PAC and cortisol were significantly elevated. There were no correlations between changes in MBP and hormonal responses. In conclusion, S resulted in a significant reduction of MBP mediated by a significant reduction of TPRI. These results suggest that aldosterone may have direct vasoconstrictive action and this extrarenal effect of aldosterone may be involved in the regulation of blood pressure.\r"

Washed erythrocytes from spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs; aged 4 and 10-13 weeks) and from patients with essential hypertension, or cultured vascular smooth muscle cells from SHRs were examined and compared with those from normotensive controls. Electron spin resonance spectra for a fatty acid spin label-agent (5-nitroxy stearate) in the membranes were obtained. The values of hyperfine splitting and other parameters of the spectra were significantly higher in erythrocytes from hypertensive rats than in normotensive controls. Similar results were obtained in cultured vascular smooth muscles. These findings indicate that the membrane fluidity might be decreased in hypertension. When calcium was loaded to erythrocytes with Ca-ionophore A23187, the fluidity was decreased. The alternative degrees were greater in hypertensive rats than in controls, and these hypertensive changes were antagonized by diltiazem or verapamil. The results revealed that abnormalities of membrane fluidity in hypertension might be more prominent in the presence of calcium. Further, it is suggested that calcium antagonists could correct these membrane abnormalities in hypertension.\r"

To better define this problem from a diagnostic and therapeutic standpoint, we studied patients admitted to the surgical intensive care unit at the University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston-Hermann Hospital over a six-month period. During this time, we identified 19 cases of maxillary sinusitis. Diagnostic criteria included fever, leukocytosis, purulent rhinorrhea, and maxillary sinus opacification or air fluid level noted on sinus roentgenograms. Patients who met these criteria underwent maxillary sinus aspiration. Sixteen patients were receiving antibiotic therapy when sinusitis was diagnosed. All patients had their endotracheal tubes replaced orally, had diseased maxillary antra lavaged, and underwent appropriate antibiotic therapy guided by culture and sensitivity studies. Four of 19 patients required more than one sinus lavage, but all patients had their sinus disease resolve. These data suggest an aggressive approach to diagnosing sinusitis in the nasotracheally intubated patient is needed. A maxillary sinus aspiration and lavage should be an integral part of the diagnosis and treatment of these patients.\r"

Passive opening of the eustachian tube remained normal until the tumor occupied the parapharyngeal space (stage III). However, active tubal opening was impaired in stage I and the impairment increased with the tumor stage.

Nine of ten control mice, to which splenic T cells from saline-fed mice were administered, developed OME, while OME was seen in only one of ten mice receiving splenic T cells from OVA-fed mice.

On the contrary, infants with ABR thresholds higher than 40-dB hearing level never had EOAEs.

The RWM, 48 hours following the application of endotoxin or exotoxin, became significantly more permeable to tetraethylammonium chloride than the normal RWM. Two weeks after the obstruction of the eustachian tube, the permeability of the RWM was decreased. These results suggest that bacterial toxins and the consequential migration of chemical inflammatory mediators act as promotive factors of RWM permeability, and that a pathologic thickness of the RWM and the presence of effusion induced by the obstruction of the eustachian tube acts as an inhibitory factor. In the clinical role of RWM permeability in human otitis media, these two factors must be taken into consideration.\r"

  ".W": "During the 58-year period from 1928 through 1986, 80 patients 18 years of age or younger were treated or seen in consultation at Children's Hospital, Boston, for an epithelial or nonepithelial tumor of salivary gland origin. Using established criteria, ten (40%) of the 25 epithelial tumors were pleomorphic adenomas and the remaining tumors were classified as histologically malignant growths including mucoepidermoid carcinoma (n = 6), acinic cell carcinoma (n = 5), and adenocarcinoma most likely of duct cell origin (n = 2). Two other carcinomas presented as congenital parotid salivary gland tumors in newborns and were considered to have biphasic composition including both epithelial and myoepithelial cells, with the latter type predominating. There was only one tumor-related death due to metastases among the 15 children with malignant epithelial tumors (7%); four other patients experienced a local recurrence of tumor (27%). Of the 55 nonepithelial tumors, capillary hemangioma was the most common and showed distinct predilection for female infants with localization in the left parotid gland. The histologic spectrum of primary salivary gland tumors in infancy and childhood is distinctive and merits careful correlation with therapeutic strategies.\r"

The cricopharyngeal muscle is dissected free via a lateral cervical incision. To cut the muscle fibers it is necessary to expose and to stretch them. A device is developed to make this possible. A light source is brought within a cuffed tube. The tube is inserted in the esophagus with the cuff in the cricopharyngeal sphincter. Inflating the cuff with air causes stretching of the muscle fibers, whereas the light source inside makes all muscle fibers visible. They can be cut carefully, leaving the mucosa intact.\r"

Since the fascial layers of the mediastinum are a direct continuation of the cervical fascia, a number of potential pathways between the neck and mediastinum exist. Descending infection from the neck into the mediastinum is well documented. The reverse situation, an ascending infection from the mediastinum into the neck, is not described despite the potential natural pathways available for spread of infection. Our proposed mechanism for these two cases is that a surgically created pathway from the mediastinum to the lower neck allows for mediastinitis to point in the intercommunicating fascial spaces of the neck. Recognition of this clinical presentation will allow the surgeon to use prompt intervention for such a serious complication.\r"

We describe a 12-year-old black girl with sickle cell anemia who, since the age of 9 years, has been repeatedly hospitalized for pain associated with vaso-occlusive disease. A diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea was suggested by the history and physical examination and was confirmed by polysomnography. Following preoperative transfusion, the patient underwent elective tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy. She has been free of vaso-occlusive pain and crises for over two years and has not been hospitalized since her surgery. Post-operative polysomnography has shown no evidence of obstructive sleep apnea. It is our hypothesis that repeated oxygen desaturation during periods of obstructive sleep apnea was the cause of this patient's frequent vaso-occlusive crises. She not only obtained complete relief of her symptoms, but objective sleep study measurements were normal following surgery. Obstructive sleep apnea is a recent diagnosis, and its pathologic effects are only beginning to be known. Physicians taking care of patients with hemoglobinopathies need to be aware of possible contributing factors to their patients' disease, and an aggressive approach to their diagnosis and possible relief should be sought.\r"

In six hospitals all fetuses were either buried or cremated; 25 hospitals had facilities for photography and 24 made special religious services available. Other facilities available in some centres included the provision of blessing cards and a 'remembrance book' and the appointment of a bereavement counsellor. In five of the local crematoria or cemeteries a special plot of land was reserved for stillbirths and younger fetuses. The relative costs of these facilities are discussed.\r"

The mean birthweight of the groups differed. There were also social and biological differences such as might partly explain birthweight variations so comparisons were repeated after allowing for these factors. Standardized mean birthweights were greater for all groups who stopped than for persistent smokers. Those who stopped before 6 weeks and between 6 and 16 weeks gestation had infants 217 and 213 g, respectively, heavier than the persistent smokers and similar to the non-smokers. Babies born to those who stopped after 16 weeks, or temporarily, were intermediate in weight. Appropriate advice is that stopping any time before 16 weeks is best, but stopping after this is still beneficial.\r"

Twenty women were allocated to receive 100 mg RU 486 orally 1 h before the hCG injection, the remaining 20 women acted as controls. There was no significant difference in the cleavage rate of the oocytes after fertilization in vitro between the two groups (56% and 66% respectively). Also, the morphological characteristics of the cleaving oocytes and the concentrations of oestradiol, progesterone and androstenedione in the follicular fluid of the leading follicle did not differ significantly between the two groups. Since RU 486 was detected in substantial amounts in the follicular fluid specimens, these results suggest that progesterone is not critical for the final stages of human oocyte maturation.\r"

The larva was initially found intraretinally in the inferior parts of the fundus. From this position it moved into the macula lutea within two days, causing decreased visual acuity. Acute vitrectomy was performed and the larva was removed through a retinotomy. About two months afterwards a small retinal detachment appeared near the ora serrata, where the larva had entered the eye. The retina was reattached with a scleral buckling procedure. The patient regained most of his vision postoperatively. Pars plana vitrectomy is a safe procedure and we consider that in any case of OIP, with a living larva in the eye, acute vitrectomy should be considered, since the larva may damage vital parts of the eye. Furthermore, the site of entrance should be treated with photocoagulation to prevent retinal detachment.\r"

Subsequent examination in our clinic revealed pseudoproptosis secondary to retraction of the left upper eyelid. Magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated normal orbital structures. The mother was noted to be clinically hyperthyroid, and abnormal thyroid function tests confirmed the diagnosis. Although the infant was euthyroid, neonatal Graves' ophthalmopathy was diagnosed.

In a total of 69 relapses, CIC were increased in one-third of patients and antiretinal antibodies in one-half. In those 34 patients who expressed antiretinal antibodies 27 (79%) of the relapses were characterised by antiretinal antibodies in the absence of raised CIC levels (p less than 0.01). These findings support our previous hypothesis that CIC may have a protective role in autoimmune retinal vasculitis and that antiretinal autoimmunity is of pathogenetic importance in relapse. In individual patients the visual outcome was not related to the number of relapses or to the CIC-autoantibody pattern, suggesting the operation of additional features which merit identification.\r"

The TSP-promoted aggregation is specific since a monoclonal antibody against TSP inhibits the effect of exogenously added TSP and inhibits thrombin-induced platelet aggregation in the absence of added TSP. Several lines of evidence suggest that TSP mediates its effect on aggregation of nonstimulated and stimulated platelets through different platelet-surface receptor systems. The TSP-promoted aggregation of nonstimulated platelets was inhibited by a monoclonal antibody to platelet glycoprotein IV (GPIV), but not by a monoclonal antibody to the fibrinogen receptor, GPIIb-IIIa. In contrast, the antibody to GPIIb-IIIa totally inhibited the TSP-potentiated aggregation of thrombin-stimulated platelets, whereas the antibody to GPIV has no effect. Thus, these studies suggest that TSP promotes platelet aggregation by at least two mechanisms--one dependent on and one independent of the platelet fibrinogen receptor system.\r"

In the absence of serum, neutrophil adherence to influenza-infected confluent monolayers of Madin-Darby canine kidney epithelial cells (MDCK) was approximately 590 times greater than neutrophil binding to control cultures. The leukocytes bound specifically to virus-infected cells. Neutrophil adherence to influenza-infected MDCK cells was monitored during the course of one replication cycle, and binding began at a time (4.5 hours) that coincided with viral protein insertion in the apical cell membrane. Ultrastructural examination at 4.5 hours showed that greater than 90% of the neutrophils adhered to the epithelial cell membrane in the absence of budding virus and, at 6.5 hours, 100% of the neutrophils adhered to the epithelium with emerging virions. The number of neutrophils bound to influenza-infected MDCK cells was not affected by the presence or absence of calcium or magnesium but did depend on the amount of viral inoculum and on the temperature of the culture. In direct contrast to hemadsorption of RBCs, neutrophil binding to influenza-infected MDCK cells was 100% greater at 37 degrees C than at 4 degrees C. The neutrophil surface molecules that bound influenza virus appeared to become functionally polarized because the adherence of neutrophils to budding influenza virus or to a virus-coated surface inhibited the neutrophils from binding additional influenza virus to their nonadherent surface.\r"

Clonal chromosome abnormalities were found in the cells of all patients with DS-AL but not those with DS-TMD. The younger ages and higher hemoglobin concentrations, platelet counts, and WBC counts of DS-TMD patients provided a clinical contrast with the frankly leukemic cases. Myelodysplastic syndrome, characterized by a small percentage of leukemic blast cells, was observed in 11 of the 13 patients with DS-AL compared with none in the DS-TMD group. Electron microscopy disclosed a positive platelet peroxidase reaction in each of the 11 DS-TMD patients and in nine of the 13 DS-AL patients. Immunologic studies revealed antiplatelet-megakaryocyte antigens on the blast cells of the majority of patients in both study groups. Our findings suggest that the blast cells in cases of DS-AL and DS-TMD arise from cells of the megakaryocytic lineage or from a myeloid progenitor with the capacity for megakaryocytic differentiation. The high risk of the development of AL in patients with DS who are less than 3 years old may be related to increased megakaryocyte proliferation in this age group.\r"

  ".U": "88269809\r", 
  ".W": "The Charcot-Leyden crystal (CLC) protein is a unique constituent of eosinophils and basophils. This protein forms the hexagonal bipyramidal crystals observed in tissues at sites of eosinophil accumulations, possesses lysophospholipase activity (lysolecithin acylhydrolase E.C.3.1.1.5), and comprises an estimated 7% to 10% of total eosinophil protein. The ultrastructural localization of CLC protein was studied in mature peripheral blood eosinophils from normal donors and from patients with the idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome. Subcellular localization was evaluated by immunoelectron microscopy using eosinophils, both from buffy coat and purified cell suspensions, that were fixed by a variety of methods. Immunochemical detection of CLC protein employed rabbit antiserum to eosinophil CLC protein, affinity chromatography-purified monospecific IgG antibodies, and postembedding immunogold techniques. Controls for specificity included (1) omission of the primary antibody to CLC protein and (2) substitution of primary antibody with a nonimmune preimmunization serum, a protein A-purified nonimmune IgG, or a protein A-purified nonreactive IgG prepared from solid-phase CLC protein-Sepharose-absorbed anti-CLC antiserum. CLC protein was localized to a minor (approximately 5%) subpopulation of eosinophil granules. These membrane-bound cytoplasmic granules were large (greater than 0.5 mu), were devoid of crystalloid inclusions, and were morphologically compatible with persisting eosinophil primary granules. The crystalloid-containing, large, specific granules did not stain for CLC protein. Insufficient numbers of small dense granules, lipid bodies, and vesiculotubular structures were present to adequately evaluate their potential as additional sites for the subcellular localization of CLC protein. The cellular specificity of the immunogold localization of CLC protein in the eosinophil was affirmed by the absence of staining in neutrophils and lymphocytes present in the same sections. The ultrastructural immunogold localization of CLC protein (lysophospholipase) to a large, crystalloid-free granule in mature circulating eosinophils supports the persistence of a distinct \"primary\" granule population that serves as a major intracytoplasmic repository for this enzyme.\r"

Lymphocytes and monocytes were incubated under serum-free conditions without and with cytochalasin B, cytochalasin D, or colchicine, and effects on positive and negative erythropoietic activities were determined in cell membranes and in surface membrane vesicle-rich pellets and supernatants of dialyzed medium conditioned by the cells. In serum-free cultures of human bone marrow, plasma membranes and exfoliated membrane-derived vesicles from cytochalasin-treated lymphocytes lost their capacity to support the formation of erythroid bursts, while monocyte membrane-associated inhibitory activity was abolished by preincubation with cytochalasin. In contrast, membrane-associated activities of colchicine-treated cells were unaffected. Cytochalasin-induced alterations of membrane regulatory molecules were observed in a dose-dependent fashion over a wide range of concentrations (1 to 100 micrograms/mL) tested. However, the capacity of membrane vesicle-free supernatants of medium conditioned by lymphocytes or monocytes was unaffected by cytochalasins, regardless of drug concentration used. Lysates of cytochalasin B-treated cells inhibited the activity of deoxyribonuclease I to a greater degree than did lysates of untreated cells, suggesting that the relative amount of monomeric actin is increased in the cytoplasm of treated cells. Furthermore, results of experiments with D-glucose and with cytochalasin D suggest that cytochalasin effects are independent of alterations in glucose metabolism. The data indicate that expression of plasma membrane-associated regulators is sensitive to agents that block polymerization of actin. They raise the possibility that changes in distribution of actin between unpolymerized and filamentous pools may influence the organization and/or function of mononuclear cell surface-associated erythroid regulatory molecules.\r"

  ".W": "Vitronectin, also known as serum-spreading factor or S-protein, mediates cell adhesion and inhibits formation of the membrane-lytic complex of complement and the rapid inactivation of thrombin by antithrombin III in the presence of heparin. Vitronectin is normally present in plasma at a concentration of approximately 300 micrograms/mL. The investigators quantified plasma vitronectin with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and visualized reduced and nonreduced vitronectin by immunoblotting after separation of plasma or serum by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). The concentration of plasma vitronectin was markedly reduced in some patients with disseminated intravascular coagulation, especially in those with liver failure; it was near normal in patients with metastatic cancer and acute leukemia. Patients with vitronectin levels less than 40% normal invariably had low fibrinogen and antithrombin III and a prolonged prothrombin time. In both normal and patient plasmas there was heterogeneity in the ratio of the 75,000- and 65,000-mol wt polypeptides of reduced vitronectin: 18% had mostly the 75,000-mol wt polypeptide, 59% had roughly equal amounts of the two polypeptides, and 22% had mostly the 65,000-mol wt polypeptide. This polymorphism is inherited and appears to be due to two alleles that are present with approximately equal frequency. The blotting patterns of vitronectin in reduced and nonreduced plasmas were largely unaltered in plasma of patients with defibrination syndrome, fibrinolysis, liver failure, sepsis, metastatic cancer, and acute leukemia. There was no evidence of fragmentation of vitronectin or formation of the disulfide-bonded complex of vitronectin and thrombin-antithrombin III that is found when blood is clotted. Thus these results corroborate in vitro observations that the liver is the major source of plasma vitronectin, suggest that vitronectin may become depleted during disseminated intravascular coagulation, and define a genetic polymorphism of vitronectin.\r"

  ".W": "Phorbol esters induce the human HL-60 promyelocytic cell line to differentiate along a monocytic pathway. This induction of differentiation may involve phorbol ester-induced activation of the phospholipid- and calcium-dependent protein kinase C. Bryostatin 1, a macrocyclic lactone, has been shown to compete with phorbol esters for binding to protein kinase C. We have confirmed that bryostatin 1 translocates activity of protein kinase C from the cytosolic to membrane fractions of HL-60 cells. The present results also demonstrate that bryostatin 1 (10 nmol/L) induces monocytic differentiation of HL-60 cells as determined by adherence, growth inhibition, appearance of monocyte cell surface antigens, and alpha-naphthyl acetate esterase staining. Furthermore, bryostatin 1 (10 nmol/L) downregulated c-myc expression and induced c-fos, c-fms, and tumor necrosis factor transcripts. These changes in gene expression induced by bryostatin 1 are similar to those associated with phorbol ester-induced monocytic differentiation of HL-60 cells. In contrast, exposure to a higher concentration of bryostatin 1 (100 nmol/L) had less of an effect on growth inhibition of HL-60 cells and changes in gene expression. Moreover, 100 nmol/L bryostatin 1 antagonized the cytostatic effects and adherence induced by phorbol esters. Our results thus suggest that bryostatin 1 activates HL-60 cell protein kinase C and that this effect is associated with induction of monocytic differentiation.\r"

That PMA2 recognized the CD9 antigen was confirmed by its immunoblot-reactivity with a 24,000-dalton protein, reactivity with platelets and common acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cells, and competitive binding with the ALB6 antibody known as the CD9 antibody. At saturation, PMA2 bound to approximately 46,000 sites per platelet. The binding of 125I-fibrinogen to platelets occurred in a PMA2 concentration-dependent manner and was blocked by EDTA or an anti-glycoprotein (GP)IIb-IIIa monoclonal antibody. PMA2-stimulated platelets caused ATP secretion and thromboxane B2 synthesis under non-stirred conditions. The role of secreted ADP and thromboxane in fibrinogen-binding and subsequent platelet aggregation was studied using creatine phosphate/creatine phosphokinase (CP/CPK) and aspirin. CP/CPK or aspirin alone reduced fibrinogen binding to 20% to 30%; however, this binding was sufficient to support full platelet aggregation. Combined treatment with CP/CPK and aspirin abolished fibrinogen binding and aggregation. These results demonstrate that the binding of IgG molecules to the CD9 antigen exposes fibrinogen receptors through both secreted ADP and thromboxane and that either one of both can expose the receptors to an extent sufficient to aggregate platelets.\r"

Using immunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence techniques, we showed that the Zwa antigen is either expressed or absent from both platelets and endothelial cells of the same individual. This finding indicates that in both cell types the same gene is expressed. We also showed that Zwa-negative endothelial cells express Zwb (PIA2), in analogy to Zwa-negative platelets. Moreover, our results strongly suggest expression on endothelial cells of Yukb, a recently described platelet alloantigen, also located on GPIIIa. However, we could not demonstrate expression on the endothelial VnR alpha subunit of Baka, an alloantigen located on platelet GPIIb. These findings are in agreement with the concept that the endothelial GPIIIa subunit is more closely related to its platelet counterpart than to the endothelial VnR alpha subunit.\r"

  ".W": "To better understand the limited hematopoietic life span of human marrow \"Dexter\" cultures, we developed a miniaturized, two-stage culture system with which in vitro production of hematopoietic progenitors could be reproducibly detected and quantified. Light-density, gradient-separated human marrow cells were inoculated into Leighton slide tubes, and adherent (\"stromal\") cell layers were allowed to develop on the removable coverslips within these tubes during an initial 4 weeks of culture. Once stromal cell layers were established, cultures were irradiated (800 cGy) to eliminate all residual hematopoietic progenitors. The cultures were then recharged with autologous, cryopreserved marrow cells (enriched for BFU-E and CFU-GM) to reconstitute stem cell populations and to initiate in vitro hematopoiesis. Most progenitor cells added to irradiated cultures were no longer detectable by clonal assays within one to four days after recharge. Nonetheless, stable populations of adherent BFU-E and CFU-GM became established in these cultures within 24 to 48 hours, and when the total numbers of progenitors (adherent and nonadherent) were measured at weekly intervals thereafter, it was evident that both BFU-E and CFU-GM were generated in vitro. However, progenitor cell production declined as neutrophils and macrophages accumulated in the cultures. Moreover, with this accumulation of mature myeloid cells, increasing levels of O2- and H2O2 could be detected in the cultures, and it was found that the addition of oxidant scavengers (catalase and mannitol) to culture media enhanced the weekly expansions of progenitor cell numbers that could be measured. These findings support the conclusion that reactive O2 intermediates generated by mature myeloid cells have a role in limiting the duration and extent of hematopoietic progenitor cell self-renewal in long-term \"Dexter\" cultures of human marrow.\r"

The human gene encoding p67 was isolated in a mouse genetic background after DNA-mediated gene transfer and fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) for transformants that bound the monoclonal antibody MY9. After three serial rounds of gene transfer and cell sorting, multiple independently derived tertiary mouse cell transformants were obtained that expressed p67. Southern blot analysis revealed that these transformants shared restriction fragments containing highly reiterated human DNA sequences. Two shared EcoRI fragments of 3.3-kilobase (kb) and 9.5-kb pairs were molecularly cloned into bacteriophage vectors. A subsegment of the 3.3-kb fragment lacking repeated sequences was then used as a unique sequence probe to isolate two independent cosmid clones. Cells transfected with DNA from both cosmid clones bound MY9, and the human p67 protein was demonstrated by immunoprecipitation. NFS mice inoculated with a mouse cell transformant coexpressing p67 and the v-fms oncogene product produced antisera that specifically immunoprecipitated p67 from human leukemic cell lines, mouse cell transformants, and mouse cells transfected with the biologically active cosmid clones. The human p67 locus was previously assigned to chromosome 19 by screening a panel of rodent X human somatic cell hybrids with the unique sequence probe. The gene was sublocalized to the q13.3 region of chromosome 19 by in situ hybridization. RNA transcripts of approximately 1.6 kb and 1.4 kb were identified in polyadenylated RNA from human myeloid leukemia cell lines using a probe from the genomic locus. Manipulation of the cloned p67 gene may provide insight into the function of its product and mechanisms regulating its expression.\r"

  ".W": "The cell-free system for activation of the neutrophil NADPH oxidase allowed us to examine activation of the oxidase in the absence of its NADPH-dependent turnover. The covalent sulfhydryl-modifying reagent N-ethylmaleimide completely inhibited the activation step (Ki = 40 mumol/L) in the cell-free system but had no effect on turnover of the preactivated particulate NADPH oxidase (up to 1 mmol/L). When N-ethylmaleimide was added to intact neutrophils during the period of maximal O2 generation in response to stimuli that activate the respiratory burst (phorbol myristate acetate, f-Met-Leu-Phe, opsonized zymosan, arachidonic acid), O2- generation ceased within seconds. Study of components of the cell-free activation system indicated that the cytosolic cofactor was irreversibly inhibited by N-ethylmaleimide whereas the N-ethylmaleimide-treated, membrane-associated oxidase could be activated by arachidonate and control cytosolic cofactor. Likewise, the cell-free system prepared from intact neutrophils that had been briefly exposed to N-ethylmaleimide and then washed reflected the effects of N-ethylmaleimide on the isolated cell-free components: cytosolic cofactor activity was absent, but the membrane oxidase remained fully activatable. Thus inhibition of oxidase activation by N-ethylamaleimide unmasked a rapid deactivation step that was operative in intact neutrophils but not in isolated particulate NADPH oxidase preparations. The demonstrated specificity of N-ethylmaleimide for oxidase activation and lack of effect on turnover of the NADPH oxidase suggested that sustained O2- generation by intact neutrophils was a result of continued replenishment of a small pool of active oxidase. The existence of an inactive pool of NADPH oxidase molecules in particulate preparations from stimulated neutrophils was supported more directly by activating these preparations again in the cell-free system.\r"

The expression of the PLA1 antigen is detectable as early as 19 weeks of gestation. Alloimmunization can therefore lead to fetal thrombocytopenia very early in pregnancy. Until recently, we have had no means of detecting and assessing the severity of fetal thrombocytopenia during pregnancy. The level of the maternal antibody is not of a predictable value since 20% of the mothers had no circulating antibodies in our series. An alternative approach is to carry out investigations on fetal blood samplings. This management leads to an exact knowledge of the fetal status and antenatal diagnosis is feasible as early as the 21st week of gestation. Early diagnosis facilitates appropriate management and makes possible such therapeutic options as in utero maternal platelet transfusions. We report our experience in the antenatal diagnosis and management of nine cases with in utero transfusion in the six cases with severe thrombocytopenia. All neonates did well, with no signs of bleeding at birth. No side effects of therapy were noted after a period ranging from 6 months to 3 years.\r"

  ".U": "88269846\r", 
  ".W": "IgG, IgA, IgM, and albumin are primarily known as plasma proteins. Their presence in platelets is poorly understood. The total platelet content of IgG, IgA, and albumin, measured in solubilized platelets by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent-assay (ELISA) technique, was greater than 90% secreted after stimulation by thrombin, consistent with an alpha-granule location. The platelet concentrations of these proteins correlated with their plasma concentrations in normal subjects and over a wide range of abnormalities in patients with IgG or IgA myeloma or liver cirrhosis. IgM was not detectable in normal platelets but was measurable and related to the plasma IgM concentration in patients with macroglobulinemia. In patients with idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), the platelet concentrations of IgG, IgA, and albumin were all twofold to threefold higher than normal despite normal plasma concentrations. Platelet surface IgG, measured by 125I-monoclonal antibody binding, constituted less than 1% of the total platelet IgG, and it appeared to be a pool distinct from the alpha-granule IgG since its concentration in normal subjects and patients did not correlate with either plasma or total platelet IgG concentrations. These observations are consistent with hypotheses that megakaryocytes incorporate plasma proteins into developing alpha-granules by pinocytosis and that the increased ratio of platelet to plasma of IgG, IgA, and albumin in ITP may reflect a younger average age of these platelets.\r"

Because he was adopted and childless, the hereditary nature of the defect could not be established. The residual enzyme activity was only about 15% of mean normal. Depletion of glutathione (GSH) from the cells by 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (CDNB), a substrate for GST, was somewhat decreased in the red cells from the patient, suggesting that a functional defect existed. The kinetic properties of the residual enzyme and the ratio of activity to antigenicity were normal. Modest decreases in leukocyte and platelet GST activities were documented. Although a cause-and-effect relationship between the GST deficiency and hemolysis may exist, this cannot be proven in the absence of affected family members.\r"

Screening of sickle cell patients has revealed a family with elevated Hb F and high A gamma values. The propositus was a sickle cell patient with approximately 25% Hb F and 68.4% A gamma. He was heterozygous for the Benin (#19) and Mor beta S haplotypes. Five AS relatives with the Mor haplotype had 2.5% +/- 0.9% fetal hemoglobin and 92.8% +/- 2.8% A gamma, whereas two with the Benin haplotype had normal fetal hemoglobin (0.5%). The Mor haplotype is thus associated with the elevated Hb F in this family. The 13-kilobase (kb) Bg/II fragment containing the G gamma and A gamma genes of the Mor haplotype was cloned, and the G gamma and A gamma promoters sequenced from -383 to beyond the Cap sites. The Mor G gamma gene was normal, but the A gamma gene had a unique C----T mutation at -202. A different mutation at -202 of G gamma (C----G) was previously detected by other researchers in association with considerably higher Hb F in AS cases (15% to 25%). These data suggest either that -202 mutations affect the G gamma and A gamma promoters differently or that different nucleotide substitutions at -202 have divergent effects. Alternatively, additional unknown mutations could cause the differences in gene expression.\r"

  ".U": "88269856\r", 
  ".W": "Previous studies have indicated that activated blood platelets interact with fibronectin through binding of fibronectin to the glycoprotein IIb-IIIa complex (GPIIb-IIIa). The cell attachment site of fibronectin with its crucial arg-gly-asp(-ser) [RGD(S)]sequence is involved in these bindings. We studied the importance of these interactions for the fibronectin dependence of platelet adhesion under flow conditions. An RGDS-containing hexapeptide (GRGDSP) was compared with a nonreactive control peptide (GRGESP). The GRGDSP-peptide inhibited thrombin-induced aggregation and adhesion under static conditions at 0.1 mmol/L. This concentration had no effect on platelet adhesion to nonfibrillar collagen type I in flow. GRGDSP at 1 mmol/L had a significant inhibitory effect at 1,500 s-1, but not at the lower shear rates of 800 and 300 s-1 where platelet adhesion is also fibronectin dependent. On the matrix of cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells, 1 mmol/L GRGDSP had no effect on platelet adhesion. The relation between GPIIb-IIIa and fibronectin dependence was investigated with platelets of a patient with Glanzmann's thrombasthenia and monoclonal antibodies to GPIIb-IIIa using endothelial cell matrix (ECM) as a surface. Platelets of normal controls or a patient with Glanzmann's thrombasthenia showed a similar inhibition of adhesion in the presence of fibronectin-free plasma after the ECMs had been preincubated with antifibronectin F(ab')2 fragments. Incubation of platelets with anti-GPIIb-IIIa showed inhibition of platelet adhesion at high shear rates. Dependence on fibronectin for platelet adhesion was still observed even though separate experiments had shown that these anti-GPIIb-IIIa antibodies could block binding of radiolabeled fibronectin to thrombin-activated platelets. These data suggest the existence of another binding system for the interaction of platelets with fibronectin that may only appear when fibronectin is present on a surface.\r"

Variceal obliteration was achieved in 33 (92 per cent) children with extrahepatic portal hypertension and 54 (75 per cent) with intrahepatic portal hypertension. Prophylactic injection sclerotherapy was used to obliterate large varices in 11 children with no history of haemorrhage. Bleeding episodes occurred in 38 (39 per cent) children before variceal obliteration was complete. However, the mortality rate from variceal bleeding was only 1 per cent. Complications were oesophageal ulceration (29 per cent) and stricture (16 per cent) which both resolved with conservative management. During a mean follow-up period of 2.9 years after sclerotherapy, recurrent oesophageal or gastric varices developed in 12 (12 per cent) cases, with rebleeding in 9 (9 per cent), but all responded successfully to a second course of treatment. These results are superior to contemporary surgical management and injection sclerotherapy should therefore currently be the primary treatment of choice for bleeding oesophageal varices in children.\r"

There was no significant difference between the two groups with regard to the mode of presentation, the location and Duke's classification of the tumours, the incidence of palliative operations, and the perioperative mortality. The surgical mortality rates in Group 1 were 6 per cent overall, 4 per cent after elective operations, and 16 per cent after emergency surgery; the corresponding mortality rates for Group 2 were 3 per cent, 1 per cent, and 20 per cent. Emergency surgery was associated with a significantly higher incidence of perioperative death at any age (P less than 0.001) and most deaths resulted from complications of coexisting medical disorders or thrombo-embolic complications. Crude actuarial 5-year survival curves showed an increased death rate in Group 1 after 18 months and a significantly lower 5-year survival (P less than 0.05) but the age-corrected survival curves for the two groups were not significantly different, and it was concluded that the prognosis for colorectal cancer in the elderly is not significantly different from that of younger patients.\r"

Twelve patients were Dukes' A, 26 B, 29 C, and 7 'D' (submitted to hepatic resection). Operative mortality rate was 3 per cent. Three patients (4 per cent) had clinical anastomotic leakage. Two patients (3 per cent) developed anastomotic stenosis. Local recurrence was present in three patients (4 per cent). The mean (+/- s.e.m.) overall survival rate at 5 years was 67 +/- 6 per cent. There was no significant difference in survival between Dukes' B and C (70 +/- 10 per cent versus 59 +/- 10 per cent, P = 0.209). Patients with absent local spread had a significantly better 5-year survival rate than those with positive local lymph nodes (80 +/- 7 per cent versus 54 +/- 9 per cent, P less than 0.01). The present results confirm the satisfactory use of the EEA stapler device for colorectal anastomoses in rectal cancer and in patients with resectable liver metastasis.\r"

Commonly, this is performed without any prior preparation of the bowel and with the patient in the left lateral (Sims') position. This study was designed to assess three factors relating to this method: preparation of the bowel; position of the patient; and the experience of the operator. The study shows that diagnostic accuracy without preparation is adequate in only 50 per cent of cases but, by employing a preliminary disposable (Fletcher's) enema, this can be improved to 80 per cent. Employing the knee-elbow position gave only slight advantage over the usual Sims' position and operator experience did not improve diagnostic accuracy once familiarity with the use of the sigmoidoscope had been achieved. The study underlines the importance of preparation as an essential prelude to sigmoidoscopy.\r"

Ten operations produced a complete cure, eleven improvement, and two no change in the patient's condition. Of 15 cases with neurological symptoms alone, 9 were cured, 5 improved and 1 was not helped; in contrast, of 8 patients with vascular symptoms, 1 was cured, 6 were improved and 1 was not helped. We conclude that cervical rib resection is the correct treatment for patients whose symptoms are predominantly neurological. Rib resection alone may not be sufficient in patients with vascular symptoms. The management of a cervical rib with vascular involvement is discussed.\r"

Early technical failure was similar in both groups (14 per cent common femoral artery, 12 per cent superficial femoral artery, P = n.s.). Cumulative life table patency rates at 1 and 3 years were 77 per cent and 72 per cent in common femoral artery grafts, and 80 per cent and 70 per cent in superficial femoral artery grafts (P = n.s.). Analysis of 92 veins in situ (65 common femoral artery and 27 superficial femoral artery) showed 1-year patency rates of 75 per cent in common femoral artery grafts and 79 per cent in superficial femoral artery grafts (P = n.s.). These results suggest that the proximal superficial femoral artery is a safe inflow site for distal bypasses.\r"

Treatment was then randomized either to ligation of incompetent lower leg communicating veins and ablation of incompetent superficial veins combined with permanent graduated compression elastic stockings, or to graduated compression elastic stockings only. Half volume refilling time (TV1/2) and relative expelled volume (EVrel) measured on foot volume plethysmography were used to assess calf muscle pump function. This was repeated after 12 months. The initial TV1/2 and EVrel were significantly lower than for normal limbs. There was no significant improvement in TV1/2 in either treatment group (Student's t test, P = 0.78, P = 0.19). EVrel did not improve significantly in limbs treated with elastic stockings alone (P = 0.94), but there was a slight but significant improvement in EVrel in limbs treated with surgery and elastic stockings (P = 0.048); however, this was still significantly below the normal range (P less than 0.001). In limbs without phlebographic evidence of post-thrombotic changes, treated with the combination of surgery and elastic stockings, there was a significant improvement in EVrel (P = 0.035), but no improvement was found in limbs with post-thrombotic changes. This small but significant improvement in EVrel in limbs without post-thrombotic changes treated by surgery and elastic stockings may explain the reduced incidence of reulceration that has been found following surgical eradication of the superficial and communicating veins.\r"

To determine whether this complication is less common in the subtropical climate of Brisbane than in more temperate locations, the incidence of DVT after major abdominal surgery was assessed by 125I fibrinogen scanning. In order to avoid overestimating the incidence of DVT, abnormal scans were accepted as diagnostic only if the DVT was confirmed by venography or if the abnormality on the scan fulfilled more stringent criteria than have previously been applied. Thirty-six of 152 patients (24 per cent) developed a DVT; this incidence was significantly lower than in one previous study from Melbourne and higher than that found in South-East Asia and East Africa, but was not significantly different from that reported from Sydney, Japan and several centres in North America and Britain. There was no apparent seasonal variation in the incidence of the complication. The geographical variation in incidence of postoperative DVT may have been overestimated in previous reports and may be at least partly due to variations in screening technique.\r"

The sensitivity was 64-67 per cent and the specificity was 94-100 per cent in these groups. Analysis of duodenal bile from 14 patients with 'idiopathic' pancreatitis revealed calcium bilirubinate crystals (but not cholesterol crystals) in 5 patients (36 per cent). Gallstones were confirmed at cholecystectomy in three of these patients and also in one other patient who had a gallstone on a 'late' ultrasound examination but was negative for crystals. Thus 29 per cent of the original 'idiopathic' group had gallstones confirmed. Gallstone analysis showed that pigment stones were present in 7 of 31 (23 per cent) non-pancreatitis controls compared with 9 of 13 (69 per cent) pancreatitis patients (P = 0.0048). These results suggest that duodenal bile crystal analysis (involving both calcium bilirubinate and cholesterol crystals) may be a useful technique for the investigation of patients with 'idiopathic' pancreatitis.\r"

Eight patients were excluded from the study because of incomplete data (n = 6) or additional diagnoses (n = 2). Thirty of the patients had successful ERCP and endoscopic sphincterotomy (ES); this failed in the remaining two because of severe papillary stenosis (6.3 per cent). Endoscopic biliary manometry was performed in 23 patients (77 per cent). Immediate post-ES complications occurred in eight patients (25 per cent). At a median follow-up of 46 months (range 10-88 months) 19 patients had a good outcome (63.3 per cent) and 11 patients had a poor outcome (36.7 per cent). Patients with a good outcome tended to have a delay of months or years following cholecystectomy before the development of symptoms (median 6 years versus 0 years, P = 0.0003). At ERCP, patients with a good outcome had greater common bile duct diameters (mean +/- s.d. mm, 12.6 +/- 3.6 versus 8.8 +/- 1.8, P = 0.0003) and delayed drainage from the biliary tree of injected contrast (13 versus 2 patients, P = 0.02). Endoscopic biliary manometry was abnormal in all 15 patients with a good outcome in whom it was performed but in only 3 out of 8 patients with a poor outcome (P = 0.003). Sphincter of Oddi dysfunction is an important, albeit uncommon, cause of post-cholecystectomy symptoms. ES provides symptomatic relief in the majority of patients but improved criteria for predicting outcome are required.\r"

  ".W": "Modifications have been proposed in an attempt to improve the clinical value of the original nine-factor Glasgow prognostic scoring system for acute pancreatitis. These include the omission of age or serum transaminase, reducing the factors to eight. Debate exists as to which system should be employed. Assessment of the individual factors in 198 attacks of acute pancreatitis treated conventionally revealed that only serum transaminase did not differ significantly between mild and severe outcome groups. Multivariate analysis demonstrated four factors (Pa,O2, white cell count, lactic dehydrogenase, and urea) with independent significance in predicting severity, while serum glucose, albumin and transaminase were least useful. Findings were similar when considering only patients with gallstone aetiology. The reduction of the prognostic factors to eight by the omission of either age or transaminase improved the predictive value of the scoring system, both when considering all attacks and those of gallstone aetiology alone. We suggest that serum transaminase should be omitted because: it shows no significant difference between mild and severe outcome groups, while age has prognostic significance; the system has greater sensitivity than if age is omitted; and the number of factors requiring emergency laboratory measurement for immediate prognostication is reduced by one.\r"

The figure increased to 21.3 per cent in patients aged over 75; the high mortality was accounted for by a higher incidence of deaths related to concomitant medical or surgical diseases in the same hospital admission rather than to complications resulting directly from the pathological process of acute pancreatitis. When only deaths due to complications of acute pancreatitis were analysed, the mortality rate was not significantly different between the young and elderly groups. Moreover, the complication rate and the proportion of patients having severe disease (judged by the number of prognostic signs) were not higher in the elderly. Thus acute pancreatitis was intrinsically not more serious were it not for the presence of concomitant diseases with advanced age.\r"

  ".W": "The management of pancreatic pain is a controversial subject and the treatment recommended varies from one extreme to the other. Some authorities advise simply waiting for chronic pancreatitis to 'burn out', while others practise removal of the entire gland. In this paper we present 141 patients who underwent surgery for chronic pancreatitis at the Mayo Clinic. The main indication for operation was pancreatic pain and the choice of operation was based on anatomical abnormalities in the gland. The long-term results of the policy are reviewed (mean follow-up 8.5 years). Length of history, aetiology of disease, pancreatic dysfunction and pathology, time after operation and continued alcohol abuse were computer analysed for a statistically significant influence on pain relief, ability to work, pancreatic function and survival. There was one operative death (mortality rate 0.7 per cent). Continued drinking was not shown to affect postoperative pain relief but 10-year survival was significantly less in alcoholics than in those with non-alcoholic pancreatitis (P less than 0.02). Dilated ducts and duct calculi were associated with good results for pain relief although this association did not achieve statistical significance. Parenchymal calcification and time after operation did not influence the results of surgery. When the operation failed to relieve pain, spontaneous remission occurred in a few cases only. Seventy-seven per cent of patients had lasting relief of pain and operations selected on the basis of gross pathology were equally effective in relieving pain. Longitudinal pancreaticojejunostomy in those with dilated ducts and a Whipple operation for disease of the pancreatic head gave good results.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

At discharge, patients were instructed to keep to recommended dietary allowances (RDA) and to record food intake on a specific form twice weekly. Nutritional follow-up was performed monthly and consisted of a computerized determination of food intake and of a nutritional assessment. The average daily energy intake was 6.10 MJ (1457.9 kcal) in the first postoperative month and 8.87 MJ (2118.4 kcal) in the sixth (P less than 0.0005). In the first monthly follow-up no patient reached RDA. By the sixth month mean daily calorie intake was greater than or equal to RDA in 14 patients (group A), while 9 patients (group B) did not reach RDA. A significant increase in body weight, serum albumin, total iron binding capacity and arm muscular circumference was observed in group A, while a significant decrease in body weight and arm muscular circumference was noted in group B. Moreover, of the seven patients who showed weight loss at 6 months only one was group A. These data indicate that malnutrition is not an inevitable consequence of total gastrectomy and can be prevented by an adequate calorie intake. A close relationship between dietary intake and postoperative nutritional parameters was observed. In gastrectomized patients a strict nutritional follow-up is very important to obtain an adequate dietary intake.\r"

  ".W": "We observed a 24-month-old infant who developed anaemia, thrombocytopenia and neutropenia while recuperating from an extensive burn. In order to determine the mechanism(s) responsible for the pancytopenia, we quantified marrow-derived haematopoietic progenitor cells, assessed the relative proliferative rate of haematopoietic progenitor cells, and sought the presence of progenitor cell inhibitors. The concentration and relative proliferative rate of pluripotent progenitors (CFU-GEMM) were elevated. No inhibitors of progenitor cells were observed; in fact, the patient's serum contained very high levels of stimulatory activity for CFU-GEMM as well as for granulocyte-macrophage progenitors (CFU-GM). However, the marrow concentration of erythroid progenitors (BFU-E and CFU-E) was diminished. We conclude that the anaemia in this patient was the result of either hypoproduction of differentiated erythroid progenitors or intramyeloid destruction of early erythroid cells. In contrast, the neutropenia was likely to be due to accelerated neutrophil consumption at a rate that exceeded the capacity for increasing neutrophil production.\r"

Two of these patients developed the toxic shock syndrome (TSS) and, together with seven previously diagnosed cases of the TSS, were studied as a separate group. The WCC response in the non-TSS (control) patients was compared with the response observed in the TSS group. In all patients there was an initial leucocytosis followed by a fall in WCC to a nadir between days 2 and 4. The nadir was significantly lower in the TSS group than that observed in the control group. A rise in the WCC was observed over the following 3-4 days in both groups. In the control group the changes in the WCC were mainly attributable to changes in the granulocyte count with little change in the lymphocyte count. There were similar changes in the granulocyte count in the TSS group but, in contrast to the control group, the lymphocyte count fell, to below the normal range, on day 3. The lowest lymphocyte count observed in the TSS group was significantly lower than that seen in the control group. The observation of a profound fall in the total WCC, granulocytes, and in particular the lymphocytes, between days 2 and 4 are additional factors that may help with the diagnosis of TSS.\r"

Thirty-four (62 per cent) were children, while 21 (38 per cent) were adults. In each of seven families, two or more people were affected. The overall mortality was 44 per cent, of which the larger contribution of 30 per cent was in children. By comparison, in the two preceding months there was a total of 17 and 20 burns admissions respectively. The mortality rate was 16 per cent while in March 1983 there was no death among the six paediatric admissions. Investigations showed that the explosions occurred due to petrol contamination of the kerosene before delivery to the domestic users. Appropriate precautions by kerosene suppliers and users, and health education can help prevent similar disasters in the future.\r"

The population of active rosette forming cells (ARFC) was observed to be significantly lower (P less than 0.001) in thermal injury patients compared with the normal subjects. The age and sex of the patient did not seem to have any significant effect on the ARFC population or the total lymphocyte count. The degree of burn had a significant (P less than 0.05) effect on the ARFC population but not the total lymphocyte count during the first 10 days immediately after burn, with partial skin thickness burn patients having more ARFC compared with full skin thickness burn patients. Further analysis of the data revealed an important correlation between the per cent ARFC in peripheral blood and the survival of the patients. Patients who died from their injuries showed a continuous decline in ARFC over the period of study, whereas the patients who survived showed a gradual increase until the ARFC number returned to within the normal range. The observed differences in the ARFC population between survivors and non-survivors were apparent as early as the first 10 days postinjury. Thus, the percentage of ARFC in the total peripheral blood may be used as an index for the early identification of patients at a greater risk of mortality.\r"

Barbiturate withdrawal requires pharmacotherapy and admission to hospital for patients who have taken more than 0.4 g/d of secobarbital or an equivalent amount of another barbiturate for 90 days or longer, or 0.6 g/d or an equivalent dose for 30 days or longer, or who have had withdrawal seizures or delirium; phenobarbital loading is recommended. Regular benzodiazepine therapy that has lasted at least 3 months should be gradually stopped. Short-acting agents should be replaced with long-acting ones, such as diazepam, to avoid withdrawal symptoms. Most of these patients can be managed on an outpatient basis.\r"

Response rates exceeded 70% across the three groups. The survey found that there has been a shift toward full-time academic oncologic practice and away from community oncologic practice by fellows. Program directors indicated the fellowship program afforded more benefits to fellows than fellows perceived, with the exception of the contribution to fellows' salaries. Program directors and fellows agreed on the most important aspects of a fellowship program (support a year of otherwise unavailable training and require exposure to research) but were in less agreement on other characteristics.\r"

Since the response to treatment of human carcinomas growing in nude mice is deemed to be a good indicator of the potential clinical behavior of these tumors, we studied the influence of this stable isotope of hydrogen on the growth of xenotransplanted human carcinomas of various histologic types, grades, and primary sites. Seven-week-old Balb/c-nu/nu mice were inoculated subcutaneously, either with oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinomas or with carcinomas of the large intestine. After tumor inoculation, the mice were given drinking water containing 30 atom% D2O. Heavy water effectively retarded the growth of the human carcinomas. At the end of the experiment, the weight of the tumors was reduced to values ranging from 22% to 65% of the control values. The reproducible antiproliferative effect was more conspicuous in poorly differentiated carcinomas than in moderately well-differentiated variants. Since animals in both groups, kept under identical conditions, drank the same amount of water and had similar body weights, the difference in tumor growth can be attributed to the moderate deuteration of the hosts.\r"

Those lesions that are not measurable may be evaluated for response using subjective criteria. We studied interobserver variability in tumor measurement in 21 patients with small cell lung cancer. In addition, we analyzed the effect that the variability in measurement had on the estimation of response to combination chemotherapy with and without chest radiotherapy. Half the readers agreed that pretreatment radiographs were measurable. Posttreatment, they were more often unmeasurable. Starting from a base of 100%, representing all measurable pretreatment films, posttreatment measurability rates fell to 78% and 53% on the 2-month and 4-month films. After radiotherapy, changes particularly reduced the readers' ability to measure the tumors. There was also less interobserver agreement on response after radiotherapy. The intraclass correlation coefficient for partial or complete response versus no response was 0.42 where no chest radiotherapy had been administered and 0.17 after radiotherapy. A measurable lesion on the initial radiograph was important in improving the consistency of evaluation of complete versus partial response particularly in films taken after chemotherapy alone. These data indicate that there is only fair agreement as to whether tumors were measurable and whether a response had occurred. More consistent results were seen in films taken before administration of radiotherapy. A measurable pretreatment film was important in improving interobserver consistency in differentiating a complete from a partial response.\r"

Hemihypertrophy developed in this patient by 2 months of age, and at 4 months of age spontaneous regression of all skin nodules and central nervous system (CNS) lesions was observed. Follow-up at 1 year shows the patient to be alive, well, and disease-free. Evaluation of the tumor included DNA ploidy analysis that showed the tumor to be polyploid, a pattern recently associated with nonmetastasizing adrenal cortical neoplasm. The observation of apparent metastatic disease that regressed spontaneously highlights the prognostic value of DNA ploidy analysis and raises the possibility of an adrenal tumor with properties similar to those of Stage IV-S neuroblastoma.\r"

Histologically, 11 patients had adenocarcinoma (four well-differentiated, three moderately differentiated, and four poorly differentiated), one had a large cell carcinoma, and one had a small cell carcinoma. All tumors had a BUdR LI greater than 5% (mean, 13.3 +/- 7% standard deviation). Moderately and poorly differentiated adenocarcinomas had a higher LI than well-differentiated adenocarcinomas (median, 15.3% versus 8.2%).

One hundred twenty-four of the 169 patients showed significantly high levels of the enzyme activity when compared to healthy controls, irrespective of the location of their tumor. However, enzyme levels were in the normal range in patients with non-neoplastic diseases, such as infectious disease, liver disease, and other inflammatory problems as well as in leukemic patients. The chromatofocusing profile of the enzyme using PBE-94 gel over a pH gradient from pH 6.0 to 4.0 demonstrated that the level of enzyme eluted at pH 5.4 was markedly elevated in the sera of stomach and ovarian cancer patients. A correlation was established between alpha(1----3)-L-fucosyltransferase activity and the presence of malignancy which may be used to evaluate the utility of the enzyme as a tumor marker.\r"

  ".W": "The predictive value of nuclear DNA content in breast cancer in relation to clinical and morphologic factors was studied in 227 consecutive cases of invasive breast adenocarcinomas with follow-up periods of 8 to 13 years. The results show that, with the use of Cox multivariate analysis nuclear DNA content provided significant prognostic information additional to that given by all other clinical and histomorphologic variables taken together. This fact indicates that the DNA content of breast cancer cells reflects biological properties, associated with the malignant behavior of the tumor, other than those determining the stage of the disease. Nuclear DNA content was strongly correlated to histopathologic grading of the ductal carcinomas, with poorly differentiated tumors more likely to be aneuploid. On the other hand, no clear correlation was found to exist between nuclear DNA content and axillary node status, indicating that these two factors are independent prognostic parameters. It is noteworthy that DNA content provided additional prognostic information within both the node-negative and node-positive patient groups. In summary, the results shown here indicate that nuclear DNA content, as an objective biological marker of tumor aggressiveness, can significantly improve our prognostic capabilities within the currently designated stages.\r"

Esophagitis was commonly found at endoscopic examination, but there was no difference in frequency of esophagitis in the randomly selected subjects from high-risk and low-risk areas. Although one third of patients with dysplasia developed cancer over a follow-up period of 30 to 78 months, only 4% of those with esophagitis alone developed EC. The authors conclude that dysplasia, diagnosed by cytologic or histologic examination, is a precancerous state, and that esophagitis is a nonspecific pathologic condition of the esophagus, but moderate and severe types of chronic esophagitis might create an environment favorable for the development of esophageal carcinoma.\r"

Although several reports have listed FNAB criteria to be used to diagnose both primary and metastatic tumors of the liver, none have separated key cytologic criteria from secondary criteria. We reviewed the FNAB smears from 35 patients with proven hepatocellular carcinoma and 74 patients with proven metastatic tumors in the liver. All specimens were coded as to the presence or absence of the following variables: polygonal cells with centrally placed nuclei; well-defined, granular cytoplasm; large nucleoli; small cytoplasmic vacuoles; large cytoplasmic vacuoles; bile; polymorphonuclear leukocytes; malignant cells separated by sinusoidal vessels; endothelial cells surrounding tumor cell clusters; multinucleated tumor giant cells; basophilic intracytoplasmic inclusions; eosinophilic intracytoplasmic inclusions; and intranuclear cytoplasmic inclusions. A step-wise logistic regression analysis was performed on the data to determine the variables predictive of hepatocellular carcinoma. The statistical analysis selected polygonal cells with centrally placed nuclei, malignant cells separated by sinusoidal capillaries, and bile as the key cytologic criteria for hepatocellular carcinoma. Endothelial cells surrounding tumor cell clusters and intranuclear cytoplasmic inclusions were selected as secondary criteria by this analysis.\r"

In the current study, we localized TM by immunohistochemistry in chorionic diseases of the uterus and choriocarcinomas of the stomach. The syncytiotrophoblast of hydatidiform mole contained TM. Uterine choriocarcinoma also had TM in the neoplastic syncytiotrophoblastic cells, although some of the neoplastic syncytiotrophoblastic cells showed no TM expression. Gastric choriocarcinoma never showed TM expression in the neoplastic syncytiotrophoblastic cells.

All 97 patients with no histologic diagnosis of choriocarcinoma were cured, including 19 patients considered at high risk initially. Among 65 histologic chariocarcinoma patients, 16 died (CR, 75.5%) including seven initially nonmetastatic patients. Using a univariate analysis, all factors tested in the whole group of patients were more or less significant except for age and parity. However, when the same variables were tested in patients considered at high risk initially, only three factors were statistically significant. Those three factors were the only ones associated with a statistically significant higher relative death risk (RR) on multivariate analysis and are as follows: an antecedent nonmolar pregnancy (RR = 4.3; P less than 0.01); initial presentation with more than one metastatic organ (RR = 7.4; P less than 0.01); and primary resistance to single agent (RR = 18.8; P less than 0.0001) or multi-agent chemotherapy (RR = 26.1; P less than 0.0001). It seems that those three factors, together with a histologic diagnosis of choriocarcinoma, are the prognostic factors that discriminate patients with unfavorable outcomes among the high-risk group.\r"

Recurrence was not significantly different in transfused patients when compared with patients who received no blood (P = 0.23) even when stratified for stage (Stage I, P = 0.58; Stage II, P = 0.14). Furthermore, the number of units transfused was not associated with time to tumor recurrence (P = 0.58).

Furthermore, another referent group consisting of 190 patients with another type of malignant disease was used in order to evaluate any influence of recall bias on the results. To obtain information about exposure to the studied chemicals, as well as about any other exposures that might be of interest, questionnaires were used, and if necessary these were completed over the phone by an interviewer who had no information regarding case-referent status. All analysis and interpretation of exposure data were done in a blinded manner. Exposure to phenoxyacetic acids gave a roughly three-fold increased risk for STS, thereby confirming previous findings, whereas exposure to chlorophenols was not associated with STS in this study.\r"

All subjects were hyperosmolar after dehydration (287 +/- 2.0 and 296 +/- 3.2 mosm/kg, plasma osmolality before and after dehydration, respectively; p = 0.02). Sweat chloride concentrations before and after dehydration were not different, and no positive sweat tests were observed. Sweat chloride concentrations after dehydration did not correlate with the degree of dehydration as assessed by either plasma sodium or plasma osmolality. We conclude that increased concentrations of chloride in sweat are not typically found in dehydrated subjects with CDI, although they have been reported in subjects with the nephrogenic form.\r"

During this period 74 athletically active boys (less than or equal to 15 years), 83 girls, 255 men (21-30 years), and 77 women visited the station because of an overuse sports injury of the musculoskeletal system. About one-third of the patients of each group did not seek medical help until more than 6 months after the onset of the symptoms. The injuries most commonly affected the lower extremities, with the knee joint involved in about one third of patients. In girls and women, the lower back (13%) was significantly more frequently affected than in boys and men (6%) (p less than 0.01). Thirty two percent of all boys' overuse problems were classified as exercise-induced growth disorders and osteochondritic pains (apophysitides, etc.), but in girls only 13% had a similar basis. The most common diagnosis among boys was Osgood-Schlatter's disease (13 patients, 18%); in girls it was nonspecific synovitis of the knee (9, 16%).\r"

The euphoric effect (high) intensified to a peak at about 1 hour and then declined toward baseline at 4 hours despite the presence of constant plasma cocaine levels. The chronotropic effect reached a peak within 10 minutes and then declined, with a half-life of 31 +/- 13 (mean +/- SD) minutes toward a plateau at 33% +/- 21% of its peak intensity. Tolerance development was quantified as an exponential process, with a rate constant (tolerance factor) accounting for the progressive alteration of the cocaine concentration-effect relationship.\r"

Evaluations were made before therapy (T1) and repeated 3 weeks later; this assessment included examination 2 and 8 hours after the morning dose (T2 and T3, respectively). Patients were randomized to either a placebo group or three study groups (25, 37.5, and 50 mg t.i.d.). In the 37.5 and 50 mg groups there was an increase in EF (T1 = 53.8% and 54.5%, T2 = 57.9% and 60.1%, and T3 = 57.6% and 60%) and PVR values (T1 = 5.2 and 7.2 mm Hg/ml/m2, T2 = 5.8 and 7.7 mm Hg/ml/m2, and T3 = 5.9 and 7.6 mm Hg/ml/m2, respectively). Wall motion remained the same or improved in 92.3% of the patients. In conclusion, gallopamil had no cardiodepressant effects in most patients. On the contrary, EF, PVR, and segmental contractility tended to improve with the higher doses.\r"

An effect compartment was included in the pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic model. Four subjects showed hysteresis, and mean values of half-lives-k(eo) ranged from 0.26 to 0.60 hour. Mean values of EC50 ranged from 42.0 to 48.1 ng/ml. Goodness of fit did not differ significantly between the sigmoid Emax model and the threshold Emax model. The sigmoid exponent estimated was 3.7 +/- 1.8 (EEG, mean +/- SD) and 2.9 +/- 1.4 (VER); the threshold concentration was estimated at 15.7 +/- 11.1 ng/ml (EEG) and 11.3 +/- 7.0 ng/ml (VER). We conclude that the Emax model adequately describes the relationship between midazolam concentration and effect and that the sigmoid exponent can be substituted by a threshold drug concentration, with a comparable fit of the model to the data.\r"

Maximum levels of nicotine were similar but, because of prolonged absorption, overall nicotine exposure was twice as large after single exposures to smokeless tobacco compared with cigarette smoking. All tobacco use increased heart rate and blood pressure, with a tendency toward a greater overall cardiovascular effect despite evidence of development of some tolerance to effects of nicotine with use of smokeless tobacco. Relatively low levels of nicotine and lesser cardiovascular responses were observed with use of nicotine gum. Adverse health consequences of smoking that are nicotine related would be expected to present a similar hazard with the use of smokeless tobacco.\r"

Mean theophylline oral clearance decreased 18% and 12% after verapamil and diltiazem, respectively (p less than 0.05). No significant change in theophylline oral clearance was observed after nifedipine. Increases in mean theophylline half-life were observed after verapamil (10.8 +/- 3.2 hours) and diltiazem (9.9 +/- 2.4 hours) (p less than 0.05) but not after nifedipine (8.6 +/- 2.4 hours) when compared with control (8.6 +/- 1.9 hours).

No change in 1-methyluric acid excretion was observed. Increases in urinary elimination of unchanged theophylline were observed after verapamil, diltiazem, and nifedipine. The modest reduction in theophylline clearance observed after verapamil and diltiazem is not likely to produce clinically significant increases in theophylline concentrations in most patients.\r"

  ".U": "88270819\r", 
  ".W": "Disposition of pentopril was studied in 15 male volunteers with varying renal functions. Mild to moderate compromise in renal function did not demonstrate any appreciable changes in plasma concentration of pentopril, the prodrug ester of the active angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor CGS 13934. This is consistent with the known elimination pattern for pentopril, which is eliminated primarily by hydrolysis to the active inhibitor. In contrast, the plasma concentration of the active ACE inhibitor was sensitive to moderate changes in renal function. Because of the reciprocal relationship of AUC and clearance, AUC did not change to any appreciable extent until creatinine clearance (CLCR) dropped to about 50 ml/min. Below 50 ml/min of CLCR, AUC and half-life increased sharply with reduced kidney function. Because of the significant contribution of the renal secretion process to total renal elimination of both pentopril and the active metabolite, prediction of renal clearance from CLCR was poor at relatively normal kidney function (CLCR greater than 80 ml/min). However, renal secretory clearances for both pentopril and metabolite were well correlated to p-aminohippuric acid clearance. In patients with moderately compromised renal function (glomerular filtration rate less than 40 ml/min), tubular secretion rate of creatinine approaches its glomerular filtration rate and hence CLCR could be used as a predictor of renal clearance and other disposition parameters. Plasma ACE activity also demonstrated prolonged inhibition with decreased renal function. Based on the prolonged blockade of plasma ACE activity, some correction in dose or dosing interval is anticipated in patients with moderately compromised renal function (CLCR less than 50 ml/min).\r"

Dose ratios for an increase in mean blood pressure of 10 mm Hg were 3.3 +/- 0.9 for norepinephrine and 3.2 +/- 0.6 for angiotensin II (p not significant).

  ".W": "The ability of cumulative dose-response techniques to obtain accurate data is most likely limited by redistribution and elimination of the drug during the study period. Therefore the usefulness of these techniques would be improved by replacing the amount of drug lost. This hypothesis was assessed for the intermediate-duration neuromuscular blockers vecuronium and atracurium, and calculations were made based on a pharmacokinetic model with an effect compartment. Sixty patients received either single doses (SD) (n = 36), cumulative doses (CD) (n = 12), or CD of vecuronium or atracurium with an infusion (CDI) to replace eliminated or redistributed drug (n = 12). The force of contraction of the adductor pollicis muscle in response to train-of-four stimulation was measured and recorded. Linear regressions were obtained between the logit transformation of neuromuscular blockade at the adductor pollicis and log dose. The potencies obtained with all three methods were within 20% of each other. For vecuronium the ED90 was (mean +/- SE) 0.034 +/- 0.002 (SD), 0.037 +/- 0.003 (CD), and 0.036 +/- 0.003 mg/kg (CDI). For atracurium the ED90 was 0.175 +/- 0.009 (SD), 0.206 +/- 0.019 (CD), and 0.179 +/- 0.015 mg/kg (CDI). Calculated values corresponded well with measured values. The calculations predicted that the agreement between single- and cumulative-dose techniques would be improved if (1) the dose increment was increased, (2) the elimination half-life was increased above 20 minutes, or (3) an infusion was added.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

After oral foscarnet, plasma concentrations were less than 33 mumol/L in four patients; two had occasional concentrations of 35 to 50 mumol/L. The extent of absorption varied between 12% and 22%. During intravenous infusion, plasma concentrations ranged between 75 and 265 mumol/L. The disposition of foscarnet was triphasic, with mean half-lives of 0.45, 3.3, and 18 hours. Excretion data suggested elimination was by tubular secretion and glomerular filtration. Renal clearance was 176 ml/min 1.73 m2. The apparent nonrenal clearance, 40 ml/min 1.73 m2, probably reflects sequestration of foscarnet into bone. Ten percent to 28% of the cumulative dose may have been deposited in bone 2 days after infusion. A slight increase in serum calcium levels and changes in serum phosphate values may reflect the uptake of foscarnet in bone. Five patients had diarrhea (oral) and two had thrombophlebitis (intravenous).\r"

Debrisoquin oxidation was polymorphic, with 25 subjects (6.6%) phenotyped as poor metabolizers whereas 352 subjects (93.4%) were classified as extensive metabolizers. The metabolic ratio between debrisoquin and 4-hydroxydebrisoquin (percent of dose) in 6-hour urine samples ranged from 0.03 in extensive metabolizers to 93.5 in poor metabolizers. The proportion of poor metabolizers found is in the range observed in other white populations studied.\r"

  ".W": "Because oral therapy is often contraindicated in hospitalized patients we assessed the safety and efficacy of continuous intravenous propranolol infusions in nine patients with refractory supraventricular tachycardia. Standard pharmacokinetic formulas predicted a loading dose (52.2 +/- 38.3 micrograms/kg), steady-state plasma concentration, and the initial maintenance dose (16.1 +/- 16.2 micrograms/kg/hr; range 6.1 to 56.0 micrograms/kg/hr) to control heart rate. Subsequent maintenance doses (3.9 to 74.9 micrograms/kg/hr) were determined by clinical response. Heart rate decreased from 146 +/- 22 to 98 +/- 16 beats/min (p less than 0.0001). This decrease persisted throughout the infusion. Measured propranolol levels (28 +/- 21 ng/ml) did not differ significantly from the predicted levels (23 +/- 17 ng/ml). The duration of the infusion averaged 97 +/- 77 hours. A side effect, transient wheezing, occurred in only one patient. This resolved when the infusion rate was decreased. We conclude that continuous propranolol infusions appear safe and effective in treating these patients with supraventricular tachycardia.\r"

  ".W": "Early dysfunction of intestinal anastomoses is sometimes blamed on anastomotic edema. This study compares stapled and hand-sewn anastomoses for the development of early anastomotic edema. After segmental colon resections, one group of dogs was reconstructed with two-layered handsewn anastomoses, and the other group had stapled anastomoses. Controls were untouched small bowel in each operated animal and untouched colon in a separate group of dogs. At 24 hours postoperatively, all animals were given 125I albumin and at 28 hours the animals were killed, venous blood was obtained, and the anastomoses were harvested. Tissue levels of 125I albumin were measured at 1-mm and 1-cm distances from each anastomosis and compared with controls. This quantitative measure of edema was compared with the histologic appearance of the tissue specimens. The results show significant edema formation in both stapled and handsewn anastomoses compared with control tissues (P less than .05 for each animal). Although quantitative and histologic results demonstrate less edema in the stapled group, the difference is not significant by the Wilcoxin rank test. These and similar studies may allow improvement in surgical technique.\r"

  ".W": "Life-long bowel habits of 685 colorectal cancer cases and 723 age/sex frequency matched community controls were investigated as one part of a large, comprehensive, population-based study of colorectal cancer incidence, etiology, and survival, The Melbourne Colorectal Cancer Study. Self-reported chronic constipation was statistically significantly more common in cases than in controls (P = .05). Three or more bowel actions per day were reported by more cases than controls but the total number of respondents in this subset consisted of only ten cases and two controls. Otherwise, the frequency and consistency of bowel motions was similarly distributed among cases and controls. Constipation disappeared as a significant risk when simultaneously adjusted for previously determined dietary risk factors, indicating that it is the diet and not the constipation that is associated with the risk of large-bowel cancer. Additionally, a highly statistically significant association (P = .02) was found with the risk of colorectal cancer in those who reported constipation and also had a high fat intake, a finding consistent with current hypotheses of colorectal carcinogenesis. It is concluded that chronic constipation, diarrhea, and the frequency and consistency of bowel motions, as well as laxative use, are unlikely to be etiologic factors in the development of colorectal cancer. Self-reported chronic constipation is a marginally significant indicator of excess risk of large-bowel cancer and may be used as one of the indices in the screening of individuals for this cancer.\r"

Metachronous cancers were identified in five patients (2 percent). Thirteen of the synchronous cancers were foci of invasive adenocarcinoma in polyps with elements of benign neoplastic tissue. There was a trend for younger patients to have multiple colon cancers. Fifteen percent of the synchronous colon cancer patients were less than 50 years of age. The mean age of patients who presented with metachronous cancer was 54, and 11 years was the average time interval between the diagnosis of the initial and the metachronous tumor. Colonoscopy proved to be more reliable than barium-enema examinations in identifying synchronous cancers. It is concluded from this review that before elective resections, colonoscopy should be used to effectively screen patients for synchronous cancers, and following curative resection, the residual colon should be periodically examined for the remainder of the patient's life.\r"

In women with anterior sphincter defects, combining anoplasty skin closure and deep external sphincter plication gives superior functional results over superficial reefing, especially when there is attenuation of the rectovaginal septum and perineal body. The posterior proctopexy is most useful in patients with intact external sphincters and incontinence without recognizable cause or after abdominal repair of rectal prolapse.\r"

In each colonic site, we recorded two different patterns of spike bursts: Short spike bursts and long spike bursts, as previously described. We observed no difference in either the duration or the amplitude of the two kinds of spike bursts among the three different parts of the colon. Before the meal, the number of long spike bursts was lower in the right than in the left colon (P less than 0.01) and than in the rectosigmoid (P less than 0.01). After the meal, a significant activity increase in long spike bursts lasted 20 min in the right colon (P less than 0.001), 100 min in the left colon, and in the rectosigmoid (P less than 0.001-P less than 0.05). This activity was always significantly less intense in the right colon than in the two other sites (P less than 0.001-P less than 0.01) and was less marked in the left colon than in the rectosigmoid (P 0.01-P less than 0.05). The short spike burst activity remained unchanged. These results provide evidence for the heterogeneity of motility in the different parts of the colon, with a relative hypomotility of the right colon compared to the left colon and the rectosigmoid in the healthy human.\r"

The emptying of solutions of different osmolality and composition from the stomach was measured, while maintaining the intragastric pressure constant with a barostat system that employed an external reservoir. Preliminary experiments showed a linear relationship between intragastric pressure and emptying rate, but indicated that a normal intragastric pressure of 7 cm water would be insufficient by itself to maintain normal emptying. When intragastric pressure was maintained at 20 cm water, an isotonic solution of 30 mM glucose in saline (278 mosm/kg) emptied at a rate of 49.9 +/- 0.5 ml/min (mean +/- SEM, N = 11). Milk (284 mosm/kg) and a hyperosmolar solution of 30 mM glucose in saline (586 mosm/kg) significantly reduced the emptying rate. These results suggest that factors other than the intragastric pressure induced by fundic contraction regulate the rate at which liquids empty from the stomach and that the slower emptying of hyperosmotic solutions or solutions containing fat could be brought about in part either by an increased resistance of the pylorus and possibly the duodenum or a reduction in the effectiveness of an antroduodenal pump.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of renutrition on gastric emptying and upper gastrointestinal symptoms were evaluated in 14 anorexia nervosa patients before and after weight gain. A double-isotope technique was used to measure gastric emptying of both the solid and the liquid phases of the meal. Upper gastrointestinal symptoms were frequent before renutrition, occurring in 78% of the patients. Among these symptoms, nausea, vomiting and gastric fullness were correlated well with slowing in gastric emptying of both solid and liquid phases of the meal, which was demonstrated, respectively, in 10 (71%) and nine (64%) of the 14 patients. For the 11 patients who subsequently gained body weight, we observed, without any pharmacological treatment, an improvement of gastric emptying of both solid and liquid phases of the meal in eight (73%) and seven (64%) patients, respectively. Gastric emptying was unchanged in the three other patients who gained very little weight during the time of the study. As gastric emptying improved, so did nausea, vomiting, and gastric fullness. In three patients who had initially gained weight, nausea and gastric fullness recurred, associated again in all cases with a delay in gastric emptying. In conclusion, in anorexia nervosa, delayed gastric emptying, which is a frequent feature and which is well correlated with some of the upper digestive complaints, can return to normal without any pharmacological treatment. In this improvement, psychological assistance may play a role, together with the correction of the malnutrition.\r"

Male Sprague-Dawley rats were acclimated to 12 hr light alternating with 12 hr darkness. Subgroups of six rats each were killed at 4-hr intervals. Fundic mucosa was collected for measurement of gastrin receptors; serum and antral tissues were collected for measurement of gastrin levels by radioimmunoassay. Circadian periodicity in the data was determined by cosinor analyses. In both freely fed and fasted rats, gastrin receptors showed circadian variation (range 2.5-10 fmol/mg protein), as did serum gastrin concentrations (range in fed rats 195-407 pg/ml). The phasing of the intrinsic circadian variation in gastrin receptor level that was observed in the fasted rats was advanced by a few hours in fed rats. This shift is probably due to food-induced gastrin release, resulting in gastrin-mediated down-regulation of gastrin receptors, followed by up-regulation of gastrin receptors. Food-related effects were thus superimposed upon the intrinsic circadian rhythms in gastrin receptor levels, causing the circadian variation in gastrin receptor levels in the fed rats to be shifted forward compared to that in the fasted rats. No significant circadian rhythms, on the other hand, were found in concentrations of gastrin in the antrum. These results suggest that changes in sensitivity of target tissues to hormones are related to both intrinsic circadian rhythms in levels of hormone receptors and also to food-related changes in hormone-receptor levels mediated by changing serum hormone levels.\r"

HLA-A, -B, and -DR antigens were determined in all the subjects. With the exception of minor abnormalities of suppressor cell activity present in some relatives of two families, neither significant impairments of immunological parameters in patients or their relatives nor concordant segregation of HLA haplotypes and disease were observed. These data indicate that peripheral immune abnormalities previously described in patients with Crohn's disease do not constitute primary factors involved in the disease itself and that familial incidence in Crohn's disease cannot be linked to immunological markers presently studied.\r"

The percentages of monocyte populations in mononuclear cells obtained from the patients with CD were greater than those from the healthy volunteers, but the numbers of PMNs were not different between the two groups. The peak level of phorbol myristate acetate (PMA)-induced CL activity generated by diluted whole blood from the patients with CD was more significantly elevated than that from the healthy volunteers, whereas the peak levels of opsonized zymosan-induced CL activity did not differ between the two groups. In monocytes, the peak levels of both PMA- and opsonized zymosan-induced CL activity were significantly higher in the patients with CD than in the healthy volunteers. CL in PMNs, however, showed no significant difference between CD and controls. It is suggested that monocytes of CD have a large capacity to generate active oxygen species. The present study suggests that excessive active oxygen species released by monocytes and perhaps macrophages may play an important role in formation of the intestinal lesions in CD.\r"

  ".W": "In vitro studies under short-circuited conditions suggest that amiloride, a diuretic agent which is thought to block apical membrane sodium entry, has significant effects on sodium absorption by the human colon. To evaluate this in vivo, we studied the effect of amiloride applied in concentrations of 10(-5) and 10(-4) M on sodium transport and potential difference (PD) in human colon during steady-state perfusion. Net sodium absorption was reduced 25% by amiloride and chloride absorption by 15%; potassium and bicarbonate secretion rates were enhanced. In other studies the colon was divided into a proximal and distal test segment by endoscopic introduction of a collection channel to the descending colon-sigmoid junction. Comparison of tritiated water absorption by the two segments indicated that the distal segment comprised approximately 20% of the total colon surface area. However, the distal test segment only accounted for 5-7% of total sodium, chloride, or water absorption; in contrast, 17-20% of total potassium or bicarbonate secretion occurred there. In the proximal test segment, amiloride reduced net sodium absorption by almost one third from 21.0 to 14.4 mmol/hr (P less than 0.02) but had no significant effect on PD. In the distal test segment, amiloride produced a 25% reduction in mean sodium absorption from 1.2 to 0.9 mmol/hr, but this reduction was not statistically significant; however, potential difference was significantly reduced by 33% (P less than 0.02). These results suggest that most sodium absorption in normal human colon in vivo is mediated by transport processes which are insensitive to these doses of amiloride.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

One minute after the calcium bolus, serum calcium levels increased from 8.7 +/- 0.3 to 14.2 +/- 0.8 mg/dl. Jejunal luminal concentrations of 5HT increased from 135 +/- 21 to 208 +/- 44 ng/ml at the same time; luminal levels peaked at 236 +/- 27 ng/ml at 7 min and slowly returned to baseline. In contrast, portal and systemic venous concentrations did not change after intravenous calcium bolus. The data support the contention that there are independent mechanisms for the release of serotonin into the bowel lumen and the blood stream.\r"

The aim of this study was to compare the ability of two intraluminal recording devices (perfused tube and tube mounted strain gauge) to record colonic motor activity against a reference device (serosal strain gauge). In six anesthetized dogs an intracolonic probe was positioned such that the component perfused tubes and tube mounted strain gauges were approximated to identical strain gauges mounted on the serosa. Contractions were induced by field stimulation and intraarterial injections of acetylcholine and carbachol. While both intraluminal devices demonstrated limitations in the detection of phasic and tonic motor events, perfused tubes detected a significantly greater proportion of tonic and phasic contractions than did strain gauges (P less than 0.001). Intraluminal strain gauges misrepresented 50% of tonic contractions (confirmed visually and by serosal strain gauges) as waveforms with negative polarity. This was not seen in recordings from perfused tubes. Perfused tubes represented tonic contractions as biphasic or bifid waveforms significantly less frequently than strain gauges (P less than 0.05). Radial asymmetry of colonic contractions is likely to account for these observed discrepancies. Recorded motility patterns are influenced by different recording techniques, and these differences are a source of variability in recorded patterns of colonic motor activity.\r"

Of particular interest was a revised scale of family support for performing diabetes self-care behaviors. Across four different aspects of the diabetes regimen, it was consistently found that regimen-specific measures of family support differentiated subjects who were low, medium, or high on adherence better than global family-support scores. Social-environment measures were generally successful in predicting a subject's level of regimen adherence after accounting for variance attributable to demographic factors. The family-support measures were the strongest and most consistent predictors of adherence, but measures of stress and medical-care satisfaction and the interaction between stress and the other social-environment measures also often improved the prediction of a subject's adherence status. These results support the usefulness of measures of the social environment specific to diabetes, and research to investigate other aspects of the social context of regimen adherence is recommended.\r"

A sample of 225 young adults with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus was studied by use of a systematic interview. A measure of the level of control the doctor was attempting to achieve was developed from questionnaires administered to the doctors who provided most of the patient's care during childhood. The results were compared with scores on three indices of psychosocial functioning based on responses given in structured interviews with the patients. Although potentially important psychosocial problems were found for 10-20%, there was no statistically significant relationship between any of these problems and the doctors' desired levels of control. Thus, efforts to achieve good control during childhood, whether successful or not, may not be followed by psychosocial problems in later life. This finding should help support clinicians' attempts to obtain the levels of control during childhood judged to be essential in preventing serious organic complications.\r"

Although these conditions are somewhat different from those recommended for pregnant women (100 g glucose, 3-h OGTT), 3.8% of the women might have been considered to have met O'Sullivan and Mahan criteria for gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) had they been pregnant. Prevalence was 2-3% below age 35 yr, similar to that found in studies of pregnant women, and rose to 8% at age 40-44 yr. Rates of women meeting World Health Organization criteria for gestational impaired glucose tolerance (G-IGT) rose steadily from 5% at age 20-24 yr to 11% at age 40-44 yr. Risk factors for non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) including parental history and obesity were more prevalent among women meeting these criteria than among women in the entire group; the same risk factors are also more prevalent among pregnant women with GDM. The similarity of rates in this study to rates of GDM and G-IGT, together with their association with risk factors for NIDDM, indicate that these entities are compatible with undiagnosed glucose intolerance occurring before pregnancy and discovered during the metabolic testing that generally accompanies prenatal care rather than conditions that have an etiologic relationship to pregnancy.\r"

The blood glucose levels from fasting to 60 min were lower in pregnant subjects, but the 90- and 120-min values were higher. The highest blood glucose values were observed in the first trimester with an apparent improvement in glucose tolerance in the second and third trimesters. This observation is strikingly different from the established pattern of OGTT in pregnant Caucasian women. With pooled data from OGTT results in the three trimesters for the 20 pregnant women (60 OGTTs), a statistically derived criterion (based on mean + 2SD approximated to the nearest 5) for the interpretation of OGTT in pregnant Nigerian women was devised. This criterion defines the upper limits of normal for venous whole-blood glucose in pregnant Nigerian women during an OGTT with a 75-g glucose load as follows: fasting, 90; 30 min, 135; 60 min, 150; 90 min, 145; and 120 min, 125 mg/dl. These values are lower than those recommended for pregnant women by the National Diabetes Data Group (O'Sullivan and Mahan criteria) and the World Health Organization.

Our patient had no pregestational history of retinopathy or hypertension and only minimal proteinuria. Significant improvement in blood glucose levels had been achieved over the 6 mo before conception. Kidney biopsy performed before the termination of pregnancy at 10 wk gestation revealed diabetic nephropathy. No other etiology for her renal disease could be found. An arteriole was noted to have entrapped red blood cell fragments and platelet thrombi, revealing the probable source of her hemolytic process. By 8 wk postpartum, her nephrotic syndrome and hemolysis had completely resolved. At 3 mo postgestation, the patient's hypertension was still present but less severe. Her serum creatinine has continued to decrease toward normal. This is the first report of a woman with IDDM in White's classification C who developed a toxemia-like syndrome during the first trimester of pregnancy, attributable to the underlying diabetic state.\r"

Measurement error in HbA1 and/or glucose-tolerance levels was precluded by HbA1 remaining in the same range over 3.5 yr in 89.7% of 29 individuals with initially high and 68.1% of 22 individuals with initially low (less than 6.5%) HbA1. Rate of deterioration to glucose intolerance (6.9%) in the high group during that period resembled the rate (11.8%) in a control group (n = 279). Fasting plasma glucose significantly accounted for only 2.4% of total HbA1-population variance. No correlation of HbA1 was found with other correlates of glucose tolerance or with daily caloric intake and physical activity. A small but significant increment in HbA1 was associated with smoking (7.1 vs. 6.8%, P less than .01) and with clinically overt atherosclerosis (7.3 vs. 6.9%, P less than .01). We conclude that factors unrelated to glucose metabolism are the main determinants of HbA1 level in normal glucose tolerance and play an important role in diabetes as well. These factors have bearing on evaluation of diabetic control by HbA1 and possibly on risk for diabetic complications.\r"

Thus, it is conceivable that the increased glycosylation of hemoglobin may be secondary to factors other than old age. Furthermore, the data are sparse regarding the effect of aging on glycosylation of other proteins. In this study, glycosylated hemoglobin (GHb), glycosylated protein (GP), glycosylated albumin (GA), and fasting plasma glucose (FPG) concentrations were determined in 93 healthy nondiabetic subjects after an overnight fast. Strict criteria were observed to define the healthy status of these subjects to eliminate the influence of all other factors known to facilitate glycosylation of hemoglobin. No significant correlations were noted between age and FPG, GHb, GP, or GA (P greater than .05 for all correlations). Furthermore, no significant differences were observed between groups according to age for any of the parameters studied. Therefore, this study demonstrates that aging may not influence glycosylation of proteins in healthy subjects, and the previously observed increase in GHb concentrations in elderly populations may be related to associated factors rather than old age.\r"

We measured HbA1 (by electrophoretic and affinity methods), plasma glucose, glycosylated plasma proteins, and fructosamine in blood taken at a single clinic visit. The values were compared both by correlation analysis and by considering whether the various indices of glycemic control placed the patients in the same clinical decision categories as they were in by the HbA1 (affinity) result. Fructosamine correlated moderately well with HbA1 (affinity; r = .8) and placed 71% of IDDM and 72% of NIDDM patients in the same clinical category of good, moderate, or poor control. Differences can probably be partly attributed to the different periods over which HbA1 and fructosamine reflect average glycemia and partly to imprecision.\r"

Usually numerical integration is employed to simulate concentration-time data. By introducing f = concentration (C)/initial concentration (C0), or f = C/steady-state concentration (Css), one can replace C by either fC0 or fCss then obtain time as an explicit solution, by letting f equal an arbitrary series of values such as 0.95, 0.9, . . . 0.05, 0.04, . . . , 0.01 when C0 is involved, or 0.05, 0.10, . . . , 0.95 when Css is involved. This procedure allows data to be simulated with just a pencil and paper, a hand-held calculator, or a microcomputer. The accuracy of the method depends only on the number of decimal places carried during the calculations. The method can provide a series of C, t values where delta C is constant, whereas with numerical integration one obtains a series of C, t values where delta is constant.\r"

We have developed a calculator-based program for our patients with cystic fibrosis and have studied 93 courses of intravenous aminoglycoside treatment, comparing predicted and measured values in 45 courses. Pharmacokinetic parameters differed notably among subjects: this was reflected by widely variable total daily aminoglycoside dosage requirements. The mean daily dosage requirements (+/- SD) for tobramycin (62 treatment courses) was 13.0 +/- 3.74 mg/kg, and for gentamicin (26 treatment courses) was 11.5 +/- 2.6 mg/kg. The accuracy of the program was evaluated by its ability to predict peak and trough values in individuals: 84 percent of measured peaks were within 2 micrograms/ml of the predicted level. Nephrotoxicity was observed in one patient, ototoxicity in three. This program provides a simple, safe, and effective method of tailoring an aminoglycoside regimen to the patient's needs.\r"

Chi-square analysis was performed on 317 responses with overwhelming acceptance (96 percent) of the medication information provided.

Subjects who were elderly, taking cardiovascular medications, or getting refill prescriptions were significantly less likely to change as a result of the information provided. Although 65 percent of the respondents were unwilling to pay an additional fee for the service, females and those who were 45-54 years and over 65 years old were significantly more willing to pay for the information.

The GHB-induced seizure was quantitated in the presence of three other absence seizure models: pentylenetetrazole, systemic penicillin, and the flash evoked afterdischarge (FEAD). Penicillin and pentylenetetrazole produced a significant prolongation of GHB-induced seizure in a dose-dependent fashion. This potentiation of GHB seizure was observed when these compounds were given either before administration of gamma-butyrolactone (GBL), the prodrug of GHB, or at the onset of GHB-induced seizure. Photic stimulation given in a manner to produce FEAD also resulted in a significant prolongation of GHB-induced seizure. All of these maneuvers lowered the threshold to GHB seizure, but none interfered with the brain kinetics of GHB in the animals treated with GBL. Ethosuximide pretreatment significantly shortened the GHB seizure and overcame the potentiating effect of penicillin and pentylenetetrazole in this model. These data confirm the GHB-treated animal as a model of generalized absence seizure. The GHB model meets appropriate criteria for an absence seizure model and compares favorably with other models of absence currently in use.\r"

Threshold doses for the induction of generalized EEG seizures were similar, approximately 26 mg/kg, in all groups, but only in intact cats was this associated with generalized clonic convulsions. In cats with precollicular transection, in spite of an unchanged EEG seizure threshold, induction of convulsions required on average 63 mg/kg of PTZ. They consisted of generalized tonic contractions. In cats with spinal cord transection, convulsions began with a mean dose of 167 mg/kg of PTZ. They consisted of bilateral, frequently asynchronous jerks, although tonic contractions were also observed. These experiments show widespread central nervous system (CNS) sensitivity to PTZ, and demonstrate that (a) ictal EEG activity in the forebrain, normally associated with clonic convulsions, may occur independently from brainstem influence; (b) clonic convulsions in intact cats likely originate from the forebrain with little contribution from the brainstem; and (c) the brainstem and spinal cord can induce tonic and predominantly clonic seizures, respectively, at PTZ levels exceeding those required to induce seizures in intact cats.\r"

To determine whether this area also regulates the spread of amygdala seizures, the irreversible GABA-transaminase blocking agent, GVG (vigabatrin) was infused bilaterally in the deep prepiriform area in amygdala-kindled rats. Twenty-four hours after the infusion, kindled seizure threshold was elevated in 12 of 13 rats tested. If homologous areas exist in the primate brain, treatment strategies that take advantage of critical areas for seizure spread by local infusion of inhibitory agents or transplantation of GABA-containing cells may be developed for suppressing intractable seizures in humans.\r"

Adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH1-39) noncompetitively inhibited specific binding at 5-HT1, 5-HT1A, and 5-HT2 sites in brainstem and neocortex [concentrations required to displace 50% of ligand binding (IC50S) 4-8 X 10(-5) M]. ACTH1-24, ACTH1-17, and ACTH4-10 were sequentially less active, and ACTH34-39 and corticosterone were inactive. D-Ala2, Leu5-enkephalinamide, but not D-Ala2, Met5-enkephalinamide, also displaced spinal and neocortical 5-HT2 sites (IC50 6 X 10(-5) M). Piracetam, glycine, and the clinical antiepileptics valproate, phenacemide, phenytoin, carbamazepine, phenobarbital, diazepam, clonazepam, nitrazepam, and ethosuximide did not displace serotonergic radioligands, but melacimide showed some activity at 5-HT1 sites (IC50 7-9 X 10(-5) M). Anticonvulsant inactivity at 5-HT receptors in vitro correlates with the lack of antimyoclonic activity in 5-HT lesion myoclonic models but not with antimyoclonic efficacy in humans. These data indicate that acute effects of these anticonvulsants cannot be attributed to direct action at the 5-HT receptor recognition site in the rat. In contrast, ACTH showed mild in vitro displacement and regional specificity but only at micromolar concentrations.\r"

Results showed that approximately 39% of CPS begin with motionless staring, 25% with nonfocal discrete movements, 21% with oroalimentary automatisms, 10% with perseverative stereotyped automatisms, and 6% with vocalizations. Nonfocal discrete movements and oroalimentary automatisms were identified as the most common second and third clinical sequential manifestations during a CPS.

Twelve patients had electrographically proven unilateral seizure onset (five left, seven right). Two patients had partial complex seizures and unilateral mesial temporal lobe lesions shown by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Thirteen patients subsequently underwent temporal lobectomy. SpEPs were recorded using the P3 tonal oddball paradigm from sphenoidal electrodes referenced to scalp electrodes (i.e., T3, T4, C3, C4, Cz) and were subjected to spectral analysis for whole band (1-12.6 Hz) power. A significant relationship was found for side of seizure focus and reduced spectral power of the sphenoidal-temporal target SpEPs. In 10 of 14 patients, SpEP spectral power was less from the \"epileptogenic\" than from the \"nonepileptogenic\" temporal lobe. Of the remaining 4 patients, 2 had bilaterally equal spectral power, and 2 had lower SpEP power from the nonepileptogenic side. Postoperatively, all 13 patients are seizure-free except for the 2 patients with reduced SpEP power opposite to the ictal onset and 1 patient with fluctuations in SpEP asymmetries. Spectral analysis of SpEPs appears to have utility in the assessment of temporal lobe dysfunction and thus in the preoperative evaluation for epilepsy surgery.\r"

  ".W": "The advantages and limitations of the two most recent International League Against Epilepsy classifications of the epilepsies and epileptic syndromes have been assessed after examining the clinical records of 645 consecutive outpatients aged 1 month to 15 years followed at the Children's Epilepsy Center of the University of Milan, Italy, from 1977 through 1985. The percentage of cases that could be classified according to the 1970 and 1985 proposals for classification were 94.1 and 98.1%, respectively. According to the 1985 proposal, partial epilepsies (PE) and generalized epilepsies (GE) were almost equally represented (45.0 vs. 47.2%). Among PE, symptomatic epilepsies were the commonest variety. In the group of GE, idiopathic and/or symptomatic epilepsies were most common. Childhood absence epilepsy was the largest subgroup among idiopathic GE. Newly diagnosed patients, a less biased sample of the epileptic population represented 38.9% of the entire sample, and a proper classification was possible in 96% of cases. Idiopathic epilepsies were about twice as frequent and idiopathic and/or symptomatic GE less frequent in newly diagnosed patients when compared with the remainder. Marked differences in the frequency of the epilepsies were found in comparison with other reports in the literature which used the 1970 classification. This finding probably depends on different diagnostic assessment, selection bias, and different geographic and ethnic components, but it can also reflect the variable interpretation of the clinical and EEG features of a patient with epilepsy in the light of the artifactual categories of the classification.\r"

The proportion of pregnancy outcomes terminating in spontaneous abortion, the gestational age-specific rates of spontaneous abortion, and the cumulative risks of spontaneous abortion were determined. The gestational age-adjusted rate ratio for spontaneous abortion of 0.80 (95% confidence interval 0.45-1.40) was not increased for the pregnancies of women with epilepsy compared with those of the wives of men with epilepsy. Among women with epilepsy the rate ratio for in utero exposure to AED exposure was 1.14 (0.52-1.47) and was consistent with no effect of AED on fetal loss. The cumulative risk of spontaneous abortion of 18% for AED exposed pregnancies was also similar to risks reported in nonepilepsy populations. Thus, neither epilepsy nor in utero AED exposure was found to be associated with recognized fetal loss.\r"

  ".W": "To test the idea that the combination of carbamazepine (CBZ) plus stiripentol (STP) is synergistic, an alumina-gel monkey model (N = 4) was used to compare polytherapy electroencephalographic (EEG) effects to those of CBZ monotherapy. The research design included five consecutive phases (2-3 weeks each): baseline, CBZ, CBZ + STP, CBZ, and postdrug baseline. Both drugs were administered in suspension through a chronic gastric catheter every 4 h (to minimize plasma level oscillations). Doses of CBZ were adjusted to maintain CBZ concentration at the same level in the drug periods (except during the initial polytherapy phase, where levels were allowed to increase prior to adjustment). Phased-reversed interictal spikes were manually counted (expressed as a rate per minute). Relative to baseline, CBZ (Cmin = 0.59; Cmax = 2.36 micrograms/ml) increased interictal EEG spikes by an average of 42%. Relative to CBZ monotherapy, the addition of STP (Cmin = 12.02; Cmax = 13.21 micrograms/ml) was associated with an average decrease in spike rate of 39%. This effect was reversible since removal of STP was associated with an increase in spike rate of 66%. The CBZ-epoxide/CBZ ratio decreased from 0.29 to 0.06 when STP was added and increased to 0.30 when STP was removed. The data fit a pharmacodynamic interpretation and suggest that in the case of CBZ + STP the benefits may outweigh the usual disadvantages of polytherapy.\r"

As part of an investigation on the experimental background for antiepileptic drug combinations, the effect of the pharmacodynamic interactions between carbamazepine and phenobarbital on the toxicity/efficacy ratio was studied in mice. All results were expressed in terms of drug concentrations in the brain to exclude possible pharmacokinetic interactions from the analysis. A purely additive interaction was found for the anticonvulsant as well as for the neurotoxic effect of the drugs. The combination of carbamazepine and phenobarbital has therefore no advantage over each drug alone in this model. Based on these and previous results, there is no experimental evidence in favor of any combination between the four main drugs against partial seizures, i.e., carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital, and primidone.\r"

Data from two male subjects who stabilized while they received both PHT and CBZ, with serum concentration fluctuations of less than 20 and 25%, respectively, form the basis of this report. Both patients required a greater than or equal to 20% reduction in PHT dose while receiving 38-40 mg/kg/day of FBM. When FBM was tapered to less than 20 mg/kg/day, a sudden drop in PHT concentrations occurred in both patients. As PHT concentrations rose, CBZ concentrations fell in both patients. The CBZ epoxide to parent ratio increased to 0.46 and 0.39, respectively during FBM treatment. The ratios were 0.18 in both patients when not receiving FBM. CBZ concentrations returned to baseline values after FBM was discontinued. This unusual and unexpected effect of FBM on two standard antiepileptic drugs underscores the need for evaluating pharmacokinetic interactions before major drug trials.\r"

Approximately three-quarters of such patients may expect to go into prolonged remission with currently available drugs, utilised as monotherapy. For chronic epileptic patients, however, the outlook for seizure control is poor. Factors that contribute to the development of chronic epilepsy are partial or multiple seizure types, brain pathology, neuropsychiatric or social handicaps, poor compliance, and the early response to treatment. Evidence is presented that epilepsy should be viewed as a process in which early effective treatment may be important to prevent the evolution of chronic epilepsy, which is so difficult to control.\r"

  ".W": "We evaluated the possibility that impaired insulin-receptor kinase activity contributes to insulin resistance by examining in vitro receptor tyrosine kinase activity and in situ receptor phosphorylation in four models of insulin resistance. Adipocytes from streptozocin-induced nonketotic diabetic (STZ-D), glucocorticoid-treated, fasted, and chronically uremic rats showed reduced basal and maximally insulin-stimulated 2-deoxy-D-glucose transport compared with matched controls. Adipocytes from these models were also resistant to stimulation of hexose transport by hydrogen peroxide, a postbinding insulin mimicker. Changes in the number of insulin receptors per cell could not account for these alterations in transport. Cell surface 125I-labeled insulin binding was 142% of control in STZ-D and 129% with fasting and unchanged in glucocorticoid excess and chronic uremia. Insulin-stimulated tyrosine kinase was measured by means of a synthetic substrate, Glu80Tyr20. Partially purified receptors from these resistant models had unaltered kinase activity when normalized to soluble 125I-insulin binding. In situ stimulation of receptor phosphorylation by 7 and 100 nM insulin was determined after equilibration of adipocytes with 32PO4. Compared with matched controls, these intact cells, from all four resistant models, had insulin-stimulated receptor phosphorylation that was unchanged per unit of cell surface binding. Similar to results with insulin, hydrogen peroxide stimulation of in situ receptor phosphorylation was unchanged in each model. Thus, both in vitro and in situ measures of receptor phosphorylation suggest that the cellular alterations leading to insulin resistance in these adipocytes resides beyond phosphorylation of the insulin receptor.\r"

  ".W": "To determine the contribution of the rate of glucose recycling via the Cori cycle (glucose----3-carbon compounds----glucose) to the higher rate of endogenous glucose production (EGPR) in subjects with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM), we studied eight obese, weight-stabilized diabetic Pima Indians before [93.1 +/- 5.4 kg, 38 +/- 2% body fat, fasting plasma glucose (FPG) 254 +/- 11 mg/dl] and after (87.7 +/- 4.7 kg, 36 +/- 2% body fat, FPG 153 +/- 17 mg/dl) a 5-wk weight-loss diet and eight obese Indians (95.0 +/- 4.2 kg, 36 +/- 2% body fat, FPG 97 +/- 1 mg/dl) with normal glucose tolerance. EGPR and glucose recycling rate were measured during a 4-h primed continuous tracer infusion of [1-13C]glucose, and the rate of reincorporation of 1-13C of glucose into C2-6 positions in glucose was quantified by gas chromatography mass spectrometry. Substrate utilization rates were measured by simultaneous indirect calorimetry. EGPR (corrected for measured rate of recycling) decreased in the diabetic subjects from 3.80 to 2.74 mg.min-1.kg-1 fat-free mass (FFM) (P less than .01) after weight loss, approaching the rate observed in nondiabetic subjects (2.09 mg.min-1.kg-1 FFM).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In random order at 2230 h, they orally received either a sleeping medication alone or with 5.0 mg methscopolamine bromide, an anticholinergic agent. The peak growth hormone (GH) concentrations (ng/ml +/- SE) after sleep were markedly inhibited by methscopolamine (4.7 +/- 2.6 vs. 23.0 +/- 9.2). During the control night, the late (0400-0800 h) glucose response (area under curve but above 0400 h value) was significantly higher (P less than .02) than the early (2400-0400 h) glucose response (area under curve but above 2400 h value). After methscopolamine, the early and late glucose responses were virtually identical. The anticholinergic agent did not affect glucagon levels, overnight urinary catecholamine excretion, or the diurnal cortisol concentrations. The total area under the free fatty acid (FFA) curves was significantly (P less than .05) reduced by methscopolamine. We conclude that sleep-induced GH secretion may cause the dawn phenomenon by increasing FFA levels. Oral administration of methscopolamine at bedtime is a simple pharmacological approach that could test the clinical importance of the dawn phenomenon.\r"

As early as 8-12 days later, the 2-D gels revealed three high-molecular-weight plasma protein spots, which persisted for 150 days in the blood of untreated diabetic rats. Such spots were not seen in plasma of normal control rats. Evidence is presented for the presumptive characterization of these proteins as oligomers of immunoglobulin A (IgA). Specific measurement of total IgA content of diabetic plasma samples by single-radial immunodiffusion, after reduction with dithiothreitol and alkylation with iodoacetamide, reveals that IgA content increases linearly from control values of 11.1 +/- 4.6 to 358 +/- 249 mg/dl (means +/- SE) 21 days after STZ and persists at these high levels for as long as 150 days. Diabetic rats injected daily with insulin showed IgA levels only two to four times higher than normal. Neither experiments designed to quantitate the rates of clearance (catabolism plus excretion) of 125I-labeled secretory IgA from the circulation of normal and diabetic rats nor measurement of total IgA in the bile from diabetic and normal bile fistula rats supports the view that slowed clearance from the circulation or impaired biliary excretion in the diabetic rat causes observed gross hyperimmunoglobulinemia A.\r"

Females were made diabetic by the multiple low-dose procedure. The following matings were set up: SD males with normal (NOR) females; MD males with NOR females; NOR males with MD females; MD males with MD females. Controls were matings of NOR males with NOR females. Among the first cohort of litters was born one female from the cross of an SD male with an NOR female who became spontaneously hyperglycemic at 5 wk of age; the female progeny of this cross had significantly lower body weights. All other progeny groups were normoglycemic (up to 5 wk) and had normal body weights. Test progeny weaned in the second and subsequent cohorts of litters were also normoglycemic. The major effect in this progeny group was on body weight; diabetic fathers (particularly MD males) mated with NOR females produced offspring with significantly higher juvenile body weights than the controls (increase of approximately 0.5 g). These body-weight distributions also appeared more homogeneous than the more variable body-weight distribution of the controls. In contrast, MD mothers (mated with NOR males) produced second-cohort offspring with significantly lower average body weights (decrease of approximately 1-2 g) than the controls.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"
