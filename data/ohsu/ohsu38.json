Of them, 107 had fractures of the second cervical vertebra. In a retrospective review, motor vehicle accidents were found to be the most common mechanism of injury, resulting in 73 (68%) of the 107 axis fractures. All axis fracture types were encountered in this subgroup: hangman's (27%), Odontoid Type II (39%), Odontoid Type III (15%), and miscellaneous fractures (19%). Only one of the 30 patients with complete medical records and detailed information about the accident was wearing a seat belt. Equally remarkable is that 15 of the 30 accidents were single car mishaps, where occupant restraints might theoretically provide the most protection. Sixteen of the 30 patients were thrown from their vehicles, another five were found in the backseat, which leads to the conclusion that a significant of the driving population does not wear seat belts or shoulder restraints. Patients with axis fractures from an automobile accident had a high rate of associated severe head injuries or other cervical spine fractures, three times that of patients with C-2 fractures from other causes. Motorists who are thrown from their vehicles suffer the most severe trauma and have the highest rates of morbidity and mortality. As many as 25% to 40% of individuals who sustain high cervical fractures in motor vehicle accidents die as a result of their injuries.\r"

Functional abilities depended mainly on the level of the original spinal cord injury. Three patients were managed conservatively and have had no significant progression of their neurologic deficit. Six patients were managed with syringoperitoneal or syringosubarachnoid shunts. Pain improved most consistently after surgery. Motor power improved less and sensation least. Ability to perform activities of daily living did not significantly change after surgery. Posttraumatic syringomyelia remains a difficult therapeutic problem in the spinal cord-injured population.\r"

Neurologic signs were present in 23 patients with paraplegia (5 patients) or paraparesis (18 patients); 15 of the latter patients improved and recovered walking capacity. Two types of metastasis were distinguished: corporal metastasis, in which vertebral wedging and posterior protrusion led to neural deficit, with a good prognosis if treated by anterior surgery, and pericordal metastasis in which the cord compression is due to metastatic proliferation into the spinal canal. Results after decompressive surgery, either by posterior or anterior approaches are more doubtful. Surgery is beneficial and should be preferred to radiation when there is medullary compression by corporal metastasis and also in the presence of intense pain or potential instability of the spine.\r"

The problem of determining the location of each pellet with respect to the spinal cord was resolved by the use of biplane radiography in conjunction with an x-ray digitizer and a computer program. This report presents the method for localizing foreign bodies and discusses the results of the procedure. It was concluded that the described method successfully located the position of pellets with respect to the spinal column and cord. This method may be useful for locating metallic fragments that have to be surgically removed in other patients sustaining spinal cord injury secondary to single missile wounds.\r"

Specifically: compression combined with distraction produced the best overall anatomic results, but bilateral compression and bilateral distraction were most effective for reducing flexion--distraction and flexion--axial compression (burst) fractures, respectively; two or more level laminectomies adversely affected reductions; end-plate fractures did not; the best reductions were obtained in flexion--distraction injuries; and the poorest reductions occurred in flexion--axial compression injuries, lumbar fractures, and fractures operated on 6 weeks or more after injury.\r"

  ".W": "In the current study, a nonlinear three-dimensional finite element program has been used to analyze the response of a lumbar L2-3 motion segment subjected to axial torque alone and combined with compression. The analysis accounts both for material and geometric nonlinearities and treats the facet articulation as a general moving-contact problem. The disc nucleus has been considered as an incompressible inviscid fluid and the annulus as a composite of collagenous fibers embedded in a matrix of ground substance. The spinal ligaments have been modeled as a collection of nonlinear axial elements. Effects of loss of intradiscal pressure and removal of the facets on the joint response have been analyzed as well. Torsion is primarily resisted by the articular facets that are in contact and the disc annulus. The ligaments play an insignificant role in this respect. For the intact segment, with an increase in torque, the axis of rotation shifts posteriorly in the disc so that under maximum torque it is located posterior to the disc itself. Loss of disc pressure increases this posterior shift whereas removal of the facets decreases it. Torque, by itself, cannot cause the failure of disc fibers, but can enhance the vulnerability of those fibers located at the posterolateral and posterior locations when the torque acts in combination with other types of loading, such as flexion. The most vulnerable element of the segment in torque is the posterior bony structure.\r"

The results indicate a complex interaction between the thoracic and lumbar regions of the back with the lowest myoelectric activity position of 120 degrees backrest inclination, 5 cm of lumbar support, and 13.5-18.5 degrees of seat inclination. Electromyogramatic (EMG) evidence of fatigue was not identified over a 3.5-hour period. The generally low levels of EMG activity and, presumably, disc pressure present in any seating position suggest that the paraspinal muscle activity may not play the predominant role in disc herniation as it relates to automobile driving.\r"

  ".W": "The current study investigates the stabilizing effects of three different types of spinal fusion to the juxta-free motion segments and to the fused segment of the lumbosacral spine under combined compression-torsion loads. Sixteen fresh human cadaver lumbosacral spines were tested under a simulated physiologic loading condition. The relative movements of the motion segments, as well as the angular rotations and the center of rotation were then computed and analyzed. The average torsional stiffness of the unfused three-motion segment was found to be 2.35 nm/degree. After fusion, the torsional stiffness did not increase significantly. Under the compression-torsional load, the anterior and bilateral-lateral fusions provided adequate stabilizing effect on the fused segment. The posterior fusion provided the least amount of stabilizing effect. These findings are similar to the results of the compression-bending experiment. Whereas the compression-bending loads produced significantly increased stress at the juxta-free segments, the compression-torsional loads did not produce any significant amount of increase in torsional stress at the juxta-free segments.\r"

  ".W": "To investigate the relationship of smoking with the rate of pseudarthrosis (surgical nonunion), 50 patients, who were smokers, and 50 patients, who were not, and who had had a two-level laminectomy and fusion during 1977 and 1978 were randomly selected for this study. Most of those participating had sustained job-related injuries whereas the others had no common etiology for their back dysfunction. Most of the patients were from the southeastern United States. Ages ranged from 23 to 62 years, with a mean age of 42.4 years for smokers and 42.7 years for nonsmokers. There was an equal representation of males and females, with minorities represented according to their general percentage in the population. Examination 1 to 2 years after surgery revealed that 40% (20) of the smokers had developed a pseudarthrosis, whereas among nonsmokers, the rate was 8% (4). This finding appears to be independent of age, sex, or race and was statistically significant (chi 2 = 14.035, P = .001). It was hypothesized that the higher incidence of surgical nonunion among smokers may be related to blood gas levels. Nonsmokers showed no significant deficiencies, whereas smokers showed a mean PO2 level of 78.5% (normal = 95-97) and a mean O2 saturation level of 92.9% (normal = 95 or above). Implications and suggestions for further research are also discussed.\r"

Disc height decreased to 50% at 2 weeks and returned to 80% at 6 months. The biochemistry and histology of the involved-level facet joints were followed at 2 weeks, 6 weeks, 3 months and 6 months after the injection. X-ray study showed a narrowing of the joint space and overlap of the facet joints at 6 weeks and at 3 months. Some return toward normal appearance was noted at 6 months. There was a loss of Safranin-O stain at 6 weeks, which persisted at 3 months, although some cells showed increased Safranin-O staining in the surrounding matrix. This was further improved at 6 months. The water content was unchanged early, but had decreased significantly at 6 weeks. The hexuronic acid content, already dropping at 2 weeks, was significantly lower at 6 weeks, at 3 months, and at 6 months. However, by 6 months, it had increased, compared with the 3-month value. Synthesis of proteoglycan was depressed only at 6 weeks. Similar changes were found in the facet cartilage in the joints above and below the last injected disc level. Results of this study would suggest that there is a cause-and-effect relationship between disc pathology and facet pathology and this can affect adjacent disc facet-joint biology. The initial facet lesion described appears to be potentially reversible, but a long-term disc height decrease might be expected to cause irreversible osteoarthritic-like changes in the adjacent facet joint.\r"

Walk-in patients with mechanical LBP (n = 136) completed the entire SIP at an index visit and again 3 weeks later. The examination of individual items allowed scoring for the derivative scales. The modified Roland Scale appeared to have reliability, validity, and sensitivity that were at least as good as the overall SIP or its major subscales. Although the Roland Scale did not measure psychosocial function well, this aspect of functioning changed less over time than physical function.\r"

Agreement between the two measures in identifying patients as \"not psychologically disturbed\" was good; agreement was far less for patients identified as \"psychologically disturbed.\" At the same time, both measures predicted clinical outcome with an equal degree of accuracy across the measures of outcome, except for \"return-to-work status\" where significant group trends with the BPCS did not reach significance with the Pain Drawing Test. The strong correlation between the two measures in predicting clinically important indexes of improvement suggests that differences in diagnosing the psychologically disturbed does not represent error. The difference may arise because the two scales tap different aspects of psychologic disturbance. Both scales appear to be of clinical value in the early identification of probable treatment failures.\r"

The results of this review indicate an increasing incidence of carcinoma of the pancreas in the second half of the study but also document a large number of patients whose diagnosis has been unsuspected until autopsy. The mortality for palliative bypass procedures dropped significantly in the second half of the study and provided a mean survival time of 7.6 months for this group of patients, approximately twice that of patients explored without palliation. Resectional procedures showed a very significant drop in mortality rate in the second half of the study and were used more extensively. Mean survival time of patients undergoing resectional procedures was 18.3 months with two prolonged survivors out of 22 patients. Significant operative morbidity remains a major problem and the chief cause of protracted postoperative stay and did not diminish in the second half of this study. Complications were primarily technical in nature. With this in mind, consideration should be given to concentrating the experience in pancreatic resectional operations in the hands of a limited number of surgeons within any given community.\r"

The over-all mortality for CDD was ten of 190 patients (5.3 per cent) and three of 56 patients for TDS (5.4 per cent). The over-all major morbidity rate for these procedures was 11.6 per cent for CDD and 21.4 per cent for TDS. This was not a statistically significant difference, but there were more elderly patients (more than 65 years old) in the CDD group (60.5 per cent) than in the TDS group (21.4 per cent) (p less than 0.001). The major morbidity rate associated with elective operations was 10.7 per cent for CDD and 20.0 per cent for TDS which is significant (p less than 0.05). Long term follow-up study (one to 12 years and mean of four and one-half years) revealed six patients in the CDD group with sump syndrome or cholangitis, or both, (3.3 per cent) and three patients in the TDS group had cholangitis develop (5.7 per cent). Over-all, the results compared favorably with the published results of endoscopic sphincterotomy.

Chest pain was present in 59 of 60 patients while external signs of bruising were noted in one-third. The standard anteroposterior (AP) roentgenogram of the chest was diagnostic in all patients. Thirty-four (56.7 per cent) patients had 51 significant noncardiac injuries, an average of 1.5 injuries per patient. Most commonly, these were orthopedic injuries, fractures of the rib and closed head injuries. Sixty-two per cent of the patients with sternal fractures had abnormal electrocardiograms (ECG) at some time, of which 34 per cent had ECG changes consistent with ischemia. The admission ECG was normal in 20 (48 per cent) patients. Three of these patients subsequently had significant ECG changes. Fractures that were comminuted or involved the sternal angle were more likely to be associated with ECG abnormalities than were simple fractures of the sternal body. Only three patients had elevated creatine phosphokinase-myocardial bond fractions. Two dimensional echocardiography and biventricular radionuclide angiocardiography were normal in 11 patients, including five patients with ECG abnormalities. There were no deaths related to the sternal fractures per se or to associated injuries. Sternal fractures result from high energy trauma and should be suspected in patients with chest pain after blunt thoracic trauma. The lateral roentgenogram of the chest is the most useful diagnostic test. There is a high incidence of associated cardiac and noncardiac injuries in these patients mandating close observation with ECG monitoring in the intensive care unit.\r"

Moreover, the \"safe distances\" that have been published for the avoidance of penetration at the L3-L4, L4-L5, and L5-S1 intervertebral levels would have been excessive for 22.2%, 19.4%, and 8.3%, respectively, of the 26 patients in our study.\r"

It differs from the standard approach in that it places emphasis on perivenous microsurgical dissection, identification of the nidus before major arterial feeders, and early ligation of selected venous channels. Three different types of venous drainage--single, multiple, and dual--were identified. Each different type of venous drainage requires a different surgical approach for the best results.\r"

Magnetic resonance imaging revealed signals of increased intensity compatible with old contusions, loss of discrimination between gray and white matter, and irregular brain contours.

Ten of these 40 patients (25%) showed postoperative morbidity, although promptly recoverable in 5. None of the patients whose CCTs did not change following temporary occlusion of major vessels showed any postoperative morbidity, except in one case of anterior cerebral artery aneurysm. In 6 patients, temporary vascular occlusion caused a considerable transient prolongation in CCT of up to 10 msec. Two of these 6 patients were associated with postoperative neurological deficit (which was recoverable in 1). The cortical response became flat in 15 patients. Seven of these 15 patients showed hemispheric deficits postoperatively, although recoverable in 4. There was a correlation between the change in the somatosensory evoked response and postoperative outcome. Disappearance of the N20 potential following occlusion is regarded as a danger signal, but postoperative, irrecoverable neurological deficit seems to be unlikely if its disappearance takes more than 3-4 minutes. Even if the cortical response disappears, the clinical outcome is expected to be good if the N20 potential recovers within 20 minutes after recirculation.\r"

The patient's age was the most likely causative factor in producing the lesion. Six patients required surgical management for the collection: three were for subdural hygroma and three were for chronic subdural hematoma. It is estimated that two factors, multiple craniotomy and younger age, accelerated the formation of symptomatic subdural hygromas. When the patient complains of headache or motor weakness 1 or 2 months after undergoing a craniotomy, one should suspect chronic subdural hematoma, especially in an elderly patient with ruptured aneurysm.\r"

In all specimens extensive ischemic necrosis was present, and Kayexalate crystals were noted in the intestinal lumen. Four of the five patients eventually died. To further investigate the occurrence of colonic necrosis after the administration of Kayexalate in sorbitol enemas, a series of experiments were performed in rats. Two groups of Sprague-Dawley rats were studied. One group was made uremic by performance of bilateral nephrectomy. The other group underwent sham operation. Enemas of saline, Kayexalate alone, sorbitol alone, or Kayexalate in sorbitol were administered. In nonuremic rats, transmural necrosis was noted in seven of 10 rats receiving sorbitol enemas and in six of 10 rats receiving Kayexalate in sorbitol enemas. No significant pathologic changes were noted in the rats receiving other enemas. In uremic rats, extensive transmural necrosis was noted in all rats receiving enemas of sorbitol or Kayexalate in sorbitol.

  ".W": "Cellular proliferation in response to endothelial injury has been examined extensively in experimental animals. Under certain conditions (e.g., hypercholesterolemia and hypertension), this response can be exaggerated and develop into lesions that resemble early atherosclerosis. The injury caused by endarterectomy in human beings and the repair of the arterial wall that ensues may be analogous to the animal models. Presumably, those patients with an exaggerated proliferative response manifest myointimal hyperplasia and recurrent stenosis. To determine potential causes of recurrent stenosis after carotid endarterectomy, we studied 31 patients with early restenosis (group I), 35 patients with later restenosis (group II), and compared them with a control group of 100 consecutive patients who underwent uncomplicated carotid endarterectomy (group III). The known risk factors for atherosclerosis were analyzed. There was no significant difference in the male-to-female ratio, number of cigarettes smoked, or incidence of diabetes mellitus. However, the serum cholesterol level for group I was 282 +/- 57 mg/dl (p less than 0.001 versus controls) while the serum cholesterol level in group II was not significantly elevated over that of the control group. Both groups I and II had a higher incidence of hypertension (p less than 0.005 for both versus controls). There were no differences in the severity of hypertension. The data suggest that hypercholesterolemia has a strong association with early restenosis after carotid endarterectomy but not with late recurrent disease and that hypertension, even when treated, may be associated with both early and late recurrent stenosis.\r"

In other organ systems, circulating leukocytes may serve as one source of oxygen-derived free radical production. The current experiments were designed to evaluate the role of circulating leukocytes in the generation of injury in this model. Four experimental groups of animals were studied: group I consisted of controls (n = 6); group II had white blood cell (WBC) depletion (n = 4) in which the recirculating whole blood perfusate was depleted of 98% of its circulating leukocytes; group III had oleic acid infusion (FFA) alone (n = 9), which induced pancreatitis; group IV had WBC depletion and FFA (n = 6), in which oleic acid was infused after depletion of the circulating leukocytes in the perfusate. During the 4-hour perfusion period, the pancreatic preparations were monitored hourly for the development of edema, weight gain, and release of alpha-amylase into the perfusate. Animals in groups I and group II manifested no gross edema, gained minimal weight, and did not manifest hyperamylasemia. Leukocyte depletion alone had no effect. In group IV animals marked edema, significant weight gain, and hyperamylasemia developed to the same extent as in group III animals. These results demonstrate that circulating leukocytes are not essential to the development of pancreatitis in this model and suggest that another source of oxygen-derived free radicals mediates this injury.\r"

The purpose of this study was to quantitate in vivo glucose absorption by neomucosa and correlate this with neomucosal growth. Thirteen New Zealand White rabbits (2.3 to 3.8 kg) had 2 by 5 cm ileal defects patched with colon serosa, and there was 12 control animals. Glucose absorption was determined by measuring the appearance of radioactivity in the portal vein and vena cava after topical application of [14C]-glucose. At 2 weeks the patched defect is partially covered by a thin layer of columnar epithelial cells. Mature villi are present at 8 weeks. The maximum rate of absorption by neomucosa was significantly greater 8 weeks after patching than at 2 or 4 weeks (0.067 +/- 0.103 versus 0.020 +/- 0.004 and 0.012 +/- 0.003 microCi/min) but was significantly less than normal mucosa (0.264 +/- 0.142 microCi/min, p less than 0.05). Similarly, glucose absorption in the first 20 minutes by neomucosa was greater at 8 weeks than at 2 and 4 weeks (13.0% +/- 6.2% versus 4.7% +/- 0.5% and 6.5% +/- 1.33%, p less than 0.05). Colon serosa also absorbed significant glucose. Neomucosa absorbs glucose in vivo. The rate and amount of absorption correlate with neomucosal growth. Significant glucose absorption by colon serosa has implications for the transperitoneal delivery of nutrients.\r"

A \"clinically significant change\" (CSC) in CORRP and CO was defined as a change that exceeded two standard deviations from the mean of five baseline measurements made before the onset of hemorrhage, whereas a CSC in PWP or CVP was conservatively defined as a change that exceeded 2 mm Hg from the average of five baseline measurements, and a CSC in PAP and AP was defined as a change that exceeded 3 mm Hg and 5 mm Hg, respectively from the average of the baseline measurements. There was no consistent change in heart rate during hemorrhage. Thus defined, a CSC in CORRP occurred after an average extraction of 9.2% +/- 4.7% TBV, whereas a CSC was not seen until an average loss of 16.5% +/- 8.1% TBV for AP, 21% +/- 13% TBV for PWP, 15.5% +/- 7% TBV for PAP, and 35% +/- 3% TBV for CVP. These average blood losses are all significantly different from the average blood loss required to effect a CSC in CORRP. The blood loss required to effect a CSC in CO averaged 9.7% +/- 6%. We conclude that in these anesthetized dogs, CORRP detected blood loss earlier than other commonly used hemodynamic parameters, including several invasive parameters such as CVP, PAP, and PWP; CORRP and CO were equivalent in their ability to detect early stages of blood loss.\r"

The purpose of this study was to develop a model of CyA nephrotoxicity in the isolated perfused rat kidney and to evaluate the effects of adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-MgCl2 and verapamil treatment on this model. Kidneys were perfused for 90 minutes in a 7.5% albumin-Krebs-HCO3 solution containing 3H-inulin (glomerular marker) and 5.0 micrograms/ml 14C-cytochrome C (cyt) (marker of tubular protein absorption). After 10-minute equilibration, perfusate and urine samples were collected with 10-minute clearance periods. After two control clearance periods, 500 ng/ml CyA was added to the perfusate. In some experiments, 1 micrograms/ml of verapamil was added 10 minutes before CyA and in others 2 mmol/l ATP-MgCl2 was added with CyA. Cyt and inulin radioactivity, [Na+] and [K+], were measured in perfusate and urine. Tissue ATP levels were also determined. The results demonstrate that CyA treatment leads to a marked depression of glomerular filtration rate (GFR), tubular absorption of protein, urine output, and renal flow. ATP-MgCl2 cotreatment improved GFR, tubular absorption, and renal perfusate flow but the increase in urine output was not dramatic. Verapamil pretreatment markedly improved GFR and urine and renal perfusate flow but not tubular function. The combination of verapamil and ATP-MgCl2 treatment with CyA returned GFR to control values, significantly improved tubular absorption, urine and renal perfusate flow, and enhanced renal tissue ATP of isolated kidneys to levels seen in vivo. These data lead us to conclude that ATP-MgCl2 cotreatment with CyA after verapamil pretreatment greatly reduces the nephrotoxic potential of this immunosuppressive agent.\r"

Although axillofemoral bypass is possible in these patients, the decreased patency rate associated with this operation makes alternate procedures desirable. This report details our experience with prosthetic bypass from the supraceliac aorta to the femoral arteries in seven patients with limb-threatening ischemia of the lower extremity, all of whom had undergone multiple previous aortic operations. The operations were performed through thoracoabdominal or flank incision, and the preferred graft configuration consisted of a single Dacron tube from the aorta to the left groin with a standard subcutaneous femorofemoral graft to the right groin. No surgical deaths occurred. At 3 1/2 years' mean follow-up, there has been one graft limb occlusion that resulted in amputation for an overall life table patency and limb salvage rate of 93%. We conclude that supraceliac to femoral artery bypass is a useful procedure for the treatment of patients who have had multiple previous aortic reconstructions fail.\r"

  ".W": "This retrospective study evaluated quantification of skin fluorescein delivery by fiberoptic fluorometry as a means of predicting the healing potential of an amputation site. Fluorometry uses a dual-channel fiberoptic light guide--one channel transmits blue light to excite the fluorescein in the skin under study, and the other transmits emitted fluorescence from the skin to a photomultiplier tube where it is measured. Ten minutes after intravenous administration of sodium fluorescein (4 to 8 mg/kg), fluorometric readings were obtained at more than 100 reading sites. In the 86 cases without preoperative cellulitis at the site of amputation, preoperative fluorometry clearly distinguished between healing and nonhealing sites. Healing sites averaged 79% of the fluorescence of a healthy reference area (dye fluorescence index [DFI] = 79), while failing sites averaged only 27% (p less than 0.01 by ANOVA). In all but one case where the DFI was greater than 42, the amputation healed. In all cases where the DFI was less than 38, the amputation failed. In general, uncertainty was limited to sites with values between these limits. The technique maintained its high accuracy in patients with diabetes and for distal amputations. However, it was not accurate at sites of active cellulitis (12 cases). There were no significant adverse effects from the slow injection of the low dose of fluorescein used for this technique. We conclude that fluorometry is an effective means of predicting healing in patients undergoing amputation.\r"

  ".W": "Oxygen-derived free radicals play an important role in the pathogenesis of experimental acute pancreatitis in the isolated perfused canine pancreas. We have previously found that pretreatment with allopurinol inhibits xanthine oxidase--apparently the primary source of free radical generation in this model--and prevents the initial development of pancreatitis. In these experiments, we evaluated whether allopurinol administered after the onset of pancreatitis would arrest the progression of the disease process. Edema formation, weight gain, and the release of amylase activity into the perfusate in the ex vivo perfused canine pancreas model were monitored during a 4-hour perfusion period. There were six experimental groups: Group I (control) received no treatment, group II (allopurinol alone) received only allopurinol (100 mg) at the start of perfusion, and groups III through VI were each given an infusion of 0.3 ml of oleic acid (FFA) over a 1-hour period to initiate acute pancreatitis. Group III (FFA alone) received no other treatment. In group IV (pretreatment with allopurinol), group V (concurrent treatment with allopurinol), and group VI (posttreatment with allopurinol), allopurinol (100 mg) was administered 1 hour before, concurrent with, or at the end of the FFA infusion, respectively. Pretreatment with allopurinol prevented edema formation, markedly attenuated weight gain, and the release of amylase caused by the FFA infusion. Administration of allopurinol concurrent with the FFA infusion provided only partial protection, whereas posttreatment with allopurinol failed to arrest the progression of the injury process. Therefore, the use of allopurinol to inhibit oxygen-derived free radical production from xanthine oxidase prevented the development of acute pancreatitis in this model; however, treatment with allopurinol after initiation of the disease process failed to arrest the progression of acute pancreatitis.\r"

  ".W": "A prospective study of the improvement in leg muscle pump function after radical surgery was performed for treatment of varicose veins. Venous muscle pump function was assessed in 21 patients with primary varicose veins by means of ambulatory strain gauge plethysmography immediately before surgery and 3 months and 60 months after surgical treatment of varicose veins. The physiologic documentation of the operative efficacy was provided by the mean venous reflux, which was reduced by 54% (p less than 0.001), and the mean expelled volume, which was increased by 58% (p less than 0.001). Initially, all patients had improved venous muscle pump function. This improvement was still present 60 months after surgery. At clinical assessment 3 months after surgery, it was noted that 90% of the patients were without residual varicose veins (p less than 0.01). Sixty months after surgery, 71% of the patients were without apparent varicose veins (p less than 0.05). Subjective symptoms had virtually disappeared 3 months after surgery (p less than 0.001) but were found to a variable extent in 80% of the patients at the 60-month control follow-up. It is concluded that ambulatory strain gauge plethysmography may quantitate the effect of surgery in patients with venous valvular incompetence; in addition to measurements of refilling time, it is able to measure the muscle-pump-generated expelled volume because of in-place electrical calibration.\r"

This suggests a profound psychosocial disturbance in a patient unlikely to benefit from surgery. These findings justify recommending other approaches to the management of patients with chronic pancreatitis who are likely to continue to drink, particularly when there is a history of significant narcotic abuse.\r"

This nomenclature is based on its clinical and pathophysiologic features. The anatomically \"high\" gastric ulcer has an incidence of 27.4%; its main features include a frequent association with the type O blood group; a low basal and stimulated acid output, a high incidence of upper gastrointestinal bleeding, a slower emptying of fluids, and a high percentage of deep penetrating ulcer.\r"

Over a two year period all deaths in the Auckland population possibly due to asthma, in people less than 60 years of age, were investigated. From the 47 people who died from asthma 44 who had useful reversibility of airways obstruction (records showing greater than 20% variability of peak flow or a history indicating equivalent variability of shortness of breath) before death were selected as cases for the study. Both hospital and community based controls were used. The cases were more likely than were the community controls to have had severe disease, a hospital admission or visits to a hospital emergency department in the previous year (odds ratios 4.4, 16.0, 8.5 respectively). The asthmatic patients who died were more likely than either group of controls to have had a previous life threatening asthma attack. Poor management of the disease and poor compliance on the part of the patient increased the risk of death. In addition, use of three or more types of asthma drug within the past year was associated with an increased risk of dying that was independent of disease severity. Of interest was a similarity between asthmatic patients admitted to hospital and those who died. Nevertheless, a history of a previous life threatening attack and a recent admission to hospital identified a group at high risk.\r"

Patients with chronic obstructive lung disease reported more difficulty in getting to sleep and staying asleep and more daytime sleepiness than the control group. More than twice as many patients (28%) as controls (10%) reported regular use of hypnotics. In a subgroup of 16 patients with chronic obstructive lung disease (mean FEV1 0.88 (SD 0.44) sleep, breathing, and oxygenation were measured to examine the relationship between night time hypoxaemia and sleep quality. Sleep architecture was disturbed in most patients, arousals occurring from three to 46 times an hour (mean 15 (SD 14)/h). Arterial hypoxaemia during sleep was common and frequently severe. The mean (SD) arterial oxygen saturation (SaO2) at the onset of sleep was 91% (7%). Nine patients spent at least 40% of cumulative sleeping time at an SaO2 of less than 90% and six of these patients spent 90% of sleeping time below this level. Only four of 15 patients did not develop arterial desaturation during sleep. The mean minimum SaO2 during episodes of desaturation was less in rapid eye movement (REM) sleep (72% (17%)) than in non-REM sleep (78% (10%), p less than 0.05). The predominant breathing abnormality associated with desaturation was hypoventilation; only one patient had obstructive sleep apnoea. Arousals were related to oxygenation during sleep such that the poorer a patient's arterial oxygenation throughout the night the more disturbed his sleep (arousals/h v SaO2 at or below which 40% of the total sleep time was spent: r = 0.71, p less than 0.01). Hypoxaemia during sleep was related to waking values of SaO2 and PaCO2 but not to other daytime measures of lung function.\r"

After computed tomography scan two groups of patients could be identified. Twenty patients had generalised emphysema, which was locally worse in the area of the suspected bulla; and 23 had well defined bullae, which were potentially operable. Results of lung function tests did not distinguish between the two groups. The volume and ventilation of the true bullae were measured by computed tomography and this confirmed that most of them did not contribute to ventilation (residual volume (RV)/total capacity (TLC) bulla = 89% (SD 10%). The patients with true bullae were considered suitable for surgery but only 12 had an operation. All the patients who underwent surgery survived and had a symptomatic improvement, which was accompanied by objective increases in spirometric volumes and by reductions in static lung volumes; there were no improvements in carbon monoxide transfer or blood gas tensions. It is concluded that computed tomography used alone can identify bullae that are amen-able to surgery and can measure their volume and ventilation. The surgical removal of such clearly identified bullae is safe and associated with symptomatic and functional improvement even when the preoperative FEV1 is less than 1 litre. This improvement is likely to be a consequence of reduction in lung volume and may not necessarily be associated with relief of compressed peribullous lung or the removal of dead space.\r"

  ".W": "A retrospective analysis was carried out on a consecutive series of 181 percutaneous fine needle aspiration biopsies of discrete pulmonary lesions, in which the outcome was established in 95%. In primary bronchial carcinoma the technique had a sensitivity of 86%. There was no relationship between the size, location, or radiological appearance of the lesion and the incidence of false negative results. The principal reason for failure to diagnose malignancy was inadequacy of the material provided for cytological examination. For metastatic neoplasms of non-bronchial origin the procedure had a sensitivity of 42% and a significantly greater false negative rate than for primary bronchial malignancy. For the entire series 72 (40%) of the procedures failed to produce a definite diagnosis, 29 (40%) of these cases subsequently proving to be malignant. A positive diagnosis was established in only 16% of patients with benign conditions. Review of published reports and consideration of the role of this and other biopsy techniques in the investigation of discrete pulmonary lesions lead to the conclusion that needle aspiration biopsy seems particularly appropriate in the investigation of inoperable patients with probable bronchial carcinoma in whom sputum cytology and bronchoscopy do not yield a diagnosis.\r"

The chylothoraces occurred as a complication of cardiothoracic surgery in 11 patients, of whom eight were children in the first decade of life. Five cases followed operations for coarctation of the aorta and two occurred as a complication of a Blalock shunt for Fallot's tetralogy. The chylothorax was evident within 48 hours of the operation in all but two patients. In seven cases a second operation was performed to prevent further chylous leakage and in two infants the thoracic duct was ligated. The remainder of the postsurgical chylothoraces responded to either continuous drainage or repeated aspiration and a low fat diet. There were no late sequelae of chylothorax following surgery. Spontaneous chylothorax was identified in seven patients and in five of these it was bilateral. Patients with spontaneous chylothorax were all adults and, despite treatment, had a poor prognosis. Three with malignant disease and two with pulmonary lymphangioleiomyomatosis had died within two years of the appearance of the chylothorax. Two patients with chronic idiopathic chylothoraces survived for more than two years and one of these developed a secondary fibrothorax.\r"

A total of 10,084 pretransfusion blood samples from approximately 6000 patients were tested.

The routine techniques detected 147 of the 157 alloantibodies. The P-AHG method detected only 36 percent of the alloantibodies for which crossmatch-compatible blood is routinely provided without determination of the antigen status of the donor unit's red cells (e.g., anti-Lea), whereas the routine method detected 91 percent of such antibodies. Eighty-six percent of the 189 alloantibodies detected by the Polybrene technique were found before the addition of antiglobulin. The manual Polybrene test is a rapid and sensitive technique; it may be used without an antiglobulin phase as a routine crossmatch procedure when accompanied by a sensitive antibody detection test that includes antiglobulin and an additional test to ensure ABO compatibility.\r"

Immediately after a brief period of intense exercise, there was a significant increase in the absolute number of blood CFU-GM from 164 +/- 27 to 240 +/- 46 per ml. However, all values returned to baseline within 15 minutes. Prolonging the exercise did not enhance either the circulating CFU-GM concentration or the duration of the rise. If blood hematopoietic stem cells respond to exercise similarly, such a transient increase would not appear to be of use in stem cell harvesting.\r"

This study attempted to determine whether lymphocyte contamination could be reduced by rapidly depleting plasma from the separation chamber at selected intervals during plateletapheresis with a blood cell separator (CS-3000, Fenwal). Donors who provided platelet components with more than 0.10 X 10(9) lymphocytes without rapid depletion underwent a second plateletapheresis procedure in which the rapid depletion technique was used. The plasma pump was reprogrammed to remove rapidly 12 ml of plasma from the separation chamber (pump speed 48 ml/min) immediately after the plasma pump reversal. All other collection techniques were identical for all procedures. Significantly fewer lymphocytes were collected in those procedures in which rapid depletion was used (mean, 0.187 X 10(9] than when it was not used (mean, 0.331 X 10(9] (p = 0.001, n = 30). There was no effect on platelet yield, efficiency of platelet collection, processing time, or total collection time. This procedure provides a product that should be considered for routine use.\r"

The tab is clamped before transfusion. Varying numbers of platelet concentrates (PC) that had been stored for different durations were pooled and centrifuged in the bags. When 4 or more units of PC were studied, the results were independent of the number of units and the duration of storage. Approximately 90 percent of the contaminating leukocytes (WBC) were removed with a platelet loss of less than 10 percent. Similar results were obtained with single-donor platelets (WBCs decreased 93%; range, 77-99%; n = 12). Posttransfusion increments were similar to those with unmodified platelets; in four patients, febrile platelet transfusion reactions were eliminated by the WBC removal. Thus, the bags represent a simple, reproducible, and effective means of reducing WBC and red cell contamination of platelet preparations with acceptable platelet losses.\r"

The cell counts, mean cell volumes, morphologic changes, phagocytosis, and bactericidal activity of the stored granulocytes did not differ significantly. However, chemotaxis was maintained better in granulocytes that were agitated. At 48 hours, the ability of unagitated cells to adhere to both immunoglobulin-coated and uncoated glass surfaces increased, and clumps were observed on the surfaces. These results seem to be related to the decrease in chemotaxis. The pH of unagitated sedimented cells was more acid. To avoid the decrease of this local pH, stored granulocytes need gentle agitation.\r"

Intracellular H2O2 production in response to stimulation with phorbol myristate acetate was not affected by neutrophil irradiation at doses up to 2500 rad. In addition, irradiation of intracellular DCFH and aqueous 2'-7'-dichlorofluorescein diacetate (DCFH-DA) resulted in DCF production, which suggested that oxidative molecules produced by aqueous radiolysis were detected by this assay. This study indicates that radiation doses of 1500 to 2500 rad, which are sufficient to prevent induction of graft-versus-host disease by transfused blood components, are not deleterious to neutrophil oxidative metabolism.\r"

A control chimpanzee was inoculated with the part of the factor IX/HBV preparation that had not been chromatographed. The two chimpanzees that received the treated material remained free of any serologic or biochemical evidence of hepatitis B infection during a 12-month follow-up, whereas the control chimpanzee had hepatitis B. After a later HBV challenge, the two healthy animals also had hepatitis B. The hydrophobic binding procedure seems to be useful for the adsorption of viral agents in blood components.\r"

Two laboratories conducted the studies independently. After 42 days of storage, hemolysis was within an acceptable range (0.72 +/- 0.4% and 1 +/- 0.2%), ATP decreased to 61 percent and 56 percent in the two laboratories, and 24-hour survivals were 85.1 +/- 8.3 percent for single-label cells in one laboratory and 82.8 +/- 10 percent (single-label cells) and 84.1 +/- 13.1 percent (double-label cells) in the second laboratory. Thus, results for single- and double-label cells were similar. After 49 days of storage, ATP fell to 45 and 46 percent in the two laboratories. Twenty-four-hour recovery fell to 69.4 +/- 7.4 percent with single-label cells and to 68.2 +/- 6.7 percent with double-label cells in one laboratory. In the other laboratory, a paired study comparing AS-3 with the already approved AS-1 solution (Adsol; Fenwal Laboratories, Deerfield, IL) showed nearly identical 24-hour survivals of 71.9 +/- 8.8 percent in Nutricel and 71.8 +/- 6.5 percent in Adsol. These studies demonstrate the excellent viability of the new solution after 42 days of study. At 49 days of study, viability decreased significantly and was comparable in the two nutrient-additive solutions studied. The value of paired comparison study is demonstrated by the latter results.\r"

In the absence of exogenous activators, only syngeneic macrophages can become sufficiently activated, to produce lymphocyte attractants. Allogeneic macrophages require exogenous activation to accomplish lymphocyte recruitment. It is likely that graft rejection is initiated by a nonspecific inflammatory reaction within the graft. Once host macrophages have entered the graft they may be activated by the inflammatory process to produce lymphocyte attractants. As lymphocytes are called to the graft, those recognizing donor determinants may expand to effect graft loss.\r"

CsA uptake was temperature dependent but was not altered by replacement of uptake medium Na with K or mannitol, changes in extracellular pH, and the presence of metabolic inhibitors or organic anions and cations. The organic Ca channel blockers verapamil and diltiazem and the inorganic Ca channel blocker cadmium caused significant inhibition in both Ca and CsA uptake by PTC. Other Ca transport modulators, ruthenium red and trifluoroperazine, decreased PTC Ca uptake, and A23187 increased PTC Ca uptake, but they were all without effect on CsA uptake. We propose that the CsA uptake pathway through PTC is situated at or close to Ca channels so that changes induced by Ca channel blockers also affect transit of CsA through the CsA \"passageway.\" The close spatial relationship between CsA and Ca channels also raises the possibility that CsA uptake may intiate Ca channel-related activities, thereby leading to a cascade of Ca-dependent processes and causing nephrotoxicity. A hypothesis is depicted in Fig 1.\r"

The desired goal then is to stimulate the black community to: have annual blood pressure checks so that an early diagnosis of high blood pressure (hypertension) can be made and early treatment can be received; and become better informed about the \"Gift of Life\" concept and have family meetings in which donating organs after death is strongly considered. The adoption of these recommendations will likely result in a decrease in the incidence of renal disease, since the leading cause of renal disease in blacks is hypertension. This silent unrecognized killer produces renal failure in blacks 17 times more often than in whites. We expect that increasing the number of black organ donors will result in an improved success rate in black recipients of transplants from recently decreased persons. It is clear that the black community can play a major role in elucidating and, perhaps, eradicating this serious medical problem.\r"

The mean operative time, mean blood loss, and incidences of early postoperative complications and incontinence were less for patients treated with the Walsh technique than with the Campbell technique. After surgery 85 per cent of evaluable patients remained potent with the Walsh technique compared with 16 per cent of patients treated with the Campbell technique. Although other factors besides operative approach may have biased our results, we are persuaded that the innovations of radical retropubic prostatectomy detailed by Walsh constitute important advances in surgical technique, and we now use this procedure in all suitable patients electing treatment by radical prostatectomy for localized prostatic cancer.\r"

The results indicate a fair degree of consistency between the Snap-Gauge and CCT measurements. The Snap-Gauge and NPT findings were less consistent. The results suggest that the Snap-Gauge is a reliable and useful screening device for assessing impotent patients. However, it is not an adequate substitute for a more complete NPT monitoring with polysomnographic recording.\r"

During the postoperative period none of the injected group of patients required blood transfusion whereas 6 patients in the noninjected group needed transfusion (12%). It is concluded that injection of prostate preoperatively has the significant advantage of minimizing blood loss, and therefore preoperative ABO-Rh typing and antibody screen will suffice when the prostate is injected with phenol.\r"

None of the previously reported cases, however, described a discrete papillary intraluminal tumor in which there was no direct extension outside the ureteral wall. In addition, small foci of tumor were within intraluminal lymphatics as well as within the ureterovesical resection margin. These findings together with immunoperoxidase results confirm the unusual behavior and presentation of metastatic prostate carcinoma involving the ureter. Later a bladder tumor developed and histology again revealed metastatic prostate carcinoma.\r"

Detailed analysis demonstrated no significant change comparing the pre- and postoperative cystometry findings, uroflow parameters, maximal voiding pressure, urethral resistance, maximal urethral closure pressure, or functional urethral length. The only significant change identified as a result of the surgical procedure was an alteration of proximal urethral pressure transmission during stress from negative to positive gradients. It is concluded that the modified Pereyra bladder neck suspension restores continence by restoring proper urethral support with restoration of positive pressure transmission to the proximal urethra without causing outflow obstruction, changing functional length, or altering maximal urethral closure pressure.\r"

  ".U": "87153005\r", 
  ".W": "Although many mechanisms have been proposed to explain systolic anterior motion (SAM) of the mitral valve in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, the precise mechanism of its onset and cessation remain undefined. The Venturi theory, based on increased flow velocity in a narrowed outflow tract, is widely accepted but fails to explain several important characteristics of SAM. It also neglects the potential role of drag forces generated by interposition of the leaflets into the path of ejection and of factors that would decrease the effectiveness of papillary muscle restraint. In order to obtain further insight into the mechanism of SAM, a detailed geometric study of the left ventricle and mitral apparatus was performed with cross-sectional echocardiography in three equal-sized groups of patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and SAM, patients with hypertrophy and no anterior motion, and normal control subjects. A salient finding was that SAM began prior to ejection in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, which cannot be explained by the Venturi theory. Further, SAM began and was most prominent in the central portion of the leaflet as opposed to its lateral edges; this finding is not predicted by the Venturi mechanism. In addition to outflow tract narrowing, other structural changes unique to patients with SAM included anterior and inward displacement of the papillary muscles, anterior displacement of the mitral leaflets, and elongation of the mitral leaflets, which were, on the average, 1.5 to 1.7 cm longer than in the other subjects (p less than 0.0001). On the basis of these observations, an integrated mechanism for the initiation and resolution of SAM is proposed that would explain observed features such as onset before ejection and central prominence. This mechanism combines the effects of outflow tract narrowing with those of papillary muscle displacement. In particular, anterior and inward displacement of the papillary muscles can be predicted to alter the effectiveness of chordal support so that the central leaflet portions become relatively slack and are more readily displaced anteriorly. The altered distribution of chordal tension can also be predicted to orient the distal leaflets upward into the outflow tract at the onset of systole, prior to aortic valve opening, so that ventricular ejection will actually drag the interposed leaflets anteriorly. The resolution of SAM can be understood in terms of a reverse Venturi effect created by mitral regurgitation, as well as continued traction of the centrally displaced papillary muscles on the lateral leaflet margins.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "This study was performed to determine the sensitivity of thallium imaging vs ECG monitoring for detecting coronary artery spasm noninvasively following intravenous ergonovine administration as compared to simultaneous coronary angiography. Thirty-two patients with insignificant coronary artery disease and chest pain underwent 12-lead ECG monitoring, thallium imaging, and coronary arteriography following the administration of 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, and 0.3 mg of ergonovine given 5 minutes apart or until chest pain occurred. One minute following the last dose of ergonovine, 2.5 mCi of thallium-201 was injected intravenously, and a final ECG was recorded and repeat coronary arteriography performed. Within 10 minutes following the injection of thallium, imaging was performed in the 40-degree and 70-degree left anterior oblique and anterior projections. The ECG, thallium study, and coronary arteriogram were read blindly and results were compared. The ECG, angiogram, and thallium study were read as positive if the following occurred, respectively: greater than or equal to 1 mm ST segment elevation, depression, or T wave reversal; greater than 50% vessel narrowing,; and reversible perfusion defect. Five patients were excluded from analysis because of either catheter-induced spasm, suboptimal thallium studies, or protocol violations. Of the 27 patients included for analysis, six had chest pain, five had a positive angiogram, five had a positive thallium study, and one had a positive ECG. The sensitivity of thallium vs ECG monitoring was 80% vs 25%, and the accuracy was 92% vs 80%. We conclude that thallium imaging greatly increases the noninvasive detection of ergonovine-induced coronary spasm as compared with the ECG with no loss of accuracy.\r"

FPA measurements and clinical examinations in patients were performed every 2 weeks. In control subjects blood sampling was performed every 4 weeks. Data from 28 patients who completed the study and from the 15 control subjects were analyzed. The clinical activity of angina was divided into three classes (asymptomatic, mildly symptomatic, and severely symptomatic) on the basis of the number and time-concentration of the ischemic attacks and ECG changes during the 15 days preceding each clinical examination. In all but one patient, a cyclic pattern of activity of coronary artery disease was observed. During follow-up studies, 624 FPA measurements were performed in patients and 173 in control subjects. Mean values were 4.68 +/- 4.53 and 1.32 +/- 0.60 ng/ml, respectively (p less than 0.001). FPA levels differed markedly in relation to the activity of angina. A relationship between FPA levels and activity of disease (r = 0.54, p less than 0.01) was found in time course. Bolus heparin administration (100 IU/kg) during the active phase of angina sharply but incompletely lowered FPA plasma levels, indicating thrombin formation both intravascularly and extravascularly. Present results indicate that a marked blood clotting activation occurs simultaneously with the outbursts of clinical activity of spontaneous angina.\r"

To determine if \"remote\" myocardial ischemia also occurred in the anterior bed after circumflex occlusion, myocardial blood flow (radiolabeled microspheres) and hemodynamics were measured before and after circumflex occlusion in the presence of a stenosed left anterior descending artery (gradient: 28 +/- 2 mm Hg) in 10 open-chest dogs. Aortic pressure fell from 108 +/- 3 to 100 +/- 3 mm Hg (p = 0.02) and mean distal left anterior descending coronary artery pressure fell from 81 +/- 4 to 69 +/- 5 mm Hg (p = 0.02) after circumflex occlusion. Transmural flow to normal myocardium supplied by unstenosed and unoccluded coronary arteries increased from 0.69 +/- 0.04 to 0.84 +/- 0.04 ml/min/gm (p less than 0.0001) after circumflex occlusion. Although epicardial flow to the remote anterior bed supplied by the stenosed left anterior descending coronary artery increased after left circumflex occlusion (0.61 +/- 0.03 to 0.73 +/- 0.04 ml/min/gm, p = 0.004), remote anterior bed endocardial flow did not increase, and the remote bed endocardial:epicardial blood flow ratio decreased from 0.98 +/- 0.06 to 0.78 +/- 0.10 (p less than 0.05). Therefore, in this model, remote anterior bed ischemia, relative to the normal myocardial flow response, developed when the left circumflex coronary artery was occluded in the presence of the stenosed left anterior descending coronary artery.\r"

Patients with coronary artery spasm did not have significant organic lesions at the site of spasm. All patients with organic coronary artery disease and coronary artery spasm had a history of angina pectoris without myocardial infarction. No significant differences in ejection fraction were observed among the three groups. The regional ejection change of the anterolateral and apical wall supplied by the left anterior descending coronary artery was significantly decreased in patients with organic coronary artery disease compared with those in normal subjects (anterolateral 39.5 +/- 10.3% vs 48.4 +/- 7.7%, p less than 0.05; apical 48.4 +/- 8.8% vs 55.6 +/- 7.8%, p less than 0.05). However, the anterolateral and apical wall motion was not impaired in patients with coronary artery spasm. Thus, patients with organic coronary artery disease had impairment of left ventricular wall motion, while those with coronary artery spasm did not, although both groups of patients had symptoms of angina. These results suggest that patients with organic coronary artery disease may have had coronary blood flow disturbances through stenosed vessels and chronic active ischemia that produced left ventricular impairment.\r"

They were classified as finishers (F) and nonfinishers (NF) of the low-level protocol. The ejection fraction in the NF was 39 +/- 14% vs 56 +/- 17% in the F (p less than 0.01), and the NF had 2.6 +/- 0.8 vessels stenosed vs 1.8 +/- 0.9 vessels stenosed in the F (p less than .05). Ten normal subjects also performed the exercise test. At the same workload, patients with recent myocardial infarction had significantly lower oxygen consumption (NF less than F), significantly higher minute ventilation (NF greater than F), ventilatory equivalent for oxygen (NF greater than F), and higher respiratory exchange ratio (NF greater than F) than did normal subjects. The heart rate responses were higher in the post infarction patients than in normal subjects. The oxygen pulse was significantly lower in the cardiac patients compared to normals. These findings suggest that during the early recovery phase from an acute myocardial infarction, patients, particularly the NF, utilize less oxygen at submaximal work loads than do normal subjects. This suggests that in these patients part of the energy requirements for exercise are met anaerobically. This could be due to abnormal extraction of oxygen by the working muscles or as a result of poor delivery of oxygen due to abnormal left ventricular function.\r"

Ventricular arrhythmias were present in 62 (95.4%), of whom 52 (80%) showed a complex form (multiform ventricular extrasystoles, pairs, and ventricular tachycardia). Forty-one patients, presenting with complex ventricular arrhythmias, received antiarrhythmic treatment with amiodarone (600 mg/day in the first week, 400 mg/day in the second week, and 200 to 400 mg/day chronically), and were then controlled with periodic 24-hour ambulatory monitoring. A significant reduction in the number of ventricular extrasystoles was seen in over 70% of patients during a 3-year period. There was also a significant decrease in the incidence of complex ventricular arrhythmias (particularly of ventricular tachycardia). Adverse effects were noted in 23 patients, but only four had to stop treatment. During the follow-up period, 19 patients died: 14 of heart failure, four of sudden death, and one of a noncardiac cause; all patients who died suddenly were not treated with amiodarone (p = 0.022). Complex ventricular arrhythmias are frequent in dilated cardiomyopathy and it is suggested that amiodarone is effective in short- and long-term control of these arrhythmias.\r"

Abnormal biopsy findings were recognized in 9 of 16 (60%) chagasic patients with no clinical evidence of myocardial damage. In cases of segmental asynergy only, biopsies were abnormal in 18 of 19 patients. When signs of advanced myocardial damage were evidenced by clinical examination or ECGs, all biopsies were abnormal. Mitochondrial, nuclear, and cell membrane irregularities were consistent findings. A peculiar dilatation and filling of the T tubule system with a glycoprotein-like substance and a remarkable increase in monoamine oxidase activity were observed early in the disease and progressed in magnitude and frequency as myocardial damage became more evident by other diagnostic methods. Septal endomyocardial biopsy is a sensitive method for detection of early myocardial damage in chronic chagasic patients. Based on these findings, a modification of the currently used classification is proposed.\r"

The mean +/- SD of the weighed mass of the excised ventricles was 104 +/- 25 gm. The mean predicted left ventricular mass with the use of the cylinder-ellipse geometric model and gross anatomic sections corresponding to the echocardiographic imaging planes was 106 +/- 26 gm (r = 0.97 compared to the actual weight). The mean echocardiographic estimate of left ventricular mass at end diastolic was 107 +/- 24 gm (r = 0.98 compared to the weight) and 105 +/- 26 gm at end systole (r = 0.95 compared to the weight). The correlation between the echocardiographic mass estimate at end diastole and the echo mass estimate at end systole was 0.95. Regression analysis failed to demonstrate a significant over- or underestimation of the actual weight by the calculated mass with the use of either the gross anatomic or the in vivo echocardiographic dimension measurements.\r"

Resting left ventricular ejection fraction did not differ between male and female subjects (64 +/- 5.4 vs 64 +/- 6.1; p = NS). Both the peak left ventricular ejection fraction (78 +/- 4.4 vs 72 +/- 9.2; p less than 0.001) and the change in ejection fraction with exercise (14 +/- 4.0 vs 7.9 +/- 7.0; p less than 0.001) were significantly greater in men compared to respective values in women. Regression analysis showed that sex (r = 0.51; p less than 0.001) but not age (r = -0.18; p = 0.19) was a significant predictor of change in ejection fraction with exercise. Data on left ventricular volume response to exercise, available in 43 subjects, revealed that men had a greater percentage of decline in end-systolic volume with exercise than women (-47 +/- 15 vs -24 +/- 26; p less than 0.001). It is concluded that sex exerts a significant influence on normal left ventricular response to fatigue-limited supine exercise and that the gender difference is mediated, in part, by left ventricular end-systolic volume response to exercise.\r"

Twelve patients (mean age 56.7 +/- 3.2 years, SEM) with New York Heart Association functional class III or IV (11 patients) received increasing doses of dobutamine with hemodynamic and SVO2 determinations. Dose-dependent hemodynamic improvements occurred with dobutamine administration. The correlation between cardiac output (CO) and SVO2 was poor (r2 = 0.37). One subset of patients (seven patients) had a good correlation (r2 greater than or equal to 0.7), whereas a second subset (five patients) had a weak correlation (r2 less than 0.7) between CO and SVO2. The baseline hemodynamic profile of the latter group demonstrates a trend toward a more seriously ill subset of patients compared to the former group. A parallel relationship between CO and SVO2 may not occur in seriously ill CHF patients. One possible explanation may be a changing oxygen consumption rate in the seriously ill patient, resulting in changes in CO without concomitant changes in SVO2.\r"

Four studies were inadequate in fetuses (one pulmonary artery, two mitral, and one tricuspid) and some post natal studies were inadequate due to inability to separate atrioventricular valve E and A velocity component waveforms (one tricuspid, three mitral). Heart rates for fetuses and newborns more than 24 hours of age and less than 24 hours of age were similar. Pulmonary artery diastolic velocities consistent with patent ductus arteriosus were present in 11 of 12 examinations at less than 6 hours of age, in 5 of 13 examined at 6 to 24 hours of age, and in 2 of 27 examined after 24 hours of age. Pulmonary artery times to peak velocity were similar in fetuses, m = 46, SD = 3 msec, and in neonates less than 6 hours of age, m = 51, SD = 13 msec, but lengthened significantly, p less than 0.05, at 6 to 24 hours (m = 69, SD = 14 msec). These changes are probably due to the dramatic changes in pulmonary vascular pressure that occur after birth. Data from 6 to 24 hours and greater than 24 hours (m = 78, SD = 13 msec) were similar. Significant differences existed for transmitral valve E/A ratios, which increased from m = 0.85 in utero to m = 1.17 (p less than 0.05) after birth, with no significant change thereafter.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

This index increased from 5 and 27 hours age, while Ao FVI, reflecting total pulmonary flow, remained unchanged. Evidence of a left-to-right ductal shunt demonstrated as diastolic retrograde flow in the main PA was detected in 42 neonates at 5 hours and in only four subjects after 27 hours of age, indicating a patent ductus arteriosus at 5 hours of age and its subsequent closure. In the PA, acceleration time (AT) increased while pre-ejection period to ejection time ratio (PEP/ET) decreased from 5 to 27 hours of age, reflecting the physiologic fall in PA pressure. In the Ao, FVI, AT, and PEP/ET remained unchanged, suggesting little change in left ventricular function.\r"

Each of the deaths occurred in the group with unsatisfactory postoperative hemodynamic findings. An ideal late clinical result can be anticipated in most patients with excellent or satisfactory postoperative hemodynamic findings. The greater the deviation from normal hemodynamic findings, the worse the prognosis. From the excellent group to the unsatisfactory group, the incidence of late ideal result decreased from 95% to 61.1%, while the incidence of poor result increased from 0% to 27.8%. Among various factors in patients in the unsatisfactory hemodynamic group, right ventricular outflow tract obstruction seems to have the worst late result. A large right ventricular-pulmonary artery pressure gradient was noted in three of four who died suddenly. The late result of patients with a small shunt (pulmonary blood flow/systemic blood flow less than 2) seems acceptable; the decision to reoperate in these patients should be made very cautiously.\r"

Each patient underwent three upright exercise studies at identical workloads; the first was a baseline study, the second was done 3 hours after a single oral dose, and the third was obtained after chronic therapy for 2 weeks. Beta blockade was evident by significant decreases in heart rate, systolic blood pressure, and diastolic blood pressure at rest and during exercise (p less than 0.04). Although there were no significant changes (at rest or during exercise) in mean left ventricular ejection fraction and peak filling rate, individual variations were seen after 3 hours and 2 weeks of therapy. During chronic therapy, the peak filling rate increased in three patients, decreased in five, and remained unchanged in seven. Also, discordant changes in systolic and diastolic functions were seen at rest and during exercise during both acute and chronic therapy. Thus, although acute and chronic beta blockade produces no significant changes in mean measurements of diastolic and systolic left ventricular performance, individual variations and discordant results are seen in many patients. The acute effects are generally consistent with the chronic effects, but exceptions are present.\r"

Although the relative risk was comparable in the two sexes, CHD did not eliminate the female advantage over men. Myocardial infarction imposed a greater sudden death risk than angina pectoris, and silent infarctions were as dangerous as symptomatic infarctions. Onset of CHD put young and old at equal risk of sudden death. Some 40% of sudden deaths occurred in the 4% of the general population with overt CHD. The proportion of coronary attacks presenting as sudden death increased from 13% at ages 35 to 64 years to 20% at ages 65 to 94 years. The fraction of CHD deaths classified as sudden deaths was lower in those with than without interim CHD. In those with established CHD, factors reflecting ischemic myocardial damage and cardiac failure were the chief predictors of sudden death. The proportion of CHD deaths presenting as sudden deaths has not declined in subjects with prior CHD over three decades, despite a national decline in the overall CHD mortality rate.\r"

Fifty-six patients were studied: 28 received intravenous streptokinase and 28 intravenous recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator. None of these clinical criteria, considered separately, was predictive of infarct artery recanalization status. Using the presence or absence of all 3 criteria, the specificity and predictive value increased to 100%. However, only 9% of patients in the series had all 3 criteria present (all had a patent infarct artery) and 34% had no criteria present (all had an occluded vessel).

At 1 year Q waves had disappeared in 12 of 53 patients (23%): 5 with anterior and 7 with inferior AMI. Segmental asynergy, however, was present in 9 of these 12 patients, although dyskinesia was absent. Presence of Q waves at 1 year (41 patients) was always associated with segmental asynergy. Wall motion score, based on degree of segmental asynergy, was higher in the 41 patients with Q waves compared with patients in whom Q waves disappeared (7.8 +/- 4.4 vs 2.7 +/- 1.9, p less than 0.001). In patients with anterior AMI the number of Q waves at 1 year and the grade of asynergy were correlated. Segmental dyskinesia was rare in patients with inferior AMI (1 of 25) but was common in those with anterior AMI (18 of 28), and was consistently present in patients with more than 2 anterior Q waves.\r"

  ".W": "To determine whether arteriographic dimensions of the acutely recanalized coronary lumen provide information about regional perfusion or clinical outcome, quantitative arteriography was used to measure minimum luminal diameter achieved with intracoronary streptokinase administration in 44 patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Degree of coronary reperfusion was independently assessed visually using the criteria applied in the multicenter Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction study. Minimum diameter and qualitative reperfusion grade were both assessed from 172 coronary injections during thrombolysis. Partial perfusion (grade 1 or 2) was seen in 95 of 135 injections (70%) in which the minimum diameter was less than 0.6 mm and complete perfusion (grade 3) was seen in 35 of 37 injections (95%) in which it was 0.6 mm or more (p less than 0.001). Repeat cardiac catheterization was performed at 5.5 +/- 4.9 weeks after AMI (n = 20). When vessels were opened acutely to a minimum diameter of less than 0.6 mm, 5 of 12 vessels (42%) were reoccluded at the time of restudy and 8 of 29 patients (28%) died within 12 months. By contrast, 0 of 8 vessels (0%) were reoccluded when the artery was opened to a diameter of at least 0.6 mm (difference not significant), and only 1 of 15 patients (7%) died (p less than 0.05).Of the patients with grade 1 o r 2 perfusion at the end of the thrombolytic infusion, 7 of 19 (37%) died within 12 months and 2 of 4 vessels (50%) reoccluded; of the patients with grade 3 perfusion, 2 of 25 (8%) died (p less than 0.05) and 2 of 16 vessels (13%) reoccluded (difference not significant).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Eighteen patients were men and 7 were women; age range was 36 to 75 years (mean 60). All patients had angina pectoris, a positive treadmill test response or positive exercise radionuclide findings. The mean preexercise plasma endorphin level was 4.9 +/- 3.0 pmol/liter (range 0.7 to 13.5). The mean postexercise plasma endorphin level of 6.6 +/- 4.6 mol/liter (range 0 to 19.5) was significantly higher (p less than 0.05). A significant positive correlation was seen between postexercise endorphin levels and time to onset of angina (r = 0.4, p = 0.03). There were negative correlations between postexercise endorphin levels and occurrence (r = -0.4, p = 0.04) and duration of angina (r = -0.4, p = 0.05). No association was found for maximal heart rate-blood pressure product, workload, time to ST-segment depression or stress ejection fraction. A positive correlation was found between rest left ventricular ejection fraction and postexercise endorphin levels (r = 0.5, p = 0.02). In conclusion, in patients with exercise-induced myocardial ischemia, plasma beta-endorphin levels are increased after exercise; postexercise endorphin levels are related to timing and occurrence (presence or absence) of angina; and endorphins may alter the perception of pain caused by myocardial ischemia.\r"

Of 532 consecutive patients who underwent exercise thallium imaging, follow-up was complete in 515 (97%) after an average of 36 months (range 31 to 48). Two hundred six patients had an abnormal exercise thallium response and 309 had a normal response. Twenty morbid cardiac events occurred (13 deaths and 7 acute myocardial infarctions [AMI]). Of the 13 patients who died, 12 had abnormal thallium results. Overall, 5.8% of the patients with abnormal thallium results died, in contrast to 0.3% of patients with normal results. Of the 7 patients who had a nonfatal AMI, 3 had abnormal exercise thallium results. Moreover, similar proportions of patients (1.4% and 1.3%) with normal and abnormal exercise thallium results had nonfatal AMI. Presence or absence of pathologic Q waves and inclusion of exercise electrocardiographic results did not significantly alter the results. Thus, although a normal exercise thallium response significantly reduces the likelihood of cardiovascular death, its predictive value for nonfatal AMI is limited. Moreover, the relatively low event rate for patients with a positive exercise thallium response further limits its prognostic value.\r"

  ".W": "Experience is reported with 100 consecutive patients in whom percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) was attempted on chronically occluded coronary arteries that had no visible anterograde flow. Ninety-eight patients had angina and all had collateral vessels to the occluded artery on angiography. A movable guidewire/dilatation system was used in all cases. Overall initial PTCA success rate was 56% and was related to duration of occlusion (69% success rate for occlusions of 1 month or less, 50% for 1 to 6 months and 11% after 6 months). Complications were minor; no patient died or required emergency bypass operation. Of the 44 patients in whom PTCA failed, 20 underwent elective bypass surgery for relief of angina and 24 were treated medically. Follow-up at a mean of 8 months (range 1 to 48) was available for 49 of the 56 patients in whom PTCA was successful: 40 had subjective improvement, 6 no change and 3 felt worse. Control angiography was carried out in 40 of the 56 patients with primary success and showed long-term success in 18 and reocclusion or significant stenosis in 22. Of these 22, 11 were successfully treated by a second PTCA, 2 underwent operation and 9 were treated medically. Recanalization of totally occluded coronary arteries with no forward flow has a lower initial success rate (56%) than PTCA for stenoses and the recurrence rate is higher (55%), but effective relief of angina is achieved in successful cases. The risk of serious complications appears to be low.\r"

All underwent coronary arteriography, which showed that at least 1 major artery had more than 70% stenosis in 34 patients. For each patient, the same physician performed both tests, with the same echocardiographic equipment. Detection of new onset or worsening regional asynergy was the only criterion of positivity for both tests. DET yielded interpretable studies in all 55 patients (100%); EET yielded only 40 such studies (73%) (p less than 0.01). In the 40 patients in whom both tests were interpretable, DET showed, compared with EET, a similar sensitivity (72% vs 76%) and specificity (100% vs 87%) (difference not significant for both) for detecting angiographically assessed coronary artery disease. In the 16 patients in whom both DET and EET yielded positive responses for ischemia, the same myocardial region showed reversible asynergy. Thus, independent of all factors that can affect the performance of each test (operator, patient and instrumentation), DET was significantly more feasible than EET, with comparable sensitivity and specificity. Dipyridamole provokes asynergy in the same regions that show ischemia during exercise.\r"

  ".W": "In 100 patients with coronary artery disease (CAD), the prevalence and severity of asynergy was determined for 9 left ventricular (LV) segments by both radionuclide and contrast angiography. The anterior, septal and lateral LV walls had significantly more prevalent and more severe asynergy in the medial segments than in the basal segments. In contrast, the inferior LV wall exhibited equally severe asynergy in both the medial and basal segments. In general, asynergy was most severe in the apical, medial septal, medial inferior and basal inferior LV segments. This asymmetric distribution of LV asynergy could not be explained by the distribution of occlusions or significant stenoses in the arterial tree, which were relatively uniformly distributed among the left anterior descending (32%), left circumflex (29%) and right (26%) coronary arteries. It is postulated instead that the asymmetric distribution of LV asynergy results from asymmetry of the coronary arterial tree supplying the left ventricle and that the prevalence of asynergy in an LV segment is directly related to its vascular distance from the coronary ostia. Unlike the relatively direct supply of the left anterior descending and circumflex arteries to the basal segments of the anterior, septal and lateral LV walls, the arterial supply to the basal inferior wall begins only after the right or dominant circumflex artery has traversed the length of the atrioventricular groove, significantly increasing its susceptibility to the pressure attenuation and occlusive jeopardy of more proximal stenoses.\r"

To assess the usefulness of radionuclide ventriculography combined with provocative tests for diagnosis of coronary spasm, the left ventricular (LV) response to exercise, hyperventilation and a cold pressor test was determined in 3 groups. Group I included 10 normal subjects; group II, 49 patients with typical effort angina and fixed obstructive coronary artery disease at catheterization; and group III, 19 patients suspected of having vasospastic angina based on clinical and electrocardiographic findings, each of whom had normal coronary angiographic findings. In group I, LV ejection fraction (EF) increased during hyperventilation and exercise testing in 9 of 10 subjects (90%) and failed to decrease 5% in 9 of 10 subjects (90%) during cold testing. In contrast, while 18 of 49 patients (37%) of group II showed LV dysfunction with cold testing and 8% with hyperventilation, all showed abnormal LV function during exercise. Finally, in group III, LVEF increased during exercise, mimicking the response in normal group, while dysfunction was present in 14 of 19 (74%) during hyperventilation and in 17 of 19 (89%) during cold testing. When results of hyperventilation and cold testing were combined, abnormal responses were present in all patients. Thus, radionuclide ventriculography, when performed in association with 3 forms of stress--exercise, hyperventilation and cold testing--allows accurate identification of patients likely to have coronary spasm.\r"

  ".W": "Thirty-eight patients who had sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia (VT) or sudden cardiac death underwent programmed ventricular stimulation. To assess the relative efficacy of right and left ventricular (RV and LV) stimulation, a tandem protocol with 1 to 4 extrastimuli and burst pacing was used. Each step of the protocol was performed in a rotating sequence at the RV apex, basal RV septum and LV apex. Sustained VT was induced from the RV apex in 26 patients, right ventricle (either site) in 27, and LV apex in 24, and spontaneous VT was reproduced from those sites in 11, 14 and 12 patients, respectively. In the 23 patients who had sustained VT induced from both ventricles, RV stimulation always required fewer or the same number of extrastimuli for induction. At every stage of the protocol, the cumulative yield of sustained VT was consistently greater from the right ventricle than from the left ventricle. After delivering 4 extrastimuli and burst pacing, LV stimulation only increased the yield of sustained VT by 1 patient, and spontaneous VT by 3 patients. Inducibility or noninducibility in the right ventricle generally predicted the same outcome in the left ventricle. Previously undocumented VT or ventricular fibrillation was induced from the right ventricle in 19 patients and from the left ventricle in 13. Thus, LV stimulation was less efficacious than RV stimulation. LV stimulation increased the yield over RV stimulation only minimally and did not reduce the number of extrastimuli required to induce sustained VT.\r"

Univariate analysis and stepwise logistic regression of angiographic and electrocardiographic variables identified late potentials as an independent marker of the patient with sustained VT. The odds ratio for late potentials to detect patients with prior sustained VT was 2.6. Six-month follow-up revealed a cardiac mortality rate of 11% and an arrhythmia event rate of 22% in patients with late potentials vs a cardiac mortality rate of 3% and an arrhythmia event rate of 13% in patients without late potentials.

This study attempts to determine if VT inducible only during isoproterenol infusion predicts suppression of VT with chronic oral beta-adrenergic blockade. Nine patients, aged 23 to 77 years, with symptomatic VT or syncope not necessarily provoked by exercise or stress were evaluated. Extrastimuli did not induce VT in any patient. However, during isoproterenol infusion (1 to 4 micrograms/min), all patients had reproducibly inducible VT corresponding to their spontaneously occurring VT (recordings available in 7 patients). Coupling intervals inducing tachycardia during isoproterenol were similar to intervals that did not induce VT without isoproterenol. No patient had VT with isoproterenol infusion alone (without extrastimuli). In only 4 of 8 patients who underwent exercise tests while not taking medications was VT provoked. With propranolol therapy (160 mg/day) or its equivalent, only 1 patient had recurrent symptoms during a mean follow-up of 39 months (range 23 to 52). VT inducible with extrastimuli only during isoproterenol infusion predicts that oral beta-adrenergic blockade will prevent spontaneous VT or syncope long term. These data suggest that occurrence of VT in some patients depends on premature depolarizations in the setting of beta-adrenergic influence.\r"

Fifty patients had documented nonsustained VT and 32 had sustained monomorphic VT.

Repetitive ventricular responses were induced in all patients, and in 15 (14%) polymorphic ventricular arrhythmias requiring DC shock were induced. Incidence of initiation of sustained monomorphic VT and polymorphic ventricular arrhythmias requiring DC shock was related to the clinical arrhythmia and the stimulation protocol. In patients with documented sustained monomorphic VT, a third extrastimulus only increased the incidence of sustained monomorphic VT (68% to 94%), whereas in patients with documented nonsustained VT and without VT the incidence of both polymorphic and monomorphic arrhythmias increased by 7 to 12%. Sustained monomorphic VTs induced in patients without such a history were faster (p less than 0.01), depended on site of MI (p less than 0.05) and were more often preceded by nonsustained polymorphic VT (p less than 0.01) than in patients with documented sustained monomorphic VT.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

This study also examined whether modification of delayed potentials after surgery was associated with loss of ability to induce VT or improvement in left ventricular function. Signal averaging of the electrocardiogram (ECG), programmed stimulation and radionuclide ventriculography were performed preoperatively and were repeated 10 to 14 days postoperatively. At preoperative investigation, all patients had delayed potentials on the signal-averaged ECG and inducible VT at programmed stimulation. In 7 patients (33%), delayed potentials were abolished by surgery, exceeding the baseline variability of 8.5% for detection of delayed potentials. VT was no longer inducible postoperatively in 16 patients (76%), including the 7 in whom delayed potentials were no longer detectable. In the patients in whom VT was no longer inducible, mean ventricular activation time decreased from 178 ms preoperatively to 151 ms postoperatively (standard error of the mean difference = 6 ms, p less than 0.001). In the 5 patients with inducible VT postoperatively, no significant change in mean ventricular activation time was seen, 181 vs 171 ms (standard error of mean difference = 9 ms). Reductions in ventricular activation time were not associated with an improvement in left ventricular ejection fraction unless aneurysmectomy was performed in addition to excision of electrically abnormal myocardium. Thus, the signal-averaged ECG may have a role in assessing the efficacy of antiarrhythmic surgery.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias (torsades de pointes-type ventricular tachycardia) occurred in 4 patients, degenerating into either ventricular flutter or fibrillation in 2. ST-segment changes suggestive of acute transitory myocardial ischemia were found in 8 patients (1.5 mm or more of ST depression in 7 patients and 1.5 mm or more of ST elevation in 1 patient). The frequency and severity of arrhythmias were significantly higher in patients studied within 48 hours of subarachnoid hemorrhage; serious ventricular arrhythmias were associated with QTc prolongation more than 550 ms and with hypokalemia less than 3.5 mEq/liter. No correlation was found between age, clinical condition, site and extent of subarachnoid hemorrhage and either the occurrence or severity of arrhythmias. The results of our study indicate an extremely high incidence of arrhythmias, sometimes serious, in subarachnoid hemorrhage, especially in the first 48 hours after hemorrhage. Continuous electrocardiographic monitoring is therefore mandatory.\r"

A logistic model was used to determine which clinical, electrocardiographic and electrophysiologic variables were associated with multiple AV pathways. Right free-wall and posteroseptal accessory AV pathways were more common in patients with multiple AV pathways and were frequently associated.

Mean values for P-wave amplitudes of 3.0 vs 3.1 mV and slew rates 0.4 V/s vs 0.6 V/s, and QRS amplitudes of 1.0 vs 1.2 mV and slew rates 0.4 vs 0.2 V/s were obtained. The frequency content was also similar, with spectral maxima at 8 vs 9 Hz (P wave) and 7 vs 6 Hz (QRS). In contrast, atrial electrocardiograms derived from the orthogonal electrodes were significantly different: P-wave amplitude of 6.1 mV (p less than 0.025) and slew rate of 1 V/s and QRS of 0.13 mV and slew rate of 0.04 V/s. Spectral analysis was also dissimilar with maxima at 34 Hz (P wave) and 3 Hz (QRS). Orthogonal noncontacting sensing electrodes positioned within the atrial appendage offer substantially better electrographic P-wave amplitude detection and QRS rejection than contacting tip electrodes. These leads yield a significant improvement when discriminate atrial sensing is required.\r"

Mean age of the study group was 62 +/- 10 years, 60% had ischemic cardiomyopathy, and two-thirds were in New York Heart Association functional class II or III. Fifteen clinical variables were analyzed using a Cox proportional hazards model, while individual variables also were calculated for independent prognostic significance. There were 85 deaths, 26 (31%) of which were sudden cardiac deaths. Three characteristics at the study entry independently predicted an increased mortality risk: left ventricular ejection fraction, maximal oxygen uptake and ischemic cardiomyopathy. A Cox proportional hazards model showed that the combination of VO2max, S3 and the diagnosis of ischemic cardiomyopathy provided the best estimates of risk for an early death. Mortality for the low-risk group was only 5% at 6 months and 10% at 1 year. In contrast, in patients with an S3, ischemic cardiomyopathy and low maximal oxygen uptake, 6-month mortality was 24% and 36% at 1 year (p less than 0.001). Thus, these patients at high risk with left ventricular dysfunction associated with ischemic heart disease, a decreasing exercise tolerance and the development of an S3 should be strongly considered for an interventional trial with the aim of decreasing mortality.\r"

The clinical picture in 11 patients was a refractory low cardiac output state. In only 3 cases was AMI diagnosis confirmed during life. Six patients either had a technical complication or a coronary embolus; in these patients AMI was localized in the vascular bed of a single occluded coronary artery, and its morphologic picture resembled that of usual AMI. The 6 other patients did not have a defined cause for AMI and coronary occlusion was not present. In 4 such patients, there was massive circumferential necrosis, mainly in the subendocardium; comparatively, there was a greater prevalence of hemorrhage, contraction bands and necrosis of the layer of subendocardial cells adjacent to the left ventricular cavity. The findings for this group suggest myocardial necrosis due to cell damage during cardiopulmonary bypass; no predisposing factor for perioperative AMI was identified.\r"

  ".W": "To characterize the abnormal pattern of instantaneous left ventricular (LV) ejection in heart failure, proximal aortic pressure, flow, acceleration, power and dW/dt were measured at rest and during supine bicycle exercise using high-fidelity, catheter-mounted pressure and velocity sensors in 16 patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (IDC) and 11 normal control subjects. In patients with IDC, peak flow was lower than normal both at rest (454 +/- 155 vs 649 +/- 168 ml/s, p less than 0.01) and during exercise (569 +/- 213 vs 916 +/- 329 ml/s, p less than 0.01). Peak acceleration, power and dW/dt were also significantly reduced in patients with IDC at rest and during exercise. Time to peak flow (as a fraction of LV ejection time) was consistently prolonged in patients with IDC (rest, 0.40 +/- 0.08 vs 0.29 +/- 0.04; exercise, 0.36 +/- 0.06 vs 0.28 +/- 0.04, both p less than 0.01). Exercise-induced increments in peak flow, power and dW/dt were significantly blunted in patients with IDC. Studies during pacing tachycardia and nitroprusside administration failed to reproduce the abnormalities during exercise in patients with IDC. Thus, the instantaneous flow pulse in heart failure is both diminished in magnitude (decreased stroke volume and peak flow) and abnormal in shape (decrease peak acceleration and delayed time to peak flow). Exercise stress in IDC results in abnormalities of LV performance that can be detected using instantaneous ejection information. These abnormalities are unlikely to be explained by changes in heart rate or loading conditions.\r"

This study describes the rapid development of mechanical malfunction of the atrioventricular (AV) valve in a subset of patients with single ventricle. Eighty patients with single ventricle were reviewed. Eight patients with single ventricle and single AV valve were observed to have moderate to severe AV valvular regurgitation. Patient age when AV regurgitation was first detected was 22 months to 35 years (median 15 years). Clinically, all patients were symptomatic and had severe congestive heart failure. All patients underwent cardiac catheterization, which revealed moderate to severe AV regurgitation; 7 of 8 patients had well preserved ventricular function. Earlier catheterization revealed no significant AV regurgitation. Four patients underwent surgery: 2 had AV valve replacement with the Fontan procedure and 2 had Carpentier ring placement (1 with the Fontan procedure). The 3 survivors were in improved clinical condition. At surgery 1 patient had an abnormal AV valve with 4 leaflets, and the other 3 had myxomatous degeneration of the AV valve. Thus, AV regurgitation is a significant and specific complication that occurs in patients with single ventricle and single AV valve. If recognized before development of eventual myocardial dysfunction, surgical management should be considered.\r"

  ".W": "Pulsed Doppler echocardiography was used to examine the relation between pulmonary valve motion and pulmonary artery (PA) flow velocity patterns in 39 adults. In 16 patients with normal PA pressure (mean pressure less than 20 mm Hg), PA flow velocity accelerated slowly to a peak flow velocity at midsystole (time to peak flow velocity, or acceleration time = 134 +/- 20 ms [mean +/- standard deviation]), followed by a slow deceleration to the end of ejection, producing a \"dome-like\" appearance. In contrast, in 23 patients with elevated PA pressure (mean pressure 20 mm Hg or more), flow velocity accelerated rapidly to a peak flow velocity in early systole (acceleration time = 88 +/- 25 ms, p less than 0.01), followed by rapid flow velocity deceleration to a nadir in midsystole. In 13 of these patients, a transient increase in flow velocity occurred in late systole, producing a \"spike and dome\" appearance. In patients with an acceleration time of 120 ms or less, there was a negative linear correlation with mean PA pressure, expressed by the equation: mean PA pressure = 90 - (0.62 X acceleration time). The standard error of the estimate was 8.3 mm Hg. A similar negative linear correlation was found between PA acceleration time and total pulmonary resistance. Using a PA acceleration time of 100 ms or less resulted in a 78% sensitivity and a 100% specificity for detection of elevated PA pressure. Although this Doppler method cannot precisely estimate PA pressure, it can be helpful in separating patients with normal pressure from those with elevated PA pressure.\r"

The postulation was that impaired peripheral oxygen delivery would reduce the ratio of the oxygen utilized relative to work performed. The ratio of increase in VO2 to increase in WR (delta VO2/delta WR) was relatively constant: 10.29 +/- 1.01 ml/min/W in normal men (n = 54) for exercise 6 to 14 minutes in duration with uniform work increments of 15, 20, 25 or 30 W/min, regardless of age. The value in men with uncomplicated systemic hypertension (n = 24) was not significantly different from that of normal men. However, more than half of the men with peripheral vascular disease (n = 7) or pulmonary vascular disease (n = 5) or men who had electrocardiographic abnormalities during exercise (n = 39) had a significantly lower delta VO2/delta WR, 8.29 +/- 1.17 ml/min/W (p less than 0.05) especially evident as maximal work rates were approached. Thus, delta VO2/delta WR during incremental exercise testing is predictable for normal men and a reduction in this ratio indicates cardiovascular dysfunction.\r"

In a randomized, double-blind study, 5 healthy subjects received, on 3 separate days 1 week apart, either (1) 300 to 400 mg 3-OHQ orally or (2) 150 mg quinidine base intravenously or (3) a combination in the same doses. Blood samples and electrocardiographic recordings were obtained over the following 10 hours. Serum concentrations of 3-OHQ and quinidine were determined by high-pressure liquid chromatography and the free fraction by ultrafiltration. Peak concentrations of 3-OHQ varied between 1,362 and 3,480 ng/ml after oral 3-OHQ ingestion, but were negligible after intravenous quinidine infusion. The free fraction was 49% +/- 4.8 (mean +/- standard deviation) for 3-OHQ and 20% +/- 4.3 for quinidine. In all 5 subjects a statistically significant correlation was found between serum concentration and QTc prolongation for both quinidine and 3-OHQ (largest p value less than 0.025). The mean slope of the regression line was 0.0184 +/- 0.0128 for 3-OHQ and 0.0297 +/- 0.0111 for quinidine. Multiple linear regression revealed in each subject a significant additive effect of 3-OHQ when administered together with quinidine (largest p value less than 0.05).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Radionuclide cardiography was performed at rest and during upright 50% submaximal bicycle exercise. During alcohol intoxication alone (serum ethanol 30 mmol/liter), heart rate at rest increased by 11% (p less than 0.05) and LV ejection fraction (EF) decreased by 6% because of end-systolic dilation. No significant alcohol-induced hemodynamic changes were observed during exercise. Plasma norepinephrine concentration increased by 29% (p less than 0.05), whereas plasma epinephrine concentration did not change. During subsequent autonomic nervous blockade with intravenous metoprolol and atropine infusion, heart rate at rest further increased and systolic blood pressure decreased. These changes were not, however, significantly different from those of a control experiment in which a nonalcoholic isocaloric drink was substituted for alcohol. Plasma norepinephrine levels at rest and during exercise were 25% and 32% higher (both p less than 0.05), respectively, than those during control conditions. Plasma epinephrine concentrations did not change. These findings suggest that alcohol intoxication has a depressant effect on LV function at rest that stimulates autonomic nervous blockade. The increased sympathetic nervous activity during exercise appears to be a toxic rather than a compensatory effect of alcohol.\r"

The electrocardiographic signal is a reliable marker of ischemia in defined populations of patients with angina and coronary disease, but should be interpreted with caution outside of these groups. Detailed studies in patients with chronic stable angina have shown that transient ischemia is frequently silent and prolonged, and may occur without evidence of physical exertion. Analysis of underlying changes in regional myocardial perfusion using rubidium-82 and positron tomography has shown that a decrease in myocardial perfusion (supply) is involved in the genesis of many episodes of ischemia during daily life. Clinical trials have shown that drugs that affect demand and supply are efficacious against both painful and painless ischemia and that combinations of agents can provide useful benefits. There is, however, marked natural variability in disease activity despite \"stable\" symptoms, which must be taken into account in individual patient assessment and the rational design of clinical trials. Ambulatory monitoring permits quantitation of previously unrecognized myocardial ischemia, and treatment can thus be assessed in terms of ischemic activity during everyday life rather than on data obtained during brief hospital visits. An active approach to the detection and monitoring of transient ischemia with and without pain will be necessary if prospective clinical research shows that treatment of silent myocardial ischemia can prevent myocardial damage and improve prognosis.\r"

The significance of this concept resides in the fact that it redirects the focus from the end result--angina--to the more fundamental, underlying pathophysiologic factors that precede it. Specifically, these events include diminished left ventricular compliance, decreased myocardial contractility, increased left ventricular end-diastolic pressure, ST-segment changes and, occasionally, angina pectoris.\r"

These silent attacks may be even more important clinically than painful attacks. It has been suggested that silent myocardial ischemia has an adverse impact on prognosis in patients with totally asymptomatic ischemia or asymptomatic postinfarction ischemia. Further, it has been shown that there is a direct relation between the duration and frequency of silent myocardial ischemia and subsequent cardiac events in patients with unstable angina. Therefore, aggressive therapy may be warranted in certain groups of patients in whom silent myocardial ischemia constitutes a significant part of the total ischemic burden.\r"

One possible explanation for such findings is that episodes of angina are only a small fraction of the daily ischemic episodes occurring in these patients. Silent episodes represent most of the ischemic burden in many patients with coronary disease who have positive exercise test results despite the absence of pain. Silent episodes also represent most of the ischemic burden in patients with either stable or unstable angina. Since silent episodes may have prognostic significance, a major goal of therapy should be the modification of both silent and painful ischemic episodes. Currently available pharmacotherapy has the potential to reduce the total ischemic burden caused by both painful and painless attacks and, thereby, alter prognosis.\r"

Four hundred twenty-four had ischemic ST depression without angina (group 1); 232 had angina but no ischemic ST depression (group 2); 456 had both ischemic ST depression and angina (group 3); and 471 had neither ischemic ST depression nor angina (group 4). Sixty-three percent of patients in group 1 and 55% in group 2 had multivessel CAD (difference not significant). The 7-year survival rates were similar for patients in groups 1 (76%), 2 (77%), and 3 (78%), but were significantly better for patients in group 4 (88%, p less than 0.001). Among group 1 patients, survival was related to severity of CAD (p less than 0.001). The 7-year survival rate in group 1 was significantly worse than that in a separate group of 282 patients with ischemic ST depression without angina during exercise testing who had no CAD (95% survival, p less than 0.001). Thus, in patients with silent myocardial ischemia during exercise testing, the extent of CAD and the 7-year survival rate are similar to those of patients with angina during exercise testing. Prognosis is determined primarily by the severity of CAD. In patients without CAD, the survival rate is excellent.\r"

All patients had undergone coronary angiography 24 +/- 4 days after infarction. Thirty-eight patients (63%) had no treadmill angina (silent ischemia, group I) and 22 patients had typical treadmill angina (symptomatic ischemia, group II). Use of beta-blocking drugs, calcium antagonists and nitrates at the time of exercise testing did not differ in the 2 groups. All 9 patients with diabetes mellitus were in the asymptomatic group (p less than 0.40) and group I had a greater proportion of inferior wall AMI (30 of 38) than group II (11 of 22, p = 0.02). Total exercise treadmill test duration (group I 422 +/- 31 seconds, group II 400 +/- 46 seconds) and rate-pressure product were not different in the 2 groups. The number of patients unable to exercise 5 minutes (12 in group I and 7 in group II), the number with diffuse electrocardiographic changes (9 in group I and 7 in group II), and the number with inadequate blood pressure response (8 in group I and 4 in group II) were also similar. At coronary arteriography the mean number of arteries with at least 70% diameter stenosis was 2.0 +/- 0.2 in group I and 2.2 +/- 0.2 in group II (difference not significant).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Although silent myocardial ischemia is a well recognized phenomenon, the reasons for the lack of symptoms in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) is unclear. Because the endogenous opioid beta-endorphin has been related to pain modulation, plasma beta-endorphin levels were studied before, during and after exercise-induced ischemia in symptomatic and asymptomatic men. Because beta-endorphin responses have been closely linked to adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and cortisol responses, these hormones also were measured. Nine symptomatic and 12 asymptomatic patients with a high probability (at least 95%) of CAD and 8 apparently healthy men completed a Bruce protocol treadmill test. Blood samples were drawn before, during and 10 minutes after exercise. During exercise the measured hormones showed no significant increases from basal levels. However, plasma beta-endorphin, ACTH and cortisol levels were significantly elevated (p less than or equal to 0.01) 10 minutes after exercise in all 3 groups. There was no significant difference in plasma beta-endorphin levels during or after exercise between the symptomatic and asymptomatic patients with CAD. Thus, differences in circulating levels of beta-endorphin, ACTH and cortisol are not associated with the presence or absence of pain during exercise-induced myocardial ischemia.\r"

  ".W": "To ascertain if myocardial ischemia is the mechanism of out-of-hospital ventricular fibrillation (VF), left ventricular (LV) function was assessed at rest and during submaximal exercise in 15 patients who survived out-of-hospital VF. They were separated into asymptomatic (9 patients, group A) and symptomatic (6 patients, group S) groups for a history of angina or myocardial infarction. Both groups had significant (at least 70% diameter stenosis) coronary artery disease. At catheterization no patient had angina during exercise, but 12 of 15 had ST depression or increased ST depression (group A, 1.9 +/- 1.4 mm; group S, 1.1 +/- 1.2 mm) and 11 had abnormal wall motion. From rest to exercise, patients in group S had increased LV end-diastolic pressure (from 21 +/- 9 to 37 +/- 11 mm Hg, p = 0.009) and volume (from 100 +/- 25 to 107 +/- 26 ml/m2, p = 0.006), with no significant change in LV ejection fraction (from 40 +/- 13 to 42 +/- 12%). In group A LV end-diastolic pressure increased from 19 +/- 4 to 31 +/- 8 mm Hg (p = 0.001), but neither end-diastolic volume nor ejection fraction changed significantly (from 83 +/- 13 to 92 +/- 23 ml/m2 and from 55 +/- 13% to 46 +/- 13%, respectively). Thus, patients with coronary artery disease who survive out-of-hospital VF may have evidence of myocardial ischemia during exercise without pain. Painless ischemia may have a role in out-of-hospital VF.\r"

  ".W": "Ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring is useful in documenting characteristics of both painful and silent myocardial ischemia occurring during out-of-hospital activities in patients with angina and coronary artery disease (CAD), but few data are available concerning silent myocardial ischemia during ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring in asymptomatic patients with CAD. Accordingly, 480 hours of ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring were recorded in 10 asymptomatic patients with CAD not receiving cardiac drugs (48 hours/patient). All 10 patients had silent myocardial ischemia on treadmill exercise testing, with initial ST-segment depression at 2 to 6 minutes in 7 patients and more than 6 minutes in 3 patients. During ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring, 64 episodes of silent myocardial ischemia (1 mm of ST-segment depression for at least 1 minute) were recorded, ranging from 1 to 17 episodes/patient/48 hours. Of the 64 silent myocardial ischemic episodes, 30 (47%) occurred between 6 am and noon. Duration of silent myocardial ischemia was 798 minutes (range 1 to 80). ST-segment depression ranged from 1 to 4.5 mm. Heart rate at onset of the episodes on ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring ranged from 65 to 150 beats/min (mean 98), which was significantly less than that during treadmill exercise testing in the same patients (mean 120). At cardiac catheterization, 7 patients had 2- or 3-vessel CAD and 3 had 1-vessel CAD. Thus, silent myocardial ischemia is common during daily life in asymptomatic CAD patients with positive treadmill exercise tests.\r"

  ".W": "The risk of premature coronary artery disease (CAD) and its determinants were investigated in a cohort of 292 patients with juvenile-onset, insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) who were followed for 20 to 40 years. Although patients with juvenile-onset IDDM had an extremely high risk of premature CAD, the earliest deaths due to CAD did not occur until late in the third decade of life. After age 30 years, the mortality rate due to CAD increased rapidly, equally in men and women, and particularly among persons with renal complications. By age 55 years the cumulative mortality rate due to CAD was 35 +/- 5%. This was far higher than the corresponding rate for nondiabetic persons in the Framingham Heart Study, 8% for men and 4% for women. Angina and acute nonfatal myocardial infarction followed a similar pattern, as did asymptomatic CAD detected by stress test, so that their combined prevalence rate was 33% among survivors aged 45 to 59 years. Age at onset of IDDM and the presence of eye complications did not contribute to risk of premature CAD. This pattern suggests that juvenile-onset diabetes and its renal complications are modifiers of the natural history of atherosclerosis in that although they profoundly accelerate progression of early atherosclerotic lesions to very severe CAD, they may not contribute to initiation of atherosclerosis.\r"
