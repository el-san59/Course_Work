OFX concentrations in peritoneal fluid underwent cyclical changes with each change of solutions, reaching beyond 0.5 mg/l after 2 hours of equilibration. There was a highly significant correlation between corresponding serum and peritoneal fluid concentrations of OFX after an 8 h equilibration (r = 0.85, p less than 0.001). In 5 patients given a 400 mg loading dose followed by 200 mg of OFX per day for 7 days, trough serum OFX concentrations ranged from 1.35 to 7.00 mg/l and no adverse effects were noticed. CAPD per exchange removed less than 2% of the total dose of OFX given.\r"

Three of three chimpanzees given plasma from patients with AIDS or ARC tested positive for HIV antigens beginning six to ten weeks after transfusion. Antigen production rose sharply but was of short duration. Despite their proven infectivity and the presence of anti-HIV antibody, all donors to these chimpanzees tested negative for the HIV antigen. Of the three animals that developed HIV antigen one animal did not produce any HIV antibodies or evidence of disease. A second produced antibodies to only the p24 and p18 antigens and remained clinically well. The third produced antibodies beginning with anti-p24, to all the major HIV proteins except gp120, and then developed marked lymphadenopathy which persisted for 32 weeks. Antibody persistence after the disappearance of clinical disease was variable and was greatest for gp41 and least for p24. These data may be of value in the interpretation of human serological testing for HIV and in further studies of the sequence of events leading to the pathological effects of HIV infection. A significant value of the chimpanzee model is the capacity of this animal to respond in a variety of ways to HIV infection, suggesting the existence of successive or alternate states of early HIV infection, and may have implications in the design of early interventions.\r"

In these experiments, sera from a wide spectrum of HIV infected patients ranging from asymptomatic to overt acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) were shown to contain high titers of antibodies that mediate ADCC. Not only did patient antibodies bind to surface expressed viral antigens and mediate ADCC against cells chronically infected with human T-lymphotropic virus type IIIB (HTLV-IIIB), but also against cells infected with the divergent HTLV-IIIRF2 and HTLV-IIIMN viral isolates. Similar results were obtained with target cells bearing purified GP 120 from HTLV-IIIB and HTLV-IIIRF2, indicating that a major portion of the activity was mediated by anti-GP 120 antibodies. Consistent with this was the ability to absorb most of the group-specific ADCC activity from the serum of an HIV infected individual using affinity columns bearing purified HTLV-IIIB GP 120. The finding that human antibodies reactive against the HIV envelope glycoprotein mediate ADCC against cells chronically infected with divergent strains of HIV will have important implications in designing rational approaches to passive and active immunotherapy.\r"

Phenol in 2.5 and 5% solutions in three different carriers (water, glycerine and oil) was injected into the rectovesical pouch in 35 rats. After 3 weeks the bladders were excised and the effects on the density of acetylcholinesterase-positive nerves were assessed in each animal using morphometric techniques. The density of enzyme-containing nerves was reduced by 20% in the phenolised animals when compared with controls. This reduction was maximum when water was used as the carrier for either 2.5 or 5% phenol solutions.\r"

The distribution of anti-AChR titers was broadly similar in the two populations, and their sera reacted equally well with AChR in both races. The significantly lower (chi 2 = 14.6; p less than 0.001) median anti-AChR titer in the Chinese population can be accounted for by the higher frequency of ocular cases and lower frequency of moderate or severely affected cases.\r"

The structure of this beta-lactone, termed L-659,699, is (E,E)-11-[3-(hydroxy-methyl)-4-oxo-2-oxytanyl]-3,5,7-trimethyl-2,4 - undecadienenoic acid. A partially purified preparation of cytoplasmic HMG-CoA synthase from rat liver was inhibited by L-659,699 with an IC50 of 0.12 microM. The enzyme HMG-CoA reductase, beta-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase, acetoacetyl-CoA synthetase, and fatty acid synthase were not inhibited to any extent by this compound. In cultured Hep G2 cells, the compound inhibited the incorporation of [14C]acetate into sterols with an IC50 of 6 microM, while incorporation of [3H]mevalonate into sterols in these cells was not affected. The activity of HMG-CoA reductase in the cultured Hep G2 cells was induced in a dose-dependent manner by incubation with L-659,699. A 37-fold increase in reductase was observed after a 24-hr incubation with 62 microM L-659,699. The effect of a number of analogs of L-659,699 on HMG-CoA synthase is also discussed.\r"

The haemodynamic response to laryngoscopy and intubation was partially suppressed: neither arterial pressure nor heart rate exceeded awake values. During stable anaesthesia at the lower infusion rate before surgery, systolic (SAP) and diastolic (DAP) arterial pressures were significantly decreased from awake values (SAP: -47%; DAP: -46%) as a result of decreases in cardiac output (-32%) and systemic vascular resistance (SVR) (-9%). During surgery, with either spontaneous (SV) or intermittent positive pressure (IPPV) ventilation, both infusion rates were associated with decreases in arterial pressures when compared with the awake state. Cardiac output was decreased (SV: -35%, IPPV: -36%) and SVR increased (SV: +22%, IPPV: +45%) at the lower infusion rate; similar changes were observed during the faster infusion rate.\r"

In 20 patients retested 3 1/2 months after treatment the changes in interferon levels tended to parallel the changes in clinical disease activity in 80% of cases. Patients with active skin lesions, arthritis, and renal or haematopoietic involvement tended especially to have increased interferon levels. Interferon levels were directly related to ANA titre and inversely related to serum C3 levels, but not related to serum levels of circulating immune complexes or immunoglobulin. The interferon was shown to be of type alpha. The interferon level can be regarded as one of several parameters reflecting disease activity and may also be related to the prognosis. As it is possible that interferon may be a direct mediator of the pathophysiology of auto-immune disease, we do not recommend the use of interferon or its inducers in the therapy of SLE.\r"

We found no metaphases containing the 13q- abnormality in preparations of phytohemagglutinin (PHA)-stimulated lymphocytes from either patient. In both cases, however, some metaphases from Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-transformed lymphoblastoid cell lines contained the clonal karyotypic abnormality. These observations indicate that B lymphocytes but not T cells are expressed as members of the clonal cohort of cells. Our results strongly suggest that the initial pathogenetic events that led to expansion of the 13q- clone occurred in a progenitor cell capable of giving rise to both hematopoietic and B lymphoid cells.\r"

  ".W": "The purpose of this study was to analyze the expression of B cell growth factor (BCGF) receptors and to elucidate the biologic effects of biochemically purified natural BCGF at the B cell precursor stage of human B lineage lymphoid differentiation. The specific binding of radioiodinated high-mol-wt BCGF (125I-HMW-BCGF) and low-molecular-wt BCGF (125I-LMW-BCGF) to fresh marrow blasts from B cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patients was initially investigated. The estimated number of radioiodinated BCGF molecules bound per blast ranged from undetectable to 24.3 X 10(3) for HMW-BCGF, and from 11.5 X 10(3) to 457.8 X 10(3) for LMW-BCGF. In 3H-TdR incorporation assays, 75% of cases showed a significant response to LMW-BCGF with a median stimulation index of 9.3. By comparison, only 33% of cases showed a significant response to HMW-BCGF with a median stimulation index of 2.4. Subsequently, B cell precursor colony assays were performed to assess and compare the biologic effects of BCGF on leukemic B lineage lymphoid progenitor cells. Among 28 cases studied, 57% responded to both HMW-BCGF and LMW-BCGF, 21% responded only to LMW-BCGF, and the remaining cases showed no proliferative response to either growth factor. The response patterns of virtually pure populations of FACS-sorted leukemic B cell precursors were essentially identical to the proliferative responses of unsorted leukemic B-cell precursors. Synergistic effects between HMW-BCGF and LMW-BCGF were observed in 80% of the cases that responded to both. The numbers of cell-bound radioiodinated BCGF molecules, the stimulation indices, as well as the number of B cell precursor colonies in BCGF-stimulated cultures showed a marked interpatient variation. Patients with structural chromosomal abnormalities (SCAs) involving 12p11-13 or patients with a Philadelphia chromosome showed a greater HMW-BCGF response at the level of leukemic progenitor cells than did other patients (P = .02). The LMW-BCGF response was significantly greater for patients with SCA than for patients without SCA (P = .04). The response of leukemic progenitor cells to HMW-BCGF or LMW-BCGF did not correlate with sex, age, disease status, FAB morphology, WBC at diagnosis, or immunophenotype. To our knowledge, this study represents the first detailed analyses of BCGF receptor expression and BCGF effects in B cell precursor ALL. The data presented provide direct evidence for the expression of functional receptors for both HMW-BCGF and LMW-BCGF in B cell precursor ALL.\r"

  ".W": "Of five IgGI/k murine monoclonal anti-human prekallikrein antibodies produced (MAbs), MAb 13G11 was selected for studying interaction of prekallikrein with factor XII and high-mol-wt kininogen (HMWK) during activation on a surface. Immunoblots from sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) gels showed that this MAb recognizes two variants (88 kd and 85 kd) of prekallikrein and kallikrein both in purified proteins and normal plasma. Under reducing conditions, kallikrein exhibits the epitope on the heavy chain but not on the light chains. Preincubation of MAb 13G11 with prekallikrein (added to prekallikrein-deficient plasma) or with normal plasma inhibited surface activation of prekallikrein 60% to 80%, as judged by amidolytic and coagulant assays. In normal plasma, inhibition by the Fab fragments was 87% of that with the entire MAb. Inhibition was not by competition between the MAb and HMWK, since neither binding of 13G11 to prekallikrein (coated on microtiter plates) was inhibited by an excess of HMWK, nor was hydrolysis of HMWK by kallikrein inhibited by 13G11. Using purified proteins in a system mimicking contact activation, inhibition by 13G11 of prekallikrein activation by factor XIIa, HMWK, and kaolin present was approximately 80%. Decreased inhibition (55% to 25%) occurred without HMWK or when kallikrein was used instead of prekallikrein. Kallikrein activity was not inhibited by 13G11 Fab fragments. These results indicate that the effect of 13G11 in plasma was neither dissociation of prekallikrein-HMWK complex nor a direct effect on kallikrein activity. Similar to the results in plasma, activation of prekallikrein, HMWK present, by factor XIIa bound to kaolin, was inhibited approximately 70% by 13G11. The results suggest a previously unrecognized site on the prekallikrein (heavy chain) required for its interaction with factor XIIa, either shared with the 13G11 epitope or located in very close proximity. The inhibition of kallikrein by intact 13G11 indicates that its binding site on the heavy chain is sterically related to the active site (light chain).\r"

  ".U": "88000991\r", 
  ".W": "The plasminogen activator inhibitor from human endothelial cells (PAI-1) exists in two forms in the culture medium: an active form that binds to and inactivates plasminogen activators and a latent form that in its native state has no anti-activator activity. Inhibitor activity associated with the latent form can be generated by treatment with protein denaturants and makes up more than 98% of the total inhibitor activity in conditioned medium. Plasminogen activator inhibitor activity is also found in cell cytosol. This inhibitor activity is stable to SDS-treatment but is not enhanced by it. We investigated the relationship between this active cell-associated inhibitor and the latent PAI-1 found in the conditioned medium. Both intracellular and extracellular inhibitors were immunoprecipitated by a monoclonal antibody produced against the latent inhibitor from HT1080 fibrosarcoma cells and electrophoresis on SDS gels of various acrylamide concentrations demonstrated that both forms had the same Mr. Incubation of cytosol inhibitor at 37 degrees C resulted in a decline in inhibitor activity with a half-life of approximately 4 hours, a rate of decline similar to that of the active PAI-1 in conditioned medium, with less than 10% of the original activity present after eight hours. This decline is accelerated at higher temperatures and is not affected by the presence of a variety of protease inhibitors. Approximately 90% of the activity can be regenerated after SDS treatment suggesting that the cell associated inhibitor, during incubation at 37 degrees C, converts to a form similar to that found in conditioned medium. Despite these similarities, the apparent Stoke's radii of the active intracellular inhibitor and the latent inhibitor in conditioned medium were significantly different with values of 2.77 nm and 2.40 nm for active and latent PAI-1, respectively. Incubation of the active form at 37 degrees C resulted in the shift of the Stoke's radius to that similar to the latent PAI-1 (2.45 nm). Thus, the active and latent PAI-1, while being immunologically similar and of the same apparent Mr, can be differentiated by their behavior on gel permeation columns. This suggests that the intracellular inhibitor is a precursor to the latent form.\r"

The marrow from those with resurgent hyperplasia contained increased numbers of B cell precursors in multiple stages of differentiation compared to controls, thus providing a useful model system for studies of B cell differentiation. These studies indicate that the quantitative expression of T200 is differentiation-related on normal and malignant B cells and B cell precursors. Immature cells express low amounts of T200, while increasing levels of maturity correlated with increasing amounts of the antigen. This study increases the understanding of relationships between B cell surface antigens and T200 and further demonstrates that B cell hyperplasia occurs commonly in association with bone marrow reactive or resurgent processes. The quantitative, rather than only the qualitative, expression of T200 is therefore a useful marker of B cell differentiation in reactive hyperplasia and in further investigation of B cell malignancy.\r"

  ".W": "A functional study of several human malignant B cell populations has indicated that occasional leukemic clones are extraordinarily sensitive to signal transduction through membrane IgM. One isolated hairy cell leukemia (HCL) with low background DNA synthesis was stimulated to significant levels of DNA synthesis when cultured with high (100 micrograms/mL) concentrations of soluble anti-IgM ligands. In contrast to the activation of normal peripheral blood polyclonal B cells, this DNA synthesis was completely independent of accessory T cell factors. Although the HCL clone could also be induced to enter S phase by incubation in media supplemented with only activated T cell supernatant, culture of the clone with activated T cell supernatant plus anti-IgM Ab resulted in DNA synthesis that was significantly less than that induced by either activator alone. Factor(s) in T cell supernatant appear to modulate the leukemic clone so that the binding of ligand to membrane IgM is perceived as an inhibitory rather than a stimulatory signal for DNA synthesis. In terms of Ig Fc independence and low ligand dose requirements, anti-IgM-mediated inhibitory signal transduction in the T cell supernatant-activated HCL clone was found to mimic anti-IgM mediated suppression of the spontaneous DNA synthesis of an alternative HCL clone. The functional results suggest that the type of signal transduced anti-Ig ligands may reflect differences in the activation state of receptive leukemic B cells.\r"

We studied the respective role of both plasma and platelet vWF in mediating platelet adhesion to fibrillar collagen in a parallel-plate perfusion chamber. Reconstituted blood containing RBCs, various mixtures of labeled washed platelets and plasma from controls or five patients with severe von Willebrand disease (vWD), was perfused through the chamber for five minutes at a shear rate of 1,600 s-1. Platelet-collagen interactions were estimated by counting the radioactivity in deposited platelets and by quantitative morphometry. When the perfusate consisted of normal platelets suspended in normal plasma, platelet deposition on the collagen was 24.7 +/- 3.6 X 10(6)/cm2 (mean +/- SEM, n = 6). Significantly less deposition (16 +/- 2.3) was observed when vWD platelets were substituted for normal platelets. In mixtures containing vWD plasma, significantly greater deposition (9 +/- 2.2) was obtained with normal than with vWD platelets (1 +/- 0.4) demonstrating a role for platelet vWF in mediating the deposition of platelets on collagen. Morphometric analysis confirmed these data. Our findings indicate that platelet, as well as plasma, vWF mediates platelet-collagen interactions at a high shear rate.\r"

The conditioned media contained interleukin-1 (IL-1) bioactivity and the endothelial cell stimulatory activity was partially neutralized by anti-IL-1 antiserum. Constitutive expression of the IL-1-beta gene was detected in ten of 17 AML cases analyzed. These results suggest that the unregulated secretion of IL-1 by AML cells can induce stromal cells in vitro to overproduce CSFs. This could contribute to the unrestricted growth of AML cells.\r"

  ".W": "Erythroid colonies from five patients with an early erythroblastic leukemia were obtained in \"serum-free\" cultures in the presence or absence of recombinant granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and homogeneous native erythropoietin (Epo). Erythroid colonies with abnormal morphology and karyotype could be grown in different culture conditions. Their erythroid nature was ascertained by the presence of carbonic anhydrase I and glycophorin A. Leukemic erythroid progenitors strongly differed from normal progenitors in that spontaneous colonies were always obtained, sometimes with an extremely high plating efficiency (up to 5.7%). Colonies were found to be autonomous from exogenous hematopoietic growth factors because they were still obtained with a high plating efficiency at an average of one cell per culture in the absence of any added growth factor. No evidence for an autocrine secretion of Epo or GM-CSF emerged because Epo or GM-CSF could not be detected by biologic or radioimmunologic assays from the culture supernatant or cellular extracts of the leukemic cells and that Epo or GM-CSF antibodies did not block autonomous growth. In all cases, however, hematopoietic growth factors increased the plating efficiency of the abnormal erythroid progenitors. In the two \"de novo\" leukemias, leukemic erythroid progenitors responded primarily to Epo, whereas in the three other patients' (chronic myeloid leukemia) blast crisis they responded maximally to GM-CSF plus Epo. Recombinant erythroid-potentiating activity had no effect in any of these cases. These results suggest that the leukemic erythroid clonogenic cells arise from expansion of erythroid progenitors at different levels of differentiation (ie, CFU-E or BFU-E, depending upon the disease) and that autonomous growth is not related to a secretion of Epo or GM-CSF.\r"

However, important differences between the vWF-platelet interactions induced by these two agents have suggested that different regions of vWF and the platelet may be involved in the interactions induced by the two agonists. We have recently demonstrated that binding of vWF to the platelet glycoprotein (GP) Ib receptor, either induced by ristocetin or as occurs spontaneously with asialo-vWF or vWF from IIb von Willebrand disease, is mediated by a domain residing on a 52/48-kilodalton (kD) tryptic fragment of vWF. This fragment extends from amino acid residue Val (449) to Lys (728). We have now found that this 52/48-kD fragment blocks botrocetin-induced binding of vWF to platelets and completely inhibits botrocetin-induced platelet agglutination. These results provide evidence that the vWF domain-mediating, botrocetin-induced platelet agglutination lies within the region delimited by this fragment and is therefore close to or identical with that which mediates ristocetin-induced binding and spontaneous binding of vWF to platelet GPIb. Anti-GPIb monoclonal antibodies also blocked agglutination, which showed that botrocetin, like ristocetin, induces binding of vWF to the GPIb receptor.\r"

The nature of the endothelium-derived relaxing factor (EDRF) has not been ascertained because it is very labile (reported half-life 6-50 seconds). To obtain a stable source of EDRF, a system was developed in which the relaxing factor was continuously produced by freshly harvested porcine endothelial cells. Endothelial cells were collected from aortas by exposing the endothelial lining to collagenase 0.1%. Cells were washed and concentrated by repeated centrifugation to obtain a high cell count (7.2 X 10(6) cells/ml). Endothelium-deprived aortic strips from rabbits were incubated in these cells suspended in tissue culture medium and fetal calf serum. The strips were precontracted with histamine. Acetylcholine was added to induce EDRF release. Significant relaxation of endothelium-deprived aortic strips was observed. Superoxide dismutase, an enzyme known to protect EDRF against inactivation, caused further relaxation, which was inhibited by the addition of hemoglobin, an agent known to inhibit the relaxing action of EDRF. Even without the addition of acetylcholine, hemoglobin caused contraction of the denuded aortic strips in suspension of porcine endothelial cells, demonstrating spontaneous EDRF release. Hemoglobin had no effect in cell-free medium. Endothelial-cell-dependent relaxation occurred without attachment of endothelial cells to the endothelium-deprived aortic strips: when the cell suspension was replaced by cell-free medium, relaxation did not occur after acetylcholine. Scanning electron microscopy showed no attachment of endothelial cells to the subendothelial layer. It can be concluded that freshly harvested endothelial cells produce endothelium-derived relaxing factor with an without stimulation by acetylcholine.\r"

The patients underwent cardiac and respiratory gated MR scans in a 0.5 tesla magnet with an echo time of 22 msec and two repetitions in a 128 X 256 matrix. In-plane resolution was 2.7 mm. Every patient had a scan in the transaxial plane and some underwent scanning in the sagittal and coronal planes as well. A graft was considered patent by MR when a signal-free lumen was visualized in an anatomic position consistent with that of a bypass graft, had a lumen larger than the native vessels, was seen on more than one slice, and was seen at a level higher than that of the native vessels. If a known graft was not seen it was considered occluded. The scans were interpreted by consensus of two physicians aware of the operative but not the cardiac catheterization data.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

We have developed a method for non-invasive measurement of lung tissue mass, thoracic blood and interstitial volumes by a combination of transmission and emission scanning with technetium isotope (99mTc). 2. In a lung model we demonstrated that emission counts could be successfully corrected for attenuation with data obtained by transmission scanning, despite an uneven distribution of radioactivity and attenuation in the model. 3. In dogs we compared regional transthoracic tissue thickness, measured by transmission scanning, and regional 'thickness' of blood measured by transmission/emission scanning with direct gravimetric measurements made post mortem. Scanning and direct measurements correlated significantly. 4. In man we used a [99mTc]pertechnetate (99mTcO4) flood source to obtain antero-posterior transmission scans with a gamma-camera. The thickness of attenuating tissue was estimated in each pixel. Scans were obtained of thoracic blood (by labelling erythrocytes with 99mTcO4) and of interstitium (with 99mTc-labelled diethylenetriaminepenta-acetic acid and subtraction of the blood image). We used a computer program to correct the emission scans for attenuation using the transmission scan derived tissue thickness, pixel by pixel. Finally we took a lateral chest radiograph to estimate chest wall thickness. 5. In normal man lung tissue thickness at hilar level was 3.1 +/- 0.5 cm (n = 8). Thoracic blood thickness increased from the apex downwards in the upright lung, being 1.2 +/- 0.1 cm at the hilar level and 2.0 +/- 0.3 cm at the lung base. Interstitial thickness was 0.8 +/- 0.3 cm at the hilum and 0.85 +/- 0.2 at the base. These values compare well with data in the literature.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Postoperative wound infections (sternal and leg wounds) were studied in each treatment group. In the cefamandole study group, 27 patients (1.8 percent) developed postoperative wound infections (9 sternal and 18 leg wounds). In the cefuroxime treatment group, 19 patients (1.2 percent) developed postoperative wound infections (9 sternal and 10 leg wounds). Overall, no statistical difference was found between the two antibiotics in preventing postoperative wound infections. However, in patients having valve replacement surgery, cefuroxime was found statistically more effective than cefamandole prophylaxis in preventing sternal wound infections (no infections in 284 patients compared with five infections in 205 patients, respectively, p = 0.01). The most common organism isolated from infected wounds with cefamandole was Staphylococcus aureus followed by S. epidermidis compared with cefuroxime which had S. epidermidis followed by S. aureus. Cefuroxime was found to be as effective as cefamandole and considerably less expensive in preventing postoperative wound infections in patients undergoing open-heart surgery.\r"

Relationships between extracellular calcium ([Ca2+]e), cytosolic free calcium ([Ca2+]i) (as measured with fura-2), and secretion of immunoreactive CGRP and CT have been investigated in rat and human MTC cell lines. Rat MTC 6-23 cells responded to a rise in [Ca2+]e from 0.5 to 3.0 mM with a transient increase of [Ca2+]i, and the secretion of CGRP and CT was raised from 19 +/- 2 (mean +/- SE) to 122 +/- 28 pg rat CGRP/mg protein . min and from 33 +/- 8 to 155 +/- 42 pg rat CT/mg protein . min (P less than 0.01). In the human MTC (TT) cell line, a rise of [Ca2+]e from 0.5 to 3.0 mM did not affect [Ca2+]i, and the secretion of CGRP and CT remained unchanged at 7.0 +/- 1.1 ng CGRP/mg protein . min and 1.0 +/- 0.1 ng CT/mg protein . min. However, when the plasma membrane was bypassed by electropermeabilization, the release of CGRP and CT was stimulated by calcium with an ED50 of 0.5 microM and 0.3 microM, respectively. With ionomycin, the secretion of CGRP and CT was also stimulated up to 17-fold in [Ca2+]i-dependent manner. The results indicate a role of [Ca2+]i in the secretion of CGRP and CT and provide evidence for a defect in Ca2+ signal transduction in the human MTC cell line.\r"

  ".U": "88004293\r", 
  ".W": "Recent investigations have indicated that luteal cells of pregnant rats become capable of synthesizing androgen and estradiol when stimulated by sustained low levels of LH/hCG. In this investigation we sought 1) to determine whether hCG causes the induction/activation of the luteal enzymes responsible for the conversion of progesterone to estradiol, 2) to investigate the time course of hCG action, and 3) to compare the effect of hCG on luteal and follicular P45017 alpha activities. To determine first the minimum stimulatory dose of hCG, pregnant rats were treated with 0, 1.5, 3, 9, or 30 IU hCG twice on days 12 and 13 and once on day 14. Two hours after the last injection, rats were bled from the ovarian vein, and corpora lutea were isolated and incubated for the determination of in vitro steroid production. Exposure of rats to twice daily injections of 1.5 IU hCG caused a dramatic increase in the ovarian secretion and luteal production of both testosterone and estradiol. However, an inverse dose-related response was observed with higher doses of hCG. To determine the time course of hCG action, pregnant rats were injected with a single dose of 3 IU hCG, and steroid production was determined at different times thereafter. There was no increase in either in vivo or in vitro testosterone and estradiol production until 12 h after hCG administration, at which time a dramatic increase in the secretion of both steroids was observed. hCG administration did not affect the capacity of luteal cells to secrete progesterone, nor did it enhance aromatase activity. It did, however, increase P45017 alpha activities; lyase and hydroxylase activities were stimulated 5- and 1.7-fold, respectively. To compare the effects of hCG on luteal and follicular P45017 alpha, both corpora lutea and follicles were isolated from ovaries of pregnant rats treated with either 1.5 IU hCG or vehicle between days 12-14. In vivo hCG administration caused at least a 1000-fold increase in the specific activity of follicular 17 alpha-hydroxylase and 17,20-lyase. The hCG-induced increase in the specific activities of both hydroxylase and lyase in the follicle far exceeded that in the corpora lutea. However, total lyase and hydroxylase activities in each follicle were only 3- and 5.5-fold higher, respectively, than those in the corpus luteum. In summary, the results of the present investigation have revealed that hCG stimulation of luteal estradiol production is due to a selective effect of this gonadotropin on P45017 alpha.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Intact rats exposed to low or moderate intensity electroshocks for 3-5 h showed a marked increase in plasma ACTH levels 10 min after the beginning of the stress, followed by a decline despite continuous exposure to the stimulus. We have explored the role of steroid feedback, desensitization of the pituitary response to CRF, or changes in pituitary ACTH content in mediating this phenomenon. The following results were obtained. Exposure of adrenalectomized rats to shocks showed that removal of steroid feedback did not restore the ability of the animals to maintain elevated levels of circulating ACTH during electroshocks. To determine whether prolonged stress caused changes in pituitary sensitivity to CRF, intact rats received CRF, epinephrine, vasopressin, or phorbol ester at the end of the 3-h shock session; all secretagogues caused a significantly smaller increase in the plasma ACTH levels in intact rats subjected to low or moderate intensity shocks compared to that of control animals, which suggested that there was no specific desensitization to CRF. By contrast, pituitary responsiveness to CRF was not significantly altered in adrenalectomized rats submitted to low intensity shocks for 1-3 h; however, when moderate intensity shocks were used, adrenalectomized rats showed a blunting of the response to CRF comparable to that in intact animals. Finally, we observed a comparable decrease in the pituitary ACTH content of intact or adrenalectomized rats exposed to electroshocks; this decrease was proportional to the length and intensity of the shocks. We conclude that the inability of continuously stressed rats to maintain elevated plasma ACTH levels appears to be mediated through both the temporary decrease in a readily releasable pituitary ACTH pool and the negative feedback exerted by corticosterone.\r"

Peak CRF values of 77.9 +/- 6.4 pg/ml occurred in the evening at 1930 h, while the CRF nadir (38.4 +/- 4.2 pg/ml) occurred at 0745 h. Simultaneously sampled CSF cortisol peaked at 0913 h, with a nadir at 2226 h. Both CRF and cortisol rhythms closely fit sinusoidal circadian models, with r2 values of 0.94 and 0.92, respectively. While hypothalamic CRF is regarded as a major physiological regulator of pituitary ACTH secretion and, thereby, of the circadian and stress-related release of cortisol from the adrenal gland, CRF and CRF receptors are also widely distributed in other brain areas of primates and rodents. The marked difference in the circadian rhythm of CRF vs. that of cortisol suggests that CRF in CSF reflects or mediates some nonhypophysiotropic brain functions of this peptide.\r"

This was then reacted with gelonin to form a product, which contained 20 mol [Nle21,38,Arg36]rCRF/mol gelonin, as indicated by amino acid analysis. Efficacy and specificity of the gelonin-[Nle21,38,Arg36]rCRF conjugate were assessed in cultured rat anterior pituitary cells 3 days after a 12-h exposure to the cytotoxic conjugate, CRF, or gelonin. While pretreatment with the cytotoxic gelonin-[Nle21,38,Arg36]rCRF conjugate decreased cellular ACTH content by 74%, pretreatment with appropriate concentrations of CRF had no significant effect on cellular ACTH content. The ACTH secretory response to 2.5 nM CRF was completely eliminated by pretreatment with the gelonin-[Nle21,38,Arg36]rCRF conjugate; in contrast, pretreatment with identical doses of CRF had minimal effect. Neither pretreatment with CRF nor pretreatment with the gelonin-[Nle21,38,Arg36] rCRF conjugate had any effect on the content of LH or the LH secretory response to GnRH. These results indicate the efficacy and specificity of the conjugate of [Nle21,38,Arg36]rCRF to gelonin in eliminating CRF target cells.\r"

Affinity labeling with [125I]iodo-EGF and subsequent cross-linking with disuccinimidyl suberate demonstrated the specific binding of [125I]iodo-EGF to a macromolecule with a mol wt of 170,000. Castration of mature rats resulted in a 3- to 6-fold increase in [125I]iodo-EGF binding, while treatment of 7-day castrated rats with 5 alpha-dihydrotestosterone decreased the number of binding sites. Administration of estrogen or progesterone produced a slight decrease in EGF binding sites but not nearly to the extent observed with 5 alpha-dihydrotestosterone, suggesting that the observed effect is androgen specific. These results demonstrate that rat prostate contains specific binding sites for EGF and that their level is modulated by androgens.\r"

Binding studies using [125I]EGF were performed on isolated epithelial cells obtained from 2-, 5-, 9-, 16-, and 22-day-old mice as well as adults. At 2 days, cells isolated from the entire colon bound 4 times more [125I]EGF than did corresponding intestinal cells, whereas between the ages of 5 days to adult, colonic cells bound between 1.7-2.5 times more labeled EGF than their intestinal counterparts. The immature colon already exhibited maximal binding after birth as opposed to the small intestine where binding only reached maximal values by the third week of life. Comparison between the proximal and distal colon in 9-, 16-, and 22-day-old mice revealed a further 2-fold increase in EGF binding in the distal colon compared to that in the proximal colon. Scatchard plots of [125I]EGF displacement by native EGF in both proximal and distal colonic segments also revealed the presence of two classes of binding sites, with high affinity constants (K1) significantly greater in the distal colon. These results demonstrate for the first time not only the continued presence of EGF receptors in mouse colonic epithelium, but also significant regional differences in EGF-binding capacity within the digestive tract throughout the postnatal period.\r"

Electrical field stimulation of the control rat ileum caused a significant increase in the release of all the above substances from the enteric nerves. The electrically evoked, but not the basal, release of these substances was inhibited by tetrodotoxin. In the diabetic rat ileum, however, there was no increase in the release of vasoactive intestinal polypeptide and calcitonin gene-related peptide during electrical stimulation, whereas endogenous release of acetylcholine, serotonin, and substance P was unaffected by the diabetic state. This was surprising in view of the increased fluorescence intensity and tissue content of vasoactive intestinal polypeptide-like immunoreactivity in the same tissue reported previously. The lack of increase in evoked release of vasoactive intestinal polypeptide in the diabetic preparations might be due to an impaired mechanism of release at the terminal site or to defective axonal transport of the peptide, whereas in the case of calcitonin gene-related peptide, it might be the result of the low level of the peptide present in the enteric nerve fibers of the diabetic rat ileum. The differential effect of diabetes on enteric nerves is discussed.\r"

Histologic examination of antral biopsy specimens revealed a diffuse capillary ectasia without inflammation in 8 of the 11 cirrhotic patients with gastric lesions. Morphometric analysis disclosed a significantly greater mean mucosal capillary cross-sectional area in cirrhotic patients with gastric lesions (mean +/- SE, 1371 +/- 320 microns2) than in those without gastric lesions (541 +/- 61 microns2) (p less than 0.005) or controls (353 +/- 20 microns2) (p less than 0.001). Hypergastrinemia was detected in 8 of the 11 cirrhotic patients with lesions, in 2 of the 18 cirrhotic patients without gastric lesions, and in none of the controls (p less than 0.001). Gastrin serum levels correlated significantly (r = 0.80) with mean mucosal capillary cross-sectional area in patients with cirrhosis. Pepsinogen I serum levels below 20 ng/ml were observed in 7 of the 11 cirrhotic patients with lesions, in 1 of the 18 cirrhotic patients without lesions, and in none of the controls. These data indicate that bleeding from gastric red spots in patients with cirrhosis is a distinct entity characterized by vascular ectasia of the gastric mucosa. This condition seems to be associated with hypergastrinemia and low serum levels of pepsinogen I.\r"

  ".W": "An epidemiologic study of inflammatory bowel disease was conducted in Regio Leiden, the Netherlands, between 1979 and 1983. Archives of endoscopy, radiology, pathology, and specialist letters were reviewed for suspected patients with inflammatory bowel disease, together with a survey of all general practitioners to verify completeness of data. One thousand forty patients were identified and each diagnosis was reviewed. Two hundred ten patients had Crohn's disease and 257 had ulcerative colitis. Of the other 573 patients, the largest proportion (21%) had incomplete data for disease classification. Others had irritable bowel syndrome, diverticulitis, or ischemic or irradiation colitis; some were nonresident patients with inflammatory bowel disease treated within the region and others were out of the period for inclusion in this investigation. The incidence of Crohn's disease was 3.9 per 10(5) per year and the period prevalence was 48 per 10(5). The sex-specific incidence was similar, although the disease was significantly more common in women aged 20-29 yr. The prevalence in the city municipalities of Leiden and Alphen on the Rijn (63 per 10(5)) was similar but significantly greater than in suburban (39 per 10(5)) or agarian areas (40 per 10(5)). This may be partially due to urban density but not to differences in water supply. The lack of cases in the migrant population almost reaches significant levels, but studies in locations with a higher migrant population may clarify the issue.\r"

Preoperative investigations followed a regime consisting of endoscopy, barium meal and follow through, small bowel enema, 99mTc pertechnetate scan, 99mTc-labelled red blood cell scan and selective coeliac and mesenteric angiography. Bleeding lesions were localised preoperatively in 36 patients. In one patient, diagnostic laparotomy had to be carried out immediately before any investigation because the bleeding was severe. At operation, angiosarcoma of ileum was found. Unless preoperative investigations showed the lesions to be in anatomically fixed organs like the duodenum or colon, the lesions had still to be found at operation. Palpation and transillumination detected the lesion intraoperatively in 21 patients while only some lesions were found in three patients with multiple lesions. Sigmoidoscopy through enterotomies was required in one patient. Intraoperative enteroscopy was done for small lesions not found grossly at operation in nine patients, to detect additional lesions in three patients or to rule out suspicious lesion shown on preoperative tests in one patient. In another patient with diffuse lymphoma of small bowel with bleeding from only a small segment of jejunum, injection of methylene blue intraoperatively through a previously placed angiographic catheter stained the bleeding segment of jejunum blue. This segment was identified easily and resected. These preoperative and intraoperative localisation procedures were simple and effective and we recommend them to be used more freely.\r"

  ".W": "Endoscopic injection sclerotherapy was given to 155 patients with esophageal varices mainly related to non-alcoholic liver cirrhosis. The formation of a superficial ulcer in the lower esophagus was achieved in 141 (91.0%) of the 155 patients, with an average of 4.1 sessions of endoscopic injection sclerotherapy during an average time of 4.9 weeks. The average volume of 5% ethanolamine oleate sclerosant used was 24.8, 19.2, 12.3 and 6.5 ml for the initial to fourth sessions of endoscopic injection sclerotherapy, respectively. For 14 patients, a sufficient number of sessions of endoscopic injection sclerotherapy could not be given: 10 early deaths (5 hepatoma, 4 liver failure and 1 gastric bleeding), and 4 refused further sessions. When the esophageal mucosa had been eliminated and a superficial ulcer had formed, episodes of recurrent bleeding or recurrence of esophageal varices were nil over a median follow-up of 14.6 months, with a range of 1 to 27 months. In seven patients, bleeding recurred before elimination of the mucosa could be achieved, but these bleeding episodes were well controlled with an additional session of endoscopic injection sclerotherapy. At the time of analysis, there were 36 deaths (20 hepatoma, 14 liver failure and 2 gastric bleeding) among these 155 patients. Thus, the mean follow-up was 16.3 months (range: 7 to 27 months) in the 119 survivors, with no recurrence of the varices. We propose that removal of the esophageal mucosa may well be the endpoint of repeated endoscopic injection sclerotherapy in the management of patients on injection sclerotherapy.\r"

We have determined the frequencies and functional phenotypes of autoreactive T-lymphocytes in peripheral blood specimens from patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis and healthy adults as an indicator of autoreactivity in primary sclerosing cholangitis. We found a significant increase in the percentage of autoreactive suppressor/cytotoxic T-lymphocytes that become activated in the T-, non-T-autologous mixed lymphocyte reaction in primary sclerosing cholangitis patients (p less than 0.002). Blastogenesis in autologous mixed lymphocyte reaction cultures from primary sclerosing cholangitis patients was significantly decreased (p less than 0.02), and the magnitude of the decrease correlated directly with the percentage of activated suppressor/cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (r = 0.56, p less than 0.01). The percentage of autoreactive, suppressor T-lymphocytes was increased in autologous mixed lymphocyte reaction cultures from primary sclerosing cholangitis patients (p less than 0.0001); and suppression of mitogen-induced blastogenesis by autologous concanavalin A-treated mononuclear cells was significantly enhanced. These results, which were unrelated to the histologic stage of liver disease and the presence or absence of active colitis, document the presence of an expanded population of T-lymphocytes in the peripheral blood of patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis that became activated on exposure to autologous major histocompatibility antigens in the autologous mixed lymphocyte reaction. We hypothesize that these autoreactive cells may be a marker or may participate as effector cells in cell-mediated autoimmunity in primary sclerosing cholangitis.\r"

Various Class II antigens of the major histocompatibility complex are associated with autoimmune diseases and their differing clinical manifestations. Thus, the aim of this study was to examine the relationship between primary biliary cirrhosis, its clinical manifestations and serologically defined Class II antigens (HLA-DR and HLA-DQ). Typing for these antigens was performed in 114 primary biliary cirrhotic patients and 171 controls by lymphocytotoxicity. There was a 6-fold increase in the frequency of HLA-DRw8 in primary biliary cirrhosis as compared to controls [30.1 vs. 4.7% (p less than 0.0001)]. In contrast, HLA-DR5 had a decreased frequency in primary biliary cirrhosis as compared to controls [9.8 vs. 25.2% (p less than 0.02)]. We examined the relationship between Class II antigens and the following prognostic indicators in primary biliary cirrhosis: serum bilirubin; 24-hr urine copper; serum albumin; prothrombin time; platelet count; ascites, and histologic stage (I to IV). Patients who are positive for HLA-DRw52 (n = 82) had a 2-fold increase in serum bilirubin compared to those who are negative (n = 32) for this antigen (p less than 0.05). Conversely, patients who are positive for HLA-DR2 had less than half the serum bilirubin values of those negative for this antigen (p less than 0.02). In conclusion, we found different Class II antigens to be associated with a prognostic indicator in primary biliary cirrhosis (serum bilirubin), while HLA-DRw8 is strongly associated with the disease itself.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

We wanted to test this hypothesis of a major gravity-independent gradient in lung blood flow in experiments with direct measurement of macroaggregate distribution in the dog lung. In six anesthetized (4 prone spontaneously breathing, 2 mechanically ventilated) dogs we injected 111In-labeled albumin macroaggregates intravenously. We killed the dogs, removed, inflated, and froze the lower lobes. We sliced the lobes 1 cm thick and made gamma camera images of the slices. We then cut three or four slices in each lobe into two or three concentric layers and measured the radioactivity per gram of tissue in a well-type gamma counter. In three of the dogs we also labeled the red cells (99mTc) so that blood volume in each sample could be determined. The gamma camera images were acquired on a 64 X 64 matrix with 4 X 4 mm pixels. On the numeric printouts from the individual slices we made two or three concentric layers and calculated activity per pixel in each layer. Neither by the well counting nor by the pixel analysis of the gamma scans did we detect any gravity-independent distribution of blood flow. With the well counting the distribution was the same whether macroaggregate activity was expressed per gram of tissue or per gram of blood-free tissue. We conclude that by direct measurements no major gravity-independent gradient of pulmonary blood flow can be detected in dog lungs.\r"

Tomography was performed on each subject from 120 projections of radioactivity in the lungs acquired with a rotating gamma camera. To minimize lung motion artifacts, the subjects were asked to hold their breath at end expiration during the 10-s duration of data acquisition in each projectional angle. Perfusion images of lung slices (11 mm thick) were reconstructed, and the radioactivity within each slice was expressed per unit lung volume of 3.7 X 3.7 X 11 mm. Perfusion images of a midcoronal slice from each subject manifested a concentric pattern of radioactivity that decreased significantly from the center to the periphery, suggesting that blood flow rate per unit lung volume was up to 10 times larger near the central region. This gradient in activity between the center and the periphery of the coronary slices was gravity independent as the subjects were supine. Images of sagittal slices from the middle of the right lung also manifested a similar pattern of concentric gradient in activity, with the vertical distribution (gravity related) almost comparable with the horizontal distribution (gravity independent). These results indicate that pulmonary blood flow in resting supine humans is spatially stratified with a marked central-to-peripheral gradient in all directions. It appears that zone 4 (reduced blood flow) is not a phenomenon limited to the dependent region of the lung as commonly thought but rather is a manifestation of this spatial distribution whereby blood flow is lowest in all peripheral regions of the lung.\r"

In rats and goats, autograft, allograft and glycerol-preserved allograft veins were used to replace lengths of common iliac and carotid arteries. After various periods of time these were retrieved and examined using light microscopy and scanning electron microscopy. Appearances were found to correlate well with function. All allograft vessels were found to have failed. Over 70% of autografts were functional in both species and all of these had re-endothelialised. In rats, all of the glycerol-preserved grafts had failed but in goats 64% were patent at 6 months but did not show signs of a neointima. In larger animals, glycerol-preserved vein allografts appear to offer an acceptable form of arterial replacement where fresh vein autograft is unavailable.\r"

In 20 aneurysm patients the C-reactive protein was 56 +/- 10 mg/l, alpha 1-proteinase inhibitor 2.5 +/- 0.13 g/l and ceruloplasmin 0.41 +/- 0.01 g/l. In 20 patients with stenosing aortic disease the C-reactive protein was 28 +/- 8 mg/l, alpha 1-proteinase inhibitor 1.65 +/- 0.11 g/l and ceruloplasmin 0.35 +/- 0.03 g/l. These results argue for the participation of an inflammatory process in the aortic wall in the pathogenesis of all aneurysms.\r"

  ".W": "It is well recognized that patients with abdominal aortic aneurysms have a high incidence of coronary artery disease, and that the major cause of death in patients undergoing aneurysmectomy has been acute myocardial infarction. In order to assess the incidence of significant coronary artery disease, cardiac catheterization was performed on 42 consecutive patients with abdominal aortic aneurysms. Thirty-six patients (85.7%) had significant anatomic coronary artery disease. Interestingly, all 8 patients with ejection fractions of less than 50% had triple vessel disease or left main disease, and 12 of 34 patients with ejection fractions greater than or equal to 50% had triple vessel disease or left main disease. Of the 30 patients who were NYHA Class I or Class II, 14 (46.7%) had triple vessel disease or left main disease. All 20 patients with triple vessel disease or left main disease underwent myocardial revascularization 7 to 10 days prior to abdominal aneurysmectomy. No patients had a perioperative myocardial infarction either following coronary artery bypass surgery or abdominal aortic aneurysm resection, and there were no operative mortalities. Although this was not a randomized study, it would seem from these results that in selected patients, myocardial revascularization prior to abdominal aneurysmectomy can decrease the incidence of acute myocardial infarction and also decrease operative mortality. It is presently recommended that all symptomatic patients, patients with ejection fractions of less than 50%, and asymptomatic patients with ejection fractions of greater than or equal to 50% with positive exercise radionuclide angiography undergo cardiac catheterization prior to aneurysmectomy, and those patients with left main disease or severe coronary artery disease undergo myocardial revascularization prior to aneurysm resection.\r"

  ".W": "A new method for continuous on-line measurement (COMS) of systemic vascular resistance (SVR) utilizing simple computer analysis of the peripheral arterial waveform is presented. The fundamental equation of this method is: (Formula: see text) where SVR is systemic vascular resistance, dP/dt is the peak dP/dt of the peripheral arterial waveform, and P' is the pressure at the time of peak dP/dt. F and a are calibration constants determined by taking simultaneous measurements by an independent method (thermodilution) before (low SVR) and immediately after (high SVR) aortocoronary bypass operations. In 22 patients 255 COMS of SVR readings were recorded simultaneously with thermodilution cardiac output measurements. Patients were exposed to situations such as temperature changes, volume load, blood loss, and the effect of drugs such as various catecholamines, nitroglycerin, and nitroprusside. Linear regression analysis was performed to compare the SVR calculated from thermodilution with the COMS-SVR measurements. SVR values ranged from 450 to 4400 dynes/sec/-5 and correlation between COMS and thermodilution was r = 0.98. Correlation coefficients of individual patients ranged from r = 0.9 to r = 0.986. We found COMS SVR measurements accurate, reliable, and extremely helpful in the management of hemodynamically unstable patients.\r"

To elucidate this point, we analyzed 196 patients with LMCAD who underwent myocardial revascularization between January 1975 and December 1981, 98 by IMA and SVG and 98 by SVG, IMA was used most often to bypass the left anterior descending (LAD). Chi Square and \"t\" tests were performed on all demographic, cardiac and operative data comparing IMA to SVG. All results were non-significant, indicating that the two groups were comparable. Anginal pattern was progressive or unstable in 93%. IMA was used in 4 patients who were on intra-aortic balloon pump. The mean number bypass grafts per patient was 3.1. Postoperative complications were comparable for both groups, including early and late myocardial infarction. Overall operative mortality was 2.6%. Results of a survival analysis indicated no significant difference in the mortality rates of patients operated on by SVG versus IMA-SVG. Cumulative mortality rates at a mean followup of 20.5 months were 12.2% for SVG and 7.1% for IMA patients. Significant mortality risk factors were ejection fraction less than 55% (p less than 0.05); and perioperative myocardial infarction (p less than 0.001). Twenty-five patients with recurrent chest pain underwent repeat cardiac catheterization. This revealed 10 of 10 patent IMA grafts, 6 of 8 single patent SVG to LAD and 6 of 9 patent sequential vein grafts to the diagonal and LAD arteries.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "To understand the molecular basis for hemophilia B in patients with little or no circulating Factor IX antigen, a patient who had less than 0.2% circulating Factor IX antigen (Factor IXSeattle 2) was selected for analysis of his Factor IX gene. Genomic DNA fragments from the abnormal gene were cloned into bacteriophage lambda vectors and recombinant phage were identified using radiolabeled genomic probes obtained from the normal Factor IX gene. The exons and flanking regions of the abnormal gene were sequenced by the dideoxy chain-termination method and this sequence was compared with that of the normal gene. Only one significant difference was observed, the deletion of a single adenine nucleotide in exon V. This resulted in a frameshift that converted an aspartic acid at position 85 in the protein to a valine and the formation of a stop signal at position 86. These data indicate that the gene for Factor IXSeattle 2 codes for an 85 residue polypeptide that terminates after the first epidermal growth factor domain. Thus, the putative Factor IXSeattle 2 polypeptide lacks the second epidermal growth factor domain, the activation peptide, and the catalytic domain present in the normal protein. This provides an explanation for the coagulation disorder in this patient and represents the first report of a single nucleotide deletion and frameshift resulting in hemophilia B.\r"

An accurate detection and analysis of this extensive polymorphism is essential for optimal HLA typing for transplantation and for a reevaluation of HLA-disease association. Because of the limitations of the current typing methods, including restriction fragment length polymorphisms, we have proposed a DNA typing procedure based on hybridization with loci- and allele-specific oligonucleotides. Here we present a much simpler way of analyzing class II micropolymorphism down to the level of single nucleotide differences. RNA oligonucleotide typing (ROT) relies on RNA dot blots and requires 10-20 ml of blood. It is shown that with appropriate oligonucleotide probes, ROT can reliably and unambiguously identify any polymorphism at any of the HLA loci, including new alleles, not identified with previous methods. This illustrates the importance of oligonucleotide typing to optimize HLA matching, in particular for transplantation involving unrelated donors.\r"

PBMC also inhibited HF activation by glass or sulfatides. Contaminating platelets may have contributed to inhibition by PBMC. Elaboration of agents inhibiting HF activation required metabolically active cells. The inhibitor(s) in PBMC supernates were not identified with known agents, but had properties of a nonenzymatic protein. PBMC supernates did not contain fibrinogen, nor alter the thrombin, prothrombin, or partial thromboplastin times of normal plasma, amidolysis by activated plasma thromboplastin antecedent (Factor XIa) or activated Stuart factor (Factor Xa) or esterolysis by C1 (C1 esterase); they inhibited plasmin minimally. These experiments suggest that peripheral blood cells may impede intravascular coagulation. Whether this property helps maintain the fluidity of blood is unclear.\r"

In 7 of the 100 B cell specimens, a single nongermline band was detected after digestion with the restriction enzyme BamHI, but the rearrangement could be confirmed with a second restriction enzyme in only two. The B cell fragments were small in size and of limited size diversity when compared with the T cell cases, and germline bands of equal intensity were present. A rearrangement of the T gamma gene was never seen in a B cell sample. In contrast, T cell specimens usually rearranged both alleles of T beta (15 of 18), the rearrangement could be confirmed with a second restriction enzyme (17 of 18), both alleles of the first constant region gene segment of T beta always underwent either rearrangement or deletion, and the T gamma gene was also rearranged or deleted (17 of 18). We conclude that ordered rearrangement of the T cell receptor is a rare event in B cell lymphoma and B-CLL. T cell receptor gene studies allow B and T cell lymphomas to be distinguished from each other and from common acute lymphoblastic leukemia antigen-positive non-T, non-B acute lymphoblastic leukemia.\r"

The incidence of bleeding in these patients was three times higher than in those who were not on NSAIDs. The effect of indomethacin, 150 mg/day, on the upper gastrointestinal tract was examined in a prospective study of 75 patients with acute musculoskeletal disorders. Endoscopy after 1 week of therapy showed that 45% had mucosal damage in the duodenum, and this was as frequent and as severe as the gastric mucosal damage.

  ".U": "88009064\r", 
  ".W": "The question of the biologic significance of asialo-GM1 (aGM1) expression by a limited number of cells including natural killer cells has been raised by the recent demonstrations that aGM1 is expressed by activated macrophages and activated T cells as well as the proliferating thymoblast and functionally mature subpopulations of thymus. The current report demonstrates that the expression of aGM1 on aGM1-negative lymphocytes can be induced by stimulation with mitogens under activating conditions. In addition, activation of the aGM1-negative tumor lines EL-4/F and P388D1/B1 under conditions that result in interleukin 2 or interleukin 1 production, respectively, also result in a significant increase in aGM1 expression by the tumor cell lines. Expression of aGM1 therefore appears to be associated with events occurring as a prelude to or during activation of effector function. Since the aGM1-negative cells do display sialylated versions of aGM1 which can be converted by neuraminidase treatment into serologically recognizable aGM1, it is suggested that the expression of aGM1 might reflect a change in the level of glycolipid sialylation rather than a change in membrane lipid composition per se. The small percentage of lymphocytes in normal, nonstimulated spleen and thymus populations which express significant levels of aGM1 were sorted and analyzed for total cellular protein and RNA. Increases in RNA synthesis and in total cellular protein and RNA above basal levels of resting lymphocytes are considered indicators of a G0----G1 transition. The aGM1-positive populations displayed a larger mean population size (as indicated both by higher forward light scatter and by higher total cellular protein content), and a higher mean population RNA content than the aGM1-negative populations. These data are discussed in the context of the hypothesis that the expression of aGM1 may be associated with early events in the activation of resting cells which prepare the cells for subsequent induction of effector function.\r"

Characterization of three T cell clones originated from donor SF and one from donor JM showed that they proliferated when stimulated with autologous TPHA cells, non-T cells, and peripheral blood mononuclear cells, but did not proliferate when stimulated with allogeneic TPHA cells, non-T cells, and mononuclear cells, with autologous and allogeneic resting T cells, and with PHA. These results in conjunction with the blocking of the proliferation by anti-histocompatibility leukocyte antigen class II monoclonal antibodies indicate that these class II antigens are involved in the proliferation of T cell clones stimulated with autologous lymphoid cells. The four T cell clones are cytotoxic neither to autologous lymphoid cells nor to a panel of cultured human cell lines. The four T cell clones display immunosuppressive activity, since they inhibit the proliferation of autologous and allogeneic cells stimulated with antigens and mitogens and the secretion of immunoglobulin by B cells stimulated with pokeweed mitogen in presence of T cells. Furthermore, the four T cell clones display differential inhibitory activity on the proliferation of cultured human cell lines. The immunosuppressive activity is species-specific, since the T cell clones do not inhibit the proliferation of murine cells. The suppression is mediated by a factor(s) with an apparent m.w. of 13,000 to 16,000. The suppressor activity is labile at alkaline pH and is lost following incubation with pronase (100 U/ml) for 30 min at 37 degrees C.\r"

  ".W": "Treatment of murine thymocytes, but not mature peripheral T cells, with the tumor promoter, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), 3 results in a rapid disappearance of L3T4 molecules from the surface of thymocytes. The effect of PMA on L3T4 molecules persists in vitro for at least 72 hr. Down modulation of L3T4 molecules was PMA dose-dependent and temperature-dependent. L3T4 molecules on cortisone-resistant thymocytes were significantly less sensitive to the effect of PMA than were L3T4 molecules on cortisone-sensitive thymocytes. Down modulation of L3T4 molecules on thymocytes did not interfere with their capacity to respond to concanavalin A or activation signals delivered via their T cell receptors. The difference in the ability of thymocytes and peripheral T cells to respond to PMA cannot be explained by differences in the number of PMA receptors. Both thymocytes and peripheral T cells have PMA receptors in the range of 1 to 1.5 X 10(5) receptors/cell. However, there is a small difference in the affinity (Kd) of the receptors on thymocytes (Kd = 30 to 40 nM) and peripheral T cells (Kd = 10 to 15 nM). Immunofluorescent staining revealed that the down modulation of L3T4 molecules by PMA was a result of internalization of L3T4 molecules. After down modulation, L3T4 could be readily detected on the cytoplasm of thymocytes. These findings suggest that L3T4 molecules on thymocytes may be subject to different regulatory signals than L3T4 molecules on peripheral T cells.\r"

  ".U": "88009070\r", 
  ".W": "The immunization of C57BL/6 responder mice with spleen cells from H-2-matched BALB.B donors, which differ by multiple non-H-2 histocompatibility (H) antigens, results in the generation of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) that are specific for only a limited number of immunodominant antigens. Previous analysis of the genes encoding these dominant antigens has not mapped these genes to any of the non-H-2 H loci defined by congenic strains. It would have been expected that the histogenetic techniques employed for congenic strain selection would have preferentially identified the \"strongest\" H antigens. Therefore, we have investigated the possibility that immunodominant antigens do not belong to the class of non-H-2 H antigens encoded by genes mapping to H loci defined and mapped by congenic strains. The first experiments were aimed at identifying antigens that were expressed by independently derived inbred strains and were cross-reactive with the immunodominant cytotoxic T cell target (CTT-1) antigen of BALB.B. Strong cross-reaction with the C3H.SW (H-2b) strain was observed; the C3H gene encoding this antigen was mapped with BXH recombinant inbred strains. Contrary to the mapping of the CTT-1 gene to chromosome 1 in BALB.B, the C3H gene was shown to map to either chromosome 4 or chromosome 7. This result indicates that identical, or at least extensively cross-reactive, non-H-2 antigens may be encoded by genes mapping to independently segregating loci in different inbred strains. The tissue distribution of immunodominant antigens was approached by determining the reactivity of CTL specific for these antigens with either lymphoid-derived or fibroblast-derived targets. These CTL effectively lysed lymphoblast and lymphoid tumor targets but did not lyse an SV40-transformed fibroblast line that was shown to be efficiently lysed by CTL specific for non-H-2 H antigens defined by congenic strains. Therefore, it was concluded that immunodominant antigens detected by B6 anti-BALB.B CTL have a restricted tissue distribution in comparison to non-H-2 H antigens defined by congenic strains. The implications of these results for our understanding of the origin and heterogeneity of non-H-2 cell-surface antigen recognized by effector T cells are discussed.\r"

  ".W": "The low levels of serum IgD found in mice and the lack of a typical DNA switch sequence between C delta and C mu raise the possibility that the generation of murine IgD-secreting cells results from a chance \"mistake\" rather than a controlled process. The recent observation that injection of mice with purified IgD upregulates IgD receptor expression on helper T cells and enhances the ability of these T cells to induce B cells to differentiate into antibody secreting cells led us to look for evidence of controlled differentiation of B cells into IgD-secreting cells. To do this, we injected mice with a goat antibody to IgD (GaM delta), because this antibody stimulates large increases in IgM, IgG1, IgG2a, and IgE secretion. Mice injected with GaM delta demonstrated a large increase in splenic content of mRNA specific for the secreted form of delta-chain, as well as a greater than 100-fold increase in the percentage of splenic IgD-containing plasmablasts. The secretory IgD response was totally T-dependent. Production of the secretory form of IgD was not seen until 7 days after GaM delta injection, and peaked sharply on day 8, whereas by day 6 IgM secretion had already peaked and IgG1 and IgG2 secretion had attained substantial levels. This observation suggests that: 1) either cells that synthesize large quantities of the secretory form of delta-chain, unlike cells that synthesize large quantities of the secretory forms of gamma-, epsilon-, or alpha-chains, do this without deleting C mu, or, despite the absence of a typical DNA switch sequence between C mu and C delta, controls must exist to effect the C mu deletion and VDJ-C delta joining; and 2) if secreted IgD has a role in the regulation of a humoral immune response it most likely is involved in later processes, such as memory cell generation or response termination, rather than in relatively early processes, such as helper T cell activation.\r"

When tested against a panel of B cell lines, only Burkitt's lymphoma cells were 5B5+. Moreover, the 5B5+ cells have larger average sizes and a large fraction of proliferating cells. The other monoclonal antibody (HK23) binds a 90,000 protein. Lymphocytes binding HK23 are 5B5- and include T cells and a subpopulation of B cells. In contrast to 5B5+ cells, the HK23+ and peanut agglutinin positive B cells express a large amount of sIgM. These two subpopulations of germinal centers are distinct from the germinal center B cell subpopulation expressing the CD23 (Blast-2) antigen. The CD23+ B cells are 5B5- and express an intermediate level of HK23 antigen. In addition, CD23+ B cells are highly variable in number, whereas the proportions of HK23+ and 5B5+ cells are relatively stable.\r"

  ".W": "Autoimmune mice homozygous for the lpr/lpr (lpr) gene develop a profound lymphadenopathy resulting from the accumulation of immature Thy-1+ Lyt-2- L3T4- cells in peripheral lymphoid tissues. The source of these cells is not known although the presence of a thymus is necessary to manifest both the lymph node enlargement and the autoimmunity. For this reason and the fact that the abnormal lpr cell phenotypically resembles immature thymocytes, we studied the thymus in lpr mice. Adult lpr thymuses were found to contain an immature population phenotypically identical to the peripherally accumulating cells, including the expression of B220 and Pgp-1 antigens as well as the presence of surface T cell receptor molecules as defined by the antibody KJ16-133. Evidence is presented that some of these lpr precursor T cells are capable of intrathymic differentiation, whereas the vast majority are exported unchanged to the lymph nodes where a portion differentiate further into mature T cells. This lpr-specific lineage could be distinguished from a normal component of the lpr thymus by surface phenotype and immunohistology. The results suggest that the massive accumulation of cells in lpr lymph nodes is not so much the result of abnormal proliferation of T cells as abnormal intrathymic differentiation. In addition, a minor subpopulation of normal Lyt-2- L3T4- thymocytes was identified that resembles the phenotype of the lpr cell and similarly expresses surface T cell receptor molecules. The presence of two parallel lineages in the lpr thymus thus also provides insight into normal T cell development.\r"

I have now examined the expression of the CT antigens in the developing thymus by using immunohistology to discern in situ expression, and cytofluorographic analysis of isolated fetal thymocyte populations to analyze cell subset distribution of the CT antigens. Immunohistology demonstrated that the pattern of CT antigen expression progressed developmentally with a relatively homogeneous distribution throughout the thymus during early thymus ontogeny and a distinct subcapsular pattern late in gestation. Fluorescence flow cytometry analyses showed that at all times the CT1 antigen was expressed exclusively by a subset of the Lyt-2- L3T4-, interleukin 2 receptor+ blast cell population. In contrast, the CT2 antigen was expressed on a subpopulation of small Lyt-2+ L3T4+ thymocytes as well as on some Lyt-2- L3T4- cells. Radioimmunoprecipitation indicated that the CT1 antigen was present on the T200 glycoprotein. Although forms of the T200 glycoprotein are found on cells of all hematopoietic lineages except those of erythroid descent, the CT determinants are found only on a restricted subset of T200-expressing lymphocytes. These findings suggest a fundamental role for carbohydrate moieties and for the T200 molecule in T cell development.\r"

  ".U": "88009080\r", 
  ".W": "In the present study we have examined the murine B cell response in anti-tubular basement membrane (alpha TBM) disease. Whereas only certain strains of mice are susceptible to the development of interstitial lesions after immunization with heterologous renal tubular antigen, all strains make anti-tubular basement membrane antibodies (alpha TBM-Ab), and all express the 3M-1 kidney antigen which is the target of disease. The magnitude of the alpha TBM-Ab response in serum and renal eluates, measured by radioimmunoassay against crude tubular antigen or affinity-purified 3M-1, also mapped independently of susceptibility. The fine specificity of epitope binding was further analyzed using a rat monoclonal alpha 3M-1 antibody to competitively inhibit the binding of renal eluate antibody to 3M-1. Maximum inhibition among nearly all tested strains ranged from 46 to 56% with no discernible difference between susceptible and nonsusceptible mice. Idiotypic representation of renal eluate alpha TBM-Ab was then evaluated by competitive inhibition using a polymorphic anti-idiotypic antisera. All mice examined possessed almost identical competitive inhibition patterns, indicating surprisingly similar idiotypic representation. Thus, in susceptible or nonsusceptible mice, neither the quantitative alpha TBM-Ab response, the epitopic fine specificity of that response, nor the idiotype of eluted alpha TBM-Ab serve as distinguishing markers for susceptibility to interstitial injury. Finally, passive transfer experiments with high-titered (greater than 1:10,000) alpha TBM-Ab from SJL mice were performed to test the hypothesis that alpha TBM-Ab alone may be sufficient for the induction of alpha TBM disease. Whereas this antiserum was capable of causing typical, severe alpha TBM disease in naive susceptible SJL mice, this treatment in allotype-identical, nonsusceptible B10.S(8R) mice was completely without effect. These data demonstrate, in conclusion, that, in the absence of appropriate susceptibility genes, alpha TBM-Ab are incapable of causing alpha TBM disease. The findings support previous observations that the ability of passively transferred alpha TBM-Ab to initiate interstitial injury is dependent on the host also expressing other susceptibility genes which promote the cooperative engagement of the cell-mediated immune response.\r"

Experiments reported here show that xid spleen B cells co-cultured with B cell-depleted PP cells from xid mice differentiated into specific plaque-forming cells in response to trinitrophenyl-Ficoll (type 2) and sheep erythrocytes (T cell-dependent). Two cell types were involved in this normalization of xid B cell responses. An accessory cell activity present in the PP, but not the spleens, of both CDF1 male (xid) and CDF1 female (normal) mice was required for the response to either the type 2 or T cell-dependent antigens. In the presence of this PP accessory cell, T cells from the PP of either xid or normal mice supported responses to both classes of antigens. In contrast, T cells from the spleens of xid mice did not support the response to trinitrophenyl-Ficoll, although the splenic T cells from normal mice did synergize with PP accessory cells in allowing plaque-forming cell development by xid B cells to this type 2 antigen. The xid PP T cell activity required for the type 2 response by xid B cells was present in the Ly-1+, Lyt-2- subpopulation, and the xid PP accessory cell activity was provided by an enriched population of dendritic accessory cells. These results demonstrate the the lymphoreticular cells comprising the PP microenvironment provide effective support for the differentiation of xid B cells in response to type 2 and T cell-dependent antigens.\r"

The positive sera had higher HIV antibody titers as measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay compared with ADCC-negative sera. ADCC titers were lower in patients with acquired immune deficiency syndrome than in asymptomatic carriers. This decline in ADCC titer was not correlated with a general decrease of HIV antibodies. No correlation between the CD4:CD8 lymphocyte ratio and ADCC activity was found.

The properties of these cells and their interaction with the host environment were analyzed at the single cell level with a splenic focus assay. When similar numbers of NZB and DBA/2 anti-DNA-producing B cell precursors were transferred, they expanded at similar rates in xid recipients. The rate of expansion varied with the strain of the recipient: it was fastest in autoimmune-prone NZB . xid and slowest in DBA/2 . xid hosts. Cells producing antibodies reactive with the autoantigen DNA proliferated substantially faster than those reactive with the non-autoantigen trinitrophenylated keyhole limpet hemocyanin. These results suggest that 1) B cells from NZB mice do not behave differently from DBA/2 B cells, 2) the internal milieu of the recipient into which the cells are transferred has an important effect on B cell proliferation, and 3) B cells capable of autoantibody production may have a selective growth and/or differentiation advantage relative to other B cells.\r"

Previous in vitro studies, using monolayers of cultured human vascular endothelial cells (VEC), have identified various agents which promote the acquisition of adhesiveness in VEC for polymorphonuclear leukocytes. In the present studies, we report that human lung fragments cultured for 4 to 24 hr release a factor which acts on VEC to promote adherence of polymorphonuclear leukocytes. Adhesiveness in VEC stimulated by lung fragment culture supernatants was time- and dose-dependent. This adherence-promoting factor appears to be a mixture of the alpha and beta forms of interleukin 1 (IL-1) and has the following properties: 1) it is heat-labile; 2) it is not inactivated by polymyxin B; 3) it has mobility on Sephadex G-75 column chromatography corresponding to apparent m.w. of approximately 15,000, 30,000, and 70,000 (a pattern observed previously for IL-1); 4) it has activity in the thymocyte costimulation IL-1 assay, but no interleukin 2 activity, and 5) it is neutralized by anti-human IL-1 antisera but not by anti-human tumor necrosis factor antiserum. Production and release of IL-1 in vivo may play a role in the development of inflammatory infiltrates in human lung and other tissues by acting on endothelium to promote the localized adherence of leukocytes.\r"

  ".W": "Glucocorticoids block the localized accumulation of leukocytes as sites of inflammation by preventing their adherence to vascular endothelium. This implies that glucocorticoids are acting either on the leukocytes, endothelium, or cells which produce adherence-promoting factors (such as interleukin 1 (IL-1)). Previous studies have shown that dexamethasone (DEX) treatment of either polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) or human umbilical vein vascular endothelial cells (VEC) or both in vitro does not prevent adherence induced by thrombin or formylmethionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (f-met peptide). We now show that pretreatment of PMN and/or VEC for 24 hr with 0.1 microM DEX had no effect on adherence of PMN to VEC activated with IL-1 (2 U/ml), lipopolysaccharide (1 microgram/ml), or 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (30 ng/ml) suggesting that glucocorticoids may inhibit adherence in vivo by blocking formation of IL-1 and other adherence-inducing stimuli. We have recently established that cultured human lung fragments produce IL-1 in vitro. To investigate whether glucocorticoids could inhibit the production of adherence-inducing factors, we examined the effect of glucocorticoids on IL-1 production from human lung tissue. Treatment of human lung fragments in vitro for 18 hr with glucocorticoids such as DEX and hydrocortisone resulted in dose dependent inhibition of IL-1 production; these and other glucocorticoids, at concentrations ranging between 0.1 and 1 microM, produced greater than 50% inhibition of IL-1 release. Nonglucocorticoid steroids including testosterone and beta-estradiol (1 microM) had no effect. Inhibition of IL-1 production occurred after a lag period 5 of 16 hr, and the relative glucocorticoid potencies agreed with their known anti-inflammatory potencies in vivo (beta-methasone approximately triamcinolone acetonide greater than DEX greater than fludrocortisone greater than prednisolone greater than hydrocortisone). Inhibition of IL-1 production in vivo may, in part, explain the remarkable ability of glucocorticoids to prevent the adherence of leukocytes to endothelium and their accumulation at an inflammatory site.\r"

The proportion of conjugates was increased two- to threefold when antigen-pulsed trinitrophenyl-specific B cells, but not T cells, were pre-exposed to interleukin 4. Antigen-specific B cells pretreated with antigen and interleukin 4 and cultured in the presence of specific T helper cells also produced a larger proportion of antibody-secreting cells as compared to cells pretreated with antigen alone. The interleukin 4-induced enhancement of T/B conjugate formation occurred over a wide range of antigen concentrations, was dependent on the concentration of interleukin 4, and was inhibited by the monoclonal anti-interleukin 4 antibody, 11B11. The importance of Ia antigens in the enhancement of conjugate formation and generation of antibody-secreting cells is suggested by a) the fact that the interleukin 4-mediated increase in the density of Ia antigens on the antigen-specific B cells correlated with their enhanced ability to form T/B conjugates, b) the kinetics of the interleukin 4-mediated increase in conjugate formation and surface Ia expression were similar, c) 10- to 20-fold higher concentrations of anti-I-A antibody were required to inhibit T/B conjugate formation by 50% with interleukin 4-treated antigen-specific B cells compared with untreated antigen-specific B cells, and d) interferon-gamma, which inhibits the interleukin 4-mediated increase in Ia antigens, inhibited the interleukin 4-induced enhancement of T/B conjugate formation. These results indicate that the interleukin 4-induced increase in the expression of Ia antigens on B cells plays an important role in the enhancement of T/B cell interactions and the subsequent differentiation of antigen-specific B cells into antibody-secreting cells.\r"

Hybrid molecules were constructed from both mouse monoclonal and rabbit polyclonal antibodies with equal efficiency, in the combinations mouse-rabbit and mouse-mouse. Peptic F(ab' gamma)2 fragments from the two chosen antibodies were first reduced to provide Fab' gamma SH. The SH groups on one of the Fab' gamma SH partners were then fully alkylated with o-phenylenedi-maleimide to provide free maleimide groups. Finally the two preparations, Fab' gamma mal and Fab' gamma SH, combined under conditions which allowed cross-linking of the maleimide and SH groups and avoided reoxidation of SH groups. The major product isolated from the reaction mixture after chromatography was always the F(ab' gamma)2 heterodimer (50 to 70%), other products being unreacted Fab' gamma and trace amounts of putative F(ab' gamma)3. Immunochemical analysis revealed that the thioether-linked F(ab' gamma)2 molecules were essentially all heterodimers, most of which had been joined via their Fd chains. The dual specificity of F(ab' gamma)2 heterodimers was tested functionally in three systems: 1) the combination (anti-idiotype + anti-phycoerythrin) linked L2C cells to the fluorochrome phycoerythrin, allowing fluorescence analysis; 2) the combination (anti-idiotype + anti-saporin) linked L2C cells to the ribosome-inactivating protein saporin, and transformed a subtoxic dose of saporin into a highly toxic mixture which prevented further protein synthesis by L2C cells; and 3) the combination of anti-idiotype with 3G8 (antibody to the Fc gamma receptor CD16) subjected L2C cells to cytotoxic attack by human mononuclear effectors.\r"

Gel filtration columns showed a major peak of BLT esterase activity eluted at the position of a 60-kDa protein, and an additional, minor BLT esterase peak eluting at about 27 kDa. The separated enzymes were both significantly inhibited by the serine protease inhibitors diisopropylfluorophosphate and phenylmethyl sulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), indicating they are both serine proteases, but showed different patterns of inhibition by a series of inhibitors, suggesting the larger enzyme is not a simple dimer of the smaller. pH activity profiles of both CTL BLT esterases showed an optimum at about pH 8. PMSF inactivation of BLT esterase in detergent extracts of CTL diminished sharply as the pH was dropped below 7. Agents which raise the pH of acidic intracellular compartments were found to markedly enhance the PMSF inactivation of BLT esterase in intact CTL, showing that the granules have a low internal pH. Similarly, [3H]diisopropylfluorophosphate labeling of intact CTL gave four protein bands on non-reduced gels, of which two were labeled threefold more effectively in the presence of chloroquine. In parallel studies of inactivation of CTL lytic activity, PMSF pretreatment caused a 50% reduction of the lytic activity under conditions where greater than 90% of the BLT esterase activity was inactivated. Addition of agents raising the intragranular pH dramatically enhanced the BLT esterase inactivation but did not concomitantly reduce CTL lytic activity. These results indicate that inactivation of lytic function by PMSF is unlikely to be due to its reaction with protease in acidic granules, and suggest that the activity of these enzymes may not be required for cytotoxicity.\r"

  ".W": "Degradation of tryptophan to kynurenine, catalyzed by indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO), has been augmented in human epithelial cell lines treated with human interferon-gamma (HuIFN-gamma). Several human biologic response modifiers, including HuIFN-gamma, HuIFN-beta, HuIFN-alpha, interleukin 2 (HuIL-2), and tumor necrosis factor alpha, have now been assessed for their ability to enhance tryptophan degradation in human peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PMC) cultures. PMC were isolated from normal donors, cultivated in RPMI 1640 medium containing [3H]tryptophan, and treated with individual biologic response modifiers. At various intervals, culture supernatants were removed, fractionated by reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography, and radioactivity in resultant fractions was determined. Significantly increased amounts of tryptophan catabolites were observed after treatment with HuIFN-gamma, HuIFN-beta, HuIFN-alpha, and HuIL-2, but not human tumor necrosis factor alpha. Often, greater than 30% of available tryptophan was degraded by treated PMC cultures. Although antibodies to HuIFN-alpha, HuIFN-beta, and HuIFN-gamma specifically neutralized the induction of IDO activity in PMC by their respective HuIFN, only anti-HuIFN-gamma antibody also neutralized HuIL-2-induced IDO activity. Furthermore, T24 bladder carcinoma cells, in which IDO was induced by HuIFN-gamma but not by the other biologic response modifiers, were induced to degrade tryptophan by supernatants of HuIL-2-stimulated PMC cultures, but not by HuIFN-beta-stimulated PMC culture supernatants. Thus, whereas HuIL-2 indirectly induced IDO in PMC cultures by stimulating production of HuIFN-gamma, all cases of interferons appeared to induce IDO directly in PMC cultures.\r"

  ".W": "Pertussis toxin (PT) is a known mitogen for T lymphocytes. The mechanism by which the toxin stimulates proliferation has remained obscure and paradoxical because, in some types of cells, the toxin also inhibits growth factor-mediated signal transduction. It has previously been shown that the adenosine-diphosphate ribosyltransferase activity of the toxin is not required to produce the mitogenic effect. A biochemical explanation for the mitogenic activity has therefore remained obscure. We investigated the biochemical basis for the mitogenic activity of PT by using the transformed human T cell line, Jurkat. PT stimulated a rapid rise in cytosolic-free [Ca2+] from both intra- and extracellular sources. This was associated with an increase in the cellular diacylglycerol and inositol triphosphate levels with a concomitant decrease in the levels of phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate and phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate. The half-maximal effective dose of PT was 1.7 nM. PT also stimulated the production of interleukin 2. Only the holotoxin or B-oligomer (the presumptive membrane-binding subunit) was capable of stimulating an increase in [Ca2+] in these cells. This activity of PT mimicked that of some anti-T3-T cell antigen receptor complex monoclonal antibodies that also stimulate increases in the second messengers, diacylglycerol and Ca2+. The effects of PT and anti-T3 complex antibody were identical and not additive in Jurkat cells, suggesting that both agents were activating the same signal transduction pathway. These data provide a mechanistic explanation for the mitogenic effects of PT and suggest that the toxin may be interacting with a specific receptor in the T lymphocyte plasma membrane.\r"

  ".W": "Co-incubation of human mononuclear cells with small numbers of autologous polymorphonuclear leukocytes resulted in a ratio-dependent inhibition of T lymphocyte rosette formation with sheep erythrocytes (SRBC). Inhibition by polymorphonuclear leukocytes was reversed with catalase, implicating H2O2 or associated products as the suppressive agent(s). Exposing T lymphocytes directly to micromolar concentrations of H2O2 also inhibited subsequent rosette formation. Inhibition was dose-dependent between 40 and 320 microM H2O2 and was not due to cytotoxicity at those H2O2 concentrations. Kinetic studies demonstrated that after exposing T lymphocytes to H2O2 a proportion of cells appeared to be relatively resistant in that they retained their ability to form E rosettes. T cell phenotype analysis of these cells showed that, in contrast to untreated T cells, H2O2-treated T rosette-forming cells were almost exclusively of the helper/inducer phenotype. Analysis with the monoclonal antibody 4B4 revealed that H2O2-resistant T rosette-forming cells contained significantly fewer 4B4-positive cells than predicted for the T helper population, indicating that H2O2-resistant T cells might be a subset of helper/inducer T lymphocytes. The interaction between H2O2 and T cells was rapid but did not lead to loss of Leu-5b binding sites. Preliminary functional analysis indicates that interleukin 2 production and phytohemagglutinin-induced proliferation by the relatively H2O2-resistant T cells is similar to untreated T cells. In contrast, H2O2-treated T cells which lost their ability to form E rosettes produced undetectable levels of interleukin 2 and proliferated poorly in response to phytohemagglutinin. Finally, mononuclear cells pretreated with H2O2 and subsequently stimulated with mitogens demonstrated a preferential expansion of the T helper population with concomitant loss of T suppressors. Our results show that, although neutrophil-released H2O2 inhibits effective interactions between SRBC and T lymphocyte sheep erythrocyte receptors, there appears to be a population of T helper cells which is relatively resistant to H2O2 both in terms of SRBC rosette formation and response to mitogens. These data suggest that at sites of inflammation phagocyte-released H2O2 could exert immunoregulatory effects on T cells by altering T cell subset survival and allowing the function of a particular lymphocyte population to predominate.\r"

Twenty-seven HIV antibody-positive sera, most of which enhanced the killing of HIV-infected MOLT-4f and CEM target cells by normal mononuclear cells were studied in detail. HIV antibody-positive sera resulted in lysis at dilutions as high as 1/10,000. HIV antibody-negative sera did not augment lysis of infected target cells. In addition, lysis of uninfected targets was not enhanced in the presence of HIV antibody-positive sera. Because fractionation of the HIV antibody-positive sera on a protein A affinity column resulted in recovery of the activity from the IgG fraction, the extra cytotoxic activity mediated by nonimmune cells in the presence of immune sera appears to be antibody-dependent. Furthermore, the cytotoxic effector cells were in the nonrosetting fraction of lymphocytes and expressed Leu-11 (cluster designation (CD)15) antigens, which is characteristic of cells participating in antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity reactions. The antibody specificity of the sera, determined by radioimmunoprecipitation, provides evidence that antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity can occur even when there are no detectable antibodies directed against gag proteins. Sera which lacked detectable antibodies to the envelope protein gp120 by radioimmunoprecipitation did not mediate antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity.\r"

  ".W": "AKR/Gross leukemia virus-induced tumor reactive cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) clones were derived from C57BL/6 spleen cells. Analysis of their specificity pattern was performed by using a panel of target cells such as E male G2 and AKR.H-2bSL1 (susceptible tumors to polyclonal anti-AKR/Gross virus CTL), and cl. 18-5 and cl. 18-12 (insusceptible variant sublines derived from AKR.H-2bSL1). Several of these CTL clones were selected for further study. Lysis of Gross cell surface antigen-positive tumor cells by these clones was restricted by the H-2Kb molecule. The cell surface phenotype of these clones was Thy-1.2+, Lyt-2.2+, L3T4-, a phenotype consistent with that of polyclonal anti-AKR/Gross CTL, suggesting that they were of conventional CTL origin. According to their fine specificity pattern, the CTL clones were divided into two major groups (A and B) which were further subdivided into five and three subgroups, respectively. The specificity of group A clones was essentially the same as that of the standard polyclonal CTL population except for a variable level of natural killer-like activity by some of the CTL clones. That is, group A clones did not efficiently lyse the insusceptible variant tumors nor any of Friend-Moloney-Rauscher-positive tumors tested, but they showed strong lytic activity to susceptible tumors and iododeoxyuridine-treated insusceptible variants. Thus, their CTL activity appeared to be strictly directed to Gross cell surface antigen-positive tumors that are susceptible to polyclonal anti-AKR/Gross virus CTL. In contrast, group B clones could lyse both susceptible and insusceptible variant tumors and also a Friend virus-induced tumor (FBL3). Therefore, as defined by these CTL clones, at least two distinct antigenic systems (A and B), each with several antigenic determinants, appeared to be present. Because recent findings suggested that most of the polyclonal anti-AKR/Gross virus CTL activity appeared to be directed to N-ecotropic proviral determinants, we further investigated the nature of these two antigenic systems by use of additional target cells including lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated spleen cell blasts from AKXL recombinant inbred strains and retrovirus-infected fibroblasts. Group A clones could lyse all LPS blasts derived from AKXL recombinant inbred strains containing the AKV-1 proviral genome, but lysed only very insufficiently or did not lyse AKV-1-negative blasts containing the AKV-3 and/or AKV-4 provirus.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

Antibodies were found to be deposited along the glomerular basement membrane (GBM) predominantly in a linear fashion, which changed to a more granular pattern 7 wk after the infection. At this stage of the disease, electron-dense deposits were found subendothelially along the GBM. In the sera and kidney eluates of diseased rats, anti-GBM antibodies were present. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) studies showed antibodies which reacted with GBM components laminin and type IV collagen and not with fibronectin. The antibody specificity was confirmed by using competitive and cross-absorption ELISA techniques, as well as immunoblotting. With the use of indirect immunofluorescence, no common antigenic sites were found on trypanosomes and GBM components. The observed linear immunofluorescence pattern seems to be caused by glomerular binding of antibodies directed against laminin and type IV collagen, which are known to be able to induce renal disease. Subendothelial complex formation in later stages of the disease might result from a molecular rearrangement of GBM components after in situ binding of the antibodies. The formation of auto-antibodies directed against laminin and type IV collagen is probably caused by restricted polyclonal B cell stimulation, a well known feature of trypanosomiasis.\r"

In order to study the relationship of thyroid hormone to NK activity, a model for hyperthyroxinemia was induced in mice by addition of T4 to the drinking water. Control mice were hypothyroid (fed propylthiouracil) or normal. Serum T4 levels were elevated (within 2 wk) in mice fed thyroid hormone. Six weeks after initiation of the diets, in vitro NK activity was undetectable in the peripheral blood, spleen, or lung mononuclear cell populations harvested from hyperthyroxinemic mice. Control mice had NK activity within the normal range. Spleen cells from mice fed thyroid hormone and control mice were tested for their ability to release lytic factors (natural killer cytotoxic factors). Lymphoid cells were incubated for 20 hr with unlabeled Yac-1 cells. Supernatants were tested for their capacity to lyse 51Cr-labeled Yac-1 cells in a 20-hr chromium release assay. Unlike controls, supernatants from hyperthyroxinemic spleen cells incubated with Yac-1 targets were unable to lyse 51Cr-Yac-1 cells. The NK cells from the mice fed T4 synthesized lytic factors because nonspecific stimuli, such as 12-O-tetradecanoyl phorbol-13-acetate and the calcium ionophore A23187, induced release of lytic factors capable of lysing Yac-1 targets into the media. These data support the hypothesis that excess thyroid hormone interferes with the triggering mechanism used by NK targets to cause release of lytic molecules from NK cells.\r"

The phenotype of T cells required to initiate GVHD was different in each of the three strain combinations studied. Both Lyt-2+ and L3T4+ LP spleen cells were necessary to cause lethal GVHD in C57BL/6 recipients. In the reciprocal transplant, Lyt-2+, but not L3T4+ C57BL/6 spleen cells were sufficient to initiate GVHD in LP recipients. In contrast, L3T4+, but not Lyt-2+ B10.D2 spleen cells were found to initiate GVHD in BALB/c recipients. The optimal response to minor HA requires both Lyt-2+ and L3T4+ T cells because a mixture of the two subsets of spleen cells resulted in a more severe form of GVHD than either subset alone in all three strain combinations studied. This study demonstrates that L3T4+ cells participate in the initiation of GVHD in response to minor HA. The dominant T cell subset that initiates GVHD varies with the specific strain combination tested. The specific minor HA expressed in the transplant recipient, the H-2 type, and possibly non-major histocompatibility complex immune response genes of the donor strain appear to determine the phenotype of the initiator T cells.\r"

It was found that a similar restriction to IgM and IgG1 could be observed in an in vitro lymphocyte culture system providing that the source of helper T cells was from infected animals. In order to characterize the helper T cells responsible for the restriction, helper T cell clones were generated. Attempts to obtain isotype-restricting helper T cell clones by using the intact, nonviable organism were unsuccessful in that these T cell clones promoted multiple antibody class expression. However, two types of CD4+ (cluster designation) T cell clones were generated by cultivation on the live organism that appeared relevant to the observed restriction. These T cells did not function as conventional carrier-specific helper T cells. Instead, they were shown to regulate T-dependent responses to 2,4-dinitrophenyl-keyhole limpet hemocyanin by 2,4-dinitrophenyl-specific B cells and keyhole limpet hemocyanin-primed T cells derived from uninfected mice. The helper phenotype of one regulatory clone enhanced the IgG1 response, whereas the other phenotype inhibited the production of the other non-IgM isotypes tested. It is concluded that the activities of these two prototype regulatory T cell clones may predominate in infected animals resulting in the IgM, IgG1 dominance of the antibody response.\r"

A series of isotype heavy chain switch variants (murine IgG1, IgG2a, IgG2b, IgA, and IgE) of a single CD3 mAb was used in the analysis of effects of CD3 mAb on the cytolytic activity of an allospecific CTL clone. The results obtained indicate that the inhibition of cytolytic activity of CTL by CD3 mAb is not caused by interference with events that occur after conjugate formation, such as programming for lysis and the delivery of the lethal hit, but by inhibition of specific recognition of the target cell by the CTL. We also present evidence that induction of nonspecific CTL activity by CD3 mAb is only achieved by direct binding of the Fc receptor to the CD3 mAb. This observation allowed us to use the CD3 mAb-induced nonspecific cytolytic activity of CTL as a sensitive assay for detection of Fc receptors for various heavy chain isotypes. So far, evidence was found for human Fc receptors reactive with murine IgG1, IgG2a, and IgG2b, but not for murine IgA or IgE. The combined results indicate a similar role for Fc receptors in induction of cytolytic activity of CTL by CD3 mAb as well as in CD3 mAb-induced proliferative responses of T cells.\r"

In this study, we determined whether cultured LC enhance antigen-specific T cell responses, and whether such enhanced stimulatory capacity correlates with the level of Ia antigen expressed on LC. We used C3H/He (Iak) epidermal cells as stimulators and, as responder cells, both the trinitrophenyl-specific clones D8 and SE4, which were assayed for [3H]dThd incorporation, and the pigeon cytochrome c specific hybridoma 2C2, which was assayed for interleukin 2 production. Cultured LC induced 10 to 100 times greater proliferation or interleukin 2 production by responder cells than did freshly prepared LC. The intensity of I-Ak and I-Ek, expressed on cultured LC as assessed by immunofluorescence and flow cytometry, was found to be 10 to 36 times greater on a per cell basis than that on freshly prepared LC. Depletion of LC from fresh epidermal cell suspensions by anti-Iak and complement or treatment with 50 mJ/cm2 medium range ultraviolet light or cycloheximide before culture abrogated both the increase in Ia expression and antigen-specific clonal proliferation. The results suggest that when LC are removed from their usual epidermal milieu, they express increased amounts of Ia and become more potent stimulators of T cell responses.\r"

TP67.21, a subclone of a resulting hybridoma, expresses IAk, IEk, IgM, B220, P50, and receptors for C3 fragment of complement, the Fc portion of IgG, and interleukin 2 receptor on the cell membrane; it also possesses receptor molecules for TNP on its surface, derived from TNP-reactive B cells of A/J mice primed with TNP-lipopolysaccharide used for somatic hybridization, by a rosette-forming assay with TNP-sheep erythrocytes. In contrast, parental 2.52M lacks IAk and IEk on the cell membrane and does not bind to TNP-sheep erythrocytes under the same conditions. Thus, it is likely that TP67.21 is an antigen-specific B cell clone directed against TNP. The antigen binding of cells was markedly inhibited by the specific free hapten or anti-IgM antibodies. Interestingly, TP67.21 was induced to generate a significant amount of anti-TNP antibody when treated with TNP conjugates including T cell-independent and -dependent antigens, such as TNP-lipopolysaccharide, TNP-bovine serum albumin, TNP-ovalbumin, and TNP-keyhole limpet hemocyanine in the absence of T cell help, as well as polyclonal activators; this was followed by a marked decrease in the expression of B cell surface markers on the cell membrane. This suggests that the cross-linkage of receptor molecules on TP67.21 by antigen may directly provide a differentiative signal for maturation to a lineage of B cells, and consequently results in the generation of antigen-specific antibodies without T cell involvement.\r"

Both peptides induced antigen-specific helper T cell responses, as evidenced in vitro by lymph node cell proliferation and in vivo by production of anti-AChR antibodies. Rats immunized with 100 micrograms of either synthetic peptide, without conjugation to a carrier, produced anti-peptide antibodies which bound to native AChR in immunoprecipitation assays and induced modulation of membrane-bound AChR from cultured human myotubes. Both peptides also induced electrophysiologic and biochemical signs of experimental autoimmune myasthenia gravis. Thus, region 125-147 of the AChR alpha-subunit is at least partly exposed extracellularly in human muscle and contains one or more autoantigenic sites capable of stimulating T cells and B cells. Disulfide-linkage between residues Cys 128 and Cys 142 is not essential for myasthenogenicity.\r"

  ".W": "Although interleukin (IL) 2-responsive T cell lines provide an opportunity to study the cellular effects of this lymphokine on homogeneous T lymphocyte populations, T cell clones which proliferate in response to IL-1 alone have not been available. We have isolated from cultures of the nontransformed murine T helper cell line, D10 . G4 . 1, a variant (MD10 cells) which proliferates (no lectin or antigen needed) in response to IL-1 alone. The MD10 cells are markedly sensitive to either murine or human recombinant IL-alpha (HrIL-1 alpha) with half-maximal responses observed at monokine concentrations as low as 0.4 X 10(-12) M or 0.8 U/ml, respectively. MD10 cells show the maximal IL-1 effect at 72 hr where the response exceeds the base line by 100-fold (approximately 3,000----300,000 cpm of [3H]thymidine). Whereas both HrIL-2 and purified murine B cell-stimulatory factor 1 (MpBSF-1) induce MD10 proliferation, the maximal response to either is much lower (HrIL-2: 50X baseline; MpBSF-1: less than 20X base line) than to IL-1. Conditioned media from control, concanavalin A-, or IL-1-treated MD10 cells fail to stimulate CTLL or HT-2 cell proliferation alone or inhibit CTLL mitogenesis in the presence of added HrIL-2. Furthermore, monoclonal antibodies to BSF-1 fail to inhibit IL-1-stimulated MD10 replication, and neither HT-2 nor CTLL cells proliferate despite direct cell-to-cell contact with IL-1-treated MD10 cells. When combined, IL-1 (10(-13), 10(-12) M) and IL-2 (10(-13) to 10(-10) M) act synergistically in their MD10 cell growth-promoting effects. MD10 proliferation induced by either IL-1 or IL-2 is relatively resistant to cyclosporine A, with the ID50 of cyclosporine for both IL-1- and IL-2-exposed MD10 cells (ID50 5000 ng/ml) exceeding that for concanavalin A-activated splenocytes (ID50 20 ng/ml) by 2 to 3 orders of magnitude. Finally, MD10 cells bear the L3T4 antigen, IL-2 receptors, and the same clonotypic antigen receptor as the parent clone as recognized by monoclonal antibody 3D3. These data suggest that, in respect to this particular T cell line, IL-1 is directly growth-promoting or, alternatively, induces the production of undetectable, intermediate growth factor(s) resistant to inhibition by cyclosporine A.\r"

  ".W": "The role of murine recombinant T cell replacing factor (rTRF) (interleukin 5) in the early activation, proliferation, and antibody-forming cell (AFC) clone formation of single fluorescein (FLU)-specific B cells was examined in vitro. FLU-specific B cells were selected by their adherence to FLU-gelatin and then cultured in 10-microliters wells with or without rTRF in the presence or absence of the T-independent antigen FLU-polymerized flagellin (FLU-POL). rTRF acting alone was unable to induce early B cell activation as assessed by significant cell enlargement after 24 hr in culture. When acting in the presence of FLU-POL, however, a greater number of B cells were induced to enlarge than with FLU-POL alone. When FLU-specific B cells were cultured in the presence of FLU-POL, the addition of rTRF markedly increased the frequencies of both proliferating clones and AFC clones above that induced by FLU-POL alone. Furthermore, in the presence of FLU-POL, the activity of rTRF was comparable to that seen with the mixture of B cell growth and differentiation factors contained within the supernatant from concanavalin A-stimulated EL4 cells. However, rTRF exerted little activity when acting alone in contrast to the medium conditioned by concanavalin A-stimulated EL4 cells which showed some activity in the absence of FLU-POL. rTRF acting with FLU-POL also promoted AFC clone development among single B cells stimulated in the presence of 3T3 fibroblast filler cells. Thus rTRF can be added to the list of B cell active factors (including recombinant murine interleukin 1 and recombinant human interleukin 2) that act in the concomitant presence of antigen to induce both growth and differentiation among single hapten-specific murine splenic B cells. This stands in contrast to the activity seen with interleukin 4 (formerly termed B cell stimulatory factor 1) which acts to promote early activation and proliferation but not IgM secretion.\r"

The purification scheme consisted of sequential batch adsorption onto trimethylsilyl-controlled pore glass beads, high pressure ion exchange chromatography, and reverse phase high pressure liquid chromatography. The purified BCGF-II had a relative molecular weight of 45,000 when analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under nonreducing conditions. Identical analysis of BCGF-II under reducing conditions yielded a m.w. of 22,500, suggesting that native BCGF-II exists as a homodimer. The NH2-terminal amino acid sequence of the purified lymphokine was determined by automated Edman degradation. A single amino acid sequence of 24 residues was obtained that, upon comparison, was contained within the cDNA pSP6K-mTRF23 recently described as encoding murine BCGF-II/T cell-replacing factor. The NH2-terminal methionine in mature BCGF-II is found at position 21 of the amino acid sequence predicted from the cDNA pSP6K-mTRF23. This finding supports the contention of Kinashi et al. (Kinashi, T., N. Harada, E. Severinson, T. Tanabe, P. Sideras, M. Konishi, C. Azuma, A. Tominaga, S. Bergstedt-Lindqvist, M. Takahashi, F. Matsuda, Y. Yaoita, K. Takatsu, and T. Honjo. 1986. Nature 324:70) that amino acids 1-20 serve as the signal sequence for the BCGF-II gene. The ability of BCGF-II to stimulate the proliferation of the B cell lymphoma BCL1 was used to assess the potency of the lymphokine. BCGF-II at 13.5 pM induced 50% of the maximal proliferative response in the BCL1 cells; concentrations as low as 2 pM were still effective in stimulating the growth of the cells. Assuming that the amount of BCGF-II necessary to mount a 50% response in the BCL1 assay is defined as one unit of activity, then the purified BCGF-II has a specific activity of 16.5 U/ng of protein.\r"

To understand more accurately the mechanism of this immunoregulation, an autoreactive T cell line from Peyer's patches was generated by culturing L3T4+ Peyer's patches T cells with syngeneic B cell blasts. The resulting T cell line, designated PT-1, and a clone derived from this line, PT-1.14, stimulated immunoglobulin secretion in spleen B cells with a preferential enhancement of IgA and IgG1 isotypes. Supernatant derived from concanavalin A-stimulated PT-1 or PT-1.14 cells could also enhance IgA secretion if spleen B cells were preactivated with lipopolysaccharide. Peyer's patches T cell supernatant did not contain IgA-specific binding factors. PT-1 supernatant scored positive in lymphokine assays for interleukin (IL)-2, IL-4 (B cell stimulatory factor 1), IL-5 (B cell growth factor II), and interferon-gamma, whereas PT-1.14 supernatant was positive for IL-4 and IL-5 and negative for IL-2 and interferon-gamma. Only IL-5 enhanced IgA secretion in lipopolysaccharide-activated B cells and this response was increased two- to three-fold by IL-4. These results suggest that the type 2 T helper subset which produces both IL-5 and IL-4 plays a primary role in regulating IgA expression.\r"

Peritoneal exudate cells harvested from virus-infected mice were used as a source of LGL. LGL collected from mouse hepatitis virus-infected mice at 3 days postinfection were a source for NK 1.1 positive natural killer (NK)/LGL. LGL collected from mice treated with antiserum to gangliotetraosylceramide and infected with lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus for 7 days were used as a source for Lyt-2 positive cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL)/LGL. Both NK/LGL and CTL/LGL responded chemotactically to hrIL-2, purified IFN-beta, and to crude cell-free washout fluids collected from the peritoneal cavity of virus-infected mice. hrIL-2 had chemotactic activity for virus-elicited granular and agranular lymphocytes but did not attract the contaminating macrophages, in contrast to IFN-beta, which displayed chemotactic activity for virus-elicited granular and agranular lymphocytes as well as macrophages. The migration to hrIL-2 was inhibited by a monoclonal antibody (7D4) to the IL-2 receptor, but treatment with 7D4 did not affect migration in response to IFN-beta. Microscopic examination of Wright's-Giemsa-stained migrated NK/LGL and CTL/LGL revealed that the majority of migrated LGL in either LGL population had a blast cell morphology (enlarged cells with rich basophilic cytoplasm). The frequency of cells bearing the LGL morphology within the virus-elicited nonadherent peritoneal exudate cell population was on incubation in vitro, stabilized by either hrIL-2 or IFN-beta. These data suggest that another important immunomodulating function of IL-2 may be to attract activated NK/LGL and CTL/LGL to sites of inflammation.\r"

In addition, the effect of priming with anti-idiotope-carrier antigens on B cell precursors responding to phosphorylcholine-hemocyanin was determined. We found that one anti-idiotope-carrier antigen, 4C11-hemocyanin, and phosphorylcholine-hemocyanin stimulated similar subpopulations of primary B cells. However, the B cell population stimulated by F6-hemocyanin, the other anti-idiotype complex, was distinct. Furthermore, priming with certain idiotope antigens can direct the phosphorylcholine-hemocyanin response into the expression of idiotypes that may be the most effective in protective immunity. Our results provide essential information for the rational design of idiotype vaccines by clarifying the dynamic relationship of the B cell precursor repertoire with the in vivo antibody response in the response to nominal and idiotope antigens.\r"

Immunization with idiotypic IgM (38C-Id) resulted in idiotype-specific humoral and cellular immunity and protection against a lethal tumor cell challenge. Heavy (H38C) and light (L38C) chains were isolated by electroelution from preparative polyacrylamide gels. Both of these immunogens induced significant resistance to a subsequent tumor challenge. Variable region immunogens, in the form of trpE-fusion proteins, were obtained by cloning heavy and light chain variable region genes into the expression plasmid pATH-11. Of these, only the trpE-VH38C immunogen yielded immune resistance to tumor challenge. Finally, the nucleic acid sequence of 38C-Id light chain was determined and, based on the corresponding amino acid sequence and an analysis of predicted secondary structure, a region of potential antigenicity in complementarity-determining region 3 was chosen for the production of a synthetic peptide. Vaccination with this synthetic peptide resulted in significant suppression of tumor growth. Analysis of the humoral and cellular immunity generated by these vaccines revealed the presence of antibodies reactive with native idiotypic IgM only in 38C-Id, H38C, and trpE-VH38C immune sera, although the latter two were not idiotype-specific. Idiotype-specific lymphocytes, which proliferated in response to native 38C-Id, were observed in all immune animals. With the exception of the fusion protein immunogens, conjugation to an immunogenic carrier protein (keyhole limpet hemocyanin or thyroglobulin) was required for optimal humoral and cellular responses.\r"

With four monoclonal antibodies to lipooligosaccharide (LOS) determinants, 17 of the 19 pairs were identical. Thus the pathogenesis of otitis media due to nontypable H. influenzae appears to involve spread of the bacteria from the nasopharynx to the middle ear. Analysis of middle ear isolates from four children with recurrent otitis media caused by nontypable H. influenzae indicated that the recurrent episodes were caused by reinfection with different strains rather than by persistence of the same strain. OMP and LOS analysis of strains from two sisters with concurrent otitis media suggested that person-to-person transmission of nontypable H. influenzae can occur among children.\r"

Of 692 adult patients evaluated, 33 (4.6 percent) had symptoms of unexplained, chronic, diffuse muscular pain. Only three patients had been diagnosed as having fibrositis by their physician. Eighteen of 31 patients had symptoms sufficiently severe to interfere with their ability to perform their job or household chores. The percentages of these patients who met the fibrositis criteria ranged from 17 to 55 percent. These results suggest that unexplained, diffuse muscular aching is a common problem, that it is rarely diagnosed, and that the use of several criteria to define fibrositis excludes many patients with the typical primary symptoms.\r"

  ".W": "Major histocompatibility antigens were identified in frozen sections of normal Lewis rat peripheral nerve tissue with monoclonal antibodies and an avidin-biotin-peroxidase complex system. Class I antigen is normally required for cytotoxic/suppressor T lymphocyte function and class II antigen for activation of helper T lymphocytes. In the sciatic nerves class I antigen was expressed diffusely by most endoneurial and perineurial cells but class II antigen only by a minority. In the cauda equina class I antigen was expressed by all arachnoid and some endoneurial cells, while class II antigen was expressed by a smaller proportion of arachnoid cells in the endoneurium of spinal roots and interstitial cells surrounding dorsal root ganglion neurons. The endothelium of endoneurial, perineurial and meningeal vessels uniformly expressed class I but not class II antigen. Experimental allergic neuritis was induced in Lewis rats by immunisation with bovine intradural root myelin. Early lesions consisted of multifocal infiltration of the nerve roots by cells expressing leucocyte common antigen. Surrounding endoneurial cells showed markedly increased expression of major histocompatibility antigens. In inflammatory lesions about 10% of the cells were stained with pan T cell antibodies. T lymphocyte subsets were identified with antibody W3/25 for helper cells and MRC OX-8 for cytotoxic/suppressor cells. The W3/25 positive cells were usually slightly in excess of OX-8 positive cells and their relative proportions did not alter during the disease. The presence of class I antigen on normal endothelium and its increased expression on endoneurial cells in the early phase of inflammation suggest an important role for class I restricted lymphocytes in the pathogenesis of the early stages of experimental allergic neuritis.\r"

  ".W": "The concentration of cobalt-57 (57Co)-labeled bleomycin delivered to three brain metastases and to their tumors of origin in the lungs was measured using a single-photon emission computerized tomography technique. In two brain metastases the 57Co-bleomycin concentration measured at different times after the intravenous injection was significantly lower than that in the originating lung tumors (p less than 0.01 and p less than 0.001). In these two patients, the tumor cumulative concentration (TCC) of drug in the brain neoplasm compared to the lung carcinoma was 12.92 versus 15.12 and 10.30 versus 19.74 micrograms/cc/min. In the third patient there was no significant difference in drug concentration between the tumor in the brain and in the lung (TCC 16.02 vs. 15.09 micrograms/cc/min). There was a significant difference in the drug TCC between the three brain metastases: the difference between the lowest and highest concentrations was more than 50% (10.3 vs. 16.02 micrograms/cc/min). When the concentration in the tumor over time (CT(t)) of the 57Co-bleomycin was compared in the brain and lung tumors, a good correlation was found in each of the three cases (r = 0.93, 0.99, and 0.97). This suggests that the difference in drug uptake between brain metastases and their originating lung tumor is a quantitative rather than a qualitative phenomenon. The results show that the amount of drug to which brain metastases are exposed varies and may be very low in some tumors; therefore, effectiveness of drug delivery may play a role in the nonresponsiveness of brain metastases to treatment.\r"

The detectors are multiwire chambers, with specially constructed lead converters added to improve the photon detection efficiency at 511 keV. The current HIDAC detectors have a singles efficiency of approximately 12%, a sensitive area of 31 X 31 cm and an intrinsic spatial resolution of less than 2 mm full width at half maximum (FWHM). During data acquisition, the detectors are rotated around the patient in order to collect a complete angular data set. A three-dimensional image of the positron distribution is reconstructed from a single scan by weighted backprojection of the data into a matrix of either 64 X 64 X 64 or 128 X 128 X 16 voxels. The camera point response function is deconvolved by frequency-space filtering. Corrections are made during backprojection both for photon attenuation and for spatial variations in point source sensitivity. The reconstructed image is further corrected for contributions from accidental and scattered coincidences and displayed as a sequence of two-dimensional transverse, sagittal, or coronal sections. In addition, three-dimensional display is available using shaded graphics techniques. The prototype camera is currently undergoing clinical evaluation.\r"

  ".W": "A quantitative study of nonisotropic attenuation in SPECT imaging is presented. The study includes a case where the spatial distribution of the attenuation coefficient is nonuniform, as well as a case where the photon path length in the attenuating medium is variable as a function of direction. The effects are studied using phantoms with known source activity and density distributions. Reconstructed images of the phantoms with and without attenuation compensation are compared with the source distribution. Three methods are used to provide partial attenuation compensation, using effective attenuation coefficients. These coefficients include some of the effects of photon scatter, but scatter is not explicitly treated. One attenuation compensation method involves a multiplicative postprocessing correction using an assumed constant attenuation coefficient. A modification of this technique is implemented using the correct nonuniform attenuation map to determine the multiplication factors. A single-iteration technique is used to provide a more complete compensation. The results indicate that nonuniform attenuation can produce significant distortion in line spread functions and in larger distributed sources. This distortion can alter volume determinations, quantitation measurements, and the shape of small objects, and can cause misplacement of counts into regions of low density. The distortion cannot be eliminated by the multiplicative postprocessing correction, but the single-iteration technique can significantly decrease the distortion.\r"

The parallel hole collimator measured -0.1 +/- -0.1 s.d. degrees in the X and -0.2 +/- 0.1 s.d. degrees in the Y direction. One 30 degree nominal slant hole collimator revealed a 0.1 +/- 0.3 s.d. degrees angulation in X and 26.5 +/- 1.1 s.d. degrees angulation in Y, which was unacceptable. The replacement collimator measured 0.0 +/- 0.1 s.d. degrees in X and 29.6 +/- 0.2 s.d. degrees in Y. Determination of collimator hole angulation is recommended as an acceptance test for SPECT systems. The net angle of tilt with respect to the orthogonal resulting from a particular collimator and camera head tilt was determined from summed projection images over 360 degrees of a point source placed off the axis of rotation. These measurements were sensitive within a 0.5 degree tilt angle. The method is suggested as a routine quality control procedure to optimize camera head tilt to a particular collimator. It may also reveal unexpected mechanical misalignments in the camera gantry.\r"

In hamsters bearing a human colonic carcinoma xenograft producing carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), we injected donkey anti-goat IgG 24 hr after administration of 131I-labeled goat anti-CEA IgG and achieved enhanced tumor imaging 24-48 hr later, with a significant relative decrease of radioactivity in blood and all major organs except the spleen. In seven of nine patients, this method of anti-antibody clearance of nontargeted radioactive murine monoclonal antibodies revealed sites of cancer, including liver metastases. Characterization of radioactivity in the plasma before and after administration of the second antibody confirmed that complexes were quickly formed between primary and secondary antibodies, and imaging of the patients revealed a rapid uptake of radioactivity in the liver at 2 hr that dissipated within 24 hr. Radioactivity in the spleen gradually increased over time. The method of anti-antibody immunological enhancement of cancer imaging is feasible and may reveal tumor sites missed by conventional imaging.\r"

Moderately serious urologic diseases were found in 16.7% of AMs and 9.2% of controls (p = 0.006); significant differences were found only for renal calculi and various causes of increased serum creatinine. Urologic cancers were found in 1.2% of AMs and 0.2% of controls (p = 0.04), but only prostatic carcinoma was found in a significantly higher percentage of those with positive tests (p = 0.047).

The predictive value of low-grade isolated asymptomatic microhematuria is too low to be of value in screening for urologic cancers in unselected patients, and only certain moderately serious urologic diseases and prostatic cancer were more frequent in patients who had asymptomatic microhematuria than in controls.\r"

We evaluated MTX pharmacokinetics and toxicity in five patients with Down syndrome and ALL who had received multiple high doses of MTX (1 g/m2). Three control patients without Down syndrome were matched to each case according to sex, race, age, and initial leukocyte count. Median MTX plasma concentrations, measured 42 hours after infusion, were significantly higher in patients with Down syndrome versus control patients (average 0.47 vs 0.24 mumol/L, respectively, P = 0.03). When a 42-hour MTX concentration of 0.5 mumol/L was used to identify patients at risk for toxicity, more courses were considered at high risk for toxicity among patients with Down syndrome (31 of 62, 50%) than in control patients (13 of 214, 6.1%, P less than 0.0001). The average MTX clearance was 64.1 mL/min/m2 in Down syndrome vs an average control value of 80.6 mL/min/m2 (P = 0.13). Toxicity after each high-dose MTX course was graded according to standardized criteria. Grades 2 through 4 gastrointestinal toxicity and grades 3 and 4 hematologic toxicity occurred more frequently in the patients with Down syndrome (36% and 13.4% of courses, respectively) vs the control patients (3.6% and 0.9% respectively, P less than 0.0001 for both). This higher frequency of toxicity occurred despite higher doses and prolonged duration of leucovorin given to all patients with Down syndrome. We conclude that altered MTX pharmacokinetics may contribute to the higher incidence of MTX-induced toxicity seen in patients with Down syndrome.\r"

PTX in the concentrations of 10(-10) to 10(-8) M induced contraction in rat aortas. The rate of rise of contraction and the maximum contractile tension due to 10(-10) M PTX became greater when endothelium was removed from aortic strip. Methylene blue, 5 X 10(-6) M, also increased both the rate of rise and maximum tension. These results suggest that PTX may release a relaxing substance from endothelium which may inhibit the contraction induced by PTX itself. In contrast to this, the 10(-8) M PTX-induced contraction became smaller when endothelium was removed from the aorta. This contraction was partially inhibited by 10(-5) M indomethacin. Verapamil (10(-6) M) also inhibited a portion of this contraction and these inhibitors showed an additive inhibitory effect. Prazosin (10(-7) M) did not affect this contraction. Similar results were obtained in aortas without endothelium. Using thin-layer chromatography, it was found that PTX (10(-8) M) increased the release of prostaglandin E2, F2 alpha and 6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha from rat aortas with endothelium. In rabbit aortas, 10(-8) M PTX induced a contraction which was partially inhibited by 10(-6) M verapamil, 10(-5) M indomethacin or 10(-7) prazosin. The same concentration of PTX increased [3H]norepinephrine release from rabbit aortic adventitia.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Cardiac myocytes allowed to recover after the isolation procedure in a well-oxygenated medium were resistant to an extracellular Ca++ concentration of 1.5 mM. At least 90% of the isolated myocytes maintained their initial rod-shaped form after a 1-hr incubation, as well as 85% of their ATP and a low cellular content of calcium. At concentrations less than 10(-5) M, bepridil had no effect on these cells. On the other hand, when the myocytes were incubated in anaerobic conditions, 1.5 mM Ca++ was deleterious: the number of viable cells decreased by about 50%, ATP levels were lowered by 70% and the total cell calcium content increased by more than 100%. Bepridil had a biphasic effect on anaerobic cells. At concentrations below 10(7) M, the drug had a beneficial action. It restored cell viability and cellular ATP to 77 and 100% when compared to their respective level in the absence of Ca++. However, at concentrations higher than 10(-6) M, bepridil decreased the number of viable cells as well as their ATP content. At optimal concentrations, bepridil lowered the cellular calcium to its level in aerobic conditions. Without calcium addition, anoxic cells accumulated Na+ and lost K+. Calcium addition decreased Na+ accumulation by 68% and prevented the loss of K+. The Na+ and K+ content of the cells were not affected by bepridil. However, it is noteworthy that, at 10(-4) M, bepridil decreased dramatically the potassium content of the cells. In aerobic conditions, the calcium resistance of isolated ventricular myocytes may still be enhanced by Fluozol, a fluorocarbon compound which increases oxygen solubility in water.\r"

  ".W": "Two analogs of the nigrostriatal neurotoxin 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) were examined for their deleterious effects on nigrostriatal neurons. 1,2,3,6-Tetrahydro-1-methyl-4-(methylpyrrol-2-yl)pyridine (TMMP), but not 1-methyl-4-(1-methylpyrrol-2-yl)-4-piperidinol, caused persistent depletion of striatal dopamine and induced histologic evidence of nerve terminal degeneration in mice. These findings differ diametrically from results previously reported for the two analogs. TMMP produced larger dopamine depletions than MPTP when the two drugs were given in equivalent doses. Further experiments demonstrated that TMMP is preferentially oxidized by mouse brain monoamine oxidase B to a water-soluble compound, most likely the pyridinium ion species. Prior treatment of mice with either the monoamine oxidase inhibitor pargyline or the dopamine reuptake inhibitor bupropion blocked the ability of TMMP to deplete striatal dopamine. Thus, the pharmacologic profile of TMMP closely resembles that of MPTP. That TMMP and MPTP induce dopamine depletions by a similar mechanism tends to support the proposed neurochemical sequence of events thought to lead to the expression of MPTP-induced neurotoxicity. The authors' observations provide further evidence that MPTP is not unique in its capability to damage nigrostriatal neurons.\r"

  ".W": "Corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) is thought to have a neurotransmitter function in the mammalian central nervous system. The release of CRF into the hypothalamic-hypophyseal portal system in response to stress is known, and it has been suggested that CRF may function elsewhere in the central nervous system to promote stress-induced physiological and behavioral changes. Acute stress has been shown to activate dopamine (DA) neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) that project to the prefrontal cortex. To determine whether CRF may act in the VTA to activate the mesocortical or mesolimbic DA systems, it was injected into the VTA of rats, and changes in spontaneous motor behavior and DA metabolism were measured. Intra-VTA injection of CRF produced a dose-dependent increase in horizontal and vertical photocell counts with a minimal effective dose of 0.01 and 0.1 nmol, respectively. In contrast, the minimal effective dose for CRF-stimulated motor behavior after injection into the lateral ventricles was 0.3 nmol for horizontal activity. Furthermore, in the open field, the behavioral profile of CRF (0.3 nmol) given intra-VTA differed from that observed after intraventricular injection. The motor stimulant effect of intra-VTA CRF was not blocked by pretreatment with the DA receptor antagonist haloperidol. After intra-VTA injection, CRF produced a dose-dependent decrease in DA metabolism in the prefrontal cortex. The decrease in DA metabolism in the prefrontal cortex was present at 30 and 60 min but not at 120 min after injection, and in the nucleus accumbens DA metabolism was increased only at 60 min after injection.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Ki values for inhibition of [3H]N-methylscopolamine binding in N4TG1 neuroblastoma cells correlated positively with ED50 values for the inhibition of carbachol-induced alpha-amylase release from pancreatic acini cells and with KB values for inhibition of acetylcholine-induced contractions of guinea pig ileum. The rank order of potency for inhibition of [3H]N-methylscopolamine binding was quinuclidinyl benzilate = quinuclidinyl xanthene-9-carboxylate greater than (methyl atropine = atropine) greater than benactyzine greater than azaprophen greater than (adiphenine = aprophen) greater than pirenzepine greater than ethyl aprophen. The M1 antagonist, pirenzepine, was a weak inhibitor in the guinea pig ileum and alpha-amylase assays relative to its ability to inhibit [3H]N-methylscopolamine binding; azaprophen exhibited the opposite relationship. Lever-press responses of rats were maintained by food delivery under a schedule requiring 10 responses for each food presentation. The high response rates engendered by this schedule were decreased in a dose-dependent manner by all compounds. The order of potency for this behavioral effect (ED50) was atropine = azaprophen greater than aprophen greater than (methyl atropine = benactyzine) greater than pirenzepine greater than adiphenine. Behavioral depressant actions of the antimuscarinics correlated positively with their potencies in inhibiting alpha-amylase secretion. Pirenzepine was unique in being relatively more potent in its behavioral effects than in its actions in vitro. In contrast to the other antimuscarinic agents studied, the benzilates, benactyzine, aprophen and adiphenine, but not azaprophen, increased behavioral response rates.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The present investigation was conducted to determine possible reasons for the greater potency of 2'CH3-MPTP and to determine if its neurotoxic action might be similar to that of MPTP. 2'CH3-MPTP was a much better substrate for monoamine oxidase than was MPTP (Km values of 66 and 114 microM and Vmax values of 3433 and 1389 nmol/g of tissue per hr for 2'CH3-MPTP and MPTP, respectively) and it is likely that this is an important feature which contributes to its greater potency. In addition, its pyridinium metabolite, 1-methyl-4-(2'-methylphenyl)pyridinium was found to be an excellent substrate for the dopamine carrier with Km and Vmax values (513 nM and 4.1 nmol/g of tissue per min, respectively) similar to those of 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (872 nM and 5.2 nmol/g of tissue per min, respectively). In vivo, 2'CH3-MPTP-induced neurotoxicity, like MPTP-induced neurotoxicity, was attenuated by the pretreatment of mice with a dopamine uptake inhibitor (mazindol or GBR 13069). However, selective doses of the monoamine oxidase (MAO)-B inhibitors, deprenyl or MDL 72145, failed to prevent in vivo neurotoxicity induced by 2'CH3-MPTP although these doses effectively blocked MPTP-induced neurotoxicity. Protection against 2'CH3-MPTP-induced neurotoxicity was observed only at a nonselective dose of MDL 72145 which blocked both MAO-B and MAO-A activities.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "In previous studies and in the accompanying paper, 1-methyl-4-(2'-methylphenyl)-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (2'CH3-MPTP) was found to be more potent than MPTP in producing dopaminergic neurotoxicity in mice. One purpose of the present study was to determine whether 1-methyl-4-(2'-methylphenyl)pyridinium (2'CH3-MPP+), the primary oxidation product of 2'CH3-MPTP both in vivo and in vitro, inhibits mitochondrial respiration as does 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP+), the primary oxidation product of MPTP. Another aim was to determine whether treatments which modify MPTP- and 2'CH3-MPTP-induced neurotoxicity in vivo also cause parallel changes in the metabolic toxicity of these compounds. It was found that 2'CH3-MPP+, like MPP+, inhibited the oxidation of NAD(H)-linked substrates by isolated brain mitochondria in a concentration- and time-dependent manner, whereas succinate oxidation was not affected. Thus, the effect was on Complex I in the electron transport chain. Furthermore, 2'CH3-MPP+, like MPP+, enhanced lactate formation by neostriatal tissue slices as would be expected if Complex respiration were inhibited. MPP+ was slightly more potent than 2'CH3-MPP+ in both of these studies. However, 2'CH3-MPTP was several-fold more potent than MPTP in increasing lactate accumulation by the neostriatal slices. This difference in potency correlated with the differing capacities of 2'CH3-MPTP and MPTP to be oxidized by monoamine oxidase (MAO).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Cholera toxin enhanced the in vitro murine immunoglobulin M antibody response toward the T-dependent antigen, sheep erythrocytes, in a concentration-dependent manner (0.01-1.0 microgram/ml). This enhancement has been previously attributed to the cyclic AMP-elevating properties of the toxin mediated through the A subunit. However, the B subunit of the toxin, which facilitates toxin binding to cells through association with GM1 gangliosides, produced enhancement of the antibody response at concentrations that did not induce cyclic AMP generation (0.25-2.5 micrograms/ml). Time of addition studies focused the potentiation window during the first 24 hr after immunization. Neither the intact toxin nor the B subunit increased baseline proliferation of splenocytes or increased background antibody responses. Splenocytes that were preincubated with cholera toxin or B subunit and subsequently washed before immunization also elicited increased antibody responses. Preincubation of the sheep erythrocyte antigen with B subunit, however, did not increase antibody responses. Preincubation of splenocytes with the B subunit in combination with GM1 gangliosides effectively abolished the enhancement of the antibody response. Therefore, a component of the humoral immunoenhancement of cholera toxin is mediated through the interaction of the B subunit with splenocytes and is independent of the cyclic AMP-generating effects of the intact toxin.\r"

  ".W": "An Mr-40,000 polypeptide (p40) was purified from a lung cancer cell line on the basis of its antigenicity with leukocytes from lung cancer patients in an in vitro immunological assay of leukocyte adherence inhibition. Here, the cells and mechanism responsible for recognizing the purified p40 organ-specific cancer neoantigen (OSN) were studied. Buffy coat leukocytes from lung cancer patients showed a bell-shaped dose response with a peak response at 0.75 micrograms/assay. Mononuclear cells showed a similar response pattern, whereas pure T-cells were unreactive. Monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) to T-cell differentiation antigens T3 and T4 inhibited the response in a dose-dependent fashion, whereas anti-T8 had no effect, indicating T helper cells and their T3-antigen receptor complex recognized the antigen. MAbs to class II major histocompatibility complex (MHC) antigens also inhibited the response, whereas MAbs to class I MHC had no effect, indicating an important role for class II MHC antigens of monocytes. None of the MAbs inhibited the response to OSN on membrane fragments, which is mediated by antibody-dependent monocytes. Trypsin- or cyanogen bromide-cleaved p40 OSN triggered a response at the same concentrations as the intact molecule. The p40 OSN incubated with live leukocytes showed less than 30% proteolytic digestion. The results indicate that class II-restricted T-cells recognize, via their antigen-specific cell surface receptors, contiguous sequences within the immunogenic tumor molecule in the context of the molecule or peptides binding to class II transplantation antigens.\r"

  ".W": "Immunotoxins (monoclonal antibodies-ricin A-chain conjugates) directed against the tumor-associated antigen carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) are selective in vitro cytotoxins for human adenocarcinoma cells. However, the kinetics of intoxication are relatively slow. The effects of the UV radiation-inactivated human adenovirus and the carboxylic ionophores monensin and nigericin were examined on immunotoxin cytotoxicity to the human colorectal adenocarcinoma cell line LoVo. In a 16-hour cytotoxicity assay, adenovirus reduced 33-fold the median inhibitory concentration from 3 X 10(-8) M to 9 X 10(-10) M. In timed cytotoxicity assays, 50% of control protein synthesis was reached in immunotoxin-treated cells twentyfold faster in the presence of adenovirus (0.5 hr) than in its absence (10 hr). Adenovirus produced no enhancement of immunotoxin effect on a control cell line or on a control immunotoxin on LoVo cells, demonstrating specificity of adenovirus effect. In addition, specific immunotoxin constructed with a nonreducible thioether bond, alone or with adenovirus, produced no toxicity on LoVo cells. These results suggest that both cell surface binding and presence of a reducible disulfide bond in the conjugate are necessary for adenovirus effect. Similar potentiation of the cytotoxicity of anti-CEA immunotoxins was produced by monensin and nigericin. These studies demonstrate that both adenovirus and carboxylic ionophores are potentiators of immunotoxins directed against the CEA, producing cytotoxicity equivalent to that of ricin but specific for CEA-positive adenocarcinoma cells in culture.\r"

  ".W": "The time course of Heymann's nephritis (HN), assessed on proteinuria and immunomorphology, has been compared in Lewis (LEW) rats immunized with BB alone (group A) or injected with HgCl2 and subsequently immunized in a similar manner (group B). Whereas all rats from group A developed typical HN characterized by heavy proteinuria and abundant glomerular immune deposits, rats from group B did not develop or developed a markedly attenuated form of HN; proteinuria was never detectable, immune deposits were absent or minimal. No abnormalities were found in rats injected with HgCl2 alone. In order to explain our findings, we have studied the glomerular and tubular expression of the 330 kD nephritogenic glycoprotein (gp330) as well as the corresponding antibody response. In rats receiving HgCl2, gp330 was normally expressed on BB and glomerular epithelial cells as indicated by in vitro and in vivo binding of anti-gp330 antibodies, but titers of anti-BB and anti-gp330 antibodies were considerably lower than in group A control rats. These findings therefore suggest that HgCl2 acts by its immunodepressive effect recently related to an increase in T suppressor cells. This effect is paradoxical since HgCl2 induces autoimmunity in Brown-Norway rats, and we suggest that it may be akin to observations reported in clinical practice where drugs may be immunostimulatory in some patients and immunodepressive in others. The mercury model may therefore represent a unique tool to evaluate the relationship between genetics and drug-induced immune dysregulation.\r"

Twenty patients (55.6%) had persistent or massive bleeding, and 13 of these underwent early surgery with a surgical mortality of 3 cases (23.1%); the remaining 7 patients were not operated on, and died secondary to the hemorrhage. The total mortality rose to 10 patients (27.7%). The mean age was higher in patients with persistent or massive bleeding, mainly in those who did not undergo surgery and died. We conclude that the immediate outcome is related to age and previous general condition, rather than to the definite diagnosis of gastric cancer. Moreover, emergency endoscopy may be useful in determining the exact source of hemorrhage and in identifying potential candidates for emergency surgery.\r"

They included 42 patients who had received preoperative heparin therapy (26 had intra-aortic balloon pumps and 16 did not). Thirty-four comparison patients (controls) were matched for age, sex, race, and heparin lot. Patients receiving preoperative heparin therapy, either with or without intra-aortic balloon pumps, had significantly lower activated clotting times than patients in the control group after a 300 IU/kg dose of porcine intestinal heparin. Total preoperative heparin dose, days of preoperative heparin therapy, and baseline activated clotting times were not predictive of heparin resistance.

  ".W": "Nearly three-quarters of patients on long-term treatment with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have small-intestinal inflammation, the consequences of which are largely unknown. Two potentially important complications, blood and protein loss from the small intestine, have been studied. 49 patients on NSAIDs underwent study with an indium-111 labelled leucocyte technique which localises and measures intestinal inflammation. 32 patients underwent simultaneous study with technetium-99m labelled red blood cells (RBC), which showed identical sites of localisation to 111In-leucocytes in 19. Intestinal blood loss was measured in 8 patients by use of chromium-51 labelled RBC, and a significant correlation between blood loss and intestinal inflammation was found. Intestinal protein loss was assessed in 9 patients with 51Cr-labelled proteins; patients with NSAID-induced small-intestinal inflammation were found to have a protein-losing enteropathy. These studies show that small intestinal inflammation caused by NSAIDs is associated with blood and protein loss, both of which may contribute to the general ill-health of rheumatic patients.\r"

A DNA polymorphic site, 5' to the serum amyloid P component gene, has been found to be significantly associated with amyloidosis in juvenile arthritic patients. When genomic DNA was cut with the restriction enzyme MspI and probed with the cDNA for serum amyloid P component, homozygosity for the 5.6 kb restriction fragment length polymorphic (RFLP) band was absent in all 28 amyloid patients. Furthermore, the proportion who were homozygous for the 8.8 kb RFLP band was greater (p = 0.008) than that among 89 normal subjects. The distribution of this polymorphic site among 19 juvenile arthritic patients without amyloidosis was the same as that in the normal group. Thus the 8.8 kb RFLP band represents a genetic predisposition to reactive amyloidosis in juvenile arthritis and may apply to amyloidosis associated with more common inflammatory conditions.\r"

Autologous fibrinogen, derived by polyethylene glycol precipitation from the blood of an individual patient would avoid this risk, and has been shown to be relatively safe to the ear in animal studies. A study of the biochemical composition of this autologous fibrinogen concentrate derived from 15 human volunteer donors was performed. The mean starting plasma fibrinogen was 2.12 mg/ml (range 1.59-3.22 mg/ml). When 10% polyethylene glycol was used to precipitate the fibrinogen, the concentrate contained, on the average, 31.8 mg of fibrinogen/ml. The percent yield averaged 54.9%, and the protein in the final product was 91.9% fibrinogen. Increasing the polyethylene glycol concentration in the precipitation process to as high as 15% resulted in an increased yield as high as 91%, but the protein in the final product was only 42.5% fibrinogen. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis confirmed that the predominant protein in the 10% polyethylene glycol precipitate was fibrinogen. These data suggest that highly concentrated fibrinogen can be derived with relative ease from single donor human plasma, and that the product is relatively pure. When combined with thrombin and calcium chloride, this concentrate should provide an adhesive that avoids the risks associated with fibrinogen adhesive derived from pooled blood.\r"

In experiment 1, the eighth cranial nerve was sectioned preganglionically and allowed to regenerate in a group of bullfrogs with normal contralateral eighth nerve and labyrinth. Posture and reflex to lateral tilt were measured preoperatively and postoperatively for a minimum of 3 months. Similar measures were performed in a second group of bullfrogs in which the eighth nerve had been destroyed by ganglionectomy and in a third with peripheral labyrinthectomies. In experiment 2, the eighth nerve was sectioned and allowed to regenerate in bullfrogs in which the contralateral nerve had previously been destroyed. Posture and reflex to lateral tilt were measured as in experiment 1. Similar measures were performed in a group of bullfrogs that had undergone bilateral nerve destruction. Regeneration of the eighth cranial nerve in bullfrogs in both experiments was documented histologically by labeling the regenerated fibers with horseradish peroxidase (HRP). In both experiments, posture recovered completely only in the bullfrogs in which the eighth cranial nerve was allowed to regenerate. Reflex to lateral tilt recovered more rapidly in the bullfrogs with regenerated nerves than in any of the other bullfrogs.\r"

Dilation in response to increased intraluminal flow would provide an opposing feedback mechanism which could confer overall stability. Flow-dependent dilation in conduit vessels is mediated by endothelium-derived relaxing factor (EDRF), but the relationship between flow and EDRF activity has not been studied in resistance vessels in situ. We here demonstrate that EDRF can coordinate the aggregate hydrodynamic properties of an intact network. Under control conditions, EDRF maintains a fourth-power relationship between diameter and flow so that the pressure gradient in each vessel asymptotically approaches a constant value at high flow rates. Basal EDRF release may also maintain a similar spatial distribution of flow at different flow rates, even under conditions of moderate pharmacological constriction.\r"

Whereas fragments of soluble antigens are presented to T helper lymphocytes (TH), which carry the CD4 antigen, in association with class II MHC molecules, CD8-bearing cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) usually see cellular antigens (for instance virally-encoded proteins) in conjunction with MHC class I molecules. The different modes of antigen presentation may result from separate intracellular transport: vesicles containing class II molecules are thought to fuse with those carrying endocytosed soluble proteins. Class I molecules, in contrast, can only pick up degradation products of intracellular proteins (see refs 7 and 8). This makes biological sense; during an attack of a virus, class I-restricted CTL destroy infected cells and class II-restricted TH guide the humoural response to neutralize virus particles and toxins. But here we provide evidence that CTL specific for ovalbumin fragments can be induced with soluble protein, and that intracellular protein degradation provides epitopes recognized by these CTL. These findings suggest the existence of an antigen presenting cell that takes up soluble material and induces CTL.\r"

A possible cause of this imprinting is the methylation of DNA. The insertion of foreign DNA into transgenic mice allows the tagging of regions that are differentially methylated during gametogenesis. We describe here a transgenic mouse strain in which the expression of the hepatitis B surface antigen gene is irreversibly repressed following its passage through the female germ line. This inhibition is accompanied by the methylation of all the HpaII and HhaI sites within the foreign gene, which we have shown to be integrated into a site on chromosome 13. The irreversibility reported here contrasts with what is found with other transgenic mice sequences which are reversibly methylated after passage through the male or female germ line, though in both cases methylation appears to be important in the imprinting process.\r"

  ".W": "Type-beta transforming growth factors (TGF-beta s) are polypeptides that act hormonally to control proliferation and differentiation of many cell types. Two distinct homodimeric TGF-beta polypeptides, TGF-beta 1 and TGF-beta 2 have been identified which show approximately 70% amino-acid sequence similarity. Despite their structural differences, TGF-beta 1 and TGF-beta 2 are equally potent at inhibiting epithelial cell proliferation and adipogenic differentiation. The recent immunohistochemical localization of high levels of TGF-beta in the bone marrow and haematopoietic progenitors of the fetal liver has raised the possibility that TGF-beta s might be involved in the regulation of haematopoiesis. Here we show that TGF-beta 1, but not TGF-beta 2, is a potent inhibitor of haematopoietic progenitor cell proliferation. TGF-beta 1 inhibited colony formation by murine factor-dependent haematopoietic progenitor cells in response to interleukin-3 (IL-3) or granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF), as well as colony formation by marrow progenitor cells responding to CSF-1 (M-CSF). The progenitor cell lines examined were approximately 100-fold more sensitive to TGF-beta 1 than TGF-beta 2, and displayed type-I TGF-beta receptors with affinity approximately 20-fold higher for TGF-beta 1 than TGF-beta 2. These results identify TGF-beta 1 as a novel regulator of haematopoiesis that acts through type-I TGF-beta receptors to modulate proliferation of progenitor cells in response to haematopoietic growth factors.\r"

But the characterization of the TS lineage has not been extensive and many are sceptical of studies using uncloned or hybrid T-cell lines. The nature of the antigen receptor on these cells is unclear. T cells of the helper or cytotoxic lineages appear to recognize their targets using the T-cell receptor (TCR) alpha beta-CD3 complex. TCR beta-gene rearrangements are also found in some murine and human suppressor cell lines but others have been shown not to rearrange or express the beta-chain or alpha-chain genes. We previously established TS clones derived from lepromatous leprosy patients which carry the CD8 antigen and recognize antigen in the context of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecules in vitro. We here report the characterization of additional MHC-restricted TS clones which rearrange TCR beta genes, express messenger RNA for the alpha and beta chains of the TCR and express clonally unique CD3-associated TCR alpha beta structures on their cell surface but do not express the gamma chain of the gamma delta TCR on the cell surface. We conclude that antigen recognition by at least some human CD8+ suppressor cells is likely to be mediated by TCR alpha beta heterodimers.\r"

Although there is evidence that genetically engineered vaccinia viruses have reduced pathogenicity a major obstacle to their use as vaccines is that severe complications can occur after vaccination, especially in immunodeficient individuals. We describe here a recombinant vaccinia virus expressing murine interleukin-2 (IL-2) and show that athymic nude mice infected with the recombinant virus resolve the virus infection rapidly whereas mice infected with control virus develop a progressive vaccinal disease. By incorporating the gene for IL-2 in live virus vaccines it may be possible to prevent the severe complications that arise in recipients with an impaired immune system.\r"

DMD patients display a much more severe clinical course than BMD patients, and yet about 10% of cases of each have been reported to have deletions for parts of the gene. Using a complementary DNA subclone of the DMD gene we have screened 66 DMD and BMD patients who had not previously shown deletions with the probes then available. Fifteen patients have a deletion of this part of the gene, indicating a higher deletion frequency in this region (22%). Exons were deleted in five severely affected DMD patients and in ten BMD patients. Significantly, most of these deletions begin in the same region of the cDNA, which implies that there is a common mechanism for the generation of many of these mutations. An apparently identical deletion in one family gave classical BMD in two brothers (presenting in their teens) and only very mild muscle weakness in their 86-year-old great-great-uncle. Taking these data together with data using the probes previously published, we are able to detect deletions directly in 40% of our families requiring antenatal diagnosis or carrier detection.\r"

Our technique determines four variables related to entry of 18F-spiperone into brain tissue and subsequent binding to receptors: (1) the combined forward-rate constant k1' (equal to the product of the maximum number of available specific binding sites, Bmax, times the association rate constant [ka] of 18F-spiperone and receptor); (2) the binding site dissociation rate constant k-1; (3) the free fraction of radioligand not specifically bound in brain tissue, f2; and (4) the regional permeability-surface-area product (PS) of the blood-brain barrier for spiperone. PS and f2 in the patient were not different from that of 10 normal volunteers, whereas the combined forward-rate constant (left caudate: k1' = 67.6 sec-1, normal = 0.140 +/- 0.056) and the dissociation rate constant (left caudate: k-1 = 0.116 sec-1, normal = 0.000339 +/- 0.000149) were evaluated. These findings provide potential new insights not only into the pathophysiology of this disease but into the clinical importance of dopamine receptor function as well.\r"

Forty patients with acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) and CMV retinopathy were treated with ganciclovir on a compassionate protocol basis. Initial treatment doses ranged from 5.0 to 14.0 mg/kg/day for 9 to 26 days. Signs of drug response were a halt to enlargement of lesions, decreased opacification of retinal tissue, and resolution of hemorrhage and vasculitis. Complete response was seen in 88% of patients and incomplete response was seen in 9%. Vision improved or remained stable in 88% of patients. Initial treatment did not eradicate live virus from the eye. To prevent reactivation of disease, 26 patients received low-dose maintenance therapy ranging from 1.5 to 7.5 mg/kg/day, once or twice daily, 3 to 7 days per week. Reactivation of disease developed for unknown reasons in 50% of patients on continuous, uninterrupted maintenance therapy for longer than 3 weeks. Reversible neutropenia, requiring cessation of treatment, developed in 30% of patients on initial treatment and in 38% of patients on maintenance therapy. Rhegmatogenous retinal detachment was a late complication in seven patients. By reducing or delaying visual loss, ganciclovir appears to be useful in the management of CMV retinopathy in patients with AIDS.\r"

Continued improvement in the retinitis was often seen while the patient was on maintenance treatment. Maintenance ganciclovir therapy was required; relapse occurred in five of seven patients in whom ganciclovir treatment was interrupted. The major limiting toxic side effect of ganciclovir was neutropenia, which necessitated temporary discontinuation of ganciclovir in five patients but was reversible in all cases.

  ".W": "Both eyes from a 75-year-old woman who had unilateral closed-angle glaucoma, characteristic endothelial specular microscopic findings, and slowly progressive tractional iris abnormalities consistent with essential iris atrophy were obtained postmortem and studied by light, scanning, and transmission electron microscopy. Clinically, the nonglaucomatous right eye had an open-angle, normal iris, and severe endothelial dystrophy with three-plus corneal guttae. In this eye, results of histopathologic examination disclosed marked endothelial degeneration and typical guttate excrescences on Descemet's membrane. In contrast, the endothelium in the fellow eye with the essential iris atrophy variant of the iridocorneal endothelial (ICE) syndrome was strikingly different. The endothelial cells were relatively well preserved and exhibited marked pleomorphism, anisocytosis, and flat, occasionally paired oval nuclei. Binucleate cells also were observed. The endothelial monolayer had secreted a new layer of fibrillar extracellular matrix material on the posterior surface of Descemet's membrane. Extracellular matrix material was found interposed between the iris and cornea in zones of synechial closure, and an endothelial membrane was present on the anterior surface of the iris. These observations support the hypothesis that the iris abnormalities in essential iris atrophy are secondary to endothelial proliferation. The endothelial cells displayed neither tonofilaments nor abundant apical microvilli. The latter observation suggests that increased numbers of endothelial microvilli are not responsible for the characteristic specular microscopic picture seen in the ICE syndrome.\r"

The DNA sequence of a 3.2-kilobase BamHI fragment spanning the gene was determined. The gene contains three introns. The predicted amino acid sequence of 134 amino acids is identical with that recently reported for human interleukin 5 but shows no significant homology with other known hemopoietic growth regulators. The amino acid sequence shows strong homology (approximately 70% identity) with that of murine EDF. Recombinant human EDF, expressed from the human EDF gene after transfection into monkey COS cells, stimulated the production of eosinophils and eosinophil colonies from normal human bone marrow but had no effect on the production of neutrophils or mononuclear cells (monocytes and lymphoid cells). The apparent specificity of human EDF for the eosinophil lineage in myeloid hemopoiesis contrasts with the properties of human interleukin 3 and granulocyte/macrophage and granulocyte colony-stimulating factors but is directly analogous to the biological properties of murine EDF. Human EDF therefore represents a distinct hemopoietic growth factor that could play a central role in the regulation of eosinophilia.\r"

The frequency of multilineage colonies, erythroid bursts, and megakaryocyte colonies in cultures containing the COS-1 cell supernatant was equivalent to the frequency observed in the controls and significantly higher than found in cultures plated with recombinant GM-CSF. G-CSF did not support the formation of multilineage colonies, erythroid bursts, and megakaryocyte colonies. In contrast, growth of granulocyte-macrophage colonies was best supported with GM-CSF, while recombinant IL-3 yielded colonies at lower or at best equivalent frequency. The simultaneous addition of higher concentrations of GM-CSF to cultures containing IL-3 in optimal amounts did not enhance the formation of multilineage colonies, erythroid bursts, and megakaryocyte colonies. However, the frequency of such colonies and bursts increased with GM-CSF when cultures were plated with suboptimal concentrations of IL-3. Growth of colonies within the granulocyte-macrophage lineage is optimally supported by GM-CSF and does not increase with further addition of IL-3.\r"

In an infected cell, a number of cellular as well as HIV-encoded gene products determine the levels of viral gene expression and HIV replication. Efficient HIV-replication occurs in activated T cells. Utilizing transient expression assays, we show that gene expression directed by the HIV long terminal repeat (LTR) increases in response to T-cell activation signals. The effects of T-cell activation and of the HIV-encoded trans-activator (TAT) are multiplicative. Analysis of mutations and deletions in the HIV LTR reveals that the region responding to T-cell activation signals is located at positions -105 to -80. These sequences are composed of two direct repeats, which are homologous to the core transcriptional enhancer elements in the simian virus 40 genome. Our studies reveal that these elements function as the HIV enhancer. By acting directly on the HIV LTR, T-cell activation may play an important role in HIV gene expression and in the activation of latent HIV.\r"

We now have studied the interaction in vitro of purified splenic B and T lymphocytes from variably immunized mice to ascertain the cellular basis of the hemagglutinin (HA)-influenced antibody response to neuraminidase (NA). Assay of the proliferative response of T cells in B/T-cell mixtures stimulated by H3N1 (HA-specific) and H6N2 (NA-specific) reassortant (recombinant) viruses in vitro has enabled us to differentiate cellular responses to HA and NA antigens. Using a factorial design in analysis of B/T-cell mixtures, we have shown that: (i) intravirionic HA is dominant over NA in both B- and T-cell priming; (ii) an increase in H3-specific B cells occurs in mice administered boosters of H3N2 vaccine, and an increase in N2-specific B cells occurs in those given a booster of H7N2 vaccine; and (iii) memory B cells function as antigen-presenting cells and interact with memory helper T cells in the mediation of intravirionic HA-NA antigenic competition in favor of HA. The damping of response to the NA antigen in favor of HA with reinfection prohibits balanced immunologic response to the two antigens. The present studies define further the complex immunology of influenza virus infection.\r"

It is a disulfide-bonded heterodimer in which either the alpha or alpha' polypeptide chain encoded by Ly-2 is covalently linked to the beta polypeptide chain encoded by Ly-3. The nucleotide and predicted amino acid sequence of the murine Ly-3 cDNA, isolated by using the rat Ly-3 cDNA clone pX9.15, together with the amino acid sequence of Ly-3.1 peptides and the N terminus, are presented here. The alignment of peptide data from the Ly-3.1 antigen with that of the predicted amino acid sequence of the Ly-3.2 antigen confirmed that the putative Ly-3 cDNA clones do in fact encode the Ly-3 protein. The Ly-3.2 cDNA clones encode a protein of 213 amino acids, which includes a 21-residue leader sequence and structural features in common with immunoglobulin variable, joining, and hinge regions. Searches of protein data bases revealed that Ly-3 is a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily with significant homology to Ly-2, immunoglobulin variable region kappa and lambda light chains, and the beta chain of the T-cell receptor. A single N-linked glycosylation site was found at asparagine-13. The relative expression of two mRNA species (approximately 1.3 and 2.3 kilobases) varied according to the source of mRNA. A murine B1 repeat was located in the 3' untranslated region of Ly-3 cDNA clones.\r"

The children were aged 2 years to 5 years 11 months. The patients had significantly poorer articulation skills than the controls at each age level. Substitutions were the most frequent error, and they did not decrease with age in the patients. Fistula size and a history of speech therapy were significant factors in the articulation error scores only in 5-year-olds. No advantage in articulation proficiency was found for those who had worn a prosthesis to occlude the hard-palate defect.\r"

  ".W": "This paper reports a series of 52 patients with Barrett's (or columnar-lined) oesophagus from one medical unit diagnosed over a six-year period. The commonest associated symptoms were heartburn, regurgitation and dysphagia but 10 patients had no oesophageal symptoms and two had no symptoms at all. Gastrointestinal bleeding (overt or occult) was observed in almost one-third of patients. At diagnosis, 26 patients had oesophagitis, 23 had oesophageal ulceration and 10 had benign oesophageal strictures. An association between oesophageal ulceration and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug ingestion was suggested by the data and patients with oesophageal ulceration were significantly older than patients with uncomplicated Barrett's oesophagus. No patient had adenocarcinoma of the oesophagus at diagnosis and neither carcinoma nor dysplasia were seen during a mean period of 16.4 months. However, 17 per cent of patients in the series had malignancies in other sites. Most patients did well on medical treatment and only two were referred for anti-reflux surgery (both for non-healing oesophageal ulcers). Barrett's oesophagus was seen in 10 per cent of patients with gastro-oesophageal reflux at endoscopy. Oesophageal ulceration in patients with Barrett's oesophagus made up 21 per cent of oesophageal ulcers seen and benign oesophageal stricture in patients with Barrett's oesophagus constituted 13 per cent of all benign strictures seen. Barrett's oesophagus is common in our population and despite complications, it can be managed successfully, at least in the short term, by conservative means.\r"

At one year, the majority reported relief of angina and reduced difficulty in performing everyday activities, but there was considerable individual variation in changes in quality of life. Overall, there were improvements in mental state, leisure activity, satisfaction and family life, but few benefits for work and sexual relations. For a fifth of patients global quality of life was no better or was worse than before surgery and this poor outcome was not closely related to physical state. Patients who described psychological symptoms or had a 'passive' approach to their illness before operation were less likely to have a good outcome. It is probable that the benefits of surgery could be substantially increased by provision of better facilities including simple individually planned preparation and rehabilitation. The study demonstrates that specific interview based ratings can be used to quantify changes in those aspects of quality of life which are most important to patients and their families.\r"

This report describes the natural history of intellectual dysfunction soon after surgery and the incidence and functional impact of late neuropsychological impairment. The mean neuropsychological scores for the whole group remained unchanged or improved compared with levels before operation for the majority of the 10 tests. Analysis of the test scores for individuals showed that 147 of 259 (57 per cent) patients showed deterioration on at least one test score at six months. The degree of impairment was usually mild. One hundred and thirty of the 147 patients showed mild cognitive dysfunction (score deterioration on one or two tests) and only 17 patients had moderate or severe impairment (score deterioration on three or more tests). Detectable neuropsychological deterioration at six months often did not matter to the patient in functional terms. Seventy-one per cent of these patients had no significant symptoms; 27 per cent had minor symptoms and only 2 per cent were seriously disabled. Of the patients unemployed at six months, in only one case was intellectual impairment the factor preventing return to work. A search for possible predisposing factors for long-term intellectual dysfunction was made using a multivariate analysis of 91 variables for each patient. Cardiac failure before surgery and global impairment of left ventricular function were the only factors showing significant correlation.\r"

  ".W": "The development of monoclonal antibodies for use as in vivo carriers of radioactivity for diagnosis and therapy of malignant neoplasms is proceeding rapidly within academic and commercial sectors. The author and his colleagues studied anticancer antibodies formed against tumors of both somatic and hematopoietic origins. Several general principles have been established with the work with somatic tumors, including the following: Improved tumor-to-normal-tissue ratios can be achieved with Fab fragments as opposed to whole IgG; each antitumor antibody has a characteristic biodistribution in humans that cannot be readily predicted from tissue or small animal studies; and for many antibodies, there is a strong dependency of tumor uptake on total mass amount of antibody administered (greater uptake with greater mass dose). Initial work with iodine-131 labeled Fab fragments of the antimelanoma antibodies, 96.5 and 48-7, documented that tumor uptake was broadly proportional to antigen content of the tumors and that under optimal conditions, some tumors were sufficiently loaded with radiolabeled antibody to serve as radiation therapy. In one patient, an objective response was seen that lasted for 4 months; of five other patients, one had long-term stabilization of a previously rapidly growing tumor; two other patients had no response at doses of radioactivity that had caused significant bone marrow suppression but no treatment-related symptoms or morbidity. The antitumor antibody B-72.3, as IgG, has been particularly promising when administered intraperitoneally. In ten patients who were administered I-131 B-72.3 via a Tenkhoff catheter, the sensitivity and specificity of tumor location were excellent for peritoneal implants, and in three of these patients, surgically confirmed tumor was seen with the radiolabeled antibody technique when abdominal computed tomography and magnetic resonance studies were negative. In a separate series of 20 patients with mycoses fungoides, the anti-lymphoma antibody T-101 (recognizes the pan T-cell antigen, T-65), when labeled with indium-111, demonstrated lymph node involvement with greater sensitivity than conventional diagnostic methods and with excellent specificity. Radiolabeled antitumor B-72.3 and T-101 both show promise in antitumor therapy. Although much remains to be done on technical and biologic research levels before these radiopharmaceuticals can be routinely applied to all forms of cancer, these clinical research examples suggest that under proper conditions of use, radiolabeled monoclonal antibodies will have a major impact on the future practice of nuclear medicine.\r"

EGF-immunoreactive material has recently been identified within neuronal fibers and terminals in rodent brain. In the present study, EGF was found to enhance survival and process outgrowth of primary cultures of subneocortical telencephalic neurons of neonatal rat brain in a dose-dependent manner. This effect was observed with EGF concentrations as low as 100 picograms per milliliter (0.016 nanomolar) and was dependent on the continuous presence of EGF in the medium. Similar effects were observed with basic fibroblast growth factor, but several other growth-promoting substances, including other mitogens for glial elements, were without effect. Thus EGF, in addition to its mitogenic and hormonal activities, may act as a neurite elongation and maintenance factor for select neurons of the rodent central nervous system.\r"

The first stage is a T antigen-induced, preneoplastic state characterized by a progression from hyperplasia to dysplasia of the exocrine pancreas, by an increased percentage of tetraploid cells, and by an arrest in acinar cell differentiation. The second stage is characterized by the formation of tumor nodules that appear to be monoclonal, because they have discrete aneuploid DNA contents. The cells within the nodules as compared to normal pancreatic tissue have less total RNA by a factor of 5, less pancreas-specific messenger RNA by a factor of about 50, and increased levels of T-antigen messenger RNA. A tumor cell line has been derived that retains both pancreatic and neoplastic properties.\r"

Interleukin-2 (IL-2) is widely used to isolate and induce clonal expansion of CTLs for functional studies in vitro and in vivo. However, in studies with CTLs specific for class I and class II histocompatibility antigens, IL-2 rapidly downregulated the lytic activity of some class II-specific CTLs in a time- and dose-dependent manner. Lytic activity of L3T4+ CTLs specific for the murine class II antigen I-Ek was repeatedly up- and downregulated in vitro by alternate exposure to specific (alloantigen) and nonspecific (recombinant IL-2) signals, respectively. These results demonstrate that some CTLs modulate their functional property (cytolysis) while undergoing IL-2-driven cell proliferation without loss of antigen specificity or ability to revert to a lytic phenotype.\r"

  ".W": "Exposure to bacterial endotoxins has long been known to stimulate the release of anterior pituitary hormones; administration of endotoxin was at one time a common clinical test of anterior pituitary function. Endotoxin is a potent stimulus for production of the endogenous pyrogenic protein, interleukin-1 (IL-1), by macrophages and monocytes. The possibility that IL-1 has a direct effect on the secretion of hormones by rat pituitary cells in a monolayer culture was investigated. Recombinant human IL-1 beta stimulated the secretion of adrenocorticotropic hormone, luteinizing hormone, growth hormone, and thyroid-stimulating hormone. Increased hormone secretion into culture supernatants was found with IL-1 concentrations ranging from 10(-9) M to 10(-12) M. Prolactin secretion by the monolayers was inhibited by similar doses. These concentrations of IL-1 are within the range reported for IL-1 in serum, suggesting that IL-1 generated peripherally by mononuclear immune cells may act directly on anterior pituitary cells to modulate hormone secretion in vivo. Incubation of IL-1 solutions with antibody to IL-1 neutralized these actions. These pituitary effects of IL-1 suggest that this monokine may be an important regulator of the metabolic adaptations to infectious stressors.\r"

  ".W": "Monoclonal antibodies linked to toxic proteins (immunotoxins) can selectively kill some tumor cells in vitro and in vivo. However, reagents that combine the full potency of the native toxins with the high degree of cell type selectivity of monoclonal antibodies have not previously been designed. Two heretofore inseparable activities on one polypeptide chain of diphtheria toxin and ricin account for the failure to construct optimal reagents. The B chains (i) facilitate entry of the A chain to the cytosol, which allows immunotoxins to efficiently kill target cells, and (ii) bind to receptors present on most cells, which imparts to immunotoxins a large degree of non-target cell toxicity. This report identifies point mutations in the B polypeptide chain of diphtheria toxin that block binding but allow cytosol entry. Three mutants of diphtheria toxin have 1/1,000 to 1/10,000 the toxicity and 1/100 to 1/8,000 the binding activity of diphtheria toxin. Linking of either of two of the inactivated mutant toxins (CRM103, Phe508; CRM107, Phe390, Phe525) to a monoclonal antibody specific for human T cells reconstitutes full target-cell toxicity--indistinguishable from that of the native toxin linked to the same antibody--without restoring non-target cell toxicity. This separation of the entry function from the binding function generates a uniquely potent and cell type-specific immunotoxin that retains full diphtheria toxin toxicity, yet is four to five orders of magnitude less toxic than the native toxin is to nontarget cells.\r"

These V beta genes share the same transcriptional orientation as the diversity (D beta), joining (J beta), and C beta genes, which implies that chromosomal deletion is the mechanism for most V beta to D beta-J beta rearrangements. Within this V beta cluster, the distance between the most proximal V beta gene and the D beta-J beta-C beta cluster is 320 kilobases, as determined by field-inversion gel electrophoresis. The large distance between V beta and D beta, relative to that between D beta and J beta, may have significant implications for the ordered rearrangement of the T cell receptor beta-chain genes.\r"

To analyze and compare the long-term outcome of this approach versus the saphenous vein bypass graft (SVG) approach for anterior coronary revascularization, we reviewed 43 patients who had these crossed double IMAs (CDIMAs) and 53 patients who had SVGs to the same obstructed anterior coronary arteries during 1973 to 1978; 32 patients in the CDIMA group and 43 in the SVG group also had SVGs to other diseased vessels. The two groups had similar demographic and epidemiologic characteristics. The linearized incidence of late cardiac death, reoperation, recurrent angina, and infarction was 0.2%, 0.7%, 1.4%, and 0% per patient-year, respectively, in the CDIMA group, and 1.6%, 2.4%, 7.8%, and 1.8% per patient-year in the SVG group (p less than 0.01 for each event). At 5 years, the actuarial number of patients with CDIMAs free of late cardiac death was 100%, of reoperation 98%, of recurrent angina 98% (p less than 0.01), and infarction 100% (p less than 0.01), versus 94%, 98%, 84%, and 94%, respectively, in the SVG group. At 10 years, the actuarial incidence of all events was substantially and significantly less in patients with CDIMAs. CDIMAs have significantly better prognostic effects than SVGs when revascularization of the anterior coronary arteries is required. This is currently our preferred approach in these selected patients.\r"

  ".W": "Pulmonary toxicity is an important adverse effect of bleomycin treatment. Very little is known of the mechanisms underlying the development of lung injury, especially after intravenous administration, or how it can be modulated. In this study acute lung injury induced by bleomycin has been examined in rats by assessment of alveolar lavage cell profiles, histological examination, and measurement of the total pulmonary extravascular albumin space. Intratracheal instillation of bleomycin 1.5 mg resulted in a severe pneumonitis with influx of inflammatory cells into the alveoli as assessed by alveolar lavage, oedema of the alveolar walls, and up to an eight fold increase in the total pulmonary extravascular albumin space, maximal at 72 hours. Intravenous bleomycin 0.15-5 mg produced no detectable injury when assessed in these ways. Exposure to hyperoxia (40-90%) after intravenous bleomycin, however, induced lung injury similar to that produced by intratracheal bleomycin. A much more severe injury followed administration of intravenous bleomycin after an exposure to hyperoxia, which itself resulted in lung injury; but lung injury was still detectable after bleomycin when the exposure to hyperoxia was insufficient to induce changes in control animals. Lung injury was not observed when the exposure to hyperoxia preceded bleomycin treatment. These results indicate the importance of oxygen in the pathways leading to acute lung injury following intravenous bleomycin. We conclude that exposure to oxygen might induce lung injury during and after bleomycin treatment, and suggest that in these circumstances oxygen therapy should be kept to a minimum.\r"

  ".W": "The quantitative distribution and localisation of seven regulatory peptides (vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), peptide histidine methionine (PHM), calcitonin gene related peptide (CGRP), galanin, substance P, neuropeptide tyrosine (Y), and bombesin like peptides) were determined by radioimmunoassay and immunocytochemistry in six different regions of the respiratory tract of the cynomolgus monkey, Macaca fascicularis. In general, peptide concentrations were higher in the airways than in lung tissue itself. VIP and PHM were found in greatest abundance and in equimolar concentrations. Concentrations of substance P, neuropeptide Y, and bombesin were substantially lower. Immunocytochemistry localised all the peptides to nerve fibres, whose density generally paralleled the tissue concentrations by radioimmunoassay except in the case of bombesin, which was not detected. VIP, PHM, and galanin were mostly associated with glands of trachea and bronchus and with blood vessels and smooth muscle; CGRP and substance P were found principally beneath airway epithelium and around smooth muscle fibres and blood vessels; neuropeptide Y was found around blood vessels and seromucous glands only. The pattern of peptide distribution in the Macaca fascicularis respiratory tract is similar to that previously reported in human postmortem material, suggesting that the cynomolgus monkey may be a useful model for examining the pathophysiological role of peptides in human respiratory disease.\r"

  ".W": "To examine the possibility that mast cells have a central role in the pathogenesis of hypersensitivity pneumonitis, 20 patients with this disease were studied with the aim of seeking evidence for mast cell degranulation. The number of mast cells recovered by bronchoalveolar lavage from patients with hypersensitivity pneumonitis was more than 1,000 times greater than those recovered from normal individuals. Furthermore, discontinuation of antigen exposure resulted in an increase in the number of mast cells observed, consistent with the possibility that antigen exposure had induced mast cell degranulation. Cessation of antigen exposure also resulted in a rapid decrease in the number of neutrophils and eosinophils recovered by lavage, followed by an increase in the number of T8+ T lymphocytes present. In each case the time course of the changes was consistent with the possibility that mast cell degranulation had been important in regulating the number of the immune and inflammatory cells present in the lung. Histamine was present in lavage fluid supernatant from patients with hypersensitivity pneumonitis. The amount of histamine present was, however, closely correlated with the number of mast cells present and not with the interval since last antigen exposure. Delay in separating cells from lavage fluid supernatant resulted in an increase in histamine content. These results suggest that the free histamine in lavage fluid resulted from the degranulation of mast cells induced by the lavage procedure as histamine released in vivo has a short half life. We suggest that hypersensitivity pneumonitis results from a \"late phase reaction\" initiated by antigen induced mast cell degranulation.\r"

Patients received from 8 to 14 grafts (average 9). All coronary arteries and branches that were at least 1.5 mm in diameter and greater than 50% obstructed were bypassed. The operative mortality rate was 1.3%. Seventy-six of 77 (98.7%) patients are alive at a mean follow-up of 2 years. According to the Canadian Cardiovascular Society Angina Criteria, before surgery 5 patients (6%) were classified class I, 8 (10%) class II, 43 (56%) class III, and 21 (27%) class IV. After surgery all 76 patients were class I. Of 59 patients who had undergone bypass surgery who were followed by exercise testing according to the modified Bruce protocol, 47 exercised to greater than or equal to 85% heart rate. Among these patients, 44 (94%) had a normal exercise test result and only 3 had greater than or equal to 1 mm ST segment depression. Thus, patients with severe diffuse coronary disease can undergo multiple (eight or more) bypass grafting procedures with low mortality rates and improved exercise tolerance and functional classification.\r"

  ".W": "During the past decade the number of patients undergoing saphenous vein coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) has increased worldwide. With a rate of late graft occlusion approximating 4% each year, the number of patients at risk for late graft occlusion continues to increase. Whereas in 1976 only 0.8% of the CABGs performed at our institution were reoperations for occluded grafts, by 1985 repeat procedures comprised 12.4% of the CABGs performed. Excised, occluded saphenous vein grafts from 52 of 119 (44%) of these patients showed thrombosis superimposed on ruptured atheromatous plaques. Ten autopsy patients showed similar lesions in their occluded grafts. The lesion was present in grafts excised as early as 3 years and as late as 14 years after bypass surgery; most occurred 5 to 10 years after implantation. Neither age at first bypass, sex, nor coronary artery bypassed permitted prediction of the occurrence of the lesion. Thrombosed, ruptured atheromatous plaque is a common, clinically significant mechanism of late graft occlusion. It is associated with recurrent symptoms that necessitate repeat revascularization and may result in death. The lesion may also be amenable to thrombolytic therapy, angioplasty, or both.\r"

The 25-hydroxyvitamin D (OHD) concentrations increased to well above normal but the values returned to the normal range before each subsequent dose. The 24,25- and 25,26-dihydroxyvitamin D ([OH]2D) levels followed a pattern similar to that of 25-OHD, and both were closely related to the latter (r = 0.85, p less than 0.005, and r = 0.84, p less than 0.005, respectively). The 1,25-(OH)2D concentrations did not vary in a consistent pattern and remained largely within the normal range. All infants had normal Ca levels before the first dose but 14 infants (34%) later had one or both Ca values above the upper normal limit of 2.80 mmol/L (2.81-3.32 mmol/L), indicating that the vitamin D doses were excessive despite the lack of accumulative increases in serum vitamin D concentrations.\r"

Lymphocyte proliferation to T and B cell mitogens, lymphocyte subpopulations with monoclonal antibodies, and plasma pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP) were measured before and after 1 and 2 mo of supplementation. After 1 and 2 mo plasma PLP levels increased by 195 +/- 88 nM and 201 +/- 84 nM, respectively, in subjects receiving PN. With PN supplementation, lymphocyte proliferation increased significantly in response to phytohemagglutinin (p less than 0.01), pokeweed mitogen (p less than 0.01), and Staphylococcus aureus (Cowain I) (p less than 0.05). For PN-treated subjects with low presupplement plasma PLP levels, lymphocyte blastogenesis also increased significantly (p less than 0.01) in response to concanavalin A. Percentages of T3+ and T4+ but not T8+ cells increased significantly (p less than 0.05) in PN-treated subjects. These results suggest that improving vitamin B-6 status is important in stimulating immunocompetence in the elderly.\r"

Peripheral blood leukocytes (PBLs) from 35 chronic carriers of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) were studied in vitro for their immune response to a purified preparation of HBcAg isolated from circulating Dane particles. PBLs from all the studied HBsAg-positive patients yielded a stimulation index above 3, with values ranging from 3.1 to 38.1. None of the healthy seronegative subjects, taken as control group, had a stimulation index above 2, with a mean value +/- SD of 1.28 +/- 0.35. Levels of PBL stimulation correlated with the histologic activity of liver disease, and the differences reached statistical significance. These results indicate that lymphocyte response to HBcAg may be relevant in determining liver cell damage.\r"

Additional laboratory studies demonstrated decreased activities of plasma factors II, VII, IX, and X; near normal levels of immunologically detected and calcium binding-independent prothrombin; undercarboxylation of prothrombin; excess circulating vitamin K epoxide; decreased excretion of carboxylated glutamic acid residues; and abnormal circulating osteocalcin. These results all are consistent with effects resulting from decreased posttranslational carboxylation secondary to an inborn deficiency of vitamin K epoxide reductase. This individual also had nasal hypoplasia, distal digital hypoplasia, and epiphyseal stippling on infant radiographs, all of which are virtually identical to features seen secondary to first-trimester exposure to coumarin derivatives. Therefore, by inference, the warfarin embryopathy is probably secondary to warfarin's primary pharmacologic effect (interference with vitamin K-dependent posttranslational carboxylation of glutamyl residues of various proteins) and may result from undercarboxylation of osteocalcin or other vitamin K-dependent bone proteins.\r"

The molecules are comprised of 24 heavy and light subunits, the heavy:light ratio varying widely in a tissue-specific manner. We cloned DNA sequences for both the heavy (HL217-1) and light (HL227) subunits from a cDNA library derived from messages that are strongly regulated during in vitro-induced differentiation of a promyelocytic leukemia cell line, HL-60, into either neutrophils or macrophages. The heavy-subunit family (FTH) includes 15-20 genes and/or pseudogenes; the light-subunit family (FTL) includes at least three genes. We have confirmed and extended the chromosomal localization of the heavy-subunit \"genes\" to chromosomes 1-6, 8, 9, 11, 13, 14, 17, and X. We have also identified and characterized two genetic polymorphisms: FTH/BamHI and FTH/TaqI. FTH/BamHI localizes to chromosome 3, is biallelic, and has a heterozygosity frequency of .39, a minor allele frequency of .33, and a polymorphic information content (PIC) of .34. FTH/TaqI is measured by the presence or absence of a single 6-kb fragment that is absent (i.e., \"homozygosity\" being presumed) in approximately 63% of Caucasians (PIC = .27). We discuss the possibility that gene-family probes that hybridize to many discrete members of dispersed gene families could be used in conjunction with pulsed- or inverted-field gels to screen a large number of specific genomic regions for microdeletions.\r"

  ".W": "Because of evidence of immunoregulatory effects of short-term administration of pooled donor gamma globulins, the effects of intravenous immune serum globulin were studied in nine adult patients with common variable hypogammaglobulinemia over a two-year period. Baseline assessment prior to immune serum globulin replacement included evaluation of B cell function, suppressor cell activity, and T cell subsets. These analyses were subsequently performed during the course of a first-year treatment period of intravenous immune serum globulin at doses of 100 to 200 mg/kg per month and a second-year trial at doses of 300 to 400 mg/kg per month. Five patients were re-evaluated following discontinuation of the intravenous immune serum globulin therapy for four months between the first and second treatment periods. During both treatment periods with intravenous immune serum globulin, suppressor cell activity increased markedly compared with baseline, and declined following discontinuation of drug therapy in the five patients. Suppressor cell activity was reversed by either irradiation of the T cell fraction or removal of the T8-positive cell fraction by flow cytometry. There was a reduction in the absolute number of total lymphocytes, the T3-positive cells (total T cells), and the T4-positive cells (helper cells) following intravenous immune serum globulin therapy; however, the percentages of the T cell subsets did not change significantly. Following immune serum globulin therapy, the number of T8-positive cells was not significantly changed but the T4:T8 ratio decreased from 2.1 at baseline to 1.5 after therapy (p greater than 0.05). These data demonstrate that long-term intravenous immune serum globulin administration modulates the immune system by increasing suppressor T cell functional activity but is not accompanied by changes in the number of T8-positive cells in the peripheral blood.\r"

Reported in this study are two cases of torsade de pointes occurring during the prolonged administration of pentamidine. In addition, electrocardiographic changes of marked QT interval prolongation, pronounced precordial T wave abnormalities, and ST segment changes were shown in both patients. Mild hypomagnesemia coexisted in both cases, but torsade de pointes persisted in one patient and electrocardiographic changes remained in both cases despite magnesium replacement. QT interval prolongation and electrocardiographic abnormalities resolved slowly over several days to weeks, paralleling the known elimination kinetics of pentamidine. These data suggest a proarrhythmic effect of pentamidine isethionate.\r"

Sucralfate significantly reduced mucosal erosions induced by aspirin alone and aspirin combined with bile acids at pHs of both 1.5 and 6.5.

  ".W": "Seventy-four medical and surgical patients having a minimum of two risk factors for stress-related gastric mucosal bleeding were prospectively selected randomly to receive prophylaxis by antacid titration (to maintain a gastric pH of more than 4) or with sucralfate suspension (1 g/10 ml every four hours). Gastric aspirates were monitored every two hours for pH and overt and occult bleeding. Despite a significantly greater severity of illness in the sucralfate group (p less than 0.01), no significant difference in overt or occult bleeding between the groups could be demonstrated. Low-grade occult blood loss occurred frequently in both groups, but only one of the 74 patients (four risk factors, sucralfate group) had significant stress-related bleeding as defined by preset criteria and documented by endoscopy. The effectiveness of sucralfate appeared unrelated to acid neutralization in keeping with its classification as a cytoprotective agent. There were eight antacid-related side effects (four severe diarrhea, four hypermagnesemia), and none related to sucralfate. Sucralfate suspension was safe and effective and had fewer side effects than antacid titration for the prophylaxis of stress-related bleeding in critically ill patients.\r"

Luminal administration of sucralfate (0.5 g/liter) caused marked stimulation of bicarbonate secretion by isolated amphibian gastric mucosa but not duodenal mucosa. In a higher dose (1 g/liter), duodenal bicarbonate secretion was also stimulated. These effects are likely to be due to endogenous prostaglandin formation since they are inhibited by indomethacin. The results suggest that the cytoprotective action of sucralfate is due to stimulation of endogenous prostaglandin formation and may involve various mucosal defensive factors.\r"

Rats that had been fasted were pretreated intragastrically with either sucralfate 160 mg/kg, 15(R)15-methyl prostaglandin E2 16 micrograms/kg, cimetidine 100 mg/kg, or an equal amount of vehicle alone (control). One hour later, all rats received 1 ml of 99.5 percent ethanol orally and were killed 15 minutes or 24 hours later. Stomachs were removed, and mucosal damage was assessed macroscopically as well as by scanning electron microscopy. Pretreatment with either 15(R)15-methyl prostaglandin E2 or sucralfate significantly reduced the number and extent of ethanol-induced mucosal gastric lesions; pretreatment with cimetidine, however, failed to produce positive results. It is concluded that the abilities of 15(R)15-methyl prostaglandin E2 and sucralfate in protecting against ethanol injury are comparable.\r"

Plasma levels of these three vitamins in 15 healthy volunteers were measured five times over a 24-hour period. Highly sensitive and specific HPLC assays were used. Mean +/- SEM levels for R, E, and CAR were 591 +/- 36 ng/mL, 10.3 +/- 0.6 micrograms/mL, and 271 +/- 28 ng/mL, respectively. Differences between subjects' mean levels were large and highly significant (p less than 0.0001). Relative to the first 8 AM fasting plasma sample, nonfasting plasma levels drawn over the next 24 hours showed no statistically significant or clinically important changes. The percent increases in standard deviation among subjects due to diurnal variation were 1.5%, 3.3%, and 2.3%, respectively, for R, E, and CAR. This implies that sample sizes for cross-sectional studies investigating differences between two treatments in these vitamin plasma levels would need to be increased by 3%, 7%, and 5%, respectively, if measurements are to be taken throughout the day. Plasma levels may be obtained at random during the day, and need not be 8 AM fasting levels. The small addition in variation introduced by diurnal fluctuations would have minimal impact upon the precision of estimates of treatment effect and sample sizes.\r"

  ".U": "88021223\r", 
  ".W": "Prostaglandins have been implicated by previous investigators in the pathogenesis of the nephrotic syndrome. A single subcutaneous injection of 1 mg/kg of stable analogs of prostaglandins E1 or F2 alpha (15[S]-15-methyl -PGE1 [M-PGE1] and -PGF2 alpha [M-PGF2 alpha]) was found in the present study to dramatically decrease proteinuria on Day 10 of puromycin aminonucleoside (PAN) nephrosis in Lewis rats. The decrease in proteinuria was mediated at least in part by a decrease in glomerular filtration rate (GFR), as quantitated by inulin clearances in nephrotic control and prostaglandin-treated rats. M-PGE1, moderately, and M-PGF2 alpha, to a lesser degree, also decreased the GFR in normal rats. Interestingly, the GFR was dramatically decreased in nephrotic as compared with nonnephrotic control rats, which suggests that PAN nephrosis may not be an ideal experimental model for human minimal change nephrosis in which the GFR is usually not severely compromised. The prostaglandin-induced decrease in GFR in both nephrotic and normal rats was coincident with a drop in systemic blood pressure. Nephrotic rats, however, had a slightly higher baseline blood pressure than normals, and the hypotensive effects of both prostaglandins were much less in nephrotic than in normal rats. The decrease in proteinuria was not related to a cytoprotective effect, as indicated by the failure of daily doses of 5 micrograms/kg M-PGE1 to reduce proteinuria 6, 8, or 10 days after injection of puromycin aminonucleoside. The similar antiproteinuric effects of prostaglandin synthesis inhibitors and of pharmacologic doses of prostaglandins are somewhat paradoxical but are reminiscent of the similarly paradoxical mutual antiinflammatory effects of these agents. The high doses of prostaglandins required to reduce proteinuria as well as their reduction of blood pressure and GFR will limit their clinical usefulness in the nephrotic syndrome.\r"

Two of the cases containing EBV DNA were of the nodular sclerosing type and had received prior therapy; the other 2 were classified as mixed cellularity Hodgkin's disease and had not received therapy before the biopsy tissue was obtained. Analyses of the terminal portions of EBV genomes indicated a monoclonal or oligoclonal proliferation of EBV-infected cells in the tissues studied. In contrast, none of the 21 cases had detectable cytomegalovirus DNA sequences. The identification of EBV DNA may reflect the proliferation of lymphoblastoid cells due to the reduced immune competence frequently noted in Hodgkin's disease or may indicate the presence of EBV genomes within Reed-Sternberg cells.\r"

Prior cigarette smokers had higher SCN levels when compared to PC users who had never smoked cigarettes, smoked a larger number of tobacco products per day, and reported inhaling into the chest more often. Prospective data on baseline cigarette smokers demonstrated that smokers who stopped all tobacco products had a greater drop in SCN and CO than those who switched to PC. The findings strongly suggest that cessation of all tobacco products is the best strategy for decreasing exposure to tobacco smoke.\r"

Of the groups that received total intravenous anaesthesia, propofol provided stable anaesthesia but required extra bolus doses. Recovery was the most rapid following total intravenous anaesthesia with propofol. Postoperative side effects were much lower after propofol.

To evaluate the role of baroreflex mechanisms in sustaining these conditions, the effects of two infusion rates of propofol (54 and 108 micrograms.kg-1.min-1) to supplement 66% nitrous oxide in oxygen anesthesia were studied in twelve ASA class I patients having a mean age of 34 years. Baroreflex control of heart rate was studied by perturbing the patients' arterial pressure with phenylephrine or sodium nitroprusside. Valsalva maneuvers were used to assess the response of the systemic arterial system. Steady state anesthesia at both infusion rates was not associated with decreased sensitivity of the baroreflex control of heart rate, but resetting of the reflex occurred to allow lower arterial pressures for a given heart rate than in the awake state. During propofol infusions at either rate, the diastolic pressure overshoot normally associated with the relief of raised airway pressure in the Valsalva maneuver was significantly reduced. It is concluded that propofol/nitrous oxide anesthesia is not associated with impairment of baroreflex sensitivity, but that central sympatholytic and/or vagotonic mechanisms enable low heart rates to be sustained despite decreased arterial pressures.\r"

Previous laboratory data suggested that CaEBs might alter the response to alpha-adrenergic stimulation. The authors tested the hypothesis that CaEB therapy altered alpha-adrenergic responsiveness in patients chronically treated with CaEBs. Twenty-six consenting patients with coronary artery disease were given a phenylephrine challenge before anesthesia induction and during cardiopulmonary bypass while the aorta was cross-clamped. A log dose response curve was constructed for each patient, and the ED30 (dose producing 30% increase in systemic vascular resistance) was calculated. Nine patients not treated with CaEB served as controls, and 17 patients were treated with nifedipine (n = 7) or diltiazem (n = 10). Mean ED30 was increased approximately three-fold in the CaEB treated groups compared to the control group. However, there was no statistical difference in the ED30 or phenylephrine dose response slopes between CaEB treated and untreated patients. In awake patients, ED30 correlated with nifedipine levels (R = 0.953, P = 0.01). There was a significant (P less than .02) shift in the ED30 from prior to anesthesia to during aortic cross-clamp and cardiopulmonary bypass; ED30 was approximately 50% less and correlated with CaEB level (R = 0.713, P = 0.03). Hemodynamic variables were not different between groups at any interval. Our data suggest that vascular responsiveness to phenylephrine in patients treated with CaEBs is diminished, but similar to that in untreated patients. Vascular responsiveness decreases in awake patients with increasing nifedipine levels.\r"

LV dP/dtmax and LV end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP) remained unaffected when nifedipine was infused in the awake patients. Verapamil significantly decreased LV dP/dtmax in patients while awake, but LVEDP did not change. Both calcium entry blocking drugs caused decreases in blood pressure and systemic vascular resistance, accompanied by increases in heart rate. The only significant differences between the awake and the anesthetized patients were the absence of changes in heart rate and the greater reduction in LV dP/dtmax following administration of the calcium entry blocking drugs during anesthesia. Possible explanations for this may include the drugs' combined interference with calcium ion fluxes within the myocardial and smooth muscle fibers, the ability of halothane to modify the response of the autonomic nervous system to the calcium entry blocking drugs and altered kinetics of the calcium entry blocking drugs induced by the volatile anesthetic. It is impossible to determine from the present investigation which of these mechanisms is predominant.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of elective coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and the associated endocrine stress response on natural killer (NK) cell activity in peripheral blood, the distribution of lymphocyte subpopulations, and the phytohemagglutinin (PHA)-induced lymphocyte transformation were studied in 20 patients anesthetized with either etomidate-high dose fentanyl (75-125 micrograms . kg-1) or midazolam-low dose fentanyl (less than 20 micrograms . kg-1). The endocrine response to surgery was measured as changes in serum cortisol, plasma epinephrine, and norepinephrine. Compared with control values, a significant increase of NK cell activity was found in both groups prior to induction of anesthesia, followed by a decrease after induction until initiation of cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) and a gradual increase to levels exceeding controls during CPB. Postoperatively, NK cell activity and the lymphocyte transformation to PHA stimulation were significantly depressed for at least 1-3 days. These changes were accompanied by severe lymphopenia affecting the T-lymphocytes (T3, T4, and T8) and the NK cells (Leu 11). Apart from a delayed cortisol increase in the etomidate group, the endocrine response showed a similar pattern in the two groups. Compared with control values, a significant decrease in the serum cortisol until CPB could be demonstrated, followed by a significant increase persisting for at least 6 days postoperatively. The plasma catecholamines showed a steep rise and, consequently, a significant increase during CPB, followed by a gradual return to control values in the postoperative period. The results indicate that, in patients undergoing CABG, immune surveillance is impaired prior to CPB and during the early postoperative period.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Alpha-1-PI was isolated from rat plasma by affinity chromatography on Sepharose-bound anhydrochymotrypsin, DEAE-cellulose anion-exchange, and Sephadex G-150 gel filtration. The product was radiolabeled using non-oxidative conditions with Bolton-Hunter reagent, and an aliquot subsequently oxidized with N-chlorosuccinimide. Turnover studies in rats indicated that both native and oxidized alpha-1-PI had half-lives of 170 min. Using partially purified human neutrophil methionine sulfoxide-peptide reductase (Met(O)PR), it was demonstrated that oxidized product could be converted back \"in vitro\" to an active inhibitor of elastase. To assess whether oxidized alpha-1-PI underwent reduction \"in vivo,\" methionine-oxidized rat inhibitor was injected into the rats, aliquots of plasma samples were withdrawan and passed through a Sepharose-bound anhydrochymotrypsin affinity resin, and bound functional alpha-1-PI was eluted with 0.1 M chymostatin. Radioactive counting of bound and unbound fractions indicated that reduction does not occur in vivo and suggested that, at least under homeostatic conditions, the Met(O)PR is confined to intracellular sites where it does not have access to the circulating protein.\r"

To evaluate the acute effect of smoking on enzyme activity, a second group of ten smokers was studied. After refraining from smoking for 12 hours, each person smoked three cigarettes. The mean A-alpha-1-21 level in the second group of smokers was not different from that in the first group of smokers (1.8 nmol/L compared with 2.0 nmol/L) but was fivefold higher (95% CI, 2.6 to 8.7) than that in the nonsmokers (1.8 nmol/L compared with 0.4 nmol/L; p less than 0.0001).

Treatment with IGIV blocked the production of HSV antibody by infected mice and reduced the number of trigeminal ganglia containing latent virus. Removal of neutralizing antibody from the IGIV pool did not eliminate the protective effect, whereas F(ab)2 fragments of IGIV, which had virus-neutralizing activity that was identical to that of native IGIV, conferred no protection against death. Pooled human IGIV was effective for the prevention and treatment of HSV encephalitis in mice. Antibody-mediated protection required the Fc portion of the immunoglobulin molecule but did not require the direct neutralization of virus.\r"

A dose of 3 mg/kg reduced mortality by 50% in lethally challenged normal mice; 10 mg/kg was required in immunosuppressed mice. When 15 mg/kg was given, the onset of treatment could be delayed for 64 h after lethal challenge. DHPG did not prevent the establishment of latent MCMV infection or immunosuppression-induced reactivation. The antibody titer to MCMV in DHPG-treated mice which survived lethal challenge was 41 (reciprocal of geometric mean) 4 to 5 weeks after inoculation; such mice survived a second lethal challenge. When antiserum treatment was begun 64 h and DHPG was begun 72 h after a lethal challenge, most mice survived; most did not when either treatment alone was begun at those times. In summary, DHPG effectively treated lethal MCMV infection even in immunosuppressed mice and even when treatment onset was delayed for 64 h. Treatment did not alter the establishment or reactivation of latent infections or the induction of effective immunity. The administration of DHPG coupled with antiserum treatment may be even more effective than the administration of either alone.\r"

Transfer of ermZ from C. difficile to S. aureus was achieved by means of the filter mating technique, suggesting that (conjugative?) intergeneric exchange between clostridia and staphylococci may also occur in nature. S. aureus transcipients were shown to contain additional DNA from C. difficile besides ermZ.

Plaque-purified clones derived from the original clinical sample were heterogeneous with respect to plaque size and drug susceptibility. The heterogeneity of this viral mixture was also evident from varied 125I-labeled 5-iodo-2'-deoxycytidine autoradiographic patterns and from varied expression of dThd kinase-associated phosphorylating activities. Four clones from this mixture were 1-beta-D-arabinofuranosylthymine (ara-T) susceptible and ACV resistant. Extracts of cells infected with these clones catalyzed the phosphorylation of ara-T but little of ACV. The virus-coded dThd kinase was purified from one of these clones to determine whether its substrate specificity was altered. The amount of virus-coded dThd phosphorylating activity with the cell extracts was estimated to be sevenfold lower with the resistant clone than with the MS strain of herpes simplex virus type 2. The dThd kinase eluted from a dThd-agarose affinity column under the same conditions with extracts from both sources and substrate saturations of both enzymes by acyclic nucleoside analog phosphate acceptors were classical hyperbolic functions. However, there were significant differences in the kinetic parameters of substrates between the two enzymes. Apparent Km (Km') values for dThd, deoxycytidine, ara-T, ACV, and the acyclic guanosine analog 9-[[2-hydroxyl-1-(hydroxymethyl)ethoxy]methyl]guaine (BW B759U) were 2- to 60-fold higher with the variant enzyme than with the enzyme from laboratory strain MS.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Pentamidine levels in blood, lung, liver and kidney samples were determined by high-pressure liquid chromatography after completion of the treatment. Efficacy was evaluated by examination of lung imprints. In the prophylactic treatment, 4.8- and 8.6-mg/kg doses of aerosolized pentamidine administered three times weekly for 7 weeks were effective in preventing P. carinii pneumonia in 80 and 100% of the rats, respectively. In the therapeutic studies, a 14.6-mg/kg dose of aerosolized pentamidine administered three times weekly for 3 weeks was effective both in curing the pneumonia and in clearing P. carinii cysts in 70% of the rats. In the remaining animals, although the pneumonia was cured, the cysts persisted. A dose-dependent effect of the drug was demonstrated in both prophylactic and therapeutic treatments. High lung/kidney and lung/liver ratios of pentamidine levels were demonstrated and were associated with good clinical, biological, and histologic tolerance.\r"

Three patients were female and one was male. All were under 40 years of age. Cervical and juxtaparotid lymph nodes were affected. Immunological staining in two cases demonstrated a population of T cells and monocytes in the necrotic areas. Necrotizing lymphadenitis is a peculiar reactive condition with a predilection for cervical lymph nodes in young women. Although the histologic features may be confused with those of malignant lymphoma, to our knowledge the natural history has been benign in all cases to date.\r"

Following topical application, rose bengal reduced surface virus titers (swabs) 1 million-fold, and residual ocular virus (eye homogenates) 32-fold, compared with controls. No infectious virus was recovered by swabbing after topical application of rose bengal. Fluorescein had no significant effect on virus replication. Thus, rose bengal, unlike fluorescein, has significant antiviral activity, and the diagnostic use of rose bengal prior to viral culture may preclude a positive result. Also, the use of rose bengal to grade keratitis in the study of new antiviral agents should be discouraged.\r"

Treatment was initiated 16, 24, or 48 hours after the induction of infection. For each interval from infection to treatment, there was a lower bacterial count and a higher rate of sterilization in the eyes in group 3 than in group 2; both treated groups had better outcomes than the untreated controls.

Nine of 88 SLE patients (10.2%) were C4A null. As detected by Southern blot analysis, the C4A gene was deleted from both chromosomes in 8 of the 9 C4A-null patients. Deletions affecting only 1 chromosome (heterozygous) were detected in the remaining C4A-null patient and in 34.5% of SLE patients who were not C4A deficient (compared with 12.5% of controls; P less than 0.05). These results indicate that deletion of the C4A gene is a common genetic marker for SLE. Deletions of C4A were observed most commonly as part of the HLA-B8;DR3 extended haplotype, although deletions were also detected in different HLA haplotypes. Because of the critical role of C4A in the processing of immune complexes, deficiency of C4A may, itself, confer susceptibility to the development of SLE.\r"

Lower CR1 levels were found predominantly among patients with JRA (mean 57%) compared with 40 age-matched controls (mean 68%) (P = 0.008). The CR1 levels differed when the JRA patients were grouped by mode of disease onset and by clinical state at the time of testing (levels in patients with pauciarticular disease were higher than those in patients with polyarticular disease, and levels in patients with polyarticular disease were higher than those in patients with systemic disease) or by sex (girls had higher levels than boys; P = 0.01). The levels of circulating IC and C3d were elevated in 25% and 40% of JRA patients, respectively, and were mutually correlated (P less than 0.05, tau = 0.20). A negative correlation was found between levels of C3d and the numbers of CR1 (P less than 0.01, tau = -0.28), but concentrations of circulating IC did not correlate with CR1 values. CR1 levels were the same in 6 HLA-B27 positive and 25 HLA-B27 negative patients. These findings do not represent conclusive evidence that the number of CR1 on erythrocytes serves as a predictor of disease severity or as an indicator of disease activity in patients with JRA.\r"

Analysis of combined data from the 13 patients revealed statistically significant improvement in 5 clinical indicators of disease activity at the end of TLI and 6 and 12 months later, accompanied by T4-specific immunosuppression. Management considerations resulted in the introduction of prednisone therapy in 5 patients, methotrexate in 4, and azathioprine in 1 during the interval of 8-12 months post-TLI. Herpes zoster occurred in 5 patients prior to the initiation of this additional therapy. These data indicate that, in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, a TLI dose of 2,000 cGy is sufficient to produce measurable benefit that lasts for 6 months, and that the improvement can be maintained at 12 months by the use of prednisone and methotrexate.\r"

  ".W": "Impaired cell-mediated immunity has been consistently demonstrated in patients with advanced head and neck squamous cancer (HNSC); however, the results of prior studies of correlations of cellular immune parameters with treatment outcome have been inconsistent, and routine assessment of immune parameters has been of limited clinical use. To determine the prognostic importance of alterations in the proportions of various T-lymphocyte subpopulations in the peripheral blood of patients with HNSC, levels of T3, T4, T6, T8, T9, T10, T11, and Leu 7 cells were quantitated by flow cytometry in 80 previously untreated patients and prospectively correlated with tumor characteristics and clinical course (median length of follow-up, 27 months). The mean helper/suppressor cell ratio (T4/T8) increased progressively with increasing tumor stage and was significantly elevated among patients with cancer as a group and in patients with advanced (stage III or IV) disease compared with 40 normal subjects. Decreased disease-free survival was significantly associated with elevated T4/T8 ratios and low percent T8 and T11 cell levels. The prognostic significance of percent T8 (cytotoxic/suppressor) cell levels persisted even after adjusting for known prognostic factors of tumor stage, T class, N class, and tumor site. These correlations provide new insight into immune alterations in HNSC that may prove useful in identifying patients with early clinical disease who have a poor prognosis.\r"

Pretreatment with fentanyl resulted in prolonged apnoea in four patients. No serious side effects occurred. The pharmacokinetics of propofol in unpretreated patients who were maintained with nitrous oxide in oxygen only can be described by a three-compartment open mammalian model with very rapid distribution (T1/2 alpha about 3 min), rapid elimination (T1/2 beta 45 min) and a slower final phase (T1/2 gamma about 300 min). The total body clearance of propofol was rapid (1.91 litre min-1). Propofol was initially distributed into a relatively large central compartment (41.3 litre) and was extensively redistributed (Vss 305 litre; V gamma 722 litre). Throughout the sampling period the mean blood concentrations of propofol for the patients pretreated with fentanyl were about 50% higher than the mean concentrations for patients maintained with nitrous oxide only. Mean propofol concentrations for the patients maintained with halothane were intermediate between those of the other two groups.\r"

This assay uses rhodamine hydrocarbon tagged, purified HTLV-I virions according to the procedure originally described for avian retroviruses. Successful HTLV-I transmission was detected by analysis of integrated HTLV-I DNA, virion-associated reverse transcriptase, and/or intracellular HTLV-I core antigen p19 expression. Only a specific virus-cell interaction was detected because nonrhodamine-tagged homologous virus or related HTLV-II interfered with tagged HTLV-I binding. In contrast, an unrelated, nonlabeled animal retrovirus was unable to block tagged HTLV binding. Of the cell lines tested, 2 nonlymphoid mammalian and 3 human lymphoid bound significantly high to moderate levels of HTLV-I-tagged virions. The other three human lymphocyte cell lines were insensitive to HTLV-I adsorption. A direct correlation was observed between HTLV-I binding sites and infectivity of human lymphoid cells alone and not other nonlymphoid animal cells. Fresh normal human mononuclear cells bound low levels of HTLV-I virions. As expected, T lymphocytes demonstrated more binding than did the non-T cell population. Enhancement of HTLV-I cell binding in a subpopulation of mononuclear target cells was achieved with phytohemagglutinin (PHA) activation and interleukin 2 (IL2) stimulation, which correlates well with previously published infectivity studies.\r"

A filter with tortuous capillary-sized channels permits a study of the effect of shearing forces at different pressures. Native, heparinized, citrated and EDTA blood and platelet-rich plasma (PRP) were forced through the filter. Normal and von Willebrand's blood were studied, as were the effects of antibodies to platelet glycoproteins (GPr) and to von Willebrand's factor (vWf) and of \"membrane-active\" drugs. Normally, the filter blocked at 40 mmHg but not at 5 mmHg. Transmission electronmicroscopy of the filter at 40 mmHg showed blockage by platelet aggregates. Initially, the mean transit time through the filter was 8 milliseconds. Platelet retention in the filter occurred in two phases. From 0 to 3 seconds, only high-shear, vWf, and GPrIIb/IIIa were required. From 10 to 20 seconds, retention presumably involved these three attributes, but divalent cations were also essential. Only this phase was inhibited by some membrane-active drugs. ADP- and thrombin-induced aggregation requires GPrIIb/IIIaand fibrinogen. Shear-induced blocking of the filter by blood with a normal concentration of fibrinogen requires GPrIIb/IIIa and vWf. This indicates a different type of exposure of GPrIIb/IIIa. The long bleeding time in vW disease highlights the absolute requirement for vWf and emphasizes the difference in exposure of GPrIIb/IIIa induced by shear stress. Evidently, a process similar to that occurring in the filter is required in normal capillary hemostasis.\r"

The significance of this interaction is unclear, however, because it has not been possible to detect vWf binding to GPIIb/IIIa on platelets stimulated in plasma. We have developed an indirect, flow cytometry assay that uses fluorescein-labeled antibodies to detect vWf and fibrinogen on platelets. Using this assay, we found vWf on the surface of platelets stimulated in plasma by ADP. The number of platelets that bound vWf increased in proportion to ADP concentration and incubation time. Washed platelets in a protein-free buffer activated by 1 mumol/L calcium ionophore A23187 or 10 mumol/L ADP also bound vWf, suggesting that we were detecting surface binding of alpha-granule-derived vWf. Monoclonal antibodies against the vWf binding site on GPIb (6D1) and the vWf and fibrinogen binding sites on GPIIb/IIIa (LJP5 and LJ-CP8, respectively) were used to characterize the mechanism of vWf binding to stimulated platelets. Ristocetin-induced binding of vWf was inhibited by 6D1, and ADP-induced binding of fibrinogen was inhibited by LJ-CP8. None of these antibodies inhibited ADP-induced vWf binding. Aspirin and prostaglandin E1 also inhibited ADP-induced binding of vWf in platelet-rich plasma. During platelet activation in plasma, vWf derived from alpha-granules becomes bound to the platelet surface possibly being transferred already associated with a binding site.\r"

  ".W": "The aim of this study was to investigate the relative contribution of direct contact with stromal cells v stromal cell-derived soluble mediators to the differentiation of B lymphocytes and cells from other hematopoietic lineages. This was investigated by making a comparison between hemopoietic cells grown in direct contact with stroma to those in diffusion chambers (DCs) placed over purified populations of stroma. The source of stromal cells was adherent layers from myeloid or lymphoid long-term bone marrow cultures that had been treated with mycophenolic acid, an antibiotic that depletes hemopoietic cells from the cultures but retains a functional stroma. The cells seeded into the chambers were fresh marrow cells that had been passed through two consecutive nylon wool columns to deplete cell populations capable of forming an adherent cell layer in vitro. DCs were placed in wells in which the adherent stroma, growing under myeloid or lymphoid conditions, was present. The results indicate that progenitors of granulocytes and macrophages survived and differentiated in DCs under myeloid culture conditions, as the number of cells and absolute number of CFU-GM increased over that present in the reseed population. These levels, however, were markedly less than in parallel cultures in which the cells were seeded directly onto stroma. Hematopoiesis in DCs placed over hemopoietically active stroma was not optimal, suggesting that factors were used by those hemopoietic cells closest to the stroma. A B lymphocyte precursor survived in DCs under myeloid but not lymphoid conditions, and its differentiation into B lymphocytes was dependent on close association with stromal cells; B lymphopoiesis initiated when cells from DCs grown under myeloid conditions were harvested from the chambers and seeded directly onto stroma initiated and maintained under lymphoid bone marrow culture conditions. B lymphopoiesis did not initiate if the DC from the myeloid conditions was left intact and placed directly over a lymphoid stromal cell layer in lymphoid conditions.\r"

  ".W": "To evaluate relationships between c-fos proto-oncogene expression and specific lineages of hematopoietic differentiation we analyzed the constitutive and TPA-induced expression of the c-fos gene in a wide variety of fresh human leukemic cells. High constitutive c-fos expression was detected in acute leukemias with monocytic phenotype (FAB M4/M5) and in subsets of B lymphoid leukemias, some of which coexpressed B lymphocytic and monocytic markers. Conversely, low basal levels of c-fos transcripts were found in pure acute granulocytic leukemias (FAB M1/M2/M3), in erythroleukemias (FAB M6), in the great majority of B, and in all T lymphoid leukemias. TPA-induced c-fos expression seems to correlate with monocytoid differentiation only when sustained levels of transcripts (ie, detectable for at least 24 hours) were detected. Sustained c-fos expression was in fact observed only in those myeloid or lymphoid cells that acquired a stable monocyte-like phenotype in response to the phorbol ester. These results indicate that high constitutive c-fos expression may identify myelomonocytic-oriented forms of leukemia, specific subsets of B lymphoid malignancies, and at least some cells terminally differentiated in vitro to a monocyte-like phenotype. c-fos oncogene expression can therefore be regarded as an additional marker for the subclassification of human leukemias.\r"

In this study we characterize the mutant beta-globin gene from this delta beta-thalassemia chromosome. An A to G transversion is identified in the \"ATA\" sequence of the promoter region that leads to decreased expression of the beta-globin gene in vivo and in vitro. We also demonstrate the presence of this mutation in every individual with a high fetal hemoglobin phenotype in this family and its absence in every individual with a normal hemoglobin phenotype. This same promoter mutation has recently been detected in Chinese beta-thalassemia genes where it is present on chromosomes of the same haplotype as that of the delta beta-thalassemia chromosome we are studying. These data support the hypothesis that an as yet unidentified mutation occurred on the ancestral chromosome carrying the promoter mutation and subsequently gave rise to the delta beta-thalassemia phenotype.\r"

  ".W": "The large granular lymphocyte (LGL) population, which effects a natural killer (NK) function, consists of cells whose lineage derivation has not been clearly established on the basis of phenotypic and functional properties. To clarify the relationship of LGL/NK cells to T cells we studied patterns of rearrangement and expression of the T cell receptor (Ti) genes alpha, beta, and gamma in normal human LGLs; in CD8+, CD8-, Mol+, and Mol- LGL subsets; and in 17 cases of leukemic LGL proliferations (T gamma LPD). T alpha, T beta, and T gamma genes were not expressed, nor were T beta and T gamma genes rearranged in normal LGLs or LGL subsets. The T gamma LPD were divided into two groups. One group (15/17 cases) was characterized as CD3+ and displayed Ti gene rearrangements. Seven of these cases were reactive with monoclonal antibody WT31, which suggested expression of an alpha/beta heterodimer on the cell surface. The other group (2/17 cases) was CD3- with unrearranged Ti genes. These results indicate that the normal LGL/NK population is homogeneous and distinct from the normal T cell population because it does not express, and as a result, cannot effect its immune function through the T cell receptor molecules. Conversely, T gamma LPDs represent a heterogeneous group of lymphoproliferative diseases within which the CD3-, Ti- cases most likely represent the neoplastic counterpart of normal LGL cells. The more frequent CD3+ cases may be related to recently described NK-like T cells. The observations that normal LGLs maintain germline T gamma genes and that many CD3+ T gamma LPD display an alpha/beta heterodimer suggest that a T gamma-containing receptor may not be necessary for NK or NK-like cytotoxicity.\r"

The binding of purified human vWF to human type III collagen was found to be specific. At saturation, 38 to 50.2 micrograms of vWF bound per milligram of collagen. Scatchard plots derived from binding isotherms demonstrated the presence of at least two classes of binding sites. Purified vWF was digested with S aureus V-8 protease into two complementary fragments (SpIII and SpII). SpII, the C-terminal end of vWF (amino acid residues 1,366 to 2,050), was totally devoid of affinity for collagen. Contrarily, purified SpIII, the N-terminal part of vWF (residues 1 to 1,365), totally displaced vWF binding and specifically bound to collagen. At saturation, 25 to 45 micrograms of SpIII bound per milligram of collagen. Scatchard plots demonstrated the presence of a single class of binding sites. SpIII was further digested with the same enzyme to generate SpI, a 52-kilodalton fragment from the C-terminal part of SpIII (residues 911 to 1,365). Spl induced a dose-dependent inhibition of both vWF and SpIII binding to collagen. A series of six monoclonal antibodies against SpIII that completely abolished vWF and SpIII interaction with collagen also bound to SpI. In conclusion, SpI extending between amino acid residues 911 and 1,365 of vWF contains a specific site that interacts with human type III collagen.\r"

  ".W": "This study demonstrates that when platelets are stimulated by thrombin in the presence of low concentrations of purified human fibrinogen (10 to 20 micrograms/mL, final concentration) binding of released platelet von Willebrand factor (plt-vWF) to the platelet membrane is enhanced. This effect appears to be mediated by fibrin monomer produced by the action of thrombin on the fibrinogen in the incubation suspension. When fibrin polymerization is inhibited, the binding of released plt-vWF to the platelets is markedly increased. This enhanced binding is dependent on platelet glycoprotein Ib (GPIb) as shown by a decreased response with Bernard-Soulier platelets and inhibition by both monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies against glycocalicin. The binding of fibrin to thrombin-activated platelets preincubated with monoclonal antibody against GPIIb/IIIa is increased when the predominant form of fibrin is fibrin monomer. The fibrin binding is also decreased in the presence of antibody against glycocalicin. Our data demonstrate that fibrin monomer facilitates plt-vWF binding to the glycocalicin portion of platelet GPIb on thrombin-stimulated platelets and that binding of fibrin monomer to glycocalicin is necessary for this response to occur.\r"

Both low-density bone marrow cells separated by discontinuous Percoll gradients and a T cell-depleted and progenitor-enriched cell fraction obtained by the combination of counterflow elutriation centrifugation and Percoll gradients were examined in LDA. GCT (monocytoid cell line-conditioned medium containing GM-CSF), human placenta-conditioned medium, bladder carcinoma cell line 5637-conditioned medium (containing GM- and G-CSF), and recombinant CSF (G-CSF) directly induced proliferation of progenitors with single-hit kinetics. In some instances, however, PHA-stimulated lymphocyte-conditioned medium (containing G- and GM-CSF) showed deviation from single-hit kinetics, which demonstrated the presence of factor(s) suppressive to progenitor growth. In a T cell-depleted, progenitor-enriched fraction, PHA alone was found to suppress progenitor growth at a level as low as 100 ng/mL. The addition of hydrocortisone (10(-6) mol/L) increased the progenitor frequency but suppressed progenitor growth at 10(-4) mol/L. LDA appears to be a valuable method for exploring mechanisms of factors regulating hematopoietic cell growth.\r"

The same mutation with a similar phenotype, was observed in her mother and sister, by Southern blotting analysis of DNAs digested with Mspl, the recognition site of which was created by this base substitution. This indicates a close relationship between this mutation and the beta-thalassemia phenotype. No anomalous peak of radioactivity was detected by reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) in the patient's reticulocytes incubated with isotopically labeled amino acid. The leucine-proline (Leu-Pro) substitution probably disrupts the G-helix and in turn interferes with globin contact points. The uncombined beta-globin chain would be rapidly destroyed and the beta-thalassemia phenotype would follow.\r"
