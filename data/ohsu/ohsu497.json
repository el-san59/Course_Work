Thirty five of the pancreases were preserved using hypothermic storage for up to 43 hours and 45 minutes, using either albumin-augmented crystalloid or hyperosmolar colloid preservation solution. The one-year actuarial graft survival was 12 per cent for segmental pancreas transplants and 42 per cent for whole pancreas grafts. The use of cyclosporine after whole pancreas transplantation as well as improved surgical techniques for exocrine drainage contributed to the improvement in graft survival in the whole pancreas graft group.\r"

DESIGN: Prospective, multicenter, randomized, parallel group, double-blind placebo-controlled 12-week trial. PATIENTS: Two hundred and one functional class I and II patients with definite or classic rheumatoid arthritis, previously untreated with disease modifying antirheumatic drugs. INTERVENTIONS: Patients were withdrawn from nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug therapy. Those who flared were randomly assigned to amiprilose HCl, 6 g/d, or placebo for 12 weeks. No concomitant anti-inflammatory or antirheumatic drug therapy was permitted during the study. Combination acetaminophen and propoxyphene napsylate was the only supplemental analgesic medication allowed. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The number of painful joints and swollen joints, joint pain and joint swelling indices, left and right grip strength, investigator global assessment, and patient global assessment returned to baseline for the amiprilose group and showed statistically significant (P less than 0.05) differences from the placebo group within 4 to 6 weeks. The protocol criteria for overall therapeutic response were satisfied by 41% of the amiprilose patients, compared with 21% of the placebo group (P = 0.003). Approximately 0.5 tablet per day less analgesic medication was taken by the amiprilose group (P less than 0.05 at weeks 6 and 12). There were no statistically significant differences in morning stiffness, walking time, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, or rheumatoid factor between the groups. A similar number of adverse experiences were reported by the patients on amiprilose (67%) and on placebo (63%). One patient on amiprilose developed thrombocytopenia of unknown cause; no other reported adverse effects were serious. CONCLUSIONS: Amiprilose HCl has significant anti-inflammatory activity and a favorable safety profile when used as the sole antirheumatic therapy in patients with active rheumatoid arthritis. Synthetic carbohydrates may represent an important new class of drugs for the treatment of inflammatory, autoimmune diseases.\r"

DATA IDENTIFICATION: A manual search of the English-language literature using Index Medicus (1970-1988) and a bibliographic review of identified articles. STUDY SELECTION: We found 40 articles that described long-term survival of healthy individuals who either had had an abnormal finding on a resting ECG or had not had an abnormal finding. DATA EXTRACTION: We pooled the pertinent studies and calculated the relative risk for coronary artery disease if an ECG finding was present and the 95% confidence limits (CI) on the relative risk. RESULTS OF ANALYSIS: One reason for doing a screening SCG is to detect disease whose effects can be prevented by early treatment. In population studies of healthy middle-aged men, frequent ventricular premature beats, left axis deviation, left ventricular hypertrophy (ECG-LVH), and changes indicative of myocardial ischemia are all associated with a small but statistically significant increase in the risk of dying from coronary artery disease. There is no evidence that early detection of these findings leads to a clinical intervention that improves health outcomes. A screening ECG can also serve as a \"baseline\" tracing. Two studies have shown that the baseline tracing has little effect on decision making in the emergency room. CONCLUSION: The evidence does not support doing a screening ECG in men without evidence of cardiac disease or cardiovascular risk factors.\r"

DATA IDENTIFICATION: An English-language literature search using MEDLINE (1970 to 1988). Index Medicus (1970 to 1988), and bibliographic reviews of textbooks and review articles. STUDY SELECTION: Of 103 originally identified articles, 58 that specifically addressed the stated purpose were selected. DATA EXTRACTION: Four authors reviewed and critiqued the literature extrapolating the major themes on this topic. RESULTS OF DATA SYNTHESIS: There is little information on the many psychosocial variables that affect an adult's long-term cancer survival trajectory. Collation of data identified the following significant psychosocial themes: fear of recurrence and death, relationships with the health care team, adjustment to physical compromise, alterations in customary social support, isolationism, psychosocial reorientation, and employment and insurance problems. CONCLUSIONS: The continuation of a rehabilitation effort begun around the initial diagnosis of cancer would be instrumental in providing post-therapy evaluation and guidance needed by adult long-term survivors of cancer. Education, research, and support interventions need to be mobilized for this population of adults with a history of cancer.\r"

DESIGN: Open-label, single-center study in two parts. The first part was a bioavailability study in which six subjects received a single 1800-mg oral dose and a single 225- or 300-mg intravenous dose. The second part was a study of the dose-response relation between dextran sulfate and total plasma lipolytic activity in which twelve subjects were given a single infusion of either 0.05, 0.5, 5, or 50 mg of dextran sulfate. SUBJECTS: Eighteen healthy volunteers. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: In the bioavailability study, plasma and urine dextran-sulfate concentrations were measured by a competitive binding assay after each dose. In addition, two bioassays were used to assess plasma concentrations: plasma lipolytic activity and activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT). After the oral dose, plasma concentrations were not measurable with the competitive binding assay (lower limit of sensitivity, 1 microgram/mL); less than 0.5% of the dose was recovered in the urine, the APTT did not increase, and the median increase in the plasma lipolytic activity was only twofold (maximum increase, 11-fold). In contrast, after the intravenous dose of 225 mg, peak plasma concentrations by competitive binding assay were 26 to 35 micrograms/mL (median, 28 micrograms/mL); 25% to 29% (median, 25%) of the dose was recovered in the urine; the APTT increased to 3.5 to 9.2 times the baseline value (median increase, 6.9 times), and the plasma lipolytic activity increased by 185 to 548 times the baseline value (median increase, 438 times). In the dose-response study, intravenous doses as low as 0.5 mg produced significant increases in the plasma lipolytic activity. There was a steep dose-response curve between 0.5 and 50 mg. CONCLUSION: Dextran sulfate is very poorly absorbed after oral administration.\r"

The primary structures of the HLA-B27 antigens have been determined. At least six variants exist. However, disease predisposition does not appear to be restricted to a particular variant. One hypothesis about the pathogenesis of arthritis is that the bacteria that cause the arthritis carry components that are cross-reactive with HLA-B27 antigens. Several reactive bacterial components have indeed been identified using monoclonal anti-HLA-B27 antibodies. Even more striking is the identification, through a computerized search, of a Klebsiella protein. This protein carries a stretch of six amino acids identical to residues 72 to 77 of two of the HLA-B27 variants. A synthetic peptide carrying these six amino acids of HLA-B27 protein is reactive with serum antibodies in some patients with arthritis. With this knowledge, investigators will be able to formulate new approaches for examining the pathogenesis of HLA-B27-associated arthritis.\r"

DATA IDENTIFICATION: Publications appearing between 1980 and 1988 were identified by computer searches using MEDLINE and CANCERLIT, by reviewing the table of contents of recently published journals, and by searching bibliographies of identified books and articles. STUDY SELECTION: More than 700 articles, including peer-reviewed articles and book chapters, were identified and selected for analysis. DATA EXTRACTION: The literature was reviewed and 235 articles were selected as relevant and representative of the current issues and future applications for in-vivo monoclonal antibodies for cancer therapy and of the toxicity and efficacy which has been associated with clinical trials. RESULTS OF DATA SYNTHESES: Approaches include using antibody alone (interacting with complement or effector cells or binding directly with certain cell receptors) and immunoconjugates (antibody coupled to radioisotopes, drugs, toxins, or other biologicals). Most experience has been with murine antibodies. Trials of antibody alone and radiolabeled antibodies have confirmed the feasibility of this approach and the in-vivo trafficking of antibodies to tumor cells. However, tumor cell heterogeneity, lack of cytotoxicity, and the development of human antimouse antibodies have limited clinical efficacy. Although the immunoconjugates are very promising, heterogeneity and the antimouse immune response have hampered this approach as has the additional challenge of chemically or genetically coupling antibody to cytotoxic agents. CONCLUSIONS: As a therapeutic modality, monoclonal antibodies are still promising but their general use will be delayed for several years. New approaches using human antibodies and reducing the human antiglobulin response should facilitate treatment.\r"

Since these studies have direct bearing on the prevention of atherothrombotic brain infarction, this review emphasizes those advances in treatment resulting from their findings. The two most prominent theories on the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis relate to aberrations in lipoprotein metabolism and to enhanced proliferation of smooth muscle cells; likely, the theories are complementary. As a practical guideline for preventive therapy, the importance of using the total cholesterol level is stressed, although finer distinctions must rely on the low-density and high-density lipoprotein concentrations and their normalization. Since prevention of stroke may ultimately be its most effective therapy, consideration of cholesterol level, akin to strategies for preventing coronary heart disease, and efforts to avert platelet adhesion or aggregation and coagulation are warranted.\r"

A test protocol was employed that allowed: (1) examination of the efficacy of MK-801 against several parameters that gauge different aspects of epileptogenesis; (2) determination of the time-action profile of these effects; and (3) examination of the toxicity of MK-801 in animals experiencing seizures. The drug was found to be potent against the spread of seizures but less effective against parameters linked to partial seizures. At the higher doses of the drug required to truncate hippocampal afterdischarges, considerable neurotoxicity was encountered. In addition, the antiepileptic effects of MK-801 showed a use dependence so that, at a given time after the drug was administered, a greater suppression of seizures was noted if there had been preceding seizures in the presence of the drug than if there had not been. These findings indicate that there may be limitations to the clinical utility of MK-801 as an antiepileptic agent and that the drug may provide greatest benefit when used for the suppression of seizure generalization and when seizures are closely spaced.\r"

However, antibodies that react in vitro with gangliosides have recently been found in sera of a large majority of patients with classical amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and other motor neuron syndromes. A working hypothesis is proposed, suggesting how antibodies might be related to the disease process. The hypothesis attempts to account for (1) a pathogenic role of antibodies directed against the carbohydrate components of glycolipids, (2) the selectivity of the process for motor neurons, (3) an antibody-mediated mechanism that could result in apparently degenerative neuropathological changes without signs of inflammation, and (4) a type of autoimmune response that is extremely difficult to suppress by conventional means. Although the evidence for this hypothesis is by no means complete, its critical features are all testable.\r"

Compared with the suckling mouse assay the sensitivity of the ELISA was 87% and the specificity was 99.8%. The mean age of the children with E coli that produced heat stable enterotoxin was 22 months. Fifteen (48%) of the children had ingested potentially contaminated food and five (17%) had a previous contact with someone with diarrhoea. The clinical picture was milder than that described in developing countries. Faecal osmolality and the osmolal gap were consistent with a secretory diarrhoea in 12 out of 15 (80%) of these children. The mean duration of the diarrhoea was five days. Heat stable enterotoxin produced by E coli is a common cause of mild diarrhoeal illness in Italian children.\r"

The pressure level varied throughout the infection, but a higher median pressure (19 mm Hg) was found when this was measured on the day of admission. The clinical features of the meningitis in these patients suggest that many of the presenting symptoms and signs are those of pressure. These results show that high pressure is frequently present in childhood meningitis, not just in those who die from cones or who have radiological evidence of hydrocephalus. We conclude that raised cerebrospinal fluid pressure is a frequent accompaniment of childhood meningitis and may need treatment in its own right and is therefore one further important factor influencing the course and outcome of childhood meningitis.\r"

Patient triggered ventilation was maintained till final extubation in 13 of the infants without complications. Only one infant developed a pneumothorax, but in the remaining eight infants (who tended to be less mature (p less than 0.01) it had to be discontinued after only a few hours. Predictors of failure of patient triggered ventilation at one hour were both a lack of improvement in oxygenation, and a relatively slow triggering rate that was related to gestational age. We conclude that long term patient triggered ventilation is practical for preterm neonates, but only for those more mature than 28 weeks' gestational age.\r"

Urinary excretion of dinor-thromboxane B2 and dinor-6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha was increased when the persistent pulmonary hypertension was associated with group B streptococcal (n = 2) and pneumococcal (n = 1) sepsis. Based on urinary metabolite excretion, endogenous formation of thromboxane A2 and prostacyclin did not consistently differ from normal neonates in four patients with non-septic persistent pulmonary hypertension (hyaline membrane disease (n = 2), asphyxia, and meconium aspiration). These data suggest that thromboxane A2 is not a universal mediator of persistent pulmonary hypertension. It may, however, have a role in the pathophysiology of early onset group B streptococcal disease, and persistent pulmonary hypertension of other infectious aetiology. If these findings are confirmed by further studies, thromboxane synthetase inhibition or receptor antagonism may offer a potential therapeutic approach in neonates with persistent pulmonary hypertension associated with sepsis.\r"

  ".U": "89373067\r", 
  ".W": "Hypoxic-ischaemic injury to the brain is an important cause of perinatal death and seems to be the commonest cause of permanent neurodevelopmental disability in newborn infants who survive after intensive care. If this type of brain injury is to be prevented and treatment put on a rational basis, non-invasive methods are required for defining its mechanisms. This review has considered two such methods: magnetic resonance spectroscopy and near infrared spectroscopy. Magnetic resonance spectroscopy is used to measure, in brain tissue, the concentrations of the 'high energy' phosphorus metabolites that are dependent for their synthesis on the processes of oxidative phosphorylation. Intracellular pH can also be measured. Normal maturational changes in the brain have been defined and abnormalities detected in a range of conditions where hypoxic-ischaemic injury was suspected to have occurred. In laboratory animals the acute effects of curtailment of oxygen supply to the brain ('primary' energy failure) have been observed, and the effects of two commonly used treatments, infusions of sodium bicarbonate and glucose, have been tested. After resuscitation of newborn infants from severe intrapartum asphyxia, a latent period has often been noted before energy failure became detectable. This 'secondary' energy failure is due to a variety of damaging reactions initiated by the acute hypoxicischaemic episode and reperfusion of the brain. It is possible that in the future irreversible injury to brain cells following the episode may be prevented or ameliorated by the prompt use of cerebroprotective agents. The extent of abnormalities detected by magnetic resonance spectroscopy has prognostic implications: evidence of severe energy failure in the first days of life was regularly associated with subsequent death or with severe neurodevelopmental impairments. Many technical developments in magnetic resonance spectroscopy are under way, particularly employing proton (1H) spectroscopy, which will allow the intracerebral concentrations of a wide range of metabolites, including neurotransmitters, to be measured. The combination of spectroscopy with magnetic resonance imaging will permit quantitative data to be obtained from selected volumes within the brain. Near infrared spectroscopy is used to make observations at the cotside of the intracerebral concentrations of the chromophores oxyhaemoglobin, deoxyhaemoglobin, and oxidised cytochrome aa3, and it therefore provides information complementary to that obtained by magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Measurements can also be made of cerebral blood flow, cerebral blood volume, and other haemodynamic indices; in addition, the rea\r"

  ".W": "Since our report at the 1984 American Surgical Association meeting of 100 pancreas transplants from 1966 through 1983, another 190 have been performed. The current series, begun in 1978, now numbers 276 cases, and includes 133 nonuremic recipients of pancreas transplants alone (PTA), 46 simultaneous pancreas/kidney transplants (SPK), and 97 pancreas tranplants after a kidney transplant (PAK). Duct management techniques used were free intraperitoneal drainage in 44 cases, duct occlusion in 44, enteric drainage in 89, and bladder drainage in 128. The 1-year patient and graft survival rates in the entire cohort of 276 were 91% and 42%. One-year patient survival rates were 88% in the first 100, 91% in the second 100, and 92% in the last 76 cases; corresponding 1-year graft survival rates were 28%, 47%, and 56% (p less than 0.05). A prospective comparison of bladder drainage (n = 82) versus enteric drainage (n = 46) in PAK/PTA cases since November 1, 1984 favored bladder drainage (1-year graft survival rates of 52% vs. 41%) because of urinary amylase monitoring. The best results were in recipients of primary SPK bladder-drained transplants (n = 39), with a 1-year pancreas graft survival rate of 75%, kidney graft survival rate of 80%, and patient survival rate of 95%. Logistic regression analysis, with 1-year graft function as the independent variable, showed significant (p less than 0.05) predictors of success (odds ratio) to be technique: bladder drainage (5.8) versus enteric drainage (2.5) versus duct injection (1.0); category: SPK (6.0) versus PAK from same donor (3.2) versus PAK from different donor (1.2) versus PTA (1.0); and donor HLA DR mismatch: 0 (5.0) versus 1 (2.5) versus 2 (1.0) antigens. On April 1, 1989, 90 patients had functioning grafts (60 euglycemic and insulin-free for more than 1 year, 10 for 5 to 10 years); these, along with 24 others whose grafts functioned for 1 to 6 years before failing, are part of an expanding cohort in whom the influence of inducing a euglycemic state on pre-existing secondary complications of diabetes is being studied. Only preliminary data is available. In regard to neuropathy, at more than 1 year after transplant in patients with functioning grafts, conduction velocities in some nerves were increased over baseline. In regard to retinopathy, deterioration in grade occurred in approximately 30% of the recipients by 3 years, whether the graft functioned continuously or failed early, but thereafter retinopathy in the patients with functioning grafts remained stable.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

Immediate postsurgical bile drainage was achieved in 103 infants (82%). Reoperation during the first 6 postoperative weeks restored bile flow in 14 of 18 infants who had shut down. Seventy-two patients (57%) had sustained (more than 1 year) relief of biliary obstruction. Postoperative morbidity was substantial. The six children not having corrective surgery died within 19 months. Three patients were lost to follow-up. Sixty-eight patients having Kasai's operation died, 55 from complications of liver disease, 1 from a coexisting malformation, and 12 after liver transplantation. Fifty-seven patients are alive, 13 by virtue of liver replacement, 9 with mild-to-moderate hepatic sequelae, and 35 (28%) with normal to near-normal liver function. Although none is considered \"cured,\" the 35 children are anicteric, have normal growth and development, and participate in full school activities (including contact sports). Average follow-up is 85.8 months (range 1 to 15 years).\r"

Ischemic cardiomyopathy is now the major indication for cardiac transplantation. The 2-year survival of medically treated patients with ejection fractions less than 20%, but who are not sufficiently symptomatic for cardiac transplantation, is less than 25%. At our institution we have taken an aggressive approach by using myocardial revascularization for chronic ischemic cardiomyopathy. Between 1983 and 1988, 39 patients with preoperative ejection fractions less than 20% underwent coronary artery bypass. Patients were excluded if they had valvular heart disease other than mild to moderate mitral regurgitation, required resection of a left ventricular aneurysm, or required emergency operation for acute coronary occlusion. Mean age was 63.3 years (range, 43 to 80 years) and 31 were men. Mean preoperative ejection fraction was 18.3% (range, 10% to 20%) and the mean preoperative left ventricular end diastolic pressure was 22 mm Hg (range, 8 mm Hg to 38 mm Hg). There was one operative death (2.6%). Mean follow-up was 21 months (range, 3 to 60 months) with eight late deaths (a total mortality rate of 21%). Seven deaths were due to arrhythmias. Three patients continued to have severe heart failure, one of whom underwent successful cardiac transplantation. By life table analysis, there was a 3-year survival rate of 83%. With the present shortage of cardiac transplant donors, myocardial revascularization for ischemic cardiomyopathy is a reasonably effective means for preserving residual ventricular function.\r"

In an effort to identify atherosclerotic disease of the ascending aorta which might predispose to embolization, intraoperative B-mode ultrasonography was performed in 50 patients. The aorta was imaged from the aortic annulus to the origin of the innominate artery in transverse and longitudinal views. The results were compared with visual and tactile examination of the aorta for the presence of atherosclerosis. Ultrasonic imaging demonstrated atherosclerotic disease in 29 patients (58%). Visual examination and palpation identified atherosclerosis in 12 patients (24%). The amount and location of plaque was sufficient to require a change in the site of arterial cannulation or the proximal vein graft anastomoses or the technique of cardiopulmonary perfusion in 12 of the 50 patients (24%). All 12 patients were 65 years of age or older. Palpation underestimates the presence of atherosclerotic disease in the ascending aorta. Intraoperative ultrasonography accurately identifies patients with atherosclerotic disease of the ascending aorta. This allows the surgeon to modify cannulation, perfusion, and operative techniques to reduce the risk of perioperative stroke due to the embolization of atherosclerotic debris from the ascending aorta.\r"

  ".U": "89373215\r", 
  ".W": "Between December 1980, when immunosuppression with cyclosporine was introduced, and May 1988, 288 patients underwent primary transplantation for end-stage cardiac disease (group TX). Fourteen patients underwent retransplantation for accelerated graft atherosclerosis (group RTXAGA), and 9 underwent retransplantation for intractable acute allograft rejection (group RTXREJ). Cumulative patient follow-up was 724 patient-years (range, 1 month to 7.5 years; mean, 2.3 years). Within the first 3 postoperative months, no differences were noted between groups for linearized rates of infection or rejection except between the rate of rejection for group TX (1.69 +/- 0.09 events/100 patient-days) and group RTXAGA (0.94 +/- 0.3 events/100 patient-days) (p less than 0.02). No significant differences existed between groups for actuarial rates of remaining rejection-free or infection-free for more than 7.5 years. No significant differences in actuarial survival existed except between group TX (81% +/- 2% at 1 year and 58% +/- 4% at 5 years) and group RTXREJ (44% +/- 17% at 1 year and 44% +/- 0% at 5 years) (p less than 0.05). We conclude that patients who undergo retransplantation for accelerated graft atherosclerosis experience a lower rate of early rejection and similar rates of infection and survival compared with patients who receive primary transplants. Cardiac retransplantation for rejection incurs rejection and infection at rates similar to those of primary procedures. However, patients who undergo retransplantation for rejection survive these complications significantly less often than do patients who receive primary transplants. This information should be considered when scarce donor hearts become available and retransplantation is contemplated.\r"

Although the physiological principles involved were described in the late 19th century, the first clinical application was not until 1955. Because many surgeons believed that myocardial injury resulted from the toxicity of the agents used, the technique was largely abandoned for about 15 years. With the increasing volume of coronary revascularization surgery and with the need for protection of donor hearts intended for orthotopic transplantation, chemically induced cardiac standstill became more appealing and the technique was revived and reevaluated in several centers. In the last several years, the constitution of cardioplegic solutions and the methods by which they are delivered have been greatly modified. Although the most effective solution and technique may yet remain to be described, unquestionably controlled chemically induced cardiac standstill has contributed substantially to the ease and safety with which cardiac surgical procedures can be accomplished. This vignette, although far from complete, outlines some of the important works that have contributed to the evolution of cardioplegic techniques.\r"

This report covers four major aspects of prosthesis characteristics. (1) Implantability: Essentially stable, viable tissue-to-prosthesis linkage is achievable with a porous fixation element. (2) Hemodynamics: Minimal resistance and efficient opening and closing are best attained with bioprostheses and homografts. (3) Thromboembolism: Thromboembolism is a persistent problem with mechanical valves. It is minimized by biological valves and abolished, experimentally, by appropriately encapsulated implants. (4) Durability: Mechanical valves are best. Tanned bioprostheses undergo \"spontaneous degeneration\"; untanned homografts are a little better. Knowledge and technology are needed to develop a synthetic leaflet membrane that possesses inherent physical, visco-elastic-rheologic properties of natural valve leaflets and is compatible with natural healing processes.\r"

We conducted a computer search of English-language literature using a Medline database and review of bibliographies of identified articles. Sixty-four case reports containing sufficient data about patients' demographics and clinical response to therapy to allow evaluation were combined with three previously unreported cases. The mean time to clinical response was 6.8 days when supportive measures alone were used in the treatment of neuroleptic malignant syndrome. The addition of dantrolene (response time, 1.15 days) or bromocriptine (response time, 1.03 days) significantly shortened the time to clinical response. We conclude that the addition of either dantrolene or bromocriptine to conservative measures decreases the time to clinical response. A randomized trial would address potential case selection biases.\r"

To evaluate this hypothesis, we studied 291 women who presented with acute urinary symptoms for association of clinically defined bacterial vaginosis and vaginal conditions associated with this syndrome (increased vaginal fluid pH, absence of lactobacilli, and abnormal vaginal fluid gas-liquid chromatographic patterns) with E coli introital colonization and urinary tract infection. Escherichia coli introital colonization and urinary tract infection were both significantly more frequent among women with a high vaginal fluid pH, an absence of vaginal lactobacilli, or an abnormal vaginal fluid gas-liquid chromatographic pattern characteristic of bacterial vaginosis. Escherichia coli introital colonization was also more frequent in women with bacterial vaginosis. These associations and an association of bacterial vaginosis and E coli urinary tract infection were strong only among the 144 women who were diaphragm users. We conclude that bacterial vaginosis, or an altered vaginal microflora as reflected by an abnormal gas-liquid chromatographic pattern characteristic of bacterial vaginosis, is associated with E coli introital colonization and acute symptomatic urinary tract infection in women who use diaphragms.\r"

Five patients were examined for effects of the combined treatment on blood pressure and renal function. After percutaneous transluminal renal angioplasty on one renal artery, the blood pressure (mean +/- SD) fell from 210/118 +/- 26/8 to 176/104 +/- 11/9 mm Hg without any deterioration of renal function. This reduced blood pressure was further lowered to 155/92 +/- 6/3 mm Hg by adding captopril therapy. This level of blood pressure has been maintained for an average of 37 months. Significant increases in serum creatinine concentration were not observed (124 +/- 27 vs 141 +/- 44 mumol/L), and renal size has been sustained. These results indicate that combined treatment with percutaneous transluminal renal angioplasty and captopril is effective in reducing the blood pressure and preserving renal function as an approach for the patients with bilateral atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis.\r"

To illustrate this concept, its applications and limitations, we review the literature on the primary and secondary treatment of hypercholesterolemia, present the attributable risk reduction, and describe its implications for clinical practice.\r"

  ".W": "The whole-day blood pressure response to once-daily and twice-daily administration of a combination of captopril and hydrochlorothiazide was measured in a study of elderly patients (aged 59 to 78 years) with mild to moderate hypertension. Whole-day automated ambulatory blood pressure profiles were obtained at baseline, after 8 weeks of therapy with a combination of 25 mg of captopril and 15 mg of hydrochlorothiazide twice daily, and again after 8 weeks of once-daily therapy with 50 mg of captopril and 25 mg of hydrochlorothiazide. Average systolic and diastolic whole-day blood pressures significantly decreased from baseline during both twice-daily treatment (mean +/- SEM change, 18 [+/- 3]/10 [+/- 2] mm Hg) and once-daily treatment (11 [+/- 2]/9 [+/- 1] mm Hg). While the decrease in systolic blood pressure during once-daily therapy was less than that during twice-daily therapy for the group as a whole, 16 of 19 patients achieved normal systolic (less than 140 mm Hg) and diastolic (less than 90 mm Hg) blood pressures throughout the day during the once-daily regimen. During once-daily therapy, the blood pressure reductions were sustained throughout the 24-hour period, and were not attenuated during the final 2 to 4 hours before the next dose. A subgroup of 5 patients were identified who appeared unresponsive to both twice-daily and once-daily antihypertensive treatment. Despite hypertensive office-measured blood pressures at entry to the study, 4 of these 5 patients actually had normotensive whole-day blood pressure averages at baseline (mean, 131 [+/- 7]/81 [+/- 4] mm Hg). Thus, whole-day ambulatory blood pressure monitoring is a valuable tool for testing treatment responses. It demonstrated that once-daily treatment with low doses of captopril and hydrochlorothiazide was as effective as twice-daily administration in decreasing diastolic pressures throughout the day, but was slightly less effective in decreasing systolic pressures. Additionally, the monitoring identified apparently normotensive patients in whom treatment may not be indicated.\r"

Plasma angiotensinogen (renin substrate) concentrations were increased eightfold to 10-fold in the two patients in whom these concentrations were measured. One of these two patients also showed a 34-fold rise in plasma inactive, active, and total renin concentrations, and an elevated plasma renin activity (2.73 ng.L-1.s-1 angiotensin l/mL/h). Inactive renin (prorenin) constituted 90% of the total plasma renin concentration. In the third patient only plasma renin activity was measured, and this was considerably raised (6.05 ng.L-1.s-1; angiotensin l/mL/h). Thus, the arterial hypertension that rarely complicates hepatocellular carcinoma may be caused either by a combination of eutopic synthesis of excessive quantities of angiotensinogen and ectopic production and secretion of active renin by malignant hepatocytes, or by eutopic production of angiotensinogen alone.\r"

These patients, referred to as simple mood reactive depressives, were contrasted with previously published data from 180 atypical depressives. Atypical depressives had the presence of at least one vegetative atypical sign (hypersomnia, hyperphagia, leaden feeling, or rejection sensitivity) but were otherwise indistinguishable from simple mood reactive depressives. In contrast to the atypical depressives for whom phenelzine was effective and imipramine was relatively ineffective, both medications were equivalently good in simple mood reactive depressives. Since all groups did poorly when given a placebo and well when given phenelzine, the salient feature of atypical symptoms may be that they predict poor response to imipramine. Since the difference between imipramine and placebo depends on the diagnostic group, pharmacologic dissection suggests that atypical symptoms in patients with nonautonomous mood may delineate a qualitatively distinct subgroup.\r"

All children were studied in a low-stress environment. There were no significant differences in plasma cortisol concentration among the three groups as measured by 24-hour mean, peak, nocturnal rise, or nadir values. Division of the MDD group into subgroups based on endogenicity, psychotic symptoms, and suicidality also failed to reveal significant differences for cortisol secretion. Hypersecretion of cortisol (defined as 2 SDs above the grand mean) was identified in only four children with depressive illness and one normal control. Following clinical recovery, 24 depressed children were restudied in a drug-free state and compared with themselves during the episode of illness and with both groups of controls. No significant differences in plasma cortisol concentrations were found. All four depressed hypersecretors were restudied after clinical recovery, and one showed persistence of hypersecretion. These results suggest that abnormalities of cortisol secretion occur infrequently in prepubertal children with major depression when they are studied in a nonstressful environment.\r"

An indirect fluorescent antibody (IFA) test has been developed using monoclonal antibodies specific for antigens on the surface of P carinii. We tested the sensitivity and specificity of this IFA test for detecting P carinii in respiratory specimens of immunocompromised patients with pulmonary symptoms undergoing bronchoscopy. Both the bronchial wash and bronchoalveolar lavage specimens of patients with and without P carinii pneumonia were studied. The bronchoalveolar lavage and bronchial wash specimens were examined using modified Wright-Giemsa and methenamine silver stains. In addition, aliquots of the specimen were fixed and stained with IFA and read with a fluorescent microscope. Fifty-nine patients were found to have P carinii organisms. The bronchial wash specimen has been shown to be less sensitive than the bronchoalveolar lavage specimen for detecting the presence of P carinii. In the bronchial wash specimen from these 59 patients, only 60% had positive modified Wright-Giemsa stains, and 70% had positive methenamine silver stains. The IFA stain was positive in 93% of the specimens tested (significantly higher than the other two stains). There was only one false-positive IFA test result among the 54 patients tested with negative results. We found the IFA stain to be superior to conventional stains when examining less-than-adequate specimens, such as those from bronchial washes.\r"

Relative to control animals, only minor alterations in the plasma amino acid concentrations were observed in sterile inflammation and sepsis. In liver, concentrations of alanine, serine, threonine, asparagine, proline, and glycine were significantly increased to the same extent in sterile inflammation and sepsis, while hepatic glutamine concentrations were significantly decreased. Compared with sterile inflammation, the branched-chain amino acid concentrations were depressed in the liver of septic animals. Following administration of dichloroacetate, hepatic alanine concentrations were significantly reduced more than threefold in each of the conditions examined; in contrast, significant increases in hepatic concentrations of threonine, glycine, glutamine, glutamate, histidine, and proline were observed. Also following administration of dichloroacetate, the branched-chain amino acid concentrations were all significantly elevated in each of the conditions examined, and plasma alanine concentrations were significantly decreased, while those of glutamine and glycine were significantly increased. These results demonstrate that there is a disassociation between the plasma and hepatic concentration of free amino acids in sterile inflammation and sepsis. Furthermore, the results demonstrate that some of the alterations in hepatic amino acid metabolism may be reversed pharmacologically by dichloroacetate.\r"

  ".W": "Group B streptococcal sepsis was associated with delayed presentation of an unsuspected right-sided diaphragmatic hernia in two neonates. These unusual clinical observations and a review of 24 similar cases from the literature form the basis of this report. Infants present with respiratory distress during the first few hours of life and have group B streptococcal sepsis confirmed by results of blood cultures. The right side of the diaphragm appears normal on the initial chest roentgenogram in the majority of cases. After initial improvement with antibiotic therapy and ventilatory support, sudden deterioration of respiratory status may occur. Subsequent chest roentgenograms often demonstrate herniated viscera in half of the cases, while ultrasound examination, isotopic liver scan, and peritoneography are useful in achieving a diagnosis in the other cases. If recognized, survival is 100% following hernia repair. Persistent respiratory symptoms in a neonate who is recovering from group B streptococcal sepsis should prompt a careful evaluation of the right side of the diaphragm for the presence of an unsuspected posterolateral hernia.\r"

When the anatomy of the lesion was subjectively categorized by the angiographer into those considered possible or impossible to treat by conventional balloon angioplasty, clinical success was achieved in 116 (78%) of 149 lesions considered possible to treat with balloon angioplasty (39 [95%] of 41 stenoses and 77 [71%] of 108 occlusions). More importantly, clinical success was achieved in 39 (56%) of 70 lesions considered impossible to treat by conventional means. The incidence of complications, including vessel perforation (4.1%), with this new technique was equal to that reported for conventional balloon angioplasty, decreased with operator experience, and was less than that reported for argon laser angioplasty with bare fiberoptics. Thus, laser thermal angioplasty with a laser-heated, metallic-capped fiberoptic is a safe procedure that is easily learned by physicians skilled in interventional techniques. It allows for nonsurgical treatment of lesions considered difficult or impossible to treat by conventional balloon angioplasty.\r"

We have previously described a syndrome of insulin resistance, acanthosis nigricans, and acral hypertrophy with continual muscle cramping. The effect of 300 mg/d of phenytoin (Dilantin) on muscle cramping and carbohydrate economy was studied in three affected patients and four control subjects. Oral glucose tolerance tests, euglycemic insulin infusion studies, and monocyte insulin binding tests were conducted before and after phenytoin administration. All three patients had notable improvement in muscle cramps. In response to phenytoin, metabolic improvements were variable, with improvement characteristically better in patients with less severe baseline metabolic abnormalities. Patient 1, with the mildest degree of glucose intolerance, had decreased fasting insulin and blood glucose levels, improved glucose tolerance, and insulin-mediated glucose disposal, associated with an increase in monocyte insulin receptors. Patient 2 had reduced fasting plasma glucose and insulin levels and improved oral glucose tolerance, suggesting a beneficial effect on carbohydrate metabolism. Patient 3, with the most severely impaired carbohydrate economy, showed no metabolic improvement despite marked lessening of muscle pain. These clinical characteristics were unaffected in control subjects. We conclude that phenytoin is of value in the therapy of muscle cramps and glucose intolerance in patients with this syndrome.\r"

  ".W": "In reactive arthritis (ReA), including Reiter's syndrome, a close relationship between chronic enteric and genitourinary infections and the clinical features of enthesitis has been described. In contrast, in Lyme arthritis, a distinct clinical entity, chronic infection with the tick-transmitted spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi has been associated with the disease. In a prospective study, 51 patients with ReA were tested for evidence of chlamydial and spirochetal infection. The presence of Chlamydia was determined by culture in 8 patients, and 7 additional patients had markedly elevated antibody titers. In 9 patients, antibodies specific to B burgdorferi were found. Purified peripheral blood T lymphocytes of all 9 patients proliferated specifically to stimulation with macrophages pre-pulsed with B burgdorferi antigens. Compared with other protein antigens, higher numbers of antigen-pulsed macrophages were necessary to activate B burgdorferi-specific T cells. Although antibody titers decreased in response to antibiotic treatment in 8 of 9 patients, second-line therapy with sulfasalazine or methotrexate was required to obtain clinical remission. These data suggest that chronic infection with B burgdorferi can cause ReA. In predisposed individuals, the arthritogenic immune response might be triggered by persisting infectious agents independent of their antigenic specificities.\r"

  ".W": "Neovascularization in the rheumatoid synovium plays an important role in the propagation of rheumatoid synovitis because the emigration of mononuclear cells and the growth of pannus are critically dependent on the development of small blood vessels. Inhibition of local vascular endothelial cell (EC) proliferation, which is essential for growth of these vessels, therefore, would have the potential to suppress rheumatoid inflammation. We investigated the effects of methotrexate (MTX), low doses of which are commonly administered to rheumatoid arthritis patients, on DNA synthesis by human umbilical vein EC in vitro and on rabbit corneal neovascularization in vivo. MTX inhibited both basal and EC growth factor-stimulated tritiated deoxyuridine (3H-UdR) incorporation into EC in a dose-dependent manner. Significant inhibition was observed at a concentration of 5 x 10(-9) M, which is that attained in the serum of treated patients. Neovascularization in vivo was also suppressed by low-dose intramuscular injections. These results suggest that MTX has an antiangiogenic effect, and may suppress rheumatoid inflammation through the reduction of synovial small blood vessels responsible for mononuclear cell infiltration and proliferation of synovial tissue.\r"

Lisinopril normalized blood pressure in five of nine patients (responders) and did not in the remaining four (nonresponders). PRA rose after lisinopril (4.8 +/- 2.6 ng/mL/h to 25 +/- 15 ng/mL/h, P less than 0.05) in responders, but not in nonresponders (2.0 +/- 1.4 ng/mL/h to 3.4 +/- 2.9 ng/mL/h). Glomerular filtration rate remained stable in both groups (responders: 43 +/- 11 mL/min to 43 +/- 22 mL/min; nonresponders: 39 +/- 25 mL/min to 32 +/- 21 mL/min). In the responders renal hemodynamics remained stable after lisinopril (renal plasma flow: 223 +/- 80 mL/min to 216 +/- 91 mL/min; filtration fraction: .20 +/- .04 to .20 +/- .05; renal vascular resistance: 386 +/- 179 to 326 +/- 209 units). In the nonresponders, renal plasma flow decreased (228 +/- 141 mL/min to 162 +/- 117 mL/min, P less than 0.005), filtration fraction increased (.19 +/- .08 to .24 +/- .12, P less than 0.05), and renal vascular resistance increased (695 +/- 747 to 1265 +/- 1574 units, P less than 0.05) after chronic lisinopril therapy. We conclude (1) there is a heterogeneous response to lisinopril in patients with chronic renal disease and hypertension, (2) lisinopril monotherapy may result in effective blood pressure control without renal hemodynamic compromise, and (3) an increase in PRA following converting enzyme inhibition may identify those in whom the circulating renin angiotensin system is participating in systemic hypertension and intrarenal hemodynamic changes.\r"

The objectives of our study were to compare the antihypertensive properties of linoleic acid (omega-6 series) and of fish oil fatty acids (omega-3 series) in a model of hypertension induced by the continuous subcutaneous infusion of angiotensin II in the rat and to determine whether or not their antihypertensive effects were mediated by the biosynthesis of vasodilator prostaglandins of classes 2 or 3. Linoleic acid and fish oil fatty acids (administered by subcutaneous injections) were equally potent in reducing, by half, the rise in systolic arterial pressure induced by the chronic infusion of angiotensin II. These antihypertensive effects were observed in the absence of any significant influence of either linoleic acid or fish oil fatty acids on the systemic and the renal synthesis of PGI2 or on the renal formation of PGE2 in vivo. Indomethacin caused a profound inhibition of the biosynthesis of PGI2 but not of PGE2 and could only partially neutralize the antihypertensive effects of linoleic acid and of fish oil fatty acids. These results suggest that, in this model of angiotensin II-induced hypertension, linoleic acid and fish oil fatty acids exert equipotent antihypertensive effects which are mainly independent of the prostaglandin system.\r"

We therefore studied the biosynthesis of POMC by measuring the incorporation of 3H-tyrosine into the IL of 32-week-old spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR) of the Aoki-Okamoto strain and their normotensive controls, the Wistar-Kyoto rat (WKY). Under basal conditions, POMC biosynthesis was significantly reduced in the SHR (1130 +/- 102 cpm/30 min/IL, n = 13) when compared to the WKY (1515 +/- 163 cpm/30 min/IL, N = 12, P less than 0.05, t test). There was also an inverse correlation between systolic blood pressure and POMC biosynthesis in both the WKY (Y = 8.4 +/- 1.38X + 2097 +/- 673, r = 0.86 +/- 0.06, N = 5), and SHR (Y = 5.7 +/- 1.8X + 1122 +/- 336 r = 0.57 +/- 0.13, N = 3). The decreased POMC biosynthesis was associated with a higher dopamine content in IL in SHR compared to WKY (1.56 +/- 0.53, n = 17 v 0.51 +/- 0.16, n = 17 pmol/IL, P less than 0.05, Mann-Whitney test). Oral administration of three different antihypertensive agents (propranolol, captopril, or hydralazine) for 12 weeks normalized blood pressure and POMC biosynthesis in the SHR but had no effect on either variable in the WKY. Because POMC biosynthesis in IL increased with normalization of blood pressure in the SHR, the decreased POMC biosynthesis in SHR may be a consequence rather than a cause of the elevated blood pressure in SHR.\r"

Indomethacin (IND) (150 mg/d) was administered during the last three days of each dietary period. Blood pressure and cardiac output (CO) (by impedance cardiography) were measured during the angiotensin II (Ang II) infusion before and after the IND treatment of each dietary period. In eight patients with EH, captopril 100 mg was given before Ang II infusion. EH patients were classified as either salt sensitive (SS) or nonsalt sensitive (NSS). The mean blood pressure (MBP) response to Ang II was significantly higher on high sodium intake than on low sodium intake in NSS and NT, but not in SS. IND significantly increased the MBP response to Ang II on low sodium intake in NSS and NT, but not in SS. IND significantly increased the TPR response to Ang II on low sodium intake, remarkably in NSS and NT compared with SS. Salt sensitivity (% decrease in MBP from high to low sodium intake) highly correlated with the increase in the TPR response to Ang II by IND on low sodium intake (r = -0.90). After captopril administration, IND still increased the MBP and TPR response to Ang II on low sodium intake. These results suggest that the modulation of the vascular responsiveness to Ang II by prostaglandins is altered by sodium balance and salt sensitivity in EH.\r"

  ".U": "89374856\r", 
  ".W": "Arterial hypertension is a powerful risk factor for cardiovascular disease, but the ability to use blood pressure measurements to predict complications in individual patients or small groups is limited. One possible approach to identifying hypertensive patients at high risk is based on the observation that the presence of electrocardiographic left ventricular hypertrophy (ECG-LVH) identifies individuals at severalfold higher risk than other individuals with similar blood pressure but no ECG-LVH. The suggestion that the increased risk associated with ECG-LVH is related to increased left ventricular (LV) mass has been supported by autopsy studies in which heart weight was found to be increased in patients dying of cardiovascular diseases. Unfortunately, the usefulness of LVH to predict prognosis in hypertension has been limited practically by the fact that ECG-LVH is present in only 3% to 8% of average hypertensive patients, and by the possibility that certain electrocardiographic patterns, particularly involving repolarization, might reflect undiagnosed coronary artery disease rather than myocardial hypertrophy. The development over the past dozen years of anatomically validated echocardiographic methods of measuring LV muscle mass has provided a probe that is more sensitive than electrocardiography for detection of hypertensive LVH. This method has now been utilized in studies which suggest that LV mass may be more important than blood pressure as a predictor and possible determinant of cardiovascular morbid events. It is the purpose of this review to evaluate critically these findings and other clinical and experimental evidence related to the prognostic significance and possible mechanisms of risk associated with increased LV mass.\r"

We studied the ratio of T/L Ca2+ channels in isolated, spontaneously contracting azygous venous cells of spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY) by quantitating Ca2+ currents and intracellular Ca2+ release. While total transmembranous Ca2+ current was not different between the two strains, the proportion of Ca2+ currents carried by L-type channels was enhanced in vascular muscle cells from SHR. We have recently compared subcellular distribution of intracellular free Ca2+ concentration in the same cells, at rest and during stimulation, by quantitation with a digital photon-counting camera. Fura-2 fluorescence intensity showed that Ca2+ release was principally from sarcoplasmic reticulum and that cells from SHR had higher levels of Ca2+ upon calcium channel stimulation, especially at the cell periphery. These findings suggest fundamental differences in SHR and WKY vascular muscle cells implicating the importance of changes in calcium channels, modulation of Ca2+ release, and Ca2+ uptake in SHR hypertension.\r"

  ".W": "Activation of vascular smooth muscle by angiotensin II results in the phospholipase C-mediated generation of two second messengers, inositol trisphosphate (IP3) and diacylglycerol (DG). IP3 is responsible for mobilizing calcium from endoplasmic reticulum whereas DG activates protein kinase C and ultimately Na+/H+ exchange, leading to intracellular alkalinization. The IP3/calcium signal is transient, most likely serving to initiate calcium-mediated events leading to contraction, and is attenuated by activation of protein kinase C. DG formation/protein kinase C activation is sustained and may be enhanced by the concurrent intracellular alkalinization. The delay in induction of the sustained response appears to be related to cellular processing of the angiotensin II-receptor complex. Phospholipase C activity is also modulated by a cholera toxin-sensitive, pertussis toxin-insensitive guanine nucleotide regulatory protein. This guanine nucleotide regulatory protein, movement of the receptor-ligand complex, and the signals generated by the two second messengers, IP3 and DG, interact in a complex manner to cause an integrated response of vascular smooth muscle to angiotensin II stimulation.\r"

  ".W": "In a controlled clinical trial, patients with atopic dermatitis carried out house dust mite eradication procedures on their mattresses, using natamycin or a matched placebo spray, with or without vacuum cleaning, for 4 months. For the two groups that used vacuum cleaning, mite numbers fell significantly both by comparison of mean initial and final numbers and by calculating mean rates of reduction from regression analyses (P less than 0.01 in all cases). There were no differences between the groups in the magnitude of the decreases. For the two groups that did not use vacuum cleaning, mite populations remained virtually unchanged. These results indicate vacuum cleaning not natamycin had the major effect on mite eradication. Mean symptom scores of patients in all four groups were slightly reduced by the end of the trial, but there was a greater reduction rate (P less than 0.01) in the combined scores of the groups that did not use vacuum cleaning, demonstrating a lack of correlation between improvement in clinical score and lowered mite numbers. No patients entered remission and the maximum improvement in clinical score was only 47%. Natamycin and vacuum cleaning neither alone nor in combination proved valuable in reducing mite numbers sufficiently to provide clinical benefit.\r"

The peripheral blood contained fluorocytes and porphyrin analysis of the red blood cells, urine and faeces of the patients revealed an increase of the isotype I of uro- and coproporphyrin and normal concentrations of delta-aminolaevulinate and porphobilinogen, suggesting the diagnosis of erythropoietic porphyria.

  ".W": "Oocyte donation provides an option for achieving pregnancy in women lacking functioning gonads, or in whom IVF techniques have failed to harvest adequate oocytes, or those who do not wish to use their own gametes because of hereditary disease. In agonadal women, artificial menstrual cycles are required before proceeding to gamete donation. A fixed cyclical steroid replacement schedule of oestradiol (E2) valerate and progesterone (P4) pessaries was initially used, but the need for synchrony between donor and recipient cycles, and the narrow window for implantation limited the transfer of fresh embryos. Donor-recipient cycle asynchrony can be overcome by using frozen-thawed embryos, or by extending the follicular phase in the recipient to widen the transfer window. Twenty-two pregnancies have now been achieved by the Monash/Epworth group, resulting in the birth of 13 healthy infants. There were no statistically significant differences in pregnancy rates (per transfer) between transfers in natural cycles (14%, four pregnancies) and steroid replacement cycles (24%, 16 pregnancies). Five pregnancies (36%) were established in women treated with 2 mg of E2 daily 13-18 days before embryo transfer with P4 starting on the day of or the day following oocyte retrieval. E2 was continued for a median of 85 days (range 49-110) and P4 for a median of 86 days (range 49-133) after the supposed last menstrual period. All but one delivery was by caesarean section. There were no perinatal deaths and no ectopic pregnancies.\r"

No tocolysis, analgesia or anaesthesia was used. Approximately 25% of all attempts in the study group of 90 women were successful; repeated external version resulted in cephalic presentation at delivery in 48% of patients. Spontaneous version to cephalic presentation occurred in 23 (26%) of the 90 women in the control group in whom version was not attempted, indicating a therapeutic gain from the procedure of 22%, with a 95% confidence interval of 8 to 35%. No severe complications of external cephalic version were noted. We conclude that external cephalic version reduces the frequency of breech presentation at delivery. This mainly benefits the mother because of the decrease in the number of caesarean sections and their inherent maternal morbidity.\r"

Two groups of women with ovulatory cycles were examined; women in group 1 had unexplained infertility and women in group 2 were having artificial insemination by donor because of reduced spermatogenesis; a third group (group 3) comprised women with tubal infertility undergoing hyperstimulation for in-vitro fertilization. There was no difference in endometrial thickness or reflectivity between the three groups. A basic pattern of endometrial appearance common to all cycles was found, consisting of hypoechoic, isoechoic and hyperechoic images, occurring in the early follicular, late follicular and luteal phases, respectively. In all three groups a positive correlation was found between proliferative phase plasma oestradiol concentration and endometrial thickness. Group 1 r = 0.403, P less than 0.01; group 2 r = 0.439, P less than 0.01; and group 3 r = 0.617, P less than 0.01. There was a progressive increase in endometrial growth throughout the normal cycle until a plateau was reached 5 days after the LH surge. This pattern was also seen without acceleration of the process in hyperstimulated cycles, despite supranormal levels of oestrogen. Assessment of endometrial thickness is not a useful variable in monitoring hyperstimulated cycles. No aberrations of endometrial growth or pattern were observed in the women with unexplained infertility.\r"

All but four of the 22 transfusions were associated with a decrease in resistance to flow, as shown by a reduction in the umbilical artery systolic/diastolic ratio, and this also occurred on 10 of the 13 occasions when blood sampling only was performed. These findings suggest that acute changes in blood viscosity following intravascular transfusion are not associated with an increase in resistance to flow as assessed by Doppler velocimetry. Umbilical blood sampling per se may be associated with a humorally mediated reduction in placental vascular resistance to flow.\r"

We report 2 cases of crossed aphasia after stroke and review 34 cases from the literature with anatomical documentation of lesion site.

Trauma care is governed by two underlying principles: early definitive management and a continuum of treatment from the time of injury to the return to the activities of daily life. Most important, a team approach is necessary in the treatment of the trauma patient. This requires the cooperation and participation of prehospital emergency personnel and referring hospitals as well as multidisciplinary collaboration within each trauma centre. There continue to be areas of neglect that prevent optimal trauma care and must be addressed.\r"

ALL of early-B phenotype associated with elevated cell counts occurred more often in female and infant patients than in male patients. Involvement of the central nervous system was frequent in B-ALL, which occurred mostly in male patients. A male prevalence was also seen in ALL of T-lineage in which significant differences regarding clinical characteristics and leukocyte counts appeared among the four subtypes.

The analysis was performed on paraffin sections by an immunohistochemical assay using the mouse monoclonal antibody RAP-5 and the rat monoclonal antibody Y13-259. Expression of ras p21 was assessed by staining intensity and percentage of positively stained cells. In comparison to normal gastric mucosa of non-cancer patients, p21 was overexpressed in nearly all early carcinomas of both types and in the dysplastic and/or metaplastic mucosal alterations accompanying intestinal type of gastric cancer. Increased p21 expression was also observed in the normal-appearing mucosa adjacent to early carcinomas of diffuse type, but not in the morphologically normal gastric epithelium adjacent to the intestinal type. The results of this investigation suggest that ras p21 overexpression may be related to early events of human gastric carcinogenesis. The study supports the notion of different pathways in the development of diffuse (gastric) and intestinal types of gastric carcinomas.\r"

The tumors ranged from 4.5 to 13 cm in greatest dimension and were solid, cystic, or mixed. All of them were unilateral. Review of the pathologic descriptions and illustrations of the cases in the literature and microscopic review of one reported case revealed that four of the tumors were endometrioid carcinomas, four were clear cell carcinomas, one was probably a mucinous adenocarcinoma, two were papillary adenocarcinomas of undetermined cell type, and one was a serous papillary cystadenoma of borderline malignancy with microinvasion. Three patients were treated by excision of the tumor alone. Seven of them were treated by total abdominal hysterectomy and salpingo-oophorectomy; three patients received postoperative radiation therapy, and one of them also received chemotherapy. Eight patients were free of disease 6 months to 7 years postoperatively, and one patient with distant metastasis (rib) at the time of operation lived for 27 months. In three cases no follow-up data were available. Three of the four patients in current series were found to have pelvic endometriosis at the time of operation. Three of their carcinomas were endometrioid and one was of clear cell type, suggesting the possibility of an origin from endometriotic tissue in the broad ligament.\r"

This, in turn, results in loss of cellular immune functions that causes susceptibility to infections and malignancies. Monocyte-macrophage cells are also infected but these cells are not lysed. Antigen to HIV appears in blood a few weeks after infection but disappears as antibody begins to be present.

  ".W": "The development of GnRH agonists has had a major impact on the practice of gynecology and reproductive endocrinology. The clinical usefulness of GnRH agonists will increase as modes of administration are improved and indications become better defined. GnRH agonists and, potentially, antagonists will provide a prompt, effective, and reversible method of suppressing ovarian function. GnRH agonists may soon become a treatment of choice for many of the noncontraceptive uses of oral contraceptives. Current indications for GnRH agonist administration are best divided into two groups: short-term (less than 6 months) and long-term (greater than 6 months) suppression. Short-term administration of GnRH agonist include most of the current usage of GnRH agonists. Short-term administration avoids most of the side effects of GnRH agonist and offers the most potential for development of GnRH antagonists. Short-term therapy has been shown to be particularly effective in the preoperative treatment of fibroids, suppression of ovarian function before ovulation induction, for short-term suppression of endometriosis, and for diagnostic purposes to determine whether a medical illness is related to ovarian function. Chronic administration of GnRH agonist has produced varying degrees of success. The treatment of precocious puberty is probably the perfect indication for GnRH agonist suppression. The disease is completely reversed with a remarkable absence of side effects. Long-term administration for metastatic breast or prostatic cancer has been shown to be as efficacious as other forms of gonadal suppression and the potential benefits of suppression outweigh the potential side effects of long-term suppression. The risk-benefit ratio must be carefully analyzed for the other indications for long-term suppression. Long-term suppression could be used for medical illnesses exacerbated by the menstrual cycle, painful symptoms related to endometriosis, contraception, and suppression of hyperandrogynism. Although initial studies show the agonist to be quite effective in treating all of these disorders, long-term suppression also may result in potential serious side effects related to hypoestrogenism including hot flashes and osteoporosis. Long-term administration of GnRH agonist may become feasible by lowering the dose and degree of suppression or by combining GnRH agonist with estrogen or progestin replacement, or both.\r"

  ".W": "Biophysical activities such as FBM, GBM, and accelerations in the healthy human fetus near term occur episodically in keeping with the development of behavioral states in utero. It is therefore important to allow for the normal rest-activity cycles of healthy fetuses when designing clinical strategies for the surveillance of fetal health during the antepartum period. Diurnal rhythms are present in the incidence of FBM and GBM, as well as in mean FHR. These appear to be related to intact maternal or fetal adrenal gland function. The incidence and amplitude of FBM are strongly influenced by maternal meals, and therefore by plasma glucose concentrations, whereas maternal meals have no effect on GBM or FHR accelerations. The association of FHR accelerations with GBM becomes stronger with advancing gestational age such that near term close to 90 per cent of accelerations occur with movement. Younger fetuses move overall approximately the same amount of time as term fetuses, although the movements are more frequent and of a shorter duration. Maternal smoking, and alcohol and drug ingestion all affect FBM, GBM, and FHR to various extents, underlining the importance of documenting the prior maternal use of these substances when using biophysical activities to assess fetal health in the antepartum period.\r"

With impairments in blood gas exchange this excess oxygen acts as a \"margin of safety,\" providing for the maintenance of oxidative metabolism through increases in fractional O2 extraction, although with resultant fetal hypoxemia. Increases in blood O2 capacity and redistribution of cardiac output in response to this hypoxemia further protect fetal oxygenation. Additional adaptive mechanisms involve a decrease in energy-consuming processes, including growth restriction, decreasing fetal movements, and behavioral state alterations. Although protective in so far as essential metabolic functions are maintained, pathologic change may occur as the \"oxygen margin of safety\" becomes limited or energy-conserving measures give rise to abnormal growth and development.\r"

Observation in humans and studies in animals indicate that the compromised fetus reduces its oxygen requirements by reducing activity. This fact has enabled perceived fetal movement to become a useful adjunctive test of fetal asphyxia in high-risk pregnancy. Its application to low-risk pregnancy has many attractions, particularly as approximately 50 per cent of stillbirths occur without obvious cause in normal pregnancies. Although studies suggest that such application would be beneficial, questions about acceptability, the burden of further testing precipitated by reports of diminished movement, and the perinatal implications of unwarranted early intervention need to be clarified before the universal application of fetal movement counting protocols can be recommended.\r"

Each volunteer ingested nine 325 mg doses of enteric-coated acetylsalicylic acid on three occasions, with at least 1 week between each administration period. Serum samples were analyzed for salicylic acid concentration by HPLC. Both interventions decreased peak salicylic acid concentration, time-to-zero salicylic acid concentration, and AUC when compared with control (p less than 0.01). Whole-bowel irrigation was superior to activated charcoal in sorbitol by all three criteria (p less than 0.05). Adverse effects were qualitatively and quantitatively greater during activated charcoal in sorbitol, and the volunteers preferred whole-bowel irrigation over charcoal in sorbitol.

The infusion of adenosine alone (0.07 mg/kg/min) induced an increase in heart rate of 4.7 beats/min versus 0.2 beats/min after placebo administration (p less than 0.02). The infusion of adenosine alone induced a decrease in finger skin temperature compared with placebo administration (-1.0 degrees versus 0.0 degrees C, p less than 0.01). When compared with baseline values, nicotine gum chewing increased systolic and diastolic blood pressures by 6.2 and 7.0 mm Hg, respectively (p less than 0.001), heart rate by 5.5 beats/min (p less than 0.01), and plasma adrenaline levels by 0.03 nmol/L (p less than 0.025), whereas skin temperatures fell by 1.3 degrees C (p less than 0.001). The nicotine-induced increase in heart rate was larger during adenosine infusion than during placebo administration (14.9 versus 5.5 beats/min, p less than 0.001), whereas the increment of diastolic blood pressure was lower (1.1 versus 4.0 mm Hg, p less than 0.05). The increment in systolic blood pressure was not altered by concomitant adenosine infusion. The rise in plasma noradrenaline levels during the combined administration of nicotine and adenosine differed significantly from the response to nicotine alone (+ 0.23 versus -0.05 nmol/L, p less than 0.02). We concluded that, in human beings, the characteristic hemodynamic response to adenosine infusion is enhanced by nicotine.\r"

Subjects were randomly assigned to receive a placebo and either 100 mg/day viqualine (n = 15) or 200 mg/day viqualine (n = 14) orally in a double-blind crossover study. Viqualine administration and ethanol intake were assessed by self-reports and by measurement of drug and ethanol concentrations in body fluids. Compared with placebo, 100 mg/day viqualine did not decrease ethanol intake. However, 200 mg/day viqualine significantly decreased the total number of drinks consumed in a 14-day period (F1,12 = 5.3; p less than 0.05). An increase in the number of abstinent days was significant only for those subjects who received the placebo first (F1,6 = 11.3, p less than 0.02). Subjects reported a decreased interest in and decreased desire for alcohol during viqualine treatment. Patterns of response varied, but 64% of the subjects decreased the number of alcoholic drinks consumed and/or increased the number of days of abstinence by at least 25% during treatment with 200 mg/day viqualine compared with placebo treatment. Neither dose of viqualine had an effect on cigarette smoking or on consumption of nonalcoholic beverages, but subjects showed significant decreases in body weight with both doses. These findings indicate that viqualine both attenuates ethanol intake and reduces body weight in human beings.\r"

Dosage was increased stepwise every 48 to 72 hours until arrhythmia suppression, side effects, or a predetermined maximal dosage occurred. After a pharmacokinetic evaluation, efficacy was confirmed in a double-blind, crossover protocol. One patient had unusable ambulatory ECG data. There were 14 of 19 patients who responded during dose titration; efficacy was confirmed in 11 of 14. The mean effective dosage and trough plasma concentration were 427 mg every 8 hours and 1.83 micrograms/ml, respectively. One patient withdrew because of nausea. Slowing of intraventricular conduction necessitated dosage reduction in two patients. Plasma half-life was 9.4 +/- 4.1 hours, with renal elimination accounting for 62% of oral clearance. However, 66% of the variability in oral drug clearance was the result of nonrenal elimination. Oral recainam at dosages of 300 to 600 mg every 8 hours is effective in some drug-resistant ventricular arrhythmias and is well tolerated.\r"

Moclobemide is a new, reversible, preferential monoamine oxidase A inhibitor with antidepressant properties. Its potentiation of the tyramine pressor effect during 200 mg t.i.d. chronic treatment was compared with tranylcypromine, 10 mg b.i.d., in a double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled study (n = 16). Tyramine was mixed with food and ingested in increasing daily doses, during a normal meal, until a systolic blood pressure increase of at least 30 mm Hg was achieved (tyramine 30). When compared with the usual fasting oral tyramine tests performed in the same subjects, the mean tyramine 30 dose with a meal was 2.8 times higher. The mean tyramine 30 dose with a meal decreased from 1450 mg (range, 800 to 2000 mg) during placebo to 306 mg (range, 150 to 500 mg) during moclobemide (factor, 5.0) and from 1200 mg (range, 1000 to 1600 mg) during placebo to 35 mg (range, 20 to 50 mg) during tranylcypromine (factor, 38.2). The duration of the systolic blood pressure increase was longer with tranylcypromine (126 minutes) than with moclobemide (69 minutes) (p less than 0.01).\r"

Whereas the relationship of IAA to various factors at presentation has been studied in some detail, little is known about their relationship to events during the 1st yr after diagnosis. Furthermore, the course and factors affecting insulin-antibody response to human insulin administration in children with newly diagnosed IDDM remain poorly defined. To study these questions, we measured serum glucose, pH, bicarbonate, C-peptide, and IAA at diagnosis in 84 children between 0.5 and 18 yr of age. Basal and peak C-peptide responses to Sustacal ingestion, glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c), and IAA were then measured in 33 of these patients at 10 days and 1, 3, 6, and 12 mo after diagnosis. At presentation, IAAs were absent (binding below the mean + 3SD of the binding of control serums) in 51 patients (61%) and present (binding above the mean + 3SD) in 33 patients (39%). Multiple regression analysis showed a significant nonlinear relationship between IAAs and both age (P less than .005) and blood glucose (P less than .05) at onset. There was a stepwise increase in median insulin-antibody binding throughout the 1st yr. This increase was most marked during the 1st mo of insulin therapy and showed a statistically significant difference between successive measurements only during this period.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In this study, the effects of long-term miglitol treatment on metabolic control, C-peptide secretion, hepatic glucose output, and peripheral insulin sensitivity (euglycemic clamp) were tested in 15 type II diabetic patients (8 receiving insulin, 7 receiving oral hypoglycemic agents). For 8 wk they received either miglitol (300 mg/day) or placebo with a double-blind crossover design that had a 4-wk washout period between treatments. Miglitol therapy induced a reduction of postprandial blood glucose levels (miglitol compared with placebo; areas under the curve; P less than .002), whereas fasting blood glucose levels were not influenced. Miglitol caused a slight reduction of glycosylated hemoglobin levels (mean +/- SE miglitol and placebo 9.50 +/- 0.3 and 10.0 +/- 0.4%, respectively; P less than .05), which was more pronounced in insulin-treated patients. Miglitol caused a reduction of postprandial C-peptide increase (P less than .03). Hepatic glucose output (both in the basal state and during euglycemic clamp conditions) and peripheral insulin sensitivity were not influenced by miglitol therapy. Specific side effects were observed in 11 patients; in 6 patients only to a moderate degree. Long-term miglitol treatment induces a persistent reduction of postprandial blood glucose increase. This effect is more pronounced in type II diabetic patients on insulin therapy, which can cause a moderate improvement of overall metabolic control.\r"

The net glucose-area response to the ingested glucose dose (with the 0-time value as a constant baseline) was best described by a second-order polynomial equation, whereas insulin-area response was best described by a third-order equation. In a separate study, 5 untreated type II diabetic subjects were given only water, and the same metabolites and hormones were measured. Data from this study indicated that the baseline was not constant during the 5 h of study but decreased progressively. The net glucose-area and insulin-area responses to ingested glucose dose (with the decreasing baseline) were then best described by third-order equations. Glucagon, alpha-amino acid nitrogen, and lactate concentrations were exquisitely sensitive to a rise in glucose and insulin concentrations. These were all decreased with the lowest concentration of glucose used. At this dose of glucose, the increase in insulin was only 15 microU/ml.\r"

Traditional treatments have mostly disappeared in occidental societies, but some are prescribed by practitioners of alternative medicine or taken by patients as supplements to conventional therapy. However, plant remedies are the mainstay of treatment in underdeveloped regions. A hypoglycemic action from some treatments has been confirmed in animal models and non-insulin-dependent diabetic patients, and various hypoglycemic compounds have been identified. A botanical substitute for insulin seems unlikely, but traditional treatments may provide valuable clues for the development of new oral hypoglycemic agents and simple dietary adjuncts.\r"

  ".W": "In North America, gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is diagnosed from a 100-g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) with criteria proposed by the National Diabetes Data Group (NDDG). These criteria were derived in the 1950s from an unrepresentative sample of women tested predominantly in the latter stages of pregnancy. The original studies did not check for reproducibility of OGTT results. Measurements were made with the Somogyi-Nelson whole-blood glucose technique, and test translation errors are present in the threshold values proposed for modern plasma glucose oxidase methods. Whereas GDM is now diagnosed with a view to adverse maternal-fetal outcomes, the criteria were chosen to reflect maternal risk of developing glucose intolerance as shown by a 75-g OGTT in the nonpregnant state over the ensuing 8 yr. For that outcome, the positive predictive value of the criteria was only 36.1%, and this is a marked overestimate, because the study cohort was a highly selected group with an increased incidence of glucose intolerance both during and after pregnancy. The criteria are also conceptually flawed in that they impose a dichotomous definition of normal and abnormal on gestational glucose tolerance, when the risk of adverse maternal-fetal outcomes and later diabetes mellitus should logically be graded upward with higher values on the gestational OGTT and with the degree of fasting hyperglycemia. Although NDDG criteria merit continued use for lack of a better alternative, new diagnostic criteria for GDM should be derived and validated.\r"

NIDDM patients without nephropathy and nondiabetic subjects were similar in albumin, beta 2M, and ACE excretion. NIDDM patients with incipient nephropathy had elevated albumin excretion (P less than .01) and similar beta 2M and ACE excretion compared with nondiabetic subjects. On the other hand, NIDDM patients with overt nephropathy had elevated albumin, beta 2M, and ACE excretion compared with nondiabetic subjects (P less than .01). In all NIDDM patients studied, a positive correlation was found between ACE excretion and albumin excretion (r = 0.76, P less than .001) or beta 2M excretion (r = 0.52, P less than .01). These data suggest that elevated ACE excretion in NIDDM patients with overt nephropathy may be reflective of renal tubular damage.\r"

These molecules pose special problems in design for potential medical applications because of the high degree of flexibility, lack of high receptor selectivity, and ready biodegradation or clearance. The global and local use of conformational constraints has overcome these difficulties. Structure-biological activity relationships, molecular modeling, conformational analysis, conformational calculations, and molecular dynamics simulations can all be used to derive suitable lead structures and conformational models. Often, a single, constrained peptide analogue can be designed, which will have many of the desired biological and biophysical properties, and will serve as a template. Peptide analogues with high potency, exquisite receptor selectivity, and biological stability can be obtained. The approach is illustrated by the design of cyclic enkephalin-agonist analogues with exceptional delta-opioid-receptor selectivity, and of constrained somatostatin analogues that have become opioid peptides and possess potent opioid antagonist activities and exceptional selectivity for mu-opioid receptors.\r"

Regrettably, the finding of no difference does not, on its own at least, support such a conclusion. A finding of no difference between treatments has numerous explanations that have nothing whatsoever to do with the pharmacological actions of the experimental drug. To be clear, it is possible to argue that a pharmacological effect is the most plausible explanation for a finding of no difference in an active control study, but this argument is only supportable if it is based on additional information gathered from sources external to the study. In most circumstances, the essential external evidence is not available, and the interpretation of the null difference as a positive result turns entirely upon the truth or falsity of the sanguine assumptions made. There is a risk in inferring efficacy from the seemingly consistent results of a series of active control studies that fail to find differences. Despite the long-recognized deficiencies in the active control study design, it remains popular.\r"

There was no significant difference between the cumulative pregnancy rates at 6 months (0.23 versus 0.31 for groups 1 and 2, respectively) or the monthly fecundability (0.04 versus 0.07 for groups 1 and 2, respectively). Using these monthly fecundabilities we have calculated that approximately 378 patients in each arm of the trial would be needed to demonstrate a significant difference between the two groups. We therefore conclude that timing donor inseminations using urinary LH dipsticks does not significantly improve the conception rates.\r"

This study suggests that second-look operative laparoscopy 1 year after terminal salpingostomy or salpingo-ovariolysis does not increase the pregnancy rate or decrease the incidence of ectopic pregnancy. Women who fail to conceive 1 year after a reproductive surgery still maintain some of their reproductive potential, but the risk of having an ectopic pregnancy is high.\r"

The delta endometrial growth was greater in the women who conceived than in the nonpregnant group (4.3 +/- 0.2 and 2.5 +/- 0.2 mm, respectively; P less than 0.0005).

We tested sera from infertile men and women containing antisperm antibodies (ASAs) for their reactivity with FA-1, an antigen known to be present on murine and human spermatozoa. Fifty percent of male sera and 63% of female sera contained anti-FA-1 antibodies, as judged by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Fourteen percent of male sera and 50% of female sera were also shown to possess ASAs reactive with living mouse spermatozoa, and murine in vitro fertilization was inhibited by human antibodies. These results suggest that the transfer of immunoglobulins from human sera to spermatozoa of other species may provide a model to study how ASAs effect sperm function.\r"

  ".W": "The effect of acute suppression of acid secretion induced by administration of a single dose of omeprazole (2 mg/kg body wt) on postprandial gastrin release was studied in 10 conscious dogs. In omeprazole-treated dogs, a sustained gastrin release was observed during a 10-h period after feeding, although greater than 95% of the meal had left the stomach after 4 h. This sustained gastrin release could be inhibited by acidification of the gastric lumen, by somatostatin, and by atropine. Insulin and bombesin induced considerable gastrin release in omeprazole-treated dogs, but plasma gastrin concentrations returned almost to basal values after 3 h. Omeprazole administered alone had no significant effect on basal gastrin levels. These data indicate that, in dogs, when acid secretion is suppressed by omeprazole a meal induces a sustained gastrin release lasting for up to 10 h. This gastrin release is probably related to the fact that food has been in contact with the gastric lumen, as neither vagal nor bombesin stimulation induced such a sustained activity of the G cells.\r"

  ".W": "Although nocturnal acid secretion has been emphasized in the pathophysiology and treatment of duodenal ulcer, its importance in gastric ulcer disease has been questioned. To explore this area, this multicenter U.S. trial compared the effect of a once-daily nighttime dose of H2-receptor antagonist with placebo on the healing of gastric ulcer and relief of associated symptoms. One hundred fifty-seven patients with endoscopically verified benign gastric ulcers were randomized in a double-blind fashion to either famotidine (40 mg at bedtime) or placebo. Antacid tablets were allowed as needed. The healing rates for famotidine were 45%, 66%, and 78% at weeks 4, 6, and 8, respectively. In comparison, placebo healing rates were 39%, 44%, and 64%. These differences were statistically significant in favor of famotidine at weeks 6 (p less than or equal to 0.01) and 8 (p less than or equal to 0.05), as well as in a life-table analysis (p less than or equal to 0.05). Nocturnal famotidine was also significantly better than placebo with respect to time to complete relief of pain and to the percentage of patients with complete relief of pain. No concomitant factor (including ulcer size, ulcer location, smoking history, or regular alcohol use) affected healing rates in this study. Famotidine was well-tolerated and no serious clinical or laboratory adverse effects were judged to be related to this dosing regimen of famotidine. In conclusion, suppression of nocturnal acid secretion with famotidine (40 mg at bedtime) was more effective than placebo in promoting the healing of acute benign gastric ulcer and its associated symptoms. The results of this study suggest that suppression of nocturnal acid secretion alone is as effective as \"around the clock\" acid suppression in the healing of benign gastric ulcer.\r"

  ".W": "To clarify the intracellular distribution of myosin in normal rat hepatocytes and its alterations in phal-loidin-treated rat hepatocytes as a morphologic basis for the dysfunction of microfilaments, we performed indirect immunofluorescence using monospecific antibody raised against rat hepatocyte myosin. Cryostat rat liver sections analyzed by the use of this antibody showed a characteristic polygonal staining pattern, indicating that myosin is localized close to the plasma membrane including the region of bile canaliculi. The observed myosin staining pattern of normal liver coincides with the pattern of actin distribution as demonstrated by double-staining on the same liver section with antimyosin antibody and rhodamine-phalloidin. Upon administration of phalloidin to rats, the following changes in the myosin staining pattern were observed. (a) Peripheral fluorescence along the plasma membrane, especially around the bile canaliculi and sinusoids, was greatly enhanced. (b) Numbers of small fluorescent dots appeared in the cytoplasm of hepatocytes. These changes in the localization of myosin are shown to overlap with those of actin filament distribution. Accompanying these changes of localization, cellular myosin content appears to be increased, as the myosin marker-enzyme NH4+(-)ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid-adenosine triphosphatase activity in hepatocyte extracts was elevated threefold after 7 days of phalloidin treatment. This increase of myosin may be due to the previously observed stabilizing effect on microfilaments of phalloidin against cellular proteases. Thus, phalloidin, which primarily alters actin filament distribution, induces the changes in myosin localization and the increase in cellular myosin content without causing dissociation of myosin from actin in the hepatocyte.\r"

In the present study, we have examined by immunoblotting the frequency of IgG and IgM autoantibodies to these four proteins in 129 patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (36 histological Stage I, 42 Stage II/III, 51 Stage IV) and 77 controls (49 non-primary biliary cirrhosis chronic liver disease, 16 primary Sjogren's syndrome, 12 healthy normal women). One hundred twenty-seven of 129 (98%) primary biliary cirrhosis patients had antibodies against at least one of the four M2 polypeptides, compared to 2/77 controls (both had autoimmune chronic active hepatitis and were antimitochondrial antibody positive by indirect immunofluorescence). One hundred twenty-one of 129 (94%) primary biliary cirrhosis sera reacted with the E2 component and protein X of pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, 69/129 (53%) primary biliary cirrhosis sera reacted with E2 of branched-chain 2-oxo acid dehydrogenase complex and 113/129 (88%) reacted with E2 of 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase complex. Primary biliary cirrhosis patients with histological Stage I disease had a lower incidence of autoantibodies to each M2 protein, compared to more advanced disease (IgG, p less than 0.05) but only 2/36 Stage I patients had no anti-M2 antibodies. There was no correlation between the presence of IgG or IgM antibodies to the M2 polypeptides and established prognostic markers in primary biliary cirrhosis (serum bilirubin and albumin levels).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Perivenular hepatocytes are the first cells within the liver lobule to display signs of toxicity following long-term alcohol use. In an attempt to explain this phenomenon, we have examined the hepatic intralobular distribution in rats and man of P450IIE1, a P-450 isozyme that not only oxidizes ethanol but is also inducible by this agent. Frozen liver sections and microsomes were prepared from male Sprague-Dawley rats pair-fed liquid diets containing 36% of total calories as either ethanol or carbohydrate (control) for 10 to 21 days. Frozen sections or microsomes were also prepared from liver biopsy samples obtained from 17 male patients with diverse drinking histories. Immunohistochemical staining was performed using the peroxidase-antiperoxidase method after liver sections were reacted with monospecific antibody (IgG) directed against human P450IIE1. Immunoreaction intensity was blindly rated in order to provide a semiquantitative assessment of P450IIE1 levels in perivenular, midzonal and periportal hepatocytes. At low applied anti-P450IIE1 IgG concentrations (2.5 micrograms per ml), P450IIE1 immunostaining was observed exclusively within the perivenular area in sections from all ethanol-treated rats, whereas no visible immunoreaction was found in sections from their pair-fed controls. At higher applied antibody concentrations (15 micrograms per ml), panlobular antigen immunostaining was observed in five of the six ethanol-treated animals, and P450IIE1 could now also be detected in perivenular hepatocytes from the control rats. In accordance with these immunohistochemical findings, protein blotting with anti-P450IIE1 IgG revealed a 7.5-fold increase in liver microsomal P450IIE1 content in ethanol-treated animals when compared to their pair-fed controls. With human liver, perivenular P450IIE1 immunostaining was observed only in biopsy sections obtained from recently drinking alcoholics (abstinence period of 1 day) when limiting concentrations (5 micrograms per ml) of the primary antibody were used. Increasing the applied anti-P450IIE1 IgG concentration to 15 micrograms per ml resulted in perivenular staining of the immunogen in liver sections from abstinent alcoholics (abstinence period of 4 to 8 days) and nondrinkers as well. Immunoblot analysis of human liver microsomes disclosed that the hepatic microsomal P450IIE1 content in recently drinking alcoholics was 4-fold higher than that found in nondrinkers. Our results show that, in both rats and in man, P450IIE1 is normally localized within the perivenular region, or zone 3, of the liver lobule, and that induction of P450IIE1 by prolonged alcohol consumption occurs primarily within the same acinar regi\r"

In this study, an in situ hybridization technique was applied for analysis of expression of the c-Ha-ras gene at the cellular level during liver regeneration induced by CCl4 administration. The in situ hybridization was compared with the observation for the p21c-Ha-ras protein, the corresponding protein of the c-Ha-ras gene, by immunohistochemistry. In normal rat liver, a few hepatocytes expressed the mRNAs and the corresponding proteins without any preferential localization. Zonal heterogeneity of c-Ha-ras gene expression first became evident at 12 hr after CCl4 administration, a higher number of gene products being detected in the pericentral zone than in the periportal zone. This heterogeneity became maximal at 24 hr after CCl4 administration. Zonal heterogeneity in the level of the p21c-Ha-ras protein paralleled that in the level of gene expression. Furthermore, both hepatocytes and nonparenchymal cells participated in expression of the c-Ha-ras gene during liver regeneration.\r"

  ".W": "Techniques are reviewed for the experimental feeding of alcohol, including a liquid diet procedure invented 25 years ago. This technique results in much higher ethanol intake than with other approaches. As a consequence, various complications observed in alcoholics can be reproduced in animal models. These include fatty liver, hyperlipemia, various metabolic and endocrine disorders, tolerance to ethanol and other drugs, physical dependence and withdrawal and, in the baboon, liver fibrosis and cirrhosis. Variations of the liquid diet formulation are compared, and adequacy of nutrition in terms of minerals, vitamins, lipotropes, carbohydrates and proteins is discussed. The importance of selecting proper controls is emphasized. The respective advantages of three standardized basic rat formulas are reviewed: (i) an all-purpose (35% fat) diet, comparable to the diet previously referred to as the \"Lieber-DeCarli formula\" and suitable for most experimental applications, particularly those intended to mimic the clinical situation in which the various effects of alcohol occur in the setting of hepatic changes characterized by a fatty liver; (ii) a low-fat diet comparable in all respects to the preceding diet but with a lower fat content, intended to minimize the hepatic changes, and (iii) a high-protein formula particularly useful in those circumstances in which an oversupply of dietary protein might be recommended (i.e. pregnancy). Variations of this technique, including continuous intragastric infusion, are also discussed. It is concluded that, for most experimental studies of chronic alcohol consumption, the liquid diet technique provides one of the most efficient tools to study the effects of ethanol under controlled nutritional conditions because it allows for alcohol consumption of clinical relevance and offers flexibility to adjust to special experimental or physiologic needs by allowing for various substitutions required for a particular experimental design, including changes in lipids, proteins or other dietary constituents. The technique also facilitates the comparison with controls by simplifying the pair feeding and is the best procedure available for the study of the toxic effects of alcohol and their interactions with deficiency or excess of various nutrients.\r"

  ".W": "Considering the difficulties following the administration of nitrites (or aminophenols) or cobalt-EDTA as well as the ineffectivenes of hydroxycobalamin and pyruvate, we feel that a more sensible treatment for acute cyanide intoxication is hemodialysis combined with the intravenous administration of sodium thiosulfate. The addition of hemodialysis to such a regimen is helpful in three ways. First, it removes the small extracellular reservoir of cyanide, particularly if the poison is still being absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. Second, it corrects the severe lactic acidosis seen in virtually all cases of cyanide toxicity. As with most poisons death from metabolic acidosis alone is likely. Third, the removal of thiocyanate, the end product of cyanide metabolism, results in a maneuver which should decrease both tissue and plasma cyanide levels. The immediate treatment of acute cyanide intoxication is supportive, as it is with most all drugs and poisons. Gastric lavage using activated charcoal should be initiated immediately to remove any remaining cyanide in the gastrointestinal tract. Simultaneously, high flow oxygen should be administered either by nasal cannula or by endotracheal intubation. Correction of the metabolic acidosis should be instituted with bicarbonate. Immediate hemodialysis should be performed with the concomitant administration of thiosulfate. Animal studies suggest that continuous infusion of thiosulfate (12 mg/kg/hr) is more effective for treating cyanide intoxication than is bolus administration (41, 51). Bolus administration is the currently recommended form of thiosulfate therapy in humans. The Lilly kit contains a 50 ml ampule of thiosulfate having 12.5 gm, which in adults may be repeated once at one-half the dose.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "In order to measure beta 2-microglobulin adsorption on dialysis membranes, uremic plasma was passed through different dialyzers in a simulated hemodialysis circuit in which both plasma and dialysate compartments were organized as closed loops, the ultrafiltration pressure being adjusted to minimize water shifts. Under these conditions, comparison of the amounts of beta 2-m in the plasma and dialysate compartments allowed us to calculate the binding of beta 2-m to the membrane at different times of the procedure. Whereas cuprophane membrane (Gambro gf 180m, 1.8m2) did not bind beta 2-m, AN69 (Filtral, 1.1 m2), high flux polysulfone (F60, 1.2m2) and modified polyamide (Polyflux 130, Gambro, 1.3m2) were found to adsorb 49 +/- 8 mg (mean +/- SEM), 17 +/- 5 mg and 38 +/- 4 mg of beta 2-m, respectively. These data were confirmed in trace labeling experiments with 125I-beta 2-m. Adsorption was a saturable phenomenon occurring during the first 90 min of in vitro dialysis. After reuse with peracetic acid, the adsorption capacity of AN69 membrane was lowered to 20 +/- 4 mg of beta 2-m, contrasting with the unchanged adsorption after reuse with sodium hypochlorite. These data indicate that adsorption significantly contributes to beta 2-m removal during hemodialysis with certain dialyzers and that reuse procedures may affect the propensity of dialysis membranes to bind beta 2-m.\r"

We compared quality of life for 24 patients who survived at least 6 months after heart transplantation with that for 20 patients clinically similar at baseline who survived at least 6 months with sustained medical therapy. Quality of life was assessed by using three questionnaires. Both groups were similar in psychosocial functioning, with patients receiving medical therapy reporting greater dysfunction in social activities, as compared with those who underwent heart transplantation.

One patient with a shotgun injury to the superficial femoral artery and vein had both arterial and venous embolizations. The site of vascular penetration was repaired in all six patients. All peripheral arterial bullet emboli were removed except for an asymptomatic shotgun pellet in the peroneal artery. One bullet was removed from a right atrium and another from a proximal pulmonary artery. Emboli in the distal pulmonary artery branches were left undisturbed in two patients.

The rationale for angioscopy was to assess the result of these usual \"blind\" techniques. In two patients residual thrombus was detected and removed under direct visual control. Our initial experience suggests that intraoperative angioscopy appears to be useful in the detection of residual thrombus material, especially in the asanguinous, arrested heart. The small size of the angioscope allows easily access to the secondary, and up to the tertiary pulmonary branches. Clots can be visualized and extracted under direct visual control.\r"

However, the EC of arteries and veins were negative for both IL-1 beta and IL-1 alpha. In the control group, none of the thyroid glands showed positive staining for IL-1 beta or IL-1 alpha. There was a significant correlation (P less than 0.025) between the presence of IL-1 beta on perifollicular EC and the presence of serum antimicrosomal antibodies.

  ".W": "The use of the plasma epinephrine (EPI) level as an index of adrenomedullary activity in humans is complicated by the rapid removal of EPI from plasma by many tissues. To determine whether the kinetics of distribution and metabolism of EPI could be best quantified using the isotope dilution method or a mathematical modeling technique, eight human subjects received a [3H]EPI infusion for 50-60 min. Analysis of the steady state arterialized plasma levels of EPI and [3H]EPI using the isotope dilution technique showed that the basal plasma EPI appearance rate is 0.87 +/- 0.11 nmol/m2.min, and the basal plasma EPI clearance rate is 1.63 +/- 0.14 L/min.m2. Mathematical modeling of the [3H]EPI levels revealed that a biexponential curve fit was superior to monoexponential and triexponential curve fits. A two-compartment model was the minimal compartment model that accurately described EPI kinetics. The basal plasma EPI appearance (0.82 +/- 0.16 nmol/m2.min) and EPI clearance (1.67 +/- 0.15 L/min.m2) rates that were estimated from this two-compartment model are similar to the results derived from the isotope dilution method. Mathematical modeling revealed a large extravascular mass of EPI. We conclude that the isotope dilution and mathematical modeling techniques similarly describe plasma EPI kinetics in humans. Kinetic analysis using mathematical modeling provides new insights into adrenomedullary function in humans.\r"

In men who initially had fused epiphyses (n = 15), cortical bone density increased from 0.71 +/- 0.02 to 0.74 +/- 0.01 g/cm2 (P less than 0.01), while trabecular bone density did not change (116 +/- 9 compared with 119 +/- 7 mg/cm3). In men who initially had open epiphyses (n = 6), cortical bone density increased from 0.62 +/- 0.01 to 0.70 +/- 0.03 g/cm2 (P less than 0.01), while trabecular bone density increased from 96 +/- 13 to 109 +/- 12 mg/cm3 (P less than 0.01). Cortical bone density increased 0.03 +/- 0.01 g/cm2 in men with fused epiphyses and 0.08 +/- 0.02 g/cm2 in men with open epiphyses (P less than 0.05). Despite these increases, neither cortical nor trabecular bone density returned to normal levels. Histomorphometric analyses of iliac crest bone biopsies demonstrated that most of the men had low turnover osteoporosis, although some men had normal to high turnover osteoporosis. We conclude that bone density increases during gonadal steroid replacement of GnRH-deficient men, particularly in men who are skeletally immature.\r"

Prehepatic secretory rates calculated using the combined model appeared biphasic in nature after glucose injection. Basal insulin secretion was 63.9 +/- 9.8 pmol/min. The duration of first phase was approximately 5 min, with secretion reaching a peak of 2033 +/- 342 pmol/min. The first phase was followed by a significant refractory period in which the secretory rate fell below basal values. The magnitude of second phase secretion was small relative to first phase secretion and appeared pulsatile in nature. Total integrated insulin secretion was 22.2 +/- 2.7 nmol, of which first phase accounted for 32%, and second phase accounted for the remaining 68%. Total incremental integrated secretion was 10.6 +/- 1.4 nmol, accounting for approximately half of the total insulin secretion. Proportions of first and second phase secretion changed to 66.5% and 33.5%, respectively, with incremental data. This study shows that the combined model of insulin and C-peptide is capable of estimating prehepatic insulin secretion from the iv glucose tolerance test and may provide a useful tool to measure secretion in vivo under various pathological conditions.\r"

Children with premature pubarche were similarly analyzed to establish whether this condition is accompanied by altered hormonal responses to CRH. CRH produced consistent increases in ACTH, B-EP, and cortisol blood levels, which were comparable at all age intervals in all groups. 17-OHP increased after CRH injection, but its response linearly with age. D4-A levels were not influenced, while DHEA and DS levels were only partially influenced by CRH. The stimulated D4-A to 17-OHP ratio increased with sexual maturation, whereas ratios of cortisol to 17-OHP and D4-A to DHEA remained constant. Children with premature pubarche had hormonal responses similar in magnitude to those of prepubertal children of comparable age. In conclusion, an increase in 17,20-desmolase efficiency occurs with postnatal maturation after CRH challenge. Moreover, CRH does not appear to play an important role in premature pubarche.\r"

Diagnosis was made on the basis of blood glucose measurements during symptoms in their daily life and confirmed by a 5-h oral glucose tolerance test. The patients were divided into the following groups: 8 patients with idiopathic reactive hypoglycemia (IRH), i.e. biochemical hypoglycemia associated with symptoms and plasma insulin concentrations in the normal range; 6 patients with nonhypoglycemia (NH), i.e. patients experiencing the symptoms evoking hypoglycemia at essentially normal plasma glucose levels; and 6 patients with alimentary hypoglycemia secondary to previous gastric surgery (GS). Eight normal volunteers formed the control group (N). Hypoglycemia in this study was considered to be present when plasma glucose concentrations were below 2.5 mmol/L. The peak cortisol levels after glycemic nadir were higher (2P less than 0.05) in IRH compared to GS and N. In the same group, a partially deficient glucagon response to hypoglycemia was noted. During the euglycemic clamp, the glucose uptake appeared to be significantly greater in the IRH group than in NH, GS, and N groups (8.13 +/- 0.49 vs. 7.02 +/- 0.35, 6.48 +/- 0.22, and 6.66 +/- 0.42 mg/kg.min, respectively; 2P less than 0.05). Therefore, our data suggest that increased insulin sensitivity represents a feature of idiopathic reactive hypoglycemia.\r"

The nodules occurred in the subcutis of the elbow or hip of women, 33 to 74 years old, and in the hip of a 16-year-old boy. Histologically the fully developed lesions were totally or nearly totally encapsulated by thin, fibrous tissue. All contained well-preserved outlines of nonnucleated adipocytes; there was no inflammation or saponification. In one patient's lestion the viable subcutaneous tissue merged into several partially encapsulated necrotic nodules. In another case a smaller nodule was found within a larger, mostly calcified nodule. Names such as nodular-cystic fat necrosis, mobile encapsulated lipoma, and encapsulated necrosis have been offered to designate the lesion. Its pathogenesis seems to be related to trauma, rapid vascular insufficiency, and subsequent fibrous capsule formation. Many previously reported patients, however, had no history of trauma. The lesion must be distinguished histologically from lipoma, angiolipoma, alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency-associated panniculitis, membranous fat necrosis, and pancreatic fat necrosis. Simple excision is the treatment of choice.\r"

  ".U": "89380935\r", 
  ".W": "This review relates concepts derived from the study of chemically induced skin cancer in animal models to the pathogenesis of malignant melanoma in humans. Most chemically induced experimental cancers in animals, including melanomas in rodents, arise within a benign precursor lesion. The initiation-promotion-progression sequence is a central concept in animal models for carcinogenesis. Many human melanomas appear to arise from epidermal melanocytes, with no associated precursor lesion. This article considers why there is no apparent precursor in many human melanomas and the consequences of this absence. Melanocyte physiology and factors that govern escape from defenses such as DNA repair, local tissue environment, and immunity presumably influence melanocyte conversion to melanoma. These factors may determine the absence of a precursor lesion in primary melanomas. In addition, it is possible that some human melanomas arise by cellular mechanisms different from those causing cancer in rodent models. Both molecular and prospective clinical studies will be required to explain this apparent paradox in the pathogenesis of melanoma. A similar approach may help to explain the origin of basal cell carcinoma and perhaps other human cancers that appear to arise directly from normal cells. From a clinical point of view, the absence of an identifiable, benign precursor lesion requires even greater emphasis on melanoma prevention. Research on mechanisms of ultraviolet carcinogenesis indicates that appropriate postexposure treatments may be useful in preventing long-term consequences of sunburn, including melanoma.\r"

A case of triple parietal scalp whorls and a case of a right temporal scalp whorl, both associated with normal development, are described. Current theories of hair whorl development, as well as normal and abnormal scalp whorl patterns, also are discussed.\r"

We suggest that a relative deficiency in dihomo-gamma-linolenic acid-derived prostaglandin E1 is the major etiologic factor for diminished T cell maturation postpartum. Its precursors, gamma-linolenic acid and dihomo-gamma-linolenic acid, are physiologically provided in colostrum and mature breast milk of healthy mothers. Depressed cell-mediated immunity and uncontrolled B-cell response with increased IgE synthesis are explained as prostaglandin E1-dependent defects of T cell differentiation caused by insufficient supply of prostaglandin E1 precursors during early infancy. Thus, in our opinion atopy is a metabolic disorder and the associated immunologic disturbances are epiphenomena.\r"

Moreover, the many clinical, histologic, and physiologic changes that characterize old skin are increasingly implicated in its vulnerability to environmental injury and certain diseases. Thus it behooves dermatologists to study the basic biologic process of aging in the skin and the separable process of photoaging, which itself is a major clinical problem. To date studies at the cellular level have demonstrated major functional losses, particularly in proliferative capacity between infancy and adulthood, with definite further loss between early and late adulthood and as a result of chronic sun exposure. Continued careful, quantitative assessment of aging and photoaging in human skin both in vivo and in vitro will be critical to a better understanding of these processes and particularly to their successful therapeutic modification.\r"

Fine wrinkling, coarse wrinkling, sallowness, looseness, and hyperpigmentation were significantly improved with tretinoin therapy. Furthermore, a self-appraisal questionnaire indicated that tretinoin-treated patients, but not vehicle-treated patients, were able to perceive improvement in their facial appearance. An objective method based on digital image processing of silicone rubber casts obtained from the crow's-feet area also indicated that the skin surface topography was smoother and less wrinkled in the tretinoin-treated group compared with the vehicle-control group.\r"

Tretinoin cream has an excellent safety record; a local cutaneous hypervitaminosis A reaction is the only common problem.\r"

Patients were randomized into two groups, and after a 1-month baseline, were administered Zaditen (ketotifen), 1.0 mg twice daily, or an identical placebo for a period of 6 months. After 10 weeks of receiving the study medication, bronchodilator use was reduced or stopped. In the Zaditen-treated group, 60% of the children taking theophylline were able to stop its use completely, compared to 34% of the patients taking placebo (p less than 0.05). Of the patients who were unable to stop taking theophylline, the Zaditen-and placebo-treated groups recorded average dosage reductions of 62% and 26%, respectively. These differences were statistically significant (p less than 0.05). Thus, a high percentage of patients in the placebo-treated group maintained asthma symptom control with theophylline, whereas most of the Zaditen-treated patients could stop using this medication. Although pulmonary function readings improved in both groups, those patients taking Zaditen demonstrated earlier improvement and greater changes from baseline. Significant differences (p less than 0.05) in favor of Zaditen were found for reduction of concomitant medications, patient's global evaluation, physician's clinical evaluations, incidence of emergency room visits for asthma, and upper respiratory tract infections. No unexpected side effects were observed. It is concluded that Zaditen is an effective medication for long-term control of asthma in children.\r"

The patient suffers from hay fever and bronchial asthma caused by a variety of pollens (grass, olive, and mugwort). This severe reaction was developed after his first ingestion of chamomile tea. Studies revealed the presence of immediate skin test reactivity and a positive passive transfer test to chamomile-tea extract. Moreover, both specific antichamomile-tea extract and anti-Matricaria chamomilla-pollen extract IgE antibodies were detected by an ELISA technique. Cross-reactivity among chamomile-tea extract and the pollens of Matricaria chamomilla, Ambrosia trifida (giant ragweed), and Artemisia vulgaris (mugwort), was demonstrated by an ELISA-inhibition study. These findings suggest a type I IgE-mediated immunologic mechanism as being responsible for the patient's anaphylactic symptoms and also suggest that the patient cross-reacted the pollens of Matricaria chamomilla contained in the chamomile tea because he was previously sensitized to Artemisia pollen.\r"

Thymic hormone thymulin plays a role in the differentiation of T-lymphocytes and plasmatic thymulin concentration and is related to the functional state of the thymus. To assess the participation of the thymus in the impairment of T-lymphocyte function, we measured plasma thymulin activity in children with allergic asthma (N = 40). The plasma thymulin activity was compared with plasma thymulin activity of children with nonallergic asthma (N = 6), children with atopic dermatitis (N = 9) or allergic rhinitis (N = 7), and in age-matched healthy control children (N = 18) (age range of children studied, 2 to 19 years). Thymulin activity was found within the normal range (1/16 to 1/64) in all control children and in all children with allergic asthma and allergic rhinitis, as well as in all children with intrinsic asthma and atopic dermatitis. Our findings are at variance with the low thymulin activity previously reported in allergic asthma, and we could not explain these discrepancies. (Both studies used the same bioassay, and the population studied did not appear to be different.) T-lymphocyte abnormalities in subjects with asthma must be assessed by other means than measurement of thymic function.\r"

  ".W": "Although both IL-2 and IL-4 can promote the growth of activated T cells, IL-4 appears to selectively promote the growth of those helper/inducer and cytolytic T cells which have been activated via their CD3/TCR complex. The present study examines the participation of CD28 and certain other T cell-surface molecules in inducing T cell responsiveness to IL-4. Purified small high density T cells were cultured in the absence of accessory cells with various soluble anti-human T cell mAb with or without soluble anti-CD3 mAb and their responsiveness to IL-4 was studied. None of the soluble anti-T cell mAb alone was able to induce T cell proliferation in response to IL-4. A combination of soluble anti-CD3 with anti-CD28 mAb but not with mAb directed at the CD2, CD5, CD7, CD11a/CD18, or class I MHC molecules induced T cell proliferation in response to IL-4. Anti-CD2 and anti-CD5 mAb enhanced and anti-CD18 mAb inhibited this anti-CD3 + anti-CD28 mAb-induced T cell response to IL-4. In addition, anti-CD2 in combination with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 mAb induced modest levels of T cell proliferation even in the absence of exogenous cytokines. IL-1, IL-6, and TNF were each unable to replace either anti-CD3 or anti-CD28 mAb in the induction of T cell responsiveness to IL-4, but both IL-1 and TNF enhanced this response. The anti-CD3 + anti-CD28 mAb-induced response to IL-4 was exhibited only by cells within the CD4+CD29+CD45R- memory T subpopulation, and not by CD8+ or CD4+CD45R+ naive T cells. When individually cross-linked with goat anti-mouse IgG antibody immobilized on plastic surface, only anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 mAb were able to induce T cell proliferation. These results indicate that the CD3 and CD28 molecules play a crucial role in inducing T cell responsiveness to IL-4 and that the CD2, CD5, and CD11a/CD18 molecules influence this process.\r"

  ".W": "The biochemical nature and relative topographic localization of Ag determinants recognized on CD45 molecular complex by mAb defining four distinct Ag specificities (conventional CD45, CD45R, 180 kDa and 220/205/190 kDa) have been investigated. These Ag specificities display a differential biochemical, cellular, and histochemical distributions and are important in the definition of CD4-positive complementary functional T cell subsets and/or distinct stages of thymic maturation. Protease treatment of either CD45-positive cells or purified CD45 molecules revealed that both conventional CD45 and 180-kDa (UCHL1 epitope) Ag specificities are defined by epitopes present on a protease-resistant domain which is internal to the protease-sensitive epitopes defining both CD45R and 220/205/190-kDa Ag specificities. In addition, it is shown that carbohydrate moieties are contributing to the epitopes recognized by both the anti-180-kDa UCHL1 and the anti-220/205/190-kDa mAb. Neuraminidase treatment, which cleaves sialic acids either from N- or O-linked oligosaccharides, abrogated the reactivity of both mAb. However, N-glycanase treatment, which selectively cleaves N-linked sugars, did not affect the recognition of these two epitopes. Thus, these results demonstrate that the Ag determinants recognized by the UCHL1 and the anti-220/205/190-kDa mAb, which are topographically unrelated, are associated with sialic acids from O-linked-type oligosaccharides, emphasizing the contribution of carbohydrates to the Ag heterogeneity of CD45 molecular complex.\r"

  ".W": "UM4D4 is a newly identified T cell surface molecule, distinct from the Ag receptor and CD2, which is expressed on 25% of peripheral blood T cells, resting or activated. Monoclonal anti-UM4D4 is mitogenic for T cells and T cell clones. Since alternative activation pathways independent of Ag/MHC recognition may be important in thymic differentiation, the expression and function of UM4D4 was examined in human thymus. UM4D4 was found on the surface of 6% of thymocytes. All thymocyte subsets contained UM4D4+ cells but expression was greatest on thymocytes that were CD1- (12%), CD3+ (11%) and especially CD4-CD8- (18%). CD3+CD4- CD8- cells, most of which bear the gamma delta-receptor, were greater than or equal to 50% + for UM4D4. Moreover, anti-UM4D4 was comitogenic for thymocytes together with PMA or IL-2. Anti-UM4D4 also reacted strongly with a subset of thymic epithelial cells in both cortex and medulla. Dual color fluorescence microscopy, with anti-UM4D4 and antibodies to other thymic epithelial Ag, showed UM4D4 expression on neuroendocrine thymic epithelium but not on thymic fibrous stroma. Thus, UM4D4 is expressed on, and represents an activation pathway for, a subset of thymic T cells. In addition, this determinant, initially identified as a novel T cell activating molecule, is broadly expressed by neuroendocrine thymic epithelium. Although the function of UM4D4 on the thymic epithelial cells is not yet clear, it is possible that UM4D4 represents a pathway for the functional activation of a subset of the thymic epithelium as well as a subset of thymocytes, thus playing a dual role in T cell differentiation.\r"

In parallel we evaluated the proliferative response of peripheral blood T cells to an anti-CD3 mAb in the presence of either IL-2 or PMA. The pHi increase (delta pHi) observed in control samples ranged from 0.14 to 0.23 pH units (X +/- SD = 0.17 +/- 0.03). In 10 allogeneic and four autologous BMT recipients the delta pHi was under the lower limit of the control range (range: 0.01 to 0.09, X +/- SD = 0.05 +/- 0.02), whereas the remaining nine cases responded similarly to control samples (range: 0.14 to 0.24, X +/- SD = 0.17 +/- 0.04). The response of the Na+/H+ antiporter to a PKC-independent osmotic stimulation appeared to be normal, thus indicating that the intrinsic Na+/H+ exchanger activity was unaltered. The anti-CD3 induced proliferative response of the group of samples displaying a suboptimal delta pHi, was significantly lower (p less than 0.01) than that detected in control samples. T cell proliferation in samples from BMT recipients displaying a normal delta pHi was undistinguishable from the control group (p greater than 0.05). Our results provide the first evidence for a defective early metabolic event, closely related to PKC activity, in T cells from BMT recipients displaying a low proliferative response to T cell mitogens.\r"

However, we have determined that Th1 clones can respond to IL-1, because they function synergistically with IL-2 to induce granulocyte-macrophage-CSF secretion. This response to IL-1 plus IL-2 could be induced by IL-1 alpha or IL-1 beta and by membrane-bound IL-1 on macrophages. However, IL-1R could not be detected, and Th1 cells did not respond to IL-4 in the presence or absence of IL-1, as measured by either proliferation or granulocyte-macrophage-CSF production. Therefore, IL-1 functioned as a cofactor in Th1 cells stimulated with IL-2, but not with IL-4. A possible mechanism whereby IL-1 activates Th1 cells is discussed.\r"

The current studies were undertaken to investigate the production of CSF by Listeria-specific, T cell clones and to assess the participation of CSF in anti-listerial host resistance. Listeria-specific L3T4+, Lyt-2- T cell clones were isolated and expanded by standard techniques. The clones themselves protected mice from listerial challenge when injected intravenously, and supernatants generated from Ag-stimulated clones were protective. In order to define factors important in the protection, supernatants from the clones were assayed for CSF by several in vitro assays. Total colony-stimulating activity was measured with a bone marrow colony-forming assay. T cell clones secreted 1000 to 2000 U/ml of colony-stimulating activity after 48 hours of stimulation with specific antigen. The relative amounts of the various CSF were determined by the capacity of supernatants to support proliferation of the factor-dependent cell lines FDCP-1 and 32D cl 3 in the presence and absence of specific anti-CSF antibodies. Results showed that most of the CSF activity was due to granulocyte-macrophage (GM)-CSF and IL-3. The role of GM-CSF in anti-listerial host resistance was assessed in two types of experiments. In one set of experiments GM-CSF activity was neutralized in the supernatants by addition of specific rabbit anti-GM-CSF antibodies. Treated and untreated supernatants were then tested for their capacity to protect nonimmune mice against listerial challenge. Neutralization of GM-CSF in the supernatants decreased the protective capacity of the supernatants by approximately 23%. In a second set of studies, the administration of recombinant murine GM-CSF was shown to protect mice from challenges of L. monocytogenes. Taken together, these experiments provide evidence that CSF are important mediators of immune T cell mediated host defenses.\r"

  ".W": "The S49 tumor sublines are variants isolated from a single parent BALB/c tumor which demonstrate locus-specific shut-off of their Kd, Dd, and/or Ld surface molecules. Four phenotypically different sublines were characterized: wild-type (Kd Dd Ld)+, a null phenotype (Kd Dd Ld)-, and two intermediates (Kd Dd)+ (Ld)- and (Kd)+ (Dd, Ld)-. Nonexpressed class I Ag were not induced with IFN-gamma even though the expressed antigens were found to be appropriately responsive. Southern blot analysis using probes specific for the 5', exonic or 3' portions of the Kd, Dd, and Ld genes indicated that these S49 sublines have no major chromosomal aberrancies. Northern blot analysis of RNA from each S49 subline using locus-specific oligonucleotide probes revealed message only for the expressed Ag. Thus, the locus-specific shut-off of class I expression in these tumors appears to be acting at the transcriptional level. RNase protection analysis confirmed this result and furthermore demonstrated that the repression is exquisitely specific for the Kd, Dd, and Ld genes as other \"class I-like\" messages were detected in each cell line. These findings are discussed in the context of the various cis- and trans-acting mechanisms that have been proposed to regulate class I expression.\r"

To determine the mechanisms controlling the expression of GM-CSF in human fibroblasts, we used a transient transfection assay to look at the effect of TNF-alpha, IL-1 and phorbol diester on GM-CSF promoter sequences. Our results demonstrate that the phorbol diester, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate, can stimulate GM-CSF transcription via sequences located within 53 bp upstream of the GM-CSF cap site. TNF-alpha and IL-1 had no effect on GM-CSF transcription, suggesting that these cytokines act predominantly post-transcriptionally to stimulate production of GM-CSF. Our results demonstrate that multiple mechanisms can be used by human fibroblasts to produce GM-CSF in response to various inflammatory stimuli.\r"

Although C4 is a constitutive gene, Slp is an androgen-dependent gene and shows negligible basal level expression. We have previously shown that this difference in basal expression is determined by a region of about 400 bp immediately 5' of the transcriptional start site of the C4 and Slp genes. In this report, we demonstrate a specific binding site for a HepG2 nuclear extract in this region of the C4 gene by gel retardation and DNase I footprinting experiments. Nucleotide sequence of this binding site is very similar to the recognition sequence of well characterized transcription factors, NF.kappa B and H2TF1. Synthetic oligonucleotides representing the binding sites of the H-2Kb class I and IL-6 genes for these factors compete with the C4 promoter for the complex formation with a HepG2 nuclear factor. Due to the nucleotide deletion and substitution, the corresponding region of the Slp gene lacks this sequence motif as well as binding activity to the HepG2 nuclear factor.\r"

In contrast, lesional skin from all eight patients with pressure urticaria was negative, as was the clinically normal skin of all patients, with the exception of one patient with urticaria pigmentosa.

Two double-blind placebo controlled studies comparing 4% 17-PT in 80% alcohol versus vehicle alone were conducted. One study examined 17-PT sebosuppressive activity in 20 subjects. The second study examined its efficacy in 44 subjects having mild to moderate acne. A third study measured in vitro percutaneous absorption of 17-PT through hamster flank and monkey skin, and human face skin in-vivo, using radioactive drug. 17-PT was found to be ineffective in reducing either the sebum excretion rate or the number of inflammatory acne lesions. Failure of 17-PT to show clinical activity was not a result of poor percutaneous absorption. Total absorption in man was 7.7% of the dose and only 1.0% in the hamster. The sebaceous gland of hamster flank organ is apparently more sensitive to antiandrogens than the human sebaceous gland.\r"

Ten minutes after each histamine application, the areas of wheal and flare reactions were planimetrically evaluated. When no or weak current was applied, AD patients revealed stronger wheal and flare reactions than controls, possibly due to disturbed skin barrier function. Higher histamine doses, however, produced weaker subjective and vascular reactions in AD patients. In contrast to the controls, AD patients were unable to distinguish between weak and strong histamine stimulation, as shown by their VAS ratings. These results imply that AD patients have an altered histamine response. In particular, their afferent cutaneous nerve fibers show a decreased ability to signal itching to the central nervous system and to release vasoactive neuropeptides upon histamine stimulation.\r"

In human skin, unstimulated keratinocytes produce a large amount of such cytokines.

In this study, we investigated in situ localization of IL-1 alpha and IL-1 beta in normal and psoriatic skin. Using polyclonal antibodies and the avidin-biotin peroxidase complex, we demonstrated the presence of both IL-1 alpha and IL-1 beta in normal and psoriatic formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues. In both cases, IL-1 alpha was more prominent. However, the distribution of IL-1 alpha differed between normal and psoriatic skin. In normal skin, IL-1 alpha distribution was predominantly intercellular, whereas IL-1 alpha distribution was predominantly within the cytoplasm in psoriatic skin. These studies confirm that IL-1 alpha is the predominant form of IL-1 in the skin and provide further support for the hypothesis that IL-1 participates in the pathogenesis of psoriasis.\r"

  ".W": "Small-cell lung cancer (SCLC), a chemotherapy-responsive disease, is characterized by neuroendocrine properties. In contrast, non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is at best moderately responsive to chemotherapy, and only 10% to 20% of cases demonstrate neuroendocrine properties. The present study is a retrospective analysis of the use of immunoperoxidase markers for neuron-specific enolase (NSE), Leu-7, and chromogranin A in NSCLC patients treated with chemotherapy. It was designed to determine if the presence of neuroendocrine markers predict for response to chemotherapy. The diagnostic slides and blocks were obtained on 52 NSCLC patients who were treated with chemotherapy (26 responders and 26 nonresponders). Immunoperoxidase studies were performed, and slides were scored without knowledge of the patient's response. Markers were positive in responders and nonresponders, respectively, as follows: NSE, 14 of 26 (54%) versus seven of 26 (27%), P = .04; Leu-7, 11 of 25 (44%) versus five of 26 (19%), P = .08; and chromogranin A, three of 26 (12%) versus 0 of 26 (0%), P = .71. Two markers were positive in 10 of 26 responders (38%) and 0 of 26 nonresponders (0%), P less than .01. Responders with two or more positive markers showed superior survival (median, 79 weeks) compared with responders with fewer than two positive markers (median, 51 weeks) and nonresponders (median, 27 weeks). These data suggest that the presence of neuroendocrine markers in NSCLC is associated with an increased likelihood of response to chemotherapy and may add to the standard parameters (performance status, weight loss) used to select patients for chemotherapy.\r"

  ".W": "The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of several new approaches designed to enhance the activity of fluorouracil (5-FU) in the management of advanced colorectal cancer. A total of 429 patients were randomized to one of the following regimens: single-agent 5-FU, given by standard 5-day, intensive-course intravenous bolus technique; 5-FU plus high-dose folinic acid (leucovorin) or 5-FU plus low-dose leucovorin; 5-FU plus high-dose methotrexate (MTX) with oral leucovorin rescue; 5-FU plus low-dose MTX; and 5-FU plus cisplatin (CDDP). The median survival for patients receiving 5-FU alone was 7.7 months. The high- and low-dose leucovorin plus 5-FU regimens had median survivals of 12.2 and 12.0 months, respectively, and offered a significant survival advantage over 5-FU alone with one-sided P values of .037 and .050, respectively (P = .051 for each treatment after correction for prognostic variables). The only other regimen possibly associated with improved survival was high-dose MTX plus 5-FU, with a median survival of 10.5 months (P = .21, P = .076 corrected). In addition, both high- and low-dose leucovorin plus 5-FU regimens were associated with significantly improved tumor response rates (P = .04 and .001) and significantly improved interval-to-tumor-progression rates (P = .015 and .007) when compared with 5-FU alone. Only the low-dose leucovorin plus 5-FU regimen was associated with significant (P less than .05) superiority in each of the following parameters of quality of life: performance status, weight gain, and symptomatic relief. The overall most therapeutically favorable regimen in this trial was 5-FU given with low-dose leucovorin; fortuitously, this regimen is associated with very low drug cost. Whereas this is the first study to demonstrate both improved palliation and survival for any regimen compared with 5-FU given by rapid intravenous (IV) injection for 5 consecutive days at a dose of 500 mg/m2/d in patients with advanced colorectal cancer, the magnitude of the gain is still relatively small. Our low-dose leucovorin plus 5-FU regimen is currently being studied in a national trial with the hope that this increased advanced disease activity may produce more substantive gains in the surgical adjuvant setting.\r"

  ".W": "A total of 343 patients with previously untreated metastatic measurable colorectal carcinoma were studied to evaluate the impact on toxicity, response, and survival of leucovorin-modulated fluorouracil (5-FU). A maximally tolerated intravenous bolus loading course regimen of 5-FU alone (500 mg/m2 x 5 days every 4 weeks with 25 mg/m2 escalation) was compared with a high-dose leucovorin regimen (600 mg/m2 of 5-FU with 500 mg/m2 of leucovorin weekly for 6 weeks with a 2-week rest) and with a similar low-dose leucovorin regimen (600 mg/m2 of 5-FU with 25 mg/m2 of leucovorin weekly for 6 weeks with a 2-week rest). The dose-limiting toxicity for the two 5-FU and leucovorin regimens was gastrointestinal, specifically diarrhea; severe diarrhea was seen frequently, and treatment-related toxicity was implicated in the demise of 11 of the patients (5%). Significant improvements in response rates were observed with a response rate of 33 of 109 (30.3%) on the high-dose leucovorin regimen (P less than .01 v control); 13 of 107 (12.1%) on the 5-FU control; and 21 of 112 (18.8%) on the low-dose leucovorin regimen. A trend toward longer survival in the 5-FU plus high-dose leucovorin regimen was observed. In this study, leucovorin was shown to significantly enhance the therapeutic effect of 5-FU in metastatic colorectal carcinoma.\r"

  ".W": "A total of 394 patients with advanced, measurable squamous carcinoma of the uterine cervix and no prior chemotherapy were randomized to therapy with either carboplatin or iproplatin. There were 23 patients ineligible for the study and 10 patients who were not evaluable; the remaining 361 patients were evaluable for response and adverse effects. Randomization was well balanced for age, performance status, and prior therapy. Both platinum analogs were given every 28 days with starting doses of 400 mg/m2 for carboplatin (340 mg/m2 if the patient underwent prior radiation) and 270 mg/m2 for iproplatin (230 mg/m2 if the patient underwent prior radiation). These doses are equivalent to cisplatin doses of 75 to 100 mg/m2. Hematologic toxicity was dose-limiting, among which thrombocytopenia was slightly more common than leukopenia. Gastrointestinal toxicity was also prominent with both agents; however, iproplatin was significantly more toxic than carboplatin (P less than .001). Renal, otic, and peripheral nervous system toxicities were absent or infrequent with both analogs. No electrolyte abnormalities were observed. The percentage of planned dosages that were actually administered was 100% of carboplatin doses and 85% of iproplatin doses (P less than .0001). The reduction in iproplatin dose was apparently due to gastrointestinal toxicity. Response rates were similar for both agents (15% for carboplatin, 11% for iproplatin) and appear to be inferior to those noted with the parent compound, cisplatin.\r"

Overall, 79% of patients had primary residual tumor larger than 2 cm. The overall pathologic response rate (pathologic complete response [PCR] plus partial response [PPR]) in 37 evaluable patients was 62%, and in PCRs was 22%. Of the responding patients, 78% had primary residual tumor larger than 2 cm. The toxicity was cumulative but manageable, with thrombocytopenia being the main reason for dose reduction. Dose-limiting nephrotoxicity and neurotoxicity occurred in 22% and 7% of the patients, respectively. Combined high-dose platinum as a \"single agent\" appears to be as active as combination chemotherapy containing cisplatin, and the treatment is feasible. Further clinical trials of this combination alone or combined with other drugs are warranted.\r"

This article presents the results of a randomized trial of adjuvant tamoxifen (40 mg daily for 2 years) versus no adjuvant endocrine therapy in postmenopausal patients. During 1976 to 1984, 1,407 patients were included in the study. Of these, 427 (30%) had high-risk tumors (pN + or pT greater than 30 mm) and were included in a concurrent randomized comparison of postoperative radiotherapy versus adjuvant polychemotherapy. The mean follow-up time was 61/2 years. Tamoxifen improved the recurrence-free survival (RFS) (P less than .01), but the overall survival difference in favor of the tamoxifen-allocated patients was not significant. Data on estrogen (ER) and progesterone receptor (PgR) content were available in 750 patients. Their mean follow-up time was 41/2 years. The effect of tamoxifen was significantly related to ER level (P less than .01). No benefit with tamoxifen was observed among ER-negative patients. The relation to PgR level was of borderline significance (P = .06). Multivariate analysis indicated that most of the interaction between treatment and receptor content was explained by the interaction with ER (P less than .01). The PgR status appeared to modify the effect of tamoxifen among the ER-positive patients and the greatest effect was observed among patients who were positive for both receptors. However, the additional predictive information provided by the PgR assay did not help to identify an unresponsive subgroup of patients.\r"

  ".W": "From January 1981 to February 1986, a total of 240 patients with primary, malignancy-grade III or IV soft tissue sarcoma were entered into an adjuvant chemotherapy multicenter trial conducted by the Scandinavian Sarcoma Group (SSG). Of these patients, 181 were evaluable. The tumor was located in the extremities in 155 patients. After radical surgery (wide and compartmental) the patients were randomized to treatment with single-agent doxorubicin 60 mg/m2 administered as an intravenous (IV) bolus once a month for 9 months (group 1, n = 77) or to control (group 2, n = 77). If the surgical procedure was marginal, the patients initially received postoperative radiotherapy, followed by doxorubicin (group 3, n = 16) or control (group 4, n = 11). The control groups did not receive any adjuvant chemotherapy. Adjuvant therapy was initiated within 6 weeks of surgery (group 1) or within 10 weeks of surgery for patients receiving postoperative radiotherapy (group 3). With a median follow-up of 40 months, there was no significant difference between the four treatment groups in overall survival (group 1, 75%; group 2, 70%; group 3, 69%; group 4, 73%), disease-free survival (group 1, 62%; group 2, 56%; group 3, 62%; group 4, 64%), or local tumor control (group 1, 92%; group 2, 92%; group 3, 87%; group 4, 90%). The conclusions were the same whether the total group or evaluable patients only were included in the analysis. The local recurrence rate for patients undergoing radical surgery was 8% and for patients undergoing marginal surgery followed by radiotherapy was 12%. This study indicates that the use of single-agent doxorubicin as postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy has no significant clinical benefit in patients with high-grade soft tissue sarcoma.\r"

The serum level of beta 2M correlated with tumor burden. These two serum markers defined three significantly different prognostic groups. All 27 patients in the low-risk group remain alive and in remission; in contrast, 22 of the 27 patients (81%) in the high-risk group have failed treatment, and only seven (26%) remain alive. In comparison with the Ann Arbor staging system, serum levels of beta 2M and LDH may provide a more precise system for defining risk groups and thereby allow a more rational approach to the development and analysis of treatment strategies.\r"

Diets containing corn and either dried skim milk (DSM), soybean meal (SBM) or corn gluten meal (CGM) were fed for 7 d, and the contents of the stomach and six segments of the small intestine were collected. Nitrogen digestibility increased linearly from the proximal duodenum to the distal ileum, and was highest for DSM, intermediate for SBM and lowest for CGM diets at the distal ileum. The content of free amino acids in digesta increased 8-fold (SBM and CGM) to 12-fold (DSM) between the stomach and the proximal duodenum and reached a maximum concentration in the distal jejunum. Digestion of DSM was more proximal than was that of SBM. Although there was some accumulation of small peptides in the duodenum with a subsequent decrease in the jejunum, the molecular weight profiles of the soluble proteins were relatively constant throughout the small intestine. Protein solubility and the rate of proteolysis in the stomach and upper small intestine were the primary factors that limited the digestion of SBM and CGM.\r"

Under control conditions, the amplitude of the gastric relaxation in response to feeding was 2.46 +/- 0.23 g. Given i.v. 10 min before feeding, both U 50488 (10 micrograms/kg) and ethylketocyclazocine (10 micrograms/kg) significantly (P less than .01) reduced the amplitude of the gastric relaxation by 57 and 68%, respectively, whereas DAMGO and morphine (10 micrograms/kg i.v.) increased markedly the response to feeding by 67 and 51%, respectively. In contrast, DPDPE had no effect on the gastric relaxation induced by feeding. Previous administration of naloxone (0.3 mg/kg i.v.) or MR 2266 (0.3 mg/kg i.v.) blocked the effect of U 50488 on gastric relaxation with no effect per se on the amplitude of response; naloxone also blocked the increase in gastric relaxation induced by DAMGO. When administered i.c.v. (0.1 microgram/kg) DAMGO induced a significant (P less than .05) increase in the amplitude of gastric relaxation whereas U 50488 and DPDPE (0.1 and 1 microgram/kg i.c.v.) had no effect. The effect of i.c.v. DAMGO on gastric relaxation was unaffected by a previous i.v. administration of SR 58002C (1 mg/kg). Truncal vagotomy blocked the increase in gastric relaxation induced by DAMGO (10 micrograms/kg i.v.), but did not change the effect of U 50488 (10 micrograms/kg i.v.) on gastric relaxation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Phencyclidine (PCP) inhibits dopamine (DA) uptake and acts as a noncompetitive N-methyl-D-aspartate antagonist by binding to PCP receptors. The PCP analog N-[1-(2-benzo(b)thiophenyl) cyclohexyl]piperidine (BTCP, GK13) is a potent DA uptake inhibitor, but has low affinity for PCP receptors. The behavioral effects of BTCP were compared with those of PCP, ketamine, MK-801 and cocaine. In mice, BTCP, like cocaine, produced locomotion, sniffing and gnawing; haloperidol blocked these effects. PCP, ketamine and MK-801 produced locomotion, sniffing, swaying and falling. PCP, ketamine and MK-801 produced generalization in rats discriminating either cocaine, PCP or MK-801 from saline. Like cocaine, BTCP produced generalization in cocaine-discriminating rats only; haloperidol partially antagonized this effect. In pigeons, PCP-like catalepsy was produced by ketamine and MK-801, but not by BTCP. N-methyl-D-aspartate-induced convulsions in mice were antagonized by PCP, ketamine and MK-801, but not by BTCP or cocaine. Thus, BTCP shared only cocaine-like behavioral effects with PCP, ketamine and MK-801. A DA antagonist reduced the effects of BTCP. Therefore, the cocaine-like behavioral effects of BTCP may be mediated primarily by DA uptake mechanisms. However, PCP receptors, but not DA uptake mechanisms, may mediate the cocaine-like behavioral effects of PCP, ketamine and MK-801, because their order of potency in producing these effects (MK-801 greater than PCP greater than ketamine) is consistent with their potency order at PCP receptors, but not at DA uptake sites.\r"

  ".W": "The inhibitory effect of cardiac sympathetic nerve stimulation (SNS) on bradycardic response to vagal nerve stimulation was examined in anesthetized dogs pretreated with atenolol or propranolol to prevent tachycardia caused by SNS or norepinephrine infusion. The amplitudes of vagal bradycardia (0.5, 1, 2, and 4 Hz) during 10 and 30 Hz of SNS were significantly smaller than those during the resting state. The inhibitory effect of 10 Hz of SNS was neither affected by prazosin (10, 30 and 100 micrograms/kg i.v.) nor by yohimbine (10, 30 and 100 micrograms/kg i.v.). The SNS-induced inhibition of vagal bradycardia was inhibited by naloxone (0.3 and 1 mg/kg i.v.) or by naltrexone (0.3 and 1 mg/kg i.v.). Vagal bradycardia was unaffected by intracoronary infusion of norepinephrine (3 micrograms/min) into the right coronary artery, whereas it was effectively inhibited by leu-enkephalin (10, 30 and 100 micrograms/kg i.v.). Bradycardia induced by intracoronary injection of methacholine (0.3, 1 and 3 micrograms) was unaffected by SNS. These results suggest that a presynaptic alpha adrenoceptor mechanism is not involved in the SNS-induced inhibition of vagal bradycardia in the dog, and suggest further that an opioid receptor mechanism may be responsible for the inhibition.\r"

  ".W": "Endothelin is a newly described potent vasoconstrictor produced by endothelial cells. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effects of i.v. injection of human endothelin on regional blood flows (RBFs) and hemodynamic parameters in nonhuman primates. For this purpose, in a first series of experiments, anesthetized squirrel monkeys were instrumented with Doppler flow-probes in order to measure RBF continuously in the renal, mesenteric and iliac vascular beds. Endothelin at 0.03 and 0.1 microgram/kg produced no effect. After 0.3 and 1 microgram/kg, renal and mesenteric blood flow decreased, but iliac blood flow increased transiently. With 3 micrograms/kg all the three vascular beds were constricted. In the kidney, blood flow was almost abolished and the effect of endothelin sustained for up to 2 hr and more. In a second series of experiments, radioactive microspheres were used to measure RBFs in most organs 3 to 4 min after endothelin (0.3, 1 and 3 microgram/kg), or after vehicle alone. Endothelin induced a dose-dependent increase in systemic vascular resistance and increase in mean arterial blood pressure. The vasoconstrictor effect was selective for some vascular beds. The splanchnic vascular bed (except stomach) was most affected, with a 96% decrease in renal and splenic blood flow after 3 micrograms/kg of endothelin. The coronary blood flow decreased by 46% after 3 micrograms/kg, with a greater effect in subepicardium than subendocardium. In contrast, the blood flow to the brain and stomach was not decreased by endothelin. We conclude that endothelin is a potent vasoconstrictor in squirrel monkeys selective for some vascular beds.\r"

Forty percent of the receptors were solubilized from a liver homogenate with 0.25% digitonin. Scatchard analysis of saturation data for the mPBZR and the dsPBZR showed Kd = 1.5 nM and maximum number of binding sites = 3.12 pmol/mg of protein and Kd = 9.2 nM and maximum number of binding sites = 1.10 pmol/mg of protein, respectively. Estimates of Kd calculated from kinetic data agree with estimates from Scatchard analysis. The affinity of the PBZR for [3H]Ro5-4864 was not affected by guanosine 5'0-(3-thiotriphosphate) which suggests the receptor is not coupled to a G-protein. Competition for specific [3H]Ro5-4864 binding by various ligands demonstrated the same rank order potency of binding inhibition for the membrane bound and solubilized receptors (PK-11195 greater than or equal to Ro5-4864 greater than diazepam greater than clonazepam). Thus, the soluble receptor had ligand binding characteristics similar to those of the membrane PBZR. [3H]PK-14105 was used to photoaffinity label the PBZR in a rat liver homogenate. Labeling was specific for the PBZR and the molecular weight of the digitonin-solubilized photoaffinity-labeled receptor was estimated to be 170 kDa by gel filtration chromatography. Estimation of the molecular weight of the [3H]PK-14105 labeled receptor by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis demonstrated a single protein corresponding to 19 kDa.\r"

  ".W": "In rats with unilateral 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) lesions of the substantia nigra, the 2-deoxyglucose (2-DG) autoradiographic method of measuring regional cerebral glucose utilization (RCGU) was used to assess the effects of three systemically administered dopamine agonists: bromocriptine, pergolide and (+)-4-propyl-9-hydroxynaphoxazine (PHNO). Pergolide increased RCGU in the substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr) ipsilateral to the lesion in a dose-dependent manner (0.04 mg/kg, up 52%; 0.4 mg/kg, up 111%), resulting in asymmetric glucose utilization on the dopamine-denervated and intact sides of the brain. Pretreatment with a selective D1 antagonist (SCH 23390, 0.5 mg/kg) blocked completely the RCGU increase elicited by pergolide (0.4 mg/kg) whereas pretreatment with a selective D2 antagonist (eticlopride, 1.0 mg/kg) only mildly attenuated this increase. The effect of drug treatments on RCGU in the entopeduncular nucleus (EP) paralleled that in the SNr. These results demonstrate that the RCGU increase in the EP and SNr after pergolide administration is dependent primarily on D1 receptor stimulation. Administration of bromocriptine and PHNO minimally altered RCGU in the ipsilateral EP and SNr and did not result in significant left/right RCGU asymmetry. Considered in the context of prior studies of selective D1 and D2 agonists, the results suggest that, in this model, the magnitude of the RCGU increase in the EP and SNr elicited by a dopamine agonist, above the modest effects produced by selective D2 stimulation, represents a measure of D1 agonist effect in vivo. The results support a nonselective D1/D2 stimulatory effect of pergolide (0.04-0.4 mg/kg) and a selective D2 action of both bromocriptine and PHNO.\r"

An amiloride analog, 5-N-N-ethyl[2-methoxy 5-nitrobenzyl]amiloride (L651,548), led to a dose-dependent inhibition of the BK-induced Ca++ transient (Ki = 9 microM), and this effect was eliminated in high external Na+. Zero external Na+ failed to inhibit the BK-induced Ca++ release, suggesting L651,548 is not acting through inhibition of the Na+/H+ antiport. Use of monovalent ionophores to adjust the intracellular pH demonstrated changes in peak Ca++ release by BK only over wide pH ranges. Furthermore, studies revealed L651,548 was much more potent at inhibiting pH recovery (Ki = 55 nM) than BK-induced Ca++ release. Studies in saponin-permeabilized cells demonstrated no effect of L651,548 on inositol trisphosphate-induced Ca++ release. Whole cell [3H] BK binding studies indicated a dose-dependent inhibition by L651,548. We conclude that the Na+/H+ antiport does not play a critical role in control of BK-induced Ca++ release in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells. Also, the amiloride analog L651,548 reduces BK Ca++ release by inhibition of BK receptor binding in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells.\r"

  ".W": "Methyl palmoxirate, an effective hypoglycemic agent administered p.o., has been shown to decrease hepatic glucose production secondary to inhibition of mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation. Because the ability to increase hepatic glucose production is an important counter-regulatory defense against hypoglycemia, we compared the ability of streptozotocin/alloxan-induced diabetic dogs treated p.o. with vehicle or methyl palmoxirate (2.5 mg/kg/day X 7 days) to recover from insulin-induced hypoglycemia. Hepatic glucose production and glucose utilization were determined by isotope dilution before and after acute reduction of plasma glucose by i.v. insulin injection (0.10 or 0.13 U/kg). Diabetic dogs treated with methyl palmoxirate for 6 days had lower overnight fasting plasma glucose levels than vehicle-treated animals (158 +/- 7 vs. 171 +/- 11, respectively, P less than .05). Plasma glucose at 4 hr after the last dose of drug decreased to 115 +/- 5 mg/dl, whereas glucose in the vehicle-treated dogs was unchanged (172 +/- 8 mg/dl). Recovery from insulin-induced hypoglycemia (nadirs of 58 +/- 5 and 42 +/- 4 mg/dl in the vehicle- and methyl palmoxirate-treated groups, respectively) was not significantly different between the two groups of dogs. Restoration of plasma glucose was primarily due to increased hepatic glucose production in both treatment groups, as glucose utilization did not fall significantly below baseline levels. Plasma glucagon levels increased in both vehicle- and methyl palmoxirate-treated dogs in response to hypoglycemia, indicating that release of an important counter-regulatory hormone was not compromised by drug treatment.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".U": "89382290\r", 
  ".W": "N-0437 [2-(N-propyl-N-2-thienylethylamino)-5-hydroxytetralin], a potent and selective agonist for D-2 dopamine receptors, was used to investigate inhibitory prejunctional dopamine receptors in the rat tail artery and rabbit ear artery. N-0437 inhibited contractile responses to transmural nerve stimulation in a frequency dependent manner. Thus, N-0437 profoundly inhibited responses to nerve stimulation in the rat tail artery at a frequency of 1 Hz (ED50 = 1.6 nM), but had minimal effects when nerves were stimulated at 6 Hz. The D-1/D-2 dopamine agonist, apomorphine, exhibited a similar frequency dependent inhibitory effect but with less potency (ED50 = 30 nM at 1 Hz). In concentrations up to 1 microM, N-0437 had no effect on responses to exogenously applied norepinephrine, but N-0437 inhibited [3H] norepinephrine efflux induced by transmural stimulation. Inhibitory effects of N-0437 were blocked by the D-2 antagonist sulpiride but not by the D-1 antagonist SCH 23390. Furthermore, the selective D-1 agonist SKF 38393 did not inhibit vascular responses to adrenergic nerve stimulation. These data indicate that the inhibitory effects of N-0437 are via activation of D-2 dopamine receptors that inhibit norepinephrine release. Thus, N-0437 shows potency and selectivity of action for prejunctional D-2 dopamine receptors in vascular tissues. The frequency dependence of the actions of N-0437 suggest that the level of sympathetic activity is an important variable in determining effectiveness of prejunctional modulation.\r"

  ".U": "89382304\r", 
  ".W": "The nucleus of the tractus solitarius (NTS) is the central termination site of peripheral baroreceptor afferents. It has been suggested that the excitatory amino acid (EAA) L-glutamate may be a neurotransmitter which mediates transmission of baroreceptor information in the rat NTS. The present studies examined this hypothesis by pharmacological blockade of EAA receptors in the NTS. Bilateral microinjections into the NTS of the EAA receptor antagonist kynurenic acid (KYN) virtually abolished baroreflexes elicited by electrical stimulation of the aortic nerve. In addition, hypotension and bradycardia evoked by injections into the NTS of the selective EAA receptor agonists N-methyl-D-aspartate, kainate and the quisqualate-selective agonist, alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-proprionic acid were reduced by 75% or more after KYN. Paradoxically, KYN did not reduce cardiovascular responses produced by injections into the NTS of L-glutamate. These results demonstrate that 1) blockade of EAA receptors in the NTS is sufficient to abolish synaptically mediated aortic baroreflexes; 2) cardiovascular responses evoked by L-glutamate are not reduced after documented blockade of N-methyl-D-aspartate, kainate and quisqualate receptors in the NTS by KYN; and 3) under the conditions of these experiments, the pharmacological actions of exogenously administered L-glutamate are not identical to those of the neurotransmitter which is released at NTS synapses by aortic nerve stimulation. These observations suggest that an EAA or EAA analog other than L-glutamate may be the neurotransmitter of baroreceptor information in the NTS.\r"

Some of these factors have been studied and used in chemotherapy-induced neutropenia, myelodysplastic syndromes, and bone marrow failure syndromes. In this paper, we review the experience with growth factors that have been tested and that currently are being introduced in clinical trials. In addition, we report some factors with possible future interest for clinicians and researchers.\r"

  ".W": "Protein toxins such as Pseudomonas exotoxin, diphtheria toxin, and ricin may be useful in cancer therapy because they are among the most potent cell-killing agents. One molecule of a toxin delivered to the cytoplasm of a cancer cell will be lethal for that cell. However, to be therapeutically useful, these toxins need to be targeted to specific sites on the surface of cancer cells, then be internalized and ultimately reach the cell cytoplasm. This process is accomplished by eliminating binding to toxin receptors and redirecting the cell-killing activity of the toxin to receptors or antigens present on cancer cells. Typically, toxins are conjugated to cell-binding proteins such as monoclonal antibodies or growth factors. These conjugates bind and kill cancer cells selectively while normal cells, which don't bind the conjugates, are spared. Because the genes for many protein toxins have been cloned, it is possible to make genetic modifications to their structure. By deleting the DNA that codes for the toxin binding region and replacing it with various complementary DNA encoding other cell-binding proteins, it has been possible to make chimeric toxins that kill cells on the basis of the newly acquired binding activity. The ability to make these chimeras may be useful in designing future toxin-based anticancer therapies.\r"

  ".W": "The aim of this multicenter randomized trial was to compare carboplatin (400 mg/m2) and cisplatin (100 mg/m2) in patients with untreated advanced epithelial ovarian cancer. Toxicity and treatment efficacy assessed by pathological response rate, progression-free survival, and survival were the endpoints of the study. One hundred seventy-three patients with advanced epithelial ovarian cancer, F.I.G.O. (International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics) stage III and IV were accrued in the trial. The median follow-up time was 15 months (maximum, 34); three patients in each treatment arm were not eligible (four, nonepithelial ovarian cancer type; one, no data, and one, stage II). Patient characteristics were similar in the two groups. In the carboplatin-treatment arm, the overall pathological response rate was 57.3% and the complete pathological response rate was 26.8%. In the cisplatin-treatment arm, the overall pathological response rate was 71.6% and the complete pathological response rate was 24.7%. There was no statistical difference in the two arms in survival or progression-free survival. Cisplatin was more nephrotoxic while carboplatin induced a higher degree of myelosuppression, especially thrombocytopenia; however, severe hematological toxicity was seldom observed. Carboplatin is a cisplatin analog with definite activity in ovarian cancer, but it is more active than the parent compound. Because of less nonhematological toxicity, carboplatin is undoubtedly a useful substitute in patients who cannot be given cisplatin. Further experience is needed to indicate whether or not carboplatin should completely displace cisplatin in the clinical treatment of ovarian cancer.\r"

  ".W": "Between March 1985 and January 1987, 103 women with histologically proven stage III-IV ovarian carcinoma were randomly allocated to groups receiving monthly intravenous regimens of 1 g of cyclophosphamide/m2 plus either 60 mg of cisplatin (CDDP)/m2 or 150 mg of carboplatin (CBDCA)/m2 for 1 year unless disease progressed earlier. The groups were well balanced according to the stratification factors (age, histologic differentiation, extent of residual disease, and performance score), and both treatments were well tolerated and produced similar median first-course leukopenia (2,200 and 2,000 cells/microL) and thrombocytopenia (220,000 and 202,500 cells/microL). The CBDCA regimen was less emetogenic. After an interim analysis in January 1987 revealed superior progression-free survival for the group of 53 patients receiving CDDP (P = .005), the study was closed to further accrual. Those 24 patients still receiving CBDCA were encouraged to cross over to the CDDP-based regimen and 21 of them did. Following treatment crossover, the relative risk of death associated with original allocation to CBDCA receded from 1.79 to 0.97, indicating success of the salvage treatment using the CDDP-based regimen. This aborted study demonstrated the superiority of CDDP over CBDCA when the two platinum compounds were compared at equally myelosuppressive low doses in combination with 1 g of cyclophosphamide/m2. If CDDP is to be supplanted by CBDCA, larger, more myelosuppressive doses of CBDCA will be required. The platinum drug antitumor effect is a critically important therapeutic feature of this combination.\r"

  ".U": "89382812\r", 
  ".W": "The objective of this study was to compare the effect of cyclic tension on prostacyclin secretion by venous and arterial endothelial cells. Early passage endothelial cells from bovine aortas and venae cavae were subjected to cyclic deformation (up to 17% elongation and 60 cycles/min). On posttreatment days 3 and 5 a radioimmunoassay was used to assess supernatant fluids from the endothelial cells for prostacyclin activity. The results indicate that in vitro (1) under static or control conditions, venous endothelial cells secrete significantly more prostacyclin (an increase of 1.5- and 4.8-fold on days 3 and 5, respectively) than do arterial endothelial cells isolated from the same animal and (2) prostacyclin secretion by mechanically deformed venous and arterial endothelial cells was significantly less than static control cultures on days 3 and 5. However, prostaglandin I2 secretion remained at higher levels in cyclically deformed venous endothelial cells than in cyclically deformed arterial endothelial cells. These data suggest that endothelial cells from the vena cava have a greater capacity for prostacyclin secretion than have their aortic counterparts. If these observations are maintained in vivo, greater prostacyclin secretion by venous endothelial cells could represent a homeostatic mechanism aimed at reducing thrombus formation in low-velocity areas of the vasculature.\r"

It can interrupt pregnancy very early on (contragestion), mostly by interfering with the process of implantation and decidua function. It also may facilitate surgical evacuation of the uterus and certain difficult deliveries. It impedes ovulation when taken during the follicular phase. Also, RU-486 is the first antiglucocorticosteroid available for clinical use. It deserves further studies to assess its wide range of therapeutic potential.\r"

  ".W": "The first example of an enzyme that undergoes phosphorylation and dephosphorylation was phosphorylase, which catalyzes the initial step in the breakdown of tissue glycogen, a process that occurs when cells are stimulated by certain hormones. The phosphorylation reaction that activates phosphorylase is catalyzed by an enzyme designated \"phosphorylase kinase,\" whereas the dephosphorylation reaction is catalyzed by an enzyme called \"phosphorylase phosphatase.\" Phosphorylase kinase, like phosphorylase itself, is regulated by phosphorylation-dephosphorylation. In this instance the enzyme is phosphorylated and activated by a protein kinase that is the intracellular target of adenosine 3',5'-cyclic phosphate, the second messenger of hormone action that was discovered by the late Earl Sutherland. Knowledge of these steps led to the establishment of the glycogenolytic cascade in which adenosine 3',5'-cyclic phosphate, formed as a result of hormone action, first activates the adenosine 3',5'-cyclic phosphate-dependent protein kinase, which in turn activates phosphorylase kinase, which then converts inactive phosphorylase to its active form. This is followed by the breakdown of glycogen.\r"

  ".W": "Protein kinase C, an enzyme that is activated by diacylglycerol resulting from the receptor-mediated hydrolysis of inositol phospholipids, relays information of a variety of extracellular signals across the cell membrane to regulate many intracellular processes. Since this enzyme also serves as a major receptor for phorbol esters, a class of tumor promoters, it has attracted great attention from biologists interested in the mechanism of signal transduction and carcinogenesis. Recent analysis has revealed that protein kinase C is a large family of proteins, with the multiple subspecies that possess subtle individual enzymological characteristics. Biochemical and immunohistochemical studies indicate that the protein kinase C subspecies may be differently distributed in particular cell types and with limited intracellular locations. Presumably, each member of the family plays discrete roles in the processing of various physiological and pathological responses to external signals, such as in the modulation of membrane functions and the activation of gene transcription.\r"

  ".U": "89382846\r", 
  ".W": "Inositol lipids play a major role in cell signaling by functioning as precursors of second messengers. Of the three common inositol-containing lipids found in the plasma membrane, phosphatidylinositol (4,5)-bisphosphate is hydrolyzed to give diacylglycerol, which stimulates protein kinase C, and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate, which diffuses into the cell to release intracellular calcium. Inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate is metabolized to give free inositol by two separate pathways. Lithium inhibits the final dephosphorylation step of both pathways, thus reducing the supply of the free inositol required to maintain the lipid precursors used for signaling. An inositol-depletion hypothesis may explain both the teratogenic effects of lithium and its therapeutic action in controlling manic-depressive illness. One of the metabolic pathways generates inositol tetrakisphosphate, which may also play a messenger role by expanding the size of the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate-sensitive pool of calcium. Calcium imaging of single cells has begun to reveal that this inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate/calcium signaling system is organized in complex patterns, which include localization of calcium signals to discrete regions of cells and the generation of both calcium waves and calcium oscillations.\r"
